{"title": "Prevention of influenza among travellers attending at a UK travel clinic: beliefs and perceptions. A cross\u2010sectional study", "body": "An estimated 900 million people per annum travel internationally and between 2\u00b78\u201315% of travellers\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n may be infected with influenza. Infected travellers may act as a vector for the influenza virus,\n5\n, \n6\n introducing it into other communities, including their own upon return, with obvious public health consequences as demonstrated by the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and pandemic influenza H1N1.\n7\n, \n8\n\n\n\nInfluenza has the capacity to disrupt travel, and is capable of causing severe or even fatal illness. It is one of the most frequent vaccine\u2010preventable diseases in returned travellers. One study has demonstrated that travellers experienced one influenza event per 100 person\u2010month abroad\n4\n. A large study analysing the incidence of vaccine\u2010preventable disease in returned international travellers showed that 12\u00b71% of travellers with a vaccine\u2010preventable disease had influenza as compared with enteric fevers (47\u00b76%) and hepatitis A (16\u00b77%)\n9\n. Despite influenza being a common, and at times severe or even fatal illness, advice offered to travellers may be inadequate: a large Geosentinel study found that business travel was significantly associated with a diagnosis of influenza (P < 0\u00b7001), only 22\u00b75 % of business travellers had completed a pre\u2010travel health consultation.\n9\n A survey of US travellers found that although the majority of interviewees were aware of influenza prevention measures, only 41% had received influenza vaccination in the preceding season.\n10\n This lack of concern and awareness in travellers might perhaps be due to the disease being perceived, incorrectly, as not \u2018travel related\u2019.\n11\n\n\n\nInformation on the epidemiology of influenza and its seasonality is important in planning its prevention and treatment in travellers. In temperate latitudes, influenza is generally a winter illness; in tropical latitudes, it is more perennial and may peak at times travel health practitioners are unaware of.\n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n An additional risk in the tropics might be through transmission by person to person contact in addition to the more usual droplet and aerosol spread.\n17\n\n\n\nDifferent strains of seasonal influenza virus tend to circulate in the northern and southern hemispheres, which are reflected in the annual composition of the influenza vaccine; an important consideration is that travellers may not be protected when the circulating strains are mismatched for the northern and southern hemispheres.\n18\n, \n19\n In addition, within the same hemisphere, the timing of influenza seasons and dominant strains may differ by continent, region and country.\n20\n Furthermore, both northern and southern hemisphere influenza virus strains may circulate simultaneously in the tropics.\n21\n Importantly, strains from both hemispheres may circulate at international mass gatherings such as pilgrimages, resulting in vaccinated travellers not being adequately protected against influenza while travelling.\n22\n, \n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n, \n26\n When novel influenza strains emerge, no vaccine is usually available. as illustrated during the first months of the recent pH1N1 pandemic.\n27\n, \n28\n\n\n\nAntivirals may be used both for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza when influenza vaccine is unavailable or contraindicated;\n29\n There is, therefore, a putative role for the carriage of antiviral drugs by travellers, for use on a \u2018stand\u2010by treatment\u2019 basis; travellers might then also benefit from the greater therapeutic efficacy obtained from the early initiation of therapy.\n30\n\n\n\nGiven the limited data on these issues, this study investigated, in the setting of a travel health consultation, travellers\u2019 beliefs and perceptions regarding measures to prevent infection with influenza, utilizing cognitive\u2010intention and cognitive\u2010behaviour approaches. The study sought to understand whether travellers would use antiviral therapeutic and stand\u2010by treatment to treat infection with influenza if these were dispensed as part of a travel health consultation.\n\nThe study was conducted in September 2009 at the Royal Free Travel Clinic (London, UK), a World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Travellers\u2032 Health. The Travel Clinic is linked to University College London Medical School and provides travel health risk assessments and a clinical travel health service to residents of North London and further afield. North London is a reasonably affluent area, with a diversity of ethnic groups represented. Travellers comprised both business and leisure, including those travelling to visit friends and/or relatives (VFR).\n\nA cross\u2010sectional study was conducted through a questionnaire\u2010based survey completed by 15\u00b75% (96/621) of all travellers who attended the Royal Free Travel Clinic during the study period. One hundred travellers were recruited with participation being voluntary and with no financial incentive; four questionnaires were spoilt and could not be used as part of the analysis. The study period was kept quite short (1 month) to diminish the possible effect of publicity, which could bias the results. All subjects completed a signed informed consent after reading the study information sheet. The institutional ethical review board (Joint UCLH/UCL Biomedical Research Unit) approved the study, which was funded by an unrestricted educational grant from F. Hoffmann\u2010La Roche, Basel, Switzerland, the manufacturer and marketer of oseltamivir phosphate. The funders had no role in the design or conduct of the study.\n\nA 12\u2010item, anonymous, self\u2010administered questionnaire was completed by travellers while waiting for pre\u2010travel advice. The questionnaire took approximately 7 minutes to complete. Travellers were approached sequentially for participation and provided with a study information sheet and an informed consent form. The Information Sheet described the voluntary nature of participating, the benefits and risks of participation, and a statement on data privacy and protection; the study information sheet did not provide information on antiviral drugs or influenza.\n\nThe questionnaire was constructed using social cognitive theories as they apply to health\u2010related behaviour.\n31\n, \n32\n The questionnaire (see Table 1) applied the planned behaviour theory and was based on the main and proximal determinant of a travellers\u2019 behaviour, as well as their intention to perform the behaviour; the intention is thought to reflect the motivation and willingness to try and achieve the goals. A number of moderator variables were included to examine the cognitive\u2010intention and cognitive\u2010behaviour relationships as both \u2018direct experience\u2019 and to increase the predictive validity of the planned behaviour.\n\nThe questionnaire was designed to assess behavioural intention, personal attitude, perceived knowledge and motivation, which were taken as cognitive factors for this study; external behavioural and subjective norms could not be tested. The questionnaire was independently evaluated by two influenza experts as well as by travellers recruited into a pilot study (n = 5) to assess comprehension and reliability of the questionnaire. The questionnaire\u2019s consistency was measured by a test\u2010retest in travellers on the same day, so that a high reliability coefficient was acquired. However, the high reliability coefficient could be an overestimate, as the two tests were administered quite close together in time, permitting some memory effect. Possible responses were deliberately dichotomous, to increase response rate and comprehension.\n\nIn addition to answering questions on influenza, subjects also provided socio\u2010demographic data (sex, age), travel information (travel history, planned itinerary including travel duration, season, purpose of travel, whether travelling alone or accompanied) and health information (underlying conditions, perceived health, allergies, drugs consumption, pregnancy). Included in the analysis were those individuals who travelled for trekking (as backpacking), volunteering or missionary work (as cooperation), tourism (as holidays), labour (as business) or to visit their friends and/or family (as VFR). The health of each traveller was recorded at the time of their attendance at the travel clinic and this was used to determine their self\u2010perception of their health at that time. Administered travel\u2010related vaccines and the prescription of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis were also recorded.\n\nFactors associated with measures to prevent infection with influenza were investigated by applying two dependent variables: an intention to comply with influenza antiviral drugs used either as a preventive or therapeutic measure. Variables included were those related to a travellers\u2019 socio\u2010economic and health status, to the travel itinerary itself and the cognitive factors generated from the questionnaire.\n\nStatistical analysis was compared using the Chi\u2010square test or the Fisher exact test; continuous variables were compared by use of either the Student\u2019s \u2018t\u2019 test, or the Mann\u2013Whitney U test when the data were not distributed normally. To adjust for potential confounders, all covariates found to be significantly associated (P < 0\u00b705) with the dependent variables in the bivariate analysis were considered for inclusion in the binary logistic regression analysis. Age was stratified in the bivariate analysis to facilitate interpretation, but it was included as a continuous variable in the multivariate analysis. Beliefs, intention and perception questions were considered to be affirmative if travellers answered \u2018yes\u2019. For both multivariate models, all data relating to a single respondent were excluded when any of variables included in the model had missing values.\n\nThe magnitude of the association between the intention to comply with influenza prevention measures and explanatory variables was measured by applying odds ratios (ORs), expressed as crude odds ratio in the bivariate analysis and adjusted odds ratio in the multivariate analysis, together with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI95). The model\u2019s ability to discriminate between groups was assessed with the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC); the model\u2019s calibration was examined using the Hosmer and Lemershow test. All tests were two\u2010tailed, and a P value of <0\u00b705 was defined as statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using SPSS 11.0 Statistical Software Package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\n\nData were available from 96 travellers who attended the Royal Free Travel Health Clinic in September 2009 (from 1st to 27th September 2009).\n\n\nTable 2 summarizes the selected characteristics of the 96 travellers who constituted the sample size of 15\u00b75% (96/621) of all travellers who attended the travel clinic at the time of the study. The median age was 32 years (range: 18\u201371 years), with the majority of travellers being female (56%); 75\u00b76% had no underlying medical condition, 87\u00b78% were travelling alone, 38\u00b79% were travelling to Asia and 41\u00b74% were backpackers with an intended median duration of travel of 32 days (range: 4\u20131460 days). Acceptance of at least one recommended vaccine while attending the travel clinic was 93\u00b73% and antimalarial chemoprophylaxis was dispensed to 52\u00b77% of travellers.\n\nThe seasonal influenza vaccination coverage for the preceding 5 years was 20\u00b78% (20/96), being statistically significantly higher for older (>60 years old) travellers (66\u00b77%; 4/6; P\u2010value = 0\u00b7018) than younger travellers (18\u00b76%; 16/86), and for travellers with an underlying medical condition (45\u00b75%; 10/22; P\u2010value = 0\u00b7026) when compared against healthy travellers (13\u00b75%; 10/74).Influenza vaccine is administered in the United Kingdom without charge to those aged 65 years and over and for those with a serious underlying medical condition, a reflection of these findings.\n\nThe overall intention by travellers to take influenza anti\u2010viral drugs as a preventive measure (Table 2) was 58\u00b73% and did not differ by age (58\u00b70% among <40 years; 56\u00b75% for \u226540 years, P = 0\u00b7903), nor by other personal or travel characteristics (P > 0\u00b705). When asked specifically which of the two licensed neuraminidase inhibitors subjects would choose for prophylactic use, the majority (81\u00b70%) indicated oseltamivir ahead of zanamivir (19\u00b70%).\n\nThe overall intention to take influenza antiviral drugs as a therapeutic measure (Table 2) was 74\u00b72% with compliance differing markedly by age (56\u00b75% <40 years; 81\u00b78%\u226540 years, P = 0\u00b7015), and by dispensed antimalarial chemoprophylaxis (59\u00b75% among non\u2010dispensed; 84\u00b78% among dispensed, P = 0\u00b7008). Other personal or travel characteristics did not influence a travellers intention to comply (P > 0\u00b705). In addition, travellers were asked which of the two licensed neuraminidase inhibitors they would choose for treatment: the majority (82\u00b70%) selected oseltamivir ahead of zanamivir (18\u00b70%).\n\n\nTable 3 describes travellers\u2019 beliefs and perceptions related to their intention to comply with influenza prevention measures. Most travellers reported that they were aware of the severity of infection with influenza (90\u00b76%), the availability of influenza vaccine (93\u00b78%) and the availability of specific influenza antiviral drugs (78\u00b71%); in addition, they perceived travel as a risk factor for acquiring influenza (71\u00b79%). However, only 57\u00b73% reported that they would receive influenza vaccine and only 20\u00b78% reported having received an influenza vaccine in the preceding 5 years.\n\nBy bivariate analysis (see Table 3), negative perceptions of knowledge about influenza prevention (i.e. being unaware that a vaccine against influenza was available), positive attitudes towards influenza prevention (i.e. belief that vaccination against influenza will reduce the risk of acquiring influenza while traveling) and motivation (i.e. would consider carrying oseltamivir or zanamivir while travelling) were significantly associated with the intention to comply with influenza antiviral drugs as a preventive measure. Knowledge about the potential risk of infection with influenza while travelling and a positive attitude and motivation towards prevention of influenza were significantly associated with an intention to comply with influenza antiviral drugs as a therapeutic measure.\n\nAfter consideration of variables exploring demography, beliefs and knowledge towards compliance with influenza prevention measures (Table 3; adjusted Odds Ratio), a lack of knowledge about influenza prevention and a positive attitude towards the prevention of influenza were independently associated with an intention to comply with influenza antiviral drugs as a preventive measure. On the other hand, knowledge about the potential risk of infection with influenza was independently associated with an intention to comply with influenza antiviral drugs as a therapeutic measure (Table 4; adjusted Odds Ratio).\n\nThe study was conducted during a declared influenza pandemic, phase 6 of the influenza pH1N1 pandemic. As a newly emerged global health threat, the pH1N1 virus posed significant challenges to public health and media information strategies.\n33\n, \n34\n In the initial stages of the pandemic, an absence of information about the virus as well as a lack of an effective vaccine or knowledge about the effectiveness of antiviral drugs created significant anxiety.\n35\n It was in this context that measures of protection were promoted; however, the effectiveness of control measures in a pandemic depends on the awareness of the general population and their willingness to cooperate, which in turn is likely to be associated with the perceived personal risk of contracting influenza. It was for these reasons that it was hypothesized that travellers would have a raised awareness regarding infection with influenza and be willing to receive preventive and stand\u2010by interventions against influenza. However, public awareness and anxiety can wane during a major public health incident, related to disease severity and media coverage. Evidence from national telephone surveys in the United Kingdom over the period 1 May 2009 to 10 January 2010 supports this assertion, and psychological processes should be considered when designing health interventions.\n35\n\n\n\nAlthough, at least in theory, compliance with influenza prevention measures should be quite simple,\n36\n, \n37\n, \n38\n, \n39\n the acceptability of these measures among travellers was unknown. To our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate the associations between determinants of intention by travellers to comply with antiviral recommendations and individual cognitive factors. Of importance, the findings relate to the general population in as much as the majority of the sampled population did not possess any underlying medical condition (75\u00b76%).\n40\n\n\n\nWe believe that utilization of behavioural theory enabled us to gain some understanding of the factors governing traveller\u2019s choices, providing some insights into questions around \u2018compliance\u2019 or \u2018adherence\u2019, an important issue in travel health, given that many of the discipline\u2019s interventions are prophylactic in nature. To some extent, this was confirmed by our finding that an intention to comply with antiviral prescription was strongly associated with prophylactic antimalarial prescription. This finding gels with the notion that adding influenza prevention and treatment to the offerings of travel clinics could be of benefit to the travelling public.\n\nOur study has three main limitations: a small sample size, internal validity and \u2018fear generalisability\u2019. Undertaken during the pandemic at a time when the evolution of the pandemic was uncertain, we cannot exclude biases introduced by the mass media. It was for this reason that we kept the study period relatively short. In addition, we surveyed only one traveller per family, to avoid grouping answers and decreasing external validity; these two measures would also have impacted our response rate. This might also explain why older travellers are not well represented, although it should be noted that the mean age of travellers attending our travel clinic in 2009 was 40\u00b70 (SD 15\u00b74), with <10% being 60 years or older, an age profile quite similar to that of the study sample where the median age was 32 years old. For these reasons, we believe that our findings should be confirmed in a large cross\u2010sectional study.\n\nAlthough an intention to comply with preventive antiviral recommendations was predicted mainly by variables relating to knowledge and perception of effective preventive measures, intention to comply with therapeutic recommendations was predicted only by knowledge of the severity of infection with influenza, the latter being an important finding.\n\nThe study was conducted on attendees of the Royal Free Travel Clinic during September 2009, and likely represents a broad cross\u2010section of travellers. Availability of influenza vaccines and antivirals will likely differ by country and setting, but it would seem sensible to make these interventions available in travel clinics, especially as the public\u2019s influenza awareness in the post\u2010pandemic period is likely to be heightened.\n\nOf note, seasonal influenza coverage in travellers in the preceding 5 years was quite low, around 20%, with reports in the literature citing rates in travellers of 13\u00b77\u201341%,\n10\n, \n41\n although rates were not inconsistent with those seen in high\u2010risk groups in the general population, such as those with underlying medical conditions or advanced age. Interestingly, comparing the seasonal influenza vaccine target groups of elderly people and those with chronic illnesses, one notes similarities between our results (66\u00b77% and 47\u00b70% respectively) and those reported by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on behalf of Department of Health for registered patients in general practices in England for 2003\u20134 (78\u00b71% in 2005\u20136 for 65 or over aged population and 47\u00b72% in 2003\u20134, respectively),\n40\n and quite consistent with that observed in Swiss business travellers (27\u00b72%).\n42\n\n\n\nTo increase the intention to comply with influenza antiviral use in travellers, practitioners might usefully explain the use and role of vaccines and antiviral drugs; where constraints on the use of antivirals exist, practitioners might challenge these on scientific grounds.\n43\n, \n44\n, \n45\n, \n46\n Consideration should be given where considered clinically appropriate, to travellers being provided with antivirals to carry with them on a stand\u2010by basis; traveller acceptance of this strategy is likely to be improved by explanation that influenza can be a severe illness. A particular consideration would be a caution with the prescription of stand\u2010by antivirals for travellers to malarious areas,\n47\n given that malaria may present as influenza\u2010like illness: seasonality and destination would need consideration by the prescribing practitioner. Support for this strategy comes from a recent study conducted in business travellers, which detected good knowledge of the transmission and symptoms of influenza; interestingly, 9\u00b77% of travellers in this study acknowledged having carried antiviral medication on their last business trip, with 7\u00b70% of travellers having actually used the carried medication.\n42\n\n\n\nOf interest, and a possible indication of the public\u2019s acceptance of the concept of stand\u2010by medication for the treatment of influenza, was the unexpected increase in 2005 of oseltamivir prescriptions, for use during a future outbreak of H5N1 influenza virus infection,\n48\n attributed to widespread personal stockpiling.\n49\n Some studies have proposed individuals\u2019 personalities and their degree of apprehension about avian influenza, rather than differences in their knowledge as the basic reason for this personal stockpiling.\n50\n The purchase of very large antiviral stockpiles by many developed countries assuages equity of access objections to personal stockpiling, at least for travel purposes. An issue for travellers is the accessibility of safe and effective antivirals when travelling. The widespread practice of counterfeiting and lack of security in the drug supply in some regions argues for the carrying of personal medication sourced in the traveller\u2019s home country.\n\nTo increase the intention to comply with antiviral drugs as a preventive measure, it may be useful to develop a health education campaign about the availability and safety of specific antiviral drugs, as well as the efficacy of the prevention measures. A recent opinion by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice recommends prompt antiviral therapy for high\u2010risk groups, and for non\u2010high\u2010risk groups when treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset, a view not incompatible with the provision of antiviral emergency stand\u2010by medication (ESBM) to travellers.\n51\n\n\n\nThis study identifies some of the beliefs and perceptions travellers hold with regard to the prevention of influenza and in particular, during the H1N1 pandemic. As a common vaccine\u2010preventable disease, influenza vaccination should be recommended for travellers alongside the necessity for the year round availability of hemisphere appropriate influenza vaccination. Although our findings suggest that there is a role for travel clinics in both the prevention and treatment of influenza in travellers, corroboration of our findings in other travel clinic settings and among different cohorts of travellers is desirable. This could enable potentially the development of future guidance for the prevention of influenza in travellers, a highly mobile population who can introduce infections into susceptible populations with the potential public health consequences.\n\nS.T. is a former employee of, and is a paid consultant to F.
