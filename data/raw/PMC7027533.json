{"title": "The expanding role of mass spectrometry in the field of vaccine development", "body": "Vaccination is considered one of the most cost effective medical interventions that have contributed significantly to improving public health during the last century. Various types of vaccines have been developed to eradicate infectious diseases that once killed millions of people: the live\u2010attenuated vaccines (weakened or altered), inactivated vaccines (toxins generated by the bacteria, and not the bacteria themselves) and subunit and conjugate vaccines (segments of the pathogen).1, 2 Currently, more than eighty vaccines have been licensed for use in the United States (more than 15 viral vaccines are also FDA approved) and several vaccine candidates are in the development pipeline3, 4 (https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm093833.htm). Efforts are ongoing to not only improve existing vaccines but to develop novel vaccines targeting infectious diseases with a high unmet medical need. The global public health community's goal is to develop preventative and therapeutic vaccines for major diseases targets such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, Zika, Chikungunya, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile, Lyme disease, Lassa fever, Yellow fever, Nipah virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and Dengue fever.5, 6, 7, 8 Unfortunately, despite the increased understanding of immunology and greater insight into the viruses responsible for these infections, limited success has been achieved towards development of vaccines for these epidemics.\n\nAs the target populations for the vaccines are healthy individuals, pregnant women, or infants, vaccine safety is of paramount importance. Appropriately, the vaccine landscape is changing from traditional vaccine approaches to cost\u2010effective, highly scalable, and safe recombinant vaccines.9, 10 Using recombinant DNA technology, antigens are expressed in yeast, Escherichia coli, baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), or mammalian cell lines.11, 12, 13 Recombinant antigens are engineered to mimic the first step of virus attachment to the cell surface which is mediated by specific glycoproteins. The expressed recombinant antigens undergo multiple purification cycles to produce highly purified vaccines.14, 15\n\n\nIn order for recombinant vaccines to be acceptable to regulatory authorities, in\u2010depth analytical characterization needs to be performed on the clinical trial material (CTM) to ensure the vaccine is safe and effective. Quality controlled (QC) analytical testing is routinely performed on the clinical trial material during batch release to certify that the content (testing performed by either reversed\u2010phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP\u2010HPLC), UV/Vis spectrophotometer [measuring absorbance at 280 nm] or SoloVPE [newest evolution of UV\u2010Vis spectroscopy]), purity (testing performed by either size exclusion chromatography [SEC], sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [SDS\u2010PAGE], or capillary electrophoresis sodium dodecyl sulfate [CE\u2010SDS] and capillary isoelectric focusing [cIEF]) and residual impurities (testing performed by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] for host cell proteins, quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR] for host cell DNA etc.) are within the product specifications and to ensure potency (testing performed by ELISA or ligand free binding assays such as biolayer interferometry [BLI], surface plasmon resonance [SPR]) and safety (microbial enumeration tests, endotoxin testing etc.) of the vaccine candidate (as per ICH harmonised tripartite guideline Q6B, http://www.ich.org). Another regulatory prerequisite is to perform extensive physiochemical characterization of these recombinant antigens. Mass spectrometry is the method of choice to perform the comprehensive physiochemical characterization of glycoproteins. Mass spectrometry\u2010based characterization is critical not only from the standpoint of understanding the product's structure but also to help establish clinical trial material release specifications and to ensure quality (Figure 1). Thus, innovative vaccine structural design followed by comprehensive analytical characterization is required to successfully develop novel vaccines against epidemic infectious diseases impacting large segments of the global population.\n\nIn this review, we focus on the expanding role of mass spectrometry in vaccine development, irrespective of the route of production. We also highlight the regulatory challenges and limitations of mass spectrometry\u2010based techniques which constrain its further implementation as a quality control batch release assay in cGMP manufacturing.\n\nThe quest for a safe and effective vaccine to protect against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV\u20101) infection is ongoing.24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 Even after thirty five years of the HIV epidemic, there is no vaccine approaching licensure. An estimated 36.7 million people globally were living with HIV in 2016, with approximately 1.8 million new infections diagnosed in 2016. Despite major advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) against HIV\u20101, an inspired global commitment will be required to end the epidemic by 2030 (http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet). Unfortunately, developing an effective vaccine has been very challenging for reasons related to the nature of the HIV\u20101 virion.31 Of several vaccine concepts tested in efficacy trials, only one, the RV144 pox virus prime, protein boost (ALVAC/AIDSVAX B/E) vaccine, showed a low level of vaccine protection with an estimated 31% vaccine efficacy.32\n\n\nOne of the hypotheses being explored for protective immunity against HIV is to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that target the highly glycosylated HIV\u20101 virion\u2010associated Envelop.33 A number of approaches are being pursued in the HIV\u20101 vaccine development field to establish protective immunity, including monomeric gp120 subunits and oligomeric gp140 and trimeric envelope glycoprotein to elicit bNAbs.34, 35, 36 Each of these Envelop (Env) immunogens have multiple exposed epitopes and are heterogeneously glycosylated molecules, with more than 50% of their mass consisting of glycans (\u223c28 N\u2010linked glycans). It is critically important to monitor this HIV Env glycan shield during vaccine development.37 A number of methods are available to perform the glycan characterization, but hydrophilic\u2010interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) in conjunction with both positive and negative ion mode MS is the most routinely used method for the glycan profiling. LC\u2010MS/MS using multistage fragmentation techniques such as collision induced dissociation (CID) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) for the analysis of proteolytically digested glycoproteins is the most commonly used method to determine the site of glycosylation.\n\nThe first study to analyze the N\u2010linked glycosylation of recombinant gp120 which was expressed in CHO cells was performed by fractionating the tryptic digest by reversed phase HPLC with the peptide fraction amino acid sequences subsequently identified by amino acid analysis (AAA) or N\u2010terminal sequencing.38 Extensive analysis of the Env immunogens using MS\u2010based methods was carried out by Desaire and collaborators. In the last decade, that group demonstrated broadly applicable methods to analyze glycosylation and disulfide mapping of the HIV Env protein. The developed methods have been successfully used to analyze multiple immunogens; gp120 monomers, gp140 oligomers, gp140 trimers, BG505.SOSIP native trimers. MS experiments conducted and results reported by Desarie and collaborators have significantly contributed to advance the development of a HIV vaccine.39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48 Recently, Go et al used a MS\u2010based approach to map the complete glycosylation profile at every site on eleven trimeric Envs to accomplish two goals. (i) To determine which glycosylation sites contain conserved glycan profiles across different trimeric Envs. (ii) To identify the variables that impact Env's glycosylation profile at sites with divergent glycosylation. The study concluded that the processing of many glycosylation sites on recombinant Envs are not affected by the expression system.49\n\n\nCrispin and collaborators also extensively investigated the native glycosylation profile of Envs, in particularly, trimeric immunogen BG505 SOSIP.664.50, 51, 52, 53 Their studies led to an increased understanding of the glycan shield of the Env and it is now largely accepted that to induce bNAbs, the HIV vaccine candidate should have a glycan profile similar to the one present on the native Env trimers.54, 55, 56 In a thorough study on trimeric Env glycosylation, Behrens et al51 employed a parallel MS\u2010based approach exploiting MALDI\u2010TOF MS and LC\u2010MS/MS to analyze site\u2010specific glycosylation of a soluble, recombinant trimer BG505 SOSIP.664, resulting in the identification of 20 out of 28 N\u2010linked glycans.51 In a separate set of studies, Harvey et al utilized ion mobility mass spectrometry\u2010based techniques to analyze Env glycosylation (Figure 3). The ability of ion mobility to separate the isomeric N\u2010linked glycan was utilized to profile complex type, high\u2010mannose isomers in the trimeric envelop.57, 58, 59, 60, 61\n\n\nMore recently, Paulson and collaborators reported MS\u2010based site\u2010specific N\u2010glycosylation analysis of six different strains of HIV Env glycoprotein. They presented a general MS proteomics strategy that uses specific endoglycosidases to introduce mass signatures that distinguished glycopeptides that were unoccupied or occupied by high\u2010mannose/hybrid or complex\u2010type glycans. The method workflow included protease treatment, sequential glycosidase digestion (first treated with Endo H and then digested with PNGase F in O18\u2010water) followed by LC\u2010MS/MS analysis (Figure 4). The authors determined that almost all of the glycan sites were occupied for the soluble Env trimers. The reported method has the potential to serve as a robust tool to facilitate the rational design and development of vaccine immunogens.62\n\n\nTwo HIV\u20101 subtype C gp120 Envs (1086.C and TV1.C) are being currently evaluated in a pivotal Phase IIb/III efficacy trial in South Africa (HVTN702) to assess if HIV infection among adults can be prevented. This trial was designed to confirm and extend the partial protection seen against HIV\u20101 infection in the RV144 Thai trial (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/first-new-hiv-vaccine-efficacy-study-seven-years-has-begun). Wang et al carried out extensive LC\u2010MS/MS characterization for these vaccine antigens (reference standard, representative material equivalent to cGMP material) to confirm their sequence integrity, their biophysical immunogenicity, glycosylation patterns (both N\u2010linked and O\u2010linked), and disulfide linkages. Data from this report demonstrated the immunogenicity of the gp120 antigens, provided comprehensive characterization of the molecules, set the benchmark for assessment of current and future CTM lots, and established the physicochemical groundwork for interpretation of future clinical trial data.63\n\n\nAs an example of the applicability of MS\u2010based methods, trimeric Env glycoproteins commercially manufactured under current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) were analyzed using a hybrid linear trap/Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer coupled with a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC system. The BG505.SOSIP.664 HIV\u20101 vaccine candidate cGMP was produced from a 200L bioreactor and extensive characterized for molecular structure, disulfide bond patterns, and N\u2010linked glycosylation profile. This is the first report of a trimeric HIV vaccine clinical trial material produced under cGMP conditions being comprehensively characterized using mass spectrometry. The methods reported in this study should pave the way for the cGMP production of other native\u2010like Env glycoprotein trimers of various designs.15\n\n\nMS has been instrumental for deciphering the structure of these complex glycoproteins being developed and tested as HIV vaccines as exemplified above. The MS\u2010 based structural characterization methods provided complementary information to the routinely used analytical methods for in\u2010process and batch release testing for refining the Env structure during vaccine design.\n\nInfluenza virus is a segmented, enveloped RNA virus and is among the most virulent pathogens. Within the influenza virus family, there are three genera: A, B and C. Influenza A viruses are further subtyped according to their surface antigens, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), of which 18 HA subtypes and 11 NA subtypes have been identified to date and many different combinations of HA & NA are possible (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/influenza-a-virus-subtypes.htm). Vaccination against influenza virus is the most effective means of prevention and since 1945 egg\u2010derived and cell\u2010derived influenza vaccines have been used as a preventive tool during flu season.\n\nIn 1995, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended developing cell\u2010derived influenza vaccines and, since then, a number of mammalian cell lines have been evaluated for the manufacture of influenza vaccines.64, 65, 66 In 2012, the FDA approved the first cell culture\u2010derived influenza vaccine, Flucelvax (Novartis vaccine) and in 2013, the FDA approved Flublok (Protein Sciences Corporation); the first licensed recombinant vaccine using an insect virus expression system (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/vaccines.htm). During seasonal epidemics, 5\u201015% of the worldwide population is typically infected, resulting in 3\u20105 million cases of severe illness and up to 500 000 deaths per year (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/2003/fs211/en/).\n\nThe unpredictability associated with the strain of influenza virus in circulation is due to antigenic drift (frequent mutations of viral proteins) and, to address this, strain selection is made annually to ensure protection.67 Single\u2010radial immunodiffusion (SRID) is the approved method to measure the content of each hemagglutinin (HA) in the inactivated influenza vaccines. The SRID method to quantify the HA content of influenza vaccines relies on strain\u2010specific reference reagents the availability of which may cause delays in the formulation of the influenza vaccine especially during a pandemic outbreak. In a WHO workshop organized in 2010 in Ottawa, Canada, it was decided to explore alternative approaches for quantification of HA content to speed up the vaccine delivery process in future responses to pandemic influenza and in seasonal vaccine release.68 Various promising methods as alternatives to SRID assay are currently being developed including HPLC and MS. The primary objective is to have a method that can be used to perform quantitation without reference standards, and thus, to formulate virus strains without delay owing to reference reagent availability.69\n\n\nMS\u2010based proteomics methods for measuring a HA strain content are being developed at the Centers for Vaccine Evaluation (CVE) in Canada and the National Center For Environmental Health (NCEH) in the Centers for Disease Control And Prevention (CDC) in the United States. These MS\u2010based methods are being developed to be used in a quality control lab to simultaneously identify the three (or four) different virus strains and to measure each of the strains in the influenza vaccine. The researchers at NCEH\u2010CDC have been specifically working on the evaluation of isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) methods for accurate quantitation of HA in primary influenza standards since 2008. LC\u2010MS/MS methods involving isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) in conjunction with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) have been applied to detect targeted peptides using isotopically labeled peptide standards for the absolute quantification of HA subtypes in the influenza vaccine (Figure 5). The LC\u2010IDMS\u2010MRM assay is applicable to trivalent matrices, and can be used without sample cleanup and in the presence of detergents and other proteins. More importantly, the IDMS method was performed without using any strain\u2010specific virus reference standards for the quantification of HA in the avian influenza H5N1 vaccine. However, direct comparison of results obtained by LC\u2010IDMS\u2010MRM and those obtained by SRID was not performed.70, 71, 72\n\n\nIn the spring of 2013, the Chinese Health and Family Planning Commission notified the WHO of the first confirmed human infection with avian influenza (H7N9) virus and LC\u2010IDMS\u2010MRM which had been developed to quantify HA and NA in H7N2, H7N7, and H7N9 influenza [A/Netherlands/219/2003 (H7N7) and A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9] was used to analyze these samples to confirm the H7N9 strain.73 In a separate study, the HA antigen yields of the vaccine strain [A/Puerto/Rico/8/34 (PR8)] was also determined using LC\u2010IDMS\u2010MRM.74 The researchers at NCEH\u2010CDC also demonstrated a unique quantification of immunoreactive viral influenza proteins by immunoaffinity capture followed by IDMS\u2010MRM (IC\u2010IDMS\u2010MRM). The IC\u2010IDMS\u2010MRM method is truly an alternative to the approved SRID method as it has dual purpose \u201cpotency and content determination\u201d, was found to be equivalent to the SRID method and can also be used in response to a pandemic influenza threat.75, 76 Additionally, a direct Ultra\u2010Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC)\u2010IDMS method was reported for the rapid and accurate quantification of influenza NA.77 Label\u2010free MS\u2010based methods have also been reported for the simultaneous identification and quantification of HA and NA in influenza vaccine with samples analyzed by LC\u2010MSE on a Waters Synapt G2 mass spectrometer.78 Quantification of proteins by label\u2010free LC\u2010MSE is a powerful tool, in this method, alternating scans of low collision energy and elevated collision energy during LC\u2010MS analysis to obtain both protein identity and quantity in a single experiment. Quantification based on the experimental data showed that the signal intensity was proportional to concentration which allowed for the amount of any protein in the mixture to be estimated. LC\u2010MSE utilizes parallel, multiplex fragmentation where all peptide precursors are simultaneously fragmented throughout the chromatographic separation process regardless of intensity. This allows data\u2010independent identification of lower abundance peptides and provides increased proteome coverage and dynamic range of protein quantification compared with data\u2010dependent LC\u2010MS/MS.79, 80\n\n\nThe researchers at the Center for Vaccine Valuation (CVE) in Canada were concurrently working to develop chromatography\u2010based methods for measuring the HA content in the influenza vaccine and developed a number of HPLC methods. Garcia\u2010Canas et al. reported an on\u2010line method that combined SEC with RP\u2010 HPLC to effectively separate 3 subtypes of HA antigens in the trivalent vaccines based on their different elution profiles. However, these methods need antigen reference standards to quantitate the HA antigen.81, 82 CVE researchers also reported a method for the simultaneous and absolute quantification of HA and NA levels in commercial influenza vaccines and the separated antigens were identified by enzymatic digestion followed by LC\u2010MSE.83, 84 More recently, a fast and highly selective method to determine HA content in quadrivalent influenza vaccine by reversed\u2010phase HPLC was reported. This HPLC method showed excellent resolution of all four hemagglutinins and is also the only physicochemical method capable of distinguishing the B strains in quadrivalent influenza vaccines.85 The eluents used for this HPLC method were 0.04% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 0.03% (v/v) TFA in 25% ACN and 75% 2\u2010propanol. With these conditions, the developed method could easily be implemented as an online LC\u2010MS/MS method to speed data collection and gain additional structural information of the separated HA antigens.\n\nThe SRID assay has been used for over 40 years as a quantitative and potency method throughout the world despite issues regarding variability and availability of standard reagents. Thus, even though new methods like HPLC and mass spectrometry are being developed, it will take some time for these methods to be adopted worldwide. As the next influenza pandemic cannot be predicted, the health authorities\u2019 pandemic preparedness efforts include efforts to ensure expedited availability of pandemic vaccines. Methods such as HPLC and MS, with their ability to quantitate antigens without standard reference reagents, can become a cornerstone of pandemic influenza preparedness.\n\nThe viral genus Flavivirus, includes Dengue virus, yellow fever virus, and Zika virus. Dengue represents the most common mosquito\u2010borne disease in humans and causes \u223c400 million cases of infection, \u223c500 000 hospitalizations, and \u223c12 500 deaths estimated to occur each year.86\n\n\nThe world's first dengue vaccine Dengvaxia (CYD\u2010TDV) developed by Sanofi Pasteur is a live attenuated tetravalent chimeric vaccine made using recombinant DNA technology. The tetravalent dengue vaccine CYD\u2010TDV produced in mammalian Vero cells consists of four chimeric viruses. The N\u2010glycans from the Env protein of Dengvaxia were released by in\u2010gel PNGase F deglycosylation, purified and measured by MALDI\u2010TOF MS in positive ionization mode using 2,5\u2010dihydroxybenzoic acid as a matrix. Detected ions were singly charged sodium adducts and monoisotopic masses. The N\u2010linked glycans of the Env proteins were found to be a mix of high\u2010mannose, hybrid and complex glycans (Figure 6). Site\u2010specific N\u2010glycosylation analysis of Dengvaxia using nanoLC\u2013ESI\u2010MS/MS demonstrated that both asparagine residues 67 and 153 were glycosylated and, predominately, the N\u2010glycan at Asn67 was a high mannose\u2010type and at Asn153 was mainly a combination of complex\u2010 and hybrid\u2010type glycans.87 This study provided important new insights for the role of glycans in the dengue virus\u2010host cell interactions.\n\nIn a separate study, accurate quantitation of the expressed four viral particles in the tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD) was performed using targeted MS in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode.88 The study described an orthogonal quantitation strategy (targeted MS in SRM mode) and demonstrated that the variability of the MS method was low (between 8% and 17%) and the assay was linear between 6.25 and 200 nmol/L. Based on the reported method performance, it could be used to release future batches of the tetravalent dengue vaccine.\n\nEbola hemorrhagic fever is one of the most fatal viral diseases worldwide with the 2014\u20102016 Ebola outbreak causing over 28 000 cases of infection and 11 000 deaths. After 40 years, the quest to have an effective vaccine for Ebola virus infections continues. Presently, a number of vaccine candidates are being explored and multiple experimental clinical trials are ongoing.\n\nAs evidence of the utility of MS as an important tool in vaccine development, it has recently been used to characterize some of these emerging Ebola vaccine candidates.89 In one of the studies, glycan identification in the transmembrane glycoprotein (GP1) and soluble glycoprotein (sGP) of Ebola virus expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (EBOV Yambuku) was performed with normal\u2010phase HPLC, MALDI\u2010TOF MS, and negative ion nanoLC\u2010ESI\u2010MS/MS. The results showed that most glycans were complex, and sialylation was primarily absent.90 More recently, comprehensive characterization of glycosylation was carried out on the N\u2010linked and O\u2010linked glycosylation patterns for GP1,2 of five pathogenic Ebola viruses (BDBV, SUDV, TAFV, and two EBOV variants) produced in mammalian 293 T cells. The data presented demonstrated that the N\u2010glycan patterns were similar between GP1,2 but O\u2010glycan patterns were remarkably different on GP1,2 the five Ebola viruses. This study should serve as the foundation for future Ebola viral entry and immunogenicity studies.91\n\n\nTo improve on the conventional approaches for absolute quantitation of GP1 in Ebola virus\u2010like particles (eVLPs), an isotope dilution full\u2010scan liquid chromatography\u2010high\u2010resolution mass spectrometry method was developed using an UltiMate 3000 HPLC and an Orbitrap Elite Hybrid Ion Trap\u2010Orbitrap mass spectrometer.92 The reported MS quantitation method provided not only a means to rapidly determine eVLP batch quality based upon quantitation of antigenic GP1 but also ensured adequate preclinical/clinical dosing.\n\nChikungunya is a mosquito\u2010borne viral disease, endemic in Africa and Southeast Asia and has also recently emerged in the Caribbean. Currently there are no drugs or vaccines available for treatment or prevention. The name \u201cChikungunya\u201d derives from a Makonde word meaning \u201cto become contorted,\u201d and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with joint pain (arthralgia). There are continuing efforts to develop a vaccine for Chikungunya, and currently a clinical trial of experimental vaccines to prevent infection with Chikungunya virus is ongoing.93\n\n\nMS\u2010based methods have been used to characterize the experimental Chikungunya (CHIKV) virus\u2010like particle (VLP) vaccine. In one of the studies, a RP\u2010HPLC method was developed to separate capsid, E1, and E2 proteins in CHIKV VLP vaccine with good resolution with the separated protein components verified by MALDI\u2010TOF MS. In the same study, the post\u2010translational modifications on the viral glycoproteins E1 and E2 were further identified by intact protein mass measurements with LC\u2010MS. The RP\u2010LC\u2010MS method was used, in addition to characterizing the PTMs, for monitoring both the product purity during process development and assessing product stability during formulation development.94 In another study a HILIC LC method with fluorescence MS detection was performed to characterize the N\u2010glycosylation patterns of CHIKV VLPs. The developed method was used to monitor glycosylation during CHIKV VLPs vaccine process development to ensure batch consistency.95\n\n\n\nNeisseria meningitides (meningococcus) is a gram\u2010negative bacterium and causes meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease such as meningococcemia; a life\u2010threatening sepsis. There are two types of FDA\u2010approved vaccines for protection against meningococcal disease; meningococcal conjugate vaccines (Menveo\u00ae and Menactra\u00ae are quadrivalent vaccines for serogroups A, C, W135, and Y) and serogroup B meningococcal vaccines (Bexsero\u00ae and Trumenba\u00ae). MS\u2010based approaches have been used to perform the physicochemical characterization for all of these vaccines.96 In one of the studies, researchers used LC\u2010MS to characterize glycosylated lysine residues in Menveo\u00ae.97 In another study a LC\u2010MS method was used to determine the relative reactivity of lysine residues in CRM197 to determine which of these amino acids were more susceptible to conjugation.98 LC\u2010MS was also used to quantify the Bexsero\u00ae vaccine which was the first vaccine developed by reverse vaccinology; a genome\u2010based approach to vaccine development.99 Tani et al. used a Hi3 label\u2010free LC\u2010MSE methodology to perform quantification of outer membrane vesicle proteins of the Bexsero\u00ae vaccine. The Hi3 approach uses the intensity of the MS signal response for the three most intense tryptic peptides to perform absolute quantitation.80 The three recombinant proteins in the Bexsero\u00ae vaccine are the active components and Hi3 label\u2010free LC\u2010MSE methodology was used to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize each of these three proteins. The Hi3 MS method was performed as an additional characterization in addition to the standard quality control testing for vaccine batch release.100\n\n\n\nTrumenba\u00ae is also a well\u2010characterized vaccine, composed of two factor H binding protein (fHbp) variants that were recombinantly expressed in E. coli as native lipoproteins: rLP2086\u2010A05 and rLP2086\u2010B01. Gas chromatography\u2010mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography\u2010mass spectrometry (LC/MS) were used to analyze the composition of fatty acids released from rLP2086\u2010A05 and rLP2086\u2010B01 and for complete characterization of the primary structure of both recombinant lipoproteins. The LC\u2010MS analysis was carried out using an Acquity UHPLC/UV system interfaced to an ultrahigh\u2010resolution electrospray ionization quadrupole time\u2010of\u2010flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics maXis).101\n\n\n\nHecolin\u00ae, Innovax was the first VLP\u2010based vaccine against hepatitis E virus (HEV) obtained from E. coli and was licensed by the FDA of China in 2011. This VLP vaccine consists of a truncated, recombinant HEV capsid protein (p239) expressed in E. coli that spontaneously forms a VLP particle of \u223c20\u201030 nm in diameter.102 Several analytical methods including LC\u2010MS peptide mapping were employed to examine the quality, size and stability of the p239 protein comprising this VLP vaccine. To ensure consistency in terms of size and quality, multiple batches of commercial scale p239 containing VLPs were characterized by Size Exclusion Chromatography and LC\u2010MS methods.103\n\n\n\nCervarix\u00ae, is a Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 vaccine licensed in 2009. HPV infection can cause the development of cervical cancer, which is the second most common cause of death in women worldwide from cancer.104 Although multiple types of HPVs can lead to cervical cancer in humans, types 16 and 18 are responsible for \u223c70% of cases.105 LC\u2010MS peptide mapping was performed to confirm the primary sequences of the recombinant L1 protein which is the major antigenic protein of the capsid of HPV types 16 and 18. A peptide sequence coverage of \u223c97% was observed for both HPV 16 and 18 VLPs. Additionally, one post\u2010translational modification, N\u2010terminal acetylation, was also identified in the LI viral proteins within the VLPs. The LC\u2010MS peptide mapping was used to verify the batch to batch consistency and identify post\u2010translational modifications that can occur during protein expression and purification.104, 106\n\n\nNo therapeutics or vaccines are currently approved for use in humans against Nipah virus (NiV), an emerging, highly pathogenic, zoonotic virus from the Paramyxoviridiae family. Soluble glycoprotein and virus vector platforms are being developed for protection against NiV but the sporadic nature of NiV outbreaks makes large scale Phase III clinical trials difficult to plan.107 In a very interesting recent application of MS in the field of vaccines, Vera\u2010Velasco et al not only quantified the viral F, G and M proteins present in the viral particles but also analyzed the cellular proteomic composition in the NiV vaccine candidate. Traditionally, viral particles have been described as pure entities carrying only viral\u2010derived proteins but the authors successfully analyzed the ratio between cellular and viral proteins in the NiV vaccine candidate using LC\u2010MS/MS.108\n\n\nWest Nile fever is a flavivirus that causes a viral infection typically spread by mosquitoes. To date, no vaccine is available to prevent the West Nile infection. Partially purified virus\u2010like particles were resolved by SDS\u2010PAGE, and the Coomassie blue\u2010stained band corresponding to Env protein was excised from the gel, destained, and analyzed by MS. Microcapillary LC\u2010MS was performed using a LCQ DECA ion\u2010trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan) to identify the presence of Env protein in virus\u2010like particles to help in developing a potential vaccine.109\n\n\nIn December 2015, China's Food and Drug Administration approved two inactivated EV\u2010A71 vaccines for preventing severe HFMD (hand, foot, and mouth disease). LC\u2010MS/MS peptide mapping and N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal sequencing was performed using a Q\u2010Exactive mass spectrometer. The molecular weights of VP0, VP1 and VP3 capsid proteins of EV71 VLPs, were determined using a MALDI\u2010TOF/TOF MS 4800 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA).110\n\n\nMS is a technique of choice for the identification and structural characterization of tremendously complex glycoproteins and is a routinely used tool during the early research and development of protein\u2010based molecules. Implementation of MS methods in chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) and quality control environments for vaccines has been of longstanding interest but has faced regulatory challenges. To the best of our knowledge, the authors are not aware of any LC\u2010MS\u2010based release method used for any vaccine product in the quality control/cGMP environment.\n\nThere is always some reluctance to implement new methods in the quality control/cGMP environment and, in the case of MS, there are multiple misconceptions regarding the technique. Although MS is not without limitations, some of the misconceptions relating to reproducibility and validation are overstated. To implement a method in the QC environment, the method has to be validated to demonstrate the method's accuracy, precision, intermediate precision, specificity, linearity, limit of detection, and limit of quantitation. Furthermore, appropriate system suitability controls or calibrators are part of the method to ensure repeatability. All of these parameters and controls ensure that during the performance of the assay, no variability between different instruments and operators arises. Unfortunately, some aspect of these validation activities are inherently challenging for a MS\u2010based method. Thus, the burden of proof lies with the vaccine developer to convince a regulator that the MS\u2010based method is a phase appropriate release test without regulatory guidelines applicable to this class of drugs. It is clear from the author's perspective that classical validation regulations as stated in the ICH guidelines are unsuitable for MS\u2010based methods. In the last decade, some of the conventional gel\u2010based or plate\u2010based release assays have been replaced by HPLC or capillary electrophoresis (CE) methods in the QC environment. These HPLC\u2010 or CE\u2010based assays are used to monitor aggregation, fragmentation, clipping, and for content determination. As the application of MS in the vaccine QC environment is an evolving story, the challenge of convincing regulators should be directed toward highlighting MS capabilities as has been shown in the multiple examples in this manuscript. For those working in this field, it will be important to present MS data testing multiple quality attributes of the sample in the same analytical run in combination with HPLC/CE methods or by performing MS analysis to validate simpler HP/UPLC assays used to assess batch to batch consistency. In this way, comparative data sets could demonstrate what the authors believe is the ultimate utility of MS\u2010based methods for QC release of vaccines. The main rational for the MS\u2010based methods in the QC/cGMP environment should not be to replace the existing methods. Rather, it should be a supplemental batch release test to ensure that the product is within specifications and without any unwarranted modifications. Using MS techniques will ensure improved quality and increased safety for clinical trial participants.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence suggests that the emergence of MS\u2010based techniques has advanced the field of vaccine development. LC coupled with MS represents a powerful characterization tool in vaccine development; especially for the recombinantly produced antigens. LC\u2010MS techniques are rapidly being used not only to quantitate vaccine antigens and explore molecular structure but also for the comprehensive analysis of glycans. An important question remains on how to establish the MS techniques in the quality control cGMP labs for vaccine release given the wide use of classical methods and lack of regulatory guidance. Nevertheless, after a decade of steady partnership with vaccine developers, MS has expanded from a niche application to an enabling platform for vaccine development."}
