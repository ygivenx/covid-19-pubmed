{"title": "Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation in nanomedicine: small light strides against bad bugs", "body": "influenza, tuberculosis and malaria, as well as the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus, means that infectious disease remains an important problem [2] . The real value of antibiotics goes beyond simply preventing death and illness due to infection, in that antibiotics also permit the serious iatrogenic assault on the immune system that occurs in cancer treatment or in organ transplantation, where they have helped to keep surgical complication rates down [3] . Therefore, antibiotics are an extremely valuable resource across the whole spectrum of modern medicine [4] . However, multidrug-resistant (MDR) and pandrug-resistant bacterial strains and the related infections they cause, have become emerging threats to public health throughout the world [5] . These infections are associated with an approximately twofold higher death rate, and with considerably prolonged hospital stays [6] . Infections caused by antibiotic resistant microbes are often exceptionally hard to treat due to the limited range of therapeutic options [7] . Therefore, there is an urgent need for an all-out search for alternative antimicrobial approaches to kill MDR strains, concentrating on methods that are unlikely to cause resistance to develop [8] [9] [10] . Recently, Bush et al. pointed out that novel nonantibiotic approaches to prevent and treat infectious disease should be considered high-priority international research and development goals [11] . A promising, innovative approach to achieve this goal is antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (aPDI).\n\nThe principles underlying aPDI or photodynamic therapy (PDT) are similar. Both techniques combine a nontoxic dye termed a photosensitizer (PS) and harmless low-intensity visible light of suitable wavelength to match the PS absorption peak. The mechanisms are graphically illustrated in Figure 1 . The PS initially absorbs light to form the short-lived first excited singlet state. The excited singlet PS can undergo intersystem crossing to form the much longer-lived excited triplet state that can survive long enough to carry out chemical reactions. The triplet PS can react in the presence of ambient molecular oxygen to produce two types of photochemical reactions (type I and type II) [12] . Type I photoprocesses involve hydrogen or electron-transfer reactions between the excited state PS and other molecules in the environment (frequently oxygen). These electron-transfer reactions produce (directly or indirectly) reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are harmful to cells, such as superoxide (O 2 \u2022\u2212 ), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), hydroxyl radicals (HO \u2022 ) and hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO \u2022 ). The type II photoprocess is an energy transfer mechanism involving electron spin exchange between the excited triplet state PS and ground state oxygen ( 3 O 2 ), itself a triplet. Triplet-triplet interactions are spin-allowed, but singlet-triplet interactions are spin-forbidden, so the fact that ground state oxygen happens to be a triplet is important in this regard. Type I and type II reactions both produce ROS that cause oxidation of biomolecules (lipids, proteins and nucleic acids) in the cell. In the case of microbial cells most of the damage is carried out at the cell wall, and cells are permeabilized so that essential components such as nucleic acids leak out. Figure 2 . Numerous studies have shown that there is a fundamental difference in susceptibility to antibacterial PDI between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria due to differences in the organization of the outer membrane structures [13] [14] [15] [16] .\n\nThe cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria is composed mainly of thick porous layers of peptidoglycan embedded with proteins and lipotechoic acid, which will allow PS to easily pass through [17] . Additionally the negatively charged lipotechoic acids on the outside contribute to binding of cationic agents [18, 19] . By contrast, the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria consists of a thin layer of peptidoglycan adjacent to the inner cytoplasmatic membrane as well as an outer membrane with phospholipids and negatively charged lipopolysaccarides that give Gram-negative species an even more pronounced negative charge than Gram-positive cells. This outer membrane provides an effective permeability barrier and limits the binding and penetration of anionic and lipophilic PS [19] . The effectiveness of aPDT against Gram-negative bacteria can be enhanced by combination with a permeabilizing agent (e.g., Tris-EDTA or polymyxin nonapeptide) to destabilize the lipopolysaccarides coating by removing the Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ion [17, 20, 21] .\n\nHowever, direct PDI of Gram-negative bacteria is also possible. There are now many different positively charged PS with structures belonging to several chemical classes, including phthalocyanines and porphyrins, that have been successfully tested as photosensitizers against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Tetrapyrrole photosensitizers with an overall cationic charge such as mesosubstituted cationic porphyrins and water-soluble cationic zinc phthalocyanines can efficiently kill Gram-negative bacteria by aPDT action even in the absence of permeabilizing agents.\n\nAt present, there is a consensus that aPDI can inactivate all known classes of microorganism, including Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses, etc., whether in vitro or in vivo [8, 9, 27] . Furthermore, aPDI is thought to be equally effective (or even more effective) against MDR species compared with naive species [28] . Moreover PDI treatment itself is unlikely to cause resistance, as damage by ROS is thought be via a nonspecific killing mechanisms compared with antibiotics that generally inhibit a specific enzyme [29, 30] . PDI does not lead to the selection of mutant resistant strains which is another advantage compared with standard antibiotics [31] .\n\nThere is some debate about whether the ROS that is generated outside the microbial cell can efficiently kill from the outside, or whether ROS that is generated inside the outer membrane is much more effective in killing. Both scenarios are almost certainly the case, and the construction and testing of photoactivated surfaces [32] , films [33] and solid supported photosensitizers [34] has provided new applications in environmental aPDI.\n\nThe American Society of Microbiology has decreed that in order for any technology to claim to be 'antimicrobial' it has to kill more that 3 logs of planktonic cells. In many cases 6 or more logs of killing may be achieved that is frequently equivalent to eradication (no CFU remaining). When microbial cells are growing in biofilms they are considerably more resistant to PDI compared with to planktonic cells. In the case of biofilm growing cells 1 or 2 logs of inactivation may be considered biologically significant.\n\nNanomedicine is defined as the medical application of nanotechnology for the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. It uses precisely engineered materials, known as nanoparticles, with dimensions generally in the 1-200-nm range. One of the most important functions of medical nanotechnology is as drug delivery vehicles that can improve drug availability at the target area to provide the maximum therapeutic benefit. Nanomaterials can improve the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs, prolong the circulation time in the bloodstream, minimize the enzymatic degradation of the drug, decrease undesirable side effects and increase bioavailability. In the last decade, PDT has also been combined with nanotechnology techniques, as the photochemical effectiveness can be greatly enhanced by the use of nanoparticles. There are many aspects of PDT which can be improved, such as light dosimetry, when the use of high fluence rates of the exciting light can cause oxygen depletion and photosensitizer photobleaching [35] , and optimization of the rate of production of singlet oxygen, when too little is inefficient and too much can result in normal tissue damage [36] . However, one of the most important problems to be overcome in PDT is optimizing drug delivery [37] . A key limitation in PDT is the poor water solubility of many PS, and their tendency to aggregate in the aqueous environment in physiological conditions. To improve PS delivery to the target tissue, it is possible to rationally design nanoagents as carriers and vehicles for drug delivery. Appropriately chosen nanoparticles can increase the solubility of hydrophobic PS, and additionally have the proper size to accumulate in the tumor via the enhanced permeability and retention effect caused by the immature tumor vaculature.\n\nDifferent approaches have been investigated to combine nanoparticles and PDI, for antimicrobial applications. One use of nanoparticles is to improve the binding and uptake of PS by the microbial cells; while another use is to improve the microbial photoinactivation kinetics [31] . There are two basically different ways to use nanoparticles in PS delivery: covalent conjugation where a chemical bond is used to attach the PS to a constituent of the nanostructure as shown in Figure 3 ; noncovalent encapsulation or incorporation in various nanocontainers ( Figure 4 ). PS can be modified by encapsulation in delivery agents such as liposomes [38] , micelles [39] [40] [41] [42] , gold nanoparticles [43, 44] , polymer nanoparticles [45] , ceramic-based nanoparticles [46] and carbon nanotubes [47] . Another possibility is to use nanodiamonds [48, 49] . These structures are commercially available carbon nanomaterials with a diamond structure (sp3 hybridization) and have good biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. They have the capability for controlled release of drugs, have a narrow particle size distribution, a high surface area to volume ratio and a high capacity for drug loading [48, 49] .\n\nPhotosensitizers can be modified by attaching them to dendrimers ( Figure 3A ). Dendrimers are highly complex molecules that are sequentially built up by a series of solution reactions. They possess a core, branches and end groups [51] , which can be conjugated or loaded with PS molecules. Dendrimers can be constructed with different sizes and lipophilicity in order to optimize the uptake by cells, and can be designed to carry a high drug payload [52] . Unlike conventional PS, dendrimer-PS conjugates demonstrate good ROS production even at extremely high concentrations as the individual PS molecules are kept apart from each other by the dendrimer framework so they cannot self-quench. Typical examples are ionic dendrimer PS conjugates where a core porphyrin or phthalocyanine has large dendritic wedges attached to the periphery, which sterically prevent aggregation of the central tetrapyrrole molecules [22] .\n\nFullerenes have a molecular diameter at the lower end of the nanoparticle scale (\u00d8 1 nm), but they have very high photostability and produce a combination of both singlet oxygen (type 2) and also type I reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide or hydroxyl radicals. Appropriately functionalized fullerenes (with multiple attached cationic groups) have been shown to have good selectivity for binding to microbial cells compared with mammalian cells and have been studied in antimicrobial applications [30] . Rose Bengal is one of the most frequently used PS due to its ready availability, high water solubility, high singlet oxygen quantum yield and low rate of photodegradation [53] , and has been attached to silica nanoparticles to inactivate Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [54] . Related studies on methylene blue (a phenothiazinium dye) loaded nanoparticles have also been reported [55, 56] .\n\nPhotocatalysis is the acceleration of a light-mediated reaction in the presence of a catalyst (usually an inorganic semiconductor) [57] . Over the last 30 years there has been an increasing interest in the use of titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) as a photocatalyst due to its highly efficient photocatalytic properties that allow destruction of organic polluting chemicals and also the killing of pathogenic microbes [58] . The advantage of photocatalysis is having sunlight or UV radiation to trigger the disinfection process using a catalyst (TiO 2 ) [23] .\n\nTiO 2 is a wide band-gap, n-type semiconductor, with the characteristics of low toxicity, strong optical absorption, low cost and high chemical stability. It has been used in photovoltaic, photodegradation, photocatalysis, electrochromic devices and so on. When TiO 2 nanoparticles are excited by UV light (\u03bb <385 nm), photo-induced electrons and photogenerated charged holes are created (see Figure 5 for a schematic explanation). These electron-hole pairs are generated when TiO 2 absorbs the energy of the photons with sufficient energy (3.2 eV) (hv) to the band gap [24] . The energy difference between the valence band (e vb \u2212 ) and the conduction band (e cb \u2212 ) is known as the band gap.\n\nThe absorption of energy and the subsequent generation of the electron-hole pair are given by the following equation:\n\nwhere e\u2212 is the conduction band electron and h+ is the valence band hole. The reaction of the hole with surrounding water molecules and hydroxide ions produces the reactive hydroxyl radicals [25, 59] .\n\nThe fullerene molecule has a unique structure entirely composed of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a soccer ball structure [98] . It was originally named as 'Buckminsterfullerene,' after the architect R Buckminster Fuller due to its structural similarity to his geodesic dome constructions [99] . Fullerenes and their derivatives have been a magnet for both scientific and industrial attention because of their ability to act as lubricants, their simple fabrication process and the prospect for low-cost production in a large-scale manufacturing process. They are widely accepted nanoparticles, and have been increasingly used in the field of nanotechnology especially in biomedical applications [100] [101] [102] . Their most important medical application is the light-based therapy PDT [103] . Fullerenes have certain particular advantages over more traditional PS based on tetrapyrrole and phenothiazinium backbones [104] . Fullerenes (and in particular soluble functionalized fullerenes) are able to act as PS in PDT/PDI, as the triplet state of the fullerene molecule has a very high triplet yield and a long triplet lifetime that can interact with molecular oxygen [105] . Their disadvantages lies in their absorption spectrum, which is inclined toward the blue and green visible wavelengths rather than the red/far red wavelengths that have good tissue penetration. Second, pristine fullerenes are difficult to be made water-soluble and have a marked tendency to aggregate. However, functionalized fullerenes can be made water soluble and are effective as antimicrobial PS in the treatment of relatively superficial infections (for instance, in wounds and burns), where the penetration depth of the light does not need to exceed more than 1.0 mm.\n\nRecently, these functionalized fullerenes have been studied for their biological activities to mediate PDI in combating invasive microbial infections [30] . The chemical structures of the fullerenes discussed here are given in Figure 6 . Previous work from our lab, has shown that the presence of one or more cationic charges can greatly increase the binding to the negatively charged microbial membranes, while the hydrophobic character then increases the penetration into the lipid components of the membrane [26, 106] . A C60 fullerene functionalized with three dimethylpyrrolidinium groups (BF6) was found to be a highly active broad-spectrum antimicrobial photosensitizer able to kill Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and fungal yeast cells in vitro when combined with white-light illumination (4-6 logs) [106] . The performance of this compound was better than a widely used antimicrobial PS, toluidine Blue O.\n\nLu et al. were the first to report that mouse models of wounds infected with potentially lethal bacteria Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa could be cured of a fatal bacterial infection by aPDT mediated by BF6 and white light ( Figure 6A ) [107] . A synergistic effect of antimicrobial PDT with traditional antibiotics was also reported for the first time [107] . Mizuno et al. showed that fullerenes that carry more cationic groups are more effective broad-spectrum antimicrobial PS [103] , and showed the most effective compounds had more cationic charges and a lower logP value [30] . These workers also compared a new group of synthetic fullerene derivatives that possessed either basic amino groups or quaternary ammonium groups as antimicrobial PS against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) and fungi (Candida albicans). The nonquaternary amino groups tended to form nanoaggregates in water and were only effective against Gram-positive S. aureus. An increase in the number of quaternary cationic groups tended to minimize aggregation, and a compound with six quaternary N-atoms was found to be most effective compound giving up to 6 logs of killing. S. aureus was most susceptible; E. coli was intermediate, while C. albicans was the most resistant species tested [103] .\n\nHuang et al. [108] investigated water soluble decacationic fullerene monoadducts, Figure   6C ). In Gram-positive bacteria 1 O 2 can diffuse more easily into porous cell walls whereas in Gram-negative bacteria the cell wall is less permeable so the more reactive HO \u2022 is required to cause real damage and bacterial killing [108] .\n\nWang et al. reported a unique class of water-soluble fullerene adducts, decacationic methano [95] fullerene decaiodides C60[>M(C 3 N 6 10 ]. These compounds when excited with both UVA light and white light was capable of generating 1 O 2 (type-II) and also highly reactive hydroxyl radicals formed from superoxide, via a type-I photochemical reaction [109, 110] . The ten quaternary ammonium cationic charges per C60 cage was designed to boost the ability of the fullerene to target Gram-positive (>6 logs of killing) and Gram-negative bacteria (2.5 logs of killing) using white light [109] .\n\nA recent study, used a [C60]-fullerene and its derivative that were immobilized onto a polymer support, macroporous silicone (dimethylsiloxane), to carry out inactivation of waterborne bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis) [111] . Favorable absorption of visible light, and high ROS quantum yields of silicone-embedded C60-fullerene were noted, but it was still found to be inferior in photodynamic water disinfection compared with Ru(II) polypyridyls immobilized onto the same support [111] . The light-mediated antimicrobial activities of fullerene C60 and its derivatives were studied by Aoshima et al. against both bacteria and fungi [112] . They used water-soluble fullerenes encapsulated into carriers (polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/C60, gammacyclodextrin (gamma-CD)/C 60 , and nano-C 60 ) and 3 types of fullerenols (C 60 (OH) 12 , C 60 (OH) 36 Additionally, the study found that the activity of fullerenols against fungi was stronger than against bacteria. This finding was explained by the authors who pointed out the fact that fullerenols are more water soluble and could interact more with components such as \u03b2-glucan and chitin in fungus cell-wall than with peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell membrane [112] .\n\nIn 1991 the Japanese scientist, Sumio Iijima first reported the discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a by-product of fullerene synthesis [113] . Remarkable progress has been made since, including the discovery of two basic types of nanotubes: multiwalled, referred to as (MWNT and MWCNT) and single-walled, referred to as (SWNT and SWCNT) ( Figure 7 ) [114] . CNTs have a high aspect ratio (length to diameter) and a large surface area relative to their molecular weight, have been suggested as potential candidates for industrial use in areas such as hydrogen storage [115] and agents to remove contaminants from water and air [116] . The excellent mechanical properties of CNT are due to the strength of the sp 2 carboncarbon bonds. CNTs cluster naturally into nanoropes held together by weak van der Waals forces. Depending on their fine structure CNT can behave as 1D quantum wires composed entirely of carbon (metallic form) or as semiconductors. The walls of the SWCNT are one atom thick and tens of atoms in circumference. Every carbon atom composes the surface of the nanotube and contributes to covalent bonds. SWNTs are typically about 1 nm in diameter but could be hundreds of nanometer to several centimeter long. These properties, coupled with the lightness give CNT their great potential in many biological applications [114] . MWNTs are also potent antiviral agents.\n\nUsing layer-by-layer assembly, Nepal et al. created SWNTs coated with the antimicrobial molecule, lysozyme [117] , which has strong antibacterial properties against Gram-positive bacteria. The study showed that a coating of lysozyme on SWNTs had significant effects against Micrococcus lysodeikticus and S. aureus [118] . Porphyrin-conjugated MWNTs excited by visible light were found to significantly reduce the ability of influenza A virus to infect mammalian cells. This finding could lead to development of other MWNTs for antiviral therapeutics [119] . A novel report in 2013 showed that MWCNT arrays could be used for deposition of TiO 2 nanoparticles resulting in removal of the pathogen, enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 (EHEC) (see Figure 8 ) [120] . The vertical array of MWCNT acted as a filter for bacterial retention, while TiO 2 acted as an efficient bactericidal photocatalyst. The deadly EHEC was filtered through TiO 2 /MWCNT coated porous ceramic filter and bacterial removal was found to be significantly lower. The authors hypothesized that the photo-generated electrons in MWCNT might react with the dissolved oxygen molecules, thus producing superoxide radicals O 2 \u2022\u2212 . Holes generated in TiO 2 nanoparticles may react with the OH \u2212 which is obtained from water molecules to form hydroxyl radicals OH \u2022 . E. coli O157:H7 can then be photocatalytically killed by both O 2 \u2022\u2212 and HO \u2022 (Figure 8) using UVA light. Dinu et al. combined peracetic acid (PAA) with MWNT to produce bioactive composites that acted as a potent oxidizing agent that could be used for disinfection, with broad effectiveness against bacteria, yeasts, fungi and spores. They were able to successfully kill more than 99% of spores initially present at 10 6 CFU/ml [121] .\n\nGraphene is a 2D sheet of sp2 and sp3 hybridized carbon atoms. It is the simplest of the carbon nanostructures having structural features in common with fullerenes (3D closed cage), carbon nanotubes (3D rolled tube) and graphite (3D stack of sheets). Graphene has a single atom thin, 2D honeycomb lattice and the carbon atoms also include carboxyl, hydroxyl and epoxide functional groups [122] . Graphene oxide (GO), a water-soluble derivative, has excellent biocompatibility, stability in aqueous medium, large specific surface area that can be loaded with huge quantities of hydrophobic drugs such as doxorubicin. It has attracted great interest from scientists [123, 124] due to its abilities to solubilize hydrophobic molecules between the sheets due to \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking ( Figure 9A ). Graphene and graphene oxide sheets can also be used to solubilize hydrophobic PS such as 2-(1-hexyloxyethyl)-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide-alpha (HPPH or Photochlor \u00ae ; Figure 9B ) [125] , hypocrellin A ( Figure 9C ) [126] and methylene blue ( Figure 9D ) [127] . In a recent study, electrochemically produced graphene quantum dots (GQD), when photoexcited with a green laser (470 nm, 1 W), were found to generate ROS and kill two strains of bacteria, MRSA and E. coli but were ineffective in killing mouse spleen cells demonstrating a legitimately selective antibacterial photodynamic action of GQD [128] . Another group [129] suggested the application of GQD combined with low levels of H 2 O 2 to produce 'antibacterial band aids' for wound disinfection. The peroxidase-like activity of the GQD produced HO \u2022 from H 2 O 2 , and the effectiveness of the bandage was demonstrated in wound infections in mice.\n\nLiposomes are spherical nanosized vesicles made from a self-assemble lipid bilayer formed from natural phospholipids and cholesterol. Since the discovery of liposomes in 1961 by Alec D Bangham, they have become a very useful tool in biology, biochemistry and medicine [130, 131] . Liposomes are the most extensively studied colloidal carrier system, that can be loaded with substances such as drugs and PS with the goal to solubilize, deliver and transport them to a specific target, thus preventing the drug from degradation as well as limiting adverse effects from nontargeted drug [131] . Liposomes are primarily made of one or more concentric phospholipid bilayers each unit of which consists of an inner hydrophilic head and outer hydrophilic tail. The hydrophobic center of these bilayers can accommodate hydrophobic drugs or PS, while the hydrophilic central region or core can accommodate water-soluble drugs or PS [132, 133] . PS can therefore be encapsulated into liposomes depending on the lipophilicity and water solubility of the PS itself ( Figure 3D & 4D) . After the PS is packed in the liposome there are two mechanisms of uptake by the cells: either the liposomes undergo fusion with the cell membrane and release the contents into the cytosol, or phagocytic cells can engulf these liposomes and disintegrate them inside the endosomes or lysosomes, thereby releasing the active drug into the cell [134] . Studies have suggested that PS administered using liposomes can substantially improve the efficacy and safety of PDT/PDI. The efficacy of antimicrobial PDI can also be increased by loading the PS into biocompatible liposomes [135] [136] [137] [138] .\n\nLiposomes formed from N-(1-[2,3-dioleoyloxy] propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride were used as carriers loaded with a positively charged meso-substituted porphyrin, namely 5-(4-[1-dodecanoylpyridinium])-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin ( Figure 10A ). The liposomal carrier disorganized the native structure of the bacterial cell wall, and enhanced the ability of the PS to pass through, leading to a deeper penetration of the drug into the plasma membrane, and to more cell death (up to 6 logs) on white light illumination [139] .\n\nBombelli et al. improved the antibacterial activity of the PS m-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin (temoporfin, Figure 10B ), by encapsulating it in a cationic liposome preparation composed of different ratios of dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) combined with any of four cationic surfactants (CS): (1S,2S)-N-hexadecyl-N-methylprolinolinium bromide, (1R,2S)-N-hexadecyl-Nmethylprolinolinium bromide, N-hexadecyl-Lprolinoliniumhydrobromide and 3-N,N-dihexadecyl-l-prolinoliniumbromide. This cationic liposomal-delivered temoporfin preparation was evaluated against MRSA, and one of these formulations had the same bactericidal activity as free temoporfin [140] .\n\nAlthough cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) demonstrates strong intrinsic antimicrobial activity due to its amphiphilic properties, CTAB also exhibits high affinity toward biological membranes of host cells, rendering it unsuitable for direct use as an antimicrobial [141] . Recently, Yang et al. incorporated CTAB into the lipid bilayer of dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) liposomes into which chlorin(e6) (Ce6; Figure 10C ) was also encapsulated. They tested the in vitro PDI efficacy of this preparation against susceptible and drug-resistant clinical isolates of C. albicans as well as in infected burn wounds [142] . This liposomal formulation showed enhanced PDI efficacy against both susceptible and clinical drug-resistant strains of C. albicans demonstrating that microbial outer-wall disruption can be accomplished by using positively-charged liposomes encapsulating hydrophobic photosensitizers [142] . The main disadvantage of these cationic liposomes could be that in infected tissue the PS is delivered not only to the bacterial cell wall but also to the surrounding cells. Cationic liposomes easily fuse with host cells as the mammalian cell membrane is negatively charged, and there could be side effects with light [142] . To overcome this disadvantage of cationic liposomes, Yang et al. conjugated a novel antimicrobial peptide (WLBU2) to the surface of potent second-generation PS, temoporfinloaded liposomes [143] . Subsequently, the WLBU2-modified liposomes photo-eradicated all MRSA and induced a greater than 3 log(10) reduction of P. aeruginosa in vitro confirming enhanced temoporfin delivery to bacteria [143] .\n\nOne of the major issues with PDT is the limited tissue penetration of external light delivered from conventional light sources [144] . Because of this aPDT is considered to be restricted to superficial infections and has very limited use against deep infections. Previous studies have shown that cancer cells could be destroyed using intracellular chemiluminescence as the light source to excite a PS [145, 146] . On the basis of these studies, Nakonechny et al., exploited light emitted as a result of the internal chemiluminescent reaction of luminol to excite the PS and named the process 'chemiluminescent photodynamic antimicrobial therapy' (CPAT) [147] . The antibacterial effect of free and liposome-encapsulated PS (methylene blue or toluidine blue) excited by both white external light and by chemiluminescence mediated by free or liposome-enclosed luminol was studied. The efficacy of PDI using external light showed slightly higher killing than liposome-enclosed luminol and both free and encapsulated PS against both types of bacteria. However, CPAT showed a higher efficacy in killing and inhibiting the growth of both Gram-positive (S. aureus 3 log) and Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli 2 log) [147] . CPAT allows PDI in the absence of a conventional light source to activate the PS, and may be effective for deep infections that are difficult to treat using traditional PDI.\n\nPolymeric nanoparticles possess advantages compared with other nanodelivery vehicles. The drug is entrapped, encapsulated or attached to a nanoparticle matrix and depending upon the method of preparation, nanoparticles, nanospheres or nanocapsules can be obtained. Nanocapsules are containers in which the drug is contained in a cavity surrounded by a polymer membrane, while nanospheres are matrix systems with the drug uniformly dispersed throughout the nanoparticle [50] . Biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles have been used as drug delivery vehicles for controlled release of many drugs. They are also able to target particular organs/tissues as carriers of DNA in gene therapy, and to deliver proteins, peptides and genes through oral administration because they protect their cargo from degradation in the stomach [148, 149] .\n\nHypericin (HY; Figure 10D ) is a naturally-occurring compound isolated from St Johns Wort that acts as a potent photosensitizer [150] . However its lipophilicity and its tendency to aggregate in an aqueous environment limits its therapeutic applications. Nafee et al. developed a biodegradable nanocarrier for hypericin that allowed it to function as an antibacterial photosensitizer [151] . Hypericin-loaded nanoparticles (HY-NPs) were prepared from amphiphilic block copolymers. The antimicrobial photoactivity of HY-NPs was tested in vitro against MRSA clinical isolates as both planktonic and biofilm-embedded cells, and in vivo against infected wounds in rats. Light-activated HY-NPs demonstrated better inhibition of biofilm cells compared with planktonic cells. In vivo wound healing studies in rats revealed better epithelialization and quicker wound healing, accompanied by increased keratinization and growth of collagen fibers when light-activated HY-NPs were used.\n\nAntibacterial nanoparticles to improve root canal disinfection have also been investigated. A study by Pagonis et al. examined the in vitro effects of a biodegradable preparation of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles loaded with the PS methylene blue (MB, Figure  10E ) using PDI to kill E. faecalis [152] . Methylene blue (MB) (a well-established photosensitizer) was used to kill various Gram-positive and Gram-negative oral bacteria [153] . The interaction of light activated PDI and MB-loaded nanoparticles led to approximately 2 log10 reduction of CFU in planktonic cells, and a 1 log10 reduction in CFU in root canal biofilms.\n\nChitosan (CS; Figure 11A ) is a polycationic polymer composed of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and b-1,4-linked D-glucosamine. It is derived by partial deacetylation of chitin, the structural material of arthropod shells. The polycationic nature of CS interferes with the negatively charged residues of macromolecules at the microbial cell surface, which explains its ability to potentiate PDI using many different PS [154, 155] . Due to its safety combined with excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, CS has been extensively explored for medical applications in wound healing [156, 157] , tissue engineering [158] and drug delivery [159] . CS has a pKa value of approximately 6.3 [160] . Therefore at low pH values, CS is cationic due to the protonation of the amino groups. CS nanoparticles can be readily prepared by ionic gelation, a process involving cross-linking of the cationic CS with inorganic polyanions, such as sodium tripolyphosphate. The formulation of these nanoparticles occurs spontaneously upon addition of the counter-anion sodium tripolyphosphate into a CS solution without heat or organic solvents [161] .\n\nRose Bengal ( Figure 10F ) delivered by functionalized bioactive polymeric chitosan nanoparticles, CSRBnp were shown to produce antibiofilm effects. Photoactivated CSRBnp resulted in reduced viability of E. faecalis biofilms and disruption of biofilm structure, leading to efficient elimination of bacterial-biofilms and stabilization of dentin-matrix [162] . CSRBnp also showed significant antibacterial efficacy and completely eliminated the bacteria after 24 h of interaction after photodynamic therapy, even in the presence of tissue components, such as dentin, dentin-matrix, pulp tissue, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and protein (bovine serum albumin) that are present within root canals [162] . Polycationic chitosan-conjugated RB demonstrated photoinactivation of biofilms of E. faecalis (Grampositive) and P. aeruginosa (Gram-negative), resulting in significantly higher elimination than RB and MB excited in the free form [163] . Erythrosine (ER) combined with CS nanoparticles and exposed to light showed significant phototoxicity to the planktonic cells and biofilms of Streptococcus mutans, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. The antimicrobial activity of ER/CS nanoparticles was again significantly higher than that of ER in the free form [164] . Chitosan nanoparticles loaded with methylene blue also showed a large synergistic potentiation of photodynamic antimicrobial activity against Helicobacter pylori in vitro [165] . Only 1 log was killed by MB-PDI while 7 logs were killed by the combination of MB-chitosan and endoscopic white light.\n\nCellulose ( Figure 11B ) is a natural biopolymer and one of the most naturally abundant biomaterials on the planet. It possesses a high molecular weight, and its structural motif consists of a number of (\u03b2-1,4-linked anhydro-D-glucose) polymer chains. It is considered to be an outstanding material for developing promising new biomaterials from renewable plant resources [166] . Cellulose has a very regular structure composed of crystalline units or nanodomains. On acidic hydrolysis bulk cellulose produces highly crystalline rod-shaped cellulose nanocrystals (100-400 nm in length) with high mechanical strength and is easily able to be chemically modified due to the hydroxyl groups [167] [168] [169] .\n\nCellulose nanocrystals (CNC) are very attractive starting materials to produce high melting point composites, thermal extrusions and heat-resistant materials [170] . CNC can be used as scaffolds for fabricating nanomaterials because of their unique chemical and physical characteristics that allows formation of rigid molecular rods with well-controlled dimensions, enantiopurity and the presence of primary hydroxyl groups at the C6 position for chemical modification. CNC provided a novel starting material for the preparation of a unique photobactericidal material [171, 172] . CNC-Por(1) is a photobactericidal material formed by the covalent attachment of an alkyne-containing porphyrin PS ( Figure 10G ) to the surface of azide-modified cellulose nanocrystals using the Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen-Meldal-Sharpless 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction (better known as Click Chemistry) [173] . Studies showed that CNC-Por(1) could mediate PDI of both methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and M. smegmatis (as a substitute for M. tuberculosis), however, the bactericidal activity was very low in case of E. coli [173, 174] . Another study by the same group tested CNC-Por(1) against Acinetobacter baumannii, multiple-drug resistant A. baumannii (MDRAB), MRSA and P. aeruginosa. They concluded that (regardless of the material being an insoluble suspension) CNC-Por(1) had a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. Upon illumination with visible light (400-700 nm; 118 J/cm 2 ) excellent antimicrobial activity against A. baumannii, MSSA and MRSA was observed, with a 5-6 log units reduction in CFUs [174] . However, P. aeruginosa was only moderately photoinactivated by CNC-Por(1) with 2-3 log CFU reduction [174] .\n\nThe biocompatibility of Au nanoparticles has encouraged their extensive utilization in many different organisms [175, 176] . Gold nanoparticles (Au) are generally considered to be biologically inert, but they absorb light that can produce a significant photothermal effect. Gold nanoparticles can be used as drug delivery platforms, similar to other inorganic nanoparticles or as surface plasmon-enhanced agents taking account of the nonlinear optical fields that come into effect at very close distances to metal nanoparticles. Both these types of application have been employed in photodynamic therapy, showed in Figure 12 . [124] .\n\nAu-based nanomaterials such as Au nanospheres, Au nanocages and Au nanorods with characteristic near-infrared absorption can produce photothermal destruction of bacteria. Au nanorods conjugated with PS can kill MRSA by a combination of PACT and photothermal effect [177, 178] . S. aureus can be killed using laser activation of Au nanoparticles conjugated with specific antibodies [179] via a photothermal effect killing pathogens [180] [181] [182] . Gold nanoparticles have been shown to have intrinsic antibacterial activity against MRS, VRE, E. coli, P. aeruginosa [183] [184] [185] .\n\nKuo et al. conjugated the hydrophilic PS, toluidine blue O (TBO; Figure 10H ), to the surface of Au nanorods for PACT and found that this conjugated Au-PAA-TBO nanorods acted as dual-function agents producing both PDI and hyperthermia against MRSA, acting simultaneously as photodynamic and photothermal agents to kill MRSA [177] . The concanavalin A-induced clustering of dextran-coated Au nanoparticles suggested that Dex-Au-NP could sense the presence of complex carbohydrates on bacterial cells suspensions, and could provide a nanoparticle-based antimicrobial antibiotic susceptibility assay. This would take advantage of differential changes in the surface plasmon resonance band of Dex-Au-NP. This method would be much quicker in comparison to traditional culture methods [186] .\n\nCombining antibiotics with Au nanoparticles can increase the efficacy of the antibacterial activity [187] . Au-NP coated with vancomycin increased antimicrobial activity against vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE) [185] [186] [187] [188] . Coating Cefaclor (a second-generation \u03b2-lactam antibiotic) [189] and ampicillin(C-AuNp-Amp) [190] onto Au nanoparticles increased antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli). Au nanoparticles also enhanced methylene blue-induced PDI against C. albicans biofilms [191] . Au nanoparticles have also been shown to have anti-HIV activity and can inhibit several strains of influenza virus by blocking viral attachment to the cell surface [192, 193] .\n\nSilver has long been known to be antimicrobial due to the high affinity of Ag toward the sulfur and phosphorus atoms in biomolecules [194] . Ag nanoparticles can react with sulfur containing amino acids in the cell membrane that will affect cell viability, and can also react with sulfur containing moieties inhibiting enzyme function involved in DNA replication [195] [196] [197] causing cell death [198] . Ag nanoparticles have a dose [199] [200] [201] , particle size [198, 202, 203] , total surface area [204] [205] [206] and shape dependent effect on both Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria [207] . The antimicrobial effect of silver is dependent on superficial contact [208] . The higher antimicrobial effect of Ag nanoparticles at lower concentrations than Au or zinc nanoparticles against S. mutans suggested that clinical effects might be achieved with reduced toxicity [209] . Another study investigated the antimicrobial activity of Ag, TiO 2 and silica nanoparticles against S. mutans as compared with chlorhexidine, a routine disinfectant and found that Ag NPs performed better than chlorhexidine [210] .\n\nAg nanoparticles also have an effect on the cell morphology of E. coli and S. aureus [211, 212] . The biocidal property is mainly due to Ag ions released from Ag nanoparticles and to a coating of silver oxide on these nanoparticles [202] . The composite Ag nanoparticles formed with polymers could increase the antimicrobial effect of Ag nanoparticles alone [213] [214] [215] . The nano-Ag had antibacterial action against E. coli [216] and involved alterations of the expression of a number of envelope proteins (OmpA, OmpC, OmpF, OppA and MetQ) and heat shock proteins (IbpA and IbpB) [217, 218] . Moreover nano-Ag was more efficient than Ag salts alone as an antimicrobial agent against Vibrio cholerae [201] .\n\nAntimicrobial activity was studied using size-controlled Ag colloid nanoparticles generated by a one-step modified Tollens process against drug resistant pathogens [203] . It was found that nanoparticles with a size less than 25 nm showed minimum inhibitory concentration of 6.75-54 \u00b5g/ml and >25 nm sized nanoparticles showed minimum inhibitory concentration in the range of 1.69-13.5 \u00b5g/ml against highly MDR bacteria such as MRSA, methicillinresistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (S. epidermidis), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and ESBL-positive K. pneumoniae. Ag nanoparticles had the highest activity against MRSA followed by MRSE and Streptococcus pyogenes and moderate antimicrobial activity against Salmonella typhi and K. pneumoniae [219] .\n\nBrown et al. suggested that when ampicillin was bound to the surfaces of Ag NP and AuNP, their intrinsic antibacterial activity could be significantly increased. Both AuNP and AgNP when functionalized with ampicillin became potent antibacterial agents and could overcome antibiotic resistance mechanisms of MDR bacteria, and could kill pathogenic E. coli, V. cholerae, Enterobacter aerogenes, MRSA and P. aeruginosa [220] .\n\nAg nanoparticles inhibited HIV-1, Influenza virus, Herpes Simplex virus, Respiratory syncytial virus and Monkey pox virus by blocking the viral attachment to the cell surface [193, [221] [222] [223] [224] . Ag-nanoparticles also have fungicidal and fungistatic effects on the dermatophytes Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Candida species by disrupting the cell membrane [225] [226] [227] .\n\nSilica (SiO 2 ) is a mineral that is a major component of sand and glass, and has also been used in the synthesis of nanoparticles. Many different functional groups can be added to the surface of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs). These SiNPs serve as a potential carrier for PDT/PDI applications [228] . SiNPs can be prepared with well-controlled particle size, shape, porosity and monodisperse distribution. Moreover, numerous different PS can be encapsulated, SiNPs are not subject to microbial attack, are stable to changes in pH, and there occurs no swelling or change in porosity in biological environments. Due to the permeability of the porous matrix to molecular oxygen, singlet oxygen that is generated inside can come out, so the photodestructive effect can be maintained in encapsulated form [124] . Various preparation methods have been reported such as organically modified silicates (ORMOSIL), hollow silica, mesoporous SiNPs (MSN), the St\u00f6ber procedure to generate amorphous SiNPs of a controlled size, the reverse microemulsion (water-in-oil) method, and recently a direct microemulsion (oil-in-water) procedure and the sol-gel method have all been used to prepare nanoparticles for PDT [229] [230] [231] . As mentioned above most PS are poorly soluble and easily form nonphotoactive aggregates, so there is a need for effective drug-delivery vehicles [110] . Nanoparticle-based PS have an advantage over free PS molecules, as NP encapsulation makes the dyes more resistant toward photobleaching, and the concentrated but not quenched PS molecules present on the nanoparticle surface enables a higher concentration of locally generated singlet oxygen to cause more damage to the target bacteria [54] . Immobilization of the PS inside or on the surface of the SiNPs can be accomplished by noncovalent encapsulation (most frequently described) and by covalent conjugation (more efficient) [230] . This immobilization or encapsulation will protect the PS from degradation, and the encapsulated form will have superior photostability, higher yield of ROS generation, increased photodynamic efficacy and better aqueous solubility than the free form [124] .\n\nGuo et al. developed a nanoparticle-based PS, consisting of Rose Bengal (RB)-decorated silica (SiO 2 -NH 2 -RB) nanoparticles, to inactivate both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (particularly MRSA and S. epidermidis) with high efficiency [54] . Another study described quaternary ammonium (QA)-functionalized SiNP that could release NO when excited with light of the correct wavelength, and which exhibited antimicrobial action against both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Nanoparticles with only NO release capabilities were more effective against P. aeruginosa, while particles with only QA-functionality exhibited greater activity toward S. aureus and there was an increased bactericidal efficacy against S. aureus by combining NO release and QA-functionality on the same particle but no change in activity was seen against P. aeruginosa. Moreover the hybrid NO release/QAfunctionalized particles were more effective than mixtures of NO-releasing and QAfunctionalized particles separately [232] .\n\nMRI is a noninvasive imaging technique that can be used to explore cell trafficking, gene expression and detect cancer. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have been extensively used as MRI contrast agents and show a unique ability to enhance the MR contrast signal [233] . Moreover, it is possible to use an external magnetic field to control the kinetics and biodistribution of MNPs. Magnetic targeting is an encouraging tool for the site-specific delivery of drugs using a field applied outside the body [234] . Figure 13 shows the structure of MNP with biocompatible coating and PS attached by a linker [124] .\n\nThese MNP possess a high value of saturation magnetization and superparamagnetism. Additionally, functional MNP can easily be separated from the solvent mixture and purified by applying a magnetic field [235] . In a recent study by Choi et al., multifunctional MNPs were conjugated with PS and with vancomycin using a fabrication method involving surface modification of Fe 3 O 4 particles [235] . To allow separation of the captured bacteria from the contaminated sites the MNPs consisted of Fe 3 O 4 particles conjugated with a PS, [5,15- bisphenyl-10,20-bis(4-methoxycarbonylphenyl)-porphyrin]-platinum (t-PtCP; Figure 10I ), and after PDI there could be complete removal of the PS using a magnet. To deliver the MNPs specifically to the bacterial cell membrane they were also functionalized with vancomycin used here as a targeting molecule, not as an antibiotic. The study concluded that MMPs had good biocompatibility, and when excited with 510 nm light they could target, capture and photoinactivate numerous pathogenic bacteria including MRSA and VRE.\n\nMany of the most powerful PS are optimally excited with UV or short wavelength (blue) visible light but these wavelengths possess inadequate tissue penetration ability [236, 237] . Upconversion (UC) is a nonlinear optical process that leads to the emission of light at a shorter wavelength than the excitation wavelength (anti-Stokes type emission) following successive absorption of two or more photons [124, 238] . Upconversion can be efficiently excited at low peak power densities, contrary to other nonlinear processes based on multiphoton absorption that require peak power densities of the order of 10 10 W/cm 2 .\n\nHighly efficient UC nanocrystals are formed from rare earth metal salts and have controlled properties of solubility, particle size, crystallographic phase, optical properties and shape. Nanocrystals are doped with lanthanide ions in the form of solid-state materials and are considered as most efficient for UC [124] . Recent studies have proposed that UC nanoparticles could be alternatives to conventional agents such as organic fluorophosphors and quantum dots in the field of medical optical imaging [238] . Lim et al. [236] used nearinfrared-to-visible UC nanoparticles ( Figure 14) consisting of sodium yttrium fluoride (NaYF 4 ) co-doped with ytterbium (Yb 3+ ) and erbium (Er 3+ ) ions contained inside a PEI shell that was embedded with the PS zinc phthalocyanine to demonstrate UC-based PDI as a prospective antiviral therapy. When excited with 980 nm light the UCN acted as nanotransducers to produce visible light to excite the PS zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPC; Figure  10J ) and to produce 1 O 2 . The UCN were effective in reducing titers of both dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) and adenovirus type 5 (Ad5V). The viruses were propagated on C6/36 cells and HeLa cells, respectively, that allowed plaque-forming units to be assayed. When light treated DENV2 virus suspension was inoculated into mice it caused no disease [236] .\n\nThe relatively young field of nanotechnology was only invented in 1959 when US physicist Richard P Feynman gave a speech at an American Physical Society meeting at the California Institute of Technology, entitled \"There's plenty of room at the bottom\" [239] . This relatively late beginning can be contrasted with the field of photodynamic therapy that was invented over 110 years ago in 1900 when Oscar Raab [240] discovered that certain microorganisms could be killed by particular combinations of dyes and light. Nevertheless the progress made by these two complimentary (if not outright synergistic) technologies has been nothing short of astonishing. As both PDI [241] and nanomedicine [242] progress steadily toward more approved clinical indications, it seems high time that these fields should 'get together.' The very real improvements in photosensitizer solubility, photophysics and photochemistry that may be achieved by a judicious choice of a nanoparticle delivery vehicle, will continue to be investigated for ever more broad indications. What promises to be even more exciting, are those applications where the nanomaterial itself takes part in the optics, physics and chemistry of the photodynamic process. Titania photocatalysis with its almost infinite photostability, has the promise to allow the manufacture of a range of self-sterilizing surfaces and tools for biomedical applications. However self-sterilizing surfaces are still so new that their eventual utility and optimal design features are still uncertain. The carbon nanomaterials (fullerenes, nanotubes and graphene) are being discovered to be photoactive in their own right, exhibiting intriguing photoinduced-electron transfer properties. The plasmonic properties of gold and silver nanoparticles again give intriguing hints of greatly potentiated photochemistry occurring under the influence of these locally enhanced electromagnetic fields. Finally the use of rare earth upconversion nanoparticles gives the promise of PDI no longer being limited by the penetration of light in tissue, as inexpensive continuous wave lasers can now produce the required short wavelength light to activate powerful photosensitizers. The following fields of clinical medicine are most likely to benefit from antimicrobial photodynamic nanomedicine, dermatology, dentistry, gynecology, urology, otolaryngology, ophthalmology and others. Altogether, the future looks bright for the long and happy marriage of antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation and nanomedicine.\n\n\u2022 Photodynamic inactivation uses nontoxic dyes and harmless visible light to kill all known micro-organisms regardless of antibiotic resistance.\n\n\u2022 Singlet oxygen is formed via type 2 photochemical pathway and reactive oxygen species and radicals via type 1 photochemical pathway.\n\n\u2022 Many photosensitizers are insoluble and tend to aggregate, and nanoparticlebased delivery vehicles can improve their performance.\n\n\u2022 Photostable titanium dioxide nanoparticles mediate photocatalysis and can produce self-sterilizing surfaces.\n\n\u2022 Carbon nanostructures such as fullerenes, nanotubes and graphene can be photoactivated to kill microbes.\n\n\u2022 Gold and silver nanoparticles can potentiate photodynamic inactivation via a plasmon-resonance effect.\n\n\u2022 Naturally occurring polymers such as chitosan and cellulose can be used to produce nontoxic photoactivated nanomedicines.\n\n\u2022 Rare earth mineral nanoparticles can be used to transduce near-infrared light into short wavelength visible light for better tissue penetration and photosensitizer excitation. Polymeric nanoparticles are sub-\u00b5m colloidal particles designed to solubilize hydrophobic photosensitizer. They include: (A) nanomicelles in which amphiphilic copolymers with hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks self-assemble to entrap the cargo; (B) nanocapsules, in which the cargo is in solution and surrounded by a shell-like wall; (C) nanospheres, in which the cargo is dissolved, adsorbed or dispersed throughout the matrix, attached to the surface or attached to the polymer matrix; and (D) liposomes in which an amphiphlic polymer self-assembles into a lipid bilayer that forms a unilamellar vesicle that encapsulates the cargo [50] . Nanoparticles have a sufficiently large surface area to allow this process to be efficient. Electrons are excited by UVA light from the semiconductor valence band to the conductance band. The electrons in the conductance band undergo electron transfer to oxygen to form superoxide, and the holes in the valence band react with water to form hydroxyl radicals. The ROS produced (O2 \u00b7\u2212 and HO \u00b7 ) can kill microorganisms. C B : Conduction band; E g : Energy gap; UVA: Ultraviolet A; V B : Valence band.\n\nYin et al.
