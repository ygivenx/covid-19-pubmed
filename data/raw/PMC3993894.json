{"title": "Injection Route and TLR9 Agonist Addition Significantly\nImpact Heroin Vaccine Efficacy", "body": "Heroin is a highly\naddictive semisynthetic opioid derived from\nthe diacetylation of morphine. Indeed, heroin abuse is a significant\nproblem that incurs large social and economic costs worldwide.1,2 Alarmingly, the number of heroin users in the U.S. has grown by\n50% from 2002 to 2010.3 Furthermore, since\n2007 the number of deaths due to heroin overdose has also increased.4 Due to the severity of heroin addiction, there\nis a dire need for anti-heroin addiction treatments that are more\neffective than currently available pharmacological agents (e.g., methadone,\nbuprenorphine, and naltrexone). The first report of a working heroin\nvaccine was disclosed in 1974,5 however,\nfurther research on heroin immunopharmacotherapy has only been conducted\nin the past decade.6,7 Previously, we reported the design\nof a heroin\u2013KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) immunoconjugate\n(Figure 1) that showed ample promise in combination\nwith alum adjuvant as a vaccine against heroin addiction.8 As a testament to the vaccine\u2019s efficacy,\nimmunization of heroin-dependent rats prevented relapse to compulsive\nintake of heroin in self-administration models.9 Herein, we sought to further improve our vaccine\u2019s\nperformance through injection route and adjuvant exploration.\n\nVaccine administration route may influence immune response,\ndue\nto a difference in physiological environments of the subcutaneous\ntissue versus the peritoneal cavity. Interestingly, no study to date\nhas investigated injection route of small molecule conjugate vaccines.\nIn addition to administration route, adjuvants can also impact vaccine\nperformance. In this capacity, TLR agonists could play an important\nrole in vaccine design with their ability to modulate immune responses.\nFor example, CpG ODN acts as a pathogen associated molecular pattern\n(PAMP) to stimulate the innate immune receptor TLR9.10 A specific CpG ODN, CpG 1826 (Figure 1), is a member of \u201cB-class\u201d ODNs which activate B-cell\nimmune responses.11 Impressively, vaccine\ntrials engaging a specific CpG ODN sequence (#1826) in combination\nwith alum have demonstrated its ability to safely enhance IgG antibody\ntiters against the target antigen in mice.12\u221215 Furthermore, many phase I and\nII clinical trials have investigated B-type CpG ODNs as vaccine adjuvants\nagainst hepatitis B,16 malaria,17 pneumonia,18 melanoma,19 and lymphoma.20 Results\nfrom most clinical studies demonstrate CpG ODN efficacy in enhancing\nimmunity to the target antigen while displaying a favorable safety\nprofile. Additionally, this adjuvant is inexpensive, stable, readily\nobtainable and can be easily manipulated for vaccine formulation.\nCpG ODN 1826 therefore holds promise as an adjunct to our heroin vaccine\n\u201ccocktail\u201d as a means of further potentiating opioid-neutralizing\nantibodies.\n\nIn the research we disclose herein, both injection\nroute and TLR9\nagonist CpG ODN 1826 significantly affected antibody titer levels\nand opiate affinity, translating to marked differences in mitigation\nof heroin-induced analgesia. Full heroin dose\u2013response curves\nwere generated in both hot-plate and tail flick tests to clearly demonstrate\ndifferences in vaccine efficacy. Our results have wide-reaching applicability\nfor both refining and evaluating drugs of abuse vaccines.\n\nAll studies were performed\nin compliance with the Scripps Insitutional Animal Care and Use Committee\nand were in concordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide\nfor the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 6\u20138 week old male\nSwiss Webster mice (Taconic) were immunized ip, sc, or ip/sc with\n50 \u03bcg of heroin\u2013KLH conjugate on days 0, 14, and 28.\nThe mice were bled on days 21 and 42. Since titers were much higher\non day 42 than 21, day 42 sera were used for the reported immunochemical\nassays. Heroin\u2013KLH (Figure 1) was prepared\nvia thiol\u2013maleimide coupling. A heroin\u2013BSA conjugate\nwas prepared as a surrogate to quantify hapten loading by MALDI-ToF\nMS (4 copies per BSA, Supporting Information) as performed previously.21 A single\nbatch of the conjugate was used for all immunizations. Each vaccine\nwas prepared by shaking a 1:1 v/v mixture of Her\u2013KLH and Imject\nAlum (Thermo Pierce) for 30 min, and the final volume injected was\n150 \u03bcL per mouse. In the oligonucleotide adjuvant group, phosphorothioated\nCpG ODN 1826 (Figure 1, Eurofins MWG Operon)\nwas adsorbed to alum alongside Her\u2013KLH and each mouse received\n30 \u03bcg of the ODN per injection (ip).\n\nFor all\nELISAs, plates were coated with 250 ng/mL\nheroin\u2013BSA conjugate at 0 \u00b0C overnight. A pH 6.4 PBS buffer\nwas used throughout the assay. Titers are reported at OD50. Overall titers were determined with a IgG/IgM/IgA secondary (SouthernBiotech)\nwhile IgG titers were determined with secondaries specific for IgG1\nor IgG2a (Invitrogen). For competitive ELISAs the limiting dilution\nwas found by normalizing titer curves for each treatment group (pooled\nsera) and choosing the dilution that produced 80% of the maximum absorbance.\nCompetition with heroin or its primary metabolites, 6-acetlymorphine\n(6AM) or morphine (Cambridge Isotopes), was run in triplicate for\neach group. DMSO was used to solubilize the opioids with a final assay\nDMSO concentration of 0.5%. Generally, competitive ELISA IC50 values underestimate actual KD by a\nfactor of 103. Radioimmunoassay for determining KD was not possible because of the instability\nof heroin.\n\nAt day 46, mice were tested for spinal (tail immersion)\nand supraspinal\n(hot plate) antinociceptive responses,22 both set to 54 \u00b0C. The hot plate test was measured by placing\nthe mouse in an acrylic cylinder (14 cm diameter \u00d7 22 cm) and\ntiming latency to perform one of the following nociceptive responses:\nlicking of hindpaw, shaking of hindpaw, or jumping. Mice were removed\nfrom the surface immediately following response, with typical baseline\nlatency between 8 and 15 s, and a 35 s cutoff to prevent tissue damage.\nThe tail immersion test was administered by lightly restraining mice\nin a small pouch constructed from absorbent laboratory underpads and\ndipping 1 cm of the tip of the tail into a heated water bath, with\nthe time to withdrawal timed. Typical baseline response was 1\u20132\ns, and a cutoff of 10 s was imposed to prevent tissue damage. Baselines\nfor hot plate followed by tail flick were performed, and then drug\nwas immediately administered. Following a set time (10 min for heroin,\n15 min for morphine/oxycodone) the tests were repeated, and if no\nfull analgesic response was noted, the animals continued to receive\nfurther cumulative drug injections and repeated testing until cutoff\ntimes were reached. Drugs were tested in a counterbalanced manner\nwith at least 3 days between drug cumulative-dosing regimens.\n\nComputational and statistical\nanalysis was performed in GraphPad PRISM. All values are reported\nas means \u00b1 SEM. Titers were determined by applying the one site\nfit logIC50 nonlinear regression. Normalization was performed by fitting\ntiter curves with the one site fit logIC50 regression and then by\nexpressing values as a percentage of the maximum absorbance. Competition\ncurves generated at the 80% limiting dilution were first normalized\nand then fitted with the log(inhibitor) vs normalized response \u2013\nvariable slope regression to calculate IC50 values. Titers\nwere compared via one-way ANOVA with Fisher\u2019s LSD post hoc\ncomparisons.\n\nAntinociceptive data was transformed from time\nto % maximum possible effect (% MPE), which is calculated as % MPE\n= (test \u2013 baseline)/(cutoff \u2013 baseline) \u00d7 100.\nThis data was then fit using a log(agonist) vs normalized response\nnonlinear regression. These produced ED50 values for each\ndrug under each pain test for the individual treatment groups, allowing\ncalculation of potency ratios. Differences in potency were determined\nby one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test.\n\nMice were immunized\nwith our first generation heroin vaccine (heroin\u2013KLH conjugate\nformulated with alum adjuvant), and antibody titers were measured\nby ELISA against heroin\u2013BSA conjugate. A significant effect\nof the vaccines on antibody titers was observed [IgG1, F2,24 = 7.2, p < 0.01; IgG2a, F2,23 = 4.8, p < 0.01]. Ip\nand ip/sc administration of the heroin vaccine gave nearly identical\ntiters, which were 5-fold higher compared to sc injection (Table 1). On top of a significant effect of ip administration\nroutes compared to sc, the addition of CpG ODN 1826 further increased\ntiters 6-fold compared to alum alone (p < 0.05,\nFisher\u2019s tests).\n\nBased upon competitive ELISA\ndata, the ip group exhibited the poorest\noverall opioid affinities, although the ip/sc group 6AM affinity was\nweakest of all the groups (Table 1). In contrast,\naffinities for heroin, 6AM, and morphine were 2\u20134-fold better\nin the sc group. When CpG ODN 1826 was added to our existing formulation,\naffinities improved 27-fold for heroin, 9-fold for 6AM, and 12-fold\nfor morphine. Statistical comparisons were not performed because affinities\nwere determined from pooled sera.\n\nTo assess Th1 and Th2-associated\nhumoral responses, we compared\ntiters of anti-heroin IgG2a and IgG1, respectively. As shown previously,\nour heroin vaccine exhibits an exclusively Th2 immune response.21 However, addition of CpG ODN in the current\nstudy elicited a robust Th1 humoral response as indicated by the 27-fold\nincrease in IgG2a titers (Table 1; p < 0.05). Furthermore, CpG ODN enhanced the Th2-associated\nhumoral response by boosting IgG1 titers 4-fold over alum alone (p < 0.05).\n\nTo assess\nvaccine performance\nin blocking the analgesic effects of heroin, vaccinated animals were\nsubjected to two antinociceptive tests, hot plate and tail immersion.\nFull dose\u2013response curves and corresponding ED50 values were generated to thoroughly test vaccine efficacy in a wide\nrange of heroin doses, then repeated for selectivity against morphine\nand oxycodone. Results in the behavioral tests generally paralleled\nELISA results. The vaccines showed varying degrees of shifting the\nheroin antinociceptive dose\u2013response to the right, with tail\nimmersion being more responsive to the vaccines (Figure 2). A significant effect of vaccination was observed based\non the derived estimates of heroin\u2019s antinociceptive ED50 in both tests [hot plate, F4,310 = 31.1, p < 0.001; tail immersion, F4,310 = 25.5, p < 0.001]. Post hoc\ncomparison of heroin ED50 values for the sc group were\nover 2-fold lower (p < 0.05) in the tail immersion\nassay compared to either ip or ip/sc coadministration groups (Table 2; Tukey\u2019s test). Ip and ip/sc performances\nwere fairly similar to one another and gave ED50 values\nthat were 7\u201310-fold better than those of naive animals (p < 0.01). Addition of CpG ODN 1826 increased ED50 values by 5-fold in hot plate (p < 0.01)\nand 2\u20135-fold in tail immersion (p < 0.01)\nover alum alone.\n\nSimilar\nantinociceptive testing was conducted for morphine as that\nfor heroin, and a significant vaccination ANOVA was determined [hot\nplate, F4,115 = 6.4, p < 0.001; tail immersion, F4,135 =\n10.9, p < 0.001]. Similar to previous findings,\nour original vaccine formulation is primarily more effective on heroin\nthan morphine. No significant shift of morphine potency was found\ncompared to naive, regardless of route of administration (Table S1\nin the Supporting Information). However,\nthe addition of the CpG ODN 1826 provided sufficient boosts in titer\nand affinity to generate a significant reduction in morphine potency,\nthough only in the tail immersion test (p < 0.001).\nAs expected, and in confirmation of the selectivity of the vaccine\nfor heroin and its primary metabolites, no heroin vaccine treatment\nprovided protection against oxycodone, a structurally similar opioid\n(Table S2 in the Supporting Information).\n\nThe current study highlights the impact\nof varying the injection\nroute of our first generation heroin vaccine, along with enhancing\nimmunogenicity by addition of the CpG ODN adjuvant. Few studies have\ndirectly compared injection routes for drugs of abuse vaccines with\nthe exception of one study that found intradermal (id) nicotine vaccine\ndelivery to be effective compared to intramuscular (im).23 However, id delivery is generally not compatible\nwith alum adjuvant: a necessary component of our heroin vaccine. Although\nthe im route was not investigated in the current study, previous studies\nhave shown that im is comparable to sc in terms of vaccine immunogenicity.24\n\nAlum has been shown to stimulate dendritic\ncells (DCs) both intraperitoneally\nand subcutaneously through the NALP3 inflammasome, enhancing Th2 immune\nresponses to the antigen.25 Although a\nTh2 response was observed for both ip and sc administration routes,\ntiters were 6-fold higher for ip. The difference in physiological\nenvironments between the subcutaneous tissue and peritoneal cavity\nmay contribute to the observed discrepancy in ip versus sc immunization.\nThe heroin\u2013KLH immunogen in the peritoneal fluid can drain\ndirectly to lymph nodes for immune recognition,26 however, the large particle size of the immunogen when\nformulated with alum prevents immediate drainage out of subcutaneous\ntissue.27 Consequently, the immunogen is\ntaken up by DCs and transported to lymph nodes to evoke an adaptive\nimmune response.28 According to our study,\nimmunogenicity of our heroin\u2013KLH immunogen is best achieved\nvia intraperitoneal administration possibly due to more immediate\ndrainage to lymph nodes. In sum, these findings stress the need for\ntesting vaccination route in studying drugs of abuse vaccines, which\ncould be especially important at the clinical level.\n\nPreviously,\nwe reported reduced immunogenicity of our heroin vaccine\nin the presence of CpG ODN;21 however,\nthese results were derived from an oligonucleotide with native phosphodiester\nlinkages. In the current study we employed nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate\nlinkages between base pairs to enhance in vivo stability.\nAs a result, we obtained drastically increased titers and opioid affinities\nsimilar to previous studies that showed that CpG ODN bolsters antinicotine\nvaccine efficacy.23,29 Interestingly, we observed a\nmarked increase not only in IgG2a titers but also in IgG1. In a previous\nstudy, only Th1 associated antibodies were boosted by CpG ODN 1826.12,30 The observed dually enhanced Th1 and Th2 humoral responses highlight\na unique compatibility between this vaccine \u201ccocktail\u201d:\nheroin\u2013KLH conjugate, alum and CpG ODN 1826.\n\nComparing\ntiters, opioid affinities, and pain curves in the current\nstudy reveals that immunochemical assay results do not always present\na clear indication of vaccine efficacy (especially vaccines against\nheroin that target three different opioids). While the sc immunized\ngroup exhibited higher opioid affinities and lower titers, analgesia\ntesting demonstrated that the efficacy of the sc group was inferior\nto all other groups. Although the non-CpG groups appeared different\nin terms of titers and affinities, the hot plate test revealed no\ndifferences between the groups. The lack of efficacy in the hot plate\ntest compared to tail immersion suggests a differential ability to\nblock spinal reflexive analgesia, largely mediated by spinal \u03bc-opioid\nreceptors, versus more complex pain-related behavior of hot plate\nthat involves peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal processing. The\nhot plate test has also been found to be less sensitive compared to\ntail flick in reducing morphine-induced analgesic properties in \u03bc-opioid\nreceptor deficient mice.31 It should also\nbe noted that, compared with previous titer and hot plate evaluation\nin rats using the same vaccination procedure, mice exhibit lower titer\nresponses and less substantial shifts in heroin hot plate analgesia.9\n\nThe large enhancement in vaccine performance\nfrom CpG ODN suggests\nthat, when assessing a vaccine, >10-fold greater antidrug titers\nand\naffinities must be achieved to also present improved efficacy at the\nbehavioral level. Moreover, previous evidence demonstrates that weak\nblockade by drug-directed vaccines tends to actually promote increased\ndrug seeking,32,33 often leading to subjects adjusting\ndosing in order to supersede the vaccine. This necessitates rigorous\nbehavioral testing over a wide range of doses to provide an accurate\nindication of vaccine efficacy in reducing drug psychoactivity.\n\nWe have shown that the enhanced antidrug titers and opioid affinities\nfrom CpG ODN translate directly to reduced pharmacodynamics of the\ndrug; in our case heroin-induced latency to nociception (analgesia)\nwas greatly diminished in hot plate and tail immersion tests. Previous\nstudies have shown that when CpG ODN is used as an adjuvant in nicotine\nvaccines, a greater degree of drug immunoantagonism is achieved; antibodies\nin vaccinated animals bind a greater amount of nicotine in the blood\nleading to a lower concentration of nicotine in the brain.23,29 However, it is not clear to what degree this result would manifest\nbehaviorally. Analgesia testing is a robust method of measuring to\nwhat degree heroin is generating psychoactive effects in an animal\nand is therefore highly relevant to screening vaccines for immunotherapeutic\nantagonism.\n\nWe demonstrated previously that blunted analgesic\nresponses to\nheroin in mice vaccinated with our first generation heroin vaccine\ncorresponded to a blockade of compulsive heroin intake in rats.8,9 The over 2-fold greater ED50 for heroin analgesia in\nthe CpG ODN vaccine group over the first generation vaccine group\n(alum alone) implies that CpG ODN addition to the vaccine lends a\nsignificant increase in protection from heroin addiction. In extrapolating\nthe tail immersion test results to humans, an 80 kg adult when immunized\nwith the standard vaccine would have to administer 207 mg heroin to\nexperience an effect compared to 30 mg in an unvaccinated adult. When\nCpG ODN is added to the vaccine, an adult would have to administer\n417 mg heroin to experience an equivalent effect. At this large a\ndose required for psychoactivity, maintaining a heroin addiction would\nlikely become impractical both behaviorally and economically. Overall,\nthe findings from our study are expected to facilitate the development\nof vaccines not only against opioids but also against other drugs\nof abuse."}
