In order to identify this 15). These observations indicate that there is a specific interaction between Ps290 RNA and proteins from MHVinfected cells as well as with proteins from mock-infected cells.\n\nThe MHV-A59 nucleocapsid protein interacts specifically with Ps290 RNA To investigate whether the N protein is part of the protein-Ps290 RNA complex, a supershift assay using a N-specific antibody was performed. If the N protein is indeed part of the complex, binding to N of a N-specific antibody should result in the formation of a large complex composed of Ps290 RNA, N protein, and N-specific antibody. This complex is expected to migrate slower in the gel as compared to the protein-Ps290 RNA complex and meier, 1985) was used to analyze the protein-Ps290 RNA complex and the monoclonal b-galactosidase-specific antibody was used as a control.

Competition of the interaction between Ps290 RNA and proteins from the I-lysate with a 10-fold molar excess of nonlabeled Ps290 RNA resulted already in a decrease of intensity of the retarded band (Fig. 2, lane 5) . At a level of 30fold molar excess of nonlabeled Ps290 RNA the retarded band was no longer visible and all of the labeled RNA migrated at the position of the unbound RNA probe (Fig.  2, lane 7) . Competition with a 100-fold molar excess of yeast tRNA did not affect the intensity or the mobility of the retarded band, indicating that the observed interaction between Ps290 RNA and proteins from the I-lysate is specific for the Ps290 RNA (Fig. 2, lane 8) . Competition of the interaction between Ps290 RNA and proteins from the MI-lysate with non-labeled Ps290 RNA or yeast tRNA beled Ps290 RNA competed entirely for protein binding formed using a 1-to 30-fold molar excess of unlabeled Ps290 RNA or (Fig. 2, lane 14) , whereas a 100-fold molar excess of a 1-to 100-fold molar excess of yeast tRNA.

Complexes formed between proteins from the MI-lysate and Ps180 RNA or PsDHP RNA could not be immunoprecipitated with the N-specific antibody (Fig.  4, lanes 3 and 4) . When the Ps180 and PsDHP RNAs were used in a competitive gelretardation experiment with radiolabeled Ps290 and the I-lysate, complete competition was observed with the Ps180 RNA, whereas no immunoprecipitation and that this interaction is dependent on the presence of the 69-nt Ps hairpin.\n\nTo determine the specificity of the nucleocapsid pro-RNA-protein complexes (Fig. 3, lanes 8-10 and 12) , tein-Ps180 RNA interaction in UV cross-linking assays, clearly indicating that the observed supershift was not competition experiments were performed.

Furthermore, in order to investigate whether the 69-nt hairpin of Ps180 (and Ps290) RNA is responsible for specific nucleocapsid protein binding, PsDHP RNA was constructed. This RNA is identical to Ps180 RNA except that the largest part of the 69-nt Ps hairpin has been removed. The U contents of Ps180 and PsDHP are similar (approx. 25%).\n\nPilot experiments were performed to estimate the optimal UV dose.

These experiments clearly demonstrate that no virus specific modifications of the N protein or any other viral proteins are required for the specific interaction with Ps180.\n\nInitiation of encapsidation by a specific interaction between the (nucleo-) capsid protein and a RNA packaging signal is a common mechanism used by positive stranded RNA viruses. Such an interaction has already Weis et al., 1989) , retroviruses (Zhang were immunoprecipitated with N-specific monoclonal antibody and Barklis, 1995; Berkowitz et al., 1995; Dupraz and 5B188.2 .

In contrast, no complex could nature of these cellular proteins and the significance of be immunoprecipitated with N-specific antibodies when this interaction, however, remains unclear. the b-lysate was used (Fig. 6B, lanes 1 and 3) . This indicates that any structural change of the N protein which might occur during virus assembly does not affect the ability of the N protein to interact with Ps180 RNA.\n\nIn MHV-infected cells, the N protein might also undergo virus-specific or virus-dependent posttranslational modifications. These modifications might play a role in the specific interaction with the Ps. Furthermore, it is not yet known if the interaction between the N protein and the Ps involves other viral proteins as well. In order to investigate this, recombinant N protein was expressed by the vTF7.3 expression system. A N protein expression vector (pEMCV-N) was transfected in vTF7.3-infected RK13 cells and protein lysates were made 16 h posttransfection (vTF7pN lysate).
