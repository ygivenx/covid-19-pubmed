{"title": "Asymptotic profile in selection-mutation equations: Gauss versus Cauchy distributions", "body": "The phenotypic diversity of a species impacts its ability to evolve. In particular, the importance of the variance of the population along a phenotypic trait is illustrated by the fundamental theorem of natural selection [15] , and the breeder's equation [21] : the evolution speed of a population along a one dimensional fitness gradient (or under artificial selection) is proportional to the variance of the initial population. Recently, the phenotypic variance of populations has also come to light as an important element to describe the evolutionary dynamics of ecosystems (where many interacting species are considered) [27, 4, 26] .\n\nOver the last decade, the issue of Evolutionary Rescue emerged as an important question [3, 10, 17] (see also the seminal work of Luria and Delbr\u00fcck [20] ), and led to a new interest in the phenotypic distribution of populations, beyond phenotypic variance. Evolutionary Rescue is concerned with a population living in an environment that changes suddenly. The population will survive either if some individuals in the population carry an unusual trait that turns out to be successful in the new environment, or if new mutants able to survive in the new environment appear before the population goes extinct (see [22] for a discussion on the relative effect of de novo mutations and standing variance in Evolutionary Rescue). In any case, the fate of the population will not be decided by the properties of the bulk of its density, but rather by the properties of the tail of the initial distribution of the individuals, close to the favourable traits for the new environment. A first example of such problems comes from emerging diseases [16] : Animal infections sometimes are able to infect humans. This phenomenon, called zoonose, is the source of many human epidemics: HIV, SARS, Ebola, MERS-CoV, etc. A zoonose may happen if a pathogen that reaches a human has the unusual property of being adapted to this new human host. A second example comes from the emergence of microbes resistant to an antimicrobial drug that is suddenly spread in the environment of the microbe. This second phenomenon can easily be tested experimentally [3, 24] , and has major public health implications [9] .\n\nMost papers devoted to the genetic diversity of populations structured by a continuous phenotypic trait describe the properties of mutation-selection equilibria. It is however also interesting to describe the genetic diversity of populations that are not at equilibrium (transient dynamics): pathogen populations for instance are often in transient situations, either invading a new host, or being eliminated by the immune system. We refer to [18] for a review on transient dynamics in ecology. For asexual populations structured by a continuous phenotypic trait, several models exist, corresponding to different biological assumptions [11] . If the mutations are modelled by a diffusion, the steady populations (for a model close to (1) , but where mutations are modelled by a Laplacian) are Gaussian distributions [19, 6] . Furthermore, [1, 14] have considered some transient dynamics for this model. In the model that we will consider (see (1) ), the mutations are modelled by a non-local term. It was shown in [7] (see also [6] ) that mutation-selection equilibria are then Cauchy profiles (under some assumptions), and this result has been extended to more general mutation kernels in [8] , provided that the mutation rate is small enough. Finally, let us notice that the case of sexual populations is rather different, since recombinations by themselves can imply that a mutation-recombination equilibrium exists, even without selection. We refer to the infinitesimal model [5] , and to [25] for some studies on the phenotypic distribution of sexual species in a context close to the one presented here for asexual populations.\n\nIn this article, we consider a population consisting of individuals structured by a quantitative phenotypic trait x \u2208 I (I open interval of R containing 0), and denote by f := f (t, x) \u2265 0 its density. Here, the trait x is fully inherited by the offspring (if no mutation occurs), so that x is indeed rather a breeding value than a phenotypic trait (see [23] ). We assume that individuals reproduce with a rate 1, and die at a rate\n\nThis means that individuals with trait x = 0 are those who are best adapted to their environment, and that the fitness decreases like a parabola around this optimal trait (this is expected in the surroundings of a trait of maximal fitness). It also means that the strength of the competition modelled by the logistic term is identical for all traits. When an individual of trait x \u2208 I gives birth, we assume that the offspring will have the trait x with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b5, and a different trait x with probability \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1). \u03b5 is then the probability that a mutation affects the phenotypic trait of the offspring. We can now define the growth rate of the population of trait x (that is the difference between the rate of births without mutation, minus the death rate) as\n\nWhen a mutation affects the trait of the offspring, we assume that the trait x of the mutated offspring is drawn from a law over the set of phenotypes I \u2282 R with a density \u03b3 := \u03b3(x) \u2208 L 1 (I). The function \u03b3 then satisfies\n\n(we assume moreover in some of the mathematical statements that \u03b3 is bounded, C 1 , with bounded derivative and that it is strictly positive on I). The main assumption here is that the law of the trait of a mutated offspring does not depend on the trait of its parent. This classical assumption, known as house of cards is not the most realistic, but it can be justified when the mutation rate is small [6] (see also [8] ). All in all, we end up with the following equation:\n\nThis paper is devoted to the study of the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions of equation (1) when \u03b5 is small and t large and it is organized as follows. In the rest of Section 1 the main results are quoted, first in an informal way, and then as rigorous statements. Section 2 contains the proof of Proposition 1.1 and Theorem 1.2, and finally, in Section 3, Theorem 1.3 is proved.\n\nWhen we consider the solutions of (1), two particular profiles naturally appear:\n\n\u2022 A Cauchy profile: For a given mutation rate \u03b5 > 0 small enough, one expects that f \u03b5 (t, x) will converge, as t goes to infinity, to the unique steady-state of (1), which is the following Cauchy profile\n\nwhere I \u03b5 (\u221e) is such that I f \u03b5 (\u221e, x) dx = I \u03b5 (\u221e). This steady-state of (1) is the so-called mutationselection equilibrium of the House of cards model (1), which has been introduced in [7] (we also refer to [6] for a broader presentation of existing results). \u2022 A Gaussian profile: If \u03b5 = 0, the solution of (1) can be written as\n\nwhere I 0 (t) := I f 0 (t, x) dx, so that a Gaussian-like behaviour (with respect to x) naturally appears in this case. Surprisingly, we are not aware of any reference to this property in the population genetics literature.\n\nWe will show that, as suggested by the above arguments, we can describe the phenotypic distribution of the population, that is x \u2192 f \u03b5 (t, x), when either t 1 (large time for a given mutation rate \u03b5 > 0), or 0 \u2264 \u03b5 1 (small mutation rate, for a given time interval t \u2208 [0, T ]). Before providing the precise statements of our results (see Subsection 1.3), we will briefly describe them here, and illustrate them with numerical simulations. The numerical simulations presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are obtained thanks to a finite difference scheme (explicit Runge-Kutta in time), and we illustrate our result with a single simulation of (1) with \u03b5 = 10 \u22122 ,\n\nin eq. (4) below). The initial condition corresponds to a population at the mutation-selection equilibrium which environment suddenly changes (the optimal trait originally in x = 1 moves to x = 0 at t = 0). This example is guided by the Evolutionary Rescue experiments described in Subsection 1.1, where the sudden change is obtained by the addition of e.g. salt or antibiotic to a bacterial culture. We describe two phases of the dynamics of the population:\n\n\u2022 Large time: Cauchy profile. We show that f \u03b5 (t, x) is asymptotically (when the mutation rate \u03b5 > 0 is small) close to\n\nprovided t \u03b5 \u22124 . The population is then a time-independent Cauchy distribution for large times. This theoretical result is coherent with numerical results: we see in Fig. 1 that f \u03b5 (t, \u00b7) is well described by \u0393 2 (\u03b5, \u00b7), as soon as t \u2265 10 5 , which is confirmed by the value of f \u03b5 (t, \u00b7) \u2212 \u0393 2 (\u03b5, \u00b7) L 1 (I) for t \u2265 10 5 given by Fig. 2. \u2022 Short time: Gaussian profile. We also show that f \u03b5 (t, x) is asymptotically (when the mutation rate \u03b5 > 0 is small) close to\n\nprovided 1 t \u03b5 \u22122/3 . The population has then a Gaussian-type distribution for short (but not too short) times. This theoretical result is coherent with numerical simulations: we see in Fig. 1 that f \u03b5 (t, \u00b7) is well described by \u0393 1 (t, \u03b5, \u00b7) for t \u2208 [10 2 , 10 4 ], which is confirmed by the value of f \u03b5 (t, \u00b7) \u2212\u0393 2 (\u03b5, \u00b7) L 1 (I) for t \u2208 [10 2 , 10 4 ] given by Fig. 2 .\n\nAnother way to look at these results is to consider t \u2265 0 and \u03b5 > 0 as two parameters, and to see the approximations presented above as approximations of f \u03b5 (t, \u00b7) for some set of parameters:\n\nWe have represented these sets in Fig. 3 .\n\nAs described in the Subsection 1.1, the phenotypic distribution of species is involved in many ecological and epidemiological problematics. Our study is a general analysis of this problem and we do not have a particular application in mind. An interesting and (to our knowledge) new feature described by our study is that the tails of the trait distribution in a population can change drastically between \"short times\", that is 1 t \u03b5 \u22122/3 and \"large times\", that is t \u03b5 \u22124 : the distribution is initially close to a Gaussian distribution, with small tails, and then converges to a thick tailed Cauchy distribution. This result could have significant consequences for evolutionary rescue: the tails of the distribution then play an important role. Quantifying the effect of this property of the tails of the distributions would however require further work, in particular on the impact of stochasticity (the number of pathogen is typically large, but finite). The plasticity of the pathogen (see [12] ) may also play an important role.\n\nHere we state the two main theorems of the paper, together with a proposition asserting the well-posedness of the equation that we consider. Fig. 1 . The different graphs correspond to different time points, from t = 0 to t = 175 000, of the same simulation of (1) for \u03b5 = 10 \u22122 (see in the text for a complete description). In each of these plots, the blue (resp. red, black) line represents ) ). Note that in this figure, the scales of both axis change from one graph to the other, to accommodate with the dynamics of the solution f (t, \u00b7). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) \n\n(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\nwhere the approximation f \u03b5 (t, \u00b7) \u223c \u03b5\u21920 \u0393 2 (\u03b5, \u00b7) holds provided that \u03b5 > 0 is small enough; and of the set\n\nwhere the approximation f \u03b5 (t, \u00b7) \u223c \u03b5\u21920 \u0393 1 (t, \u03b5, \u00b7) holds provided that \u03b5 > 0 is small enough. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\nWe start with the issue of well-posedness:\n\nWe assume that \u03b3 is continuous, bounded and strictly positive on I, and that I \u03b3(x) dx = 1. We consider an initial datum f 0 which is nonnegative, non-identically 0, and integrable on I. Finally we take \u03b5 \u2208 ]0, 1/2[. Then the initial value problem (1) \n\nThen we turn to the two statements which are relative to the asymptotic behaviour when \u03b5 \u2192 0 and t \u2192 +\u221e. Theorem 1.2. Under the assumptions of Proposition 1.1, and assuming moreover that \u03b3 has a bounded derivative on I, there exist positive constants K, K and K (independent of \u03b5) such that the mild solution f of (1) satisfies (for t > 0)\n\nUnder the assumptions of Proposition 1.1, and assuming moreover that a and b are finite,\n\nA careful check of the proof shows that the constant C appearing in (6) only depends on |a \u2212 b|, some upper bounds on \u03b3 L \u221e and f 0 W 1,\u221e , and a lower bound on f 0 (0).\n\nNote first that, as previously stated in the introduction, if we consider times t which are large enough,\n\nso that the Cauchy profile is indeed asymptotically reached for very large times. The interpretation of Theorem 1.3 is a little more intricate, since it concerns intermediate times. For example, it implies the following description of the population's phenotypic diversity during transitory times, that is times t satisfying 1 t \u03b5 \u2212 2 3 : There exists C > 0 such that for \u03ba > 0 and \u03b5 > 0 small enough (in such a way that the interval\n\nNote finally that these results hold for models which are slightly more general than equation (1) . In fact, in both theorems one can assume that the competition term is a weighted population instead of the total population number. In Theorem 1.3, one could also assume that the mutation kernel depends on the parents trait.\n\nWe start here the proofs of Proposition 1.1 and of Theorem 1.2. We recall that\n\nis a bounded, continuous, strictly positive function, such that \u03b3(x) > 0 and I \u03b3(x) dx = 1. For the proof of Theorem 1.2, we will also assume that it has a bounded derivative on I.\n\nWe begin with the study of the linear operator associated to eq. (1).\n\nLet us define\n\nas the operator corresponding to the linear part in eq. (1).\n\nWe begin with a basic lemma which enables to define the semigroup generated by this operator.\n\nLemma 2.1. The linear operator A \u03b5 , defined on L 1 (I) and with domain D(A \u03b5 ) = {f \u2208 L 1 (I) :\n\nProof. The multiplication linear operator\n\nSince \u03b3 is strictly positive, A \u03b5 \u2212 A 0 \u03b5 is a positive bounded perturbation whose only invariant closed ideals are 0 and the whole space L 1 (I). So T \u03b5 (t) is irreducible (see [13] , Corollary 9.22). 2\n\nNext, we present a proposition which gives information about the spectrum of A \u03b5 .\n\nProposition 2.2. The linear operator A \u03b5 has only one eigenvalue. It is a strictly dominant algebraically simple eigenvalue \u03bb \u03b5 > 1 \u2212 \u03b5 and a pole of the resolvent, with corresponding normalized positive eigenvector\n\nMoreover, for \u03b5 small enough, \u03bb \u03b5 < 1.\n\nProof. In the sequel, the norm || || is the L 1 norm on I. Let us first show that any \u03bb belonging to the set\n\nis contained in the spectrum of A \u03b5 . The claim follows from the fact that the spectrum is a closed set.\n\nOn the other hand, notice that (for x 0 \u2208 I), 1 \u2212\u03b5 \u2212x 2 0 is not an eigenvalue, since the potential corresponding eigenfunction \u03b3(x)\n\nis not an integrable function on I (remember that \u03b3 does not vanish). Let us now compute the resolvent operator of A \u03b5 , that is, let us try to solve the equation\n\nFor \u03bb / \u2208 J, defining p := I f (y) dy, (8) gives\n\nIntegrating, we get\n\nand \u03bb belongs to the resolvent set unless the factor of p on the left hand side vanishes. Therefore\n\n. Since for any real number \u03bb > 1 \u2212 \u03b5, the function F \u03b5 (\u03bb) := \u03b5 I \u03b3(x) \u03bb\u2212(1\u2212\u03b5\u2212x 2 ) dx is continuous, strictly decreasing, and satisfies lim \u03bb\u21921\u2212\u03b5 F \u03b5 (\u03bb) = +\u221e (recall that \u03b3(0) > 0) and lim \u03bb\u2192+\u221e F \u03b5 (\u03bb) = 0, we see that there is a unique real solution of F \u03b5 (\u03bb) = 1 in (1 \u2212 \u03b5, \u221e) . We denote it by \u03bb \u03b5 .\n\nTaking g(x) = 0 in (8), we see that \u03bb \u03b5 is an eigenvalue with corresponding normalized strictly positive eigenvector\n\nTaking g = \u03c8 \u03b5 and \u03bb = \u03bb \u03b5 we see that the left hand side in (10) vanishes, whereas the right hand side is strictly negative, so that A \u03b5 f \u2212 \u03bb \u03b5 f = \u03c8 \u03b5 has no solution and hence \u03bb \u03b5 is algebraically simple.\n\nIndeed, it also follows from (10) that the range of A \u03b5 \u2212 \u03bb \u03b5 Id coincides with the kernel of the linear form defined on L 1 (I) by the L \u221e function 1 \u03bb \u03b5 \u2212(1\u2212\u03b5)+x 2 (which is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \u03bb \u03b5 of the adjoint operator A * \u03b5 ) and hence it is a closed subspace of L 1 (I). Therefore, \u03bb \u03b5 is a pole of the resolvent (see Theorem A.3.3 of [13] ). Furthermore, since\n\nwe see that F \u03b5 (1) < 1 for \u03b5 small enough, and hence \u03bb \u03b5 < 1.\n\nSubstituting \u03bb by a + bi in the characteristic equation\n\nwe have that the imaginary part is \u2212\u03b5b I\n\nSince \u03b3(x) > 0, there are no nonreal solutions of (11). 2 Remark 2.1. Note that lim \u03b5\u21920 \u03bb \u03b5 = 1.\n\nWe now write an expansion of the eigenvalue \u03bb \u03b5 . Proposition 2.3. Let us assume that \u03b3 has a bounded derivative on I. Let \u03bb \u03b5 be the dominant eigenvalue of the operator A \u03b5 . Then\n\nwhere we have used\n\nand have denoted A := \u03b3 \u221e \u03b3 \u221e and B := min (|a|, b, A) . Since\n\nwhich implies\n\nfor \u03b5 small enough. Therefore, using (13) in (12) we get\n\nFinally, by (13) and (14),\n\nLet us define \u00c3 \u03b5 = A \u03b5 \u2212 \u03bb \u03b5 Id and let T \u03b5 (t) = e \u2212\u03bb \u03b5 t T \u03b5 (t) be the semigroup generated by \u00c3 \u03b5 . We now rewrite equation (1) as\n\nWe look for solutions of (15) (with positive initial condition f 0 \u2208 L 1 (I)) which can be written as (15), it follows that f is indeed a solution of eq. (1) if h(t) satisfies the following initial value problem for an ordinary differential equation:\n\nThen h satisfies the integral equation\n\nfrom which the following identity follows\n\nOn the other hand, the nonlinear part of the right hand side of (15) is a locally Lipschitz function of f \u2208 L 1 (I). From this uniqueness follows, whereas global existence and nonnegativity are clear from (16).\n\nLet us start this subsection with a proposition ensuring in a quantitative way the convergence of the solution towards a nontrivial steady state: Proposition 2.4. Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.2, for \u03b5 > 0 small enough, and any \u03c1 \u03b5 < (\u03b3(0)\u03c0\u03b5) 2 , there exists a constant C \u03b5 > 0 (depending on f 0 and \u03b5) such that\n\n, the following more explicit (in terms of dependence w.r.t \u03b5) estimate holds\n\nThe rest of this subsection will be devoted to proving Proposition 2.4 taking advantage of the special form of the solution, f (t) = h(t)T \u03b5 (t)f 0 , as written in the proof of Proposition 1.1. In order to do so, we will also use some lemmas (Lemmas 2.5-2.10 which are stated below).\n\nLet us start with one in which some properties of the spectrum of \u00c3 \u03b5 = A \u03b5 \u2212 \u03bb \u03b5 Id are used to study the asymptotic behaviour of the semigroup T \u03b5 (t) generated by \u00c3 \u03b5 .\n\nThe growth bound of the semigroup generated by \u00c3 \u03b5 is \u03c9 0 (T \u03b5 ) = 0.\n\nProof. a)\u00c3 \u03b5 is a compact (one rank) perturbation of \u00c3 0\n\nis the semigroup generated by \u00c3 0 \u03b5 (see [2] ). Since \u00c3 0 \u03b5 is a multiplication operator, \u03c9 ess T 0 \u03b5 = 1 \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 \u03bb \u03b5 and the result follows. b) By Proposition 2.2, the spectral bound of \u00c3 \u03b5 is 0 and the spectral mapping theorem holds for any positive C 0 -semigroup on L 1 (see [13] ). 2\n\nLet us now write, for a positive non-identically zero\n\nis the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of \u00c3 \u03b5 , and c f 0 \u03c8 \u03b5 (x) is the spectral projection of f 0 on the kernel of \u00c3 \u03b5 (Note that c f 0 > 0 since f 0 is positive and \u00c3 \u03b5 is the generator of an irreducible positive semigroup.) We also define \u03d5(t) := I v(t, x) dx.\n\nThe following lemma gives the asymptotic behaviour of c f 0 :\n\nLemma 2.6. Let us assume that f 0 is a positive integrable function on I. Then there exist positive constants\n\nProof.\n\nRecall that c f 0 = \u03c8 * \u03b5 , f 0 where \u03c8 * \u03b5 is the eigenvector of the adjoint operator A * \u03b5 corresponding to the eigenvalue \u03bb \u03b5 , normalized such that \u03c8 * \u03b5 , \u03c8 \u03b5 = 1. Since\n\nwe see that\n\nLet us start by bounding the denominator from above. Using that, by Proposition 2.3, for \u03b5 small enough,\n\n, we obtain the bound\n\nSimilarly, since for \u03b5 small enough, \u03bb \u03b5 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b5) \u2264 2(\u03b3(0)\u03c0\u03b5) 2 , we have\n\nwhere x 0 is any positive value in I.\n\nFor the numerator we have, on the one hand,\n\nwhere the right hand side tends to 0 when \u03b5 goes to 0 by an easy application of the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem (note that the integrand is bounded above by 2 (\u03b3(0)\u03c0) 2 f 0 (x)). On the other hand, notice that there exists an interval J \u2282 I which does not contain 0 such that\n\nthere exists a constant K 4 > 0 such that\n\nBy (18) and (19),\n\nand by (17) and (20) , and \u03b5 small enough,\n\nThis completes the proof. 2\n\nRemark 2.2. If f 0 (x) is bounded below by a positive number c in a neighbourhood (\u2212\u03b4, \u03b4) of 0, then the lower estimate can be improved using that\n\nIndeed, for \u03b5 small enough\n\nSo in this case, for \u03b5 small enough,\n\nThe next two lemmas enable to estimate \u03d5(t) (defined immediately before the statement of Lemma 2.6). In the first one, the dependence w.r.t. \u03b5 is not explicit.\n\nLemma 2.7. For \u03b5 small enough and any \u03c1 \u03b5 < (\u03b3(0)\u03c0\u03b5) 2 \n\nProof. Since, by Lemma 2.5, \u03c9 ess (\u00c3 \u03b5 ) < \u03c9 0 (\u00c3 \u03b5 ), we can apply Theorem 9.11 in [13] , and get the estimate\n\nWe now give an estimate of the dependence of K \u03b5 on \u03b5, provided that \u03c1 \u03b5 is chosen far enough from its limit value. More precisely, we choose\n\nLemma 2.8. For \u03b5 small enough, there exists a constant K independent of \u03b5 and of f 0 such that\n\nProof. Since the proof of this result is quite technical, we delay it to the end of this section (subsection 2.5). 2\n\nWe now turn to the study of the scalar function h(t). Notice that (16) can be written as\n\nThe next two lemmas are devoted to the analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of h(t). In the first one, the dependence w.r.t. \u03b5 of the constants is not explicit. Lemma 2.9.

The solution of (21) is explicitly given by\n\nThen\n\nwhere for the last inequality we have used that the denominator is a positive continuous function bounded below (it takes the value 1 for t = 0 and its limit is c f 0 \u03bb \u03b5 when t goes to infinity). We also used the following estimate for the numerator: since, by Lemma 2.7, |\u03d5(s)| \u2264 K \u03b5 e \u2212\u03c1 \u03b5 s f 0 , then\n\nIn order to give an estimate of the dependence of \u0108 \u03b5 w.r.t. \u03b5, we need to bound the denominator more precisely and to take a value of \u03c1 \u03b5 separated of its limit value.
