{"title": "Integrated Cross-Species Analysis Identifies a Conserved Transitional Dendritic Cell Population HHS Public Access", "body": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized antigen-presenting cells that bridge innate and adaptive immune responses (Banchereau and Steinman, 1998) . In both mouse and human, DCs are divided into functionally specialized subpopulations, i.e., plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and two subsets of classical DCs (cDCs), cDC1 and cDC2 (Guilliams et al., 2014; Merad et al., 2013) . pDCs are quite distinct from their cDC counterparts. Ontologically, pDCs differentiate from both myeloid and lymphoid precursors but display lymphoid features regardless of their developmental path (Corcoran et al., 2003; Naik et al., 2007; Onai et al., 2007; Sathe et al., 2013; Shigematsu et al., 2004) . Functionally, while cDC1s and cDC2s are specialized for interaction with T cells, pDCs are well known for their innate capacity to rapidly produce large quantities of type I interferon (IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2, abbreviated IFN-I) upon viral encounter (Asselin-Paturel et al., 2001; Siegal et al., 1999) . However, aside from their innate role, pDCs can carry out adaptive immune functions upon activation, i.e., antigen presentation, T cell activation, and tolerance (Alculumbre et al., 2019; Leylek and Idoyaga, 2019) . This represents a rare phenomenon in the immune system, in which one cell type is capable of mediating diverse immune tasks. Yet there is a lack of understanding of the mechanisms that control pDC functions. Dissecting these mechanisms is imperative for the development of pDC-based therapeutics.\n\nOne possible mechanism to enable diverse pDC functions is a division of labor among functionally distinct pDC subpopulations. pDC subpopulations have been described in mouse and human (Bj\u00f6rck et al., 2011; Hadeiba et al., 2008; Matsui et al., 2009; Wilhelm et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017) . However, there has been a general lack of consensus on these populations. Previous descriptions of pDC subpopulations were limited by inherently biased flow cytometry analyses with few markers. Furthermore, these reports fail to resolve findings between species. Advances in single-cell omics technologies have yielded an unprecedented resolution of the human DC compartment. Using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches that leverage unbiased analyses, we and others have unveiled a human pDC-like population with select features of cDCs (Alc\u00e1ntara-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2017; See et al., 2017; Villani et al., 2017) . However, it remains unclear whether the murine DC compartment contains such a population. A thorough analysis of pDC diversity in mice is critical to provide functional insights in vivo.\n\nHere, we used a high-dimensional mass cytometry approach (CyTOF) and unbiased analysis to interrogate the murine DC compartment at the protein level. We found a pDC-like population in mouse that displays cDC features and functions but ultimately demonstrates close developmental relationship to pDCs. We performed parallel cross-species comparisons with the goal of aligning this pDC subpopulation in mouse and human, which is imperative for the translation of basic biology to human immunology. We found that this murine pDClike population is equivalent to the recently described human AXL + DCs (also known as ASDCs) (Alc\u00e1ntara-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2017; See et al., 2017; Villani et al., 2017) . Although in mouse these cells did not express the protein Axl, they did share a continuum of phenotypes that span pDCs and cDC2s. We herein propose to name this intermediate population transitional DCs (tDCs) in both species. Our high-dimensional analysis represents an easily accessible data resource on the phenotype, transcriptome, and function of pDCs and tDCs at steady state and during influenza infection. This dataset reveals information that has not been recognized using low-dimensional flow cytometry analyses and can be exploited for the development of pDC-and tDC-based therapeutics.\n\nTo dissect pDC diversity in mouse, we designed a myeloid-focused CyTOF panel (Table  S1 ). In addition to surface markers, this panel incorporated transcription factors (TFs) differentially expressed in DC subsets: Tcf4 (pDCs), Irf8 (pDCs and cDC1s), and Irf4 (cDC2s) (Cisse et al., 2008; Schiavoni et al., 2002; Suzuki et al., 2004) . To allow greater resolution of minor myeloid populations, we enriched mouse splenic DCs and plotted Lin \u2212 cells in a t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) map ( Figure 1A ). We found a minimal number of Ccr2 + monocytes and CD64 + red pulp macrophages (RPMs) after enrichment ( Figure S1 ). Based on their phenotype, we identified formally described DC subsets, i.e., pDCs, cDC1s, and cDC2s. As expected, we observed high Tcf4 expression in pDCs, but not in cDCs, and high Irf8 expression in cDC1s and pDCs, but not in cDC2s. Surprisingly, we observed a bridging population of cells localized between pDCs and cDC2s in the tSNE map. The phenotype of this bridging population ranged from pDC-to cDC2like, i.e., high to low expression of Tcf4, Irf8, and the pDC marker SiglecH and low to high expression of CD11c.\n\nThe phenotype and tSNE map localization of this bridging population resembled human AXL + DCs, a pDC-like population with cDC2 features described by us and others (Alc\u00e1ntara-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2017; See et al., 2017; Villani et al., 2017) . To evaluate DC populations' homology between species, we performed parallel CyTOF analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ( Figure 1B ). In line with our previous report, we observed that human AXL + DCs bridge pDCs and cDC2s in a tSNE map, reflecting an intermediate phenotype, which was also true for human spleen ( Figure S2 ). Similar to mouse, the human bridging population expressed high to low levels of TCF4, IRF8, and the pDC markers CD123 and BDCA2, while CD11c expression ranged from low to high. Thus, the presence of cells that display a transitional phenotype between pDCs and cDC2s is a conserved characteristic between mouse and human. We called these cells transitional DCs (tDCs) with the intent to emphasize not only their intermediate phenotype but also their continuum of pDC to cDC2 features.\n\nMouse tDCs consistently localized between pDCs and cDC2s when analyzed using other clustering methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (Becht et al., 2018) (Figures 1C and 1D ). When we analyzed the expression of other markers present in our CyTOF panels, we again found that tDCs have intermediate expression of pDC and cDC markers (Figures 1E and 1F; see Figure  S1 and S2 for tSNE plots). In contrast to pDCs, mouse and human tDCs expressed high levels of CX3CR1 and IRF4. Unlike cDC2s, tDCs were CD11b \u2212 in mouse and BDCA1 \u2212 in human. Compared with cDC1s, tDCs were Xcr1 \u2212 and Cadm1 \u2212 in mouse and CLEC9A \u2212 in human. Altogether, our CyTOF analysis identified a distinct subpopulation of DCs in mouse that displays a transitional phenotype between pDCs and cDC2s and mirrors the phenotype of human blood and spleen AXL + DCs.\n\nWe then explored the diversity of mouse tDCs. We designed a flow cytometry gating strategy to enable tDC characterization, quantification, and purification ( Figure S3 ). Because tDCs did not express the cDC1 marker Xcr1 or the cDC2/monocyte marker CD11b ( Figure  1A ), we used these parameters to eliminate these cells (Figure 2A ). Biaxial gating of CyTOF data showed that tDCs (black dots) were among cells expressing high to low levels of SiglecH and low to high levels of CD11c. Furthermore, as shown by tSNE and UMAP analysis, tDCs, but not pDCs, were Cx3cr1 high (Figures 1D and 2A, upper left) . Finally, we observed that tDCs could be separated into two populations representing different parts of the spectrum: CD11c low Ly6C high tDCs (ii, purple) represent cells that are more similar to pDCs, while CD11c high Ly6C low tDCs (iii, cyan) correspond to cells that are more similarto cDC2s (Figure 2A , lower left). This partition mirrored our previous analysis of human AXL + DCs, which can also be split based on expression of CD11c to facilitate characterization of their heterogeneity (Alc\u00e1ntara-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2017) . We validated our observations by flow cytometry and quantified tDCs in lymphoid organs (Figures 2A and 2B ; see Figure S3 for the complete gating strategy). Compared with other DC subsets, tDCs were a minor population of cells in spleen and lymph nodes (LNs), representing ~0.02%-0.07% of all leukocytes. Notably, tSNE analysis revealed that LN tDCs mapped between pDCs and cDC2s and away from migratory major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) high DCs ( Figures 2C and S3C ).\n\nFlow cytometry analysis of CD11c low and CD11c high tDCs corroborated their transitional phenotype ( Figure 2D ). CD11c low tDCs had a phenotype closer to that of pDCs, with higher levels of SiglecH, Pdca1, and B220 than CD11c high tDCs. CD11c low and CD11c high tDCs were negative for the pDC markers Ccr9 and Ly6D; however, CD11c high tDCs had intermediate levels of CD9, a marker previously associated with pDC subpopulations (Bj\u00f6rck et al., 2011) . Although tDCs featured some levels of CD8, both CD11c low and CD11c high tDCs lacked expression of more specific cDC1 markers such as DEC205, Cadml, and surface Clec9A. We did not detect significant levels of the cDC2 marker Esam, but CD11c high tDCs were CD172a low .\n\nThe phenotype of mouse tDCs, particularly their expression of Cx3cr1 and CD8, resembled a previously described population of mouse DCs that has features of both pDCs and cDCs, termed noncanonical DCs ( Bar-On et al., 2010) . We hypothesized that noncanonical DCs could be represented within the tDC population. To test this, we mapped noncanonical DCs, gated as described by Bar-On et al. (2010) , onto our mouse tSNE plot and confirmed the high expression of CD8 in this part of the map (orange on top of the upper-right tSNE map, Figure 2E ). We also overlaid noncanonical DCs in our flow cytometry gating strategy (orange on top of the contour plots, Figure 2E ). In both cases, we found that noncanonical DCs mapped within the tDC population but only captured a fraction of it: 62.8% of CD11c high tDCs and 22.4% of CD11c low tDCs ( Figure 2F ). Noncanonical DCs represented ~34% of the entire tDC population ( Figure 2F , right bar graph). Thus, murine tDCs include the previously described noncanonical DCs.\n\nIn summary, we present a flow cytometry gating strategy that captures tDCs and allows for enrichment of different parts of the phenotypic spectrum based on CD11c and Ly6C expression.\n\nTo further query the homology of mouse and human tDCs (also known as AXL + DCs), we expanded our proteomic CyTOF approach to transcriptomics, which allows genome-wide comparison between species. We leveraged publicly available mouse bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of individually purified DC subsets and human single-cell RNA-seq data of myeloid cells (Lau et al., 2016; Villani et al., 2017) . The mouse dataset included noncanonical DCs, which we used to represent mouse tDCs for this analysis. PCA using nearly 1,000 differentially expressed genes overlapped mouse and human pDCs, cDC2s, and cDC1s, validating our analysis ( Figure 3A ; see Figure S4A for analysis details). Mouse tDCs localized between pDCs and cDC2s, overlapping with human tDCs. In both species, tDCs shared intermediate expression of several pDC genes (e.g., ITM2C and PTPRS), cDC genes (e.g., CD33 and ITGAX), CX3CR1, and CD5 ( Figure 3B ).\n\nNext, we inquired whether mouse tDCs share protein expression of surface markers described for human tDCs ( Figure 3C ). To mirror our mouse tDC analysis and characterize diversity within the population, we divided human tDCs based on their expression of CD11c, as previously described (Alc\u00e1ntara-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2017) . Human tDCs display high levels of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL; however, Axl was undetectable in mouse tDCs using two antibody clones that efficiently labeled macrophages, as shown in Figure  S4B . Human tDCs expressed CD5 and CD81 (Zhang et al., 2017) , which was also true for mouse tDCs, especially CD11c high tDCs. Lastly, both CD2 and SIGLEC1/CD169, two markers that have been used to define human pDC subpopulations (Matsui et al., 2009; Wilhelm et al., 2016) , were enriched in tDCs compared with other DC subsets in both species. However, CD2 was not a unique marker for tDCs, and Siglec1 was only detected in a fraction (~20%-30%) of murine tDCs. We were not able to evaluate SIGLEC6, a marker of human tDCs, because it does not have a mouse homolog. Collectively, mouse and human tDCs overlap transcriptionally and phenotypically. Furthermore, many previous reports referring to pDC subpopulations can be explained by the heterogeneous phenotype of tDCs in both mouse and human.\n\nDC subsets are characterized by their expression of a combination of TFs, which are essential for each subset's development, phenotype, and function. The TF TCF4 is required for pDC development and function (Cisse et al., 2008; Ghosh et al., 2010) . IRF8 and IRF4 are required for cDC1 and cDC2 development, respectively (Schiavoni et al., 2002; Suzuki et al., 2004) . Zbtb46 is uniquely expressed in cDCs and required for their function, but not their development (Meredith et al., 2012a (Meredith et al., , 2012b Satpathy et al., 2012) . Thus, we evaluated the TF signature of mouse and human tDCs in comparison to other DC subsets ( Figures 4A-4C ). At the RNA and protein level, both TCF4 and IRF8 expression ranged from intermediate to low in CD11c low and CD11c high tDCs, respectively. We found high levels of IRF4 in tDCs, particularly CD11c high tDCs; however, different from mouse, IRF4 was also present in human pDCs. Finally, Zbtb46 protein was detected in mouse tDCs, with intermediate to high expression in CD11c low and CD11c high tDCs, respectively.\n\nNext, we analyzed the TF ID2, which promotes cDC development by antagonizing TCF4 (Grajkowska et al., 2017) . We found that ID2 expression inversely correlated with TCF4 expression, as expected ( Figure 4C ; see Table S2 for primers). In mouse, Id2 was not detected in pDCs and CD11c low tDCs but was noted in CD11c high tDCs at levels comparable to cDCs. Similarly, low ID2 expression was detected in human CD11c high tDCs. Finally, we evaluated IRF7, a TF associated with the capacity of pDCs to produce IFN-I (Honda et al., 2005; Izaguirre et al., 2003) . We found that unlike pDCs, all tDCs in mouse and human expressed negligible levels of IRF7, suggesting functional differences between these cells. In summary, tDCs demonstrate a mixed pattern of TFs, correlating with their transitional phenotype between pDCs and cDCs.\n\nTo test whether tDC development depends on Tcf4 expression, we analyzed CD11c CRE Tcf4 fl/fl (Tcf4 CKO ) mice ( Figures 4D and 4E ). Conditional deletion of Tcf4 in this model results in pDC loss, as expected (Cisse et al., 2008; Ghosh et al., 2010) . The frequencies of both CD11c high and CD11c low tDCs were also significantly decreased in Tcf4 CKO mice, while cDC1s and cDC2s were unaffected. This indicates that similar to pDCs, tDC development depends on Tcf4.\n\nIRF8 expression is shared between pDCs and cDC1s. However, while cDC1s require IRF8 for development, pDCs require it for their function (Schiavoni et al., 2002; Sichien et al., 2016) . Depletion of Irf8 from pDCs generates a population with some features of cDCs, i.e., lower levels of SiglecH and higher levels of CD11c, Irf4, and MHC class II, which resembles the tDC population described here. Therefore, we analyzed pDCs and tDCs in CD11c CRE Irf8 fl/fl (Irf8 CKO ) mice by CyTOF. As expected, cDC1s failed to develop in these mice ( Figures 4F and 4G ). On the contrary, pDC and tDC numbers were unaffected in Irf8 CKO mice. Most pDCs from Irf8 CKO mice clustered separately from control mice but did not overlap with tDCs (population B in Irf8 CKO versus population A in control mice). Indeed, pDCs from Irf8 CKO mice had decreased expression of several markers, including SiglecH, and increased expression of MHC class II, as previously shown ( Figure 4H ; Sichien et al., 2016) . Similarly, tDC phenotype was slightly altered in Irf8 CKO mice, although to a lower extent, corresponding to their lower expression of Irf8. We conclude that similar to pDCs, Irf8 is not required for tDC development. Furthermore, our results show that Irf8 depletion does not promote pDC differentiation into tDC-like cells.\n\nOur transcriptome analysis showed that mouse and human tDCs express Bcl11a, Runx2, and SpiB, i.e., TFs associated with pDC development and function ( Figure 4A ; Chopin et al., 2016; Ippolito et al., 2014; Sawai et al., 2013; Schotte et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2013) . We confirmed this analysis by evaluating the expression of these TFs within mouse CD11c low and CD11c high tDCs ( Figure 5A ). We detected high levels of Bcl11a, Runx2, and SpiB in pDCs and tDCs but little to none of these TFs in cDC1s or cDC2s. Bcl11a was expressed similarly by all tDCs and pDCs, whereas Runx2 expression varied from high to low in tDC fractions. SpiB expression was higher in tDCs than in cDCs, but lower than in pDCs. These results show that tDCs share multiple transcriptional regulators with pDCs.\n\nDistinct from cDCs, pDCs exhibit lymphoid characteristics independent of their myeloid or lymphoid origin, i.e., rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) D-J genes and expression of the pre-T cell receptor \u03b1 (PTCRA) Shigematsu et al., 2004) . Thus, we asked whether tDCs also bear these lymphoid characteristics. We detected IgH D-J rearrangement in pDCs, CD11c low tDCs, and CD11c high tDCs, but not in cDC2s or granulocytes ( Figure 5B ). As previously described, cDC1s have a very low frequency of rearrangement, which we detected sporadically (data not shown; Corcoran et al., 2003) . It is possible that some fraction of cells have rearrangements that were not detected, as the assay used can only detect arrangement with particular D H segments.\n\nWe next took advantage of transgenic mice that allow evaluation of PTCRA-EGFP at the single-cell level ( Figure 5C ; Shigematsu et al., 2004) . As expected, we detected strong PTCRA-EGFP labeling in pDCs, but not cDC1s or cDC2s. tDCs were also labeled with PTCRA-EGFP, and levels varied across the population, correlating with their phenotypic similarity to pDCs. Moreover, PTCRA-EGFP was detected in ~50%-90% of tDCs despite their high expression of Zbtb46 ( Figure 4B ), a TF usually associated with cDCs. Thus, comparable to bona fide pDCs, tDCs display several lymphoid characteristics such as a unique TF profile, IgH D-J rearrangements, and PTCRA-EGFP labeling.\n\nHuman tDCs have been suggested to be cDC precursors or pre-DCs (See et al., 2017) . However, different from cDCs, tDCs harbor lymphoid characteristics and require Tcf4 for their development, which is inconsistent with these cells being pre-DCs. To further analyze the relationship between tDCs and pre-DCs, we performed CyTOF profiling and unbiased analysis. We were unable to identify tDCs in the bone marrow (BM); thus, we first compared splenic tDCs with BM pre-DCs. We found that splenic tDCs did not overlap with BM pre-DCs in a tSNE map, indicating that they are phenotypically distinct ( Figure S5 ). Next, we analyzed the relationship between splenic tDCs and splenic pre-DCs, gated as Lin \u2212 CD11c high MHC class II \u2212 CD172a \u2212 CD135 + ( Figure 5D ; Liu et al., 2009) . Unbiased analysis revealed that splenic pre-DCs were heterogeneous and localized to various CD135 high areas of the tSNE map. Most pre-DCs mapped near cDC1s, and only a fraction of pre-DCs mapped with Cx3cr1 + tDCs in the tSNE map ( Figure 5D ). Furthermore, splenic pre-DCs were considerably less numerous than tDCs, and only 10% were encompassed within the total tDC population ( Figures 5E and 5F ). Closer phenotypic analysis revealed that ~60% of pre-DCs expressed either Xcr1 or CD11b, markers that tDCs lack ( Figures 1A  and 5G ). In addition, only ~40% of pre-DCs expressed Cx3cr1, which is expressed by all tDCs. Conversely, tDCs expressed variable levels of B220, MHC class II, and CD172a, which are excluded from the pre-DC definition. Finally, splenic tDCs express SiglecH, while splenic pre-DCs are mostly SiglecH \u2212 , as previously described (Figures 1A and 5D; Schlitzer et al., 2015) . Thus, our unbiased analysis revealed that there is minimal overlap between splenic tDCs and pre-DCs.\n\nAltogether, our findings show that tDCs follow a developmental program similar to pDCs and suggest that tDCs represent a distinct population of cells that are different from traditional pre-DCs.\n\nNext, we compared the functional capacities of mouse and human tDCs, i.e., their capacity to respond to Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation, secrete cytokines, and activate T cell proliferation. Following in vivo stimulation with the TLR9 agonist CpG-A, mouse pDCs displayed high levels of CD69, an early marker of lymphocyte activation, while MHC class II and CD86 were only slightly upregulated ( Figures 6A and S6 ). In contrast, both cDC2s and cDC1s strongly upregulated MHC class II and CD86, but not CD69. In accordance with their transitional phenotype, the CD11c low tDC fraction upregulated CD69 at comparable levels to pDCs, whereas the CD11c high fraction upregulated MHC class II and CD86 similar to cDCs. Human DC subsets behaved similarly when stimulated ex vivo with CpG-A; i.e., HLA-DR and CD86 were less upregulated in pDCs and scaled up from tDCs to cDCs ( Figure 6B ). Interestingly, we found that human tDCs were particularly efficient at upregulating the costimulatory marker CD80 upon CpG-A stimulation.\n\nIn accordance with their lower expression of IRF7 ( Figure 4C ), tDCs had lower capacity to produce IFN\u03b1 than pDCs. Mouse CD11c low tDCs, but not CD11c high tDCs, were able to produce IFN\u03b1, although to a lower extent than pDCs ( Figure 6C ). Similarly, human CD11c low tDCs, but not CD11c high tDCs, secreted very low levels of IFN\u03b1 ( Figure 6D ). We also evaluated tDC capacity to produce interleukin-12 (IL-12), a T H 1-activating cytokine suggested to be secreted by human tDCs (See et al., 2017; Villani et al., 2017) . We found that mouse tDCs were unable to secrete the active form IL-12p70 following stimulation with CpG-A or CpG-B, whereas all mouse DC subsets secreted low levels of this cytokine in response to imiquimod. However, we did detect the precursor subunit IL-12p40 in tDCs and cDCs following CpG-A stimulation ( Figure 6C ). We observed similar results in human; i.e., in our hands, pDCs and tDCs did not secrete IL-12p70 with either stimulation tested ( Figure  6D ). These results show that mouse and human tDCs have a limited capacity to produce IFN\u03b1 and IL-12p70.\n\nFinally, we compared the capacity of mouse and human tDCs to promote allogeneic T cell proliferation in a mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR). Both mouse and human freshly isolated pDCs expressed low levels of MHC class II/HLA-DR ( Figure 3C ) and consequently failed to promote the proliferation of allogeneic CD4 + T cells at steady state ( Figures 6E and 6F ). The antigen presentation capabilities of freshly isolated tDCs transitioned across the population, correlating with their phenotypic similarity to pDCs and cDCs. Altogether, these results indicate that tDCs' functional capabilities vary across the population, with CD11c low cells behaving more like pDCs and CD11c high cells behaving more like cDCs. These transitional functions of tDCs were similar in mouse and human, cementing their homology.\n\nWe found that tDCs are hardly present in tissues such as lung or skin at steady state, i.e., in the absence of inflammation ( Figure 7A ). The few lung and skin tDCs found by CyTOF expressed Tcf4, Pdcal, and Cx3cr1 but showed decreased expression of SiglecH compared with splenic tDCs (Figures S7A and S7B ). This observation is in accordance with a lack of tDCs in healthy human skin, as described (Alc\u00e1ntara-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2017) .\n\nWe then evaluated tDC accumulation in the lung during respiratory viral infection with influenza virus. Different from cDCs that migrate from the lung to local draining mediastinal LNs, pDCs are known to accumulate in the infected lung (Grayson et al., 2007; Helft et al., 2012) . Given their developmental similarities with pDCs, we hypothesized that tDCs will demonstrate similar behavior and accumulate in the lung during infection. B6 mice were infected intranasally with influenza (Flu PR8), and the course of infection was tracked by animal weight loss ( Figure 7B ). Before infection, cDC2s and cDC1s were represented in higher numbers than pDCs and tDCs in the lung. However, shortly after infection, lung cDC2 and cDC1 numbers decreased dramatically, whereas pDC and tDC numbers increased 2-to 3-fold ( Figures 7C and 7D ; see Figure S7C for the gating strategy). By days 4-6, pDCs and tDCs occupied more than 50% of the DC compartment. The loss of cDC1s and cDC2s in the lung corresponded to an increase in migratory cDCs in the lung-draining mediastinal LNs, with a peak at day 4 ( Figure 7D ). We did not observe accumulation of tDCs in mediastinal LNs, suggesting that these cells were not following the same migratory pattern as cDCs. Finally, we observed that both lung tDCs and pDCs upregulated the activation markers CD69, MHC class II, and CD86 ( Figure 7E ). We conclude that similar to pDCs, tDCs are recruited to the site of influenza infection and display an activated phenotype.\n\nSeveral pDC depletion models have been developed and show contradictory results regarding the role of pDCs during viral infection (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2007 Swiecki et al., 2013; Wolf et al., 2009) . However, it is unknown whether tDCs are also depleted in these models, which may account for inconsistent conclusions regarding the necessity of pDCs for anti-viral responses. Therefore, we evaluated tDC depletion in one prominent model, a transgenic mouse that expresses diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) under the promoter of the human pDC marker CLEC4C/BDCA2 (Swiecki et al., 2010) . We found that diphtheria toxin (DT) administration in CLEC4C DTR mice eliminated pDCs, but not tDCs, in the spleen and lung ( Figure 7F ). Furthermore, we did not find depletion of any other DC subset in this model, as previously described (data not shown; Swiecki et al., 2010) . We conclude that CLEC4C DTR mice are a good model for the specific depletion of pDCs without affecting tDC numbers.\n\nWe then used CLEC4C DTR mice to investigate the dynamics of tDC accumulation in the absence of pDCs during influenza infection ( Figure 7G ). Interestingly, pDC depletion did not alter the overall course of influenza infection or the accumulation of tDCs in the lung ( Figures 7H and 7I) . Similarly, cDC decrease from the lung was not impaired in the absence of pDCs ( Figure 7I ). However, we found that the absence of pDCs promoted a significant increase in lung Foxp3 + regulatory T (Treg) cells ( Figure 7J ). Consequently, the ratio of Treg cells to CD8 + and CD4 + T cells was significantly higher in pDC-depleted mice, suggesting that lung-recruited pDCs and tDCs may have different roles during influenza infection.\n\nIn this study, we provide formal proof of the existence of a population of mouse DCs closely related to pDCs and equivalent to the recently identified human AXL + DCs. We name this conserved population transitional DCs (tDCs) to reflect their heterogeneous phenotype and function, which span between pDCs and cDC2s. Our multifaceted analysis of the phenotype, transcriptome, and function of tDCs in mouse and human is a resource to further dissect the role of these cells in different diseases and ultimately move the field forward toward DCbased therapeutics.\n\nHuman and mouse tDCs share several characteristics: (1) a conserved gene expression profile;\n\n(2) expression of key TFs; (3) cellular heterogeneity showing a range of pDC to cDC phenotypes; (4) lower capacity than pDCs to produce IFN\u03b1; and (5) higher capacity than pDCs to promote allogeneic T cell proliferation. Because tDCs appear quite heterogeneous, we found it useful to divide them into two functional groups: CD11c low (pDC-like) tDCs and CD11c high (cDC-like) tDCs. However, we emphasize that this distinction was created for the purpose of characterizing tDC heterogeneity, and consequently, we do not consider these to be distinct developmental DC subsets.\n\nIn humans, tDCs can be distinguished from pDCs by their expression of AXL; however, we could not detect surface or intracellular Axl protein in mouse tDCs, indicating that this is not a shared characteristic. We found that mouse tDCs are best distinguished from pDCs by expression of Cx3cr1, a marker also expressed by human tDCs. A lack of concordance in DC subset-specific surface markers between human and mouse is well documented for other DC subsets (Vu Manh et al., 2015) . For example, Pdca1 (BST2) is a pDC-specific marker in mouse at steady state but is widely expressed in human immune cells (Blasius et al., 2006) . These differences may reflect divergent evolution, perhaps driven by species-specific pathogens. Because of these differences, it is imperative to consider a combination of phenotypic, functional, and transcriptional assays to establish cell-type homology between species, as we have done here. We found that mouse and human tDCs did share variable expression of CD2, CD5, CD81, and SIGLEC1. Despite these similarities, we could not identify any marker that unequivocally distinguished mouse tDCs from pDCs and cDCs, which is in accordance with their transitional phenotype. These results suggest that tDCs were probably overlooked when using gating strategies based on a few markers and illustrate the importance of using high-dimensional approaches to avoid oversimplification of the DC compartment. As shown here, high-dimensional approaches can be used to design simplified gating strategies for flow cytometry analysis and cell purification.\n\nAlthough further investigation of the origin of tDCs is required, we report several observations that link tDCs closely to pDCs. First, tDCs expressed the pDC lineage-defining TF TCF4. This TF is necessary for the development of both mouse and human pDCs and mouse tDCs, as demonstrated here (Cisse et al., 2008; Grajkowska et al., 2017; Nagasawa et al., 2008) . The developmental dependence of tDCs on Tcf4 is in accordance with a lack of noncanonical DCs in Tcf4 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Bar-On et al., 2010), cells that we show are included within the broader definition of tDCs. In addition, pDCs and tDCs shared expression of other TFs required for pDC development and function (e.g., BCL11A, IRF8, SPIB, and RUNX2), which are known to be upstream or downstream of the master regulator TCF4 (Ceribelli et al., 2016; Ghosh et al., 2010; Sawai et al., 2013) . Similar to pDCs, tDCs do not require IRF8 for their development, which is in contrast to cDC1s (Schiavoni et al., 2002; Sichien et al., 2016) . Altogether, the shared TF signature of pDCs and tDCs strongly indicates that their development likely progresses along a shared path.\n\nAnother observation that associates tDCs with pDCs is the presence of lymphoid characteristics: rearrangement of the IgH locus, which is a permanent change to the genomic DNA, and expression of PTCRA-EGFP. The presence of these features in pDCs was originally interpreted to be indicative of lymphoid origin. Indeed, analysis at the single-cell level has identified a lymphoid precursor that can give rise to pDCs (Dress et al., 2019; Rodrigues et al., 2018) . However, care should be taken when analyzing pDC lymphoid features, because these are also known to be carried by pDCs derived from myeloid progenitors (Corcoran et al., 2003; Sathe et al., 2013; Shigematsu et al., 2004) . Regardless of their lymphoid or myeloid origin, IgH rearrangement can be detected in pDCs and tDCs, which suggests that these cells are closely related developmentally. Similar developmental associations can be implied by the expression of PTCRA-EGFP in pDCs and tDCs. These lymphoid characteristics may result from their shared expression of Bcl11a, which controls RAG-1 expression (Lee et al., 2017) . Alternatively, they may be a consequence of an ectopic lymphoid program activated by TCF4, as previously suggested (Reizis, 2019) . We found that tDCs, especially CD11c high tDCs, simultaneously express PTCRA-EGFP and Zbtb46, a TF generally associated with cDCs. Zbtb46 expression has also been found in embryonicderived Langerhans cells , suggesting that this TF does not necessarily label a pre-DC developmental pathway but perhaps reveals the functional capabilities of the cells, as suggested (Meredith et al., 2012b) .\n\nThe exact developmental origin of tDCs also requires further study. It is possible that tDCs are generated as a byproduct of pDC development, as suggested for noncanonical DCs (Reizis, 2019) . Alternatively, tDCs may arise directly from pDCs. Indeed, pDCs are known to lose IFN-I production potential and increase antigen presentation capacity during stimulation (Palucka et al., 2005) , which are characteristics associated with tDCs. This pDC conversion, also called plasticity, has been observed for both human and mouse pDCs (Alc\u00e1ntara-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2017; Alculumbre et al., 2018; Grouard et al., 1997; Liou et al., 2008; Manh et al., 2013) . The identification of mouse and human tDCs creates an opportunity to explore pDC plasticity in vivo.\n\nThe observations that tDCs harbor lymphoid characteristics and depend developmentally on Tcf4 do not support the hypothesis that these cells are the traditional cDC precursor or pre-DCs, as previously suggested (See et al., 2017) . Using a high-dimensional alignment strategy at the protein level, we show that mouse tDCs have little to no overlap with splenic and BM pre-DCs. Furthermore, splenic tDCs express SiglecH, and SiglecH CRE RFP fl/fl reporter mice have limited (~0.5%) RFP labeling in cDCs (Puttur et al., 2013) . Similarly, DT administration to SiglecH DTR/DTR mice does not result in cDC depletion (Takagi et al., 2011) . Altogether, these observations support our conclusion that tDCs are a different population of cells distinct from pre-DCs. Future work will aim to trace tDC fate in health and infection.\n\nWe found limited numbers of tDCs in lung and skin at steady state. However, similar to pDCs, tDCs accumulate in the lung during infection, suggesting that these two cell types may have cooperative roles during anti-viral responses. Our in vitro data show that complementary IFN-I secretion and antigen presentation functions are enacted by pDCs and tDCs, respectively. Surprisingly, we found that tDCs are present in DT-treated CLEC4C DTR mice, which allowed us to assess their role in the absence of pDCs. We found that a lack of pDCs, but not tDCs, promotes an increase in the frequency of Treg cells during influenza infection. This observation suggests that tDCs may be suited to promote Treg cells in accordance with their superior antigen presentation capabilities. However, the role of pDCs during influenza infection appears to be pro-inflammatory. It remains to be determined why tDCs are not depleted in the CLEC4C DTR mice given that DTR expression is thought to be modulated by TCF4 in this model (Cisse et al., 2008; Swiecki et al., 2010) . Nevertheless, this finding points to the need to dissect whether tDCs are affected in other mouse models that have been used to evaluate pDC function. It is conceivable that tDCs, similar to pDCs, would be depleted when using anti-BST2 antibodies or SiglecH DTR models. Finally, to unequivocally identify the role of tDCs during immune responses, it is necessary to develop strategies to specifically deplete these cells without affecting pDCs or cDCs.\n\nIn summary, we identify and characterize a tDC population in mouse that mirrors the phenotype, function, and transcriptome of the recently defined human AXL + DCs (unified under the name tDCs). Although tDCs have been unappreciated until now, these cells most likely serve as the missing link to explain the range of functions previously associated with pDCs. Our in-depth characterization is a resource to understand the role of these cells in the context of infection, cancer, and autoimmunity and ultimately to harness pDCs and tDCs therapeutically.\n\nThis study did not generate new unique reagents.

For CyTOF analysis, cell suspensions were stained directly or enriched using a Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, Millipore Sigma) gradient. In brief, splenocytes were re-suspended in 3 mL of 30% BSA, and 1 mL of PBS was overlaid, then centrifuged at 1055 g for 30 minutes. For cell sorting of all DC subsets, whole spleen cell suspensions were incubated with anti-CD3 (KT3) and anti-CD19 (1D6) followed by negative selection with anti-rat Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Cells were sorted using a FACSAria II or FACSAria Fusion (BD Biosciences) at the Stanford Shared FACS Facility. All DC populations were first gated on live, singlets, lineage negative (CD3 \u2212 CD19 \u2212 CD20 \u2212 CD335 \u2212 CD66b \u2212 ) and monocyte negative (CD14 \u2212 CD16 \u2212 ). cDC1s were sorted as HLA-DR + CD123 \u2212 BDCA3 high . cDC2s were sorted as HLA-DR + CD123 \u2212 BDCA3-low CD11c + BDCA1 + . pDCs were sorted as HLA-DR + CD123 + BDCA1 \u2212 AXL \u2212 CD11c \u2212 . tDCs were gated as HLA-DR + CD123 + BDCA1 \u2212 AXL + and separated into CD11c \u2212 and CD11c + .

Anti-Clec9a and anti-TCF4 were labeled using the Alexa 647 Labeling Kit following manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or detected using anti-Rabbit-Alexa 647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were acquired on a 5-laser LSRFortessa X-20 (BD Biosciences), and data analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc). Unstained cells and single-fluoro-chrome-stained compensation beads (BD Biosciences) or cells were used for accurate compensation. Control samples included fluorescence minus one (FMO) for DC markers.\n\nMouse: Cell suspensions from spleen, lung, and skin were incubated with supernatant against CD16/CD32 (clone 2.4G2, produced in house) to block non-specific binding for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C.

Freshly isolated mouse (BSA-or Dynabeadenriched) splenocytes or thawed human mononuclear cells from blood and spleen were stained with 1 mL of 0.25 \u03bcM cisplatin (Fluidigm) for 5 minutes at room temperature to exclude dead cells. Cells were then washed with CyFACS buffer (2 mM EDTA, 1% BSA, 1% in PBS) and stained with heavy-metal-labeled Ab cocktail for 30 minutes on ice. Cells were washed twice with CyFACS then fixed with FoxP3 Transcription Factor Fix/Perm Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 hours. Human surface CyTOF Abs that were sensitive to FoxP3 buffer in our hands (i.e., CX3CR1, CD123, CD33, CD135, CD172a and CD163), were instead stained after fixation and permeabilization for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. After staining, samples were washed and incubated with 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron) in PBS containing 125 nM Iridium intercalator (Fluidigm) overnight.
