{"title": "A Cryptic Site of Vulnerability on the Receptor Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein", "body": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 marks the seventh coronavirus to be isolated from humans, and the third to cause a severe disease-named COVID-19-after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) . The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, and the grave risk it poses to global health, prompted the World Health Organization to declare, on 30 January 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern and on 11\n\nMarch 2020 to be a pandemic Zhou et al., 2020) . As of 13 March 2020, there have been nearly 140000 SARS-CoV-2 infections and more than 5000 associated deaths reported across at least 100 countries. The rapidly evolving epidemiology of the pandemic and absence of licensed prophylactics or therapeutics for the disease have accelerated the need to elucidate the molecular biology of this novel coronavirus.\n\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified virus, it shares genetic and morphologic features with others in the Coronaviridae family, particularly those from the Betacoronavirus genus. The genome of the recently isolated SARS-CoV-2 shares 82% nucleotide identity with human SARS-CoV and 89% with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 . The spike (S) glycoprotein, in particular, bears significant structural homology with SARS-CoV compared to other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV. Like SARS-CoV, the surface Spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds the same host receptor, ACE-2, to mediate cell entry (Letko et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020a) . S-a class I fusion protein-is also a critical determinant of viral host range and tissue tropism and the primary target of the host immune response (Li, 2016) . As such, most coronavirus vaccine candidates are based on S or one of its sub-components. Coronavirus S glycoproteins contain three segments: a large ectodomain, a single-pass transmembrane anchor and a short intracellular tail. The ectodomain consists of a receptor-binding subunit, S1, which contains two subdomains: one at the N-terminus and the other at the C-terminus. The latter comprises the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which serves the vital function of attaching the virus to the host receptor and triggering a conformational change in the protein that results in fusion with the host cell membrane through the S2 subunit. a CC0 license. author/funder.

The SARS-CoV RBD-2 compared to liganded (PDB ID: 2AJF) and unliganded (PDB ID: 2GHV) SARS-CoV RBD structures shows high structural similarity, except for residues 473-488 (Figure 1) . A chimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD structure (PDB ID: 6VW1) with 23 aa differences compared to SARS-CoV-2, in complex with human ACE-2 was recently released in the PDB. Comparisons with previously published structures with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD highlight residues 473-488 as an area with significant structural plasticity. In the RBD structure from this study, we observe electron density for two conformations of the 482-486 loop. One of these conformations is highly similar to the ligand bound form of the RBD, while the second conformation would clash with the ACE2 receptor. Both this structural detail of the unliganded RBD and comparison to previously described RBD structures indicates that this area of the RBD is structurally malleable with implications for antibody or small molecule therapeutics design.\n\nIn an effort to identify antibodies that could bind to SARS-CoV-2, we screened a set of SARS-CoV, (Tripp et al., 2005) and MERS CoV (Wang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015) RBD-reactive antibodies for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We demonstrated that the SARS-CoV mouse antibody 240CD (Tripp et al., 2005) had nanomolar (nM) affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and did not significantly block ACE-2 receptor binding (Figure 2 ). CR3022-a SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody (Tian et al., 2020) identified from a human phage-display library (ter Meulen et al., 2006) -also bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with nM affinity ( Figure 2B) . We assessed competition binding between 240CD and CR3022, and show that these antibodies cross-compete with each other for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Figure 2C, 2D) .\n\nSARS-CoV-2 has a likely zoonotic origin and horseshoe bats have been implicated as natural reservoirs of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Menachery et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2020) . As such, we next explored antibody cross-reactivity with the S glycoproteins of two bat SARS-related CoVs: SARSr-CoV Rs4874 (Ge et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015) and Rs4231 (Hu et al., 2017) , which are closely related to a CC0 license. author/funder.

CR3022 was able to recognize a recombinant Spike glycoproteins generated from bat SARSr-CoV Rs4874, while 240CD, and other mouse generated monoclonal antibodies have a mixed recognition phenotype ( Figure 2F ).\n\nThe antigenic cross-reactivity of this set of antibodies precipitated an investigation into their molecular recognition determinants. The potential relevance of a human antibody motivated the investigation to prioritize studies of CR3022, for which a sequence was available (ter Meulen et al., 2006) .\n\nThe CR3022 heavy chain is encoded by IGHV5-51*03, contains a 12-aa CDR H3 with 8 V gene-encoded residues altered by somatic hypermutation. CR3022 light chain is encoded by IGKV4-1*01 with 1 V geneencoded residue, altered by somatic hypermutation, and a 9-aa CDR L3 (Extended Data Figure 2A ). To provide an atomic-level understanding of the structure of the CR3022 antibody, we crystallized the antigenbinding fragment (Fab) of CR3022. Crystals diffracted to 3.2 \u00c5 resolution in space group P 21 (Table 1) .\n\nOverall the structure of the CR3022 Fab revealed a relatively flat antigen-combining site, with the exception of an extended protruding 12-aa CDR L1 loop ( Figure S2A ).\n\nTo determine the structure of CR3022 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we carried out crystallization conditions screening, with crystals of the CR3022-RBD complex forming in 1M Succinic acid, 0.1M Hepes pH 7, 2% PEG MME2000 and determined the crystal structure by X-ray diffraction to 4.25 \u00c5 ( Table 1 ). The complex structure was solved by molecular replacement using the refined CR3022 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD structures as search models and was refined to an Rwork/Rfree of 0.242/0.292 (Table   1) . CR3022 bound to the RBD at an epitope centered on S glycoprotein residues 377-386 with a total buried surface area of 871 \u00c5 (Figure 3, Figure S2 , and Table S1 ). This region is highly conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure S3) . Comparison of the CR3022 epitope site with previously described antibody-complex structures for SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV indicates that CR3022 describes a novel recognition site (Figure 3 and Figs. S3, S4) . Further sequence analysis of the epitope indicates that this epitope is conserved in betacoronavirus clade 2b, with also some similarity in clade 2d (Fig. S3) .

To date, there has been extensive structural characterization of the SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV spike molecule and domains, which provides a framework for understanding the novel SARS-CoV-2 spike molecule (Table S2 ). In the context of the coronavirus trimeric S glycoproteins, the RBD displays two prototypical conformations either in an \"up\" or \"down\" position, with implications for receptor binding and cell entry ( Table S1 ). To further analyze these conformations, we modeled the CR3022 binding to the trimeric structures of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The CR3022 epitope is occluded by adjacent spike protomers when the RBD is in the \"down\" conformation, but becomes more accessible when the spike is in a more open conformation here multiple RBD molecules are in the \"up\" conformation ( Figure 4) . There is still a clash of the antibody Fc1 region with the NTD from the same protomer, or an RBD from an adjacent protomer when modeled using the static structure.\n\nTo understand whether CR3022 could bind to SARS-CoV S glycoproteins, we measured binding to stabilized S-2P or non-stabilized versions of S (Figure 4) . We observed robust binding to the nonstabilized S glycoprotein, while binding to SARS S-2P Trimer was low. We then treated the SARS S-2P trimer with trypsin and/or incubation with the ACE2 receptor to assess whether minimal proteolytic action or receptor binding could increase the availability of the \"cryptic\" CR3022 epitope. Incubation of the stabilized S-2P trimer with human ACE2 did not dramatically affect CR3022 binding, while in contrast, the trypsin treatment of the S-2P protein resulted in increased binding akin to the unstabilized S glycoprotein binding, and the level of binding was titratable, with increasing amounts of S-2P resulting in higher CR3022 binding. Given the prior neutralization and protection studies utilizing CR3022, and its ability to complement potent neutralizing antibodies, it is likely that the CR3022 epitope represents a \"cryptic\" epitope that becomes exposed during the processes of viral cell entry.\n\nIn summary, our data represents the most detailed structural information for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to date and the first structure of the SARS-CoV-2 in complex with a human antibody. The presence of \"cryptic\" but protective epitopes for influenza (Bangaru et al., 2019) , and Ebola viruses (West et al., 2018) , have been previously described. The identification of a novel \"cryptic\" epitope for betacoronaviruses including SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 highlight a novel viral vulnerability that can be harnessed in combination with ACE2 receptor site targeting monoclonal antibodies for vaccine and therapeutic countermeasure development.\n\nThis work was supported by funding from the Defense Health Agency, as well as a cooperative agreement (Similar to 540C), NR-618.

The epitope is numbered according to the Wuhan reference; the strength of the interaction between the Ab and the spike protein is indicated by the height and color of the histogram bars above the sequence alignment. Sequences are ordered based on their phylogenetic relationships based on a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree derived from amino acid RBD sequences. The RBD structure is shown in surface representation and depicts mutations between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in red; the CR3022 epitope is outlined in white, with contact residues shown in stick representation. author/funder.
