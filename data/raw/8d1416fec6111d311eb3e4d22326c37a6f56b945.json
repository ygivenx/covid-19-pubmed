{"title": "Vi?ology Growth of fastidious adenovirus serotype 40 in HRT 18 cells: Interactions with E 1 A and E 1 B deletion mutants of subgenus C adenoviruses", "body": "Adenoviruses are important agents of infantile viral gastroenteritis and serotypes 40 and 41 (Ad40 and Ad41) are responsible for a large majority of cases [4] .\n\nIn spite of this pathogenicity, Ad 40 and Ad 4t have been discovered later than most of the serotypes due to their difficulty to be propagated in vitro. Contrary to conventional human adenoviruses, the so-called fastidious adenoviruses could not be serially passaged in primary cells such as human embryonic kidney cells (HEK) or human diploid fibroblasts [1] . However, successful growth of Ad 41 in primary cells in defined conditions has been recently reported [24] . Ad 40 and Ad 41 can replicate with variable success in human cell lines such as HeLa, Hep-2, KB and A 534 cells [7, 23, 25, 37] Replication of fastidious adenoviruses in human cell lines is thought to be grown to some extent in the Ad 5-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line 293 [16, 28] , which contains and expresses the Ad 5 early region E 1 [12] . This has led to the hypothesis that these viruses were defective in early regions E 1 A and E 1 B or in one of them and could be complemented by early gene functions of Ad 5 integrated in the genome of these cells [28, 19] .\n\nThe Ad2 E 1 A region gives rise to two major mRNAs (12S and 13 S). The polypeptides encoded by these mRNAs are identical except for an internal domain of 46 aminoacids within the largest product due to differential splicing of RNAs. Adenovirus mutants in E 1 A region that express only the 13 S gene product, replicate normally, are capable of trans-activating viral gene transcription and can immortalize primary rodent cells. Adenovirus mutants expressing only the 12 S gene product do not replicate in HeLa cells at tow multiplicity of infection (for review see [3, 11] ).\n\nAd 2 E 1 B region governs the synthesis at early times of two major polypeptides. A 22 S mRNA encodes a 19 k and a 55 k polypeptides. A 13 S mRNA encodes only the 19 k polypeptide. The 55 k polypeptide is essential for a complete lytic cycle in HeLa cells and is involved in accumulation of viral mRNA during productive infection. E 1 B mutants in 55 k polypeptide are altered in expression of early mRNAs and in DNA synthesis. Mutants in 19k cause a rapid cytopathic effect and induce degradation of host and viral DNAs [9, 27, 36] .\n\nThe nucleotide sequence of early regions E 1 A and E 1 B of fastidious adenoviruses has been determined [14, 34] . There is no major difference in the structure of E 1 A and E 1 B regions of nonfastidious and fastidious adenovir u s e s .\n\nAn increase of the replication of fastidious adenoviruses when cultivated in the presence of nonfastidious adenoviruses has been observed. 31] determined that Ad 2 could complement the growth of Ad41 in Chang conjunctival and HEF cells by measuring the rate of late antigens with monoclonal antibodies specific to Ad41.\n\nFor Ad 40, Mautner et al. [19] found that Ad 40 could be complemented in HeLa cells by E 1 B 55 K protein of nonfastidious adenoviruses.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the possible helper function of early regions E 1 A or E 1 B of nonfastidious adenoviruses in complementing DNA replication of Ad 40. We show that Ad 40 E 1 A region is functional. Coinfection assays of Ad40 with a nonfastidious adenovirus deleted in E 1 B region (d11520) led to an inhibition of the synthesis of both DNAs.\n\nHuman cell lines used were 293, HRT 18, an intestinal cell line [17] and HeLa. Monolayer cultures from these cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's medium containing 10% foetal bovine serum and divided twice a week at an appropriate subculture ratio.\n\nAd5d13t2 is a deletion mutant lacking E 1 A activity [15] . d11520 is a hybrid Ad 2/Ad 5 E 1 B mutant which does not synthesize E 1 B 55 K protein and shows a reduced rate of E 1 B 19K protein synthesis [2] .\n\nStocks ofdl 1520 and Ad 5 dl 312 were prepared in 293 cells, stock ofAd 2 WT (prototype strain provided by Dr. J. F. Williams, Pittsburg, Pa. ) was made in HeLa cells. These viruses were purified as previously described [10] . Stock of Ad40 (prototype strain Dugan) was obtained in HRT 18 cells after 10 passages of the virus in this cell line. Stock of Ad 40 was maintained as a crude extract after freezing and thawing of cell cultures three times.\n\nTiters of Ad 40, d11520 and Ad 5 d1312 stocks on 293, HRT 18 and HeLa cells, were determined at 48 h post-infection, by a fluorescent focus assay as previously described [10] , using as first antibody a rabbit polyclonal anti-Ad 2 raised against purified virions and as a second antibody, fluorescein conjugated sheep anti-rabbit immunoglobulin. Titers were expressed as fluorescent focus units per ml (FFU/ml).\n\nAd 40 infected cultures were freezed and thawed three times then serially diluted and tested for adenovirus antigens by ELISA as previously described [22] .\n\nCell monolayers of 293, HRT 18 or HeLa grown in 25cm 2 flasks were single or double infected with virus stocks. The input virus concentration, expressed in FFU/cell, was variable. Virus inocula were adsorbed for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. After this time, medium containing 2% foetal bovine serum was added. Each infected culture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C until total cytopathic effect (CPE). In cases of absence of CPE, infected cells were recovered after 8 days.\n\nViral DNAs were extracted from 5 x 106 infected cells using the Hirt [13] procedure modified by Wadelt and de Jong [35] . Half of the extracted DNA was digested by Hind III restriction endonuclease and electrophoresed in a 0.8% agarose horizontal slab gel in Tris-Borate buffer at 50 V. Gels were stained in ethidium bromide and photographed under short UV light.\n\nTotal RNA was prepared from mock-infected and from Ad 40 infected HRT 18 cells at 24 h post-infection by the acid guanidinum thiocyanate extraction method [6] .\n\ncDNA synthesis and PCR amplification cDNA synthesis was performed using random primers (Gene Amp RNA PCR kit, Perkin Elmer Cetus). PCR amplification was carried out with oligodeoxynucleotides representing nucleotides 2485 to 2506 (5' end) and the complementary sequence from nucleotides 3018 to 3039 (3' end) of the Ad 40 sequence [34] . These primers were purchased from Eurogentec S. A. and purified by HPLC chromatography. The amplification reaction was performed with Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) in 40 cycles of DNA denaturation (94 \u00b0C, 1 min), annealing (55 \u00b0C, t rain) and elongation (72 \u00b0C, 3 rain). Amplified DNAs were electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel.\n\nHuman cell lines 293, HRT 18, and HeLa were tested for their capability to support growth of Ad40. HRT 18 is a cell line derived from human rectal adenocarcinoma [321 and was chosen because it is permissive to bovine enteric fastidious coronavirus [17] . To estimate virus growth in each cell line, the rate of Ad antigens in cultures was measured after three serial passages by ELISA. In 293 and HeLa cells, antigen levels were very low and the virus was not readily propagated. HRT 18 cell line gave a higher level of Ad40 antigens, although Ad 40 grew more slowly than nonfastidious adenoviruses. Total cytopathic effect was observed after 6 -7 days post-infection. A reference stock of the virus was then prepared in this cell line after several additional passages.\n\nReference stocks of mutants Ad 5 dl 312 [15] and dl 1520 [21 showing large deletions in transcription units E 1 A and E 1 B, respectively, were prepared in 293 cells.\n\nEach reference stock was titrated on 293, HRT 18, and HeLa cell lines. Results are shown in Table 1 . The titer of Ad 5 dl 312 mutant of HeLa cells was about 105-fold lower than on 293 cells. This was in agreement with the results published by Jones and Shenk [15] . The titers of Ad 5 dl 312 mutant in HRT 18 and HeLa cells were of the same order of magnitude. The titer of E 1 B mutant dl 1520 was 6-fold and 100 fold lower on HRT 18 and HeLa cells, respectively, than on 293 cells. For Ad 40, the difference between the titers obtained in the three cell lines during the first passage was less significant. Ad 40 behaved neither as an adenovirus mutated in E 1 A 13 S mRNA nor as an E 1 B mutant lacking 55 k protein.\n\nTo determine if a complementation could occur between Ad 40 and Ad 5 dl 312 or d11520, coinfection assays with Ad40 and deletion mutants were carried out. The synthesis of viral DNAs in infection and coinfection assays was vis- Viruses were titrated at 48 h post-infection by fluorescent focus assay [10] . Titers are expressed in focus forming units per ml (FFU/ml) ualized after electrophoresis on agarose gel of Hirt extracted DNAs digested by Hind III restriction enzyme.\n\nThe cells were first single infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1 FFU/cetl. This m.o.i, was calculated from reference stocks titrated in the most permissive cells, i.e., HRT 18 for Ad40, 293 for the mutants. At this m.o.i., a clear restriction pattern of Hirt extracted DNAs was seen only with the most permissive cell line (Fig. 1) .\n\nCoinfection assays of Ad 40 and deletion mutants were performed in HRT 18, 293 and HeLa cells. from 1 FFU/cell (Fig. 2 A) to 10,000 FFU/cell (Fig. 2 B and C) . After infection of 1 FFU/cell of Ad 5 dl 312 in HRT 18 cells, the restriction pattern of this virus was not visible (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) . Restriction patterns obtained in Ad 40 single infection (Fig. 2 A, lane 3) and in coinfection Ad 40 + Ad 5 dl 312 (Fig. 2 A, lane  2) were identical. At low m.o.i., no effect of one virus on DNA viral synthesis of the other virus was therefore observed. With 10,000 FFU/cell of Ad 5 d1312 in HRT 18, the restriction pattern of Ad 5 d1312 was visible in single infection (Fig. 2 B, lane 1) . Although the cells were washed before the viral DNA extraction, it could not be ruled out that the inoculum could be responsible for visible restriction pattern. As a control, a similar experiment was performed in which viral DNA extraction was made 1 h post infection. In this case, no visible band was seen after digestion with restriction enzyme. In coinfection assays, the restriction pattern of Ad 5 dl 312 was enhanced but Ad 40 DNA was absent (Fig. 2 B, lane 2) . With 10,000 FFU/ cell of Ad5d1312 in HeLa cells, the same phenomenon of enhancement of Ad 5 dl 312 DNA was observed by coinfection assays (Fig. 2 C, lane 2) although the restriction pattern of Ad 40 was not visible in single infection (Fig. 2C, lane 3).\n\nThese experiments indicated that Ad 40 could complement E 1 A functions from deletion mutant Ad5d1312 in HRT 18 and HeLa cells, and that this complementation was dependent on the input concentration of Ad 5dl 312. At high m.o.i, ofAd 5 dl 312, Ad 40 was able to stimulate the synthesis ofAd 5 dt 312 DNA although its own DNA disappeared in coinfection assays. In HeLa cells the restriction pattern of Ad 40 could not be visualized, but a similar enhancement of the synthesis of Ad 5 dl 312 DNA was observed when the two viruses were present.\n\nTo determine if Ad 40 could also stimulate the growth of a mutant deleted in the E 1 B region, coinfection assays of Ad 40 with dl t 520 were performed. The m.o.i, of Ad 40 and d11520 was 1 FFU/cell. A clear restriction pattern ofd11520 was visible when the virus was infected in 293 cells (Fig. 3 A, lane 1) . The bands visible on Fig. 3 B, lane 1 (dl 1520 grown in HRT 18 cells) result from leakage of this mutant (see Table 1 ). For Ad 40, a clear restriction pattern was observed in HRT 18 (Fig. 3 B, lane 3) . In coinfection assays with dl 1520 and Ad 40 both DNAs disappeared in 293 and HRT 18 cells (Fig. 3 A and B, lanes 2) .\n\nIn a similar manner, coinfection assays with Ad 2 and dl 1520 were performed in HRT 18 cells to determine if d11520 was able to inhibit DNA synthesis of nonfastidious adenovirus or if this inhibition was specific of fastidious Ad 40. Results of this assay are shown in Fig. 4 , lane 2. No inhibition of Ad 2 DNA by d11520 was observed. A faint band of DNA visible under Hind III-B band of Ad 2 revealed the presence of d11520 DNA. As expected, this virus was therefore complemented by Ad 2. \n\nIn the present study, we were able to cultivate Ad 40 in a human intestinal cell line, H R T 18, which has not been transformed in vitro by adenovirus genes.\n\nFrom an Ad40 stock obtained in H R T 18 cells, there was a modest difference for antigen production during the first passage between H R T 18, HeLa and 293 cell lines (Table 1) Mautner et al. [19] have detected by slot blot hybridization a complementation of Ad40 growth by Ad5d1312 and vice versa in HeLa cells. Due to relatively low yields of Ad40, these authors were not able to obtain visible restriction patterns of Hirt extracted DNA. We also used slot blot hybridization (results not shown) and found an amount of Ad 40 DNA lower in cells coinfected by Ad 5 d1312 and Ad 40 than in cells infected with Ad40 only. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the Ad40 reference stocks have not been obtained in the same cell line.\n\nTo know if Ad 40 could complement a nonfastidious adenovirus mutated in E 1 B transcription unit, coinfection of Ad 40 and d11520 was performed. Surprisingly, this coinfection led to an inhibition of DNA synthesis of both viruses. As a control, cells were coinfected with dl 1520 mutant and Ad 2 wild type. No inhibition of Ad 2 DNA synthesis was observed. Furthermore, dl 1520 was complemented by Ad 2 (Fig. 4, lane 2) . We do not presently know the reasons of the mutual inhibition between Ad 40 and dl 1520. Interactions between two adenoviruses lacking E 1 B products should not lead to an inhibition of the DNA synthesis of both viruses. Several findings have suggested that Ad40 E 1 B region is transcribed in an unusual manner [18, 26] although it is structurally similar to E 1 B region of nonfastidious adenoviruses [341. The presence of unusual E 1 B proteins of Ad 40 associated with viral or cellular factors might explain the inhibition of d11520 DNA synthesis in coinfection experiments. Our PCR results show that at least one mRNA is synthesized in a region corresponding to the 55 k messenger of nonfastidious adenoviruses. To know why dl 1520 DNA synthesis is inhibited by Ad 40, further experiments are necessary to detect and characterize the Ad 40 E 1 B mRNAs and proteins."}
