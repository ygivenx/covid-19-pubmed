{"title": "Analysis of Synonymous Codon Usage in Aeropyrum pernix K1 and Other Crenarchaeota Microorganisms", "body": "In most cases, the alternative synonymous codons for any amino acid are not randomly used [1, 2] . Studies of the synonymous codon usage can reveal information on molecular evolution of individual genes, which provides data to improve gene recognition algorithms, is utilized to design DNA primers, and detects horizontal transfer events [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Several factors, such as compositional constraints [8, 9, 10] , translational selection [11] [12] [13] , and the mutational bias [14] , influence the pattern of gene codon usage bias. Furthermore, it is reported that the codon usage variations are also corrected with the protein secondary structure [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , cellular location of gene products [21] , and the gene function [22] [23] [24] .\n\nAeropyrum pernix K1, as a subtype of Crenar-chaeota microorganism, was isolated from a coastal solfataric (volcanic hydrothermal area that emits sulfuric gases) thermal vent at Kodakara-Jima Island, Japan in 1993. This organism is highly motile. Cells of A. pernix K1 are coccoid and are often surrounded by pili-like appendages. A. pernix K1 grows between 70 and 100\u2103 with optimal growth at 90-95\u2103. Although the genomic sequence of A. pernix K1 has been published [25] , little genomic analysis is available on this microorganism. In this study, the synonymous codon usage of this microorganism is analyzed and a comparison is made with the other two phylogenetically related Crenarchaeota microorganisms (i.e., Pyrobaculum aerophilum str. IM2 and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM 639).\n\nwww.jgenetgenomics.org\n\nThe complete genomes and the coding sequences of A. pernix K1 and two other Crenarchaeota microorganisms, including P. aerophilum str. IM2 and S. acidocaldarius DSM 639, were extracted from the NCBI Refseq project (Accession No. NC_000854, NC_003364, NC_007181, respectively).\n\nThe sequence similarity is not enough to separate the orthologous genes from paralogous genes. So, only five genes with the similar names were selected from among the microorganisms, as orthologous genes, to investigate whether there was a correlation between the gene function and the codon usage bias. The five orthologous genes are shown in Table 1 .\n\nTo examine synonymous codon usage without the confounding influence of amino acid composition of different gene samples, the values of relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of different codons in each sequence were calculated. The RSCU value of the jth codon for the ith amino acid was calculated by\n\nwhere obs ij is the observed number of the jth codon for the ith amino acid, which has n i type of synonymous codons. It is obvious that RSCU values close to 1.0 indicate a lack of bias for the corresponding codon [26] .\n\nGC 3S content: GC 3S is the frequency of the nucleotide G + C at the synonymous third position of the codons, excluding Met, Trp, and the termination codons. It is a good indicator of the extent of base composition bias.\n\nThe ENC of a gene is generally used to quantify the codon usage bias of a gene, which is essentially independent of gene length. The ENC value is calculated as [27] : ENC = 2 + 9/F 2 + 1/F 3 + 5/F 4 + 3/F 6 (2) In formula 2, F 2 is the probability, where two randomly chosen codons for an amino acid with two codons are identical. It is similar for F 3 , F 4 , and F 6 . Recent comparative simulation study has shown that it is the best overall means to estimate the absolute synonymous codon usage bias [28] . Values of ENC range from 20 (when only one codon is used per amino acid) to 61 (when all synonymous codons are equally used for each amino acid). The expected ENC value under random codon usage can be calculated for any value of GC 3s as:\n\nWhere, s represents the given GC 3S value. The values of ENC would fall on the continuous curve described in formula 3, if the G + C composition at the synonymous third position is the only determinant factor shaping the codon usage.\n\nPCA was used to investigate the major trend in codon usage variation among the genes. The RSCU values of genes were plotted in a multidimensional space of 59 axes (excluding Met, Trp, and stop codons) and PCA identified a series of new orthogonal axes accounting for the greatest variation among genes.\n\nThe principle of hierarchical clustering is as follows. First, each sequence is considered as a separate class. Then, according to the distance between these sequences, the two sequences that have the minimum distance are amalgamated into one class. The distances between selected sequences were calculated using the Euclidean distance method. The calculating formula is:\n\nAfter the amalgamation, distances between the amalgamated class and other classes are calculated again. This process is continued until all the sequences are amalgamated to one class. During this process, the RSCU values of all the codons RSCU ij are considered to be different variable components for a certain se-quence and also as a single spot in the multidimensional space. Tryptophan (Trp, W) and Methionine (Met, M) are not considered because each contained only one codon and their RSCU values were always equal to 1. Three stop codons were excluded, so the dimension number of this space is 59.\n\nThe program CodonW 1.4 (http://codonw. sourceforge.net/) was used for calculating the indices of codon usage. The statistical analysis was implemented using SPSS 11.0.1. for Windows (2001. Chicago: SPSS Inc.)\n\nThe overall RSCU values of 59 sense codons in A. pernix K1 is shown in Table 2 . Most preferentially used are C-ended or G-ended codons, among which 12 C-ended codons and 5 G-ended codons were against 1 A-ended codon and nil U-ended codons. A. pernix K1 is a GC-rich genome with the GC content over 56%. Due to compositional constraints, it is expected that C-ended and/or G-ended codons are preferentially used in this genome.\n\nAlthough the overall RSCU values in a genome could unveil the codon usage pattern of a whole genome, it may hide certain codon usage variation among different genes in a genome. Two important codon usage indices, ENC and GC 3S , have been widely used to study the codon usage variation among different genes. The distributions of ENC and GC 3S values in A. pernix K1 are shown in Fig.1 It was reported that a plot of ENC against GC 3S can be effectively used to explore the heterogeneity of codon usage among genes [27] . If the codon usage pattern of the genes has certain influence other than the GC content, the comparison of the actual distribution of genes with the expected distribution under no selection could be indicative. In other words, if GC 3S is the only determinant factor shaping the codon usage pattern, the values of ENC would fall on a continuous curve, which represents random codon usage [29] . Fig.2 shows the distribution plot of ENC against GC 3S for A. pernix K1. The points in the plot were quite spread out and the bulk of genes did not appear to follow the theoretical curve, which suggests that there are other factors that contributed to the codon usage pattern in A. pernix K1 besides the genomic composition. To further investigate the correlation between synonymous codon usage bias and nucleotide composi-tion, the linear regression analysis was implemented. The R 2 value and the significance level of these re-gression analyses are listed in Table 3 . There was a significant correlation between GC 3S content and the first two main PCA axes of RSCU in A.pernix K1 and other two Crenarchaeota microorganisms. Therefore, it is unquestionable that base compositional constraints are the major source determining the codon usage in the whole genome of these microorganisms. \n\nTo investigate the synonymous codon usage variation among A. pernix K1 and other two phylogenetically related Crenarchaeota microorganisms, the codon usage data of genes in three microorganisms was also calculated. Principal component analy- www.jgenetgenomics.org are located on the left side of the plot. Hence, synonymous codon usage appears to be conserved be tween phylogenetically related Crenarchaeota microorganisms.\n\nTo show whether there is a correlation between the codon usage of the three microorganisms and their strains, the genes from each microorganism were divided into two groups according to the strain. Principal component analysis was implemented for each genome of the three microorganisms. The t-test was used to test whether the separation of groups was significant. The P-values were greater than 0.05 both on the first axis and the second axis in A. pernix K1, P. aerophilum str. IM2, and S. acidocaldarius DSM 639. This suggests that the codon usage pattern in Crenarchaeota microorganisms is not strain specific.\n\nIf translational selection also contributed to the codon usage bias in genes, the extent of codon usage bias in structural genes, such as translation elongation factors and ribosomal proteins, should be larger than that in nonstructural genes. There is an inclination that the highly expressed genes seem to have more bias among A. pernix K1 and P. aerophilum str. IM2. In A. pernix K1, the ENC values of structural genes varied from 26.71 to 52.99, with a median of 40.69, a mean value of 40.61, and S.D. of 6.00. While the nonstructural genes varied from 27.99 to 61.00, with a median of 44.67, a mean value of 44.81 and S.D. of 6.27. In S. acidocaldarius DSM 639, the mean ENC values of the structural genes is approximately 8.8% lower that of the nonstructural genes. However, in P. aerophilum str. IM2, the ENC values of the structural and the nonstructural genes are roughly the same with differences smaller than 0.4% (Fig. 4) .\n\nTo further analyze the relationship between the gene expression level and the extent of the codon bias, the t-test was performed. The results indicated that the extent of codon bias of the structural genes was significantly different from that of the nonstructural genes in A. pernix K1 and S.vacidocaldarius DSM 639 with P-values below 0.0001. But in P. aerophilum str. IM2, the translational selection pressure seemed to have no effect on the codon usage bias with P-value of 0.67. It can be concluded that the translational selection pressure plays an important role in forming the codon usage bias in A. pernix K1 and S. acidocaldarius DSM but not in P. aerophilum str. IM2.\n\nSince all the three microorganisms contain gene coding for gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, replication factor C small subunit, replication factor C large subunit, acyl-CoA synthase, and DNA polymerase \u2161, these gene groups were selected to investigate whether a correlation existed between codon usage and gene function. The hierarchical cluster result of the 15 genes, as shown in Fig.5 , indicated that the genes within the same microorganisms are clustered together with only one exception marked by the ellipse. Thus, it was concluded that it is the species rather than the gene function that determines the gene codon among the Crenarchaeota microorganisms.\n\nAmong microorganisms, the most accepted hypothesis for the unequal usage of synonymous codons states that it is the result of the mutational biases and natural selection acting at the level of translation.\n\nThe analysis revealed that the synonymous codon usage bias in A. pernix K1 was less biased, which was highly correlated with the GC 3S value. Comparative analysis of A. pernix K1 and the other two Crenarchaeota microorganisms (P. aerophilum str. IM2 and S. acidocaldarius DSM 639) indicated that the synonymous codon usage in Crenarchaeota mi The capital letters (A, B, and C) represent Aeropyrum pernix K1, Pyrobaculum aerophilum str. IM2, and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM 639, respectively. The numbers followed by the capital letters represent the five gene products (i.e., gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, replication factor C small subunit, replication factor C large subunit, acyl-CoA synthase, and DNA polymerase \u2161, respectively).\n\nwww.jgenetgenomics.org www.jgenetgenomics.org crobial genomes was phylogenetically conservative. Itwas reported that for certain species, the gene function plays a major role in the gene codon usage pattern [23] . However, in the analysis, the species is more important than the gene function in determining the gene codon usage pattern in the Crenarchaeota microorganisms. A. pernix K1, P. aerophilum str. IM2, and S. acidocaldarius DSM 639 exist in differently extreme conditions. It was presumed that the living environment is important in determining the codon usage pattern of these microorganisms.\n\nBesides, there is no strain-specific codon usage among the microorganisms. The extent of codon bias in A. pernix K1 and S. acidocaldarius DSM 639 was highly correlated with the gene expression level, while no such association was detected in P. aerophilum str. IM2 genomes.\n\nThe codon usage pattern among the species is a complex phenomenon, which is affected by many factors. It is more than a mutation and selection trade-off problem. The disclosure of its inherent rules is significant for understanding the evolution of the species."}
