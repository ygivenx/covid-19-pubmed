{"title": "L 565 M mutation in HIV-1 glycoprotein 41 stabilizes the coiled-coil structure", "body": "The ectodomain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) glycoprotein 41 (gp41) has been investigated as a part of the spike protein directly related to the cell fusion of virus, and it consists of fusion protein (FP), N-terminal heptad repeats (NHR), interdomain fusion protein (IFP), C-terminal heptad repeats (CHR), and other regions [1] . Studies by electron microscopy [2] [3] [4] demonstrated that the spike protein of HIV-1 formed a trimer complex in fusion process. In addition, molecular structure analyses [5] [6] [7] revealed that NHR and CHR had similar helical conformations packed in an anti-parallel manner, and that the three pairs of NHR and CHR in a trimer gp41 were arranged tightly in a trimeric coiled-coil. Three NHR regions were coiled in the inner side and the three CHR regions covered the NHR coil on the outer side. This coiled-coil complex could be constructed by conformational changes of glycoprotein 120 interacting with CD4 and CXCR4 coreceptor [8, 9] . Formation of the coiled-coil causes the viral envelope to approach the target cell membrane via tight binding, and allows membrane fusion associated with rapid entry of the viron core into the target cell [1, 10, 11] . Thus, the NHR-CHR interactions are very important for investigating the fusion mechanism of the virus entry process and for designing the inhibitors against the cell fusion.\n\nOne complicating fact is that HIV-1 is genetically variable [12] . Among HIV-1 genome, env gene has been widely used for the classification by phylogenetic analysis [13] . Based on the sequence of complete viral genomes [14] , HIV-1 nucleotide sequences circulating in the world have been divided into three groups: M [15, 16] , and the similarities among these subtypes are distributed widely [17, 18] . It was also reported that homologous synthetic peptides of the NHR and CHR regions, called N34 and C34, had binding activities to CHR and NHR, respectively [19] [20] [21] . Therefore, these synthetic peptides play an important role as experimental tools for studies of cell fusion and its inhibition because of the affinities to gp41.\n\nWe have studied the fusion mechanism to identify the important factors for the design of inhibitors, and reported that strain MT-4/17-3-6 [22] from a Japanese patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) showed stronger resistance against both N34 and C34 peptides than other strains, MT-4/LAI, L-2, and CU98-26 [23] . In this article, to investigate the basis of the resistance of MT-4/17-3-6, an NHR-CHR complex model was predicted stereo-chemically by molecular modeling with energy minimization and dynamics simulation. We compared it with MT-4/LAI model, especially focusing the central region of the coiled-coil, which was not markedly affected by any other parts of the envelope protein. This central region includes the M 565 of MT-4/17-3-6, which is mutated distinctively from the L 565 of MT-4/LAI, L-2 and CU98-26. The amino acid sequences of NHR and CHR of these strains are summarized in Table 1 .\n\nMolecular modeling of MT-4/17-3-6 NHR-CHR complex. The initial model for the MT-4/17-3-6 complex was constructed by using of residue replacements on the coordinate sets 1AIK in Protein Data Bank [5] , a NHR-CHR complex X-ray model of MT-4/LAI. Structural optimization was performed for this model by an energy minimization method with an MMFF94 force field [24] considering water molecules within 10 \u00c5 around protein atoms. The energy cutoff distance was set at 10 \u00c5 and the dielectric constant was distance dependent based on the value of 1.0 for the protein atoms and 80.0 for the solvent atoms. The 1AIK X-ray model of MT-4/LAI was optimized for comparison with the MT-4/ 17-3-6 model by the same method.\n\n100 ps molecular dynamics simulation was performed for each optimized model with the water molecules at 300 K by using a 0.002 ps time step, the MMFF94 force field and NVT method (number of particles, volume, and temperature were fixed) [25] [26] [27] . Before these equilibrium iterations, 1ps heating iterations were employed to consider the stable equilibration. The potential energy of each total molecular system after the 100 ps simulation was \u00c05.85 \u00b7 10 4 kcal/mol and \u00c05.67 \u00b7 10 4 kcal/mol, including 3233 and 3252 water molecules for MT-4/17-3-6 and MT-4/LAI, respectively. Hydrogen bond analyses were based on 100 conformations sampled every 0.5 ps during the equilibrium iterations from 50 to 100 ps, in which the potential energy seemed to settle down clearly.\n\nAll operations and calculations were performed using a graphical package for molecular structure analyses, Molecular Operating Environment (CCG, http://www.ccg.com/).\n\nA possible structure of the MT-4/17-3-6 NHR-CHR complex predicted from energy minimization is shown in Fig. 1A . We found three sets of hydrogen bond bridges which seemed to fix the complex effectively. The bridge consisted of three hydrogen bonds of Y 638 O g -H 564 N d1 , H 564 N e2 -E 560 O d1 and E 560 O d2 -Q 650 N e2 , and three of the bridges enclosed the complex on its surface. The alignment of functional groups in the bridge was seemed to be similar to the charge relay system of serine protease active sites. In the structure of the MT-4/LAI NHR-CHR complex, shown in Fig. 1B , only E 560 O d2 -Q 650 N e2 was formed and Y 638 O g -H 564 N d1 and H 564 N e2 -E 560 O d1 were not formed. Especially, the phenyl ring of Y 638 and the imidazole ring of H 564 existed side by side, but O g and N d1 or N e2 were not placed where they could form a hydrogen bond. The sidechain of H 564 in the MT-4/17-3-6 complex shifted slightly to the outer side of the complex compared with the MT-4/LAI complex, and it was thought that the formation of hydrogen bonds of Y 638 O g -H 564 N d1 and H 564 N e2 -E 560 O d1 was enable by this shift. The total interaction energy between NHR and CHR was \u00c04.52 \u00b7 10 2 kcal/mol in MT-4/17-3-6 and \u00c04.05 \u00b7 10 2 kcal/mol in MT-4/LAI; thus, the NHR and CHR of MT-4/17-3-6 were combined more strongly than these of MT-4/LAI. The statistical analyses of the formation of these hydrogen bonds during the later iterations of the molecular dynamics simulations are summarized in Table 2 , and a superimposed stereo view of the most stable structure in the simulations is shown in Fig. 2 . In the MT-4/ 17-3-6 complex, hydrogen bonds were formed in the conformation with probabilities of 82.3% and 59.7% for Y 638 O g -H 564 N d1 and H 564 N e2 -E 560 O d1 respectively, which are very high probabilities compared with these for MT-4/LAI. Just beside H 564 , the L 565 M mutation was found in MT-4/17-3-6 compared with MT-4/LAI. In the MT-4/LAI complex, as shown by dark blue and green sticks in Fig. 2 , the L 565 sidechain contacted CHR sidechains of I 635 and I 642 by hydrophobic interaction, and this interaction was fixed tightly by the existence of a hydrogen bond between Q 567 and T 639 . On the other hand, in the MT-4/17-3-6 complex, as shown by orange and yellow sticks, a longer hydrophobic sidechain of M 565 existed instead of the shorter sidechain of leucine. Two isoleucines, glutamine and threonine in the MT-4/17-3-6 complex remained at the same positions in the MT-4/LAI complex and fixed the sidechain of methionine. In addition, the I 635 residue, especially its sidechain, was close to the sidechain of M 565 because of loss of the branched structure in the sidechain L 565 .\n\nWe found that H 564 in the NHR was pushed to the outer side in the MT-4/17-3-6 complex, and three hydrogen bond bridges of Y 638 -H 564 -E 560 -Q 650 could be formed and seen to enclose the coiled-coil. As shown in detail in Fig. 2 , the structural difference from the MT-4/LAI complex in this region was that the M 565 mainchain and the H 564 of NHR were pushed to the outer side (from dark blue to orange) and the neighboring Y 638 and T 639 of CHR were shifted to the opposite direction (from green to yellow). As a result, the imidazole ring of H 564 in the MT-4/17-3-6 complex was placed in the position and direction where it could be stabilized by hydrogen bonds with both Y 638 in the CHR region and E 560 in the same NHR region.\n\nWe tentatively optimized another virtual model with mutation of only L 565 M from MT-4/LAI, and also found similar Y 638 -H 564 hydrogen bonds as in the MT-4/17-3-6 model (data not shown). As shown in Table 1, E 630 Q, S 641 G, and N 651 I mutations were found distinctively in the CHR region of MT-4/17-3-6, but all of these residues were placed on the outer side, which had no direct interaction with the inner NHR coils. S 641 G and N 651 I were adjacent to Y 638 and Q 650 . It seemed that these mutations might contribute to the formation of hydrogen bond bridges by increasing the flexibilities of the neighboring mainchain of Y 638 and decreasing the hydrogen bonding to the Q 650 sidechain via water molecules, respectively. Therefore, it was thought that the L 565 M mutation would be a major factor affecting the coiled-coil stabilization by these bridges, and the binding of peptide fusion inhibitors might be distinctively disturbed by this stabilization in MT-4/17-3-6. The parallel stacking of two rings of H 564 and Y 638 was also found in the X-ray structure [7] , but no hydrogen bond between these sidechains was shown in the structure, because the two rings were placed too closely, as was also true in the MT-4/LAI model. We think that the hydrogen bond between H 564 and Y 638 fixes the sidechain of H 564 in the position that makes it easy to form the next hydrogen bond with E 560 , and that the positional relationship of the two rings is very important for the total formation of the hydrogen bond bridges shown in the model for MT-4/17-3-6.\n\nCoiled-coil trimeric structures are commonly found in the spike proteins of not only HIV but also other corona viruses, including influenza virus, Ebola virus, and SARS virus [28] . In these coiled-coil structures, it seemed that HIV had the most tightly combined complex of NHR and CHR, and therefore the mode of interaction between NHR and CHR of HIV may be most effective for the trimeric formation at the time of virus attack. We found in our previous research that the differences of gp41 resistance to peptide fusion inhibitors were larger for intra-subtype comparisons, such as MT-4/LAI and MT-4/17-3-6, than for inter-subtype comparisons, such as MT-4/LAI and CU98-26 (subtypes are shown in Table 1 ) [23] . These large intra-subtype differences can be explained by our model, which showed that the L 565 M mutation could stabilize the coiled-coil without affecting the structure of the protein widely. We previously reported that the resistance to peptide fusion inhibitors differed markedly between MT-4/LAI and L-2 in spite of the fact that they had the same sequences of NHR and CHR (Table 1) . It is not thought that all of the differences between these virus strains could be explained in here clearly, because the interactions between the NHR-CHR complex and the other regions of the spike protein were not considered in our analyses. However, by the focusing on the L 565 M mutation in the inner and central moiety, which would be not affected by the other regions, we found that this mutation might be an important factor for the resistance of MT-4/17-3-6 to peptide inhibitors with respect to coiled-coil formation and cell fusion. shown by orange and yellow sticks, and these of MT-4/LAI by dark blue and green sticks, respectively.
