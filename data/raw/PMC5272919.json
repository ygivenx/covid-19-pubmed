{"title": "Opportunistic intruders: how viruses orchestrate ER functions to infect cells", "body": "Entry-associated virus disassembly. The first step in viral infection is entry into the host cell. For many viruses, entry requires disassembly of the incoming virus particle. Hijacking the functions of the ER for virus disassembly during entry is best described in the Polyomaviridae family. Polyomaviruses are non-enveloped double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses that are responsible for many human diseases, including nephropathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and Merkel cell carcinoma20. The two archetypical polyomaviruses, murine polyomavirus and simian virus 40, exhibit structural and genetic similarities to human polyomaviruses and have a similar entry mechanism to their human counterparts20. Not surprisingly, studies on these two non-human polyomaviruses have provided crucial insights into the cellular basis of polyomavirus infection. Structurally, polyomaviruses are composed of 72 pentamers of the major capsid protein VP1 that enclose the DNA genome, with each pentamer encasing an internal hydrophobic protein VP2 or VP3 (Refs 21,22). The carboxyl terminus of VP1 contacts a neighbouring VP1 pentamer to provide inter-pentamer support, with intra-pentamer and inter-pentamer disulfide bonds further reinforcing the viral architecture23.\n\nPolyomaviruses undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis and traffic to the endolysosomal system from which they travel through a lipid-dependent pathway to the ER24,25 (Fig. 2a, step 1). In the ER, polyomaviruses co-opt elements of the ERAD machinery to initiate penetration into the cytosol. Specifically, redox chaperones of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family isomerize and reduce the disulfide bonds in VP1, as well as unfold its C-terminal arms26,27,28,29,30 (Fig. 2a, step 2). These reactions partially disassemble polyomaviruses, exposing VP2 and VP3 (Refs 27,31,32). This generates hydrophobic virus particles that recruit BiP through the luminal J protein ER DNAJ domain-containing protein 3 (ERDJ3, also known as DNAJB11)33 (Fig. 2a, step 3). The nucleotide exchange factor 170 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP170; also known as HYOU1), in turn, releases polyomaviruses from BiP, enabling the hydrophobic viruses to integrate into the ER membrane34 (Fig. 2a, step 4). Imaging analyses revealed that the membrane-integrated viruses induce the reorganization of selective ER membrane proteins, including B cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BAP31; also known as BCAP31) and the J proteins DNAJ homologue subfamily B member 12 (DNAJB12), DNAJB14 and DNAJC18 (Refs 32,35,36). This rearrangement is crucial for the penetration of the ER membrane and leads to the formation of discrete puncta called foci, which are proposed as cytosol entry sites for polyomaviruses (Fig. 2a, step 5). To complete the translocation process, the membrane-tethered cytosolic extraction machinery (composed of the heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70)\u2013HSP105\u2013small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein-\u03b1 (SGTA) complex (HSC70\u2013HSP105\u2013SGTA complex)) extracts the polyomaviruses into the cytosol35,37 (Fig. 2a, step 6). The extraction reaction is probably coupled to further disassembly of the virus particles, which is essential for their subsequent transport to the nucleus37. Therefore, the penetration of the ER membrane by polyomaviruses illustrates how luminal, membrane and cytosolic components of the ERAD apparatus are coordinately hijacked to accomplish this decisive entry step.\n\nThe Papillomaviridae is the only other known virus family in which host cell entry may be associated with the ER. Although most infections that are caused by these non-enveloped DNA viruses are considered benign, some types of human papillomavirus (HPV), including HPV16 and HPV18, can lead to the formation of malignant tumours, for example cervical cancer38. To enter host cells, HPV traffics from the cell surface in endocytic vesicles to the Golgi apparatus from where it continues its retrograde journey to the ER39,40. Although the specific membrane penetration site for HPV remains controversial, the observation that proteins in the PDI family facilitate infection raises the possibility that papillomaviruses, similarly to polyomaviruses, hijack these redox chaperones to promote disassembly and membrane translocation41. The HSP70 chaperone system has been demonstrated to disassemble HPV in vitro42, analogous to the use of this chaperone system during the disassembly-mediated cytosol entry of polyomaviruses. After reaching the cytosol, HPV moves into the nucleus to establish infection. Intriguingly, hijacking the ERAD pathway is not limited to viruses. For example, many bacterial toxins also use this pathway during intoxication43,44,45.\n\nTranslating the viral genome. During entry and disassembly, the viral genome is exposed. This enables the genetic information to be transcribed and/or translated, depending on the nature of the genome (whether the genome is composed of DNA or RNA). For retroviruses, the RNA genome is first reverse transcribed to generate complementary DNA, which is the template for subsequent transcription and translation. Translation has two crucial purposes (Table 1). First, it produces viral structural proteins, such as viral envelope glycoproteins, which are necessary for the formation of virions (Fig. 2b). For example, the envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 and haemagglutinin of influenza A virus (IAV) are synthesized by the ER-bound biosynthetic machinery46,47. Once inserted, folded and assembled, the structural proteins move to the surface of the host cell and are incorporated into new viral progeny during assembly. Other viral envelope glycoproteins (see below) are instead redirected to distinct regions of the ER membrane where virus assembly takes place. Regardless of the strategy that is used, translation, membrane insertion, folding and the assembly of enveloped proteins, arguably represent the most important ways in which all enveloped viruses exploit the functions of the ER. In fact, insights from the biosynthesis of viral envelope proteins have historically provided our earliest understanding of fundamental translocation mechanisms of the ER48,49.\n\nSecond, translation can also generate viral non-structural (NS) proteins that prepare and promote the ensuing replication of the viral genome (Fig. 2b). This is most prominently observed in positive-sense RNA ((+)RNA) viruses in which genome replication invariably occurs in association with virus-induced membranes, which are often derived from the ER. Associated with these membranes are numerous replication proteins that are translated from the viral genome. These proteins have the remarkable ability to rearrange the ER membrane, creating characteristic structures that define the virus replication sites that are referred to as 'replication factories' or 'replication complexes' (Ref. 50). Consequently, the physical architecture of the ER membrane is transformed into a docking station to recruit newly translated viral replication proteins that, in concert with host factors, drive and sustain replication of the viral genome.\n\nA notable example is found in hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of the Flaviviridae family. HCV is an important human pathogen that can cause chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma51. Once its (+)RNA genome is delivered into the host cell, it is recruited to the ER membrane for translation. Translation of the viral RNA produces a single polyprotein, which is processed by viral and cellular proteases to generate 10 distinct protein products: structural proteins that consist of the core protein and the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2, as well as the p7 viroporin and the non-structural proteins NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. Among these, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B are necessary and sufficient for RNA replication, whereas p7 and NS2 are involved in the subsequent assembly step52,53. Importantly, the five replication proteins coordinately target to the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane, a process that is facilitated by the fact that NS4A, NS4B and NS5B are transmembrane proteins53. These replication proteins induce the formation of the replication site.\n\nA similar process is observed during infection with dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV), two additional members of the Flaviviridae family. Infection with DENV can be associated with dengue haemorrhagic fever54, while infection with WNV can also cause severe human disease, including encephalitis and meningitis55. For both viruses, the ER-dependent translation of their (+)RNA genomes generates a single polyprotein56. Proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein results in 10 mature viral proteins, comprising three structural proteins \u2014 capsid protein (C), pre-membrane protein (preM) and envelope protein (E) \u2014 and seven non-structural counterparts: NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5. As transmembrane proteins, NS2A, NS4A and NS4B are strategically positioned on the ER membrane where they establish the eventual viral replication factory, similar to HCV. The general strategy of targeting viral replication proteins to the ER membrane where they induce membrane rearrangements to form the viral replication site is also observed during infection with members of the Coronaviridae family57 (Table 1). There is evidence that members of the Picornaviridae family, such as poliovirus and enterovirus 71 (EV71), use a similar strategy58,59,60. Therefore, these examples elegantly demonstrate how diverse viruses have evolved conserved mechanisms to exploit the protein biosynthetic machinery and trafficking pathways that are associated with the ER, as well as the large surface area of the ER membrane, to recruit viral proteins and promote the formation of viral replication sites.\n\nIntriguingly, although the typical function of the translocation machinery of the ER can be subverted to translate viral structural and non-structural proteins, more unconventional use of this apparatus may also be possible. For example, hepatitis E virus (HEV), a (+)RNA non-enveloped virus that causes inflammation of the liver61, uses the translocation machinery of the ER to deliver the capsid protein ORF2 into the ER62. However, after reaching the lumen of the ER, ORF2 seems to be glycosylated and retro-translocated back to the cytosol by co-opting the ERAD pathway63. The ORF2 capsid protein subsequently evades proteasomal degradation in the cytosol by an unknown mechanism, and is presumably available for virus assembly63. Why ORF2 is translocated into the lumen of the ER, as well as whether this 'in-and-out' transport pathway occurs during bona fide infection, remain to be addressed. The use of this unusual pathway is also observed during the synthesis of the Rem protein of mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV), a retrovirus that is responsible for murine mammary carcinoma, which is used as a model to study breast cancer64. Rem is a virus-encoded, nuclear-localized protein that controls viral mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytosol. For Rem to reach the nucleus, it first co-translationally translocates into the ER, where it is processed by ER-resident signal peptidase before being retro-translocated back to the cytosol, from where it enters the nucleus65. To date, the physiological significance of this unconventional pathway in Rem function remains unclear. Nonetheless, these examples reveal novel ways by which viruses usurp ER translocation and retro-translocation, thereby coupling these two opposing membrane transport pathways, which is not observed during their normal cellular functions.\n\nViral genome replication. Once a virus enters the host cell, its genetic information is transcribed and translated to generate viral proteins, including replication proteins. When these replication proteins are strategically positioned on the ER membrane, the host cell is ready to support the replication of the viral genome and the subsequent assembly of new progeny virions, with assistance from cellular components. In many instances, viral replication and assembly are tightly coupled. Although these two events can occur in other intracellular organelles, depending on the virus, the ER is the most common site of replication and assembly66. As introduced above, numerous viruses in the (+)RNA Flaviviridae, Coronaviridae and Picornaviridae families exploit the ER to initiate and sustain viral replication and assembly (Table 1). With the exception of retroviruses, almost all RNA viruses use virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases for RNA replication. Replication occurs in virus-induced membranous structures that are most often derived from the ER and have different morphologies and terminologies50 (Fig. 3a). Regardless of the classification, these replication sites act to increase the local concentrations of viral and host components that are essential for RNA replication, enable different steps of the replication reactions to be coordinated efficiently, and guard against the host innate immune system. Transcription of a negative-sense RNA ((\u2212)RNA) intermediate at replication sites is then used for the synthesis of (+)RNA genomes, which are packaged into new virions during assembly. We will use ER-associated replication and assembly of HCV as the framework to understand these processes owing to the wealth of information that is available, although relevant examples from other viruses will be discussed.\n\nThe viral replication proteins of HCV induce extensive membrane rearrangements, forming ER-derived double-membrane vesicle (DMV) structures that are designed to support RNA replication67. These structures are embedded in a membranous matrix that is juxtaposed to the ER membrane and is known as the 'membranous web' (Refs 68,69). The identification of viral replicase components and replicase activity associated with purified DMVs argues strongly that these structures are responsible for the replication of the HCV genome, which is consistent with the finding that the kinetics of viral genome replication temporally coincide with the formation of DMVs53,70. Mechanistically, the biogenesis of DMVs requires substantial structural changes to the ER membrane, which involve membrane deformations, extensions and contractions to generate the appropriate topology. These morphological alterations are probably aided by the intrinsic plasticity of the ER membrane, which typically undergoes constant rearrangements. Topologically, it should be stressed that, as the viral replication proteins are associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the ER membrane, replication of the viral genome occurs in the cytoplasm.\n\nThe concerted action of all five viral replication proteins is essential for the formation of DMVs, with NS4B and NS5A probably having central roles71,72,73. However, an increasing number of host factors also contribute to the formation of DMVs53. For example, NS5A and NS5B target the host lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase-\u03b1 (PI4K\u03b1) to the ER-derived membrane, which stimulates its activity to locally produce phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P)74,75,76,77. PI4P is responsible for numerous cellular processes, including signal transduction, actin organization and membrane trafficking78, and can control membrane curvature79,80, which might enable it to directly regulate the formation of DMVs78. Alternatively, or additionally, PI4P recruits the cellular oxysterol-binding protein to sites of viral replication, which leads to cholesterol enrichment that is thought to be crucial for the replication of the viral genome through an undefined mechanism81,82. This is especially important as the ER membrane has a low concentration of cholesterol7. Another protein that is targeted to the DMV (by NS4B) is the proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 2 (PSTPIP2)83. This host protein is of interest because it contains a Bin\u2013amphiphysin\u2013Rvs domain (F-BAR domain) that has the ability to alter membrane curvature, which raises the possibility that PSTPIP2 shapes the ER membrane to generate the DMV84.\n\nIn the case of poliovirus, the viral replication proteins 2BC and 3A induce the necessary alterations to the ER membrane that trigger the formation of DMVs60, although the Golgi apparatus might contribute to the production of DMVs85. The 2C replication protein of EV71 acts in a similar capacity, in part, through the recruitment of the ER membrane protein reticulon 3 (RTN3), which is known to alter membrane curvature in the ER2,59. As both of these viruses form DMVs, it is perhaps not surprising that they also rely on the production of PI4P for their replication86,87. Intriguingly, the nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 membrane proteins of murine hepatitis virus drive the formation of a modified DMV (known as EDEMsome) that contains a subset of ERAD regulators to support viral replication88. The formation of this modified DMV has also been reported for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in the Flaviviridae family and the equine arteritis virus (EAV) in the Arteriviridae family89,90 (Table 1). Whether PI4P is essential during the replication of these viruses is unknown.\n\nOther virus-induced, ER-derived membranous structures that are used to support viral replication but are morphologically distinct from the DMV, are invaginated vesicles (initially characterized as convoluted membranes and vesicle packets)67,91,92,93. DENV and WNV use their non-structural proteins NS4A and NS4B94,95 to trigger the formation of invaginated vesicles to promote their genome replication. Importantly, the direct visualization of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA; a replication marker) in the interior of the DENV-induced, ER-derived structure provides strong evidence that it acts as the site of RNA replication93. Topologically, both the DMV and invaginated vesicles are membranous structures that seem to remain mostly attached to the ER membrane71,93. Despite being closely related to HCV, the replication of DENV and WNV does not require PI4P96,97. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that PI4P is essential for the replication of viruses that use the DMV, but not for viruses that use invaginated vesicles, as their site of replication. Regardless, the general idea of recruiting viral replication proteins to the ER membrane to create a replication factory (DMV or invaginated vesicles) to promote genome replication seems to be a broad principle that is shared across different virus families.\n\nApart from exploiting the propensity of the ER to undergo membrane rearrangements and its role in lipid biogenesis, ER-dependent UPR signalling is also hijacked to support viral replication. For example, HCV and DENV stimulate the UPR to promote viral replication through the impairment of the host antiviral innate immune response, whereas JEV activates the UPR to facilitate viral replication through controlling the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)-dependent decay pathway98,99. IAV also triggers the UPR to support viral replication through the activation of IRE1, although how the induction of IRE1 promotes viral replication remains unknown100. As there are numerous examples of viruses using the UPR to regulate their life cycle, we refer the reader to several recent reviews on this topic101,102,103,104,105.\n\nVirus assembly. Although viral replication and assembly are often thought to be tightly coupled processes, how these two events are precisely interlinked is poorly understood. Nonetheless, a model has been developed for HCV. Although viral genome replication occurs at the ER-derived DMV, the site of virus assembly is less clear but could possibly involve distinct regions of an ER-derived membrane (Fig. 3b). An essential host component that couples viral replication and assembly is the lipid droplet, a cellular storage organelle of neutral lipids106. Owing, in part, to the small GTP-binding protein RAB18, lipid droplets can localize proximal to the DMV107. In addition, the amphipathic helices of the NS4B protein of HCV have been reported to bind to lipid droplets, which may contribute to their recruitment108. Situated next to the DMV, the key function of lipid droplets is to recruit the HCV core protein to its surface (Fig. 3b), assisted by cellular enzymes that maintain lipid homeostasis. Subsequently, core proteins are thought to be released from lipid droplets and delivered to an assembly site on what is presumed to be the ER membrane (or at least an ER-derived membranous structure; Fig. 3b). At the assembly site, core proteins encapsulate the newly replicated (+)RNA that is extruded from the nearby DMV, forming the nucleocapsid (Fig. 3b). These reactions are mediated by p7, NS2, NS3 and NS4A109,110,111,112,113. After formation, the nucleocapsid is thought to bud into the lumen of the ER, producing a newly assembled, enveloped virion that contains the surface glycoproteins E1 and E2 (Fig. 3b). In the Flaviviridae family, interaction between the capsid protein of DENV and lipid droplets in the host has also been reported to be important for virus replication and assembly114.\n\nThe coupling of replication and assembly that relies on the ER membrane is not a strategy that is exclusive to RNA viruses. For example, imaging studies have revealed that vaccinia virus, a large enveloped DNA virus in the Poxviridae family, uses the ER membrane during its replication and assembly115. Intriguingly, the membrane surface of the resulting viral progeny corresponds to the luminal side of the ER membrane without necessarily budding into the ER membrane. How this perplexing topology is achieved clearly requires further investigation, but may involve an unusual membrane rupture step116. PI4P was recently implicated in the replication and assembly of poxviruses, similar to the use of this lipid during the replication of HCV, poliovirus and EV71 (Ref. 117).\n\nViral morphogenesis. Once new virus particles are assembled, they typically undergo further morphogenesis to generate mature virions that are poised to egress from the host cell. Subverting the functions of the ER to support these pivotal steps in late infection has been well documented for certain viruses. For example, after assembly of the HCV particle in the ER (or ER-derived) membrane, HCV undergoes additional maturation steps to egress from the host, including the acquisition of lipoproteins, particularly apolipoprotein E, on its surface118 (Fig. 3b). Surface lipoproteins probably explain the rather heterogeneous morphology of mature infectious virions119. The ER has also been reported to regulate morphogenesis of pestiviruses in the Flaviviridae family104, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the Hepadnaviridae family120,121. During the propagation of HBV, a non-infectious HBV subviral envelope particle (SVP) is produced. Intriguingly, SVP morphogenesis from its initial filamentous form to mature spherical particles that are ready for secretion is thought to be initiated in the perinuclear ER121.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable case of ER-dependent viral morphogenesis is found during the maturation of rotavirus, a member of the Reoviridae family and a causative agent of severe infant and childhood diarrhoea. Structurally, this non-enveloped dsRNA virus contains three concentric layers, the inner (core shell), middle and outer layers, which are composed of VP2, VP6, VP7 and VP4, respectively. The combination of the core shell and middle layer is called the double-layer particle (DLP), whereas the addition of the outer layer to the DLP forms the mature infectious virus called the triple-layer particle (TLP). Morphogenesis of the DLP to the TLP is uniquely associated with the ER (Fig. 3c).\n\nThe morphogenesis of the DLP to the TLP is initiated when the rotavirus non-structural membrane protein NSP4, which acts as a viroporin, binds to the ER membrane and induces the release of calcium into the cytosol122 (Fig. 3c). The subsequent rise in cytosolic calcium activates a kinase-dependent signalling cascade that triggers autophagy (Fig. 3c). This membrane trafficking pathway is then used to deliver rotavirus structural proteins VP4 and VP7 to the site of virus assembly on the ER membrane (Fig. 3c). At this juncture, NSP4 carries out several crucial functions, including interactions with VP4 on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, and VP7 on the luminal side that remains loosely associated with NSP4. NSP4 also binds to the DLP, targeting it to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. Next, the newly formed DLP\u2013VP4\u2013NSP4\u2013VP7 complex drives membrane deformation, which generates a transient enveloped intermediate in the lumen of the ER (Fig. 3c). As a consequence of this inward budding event, VP7 is displayed on the surface of the enveloped intermediate. Removal of the ER-derived lipid bilayer then enables the assembly of VP7 on the surface of the mature infectious TLP, with the concomitant release of NSP4 from the DLP (Fig. 3c). Finally, the TLP exits the host cell by lysis or secretion. Perhaps the most enigmatic step during these ER-dependent remodelling events is how the lipid bilayer that encompasses the transient enveloped intermediate becomes 'solubilized'. One possibility is the use of the viral structural protein VP7, which has membrane lytic activity123. In this scenario, the conformational change that accompanies the assembly of VP7 might expose its lytic domain, enabling VP7 to disrupt the integrity of the membrane. Whether components of the ER are exploited to facilitate the removal of the membrane is also unclear. In this regard, there is evidence that the ER-resident chaperone BiP and the oxidoreductase PDI support rotavirus morphogenesis in the ER124, although their roles may be indirect and instead be co-opted to assist in the conformational changes of VP7. Therefore, rotavirus morphogenesis seems to exploit three distinct functions and characteristics that are associated with the ER: intraluminal calcium efflux (to trigger the cytosolic signalling cascade), active rearrangement of the ER membrane (ideally suited for the inward budding reaction), and the use of ER-resident folding chaperones and enzymes (to promote the formation of the TLP).\n\nSimilar to NSP4 from rotavirus, other viral proteins also disrupt the ER membrane to stimulate the release of calcium from the ER, including the 2B and 2BC proteins of EV71 and rhinovirus, as well as the pUL37\u00d71 protein of human cytomegalovirus125,126,127. Furthermore, the Tat protein of HIV-1 can activate the ryanodine and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptors to mobilize calcium from the ER into the cytosol128,129,130. Although calcium release does not seem to be directly linked to facilitating viral morphogenesis in these examples, they nonetheless highlight the widespread use of viral components to cause calcium efflux from the ER to regulate aspects of the infection process.\n\nViral egress. Egress of the mature virion represents the final step in the viral life cycle. Essentially all viruses exit the host cell by being released into the extracellular milieu. Viruses that assemble and mature in the ER take advantage of the ER-associated biosynthetic machinery that enables the synthesis of viral structural proteins. Moreover, they use the ER-dependent secretory pathway to reach the plasma membrane for the release of viruses into the extracellular environment (Fig. 3d). For example, after envelopment in the ER, the new HCV particles are thought to use components of the classical secretory pathway for egress131, although a recent report implicated the clathrin-dependent pathway as another possibility for HCV egress132. In addition, there is evidence that rotavirus, following ER-dependent morphogenesis, uses the classical secretory pathway for exit118; a non-conventional egress strategy has also been proposed133,134. Although non-enveloped viruses are typically released through cell lysis, there are examples in which active vesicular transport is involved135,136. The progeny of parvovirus are packaged into COPII-coated vesicles in the ER before being transported to the Golgi apparatus en route to the plasma membrane for egress137. Interestingly, COPII-dependent vesicular budding was reported to be essential during infection with poliovirus, although this pathway is more likely to be involved in the formation of its genome replication site than in egress138,139.\n\nIn addition to providing a simple conduit to the cell surface, the ER could harbour specific factors that directly promote exit from the host cell. In fact, the discovery that the ER-resident KDEL receptor, a receptor that normally cycles cellular client proteins between the ER and the Golgi apparatus, is hijacked by DENV for host cell exit represents an excellent example of this possibility140 (Fig. 3d). Future studies will undoubtedly reveal other host components in the ER-dependent secretory pathway that guide viral egress. It is interesting to note that apart from the ER-dependent secretory pathway, autophagosomes that are derived from the ER can also be exploited for viral egress141,142.\n\nEfforts to develop therapies against viruses that cause debilitating human diseases have uncovered unparalleled insights into the dynamic relationship between viruses and host cells. This interplay is evident in the ER, where viruses have evolved elegant strategies to exploit intrinsic functions of the ER to promote every stage of infection. For example, members of the Polyomaviridae co-opt ERAD to disassemble and to access the cytosol of the host cell. Members of the Flaviviridae, Coronaviridae and Picornaviridae take advantage of the propensity for structural rearrangements in the ER membrane, sculpting this membrane to create ER-derived replication and assembly sites. The non-enveloped rotavirus exploits the physical properties of the ER and the presence of pro-folding chaperones to facilitate morphogenesis in the lumen of the ER. Despite these detailed understandings, many crucial questions remain. During virus entry, do polyomavirus-induced structures on the ER membrane act as the site of entry to the cytosol? Do new HCV particles assemble directly on the ER membrane or instead on an ER-derived membranous structure? During morphogenesis, how does rotavirus lose its transient lipid bilayer in the lumen of the ER to generate the infectious TLP virion? What is required to address these and other outstanding questions is a comprehensive strategy that combines the use of rigorous classical biochemical and cell-based approaches with state-of-the-art imaging methods, including live-cell single-particle tracking and cryo-electron tomography. These efforts will surely reveal fascinating insights into the ever-changing landscape of interactions between viruses and host cells. More importantly, they should also provide practical information that better positions the virology community to combat unresolved or new viral diseases."}
