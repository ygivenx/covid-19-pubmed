{"title": "The leader proteinase of foot-and-mouth disease virus: structure-function relationships in a proteolytic virulence factor", "body": "Viruses are obligate, intracellular parasites that must modulate host processes to ensure their successful replication. A major challenge for all viruses with an RNA genome is the manipulation of the protein synthesis of the host cell to inhibit translation of cellular proteins whilst permitting or even enhancing protein synthesis of viral RNA. Many viruses of the picornavirus family achieve this goal by encoding a proteinase that specifically cleaves the host cell protein, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G (Morley et al., 1997) . As detailed below, this leads to the inability of the host cell to translate capped cellular mRNA. In contrast, the uncapped picornaviral RNA can be used as a template for protein synthesis following cleavage of the eIF4G, as it initiates through an IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) . The viral proteinases that cleave the two homologues of eIF4G, termed eIF4GI and eIF4GII, are cysteine proteinases, but with completely different folds (Skern et al., 2002) . The enteroviral (e.g. poliovirus and human rhinovirus) 2A proteinase (2A pro ) has a chymotrypsin-like fold with a truncated N-terminal domain (Petersen et al., 1999) whereas the aphthoviral (e.g. foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and equine rhinitis A virus) and erboviral (equine rhinitis B virus) leader proteinases (L pro ) have a papain-like cysteine fold (Guarn\u00e9 et al., 1998) . L pro has also been reported to have two further activities, namely the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation (de Los Santos et al., 2007) and the deubiquitination for certain molecules involved in innate immune signalling (Wang et al., 2011) . This review focuses on the structure-function relationships in FMDV L pro necessary for these reactions.\n\nThe FMDV genome, like that of all members of the picornavirus family, possesses a single open reading frame (ORF) surrounded by a 5' UTR of around 1000 nucleotides containing the IRES and a 3' UTR of about 90 nucleotides ( Fig. 1 ; (Forss et al., 1984) ). The primary product of translation of the ORF is a polyprotein that is subsequently processed to the mature viral proteins by (a) proteinase(s) present in the polyprotein. L pro is the first protein encoded in the ORF; it was first shown to be a proteinase by Strebel and Beck (Strebel and Beck, 1986) . The initiation of translation on the FMDV genome is unusual in that there are two AUG start codons 84 nucleotides apart, so that two forms of the L pro are produced in infected cells, differing by the presence of 28 extra amino acids at the N-terminus ( Fig. 1A ; (Sangar et al., 1987) ). The longer form is termed Lab pro whereas the shorter form is termed Lb pro . The C-terminus of both forms is the same and is generated by cleavage of either Lab pro or Lb pro at their own C-terminus and the N-terminus of the subsequent protein on the polyprotein, VP4 ( Fig. 1B ; (Strebel and Beck, 1986) ). Using a genetic approach, it has been shown by Cao et al (1995) that the physiologically relevant form is Lb pro and not Lab pro . In addition, during an FMDV infection, it has also been observed that Lb pro is shortened by six or seven amino acids at the C-terminus (Sangar et al., 1988) . The role, if any, of this form (termed sLb pro ) has not been elucidated, although it has been reported that the sLb pro has an altered substrate specificity compared to Lb pro (Cencic et al., 2007) .\n\nThe self-processing of L pro from the capsid protein VP4 makes this proteinase an interesting target for anti-viral compounds. Inhibition of the self-processing of the L pro from VP4 will produce molecules of VP4 with an extremely long extension (Glaser et al., 2001) . The presence of only a few such molecules of the 60 VP4 molecules required for the capsid will almost certainly be sufficient to disrupt the formation of an infectious capsid ( Fig.1 A) . An analogous effect has been observed through mutation of the poliovirus 2A pro that leads to an extension of VP1 (Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005) . This extra effect of the inhibition of L pro or 2A pro will amplify the anti-proteolytic effect of an anti-viral such that a complete inhibition of the proteinase in question will not be required to achieve a major reduction in viral replication. Indeed, the use of a soluble form of the general, non-specific papain-like cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64 was shown over 20 years ago to inhibit FMDV replication in tissue culture (Kleina and Grubman, 1992) .\n\nInhibition of host cell protein synthesis through cleavage of the eIF4G homologues ( Fig. 1C ) was first documented during infection in cell culture by Devaney et al (1988) and characterised biochemically in vitro by Kirchweger et al (1994) . The cleavage sites on the two homologues (Table 1) have been determined only for Lb pro by protein sequencing of cleavage fragments from full-length eIF4GI (Kirchweger et al., 1994) and a fragment of eIF4GII (Gradi et al., 2004) . Cleavage of the homologues occurs simultaneously within FMDV infected cells and prevents translation of host mRNAs (Gradi et al., 2004) .\n\niii Interference with cell signalling A mutant FMD virus from which the L pro coding sequence (termed leaderless virus) (Piccone et al., 1995) had been synthetically removed showed that L pro is a viral virulence factor. The leaderless virus, following aerosol infection of cattle, failed to spread beyond the site of infection and was thus attenuated (Brown et al., 1996) . This was also the case for infection with swine. In cell culture, infection of IFN-competent cells with leaderless virus led to reduced virus yield and the absence of plaques that are normally observed with wildtype virus (Chinsangaram et al., 1999) . These observations correlated with higher levels of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 in the cell culture supernatants and suggested that the insensitivity of the wild-type virus to IFN was due to the ability of Lb pro to shutdown the host cell protein synthesis (Fig. 1C; (de Los Santos et al., 2006) ). Additionally, work with the leaderless virus showed that L pro can also inhibit the synthesis of IFN-\u03b2 at the transcriptional level (de Los Santos et al., 2007) .\n\nIn addition, Lb pro has been reported to act as a deubiquitinase removing both K48-and K63linked chains and thus prevent induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) by the ubiquitin pathway (Wang et al., 2011) as well as at the transcriptional and translational levels as reported by Grubman and co-workers (de los Santos et al., 2009 ). This deubiquitinase activity was unexpected as comparisons with certain coronavirus proteinases indicated that Lb pro would not possess such an activity owing to differences in the P2 specificity. The most C-terminal residues of ubiquitin are LeuXGlyGly, with deubiquitination occurring at the isopeptide bond of the final glycine. Thus, enzymes that can cleave at this isopeptide bond such as certain proteinases of coronaviruses generally prefer small residues at the P2 site whereas FMDV Lb pro has a specificity for leucine and valine at this position (Sulea et al., 2006) .\n\nRecent work (Pineiro et al., 2012) has identified the proteins Gemin5 and the Fas-ligand Daxx as substrates of Lbpro that are cleaved in FMDV infected cells. However, the exact role of these cleavages in the replication cycle of FMDV is at present unclear. It has been proposed that Gemin5 may downregulate FMDV proteins synthesis, so that Gemin5 cleavage may release this inhibition. Daxx has been proposed to play a role in the innate immune antiviral response, so that cleavage of this protein could hinder the host response (Pineiro et al., 2012) . However, these ideas are at present only suppositions.\n\nThe three-dimensional structures of both Lb pro and sLb pro have been determined to atomic resolution using X-ray crystallography (Guarn\u00e9 et al., 2000; Skern et al., 1998) and the behaviour in solution of both these proteins has been investigated by NMR (Cencic et al., 2007; Steinberger et al., 2013) . The structure of the Lb pro and that of the cellular prototype papain is shown in Fig. 2A . Clearly, the enzymes possess the same overall fold. Two main differences are clearly visible. First, the Lb pro has a much simpler structure, lacking many of the loops found in papain, including the pro-peptide binding loop (PBL). Secondly, Lb pro possesses a C-terminal extension (CTE) of 18 amino acids that is absent from papain and almost all other papain-like enzymes (Guarn\u00e9 et al., 1998) . Given its uniqueness, it is not surprising that the CTE plays important roles in the function of Lb pro . These are discussed in detail below.\n\nThe Lb pro active site has an imidazole-thiolate (C51-H148) ion pair and thus resembles that of papain (C25-H159) (Guarn\u00e9 et al., 2000) (Fig 2B) . However, the Lb pro residue that stabilises the ion pair is an aspartate residue (D163) instead of the asparagine residue (N175) found in almost all papain-like cysteine proteinases (Berti and Storer, 1995) . Furthermore, the loop containing the stabilising aspartate contains three further acidic residues (D164, E165 and E166). However, in Lb pro , there is no residue corresponding to the tryptophan residue W177 found in most papain-like enzymes (Fig 2B; (Berti and Storer, 1995) ). Consequently, the active site of the Lb pro is open to solvent and Lb pro activity is very sensitive to the mono-and divalent cations (Guarn\u00e9 et al., 2000) . The implications of these unique features for Lb pro activity in the infected cell are not known.\n\nCleavage sites for Lb pro on the polyprotein and the two eIF4G homologues have been characterised by protein sequencing; those from the IRES binding protein Gemin5 and the Fas-ligand Daxx have been characterised by mutagenesis (Table 1) . A cursory glance at the cleavage sequences reveals little conservation between the sequences. Indeed, it is surprising given the variation in the cleavage sites that more substrates have not been discovered. However, a number of mechanisms ensure that L pro remains a specific proteinase despite being able to recognise a variety of cleavage sites. The first is that the Lb pro can cleave before or after a basic residue, provided that the other residue next to the scissile bond is glycine or serine, as seen in three of the five known cleavage sites (Table 1) . Replacement of the P1' glycine residue with a basic residue virtually eliminated cleavage by Lb pro both in a self-processing system and a peptide assay. The proposed cleavage site on the Daxx protein does not fit into this scheme; however, as exact site of cleavage has not been determined for this protein, it remains to be seen whether this site genuinely represents an exception (Pineiro et al., 2012) .\n\nA second source of specificity is at P2, with the L pro accepting only leucine, valine or alanine; phenylalanine and proline are not accepted at this position (Kuehnel et al., 2004) . The third source of specificity is the high number of subsites on the enzyme for binding substrates. Thus, analysis of the crystal structure of the Lb pro showed the CTE of one molecule lying in the substrate binding site of the neighbouring one. The final seven residues of the CTE interacted with the substrate binding site, suggesting specific subsites from P1 to P7. This observation was confirmed and extended by cleavage of peptide substrates that indicated the presence of subsites from P7 to P5'. Thus, although being smaller than cellular papain-like cysteine proteinases, Lb pro has appreciably more subsites for substrate binding than papain or the cathepsins (Nogueira Santos et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2009 ).\n\nMechanisms to ensure specific cleavage and/or increase the efficiency of the reaction have been identified for Lb pro in both intramolecular and intermolecular self-processing as well as for the eIF4G homologues. For intramolecular self-processing, the 18 residue CTE (residues 183 to 201; Fig. 3 ) has to reach back into the substrate binding site of its own globular domain. Residues 183 to 188 are on the opposite face of the molecule to the substrate binding site, with L188 being the last residue to interact with the globular domain. Residues 189 to 194 connect this part of the CTE to the terminal seven residues (195 to 201) that interact with the substrate binding site, as mentioned above. Mutational analysis of the Cterminal residues N189, G190 and E191 has shown a profoundly detrimental effect on intramolecular self-processing without affecting eIF4G cleavage (Glatz, Schultes, O'Niell and Skern, unpublished; Fig. 3 ). This indicates that occupancy of these residues that appear to correctly orient the CTE is also critical for accurate self-cleavage and can therefore also be considered as a specificity determinant.\n\nGiven that L pro has to carry out intermolecular cleavages in the infected cell, it is important that the CTE is released following cleavage. NMR studies of sLb pro have shown that the truncated CTE is indeed flexible (Steinberger et al., 2013) . However, NMR studies of the Lb pro showed the presence of a dimer formed by the interaction of the CTE of one molecule with the substrate binding domain of the second one and vice versa (Cencic et al., 2007) . The K D for dimer formation is in the millimolar range indicating that the dimer is probably not present in the infected cell. To examine the behaviour of the full-length CTE on a monomeric Lb pro , it was therefore necessary to introduce the mutation L200F (Kuehnel et al., 2004) . This prevented dimer formation whilst allowing the CTE to interact with the globular domain, as measured by NMR. Again, the CTE of Lb pro L200F was flexible. In addition, the loss of signals in the substrate binding site compared to those observed with the corresponding residues in sLb pro indicate that the modified CTE was moving in and out of the substrate binding site in the milli-second time range (Steinberger et al., 2013) .\n\nIntermolecular self-processing can be observed in vitro when a polypeptide fragment containing an inactive Lb pro (i.e. one that is incapable of self-processing) linked to the following VP4 and VP2 proteins is incubated with an active Lb pro . Cleavage is at the same position as in intramolecular self-processing. However, the kinetics between the two reactions are quite different (Glaser et al., 2001) . Thus, the kinetics of the intramolecular reactions appear to be zero-order (ie concentration-independent) whereas those of the intermolecular reaction appear to be first-order (Glaser et al., 2001) . In addition, evidence has been presented that the sLb pro , lacking 6 amino acids at the C-terminus, behaves differently in intermolecular processing when compared to the wild-type. Thus, Lb pro and sLb pro cleaved a fragment bearing the wild-type junction between Lb pro and VP4 at essentially the same rate. However, the sLb pro was incapable of cleaving a fragment that contained nine residues of the eIF4GI cleavage sequence in place of the wild-type junction (Cencic et al., 2007) . This was interpreted to mean that the presence of at least one intact Lb pro CTE was required for optimal intermolecular cleavage. Whatever the mechanism behind this, it is rare that sequences 40 \u00c5 from the active site can influence the efficiency of the cleavage reaction.\n\nFor the efficient cleavage of the eIF4G homologues, Lb pro has evolved an exosite that enables binding to the eIF4G homologues approximately 20 to 30 amino acids N-terminal from the cleavage site (Fig. 3) . Evidence for this comes from several directions. First, both peptides corresponding to the cleavage sites on the eIF4G homologues are poor substrates for Lb pro . Second, deletion of the 18 amino acid CTE or replacement with another irrelevant sequence leads to a reduction in the rate of cleavage of the eIF4G homologues. Third, specific mutations in part of the CTE (e.g. residues 184 to 188) or residue C133, which is adjacent to the CTE, severely affect the binding to and cleavage of the eIF4G homologues by Lb pro . In contrast, these mutations did not affect intramolecular self-processing.\n\nThe exact mechanism leading to the inhibition of the activation of NF-\u03baB has not been elucidated. The degradation of the p65/RelA subunit was demonstrated, although defined cleavage products were not observed (de Los Santos et al., 2007) . Subsequent work showed that the destruction of this NF-\u03baB subunit required catalytic activity of L pro and that this reaction could be prevented by the mutation of both residues I83 and L86 to alanine (de los Santos et al., 2009 ). These mutations were also shown to prevent localisation of the L pro to the nucleus. However, the ability of the enzyme to carry out self-processing or cleavage of eIF4G homologues was not affected (de los Santos et al., 2009) . The most parsimonious explanation of these observations is that the region of L pro containing residues I83 and L86 (Fig. 3) is required for binding to either the p65/RelA subunit itself or to a proteinase that then degrades this subunit. Evidence to support this hypothesis has however not yet been obtained (de los Santos et al., 2009 ).\n\nViruses of the aphthovirus and erbovirus genera are unique amongst the picornaviruses in encoding a leader proteinase. This specific proteinase, comprising just 173 amino acids in the FMDV Lb pro form, has a structure related to papain. It is can perform both intra-and intermolecular cleavage at its own C-terminus and efficiently cleave of eIF4G to prevent host translation of proteins required for the innate immune reaction. In addition, in at present undefined ways, L pro appears to disrupt signalling pathways involved in host defences by initiating the degradation of the vital transcription factor NF-\u03baB and by deubiquinating messenger proteins using residues distinct from those involved in eIF4G binding.\n\nFuture work will undoubtedly provide us with more surprises on the gamut of reactions performed by this remarkable little proteinase.
