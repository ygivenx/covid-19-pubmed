SAA plasma levels however, were 173 significantly higher during severe disease compared to mild disease ( Figure 2D ). CFP plasma levels did not differ 174 between mild and moderate disease. In contrast to the other markers, the CFP plasma levels dropped 175 significantly in patients with severe disease (Figure 2E ).\n\nSince disease severity can also be reflected by the duration of hospitalisation and the need for supplemental 177 oxygen (as substitute for the need for hospitalisation) we tested whether they correlated with the plasma 178 proteins. Both CRP and CFP correlated significantly with duration of hospitalisation (\u03c1=0.361, p\u22640.001 and \u03c1=-179 0.22, p<0.05, respectively). However, PTX3, SAP and SAA levels did not. The need for supplemental oxygen was 180 associated with higher levels of CRP and PTX3 (Figure 2A-B) , whereas the other markers showed no significant 181 difference.\n\nThe influence of age and viral aetiology on protein levels\n\nChildren with severe disease are significantly younger ( Table 1) , therefore we checked whether age is a 185 confounder for our protein levels. After stratification of the cohort per severity and age group (under and 186 above two months of age) protein levels were compared. After Bonferroni correction no significant differences 187 were found in the group under two months of age. Thus, age is no confounder for our markers in the prediction 188 of severe disease.\n\nRSV mono-infections are more frequently seen in the severe disease group ( Table 1) . We tested whether 190 patients with RSV mono-infections also had higher plasma levels compared to patients with the same disease 191 severity without RSV mono-infections. We found that patients with RSV mono-infections had significantly \n\nNeed for supplemental oxygen 234\n\nValidation of the prediction rule for mild disease, need for hospitalization, resulted in 51% sensitivity and 68% 235 specificity (PPV 46% and NPV 72%).

In children > 2 months 237 the AUC decreased to 0.58 (sensitivity 52%, specificity 60%, PPV 42% and NPV 69%).\n\nNeed for mechanical ventilation 240\n\nWhen the prediction rule was applied to the validation set with a cut-off of 1.22, the sensitivity for severe 241 disease was 71% with 87% specificity, PPV and NPV were 64% and 90%, respectively.\n\nIn children below two months of age the AUC for severe disease is 0.87 (sensitivity 77%, specificity 57%, PPV 243 45%, NPV 84%).

This can be a disease, a disease stage, response or benefit from therapy, or an event or condition in the future. A medical test can be an imaging procedure, a laboratory test, elements from history and physical examination, a combination of these, or any other method for collecting information about the current health status of a patient.\n\nThe test whose accuracy is evaluated is called index test. A study can evaluate the accuracy of one or more index tests.\n\nEvaluating the ability of a medical test to correctly classify patients is typically done by comparing the distribution of the index test results with those of the reference standard. The reference standard is the best available method for establishing the presence or absence of the target condition. An accuracy study can rely on one or more reference standards.\n\nIf test results are categorized as either positive or negative, the cross tabulation of the index test results against those of the reference standard can be used to estimate the sensitivity of the index test (the proportion of participants with the target condition who have a positive index test), and its specificity (the proportion without the target condition who have a negative index test). From this cross tabulation (sometimes referred to as the contingency or \"2x2\" table), several other accuracy statistics can be estimated, such as the positive and negative predictive values of the test. Confidence intervals around estimates of accuracy can then be calculated to quantify the statistical precision of the measurements.\n\nIf the index test results can take more than two values, categorization of test results as positive or negative requires a test positivity cut-off. When multiple such cut-offs can be defined, authors can report a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve which graphically represents the combination of sensitivity and specificity for each possible test positivity cut-off. The area under the ROC curve informs in a single numerical value about the overall diagnostic accuracy of the index test.\n\nThe intended use of a medical test can be diagnosis, screening, staging, monitoring, surveillance, prediction or prognosis. The clinical role of a test explains its position relative to existing tests in the clinical pathway. A replacement test, for example, replaces an existing test. A triage test is used before an existing test; an add-on test is used after an existing test.\n\nBesides diagnostic accuracy, several other outcomes and statistics may be relevant in the evaluation of medical tests. Medical tests can also be used to classify patients for purposes other than diagnosis, such as staging or prognosis. The STARD list was not explicitly developed for these other outcomes, statistics, and study types, although most STARD items would still apply.\n\nThis STARD list was released in 2015. The 30 items were identified by an international expert group of methodologists, researchers, and editors. The guiding principle in the development of STARD was to select items that, when reported, would help readers to judge the potential for bias in the study, to appraise the applicability of the study findings and the validity of conclusions and recommendations. The list represents an update of the first version, which was published in 2003.\n\nMore information can be found on http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/stard. \n\nBlood and nasopharyngeal washings from children < 3 years of age with viral LRTI attending a hospital were 40 collected within 24 hours (acute) and after 4-6 weeks (recovery). Patients were assigned to a mild (observation 41 only), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding) or severe (mechanically ventilation) group.\n\nLinear regression analysis was used to design a prediction rule using plasma levels of CRP, SAA, PTX3, SAP and\n\nproperdin. This rule was tested in a validation cohort.\n\nOne hundred and four children (52% male) were included. 108\n\nIn this study we tested the aforementioned plasma proteins for their correlation with severity of viral lower The training cohort consisted of 104 children (overall inclusion percentage 58%, off all patients/asked who 169 were contacted informed consent was given in 77%) ( Table 1) . Children with severe disease were significantly 170 younger and had more often siblings than patients in the mild and moderate groups. The amount of children 171 below 2 months of age is 5, 12 and 21 in the mild, moderate and severe group, respectively.

When the acute 184 disease group was subdivided into three severity classes, plasma levels of CRP during severe disease were 185 significantly higher compared to patients with mild and moderate disease (Figure 2A) . Although there was a stepwise incline in plasma levels of PTX3, there were no significant differences ( Figure 2B ). Plasma levels of SAP 187 were also equal between the different disease severities ( Figure 2C ). SAA plasma levels however, were 188 significantly higher during severe disease compared to mild disease ( Figure 2D ). CFP plasma levels did not differ 189 between mild and moderate disease. In contrast to the other markers, the CFP plasma levels dropped 190 significantly in patients with severe disease ( Figure 2E ).\n\nSince disease severity can also be reflected by the duration of hospitalisation and the need for supplemental \n\nThe influence of age and viral aetiology on protein levels\n\nChildren with severe disease are significantly younger ( performance of the proteins was tested. First, the performance of the markers to indicate the need for 212 hospitalisation (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding) was assessed. Of 104 patients included for 213 analysis 27 did not receive supplemental oxygen: 6 of these patients belonged to the moderate group ( Table 1) .\n\nThe area under the curve (AUC) for the markers CRP and PTX3 was 0.63 and 0.64 respectively. The AUC for the 215 other markers was 0.59 for SAA, 0.57 for SAP and 0.51 for CFP.\n\nSecond, the performance of markers to indicate the need for mechanical ventilation (severe disease) was 217 assessed. Of 104 patients included for analysis, 32 were mechanically ventilated ( Table 1 ). The AUC of the 218 markers that were associated with severe disease, CRP, SAA and CFP, was 0.73, 0.57 and 0.76 respectively. The\n\nAUC for the other markers was 0.56 for PTX3 and 0.53 for SAP.\n\nCombining inflammatory markers increases performance.\n\nAs reflected by the AUC, none of the single markers was considered sufficient to identify mild disease and thus 223 aid in the decision to discharge a patient. Whereas the AUC of some markers for severe disease were slightly 224 higher, none of them exceeded 0.8.\n\nTherefore, linear regression modelling was used to analyse whether a combination of markers could increase 226 the individual performance. The assumption was that distances between the three groups were equal. The \n\nBased on the ROCs, a cut-off value for the identification of mild disease was set at 93.50, which resulted in an \n\nTherefore, it appears that SAP could not be used as a biomarker for disease severity in viral or bacterial 289 infections. 28 This study is the first to describe the remarkable kinetics of CFP (Properdin) levels, which decrease \n\nThe prediction rule for the identification of children with a mild course of disease appeared to be insufficient The advantage of measuring markers in plasma is the easy implementation, speed, reproducibility and 318 standardisation. Moreover, with the use of linear regression tools it is easy to add new markers to optimize the 319 rule. It is assumed that some biomarkers precede clinical symptoms and could therefore be used early in the 320 course of disease to predict severe outcome, whereas this is true for our markers need to be evaluated in 321 \n\nAcknowledgements 331\n\nWe would like to thank all parents and children who participated in this study.

Patients were assigned to a mild (observation 42 only), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding) or severe (mechanically ventilation) group.\n\nLinear regression analysis was used to design a prediction rule using plasma levels of CRP, SAA, PTX3, SAP and 44\n\nproperdin. This rule was tested in a validation cohort.\n\nOne hundred and four children (52% male) were included. 113\n\nIn this study we tested the aforementioned plasma proteins for their correlation with severity of viral lower 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 samples whereas CFP levels did not differ between these two time points (Figure 1A-E) . When the acute 192 disease group was subdivided into three severity classes, plasma levels of CRP during severe disease were 193 significantly higher compared to patients with mild and moderate disease (Figure 2A) . Although there was a 194 stepwise incline in plasma levels of PTX3, there were no significant differences ( Figure 2B ). Plasma levels of SAP 195 were also equal between the different disease severities (Figure 2C) . SAA plasma levels however, were 196 significantly higher during severe disease compared to mild disease ( Figure 2D ). CFP plasma levels did not differ 197 between mild and moderate disease. In contrast to the other markers, the CFP plasma levels dropped 198 significantly in patients with severe disease (Figure 2E ).\n\nSince disease severity can also be reflected by the duration of hospitalisation and the need for supplemental 200 oxygen (as substitute for the need for hospitalisation) we tested whether they correlated with the plasma 201 proteins. Both CRP and CFP correlated significantly with duration of hospitalisation (\u03c1=0.361, p\u22640.001 and \u03c1=-202 0.22, p<0.05, respectively). However, PTX3, SAP and SAA levels did not. The need for supplemental oxygen was 203 associated with higher levels of CRP and PTX3 (Figure 2A-B 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\nCombining inflammatory markers increases performance.\n\nAs reflected by the AUC, none of the single markers was considered sufficient to identify mild disease and thus 231 aid in the decision to discharge a patient. Whereas the AUC of some markers for severe disease were slightly 232 higher, none of them exceeded 0.8.\n\nTherefore, linear regression modelling was used to analyse whether a combination of markers could increase 234 the individual performance. The assumption was that distances between the three groups were equal.

It is assumed that some biomarkers precede 347 clinical symptoms and could therefore be used early in the course of disease to predict severe outcome. The\n\nadvantage of measuring markers in plasma is the possibility for easy implementation in current diagnostic 349 laboratory settings, relative short time to measure, reproducibility of the assays and available options for 350 standardisation. Moreover, with the use of tools for linear regression modelling it is easy to add new markers 351 to further optimize the predictive rule. In general, our results indicate that combining markers, in our case 352 inflammatory proteins, could increase the performance of a test. This indicates that this method might also be 353 useful in other settings. More specific, due to the validation in an independent cohort we can assume that our 354 decision rule will perform as well in other hospital settings. Whether the combination of these plasma markers 355 could also be used to predict severe bacterial infections need to be assessed in other studies.\n\nCurrently, there is no targeted therapy for most respiratory viruses and therefore there are no consequences to 357 the early identification of patients with a severe course of disease besides optimalisation of supportive care.\n\nThe identification of children with a mild course of disease has more visible consequences, as can be measured 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Describe any efforts to address potential sources of bias Line 120-122, 127-128 and line 144-145\n\nStudy size 10 Explain how the study size was arrived at\n\nSince this is a pilot study no power calculation could be performed.\n\nExplain how quantitative variables were handled in the analyses.
