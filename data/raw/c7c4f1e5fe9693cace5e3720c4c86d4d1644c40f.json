{"title": "Biological Agents", "body": "Biological warfare involves the intentional release of living pathogens either in their naturally occurring form, for example the diseased corpses of animals, or in the form of specific human-modified organisms (in this context also known as 'germ warfare'). This may include bacteria or viruses, or any pathogen that may cause disease. The intention is either to kill or incapacitate individuals, or to render an area of tactical importance impassable to unprotected persons. Pathogens may be termed 'bioweapons' or 'biological weapons'. Where such an agent is non-living (although produced by a biological organism), for example a toxin, then this is considered to be a chemical agent under the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\nHistorically, biological weapons were the first form of nonconventional warfare. During the sixth century BC the Assyrians poisoned enemy water wells with ergot fungus in order to disorientate the enemy. During the fourth century BC Scythian archers used arrows tipped with animal faeces in order to cause the wounds of their enemies to become infected. In 204 BC Hannibal famously utilised a form of biowarfare when he instructed his soldiers to throw clay pots filled with venomous snakes on to the decks of Pergamene enemy ships. During the Middle Ages, victims of the bubonic plague were often used for biological attacks, as besieging armies flung the diseased corpses and excrement over castle walls using catapults.\n\nThe inadvertent (although in some cases allegedly intentional) spread of diseases from Europe did tremendous damage to the indigenous populations of North and South America during the phase of exploration and conquest of these nations by Europeans in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. During the American Civil War, Confederate forces were known to shoot farm animals deliberately and place the corpses in ponds upon which the Union forces depended for drinking water.\n\nHowever, it was not until the technological and microbiological advances of the twentieth century that the development of the first true biological agents was possible. In the early part of World War II the Imperial Japanese Army used biological weapons on Chinese soldiers and civilians alike. The notorious 'Unit 731' was accused of biowarfare operations, including the air-dropping of plaguecontaminated fleas on Changde, causing epidemic plague outbreaks.\n\nIn response to biological weapons development in Germany and Japan, the USA, UK and Canada initiated a bioweapon development programme that resulted in the weaponisation of tularaemia, anthrax, brucellosis and botulism toxin. Field-testing by the UK during World War II left Gruinard Island in Scotland contaminated with anthrax for the next half-century.\n\nThe development, production and stockpiling of biological weapons effectively ceased with the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), which has now been signed by 137 countries and still remains in force. Since then, many countries have pursued 'defensive' biological weapon research (for defensive or protective applications), which is not prohibited by the BWC. The main military problem with a biological attack is that, unlike a nuclear or chemical attack, it can take days to be effective and therefore may not immediately stop an opposing force. Biological agents are inherently limited because of the uncontrollable nature of the agents involved. Despite these difficulties, many countries are believed to possess stockpiles of, or the ability to develop, biological weapons.\n\nBiological terrorism, or 'bioterrorism', is the clandestine intentional release or dissemination of harmful biological organisms by individuals or non-national groups as a means of causing death, and injury or striking fear into specific locations (such as businesses or organisations) or more widely across whole nations. Biological weapons may also be aimed at targeting crops or livestock, as carried out during both world wars, and subsequently during the Cold War and Vietnam wars.\n\nThe ideal characteristics for a biological weapon are high infectivity, high potency, the availability of vaccines and the ability to be delivered as an aerosol. The main difficulty is not the production of the biological agent but development of a reliable system that ensures effective delivery of the agent to the intended target. Biological organisms may be changed to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicines or increase their ability to be spread into the environment. Some potential bioterrorism agents, like the smallpox virus, can be spread from person to person, while others, such as anthrax, cannot.\n\nBiological agents may also be used to disrupt the economy. One example is the foot-and-mouth disease virus, which is capable of causing widespread economic damage and public concern (as witnessed in the 2001 and 2007 outbreaks in the UK), although it has almost no capacity to infect humans.\n\nVery few confirmed cases of bioterrorism have been reported in the past few decades. While not intentional, the accidental release of weaponised anthrax from a bioweapons research facility in Sverdlovsk, in the then Soviet Union, occurred in 1979, resulting in 70 cases of fatal inhalational anthrax, and confirmed the longsuspected Soviet programme of biological weapon development. In 1984, followers of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh attempted to control a local election by incapacitating the local population by infecting salad bars in 11 restaurants and other public domains with Salmonella typhimurium in the city of The Dalles, Oregon. The attack caused about 751 people to become unwell, although there were no fatalities. In September and October 2001, several letters containing anthrax were received by various members of the US Congress and media outlets, killing five people.\n\nAlthough the prospect of a deliberate release of a biological agent is of great concern to both the general public and health services, it is important to keep the likely consequences in perspective. 'Modern' bioterrorist attacks to date have led to few deaths, and only a handful of confirmed cases of infection. A large-scale deliberate release of harmful pathogen cannot be discounted. However, the difficulty in obtaining the necessary resources and technology, and the expertise required to disperse most biological agents, suggest that limited, small-scale attacks targeted at individuals, or institutions, are much more probable and are unlikely to cause significant numbers of fatalities.\n\nBiological agent categories and the 'Big Six'\n\nThe designation of biological weapons is based on three main features:\n\n\u2022 ease of production and dissemination \u2022 virulence, infectivity and ability to withstand environmental changes \u2022 ability to cause significant debility and mortality. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists the 'Big Six': the main biological agents that could have the most significant public health impact and the greatest potential for large-scale dissemination and interpersonal transmission. These are considered Category A agents and are listed in Box 4.1.\n\nCategory B agents are moderately easy to disseminate and have lower morbidity and mortality rates. Examples are listed in Box 4.2.\n\nCategory C agents are pathogens that could be engineered for mass dissemination because of their availability, ease of production and potential for high morbidity and mortality. Examples are listed in Box 4.3. \n\nIt is likely that any bioterrorism attack will be initiated in a covert manner in order to avoid provoking an immediate decontamination and preventive medical response from the emergency services. An obvious release, such as an airborne release of powder in a public place, would result in measures to control any mass outbreak of illness and therefore reduce the intended effect of the terrorist attack.\n\nPossible scenarios include the spread of disease within an unprepared population by an intentionally infected, and possibly suicidal, individual or by the contamination of air or water via ventilation or storage systems. Animal vectors have previously been used by some countries to disseminate pathogens as a bioweapon, although this level of sophistication is unlikely to be utilised by terrorist groups.\n\nOne of the major difficulties with intentional biological agent release is that symptoms and signs may take between hours and days, even weeks, to appear and by that time person-to-person spread may have already occurred and affected individuals may have moved a considerable distance from the site of their initial exposure.\n\nPossible early clinical and environmental indicators of an intentional biological agent release incident are shown in Box 4.4 . Effective public health surveillance systems may also reveal signs of an intentional biological agent release, although these will most likely be delayed by several days as a greater number of cases present, and data are collected and analysed. Box 4.5 shows some of the public health surveillance indicators that may be seen. \u2022 Unusual numbers of presentations of rare or non-endemic diseases \u2022 Unusual age, occupational or geographical distribution \u2022 Unexpectedly high morbidity or mortality \u2022 Unusual seasonal incidence \u2022 Agent-specific clinical clues (e.g. smallpox rash) \u2022 Predominance of respiratory symptoms among usually well individuals \u2022 Unscheduled and unusual aerial outdoor spraying \u2022 Abandoned spray devices or suspicious containers\n\nBiological agents can be dispersed by air in the form of fine particles (aerosols), or used to contaminate food or water sources. When considering how biological agents are spread following intentional release, they may be separated into two groups: contagious agents and non-contagious agents.\n\nContagious agents, especially those that are highly contagious such as smallpox virus and Yersinia pestis (plague), spread from person to person so rapidly that widespread dispersal may not be necessary. A small amount of agent dispersed and infecting only a few individuals will have the potential to start an epidemic affecting millions. Such a method is inherently unpredictable in its outcome, as the extent and spread of the outbreak will depend upon the movement of infected individuals. Outbreaks can therefore cross regional and national borders, resulting in significant difficulty in contact tracing.\n\nNon-contagious agents, such as the anthrax bacillus, require effective and widespread dispersal in order to affect a greater number of individuals, as the pathogen is not transmitted from person to person. Significant technological expertise is required to produce and disperse agents in this way as they will need to be aerosolised into particles of 1-5 mm (i.e. small enough to remain suspended in the air as an aerosol and to be inhaled deep into the lung). Techniques may include the use of explosive canisters containing agent or spraying devices attached to vehicles or aircraft. The outcomes of dispersal of noncontagious agents are more predictable in that only those in the vicinity of the release will be affected.\n\nEarly detection of deliberate biological releases can influence subsequent morbidity and mortality by enabling rapid containment and effective treatment. In generic terms, government-supported public health units are responsible for monitoring disease activity in Box 4.5 Public health indicators of an intentional biological agent release \u2022 Incidence demonstrating an epidemic curve with an 'explosion' of cases \u2022 Simultaneous outbreaks of unusual diseases \u2022 Tight geographical or occupational clustering \u2022 Unusual resistance patterns or modes of transmission \u2022 Numerous animal as well as human casualties \u2022 Absence of a normal disease host or vectors 4 Responding to Terrorism: A Medical Handbook populations. Although normally focused on routine public health infectious disease threats, such as tuberculosis, the same systems are utilised to detect bioterrorist threats. In the UK, the surveillance and response framework is coordinated by the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, Department of Health (DH) and the Health Protection Agency (HPA).\n\nModern surveillance measures relating to bioterrorism agents must be capable of detecting, investigating and responding to deliberate attacks and also discriminating these from 'natural' outbreaks. Such systems must be consistent, reliable and accurate as well as acceptable to the health workers using them. The features of an effective surveillance system are listed in Boxes 4.6 and 4.7 .\n\nCommunication networks and information technology systems are also of critical importance so that public health information can be shared rapidly and effectively. With the vulnerability of technology systems to a coordinated terrorist attack and limitations in infrastructure, resources may be insufficient to cope with the inevitable higher demands and activity during the response to a bioterrorist event. Security, redundancy and surge capacity are therefore vital components of any surveillance system.\n\nComputer simulations and diagnostic algorithms may be a valuable aid to the detection and coordination of responses to bioterrorist events, although these are yet to be tested. Such attacks are thankfully rare, although this does prevent comparison of predictive or diagnostic models to real-life attacks as well as limiting opportunities to test established surveillance systems effectively. Box 4.6 \n\nThe UK framework consists of local infectious disease epidemiology services staffed with consultants in communicable disease control (CCDC) and informed by local health services. Collation of locally collected data enables the recognition of any new disease trends. Regional laboratories maintained by the HPA provide diagnostic services and further epidemiological expertise on the clinical and organisational management of outbreaks. The HPA also maintains reference laboratories with expertise on specific microbes.\n\nDeliberate biological releases may be declared or covert. Responses to declared releases will be coordinated centrally and extra resources supplied to the affected region or regions as required. Detection of a covert release will only be possible once the first cases of infection begin to arise. The appearance of diseases that rarely occur in nature may alert to the possibility of a covert deliberate release. For example, HPA guidelines state that deliberate release should be considered as a cause in the event of a single case of inhalational anthrax. Once the causative agent has been identified, all individuals exposed need to be traced, decontaminated and offered appropriate treatment. This response is coordinated via an outbreak control team consisting of the CCDC and appropriate subject matter experts.\n\nThe key approach to the detection of an intentional biological agent release is the identification of geographical or temporal clustering of cases with common symptoms. Particular groups of symptoms, or 'biodromes', may be associated with certain organisms and therefore the appearance of these in large numbers of individuals could indicate the release of a biological agent. Table 4 .1 lists the most common biodromes and their associated pathogens.\n\nThe potential benefit of symptom-based recognition is that disease trends may be identified before laboratories begin to report positive cultures. Case-based surveillance networks operate throughout Europe and are capable of detecting bioterrorist agent threats.\n\nIn general terms, the initial management of a biological outbreak involves:\n\n\u2022 clinical care of affected patients \u2022 identification of risk groups \u2022 identification of all affected individuals \u2022 identification of the causative agent and transmission route \u2022 decontamination of the source and control measures \u2022 use of vaccines and antibiotics for public health protection \u2022 provision of information to the public and the media. Local clinical care of affected patients is the responsibility of National Health Service acute hospitals and primary care services. Coordination of more serious outbreaks will also involve regional directors of public health, regional HPA epidemiologists and the DH.\n\nThe initial management of a suspected accidental or deliberate biological agent release incident will be carried out by the same general principles that apply to all chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) incidents. This has been covered in more detail in Chapter 2. Biological incidents differ from other incidents due to the inherent, often significant, delay between time of exposure and the onset of symptoms and signs of the causative agent. Unless the release of the agent is overt, such as a suspicious airborne spraying device or explosive dissemination, index cases may travel a significant distance from the point of exposure, thereby creating considerable difficulty with containment of the incident and later contact tracing. This could allow the rapid spread of infection throughout the population, especially where the organism is particularly virulent. Conventional boundaries and cordons will not apply in these cases.\n\nIn the case of an overt biological release, command and control of the incident may be possible. This would require a rapid containment of cases in order to prevent spread of infection and to offer initial treatment and possibly post-exposure prophylaxis if appropriate.\n\nThe assessment and treatment of biological incident casualties will depend on the suspected agent. Detection of the organism will often rely upon recognition of characteristic clinical signs until specialist laboratory testing can confirm serology or bacteriology. The specific treatment for disease caused by individual biological agents is discussed later in this chapter.\n\nThe assessment and treatment of affected patients can involve the regular handling of body fluids and secretions, changing of dressings and disposal of contaminated objects. Precautions are therefore required in order to help prevent inadvertent transmission by exposure to potentially infectious body fluids, and to avoid injury by potentially contaminated sharp instruments.\n\nThe HPA offers generic advice on the precautions to take in order to prevent the spread of infection between patients and emergency personnel. As it is not always possible to identify people who may carry disease, especially in the early stages following exposure to a pathogen, these precautions must be followed at all times. As such, these are usually termed 'universal precautions', although they may also be referred to as 'standard' precautions. The main components are listed in Box 4.8.\n\nIndividual personal protective equipment (PPE) can be separated into the following categories:\n\n\u2022 barrier PPE: gloves and gowns \u2022 droplet PPE: gloves, gowns and eye protection (i.e. face shields) \u2022 aerosol PPE: gloves, gowns and face masks/respirators. Contact transmission will be the chief cause of infection spread between individuals. Following universal precautions, additional contact precautions should be maintained to minimise transmission. This may include isolation of patients in private rooms where resources allow. All health workers should wear gloves and a gown for any patient contact. Face shields and eye protection should also be worn when conducting an examination or procedure that may involve aerosols or droplet formation, such as airway suctioning or the use of nebulisers. PPE should be removed between patients, with respiratory protection removed last, and disposed of appropriately in marked clinical waste bins.\n\nThe HPA guidance flowchart for NHS PPE is shown in Figure 2 .17 on page 81.\n\nSmall particles containing infectious pathogens may be formed by droplets expelled from the respiratory tract of an infected individual, or by intentional release in aerosol form. Particles no greater than Box 4.8 Universal precautions \u2022 Practise good basic hygiene with regular hand washing between patients \u2022 Cover wounds or skin lesions with waterproof dressings \u2022 Avoid contamination of person and clothing with body fluids (wearing of gowns) \u2022 Disposable gloves and gowns/aprons should be worn when attending to dressings or performing procedures that may involve handling or discharge of body fluids \u2022 Avoid use of sharp instruments if possible, but where necessary handle and dispose of these safely and appropriately \u2022 Protect eyes, mouth and nose from possible blood or other body fluid splashes with safety glasses or masks with visors \u2022 Be familiar with local procedures following sharps injury or blood splash incident \u2022 Clear up body fluids promptly and disinfect surfaces appropriately \u2022 Dispose of all contaminated waste safely according to local guidelines, including how to dispose of soiled linen \u2022 Clean, disinfect and sterilise equipment as appropriate 5 mm in size can remain suspended in the air and travel for long distances, dispersing over wide areas and through ventilation systems. The most common infections that are transmissible by the airborne route are listed in Table 4 .2. Close contact (traditionally less than 1-2 metres) may not be required for transmission of these, although it may make person-to-person spread more likely. Prevention of airborne transmission requires a higher level of respiratory protection than can be offered by surgical masks.\n\nDroplet spread involves larger, heavier particles (greater than 5 mm) requiring closer contact for transmission and may be protected against by wearing surgical masks (Box 4.9) which prevent exposure and absorption via the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and eyes. Examples of diseases spread by droplet spread are listed in Table 4 .2.\n\nStandard precautions are also a vital aspect of transmission prevention in all cases.\n\nIf required, immediate casualty decontamination for biological agents can be carried out effectively with detergent and water. Surfaces and equipment should be carefully disinfected with an appropriate detergent or bleach solution. Medical utensils will ideally be of the single-use, disposable type. Multi-use items will need cleaning and disinfection as appropriate, such as steam heating in autoclaves.\n\nDecontamination of individuals with recent suspected exposure to a biological agent should follow standard procedures (see p. 74-78), especially if there is the potential for other agents, such as chemical. In the case of a mass casualty incident, decontamination would be a significant logistical issue. The need to carry out mass decontamination will depend upon the extent of release, and environment at the release site, the transmission risk and persistency of the suspected agent and the presence of other injuries due to 'conventional' trauma from blast, energised debris or collapsed structures. Forward medical teams with full PPE and specialised equipment may be required to deal with casualties within the hot zone, especially where conventional trauma has occurred or casualties are entrapped. \u2022 Part of standard personal protective equipment (PPE) precautions \u2022 Change mask if it becomes soiled or wet and before leaving room/cubicle \u2022 Only handle the tapes or ties; try to avoid touching the face piece \u2022 Don PPE in following order: gown, mask, face shield or goggles, gloves \u2022 Remove in following order: gloves, gown, face shield or goggles, mask \u2022 Do not protect against small (<5 mm) particles\n\n\u2022 In addition to standard precautions \u2022 Protection against droplet spread \u2022 Wear a surgical mask (see above)\n\n\u2022 Examine the patient in a single room or cubicle \u2022 Inpatient bed placement should be discussed with infection control team \u2022 All visitors must wear surgical masks \u2022 Limit patient movement to necessary medical reasons only \u2022 If patients are moved from their room/cubicle they must wear a surgical mask \u2022 The decision to discontinue basic respiratory precautions should be made in consultation with the infection control team\n\n\u2022 In addition to basic respiratory precautions \u2022 Senior clinical staff and microbiologist should be consulted urgently \u2022 Surgical masks should be placed on patients immediately \u2022 Patients should be placed in single rooms/side rooms, the door kept closed and access strictly limited to essential medical personnel only \u2022 Patients should be admitted to a negative-pressure isolation room or isolation ward \u2022 FFP3 masks must be worn as part of PPE \u2022 Don PPE in the following order: gown, FFP3 mask, face shield or goggles, gloves. \u2022 Remove in the following order: gloves, gown, face shield or goggles, FFP3 mask 4\n\nThe ability to carry out some routine medical interventions, such as intravenous access and advanced airway management, is usually attenuated by PPE. In this case, intraosseous access may be a more appropriate and dependable mode for the administration of drugs or fluids for resuscitation. The use of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) may temporise an otherwise unprotected airway in an unconscious patient until that casualty can be extricated, decontaminated and moved safely into the cold zone. However, at-scene decontamination may not be possible, or necessary, as the features of a biological agent deliberate release can take several days to appear. Unless the suspected agent release is visibly indicated, or a warning has been issued, the response will require careful contact tracing to discover the potential source or location of the initial release. Once discovered, this area may require quarantine and decontamination as appropriate. A number of biological agents are highly persistent, especially in favourable environmental conditions, and therefore an effective cordon will be required to deny access and prevent further spread.\n\nCurrent HPA isolation precautions set out the protection required for health workers against the most contagious and virulent organisms, such as those responsible for viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). HPA isolation recommendations for VHF are listed in Box 4.10. In the case of infection with the higher airborne risk group of VHF (including Lassa, Marburg, Ebola and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) viruses) special airborne precautions are recommended. These are described in Box 4.11 .\n\nAlthough HPA recommendations for managing VHF currently include the need for strict isolation and individual protection from airborne spread, there is growing evidence that VHF are in fact very rarely, if ever, transmitted in this way in humans. Therefore, managing such cases as a 'blood-borne' disease (hepatitis B or human The following guidelines apply to all VHF patients (with the exception of dengue):\n\n\u2022 Strict hand washing before and after patient contact \u2022 Double gloving, impermeable gowns, leg and shoe covers \u2022 Face shields, goggles or respirators \u2022 Negative-pressure room and isolated air-handling systems \u2022 Limit access to essential personnel only \u2022 Sequestration of multiple VHF patients in one area or building \u2022 Use of dedicated equipment within rooms (e.g. stethoscopes)\n\n\u2022 Regular environmental disinfection 4 Responding to Terrorism: A Medical Handbook immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for example) could be appropriate and management guidelines may change in future to take this into account. However, where discussed further in this chapter, the management of VHF will continue to be stated according to current HPA advice.\n\nAppropriate surge capacity must be incorporated into hospital response plans to deal with multiple cases of infection by the most highly contagious organisms. This may involve preparation of a specific zone or ward as an isolation area. Multiple critically ill casualties will require the coordination of a regional, or even national, response to provide adequate numbers of high-dependency beds.\n\nIndividuals with the suspicion of exposure to highly contagious organisms will require appropriate monitoring for signs of disease by public health systems.\n\nEvery attempt should be made to reduce panic in the general public by issuing regular and accurate information to the media. Ideally this should be prepared in advance for release in the event of an incident. The HPA has a remit to protect the public from communicable disease, to monitor infectious diseases in England and Wales and to provide support and advice on how infectious disease threats can be managed. Fact sheets are available for several likely public health biological threats, including anthrax, plague, botulism and smallpox. Regular meetings and conferences also take place to enable discussion of the latest developments in infectious disease threats, diagnostic tests and new treatments.\n\nOverall, the main aim of the government is to reassure the public that the chances of a biological attack are low whilst also ensuring that the public is sufficiently prepared, without revealing specific details of UK preparedness.\n\nThe Department of Health has developed patient group directions (PGDs), which allow some chemical and biological countermeasures to be administered in emergency situations. Box 4.11 Health Protection Agency guidance for airborne precautions for 'high potency viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF)'\n\nTo be worn by personnel coming within 2 metres of a VHF patient with high risk of airborne transmission:\n\n\u2022 Fit-tested, high-efficiency particulate air filter-equipped respirator (N-95 mask) \u2022 Battery-powered air-purifying respirators or \u2022 Positive-pressure supplied air respirators PGDs are documents which make it legal for medicines to be given to groups of patients, for example in a mass casualty situation, without an individual prescription having to be written for each patient. They can also be used to empower staff other than doctors (for example paramedics and nurses) to give the medicine in question legally. Examples include ciprofloxacin, doxycycline and potassium iodate.\n\nThe exemptions provided by Article 7 of the Prescription Only Medicines (Human Use) Order 1997 (the POM Order) mean that PGDs are not needed for the following countermeasures, when given by anyone in an emergency to save life:\n\n\u2022 atropine sulphate injection \u2022 dicobalt edetate injection \u2022 glucose injection \u2022 pralidoxime chloride injection. This information and further details are available at the DH website, specific link:\n\nwww.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/ Emergencyplanning/DH_4069610\n\nMany biological agents have the potential for use as weapons or could be released deliberately in the course of a terrorist attack. They may be divided into three different categories: bacteria, viruses and biotoxins.\n\nEach biological agent is discussed separately in this chapter, including specific treatment issues. The layout of each is as follows:\n\n\u2022 type, name and brief description of the agent \u2022 natural source \u2022 deliberate release characteristics \u2022 exposure \u2022 onset \u2022 major symptoms \u2022 initial management \u2022 diagnosis \u2022 specific treatment \u2022 persistency \u2022 recovery \u2022 further information.\n\nNote: Always check with the HPA website for the latest guidelines as advice regarding assessment and the most appropriate treatment is constantly being revised and updated\n\nThe biological agents to be discussed are listed in Table 4 .3. \n\nAnthrax is caused by the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis.\n\nHuman cases of anthrax are rare in the UK (less than 1 case per year), although more common in parts of Europe, the Americas, Middle East and Africa. Inhalational anthrax is very rare and even a single confirmed case is highly suggestive of a deliberate release. Anthrax spores were sent via the US Postal Service during 2001, causing 22 cases and five deaths. Anthrax is considered to be one of the 'Big Six' in terms of biological agents as a terrorist threat (see p. 136).\n\nAnthrax is a zoonosis and mainly affects sheep, cattle and goats. Unintentional exposure may therefore occur from handling infected animals or their hides, skins or hair. Laboratory personnel may also be exposed to the organism accidentally.\n\nAnthrax spores may be dispersed on a large scale in an aerosol form or placed in threatening letters or parcels: a 'white-powder' incident (see pages 82-85 and 228-231).\n\nInhalation of spores may cause pulmonary anthrax while direct contact with wounds or abraded skin may result in cutaneous anthrax. Eating undercooked anthrax-contaminated meat may result in gastrointestinal anthrax.\n\nThe usual incubation period is between 1 and 7 days. Cutaneous anthrax leads to formation of an itchy skin lump, then a scab within 2-6 days. Inhalational exposure can cause an initial flu-like illness followed by severe respiratory symptoms in 1-2 days, although onset may be delayed up to 60 days. Gastrointestinal anthrax leads to signs of an acute abdomen within 3-7 days, which may initially be suspected to be surgical in origin.\n\nThe symptoms and signs of anthrax exposure depend upon the mode of exposure and are shown in Table 4 .4.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. If a diagnosis of cutaneous or systemic 4 Responding to Terrorism: A Medical Handbook anthrax is suspected, the case should be discussed urgently with a consultant microbiologist. There is usually no risk of person-to-person spread and standard precautions should be considered appropriate. However, in the case of a suspected recent aerosolised release or physical exposure to a suspicious substance, there may be remaining surface contamination with spores. If so, PPE must be worn and appropriate decontamination carried out with safe disposal of clothing as described (p. 74-78).\n\nBlood sample, sputum and skin lesion swabs should be cultured, preferably before starting antibiotics. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be more rapid. Dermatological referral and biopsy may also be indicated for skin lesions. Patients with systemic anthrax may demonstrate low arterial blood gas P a O 2 , a raised white cell count, hyponatraemia, raised liver transaminases and low serum albumin. Chest radiography (and/or computed tomography (CT) scan) may show a widened mediastinum, pleural effusions and pulmonary infiltrates.\n\nSee Table 4 .5 for antibiotic treatment regimens.\n\nAnthrax spores are very resilient and can survive in contaminated soil for several decades. Living bacteria can only survive 24 hours outside a host.\n\nRecovery is usual for cutaneous anthrax if treated early. Inhalational anthrax has 100% mortality if left untreated and gastrointestinal Biological Agents anthrax may be fatal even with appropriate therapeutic intervention. Patients should be monitored for 1-2 months following apparently successful detection and treatment for signs of recurrence.\n\nAnthrax vaccine is licensed for use in the UK and is reported to be safe and effective, requiring annual booster injections following the initial course. \n\nBrief description Brucellosis is an infectious multi-system disease caused by the Gram-negative coccobacilli Brucella species. Human infection is uncommon in the UK with fewer than 20 cases reported per year (most of these are usually acquired abroad). It is more common in some parts of Europe, the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America and the Caribbean. Confirmation of a human case without a history of travel to an endemic area or occupational exposure suggests a deliberate release.\n\nBrucellosis is a zoonosis and mainly affects cows (B. abortus), sheep, goats and camels (B. melitensis) and pigs (B. suis). Unpasteurised milk from affected animals may carry the bacteria. Unintentional exposure may also occur from handling infected animal carcasses and wastes (vets, meat packers, abattoir workers). Laboratory personnel may also be exposed to the organism accidentally.\n\nThe most infectious route for deliberate release would be delivery in an aerosolised form. Two species of the bacteria are considered to be potential biological weapons: B. melitensis and B. suis.\n\nThe main routes of exposure are by inhalation, ingestion or through abraded skin.\n\nThe typical incubation period is 1-3 weeks, but there may be a delay of up to 6 months from exposure. High-concentration inhalational exposure would lead to a quicker onset.\n\nEarly symptoms are non-specific and very variable between individuals. Clinical features do not depend on the route of exposure and lead to either an acute or chronic illness, as described in Table 4 .6. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur in around 70% of cases. B. melitensis causes the most severe form of the disease.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. If a diagnosis of brucellosis is suspected, the case should be discussed urgently with a consultant microbiologist. There is usually no risk of person-to-person spread and standard precautions should be considered appropriate. However, in the case of a suspected recent aerosolised release or physical exposure to a suspicious substance, there may be remaining surface contamination with the agent. If so, PPE must be worn and appropriate decontamination carried out with safe disposal of clothing as described (p. 74-78).\n\nThe diagnosis is made serologically with multiple blood cultures, although samples may need prolonged incubation (request forms should therefore mention the possible diagnosis). Full blood count (FBC) usually demonstrates leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and sometimes anaemia. Liver function tests (LFTs) are often mildly abnormal. With neurological signs cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures may demonstrate the organism.\n\nThe sooner antibiotics are begun, the less likely it is that chronic brucellosis will occur. Table 4 .7 describes initial antibiotic treatment regimens. In all cases, treatment response should be monitored by resolution of fever and associated symptoms, as well as appropriate weight gain.\n\nBrucella is fairly stable in the environment and may persist for up to 6 weeks in dust or up to 10 weeks in soil or water. However, the organisms are easily killed by routine disinfectants (hypochlorite solutions) or by heating above 63 C. Thorough cooking should therefore prevent exposure by ingestion.\n\nRecovery is usual for brucellosis if identified and treated soon. Mortality for chronic brucellosis is around 5%, although morbidity is fairly common. Relapses may occur and follow-up should be arranged at 3 weeks, 6 weeks and then every 3 months for 1 year.\n\nOnce infected patients have begun treatment they are usually no longer infectious after 3 days. There is no commercially available vaccine. \n\nFood-borne pathogens include naturally occurring bacteria such as Salmonella, Shigella and Escherichia coli, which cause disease by their presence in the gastrointestinal tract. The pathophysiology and clinical presentation of these are well described in the wider literature. However, they are also relevant from a biological weapons perspective due to the capacity to cause widespread illness by the intentional release of organisms into food and on to food preparation areas.\n\nThe commonly involved organisms may be found in water, soil, and human and animal faeces and can be carried by insects or found in uncooked meats, poultry and seafood. Non-deliberate outbreaks are commonly associated with poor food hygiene and safety practices in restaurants or by food manufacturers. Individuals working in food preparation may transmit pathogens by the faecal-oral route.\n\nDeliberate release would require the contamination of food by live organisms, most likely in liquid form, although they could also be prepared in an aerosolised form for more widespread release and surface contamination.\n\nThe mode of exposure for these organisms is by ingestion.\n\nSymptoms typically begin within 36 hours from time of exposure.\n\nThe primary feature of these infections is diarrhoea. Inflammation of the small bowel by bacterial invasion and/or toxin release may result in bloody diarrhoea. Affected individuals often complain of fever, sweats and myalgia as well. Vomiting and abdominal pain are associated most with Salmonella infection. Systemic features may follow with septicaemia and septic shock.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. Standard barrier precautions and strict hand washing should be considered appropriate in order to prevent secondary exposure via the faecal-oral route. Dehydration and 4 Responding to Terrorism: A Medical Handbook electrolyte disturbances caused by diarrhoea and vomiting are the main clinical issues for the majority of affected individuals. Those with a severe systemic illness may require critical care support and antibiotic therapy may also be considered (see below).\n\nThe diagnosis is most often provided by demonstration of specific organisms in stool samples by Gram stain, and culture. Bloody diarrhoea may result in normocytic anaemia and, in the case of bacteraemia, an elevated white cell count.\n\nMore severe cases may benefit from antibiotic therapy, which may also shorten the duration of the illness. Antibiotic treatment may itself result in diarrhoea. Ciprofloxacin is the antibiotic of choice. The adult regimen is 500 mg orally every 12 hours for between 7 and 10 days. The use of ciprofloxacin is not advised in children due to the risk of arthropathies, although where the benefit outweighs this risk the dosage is 5-15 mg/kg orally every 12 hours. More severe infections may be treated initially by intravenous antibiotic therapy.\n\nMost cases of food-borne gastrointestinal illness resolve spontaneously. Shigella and Salmonella infections have also been associated with Reiter's syndrome or reactive arthritis. Salmonella may also lead to osteomyelitis and endocarditis. They are also associated with haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) in children.\n\nTyphoid, caused by S. typhi infection, presents as a high 'stepwise' fever associated with bacteraemia and development of the pathognomonic signs of a truncal rash with salmon-coloured maculopapular lesions after around 1 week. Typical symptoms also include myalgias, abdominal pain and constipation. Enteric fever caused by S. typhi typically lasts for 3-4 weeks before symptoms resolve, even in untreated cases. However, systemic progression occurs in approximately 15% of cases of S. typhi infections with subsequent risk of mortality or organ damage. Chronic carriers of S. typhi may require cholecystectomy, as the gall bladder is often the reservoir of the organism.\n\nGlanders is caused by the small aerobic Gram-negative bacillus Burkholderia mallei and is primarily a disease of horses, donkeys and mules. Human cases are extremely rare in developed countries. In the UK, a single confirmed case without a reasonable history of occupational exposure suggests a deliberate release. The animal disease no longer occurs in the UK, although cases still occur in Turkey and some parts of the Middle East, Africa and Asia.\n\nGlanders is a zoonosis and mainly affects horses, donkeys and mules. Human exposure may occur as a result of close contact with an infected animal or carcass, or by laboratory exposure. The bacteria do not grow in water, soil or plants.\n\nDeliberate release as a bioweapon would be most likely to involve the bacteria being prepared in an aerosol form to be sprayed into the air and breathed in. The specific characteristics of such a preparation are not known.\n\nExposure to the bacteria that cause glanders may occur by absorption through mucous membranes of the mouth, eyes or nose and by inhalation. It may also enter via abrasions or cuts to the skin.\n\nThe normal incubation period for human disease is 10-14 days.\n\nThe symptoms and signs of glanders depend upon the mechanism of exposure. They are described in Table 4 .8.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. If a diagnosis of glanders is suspected, the case should be discussed urgently with a consultant microbiologist. Person-to-person transmission is very unlikely, although not impossible, and barrier precautions must be maintained as a matter of course. If deliberate aerosol release is suspected, PPE must be worn and appropriate decontamination carried out with safe disposal of clothing as described (p. 74-78).\n\nThe disease may be suspected in cases of cavitating pneumonia unresponsive to standard therapies or cases of severe febrile illness associated 4 Responding to Terrorism: A Medical Handbook with eye infections, visceral abscesses or bloody nasal discharge. Samples of blood, urine, sputum and any pus from skin lesions should be taken, preferably before commencing antibiotics. Pulmonary tuberculosis should be excluded if there are lung lesions. Antibody testing is slow (2-3 weeks) but may assist in confirming the diagnosis.\n\nInitial antibiotic management regimens are described in Table 4 .9. Antibiotic therapy may be required for up to 6 months in severe cases. Surgical drainage of abscesses may also be considered. Pus and other body fluids should be considered an infectious risk. There is no available vaccine.\n\nThe bacteria causing glanders have a limited persistency in water or soil. Heating to over 74 C and the ultraviolet (UV) rays of sunlight over the course of a few hours kill them. Standard hypochlorite solutions are effective for routine decontamination.\n\nDeath rates within 3-4 weeks approach 100% if untreated, especially with Burkholderia mallei septicaemia. There are very few data on which to advise survival rates with the rapid initiation of antibiotic therapy. The disease may relapse or recur, and long-term follow-up (minimum of 5 years) is recommended. A chronic form of the disease may occur but is thought to be less likely in an aerosol attack.\n\nThe symptoms and treatment of glanders are very similar to those of melioidosis (see p. 162). \n\nMelioidosis is caused by the facultative intracellular Gram-negative bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei. The organism is closely related to B. mallei (glanders), although the disease is distinctive in a number of ways. While the disease does not occur naturally in the UK, it is found in South and South-East Asia, particularly in rice paddies, in Northern Australia, Africa and Southern America. Unlike glanders, melioidosis has been known to cause human epidemics.\n\nThe organism can be found in soil and water, thought to be the primary route of exposure for humans. As with glanders, horses are a major natural reservoir for the disease. It may also be found in goats, monkeys and rodents. Occupational risk exists for rice farmers, agricultural workers and laboratory staff.\n\nDeliberate release as a bioweapon would be most likely to involve the bacteria being prepared in an aerosol form. The specific characteristics of such a preparation are not known.\n\nExposure can occur via inhalation, ingestion or direct contact through abrasions or cuts to the skin with contaminated water or dust.\n\nThe incubation period for melioidosis is extremely variable. Acute infection may occur over 1 -21 days (mean 9 days) although the disease can appear years after exposure, more likely in immunocompromised individuals or those with chronic medical conditions such as diabetes.\n\nThe clinical features of melioidosis depend upon the route of exposure and are highly variable. For this reason the disease is known as a 'mimicker'. The main symptoms and signs are shown in Table 4 .10. Bacteraemic seeding may result in deep tissue abscesses.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. If a diagnosis of melioidosis is suspected, the case should be discussed urgently with a consultant microbiologist. Person-to-person transmission is very unlikely and standard precautions should be maintained, although immunocompromised staff should be excluded from direct patient care.\n\nIf deliberate aerosol release is suspected, PPE must be worn and appropriate decontamination carried out with safe disposal of clothing as described (p. 74-78).\n\nCultures should be taken of blood, urine and sputum (and pus in the case of skin lesions), preferably before commencing antibiotics. Negative cultures are common. Chest radiography may demonstrate single or multiple nodular lesions with later coalescence and cavitation.\n\nB. pseudomallei is highly resistant to many antibiotics, including aminoglycosides. Initial antibiotic management regimens are described in Table 4 .11. Abscesses may require surgical drainage. There is no vaccine for melioidosis.\n\nThe organism persists in the environment by attaching itself to organic debris in soil, streams and pools of water. It can also survive for long periods in arid conditions. Decontamination can be carried out with standard disinfectant solutions, such as 0.5% sodium hypochlorite.\n\nSepticaemic, or disseminated, melioidosis has 100% mortality if untreated and around 40% mortality with treatment. Recovery is more common from the other forms of infection with treatment (approximately 20% overall). Chronic melioidosis may occur in about 3% of infected individuals and is a multi-system disease affecting any organ. Long-term follow-up after treatment is required (minimum 5 years) as the disease may relapse or recur.\n\nMelioidosis is also known as Whitmore's disease. Around 1 or 2 cases are imported into the UK per year. \n\nPlague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, a small Gramnegative coccobacillus. There are three types of plague caused by the same organism: bubonic, pneumonic and septicaemic. The disease does not occur naturally in the UK, although it may still occur in Africa, Asia and the Americas (including the USA). Bubonic plague historically resulted in millions of deaths worldwide and killed around 25 million people in Europe during the fourteenth century.\n\nPlague is a zoonosis: rodents, rabbits and, rarely, cats are the main natural reservoir for the disease. Human contact is usually from an insect vector, such as a flea, that has fed on an infected animal. The disease may also be spread from person to person by inhalation of droplets released by an infected person coughing. Strains of plague bacteria are held in protected laboratories and therefore laboratory workers may also be at risk of accidental exposure.\n\nDeliberate release as a bioweapon would be most likely to involve the bacteria being prepared in an aerosol form in order to cause pneumonic plague. The specific characteristics of such a preparation are not known, although the degree of technical sophistication needed to cause mass infection would be high. However, this has been achieved in the past by some nations' bioweapon programmes.\n\nExposure can occur via inhalation, bites from infected insect vectors or by direct contact with infected material through abrasions or cuts to the skin. Bubonic plague is less likely to spread in developed countries than in the times of the great plagues due to improvements in general living conditions and sanitation.\n\nThe overall incubation period for plague is between 1 and 8 days following exposure. Progression of bubonic or pneumonic plague may result in septicaemic plague.\n\nThe clinical features of plague depend upon the route of exposure.\n\nThe main symptoms and signs are shown in Table 4 .12. A plague epidemic may at first appear to be an outbreak of influenza. Even a single case of plague acquired in the UK would suggest deliberate 4 Responding to Terrorism: A Medical Handbook release. Rare presentations include plague meningitis and pharyngeal plague.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. If a diagnosis of plague is suspected, the case should be discussed urgently with a consultant microbiologist. Affected areas such as mucous membranes, eyes and skin should be rinsed with plenty of water. Person-to-person transmission is possible and appropriate precautions should be taken including the wearing of facemasks. If deliberate aerosol release is suspected, PPE must be worn and appropriate decontamination carried out with safe disposal of clothing as described (p. 74-78). Post-exposure prophylaxis should be arranged for close contacts (see p. 214).\n\nCultures should be taken of blood, urine and sputum, preferably before commencing antibiotics. Lymph node, pleural fluid or CSF may show bacterial growth after 24-48 hours. Chest radiography may demonstrate multilobar consolidation, bilateral infiltrates or pleural effusions.\n\nY. pestis is sensitive to several antibiotics. Initial antibiotic management regimens are described in Table 4 .13. Respiratory failure may complicate pneumonic plague. A vaccine for bubonic plague is not currently available.\n\nPlague bacteria are sensitive to sunlight, heat and disinfectants and will usually only persist for up to 1 hour after release. Decontamination can be carried out with standard disinfectant solutions, such as 0.5% sodium hypochlorite. Control of rodent and small-animal populations will be required to prevent spread. \n\nBubonic plague has a mortality of around 50-60%. Septicaemic and pneumonic plague has 100% mortality if untreated. Even if treated, pneumonic plague has up to 50% mortality. \n\nPsittacosis is caused by the small intracellular bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci. It is a rare illness resulting in fewer than 100 cases per year in the UK. There are several serotypes. Type A is endemic among parrots with only sporadic disease in humans and other mammals. Type B is endemic among pigeons and has also been isolated from turkeys. Types C and D are occupational hazards for slaughterhouse workers and for people in contact with birds. Psittacosis was investigated for use as a biological weapon by several nations, including the USA and Russia.\n\nPsittacosis is a zoonotic infectious disease mainly carried by parrots, but is also found in pigeons, sparrows, ducks, hens, gulls and many other species of bird. Infected birds usually shed bacteria through faeces and nasal discharges, although bacteria can also be transmitted via feathers and eggs. The disease can also occasionally be found in sheep, goats and cats. Occupational human exposure can occur in slaughterhouse, pet shop and veterinary workers. Bird owners are most commonly affected due to regular and close exposure to the causative organism.\n\nBacteria would need to be dispersed in an aerosolised form. Birds are also ideal vectors for the distribution of psittacosis. An indirect attack could therefore potentially involve the intentional infection and release of a large number of birds.\n\nChlamydophila psittaci is transmitted by inhalation, close contact or ingestion among birds, and by droplet spread and inhalation to mammals. Person-to-person transmission is rare.\n\nThe usual incubation period is between 5 and 14 days. Respiratory symptoms usually appear no later than 5 days after the fever symptoms begin.\n\nPsittacosis in humans often starts with general flu-like symptoms.\n\nHeadache and fever usually progress over a 3-4 day period, following which respiratory symptoms begin to appear. Frequently occurring symptoms are shown in Table 4 .14. The spectrum of illness can range from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. The risk of person-to-person transmission is minimal; therefore standard precautions should be considered appropriate. However, in the case of a suspected recent aerosolised release there may be remaining surface contamination with persisting viable bacteria. If so, PPE must be worn and appropriate decontamination carried out with safe disposal of clothing as described (p. 74-78).\n\nChest radiographs are abnormal in around 75% of patients with psittacosis. The disease can usually be confirmed via an antigen and antibody test. A PCR-based test is also available. The typical presentation is of an atypical pneumonia with splenomegaly associated with a significant exposure history.\n\nSee Table 4 .15 for antibiotic treatment regimens. Severe pneumonia may require management in a critical care environment such as ventilatory support.\n\nThe bacterium exists as an elementary body in between hosts. This is not biologically active but is resistant to environmental stresses and can survive outside a host.\n\nFew fatal cases have been reported (less than 1% of cases). Remission with appropriate treatment should occur within 48-72 hours. Relapse may occur and treatment must therefore continue for at least 2 weeks after the fever abates. \n\nGestational psittacosis may rarely affect pregnant women, resulting in pneumonia, sepsis and placental insufficiency. \n\nBrief description Q fever is caused by the small obligate intracellular Gram-negative coccobacillus Coxiella burnetii and is primarily a disease of livestock with a worldwide distribution. Around 50-100 cases of human infection are reported per year in the UK. Although there are reports that the Soviet Union attempted to weaponise it, Q fever is considered difficult to develop as a bioweapon.\n\nQ fever is a zoonosis and mainly affects cattle, sheep and goats. Infected animals are typically asymptomatic and shed the organism in bodily fluids, the highest concentrations being found in products of gestation including placenta and amniotic fluid. Human exposure therefore occurs from contact with these materials. Infection may also rarely occur from ingestion of contaminated foods or liquids.\n\nThe bacteria causing Q fever may be developed into an aerosol form for airborne release. The specific characteristics of such a form of release are not known.\n\nThe main route of exposure for Q fever is by inhalation of the bacteria. Exposure by other routes, such as ingestion or transmission by an insect vector, is rare. The infectious dose is very low: a single bacterium is enough to cause infection.\n\nThe incubation period for acute Q fever is 14-21 days (range 4-40 days). A larger infective dose may reduce this duration. Chronic Q fever may occur many years after the initial exposure if untreated.\n\nFifty per cent of human infections are asymptomatic. The symptoms and signs of acute and chronic Q fever are described in Table 4 .16. The chronic form of the disease occurs in around 5% of cases with ongoing symptoms of endocarditis for many years. Most patients who go on to develop this form of the disease have a pre-existing heart valve abnormality or a prosthetic valve.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. If a diagnosis of Q fever is suspected, the case should be discussed urgently with a consultant microbiologist. Person-to-person transmission is very unlikely and standard barrier 4 Responding to Terrorism: A Medical Handbook precautions should be sufficient. If a deliberate aerosol release is suspected, PPE must be worn and appropriate decontamination carried out with safe disposal of clothing as described (p. 74-78).\n\nThe diagnosis is serological requiring an initial blood culture sample and another at least 28 days after onset. Histology (i.e. liver biopsy) and immunocytochemistry are also helpful. Chest radiography is abnormal in 50% of symptomatic cases and may demonstrate lobar consolidation, enlarged hilar nodes and patchy infiltrates. Liver function tests may be raised (transaminases up to 2-3 times normal).\n\nAlthough the disease is usually self-limiting, antibiotic therapy will reduce the risk of chronic infection and hasten recovery. Antibiotic regimens are shown in Table 4 .17. Signs of endocarditis will require Biological Agents referral to a cardiologist and surgical management may be indicated. Treatment response is indicated by resolution of fever and associated symptoms (usually within 2-3 days). A vaccine for Q fever is available to animal workers at risk in Australia but is not available in the UK.\n\nLike anthrax, the bacterium causing Q fever can go into a spore form that enables it to resist environmental conditions and survive for many weeks, or even years. The spore form is resistant to heat, drying, sunlight and many common disinfectants.\n\nAcute Q fever is not usually fatal and most patients recover within a month even without treatment. Research has shown that the death rate in untreated individuals with the disease is around 2-4%. Chronic Q fever may lead to ongoing symptoms for up to 20 years, or longer, and is associated with higher mortality (up to 70%).\n\nExposure to Q fever organisms in pregnant women may lead to high rates of foetal infection and the subsequent risk of miscarriage.\n\nTularaemia is caused by the tiny intracellular Gram-negative coccobacillus Francisella tularensis and is primarily carried by small mammals. Several different infective biovars exist. The disease does not occur naturally in the UK but is common in parts of rural Europe, Asia, the Americas and Australasia. Tularaemia is considered to be one of the most highly communicable bacterial pathogens known.\n\nTularaemia is a zoonosis and mainly affects small mammals such as rabbits or voles. Infection may occur from the bite of an infected insect vector such as a tick or mosquito, from handling infected animals, from breathing in aerosolised bacteria (i.e. from contaminated dust) or by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Occupational risk in the UK is mainly from laboratory work. Outside the UK, exposure may occur from hunting or farming work in endemic areas.\n\nDeliberate release is likely to be via an aerosolised form resulting in inhalational exposure. The specific characteristics of such a form are unknown.\n\nThe main routes of exposure to the organism are inhalation, ingestion, bites from insect vectors or direct contact with eyes or abraded skin.\n\nThe mean incubation period is 3-5 days (ranging from 2 to 20 days).\n\nThe initial symptoms and signs of tularaemia depend upon the mode of exposure. These are shown in Table 4 .18. Without appropriate treatment the infection may progress to a pneumonic or septicaemic form, as described in Table 4 .19. Pneumonic tularaemia may also occur primarily from inhalational exposure.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. If a diagnosis of tularaemia is suspected, the case should be discussed urgently with a consultant microbiologist. Person-to-person transmission is very unlikely and standard barrier precautions should be sufficient. If a deliberate aerosol release is suspected, PPE must be worn and appropriate decontamination carried out with safe disposal of clothing as described (p. 74-78).\n\nCulture of the tularaemia organism is difficult and multiple blood samples may be required. Other samples such as throat swabs, gastric aspirates, swabs of ulcer lesions or sputum may also be useful for PCR or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). If possible, cultures should be taken before starting antibiotics. Chest radiography may demonstrate multilobar infiltrates (50% of cases) or pleural effusions (15% of cases).\n\nIf tularaemia is suspected but not confirmed then an aminoglycoside antibiotic (such as gentamicin) at standard doses should be added to the existing treatment appropriate to the presentation (e.g. community-acquired pneumonia). Once the diagnosis is confirmed, a specific antibiotic regimen should be started, as shown in Table 4 .20. Dermatology opinion should be sought for skin lesions and biopsy may be indicated for histology or PCR. \n\nDespite its inability to form spores, the organism can remain alive in water, soil and animal carcasses for many weeks. It may persist even longer in cold, moist conditions. However, it is susceptible to mild heat and standard disinfectants.\n\nOverall mortality from tularaemia is less than 2% in treated individuals, and between 5% and 15% if untreated. Mortality from pneumonic tularaemia is 30-60%. Survivors of pneumonic tularaemia may develop chronic pulmonary disease changes with fibrosis. Ocular disease may cause permanent scarring.\n\nA live attenuated vaccine has been developed for immunisation of laboratory workers. However, this is unlicensed for general use and is thought to be only partially effective against inhalation exposure and pneumonic disease. \n\nCommonly implicated water-borne pathogens include Vibrio cholerae, Cryptosporidium parvum and hepatitis A. The pathophysiology and clinical presentation of these, and numerous other examples, are well described in the wider literature. However, they are also relevant from a biological weapons perspective due to the capacity to cause widespread illness by their intentional release into water supplies. Natural epidemics also occur sporadically throughout the world. Most UK cases are imported by infected travellers.\n\nVibrios, causing cholera, are amongst the most common water-carried organisms in the world and can inhabit both marine and freshwater sources. Drinking from infected water sources is usually the cause, although consumption of contaminated seafood is also common, especially in developed nations. Up to 90% of all untreated water is contaminated with cryptosporidium cysts.\n\nDeliberate release would require contamination of water sources by organisms.\n\nThe mode of exposure for these organisms is by ingestion. Person-toperson transmission is via the faecal-oral route.\n\nIncubation periods for water-borne diseases vary considerably between causative organisms. Cholera has an incubation period of around 5 days, while cryptosporidiosis has an incubation period of approximately 14 days.\n\nCholera causes sudden onset of copious, non-bloody, watery 'ricewater' diarrhoea with abdominal pain. Vomiting and fever are typically absent. Cryptosporidiosis also causes severe watery diarrhoea and abdominal pain, and is commonly associated with a low-grade fever and vomiting. Cholera can result in rapid fluid loss of up to 1 litre per hour with concomitant losses of electrolytes. Dehydration due to large volume loss occurs later and can present with postural hypotension, tachycardia and shock in severe cases.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. Standard barrier precautions and strict hand washing should be considered appropriate in order to prevent secondary exposure via the faecal-oral route. Dehydration and electrolyte disturbances caused by diarrhoea and vomiting are the main clinical issues for the majority of affected individuals.\n\nThe diagnosis is most often provided by demonstration of specific organisms in stool samples. In a wide-scale outbreak, cholera is most often diagnosed clinically due to the typical nature of the diarrhoea. PCR tests can diagnose C. parvum.\n\nFor large outbreaks, oral rehydration solutions ( \n\nCryptosporidium cysts are quite hardy and can withstand most conventional water treatment systems, including many common disinfectants. However, they are vulnerable to ultraviolet light, boiling and ozonation.\n\nIf properly treated with appropriate fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy, cholera has less than 1% mortality. Untreated cases have a mortality of up to 40%. Mortality from C. parvum infection is generally reported as low.\n\nCryptosporidium tends more commonly to affect the very young, the elderly or the immunocompromised.\n\nArenaviridae are one of the four major groups of viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF) and include two serogroups distinguished by their geographical distribution. Examples include Lassa fever ('Old World') and the Argentine, Bolivian and Venezuelan haemorrhagic fevers ('New World'). Wild animals are the normal host for these viruses and none of the VHF exists naturally in the UK. The very few cases that have been detected in the UK have all been imported. The WHO estimates that the number of Lassa fever cases per year is between 300 000 and 500 000 across West Africa, with around 5000 deaths.\n\nRodents such as rats and mice are the main reservoirs for all VHF. The virus is usually excreted in faeces and urine. Lassa fever is known to be endemic across much of West Africa. New World VHF originate in South America.\n\nVHF could potentially be weaponised by preparation into an aerosolised form that could then be delivered by spraying equipment or by introduction into the ventilation system of a building. Theoretically, a VHF infection could be introduced into an insect vector population and then released to spread infection to humans.\n\nNatural transmission of VHF to humans usually occurs from contact with infected animals, or through the bite of an infected insect vector such as a tick. The virus can also be spread by person-to-person transmission via any body fluid. Sexual transmission of Lassa virus has been reported. Lassa fever may also be spread by inhalation of airborne particles from the excretions of infected rodents, although there is no documented evidence of human-to-human airborne transmission.\n\nThe incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 3 to 21 days. Symptoms of New World haemorrhagic fever typically develop over 7-14 days.\n\nBy definition, the cardinal features of all VHF are fever and bleeding diatheses. The aetiology of the coagulopathy is most likely due to multi-system disease. Around 80% of human Lassa fever cases are 4 Responding to Terrorism: A Medical Handbook asymptomatic. Onset of Arenaviridae infection is usually gradual with non-specific flu-like symptoms initially. Conjunctival inflammation, retrosternal pain, tremors and seizures, and bleeding from eyes and mucous membranes occur later. Severe cases may progress to develop head and neck swelling, pulmonary oedema, pericardial effusion and multi-system disease.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. In the case of suspected recent intentional release in an aerosolised form, the remaining contamination must be removed by appropriate decontamination. Strict VHF isolation procedures should be followed and PPE worn (see p. 146-147). Severe cases may require treatment in a critical care environment.\n\nAntiplatelet drugs such as aspirin should be avoided.\n\nVHF are difficult to diagnose in the early stages of the disease. Definitive diagnosis requires testing that is only available in highly specialised laboratories and is made by antigen detection.\n\nRibavirin is an effective treatment for Arenaviridae infections if given early. Antiviral therapy is usually administered intravenously, although multiple or milder cases may be treated orally. Dose regimens are shown in Table 4 .21. Blood product replacement therapy may be required in cases of severe haemorrhage.\n\nMortality from Lassa fever is between 15% and 20%. Death usually occurs within 14 days of onset in fatal cases. In milder cases the patient recovers within 2-8 days. Neurological deafness occurs in up to 33% of patients, of whom half recover some function after 1-3 \n\nAvian influenza, colloquially known as 'bird flu', is a zoonotic infection. Avian influenza viruses are highly species-specific but have, on rare occasions, crossed the species barrier to infect humans. Influenza A viruses have 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes, although only the H5 and H7 subtypes are known to cause the highly pathogenic form of the disease, of which H5N1 is of most concern. The most severe outbreak on record began in South-East Asia in mid 2003. To date, laboratory-confirmed human cases have been reported in Southern China, Hong Kong, Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. The virus is now considered endemic in many parts of South-East Asia. Viral mutation via the animal reservoir could result in a highly infectious form of the virus amongst humans, and could instigate a global pandemic.\n\nAvian influenza normally only infects birds, and occasionally pigs. Migratory birds have been noted to spread the H5N1 virus directly in its highly pathogenic form. Although rare, there is a risk of viral transmission from poultry to humans.\n\nFeatures of a deliberate release are undefined and may be impossible to differentiate from natural exposure. Intentional release could be brought about by distribution of a sufficient number of infected birds into the wider population.\n\nDirect contact with infected poultry, or surfaces and objects contaminated by their faeces, is presently considered the main route of human infection. Most human cases have occurred in rural or peri-urban areas where households keep small poultry flocks, which often roam freely. Cooked food does not appear to transmit avian influenza. Human-to-human transmission is rare and has only occurred in association with outbreaks in poultry. To date the virus has not spread beyond the first generation of close contacts, and occurs only in small clusters.\n\nProphylactic antiviral therapy and health monitoring are recommended for individuals with high poultry contact in areas affected by avian influenza.\n\nMost cases have occurred in previously healthy children and young adults. Symptoms usually appear within a few days of exposure.\n\nThe presenting signs and symptoms of A(H5N1) illness are nonspecific with typical features of an acute febrile respiratory illness (e.g. fever >38 C, cough and shortness of breath). However, the disease follows an unusually aggressive clinical course with rapid deterioration and high mortality.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. Suspected cases severe enough to require hospital admission should be isolated, ideally in a negative-pressure room, with standard plus droplet infection control precautions maintained. Health care workers should wear appropriate eye protection, gowns, gloves and FFP2 respirators during aerosol-generating procedures. Once the patient no longer requires hospitalisation, discharge to home care is reasonable.\n\nRecognition relies upon establishing a history of exposure from a high-risk source. Specimens for H5N1 diagnosis should be collected according to WHO guidance and tested at one of the laboratories recognized as capable of diagnosing H5N1. Collection of multiple respiratory specimens (including nasal, throat and endotracheal aspirates from intubated patients) from patients suspected to have H5N1 should be done, preferably before antiviral therapy has been commenced. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be utilised to identify specific influenza virus genomes. Immunofluorescence assay can also be used for identification of influenza viruses in cell cultures.\n\nOseltamivir (Tamiflu) remains the primary recommended antiviral treatment. Observational data on treatment with oseltamivir in the early stages of the disease suggest its usefulness in reducing A (H5N1) virus infection-associated mortality. Dose regimens are 75 mg b.d. for adults and 1-2 mg/kg b.d. for children. Treatment doses should be reduced to once daily for patients with renal impairment. A standard 5-day course of therapy should be administered, unless an alternative diagnosis is established. If no clinical improvement has been observed after a standard 5-day course, therapy may be extended for a further 5 days.\n\nAntibiotic therapy is generally only indicated for cases of secondary bacterial infection following primary viral pneumonia, especially in the case of late-onset pneumonia. Corticosteroids should not be used routinely, but may be considered for septic shock with demonstrable adrenal insufficiency.\n\nCritical care interventions are likely to be required. Non-invasive ventilation is relatively contraindicated due to the associated 4 Responding to Terrorism: A Medical Handbook increased risk of generating potentially infectious aerosols. There appears to be a high incidence of pneumothorax in critically ill A (H5N1) virus-infected patients.\n\nThe H5N1 virus is sensitive to heat. Normal temperatures used for cooking (at least 70 C in all parts of the food) will kill the virus.\n\nThe cumulative case-fatality proportion is approximately 60%. Respiratory failure is a major complication, and many cases progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure.\n\nNew human H5N1 influenza vaccines are available, although further research is still required to investigate their effectiveness. Vaccination could be used to protect high-risk populations and to try to contain emergence of a potential pandemic. Available data do not go beyond 16 months for vaccine protection. Currently formulated H5N1 vaccines require at least two doses to be administered, 21 days apart, in order to provide reliable rates of sero-response.\n\nBunyaviridae are one of the four major groups of viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF) and include the members of the hantavirus genus that cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), the Congo-Crimean haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, and the Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus. Wild animals are the normal host for these viruses and none of the VHF exists naturally in the UK. The very few cases that have been detected in the UK have all been imported. Occasional outbreaks of RVF are usually confined to Africa. Around 150 000-200 000 cases of hantavirus infection requiring hospital treatment are reported worldwide each year. Over 50% of these are reported in China.\n\nRodents such as rats and mice are the main reservoirs for all VHF. HFRS occurs in Korea, Scandinavia, Russia and the American southwest. CCHF occurs in the Crimea, Balkans, Africa and Central and South Asia.\n\nVHF could potentially be weaponised by preparation into an aerosolised form that could then be delivered by spraying equipment or by introduction into the ventilation system of a building. Theoretically, a VHF infection could be introduced into an insect vector population and then released to spread infection to humans.\n\nRVF is transmitted by infected mosquitoes and CCHF is transmitted by infected ticks. Hantaviruses are transmitted through contact (usually inhalation of contaminated dust) with the faeces of certain rodents. The risk of person-to-person transmission of CCHF is considered to be high.\n\nThe incubation period for CCHF ranges from 1 to 12 days. The incubation period for RVF is between 2 and 5 days. Hantavirus infections vary in incubation period from 9 to 35 days.\n\nBy definition, the cardinal features of all VHF are fever and bleeding diatheses. The aetiology of the coagulopathy in Bunyaviridae infection is most probably due to multi-system disease. Initial symptoms include a non-specific flu-like illness, conjunctival inflammation and petechial rash. CCHF patients typically present with an abrupt febrile prodrome. Hantavirus patients commonly experience severe headache and back pains. Less than 1% of RVF patients develop haemorrhagic symptoms. Bleeding occurs in around 75% of CCHF cases, usually beginning by the fourth or fifth day. CNS signs occur in around 20% of CCHF patients.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. In the case of suspected recent intentional release in an aerosolised form the remaining contamination must be removed by appropriate decontamination. Strict VHF isolation procedures should be followed and PPE worn (see p. 146-147). Severe cases may require treatment in a critical care environment. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin should be avoided.\n\nVHF are difficult to diagnose in the early stages of the disease. Definitive diagnosis requires testing that is only available in highly specialised laboratories and is made by antigen detection.\n\nRibavirin is an effective treatment for Bunyaviridae infections if given early. Antiviral therapy is usually administered intravenously, although multiple or milder cases may be treated orally. Dose regimens are shown in Table 4 .21. Blood product replacement therapy may be required in cases of severe haemorrhage.\n\nMortality from RVF is less than 1%. Complications of RVF include encephalitis and hepato-renal failure. Mortality from hantavirus infections ranges between 1% and 15%. Hantavirus patients can take from weeks to months to recover. CCHF outbreaks have a reported mortality of 30-50%.\n\nVHF are especially severe in late pregnancy, with maternal death and/or foetal loss occurring in more than 80% of cases during the third trimester.\n\nNumerous viruses are responsible for infectious disease in which encephalitis or neurological symptoms are a significant component. Of these, alphaviruses are the principal organism of concern from a bioweapon perspective. Belonging to the Togaviridae family of viruses, alphaviruses have a worldwide distribution, although the main pathogens of interest are the 'New World' alphaviruses, which are mainly found in North and South America. These include Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and Western equine encephalitis (WEE) and are considered Category B agents. The main encephalitis-causing viruses are listed in Table 4 .22. None of these diseases occurs naturally in the UK.\n\nAll equine species are susceptible to infection with alphaviruses, including horses, donkeys and zebras. Naturally occurring cases tend to follow established geographical and seasonal patterns. Variation from these patterns may suggest a deliberate attack. Animal reservoirs may also include small mammals and birds.\n\nIntentional biological weapon release would be most likely to be in an aerosolised form. Insect vectors could also be a possible initial mode of release as well as acting as an effective propagation method from infected hosts to uninfected individuals. Signs, symptoms and rate of spread will occur more rapidly with deliberate release.\n\nNatural spread occurs as a result of bites from an infected mosquito. Exposure from a deliberate release would occur by inhalation of the organism and subsequent contact with mucosal membranes. Direct person-to-person transmission is not possible as an intermediate insect vector would be required. Inadvertent occupational exposure may occur as the result of laboratory work.\n\nThe incubation period of encephalitis-causing agents varies between organisms. A summary of incubation periods for the main pathogens is shown in Table 4 .22.\n\nCommon initial symptoms include a high fever, headache, malaise and myalgia. Photophobia is also a feature. Over the next few days 4 Responding to Terrorism: A Medical Handbook to a week, impairment of mental status is noted with focal neurological abnormalities, possible seizures and reduction in conscious level. More severe symptoms have a tendency to occur more frequently in children than adults.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. In the case of a suspected aerosolised release any surface contamination should be removed by appropriate decontamination measures with safe disposal of clothing as described (p. 74-78) . Person-to-person spread is very low-risk and standard infection control precautions will be appropriate.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid investigations will demonstrate elevated pressure, normal or elevated protein, normal glucose and a mildly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count in keeping with viral infection. ELISA IgM titres and PCR may be useful, although these tests are not widely available and specialised laboratory facilities will be required.\n\nAntiviral therapy has no proven benefit in alphavirus infections.\n\nMortality varies between organisms. See Table 4 .22 for information on individual organisms. Recovery usually occurs within 7-14 days following onset of symptoms. Less severe CNS dysfunction is associated with a higher probability of recovery. Neurological symptoms may persist in survivors.\n\nVaccinations are available for some individual encephalitis-causing organisms, including Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis. No alphavirus vaccines are currently available. \n\nThere is currently no definitive answer regarding which species is the natural reservoir. Bats have been suspected because of their ability to replicate Filoviridae-like viruses. Evidence from some outbreaks in Africa has suggested the source of the infection has been from killing and eating primates.\n\nVHF could potentially be weaponised by preparation into an aerosolised form that could then be delivered by spraying equipment or by introduction into the ventilation system of a building. Theoretically, a VHF infection could be introduced into an insect vector population and then released to spread infection to humans.\n\nThe route of transmission from animals to humans is unknown. Filoviridae cases are associated with a high risk of person-to-person transmission and can occur via physical contact with infected bodily fluids.\n\nThe incubation period of Filoviridae infections ranges from 2 to 21 days. Usual incubation is around 1 week in Ebola infection and between 2 and 14 days for Marburg.\n\nBy definition, the cardinal features of all VHF are fever and bleeding diatheses. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is thought to underlie the haemorrhagic features of Filoviridae. Patients typically present with abrupt onset of febrile illness with diarrhoea, vomiting and shock. A maculopapular rash develops over the next few days.\n\nHaemorrhages usually start to occur by around the third day. Multiorgan failure with haemodynamic and pulmonary complications is common.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. In the case of suspected recent intentional release in an aerosolised form the remaining contamination must be removed by appropriate decontamination. Strict VHF isolation procedures should be followed and PPE worn (see p. 146-147). Severe cases may require treatment in a critical care environment. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin should be avoided.\n\nVHF are difficult to diagnose in the early stages of the disease. Definitive diagnosis requires testing that is only available in highly specialised laboratories and is made by antigen detection.\n\nRibavirin has not been shown to be an effective treatment for Filoviridae infections. Treatment is supportive in all cases and often requires critical care involvement. Blood product replacement therapy may be required in cases of severe haemorrhage.\n\nMortality in Filoviridae infection has been reported to be as high as 90% in outbreaks. Overall mortality for Ebola ranges from 50% to 90% and for Marburg it ranges from 25% to 70%. Around 60% of survivors continue to experience significant long-term physical and/ or psychological symptoms.\n\nVHF are especially severe in late pregnancy, with maternal death and/or foetal loss occurring in greater than 80% of cases during the third trimester.\n\nFlaviviridae are one of the four major groups of viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF) and include the Flavivirus genus responsible for yellow fever and dengue fever, as well as the West Nile and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. This section will deal mainly with yellow fever and dengue fever while encephalitis-causing viruses are discussed on page 186. The WHO estimates that yellow fever causes around 200 000 illnesses and 30 000 deaths every year in unvaccinated populations. Most cases arise in central Africa, although it is also endemic in numerous South American countries and several Caribbean islands. Over the last 20 years the number of yellow fever epidemics has risen. Dengue fever is generally found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide. The WHO currently estimates there may be 50 million dengue infections worldwide every year, and incidence is also increasing.\n\nMost flavivirus species have an animal reservoir; the exceptions are the yellow fever and dengue fever viruses, which are well adapted to humans and are not dependent upon any other host. Although many animals are infected with the virus, direct transmission to humans is unlikely without an arthropod vector.\n\nAny VHF could potentially be weaponised by preparation into an aerosolised form that could then be delivered by spraying equipment or by introduction into the ventilation system of a building. Intentional introduction of an appropriate insect vector could enhance the spread of disease between humans.\n\nYellow fever and dengue fever are transmitted by the bite from an infected Aedes (worldwide) or Haemogogus (South America) mosquito. Direct person-to-person transmission does not occur.\n\nThe incubation period of yellow fever is around 3-6 days. The incubation period of dengue fever is around 8-10 days.\n\nPatients typically present with non-specific flu-like symptoms lasting a few days, after which they usually recover. However, in yellow fever, around 15% of patients will enter a severe 'toxic phase' within 24 hours and develop jaundice, multi-organ failure and life-threatening haemorrhage. A similar disease pattern is seen in dengue fever, although the 'toxic phase' is much less common. An abrupt high fever begins and may last for 2-7 days. Hepatomegaly is typical and in severe cases is followed by cardiovascular shock, multi-organ failure and haemorrhage. Without appropriate medical care death can occur within 12-24 hours.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. In the case of suspected recent intentional release in an aerosolised form the remaining contamination must be removed by appropriate decontamination. Although person-to-person transmission is unlikely, standard VHF precaution should be maintained until flavivirus infection is confirmed. Strict VHF isolation procedures should be followed and PPE worn (see pp. 146-147).\n\nSevere cases may require treatment in a critical care environment.\n\nAntiplatelet drugs such as aspirin should be avoided.\n\nVHF are difficult to diagnose in the early stages of the disease. Definitive diagnosis requires testing that is available only in highly specialised laboratories. Serology assays may be used to detect yellow fever antibodies.\n\nThere is no known cure for either yellow fever or dengue fever and treatment is generally symptomatic with supportive care only. Despite some animal model evidence to suggest benefit, ribavirin has not yet been shown to be an effective treatment for either yellow or dengue fever in humans.\n\nHistorical records suggest that mortality from yellow fever is between 15% and 50%. During epidemics the fatality rate can be as high as 85%. The WHO states that, of the 15% of patients entering the 'toxic phase', half of that number die within 10-14 days, with the other half recovering fully. Around 2.5% of those affected by dengue fever will die, with mortality rates increasing up to 20% for those with haemorrhagic complications.\n\nThe yellow fever vaccine is safe and highly effective. Protective immunity occurs within 1 week in 95% of people vaccinated and lasts for at least 10 years. In order to prevent an epidemic, at least 80% of that country's population must be immunised.\n\nNo dengue fever vaccine is currently available. However, research is being conducted to develop an effective vaccine for public use, although this is unlikely to be available for another 5-10 years.\n\nBrief description SARS is caused by a human coronavirus. Since its discovery in 2003 there have been around 8000 human cases across more than 30 countries. The first suspected cases before the organism was identified occurred in Southern China in 2002. The disease then spread rapidly throughout the region and overseas as far as Canada. Other cases have occurred following laboratory exposure. The virus does not occur naturally in the UK.\n\nNo animal or other natural reservoir has yet been identified for SARS. The disease should be suspected if the patient has typical clinical features with a history of travel to a SARS area, had close contact with a known SARS case or worked in a laboratory with possible SARS exposure.\n\nThe features of a deliberate release are unknown, although airborne transmission is the major concern for this organism. Weaponisation into an airborne release form is theoretically possible. Infected individuals could also intentionally spread the disease by close contact in public areas, especially transit hubs such as airports, in order to cause widespread and indiscriminate, possibly worldwide, dissemination.\n\nDroplet transmission results from inhalation of the virus from respiratory secretions. The virus is also released in other bodily fluids and exposure could occur by mucosal contamination with these. Personto-person spread is rapid. Asymptomatic cases are not infectious.\n\nThe incubation period is between 3 and 7 days.\n\nTypical cases present with a fever of >38 C and cough, dyspnoea or breathing difficulty associated with a SARS-related travel, occupational or contact history in the last 10 days before onset of illness. The disease manifests initially with flu-like symptoms followed in the next few days by cough and breathing difficulty which may progress rapidly to respiratory failure, ARDS and death. Many cases are mild and do not progress to life-threatening respiratory disease.\n\nSupportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. Suspected cases severe enough to require hospital admission should be isolated, ideally in a negative-pressure room, with airborne spread precautions taken. Cases may not require hospital admission and can be treated at home with appropriate follow-up arrangements made for review at 48 hours. Health care workers should continue to observe airborne infection control precautions. All close contacts (household, 'face-to-face' and health care workers) within the last 10 days should be listed.\n\nInvestigations should include routine investigations for a suspected respiratory tract infection, including a chest radiograph, FBC, urea and electrolytes (U&Es), LFTs and blood and sputum cultures. Atypical pneumonia testing should include urinary Legionella and pneumococcal antigens, acute blood serology for mycoplasma, chlamydia, influenza A and B, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Testing should be coordinated by the local microbiologist in liaison with the Health Protection Agency (HPA) Centre for Infections.\n\nAntiviral drug therapy has not been proven to be effective. Treatment is supportive, although appropriate antibiotic therapy for communityacquired pneumonia should be initiated according to local guidelines in case SARS is later ruled out.\n\nOverall mortality during outbreaks is up to 15% in hospitalised cases with a greater mortality in the elderly and those with pre-existing respiratory disease. SARS is uncommon and usually less severe in children under 10 years of age. Patients are no longer infectious after 10 days from the resolution of fever symptoms.\n\nClinical guidelines for the treatment of SARS can be found on the British Thoracic Society and HPA websites.\n\nSmallpox is a highly contagious infection caused by the DNA orthopoxvirus, variola major. There is also a less serious form called variola minor. Smallpox eradication was certified in 1980 and the last remaining stocks are now held securely in two laboratories in the USA and Russia. The only possible sources of smallpox infection are therefore from accidental or deliberate release of these held stocks. Due to the cessation of the worldwide vaccination programme 30 years ago, the population is no longer immune to smallpox. Fifty million deaths a year occurred as recently as the 1950s. A single suspected case of smallpox would be considered a public health emergency.\n\nThe virus no longer exists in nature.\n\nAn aerosolised form would be required in order to enable widespread airborne release of the smallpox virus. This type of release system is thought to be technologically very difficult, although even a few cases could quickly spread in our modern, highly mobile and unvaccinated society.\n\nTransmission is by airborne droplets or by contact with skin sores or secretions.\n\nThe incubation period is usually 10-16 days, although the onset of symptoms may occur as early as 7 days after exposure.\n\nInhaled smallpox travels from the lungs to the lymph nodes and then via the blood stream to the spleen, liver and bone marrow before finally spreading to mucous membranes and the skin. The symptoms and timeline of smallpox infection are shown in Table 4 .23.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for smallpox. Supportive therapy should be started initially as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. If a diagnosis of smallpox is suspected, the case should be discussed urgently with a consultant microbiologist. Isolation and appropriate barrier precautions should be taken, including the wearing of facemasks. If a deliberate aerosol release is suspected, PPE must be worn and appropriate decontamination carried out with safe disposal of clothing as described (pp. 74-78) . Immediate vaccination to exposed individuals may prevent or attenuate the disease if given within 4 days of exposure.\n\nSmallpox has a similar clinical appearance to chickenpox. However, pustules develop more slowly and evolve together in smallpox compared to chickenpox. Lesions almost never form on the palms or soles of the feet in chickenpox, but are common with smallpox. The main differences between smallpox and chickenpox are shown in Table 4 .24. Aspirates from skin lesions and sputum may demonstrate virus by electron microscopy. However, specialist laboratory equipment and safety procedures are required to conduct this kind of testing.\n\nVaccination may prevent or lessen the disease or limit its spread. However, this is also associated with life-threatening reactions (estimated to be 15 per million first-time vaccinations). Antiviral agents are also available, although these are not proven to reduce mortality and are associated with serious side-effects.\n\nAn aerosolised form of smallpox virus is most stable at low temperatures and humidity and is therefore most persistent during cooler, dryer months such as winter and early spring. Variola virus can persist for up to 24 hours if not exposed to UV light. \n\nMortality for variola major is estimated at around 30% in untreated patients, and for variola minor it is around 1%. Cases are infectious from time of onset of fever until all the scabs have separated.\n\nA designated local Smallpox Diagnostic Expert (SDE) should be contacted for all suspected cases. If the diagnosis of smallpox remains likely the SDE will alert the Smallpox Management and Response Team (SMART) which will take over further investigation and treatment of the patient, and organise national responses. \n\nAflatoxin is a mycotoxin produced by several fungi, including Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. The toxin is considered a potential bioweapon threat by the WHO and is also a known carcinogen.\n\nA. flavus is the most common species in Africa and Asia, while A. parasiticus is predominant in America. Although allegedly developed as a bioweapon by Iraq in the 1980s and the period leading up to the first Gulf War in 1990, there is no evidence that it was ever used against the Allied forces. There are several different forms of varying toxicity. The most potent form, B1, is naturally occurring and would most likely be utilised for deliberate release. Toxin metabolites impair cell function and may cause hepatocellular carcinoma. The precise incidence of aflatoxin exposure and illness is unknown.\n\nThe fungi producing aflatoxin are found naturally worldwide and tend to grow on peanuts, cereal crops, tree nuts and in dairy products. It is estimated that up to 25% of the world's food crops are significantly contaminated with mycotoxins.\n\nDissemination could occur by intentional contamination of crops or food, or by aerosol release of the toxin.\n\nThe typical routes of toxin exposure are by ingestion and inhalation.\n\nThere is no person-to-person transmission.\n\nAflatoxins result in acute or chronic toxicity depending on the total dose. Precise durations from exposure to onset of symptoms are unknown.\n\nThe initial symptoms of aflatoxin toxicity depend on the route of exposure and are described in Table 4 .25. The severity of illness is related to the extent of toxin exposure, and acute hepatitis usually predominates in all significant cases. High-dose exposure may result in hepatic necrosis with the subsequent onset of hepatic failure, followed by cerebral oedema, coma and death.\n\nSupportive therapy should be initiated as directed by the clinical condition of the patient. There is no risk of person-to-person spread, 4 Responding to Terrorism: A Medical Handbook therefore standard precautions for infection control should apply. In the case of a suspected recent aerosolised release, PPE must be worn and appropriate decontamination carried out as described (pp. 74-78).\n\nThe diagnosis of aflatoxicosis will be difficult to make without a clear history of exposure as the features may mimic other causes of acute hepatitis. Blood testing may demonstrate raised liver function tests and prolongation of prothrombin time, although these are not specific to toxin exposure. Detection of the toxin by serum assay will require specialised laboratory services.\n\nTreatment is supportive in all cases. Critical care management may be required for severe systemic cases. Activated charcoal treatment may be advocated with the rapid recognition of toxin ingestion.\n\nFavourable conditions for the growth of fungus species that produce aflatoxins are a high moisture content and high temperature. In a dry state the toxin is stable at high temperatures. The effect of standard decontamination solutions, such as detergent or hypochlorite mixtures, on toxicity is unknown.\n\nHumans have a surprisingly high tolerance for aflatoxin exposure and rarely develop acute aflatoxicosis. Cases are often sub-clinical or mild in nature. Long-term effects of chronic exposure may include cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. \n\nBotulinum toxin is a neurotoxin produced by the anaerobic bacillus Clostridium botulinum and is one of the most toxic naturally occurring substances in the world. A few kilograms, if evenly dispersed and inhaled, could theoretically kill every human being on the planet. First isolated in 1895, there are now understood to be seven serologically distinct toxin types, A-G. Natural human disease is most commonly caused by A, B, C or E types. The toxin acts by blocking acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction causing a flaccid paralysis. Despite its lethality, the toxin has several medical uses, including treatment of dystonias, muscle spasticity and hyperhidrosis as well as its application in cosmetic surgery. The last UK outbreak of botulism occurred in 1989, with 27 cases.\n\nC. botulinum spores are found in soil practically worldwide.\n\nDeliberate release would most likely occur in an aerosolised form.\n\n'Natural' exposure is usually the result of ingestion of food that has become contaminated with the toxin, or from local toxin production in wounds infected with C. botulinum. Exposure could also result from inhalation of the toxin in a pure form.\n\nRapidity of onset depends upon the dose and type of exposure. Onset from ingestion of toxin is between 2 hours and 8 days, and from inhalation between 1 and 36 hours.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of botulinum toxin exposure can be divided into early and late, and are summarised in Table 4 .26. All serotypes and modes of exposure would result in the same symptoms. Sensory nerve impairment is typically absent. The presence of a fever should suggest a cause other than botulism.\n\nSupportive treatment should be initiated as directed by the clinical condition of the casualty. If the diagnosis is suspected the case should be discussed urgently with a consultant microbiologist. There is no risk of person-to-person spread and standard precautions should be considered appropriate. In the case of a suspected aerosolised release of the toxin there may be remaining surface contamination. If so, PPE 4 Responding to Terrorism: A Medical Handbook must be worn and appropriate decontamination carried out with safe disposal of clothing as described (pp. 74-78).\n\nSamples of serum (10 ml) and faeces (10 mg) should be taken and further samples as appropriate such as sputum or wound pus swabs. Toxin detection will need to be carried out by a specialist reference laboratory and should be requested before the use of antitoxin therapy due to the lag phase of 1-2 days. The diagnosis of botulism may be excluded by tests to rule out other causes such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome or myasthenia gravis. This may require lumbar puncture and CSF investigations, CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) head scan, electromyography (EMG) and anticholinesterase (Tensilon) testing.\n\nA botulinum antitoxin is available and can be obtained from stores held in regional centres and the HPA Centre for Infections as well as Porton Down. The decision to use antitoxin therapy will usually be made by a senior infectious diseases clinician and should rely on clinical or historical features rather than laboratory test results. Surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy may be indicated for suspected wound botulism. Respiratory failure may require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation with subsequent monitoring and treatment in a critical care environment.\n\nThe toxin itself is rapidly destroyed by heat, such as in thorough cooking, although the spores themselves are quite heat-tolerant and can survive boiling at 100 C. Adequate cooking of food and chlorination of water will usually inactivate the toxin.\n\nDeath is generally due to respiratory failure secondary to paralysis of the respiratory muscles. The case-fatality rate for botulinum poisoning is between 7.5% and 15%. Mortality from inhalational botulism is thought to be higher than for food-borne exposure. Functional recovery may take several months to a year and some patients continue to experience chronic fatigue and dyspnoea for many years after. \n\nEpsilon toxin is produced by the bacterium Clostridium perfringens. The toxin is mainly responsible for fatal livestock disease, although little is known about its effects on humans. It is thought to be one of the most potent biotoxins after botulism. The toxin is inactive until the host organism inadvertently activates it.\n\nC. perfringens is a spore-forming bacterium. It is present in almost all soil worldwide and is also carried by some animals in their gastrointestinal tract.\n\nEpsilon toxin would most likely be developed into an aerosolised form for deliberate airborne release.\n\nNatural exposure to Epsilon toxin usually occurs via ingestion of the bacteria with subsequent release of the toxin in the gastrointestinal tract. It may also cause illness directly by inhalation. There is no person-to-person spread.\n\nInhalation of the toxin usually results in symptoms within a few hours. Ingestion usually leads to symptoms after 8-24 hours.\n\nSymptoms and signs following Epsilon toxin exposure vary depending upon the route and result in three clinical forms: gastrointestinal, inhalational and systemic. These are described in Table 4 .27. Systemic dissemination may occur following either ingestion or inhalation of the toxin.\n\nSupportive therapy should be initiated as directed by the clinical condition of the patient. There is a low risk of person-to-person spread therefore standard precautions for infection control should apply. In the case of a suspected recent aerosolised release, PPE must be worn and appropriate decontamination carried out as described (pp. 74-78) .\n\nDiagnosis is usually on clinical grounds. Laboratory confirmation will require testing for the toxin in body fluids including blood, urine and respiratory secretions.\n\nTreatment for Epsilon toxin illness is supportive in all cases. Critical care management may be required for some cases of inhalational or systemic disease.\n\nNo precise human mortality figures are available for the inhalational or systemic forms of the disease. Gastrointestinal Epsilon toxin illness is rarely fatal, lasting no more than 3-4 days. No long-term complications are reported. \n\nStaphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) is produced by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The USA weaponised SEB during the Cold War and conducted successful field trials using a dry spraying system, which was capable of contaminating a large area of ground. SEB causes a severe inflammatory response similar to that seen in toxic shock syndrome. Although rarely fatal, it could potentially incapacitate up to 80% of exposed individuals and may overwhelm local health care resources.\n\nNatural source SEB often causes food poisoning due to the contamination of unrefrigerated meat and dairy products with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.\n\nSEB would be most likely to be developed into an aerosolised form for airborne release.\n\nNatural exposure to SEB usually occurs via ingestion. The toxin may also cause illness by inhalation. There is no person-to-person spread.\n\nInhalation usually results in symptoms within 3-12 hours. Ingestion leads to symptoms after 4-10 hours.\n\nSymptoms and signs following SEB exposure vary depending upon the route. The two main routes, inhalation and ingestion, are described in Table 4 .28.\n\nSupportive therapy should be initiated as directed by the clinical condition of the patient. There is no risk of person-to-person spread, therefore standard precautions for infection control should apply. In the case of a suspected recent aerosolised release, PPE must be worn and appropriate decontamination carried out as described (pp. 74-78) .\n\nDiagnosis relies mainly on the presence of typical signs and symptoms in a large number of people affected within a small period of time and associated with a rapid plateau in illness severity. Laboratory confirmation will require testing for the toxin in body fluids, including blood, urine and respiratory secretions.\n\nTreatment for SEB illness is supportive in all cases. Critical care management may be required for some cases of inhalational SEB.\n\nSEB is rarely fatal. Symptoms usually last no more than 1-2 weeks in most patients following inhalational exposure. Ingestional SEB is usually self-limiting, lasting no more than 24 hours. No long-term complications are reported. \n\nThe T-2 mycotoxin is one of the most deadly of the trichothecene group, consisting of over 40 different toxic compounds produced by fungi of the genera Stachybotrys and Fusarium. T-2 is believed to be at least 100 times more potent than either mustard gas (p. 295) or lewisite (p. 298). It has reportedly been used as a bioweapon by several nations, including the USA during the Vietnam War and the Soviets in Afghanistan, becoming known as 'yellow rain'. Historically, trichothecene toxins have been responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths from 'natural' exposure worldwide. The toxin acts by disrupting DNA function, affecting rapidly dividing cells such as epithelial cells.\n\nThe fungus responsible for producing the T-2 toxin is commonly found in grain. Farmers may become exposed via contact with contaminated hay and grain dust.\n\nThe toxin became known as 'yellow rain' due to its characteristic appearance as a yellow-coloured smoke or dust, which formed sticky droplets when sprayed. Due to its stable nature, deliberate release of T-2 toxin could utilise surface or aerial spraying of the toxin, or dispersal in bombs, mortars or rockets. It is odourless and tasteless. In a deliberate attack respiratory features are likely to predominate.\n\nExposure T-2 mycotoxin can be absorbed by ingestion or inhalation. However, it is unique in being the only potential biological weapon that can be absorbed dermally. Absorption occurs more slowly via skin than by ingestion or inhalation.\n\nSymptoms usually appear between minutes and hours from skin contact. Inhalation or ingestion will result in symptoms within minutes.\n\nThe initial symptoms of T-2 mycotoxin depend on the route of exposure and are described in Table 4 .29. Life-threatening features are more likely to occur secondary to exposure by inhalation, although systemic symptoms can result following any exposure of sufficient dosage. Systemic features begin with the development of generalised weakness, central nervous dysfunction and cardiovascular shock with subsequent organ failure often complicated by coagulation disorders.\n\nSupportive therapy should be initiated as directed by the clinical condition of the patient. There is no risk of person-to-person spread therefore standard precautions for infection control should apply. In the\n\ncase of a suspected recent aerosolised release, PPE must be worn and appropriate decontamination carried out as described (pp. 74-78) .\n\nThe presence of cutaneous features with an appropriate history may suggest the diagnosis. T-2 mycotoxin may be detected by specific tests, including gas chromatography, which require specialised laboratory services. T-2 mycotoxin antigens may be detected up to 28 days following exposure. Bone marrow suppression may lead to pancytopenia, which can be identified by full blood count.\n\nTreatment is supportive in all cases. Critical care management may be required for severe systemic cases. Cutaneous features can be managed similarly to superficial burns. Activated charcoal treatment may be advocated with the rapid recognition of toxin ingestion.\n\nThe toxin is very resistant to heat and UV light and may persist for several weeks in the environment.\n\nThere are limited data regarding mortality, which overall is reported to be around 35% for all forms of exposure. Full recovery may take several months, although no long-term complications are reported. Chronic exposure by ingestion of the toxin may result in a clinical syndrome referred to as alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA). Typical features include the gastrointestinal symptoms as listed followed by pancytopenia, epithelial lesions and haemorrhages followed by a slow recovery phase lasting several months. In simple terms, successful transmission of an organism has three main requirements:\n\n\u2022 an infectious individual \u2022 a susceptible individual \u2022 an effective contact between them. Transmission of an organism or biotoxin can occur by various mechanisms, including droplet spread, direct physical contact or airborne spread. Mode of exposure will vary independently of the mechanism of transmission. For example, exposure from droplet spread of a viral agent may be inhaled from the atmosphere directly, or occur by physical contact with surface contamination and later oral ingestion. In terms of public health risk, agents that are reliably transmitted by airborne spread are the most dangerous, and most difficult to protect against. Biological agents vary in their virulence and risk of transmission. Virulence refers to an organism's ability to cause disease and relies upon several factors:\n\n\u2022 the initial number of infecting organisms or unit of biotoxin \u2022 the method/route of exposure \u2022 the host's natural or artificial defence mechanisms \u2022 the intrinsic characteristics of the individual organism or biotoxin. A summarised comparison between biological agents in terms of their overall risk to public health is shown in Table 4 .30.\n\nA very basic assumption when considering any mathematical model of disease spread is that the population can be subdivided into a set of distinct classes: susceptible, infectious or recovered. This is referred to as the SIR model. To understand this model we can consider the following 'rules':\n\n\u2022 All individuals are born into the 'susceptible' class.\n\n\u2022 Susceptible individuals are able to catch the disease (thereby entering the 'infectious' class). \u2022 Infectious individuals spread the disease to the 'susceptible' class.\n\n\u2022 Infectious individuals remain in the 'infectious' class for a given period of time (varying according to the organism responsible). \u2022 Infectious individuals may then recover, thereby entering the 'recovered' class. \u2022 Individuals in the 'recovered' class may then be assumed to be immune for life (or at least against that particular strain of organism such as from an influenza epidemic). One of the main requirements for mathematical models of disease spread involves the estimation of the effective contact rate in a given population. This is the product of the total contact rate per unit time (effective or not) and the risk of transmission. However, there are limitations to this calculation as contact rates can vary widely between individuals and groups. It is also difficult to determine transmission risk accurately, as this requires the study of infection rates by deliberate exposure of unaffected individuals to the organism, which is clearly unethical. However, post-outbreak contact study may allow the transmission risk to be estimated by assessing the number of secondary infection cases in a known exposed population (the secondary attack rate). In order to do so, contact tracing must be thorough and effective to identify all potential contacts with the primary case. Secondary attack rates can also be useful in investigating the efficacy of a vaccination by comparison between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups for a specified organism. Several software models are available to facilitate this process, as well as much more complex epidemic simulations, such as Epigrass. There is a considerable community of software developers, many of whom use incredibly sophisticated programs to model disease spread and interventions, and measure subsequent population consequences. However, the modelling of irregular events, such as deliberate release, is very difficult and often unreliable.\n\nThe basic reproductive ratio, R 0 , is defined as the average number of secondary cases occurring in a susceptible population. When R 0 is greater than 1, the disease is capable of infecting susceptible individuals and the number of cases will therefore increase. Conversely, when R 0 is less than 1, the disease will always fail to spread. Estimation of the R 0 can help to quantify the risk of a given disease to the population. Comparative examples of R 0 values are shown in Table 4 .31.\n\nIn order to be an effective biological weapon, an organism (or biotoxin) must meet certain criteria. These are shown in Box 4.12. Fortunately no single agent possesses all these characteristics. However, those that fulfil many of the criteria make up the Category A ('Big Six') agents, as discussed earlier in this chapter.\n\nSeveral computer models are available to help predict disease spread in order to facilitate national, or even international, efforts to manage infectious outbreaks. These are also useful for generating scenarios for 'table-top' exercises in order to test and improve response plans. One such model, developed in the USA, the Large-Scale Agent Model (LSAM), is a major initiative of the National Center for the Study of Preparedness and Catastrophic Event Response (PACER) based at the Johns Hopkins University. The LSAM can be used to plan for several different types of incident, including natural epidemics, deliberate biological and chemical agent release as well as other disease trends such as childhood obesity. It may also be possible to integrate with travel and sociological data from other countries to improve prediction of disease spread and the emergency responses from around the globe. This system involves complex computer simulation of communities representing real populations. One of the main focuses is on surge capacity, enabling scenarios to challenge available medical facilities in the event of a significant incident.\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis is a treatment provided in advance of potential exposure to a specific, or suspected, threat organism. It may take the form of a vaccination schedule or regular medical therapy, such as an oral antibiotic dose. The aim of pre-exposure treatment is to target individuals identified as being at increased risk of exposure. This may include a regional or national population at risk of endemic diseases such as yellow fever, or a more specific population, for example military personnel prior to operational duty in an area of high risk of exposure to a deliberate bioweapon release.\n\nPost-exposure prophylaxis is the practice of providing treatment immediately after a suspected or confirmed biological agent release in order to attempt to limit the duration, severity, incidence and transmission of subsequent disease in asymptomatic individuals.\n\nVaccines may also be utilised for both pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis. The smallpox vaccine may be used to limit disease severity post-exposure. The anthrax vaccine is currently only provided to those at risk of exposure (veterinary staff, laboratory workers and military personnel) and to reduce the risk of disease after exposure to anthrax in some cases. Current recommendations for prescribing appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis following deliberate biological agent release incidents are shown in Table 4 .32. Updates can be found via the HPA website: www.hpa.org.uk\n\nThe decision to provide post-exposure prophylaxis will involve a thorough assessment of risk regarding the potential extent and type of exposure encountered.\n\nThose most likely to require post-exposure prophylaxis will include: \u2022 individuals exposed at the incident scene (including emergency personnel) \u2022 contacts of highly transmissible disease cases \u2022 victims of suspected smallpox and plague exposure \u2022 hospital medical staff and laboratory workers. Patient group directions (PGDs) are available for the prescribing of post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment for large numbers of people following the release of certain biological agents. Updates can be found at the DH website: www.dh.gov.uk\n\nKey elements of the hospital response to a biological release incident will include:\n\n\u2022 a high level of awareness for potential outbreaks \u2022 recognition of a biological release and the need for an initial response \u2022 provision of PPE and decontamination facilities \u2022 seeking advice early (e.g. local HPU, the HPA) \u2022 diagnosis and clinical management of affected patients \u2022 effective communication and information cascade \u2022 maintaining the chain of evidence \u2022 effective coordination and overall incident management. All of these elements should be incorporated into hospital major incident plans, although resources and procedure may vary between units.\n\nRecognition (Table 4 .33; Box 4.13) Biological release incidents may be recognised by emergency services working at the scene, or following warnings of a deliberate release. If a warning is received in advance the incident response plan can be activated, allowing for preparation of facilities for decontamination and treatment ahead of casualty arrival. However, due to the inevitable delay in developing symptoms, casualties will usually attend hospital services some time after the initial release occurred. In this event hospital emergency departments and inpatient medical teams will be those most likely to recognise the features of a biological release incident. The anthrax vaccine may also be used in combination with antibiotic therapy for selected high-risk cases. If the vaccine is given the duration of antibiotic therapy can be reduced from 60 to 28 days The local health protection unit (HPU) will ensure that all information and resources are provided in order to manage patients safely and to protect primary health care staff. There may be a delay in the early stages of an incident or outbreak before this becomes available.\n\nPrimary care services may be involved in the response to outbreaks or unusual incidents in several ways:\n\n\u2022 Direct management of illness cases \u2022 Direct management of exposed, but unaffected, individuals \u2022 Dealing with those requesting advice or chemoprophylaxis \u2022 Reassurance and advice for the 'worried well' \u2022 Administration of chemoprophylaxis under Health Protection Agency guidance Action to be taken after recognising cases of an unusual illness:\n\n\u2022 Safety of staff is first priority \u2022 Refer to local HPU for advice \u2022 Make a more detailed clinical assessment if safe to do so \u2022 Do not perform invasive investigations -these should be carried out in a hospital environment or other appropriate facility \u2022 Seek advice from the receiving hospitals before sending patients in case any special arrangements are required \u2022 The local HPU may advise on which hospitals are to be used in the case of specific biological incidents 4 Responding to Terrorism: A Medical Handbook\n\nAs soon it is suspected that a patient, or group of patients, has been exposed to a biological release, the safety and protection of hospital personnel and patients is paramount. All casualties and emergency service personnel arriving from the scene of a suspected biological release incident must be considered as contaminated even if they have been decontaminated at scene. Appropriate PPE/PRPS (personal respiratory protection system) must be worn by all personnel dealing with casualties suspected to be contaminated and decontamination measures must be carried out for all patients arriving from the suspected release area if this has not already been done. The Emergency Department should be cleared of non-incident patients using procedures developed for conventional major incidents. If casualties have already arrived in the department this may also include patients not involved in the incident but who have come into contact with contaminated casualties. Clinical areas may need to be divided into 'clean' and 'dirty' areas to ensure that unaffected patients do not become contaminated themselves. Decontamination should be carried out in specifically designated areas or outside the hospital in NHS decontamination units. The issue of whether or not to undertake decontamination of all individuals with a delayed presentation following a suspected biological release incident is more controversial. If the individual reports possible exposure at the site of a suspected, or confirmed, release, a risk assessment must be made as to whether there is any remaining contamination of body or clothing and decontamination measures carried out as appropriate. Contaminated clothing or other materials may also have been left at the individual's home or workplace.\n\nThe advice in Figure 4 .1 has been produced by the HPA to assist hospital clinicians in the initial management of suspected biological agent releases. \u2022 Details of advice provided and by whom \u2022 Actions taken to protect staff and patients \u2022 Who else has been informed\n\nDuring known release incidents, primary triage (triage sieve) will normally take place on arrival and outside the Emergency Department. Decontamination should be carried out in parallel with management of critically unwell casualties requiring advanced life support. Following decontamination, clinical management will need to be carried out according to standard principles of priority with protection of the airway, oxygen therapy and support of breathing, and control of haemorrhage as necessary along with concurrent use of specific drug therapies where indicated. If a biological release incident is suspected the local health protection unit (HPU) must be contacted urgently. They will be responsible for contacting the police and establishing command and control as well as seeking further expert advice regarding any potential pathogens that may be implicated (Box 4.14).\n\nAlthough patient welfare is the first priority, the personal safety of NHS staff dealing with suspected outbreaks is essential in order to minimise exposure and the risk of developing illness by instituting appropriate infection control measures immediately.\n\nClinicians must seek advice early from the usual hospital sources such as infectious disease specialists and microbiologists. Infection control teams must be informed and the local HPU involved. Further clinical responsibilities are summarised below:\n\nIndividual hospital major incident protocols should be followed. Overall, a clear procedure for the cascade of information up the clinical and hospital management chain will be required in order to ensure adequate resources are made available and extra support can be obtained to aid further management of potentially multiple infected individuals. Senior clinical staff must maintain a high degree of awareness of the arrival of unexplained or unexpected numbers of individuals presenting with similar symptoms or signs and to ensure that this information is passed on up the chain effectively. Senior staff should ensure that local emergency services and the local HPU have been informed. A nominated individual should be tasked with seeking expert advice from the HPA regarding the suspected organism involved, correct identification and microbiological testing as well as clinical management requirements.\n\nAn appropriate coordinator should be identified to collect details of casualties and ensure that the correct documentation is maintained. In normal circumstances the senior clinician on duty for the Emergency Department should be responsible for ensuring that all necessary PPE and decontamination resources are made available. Other hospital departments such as the general wards, intensive care or high dependency units will need to be informed so that they can prepare to receive patients. Infection control teams will need to be informed to ensure adequate numbers of isolation bed spaces are made available. Off-duty personnel may need to be called in and the responsibility for this will need to be given to a previously nominated individual. Figure 4 .2 illustrates a generic information cascade for the hospital response.\n\nIt is very likely that deliberate or accidental chemical release incidents will be followed by an investigation. It is therefore very important that clinical records are comprehensive, contemporary and legible. Information records can be useful to ensure documentation of all actions taken and advice given or received regarding the management of the incident. An example of this is shown in Figure 4 .3.\n\nIn cases of suspected intentional biological release it is vital that all patients' personal effects, such as clothing, and samples are kept appropriately packaged and documented to ensure that the chain of evidence is maintained. This is especially relevant where samples may pass between several different departments or laboratories. Every movement of a sample should be documented. The consultant in charge of the case is responsible for ensuring that this is maintained and for authorising release of samples to be transferred as necessary. Personal items of worth (mobile phones, keys, wallets, etc.) should be decontaminated where possible and returned to their owners; otherwise they should be separately bagged and labelled.\n\n\u2022 A separate form must be filled in every time samples change hands, starting from the doctor taking the samples. \u2022 All forms should be kept together and numbered in sequence. \u2022 Any break in the chain of evidence documentation may compromise the evidential value of the sample. \u2022 The consultant in charge of the case should authorise the transfer of samples to the laboratory. This may be verbal as samples should not be delayed, but the consultant must sign the form as soon as practically possible. \u2022 Laboratories will have their own local protocols for who is sufficiently senior to authorise sample handover, and these should be adhered to.\n\nFor unusual illnesses where the aetiology is uncertain, HPA guidance recommends that samples are taken for a blind screen with toxicological, microbiological and radiological investigations, as well as for routine haematology and biochemistry. Instructions for microbiological blind testing are shown in Table 4 .34. Samples must be taken as early as possible, and preferably before specific drug therapy has been administered. However, sampling should not delay the provision of life-saving treatment. Standard Do the cases seem unusual in type, severity or symptoms? \u2022 Specimen containers should be labelled with the patient's name, hospital number and the date and time, before the sample is taken \u2022 The primary container should be screwed tight and placed in a plastic bag \u2022 Every effort should be made to avoid external contamination of specimen containers during collection \u2022 A high risk label must be affixed to the specimen container \u2022 Each specimen must be packed individually, i.e. three specimens, three separate packages \u2022 The request form should record any other relevant information and include adequate clinical details, such as any antibiotic therapy \u2022 The request form must be labelled high risk (or danger of infection, according to local protocol) and be placed in a different bag to the specimen \u2022 Specimen bags and request form bags should be sealed and attached to each other using tape. Pins, staples and metal clips must not be used \u2022 Contact the laboratory in advance to inform them to expect specimens \u2022 Specimens should be transported to the hospital laboratory as rapidly as possible according to local protocols for high-risk specimens \u2022 Chain of evidence forms should be completed if necessary within each designated police authority area will establish in their emergency plans those arrangements appropriate for the coordination of the health response to biological incidents. Each PCT is contracted to a Regional Service Provider Unit (RSPU) to provide necessary expertise, advice and support.\n\nFor incidents that involve water contamination, the initial management is the responsibility of the water companies and the Environment Agency (EA). Water companies have a legal duty to notify health and local authorities if an incident may lead to a significant health risk to the local population. The EA would take action to respond to the ecological effects of any water contaminant.\n\nOther organisations that may take on specific roles and responsibilities during biological incidents include:\n\n\u2022 The HPA Centre for Infections (CfI): provides infectious disease surveillance, specialist and reference microbiology and microbial epidemiology information. The CfI also coordinates the investigation of national and uncommon outbreaks and helps advise the government on the risks posed by various infections as well as how to respond to international health alerts. \u2022 The Ministry of Defence (MoD): principally involved with counterterrorism, civil contingencies and for providing CBRN expertise via the Defence Science and Technology Laboratories (Dstl) at Porton Down.\n\nThe unidentified biological agent\n\nSeveral technologies that could offer rapid, portable and automated analysis and diagnosis of known biological agents are currently in development. In the future these may be widely available in order to perform 'on-the-spot' identification of suspicious materials at the site of release. Apparatus will incorporate available immunoassay techniques aimed at detecting specific antigens, such as ELISA, into a simple-to-use, handheld device. Analysis of agents could potentially be as rapid as 20 minutes. This would offer significant advantages not only in identifying 'harmless' materials in the event of negative testing, but also in enabling rapid control of spread with effective infection control measures and early post-exposure prophylaxis. The HPA has produced a document providing advice for the diagnosis and investigation of unidentified biological agents, Protocol for undiagnosed serious illness: a microbiological approach to investigation, available from their website.\n\nAlthough terrorist or criminal incidents of this nature are extremely rare, members of the public and businesses should remain alert to the danger of intentional postal attacks and be aware of how to If individuals believe that they have been exposed to a biological material from a suspicious package they should be informed to:\n\n\u2022 notify police immediately using the 999 system \u2022 not touch their eyes, nose or any other part of their body \u2022 wash their hands in ordinary soapy water where facilities are provided \u2022 remain calm and follow the instructions of the emergency services. All exposed persons should be kept separate from others and remain available for medical attention. Unexposed persons should be assembled at a safe distance from the incident. They should not leave the area and should continue to be guided by the police and the other emergency services.\n\nLocal risk assessment may suggest that the use of PPE is appropriate in order to control the risk of biological agent exposure. Masks and skin protection may be considered and must be suitable for the task being carried out and provide a sufficient level of protection.\n\nThe Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992: Guidance on the Regulations provides practical advice on how to comply with health and safety law related to PPE and on the selection of PPE. Visit the HSE website, www.hse.gov.uk, for further information.\n\nThe HPA has produced advisory guidelines and an algorithm ( Fig. 4 .6) for dealing with suspect packages and this is available from the website."}
