{"title": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and boarder protection: A report of the Sydney airport experience", "body": "The increased surveillance was to include a medical presence at international airports to conduct SARS screenings of all arriving international passengers.\n\nThe staff who made up the airport screening team was sourced from the current nursing staff levels from within South East Sydney Area Heath Service (SESAHS). In order to setup the screening service, the infection control practitioners (ICPs) from POW were required for the first weekend of screening while the additional staff were from the POWs Australian Infection Control emergency department (EO) and infectious diseases (ID) ward. However, after this initial weekend, the staff that undertook the role were those staff wishing to gain overtime and therefore no experience in respiratory or infectious diseases was required. The range of nurses that worked at the airport during this time was vast, including ICPs, operating theatre, emergency, midwives, mental health, intensive care, orthopaedic and general surgical and medical ward staff.\n\nTherefore education of the staff became paramount.\n\nA SARS screening nurse working at the airport was often in a totally different role to that of their usual job. For example, critical care nurses who were used to caring for critically ill patients and having access to all the latest equipment to monitor a patient, were finding themselves assessing an acutely unwell passenger with only a thermometer and their own skills of assessment.\n\nThe screening nurses were to work in conjunction with AQIS and customs and cover the airport from Sam to lIpm each day. There were three nurses on the morning shift (Sam to Ipm) and two on an afternoon to evening shift (lpm to \n\nSydney's Mascot International Airport is Australia's busiest international airport 3 \u2022 Each year the airport handles over 8.4 million international passengers, which equates to over 23,000 passengers daily. The airport handles a total of 45,795\n\naircraft movements annually with a total of 34 aircraft gates and two customs halls to process these numbers 3.\n\nThe environmental structure at Sydney airport was not designed to cope with infectious diseases. The airport has one room in each customs hall set aside which they call the 'yellow fever room'. These rooms are mainly used for interviewing passengers who have returned to Sydney unvaccinated from an area where yellow fever is endemic.\n\nOne yellow fever room was ideally located off one of the customs hall and had easy access. This room also had a hand Also, the second room did not have a hand basin so, wherever possible, this room was not utilised; instead a custom's interviewing room was used, providing the room was not engaged in customs activities. The location of this room was ideal for that customs hall.\n\nThe design and location of the public toilets was also a major area of concern as one toilet could not be isolated for use by any potential SARS passengers and bedpans and urinals were certainly out of the question. Eventually a disabled toilet was identified as one that could possibly be isolated but it was not centrally located which meant that a passenger had to travel a distance and past many others people to access it. It was also hoped that a disabled person did not require use of the facility when it was quarantined.\n\nThe following are actual cases seen by the authors during their time at Sydney airport.\n\nA banker on a domestic flight to the Gold Coast via Sydney presented with a slight fever, was perspiring and had a cough.\n\nHe had recently returned to Australia following a month working in China. He had disembarked his international flight in Melbourne and was cleared by AQIS there. As he had become progressively sicker, and it was 17 hours since he left\n\nBeijing, consideration needed to be given as to whether this was the early onset of SARS; therefore the screening team were called to the domestic terminal to review him.\n\nThe domestic terminal staff were not used to the screening process and they were certainly fearful. An infectious disease physician was contacted and decided that the passenger may continue his travel to the Gold Coast and be followed up by the infectious disease doctors there. He left on the next flight isolated at the back of the plane, but he was delighted with this because he was able to lie down in all the empty seats.\n\nNewGen and Achieve are revolutionary instrument processing detergents developed to efficiently clean instruments, containers and articles, in a range of mechanical washers.\n\nNewGen and Achieve may be used to clean the following instruments: \n\nThe airport land crew requested an assessment of an elderly lady in a flight lounge area who had been observed coughing.\n\nThe lady was from Sydney and was travelling to the UK. She hadn't even left the country yet! Staff at the airport, including the AQIS staff, were highly anxious and were reporting anyone in the airport who coughed or sneezed!\n\nA passenger was returning from Bali following a holiday with All passengers reviewed displayed no SARS symptoms, nor had they travel or contact histories. They had simply coughed a few times, or were feeling hot during the flight, or were suffering from travel sickness, or had used the bathroom frequently due to a recent gastrointestinal illness for which they were on treatment.\n\nDuring this time a wave of panic swept through the remaining passengers, they assumed that SARS was on board; this was not helped by the fact that a masked and yellow-gowned figure was wandering around the plane.\n\nMany of the passengers demanded to leave the plane immediately, not realising that after they had just spent 23 hours with these people, 10 more minutes would not change their predicament. This tense situation was not resolved until the captain and the AQIS officer spoke with the passengers.\n\nOver a period of 5 months beginning 1 April 2003, more than 700 international passengers were interviewed and screened by the nurses at Sydney International Airport. Of the 700+ screened, only two were sent to hospital and neither were probable cases. While Australia was lucky that SARS did not create the problem that it did in other countries, the entry point for a virus of this kind will almost certainly be an international airport.\n\nThe nurses who worked at the airport did so in difficult circumstances with very limited resources, in a crowed and unfamiliar environment, with language and culture barriers and limited clinical back-up. Confidentiality was always a concern, with the stigma and fear that SARS had. Passengers and airport staff were all extremely anxious and the mere act of coughing to clear your throat sent chills through all those around. The airport nursing staff were able to lead by example and diffuse many sensitive situations.\n\nThe authors of this report were proud to take part in preventing the entry of a potentially devastating infectious disease into Australia. The only disappointment we had with our experience was that we were unable to purchase any duty free items.\n\nFor security reasons places or names of any staff member within the Sydney Airport International Terminal cannot be given or explained in detail."}
