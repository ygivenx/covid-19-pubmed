{"title": "Title: ACP risk grade: a simple mortality index for patients with confirmed or suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) during the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan", "body": "Background: Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, healthcare systems capacities in highly endemic areas have been overwhelmed. Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients.\n\nIn this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports.\n\nResults: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR] , 39 -66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8.4 days (IQR, 5.8 -12.0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8.7% (95% CI, 5.9% to 11.5%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age \u2265 60 years and CRP \u2265 34 mg/L) was 33.2% (95% CI, 19.8% to 44.3%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age \u2265 60 years and CRP < 34 mg/L; age < 60 years and CRP \u2265 34 mg/L; 5.6% [95% CI, 0 to 11.3%]) and grade one (age < 60 years and CRP < 34 mg/L, 0%) (P <0.001), respectively.\n\n.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] As of February 19, 2020, 74 576 confirmed cases with 2118 deaths were reported in China. 6 Based on the reported clinical characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the overall mortality ranges from 2% to 5%, which can be even higher in the elders with severe complications. 1, 7, 8 The Chinese government responded immediately and mobilized the whole country's health resources to deal with this public health emergency. However, according to the data released at February 19, 2020, the number of confirmed cases in the city of Wuhan accounts for nearly two-thirds of the entire country while the number of deaths accounts for three-quarters of the whole country, and the mortality reached a peak of over 7% at the early stage. Wuhan city, as the epidemic area, is bearing enormous public health as well as medical burdens, and the epidemic condition of the city will robustly impact on the trends of COVID-19 epidemics nation-wide as well as worldwide. Thus, an efficient and timely triage of COVID-19 patients with high mortality risk is crucial for relieving the public health burden.\n\nHighly notably, the current confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is entirely based on the viral real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result. At the 17th COVID-19\n\nPrevention and Control Work Conference by the Hubei Government, it is reported that the overall positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 assay was only 30 -40% in Wuhan among all the detected specimens from highly clinical suspected patients. This low detection rate, presumably due to a high rate of false negativity, of the current assay might lead to delay in diagnosing new COVID-19 patients as well as early discharge of infected patients who still carry the virus and thus remain as the potential infection .

Our current study was conducted aiming to characterize the clinical features of either confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital in Wuhan, and to develop a mortality risk index, as an evaluation tool used for establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system in highly endemic areas.\n\nWe performed a retrospective, one-centre study on patients hospitalized from January 21 to February 5, 2020, at Wuhan Hankou Hospital in Wuhan, China. Wuhan Hankou Hospital was one of the first designated by the Wuhan government to be responsible for admitting patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 from Wuhan in January 21, 2020. The hospital was staffed with a team of physicians from Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, starting from January 24, 2020. All patients enrolled in this study were residences in Wuhan and treated according to the Chinese Guidance for COVID-19. 9\n\nAll data were provided by Hankou Hospital. The data collected include demographic characteristics, comorbidities, clinical signs, and symptoms, laboratory testing results, chest computed tomography (CT) scan images and clinical outcomes from the hospital information system, nursing records, and laboratory reports.\n\n.

Qualitative and quantitative differences between subgroups were analysed using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical parameters and the student t or Mann-Whitney's tests for continuous parameters, as appropriate. The cumulative mortality was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with the log-rank test used for comparisons.

The days from illness onset to admission were six days (IQR, 4 -9). At admission, the most common abnormal laboratory test results were elevated C-reactive Among 438 patients with evaluable disease severity, 338 and 100 patients were diagnosed as mild and severe pneumonia, respectively. The cumulative mortality was significantly higher among patients with severe pneumonia than those with mild pneumonia (37.8% vs. 4.1%, P <0.001) (Figure 1 ). On admission, the patients with severe pneumonia, in comparison with the patients with mild pneumonia, CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .\n\n1 0 (20.8% vs. 13.7%, P =0.20); however, the difference is not statistically significant.

To our knowledge, this is the first-ever study to compare the clinical characteristics of pneumonia patients who were either positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR assay, and to develop a first-ever COVID-19 mortality risk index derived from patients in highly endemic areas during early stage of outbreak.\n\nIn this large-sample size cohort, the percentage of pneumonia patients with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 result was around 40%, which was consistent with the report of Wuhan government. We found that almost all the characteristics including clinical presentations, laboratory testing results, as .

With the increasing number of confirmed cases and deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection, the city of Wuhan is facing a big challenge with the overwhelmed medical capacity to provide essential medical . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. The ACP index was consisted of two components -patient's age and CRP tested at admission.\n\nPresumably, age should be more likely to correlate with underlying medical conditions and comorbidities. In our cohort, an age of more than 60 years old indicates higher mortality in COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with previous studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle\n\nEast respiratory syndrome (MERS) related pneumonia. 11, 12 Moreover, CRP, an indicator of inflammatory response, has been described as a predictor of disease progression in MERS, 13 influenza-infected 14 and community acquire pneumonia patients. 15 In the current study, a CRP levels higher than 34 mg/L in the early course of COVID-19 is associated with increased mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may reflect an intense inflammatory response or/and an underlying secondary infection.\n\nManagement decision for high risk patients with COVID-19 must be made quickly, which often based upon scanty evidence. Under this pressing circumstance, the quality of evidence becomes especially crucial. The ACP index, with a high level of differentiating power, can be regarded as such quality evidence in providing an efficient, feasible and accessible approach to establish a hierarchical management system of COVID-19 in the SARS-CoV-2 highly endemic areas where medical resources are extremely limited. To be specific, it is suggested, by applying the ACP index, that patients classified in the grade one (low-risk) group, accounting for about 44.7% of the studied population, should be .

For patients in the grade two (medium-risk) group, which has the 12-day mortality of approximately 6%, they should be treated in the general wards, whereas the patients in the grade three group should be transferred to intensive care unit for more comprehensive treatment due to as high as 33% mortality within 12 days from admission ( Figure 3 ). It is projected that this approach would benefit a considerable number of patients with COVID-19 by directing the medical resources appropriate for the severity of the disease, and thus reduce the mortality and save the socioeconomic resources.\n\nWe also comprehensively describe the characteristics of severe (vs. mild) and death patients in our cohort. We noticed that severe patients had high frequencies of decreased lymphocytes, higher D-dimer, and lower albumin, suggesting that severe patients may had higher probability of immune deficiency, coagulation activation, and disease exhaustion condition. In addition, we also noticed abnormal ALT and creatinine levels in most patients who died, but most of the abnormalities were mild, suggesting that COVID-19 patients may die primarily from respiratory failure caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, rather than multiple organ failure.\n\nThe high mortality rates in our study may be due to differences in the population composition. Patients in three first designated hospitals are reasonable to have much progressed disease and higher mortality than the national-wide population, as reported by Huang et al and Chen et al. 1, 8 Notably, Hankou\n\nHospital is the nearest medical center from the Huanan wholesale seafood market, which is reported as the first place of cluster onset. Most patients in Hankou Hospital are residents nearby and are believed to be the earliest infected population who may have close contact with live animals or the first generation of confirmed cases. In addition, Wuhan, as the endemic area, includes a considerable .

These age composition differences also contribute to the prognosis quite significantly. On the other hand, suboptimal functioning of the medical care system was highly overwhelmed as too many infected subjects were presented in a very short period. Meanwhile, many patients with mild illness were home isolated in January, which lead to the reality that the current reported mortality level more precisely reflects the death risk of the severe cases.\n\nDespite the significant findings in this report, the current study has several limitations. Firstly, some cases had incomplete documentation of the symptoms and laboratory testing given the extremely heavy work of the medical staff. Secondly, the ACP index has not been externally validated yet in an independent prospective cohort. To this end, a new prospective study is under the way to further investigate its value in triaging the COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, the patients enrolled in this study were from a tertiary-care hospital and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and severe diseases.\n\nIt is estimated that more patients would belong to the grade one category in the primary care setting.\n\nIn conclusion, the ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas.\n\n.
