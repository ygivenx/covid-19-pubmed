{"title": "Inhibition of arterivirus RNA synthesis by cyclophilin inhibitors is 3 counteracted by mutations in replicase transmembrane subunits 4 5", "body": "However, other coronaviruses seem to be much less affected by depletion of CypA in the infected cell 110 (de Wilde et Our present study aimed to investigate the molecular details of the inhibition of arterivirus 114 replication by cyclophilin inhibitors. To this end, we first passaged EAV in the presence of inhibitory 115\n\nCsA concentrations, to induce resistance to the compound. Subsequently, adaptive mutations that 116 markedly decreased the sensitivity of EAV replication to CsA treatment were found to map to nsp5, 117 one of the transmembrane subunits of the arterivirus replicase. We could show that CsA treatment 118 interferes with EAV RNA synthesis, and that the CsA-resistance mutations in nsp5 render replication, 119 and in particular RNA synthesis, less sensitive to CsA treatment. Furthermore, we show that resistance 120 to the closely related Cyp inhibitor ALV requires an additional adaptive mutation in nsp2, a second 121 transmembrane subunit of the arterivirus replicase that is essential for both polyprotein processing and 122 RO formation. Our studies implicate both nsp2 and nsp5 in the mechanism underlying the sensitivity 123 of arterivirus replication to cyclophilin inhibitor treatment. Moreover, they suggest that the role of 124 cyclophilins as arterivirus host factors is specifically linked to viral RNA synthesis, possibly through 125 interactions with key players in RO formation. Membrane-associated EAV RTCs were isolated from BHK-21 cells and in vitro RNA synthesis assays 200 (IVRAs) were performed essentially as described previously (van Hemert et al., 2008) . In short, 201 approximately 5 \u00d7 10 7 EAV-infected BHK-21 cells (MOI 5) were harvested at 7.5 h p.i. and lysed 202 using a ball-bearing homogenizer (Isobiotek) with 16 \u00b5m clearance. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 203 min at 1000 x g to obtain a post nuclear supernatant (PNS). A standard IVRA contained PNS (the 204 equivalent of 6 x 10 4 infected cells) and a 5x concentrated CsA stock (final concentration 4 to 32 \u00b5M) 205 or RTC dilution buffer (control) and was performed in the presence of [\u03b1-32 P]CTP that was 206 incorporated in the newly synthesized EAV RNA. Assays were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 100 min and 207 terminated by the addition of 60 \u00b5l of 5% LiDS-LET-ProtK. After a 15-min incubation at 42\u00b0C, the 208 All rights reserved.

Agarose 209 gels were dried and reaction products were visualized by phophorimaging using a 2013a). We now aimed to investigate the mechanism-of-action by which arterivirus infection is 232 inhibited in the presence of this cyclophilin inhibitor. To this end, wt EAV (strain Bucyrus; MOI 233 0.005) was serially passaged in Huh7 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of CsA (4 to 234 20 \u00b5M). Three independent virus lineages were generated (named EAV CsA-1 to -3), which exhibited 235 clearly decreasing sensitivity to CsA ( Fig. 2A) . By passage 7 (P7), all three lineages replicated in the 236 presence of 20 \u00b5M CsA (data not shown), a dose that is approximately 10-fold higher than the EC50 237 value observed when using wtEAV ( passages in the absence of CsA did not alter the drug sensitivity of the wtEAV control (EC50 2.1 \u00b5M), 247 P7 virus of the CsA-treated EAV lineages CsA-1 to -3 had become five-fold less sensitive to the 248 compound ( Fig. 2B and Table 1 ). Of note, additional passaging (up to passage 9) did not decrease CsA 249 sensitivity any further. 250\n\nNext, we confirmed the reduced CsA sensitivity of CsA-1 to -3 P7 virus by infecting (MOI 251 0.01) Huh7 or BHK-21 cells in the presence of 4 \u00b5M CsA, a dose that fully inhibits wtEAV 252 replication. Virus production was measured at 48 h p.i., which confirmed that wtEAV-P7 infection in 253 the presence of 4 \u00b5M CsA indeed did not yield detectable virus progeny (Fig. 2C ).

Similar results were obtained in BHK-21 cells, albeit that the yields of all three lineages were 257 equally reduced compared to wtEAV-P7 in this cell line (data not shown). 258 259 Most CsA resistance-associated mutations map to EAV nsp5. In order to identify CsA resistance-260 associated mutations, the consensus genome sequence of the three P7 CsA-resistant EAV samples was 261 determined following RT-PCR amplification (Table 2 and Fig. 1A ). The EAV CsA-1 consensus 262 sequence contained three mutations, all mapping to the nsp5-coding region of ORF1a and resulting in 263 three amino acids substitutions: Q21R (mixed with the wt sequence), Y113H, and A134V. 264\n\nRemarkably, the Y113H mutation in nsp5 was also encoded by the ORF1a consensus sequence of the 265 EAV CsA-2 population, but now accompanied by a mutation in the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) 266\n\n(A43G) and one in ORF1b, specifying a mutation in the nsp10 helicase domain (Y387H). Lineage 267\n\nCsA-3 contained mutations leading to substitutions in nsp2 (A199T) and again nsp5 (L8S and Q21R). 268\n\nNone of the consensus sequences contained any synonymous mutations that had been fixed during 269 passaging. Likewise, no mutations were discovered in the consensus sequence of the wtEAV-P7 270 control, implying that the mutations identified in the CsA-1 to -3 P7 viruses potentially are linked to 271 the established reduced sensitivity to CsA. 272\n\nTo assess the importance of the identified mutations for CsA sensitivity, each mutation was 273 individually reverse engineered into the EAV genome, using full-length cDNA clone pEAN900. 274\n\nRecombinant mutant viruses were launched and their CsA sensitivity was assayed in Huh7 cells using 275 the CPE-based assay outlined above (see Fig. 1b ). Interestingly, three of the nsp5 mutations (Q21R, 276 Y113H, and A134V) decreased the CsA sensitivity of EAV replication (EC50 values of ~4.4 \u00b5M vs. 277 1.6 \u00b5M for the wt control (rEAV wt )). No change in sensitivity was observed for any of the other 278 mutations (see Table 1 and sFig. 1A-H). Of note, the nsp5 L8S mutation reverted back to the wild-type 279 residue (data not shown), which likely explains the marginal decrease in CsA sensitivity observed in 280 this assay (sFig. 1C). 281 All rights reserved.

Therefore, we also engineered mutant 284 viruses with genome sequences identical to the consensus sequence of these three CsA-resistant virus 285 lineages. For lineage CsA-1, which contained a mix of Q (wt) and R (mutant) at residue 21 of nsp5, 286\n\nboth variants were engineered and tested. Compared to the viruses carrying singular mutations, mutant 287 rEAV nsp5 Y113H+A134V displayed a decreased sensitivity to CsA, which now approached that of the 288 EAV CsA-1 lineage ( Fig. 3A and Table 1 ). When the Q21R mutation was added, the CsA resistance 289 diminished slightly compared to the Y113H+A134V double mutant ( Fig. 3B and Table 1 ; EC50 of 9.1 290 vs. 7.2 \u00b5M). However, upon passaging and resequencing (data not shown), the double mutant 291 appeared to be genetically instable, which may also explain the mixed sequence found at nsp5 codon 292 21 in the lineage CsA-1 consensus sequence. For lineage CsA-2, combining the three mutations (in 5'-293 UTR, nsp5, and nsp10) into the same genome did not further improve CsA resistance compared to 294 rEAV nsp5 Y113H (Fig. 3C) . This lack of a synergistic effect indicates that the mutations in 5'-UTR and 295 nsp10 do not contribute substantially to the level of CsA resistance of CsA-2. In the case of EAV 296\n\nCsA-3, combining nsp5 L8S , but not nsp2 A199T , with nsp5 Q21R yielded a ~2-fold further decrease in CsA 297 sensitivity (EC50 value of 9.1 \u00b5M; compare sFigs. 1B, E and Fig. 3D and see Table 1 ) suggesting that 298 the nsp2 A199T mutation does not contribute to CsA resistance. 299\n\nOverall, the above results clearly implicated various EAV nsp5 mutations in reduced CsA sensitivity. 300\n\nWhereas combining nsp5 mutations increased CsA resistance compared to singular nsp5 mutants, the 301 substitutions in 5'-UTR, nsp2, and nsp10 did not contribute detectably to CsA resistance. CsA-1 302 mutant rEAV nsp5 Q21R+Y113H+A134V was selected for follow-up experiments, as it was genetically stable 303 upon passaging (data not shown) and included the single nsp5 mutation (Y113H) that was key to the 304 CsA resistance of lineage CsA-2. For simplicity, this mutant will be referred to as rEAV QYA from this 305 point forward. 306 307 All rights reserved.

The CsA resistance of rEAV QYA was analyzed in more 308 detail by infecting Huh7 cells in the presence or absence of 4 \u00b5M CsA. Upon high-MOI inoculation 309 (MOI 3), the replication kinetics of rEAV wt and rEAV QYA in the absence of CsA were very similar 310 ( Fig. 4A ; solid lines). Progeny was released from rEAV wt -and rEAV QYA -infected cells from 12 h p.i. 311 onwards, with rEAV QYA titers being only slightly reduced compared to those for rEAV wt . In the 312 presence of 4 \u00b5M CsA, rEAV wt was essentially unable to replicate ( 5C) did not reveal obvious differences in DMV amounts, size, or ultrastructure. As replication of 329 rEAV QYA in the presence of CsA was delayed compared to the replication in untreated cells, we 330 analyzed cells infected with this mutant at 14 h p.i (Fig. 4) . In the presence of CsA, no DMVs were 331 observed for rEAV wt (Fig. 5E ), while the morphology and size of the DMVs in rEAV QYA -infected cells 332\n\nwere similar to the structures observed upon infection of untreated cells infected with rEAV wt -or 333 rEAV QYA (Fig. 5F ).

Taken together, these observations strongly 336 suggest that CsA treatment interferes with a very early stage of arterivirus infection, i.e. prior to or 337 during RO formation. Apparently, adaptive mutations in nsp5 can compensate for the detrimental 338 effects of CsA treatment, which may either target one of the viral players directly or affect a host 339 factor involved in arterivirus replication, like cyclophilin A (see above). For this purpose, BHK-21 cells were infected with rEAV wt or rEAV QYA and viral RNA synthesis was 355 assayed by metabolic labelling with [ 3 H]uridine from 6.5 to 7.5 h p.i. (Fig. 7A, B ). Cells were also 356 treated with dactinomycin to block cellular transcription. [ 3 H]-uridine incorporation into viral RNA 357 was quantified by isolation of intracellular RNA and liquid scintillation counting (Fig. 7A ). Labeled 358 viral RNA was also visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and fluorography (Fig. 7B ). This 359 revealed that RNA synthesis by the mutant virus was approximately 40% of wt virus activity, which is 360 in line with the observed delayed growth kinetics and reduced titers of the mutant.

ALV lacks the immunosuppressive 390 properties of CsA, while retaining a high affinity for cyclophilins. We now established that ALV is 391 able to block also the replication of wtEAV with an EC50 value of 4.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5M, an efficiency that is 392 comparable to that observed for CsA (Table 3) . 393\n\nTo explore the development of ALV resistance in EAV, two independent passaging 394 experiments in Huh7 cells were performed (EAV ALV-1 and ALV-2) in the presence of increasing 395 ALV concentrations (from 4 \u00b5M in passage 1 to 75 \u00b5M in passage 10), similar to the approach used to 396 generate CsA-resistant viruses (Fig. 2) . By passage 10, a CPE-based assay revealed that, compared to 397 the wtEAV-P10, the sensitivity to ALV was reduced by 7.4-and 2.8-fold for EAV lineages ALV-1 398 and ALV-2, respectively ( Fig. 8A and Table 3 ). Interestingly, the P10 samples of EAV lineages ALV-399 1 and -2 were ~4-fold less sensitive to CsA as well (Fig. 8B) . Analysis of the ALV-1 and -2 P10 400 consensus sequences revealed that each population contained multiple mutations (Table 2) . These 401 included singular mutations in the 5'-UTR, in ORF1a (nsp1 region), and in the structural protein-402 coding region. Strikingly, the P10 viruses from both lineages also carried two substitutions in nsp5. 403\n\nThe two nsp5 mutations in ALV-1 (Y113H and A134V) had previously been identified in lineage 404\n\nCsA-1 (see above), whereas ALV-2 also contained a mutation present in CsA-1, Q21R. Strikingly, 405 both ALV-resistant lineages contained the same mutation (H114R) within the papainlike protease 406 (PLP2) domain of nsp2. We reverse engineered the ALV-1 and -2 mutations into the viral genome, 407 and assayed ALV sensitivity of the mutant viruses. Singular nsp2 and nsp5 mutants displayed a 408 reduced ALV sensitivity, but only the nsp5 mutants were also less sensitive to CsA (Fig. 9 , Table 3) . 409\n\nSubsequently, combining nsp5 and nsp2 mutations had a synergistic effect and confirmed the 410 importance of the common nsp2 H114R substitution for ALV resistance. Mutations in the 5'UTR and 411 nsp1 did not further reduce the sensitivity to ALV (data not shown), nor did the mutations in the 412 structural protein-coding region contribute to ALV resistance ( Fig. 9 ; Table 3 ). 413\n\nFinally, to further corroborate the importance of nsp2 H114R for ALV resistance, this mutation 414 was transferred to the rEAV QYA triple mutant already carrying the nsp5 mutations identified in our 415 All rights reserved.

As anticipated, while the triple mutant was marginally 416 resistant to ALV (most likely due to the presence of the nsp5 A134V mutation, see Fig. 9A ), the addition 417 of nsp2 H114R rendered the rEAV QYA virus nearly insensitive to ALV treatment, while also retaining its 418 reduced CsA sensitivity (Fig. 10) . These results clearly confirmed that the highest level of ALV 419 resistance is achieved by introducing a combination of adaptive mutations in EAV nsp2 and nsp5. 420 421 422 423 All rights reserved.

Independently, experiments using the CsA 426 analog ALV pointed in the same direction, in addition to implicating nsp2 in ALV sensitivity and 427 resistance. Substitutions in nsp5 and nsp2 enable EAV to tolerate CsA or ALV concentrations that 428 would normally block virus replication (Figs. 2, 9 and 10 ). The largest EC50 increase, about 5-fold, 429 was achieved when multiple substitutions in nsp5 (and nsp2, in the case of ALV) were combined 430 (Table 1 and Four substitutions in nsp5 were implicated in CsA resistance (L8S, Q21R, Y113H, and 465 A134V), of which only the L8 residue is conserved among arteriviruses (Fig. 1C) . Interestingly, this 466 residue is also part of a potential CypA binding motif (GPxL, as identified by (Piotukh et al., 2005) ), 467 constituting a potential interaction site between the two proteins. However, during infection, this L8S 468 mutation quickly reverted, and therefore the contribution of the L8S substitution to CsA resistance 469 remains unclear. All other three nsp5 mutations (Q21R, Y113H, and A134V) are present in predicted 470 transmembrane domains (Fig. 1B) , and therefore may not be directly involved in interactions of nsp5 471 with Cyps or other proteins. There is no experimental data available on the membrane topology of 472 nsp5, but upon in silico modeling these nsp5 mutations did not appreciably alter the predicted 473 conformation of the various transmembrane domains (data not shown). In addition, our EM analysis of 474 DMV formation upon rEAV nsp5 QYA infection did not reveal any ultrastructural differences, either in 475 the absence or presence of CsA (Fig 5) .

One possible mechanism is that the adaptive nsp5 503 mutations somehow increase the stability of RTC complexes and thereby counteract the destabilization 504 that may result from CsA penetrating lipid membranes. It has been shown that CsA can be inserted 505 into and destabilize membrane structures, with a preference for sphingomyelin-rich membranes 506 Interestingly, despite the fact that CsA and ALV both are cyclophilin inhibitors, EAV 516 resistance to ALV requires an additional mutation in the nsp2 protease domain PLP2: H114R (Fig 10) . 517\n\nThis suggests that, compared to CsA, ALV has an additional target that is relevant for EAV 518 replication, either directly or indirectly. Residue H114 is positioned in helix \u03b14 in domain I of the 519 PLP2 structure, which is distant from both the protease's active site and the surface involved in 520 ubiquitin binding (van Kasteren et al., 2013), a feature linked to PLP2's secondary function as a 521 deubiquitinase involved in arteriviral innate immune evasion. Unfortunately, only the structure of the 522 PLP2 domain of nsp2 has been resolved, and the overall fold and membrane topology of the subunit of 523 EAV remains unclear. Our study implicates nsp5 in viral RNA synthesis, either directly or indirectly, 524 and provides evidence that mutations in nsp5 are involved in reduced sensitivity to CsA, while the 525 same mutations in combination with the nsp2 H114R substitution contribute to ALV resistance. Future 526 studies should aim to elucidate the difference between the modes of action of ALV and CsA and the 527 exact role of nsp5 and nsp2 in arterivirus sensitivity and resistance to Cyp inhibitors. 528 All rights reserved.
