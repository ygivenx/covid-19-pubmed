{"title": "Meditation or Exercise for Preventing Acute Respiratory Infection: A Randomized Controlled Trial Confl icts of interest: Bruce Barrett was previously supported by career development grants from the National Center for Complementary and Alter- native Medicine (K23 AT00051) and from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, both of which were essential for developing the methodology and infrastructure for recruiting and monitoring research subjects, and for assessing their acute respiratory infections. CORRESPONDING AUTHOR", "body": "A cute respiratory infection (ARI) is extremely common, often debilitating, and among the most costly of human illnesses. Infl uenza, the most serious of the viral ARIs, is associated with approximately 36,000 deaths and more than 500,000 hospitalizations in the United States yearly. 1 Nevertheless, symptoms of infl uenza infection are usually indistinguishable from those produced by other viruses. 2, 3 In the United States each year, noninfl uenza ARI accounts for more than 20 million doctor visits and 40 million lost school and work days, with an economic impact of more than $40 billion, making noninfl uenza ARI rank fi rst in the top 10 most expensive illnesses. 4 Reducing this burden even modestly could lead to substantial economic and quality-of-life benefi ts.\n\nAvailable treatments are not very effective. If started early enough, antiviral medications have limited effi cacy for infl uenza, 5 but not for other viral ARIs. Symptomatic treatments may reduce severity slightly but have never been shown to reduce illness duration or overall severity. Infl uenza vaccination is accepted as effective for prevention, 6 but it is imperfect, with seroprotection rates ranging from 60% to 80% in healthy younger adults and 40% to 60% in the elderly. 7 For noninfl uenza ARI, immunization strategies are impractical, and preventive strategies are limited to not smoking, 8 hand washing, 9 and avoiding sick contacts.\n\nThere is some evidence that enhancing general physical and mental health may reduce ARI burden. In a series of observational and viral inoculation studies, perceived stress, 10 negative emotion, 11 and lack of social support 12 predicted not only self-reported illness, but also such biomarkers as viral shedding and infl ammatory cytokine activity. Evidence suggests that mindfulness meditation can reduce experienced stress and negative emotions. 13, 14 Similarly, both epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that regular exercise may protect people from ARI illness. 15, 16 A recent observational cohort study (n = 1,002 adults) reported 32% to 46% lower incidence, duration, and severity of ARI illness among the most active vs least active participants. 17 Thus, suffi cient evidence exists to justify testing the hypothesis that training in meditation or exercise can reduce susceptibility to ARI illness.\n\nThe experimental design used balanced, randomized allocation to 3 parallel groups: (1) mindfulness meditation, (2) moderate-intensity exercise, or (3) observational control. Allocation was directed using computergenerated randomization codes (balanced blocks of 3) in sequentially numbered envelopes.\n\nThe primary aim was to determine whether training in either meditation or exercise could reduce ARI illness burden compared with no intervention in the control group. Secondary aims included assessment of whether self-reported psychosocial states would respond to intervention, and whether these responses could help explain potential effects on ARI outcomes. These measures included perceived stress, positive and negative emotion, perceived social support, anxiety, optimism, sleep quality, and general physical and mental health. Secondary aims also included assessment of antibody response to infl uenza vaccination, which will be reported elsewhere. All participants received trivalent inactivated infl uenza vaccination during week 6 of the interventions.\n\nThe meditation intervention was derived from work by Jon Kabat-Zinn and others at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, where mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) was developed. 18 The University of Wisconsin (UW) program has been in existence since 1993. All UW instructors have advanced degrees, and all were trained in Massachusetts by the Kabat-Zinn's group. The standardized 8-week MBSR course includes weekly 2\u00bd-hour group sessions and 45 minutes of daily at-home practice. This intervention, originally designed for stress reduction, is based on the idea that an increased awareness of physical, emotional, and cognitive manifestations of stress may lead to a healthier mind-body response to stress. The concept of mindfulness refers to a state of nonjudgmental awareness, a heightened sensitivity to bodily sensation, and attention to one's own thoughts and emotions. The goal for learners is to continue lifelong meditation practice.\n\nThe exercise program was designed and led by senior exercise physiology staff at the UW Health Sports Medicine Center and was matched to the mindfulness meditation program in terms of duration (8 weeks), contact time (weekly 2\u00bd hour group sessions), home practice (45 minutes per day), and location. Two of the 3 UW exercise instructors had master's degrees in clinical exercise physiology. The third had a bachelor's in sports management. All had many years of experience, and all carried licensed athletic trainer and certifi ed strength and conditioning coach certifi cations. Borg's Rating of Perceived Exertion was used to guide participants toward moderate-intensity sustained exercise, with a target rating of 12 to 16 points on the 6 to 20 point scale. 19 Weekly group sessions were divided into didactic instruction (cognitive, logistic, and behavioral) and practice (moderately intensive exercise using stationary bicycles, treadmills, and other equipment). For most participants, home exercise consisted of brisk walking or jogging.\n\nBecause this trial was preliminary, we opted for observational control as the comparison study group, hoping to minimize risk of type II, as well as type I, error. 20 Control participants were monitored in the same manner as those receiving interventions and were eligible to receive meditation or exercise training, or monetary equivalent, at the conclusion of the trial.\n\nSAS software (SAS Institute Inc) was used to generate 165 unique identifi cation numbers in balanced blocks of 3. Codes were concealed in consecutively numbered sealed envelopes, which were opened after consent to indicate allocation.\n\nThis community-based trial was coordinated by the UW Department of Family Medicine. Behavioral training interventions were conducted at UW Research Park, a multipurpose outpatient clinic with exercise facilities and space suitable for meditation training.\n\nInclusion criteria were aged 50 years or older, willingness to undertake any of the 3 randomization outcomes, and reporting either 2 or more colds in the last 12 months or an average of 1 or more cold per year. Exclusion criteria were previous training or current practice of meditation, moderate exercise at least 2 times a week or vigorous exercise at least 1 time a week, and a score of less than 24 points on the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination 21 or more than 14 points on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression screen 22 ; immunodefi ciency, autoimmune, or malignant disease; or prior allergic reaction to infl uenza vaccine or egg allergy.\n\nThe protocol was approved by the UW Health Sciences Institutional Review Board. The trial was conducted in accordance with the protocol approved by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was monitored by a dataand safety-monitoring committee. The American Heart Association guidelines 23 for safety when beginning an exercise program were followed. There were no specifi c adverse outcomes designated for monitoring.\n\nCommunity-targeted recruitment methods included advertising in local media. Prospective participants were screened by telephone and then met in person for entry into the run-in trial, which consisted of 2 inperson appointments, 2 telephone contacts, and 1 set of homework questionnaires. Those completing the run-in trial were eligible for consent and entry into the main trial. For logistical reasons related to NIH funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the study had to be done in 1 year, and 2 cohorts were needed. The fi rst cohort began in September, and the second cohort began in January. Participants were monitored biweekly by telephone beginning postintervention and continuing until study exit at the end of May.\n\nThe primary outcome was defi ned as area-under-thecurve global severity for all ARI illness days throughout observation, from consent to study exit. During each ARI illness episode, severity was assessed once daily using a 24-item version of the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS). [24] [25] [26] The WURSS-24 adds items assessing headache, body aches, and fever to the well-validated WURSS-21. 27 Daily severity scores come from summing items 2 through 23; the fi rst and last items are analyzed separately. The beginning of each ARI illness episode was defi ned as the time a participant fi rst answered yes to either: \"Do you think you are coming down with a cold?\" or \"Do you think that you have a cold?\" The participant also had to score 2 or more points on the Jackson scale, 28 with at least 1 point from the following cold symptoms (or synonyms): (1) nasal discharge (runny nose), (2) nasal obstruction (plugged nose, stopped up nose, stuffi ness), (3) sneezing, or (4) sore throat (scratchy throat). To be classifi ed as an ARI illness episode, these criteria had to be met at least 2 days in a row. The last day of the ARI illness episode was the last day the participant rated illness severity higher than 0 using the fi rst item of the WURSS instrument, \"How sick do you feel today?\" Times of self-report were recorded, and illness duration was assessed in hours and minutes and then converted to decimalized days. Participants were provided Jackson and WURSS questionnaires at enrollment and were reminded with each study contact to begin documenting ARI symptoms as soon as they believed they might be getting a cold.\n\nWith each ARI illness episode, a nasal wash was collected within 3 days of symptom onset and analyzed for interleukin-8 (IL-8), neutrophil count, and viral nucleic acid. Elevated neutrophil count and IL-8 levels are indicators of infl ammation and correlate with symptom severity and viral shedding. 29, 30 Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods developed and validated at UW were used to identify respiratory viruses. 31\n\nSeveral validated self-report questionnaires were used to explore potential explanatory pathways linking behavioral interventions to ARI outcomes. The SF-12 is a 12-item version of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36) that measures overall health and provides algorithm-weighted physical and mental health scores. 32 The PSS-10 is a 10-item version of Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale that has been linked to ARI outcomes, including infl uenza. 10 The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) 33 assesses positive and negative emotion, also known to be linked to ARI outcomes. Spielberger's State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) assesses anxiety either as trait (baseline) or state (secondary outcome, explanatory factor). 34 The 6-item Life Orientation Test (LOT) assesses cognitive aspects of optimism. 35 To assess perceived social support, we used Ryff's 9-item Positive Relationships with Others (PR) scale. 36 The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 37 served as our measure of sleep quality. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) 38 assessed exercise, and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) 39 assessed mindfulness. The SF-12, PSS-10, PANAS, IPAQ, and MAAS were administered at baseline, 1 week postintervention, and monthly thereafter. The STAI, LOT, PR, and PSQI indices were scored at baseline, 1 week postintervention, and then again 3 months later.\n\nDuring each biweekly telephone call, we asked about visits to health care facilities (clinic, hospital, or urgent care), the reason for the visit, and about missed work or school activities. Health care visits and missed work days were then classifi ed as either related or unrelated to ARI illness, both by asking the participant's opinion and by cross-checking against selfreport WURSS-24 data. In questionable cases, classifi cation as ARI-related or not was done by the senior author (B.B.), guided by relevant data but blinded to allocation.\n\nThe sample size of 150 was based on power estimates contrasting (1) meditation vs control and (2) exercise vs control. To control for multiple testing, we chose a P \u2264.025 cutoff for null hypothesis rejection. One-sided testing was justifi ed by previously published research, all in the direction of positive results. To arrive at the primary outcome of area-under-the-curve global severity, we fi rst computed daily WURSS-24 scores by simple summation and then applied trapezoidal approximation over illness episodes. For the less than 2% of missing WURSS-24 data, we assessed patterns of missing data, which satisfi ed missing-at-random criteria, then applied a multiple imputation strategy, using an expectancy maximization algorithm, 40 which was undertaken before unblinding. Unadjusted between-group contrasts were calculated using 1-sided t tests for continuous variables and proportional difference testing for binomials. Because most participants did not experience ARI illness, zeroinfl ated regression models were used to control for potential confounders. These models take into account both logistic (incidence) and linear (days of illness or global severity) data. Covariates used in these models were age, sex, education, smoking status, body mass index, baseline physical and mental health (SF-12), and cohort. Because global severity was skewed, Box-Cox transformation was used for this outcome in these models. To explore potential causal pathways, we assessed the relationship of secondary outcomes measured just after interventions to the main outcomes. The statistical framework for potential mediation was based on the Baron and Kenny model, 41 modifi ed by Krull and MacKinnon, 42 and by coauthor Brown. 43 Additional detail on the results of the zeroinfl ated regression models and potential confounders is available in Supplemental Table 1 and Table 2. See  Supplemental Table 3 for information on model-data fi t (available at http://annfammed.org/content/ 10/4/337/suppl/DC1).\n\nOf 883 adults screened, 204 were entered in the run-in trial; 154 consented and were enrolled and randomized into the main trial, with 94 in cohort 1 and 60 in cohort 2 (Figure 1 ). Interventions began in September 2009 for cohort 1 and in January 2010 for cohort 2. Baseline measures were similar across the 3 groups (Table 1) . Both cohorts were monitored through May 2010. Retention was high, with 149 (96.7%) providing primary outcome data; 82% were female, 94% were white, and their mean age was 59.3 \u00b1 6.6 years.\n\nThere were 27 ARI episodes and 257 days of illness in the meditation group, 26 episodes and 241 ARI illness days for the exercise group, and 40 episodes and 453 ARI illness days for the control group (Table  2) . Mean global severity across all randomized participants was 144 for meditation, 248 for exercise, and 358 for control ( Figure 2 ). Comparing meditation with control groups, 1-sided t tests yielded P = .034 for illness days and P = .004 for global severity. Comparing exercise with control groups, corresponding P values were .032 for illness days and .16 for global severity. Adjusting for covariates using zero-infl ated multivariate regression models, both total days of illness (P = .033) and global severity (P = .010) appeared to be lower for meditation, but not for exercise (P = 0.47 and 0.31, respectively). Specifi c viruses were identifi ed for 53.8% of nasal wash samples tested from the meditation group, 42.1% of samples from the exercise group, and 54.3% of control samples (Table 2) . Viruses identifi ed included adenovirus (1), coronavirus (5), infl uenza (2), metapneumovirus (3), parainfl uenza (3), respiratory syncytial virus (2), and rhinovirus (28) . Both cases of infl uenza (A/2009/California/H1N1) were in the control group. Mean neutrophil counts (per high-power fi eld [HPF]) and IL-8 concentration in the 3 groups were 108/HPF and 910 pg/ mL for the meditation group, 104/ HPF and 694 pg/mL for the exercise group, and 110/HPF and 658 pg/mL for the control group. Between-group differences were not statistically signifi cant for these biomarkers, except for slightly higher IL-8 levels in nasal wash collected during ARIs from participants in the meditation group (P = .022).\n\nIn the meditation group, there were 99 days of missed work (16 were ARI-related) and 116 health care visits (10 were ARI-related). Among the exercise group there were 91.5 days of missed work (32 ARI-related) and 116 health care visits (15 ARI-related). In the control group there were 144.5 missed days of work (67 ARI-related) and 121 health care visits (16 ARI-related). Total number of health care visits and total and ARI-related missed work days were not statistically distinguishable among the groups. ARIrelated absenteeism, however, was signifi cantly lower for the meditation group (P <.001) and marginally so for the exercise group (P = .041) when compared with the control group.\n\nAlthough most self-reported psychosocial health indicators trended in expected directions, only selfreported exercise and the mental health portion of the SF-12 displayed statistically signifi cant differences when compared with the control group (Table 3) . Compared with control participants, those assigned to exercise training increased their IPAQ scores at 9 weeks, a change which persisted at 3 months. Statistically signifi cant improvements in SF-12 mental health in both groups were more modest, and were seen at 9 weeks in the exercise group and at both 9 weeks and 3 months among those assigned meditation training. Statistical analyses directed at assessing potential mediation failed to show clear and convincing pathways from interventions to outcomes.\n\nWe observed substantive reductions in ARI illness among those randomized to exercise training, and even greater benefi ts among those receiving mindfulness meditation training. Incidence, duration, and global severity of ARI illness were 29%, 43%, and 31% lower in the exercise group and 33%, 43%, and 60% lower in the mindfulness group, respectfully, compared with control. Although not all of these observed benefi ts were statistically signifi cant, the magnitude of the observed reductions in ARI illness is surely clinically signifi cant. That our fi ndings are corroborated both by laboratory-measured biomarkers and by reductions in work absenteeism further supports a positive interpretation. Implications for the workplace may be especially important. Compared with the control group, all-cause absenteeism was 31% lower in both intervention groups. Looking at ARIrelated absenteeism, there were 48% fewer days missed in the exercise group, and 76% fewer in the meditation group. For meditation especially, these fi ndings are unlikely be due to chance. Given that apart from hand washing, no ARI prevention strategies have before been proven, these fi ndings are especially noteworthy.\n\nThis clinical trial has both strengths and limitations. In terms of strengths, this randomized trial is the fi rst to assess effects of mindfulness meditation on ARI illness and the fi rst to use a validated outcome measure to assess effects of exercise on ARI illness. It is also the fi rst to compare 2 behavioral interventions with a valid control condition, allowing head-to-head comparative effectiveness assessment. The use of multiplex PCR to identify viruses and of IL-8 and neutrophil assays to assess infl ammation is also a strength. Limitations include the inescapable fact that participants in such a trial cannot be blinded to behavioral training interventions, thus allowing for the possibility of self-report bias. Also, even with the large effect sizes observed, our sample size was only marginal for statistical signifi cance for several outcomes. Although it is not likely that our fi ndings are entirely due to chance, the a priori selection of P \u2264.025 as a cutoff for null hypothesis rejection does leave that statistical possibility open for some outcomes. Finally, interpretation of results is limited in that the fi rst cohort was followed for a full cold and infl uenza season, Mean missed days, n (95% CI) 1.9 (0.8 to 3.1) c Two nasal wash samples from the meditation group yielded both CoV and HRV. One ARI in the control group yielded both AdV and HRV.\n\nwhereas the second was followed for fewer months during the winter-spring ARI season. The data do not suggest generalized self-report bias. If participants in the control group were overreporting ARI illness, we would expect them to also report a similar magnitude of improved scores on other selfreport health measures, which they did not do. Similar thinking applies to the biomarkers. If participants in the intervention groups were under-reporting ARI illness, one might expect that the episodes they did report would be relatively more severe, with higher levels of infl ammatory markers and higher viral identifi cation rates. These trends were not seen, except for marginally higher IL-8 levels in the meditation group. Notes: Data shown represent mean at 9 weeks (1 week after 8-week intervention), then approximately 3 months later. Two-sided P values calculated by simple 2-sample contrast using t test, SAS software. Statistical signifi cance for secondary outcomes should be interpreted as exploratory and hypothesis-generating rather than confi rmatory and hypothesis-testing. a P <.01 for comparison of intervention means vs control means at each period. b P <.05 for comparison of intervention means vs control means at each period. We were surprised to fi nd that, apart from marginally reduced stress and increased optimism, the interventions did not appear to have much infl uence on self-reported psychosocial health measures. One partial explanation may be that this was a relatively healthy population. National norms for similarly aged adults using the SF-12 are 46.3 for physical health and 50.1 for mental health. 44 At baseline, participants in our study had SF-12 scores of 50.5 and 51.4, respectively. Our participants also reported less stress than is usual, with mean PSS-10 scores of 11.9, well below national averages of 13.4 reported in 2006 and 14.5 in 2009. 45 Interpreting these fi ndings, one might hypothesize that sicker and more stressed people would have more to gain, and that similar interventions might yield greater benefi ts in those populations. That hypothesis deserves further testing.\n\nIn conclusion, this ground-breaking randomized trial of meditation and exercise vs wait-list control among adults aged 50 years and older found signifi cant reductions in ARI illness. Corresponding reductions in time lost to work point toward socioeconomic as well as personal health benefi ts. If these results are confi rmed in future studies, there will be important implications for public and private health-related policy and practice, as well as for scientifi c research regarding mechanisms of health maintenance and disease prevention.\n\nTo read or post commentaries in response to this article, see it online at http://www.annfammed.org/content/10/4/337."}
