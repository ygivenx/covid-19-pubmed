{"title": "Final 2012 Reports of Nationally Notifiable Infectious Diseases", "body": "The tables listed in this report on pages 970\u2013982 summarize finalized data, as of June 30, 2013, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) for 2012. These data will be published in more detail in the Summary of Notifiable Diseases \u2014 United States, 2012 (1). Because no cases were reported in the United States during 2012, the following diseases do not appear in these early release tables: anthrax; eastern equine encephalitis virus disease, nonneuroinvasive; poliomyelitis, paralytic; poliovirus infection, nonparalytic; Powassan virus nonneuroinvasive disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV); smallpox; western equine encephalitis virus disease, neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive; yellow fever; and viral hemorrhagic fevers.\n\nPolicies for reporting NNDSS data to CDC can vary by disease or reporting jurisdiction depending on case status classification (i.e., confirmed, probable, or suspected). The publication criteria used for the 2012 finalized tables are listed in the \u201cPrint Criteria\u201d column of the NNDSS event code list, available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/nndss_event_code_list_2012.pdf. In addition, only cases from reporting jurisdictions where the nationally notifiable disease is reportable are published. The NNDSS website is updated annually to include the latest national surveillance case definitions approved by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists for classifying and enumerating cases of nationally notifiable infectious diseases.\n\nPopulation estimates are from the National Center for Health Statistics postcensal estimates of the resident population of the United States for July 1, 2011\u2013July 1, 2012, by year, county, single-year of age (0 to \u226585 years), bridged-race, (white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander), Hispanic origin (not Hispanic or Latino, Hispanic or Latino), and sex (vintage 2011), prepared under a collaborative arrangement with the U.S. Census Bureau. Population estimates for states are available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race/data_documentation.htm#vintage2011 as of June 13, 2013. Population estimates for territories are 2012 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau (2)."}
