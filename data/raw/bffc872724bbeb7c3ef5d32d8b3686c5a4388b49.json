{"title": "A Novel Molecular Microbiologic Technique for the Rapid Diagnosis of Microbial Invasion of the Amniotic Cavity and Intra- Amniotic Infection in Preterm Labor with Intact Membranes NIH Public Access", "body": "Preterm birth is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC), determined with cultivation techniques, occurs in one of every four women who deliver preterm. Yet, this may be an underestimate since the diagnosis of MIAC has represented a challenge for decades.\n\nEarly investigation used transcervical catheters to evaluate the microbial state of the amniotic cavity; 44-49 however, this approach was abandoned because of the problem of contamination. Thereafter, identification of bacteria by cultivation techniques in amniotic fluid (AF) retrieved by amniocentesis became the \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis of MIAC. 10, 11, 15, 16, 19, 24, 42 , 50-66 A major challenge using this approach is that culture results take several days to become available. This delay has led to the standard practice of initiating intravenous antimicrobial agents for patients with a positive Gram stain or indicators of inflammation prior to identifying the microorganism responsible for a suspected infection. [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] The latter assumes that inflammation is always due to infection and this is not the case. [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] Rapid test results are needed to determine whether and which antimicrobial agents should be administered. Other decisions, such as the administration or discontinuation of tocolysis, timing of the delivery, etc., also depend on the availability of reliable information about the presence of microorganisms in the amniotic cavity. The application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques for the diagnosis of infectious diseases can provide results in time for rapid decision-making. 81-88 Moreover, these techniques can improve the detection of microorganisms by identifying microbes which are difficult to culture, 34, 39, 42, 65, 89-102 and can provide information about anti-microbial resistance and virulence factors. 85, 103-105 It is unknown whether these techniques can be used at the point of care to inform treatment decisions in an obstetrical setting.\n\nIn this study of patients with spontaneous preterm labor (PTL) and intact membranes, AF culture was compared to a new technique using a combination of broad-range real-time PCR with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) [Ibis\u00ae technology]. [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] This technique is capable of identifying the genus and species of microorganisms in AF within 8 hours, and therefore, in time for clinical decisions. 106, 107, 109-114 PCR/ESI-MS has been validated in several clinical settings 106, and has the potential to revolutionize the detection of infectious agents in modern obstetrics. The study objectives were to: 1) compare the performance of AF culture and PCR/ESI-MS in identifying MIAC in patients with PTL and intact membranes; 2) assess the magnitude of intra-amniotic inflammation in patients with MIAC identified by PCR/ESI-MS; and 3) examine the relationship between MIAC detected by PCR/ESI-MS and adverse pregnancy outcome.\n\nA cohort study was conducted by searching the clinical database and bank of biological samples of Wayne State University, the Detroit Medical Center, and the Perinatology Research Branch of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) (Detroit, MI) to identify patients with a diagnosis of spontaneous PTL with intact membranes. Patients were included if they met the following criteria: 1) had a singleton gestation; 2) presented with PTL and intact membranes; and 3) had an amniocentesis (trans-abdominal amniocentesis) performed between 20 and 35 weeks of gestation with microbiological studies. Patients were excluded from the study if: 1) rupture of the chorioamniotic membranes occurred before AF collection; or 2) chromosomal or structural fetal anomaly was present. Perinatal mortality was defined as the occurrence of fetal or neonatal death.\n\nAll patients provided written informed consent and the use of biological specimens and clinical data for research purposes was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of NICHD and Wayne State University.\n\nPatients with preterm labor and intact membranes who underwent transabdominal ultrasound-guided amniocentesis for evaluating possible MIAC (within the standard of care at Hutzel Women's Hospital) were eligible for the study. AF was immediately transported in a capped sterile syringe to the clinical laboratory where it was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including genital mycoplasmas. Evaluation of white blood cell (WBC) count, glucose concentration and Gram stains of AF were also performed shortly after collection. AF not required for clinical assessment was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C shortly after the amniocentesis, and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at -70\u00b0C until analysis. The presence of intra-amniotic inflammation was assessed by determination of AF interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration by ELISA. AF IL-6 concentrations were determined for research purposes, and such results were not used in patient management.\n\nAF was analyzed using cultivation techniques (aerobic, anaerobic and genital mycoplasmas) as well as with PCR/ESI-MS (Ibis\u00ae Technology -Athogen, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, DNA was extracted from 300 uL of AF using a method that combines bead-beating cell lysis with a magnetic-bead based extraction method. 135, 136 The extracted DNA was amplified on the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) spectrum assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR/ESI-MS can identify 3400 bacteria and 40 Candida spp, which are represented in the platform's signature database. 112, 114, 137 A total of 200 \u03bcL of extract was\n\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and visual plot inspection were used to assess the normality of continuous data distributions. Spearman's non-parametric correlation coefficients were calculated. The Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney U tests were used to test for differences in arithmetic variable distributions. The X 2 or Fischer's exact test were used to test for differences in proportions, as appropriate. Quantile regression models were fit to test for median differences adjusting for potential confounders, including gestational age and cervical dilatation at amniocentesis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted and the Mantel-Haenszel log-rank test was used to test for differences in time-to-spontaneous preterm delivery. Logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression models were fit to examine magnitudes of association. A cutoff for classifying PCR/ESI-MS results according to the microbial inoculum size (genome copies/well) in each sample was selected upon inspection of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the identification of intraamniotic inflammation among patients with detectable gene copies by PCR/ESI-MS. For all analyses, a two-tailed p value <0.05 was considered significant. SPSS v.15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used to analyze the data.\n\nBaseline characteristics of the study population are displayed in Table I \n\nThe prevalence of MIAC based on a positive AF culture was 7% (10/142). PCR/ESI-MS detected amplified DNA in 21% (30/142) of the AF samples (Table I) . Upon inspection of a ROC curve for the identification of intra-amniotic inflammation (IL-6 \u2265 2.6 ng/mL) among patients with detectable DNA from bacteria and/or virus using PCR/ESI-MS (Figure 1 ), results were classified according to microbial burden as positive or negative. Positive tests had 17 or more GE/well, whereas negative tests had fewer than 17 GE/well, or genomic material was undetected. Figure 2 shows a Venn diagram describing the combined results of AF culture and PCR/ESI-MS. Seven of the 17 patients with positive PCR/ESI-MS (>17 GE/ well) had positive AF cultures.\n\nFor each patient with detectable genomic material by PCR/ESI-MS or positive AF cultures, the microorganisms identified, concentrations of inflammatory markers in amniotic fluid, gestational age at delivery, as well as the presence or absence of histologic acute chorioamnionitis are shown in Table II . The most frequent microorganism identified by PCR/ESI-MS was Ureaplasma parvum, (instead of Ureaplasma urealyticum, which was the most common microorganism identified by standard AF culture). Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis and Acinetobacter junii were only detected by PCR/ESI-MS. Two patients (1.4%) had a positive viral assay for Human Enterovirus using\n\nThe microbial inoculum size, expressed as GE/well, was significantly correlated with AF concentration of IL- 6 Figure 3A ). The median AF IL-6 concentration was significantly higher in patients with positive PCR/ESI-MS results (\u2265 17 GE/well) and negative AF cultures than among: 1) women with positive AF cultures and negative PCR/ESI-MS results (n=3); and 2) patients (n=122) with negative AF cultures and negative PCR/ESI-MS [87 (IQR: 11.3 -264) ng/mL vs. 0.2 (IQR: 0.2 -0.3), and 1.1 (IQR: 0.7-5) ng/mL, respectively, p<0.001]. However, the median AF IL-6 concentration was significantly higher in patients without MIAC (by AF culture and PCR/ESI-MS) than in patients with positive AF culture and negative PCR/ESI-MS (p=0.009) ( Figure 3A ).\n\nDifferences in the median AF WBC count among the four study groups were consistent with those of AF IL-6. There were no differences in the median WBC count among patients with positive PCR/ESI-MS (\u2265 17 GE/well) who had positive (n=7) or negative (n=10) AF cultures [490 (IQR: 50-1920) vs. 185 (IQR: 0.7-1043) cell/mm 3 , p=0.28]. The median AF WBC count among these two study groups was significantly greater than the median AF WBC count of the two study groups with negative PCR/ESI-MS (<17 GE/well), irrespective of the AF culture results (p<0.0001) ( Figure 3B ). Differences in the median AF IL-6 and WBC concentrations among the four study groups were consistent both in direction and statistical significance when fitting a quantile regression model to adjust for potential confounders, including gestational age and cervical dilatation at amniocentesis [data not shown]. Figure 4A shows the prevalence of intra-amniotic inflammation (IL-6 \u2265 2.6 ng/mL) by the combined results of AF culture and PCR/ESI-MS. Intra-amniotic inflammation was diagnosed in 70% (n=7/10) and 94% (n=16/17) of patients with positive AF culture and a positive PCR/ESI-MS (\u226517 GE/well) results, respectively. These patients accordingly had intra-amniotic infection (i.e., MIAC and intra-amniotic inflammation).\n\nAll but one participant with a positive PCR/ESI-MS (\u2265 17 GE/well) and a negative AF cultures had intra-amniotic inflammation [90%, (9/10)]. These patients were significantly more likely to have intra-amniotic inflammation than women with negative tests, adjusting for gestational age and cervical dilatation at amniocentesis [odds ratio (OR) 12.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5 -97] ( Table III) . None of the three women with positive AF cultures and negative PCR/ESI-MS had intra-amniotic inflammation. Importantly, 32% (39/122) of the patients with negative results for both tests (AF culture and PCR/ESI-MS), which are considered \"sterile\" samples, had intra-amniotic inflammation ( Figure 4A ).\n\nThe relationship between detectable microorganisms in the amniotic fluid and acute histological chorioamnionitis Figure 4B shows the prevalence of histologic acute chorioamnionitis among the four study groups, according to the results of PCR/ESI-MS and AF culture. Each of the seven patients with positive AF cultures and positive PCR/ESI-MS results (GE/well \u2265 17) had histologic acute chorioamnionitis. Histologic acute chorioamnionitis was diagnosed in 70% (7/10) of patients with a positive PCR/ESI-MS (\u2265 17 GE/well) and negative AF cultures. These patients were significantly more likely to have acute histological chorioamnionitis than women with negative tests, adjusting for gestational age and cervical dilatation at amniocentesis [OR 5.1, 95%CI 1.01-26, respectively] ( Table III) . One of the three women with positive AF culture and negative PCR/ESI-MS had mild histologic acute chorioamnionitis (stage 1 subchorionitis/chorionitis) ( Figure 4B ).\n\nThe observations described in the previous paragraph, combined with the parameters assessing intra-amniotic inflammation, reveals that a positive AF culture among patients with negative PCR/ESI-MS results likely reflect either early-phase microbial invasion, in which an inflammatory response is not detectable, or contamination of the specimen (falsepositive culture).\n\nTable IV presents the positive predictive values (PPV) of AF culture and positive PCR/ESI-MS (\u2265 17 GE/well) for the identification of patients who delivered spontaneously prior to 37 and 32 weeks, respectively. The PPV of a positive AF culture for spontaneous delivery before 37 and 32 weeks was 90% and 66.7%, respectively. In contrast, the PPV of a positive PCR/ESI-MS (\u2265 17 GE/well) was 94.1% and 91.7% for the same outcomes. Similarly, the PPV of a positive PCR/ESI-MS (\u2265 17 GE/well) and a positive AF culture for the identification of patients who delivered within 2 days of amniocentesis were 76.5% (13/17) and 50% (5/10), respectively (Table IV) .\n\nKaplan-Meier survival estimates, censoring subjects in whom labor was induced for maternal or fetal indications, show that the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval was significantly shorter in patients with positive PCR/ESI-MS results (\u2265 17 GE/well) and negative AF culture than in patients with negative results for both tests [1 (IQR: <1 -2) days vs. 25 (IQR: 5 -51) days; p=0.002]. There were no significant differences in the median amniocentesis-to-delivery interval between patients who had positive PCR/ESI-MS (\u2265 17 GE/well) with negative AF cultures [1 (IQR: <1 -2) days] and those patients with positive findings for both tests [1 (IQR: 1 -8) days] (p=0.6) ( Figure 5 ). Figure 6 shows a forest plot of the hazard ratios (HR) describing the relative risks of spontaneous preterm delivery (sPTD) for patients with positive PCR/ESI-MS (\u2265 17 GE/ well) and/or AF cultures compared to those with negative tests, adjusted for gestational age at amniocentesis and cervical dilatation. The risks (i.e., hazard) of sPTD at <37 weeks and, separately, <32 weeks, were significantly greater among patients with positive PCR/ESI-MS results (\u2265 17 GE/well), both with and without positive AF cultures, when compared to women with negative tests [sPTD <37: AF+, HR 3.9 (95%CI 1.7-9.1) and AF-, HR 3.8 (95%CI 1.8-8.1); sPTD <32: AF+, HR 3.3 (95%CI 1.1-10.1) and AF-, HR 5.2 (95%CI 2-13.4)].\n\nThe prevalence of perinatal death (fetal and neonatal death) differed significantly among the four study groups defined by the results of AF culture and PCR/ESI-MS (p=0.03) (Figure 7 ). Twenty percent of perinatal death (4/19) occurred in the 7% (10/142) of women with positive PCR/ESI-MS and negative AF culture results. Offspring of these women were at fivefold greater risk of perinatal mortality than those of women with negative AF culture and negative PCR/ESI-MS results (OR 5.6; 95% CI 1. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . There was no difference in the rate perinatal death for offspring of women with positive PCR/ESI-MS according to the results of AF culture [positive culture 29% (2/7) vs. negative culture 40% (4/10); p=1.0].\n\nPrincipal findings of the study-1) The prevalence of MIAC in patients with preterm labor and intact membranes was 7% using standard cultivation techniques and 12% using PCR/ESI-MS; 2) patients with positive PCR/ESI-MS (\u226517 GE/well) and negative AF cultures had higher rates of intra-amniotic inflammation and histologic acute chorioamnionitis, shorter intervals to delivery, and their offspring were at greater risk of perinatal mortality than patients with negative results for both tests; 3) there were no differences in these factors when comparing patients with positive PCR/ESI-MS (\u226517 GE/ well) who had positive to those with negative AF cultures; and 4) genomic material from viruses in AF were detected in two patients [1.4% (2/142)]. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that PCR/ESI-MS can be used as a rapid test to diagnose MIAC and guide patient management.\n\nA key transition in human life is the emergence from a sterile to a non-sterile environment at the time of birth. 145 The amniotic fluid is sterile under normal circumstances. 43, [146] [147] [148] Upon conducting systematic investigations using cultivation and molecular techniques, we found that the overwhelming majority of women with a normal pregnancy outcome do not have evidence of bacteria 62, 147, 149, 150 or viruses in the amniotic cavity. [151] [152] [153] [154] In contrast, 25 -40% of patients with preterm labor and intact membranes who deliver preterm have evidence of MIAC, 7-43, 155, 156 whereas 50-75% of women with pre-labor rupture of membranes (PROM) have MIAC. 25, 53, 101, 156 The prevalence of MIAC in patients with PROM is a function of the obstetrical circumstances that prompted investigation of the microbial state in the amniotic cavity. For example, the earlier the gestational age at presentation with preterm labor or preterm PROM, the higher the frequency of MIAC. 20, 26, 41, 99, 101, 157-159 More importantly, in patients admitted with PROM, the frequency of MIAC increases from 39% (24/61) without labor, to 75% (36/48) with the onset of spontaneous preterm labor (p=0.0004). 53 This unique data was obtained before routine administration of antibiotics in patients with preterm PROM, and is the basis for the clinical dogma that the onset of labor in these women is frequently due to subclinical intra-amniotic infection.\n\nUsing cultivation techniques, MIAC has been identified in several obstetrical disorders with the prevalence ranging from 10-12% in patients with preterm labor and intact membranes, 9-16, 20-27, 30-37, 61 to as high as 51% in pregnant women diagnosed with acute cervical insufficiency (Table V) . [160] [161] [162] [163] These cultivation-based studies provide strong evidence for the involvement of microorganisms in multiple pregnancy complications. Yet, cultivation techniques represent a minimum estimate of the prevalence of MIAC. 39, 99, 156, 164, 165 The advantages of molecular techniques for the identification of microorganisms Molecular testing for the detection of microorganisms is considered to be the \"diagnostic tool for the new millennium\". 85, 166, 167 In the U.S. alone, 5 million cases of infectious disease-related illness are reported annually, and many are considered to be undiagnosed. 168 Accordingly, the application of these tools to acute care settings is a major emphasis.\n\nIn the context of pregnancy, identification and culture of bacteria from AF has been considered the \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis of MIAC. 10, 11, 15, 16, 19, 24, 42, [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] However, successful cultivation of an organism requires knowledge of the conditions necessary to support growth of specific microorganisms. 169 Often, these conditions are unknown, rendering standard techniques inadequate in detecting many organisms implicated in human diseases. [170] [171] [172] [173] [174] For example, Treponema pallidum, the organism responsible for syphilis, has remained difficult to culture for decades. 175, 176 In addition, cultivation methods are frequently unreliable (and prone to false-negative results) when antibiotics are administered before the biological fluid is obtained for culture. 67-75 Moreover, the results generally take days, and are often not available in time to inform clinical decisions (e.g. antibiotic administration). This is why physicians have adopted the standard approach of beginning intravenous antibiotic therapy without knowing the etiologic agent responsible for a suspected infection. [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] The realization that only a small fraction of the microbial world is readily culturable in clinical laboratories [177] [178] [179] [180] [181] prompted the development of PCR-based diagnostic techniques for infectious diseases. 83-88 The advantages of molecular techniques are that they allow broad-spectrum microbial detection, evaluation of emerging novel infections, assessment of antimicrobial resistance profiling, 85, 103, 105 virulence factors, 85, 104 and relatively low cost. 85 These methods were used to identify agents responsible for multiple conditions previously considered as being of unknown etiology (e.g. Tropheryma whipplei, the agent of Whipple's disease, 182, 183 Mycobacterium genavense, a cause of disseminated infections in AIDS patients, 184 Ehrlichia chaffeensis, an agent of human tick-borne monocytic ehrlichiosis, 185 and Bartonella henselae, the agent of Trench fever). [186] [187] [188] However, implementation of PCR techniques in clinical practice has not been easy. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi must be investigated using separate assays, and the time required to obtain results is longer than when using emerging techniques, such as PCR/ESI-MS.\n\nBroad-range PCR methods for the detection of bacteria are based on the fundamental premise that 16S rRNA gene is evolutionarily conserved exclusively in bacterial species. 189, 190 The detection of this gene in a sterile biological fluid (such as amniotic fluid) accordingly indicates the presence of bacteria. This approach has been used by many investigators to identify bacteria in amniotic fluid using speciesspecific 34, 39, 42, 65, 89, 92, 93, 95-97, 100, [191] [192] [193] [194] [195] [196] or broad-range PCR. 90-92, 99, 101, 143, 144, [197] [198] [199] [200] Most of the studies have shown that broad-range PCR assays and specific assays are superior to culture in the detection of microorganisms in the amniotic fluid. 90-92, 99, 101, 143, 144, [197] [198] [199] [200] Yet, until recently, these techniques have remained research procedures because the time required to obtain results has precluded their use as a point of care test.\n\nA fundamental advantage of the PCR/ESI-MS technology over conventional PCR methods using broad primers is that mass spectrometry allows the rapid identification of the organism. 109, 111 PCR/ESI-MS results can be obtained within 8 hours. 106, 112, 113 This is a key feature since failure to identify pathogens in time to inform clinical decisions is a major impediment to the treatment of infectious diseases. The PCR/ESI-MS system is also able to quantify the amount of genomic material present in a biological sample. 108, 109 Genome quantification is useful in clinical circumstances including the selection of antimicrobial agents and the monitoring of therapeutic benefit. This can also be used in selecting the route of delivery (vaginal vs. cesarean delivery) in cases of HIV infection. [201] [202] [203] [204] [205] [206] [207] Other examples in which this approach has been valuable include visceral leishmaniasis, [208] [209] [210] infectious mononucleosis, [211] [212] [213] and mortality risk assessment in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. 214, 215 PCR/ESI-MS technology also uses the concept of \"triangulation\" to distinguish among microorganisms. This term refers to taking measurements from multiple loci distributed across the microbial genome. 108, 109 Subsequently, ESI-MS is used to rapidly determine the precise mass-to-charge ratio of the fragments amplified based upon their nucleotide composition to create a signature that allows for the identification of a large number of microorganisms 109, 112 at the genus and species levels. 112, 116, [120] [121] [122] 131 \n\nThe identification of bacteria in amniotic fluid is a pathological finding, which we have defined as \"microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity\". 18, 24, 40, 57, 59, 60, 62, 143, 144, 160, 165, [216] [217] [218] [219] [220] The distinction between such invasion and infection is predicated on the host response to the invading microorganism(s). 23, 42, 43, 60, 149, 156, 157, 165, 217, 218, [220] [221] [222] [223] [224] [225] [226] [227] [228] [229] [230] [231] [232] [233] [234] [235] [236] Thus, intra-amniotic infection refers to the combination of MIAC with intra-amniotic inflammation. 40, 41, 43, 162, 165, 219, 235, [237] [238] [239] In this study, MIAC was diagnosed by PCR/ ESI-MS in 12% (n=17/142) of the study population, and 94% (n=16/17) of these patients exhibited a host inflammatory response consistent with intra-amniotic infection (AF IL-6 \u2265 2.6 ng/mL). In contrast, 70% (n=7/10) of patients with positive amniotic fluid cultures had such a host response, although each of the seven cases with both tests positive met the criteria for intra-amniotic infection. Accordingly, use of PCR/ESI-MS resulted in a twofold greater prevalence of intra-amniotic infection (5% vs. 11%).\n\nThe role of viral infection in spontaneous preterm labor has not been examined rigorously. Previous studies using PCR-based methods have shown conflicting results describing the prevalence of viral invasion into the amniotic cavity (VIAC), ranging from non-detectable, to as high as 6.4%. [151] [152] [153] [240] [241] [242] In this study, we used PCR/ESI-MS to detect multiple organisms in the same sample, (viruses and bacteria), as co-infection may occur. 109 However, only two patients (1.4%) had positive results for Enterovirus. Recently, Gervasi et al., using specific PCR assays for a panel of viruses reported that the prevalence of VIAC during the second trimester was 2.2%. 154 In that study, Gervasi et al. collected amniotic fluid samples from asymptomatic patients during the second trimester. 154 The presence of viral nucleic acid in AF was not associated with detectable inflammation as reflected by AF WBC count, glucose and IL-6 concentrations between patients with and without VIAC. 154 Similarly, Baschat et al., suggested that the isolation of viruses in the amniotic cavity was not associated with adverse maternal or perinatal outcome. 153 Recent studies suggest that systemic viral infections may predispose pregnant mice to the effect of microbial products such as endotoxin. 243 Specifically, pregnant mice infected with a herpesvirus were more likely to have spontaneous preterm labor and deliver following endotoxin administration than those who were not exposed to the virus. 243, 244 Further studies are required to determine if this is a mechanism of disease operative in humans. It is well known that viral infections of the respiratory tract predispose to bacterial infections and pneumonia. [245] [246] [247] [248] The same may be the case in the lower genital tract. 249 However, if the viral infections are not systemic (and associated with a symptomatic state), but are localized to the uterine cervix, or other parts of the genital tract, the identification of subclinical infection would pose an important challenge. Yet, given the high prevalence and diversity of viruses, as well as the severity of the consequences of viral predisposition to bacterial infections, this possibility cannot be ignored.\n\nA challenge when interpreting the results of molecular microbiologic techniques is differentiating true-from false-positive results. PCR methods can amplify extremely small quantities of microbial DNA such that contamination of a specimen may appear as a positive result.\n\nIn this study, we used the host response to microbial invasion (e.g. intra-amniotic inflammation, histologic acute chorioamnionitis, and the onset of spontaneous preterm delivery) to assess the clinical significance of microbial detection by PCR/ESI-MS. We found that the microbial burden (expressed as gene copies/well) was significantly correlated with each marker of intra-amniotic inflammation, even when excluding patients with positive amniotic fluid cultures. The prevalence of intra-amniotic inflammation and histologic acute chorioamnionitis in patients with negative cultures and positive PCR/ESI-MS was 90% and 70%, respectively. Patients with positive PCR/ESI-MS results and negative amniotic fluid cultures also had a significantly shorter interval to spontaneous preterm delivery than women with negative tests. Moreover, neonates born to mothers with positive PCR/ESI-MS and negative amniotic fluid cultures were at five-fold greater risk of perinatal mortality than those born to mothers with negative tests. Together, these findings strongly support the conclusion that a positive PCR/ESI-MS (\u226517 GE/well) result represents a true positive finding, even when amniotic fluid cultures are negative.\n\nBacterial cultures are considered a sensitive test for the identification of microorganisms when the conditions for supporting growth of that particular microorganism are optimal. Even one organism can form a colony in culture under ideal circumstances; yet, one organism may be insufficient for detection using PCR methods. 250 In previous studies, we identified patients with positive amniotic fluid cultures who had negative PCR using broad primers and specific assays. 94, 99, 101, 194 These results were attributed to possible DNA degradation, 251 low inoculum size, 252 etc. The observations herein suggest that false negative PCR/ESI-MS results are an extremely rare phenomenon. None of the three patients with positive amniotic fluid cultures and negative PCR/ESI-MS results in this study had intra-amniotic inflammation, only one had mild histologic acute chorionitis/subchorionitis, and all three delivered after 35 weeks of gestation without major complications. It is accordingly doubtful that positive amniotic fluid culture with negative PCR/ESI-MS results constitutes a true-positive culture.\n\nAcidovorax sp. was identified by PCR/ESI-MS in one patient who had a negative amniotic fluid culture. The microbial burden in this case was low, (11 GE/well), the amniotic fluid Gram stain was negative, there was no evidence of intra-amniotic infection (by amniotic fluid IL-6, glucose, WBC count, or histologic acute chorioamnionitis); yet, the patient delivered before the 28 th week of gestation. Acidovorax sp. has been identified as a contaminant in other studies [253] [254] [255] and thus, it is unlikely that PCR/ESI-MS identified true infection, responsible for the process that led to preterm delivery. Preterm labor, in this case, is most likely attributable to a mechanism other than intra-amniotic infection. Further studies are necessary to investigate the frequency of false positive and negative PCR/ESI-MS results using fresh samples collected in a clinical setting.\n\nTherapy to reduce the rate of preterm birth in patients with symptoms of preterm labor has focused almost exclusively on tocolytic agents. [256] [257] [258] [259] [260] [261] [262] [263] [264] [265] [266] However, these efforts have had limited success. 263, 265, [267] [268] [269] This is partly attributable to the syndromic nature of preterm labor, 164, 165, 219, [270] [271] [272] which may require an etiology-based approach to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.\n\nMIAC and subclinical intra-amniotic inflammation are implicated in at least one-third of the cases of spontaneous preterm labor and delivery. 7-43, 155, 156 Furthermore, intra-amniotic infection has been recognized as predisposing to cerebral palsy [273] [274] [275] [276] [277] [278] [279] [280] [281] [282] [283] [284] [285] and chronic lung disease. 41, 286-301 However, with the exception of asymptomatic bacteriuria, [302] [303] [304] [305] [306] prophylactic antibiotic treatment has not been successful in the prevention of preterm birth, and some have claimed that it may increase the rate of preterm delivery. 332 The ineffectiveness of antibiotics has been attributed to the inclusion in randomized clinical trials of patients who do not evidence of infection, and therefore cannot benefit from antimicrobial therapy, 309, 314-320, 322-324, 326-331, 333 the choice and timing of antimicrobial agents, 334 the presence of biofilm [335] [336] [337] [338] [339] [340] in which bacteria are refractory to antimicrobial treatment, etc. Benefits of antimicrobial treatment could include eradication of intraamniotic infection in early phases, down regulation of the inflammatory cascade that leads to preterm labor and delivery, prevention of an exaggerated inflammatory response syndrome that may cause fetal injury, and even congenital neonatal sepsis.\n\nAnimal models of intra-amniotic infection have shown that early administration of antibiotics at, or within 12 hours after inoculation of bacteria in AF reduces the bacterial burden in blood, the peritoneum, the uterus, and amniotic fluid. 334, 341-343 Moreover, Grigsby et al. have shown that in an animal model of intra-amniotic infection, generated by the inoculation of Ureaplasma parvum, the administration of specific maternal antibiotic therapy (Azithromycin) can eradicate Ureaplasma parvum from the amniotic fluid and fetal lungs, prolonging pregnancy. 344 Eradication of MIAC with parenteral antibiotic has also been documented in patients with a short cervix as well as in patients with preterm labor. [345] [346] [347] [348] [349] For example, Hassan et al. reported that in patients with short cervix and positive AF culture for Ureaplasma urealyticum, AF cultures were sterile following 7 days of intravenous Azithromycin and three of the four cases delivered at term. 350 The rapid, high-throughput technique used in this study is a promising option that facilitates broader and faster identification of MIAC in patients with preterm labor and intact membranes, and is applicable to other complications of pregnancy. Accordingly, this technique may render standard cultivation methods of limited value as it would allow targeting of specific interventions for at risk patients, including hospitalization, delivery, or transfer to high level facilities with specialized neonatal care. Future studies are required to clarify whether timely administration of specific antibiotic therapy for intra-amniotic infection could improve perinatal outcomes. Yet, as noted previously by our group, 309, 345, 346, 351, 352 such studies may be difficult to conduct under the current framework of regulations protecting human subjects from research risks, since withholding antimicrobial therapy from immune-compromised patients (the human fetus) would most likely be ethically unacceptable.\n\nThis is the first report of the use of PCR/ESI-MS in the amniotic fluid of patients with PTL and intact membranes, as well as the first direct comparison of this technology with standard cultivation techniques. These results provide evidence of the importance of the number of genome copies of bacteria during intra-amniotic infection. Future studies are required to assess the performance of PCR/ESI-MS in freshly collected samples.\n\n1) Rapid diagnosis of intra-amniotic infection is possible using PCR/ESI-MS, which can provide results within 8 hours; 2) the combined use of biomarkers of inflammation and PCR/ESI-MS allows for the rapid identification of specific bacteria in cases of preterm labor and intra-amniotic inflammation; and 3) this approach may allow for administration of timely and specific interventions to reduce morbidity attributed to infection-induced preterm birth.\n\n14.
