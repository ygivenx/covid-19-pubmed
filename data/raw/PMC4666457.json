{"title": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance-Assisted Prediction of\nSecondary Structure for RNA: Incorporation of Direction-Dependent\nChemical Shift Constraints", "body": "To further explore the dispersion\nof resonances for GU pairs, whose\nchemical shifts are underrepresented in the literature compared to\nAU and GC pairs, NOESY and TOCSY spectra were measured for the following\nsequences to determine GH1, UH3, UH5, and AH2 chemical shifts: r(AGGCUU)2, r(AGUCGAUU)2, r(CUGGCUAG)2, r(CAGUCGAUUG)2, r(CCGAAUUUGG)2, r(CGGAAUUUCG)2, r(CGGAUAUUCG)2, r(CGUGAUUACG)2, r(CUGGAUUCAG)2, r(GAGAGCUUUC)2, r(GAGGAUCUUC)2, and r(GUGAAUUUAC)2. Imino proton 1D spectra for these sequences\nhave been published.50\n\nAll oligoribonucleotides\nwere purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., except for\nr(GUGAAUUUAC)2, which was synthesized by M. Serra (Allegheny\nCollege, Meadville, PA) using standard phosphoramidite chemistry.\nOligoribonucleotides were dissolved in 300 \u03bcL of 80 mM NaCl,\n18.8 mM NaH2PO4, 1.16 mM Na2HPO4, and 0.02 mM EDTA at pH 6.0. To provide a lock signal, 15\n\u03bcL of D2O was then added. NMR spectra were acquired\nwith a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer. A 35 ms mixing time was used\nfor 2D TOCSY spectra, and 100 and 400 ms mixing times were used for\n2D 1H\u20131H NOESY spectra. For 2D spectra,\nwater signals were suppressed\nwith a WATERGATE-style pulse with flipback.51,52 2D spectra were processed with NMRPipe53 and resonances assigned with SPARKY.54\n\nProton chemical shifts were referenced to a temperature-dependent\nwater shift (eq 1), where T is temperature in kelvin measured\nat pH 5.5.55 2,2-Dimethylsilapentate-5-sulfonic\nacid was used as an external reference standard for water.1\n\nThe\naccuracy of prediction of secondary structures was quantified by sensitivity\nand positive predictive value (PPV):23\n\nA predicted pair, i to j, was considered correct if the accepted structure\ncontained a pair from i to j, i \u00b1 1 to j, or i to j \u00b1 1. This accounts for the fact that comparative\nanalysis cannot always resolve the exact pairing and that pairs can\nbe dynamic.19\n\nA plasmid construct\ncontaining the sequence for human accelerated region 1 (HAR1) used\nby Beniaminov et al.9 was provided by A.\nKrol of the Institut de Biologie Mol\u00e9culaire et Cellulaire.\nThe plasmid was amplified in and purified from Escherichia\ncoli competent cells using standard plasmid preparation protocols.\nThe purified plasmid was linearized overnight by SmaI restriction endonuclease (New England BioLabs) at 25 \u00b0C. RNA\nwas transcribed from the linearized plasmid with T7 High Yield RNA\nSynthesis Kits (New England BioLabs), with 1 \u03bcg of plasmid per\n20 \u03bcL reaction mixture. After transcription mixtures had been\nincubated for 12 h at 37 \u00b0C, 5 \u03bcL of 100 mM EDTA was added\nto stop reactions. A sample with 15N- and 13C-labeled rGTP and rUTP (Sigma-Aldrich) was synthesized with a similar\nprotocol.\n\nHAR1 samples were purified with FPLC.56 FPLC fractions were concentrated and exchanged into NMR\nbuffer with Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units (EMD Millipore).\nNMR buffer consisted of 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaH2PO4/NaHPO4, and 0.05 mM Na2EDTA (pH 6.25). Each\nsample was placed in a susceptibility-matched Shigemi NMR tube (Shigemi, Inc.). Final NMR samples were\n300 \u03bcL, including 10 \u03bcL of D2O to provide a\nlock signal. The final RNA concentration of each sample was approximately\n0.2 mM.\n\nA pUC19 plasmid containing an insert for a 75 nt sequence\nfor the Bombyx mori R2 retrotransposon pseudoknot\nwas constructed\nand amplified with standard plasmid purification protocols (see the Supporting Information for the plasmid construct).\nThis construct differs from the 74 nt construct previously studied\nwith NMR39 by addition of the wild-type\n3\u2032 terminal C. The plasmid was linearized with NheI restriction\nendonuclease at 37 \u00b0C prior to in vitro transcription.\nUnlabeled and 13C- and 15N-labeled rGTP and\nrUTP samples were transcribed, purified with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,\nand extracted from gels with electroelution. Purified RNAs were exchanged\ninto NMR buffer (see ref (39)), concentrated with centrifugal filter units, and added\nto a Shigemi NMR tube. D2O was added to provide a lock\nsignal.\n\nNMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 600 MHz\nNMR spectrometer.\nNOESY spectra were acquired for the unlabeled HAR1 sample with mixing\ntimes of 125 and 250 ms at 25 \u00b0C and 60 ms at 15 \u00b0C. A 15N\u20131H HSQC spectrum was acquired for the\nlabeled HAR1 sample\nat 25 \u00b0C. Relevant acquisition parameters are listed in Table S1. NOESY spectra were acquired for the\nunlabeled 75 nt B. mori R2 retrotransposon pseudoknot\nwith a mixing time of 200 ms at 25 \u00b0C. A 15N\u20131H HSQC spectrum was acquired for the labeled B. mori R2 retrotransposon pseudoknot sample at 25 \u00b0C.\n\nAdjacent canonical\nbase pairs and therefore potential helices can be identified from\nNOEs between imino protons separated by <5 \u00c5. A database of\nimino proton distances between\ndoublets of canonical base pairs was assembled from 3D structures\nin the Protein Data Bank (PDB).57 Distances\nwere obtained from nonredundant\nX-ray structures with a resolution no larger than 2 \u00c5,58 to which hydrogens were added with\nthe REDUCE program59 and then averaged\nfor each doublet of canonical pairs. For doublets with at least one\nGU pair, G/G, G/U, and/or U/U, imino proton distances between adjacent\nbase pairs were averaged separately, although the 5\u2032G-5\u2032U\nand 3\u2032G-3\u2032U distances were averaged together for 5\u2032GG3\u2032/3\u2032UU5\u2032.\nA separate set of imino proton distances for each doublet was obtained\nfrom NMR structures. Imino distances between doublets adjacent to\nloops, bulges, and helix termini were not considered because the terminal\nor closing base pairs may be dynamic.\n\nMost average distances\nfrom the X-ray and NMR structures agreed within 0.3 \u00c5 (Table 1). In X-ray structures,\n26 interbase average imino proton distances were <5 \u00c5, thus\nallowing \u201cimino proton walks\u201d to identify helices.60 The exceptions were 5\u2032UA/3\u2032AU,\n5\u2032UG/3\u2032AU, 5\u2032UG/3\u2032GU, and G to U in X-ray\nstructures of 5\u2032CG/3\u2032GU. Thus, helices with these\ndoublets may not be completely constrained by NMR data. In published\nNMR spectra, however, an NOE between H3 of uracils of 5\u2032UA/3\u2032AU\nwas observed for a human R/G stem-loop61 and a hairpin stem from Yersinia enterocolitica.62 In contrast, a 5\u2032UA/3\u2032AU\nimino NOE was not observed for the core encapsidation signal RNA from\nMoloney MLV,63 likely because of overlap\nbetween the H3 signals. Similarly for 5\u2032UG/3\u2032AU, NMR\nspectra of the human R/G stem-loop61 and\nthe loop E region of Spinacia oleracia 5S rRNA64 have an NOE between either imino proton of the\nGU pair and UH3 of the AU pair, but these NOEs were not observed in\nthe spectrum of r(GUGAAUUUAC)2 reported here. For the 5\u2032CG/3\u2032GU\ndoublet, an NOE was observed between H3 of U and H1 of the 5\u2032\nG in NMR spectra of a mutant of an element of the 3\u2032 UTR of\nturnip crinkle virus65 and a domain of\nmedaka telomerase CR4/5.66 Sometimes spin\ndiffusion will produce imino\u2013imino proton NOEs even if the\nimino protons are separated by >5 \u00c5.60 Thus, complete helical walks are more\nlikely to be observed than expected for the distances in Table 1.\n\nTo expand\nthe database for GU pairs, exchangeable protons of short duplexes\nwere assigned from NOESY spectra and the nonexchangeable H5 and H6\nprotons of C and U were assigned\nfrom TOCSY spectra (Tables S2\u2013S13). CH5\u2013H41/42 cross-peaks in NOESY spectra differentiated\nC from U in the TOCSY spectra and initiated assignment of proton resonances.\nImino protons were identified as those of GU, GC, or AU pairs based\nlargely on their positions in the imino fingerprint regions, from\n10 to 12 ppm for GH1 and UH3 with a strong GH1/UH3 cross-peak for\nGU pairs, from 11 to 13.5 ppm for GH1 in GC pairs, and from 13 to\n15 ppm for UH3 in AU pairs.60\n\nAromatic\nproton assignments were confirmed with sequential aromatic walks.\nIn A-form RNA, H1\u2032 of a residue forms NOE contacts with its\nown H6 or H8 base proton and that of its 3\u2032 base, allowing\nsequential assignments.60 H2 of adenosine\nhas an intrastrand cross-peak to H1\u2032 of its 3\u2032 residue\nand an interstrand cross-peak to H1\u2032 of the residue 3\u2032\nof the base to which it is paired. While NMR spectra for all duplexes\nused in this study were assigned with similar methods, an example\nof the process for r(GAGGAUCUUC)2 is given below. Two others are given\nin the Supporting Information.\n\n2D\nNOESY spectra for r(GAGGAUCUUC)2 were obtained with mixing times of 100\nand\n400 ms at 5 and 20 \u00b0C, respectively. The G3 H1 and U8 H3 protons\nwere assigned\naccording to their positions in the imino region of the 100 ms spectrum\n(Figure 2). G4 H1 was\nidentified by its cross-peaks to U8 H3 and G3 H1, while G1 H1 displays\na weak resonance due to exchange with water. H3 of U6 was differentiated\nfrom U9 by its cross-peak to G4 H1. H5 to H6 peaks corresponding to\nC7 and C10 were differentiated by cross-peaks from the former\u2019s\nH41 and H42 to G4H1. Remaining aromatic proton and H1\u2032 assignments\nwere made with the 400 ms spectrum as described above (Figure 2). The H1\u2032 assignments\nof U6 and C7 were confirmed by NOE contacts to A5 H2, while those\nof G3 and C10 were confirmed by NOE contacts to A2 H2.\n\nNOEs from imino proton resonances provide\nidentification of intrabase pair resonances for H5 of C and U and\nH2 of A.60 A database of such NMR chemical\nshifts was assembled for\n78 GU wobble pairs, 292 AU pairs, and 490 GC pairs flanked on both\nsides by at least one canonical base pair and categorized according\nto the identities and orientations of the flanking canonical pairs.\nMost of the structures were 10\u201340 nt long and contained stem-loops,\nwhile a few were completely double-stranded RNA. Literature data were\nmostly obtained from the BMRB.45\n\nChemical shifts determined for GH1, UH3, and UH5 protons of GU pairs,\nAH2, UH3, and UH5 protons of AU pairs, and GH1 protons of GC pairs\non the basis of oligoribonucleotide spectra reported here were consistent\nwith existing data. The expanded database showed strong sequence-dependent\npatterns, which were used to determine chemical shift ranges that\nidentify the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction of base pair triplets\ncentered on GU, AU, and GC pairs (Table 2).\n\nFor GU pairs, a 2D plot of UH3 versus\nGH1 chemical shifts (Figure 3) revealed well-defined clusters for 5\u2032RGY3\u2032\nand 5\u2032YGR3\u2032, but 5\u2032RGR3\u2032 and 5\u2032YGY3\u2032\nregions overlap, where R and Y represent purines (G or A) and pyrimidines\n(C or U), respectively. A 2D plot of UH5 versus GH1 chemical shifts\ncontained well-defined clusters corresponding\nto 5\u2032RGY3\u2032, 5\u2032YGR3\u2032, and 5\u2032YGY3\u2032,\nbut not 5\u2032RGR3\u2032 due to overlap with the 5\u2032YGR3\u2032\nregion (Figure 3).\nThus, if triplets have a central GU pair, then GH1, UH3, and UH5 chemical\nshifts often reveal the direction of the helix (Figures 3 and 4).\n\nFor AU pairs, 2D plots of AH2 versus UH3 chemical shifts\n(Figure 5) revealed\ndefined clusters corresponding to 5\u2032RAY3\u2032\nand 5\u2032YAR3\u2032, but the 5\u2032RAR3\u2032 region overlaps\nwith 5\u2032YAY3\u2032. A 2D plot of UH3 versus UH5 chemical shifts\ncontained well-defined clusters corresponding\nto 5\u2032RAY3\u2032 and 5\u2032YAY3\u2032, but the 5\u2032RAR3\u2032\nregion overlaps with 5\u2032YAR3\u2032. Thus, if triplets have\na central AU pair, then UH3, AH2, and UH5 chemical shifts often reveal\nthe direction of the helix (Figures 5 and 6).\n\nFor GC pairs flanked by canonical base pairs,\na plot of the distribution of GH1 chemical shifts (Figure 7) showed that no GC pairs in\nthe 5\u2032RGY3\u2032 direction have a GH1 chemical shift below\n12.40 ppm, whereas no GC pairs in the 5\u2032YGR3\u2032 direction\nhave a chemical shift above 13.10 ppm. Thus, if triplets have a central\nGC pair, then a GH1 chemical shift below 12.40 ppm eliminates the\n5\u2032RGY3\u2032 direction and a shift above 13.10 ppm eliminates\nthe 5\u2032YGR3\u2032 direction.\n\nThe NAPSS-CS program identifies\nhelices from a sequence by applying NMR constraints to a dynamic programming\nalgorithm (Figure 8). This algorithm generates a free energy dot plot for a given sequence\nand recursively searches it for helices or sets of helices that fully\nmatch helical walk constraints from NMR. As in the previous version,39 NAPSS-CS considers imino walks across single-nucleotide\nbulges and also coaxial stacks if the helices are not in separate\npseudoknots. In NAPSS-CS, experimental chemical shifts for GH1, UH3,\nand UH5 in GU pairs, AH2, UH3, and UH5 in AU pairs, and GH1 in GC\npairs can be input, which may define the orientation of base pairs\nin helices (Table 2).\n\nTo reduce the search space, NAPSS-CS looks for\nthe dot plot with the minimal number of pairs needed to find at least\none complete match to all the helices revealed by NMR. Starting with\nthe dot plot with pairs in the predicted most stable structure based\nonly on thermodynamics, the number of pairs in the dot plot is increased\nby allowing base pairs found in structures generated at less favorable\nfree energy changes. The allowed free energy difference between the\npredicted most favorable free energy change and that used as a cutoff\nfor finding new potential base pairs is gradually increased in 1%\nincrements until there is at least one match for all of the helices\nrevealed by NMR.\n\nChemical exchange with water may prevent detection\nof imino protons\nof terminal base pairs and/or NOEs from those protons to imino protons\nof adjacent base pairs from being identified in NMR spectra and included\nin imino walk constraints. Therefore, the program extends matched\nhelices to canonical base pairs that can stack on the matched helices.\nFor every extended match set, NAPSS-CS forbids alternative pairings\nfor the nucleotides in the set, uses a dynamic programming algorithm\nto fold the RNA into a secondary structure by free energy minimization,\nand then re-forms the base pairs from the match set if they have not\nalready been re-formed by the dynamic programming algorithm. Because\nnucleotides are not allowed in matched base pairs to base pair to\nany nucleotide other than its matched partner, helices that are pseudoknotted\nonce the matched base pairs are added are allowed to form.67 Similar to the ShapeKnots algorithm,38 NAPSS-CS fills in single or tandem mismatches\nand removes isolated pairs. The latter eliminates possible nonsensical\npseudoknots. NAPSS-CS then calculates the folding free energy for\nevery structure with the extended matches still intact. The free energy\nchange for nonpseudoknotted secondary structures is calculated with\nthe INN-HB model.68,69 Free energy changes for structures\nwith pseudoknots are calculated\nby adding three energy terms: (a) the free energy change of the structure\nwith the pseudoknot removed (maximizing the number of remaining base\npairs)70 using the INN-HB model, (b) the\nenergy of the helix(es) that was removed when breaking the pseudoknot,\ncalculated with the INN-HB model (without intermolecular initiation\nor any loop free energy changes), and (c) a pseudoknot energy penalty\nintroduced in the ShapeKnots algorithm.38,71\n\nIf available,\nadditional constraints or restraints can be used\nto further reduce the folding space. These include restraints from\nSHAPE and other mapping experiments or pairing constraints that can\nbe derived, for example, from sequence comparison.\n\nHAR1 is\na rapidly evolving noncoding RNA discovered in the brains of chimpanzees\nand humans.8 Two secondary structures were\ninitially proposed\nfor HAR1, but NMR spectra10 confirmed the\nsecondary structure proposed by Beniaminov et al.9 (Figure 9). To expand on published NMR spectra, new spectra were measured\nfor HAR1 (Figure 10 and Figures S3\u2013S5). NOESY and 15N\u20131H HSQC spectra (Figure 10 and Figures S3 and S4)\nacquired at 25 \u00b0C revealed 17 G and 8 U imino peaks, corresponding\nto 15 GC pairs, 6 AU pairs, and 2 GU pairs. An additional AU and GU\npair was identified in a NOESY spectrum acquired at 15 \u00b0C (Figure S5). These data are consistent with seven\nimino proton walks (Figures 9 and 10 and Figures S3\u2013S5). The imino proton chemical shift data from this\nwork (Table S14) agree well with those\nreported by Ziegeler et al.10 Imino proton\nresonances not identified in this work that Ziegeler et al.10 assigned only in fragments of the full-length\nconstruct are for G1, G48, and U109. These resonances were likely\ndifficult to assign in the full-length construct because they exchange\nwith solvent protons in solvent-accessible environments: G1 and U109\nare located at the end of helices, and G48 is in a GA pair. Imino\nproton resonances that Ziegeler et al.10 did not assign in the full-length construct but were identified\nin this work are for G19, G30, G44, G49, G51, U79, U80, and G104 (Table S14). On the basis of the secondary structure\nshown in Figure 9,\nP2 and P4 were missing expected imino signals and the two pairs assigned\nto P4 could be observed only at a reduced temperature (15 \u00b0C)\nand a reduced mixing time (60 ms). These observations suggest that\nP2 and P4 may be unstable and/or\ndynamic. Constraints used for HAR1 are listed in Table 3.\n\nThe 75 nt B. mori R2 retrotransposon pseudoknot\n(Figure 11) has NMR spectra that agree well with\nthose of a 74 nt construct (Figure 11) originally\nused to identify the same pseudoknot. NOESY and 15N\u20131H HSQC spectra (Figures S6\u2013S9) acquired at 25 \u00b0C revealed imino resonances\ncorresponding\nto 20 GC pairs, 4 AU pairs, and 1 GU pair. These data provided six\nimino proton walks (Figure 11 and Figures S6\u2013S9). One\nwalk is new because G32 is able to pair with C75 in the 75-mer (Figure 11 and Figure S8). Unlike in the spectra of the 74 nt\nconstruct,39 an NOE from G13 to G27 was\nnot observed in the spectrum of the 75 nt construct, possibly because\nits sample concentration was lower than for the 74 nt construct. This\nreduced a previous walk of 5 bp to two separate walks of 3 and 2 bp.\nConstraints used for the 75-mer B. mori R2 pseudoknot\nare provided in Table S17. While not used\nas a constraint, an imino proton resonance at 12.31 ppm was assigned\nto G9 in the 75 nt construct, consistent with formation of an imino\nG9-A30 pair.\n\nThe NAPSS-CS algorithm\nwas tested on a total of 18 structures, nine of which contain pseudoknots\n(Figures 9 and 11 and Figure S10). NMR\nconstraints for these sequences are provided in Table 3 and Tables S16\u2013S32. The average sensitivity and PPV were calculated over all 18 structures.\nA one-tailed, paired t test was performed to test\nthe significance of the improvement in sensitivities\nand PPVs from constrained NAPSS-CS as compared to those from three\nother algorithms without restraints (Table 4). The null hypothesis (H0), stating that NAPSS-CS is not more accurate than an\nalternative program, was tested. Constrained NAPSS-CS was found to\nhave a sensitivity (p < 0.05) significantly higher\nthan those of Fold,20 ProbKnot,72 and ShapeKnots,38 and a PPV significantly higher than that of\nProbKnot (Table 4).\n\nFor structures with pseudoknots,\nthe sensitivity\nand PPV for pseudoknotted base pairs were calculated separately with eqs 2 and 3. Pseudoknotted base pairs are\nthose that form between single-stranded and loop bases and close the\nloop involved in formation of those base pairs (see Methods). Pseudoknotted base pairs were predicted considerably\nbetter with the constrained NAPSS-CS algorithm than with unrestrained\nprograms (Table 5).\nThe average pseudoknot sensitivity and PPV for NAPSS-CS are 95 and\n88%, respectively, compared to \u226433% for each of the other programs\nwhen unrestrained. Six of the nine sequences were predicted to be\npseudoknotted only by constrained NAPSS-CS.\n\nBoth SHAPE73 and NMR39 data are\nonly available for\nthe 74 nt B. mori R2 retrotransposon pseudoknot.\nWhen two strong and two moderate SHAPE hits73 were used as restraints with reactivities of 0.8 and 0.4, respectively,\nShapeKnots predicted a structure with 58% sensitivity and PPV for\nall base pairs, but with no pseudoknotted base pairs. In contrast,\nNAPSS-CS with only NMR constraints predicted a structure with a sensitivity\nand PPV of 83 and 91% of all base pairs (Table 4) and 79 and 85% of pseudoknotted base pairs\n(Table 5), respectively.\n\nAside from the 18 structures whose prediction accuracies are reported,\nNAPSS-CS failed to give results for two additional structures (Figure S11). The Kluyveromyces lactis telomerase RNA pseudoknot74 contains\na helical walk across a single base pair (C22-G36), which is not allowed\nby the dynamic programming algorithm. The MLV recording signal pseudoknot75 has a helical walk across coaxially stacked\npseudoknots, which is not supported by NAPSS-CS.39 Aside from the two structures, little evidence of walks\nacross these arrangements of base pairs exists in the literature.39 For that reason, NAPSS-CS is designed not to\nsupport these structures.\n\nHigh-throughput\nsequencing methods reveal many new RNAs with unknown\nstructure.76\u221280 Determination of secondary structure usually involves sequence comparison7,11\u221213 and/or a combination of chemical\nmapping and free energy minimization.20,36,38,81,82 Chemical mapping limits folding space by revealing nucleotides that\nare not in Watson-Crick base pairs. In contrast, NMR Assisted Prediction\nof Secondary Structure limits folding space by revealing nucleotides\nin canonical base pairs.39 The results\npresented here show that adding chemical shifts for imino, UH5, and\nAH2 protons can further reduce folding space by indicating the 5\u2032\nto 3\u2032 direction of base pairs in helices.\n\nPseudoknots\nare an important motif because they usually indicate\nfunctional significance. Pseudoknots, however, are particularly difficult\nto prove, partially because of the limited knowledge of the sequence\ndependence of thermodynamics.34,35 The results in Figure 12 and Table 5 show that constraints from\nNMR dramatically improve evidence for and predictions of pseudoknots.\nSimilar improvement has been shown for 13 sequences when ShapeKnots\nis restrained with SHAPE data.38\n\nAn NMR and biochemical study of\nan adenine riboswitch revealed\nthat temperature-independent function required two slowly exchanging\nsecondary structures when ligand was not bound.6In vivo chemical mapping of Arabidopsis\nthaliana seedlings suggests that stress-expressed RNAs may\nhave multiple structures.80 Even an RNA\nduplex of 22 nucleotides has been shown by NMR to have two slowly\nexchanging secondary structures.83,84 When secondary\nstructures are slowly exchanging so that imino cross-peaks are observed\nfor the different conformations, the NAPSS-CS algorithm may facilitate\ndetermination of individual secondary structures.\n\nCompared to\nproteins, relatively few 3D structures are known for\nRNA despite the importance of 3D structure for deducing structure\u2013function\nrelationships. In addition to providing base pairing information,\nNAPSS-CS provides assignments for many imino proton, UH5, and AH2\nresonances for bases in canonical base pairs. Assignment of UH5 also\nallows rapid assignment of UH6.60 These\nassignments then permit assignment of other nonexchangeable resonances\nand thus for many assignments required to determine 3D structure.\n\nThe approach presented here should become more important as the\nRNA database of NMR spectra, structures, and dynamics grows. For example,\nadditional patterns for chemical shifts and NOE connections may be\nfound and incorporated into the NAPSS-CS algorithm to improve accuracy.\nConversely, local environments may produce exceptions to the constraints\ncurrently used. A recent apparent exception is the U5 primer binding\nsite in Moloney MLV,85 where a 5\u2032RGY3\u2032\ntriplet is flanked by a GU pair on both sides. As more data become\navailable, NMR restraints rather than constraints could be used with\nchemical mapping data to further improve the overall prediction accuracy.38 The existing database for pseudoknots, however,\nis too small to train well the parameters required for an approach\nusing restraints.\n\nBecause RNAs are often difficult to crystallize\nand packing interactions\ncan affect structure,86 it is likely that\nNMR will continue to be an important method for determining RNA structure.\nThe approach can also be applied to other self-assembling polymers\nthat would generate NOESY walks and have known thermodynamics. This\nincludes DNA and a wide variety of nucleic acid mimics, many of which\ncannot be interrogated by all chemical mapping methods because backbones\nand/or base equivalents may not be natural.46\u221249"}
