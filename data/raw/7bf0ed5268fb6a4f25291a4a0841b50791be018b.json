{"title": "Novel Hepatitis E Virus in Ferrets, the Netherlands", "body": "www.cdcnc.gov/EID/pdfs/11-1659-Techapp.pdf). Total RNA extracted from 43 ferret fecal samples collected from 19 locations in the Netherlands was used to perform reverse transcription PCR amplifi cation. Using this PCR, we detected viral RNA in 4 (9.3%) fecal samples tested from 4 locations (distance between each sampling location ranged from 25 km to 127 km). All amplicons were confi rmed by nucleotide sequencing. We have limited information regarding the clinical disease this virus may cause because these samples were obtained from household pet ferrets that did not show overt clinical signs. In addition, 4/16 animals from a single farm were IgG positive when tested for IgG against HEV by using recombinant human HEV protein (Wantai, Beijing, China).\n\nTo characterize the complete genome of this virus, we selected 2 PCR-positive samples (FRHEV4 and FRHEV20), developed different sets of specifi c primers on the basis of sequence fragments obtained by 454 pyrosequencing, directly sequenced amplicons by Sanger sequencing, and used a rapid amplifi cation of cDNA ends PCR to obtain 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 frame end sequences. Using overlapping fragments we assembled 2 complete FRHEV genome sequences that contained 6,854 nt, including a 13nt 3\u2032 poly A tail and a 12-nt 5\u2032 end. FRHEV full-genome sequences FRHEV4 and FRHEV20 showed 98.6% sequence identity and were deposited into GenBank under accession nos. JN998606 and JN998607, respectively.\n\nThe FRHEV genome contains a complete ORF1 gene that encodes a nonstructural protein of 1,596 aa, an ORF2 gene that encodes a capsid protein of 654 aa, an ORF3 gene that encodes a phosphoprotein of 108 aa, and a 3\u2032 noncoding region of 78 nt. Sequence analyses indicated that the FRHEV genome shared the highest identity (72.3%) with rat HEV. Sequence identity with HEV genotypes 1-4 and rabbit and avian HEVs ranged from 54.5% to 60.5% (online Technical Appendix Table 2 ). The FRHEV genome organization Figure. Phylogenetic tree based on the complete genomic sequences of ferret hepatitis E viruses (HEVs) and human, rabbit, swine, avian, and rat HEV strains. Names of HEV strains follow GenBank accession numbers. Sequence alignment was performed by using ClustalW in the MEGA5.0 software package (www.megasoftware.net), and the trees were constructed by using the neighbor-joining method with p-distance (gap/missing data treatment; complete deletion) and 1,000 bootstrap replicates as in MEGA version 5.0. Scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. was found to be slightly different from other HEVs and included a putative ORF (ORF4) of 552 nt that overlapped with ORF1 (online Technical Appendix Figure) . A similar pattern of genome organization was observed for both FRHEVs.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes clearly showed that FRHEV was separated from genotype 1-4 HEVs and clustered with rat HEV (Figure) . Similar phylogenetic clustering was observed when nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3 were analyzed separately. The phylogenetic distance between rat HEV and FRHEV is larger than the distance between genotype 1 and genotype 2 HEV.\n\nIn recent years, an increasing number of sporadic cases of hepatitis E have been reported (1, 9) . Several observations suggest that autochthonous cases are caused by zoonotic spread of infection from wild or domestic animals (1, 3, 9) . In addition, IgG anti-HEV seropositivity in the United States has been associated with several factors, including having a pet at home (10) . Further studies are needed to identify the zoonotic potential of FRHEV. To the Editor: The increased severity of Clostridium diffi cile infection is primarily attributed to the appearance of an epidemic strain characterized as PCR ribotype 027 (1) . The only report that identifi ed epidemic C. diffi cile ribotype 027 in an American country outside of North America comes from Costa Rica, raising the possibility that strains 027 might also be present in other countries of Latin America (2) . Several studies between 2001 and 2009 have been conducted in South American countries to detect the incidence of C. diffi cile infection in hospitalized patients, but they did not identify which C. diffi cile strains were causing these infections (3) .\n\nDuring an epidemiologic screening of patients with C. diffi cile infection in a university hospital in Chile, we analyzed all stool samples of patients with suspected C. diffi cile infection during a 5-month period (June-November 2011). Two cases of C. diffi cile infection were associated with ribotype 027."}
