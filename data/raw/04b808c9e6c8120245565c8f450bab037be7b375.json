{"title": "", "body": "Approach to the diagnosis of gastrointestinat disease bowel. Even in the absence of perforation, microorganisms from the gut lumen may cause local abscessation and secondary septic peritonitis in which there is intermingling of suppuration, granulation tissue, and tumor cells. Based on studies carried out prior to revision of the nomenclature, tumors in cecum and colon, where gastrointestinal stromal tumors predominate, were determined to have a relatively high metastatic risk. They may metastasize to the mesenteric nodes, mesentery, and liver, but in general, these tumors have a more favorable prognosis after complete resection than other malignant neoplasms of the lower gastrointestinal tract.\n\nThe large intestinal tumors may also cause paraneoplastic hypoglycemia, due to the production of insulin-like growth factors, that may precipitate the search for a neoplasm. Production of erythropoietin, resulting in erythrocytosis, has also been documented.\n\nIn old horses, tumors of the intestine have been described that in many cases meet morphologic or immunohistochemical criteria for gastrointestinal stromal tumor, as it has been described above. Most are encountered incidentally, at surgery, meat inspection, or necropsy, but tumors of this type, or previously diagnosed as leiomyomas, may cause intermittent bouts of colic that become more frequent with time. They occur in the stomach, small intestine, and most frequently in the cecum and colon, as encapsulated, moderately firm, multinodular, pale tan, or hemorrhagic masses in the muscularis or subserosa, protruding on the serosal surface, or rarely, as somewhat pedunculated tumors projecting from the serosa or into the lumen. They may vary from 1 to > 10 cm in diameter, and are usually solitary, but occasionally may be multiple. Malignancy, if it occurs, must be rare; it is not described.\n\nThe diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease is facilitated by knowledge of the entities that may be expected in a particular species and age group, and the clinicopathologic syndromes with which they are associated. In the next section, etiologic entities associated with various syndromes in the domestic species are briefly summarized. The salient diagnostic features of some conditions, or the steps required at necropsy to confirm a diagnosis, are mentioned. The diseases causing gastritis, and those causing typhlocolitis in all species, have been discussed in previous sections. They are only briefly reiterated here in a general context. Further information on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of most infectious and parasitic conditions is found in the next section.\n\nDiarrhea causing dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte depletion is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal piglets, calves, lambs, and kids, and to a lesser extent in foals. Some classes of agents occur in most species of large animals, and mixed infections may occur; these include Escherichia coli, coronavirus, rotavirus, and Cryptosporidium. These, and some other less common agents, produce diarrhea in neonatal animals, the etiology of which cannot be readily differentiated on clinical grounds or on the basis of gross examination at necropsy.\n\nologic diagnosis if appropriate advice is to be rendered on prevention and management of the problem. Many of the agents involved are transiently present, or produce villus atrophy that is obscured by autolysis, hindering diagnosis. To overcome these obstacles, one or more live untreated animals in the early phase of clinical disease, and representative of the herd problem, must be examined. They should be killed and examined immediately using a necropsy procedure modified so that specimens of small intestine are fixed within a few minutes of death, and so that appropriate samples of tissue and content are quickly collected for etiologic investigation.\n\nThe presence of specific microscopic lesions, and their distribution in the intestine, may suggest an etiology. Culture or application of rapid immunologic methods to gut content and fixed or frozen tissues may identify a bacterial or viral agent. Cryptosporidium and coccidial agents may be identified in Giemsa-stained mucosal scrapings as well as in tissue sections. The prevalence of diarrhea in neonates, and the main agents associated, can be expected to vary considerably on the basis of locality, climate, and season, and the management system, as well as by species.\n\nIn all species, neonatal animals succumbing to the effects of undifferentiated diarrhea are overtly dehydrated.The eyes are sunken in the orbits, the skin lacks elasticity, and the subcutis is tacky. There is usually fecal staining on the perineum, but a rare acute case may dehydrate without significant diarrhea. Scouring animals may continue to suck during the early phase of their illness, a milk clot or curd may be present in the stomach, and internal fat depots may be adequate. Animals that lose interest in feed due to more chronic disease, and those taken off nutrients, may have serous atrophy of fat and appear cachectic. The small intestine is flaccid, dilated, and often thinwalled, and fluid content is present throughout the full length ( Fig.  1.83 ). The content is usually watery and clear green-yellow. It often separates into two phases, the more solid of which appears to consist of small masses of clotted milk or mucus. Sometimes the content is more homogeneous and creamy in texture. In animals examined some time after spontaneous death, this appearance is due to postmortem slough of epithelium. The large intestine similarly contains fluid, creamy or pasty content, usually white or yellow. The mucosa of the small intestine may appear glistening and mildly congested; that in the large intestine is usually unremarkable.The forestomachs in ruminants that have been tube-fed, or in which the reticular groove has apparently failed to close, may contain sour fermented milk or milk replacer and the mucosa may be mildly reddened.The abomasal mucosa of some calves may contain scattered focal stressassociated hemorrhages. In piglets, urates, precipitated as the result of dehydration, may be present in the renal medulla and pelvis.\n\nIn each species, undifferentiated diarrhea of neonates may be caused by other agents, in addition to the common bacterial, viral, and protozoal causes cited above. Conditions distinguishable at necropsy from undifferentiated diarrhea, and caused by a further array of pathogens, are also found in most species.The spectrum of agents associated with diarrhea in neonates of each species will be considered below.\n\nAbout 10 infectious agents have been associated with undifferentiated diarrhea in calves under about 3 weeks of age, and a further four or five syndromes associated with diarrhea in neonates can often be recognized at necropsy. Frequently, combinations of several of these agents occur together, or in sequence. The consequences of combined infections experimentally often appear to be more severe than infections with individual agents.The diagnosis of these infectious problems in a herd can be complex, and examination of more than one animal early in the course of disease is desirable. Noninfectious diarrhea and emaciation, resulting from the use of nutritionally inadequate milk replacers containing heat-denatured protein, must also be considered and eliminated when examining artificially reared animals.\n\nEnterotoxigenic E. coli is probably the most common single cause of undifferentiated neonatal diarrhea in calves. Little or no overt morphologic change may be evident in tissue section, though bacteria are seen attached to the surface of enterocytes on villi. The disease usually occurs within the first week of life, and is confirmed by specific immunofluorescent techniques in smears and frozen sections, or by culture and characterization of the organism as enterotoxinproducing. Enterotoxigenic colibacillosis is distinct from the lesscommon enteropathogenic colibacillosis, caused by attachingeffacing organisms, and from septicemic colibacillosis and other gram-negative infections occurring in hypogammaglobulinemic neonates. Occasional cases of enterohemorrhagic colibacillosis, caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli and producing fibrinohemorrhagic enterocolitis, occur in calves, usually in the second week of life.\n\nBovine coronavirus and Rotavirus are responsible for a significant proportion of neonatal calf diarrhea, alone, together, or in combination with other agents. Disease due to these viruses may begin at any time in the first 1 or 2 weeks of life. Both produce villus atrophy by causing lysis or exfoliation of surface enterocytes. Bovine coronavirus also commonly causes microscopic, and occasionally gross, lesions in the colon. Both agents may be confirmed by demonstration of virus in feces, or viral antigen in infected epithelium.\n\nCryptosporidium, a minute apicomplexan protist, is commonly associated with undifferentiated diarrhea and villus atrophy in calves. It is most common in animals about 4-20 days of age. Cryptosporidia are recognized in the brush border of epithelium on villi, and in mucosal smears and fecal smears or flotations.\n\nGiardia, a flagellate protist, has been implicated as an etiologic agent in diarrhea of calves and other young ruminants, but giardiosis is infrequently diagnosed in this context.\n\nCoronaviridae, has been recovered from diarrheic calves; though antibody is common in some surveys, disease seems rare.The pathogenesis and lesions caused by the Breda agent are similar to other coronavirus infections, though some crypt cell necrosis is reported in the small intestine.\n\nAstrovirus infections usually appear to be subclinical, and their implication as a cause of diarrhea in calves is rare.Astrovirus infects enterocytes on the villus surface, causing lysis or exfoliation of cells, and transient villus atrophy. Several noroviruses (family Caliciviridae, genus Norovirus; formerly \"Norwalk-like viruses\"), or bovine enteric caliciviruses (BEC), have been identified from the feces of diarrheic calves, including norovirus Jena, Newbury agents 1 and 2, and the Nebraska BEC.\n\nEnteroviruses are commonly isolated from the feces of clinically normal animals, and they are likely not associated with significant disease, though diarrhea has occurred in some experimental studies. Birnavirus has also been isolated from the feces of diarrheic calves, but with no proof of pathogenicity.\n\nA bovine enteric syncytial virus, a group B rotavirus, was identified as a cause of diarrhea in calves in a beef herd. Experimentally, it causes diarrhea, and distinctive syncytia formed by enterocytes on the sides of villi are present in tissue sections of the small intestine.\n\nBovine parvovirus infects cells in crypts of Lieberkfihn in the small and large bowel, and may cause mild to moderate diarrhea, particularly in the postweaning period. Mild necrosis and exfoliation of cells in crypts may occur in the small intestine, with some villus atrophy and fusion.\n\nBovine viral diarrhea virus can be implicated in enteritis of calves as young as a week or so of age, on the basis of microscopic lesions in the small intestine and colon similar to those found in older animals, and by virus isolation, or antigen or genome identification.\n\nChlamydophila infection is very rarely recognized in association with enteritis. It may be acutely necrotizing and exudative microscopically. Strongyloides infection may also cause villus atrophy and diarrhea in calves as young as 2-3 weeks of age. Enterotoxigenic Bacillus fragilis has been suggested as a cause of diarrhea in neonatal calves, but its role is unproven.\n\nA number of other syndromes are usually distinguishable on the basis of gross lesions at necropsy in diarrheic calves. Clostridium perfringens types B and C are usually associated with acute hemorrhagic enteritis and dysentery; infection with these organisms is rare.\n\nSalmonellosis, usually due to Salmonella Typhimurium, or perhaps S. Dublin or S. Muenster in enzootic areas, occurs in calves as young as 4 or 5 days of age. It is especially common in stressed calves weaned to milk replacer and moving through sales barns as vealers. Salmonellosis may mimic undifferentiated neonatal diarrhea, perhaps in association with rotavirus, coronavirus, or Cryptosporidium. Or it may cause acute fibrinous enterocolitis, with septicemia in a proportion of cases.\n\ncalves under 2 weeks of age may produce gastrointestinal lesions associated with generalized infection; more commonly the enteric lesions occur alone or dominate the picture. Characteristic foci of necrosis in the mucosa of the forestomachs, perhaps associated with focal ulceration of the abomasum and crypts of Lieberkfihn, are the typical findings.\n\nMycotic rumenitis and abomasitis are complications secondary to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis in calves, or possibly following abomasal venous infarction in salmonellosis.\n\nUndifferentiated diarrhea in neonatal lambs is mainly associated with enterotoxigenic E. coli, Rotavirus and Cryptosporidium; Giardia may contribute, but its significance is poorly defined. Astrovirus has been found in lambs and experimentally produces diarrhea.An adenovirus antigenicaUy related to Ovine adenovims-2 is reported as a cause of enteritis in goat kids. Salmonenosis may occur rarely in young lambs. Septicemia is more commonly associated with certain serotypes of E. coli, which may be the cause of\"watery mouth\" in lambs. Bacteroidesfragilis, producing enterotoxin, has been implicated as a cause of diarrhea in neonatal lambs. Causes of undifferentiated diarrhea in young goats are poorly defined, but the problem appears to be minor under usual conditions of husbandry. A similar spectrum of agents may be expected and sought. Lamb dysentery, due to Clostridium pe~ingens type B in lambs and kids under 8-10 days of age is usually recognized at necropsy as severe hemorrhagic enteritis, occasionally with necrotic ulcers.\n\nCoccidiosis due to Eimeria spp. in lambs and in kids may occur in animals as young as 3 weeks of age. Raised white plaques or polypoid masses of infected epithelium are found in the terminal ileum, perhaps associated with hemorrhage.\n\nStrongyloides may also be associated with diarrhea in ruminants only a few weeks old.\n\nThe agents commonly implicated in undifferentiated diarrhea in piglets under 3 weeks of age are enterotoxigenic E. coil, coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis), Rotavirus, and Isospora suis.\n\nEnterotoxigenic colibacillosis typically occurs in piglets under a week of age, and causes no specific gross or microscopic lesions, other than organisms adherent to the brush border of enterocytes. Rotavirus and Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV, coronavirus) infections cause villus atrophy, in contrast to most types of E. coli. Isospora suis tends to occur in piglets over 5-6 days of age. It is associated with villus atrophy, and in a minority of cases, necrotic enteritis in the distal small intestine. Meronts or gamonts may be found in mucosal smears, and in epithelium on atrophic villi in section.\n\nA Bacteroides fragilis is also rarely associated with diarrhea. None of these bacterial infections are common in piglets. Strongyloides ransomi, transmitted in the milk, may infect young piglets, causing villus atrophy, malabsorption, protein loss, and diarrhea.\n\nHemorrhagic and necrotizing enteritis due to Clostridium perfringens type C in piglets in the first week of life is readily recognized at necropsy. C. diflicile also causes diarrheal disease in piglets in this age group, with a distinct suite of gross and microscopic lesions.\n\nIn the young foal, undifferentiated diarrhea may be associated with Rotavirus, Cryptosporidium, and Strongyloides. Enterotoxigenic E. coli and coronaviruses are not proven pathogens in foals. Actinobacillus equuli may cause severe diarrhea and hemorrhagic enteritis, with lesions of bacteremia evident in other organs at necropsy. Salmonellosis in foals may be seen as fatal diarrhea with few gross lesions, or as fibrinous enterocolitis and septicemia, similar to that seen in older horses. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with occasional gram-positive infections, are common causes of neonatal septicemia, predisposed by failure of passive transfer of immunoglobulin. Fibrinonecrotic enterocolitis in foals under a week of age may be due to Clostridium pe~ringens type B or C, or C. dijllcile. Rhodococcus equi may cause chronic diarrhea and wasting in foals. Pyogranulomatous ulcerative lesions of the large bowel, and purulent mesenteric lymphadenitis, often associated with chronic purulent bronchopneumonia, are characteristically found in R. equi infection. Enterococcus (Streptococcus) durans, an enteroadherent coccus, has been associated with diarrhea in foals. Moderate atrophy of villi covered with adherent gram-positive cocci is characteristic; the large bowel is not colonized. Strongyloides westeri is capable of causing diarrhea in young foals occasionally. Tyzzer's disease, which is restricted to foals under about 6 weeks of age, may be associated with diarrhea. However, the liver lesion dominates the pathologic picture. Enteritis is often not grossly recognized in the small bowel at necropsy of animals with intestinal helminthosis. The pathologist needs, therefore, to have a high index of suspicion to come to a diagnosis in some cases. To make a firm diagnosis of intestinal helminthosis it is necessary to demonstrate substantial populations of nematodes by worm count in intestinal content or digests, and ideally to observe villus atrophy in tissue sections of infected intestine. These findings should be associated with a compatible syndromein the case of Ostertagia, Strongyloides, and the intestinal trichostrongyles, inefficient weight gain or wasting, and usually diarrhea. The hematophagous genera Haemonchus and Bunostomum cause anemia and hypoproteinemia, and associated poor growth but without diarrhea. Oesophagostomum radiatum, in the colon, may result in anemia, hypoproteinemia, and diarrhea as well as causing nodule formation in the gut wall. Trichuris may also cause occasional significant hemorrhagic typhlitis, wasting, and diarrhea.\n\nSubacute-to-chronic diarrhea and poor growth or emaciation in cattle may also be due to copper deficiency, chronic bovine viral diarrhea, salmonellosis, yersiniosis, chronic coccidiosis, and, in cattle over about 2 years of age, Johne's disease (paratuberculosis). Congestive heart failure and other causes of portal hypertension may also cause chronic diarrhea in individual animals. \n\nThe major causes of diarrhea and ill-thrift in sheep and goats at pasture are parasitic. The main helminth species causing this syndrome are Ostertagia, Nematodirus, and Trichostrongylus.The genera and species involved vary with the geographic area and climate, and perhaps seasonally, as well as with the age group and other local epizootiologic factors. Larval paramphistomes will also cause enteritis in lambs in enzootic areas. Strongyloides may affect lambs up to several months of age, even those held in confinement.Where it occurs, Nematodirus is usually a disease of lambs 1-3 months of age. Trichostrongylosis usually affects lambs 3 months to yearling age. Oesophagostomum columbianum may cause significant disease in sheep, as well as causing nodule formation in the intestinal submucosa. Trichuris typhlitis is an uncommon problem in sheep, as is Chabertia infection of the colon. Bunostomum and especially Haemonchus cause marked anemia and hypoproteinemia without diarrhea. Hemonchosis is a particular problem in lambs and kids at pasture or held in semiconfinement in warm humid climates. It is also important in ewes and does during the postparturient period, or spring, when retarded larvae emerge synchronously from the abomasal mucosa, and mature.\n\nCoccidiosis is a problem mainly in lambs and kids reared in confinement, on feedlot or heavily stocked on pasture.Villus atrophy due to mixed-species infections may be responsible for illthrift and diarrhea in older animals, while Eimeria arloingi and E. christenseni or E. ovina and E. ahsata may be responsible for mortality in very young kids and lambs respectively.\n\nAcute enterocolitis and septicemia due to Salmonella Arizonae infection may occur in lambs and sheep. Yersiniosis causes fibrinous enterocolitis and caseous mesenteric lymphadenitis. Grain overload may cause acute diarrhea in feedlot lambs and in sheep offered supplemental feed. Diarrhea may also be associated with C.\n\npe~ringens type D enterotoxemia in sheep and goats, though animals may die very acutely. Where it occurs, Peste-des-petitsruminants virus causes acute severe enteritis with upper alimentary lesions in sheep and goats.\n\nJohne's disease causes a syndrome of wasting, usually without diarrhea, in sheep and goats; in goats, caseous mesenteric lymphadenitis may occur. Schistosomiasis may cause ill-thrift in sheep in enzootic areas. Terminal (regional) ileitis of lambs is a syndrome characterized by reduced weight gain, diarrhea, and apparent abdominal pain, usually in 1-4 month-old animals. It is reported from the UK, continental Europe, and North America. At necropsy, animals are typically in poor body condition, with evidence of diarrhea. There is marked enlargement of the caudal small intestinal mesenteric lymph node. The terminal small intestine is thickened, with transmural edema, and a corrugated appearance on the serosal aspect. The mucosa is reddened, and thrown into thick transverse nodular folds. There may be superficial erosion and fibrin exudation.The mucosa of the cecum and spiral colon may also be grossly thickened.\n\nMicroscopic lesions are always evident in the ileum, decreasing in frequency and severity with distance cranial and caudal to the ileocecal orifice. In the small intestine, there is moderate to subtotal villus atrophy, associated with hypertrophy of crypts, hyperplasia of crypt epithelium, and a hea W mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate in the lamina propria. Microerosions or ulcers may be present, through which neutrophils exude. In the large intestine, the crypt epithelium is hyperplastic, causing thickening of the mucosa, which is infiltrated by a mixed, mainly mononuclear, inflammatory cell population, and is thrown into folds superficially. Peyer's patches and submucosal lymphoid aggregates are hypertrophic, with lymphoid hyperplasia.\n\nThe lesion is compatible with a chronic immunoinflammatory response in the bowel, and it may be due to Border disease virus. \n\nRotavirus and Transmissible gastroenteritis virus may be responsible for villus atrophy and diarrhea in susceptible pigs of any age, though significant mortality is generally restricted to neonates and nursing pigs. Considerable morbidity but low mortality occur in the later suckling, weanling, and feeder age groups. Postweaning diarrhea is associated with villus atrophy of uncertain etiology; it is discussed with villus atrophy in the section on epithelial renewal in health and disease, above. Escherichia coli causes postweaning enterocolitis, and Shiga toxin-producing strains of E. coli produce \"gut edema,\" causing sudden death or nervous signs in weaner and feeder pigs. No mucosal lesions are evident, but edema of the gastric submucosa and mesocolon may be found, among other lesions.\n\nEnterocolitis due to Salmonella, Lawsonia intracellularis infection, swine dysentery, and intestinal spirochetosis generally occur in weaner and feeder swine, though proliferative hemorrhagic enteropathy, swine dysentery, and intestinal spirochetosis occasionally involve suckling animals older than about 3 weeks of age. The differential diagnosis of these conditions and trichuriasis has been discussed previously in the section on typhlocolitis in swine.\n\nCoccidiosis, other than that in neonates due to Isospora suis, is rare in swine. Occasional ileitis or, less commonly, typhlitis is caused by infection with several species of Eimeria. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) has been associated with watery diarrhea and weight loss, often accompanied by pneumonia, in weaned pigs. Grossly, the mucosa of the distal small intestine and colon is thickened. Microscopically, a prominent lymphoplasmacytic/histiocytic infiltrate is evident in the lamina propria and submucosa. There is lymphocytolysis and atrophy of follicles in gut-associated lymphoid tissue, and irregular basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of PCV2 infection are evident in macrophages in lamina propria and lymphoid tissue. Immunohistochemical staining for circoviral antigen stains these inclusions, which are presumably phagocytosed viral inclusions from lyricinfected lymphocytes. Similar inclusions are evident in bronchiolar epithelium and alveolar macrophages in lungs affected with bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Other lesions characteristic of PCV2 infection, including lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, and interstitial nephritis, are also present.\n\nHemorrhage into the intestine may occur in proliferative hemorrhagic enteropathy and mesenteric torsion, and should be differentiated from the melenic content found in animals with esophagogastric ulcer.\n\nAscaris suum may contribute to diarrhea and ill-thrift in weaner and feeder pigs. The thorny-headed worm Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus may, under rare circumstances, cause ill-thrift or intestinal perforation. Submucosal nodules in the intestinal wall may be caused by Oesophagostomum infections, which are otherwise usually relatively inconsequential in swine. Thin-sow syndrome has been attributed to gastric hyostrongylosis.\n\nMost of the significant gastrointestinal diseases of horses are discussed elsewhere, including salmonellosis, Lawsonia-associated proliferative enteropathy, clostridial colitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Potomac horse fever, granulomatous enteritis, and parasitism.The reader should consult portions of the chapter dealing with displacements, obstruction, ischemic disease of the bowel, syndromes associated with malassimilation and protein-losing enteropathy, and typhlocolitis, for discussions putting these conditions into a diagnostic context. The capacity of the equine large intestine probably compensates for the additional fluid load posed by diseases of the small intestine that in other species might be expected to produce diarrhea. Horses presented with a syndrome reflecting hypoproteinemia, usually without diarrhea, may have Lawsonia infection, chronic salmonellosis, chronic inflammatory bowel disease or granulomatous enteritis, or enteric lymphosarcoma.\n\n\"Proximal enteritis,\" also known as ulcerative duodenitis, is characterized by signs of upper small intestinal ileus, including depression and nasogastric reflux. There is debate about including ulcerative duodenitis of foals, associated with gastric ulcers, in the syndrome. We do so here, on the grounds of similar lesions in advanced cases.\n\nAt surgery or necropsy, there is fibrinous enteritis or ulceration involving the duodenum, and a variable amount of more distal small bowel. The lesions may be segmental and circumferential, only a few centimeters long, or more diffuse, involving much of the small intestine, but sparing the ileum. The affected segment of bowel may be thickened, congested, or hemorrhagic on the serosal aspect, and there may be fibrinous peritonitis with adhesions, and pancreatitis. Perforation may occur. If the lesion is of some standing, there may be significant stricture at the site. Affected animals often have a distended stomach, with abnormally fluid content, and gastric ulcers, particularly of the pars esophagea. Perforation or rupture of the stomach may occur. Duodenal lesions should always be sought in foals with gastroesophageal ulceration.\n\nMicroscopically, there is edema and congestion, with progressive necrosis from the tips of villi in early lesions, advancing to mucosal or transmural acute fibrinonecrotic enteritis, grading to the development of granulation tissue and fibrosis in the bed of more chronic ulcerative lesions.\n\nThe etiology is undetermined. Clostridia, Salmonella, mycotoxicosis, and ischemia associated with the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents have been proposed, but not firmly implicated. The segmental, often circumferential, nature of the lesions is compatible with ischemia, perhaps complicated by secondary bacteria.\n\nFibrinous enteritis in the small bowel may also occur in blister beetle intoxication. Enterocolitis associated with use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is discussed in the section Intestinal ischemia and infarction. Vet Hum Toxico[ 1995; 37:39-45. White NA, et at. Hemorrhagic fibrinonecrotic duodenitis-proximat jejunitis in horses: 20 cases (1977 -1984 ). J Am Vet Med Assoc 1987 190:311-316. \n\nRotavirus and Canine coronavirus infection appear to be causes of uncommon, generally nonfatal, diarrhea in young dogs.A variety of other viral agents have been associated with diarrhea in dogs, usually on the basis of electron microscopic observations or virus isolation from feces. These include astroviruses, adenovirus, and paramyxovirus, as well as calicivirus and herpesvirus antigenically related to Feline calicivirus and Feline herpesvirus. The pathogenic significance of these agents is unclear.\n\nCanine parvovirus 2 is by far the most significant cause of gastroenteritis in the dog. It is distinguished by the severe fibrinohemorrhagic enteritis usually evident at necropsy, and the radiomimetic microscopic lesions in the gastrointestinal mucosa, lymphoid, and hemopoietic tissues. Dogs with canine distemper often develop diarrhea; Canine distemper virus apparently does infect the intestinal cryptal epithelium. However, the enteric lesions of canine distemper have not been well described.\n\nSalmonella infection is common, but salmonellosis and enteritis due to other gram-negative bacteria such as Yersinia is rare in dogs.\n\nProliferative enteritis associated with intracellular bacteria is discussed under Lawsonia. Enterococcus durans has been associated with diarrhea in dogs. \"Salmon poisoning\" in the Pacific Northwest of the USA is due to rickettsial infection transmitted by the fluke Nanophyetus.\n\nHemorrhagic enteritis is associated with clostridial overgrowth, and may also be due to reduced perfusion, and coagulation defects, which may be congenital, part of disseminated intravascular coagulation, or due to anticoagulant rodenticide intoxication. Castor beans (Ricinus communis) contain ricin, a glycoprotein known to cause gastroenteritis, vomiting, diarrhea, and occasionally death.\n\nAscarid infection in puppies may be associated with ill-thrift, diarrhea, and, in heavy infestations, occasionally with death.\n\nHookworms may cause anemia, hypoproteinemia, and ill-thrift, or, in neonatal puppies, occasional acutely fatal infection. Isospora infection may cause diarrhea in puppies, and occasional mortality.\n\nGiardiasis is associated with chronic diarrhea in some dogs.\n\nSyndromes of malabsorption and protein loss associated with granulomatous or eosinophilic enteritis,\"filled villi,\" and lymphangiectasia have been discussed elsewhere. The differential diagnosis of colitis, including idiopathic colitis, parasitic colitis, protothecosis and histoplasmosis, Campylobacter, and spirochetal colitis, has been discussed previously in the section on typhlocolitis in dogs. Ulcerating or widely infiltrating colonic neoplasms may be associated with diarrhea.\n\nInfectious and parasitic diseases of the alimentary tract syndrome of cryptal necrosis in the intestine, resembling panleukopenia, but without lymphoid or bone marrow depletion. Astrovirus, enteric coronavirus, calieivirus, rotavirus, and other viruses are reported from the feces of cats, but are only rarely associated with diarrhea, and even less frequently associated with mortality. A torovirus has a questionable association with a syndrome of diarrhea and bilateral protrusion of the nictitating membrane. Diarrhea is a common sign in cats with Feline immunodeficiency virus infection, and may occur in cats with Feline leukemia virus infection.\n\nBacterial infections such as salmonellosis, shigellosis, yersiniosis, helicobacteriosis, and Tyzzer's disease are unusual, as is significant parasitic enteritis due to helminths, Cystoisospora, Toxoplasma, Giardia, or Cryptosporidium. Chronic inflammatory small-bowel disease and the forms of colitis occasionally encountered in cats have been considered in previous sections.\n\nFoot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral infection of all cloven-hoofed animals. It is a problem of worldwide concern, being enzootic in large areas of Africa, Asia, and parts of Europe and South America. Presence of the virus imposes serious trade restrictions that effectively thwart the development of a healthy agricultural economy.\n\nFMD is an acute febrile condition characterized by the formation of vesicles in and around the mouth, on the feet, teats, and mammary glands. The disease is not notable for high mortality, except in sucklings, but morbidity is very high, with a concomitant loss of productive efficiency.\n\nFMD virus (FMDV) belongs to the genus Aphthovirus (aphtha = ulcer) in the Picornaviridae family.The virus is highly resistant under many circumstances, but is inactivated by direct sunlight, due to drying and increase in temperature, and by moderate acidity (pH < 5.0). The acid production that accompanies rigor mortis in carcasses and meat inactivates the virus. However, the alteration in pH is not dependable and the virus survives in offal, viscera, lymph nodes, and bone marrow for an indefinite period under refrigeration. Next to the movement of infected animals, contaminated animal products are likely the most common mechanism of spread. It may survive on hay and other fomites for several weeks.\n\nThe resistance of FMDV is of epidemiological significance, especially where control policies involve slaughter rather than vaccination. The importance of a carrier state in the epidemiology of FMD is uncertain. The carrier state has been observed in cattle, sheep, goats, and African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), but not in pigs. The carrier state may persist for up to 2 years postinfection in cattle, even in animals with a significant level of serum-neutralizing antibody. Sheep and goats are considered to be a frequent inapparent source of dissemination of the virus.African buffalo can carry FMDV for at least 5 years. Field outbreaks have been associated with buffalo-cattle contact in Africa, but these appear to be rare. Although Asian water buffaloes (Bubalus arnee) may be affected in FMD outbreaks, it is not known whether they remain carriers.\n\nOf equal importance to the persistence of the virus is its antigenic heterogeneity and instability. There are seven principal antigenic serotypes, namely, the classical A, O, and C types, and SAT-l, SAT-2, SAT-3, and Asia-1. These can be distinguished by serologic tests. Six of the seven serotypes (O,A, C, SAT-l, SAT-2, SAT-3) are known to occur in Africa, four (O,A, C, Asia 1) in Asia, and three (O,A, C) in Europe and South America, although recent pandemics are blurring these geographic distinctions. These serotypes are sufficiently different immunologically that infection with one type does not confer resistance to the other six. Within these seven major types there are antigenic subtypes, each different, to variable degrees, from the parent type. Generally, the subtypes cross-immunize to a useful degree, but exceptions do arise and become recognizable, especially when vaccination fails. Antigenic drift can also be demonstrated experimentally; new subtypes can be produced by passing the virus in immune or partially immune animals, or by growing the virus in vitro in the presence of immune serum.There are presently over 70 distinct antigenic strains of the virus of natural origin.\n\nAs well as differences and variability in antigenic characters, strains of the virus differ in virulence, and a given strain is probably able to vary in virulence. Certainly, comparing different outbreaks, there is considerable variation in the severity of the disease produced in a given host species.Virulence also varies among species. Although the vast majority of strains will affect a wide range of species, there have been occasional viruses that show a distinct predilection for one species.An example is the porcinophilic strain that originated in China in the late 1990s and spread to Taiwan, destroying the swine industry there.\n\nThe main portal of entry and primary site of viral multiplication are the pharynx and lung. Subsequent to the first round of replication, there is widespread viremic dissemination to surface epithelium, with subsequent development of lesions in sites of mechanical or physiologic stress, such as oral and pedal epithelium, or teats in lactating animals. FMDV probably gains entry to these areas via Langerhans cells, with replication in a contiguous group of cells in the stratum spinosum. The resulting cellular degeneration and lysis result in an epidermal vesicle, which is the hallmark of the disease."}
