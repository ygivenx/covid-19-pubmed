{"title": "", "body": "However, in hyperinflammation, immunosuppression is likely to be beneficial. Re-analysis of data from a phase 3 randomised controlled trial of IL-1 blockade (anakinra) in sepsis, showed significant survival benefit in patients with hyperinflammation, without increased adverse events. 8 A multicentre, randomised con trolled trial of tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blockade, licensed for cytokine release syndrome), has been approved in patients with\n\nAs of March 12, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been con firmed in 125 048 people worldwide, carrying a mortality of approximately 3\u00b77%, 1 compared with a mortality rate of less than 1% from influenza. There is an urgent need for effective treatment. Current focus has been on the development of novel therapeutics, including antivirals and vaccines. Accumulating evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 might have a cytokine storm syndrome. We recommend identification and treatment of hyperinflammation using existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles to address the immediate need to reduce the rising mortality.\n\nCurrent management of COVID-19 is supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality. 2 Secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is an under-recognised, hyperinflammatory syndrome characterised by a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinaemia with multiorgan failure. In adults, sHLH is most commonly triggered by viral infections 3 and occurs in 3\u00b77-4\u00b73% of sepsis cases. 4 Cardinal features of sHLH include unremitting fever, cytopenias, and hyperferritinaemia; pulmonary involvement (including ARDS) occurs in approximately 50% of patients. 5 A cytokine profile resembling sHLH is associated with COVID-19 disease severity, characterised by increased interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, granulocytecolony stimulating factor, interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1, and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1. 6 Predictors of fatality from a recent retrospective, multicentre study of 150 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China, included elevated ferritin (mean 1297\u00b76 ng/ml in nonsurvivors vs 614\u00b70 ng/ml in survivors; p<0\u00b7001) and IL-6 (p<0\u00b70001), 2 suggesting that mortality might be due to virally driven hyperinflammation.\n\nAs during previous pandemics (severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome), corticosteroids are not routinely recommended and might exacerbate COVID-19-associated lung injury. 7 The Hscore 11 generates a probability for the presence of secondary HLH. HScores greater than 169 are 93% sensitive and 86% specific for HLH. Note that bone marrow haemophagocytosis is not mandatory for a diagnosis of HLH. HScores can be calculated using an online HScore calculator. 11 HLH=haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. *Defined as either haemoglobin concentration of 9\u00b72 g/dL or less (\u22645\u00b771 mmol/L), a white blood cell count of 5000 white blood cells per mm\u00b3 or less, or platelet count of 110 000 platelets per mm\u00b3 or less, or all of these criteria combined. \u2020HIV positive or receiving long-term immunosuppressive therapy (ie, glucocorticoids, cyclosporine, azathioprine).\n\nCOVID-19 pneumonia and elevated IL-6 in China (ChiCTR2000029765). 9 Janus kinase (JAK) inhibition could affect both inflammation and cellular viral entry in COVID-19. 10 All patients with severe COVID-19 should be screened for hyperinflammation using laboratory trends (eg, increasing ferritin, decreasing platelet counts, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and the HScore 11 (table) to identify the subgroup of patients for whom immunosuppression could improve mortality. Therapeutic options include steroids, intravenous immuno globulin, selective cytokine blockade (eg, anakinra or tocilizumab) and JAK inhibition.\n\nPM is a clinical training fellow within the Experimental Medicine Initiative to Explore New Therapies network and receives project funding unrelated to this Correspondence.
