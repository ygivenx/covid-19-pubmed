{"title": "", "body": "The Wallinga and Teunis method (1) estimates R e by calculating the relative likelihood that a case i gets infected from another case j given their difference in time, t, of symptoms onset t i \uf02dt j , and assuming a probability density function (pdf) of the generation interval. The generation (or serial) interval is defined as the time between onset of symptoms for a primary case and the onset of symptoms of its secondary case (2) . The relative likelihood p ij that a case j infects a case i, is defined as the probability that case j infects case i, divided by the likelihood that case i had been infected from any other case k (1):\n\nThe effective reproduction number R j for case j is calculated by summing over all cases i infected:\n\n, Equation 2\n\nThe Wallinga and Teunis likelihood estimation procedure was extended to account for spatial distance between affected farms, so that the likelihood that farm j infected farm i depended on the time difference between onset of symptoms between the two farms j and i, and also on their separating distances |d i -d j |.\n\nSince no independent dataset, that is, from another epidemic in another country was available to estimate a generation interval for RVF at the farm level, and in 2 dimensions . Since no information on spatial vaccine sales was available, VC was estimated under three scenarios A, B, and C, described as follows.\n\nScenario A assumed that vaccination coverage was applied throughout South Africa,\n\nproportionally to livestock population. Scenario B assumed that the number of vaccines used in a province over a specific period of time was proportional to the number of cases reported in that province over that same period of time. Scenario C assumed that all vaccines were used in the Free State province only, during Periods 2 and 3; and that no vaccine had been used before the epidemic (Period 1). Therefore, it allowed estimating the maximum coverage for that province, which was the first and most affected one, and also the one in which the government applied vaccination first (5 "}
