{"title": "Cytokine storms in infectious diseases", "body": "Elevated cytokine and chemokine production has been continuously associated with poor clinical outcome and pathogenesis during respiratory viral infections in humans and animal models [8\u201310]. Perlman and Thomas et al. review in detail the role various cytokines, chemokines and innate immune cells play in promoting pathology or protection during two clinically important respiratory viruses: coronaviruses (CoV) and influenza viruses, respectively [11, 12]. Specifically, Channappanavar and Perlman highlight how pathogenic CoV antagonize early type 1 interferon signaling which promotes rapid virus replication, setting the stage for an exacerbated secondary inflammatory environment marked by elevated cytokines/chemokines and accumulation of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils in the infected lung [11]. Moreover, Guo and Thomas emphasize the emerging roles of type 2 cytokines such as amphiregulin in dampening inflammation and promoting tissue repair [12]. Both reviews discuss the current experimental anti-inflammatory strategies being tested in vivo in animal models including Sphingosine 1 phosphate modulators, COX inhibitors, PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) agonists and modulation of production/signaling of oxidized phospholipids, and their potential as future therapeutic options to ameliorate cytokine storm pathology during respiratory viral infection.\n\nThe recent deadly outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa which killed over 11,000 people sparked fear into millions of people in the USA when the virus made its way to America. While Ebola virus pathology is the result of multiple factors, excessive inflammatory responses are a significant feature following infection. Probably the most notable symptom is hemorrhage which can occur at varying degrees of severity following Ebola virus infection. The aberrant inflammatory response that accompanies Ebola virus infection, termed viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), can be caused by multiple RNA viruses, including arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, filoviruses, and flaviviruses. Basler reviews the linkages between excessive inflammatory responses, hemorrhage and disseminated intravascular coagulation in the pathological manifestation of VHF in humans and non-human primates [13]. The review highlights potential sources of inflammatory cytokines during multiple VHF infections and points out that while dendritic cells are targets of viral replication by multiple VHF viruses, these cells secrete minimal amounts of cytokines/chemokines while monocytes and macrophages appear to be significant sources of inflammatory cytokines during these infections. The author highlights that the most relevant cell types and signaling pathways responsible for disease pathology in vivo have yet to be determined and understanding how the cytokine storm progresses in vivo will likely yield optimal therapeutics to subdue pathology associated with these infections.\n\nDengue virus infection and disease is endemic to the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the globe, largely due to the vector borne nature of its infection cycle where primary mosquito infection is necessary for transmission to humans. However, the recent warming of the globe has begun to push mosquitos that transmit dengue further north, making parts of the USA and southern European nations more likely to experience dengue infection. Although severe dengue infection occurs in a minority of patients, the accompanying dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is characterized by increased vascular permeability, hemorrhage, and organ failure. In this series, Rothman and colleagues review how both innate and adaptive immune responses contribute to promoting the severe manifestation of DHF [14]. The authors also review specific key cytokines and chemokines, namely TNF-\u03b1, vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF-A), IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, CCL2, and CXCL10, and how their production promotes clinical presentation of DHF. However, the authors point out that efficacious therapies for DHF will likely require targeting proteins that suppress multiple inflammatory pathways in humans. Thus, due to the absence of good animal models, there is an urgent need for well-designed patient studies coupled to competent bioinformatic analysis to identify reliable factors and pathways that promote DHF pathology.\n\nCurrent research is illuminating the cellular and molecular contributors of cytokine storm in multiple disease states. Based on recent developments in the field, new therapies will likely move away from targeting single soluble mediators and focus more generally on inflammatory cascades. However, what signaling cascades are targeted will depend both on the infection as well as the targeted patient population. Current experimental anti-inflammatory strategies being tested in animal models include sphingosine 1 phosphate modulators [15, 16], COX inhibitors, Slit-Robo4 pathway modulators [17], PAR2 agonists [18], modulation of production/signaling of oxidized phospholipids [19], and TLR4 antagonists [20]. However, it is clear from ongoing studies that global blunting, not ablation, of inflammatory mediators will likely be required to ameliorate pathology associated with cytokine storm as one must balance suppression of immune pathology with proper control of the infectious agent."}
