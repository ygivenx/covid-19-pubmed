{"title": "Hypothesis links emergence of chloroquine-resistant malaria and other intracellular pathogens and suggests a new strategy for treatment of diseases caused by intracellular parasites", "body": "Quinine has been used since the 1800s as prophylaxis for malaria, primarily by non-indigenous visitors. Quinine was largely replaced by chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and related compounds in the 1950s, and these drugs have been used widely and intensely by natives of endemic areas as well as visitors. The mode of action of \"chloroquine anti-malarial drugs\" (Cq) is not clear. However, Cq may suppress the transcription-factor NF-kappa-B [1] , which normally up-regulates Bcl-2 and other anti-apoptotic proteins, leading to apoptosis [2, 3] . Recently, it has been shown that caspase-independent disruption of the mitochondrial membrane regulated by the Bcl-2 family proteins is the rate-limiting step for apoptosis induced by hydroxychloroquine [4] . It is also noted that Cq drugs are finding applications in autoimmune diseases where they seem to facilitate apoptosis of abnormally persistent clones of T-cells [5] . Thus, it is reasonable think that Cq drugs may prevent malaria by minimizing reproduction of the parasite in the first stage of its life cycle in the liver by premature apoptosis of schizonts. The malaria parasite invades erythrocytes only after extensive replication (up to 10,000 times) in the liver.\n\nEukaryote cells under stress (genotoxic, metabolic or physical stress) tend to undergo p53-dependent apoptosis. Invasion by an intracellular parasite is expected to cause stress in the host cell. This stress would normally be adequate to provoke p53-dependent apoptosis and this would typically limit such infections. However, it is common for intracellular parasites (viruses, bacteria, protozoa, etc.) to manipulate the apoptosis pathway of their host cells to allow maximum replication of the parasite before the host cell is killed [6] [7] [8] [9] . Sometimes intracellular parasites provide their own anti-apoptotic proteins [10] and sometimes they induce the host cells to over-express the host's anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, IAP, caspase inhibitors, FLIP). Thus, exposure of infected host cells to drugs that work against the parasite-driven up-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins is an ecological pressure on the parasite that will result in evolution of strains of parasites that are more effective (quantitatively and/or qualitatively) at preventing pre-mature apoptosis of host cells. While these new \"anti-apoptotic strains\" may be subdued under the continuous influence of the pro-apoptotic drug, they may prove quite virulent without it.\n\nThe crux of the hypothesis posed here is that Cqdrugs (more potent than quinine and used in unprecedented quantities in native populations starting in the 1950s), have brought forth not only chloroquine-resistant malaria (which is well recognized), but also a host of \"anti-apoptotic strains\" of other common parasites (which are generally not recognized). Some of the new \"anti-apoptotic strains\" of common parasites have become important pathogens because they can replicate in greater numbers in tissues where they previously may have had no niche (e.g., new strains of coronavirus that produce SARS) or because they can produce levels of secreted toxins that are lethal to uninfected bystander cells while the infected host cells (that express high levels of anti-apoptotic proteins) can survive (e.g., new strains of HIV that produce AIDS). Resistance to apoptosis also facilitates cell fusion and cell-to-cell spread of pathogens [11] .\n\nFinally, it is noted that pre-existing cell clones that resist apoptosis by over-expressing anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., memory T-cells or (pre-) cancerous clones) may be easy targets for initiation of infection in an organism [12] [13] [14] .\n\nIt follows from this hypothesis that suppression of the over-expressed anti-apoptotic proteins in the host cells (or potential host cells) would be an attractive way to indirectly control the parasite. This is particularly true in cases where it has proved impossible to develop safe and effective vaccines against the parasite itself. But, care must be taken because some parasites (e.g., HIV) have become lethal because their enhanced resistance to apoptosis allows them to survive while spreading extracellular toxins especially some that kill (normal, unprotected) bystander cells by inducing apoptosis. General suppression of the anti-apoptotic proteins in all cells might cause slaughter of the bystander cells before the cells hosting the virus could be killed, unless intracellular toxins can be neutralized or nullified first.\n\nInterestingly, a drug (G3139, Genta, Inc.) that is intended to suppress a key anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) is in the final stages of clinical trials (December 2003) for several cancer indications. G3139 is an \"antisense\" drug that has been shown to reduce Bcl-2 protein levels in vivo with minimal side effects [15] . Moreover, G3139 is an antisense ODN with unmethylated CpG units, which induce normal T-cells to resist apoptosis by up-regulating c-FLIP and Bcl-x(L), while having little effect on Bcl-2 [16, 17] . It is relevant that Bcl-2 only protects cells against apoptosis from internal stress, but Bcl-x(L) has a distinct function in protecting cells against external death signals such as TRAIL [18] . Verthelyi et al. [19] have advocated using unmethylated-CpG ODNs in HIV-1 infected individuals to protect against secondary infections. Thus, the tools to test the hypothesis posed here are at hand.\n\nOne of the puzzles of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is why this disease has emerged now and only in humans, when the basic virus (HIV) has been around for a very long time and similar viruses (SIV) are carried by other primates without disease. It is understood that HIV inhabits certain host T-cells and the infected cells release pro-apoptotic toxins that induce extensive apoptosis in bystander cells (other T-cells and cells of other tissues). This phenomenon is not unlike the release of toxic NO (nitric oxide) by immune cells to fight infection and there may actually have been a symbiotic arrangement between the humans (primates) and the virus (HIV) to fight off malaria [20] [21] [22] and other tropical diseases [23] [24] [25] . (Although this may seem like an extreme adaptation, remember that sickle cell mutation, which produces a sever disease, apparently has been retained in the gene pool because of its ability to defeat malaria.) Originally, the population of HIV infected T-cells was kept in check by the fact that they were also susceptible to the pro-apoptotic proteins they secreted. However, the infected host cells carried just enough antiapoptotic protein to protect themselves while attacking cells (especially liver cells) hosting other parasites.\n\nUnfortunately, this speculative partnership between humans and the HIV virus apparently turned sour when humans introduced Cq, which not only produced apoptosis in the liver cells as they became infected with malaria, but also killed off many of the cells hosting the virus [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . This ecological pressure selected for strains of the HIV virus that produced higher levels of anti-apoptotic proteins in the host cells and consequently allowed the cells hosting the virus to survive while releasing higher levels of toxic proteins into the blood stream (where the bystander T-cells were their first new victims). As overall T-cell counts fall, humans become prey to a series of opportunistic infections (known as AIDS).\n\nIn the hypothesis developed here, the basic strain(s) of HIV (per-1950) were kept in check by self-induced apoptosis while providing some protection against malaria. The apoptosis-resistant strain of HIV that emerged [10, [31] [32] [33] facilitates survival of its host and cell fusions of its host with cell-to-cell transmission of the virus [11] under conditions where the (uninfected) bystander cells are killed in large numbers; ultimately resulting in a deficiency of T-cells and the symptoms of AIDS. It is proposed here that use of a drug that effectively suppresses the resistance to apoptosis in all the cells will essentially level the playing field and make the infected cells kill themselves (before they can kill disproportionate numbers of bystander cells)."}
