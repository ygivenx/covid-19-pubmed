{"title": "", "body": "It could be argued that our planet Earth is, in one significant sense, misnamed. This is because 71% of the surface is covered by water (Lutgens, 1992) . Air travel has been cited as a major influence on changing leisure activities, yet even a novice can recognize the opportunities for sea and water based vacations using ships as floating resorts. According to Day and McRae (2001) , a cruise ship provides easy access to some of the world's most popular destinations, and this simple statement holds the key to the current successes that the industry enjoys. This can be exemplified by examining Table 1 .1 and completing the task that is described.\n\nFor many tourists, the cruise experience embodies a series of powerful motivators: it is often perceived to be safe, social, customer friendly, and service oriented (Cartwright & Baird, 1999) . The ship provides a mobile, consistent, and easily accessible location to act as a home away from home while the tourist samples the port of call. The tourist adapts to shipboard life and learns to relax into a vacation routine (Gibson, 2003) : a routine that can be interspersed with a choreographed range of ship or land activities.\n\nAs travel expert Douglas Ward says, \"Over 10 million people can't be wrong (that's how many people took a cruise last year)! Cruising is popular today because it takes you away from the pressures and strains of contemporary life by offering an escape from reality. Cruise ships are really self-contained resorts, without the crime, which can take you to several destinations in the space of just a few days\" .\n\nHowever, the notion of \"cruising\" also generates negative perceptions (Table 1 .2). conducted interviews with people who either had not considered or did not want to go on a cruise. They revealed five specific factors that demotivated the potential tourist: counters this list by highlighting emerging patterns. Cruising is presented as being both cost effective and high in value. The range of cruise types has expanded to include opportunities for all sorts of people. In this way, cruising can be both socially inclusive and exclusive: families can be catered to as a specialty market, as can single tourists, conference delegates, older travelers, active tourists, groups, etc.-the list is endless. Ward recognizes that this type of vacation is appealing to older customers but also notes that the average age of first time cruisers is now well under 40. Using the Observer/Guardian's travel Awards list tourists' \"favourite overseas city\" (Anon, 2003a) , identify those that can, in theory, be visited by a cruise ship. \n\nMuch can be gained in charting the history of cruising to identify not only where and how the concept of cruising arose, but also to try and predict where it is going. Table 1 .3 (sources: , Knotes [2003] , Michaelides [2003] , Dawson [2000] , Cartwright and Baird [1999] , Day and McRae [2001] , Showker and Sehlinger [2002] and ) is not intended to be inclusive but rather to chart significant moments over the last 200 years.\n\nMuch is said about the size of contemporary super-cruisers. The example in Table 1 .3 of the introduction of \"Eagle\" class cruise ships, leading up to the launch of the Queen Mary 2 (QM2) is a case in point. The ship as a destination with sophisticated on-board facilities and a much-enhanced product is linked to economies of scale achieved through the construction of larger vessels (Kontes, 2003) . This aspect of cruising has captured the public's attention, and the implications are important in terms of political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental issues. These aspects will be examined later in this book. However, even in basic terms, the sizes of cruise ships provide an interesting comparison (Figure 1.1) .\n\nCurrently, the largest vessels can carry around 4,000 customers and the smallest fewer than 100 customers. The Cunard Line's Queen Elizabeth 2 measures 70,327 GRT (Gross Registered Tonnage) and the Queen Mary 2, which started cruising in January 2004, is 150,000 GRT. Princess Cruises' Grand Princess, weighs in at 108,806 GRT, while Hebridean Island Cruises' Hebridean Princess is 2,112 GRT. Royal Caribbean's Freedom of the Sea (158,000 GRT) is due to embark on her inaugural cruise in April 2006. Scale varies depending on purpose. Large vessels, such as the Eagle-class ships that were discussed previously, accommodate larger numbers and can provide opportunities for greater diversity on board. Smaller vessels can be more intimate and provide access to ports that larger ships cannot visit because of the depth of the ship's keel, the length of the vessel, or the constraints of maneuverability at the destination. Certain ratios (crew to customers, customer space per customer, and size of cabin to public areas) all play a part depending on the type of cruise tourist. The passenger/ space ratio is calculated by dividing GRT by the maximum number of passengers to provide a number that defines cubic space per passenger. Currently the QM2 has one of the highest ratios of space to passengers at just over 57 (150,000 GRT divided by 2,620 passengers). At the other end of the scale, budget vessels might be as low as 28. Ratios of crew to passengers tend to reflect a 2:1 ratio for premium lines and 1.5:1 for luxury vessels.\n\nThe industry is diverse, and it appears that this is indicative of the future direction for cruise developments. The following case studies present four contrasting cruise experiences. The cases are preceded by Table 1 .4 that provides an easy comparison between basic features. The flag of registration is important because it refers to the legal status of the ship (see Chapter 3 for more information). \n\nCost: cruising is perceived to be expensive Exclusivity:\n\ncruising thought to be a domain for the wealthy and elitist in terms of social groupings Family prohibitive: cruising not felt to be for people with children but rather oriented toward older couples Claustrophobic:\n\nthe ship is thought of as a constraint and quiet space a premium Seasickness:\n\nconcerns about coping with seasickness influence decision-making The 'Ceylon' is refitted to become a purpose built customer ship. 1910\n\nWhite Star introduces the 'Olympic' 46,329 GRT and, the year after, the Titanic, which sank having collided with an iceberg on 12 April 1912 April . 1911 'Victoria Louise' becomes the first vessel to be built exclusively for cruising. 1912\n\nCunard introduces the 'Laconia' and 'Franconia' as custom built cruise and line voyagers. 1920-33 In the USA during prohibition, 'booze cruises' from US ports allows customers to drink and gamble while visiting ports such as Cuba, Bermuda and the Bahamas. 1922\n\nCunard's 'Laconia' sails on a world cruise. This ship was relatively small, 20,000 GRT and 2,000 customers in three class accommodation. 1929\n\nP&O's 'Viceroy of India' introduced. It was the most impressive ship of the time featuring the first use of turbo-electric-power and the first onboard swimming pool. It was a dual-purpose liner (UK to India) and luxury cruiser. 1930s\n\nUnion Castle offers holiday tours to South Africa at highly competitive rates of \u00a330 third class, \u00a360 second class and \u00a390 first class. 1934\n\nThe luxury cruise liner 'RMS Queen Mary' is launched. With 1,174 officers and crew and 2,000 customers, the ratio is less than 2: 1. 1934 United States lines builds the 'SS America', an oil fired liner capable of speeds up to 25 knots. This vessel is commissioned as a troop carrier in 1941. 1938 'SS Normandie' 83,000 GRT undertakes a 21 day cruise: New York-Rio de Janeiro-New York. Cost per customer from $395 to $8, 600. 1939 World war two is declared.

Cruise companies work closely with airlines to develop combined products -fly-cruise.\n\n'Windstar' a vessel with computerized sails is introduced marrying the romance of sail with modern comforts. 1990s\n\nConsolidation and globalization: leading to mergers and acquisitions. Carnival Corporation becomes the largest cruise operator when they merged with P&O Princess Cruises.\n\nThe \"Windstar\" concept was introduced in 1986 ( Figure 1 .2). The aim was to combine the luxury of a vacation with the freedom of sailing to create a unique product. The company describes the concept as being \"the ultimate getaway for tired executives, adventure seekers and self-described escapists\" (Windstar 2003). The vessel 'Windstar' shares her name with the company. She is one of three of the company's ships designed to cruise a range of destinations including the Lesser Antilles, Virgin Islands, Florida Keys and Bahamas in the Caribbean, and Western and Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, the Greek and Turkish Isles, the Baltic and Northern Europe. Customers are described as having an average age of 51 for past guests and 50 for new guests, with an average annual income of $120,000 and over. Windstar customers are said by the company to be \"active and adventurous, sophisticated travelers ranging from their 20s to 80s\" (Windstar, 2003) . Typically, Windstar customers may be business owners, executives, retirees, honeymooners, stockbrokers, lawyers, engineers, entrepreneurs, artists, authors, researchers, doctors, or educators. According to , the ship's age creates both a luxury ambience through its use of materials and overall decor and, in the cabins, a more traditional appearance. The overall cruising experience is reported on positively. The experience is said to be relaxing, informal, and stress free. A range of activities, including wind surfing, skiing, scuba, and snorkeling, is available. The ship boasts a casino, a library, a small swimming pool (described by Ward as a \"dip pool\"), a shop, an infirmary, a piano bar, and a \"chic and elegant\" restaurant (called \"the Restaurant\"). Cabins are fitted out with television, videocassette and CD players, personal safe, refrigerator, mini-bar, and international directdial phones, as well as private bathrooms with shower toiletries, hair dryer, vanity, and plush robes.\n\nThe crew is described as being \"international.\" The Captain and nautical staff are European. Hotel senior staff members are American and European. Stewards and service personnel are Filipino and Contemporary Cruise Operations 5 How do you measure the size of a ship? Ships can be described by referring to capacity, dimensions or tonnage.\n\nA cruise ship's capacity is expressed in terms of the total numbers of officers, crew and customers. Cruise companies frequently plan using lower berth capacity (referring to the number of beds in a cabin), implying that capacity for some ships could be increased if capacity included upper berths (some cabins can have bunk-beds or two tier bedding arrangements).\n\nThe length is measured from the bows or forward end (fore) to the stern or after end (aft)\u2212\u2212 fore and aft are commonly used terms. The beam is the width at the widest point (amidships). The draft or draught of a ship measures the depth of a ship as the vessel sits in the water.\n\nTonnage Ships tend to be described and compared in terms of gross registered tonnage (GRT). According to Branch (1996) . GRT is calculated by dividing the volume in cubic feet of a vessel's closed-in spaces by 100. A vessel ton is100ft\u00b3. Tonnage is frequently made use of by port authorities when calculating charges when a ship requires a pilot and for harbor fees. The word 'tonnage' is derived from 'tun' a medieval term meaning barrel.\n\nSpeed is measured in knots. 1 Knot equates to 1 nautical mile per hour. A nautical mile is the equivalent to 1,852 meters or 1.15 land miles. Indonesian. In total, the design is intended to create an environment that is intimate, contemporary, and luxurious. The company emphasizes that the size of the ship, coupled with the facilities and service, easily achieves this aim.\n\nThe World of ResidenSea (40,000 GRT) is a novel concept (Showker and Sehlinger, 2002) . This vessel was built by the Fosen yard in Norway to continuously circumnavigate the world and to provide \"the world's first ship to be designed as an ocean-going residence for full time occupancy . . . . The 'World' provides spacious residences-fully furnished and equipped-and guest suites for family, friends, business associates, or personal staff \" (Synnove Bye, 2003) .\n\nThis ambitious project has dual occupancy options. The ship has 110 private apartments, each with a fully equipped kitchen (galley) that can be either privately owned or rented. In addition, the 'World' has 88 guest suites that can be booked by the general public. Guests are expected to be 40 percent from the United States, 40 percent European, and 20 percent from the rest of the world. The target market for ownership is homeowners with two or three residences, average age 55, who are wealthy \"self made\" entrepreneurs. A typical profile would describe such a person as active, with a love of the sea or sailing and a desire to guard his or her privacy (ResidenSea, 2003) .\n\nThe facilities include four distinctive restaurants, a night club, a casino, theatre, an art gallery, a spa and fitness center, two pools, a full-size tennis court, a golf center (including a real grass putting green), and a retractable marina. The ship also possesses three emergency hospital wards (Figure 1.3) . The itinerary in a typical year includes 140 ports in 40 countries. The ship targets prestigious events, including sporting occasions such as the British Open, the Grand Prix in Monaco, and the Cannes Film Festival. The staff on board is international. The cost of purchasing an apartment begins at US $2,255,000. Vacations can be booked for as long as an individual wants, starting with a minimum of 3 days.\n\nAccording to one of the company's own publications:\n\nThe World of ResidenSea, as the first mixed-use resort ship continuously navigating the globe, set a new industry standard when it scored a perfect 100 points on its very first United States Public Health (USPH) inspection and received an excellent rating on its Certificate of Compliance from the United States Coast Guard. These reports echo international acclaim from Bahamian Authorities and Det Norske Veritas for the ship's health, safety, operational and construction standards, including comments that The World is \"wellmaintained and operated in a very professional manner\".\n\nContributing to the success of The World's recent ratings is its unique Scandinavian wastewater cleaning system, whereby wastes are filtered by a flotation system. Solid wastes are dried and incinerated, and the ash is properly disposed of on land. The remaining liquid waste goes through an ultraviolet filtration process, and the resulting water is as pure as technical water. The World also burns marine diesel, a departure from heavy fuels traditionally used in ships of its size and enables The World to enter more of the world's most fascinating ports (ResidenSea, 2003) .\n\nThe In 1977, the Pacific Princess was cast in a starring role on a new television show called The Love Boat. According to Princess Cruises, the weekly series, which introduced millions of viewers to the still-new concept of a sea-going vacation, was an instant hit, and both the company name and its \"sea witch\" logo ( Figure 1.4 ) have remained synonymous with cruising ever since.\n\nThe Grand Princess was regarded in 2003 by Princess Cruises as being the \"flagship of Personal Choice Cruising.\" This concept seeks to empower customers so that they could create their own selection of activities from a broad choice of facilities, amenities, and services. In this way the vacation could then be perceived as being personally customized. Keynote provision centers on multiple dining options, flexible and varied entertainment selections, and a full complement of on-board activities ranging from shuffleboard to scuba certification. Furthermore, the experience is presented using marketing slogans, such as \"affordable luxury\" and \"big ship choice with small ship feel,\" to focus on the unique orientation of the vessel within the marketplace.\n\nThe ship is one of the largest in the world (although not the largest). Its great size enables the operator to include diversity and provide choice. Seven hundred and ten cabins (80 percent of all outside staterooms) have a balcony. Butler service is provided in suites and minisuites. The ship's facilities include a chapel, a virtual reality center, a casino, three dining rooms and three show lounges, five swimming pools (one is a swim-against-the-current lap pool), a children's center and a teenager center, 28 wheelchair accessible cabins, a sports bar, an art gallery, a nine-hole putting course and golf simulator, a sports court and jogging track, and a wide variety of bars and lounges, including a wine and caviar bar and the \"skywalkers nightclub\" and observation lounge suspended 150 feet above the water. As Showker and Sehlinger (2002) comment, size matters for this type of ship, with its 2,600 customers and 1,100 crew. Not only does the scale of the vessel support the scale of activities and facilities on offer, the ship travels well, providing a smooth ride.\n\nThe Grand Princess offers voyages on a range of cruises including circular routes around the Caribbean. Smaller resorts are accessed by ship's tenders (the small launches that are carried by cruise vessels for both practical and safety reasons). Princess Cruises has ownership of a Caribbean island, \"Princess Cays,\" which is accessed by tender. The ship anchors offshore and ferries passengers from ship to shore using ships' tenders. Princess Cruises is part of Carnival Corporation, one of the largest vacation companies in the world .\n\nOcean Village is a relatively new brand introduced in 2003 by P&O Princess Cruises. Their target market is \"middle youth,\" which is explained by Nick Lighton, managing director of Ocean Village, who states that \"Ocean Village holidaymakers are much younger than traditional cruisers-our average booking age is 40-and our research shows they are looking for activity as well as relaxation.\"\n\nNick Lighton explains the thinking behind Ocean Village: \"We researched exactly what 'middleyouth'-that is, 35-55 year olds with active modern lifestyles-were after in a holiday, and feedback showed they seek stimulating experiences as well as the chance to unwind. So Ocean Village cruises offer 'chill and challenge' holidays-not only can people take it easy in the usual sense but they can also return home having enjoyed a wealth of exciting experiences, be that mountain biking across Contemporary Cruise Operations Barbadian beaches, exploring Antigua off the beaten track by jeep, or hiking through Dominica's rainforests. . . . Ocean Village has ripped up the cruising rule book, letting customers eat when they want and with whomever they want, giving formal dress codes their marching orders and throwing traditional entertainment overboard\" (Ocean Village, 2003) .\n\nOcean Village is based in Palma, Majorca, for summer cruising in the Mediterranean and in Bridgetown, Barbados, for winter cruising in the Caribbean. From each port the ship embarks on two alternating itineraries that are designed to appeal to a target group. From Palma, the itineraries are called \"Palaces and Paella\" or \"Piazzas and Pasta\" and from Barbados the itineraries are referred to as \"Sugar and Spice\" or \"Calypso and Coconuts.\" These holidays are designed to appeal to the target demographic. These itineraries are based around 7-day cruises to include one full day at sea and 6 days at a various resorts or ports.\n\nThe company emphasizes the notion of \"cruises for people who don't do cruises\" (Ocean Village, 2003) , by presenting a ship with an informal style: no Captain's cocktail party, no dress code, and no need to eat at specific times. Leisure and entertainment activities are given a contemporary twist, with opportunities for \"guests\" to be as active or as inactive as they wish when onboard or ashore. Facilities onboard include a gym, two pools, four hot tubs, a spa, a jogging track, mountain bikes (to take ashore), a nightclub, a cinema, a circus and cabaret, a celebrity chef restaurant (extra charge), a kids' center, and eight bars.\n\nIn 2003 the company offered seven-night Mediterranean cruises from \u00a3499, while seven-night Caribbean cruises starting at \u00a3649. Customers paid extra for superior cabins, drinks, dining in the bistro or the deck cafe, shore activities, and some optional onboard activities such as Internet usage. The crew of 514, which comprises international hotel service staff and British officers and managers, provides a three-customer-to-crew member ratio. The success of this venture is underlined by the introduction of a second ship (Figure 1 .5). \n\nThe QM2 entered service as a Cunard liner in January 2003 (Figure 1.6) . She represented the epitome of scale and grandeur at sea by being the world's largest, longest, tallest, and grandest ocean liner. The ship's voluminous public areas, grand ballroom, staircases, and foyer areas and 360-degree promenade deck add credence to the claims for quality, luxury, image, and space. Three-quarters of the ship's staterooms have balconies. Apart from staterooms, the options for accommodation are wide, with alternatives including suites, junior suites, royal suites, penthouses, and duplexes. The two-story duplexes even have their own private exercise equipment. Accommodation on the QM2 is linked to the type of dining experience. Guests who book a duplex, suite, or similarly graded accommodation have access to the exclusive Queens or Princess Grills, while guests who reserve staterooms may dine in the Britannia restaurant. The QM2 restaurants, reflecting the Cunard attention to excellence, are classified as being of 5 star quality by the 2005 Berlitz Guide to cruising.\n\nThe ship has 14 decks containing sports facilities, shops, bars, lounges, five pools, and no fewer than 10 restaurants. There is a unique spa club, a casino, a planetarium, a bookstore, and a college-atsea. As befits a ship of this scale, the options are very wide, providing cultural and artistic diversions during the day and theater productions, dancing, entertainment, a night club, a casino, and even karaoke by night. The ship is destined to take over from the Queen Elizabeth 2 (QE2) to provide a luxury \"line voyage\" between New York and Southampton and to act as the flagship for Cunard's fleet. Scale may well play a significant part for the QM2 in terms of the grandeur and opulence inferred by the ship's size and awe-inspiring statistics, but the other part of this equation concerns the ship's ability to access ports. According to Cruisemates.com (2005) , about 50% of ports are likely to be \"boat ports,\" where the ship will operate tenders to transport passengers from ship to shore.\n\nThe cruise industry in the twenty-first century is characterized by diversity and positive growth (Dingle, 2003) . Traditional cruises exist, and indeed this market is strong (Michaelides, 2003) , yet growth in customer demand is predicted to continue in less traditional markets. The implications of this analysis of the cruise market can appear contradictory. On one hand the numbers of traditional cruise customers appear to be both stable and increasing, yet there is clear evidence to suggest that real growth is likely to occur in emerging markets such as that described in the case study on the Ocean Village. In reality, cruise companies are continuing the trend that is presented in Table 1 .5-that is, companies adapt to emerging situations and seek new opportunities to take advantage of trading conditions.\n\nCruising is undergoing change. The future is predicted to be good, and yet the last decade has been punctuated by a series of acquisitions and mergers (Bjornsen, 2003) that appear to indicate a market subject to constant upheaval and change. In this environment it is tempting to forecast more of the same for the medium term but that would ignore salient issues that have emerged. First, the largest companies, the Carnival Corporation, Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, and Star Cruises/NCL, possess among them considerable purchasing power. Second, new ships create a wave effect, releasing into the market older vessels that can then be used by emerging or newly formed cruise companies. Third, cruise companies have learned to be wary of market conditions and unforeseen events. Public opinion of globalization, the incidence of terrorism, and worldwide threats caused by health problems such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which emerged in China in 2002, can influence customers' decision making.\n\nRecent industry commentaries demonstrate the resilience of the cruise industry in the face of a plethora of world events. As an example, reports on the top 10 cruise lines in this market posted a 9 percent increase in customer numbers for the first half of 2003 compared to the first half of 2002 for North American cruises, using data that was compiled by the US Maritime Administration (Anon, 2003) . Customer figures for the second quarter of 2003 are as presented in Table 1 .7."}
