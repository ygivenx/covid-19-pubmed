[2] [3] [4] Picornavirus nucleic acids are typically shed from the upper respiratory tract for 1 to 3 weeks after infection. 4, 5 A study in adult volunteers showed that cultivatable rhinoviruses were routinely recovered for \u223c2 weeks after infection. 6 Recurrent rhinovirus infection has been described in patients with asthma 7 and in those at risk of developing asthma. 8 These recurrent infections were more likely due to different rhinovirus strains than to persistence of the same strain. Prolonged duration of rhinovirus infections has been described in immunocompromised patients: 4 months in a pediatric stem cell transplant patient, 9 8 to 15 months in adult recipients of lung transplants, 10 and up to 4 months in adult patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia. 11 To date, the study of persistent or novel repeated rhinovirus infections in infants during the first year of life when humans are first exposed to these viruses has not been reported.\n\nMolecular diagnostic methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are being used more frequently in place of viral culture for the detection of respiratory viruses, including rhinoviruses. PCR is more sensitive than viral culture; this characteristic, together with the ability of some respiratory viruses (adenovirus, picornaviruses) to persist after infection or to cause asymptomatic infections, can confound the interpretation of positive PCR results. Application of a cutoff value to quantitative PCR may identify clinically relevant rhinovirus infections. 12 Largescale longitudinal studies involving rhinovirus strain characterization are lacking, particularly in infants and children without underlying conditions. Most studies involve children with underlying illness or strain characterization is absent or limited. We previously showed that sequential specimens from children with URI were frequently positive for rhinovirus. 13 The aim of this study was to characterize rhinoviruses that are detected repeatedly in sequential samples, to differentiate new infections from prolonged presence of viral nucleic acids. We herein describe the results of sequence analysis of rhinovirus RNA detected in nasopharyngeal specimens from infants during URI episodes and monthly asymptomatic visits.\n\nAn analysis was performed by using specimens collected as part of a prospective study to determine the prevalence and risks of URI and acute otitis media (AOM) development in the first year of life. 14 Subjects were enrolled between October 2008 and April 2013 at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), Galveston. Study subjects were recruited from the UTMB newborn nursery or the primary care pediatric clinics; they were healthy and resided in Galveston. Preterm infants and those with major medical problems or anatomic/ physiologic defects of the ear or nasopharynx were excluded. Subjects were enrolled from near birth (before 1 month of age) and followed to the first AOM episode, or between 6 and 12 months of age. Subjects completed the study at age 6 months if AOM developed before 6 months or were followed up to 12 months for AOM occurrence. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months and at 9 months if the subjects still remained in the study. During the follow-up period, parents were instructed to report to the study team as soon as the subject began to develop cold symptoms: nasal stuffiness, runny nose, cough, and sore throat, with or without constitutional symptoms such as fever, decreased appetite, and restless sleep. The Institutional Review Board of UTMB approved the study protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents on behalf of the infants.\n\nTrained personnel collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens during the monthly visit by introducing a flocked swab (FLOQSwabs; COPAN Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) into the nose until resistance was met, and then the swab was rotated gently 180\u00b0. The swab was then placed in a 1-mL tube of ESwab transport medium (COPAN Diagnostics) and transported to the laboratory on ice. Aliquots were kept frozen at 280\u00b0C until testing. During URI episodes, additional nasopharyngeal secretion was collected by using vacuum suction into a mucus trap as described previously. 15 \n\nA high-throughput, quantitative, realtime, reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was used to detect rhinovirus in respiratory specimens, as described previously. 15 Briefly, nucleic acids were extracted from specimens by using the MagMax Total Nucleic Acid isolation kit (Ambion/Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX) and a Biosprint 96 extraction platform (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from extracted RNA by using an iScript synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Reverse transcription was completed with a Bio-Rad C1000 thermocycler. The generated cDNA was analyzed immediately and then stored at 220\u00b0C. cDNA templates were evaluated by using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay with primers amplifying the 59 untranslated region of rhinovirus. 16 A separate qPCR for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used to evaluate RNA quality. 17 TaqMan probes (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO; Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) were ARTICLE used to quantify specific amplification in each reaction.\n\nSequence analysis of the 59 nontranslated region of rhinovirus was performed by pyrosequencing with the use of a seminested assay that used our previously reported rhinovirus real-time qRT-PCR amplimer. 15 Sequencing of the rhinovirus 59 nontranslated region is a suitable approach for evaluation of short-term transmission. 18, 19 Briefly 12.5 mL of iQ supermix (Bio-Rad) was mixed within a 25-mL PCR reaction containing 200 nM of both a biotinylated forward primer (biotin-TGGACAAGGTGCGAAGAGC) and a reverse primer (GGTTAGCCGCATTCAGGG) and 1 mL of the rhinovirus qPCR amplimer 15 and nuclease-free water to volume. Thermocycling was completed by using a Bio-Rad C1000 thermocycler and the following protocol: (1) 1.5 minutes, 95\u00b0C, (2) 95\u00b0C, 15 seconds, (3) 60\u00b0C, 1 minute, repeat 50 times, (4) 72\u00b0C, 5 minutes, and (5) indefinite hold at 4\u00b0C. The generated biotinylated PCR products were pyrosequenced by using PyroMark Gold reagents on a PyroMark Q96 ID platform according to the manufacturers' instructions (Qiagen). An amplimer specific sequencing primer (TAGC-CGCATTCAGGG) was used at a final concentration 0.3 mM in combination with 20 cyclic dispensations of (GCAT).\n\nTo further verify prolonged presence of rhinovirus RNA, samples from cases with persistence of the same strain identified by pyrosequencing were subjected to Sanger-based sequencing of the P1-P3 region within the 59 nontranslated region. 20 PCR was performed by using 12.5 mL REDTaqReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich), 200 nM of forward and reverse primer, 3 mL of cDNA template, and nuclease-free water. PCR products were cloned by using a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Representative plasmids were purified from isolated bacterial colonies and were Sanger-sequenced (SeqWright, Houston, TX). Results were analyzed by using Genbank/BLAST and Clustal Omega alignment functions. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by using the Information Genomique et Structuale Web portal (http://www.phylogeny.fr/version2_ cgi/simple_phylogeny.cgi).\n\nThis report included 362 infants studied consecutively over a 5-year period through 5 winter seasons. Of 362 infants, 54% were male, 76% were white, 23% were black, and 1% were Asian. One hundred and eighty (49.7%) infants were Hispanic, and 182 (50.3%) were non-Hispanic. Forty-one (11%) infants were followed for ,6 months, 118 (33%) for 6 to ,12 months, and 203 (56%) for 12 months. A total of 2153 specimens were collected between November 2008 and October 2013 from 362 infants and were tested for rhinovirus by qRT-PCR (mean: 5.9 specimens per infant). A total of 252 (69.6%) infants tested positive for rhinovirus at least once. Figure 1 shows the flow diagram for the number of subjects and specimens included in the study. Rhinovirus RNA was detected in 437 (20.3%) specimens, for an average of 1.7 rhinovirus isolates per infant. A total of 395 (90%) specimens had evaluable (valid) rhinovirus nucleotide sequencing results; each of these 395 rhinovirus-positive specimens was considered 1 rhinovirus RNA isolate.\n\nSequencing results were compared for samples from the same patient over time, and repeat positives of the same rhinovirus strain were identified to represent a prolonged or persistent distinct rhinovirus infection. Figure 2 shows a hypothetical subject and the terminology used for this study. Overall, 341 distinct rhinovirus infections in 216 infants were identified. The number of rhinovirus infections during the study period is shown in Fig 3. There were 26 occurrences in which a rhinovirus strain was replaced by a different strain within a 30-day interval, representing 14.5% of the 179 rhinovirus infections.\n\nProlonged presence of rhinovirus RNA was defined as the presence of the same rhinovirus strain for longer than 30 days, with or without intervening negative specimens. To identify cases with prolonged rhinovirus presence, followup specimens that were negative for that particular rhinovirus strain must have been collected within 30 days. Follow-up specimens that were positive for the same rhinovirus strain could be collected at any interval (not restricted to 30 days). Of the 341 unique rhinovirus infections, 179 had available follow-up specimens within 30 days or showed prolonged presence of the same rhinovirus strain. Therefore, 179 unique evaluable rhinovirus infections (in 134 infants) served as the sample set to assess prolonged presence of rhinovirus. There were an additional 46 infections that had follow-up specimens collected between 31 and 40 days, 22 that had follow-up specimens collected between 41 and 60 days, and 94 that had either no follow-up specimens or only specimens collected after 60 days. However, these 162 infections were not included in the final analysis. Of the 179 distinct rhinovirus infections analyzed, 148 (83%) had between 2 and 11 followup specimens that were negative for the specific rhinovirus strain. Of 134 infants (from whom the 179 rhinovirus infections were identified), 99 had single rhinovirus-positive samples and 35 infants had 2 to 4 rhinovirus isolates.\n\nOf 179 distinct rhinovirus infections, 133 were represented by 1 rhinovirus isolate, with follow-up specimens negative for that rhinovirus strain. Another 46 infections (25.7%) consisted of the same rhinovirus strain detected repeatedly. We also evaluated the symptom patterns associated with the 8 cases of prolonged rhinovirus presence. The results revealed 4 different symptom patterns: (1) initially symptomatic, with rhinovirus RNA detectable after resolution of symptoms (2 cases; cases 3 and 8);\n\n(2) symptomatic throughout (1 case; case 5); (3) asymptomatic throughout (3 cases; cases4, 6,and7);and(4) asymptomatic at first detection with later development of symptoms (2 cases; cases 1 and 2). During periods of prolonged rhinovirus RNA presence with either symptoms throughout, or initially asymptomatic and symptomatic later (cases 1, 2, and 5), the viral load increased by 3.79, 3.98, and 4.09 log 10 copies/mL over 54, 57, and 41 days, respectively. In contrast, during periods of prolonged rhinovirus RNA presence that were asymptomatic throughout, or initially symptomatic and later resolved (cases 7 and 8), the viral load decreased by 2.51 and 1.28 log 10 copies/mL over 91 and 53 days, respectively.\n\nRhinovirus RNA viral load data and qPCR results for other respiratory viruses were available for some of the cases that showed prolonged presence (Supplemental Table 2 ). Additional respiratory viruses were frequently detected during the prolonged rhinovirus infections. Coronaviruses were detected in all 8 cases, and their initial detection was most often not associated with respiratory symptoms. A review of medical records of the infants with prolonged presence of rhinovirus RNA found no evidence of underlying conditions that are generally considered to result in persistent RV infections (eg, asthma, hypogammaglobulinemia, or other immunodeficiency disorders).\n\nWith increased use of molecular diagnostics for respiratory viruses and the associated increase in sensitivity of detection, the biological and clinical significance of detection of viral nucleic acids must be addressed. This issue is complicated by the challenge of differentiating between new infection and Flow diagram for subjects and specimens included in the study. a After the detection of a rhinovirus strain, follow-up specimens that were negative for that particular rhinovirus strain were collected within 30 days. Follow-up specimens that were positive for the same rhinovirus strain were collected at any interval (not restricted to 30 days). RT-PCR, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; RV, rhinovirus.\n\nHypothetical subject and terminology used for study. This subject had 7 rhinovirus RNA isolates (detections) and 3 distinct rhinovirus infections. RV, rhinovirus.\n\nprolonged virus presence/persistence. We focused our study on the most common viral infection of the respiratory tract in infants during their first year of life. The data from our large longitudinal study show that frequent infections with different rhinovirus strains are common in infants during the first year of life. Importantly, the results indicated that rhinovirus RNA rarely persisted beyond 30 days after rhinovirus infection.\n\nOf 341 distinct rhinovirus infections documented, we selected for analysis 179 rhinovirus infections that had available follow-up specimens within 30 days or showed prolonged presence of the same rhinovirus strain. Consistent with our earlier study that examined the persistence of adenovirus nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal secretions, 13 we used a 30-day cutoff to define prolonged presence of rhinovirus RNA. Other studies have also used a 30-day time limit to distinguish between new and repeated nucleic acid detection. 21 Of the 179 rhinovirus infections analyzed, 148 (83%) had between 2 and 11 follow-up specimens that were negative for the specific rhinovirus strain. This finding provided strong evidence that the rhinovirus strain was permanently rather than transiently absent. Clinically, this finding was associated with a lack of symptoms and likely indicated a resolution of infection. Of 179 rhinovirus infections that were evaluated, RNA was detected in 133 (74%) in only a single specimen; 46 (26%) infections showed repeated detection of the same strain. Half of the repeated rhinovirus RNA events were #7 days in duration; the majority of repeat positives occurred within a 30-day window. Among the 46 infections with repeated isolates, there were a total of 99 isolates, for an average of 2.2 per infection. The majority of the 46 infections had 2 isolates, several had 3, and none had .3. Only 8 of the 46 repeated rhinovirus RNA isolates were detected .30 days apart, our definition of prolonged presence (4.5% of all evaluable rhinovirus infections).\n\nOf the 216 infants with rhinoviruspositive specimens with sequence data, 93 (43%) had between 2 and 4 different rhinovirus infections during the 6-to 12-month follow-up, whereas 123 (57%) had only a single rhinovirus infection during the study period. Infants can be infected with a variety of rhinovirus strains throughout the first year of life. Indeed, our data show that repeated detection of rhinovirus RNA from nasopharyngeal specimens from infants is more likely to represent new infection than prolonged presence .30 days. Among the 179 rhinovirus infections studied, there were 26 occurrences of a rhinovirus strain being replaced by a different strain within the 30-day follow-up period, compared with only 8 prolonged rhinovirus infections. Persistent rhinovirus infections (or prolonged presence of rhinovirus RNA) have been described, usually in patients with underlying conditions. Wood et al 22 examined rhinovirus RNA persistence in 39 subjects (both children and adults) with acute asthma. Patients were followed up once at 4 to 6 weeks posthospital admission. Very few positive viral specimens had sequence analysis performed, so it was difficult to assess how frequently persistence of the same rhinovirus strain occurred. Chronic rhinovirus infection and persistence of RNA have also been described in transplant patients 9,10 and in those with hypogammaglobulinemia. 11 Jartti et al 8 studied serial rhinovirus infections in infants at risk of developing asthma. Considering only moderateto-severe rhinovirus infections, 1 of 150 (0.7%) was associated with the same rhinovirus strain detected at least 2 weeks apart. Because our study included all rhinovirus occurrences regardless of symptoms, our observed higher rate of rhinovirus persistence (8 of 179 [4.5%] .30 days and 16 of 179 [8.9% ] .14 days) was not surprising. Unlike other studies, including the Jartti study in infants at risk of asthma, the infants in our study had no underlying conditions. "}
