The APL 9 increases MHC/peptide (pMHC) complex stability, rigidifies the peptide and facilitates T cell 10 receptor (TCR) recognition through reduced entropy costs. Structural analyses of pMHC 11 complexes before and after TCR binding, combined with biophysical analyses, revealed that 12 although the TCR binds similarly to all complexes, the p3P modification alters the conformations 13 of a very limited amount of specific MHC and peptide residues, facilitating efficient TCR 14 recognition. This approach can be easily introduced in peptides restricted to other MHC alleles, 15 and can be combined with currently available and future vaccination protocols in order to prevent 16 viral immune escape.

We 24 believe that this approach can be implemented to currently available or novel vaccination 25 approaches to efficiently restore T cell recognition of virus escape variants to control disease 26 progression. pMHC stability and immunogenicity has been to optimize interactions between peptide anchor 62 residues and MHC binding pockets [17] [18] [19] . However, escape variants that target TCR recognition 63 often exhibit optimal MHC anchor residues, reducing possibilities for such modifications. 64 .

Next, P14 TCR down-regulation was assessed upon exposure to gp33, V3P, Y4F or PF-loaded H-120 2D b+ RMA cells (Fig. 1C) . While H-2D b /gp33 induced significant TCR down-regulation, none 121 was detected with Y4F, even at high peptide concentrations. Exposure of P14 T cells to V3P 122 equaled or increased TCR internalization compared to gp33. Importantly, exposure to PF 123 significantly increased P14 TCR down-regulation compared to Y4F (Fig. 1C) . The crystal 124 structures of H-2D b /V3P and H-2D b /PF were determined to 2.5 and 2.6 \u00c5 resolution, respectively 125 .

The backbone of the p3P-APL corresponds exactly to the wild-type 129 peptides, indicating strict molecular mimicry (Fig. 1D) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

This is well in line with previous studies in which the Y4F-specific T cell 174 clone YF.F3 killed efficiently targets presenting gp33 but did not produce IFNg [32] . Similar 175 results were obtained using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)-derived T cells (Fig. S4 ). In conclusion, The p3P modification facilitates TCR recognition 209 The three ternary TCR/MHC/peptide structures were compared with each corresponding TCR-210 unbound pMHC (Fig. 4, Fig. S8 ). The side chain of p4Y, essential for recognition by P14 [4, 33, 211 34], rotates down following P14 binding to both H-2D b /gp33 and H-2D b /V3P (Fig. 4A-B) . A 212 similar rotation was also observed for residue p4F in H-2D b /PF upon binding to P14 (Fig. 4C) . 213 The side chain of p6F in gp33 is also affected upon binding to P14 (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly, the 214 p3P modification resulted in a similar conformation for p6F in both H-2D b /V3P and H-2D b /PF 215 prior to binding to P14 ( Fig. 1D and Fig. 4) . Furthermore, the side chain of residue p1K in H-216 2D b /gp33 also moves towards the N-terminal of the peptide binding cleft following P14 binding 217 (Fig. 4A) , taking an identical conformation as in both p3P-substituted peptides (Fig. 4D) .

In contrast to gp33, the p2-p4 section is more constrained in both V3P and PF, 223 following TCR binding (Fig. 4B, 4C ). However, it should be noted that the final conformations of 224 all three peptides in the ternary complexes is nearly identical (Fig. 4D ). In conclusion, residues 1 225 and 6 in p3P-APLs take the same conformations prior to TCR binding as found in the ternary 226 complexes, potentially enabling a more favorable surface for P14 TCR binding. Furthermore, p1K in gp33 also takes a different conformation upon binding to P14, bending 239 backwards towards the H-2D b residues R62 and E163, which conformations are affected (Fig. 4A , 240 5A). Here again, the side chain of p1K takes exactly this conformation in both V3P and PF already 241 before TCR binding (Fig. 4, 5) . Altogether, p1K, P6F and heavy chain residues R62, H155 and 242 E163 have already adopted in the unbound V3P and PF complexes similar conformations to those 243 observed in all three ternary structures (Fig. 4, 5) . Thus, the p3P substitution potentially facilitates 244 TCR recognition by positioning specific key peptide and MHC residues prior to the formation of 245 .

This is well in line with our SPR and ITC results, which indicate that the 246 energy required for P14 recognition of V3P is reduced compared to gp33 (Table 1, Fig. S1 ). The results presented within this study indicate in our opinion that i) docking of P14 to p3P-331 modified peptides is facilitated since the conformations of key residues in both peptide and heavy 332 chain are already optimal prior to TCR binding (ready-to-go conformation); ii) consequently, the 333 energetic costs for TCR recognition should be reduced since there is no need for any major 334 movement in the rigidified epitope besides the conformational change for residue p4Y.
