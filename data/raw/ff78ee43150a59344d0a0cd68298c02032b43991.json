{"title": "", "body": "Childhood illnesses are simple yet complex: Simple because the majority of pediatric disorders are acute, fairly straight forward conditions; complex because children have different physiology and pathophysiology at different ages and at different stages of .development. Western medicine is simple yet complex: simple because the majority of treatment consists of prescribing medications; complex because it requires understanding of a massive amount of concrete and technical knowledge about the physical minutiae of the human body. Chinese medicine is simple yet complex: simple because it is based on very fundamental concepts and laws of nature; complex because it delves into four aspects of the human being that still \"cannot be seen\" and \"cannot be heard,\" that still defy scientific proof.\n\nAn integration of the various simple complexities is no easy task. The ensuing discussions of the common pediatric conditions incorporate the latest evidence-based information for both Western and Chinese medicine. Western medicine has a myriad of valid studies that follow the strict rules of scientific principles. Research in Chinese medicine, on the other hand, has been difficult since Chinese medicine operates within a different paradigm. The scientific method is reductionistic and unifying, while Chinese medicine is holistic and individualized. Two children with the same diagnoses may be given the same medication but may receive different, more individualized acupuncture treatments.\n\nAcupuncture research in pediatrics is further complicated by children's vulnerability to violation of their personal rights and to risk exposure. Children of the same age may have different cognitive development and different levels of comprehension required for informed consent. Children are often rendered \"therapeutic orphans\" because of history of abuses in pediatric research. Since the thalidomide disaster, there has been a heightened sensitivity to risks in children.\n\nAt this time, there is a paucity of data on acupuncture treatment in children. The majority of the evidence in this chapter is extrapolated from adult studies, which are often clinical reports or trials that do not meet the rigid research standards. Nevertheless, in spite of the flawed methodology that pales in comparison to its Western counterpart, the data in this chapter is the best available information on acupuncture treatment and should be valued in view of the many difficulties confronting acupuncture research that is likened to \"fitting a round peg into a square hole.\" Sound research data is on the horizon, as the National Institutes of Health is vigorously funding research in complementary and alternative medicine.\n\nAbdominal pain can be a perplexing problem for the pediatrician. It accounts for the majority of visits made by children and adolescents to pediatricians as well as gasrroenterologists.! and is the most common complaint for pediatric hospital admission.I It can range from having no significant pathology to being a lifethreatening, surgical emergency. The presenting symptoms are further complicated by discrepancy in the child's maturity and sensitivity to pain, and by the caretaker's subjective interpretation based on the child's behavior (especially in infants and young children). Differential diagnoses vary according to age and sex of the child, and to the timing of onset of symptoms as acute or chronic.\n\nWestern evaluation consists of a comprehensive physical examination and laboratory studies that include blood tests, urine or stool tests and X-ray studies. Recently, ultrasonography has been shown to be beneficial in evaluating children with abdominal pain. 3 -1o An integrated approach can utilize Western technology to precisely identify the structural pathology, and Chinese medicine to function in a complementary fashion for identifying and treating energetic disturbances and for alleviating pain.\n\nIt is important for both Western and Chinese pediatric practitioners to be familiar with the common acute abdominal presentations, and to differentiate the ones that require surgery referral for either routine or emergency evaluations. Acupuncture has been recorded as a therapeutic measure for acute abdominal pain as early as the Nei ling, the Yellow Emperor's Canon of Medicine. Although it is widely used today for adults in China.U its efficacy has not been adequately demonstrated in children, who are much more fragile in acute situations and who can change and clinically deteriorate much more rapidly than adults. Most likely, at least for the present, Chinese medicine can provide specific treatments for some nonemergency, pediatric conditions, and can be an adjunctive, palliative therapy for pain and other symptoms prior to and after surgery.\n\nAcute abdominal pain in children is distinguished both in clinical manifestations and in age of presentation. Gastroenteritis and constipation are common causes of acute onset of abdominal pain at any age. Colic usually presents in infants under age 3 months. Intussusception should be suspected in slightly older infants, 6-24 months of age, who present with sudden, severe abdominal pain. Appendicitis usually affects children between 2 and 18 years of age. Abdominal pain secondary to renal disorders usually presents in the preschooler, and mittelschmerz and pelvic inflammatory disease enter the differential for a menstruating teenage girl.\n\nAcupuncture has been shown to be effective in reducing pain and vomiting in adult patients undergoing various gastrointestinal procedures. Since the Pancreatitis Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, is rare but may occur at any age in childhood. It may be idiopathic, with familial predisposition. The most common cause of pancreatitis in children is mumps infection. Trauma and drugs such as steroids can lead to pancreatic symptoms.V Ultrasonography usually shows an abnormal, nonspecific swelling of the pancreas. Adult studies indicate that a treatment protocol that integrates Chinese medicine with Western medicine reduced mortality in recently diagnosed severe pancreatitis.P One study indicates that body acupuncture alone was ineffective for pain relief in alcoholinduced pancreatitis.I? but press pellets applied to auricular points Shenmen, Sympathetic, Pancreas, Abdomen and Duodenum were successful in relieving pancreatic pain in an adult. 30 Since children are receptive to noninvasive techniques, this treatment should be tried on the rare child who' presents with pancreatic pain.\n\nChinese medicine interprets pancreatitis as Heat in the Spleen/Pancreas. A four-point Heat dispersing treatment can be used:\n\n\u2022 Tonify SP-9, KI-10; sedate SP-2, HT-8 \u2022 Press pellets can be applied to auricular points listed above.\n\nWhen surgical emergencies and serious abdominal disorders are ruled out or are being treated, ST-36, CV-12 and PC-6 can be used to treat pain by harmonizing the Middle Energizer, regulating Qi, and tonifying Stomach and Spleen.\n\nIt is imperative that practitioners recognize abdominal surgical emergencies. Currently, there is no data on acupuncture treatment of these entities in children.\n\nThe classic clinical signs of appendicitis are fever, periumbilical pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, producing point tenderness over McBurney's point; anorexia, vomiting, abdominal tenderness and guardlng.I However, frequently the signs and symptoms are nonspecific, making the diagnosis difficult, especially in the younger children. Patients are often sent home with the diagnosis of gastroenteritis.U When the correct diagnosis is made, it is accompanied by perforation in 30 to 65% of children. 32-35 Perforation can in fact occur approximately 36 hours from the onset of pain. 33,34,36 The white blood cell count may be normal in 10% of patients and therefore is unreliable. 31 In the adolescent, gynecologic pathology and even pregnancy can mimic early appendicitis symptoms. 23 Abdominal X-ray is generally not helpful, but ultrasound is especially useful in equivocal cases of suspected appendicitis. Sensitivity is 85-90% with a specificity of 95-100% in the hands of an experienced ultrasonographer.f Laparoscopic surgery is being used more frequently in the pediatric population.F Chinese medicine considers an extra point, Lanweixue, located approximately half-way between ST-36 and ST-37 on the right leg, as the \"appendicitis\" point,38,39 It is well known for treatment of both acute and chronic appendicitis and traditionally has been considered to also have possible diagnostic value. 39 One Western study with 50 patients who had a presumptive diagnosis of appendicitis did not find the Lanweixue point to be statistically a good indicator of appendicitis.S'' whereas a clinical report from China indicates electroacupuncture administered to Lanweixue and ST-25 had a 63% cure rate for appendicitis.t! Other reports also indicate successful acupuncture treatment for appendicitis. 42\u202243 Auriculoacupuncture was reported to alleviate pain in a small sample of adult patients with appendicitis.t\" Acupuncture may be considered as an anesthetic in pediatric appendectomy, since an adult clinical study revealed that acupuncture was comparable to epidural in inducing anesthesia but had less respiratory depression, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmia, and less need for postoperative analgesic and antibiotics.P Another study reported acupuncture anesthesia with 96.6% success rate. 46 At this time, because of the high sensitivity of ultrasound for diagnosing appendicitis, an integrative approach would be for the acupuncturist to immediately refer any child suspected of having the condition to a Western specialist for diagnosis. Because of the high incidence and rapidity of perforation in children, and the lack of substantiating data for acupuncture treatment in pediatric appendicitis, it would be reasonable to use acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy for pain before going to surgery or for diminishing pain and other complications after surgery. It would be advisable for the practitioner not to administer acupuncture treatment to diminish pain prior to referral as that may mask the symptoms and make clinical diagnosis more difficult.\n\nIntussusception is second only to incarcerated inguinal hernias as the cause for bowel obstructions in the 2-month to 5-year-old range. The peak incidence usually occurs during 4 to 10 months of age; however, in recent years intussusception has become more prevalent in children over 2 years of age. 47 The classic triad of symptoms consists of colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody stools. Occult blood without overt blood stools may occur in up to 75% of the cases. 48 Clinical suspicion can be confirmed with either a contrast study (air or barium) or ultrasound. 49 -51 Ultrasonography is considered essential for the diagnosis of intussusception and thus should be recommended in all cases of acute abdominal pain in the population at risk for this disorder. 52 The most common location for the occurrence of pathology is at the ileocecal junction. In 95% of the cases there is no leading edge. The older the child, the more likely is the finding of a pathologic leading edge: Meckel's diverticulum (most common), lymphoma, lymphadenopathy, Henoch-Schonlein purpura.53\n\nThis is a childhood vasculitis of unknown etiology, and is most common in children between 2 and 8 years of age. Gastrointestinal involvement occurs in approximately two-thirds of children, who usually present with abdominal pain 54 and bloody diarrhea which can lead to bouts of colicky pain and intussusception. Usually, there is a characteristic purpuric rash located on the lower extremities, buttocks, and lower arms. Arthritis and arthralgias may also develop. The abdominal pain is usually treated with systemic steroids and intussusception is managed surgically.B\n\nThere is so far no study on acupuncture treatment for intussusception from whatever cause. The role of acupuncture here should be adjunctive therapy to alleviate pain prior to surgery. SP-1 can be treated to stop bleeding.\n\nMidgut volvulus (twisting of the intestines upon themselves) usually presents in the first few months of life. Clinical presentation consists of bilious vomiting, marked abdominal distension, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Plain X-ray may reveal a typical \"double-bubble\" sign. This is a surgical emergency, since the superior mesenteric artery is often completely or partially occluded.P There has been one report from China of successful treatment with acupuncture for volvulus of the stomach 55 but no reports on treatment for midgut volvulus in children.\n\nAcupuncture can be used as palliation of symptoms before and after surgery:\n\n\u2022 SP-1 can be used to treat acute bleeding \u2022 PC-6 can be used to diminish vomiting.\n\nSome pediatric conditions should be referred for nonemergency surgical consultation. Because there is time, acupuncture may be tried with caution.\n\nPyloric stenosis is common in the first weeks of life, usually of the firstborn male. The characteristic presentation is projectile vomiting after each feeding and the infant remains hungry. The incidence approaches 1 in 500 live births. 56 Surgery consists of carefully splitting the hypertrophic muscle, and is curative. There is one study which showed that electroacupuncture at just one point, Zusanli (ST-36) can regulate pylorus peristalsis, both enhancing the hypofunctioning and diminishing the hyperfunction of pyloric peristalsis.57\n\n\u2022 PC-6 can be treated to diminish vomiting prior to surgery \u2022 ST-36 as indicated above, may be worthwhile treating while the child awaits scheduled surgery. The author has not had any experience with this.\n\nInguinal hernia repair is the most common surgical procedure in infants and children. The hernia presents as a mass that \"comes and goes\" in the groin or scrotum, often noticed during diaper change. One-third are diagnosed in the first 6 months of life when the risk of incarceration is highest. 58 The incidence is approximately 1-4% of children, with increased incidence in premature infants. The incidence of incarceration is approximately 10% and decreases with age, occurring rarely after 8 years of age. 58 Electroacupuncture can be used as anesthetic for herniorrhaphy. 59 There is no current data on acupuncture treatment on this condition.\n\ninflammatory, or biochemical cause cannot be demonstrated 69,7o Diagnosis is symptomatic, by exclusion of organic causes?\" that respond to medical treatment. 64 The management of functional disorders is more complex and difficult, and must take into account cognitive, developmental, physiologic, psychologic, and environmental aspects of the child.\"! There may be a relationship to development and maturation, as the majority of children show improvement or resolution of symptoms over time. 65 The prevailing theories of possible pathogeneses include disturbed gastrointestinal motility, delayed intestinal transit time, and increased intensity of small intestine and colon muscle contraction provoked by a variety of physical and emotional stimuli. Biopsies have demonstrated inflammatory changes, which may be either the cause or the effect of altered intestinal motility. There appears to be a strong genetic predisposition as patients often have a family history of nonspecific abdominal illnesses, irritable bowel syndrome, and peptic ulcer or migraine headaches that are emotionally or stress related. Emotional stress from various causes, such as death or separation from a significant family member, physical illness in parents or siblings, school problems, and recent geographic moves may provoke or reinforce the pain and associated symproms.P' Treatment is multifaceted, consisting of modification of responses from parents and teachers toward the symptoms, diet variations, drugs, and even psychotherapy. A sympathetic and supportive approach to the patient, parents, and teachers is important in steering the focus on the child and away from painoriented behavior,?o,72 Various dietary recommendations include low-fat and high-fiber diets; and restrictions: milk products, caffeinated and carbonated beverages, starches (corn, potatoes, wheat, oats), sweets. Anticholinergic medications are sometimes prescribed. Children who manifest significant emotional components are referred for psychological and psychiatric evaluations and therapy. Unfortunately, none of the remedies has been very effective. Response to treatment is especially poor in children with more than 2 years of symptoms.P Both parents and professionals feel baffled and frustrated, as they can clearly see that these children genuinely feel the pain, and that the symptoms interfere with school attendance and performance, peer relationships, participation in organizations and sports, and personal and family activities. a girl's preference for stylish clothes), familial predispositions, stress, and emotional tendencies. Examination would focus on signs of Coldness, Yang deficiency, Spleen deficiency, and Kidney deficiency.\n\nAll three presentations have excess Cold and Spleen deficiency with abdominal pain. Therefore, the general treatment for all three chronic, functional conditions would need to disperse both internal Cold and Coldness in the Spleen, tonify Spleen, and alleviate pain. \n\n\u2022 Eliminate or decrease the appropriate foods from the diet, e.g. excess sweets or dairy products \u2022 Advise more regular eating habits \u2022 For Stomach Qi stagnation:\n\n-CV-lO to promote descension of Stomach Qi -CV-6 to resolve food stagnation \u2022 For Stomach Qi deficiency -ST-36 to tonify the Stomach and move Stomach Qi -CV-l2 to tonify the Stomach and Middle Energizer \u2022 For Liver emotional symptoms -LR-3, LR-13 to move Liver Qi; LR-3 to tonify Liver Yin and diminish Liver Yang -LR-l4 to harmonize Liver and Stomach -Teach the child self-calming techniques \u2022 Auricular points: add Liver.\n\n\u2022 ST-25 moxa or apply heat to disperse Cold from the Intestines \n\nAcne is the most common skin disorder affecting adolescents. 74, 75 It is an expected physiologic phenomenon that occurs universally,76,77 The incidence is approximately 80% worldwide 78,79 with higher prevalence in teenage boys, and peak age range of 14-17 years in girls and 16-19 years in boys.\"?\n\nThe disorder involves sebaceous follicles,80 which have increasing sebum production as a normal maturation process in response to the increased activities of testicular, ovarian, and adrenal androgens.F Acne is a well known sideeffect of systemic steroids. The Western diet does not appear to play significant role in the pathogenesis of acne, 77 Although acne is self-limiting with age, treatment is necessary because the severe inflammation can result in permanent, disfiguring scars 78,79 that are socially disabling, and can have long-term psychological sequelae, [74] [75] [76] 80 Acne can be predominantly broadly classified into two types: obstructive as comedones, and inflammatory as pustules,79-81 At this time, there is no cure for acne 1,2 but treatment with topical and oral medications, usually antibiotics, is directed toward controlling the progression of the process and preventing scarring. 74, 75, 80 Treatment\n\nWhereas diet does not appear to influence the pathophysiology or treatment in Western medicine, Chinese medicine posits that energetically Hot and Phlegm containing foods are significant in acne. One explanation for the efficacy of antibiotics from a TCM standpoint is that antibiotics are anti-inflammatory drugs and therefore are considered energetically Cold. Similar effects may be achieved by increasing Cold foods in the diet. Acupuncture treatment using body and auricular points seems to work synergistically in balancing the viscera and harmonizing Yin and Yang. 82 \n\nAsthma is the most common cause of chronic illness in childhood, with approximately 10% of children in the US carrying the diagnosis.?7,86 Significant numbers of school days are lost because of asthma. A wide variation of incidence is found in different countries, with the highest rates in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, and the lowest in eastern Europe, China, and India. 87, 88 In recent years, prevalence of asthma is increasing worldwide, especially in children under 12 years of age. 89, 90 \n\nAlthough asthma can have onset at any age, 80-90% of asthmatic children have their first symptoms before 4-5 years of age,77 Children up to age 4 years have distinctive symptoms, and require special consideration.P! They have increased health service utilization including a higher annual rate of hospitalization,92 which has nearly doubled in the US from 1980 to 1992 for children 1 to \n\nAsthma is a diffuse, reversible, obstructive lung disease with three major features: bronchial smooth-muscle spasm, edema and inflammation of the mucus membrane lining the airways, and intraluminal mucus plugs. 77, 86 During the last two decades, chronic airway inflammation, rather than smooth-muscle contraction alone, has been recognized as playing the key role in the pathogenesis of asthma in adults. 97, 98 Although this association is less well established in children, nonetheless, recent guidelines for managing asthma in the pediatric population have emphasized that treatment be directed toward the inflammatory aspects of the disease.99-101 Chronic inflammation is due to the local production of inflammatory mediators and an increase in recruitment of inflammatory cells, predominantly eosinophils and mast cells. Studies in young adults suggest that the chronic inflammation may be responsible for long-term pulmonary changes including bronchial hyperresponsiveness, airway remodeling, and irreversible airflow obstruction.\n\nBecause of difficulties in conducting studies in infants and young children, information about them is incomplete. 102 Limited studies have detected increases in inflammatory cells and thickening of the lung basement membrane in infants and young children, and have found asthmatic children to have significantly lower lung function at 6 years of age compared to nonwheezers when both groups of children began with the same baseline at age 6 months. These data support the fact that asthma-like inflammation can be present at a very early age, and is associated with nonreversible impairment of lung function. 103 The excessive inflammatory changes indicate that asthma is a disorder due to an \"immunologic runaway response\" that was poorly regulated so that instead of protecting the host, the hyperactive immune response destroyed normal structure. Increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes, are found in the airways, as well as in the blood and urine, of asthmatics 98 during an acute attack and after allergen and exercise challenge.l'\" Cysteinylleukotrienes are proinflammatory mediators that play an especially important role in the pathophysiology of asthrna.U'\" Lymphocytic and eosinophilic submucosal infiltrates appear to correlate with Diagnosis Treatment Common pedlaaic conditions 179 severity of disease.?? In addition to inflammatory changes, epithelial destruction occurs at all levels of the tracheobronchial tree with exposure of the nerve endings, rendering the airways of the asthmatic patient hyperirritable. lOS The chronically inflamed and hyperirritable airways hinder mucociliary clearance, and become susceptible to acute obstruction by triggers such as allergens.U\" environmental irritants 107 including second-hand smoke,108 exercise.U'? emotional stress, 1 10 and drugs. There is strong evidence that correlates asthma with respiratory syncytial virus infection; and children who enter day nursery before age 12 months and are exposed to viruses early in life thus build up immunity with decreased development of allergies. I 11 In most children whose asthma is triggered mainly by respiratory infections at a younger age, asthma symptoms appear to remit by the adolescent years. l03 In older children and teenagers, emotions playa significant role both as the cause of symptoms and as the result of interplay of a chronic illness affecting the child's self-image and family dynamics.I?\n\nThe latest asthma management guidelines classify pediatric asthma into four groups of severity: mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe.I''! Mild intermittent asthma can be typified by exercise-induced asthma, a common pediatric condition.l''! Severe asthma, defined as increasing asthmatic attacks that respond poorly to conventional management, is becoming more prevalent in American children. 86 Status asthmaticus is the condition of a patient in progressive respiratory failure, in whom conventional forms of therapy have failed.l''! The exact definition differs between authors. For practical clinical purposes, any patient not responding to initial doses of bronchodilating agents should be considered to have status asthmancus.l l-Avoiding allergens has been a successful management of asthma since the sixteenth century. It is a much more complex problem today, in view of the increasing amount of pollutants and chemicals in the environment that are potential allergens for children. I 13 Parental education, especially in regards to smoking, can reduce hospital admissions.Uf Since infections that trigger asthma attacks are mostly viral,115 antibiotics are not routinely indicated. Medication treatment consists primarily of bronchodilators and inhaled steroids, which are now justified as first-line therapyll6 both as long-term rnanagemenr't? and for acute arracks.U? Since growth suppression due to inhaled corticosteroids has been well documented.Uf it would be important to distinguish between infants with early-onset asthma from those with transient wheezing.U? Recently, the FDA has also approved of leukotriene receptor antagonists for use in asthmatic children under 4 years of age. 120 These agents counteract the hyperimmune response so that there is diminished airway inflammation and decreased eosinophilia in the airway mucosa and peripheral blood. l04 Status asthmatic us requires aggressive treatments with multiple drugs. Efforts should be made to avoid mechanical ventilation as much as possible, since hyperinflation will worsen with positive-pressure ventilation. 86\n\nAsthma epitomizes the Chinese medicine concept of \"winter disease, summer cure.\" In China, many asthmatic children who were treated with herbal patches applied to acupoints during the summer had minimal or no symptoms during asthmatic seasons. 121,122 The few current studies and clinical reports on acupuncture treatment of children with asthma in general are favorable. 121,123,124 Empiric results using simple acupuncture regimes yielded good results in asthmatic children in Gerrnany.P! One study demonstrated that although acupuncture did not affect the basal bronchomotor tone; when administered 20 min before exercise, acupuncture was shown to be effective in attenuating exercise induced asthma,126 which is common in children. One possible mechanism of acupuncture is in reducing the reflex component of bronchoconstriction, but not in influencing direct smooth muscle constriction caused by histamine.l-? For children who are fearful of or who cannot tolerate needles, non-needle treatments such as cupping and auricular press pellets 123 and massage of acupuncture points 124 have also been found to be effective.\n\nAdult studies indicate that acupuncture was successful in treatment of allergic rhinitis accompanying allergic asthma and significantly affected serum IgE and lymphocyte count. 128 Even with treatment of just the master immunity point, Zusanli (ST-36) acupuncture was found to reduce the eosinophil count. 129 Two points on the Lung channel, LU-6 and LU-IO, produced immediate effect in acute asthma attacks of the \"Cold\" type according to TCM diagnosis. Needle retention for 40 min produced long term benefits. 130 Combined electrical stimulation and topical herbal patches were synergistic, and more effective in both acute and maintenance situations.l-! When both auricular and body acupuncture points were used, steroid-dependent asthmatics were able to taper off of steroid doses. 12 3 The most interesting future role for acupuncture in asthma lies in its potential both in stimulating an immune response and, more importantly, in regulating or modulating a hyperimmune response. At this time, there is ample biochemical support in the literature to indicate that acupuncture activates both the humoral and cellular immune system to protect the host. 13 1-136 Studies have also demonstrated that acupuncture can modulate the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory mediators. 135,137,138 Current hypotheses suggest that this is most likely mediated through a common pathway connecting the immune system and the opioids,139-141 which has been well known to be associated with analgesic effects of acupuncture.\n\nChinese medicine classifies pediatric asthma as acute Wind-Cold or Wind-Heat pathogenic invasion or as internal Kidney, Spleen or Liver imbalances. A careful history would decipher the etiology and facilitate a treatment plan.\n\nAge ofOnset\n\nThe onset of wheezing during the Water phase of development in infancy or early childhood is suggestive of weak Kidney constitution, which in general translates into more prolonged treatments. A child in the Wood phase of development tends to have Liver imbalance and emotional component to asthmatic episodes.\n\nA detailed history must be taken that focuses on Phlegm-producing foods, sweets, and excess energetically Cold or Hot foods.\n\nA strong family history of asthma would indicate hereditary-and therefore Kidney YinlEssence predisposition.\n\nOther non-asthmatic illnesses can weaken the child; e.g., frequent episodes of viral gastroenteritis would result in lingering pathogenic influence and weakening of Spleen.\n\nFrequency and duration of emergency visits and hospitalizations are indications of severity of illness that may be more difficult to treat.\n\nWind-Cold, Wind-Heat, external allergens, diet, and emotions are all precipitating factors for asthma.\n\nAll medications being taken are important information, but especially steroids: dosage, frequency-since steroids interfere with acupuncture treatment.\n\nWind-Cold invasion correlates to viral infection and airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust. The pathogen has passed through the Yang stages and has entered the Tai Yin stage so that the child is deficient with internal Cold. The Lung, being the organ that controls skin, is also susceptible to Wind invading the bronchi via the skin. Repeated exposures to Wind-Cold invasion can result in chronic lodging of Wind in the airways, making them more susceptible to future invasions. The Tai Yin stage of invasion also weakens the Spleen, which is already constitutionally deficient in children. A deficient Spleen cannot efficiently carry out transformation and transportation of fluids, resulting in increase of Damp and Phlegm that obstruct the channels and airways. When Lung Qi cannot descend, reversal of Qi flow or rebellious Qi ensues, causing symptoms of wheezing and cough with clear or white phlegm.\n\nBoth the Western lungs and the Chinese Lung actively participate in the immune protection of the host. The pathogen in the Tai Yin stage indicates that the Wei Qi was not strong enough to prevent the \"burglar from entering the inner house.\" The presence of proinflammatory cells indicative of hyperimmune response even during an acute attack 104 suggests that the regulation of immune response is already affected. Both an ineffective immune response and an unmodulated immune response are biochemical correlates to Lung deficiency-a Lung unable to carry out its normal functions.\n\nDuring an acute attack:\n\n\u2022 Dingchuan, special point for stopping wheeze \u2022 BL-12, BL-B, PC-6, CV-17, LU_1 142 \u2022 During the Wind-Cold illness, sequential treatments need to be instituted to shorten the course of illness: -First dispel Cold from the Lung, then tonify the Lung, and then tonify the immune system \u2022 Tai Yin is the last stage when the pathogen, \"the burglar,\" can be expelled.\n\nTonification of the Lung or immune system without first dispelling Cold is equivalent to \"locking the burglar inside the house.\" Since the Spleen is also directly or indirectly involved, similar treatment of the Spleen would be beneficial \n\nWind-Heat invasion correlates to bacterial infection, which may be a secondary complication of viral infection, or may be a primary infection. Pulmonary symptoms indicates that the virulent pathogen has entered the Qi or even the Nutritive level. Spleen is similarly involved and becomes further weakened. Heat quickly combines with Phlegm, which now becomes thick and purulent. The invasion can quickly involve the larger airways and even lung tissue, causing bacterial bronchitis or pneumonia. Heat also quickly dries up Yin, causing great harm to the Lung which is vulnerable to Dryness. Lung functions are therefore much more compromised than in Wind-Cold invasion.\n\nDuring an acute attack:\n\n\u2022 Dingchuan, BL-12, BL-13, PC-6, CV-l7, LU-l \u2022 GV-l4, LI-ll to disperse Heat \n\nChildren are also constitutionally Spleen deficient. The weak Spleen is further injured by modern diet that is high in Phlegm-producing foods-such as milk and dairy products-and artificially sweetened foods-such as cakes and cookies. Lung and Spleen have a close working relationship. Spleen extracts Food Qi and sends it upward to combine with air that Lung takes in through breathing to form Gathering Qi, the foundation for eventual formation of Nutritive Qi and Defensive Wei Qi. Spleen deficiency would therefore result in deficient Wei Qi.\n\nSpleen deficiency impairs the transportation and transformation of fluids, resulting in formation of Damp and Phlegm, which accumulates in the Lungs and impedes Qi and fluid movements. Qi cannot descend in \"clogged up\" channels and fluid cannot move upward, and the child coughs and wheezes.\n\nAcute attack: use the same protocol as for external Wind invasion. Tonification of Spleen between attacks as follows: \n\nIt would be best for the acupuncturist to work with the physician in tapering medications, especially steroids, because of possible hypothalamo-pituitaryadrenal axis suppression with chronic steroid administration. Chinese medicine posits that steroids can cause Kidney deficiency.I'' Therefore, it would be reasonable to tonify the Kidney while the child is on steroids. The tapering of bronchodilators most likely would occur naturally, as the child would automatically require less medications with less wheezing (see Bibliography for further references on this topic). experts posit that the central disability is impaired motor and behavioral inhibition, which leads to inability to manifest self-control, to acquire appropriate  social skills, to organize time; all of which in turn lead to hyperactivity, learning  disability, aggression, anxiety, and other primary and com or bid characteristics.167-169 Currently, researchers are also studying the correlation between infant/child temperament, such as low frustration tolerance and low adaptability, with development of ADHD. 170 Non-genetic \"nurture\" etiologies include prematurity, when hypoxia and ischemia can cause varying degrees of injury to a vulnerable central nervous system. 163,164 Various foods, including excess sugar, artificial colors, additives and preservatives, have been implicated to playa significant role in influencing the behavior and mood of children with ADHD.145,171,172 Environmental chemicals, molds, and fungi, and neurodevelopmental toxins such as heavy metals and organohalide pollutants have all been found to correlate with ADHD symptoms. 145 Thyroid hypofunctionl'P and abnormalities of fatty acid phospholipid rnerabolisml\"? have also been implicated as potential causes of ADHD. On the other hand, there does not appear to be conclusive correlation of traumatic brain injury with development of ADHD.173\n\nEvaluation of the child with ADHD consists of a comprehensive medical and neurological examination, questionnaire from parents and teachers, and various rating scales and neurodevelopmental tests. Precise assessment is difficult because of a lack of specific biological or psychological test or marker for the disorder, 146, 154, 159, 165, 174 because of subjectivity in answers to questionnaires so that even father and mother can disagree on the child's level of hyperactivity or ability to concentrate; and because the DSM-IV diagnostic characteristics occur along a continuum that can be applicable to the normal population-for example, everyone can be impatient at times waiting in line-or can be associated with other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The evaluation of the preschooler is even more difficult, as high activity level, impulsivity, and short attention span are-to a certain extent-age-appropriate characteristics of young children. 175 The 18 DSM-IV criteria are classified into three categories: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Diagnosis is categorized as inattentive type, hyperactive type, or combined type that has both inattentive and hyperactive characteristics.\n\n\u2022 Either 1 or 2: -1. Six (or more) of the following symptoms of inattention have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with developmental level: -Inattention (a) often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, work, or other activities (b) often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities (c) often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly (d) often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (not due to oppositional behavior or failure to understand instructions) (e) often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities (f) often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained effort (such as schoolwork or homework) (g) often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g. toys, school assignments, pencils, books, or tools) (h) is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli (i) is often forgetful in daily activities -2. Six (or more) of the following symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with developmental level: -Hyperactivity (a) often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat (b) often leaves seat in classroom or in other situations in which remaining seated is expected (c) often runs about or climbs excessively in situations in which it is inappropriate (in adolescents or adults, may be limited to subjective feelings of restlessness) (d) often has difficulty playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly (e) is often \"on the go\" or often acts as if \"driven by a motor\" (f) often talks excessively -Impulsivity (g) often blurts out answers before questions have been completed (h) often has difficulty awaiting turn (i) often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g. butts into conversations or games) \u2022 Some hyperactive-impulsive or inattentive symptoms that caused impairment were present before age 7 years \u2022 Some impairment from the symptoms is present in two or more settings (e.g.\n\nat school or work, and at home) \u2022 There must be clear evidence of clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning \u2022 The symptoms do not occur exclusively during the \"course of a pervasive developmental disorder, schizophrenia,\" or one other psychotic disorder and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, or a personality disorder).\n\nIn addition to the DSM-IV characteristics, this complex disorder also has numerous comorbid conditions: oppositional defiant disorder (ODD); conduct disorder (CD); antisocial personality disorder; tic disorder; depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders. 146,149,177-181 About 20 to 25% of children with ADHD have learning disability (LD).177,182 The most common LD is reading disability or dyslexia;183 but other difficulties include auditory processing disability,184 communicative disorders,185 motor and perceptual output problems,186 executive dysfunction.P\" inability to understand causal relations,182 difficulties in organizing, preparing, and inhibiting responses. 165 Some studies have demonstrated differences in baseline electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities in the parietal region for on-task conditions. 188 Currently, routine EEG is not recommended on children with ADHD. Academic problems lead to further behavioral problems, lack of peer acceptance, interpersonal difficulties,165 low self-esteem.l't\" and high level of alcohol and/or drug abuse. 149,189 The troublesome child with ADHD generates more complications, as families coping with these children tend to experience more stress and have more problems,155 and the disruptive ADHD adolescent with chemical dependence is difficult to maintain in a treatment facility. 190 The child with ADHD tends to be more selfdestructive and is more prone to injuries.l''!\n\nBecause of the chronic, pervasive effects of the multiplicity of symptoms, ADHD management needs to be multifaceted and prolonged. 165 Medication continues to be the mainstay of treatment, with psychostimulants, especially rnethyphenidate (Ritalin), still being the most widely used drug. 144, 146, 153, 159, 192, 193 Although these drugs seem effective for improving attention and diminishing hyperactivity, their potential benefit on cognition and academic performance, on conduct and social behavior remain controversiaI.l44, 194 The tricyclic antidepressants were added as an alternative medication in the 1970s,195 with c1onidine, buspirone (Buspar), and other antidepressants and neuroleptics added to the list in the 1980s. 196, 197 These medications are currently recommended for stimulant nonresponders and children with more than one psychiatric disorder. Combined pharmacotherapy is sometimes prescribed for more complex cases of ADHD. 153 Although it is generally agreed that drugs are beneficial on a short-term basis, there is a paucity of data on the long-term efficacy and safety of medications ,194,198 especially in children younger than 3 years of age. 175 Children with ADHD on medication should be monitored c1osely. 159, 199 There is mounting controversy over the widespread use of Ritalin 145 because of concern of possible long-term side-effects that include poor weight gain and development of tic disorder, especially in children with a family history of Tourette syndrome. Pemoline, which is associated with possible increased risk of acute hepatic failure,200 is no longer used. Clonidine is associated with many side-effects and has an increased risk for overdose. 2 0 1,202\n\nBesides pharmacotherapy, a multimodal approach using a combination of drugs and other methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychotherapy, social skills training, and school interventions is frequently prescribed for ADHD. Cognitive-behavior therapies represent the most widely used alternative to pharmacotherapy. Previo~s studies showed disappointing results. 203-206 In 1992 , the National Institutes of Mental Health began a 14month, multisite clinical trial, the Multimodal Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA) study. The results indicated that high quality medication management (with careful titration and follow-up) and combination of medication and intensive behavioral therapy were substantially superior to behavioral therapy and community medication management. There is slight advantage of combination of medication and behavioral therapy over medication alone. 207 Psychotherapy can be an effective adjunct to medication,144,154 but usually requires a long-term commitment to several years of treatment. Concerns about side-effects of medication, treatment acceptability, and compli-ance208-210 are additional factors that complicate management of the child with ADHD. There is increasing interest in more natural, holistic integrative approaches to ADHD.145\n\nThere is minimal data on Chinese medicine treatment of ADHD. One clinical trial using a tonic herb demonstrated improvement of behavior and academic performance, and increased metabolism of dopamine and catecholamines.U! Another trial using herbal preparation for balancing Liver and Spleen resulted in increase in intellectual function. 212 A thorough literature review of alternative treatments for ADHD identified 24 CAM therapies, and revealed that Chinese herbal treatment has promising pilot data. Simple sugar restriction seems ineffective. 213 The author conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study funded by the National Institutes of Health that integrated DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, conventional theories of frontal lobe dysfunction and neurotransmitter abnormalities with traditional Chinese theories of energetic imbalances. Laser acupuncture was used in the treatment of 7-9-year-old children newly diagnosed with ADHD. Preliminary data showed promise in reducing signs and symptoms of ADHD with improvement in behavior and cognitive function in children mild to moderately affected with ADHD. 214 While Western medicine views ADHD as a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that encompasses all aspects of a child's life, Chinese medicine is equally concerned with the multifaceted condition that affects every major organ at all levels: energetic, physical, emotional, and even involves the spiritual level. The following exposition of the child with ADHD is based on the author's 20-year experience in working with children with ADHD, integrating Western information and incorporating the Five-Element Developmental Theory (Chapter 5) to help unravel the complicities that envelope the child with ADHD.\n\nThe strong genetic predisposition correlates to involvement of Kidney Essence and Kidney Qi. This is especially important in a young child in the Water phase of development, the preschooler. This child is naturally egotistical, curious, active and driven toward instant self-gratification. The child is pre-operational, manifests illogical and irrational thinking, as the child interprets the world according to his or her own experiences without regard for time or space. Activities and movements are not always purposeful, as they \"run around\" exploring this and that in the world. Growth and development are closely related to the maturation of the brain, the marrow in Chinese medicine. Kidney,the foundation of marrow, is the basis of all brain/marrow functions. This can be extrapolated to correlate familial predisposition to ADHD as transmitted through Kidney Essence, and neuroanatomic and neurotransmitter dysfunctions as Kidney Yang deficiency. The young Water child is also more susceptible to both explicit and implicit sideeffects of medication. The physical side-effects listed for the ADHD medications do not disclose the potent energetic effects that usually injure Kidney Yang. Therefore, treatment of the preschool-aged child with ADHD is vigorous ronification of both the Kidney Yin and the Kidney Yang.\n\nThe Wood child is the operational school-aged child, who progresses from the unrealistic, Id-driven, one-dimensional thinking into the two-dimensional realm of cause and effect, right and wrong. Movements and activities become more purposeful as the child develops advanced motor coordination and social skills to participate in team sports. The Wood child is typically Liver Yang excessed as the young tree grows upward toward Heaven; the child learns to make decisions and take directions in his activities. The imbalanced Wood child would manifest motor \"purposeless\" hyperactivity and inability to understand right and wrong as the child becomes physically aggressive. A child acting without proper direction from the Liver, the Qi General, correlates to the Western terminology of having \"impaired motor and behavioral inhibition.\" This child is particularly vulnerable to medication, which is metabolized in the Liver. Liver Yang leads to Spleen Yang deficiency through the destructive relationship of the Five-ElementCycle. Spleen is specifically involved with memory of facts and data, with concentration, therefore with academic learning. These influences are mediated through the Spleen Spirit, Yi, Spleen deficiency also explains the various sensitivities of the ADHD to foods, additives and preservatives. A deficient Spleen would in turn lead to deficient Lung because of the Earth-Metal nourishing relationship, and the child may have difficulty with organization and easily become sad and depressed. Lung deficiency would also predispose the child to become sensitive to chemicals and environmental toxins. Accompanying the Liver Yang excess is the constitutionally deficient Liver Yinwhich is worse when accompanied by Kidney deficiency. Liver Yin houses the Ethereal Soul, the Hun, which spiritually connects human beings to each other. The child with ADHD has behavioral characteristics that alienate peer social interaction, which translates as a restless Ethereal Soul unable to settle down in a Liver Yin deficient environment. The Ethereal Soul is also intimately connected to the Mind, the Shen that is housed in the Heart. Inattentiveness and easy distractibility are manifestations of \"brain\" deficiency, but are Chinese medicine signs of disturbed Shen, a Mind that is not at peace. Therefore, the school-aged child with ADHD has multiple organ/system disturbance, manifesting primarily as Liver imbalance, but also encompass Kidney, Heart, Spleen, and Lung.\n\nThe teenager with ADHD is vastly different from the preschooler and the school-aged child with ADHD. As Western medicine points out, older children manifest less motor hyperactivity but are more troubled with inner restlessness. The excess movement of the Wood child gives way to a perturbed Shen in a fiery teenager, who is in the Freudian Genital phase of development with drastic hormonal and physical changes. Teenagers gradually discover their sexual identity, as they explore passionate relationships with the opposite sex and distance themselves from their parents. The adolescent Fire children are fearless and difficult to control. They experiment with drugs and alcohol and are rebellious in a treatment facility. Their excess Heart Fire or Yang is accompanied by Heart Yin deficiency secondary to Kidney and Liver Yin deficiencies. The Ethereal Soul and the Shen are restless, unable to find solace in deficient\" houses.\" As Fire destroys Metal, depression and mood disorder can be more pronounced with Lung deficiency. The Spleen can have varying degrees of deficiency, depending on the extent of Liver-Heart imbalance of Yin and Yang. The teenager is also vulnerable to medications, because an excess bitter taste would further injure the Heart. Chinese medicine treatment would focus on the Heart, but also balance the Kidney, Liver, Spleen and Lung. Like its Western counterpart, acupuncture treatment of ADHD is also extremely complex. Management needs to take into account the age and stage of development of the child, the intensity and types of symptomatology, as well as dietary and environmental influences. Treatment has to be carefully planned so that all areas of deficiencies and excesses are treated, which must be done in increments as the child cannot possibly tolerate a massive, global treatment protocol. The regimen does not follow a fixed formula but must be flexible and devised individually, so that treatment is directed toward relief of the most immediate problem-such as disruptive hyperactive behavior or inattentiveness-with gradual overall balancing of all the Elements. A careful history about diet that includes excess types of foods, food additives, and medications or drugs and alcohol, would help steer treatment toward eliminating or tapering consumption. Lifestyle stresses, such as school pressures or dysfunctional family, would also be important information that provides a comprehensive understanding of the child.\n\n\u2022 Sishencong-GV-20 with additional four surrounding points to potentiate effect \u2022 A special point for the frontal lobe: 0.5 ern lateral to midpoint of forehead \u2022 Yintang point for calming.\n\n\u2022 Vigorously tonify Kidney Yin and Kidney Yang:\n\n-Individual Kidney points: -KI-3 tonifies both Yin and Yang -KI-6 tonifies Kidney Yin -KI-7 tonifies Kidney Yang -BL-52, Zhishi, \"willpower room\" to tonify the Kidney spirit, strengthen willpower \u2022 Four-point protocol: tonify KI-7, LU-8; sedate KI-3, SP-3 \u2022 Eliminate salty \"junk\" foods, such as pretzels, chips, from diet.

It can also occur as prolonged, unpredictable crying,219 and the infant is restless and unconsolable.V'' The crying episode can last for minutes or even hours. Crying may occur any time of the day without obvious cause but is most common after the evening feeding. 218 The colicky episode is often accompanied by distension of the abdomen and cold feet. Often the baby seems to feel better after passing gas or a stool.\n\nVarious etiologies of colic have been proposed that include variation in infant behavior and development, temperament, gastrointestinal and feeding abnormalities, and dysfunction in the mother-infant relationship.\n\nEarly infancy is a developmental stage that represents a complex interaction between the baby and his environment. One conception of colic can be an expression of developmental stress,221 possibly from unmet biological needs. A study on early infant behavior revealed that there was a progressive drop in colicky symptoms by the eighth week of life, so that it can be interpreted as a maturation process. 222 Some infants may have a temperamental predisposition to colic. A study of 40 infants and their mothers reveals that the irritable infants demonstrate an increase in the amount and intensity of crying, more disruption in sleep-wake states,220 increased settled and awake periods. 222 Follow-up at 4 years of age revealed ex-colicky children displayed more negative emotions, more negative moods, and more reported stomachaches. 223\n\nColicky babies manifest various feeding difficulties and gastrointestinal variants. Hypermotility, an overagitated colon, may explain the syrnptorns.F One survey of 2773 infants revealed colicky babies tend to have slow or gluttonous feeding with various digestive symprorns.I-\" Although no difference was found in the intestinal microflora between the colicky infants at the time of colic and the controls, a difference in bacterial cellular fatty-acid profiles at the age of 3 months was found to correlate with severe infantile colic. 225 Colic has been attributed to feeding, both in the timing and the content. Early introduction of bottles may account for less effective suckling with more air swallowing that results in colic. 226 Cows' milk allergy has been repeatedly found in breast-fed babies with colic. When mothers were put on a diet free of cows' milk protein, colicky symptoms disappeared in many infants. 218, [227] [228] [229] [230] \n\nThe lack of synchrony in the mother-infant interaction has received a great deal of attention as the cause of colic. Studies are supportive of finding difficulty in mother-infant interaction.V? Several possible factors contribute to the dysfunction: maternal perception of infant behavior; maternal age; inadequate parenting skills; mother's poor self-image. Colic may in fact begin during a woman's pregnancy or at birth.\n\nA retrospective study of 25 4-8-month-old infants revealed mothers of infants with colic were more bothered by the infants' mood than mothers of infants without colic. 231 This was not attributed to the possible difficult temperament of the baby but to maternal perception. A prospective study of colicky infants with age-matched controls indicate that although there is no significant difference in temperament between the colicky and noncolicky babies, the mothers of colicky babies perceive them as more intense in their reactions, more distractible and negative. 232 Postpartum depression in the mother has also been found to correlate with development of colic in the babies. 233 A question survey of 76 747 infants in London revealed that the mother's young age, parity and socioeconomic status remain the most important risk factors for infantile colic. 234\n\nParenting skills playa significant role in colic. In a survey of 2773 infants, the parents of colicky babies need more advice on diet and hygiene, and tend to give their babies more drugs. 224 Some parents who put forth a great deal of effort to console crying babies may actually be stimulating them excessively, resulting in the characteristic behavior of colic. 235 The mothers' own feelings of inadequacy may also playa role in colic. Compared to mothers with normal infants, mothers of colicky infants feel less competent as mothers and tend to have more separation anxiety.236 Unable to calm her infant's distress, a mother may experience doubts as to her own mothering ability,237 or even feel rejected. 238 This may be associated with abuse or thoughts of abuse, as 70% of mothers revealed explicit aggressive thoughts and fantasies and 26% admitted thoughts of infanticide during their babies' colic episodes. 239 Colic may begin in the womb and at birth. A study from Finland looked at associations between characteristics of families during pregnancy and development of colic. Results indicate that when women experience emotional stress, physical symptoms, dissatisfaction with the sexual relationship during pregnancy, and negative experiences during childbirth, there was increased incidence of colic in the baies. 24o\n\nIt is, however, comforting to know that although colic causes added anxiety and conflict to a family, one study revealed that 3 years after the colicky period, families with moderate and severe colicky infants did not differ significantly from control families with respect to psychological family characterisrics.P'!\n\nTreatment is advisable not so much because of the condition itself, but more because of the negative effect it can have on the parent-infant relationship. Since the precise etiology is not understood, the therapeutic goal of Western medicine is not aimed at \"curing\" colic, but at containment of the crying. 21S Removal of cows' milk protein from the mother's diet, changing the formula, and prescribing antispasmodic medications are the mainstays of conventional treatment and are sometimes helpful. 218 Parents may be referred for therapy to learn parenting and coping skills.\n\nCurrently, there is no data on acupuncture treatment of infantile colic. The TCM explanation of colic is a digestive problem due to inherent weak Spleen. Food accumulation and Qi stagnation result in abdominal distension, gaseousness, transformation into Heat, causing colicky symptoms. Since the infant is in the Water phase of development, the Kidney is vulnerable and fear is the underlying emotion that motivates many behaviors. These explanations correlate well with the proposed Western etiologies.\n\nSpleen is the digestive Yin organ that is responsible for formation of Nutritive Qi, and for transformation and transportation of food, Qi and fluid.\n\nCows' milk causes Phlegm accumulation, and further weakens the Spleen.\n\nChinese medicine posits that maternal physical and emotional health during pregnancy influences the physical and emotional health of the fetus. If mother experiences stress and worry during pregnancy, the fetus may be predisposed to developing various weaknesses, including Spleen deficiency. Western medicine has become concerned that colic may in fact begin during pregnancy. The mother's own weaknesses after pregnancy-Spleen, Kidney, Liver-predispose her to emotional states of excess worry, fear, anger, which can manifest as various maternal issues, such as poor self-image, and a more disturbed perception of the baby. The mother's mental state would in turn affect the mental state of the baby, who becomes more irritable.\n\nThe infant is in the Water phase of development, when the Kidney that influences the marrow, the Western brain, is the dominant and the most vulnerable organ. The emotion associated with the Kidney is fear. The various irritating behaviors of the baby-increase in intensity and amount of crying, disruption in sleep-wake states-which Western medicine explains as based on unmet biologic needs, may be explained as motivated by fear, such as the instinctual fear of abandonment, especially when the mother is aloof due to depression or feelings of inadequacy.\n\nColic can be classified in Chinese medicine as of two basic types:242-245\n\n\u2022 Excess colic-signs of Heat and excess due to Spleen Yin deficiency: red face, warm extremities, intense crying, abdominal distention, agitation. \u2022 Deficient colic-signs of Spleen Qi deficiency and Kidney deficiency: pale face, cold extremities, abdominal distension, cry prolonged but not intense, possible loose stools.\n\nThe management is the same for both types of colic, and needs to be directed at both the infant and the mother.\n\n\u2022 Avoid overfeeding the baby-excess milk or formula result in food and Qi accumulation in the Stomach and the Intestines. There is more tendency for parents to overfeed a bottle-fed baby, as parents usually want to \"finish the bottle\" even when the baby is full versus more natural, self-limitingwith breast feeding. \n\n\u2022 Diet: breast-feeding mothers need to avoid Phlegm-and gas-producing foods: milk, milk products, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, tomatoes, citrus, garlic, onions, chocolate, coffee, beans, rhubarb, peaches, melons. Also avoid excess energetically Hot or Cold foods. \u2022 Treat mother's deficiencies: find underlying weakness/deficiency in the mother, and treat the mother with acupuncture, herbs, and diet. \u2022 Calm the mother: teach the mother to massage her own Yintang point, and calming exercises, such as simple breathing or Qigong exercises that take only a few seconds or 1-2 min utes, which she can practice throughout the day for calming effects.\n\nConjunctivitis is very common in childhood. It can be caused by a wide range of both infectious and noninfectious agents. The infections are usually viral and bacterial; and noninfectious causes are due to a variety of allergens, irritants, and toxins. The cardinal sign is redness in the eyes, accompanied by different types of discharges and possibly other symptoms.\n\nViral conjunctivitis is generally characterized by a watery discharge.?\" and may be associated with systemic viral infections, such as upper respiratory tract infection. Bacterial conjunctivitis is characterized by purulent discharge, often accompanied by edema or swelling of the eyes and some discomfort, but usually does not have any vision change or ocular pain. Sometimes children would give a history of morning crusting and difficulty opening the eyelids. 246 The majority of cases in children are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemopbilus in(luenzae,246 less commonly by staphylococci.?\" Although conjunctival smears and culture are helpful in differentiating specific types,77,247 they are rarely done in a pediatric outpatient clinic. The standard treatment is with broad-spectrum antibiotic eye drops and local measures, such as warm compresses. Complications of infectious conjunctivitis such as keratitis or abscess formation, should be referred for ophthalmologic evaluation and treatment. 247\n\nThe newborn is given silver nitrate instillation immediately after birth to prevent gonorrheal conjunctivitis. Inclusion blenorrhea, a common form of ophthalmia neonatorum, is caused by Chlamydia. The infection is contracted from the maternal genital tract during birth. The incubation period is usually one or more weeks. The newborn develops an acute purulent conjunctivitis, but the discharge and scrapings are negative for bacteria and positive for the diagnostic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. 77\n\nAllergic conjunctivitis is the most common noninfectious conjunctivitis in children. It presents with red, itchy eyes with profuse watery discharge and conjunctival edema. Children often rub the eyes, which aggravates the condition. History can often reveal the source of the allergen, onset of symptoms associated with being around cats or with seasonal pollen allergens. Treatment consists of avoiding the offending allergen, if possible. Using saline eyedrops is simple and nontoxic, and it is effective in up to 30-35% of cases. 248 Local treatment with cold compresses and topical antihistamine eye drops would resolve the majority of cases. Corticosteroid eye drops are rarely indicated and should be used only with the close supervision of an ophrhalmologist.v'? Allergic conjunctivitis frequently accompanies allergic rhinitis in children 249 and would respond to oral antihistamines.\n\nChemical conjunctivitis is caused by an irritant to the conjunctivae. Silver nitrate can cause a chemical conjunctivitis in the newborn. Other common offenders are smoke, smog, industrial pollutants, and household cleaning substance sprays.\n\nChinese medicine correlates both viral and allergic conjunctivitis to Wind-Cold invasion and bacterial conjunctivitis to Wind-Heat invasion. There is no current study on acupuncture treatment of conjunctivitis in children. A report from Russia indicates that acupuncture increased 100 times the resistance to allergens and significantly reduced the content of IgE,250 the immunoglobulin that increases with allergic reactions. A clinical report from China used acupuncture and bloodletting to treat acute, fulminant red eyes in adults. 251\n\nTraditional treatment consists of expelling Wind invasions when there are systemic symptoms, and treating local and distal points for conjunctival symptoms of the eyes. For Wind-Cold and Wind-Heat treatments use the general protocols given in Chapter 7.\n\n\u2022 Apply saline eye drops \u2022 Local points: since it is difficult to insert needles or even apply noninvasive modalities such as electrical stimulation or magnets to points near or around the eyes in children, the best way to treat local points for conjunctivitis is with acupressure: -Massage BL-l, BL-2, GB-l, ST-l \u2022 Distal points: GB-42, GB_43 39,243,244,252,253 \u2022 In children with recurrent Wind invasions, tonify them with the immune tonification protocol.\n\nConstipation in children is defined by The Constipation Subcommittee of the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition as a delay or difficulty in defecation, present for 2 or more weeks. It is a common pediatric problem encountered by both primary and specialty medical providers.P\" Constipation should refer to the character of the stool rather than to the frequency and to associated symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, since constipation may represent the regular passage of firm or hard stools. 255 Infants and toddlers often manifest hard and painful bowel movements by screaming and stool-holding maneuvers. 256 Because constipation is a common occurrence in childhood, it is easy for pediatricians to underestimate the pathology, and delay referral to the specialist. 257 The exact pathophysiology of constipation in children is not known 258 but the list of differential diagnoses for constipation is a long one: functional constipation; improper diet, such as excessive intake of cows' milk, lack of fiber; drug-induced, such as antihistamines that are commonly used by children; association with many gastrointestinal and anatomic disorders, secondary to endocrine disorder, such as hypothyroidism-I? metabolic disorder, such as renal tubular acidosis,26o and neurologic disorders. 255,256,261\n\nDiagnosis is further complicated by familial, cultural, and social factors and normal childhood development. Psychogenic factors, such as various methods involved in toilet training, diet, and misuse or abuse of laxatives and enemas may influence the advent of constipation. Natural childhood motor and social development can also contribute to constipation: as the toddler becomes more ambulatory, he is distracted by many new and exciting activities so that he would pass just enough stool to relieve the pressure while continuing to play, and gradually he develops the capacity to ignore the rectal fullness. In the older child, school, games, social events, and the hurried pace of life may all interfere with any pattern of regularity. Many teenage girls, e.g., may become constipated because of reluctance to use toilet facilities other than at home. 255\n\nDiagnostic evaluation ranges from a simple history and physical examination,255 to using sophisticated technical instrumentation such as anorectal manometry.257 There is no single treatment protocol for constipation, and many children do not respond to multiple therapeutic trials and continue to have chronic problems. 258 Most treatment consists of fecal disimpaction, laxatives to prevent future impaction, promotion of regular bowel habits and retraining the child in toilet habits. New treatments consist of various prokinetic agents. 258 Behavioral and psychological interventions are not recommended for routine management-s-but would be beneficial in functional constipation. Parents should be reassured that although this disorder is not life-threatening, several months to years of supportive intervention may be required for effective treatment. 256,263 Young infants with constipation or older children with longstanding stool impaction should be referred to a specialist for further diagnostic and therapeutic rnanagemenr.P\"\n\nHirschsprung's disease, or aganglionic megacolon, is a congenital cause of severe constipation that occurs in approximately 1 in every 5000 live births. It is associated with a genetic defect on chromosome 10. 265 Intestinal motility is disrupted due to complete absence of enteric ganglia in an involved segment of the colon, resulting in constipation. Two-thirds of cases are identified by 3 months of age; a very small percentage are diagnosed beyond 5 years of age. The first sign frequently appears in the newborn infant, usually of average weight, who will fail to pass meconium; this is rapidly followed by reluctance to eat, bilious vomiting, and abdominal distention. Treatment is surgical resection of the involved colonic segment. 255,256 Although surgery provides near-normal gastrointestinal function for the majority of children, long-term follow-up shows significant residual problems with soiling in 12.6% of the patients. 266\n\nEncopresis is the constant or intermittent involuntary seepage of feces with a huge mass of feces in the rectal ampulla and sigmoid colon. It is common in children 265 especially in a young child under age 4,261 It is known as psychogenic constipation, because it usually begins during toilet training, when the child needs to transform the natural, involuntary act of defection into a voluntary process associated with parental approval and social taboos. This occurs during the preconcrete period of cognitive development when perception of reality can be easily distorted. The inability to completely hold back may reflect coercive attitudes toward rectal continence, or an inability to meet the high expection of a perfect daily performance.P! Management in these cases must begin with educating parents that leaking of liquid stool onto underwear is completely involuntary, so the child should never be scolded or embarrassed.P?\n\nCurrently there has only been one study from Israel on acupuncture treatment of chronic constipation in children. Ten acupuncture sessions increased the frequency of bowel movements. 268 Acupuncture has also been found to be effective in the treatment of postoperative rehabilitation in children who underwent surgery for Hirschsprung's disease. It may be recommended as a mode of treatment for postoperative complications.ss''\n\nThe physiologic process of bowel movement in Chinese medicine involves sufficient Qi in multiple organs and an adequate supply of Fluids, a Yin constituent. Digestion of Fluids begins in the Stomach, where Fluid is propelled downward. The Intestines rely on the Spleen to transform and transport fluids. The Liver directs smooth flow of Qi in the organs, including the Intestines. The Kidney is very important in being the foundation of Yin and Yang of all the organs, and therefore influences the Fluids and Yang Qi in the Lower Energizer; and in controlling both the urethra and the anus, therefore influences defecation.\n\nChinese medicine posits several factors that can interfere with normal physiologic function and produce constipation, and may offer explanations for pathophysiology that is puzzling to Western medicine.\n\nThe major causes of constipation relate to improper food intake. Whereas Western medicine concentrates on fiber, Chinese medicine focuses on excess Phlegmproducing foods, energetically Hot and Cold foods in children's diet of today. Constipation associated with cows' milk is due to excess Phlegm production. Energetically Cold foods and ice-cold drinks diminish Spleen's function of transportation which in turn results in colonic inability to move the stool downward. Energetically Hot foods dry up the fluids in the Stomach and in the Intestines so that stools become dry and hard, difficult to propel through the Intestines.\n\nExcess internal Cold occurs frequently in children, secondary to recurrent invasions by Cold pathogens, from consuming excess energetically Cold foods or drinks, from medications that deplete Qi and Yang, and from any chronic conditions. Excess exposure to Cold such as repeatedly wearing clothing that exposes the umbilicus can also result in internal Cold. Cold causes contractions and slows down Qi and Fluid movement. Excess Cold in the Stomach would result in less Fluid being moved downward into the Intestines. Excess Cold in the Intestines slows down the normal peristalsis movement of the Intestines.\n\nToday's children, along with their parents, live a lifestyle that is filled with stress. Worry, frustration, and anger can all cause Qi stagnation, specifically in the Liver and again the Spleen. This type of constipation is usually accompanied by abdominal distension and sometimes also pain.\n\nSince Spleen is responsible for processing data, studying too much can deplete Spleen Qi, again causing constipation similar to Cold foods. Studying long hours without adequate rest would also deplete Kidney Yin and Yang. Kidney Yin depletion would lead to overall Yin or fluid deficiency, resulting in dry stools. Kidney Yang depletion would lead to Coldness in the Lower Energizer, in the Intestines, and result in slower peristalsis and constipation.\n\nChildren today are encouraged to excel in sports. Many families begin to enroll their children at a very young age in team sports, such as soccer. Some families and children become obsessed with competitive sports, especially in high school years, and the excess physical activity can often deplete Qi, especially Spleen Qi which governs muscles, leading to Spleen Qi deficiency constipation.\n\nThe opposite of the competitive athlete is the \"couch potato\" child, as the incidence of obesity is increasing in childhood. Since an appropriate amount of exercise stimulates all metabolic activities, including peristalsis of the Large Intestine, lack of exercise would slow down movement of stool down the Large Intestine.\n\nInfants and young children are more susceptible to developing infections or Wind invasions, and tend to run very high fevers with even mild illnesses. Repeat occurrences of fever results in interior Heat and dries up fluids, which can manifest as constipation. Frequent recurrences would result in a chronic state of Yin deficiency and constipation that is difficult to treat unless the Yin deficiency is corrected.\n\nPediatricians have routinely administered antibiotics for numerous common bacterial conditions in childhood, such as ear infection and streptococcal pharyngitis. While antibiotics are indicated for bacterial infections, they are frequently administered indiscriminately for viral illnesses, Wind-Cold invasions, such as URI.\n\nSince antibiotics are anti-inflammatory, they are generally Cold in nature. Because they are chemicals, they exert much more potent Cold effects than energetically Cold foods. On an acute basis, the Coldness produces Spleen Qi deficient, Cold diarrhea, a common side-effect at the time when the child is taking antibiotics. The long-term, cumulative effect of multiple administrations of antibiotics is Coldness in the Lower Energizer, which would result in constipation. Children take antihistamines even more frequently than antibiotics, since they are available over the counter. Parents routinely give children antihistamines for URI symptoms and often concomitantly with antibiotics for an ear infection. Western literature lists antihistamine as a potential cause of constipation without an explanation for its pathophysiology. Chinese medicine can explain the role of antihistamine as a drying agent that depletes the child's Yin, resulting in constipation.\n\nChildren are constitutionally Spleen deficient. Some children also have a familial or pre-Heaven ling predisposition for Spleen deficiency, which correlates to the Western diagnosis of anatomic anomalies.\n\nNote the age of onset, diet, previous illnesses, number and height of fever, mental and physical activities, emotional stress, medications-especially frequency of antibiotics and antihistamines; any associated symptoms such as abdominal distention or pain. It would be helpful to have a Western evaluation to rule out possible anatomic abnormalities, such as Hirschsprung's disease.\n\nTake a detailed family history of gastrointestinal disorders and constipation, physical and emotional health and well-being of the parents at conception, and mother's health during pregnancy-specifically if there were dietary factors or emotional stress such as excess worry that could have contributed to Spleen deficiency in the parents, and transmitted to the child in pre-Heaven Qi and Essence. A family history of Kidney deficiencies would predispose the child to Kidney Yin and Kidney Yang deficiencies.\n\nFor children under age 6, consider Kidney deficiency as a contributing factor to constipation. For children over age 6, consider Liver Qi stagnation as a component of constipation.\n\n\u2022 Constipation with excess Cold: facial pallor, general feeling of coldness, cold hands and feet, abdominal pain that improves with pressure \u2022 Constipation with excess Heat: dry, hard, infrequent stools; thirst; dry mouth; red face; sometimes abdominal pain that worsens with pressure \u2022 Constipation with Qi stagnation: firm stools every 3-4 days, abdominal distension with belching.\n\nThere are three major diagnostic categories for childhood constipation, and many children may have a combination of two or all three types:\n\n\u2022 Spleen Qi deficiency \u2022 Liver Qi stagnation \u2022 Yin deficiency.\n\nThe constitutional Spleen deficiency in children may be aggravated by living in a Damp environment, consumption of excess Phlegm-producing or sweet foods; and familial predisposition. Internal Cold, excess mental activity, excess physical activities without adequate rest, and repeated illnesses can all contribute to further Spleen Qi deficiency. The Spleen is unable to properly transform and transport fluids, resulting in dryness in the Large Intestine and constipation. This type of constipation can explain the majority of Western diagnoses: functional constipation, improper diet, drug induced (causing internal Cold), and constipation secondary to chronic illnesses. Encopresis may be the concomitant occurrence of Spleen deficient constipation and Spleen Cold diarrhea, when loose stools seep around impacted dry stools. There may be other accompanying signs of Spleen deficiency, such as facial pallor, fatigue, abdominal distension, and muscle weakness.\n\nThe first goal is to propel the stool through the colon. Anatomically, the large intestine begins on the right with the ascending colon, then goes across the upper abdomen in the transverse colon, and down on the left side as the descending colon to the rectum. Teach the mother to massage the child's abdomen in a clockwise direction (with the child as the clock) begin at the child's right lower abdomen, massage upward to below the ribs, then across the top of the abdomen to the child's left, then down the left side. Massage 50 times at least once a day.\n\nDecrease or eliminate Phlegm-producing foods, artificially sweet foods, greasy/ fried foods, and excess energetically Cold or Hot foods.\n\nThese children should have a balance of rest, study, and physical activities.\n\n\u2022 \n\nDampness from Spleen deficiency can obstruct the flow of Qi and prevent the Liver from properly directing Qi circulation, resulting in Qi stagnation. There is usually fullness in the epigastrium accompanied by hypochondriac pain. Chronic intake of excess sour foods, greasy and fried foods, and medications (which are metabolized in the liver), as well as a stressful lifestyle, contribute to the development of Qi stagnation. Emotions associated with Liver imbalance, such as anger, anxiety, frustration, can precipitate an acute episode of pain in a constipated child. The pain is relieved with passage of stool. The school-aged child in the Wood phase of development is especially prone to constipation due to Liver Qi stagnation. This type of constipation often carries the Western diagnoses of functional or psychogenic constipation, and the child and family are often referred to a therapist.\n\nAbdominal massage is used as in Spleen Qi deficiency to expel stool. Modify the diet to decrease or eliminate excess sour foods, greasy and fried foods, and over-the-counter medications. Modify lifestyle to decrease stress, such as achieving a more balanced schedule with study, activities, and rest. Teach the child self-calming techniques. \n\nChildren are constitutionally Yin deficient. Repeated Heat invasion illnesses with inadequate dispersion of Heat, chronic consumption of excess energetically Hot foods and over-the-counter antihistamines can consume and dry up Yin, causing further Yin deficiency. Accumulation of Dampness due to Spleen deficiency can transform into Heat. Yin deficiency can manifest as dryness in various organs, such as dry mouth, dry skin, and scanty urine. Yin deficiency in the intestines results in constipation. There may be accompanying Heat signs, such as low-grade temperature, and red rashes. \n\nDiaper rash can occur at any time before the child is toilet trained. It usually peaks between 7 and 12 months of age. 275 Diaper rash not only causes discomfort to babies, but is also distressing to mothers and caregivers, who often feel guilty and ill-prepared for this problem. 275 The rash is caused by contact and irritation of a wet diaper and monilial overgrowth, usually appearing as red patches with \"satellite\" lesions. Excoriated skin can lead to secondary bacterial infection or impetigo. Both diarrhea and oral antibiotics predispose the infant to develop diaper rash. Diarrhea increases wetness, creating a favorable environment for yeast; while antibiotics alter normal bacterial flora, allowing yeast overgrowth. The most effective prevention and treatment is keeping the diaper area clean and dry.275,276 During the last decade, a number of technological innovations in disposable diaper designs and materials-such as using more absorbent material to keep the diaper area dry-have reduced incidence and severity of diaper rash,277 Topical antimonilial ointments such as nystatin are usually prescribed. Although topical corticosteroids are in general contraindicared.V\" they are often used for their anti-inflammatory effects. Secondary bacterial impetiginous lesions are treated with antibiotic creams. Education of and support for the caregivers are also necessary components of diaper care. 279\n\nDiaper rash, like eczema, represents generalized accumulation of internal Damp Heat in the skin. There is no data at this time on acupuncture or herbal treatment of diaper rash. Traditional Chinese medicine recommendations would be to disperse Heat and Dampness. \n\nDiarrhea is a significant cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality in both developed and under-developed countries,255,280 and continues to pose diagnostic and therapeutic problerns.P! Diarrhea is defined as an alternation in normal bowel movement characterized by an increase in the water content (decrease in consistency), in volume, and increase in frequency to more than three stools per day. Acute diarrhea is an episode of diarrhea of less than or equal to 14 days in duration. The majority of pediatric acute diarrhea is \"infectious diarrhea,\" an episode due to an infectious etiology. Persistent diarrhea is diarrhea of more than 14 days duration, whereas chronic diarrhea lasts more than 30 days.282\n\nInfectious diarrheal diseases are the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 282 Each year more than 4 million infants and young children die of acute infectious diarrhea. 255 Children under age 3 years have an average of approximately 2.5 episodes of gastroenteritis per year in the United States. 280, 282 Internationally, the average is approximately 3.3 episodes annually.255 As many as 30% of pediatric hospital admissions are for diarrhea, which accounts for more than 1/3 of all deaths in children younger than 5 years of age. 255 Infants under 3 months of age have the highest risk for hospitalization and mortality. 283 It is estimated that diarrheal diseases account for 10% of preventable infant deaths. 255 Preschoolers placed in child-care centers are at increased risk for diar-. I f \" 284 rhea because of greater potentia or person-to-person transmission.\n\nThe infectious pathogens that cause acute diarrheal episodes in children include viruses, bacteria, and parasites. 285 Transmission is most likely via the fecal-oral route, from ingesting contaminated food or water,286 or in infants and toddlers, by mouthing contaminated toys. The nature of food-borne diseases is changing as more mass-produced, minimally processed, and widely distributed foods result in nationwide and international outbreaks of diarrheal disease instead of just a few individuals who shared a meaI. 282 The majority of cases are due to viral infections. Rotavirus is the most prevalent,23 and human astrovirus (HAstV) is a significant cause of diarrheal outbreaks. 286 Frequently, children are co-infected by several viruses. 286 Viral diarrhea tends to involve the small bowel, producing large, watery, but relatively infrequent stools. 287 These illnesses usually have short, self-limiting courses,285 typically lasting between 3 and 7 days.23 However, they can be devastating to children with compromised immune systems or structural abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. 282\n\nThe most common bacterial agents are enteropathogenic E. coli, Shigella and Salmonella, and Campylobacter. 23 ,287 These are much more virulent pathogens that usually cause mucosal injury in the small and large intestines, producing frequent, often bloody stools containing Ieukocytes.P? E. coli has become an important public health problem in recent years, causing more than 20 000 cases of infection and up to 250 deaths per year in the United States. 288 Transmission of infection is most commonly linked to consumption of contaminated meat, water, unpasteurized milk, leafy lettuce, alfalfa sprouts and goats' milk,288,289 and by exposure to contaminated water in recreational swimming sites. 289 The different strains of enteropathogenic E. coli produce an inflammatory diarrhea by attaching to the intestinal mucosa and releasing toxins that injure cells and cause hemorrhage and necrosis. 290 The acute diarrhea, accompanied by abdominal cramping, progresses to bloody stools, and often leads to serious complications such as hemolytic-uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. 288,289 Shigella and Salmonella cause similar inflammatory injury that results in bloody stools and fecal leukocytes. 23 The most common parasitic infection is Giardia lamblia which often causes secretory diarrhea without blood 23 and often leads to chronic diarrhea.s'\" Diagnosis and treatment are still inconsistent. Because most acute diarrhea is self-limiting, physicians often do not obtain stool cultures or examination for ova and parasites since the results are not available sometimes for several days. Stool culture can identify different types of bacteria, but detection of specific enteropathogenic strains of E. coli requires specific serotyping that is not performed in routine stool cultures. 288 It is expensive, time-consuming, and often not sufficiently specific or sensitive so that it is not recommended for routine diagnosis.P\"\n\nThe primary treatment focus is on correction of dehydration, which is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in acute diarrhea. 292 Oral rehydration treatment (ORT) with solutions containing appropriate concentrations of electrolytes and carbohydrates is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO)293 and has significantly reduced mortality. 283, 287, [293] [294] [295] The rationale for ORT is that the intestinal sodium transport is enhanced by glucose and this mechanism remains intact despite entertoxin injury to the small intestine epithelium. 293 Following rehydration, early refeeding with lactose-free-V or normal, age-appropriate diet 285 is important for reducing diarrheal duration, severity, and nutritional impact. 293 Supplementation with specific dietary ingredients that are lost in diarrhea, such as vitamin A, zinc, and folate, is also recommended.P''\n\nSince the majority of acute infectious diarrheas are viral, they do not need antimicrobial therapy. The rotavirus vaccine was put on the market in the United States in October 1998. This vaccine, as a natural infection, decreases the risk of acute rota virus diarrhea by 50% and the risk of severe diarrhea with dehydration by more than 70%.294,295 Breast feeding is one of the most important preventive measures. 296,297 Continuation of breast feeding has also been found to control acute diarrheal episodes. 293 Improving hygiene such as handwashing is also important, especially in daycare centers.\n\nTreatment with antimicrobial therapy must be instituted carefully only upon specific identification of the pathogen and of drug sensitivity. There is increasing frequency of antibiotic resistance so that commonly used antibiotics are ineffective in acute diarrhea. 282,294-297 Treatment of salmonellosis with antibiotics can prolong the carrier state and lead to a higher clinical relapse rate. 282 Injudicious antimicrobial therapy can also lead to susceptibility to other infections, enhance colonization of resistant organisms,282,298 and disrupt the normal intestinal flora, the body's natural defense against infection. 299\n\nAfter acute gastroenteritis, delayed recovery and protracted diarrhea may occur, leading to postenteritis enteropathy. The diarrhea persists for more than 14 days, with continual small-intestinal mucosal damage. 255,300 It occurs most frequently in very young infants, especially those living in poor, crowded conditions,255 in bottle-fed malnourished infants, and after rotavirus infection. 301 In Denmark the incidence was estimated to be approximately 3 per 1000 pediatric hospital admissions for gastroenteritis. 255 Clinically, the infant is listless, irritable, often has a \"worried look,\" and begins to show weight loss and wasting with persistent diarrhea. If the watery stool is profuse, the abdomen may become distended and tympanitic. 255 The precise pathogenesis for ongoing diarrhea following a bout of infectious gastroenteritis remains undetermined, but is most likely multifactorial: (1) persistence of the intestinal pathogen; (2) malnutrition from the acute episode exerts an adverse effect on the repair of the intestinal mucosa and on the recovery of normal motility; (3) dysmotility engenders bacterial contamination and overgrowth;302 (4) young age with immature immune response to antigenic stimuli. 255 Secondary lactose 302 and sucrose malabsorption and small bowel bacterial overgrowth have been detected. 302 The finding of lymphocytic infiltration of the intestinal mucosa suggests a cell-mediated immune response to environmental antigens, such as dietary, microbial, or both. 303 Whereas the major complication due to acute diarrhea is dehydration, persistent diarrhea even at 2 to 3 weeks' duration can result in malnutrition 255 and failure to thrive. 291,304,305 Despite intensive field-based and laboratory studies over three decades, many questions remain unanswered about prevention and the best approaches to management. 255 Children with secondary lactose intolerance would have more watery diarrhea, accompanied by bloating, flatulence, and crampy abdominal pain after ingestion of lactose. 23 A general elimination diet with lactose-free protein hydrolysate formula may be life-saving in some infants. 30l\n\nChronic diarrhea, defined as diarrhea lasting more than 30 days,282 seems to be increasing globally in the pediatric population. 306 A long list of differentials includes congenital anatomic abnormalities, such as short bowel syndrome; enteric infections, extraintestinal infection, such as urinary tract infection; acquired sugar and protein intolerance, inflammatory bowel disease, immune defects, inborn errors of metabolism, and endocrinopathies. 255,307 Malnutrition due to chronic diarrhea affects hundreds of millions of young children and annually causes more than 3 million deaths in children aged under 5 years of age. 255 There is still no universal approach to diagnosis and treatment. 308 Infections remain the most common cause of chronic diarrhea in children of all ages,307 with an expanding number of potential viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens.P? Just as in acute diarrhea, identification of the specific pathogen and drug sensitivity is important for management of infectious chronic diarrhea. Giardia is a frequent parasite in children and medication treatment appears beneficial.U'' Treatment of noninfectious conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, needs to be directed toward the primary disorder. In all cases of chronic diarrhea, malnutrition needs to be treated vigorously in order to prevent growth failure and mortality. Elimination diets generalIy only provide transitory, symptomatic relief. 31l Besides monitoring fluid and caloric intake, micronutrients such as zinc 312 and vitamins need to be supplemented. 306 Newer treatment and prevention modalities, including probiotics and vaccinations, are assuming increasingly more important roles in management of chronic diarrhea.I''? Chronic diarrhea without malnutrition is toddler's diarrhea, or chronic nonspecific diarrhea (CNSD). It is the most frequent cause of chronic diarrhea in children between 6 months and 3 years of age. 255,313 The typical clinical presentation is a young child who was a colicky baby and gradually begins to have three to six loose stools per day. Most of the stools are passed early during the waking hours and contain undigested foods and rnucus.U\" The child is otherwise active and healthy looking, with normal growth. 315 Stress and infection can precipitate bouts of diarrhea, which is made worse by a low-residue, low fat and high carbohydrate diet. 255\n\nThe precise etiology is still undetermined. There is often a strong family history of functional bowel disorders 255,313 so that it may be an early manifestation of irritable bowel syndrome. 255 From an infectious standpoint, there is the possibility of bacterial invasion of the small intestine by the upper respiratory tract microflora. 255 Current evidence also suggests that CNSD is primarily a gut motility disorder, modulated by dietary factors. 255,316 Diminished upper small intestinal motilit y304 may be a physiologic, developmental phenornenon. 317 Some children demonstrate intestinal mucosal inj ury318 with villous atrophy,291 The mechanisms that lead to mucosal injury are e1usive. 306 Dietary factors include low dietary fat, high carbohydrate and high fluid consumption, especially apple juice. 319 The over-consumption of apple juice has received the 2' 2 Pediatric acupuncture most attention as the causative agent. Previously, children were given orange juice to prevent scurvy. In recent years, apple juice has become the juice of choice for the under-5 age group.320 In many children with CNSD, apple juice makes up 25-60% of daily dietary intake. 321 Apple juice is high in sorbitol and has a high fructose to glucose ratio,322 and therefore contributes to a carbohydrate imbalance. In addition, compared to the freshly pressed and unprocessed (\"cloudy\") apple juice, enzymatically processed (\"clear\") apple juice significantly promotes diarrhea. This suggests that the increased amount of no nabsorbable monosaccharides and oligosaccharides as a result of the enzymatic processing of apple pulp is an important etiological factor in apple juice induced CNSD. 319 Normally, 95-98% of the intestinal fluid is reabsorbed. Disordered intestinal motility combined with excessive fluid and carbohydrate intake contribute to development of diarrhea. 255 Other proposed theories of pathogenesis include food allergy and intolerance,314.323 behavioral problems,323 hypogammaglobulinemia,324 congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency303 and iatrogenic causes of excess oral replacement therapy and elimination diet. 325 CNSD seems to be self-limiting, resolving spontaneously in a mean time of 1.7 years. 325 However, symptoms may resurface later in childhood,255 such as in teenagers who have diarrhea while on a fruit and juice diet. 322 Treatment generally consists of normalization of the child's diet, especially with regard to fat, fiber, fluids, and fruit juices 255,316 and alleviating parental anxiety. Unchilled beverages taken with meals seem to be beneficial. 313\n\nA few studies have demonstrated the efficacy of acupuncture in children with diarrhea. The treatment protocols in point selections generally depend on TCM diagnoses, with the majority of points on Stomach and Spleenchannels, such as SP-3, SP-4, SP-6, ST-25, and ST_36.326-330 Shallow needling that is more easily tolerated by children has been found to be effective. 331 In addition, acupuncture can induce favorable anatomic and biochemical changes in improving intestinal peristaltic function and in enhancing both humoral and cellular immunity. 331 Acupuncture can be helpful in both the diagnosis and management of acute and chronic diarrhea. Chinese medicine explains acute diarrhea as external Cold and Damp Heat pathogenic invasions, which correlate to viral and bacterial infections. Chronic diarrhea is primarily due to internal imbalances of Spleen and Stomach deficiency and Kidney Yang deficiency. Improper diet can cause both acute and chronic diarrhea. Besides acupuncture treatment, acupressure and massage can be instructed to parents for home treatment programs to help alleviate symptoms and shorten the course of diarrhea. Chinese food recommendations can add another perspective to the dietary management of diarrhea.\n\nAcute diarrhea is best managed with an integrative approach. It is important to obtain the appropriate laboratory studies: stool cultures for bacteria and examinations for ova and parasites-especially in bloody diarrhea or in watery stools of more than 7 days' duration. Antibiotic sensitivity should be determined in order to avoid giving medications indiscriminately. Fluid management with ORT should be part of the immediate treatment regimen. Acupuncture can be used to alleviate pain, to shorten the course by expelling the pathogens, and to strengthen the child's immune system.\n\nThe Stomach and Intestines are prone to Cold invasion, which correlates to viral infection. In this instance, the Cold pathogen enters the Tai Yang or the Yang Ming level. Whereas the Wind-Cold pathogen that affects the respiratory tract enters the Tai Yang Bladder channel to affect the upper part of the body, the diarrhea Cold pathogen enters via the fecal-oral route, i.e. through the gastrointestinal tract and enters the Tai Yang Small Intestine level where sorting of clear from turbid fluid and absorption of fluid takes place. Stools become watery. The Shao Yang level is the Triple Energizer, whose overall function is regulation of body fluids. It is also the parasympathetic nervous system and influences intestinal motility. The next Yang level is the Yang Ming level, the Stomach and Large Intestine. Cold impairs the Yang function of the Stomach, which in turn affects the Yin couplet organ, the Spleen, which influences fluid absorption in the Large Intestine. The \"rotting and ripening of food,\" the transportation and transformation of food and fluid are all affected, resulting in frequent watery stools, often containing undigested food particles. When the Cold pathogen enters the Tai Yin level, it directly injures the Spleen and the diarrhea at this point progresses to a more prolonged course, becoming chronic.\n\nAll stages: Cold can be dispelled by applying warmth to CV-8. Parents can activate their Luogong point, HT-8, by vigorously rubbing their palms together, and placing the warm palm on the child's umbilicus. A warming herb, such as a slice of heat ginger, can be applied to CV-8. The ginger should be slightly heated so that it does not burn the skin.\n\n\u2022 Tui Na: these are best done for children under age 3 years: 1. With thumb extended, massage along radial surface toward wrist 2. Counterclockwise massage of Qiji and Guiwei: Qiji means \"the seven knots or divisions\" and Guiwei means \"the tail of the turtle\"-this is the lower vertebral column from L4 to the coccyx. Massage in a circular motion. This cleanses the body by making the elimination process work better, therefore gets rid of waste products and toxins from the system. 332\n\nThe external Heat pathogen correlates to bacterial infections. It is much more virulent than the Cold pathogen and quickly passes through the Tai Yang Small Intestine and enters the Yang Ming organs, Stomach and Large Intestine. Since Heat usually rises, the presence of Dampness would \"drag\" the Heat downward into the Lower Energizer. External Dampness enters the body by penetrating channels of the legs and flows up to the Spleen where it obstructs its function of transformation and transportation. The child could also have internal Dampness from eating greasy and Phlegm-producing foods, and from existing Spleen deficiency. Damp Heat in the Intestines is injurious to the intestinal wall and blood vessels, interfering with fluid absorption, resulting in diarrhea with mucus and blood. The child may manifest the \"four bigs\" of Yang Ming Heat: big fever, big thirst, big sweating, and big pulse. Fluid and Yin deficiency can occur quickly, so that there is greater risk for dehydration. Diagnosis should be verified with stool culture and sensitivity. Treatment with acupuncture can be given concomitantly with medication, when it is indicated. The rapid progression of dehydration may necessitate intravenous fluid treatment, especially in infants and young children, as the Heat symptoms would result in red tongue and throat and the child would often refuse to drink. \n\nThe Spleen is the most important organ in diarrhea. Spleen impairment can also explain CNSD of infancy and in early childhood. These children may appear \"normal and healthy\" to the Western physician, but may manifest subtle Spleen deficiency signs such as sallow complexion, slight abdominal distension after eating. The Spleen becomes weaker by an infection or a high carbohydrate diet, and diarrhea ensues. It is also interesting to note that apples are considered as energetically Cold foods and therefore injurious to the Stomach and Spleen. Since the Spleen is responsible for reabsorption and movement of fluid, excess juice or fluid intake would overwhelm the Spleen and cause diarrhea. These principles easily explain the association between excess apple juice and CNSD. \n\nEarly morning diarrhea with abdominal pain, and borborygmi during the bowel movement with a feeling of cold indicates Kidney Yang deficiency. Excess Cold and Spleen deficiency can lead to Kidney Yang deficiency. Coldness counteracts the warmth from the \"Fire\" of Kidney Yang. Spleen deficiency accumulates Dampness, which obstructs the movement of fluids, leading to Kidney Yang deficiency. Since the Kidney Yang is the basis of all Yang, Kidney deficiency would in turn cause further Spleen deficiency, and a vicious cycle ensues. Since Kidney corresponds with fear, a careful history can elicit if the child is fearful of something, e.g., failure in academic or athletic performance, or domestic violence. \n\nChildren's diet today often consists of an excess of unhealthy foods that are artificially sweetened, greasy, Phlegm-producing, salty, or energetically too Hot or too Cold for the child's constitution. Spleen deficiency is the most common end-result. Kidney deficiency and Liver Qi stagnation also occur frequently. The internal imbalances can predispose the child to acute episodes of diarrhea. For example, a child with Spleen deficiency develops acute abdominal pain and loose stools after attending a birthday party where cakes and cookies were served in abundance. The child may have other symptoms to indicate deficiency, such as abdominal distension with Spleen Qi deficiency. A progression of imbalances can lead to chronic diarrhea. \n\nDrooling or sialorrhea occurs in normal infants until approximately 6 months of age, when muscular reflexes that initiate swallowing and lip closure are more developed. Later, the irritation of teething may lead to temporary drooling.Z? An estimated 10% of children with neurological impairment, such as cerebral palsy, have excessive drooling that interferes with everyday living. 333 Pathophysiology is primarily due to inefficient swallowing of saliva because of oromotor incoordination and not due to hypersalivation. 334,335\n\nAlthough it is not a serious health problem, drooling is difficult for parents and caregivers who need to constantly change bibs or clothing, and for children who may feel further social isolation with drooling added to their other handicaps.336 Mild cases are usually not treated. More severe cases are managed by medications 337 and various surgical procedures such as submandibular duct relocation 335 and submandibular gland excision. 336,338\n\nThere is little discussion of treatment of drooling in Chinese medicine. The best point appears to be the local point, ST-4,39 which has recently been demonstrated to be effective in treating cerebral palsy children with the application of a biosouth (+) magnet facing downward on the point. 339\n\n\u2022 Treatment of excess Stomach water: sedate ST-44 \u2022 Tonification of Spleen can promote better movement and circulation of fluid:\n\n-Four-point protocol: tonify SP-2, HT-8; sedate SP-l, LR-l -Two points: tonify SP-2; sedate SP-l \u2022 Or use meridian tonification: connect with ion pumping cord black on lower Spleen point, e.g. SP-3 or SP-6; red on SP-9. If using magnets, place bionorth (-) pole facing down on SP-3 or SP-6 and biosouth (+) pole facing down on SP-9 and connect with ion pumping cord as above \u2022 Since the majority of drooling occurs in children with neurologic impairment, which correlates to Kidney deficiency, tonification of Kidney would help improve neurologic function: tonify KI-7, LU-8; sedate KI-3, SP-3 \u2022 Tongue acupuncture has been successful in treating severe drooling and may be tried by an experienced practitioner prior to considering invasive surgical procedures.P'''\n\nAtopic dermatitis (AD), or atopic eczema, is the most common chronic skin condition in children in the industrialized countries.I\"! It affects between 5% and 20% of children from birth to 11 years at one time or other,342 and accounts for 20% of all dermatological referrals. Recent data indicates that prevalence is increasing 342 and many cases persist into adulthood.v''! The precise etiology and pathophysiology is still unknown.P'! Allergy, defined as an exaggerated response of the immune system to external substances, plays a role only in some but not all patients with eczema. 343 Various environmental allergens have been implicated, the most common are grass, tree pollens, the house dust mite, products from pets and other animals, agents encountered in industry, wasp and bee venom, drugs, and certain foods. 342,343 Food intolerance is a better term than food allergy, since many individuals with eczema do not demonstrate an alteration in the immune system with food challenges. 343\n\nRecent research has demonstrated that maternal atopy during pregnancy may have an important effect on the developing immune response of the fetus and may predispose the child to developing allergies. Maternal IgE, IgG and amniotic fluid cytokines, combined with the presence of allergen in the fetomaternal environment are all possible factors that influence infant responses to common environmental antigens. Immune modulation at this stage of development may, in the future, be a way forward in the prevention of allergy. 344 The Canadian Cochrane Database examined preventive studies that prescribed an antigen avoidance diet to high risk mothers during pregnancy and lactation. A high risk woman is one with the atopic disease, and a high risk fetus or infant is one with eczema in the mother, father, or a sibling. Current data seems to suggest that when lactating mothers with high risk infants were given the diet, there is decreased incidence of eczema during the child's first 12-18 months of life,345 whereas a small clinical trial of prescribing the diet to lactating mothers of infants who already have atopic eczema did not significantly affect the severity of the baby's eczema. 345 When a high risk mother was placed on the restrictive diet during pregnancy, there was no reduction in the incidence of giving birth to an atopic child, while such a diet may have had an adverse effect on maternal and/or fetal nutrition. 345 Eczema has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation, ranging from a few patches of dry, pruritic, thickened skin to fulminant, severe, generalized dermatitis that fluctuates between acute flare-up of red, itchy skin with periods of relative quiescence.I''!\n\nAlthough eczema is not life-threatening, the discomfort from the symptoms, the unsightly rash, and chronicity of the condition are distressing to both the child and the parenrs.l\"! The excoriated skin from scratching is susceptible to developing secondary bacterial infection as purulent, weepy impetiginous lesions. Treatment is therefore challenging and complicated, and needs to address not only the physical symptoms, but also the psychosocial impact on the lives of the child and the caregivers. As a result, eczema engenders significant cost for the family and health care systems. 342, 346 The physical manifestations are treated symptomatically, mostly by allergen avoidance and by application of topical steroid. Dermocorticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and reduce itching; they also have immunosuppressive actions. 347 A short course of oral steroids may be prescribed for severe, acute flare-ups. In a few selected cases, in which other methods have failed, immunotherapy with desensitisation or hyposensitisation is recommended. 343 Mild impetigo is usually treated with topical antibiotic ointment. The more severe cases are treated with oral antibiotics\n\nAcupuncture has been found to be successful in treating both the pruritic symptoms 348 and the skin lesions in eczema.348-351 The possible mechanisms include an anti-inflammatory mechanism in minimizing IgE and eosinophils.V! The pathophysiologies of eczema are manifold: an accumulation of Heat and Damp, combined with Blood and Yin deficiency. 350 Multiple organ and channel dysfunction can be involved: Lung, Spleen, Kidney, Liver. Lingering Heat and Damp from previous illnesses, and a diet rich in Damp and energetically Hot foods would predispose children to accumulate Heat and Damp in the skin and in the Blood. The skin in Chinese medicine is part of the Lung, which explains the frequent manifestation of eczema in asthmatics. Spleen deficiency can manifest as accumulation of Damp. A child may have a prenatal predisposition to Dampness and to eczema when there is a strong familial tendency toward Spleen deficiency; when parents engage in excess mental work, have excess worry, or have digestive weakness due to poor diet or alcohol abuse during conception; and when the mother has these experiences during pregnancy. Living in a Damp environment, such as in the basement, close to the ocean, in rainy weather, and eating Damp-producing foods-such as milk products, greasy, fried foods, peanuts, sweets and white sugar-and engaging in excess mental activities can subject the child to Spleen deficiency and to the development of eczema. Although Dampness usually affects the lower part of the body, it can easily enter the Middle Energizer, from there it rises upward to affect the Upper Energizer, the Lung and its corresponding organ, skin. The Lung houses the Corporeal Soul, which gives us the capacity for physical sensations. When the Lung is not in balance, the Corporeal Soul is responsible for the manifestation of excess physical sensations, such as itching in eczema. Kidney and Liver Yin deficiencies can predispose the child to Blood and Yin deficiencies and Heat accumulation that manifest as red and dry skin. Treatment for eczema is directed toward dispersing Heat and Damp in acute flare-ups and tonifying chronic deficiencies. \n\nSince there are immune components to eczema, use the immune protocol to strengthen the child (see Bibliography for further reading on this topic).\n\nNocturnal enuresis, or bed-wetting, is a complex disorder with poorly understood pathogenicity and pathophysiology. It affects children all over the world: 77,352-354 approximately 5-7 million children in the United States 355 and as many as 30% of school-age children in Italy. 353 Enuresis is defined as inappropriate or involuntary voiding during the night at an age when urinary control should be achieved.I? It is classified as primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) when the child has never been dry at night, or secondary nocturnal enuresis (SNE) when wetting follows a dry period usually after an identifiable stress.\"?\n\nThe majority or up to 85% of PNE is monosymptomatic in that the enuresis is not accompanied by other voiding disorders or daytime incontinence. 77, 352, 356 Most children with primary monosymptomatic bedwetting have either a large night-time urine production and a normal bladder capacity, or a small bladder capacity with normal urine production.W By age 8 years, 87-90% of children should have night-time dryness. Enuresis improves with maturity, with a natural, spontaneous remission rate of 15% per year of age. 77 It is possible that different factors may be predominant in different age groups.358 m .....Jatrtc acupuncture\n\nBoth the etiology and pathophysiology of enuresis are still not well understood. There appears to be a wide spectrum of possible pathogenic factors for enuresis: functional/psychological causes, delayed maturation of the central nervous system, genetic predisposition, and infrequently, organic/anatomic dysfunction.\n\nMany investigators consider PNE as a disorder with a strong functional component.359-361 Psychological factors may affect as many as 95% of children with enuresis. 361 It is interesting to note that fear reactions have been reported to be significantly higher in enuretic children. 354,362 Enuresis has been linked to night terror, nightmares, and sleepwalking. 363,364 Most likely, this disorder is a highly complex interaction between somatic and psychiatric factors. 36o eNS Nocturnal enuresis may be due to a maturational lag in the development of the central nervous system. 77 A popular theory posits that there is low nocturnal vasopressin secretion resulting in high nocturnal urine output, which explains why enuretics respond to DDAVP, an exogenous vasopressin. However, there may be a more complex, dual CNS developmental delay in both the afferent and efferent limbs: the central nervous system fails to recognize and respond to bladder fullness or contraction during sleep, and also fails to suppress the micturition reflex arc during sleep. 365 The pathology does not appear to relate to sleep physiology, since the sleep cycle appears normal and enuretic episodes have been found to occur in every sleep stage. 360 There may in fact be a close correlation between biological and psychological factors, in that extreme CNS disorganization may result in psychological symptoms. 366 \n\nSNE accounts for about one quarter of patients with bed-wetting.V! There is significant association of psychiatric problems with SNE,360,371 both causally and reactively following the enuresis. 360 The organic conditions that feature primary enuresis can also be the cause of secondary enuresis. 370 Enuresis has also been associated with behavioral disorders, such as ADHD.372-375 SNE has also been reported with trauma such as car and motor cycle accidents, which may be due to psychological trauma or organic head trauma. 376 SNE has been reported to be associated with upper airway obstruction, which is difficult to explain in the Western paradigm. 377\n\nAlthough the condition is considered benign and mostly self-limiting, treatment is warranted because of adverse personal, family, and psychosocial effects of the disorder. 355,358,378 Nocturnal enuresis delays early autonomy and socialisation due to decrease in self-esteem and self-confidence 356 and fear of detection by peers. 378 The child may be at increased risk for emotional or even physical abuse from family rnembers.V''\n\nThe conventional treatment modalities are still controversial. Since the vast majority of PNE resolves spontaneously with time, treatment should carry minimal or no risk. The moisture alarm is both safe and inexpensive and should be the treatment of choice in most cases 358 but is the least often prescribed. 366 Medical treatment should be placed in a biopsychosocial framework, with medication prescribed in conjunction with psychosocial interventions. 361,379\n\nThe current literature is supportive of acupuncture as a possible treatment modality for the enuretic child. 38o Worldwide reports give validation to acupuncture efficacy in the treatment of enuresis.352.381-391 The reported success rate is as high as 98.2%. 392 Acupuncture has been found to be successful both in decreasing occurrence of enuresis during treatment and in exerting a persistent, long-term effect after treatment. 352,385.386 Parents also report a decrease in sleep arousal thresh-01d. 386 The therapeutic efficacy improves with combined treatment of DDAVP and acupuncrure.P'? Although the precise mechanism of acupuncture is still unknown, a multidisciplinary approach that included acupuncture demonstrated on EEG that treatment normalized activities of the cerebral cortex,389 and an Italian study and a Russian report showed that acupuncture treatment was effective in suppressing uninhibited bladder contractions and decreased bladder instability.390,391 For those children who are fearful of invasive acupuncture, simple acumassage has also been demonstrated to be beneficial to the enuretic child. 393\n\nAlthough it is not possible to precisely correlate the Western diagnosis of enuresis with TCM impressions, PNE can be explained in the acupuncture paradigm as Kidney Yang and Kidney Essence deficiency, and SNE as Spleen and Lung Qi deficiency, and Yin Deficiency.\n\nKidney Yang and Essence encompass wide spheres of vital human functions, among them including Kidney Yang's influence in retention of urine in the bladder; and in production of marrow, the brain; Kidney Esssence correlates to heredity and developmental influences.\n\nKidney Yang enables the Bladder to hold and store urine and warms the Lower Energizer. Constitutional Kidney Yang deficiency results in a cold Lower Energizer, so that Bladder cannot regulate and store water well. This inability to hold urine is worst at night when Kidney Yang is at the lowest level during the Yin part of the diurnal cycle. A characteristic of Kidney Yang deficiency enuresis is the release of large amounts of usually clear urine during sleep. The child and the sheets are soaked and the child may wake up from the sensation of wetness. Along with nocturnal enuresis there may be other signs and symptoms of Kidney Yang deficiency: low pitched voice, facial pallor, cold extremities. Fearfulness and insecurity, the emotions that correspond with the Kidney, are frequently associated with enuretic children. In these children, the tongue may be pale, and the pulse slow, weak, and deep.\n\nKidney Yang deficiency results in insufficient production of marrow, the brain in Chinese medicine, which correlates well to the various postulates of CNS immaturity in Western medicine.\n\nPart of Kidney Essence is pre-Heaven or ancestral, which represents hereditary influences on an energetic level that may translate in biochemical terms as chromosomal loci. Development and maturation of organs are also influenced by Kidney Essence, so that anatomic anomalies and organ dysfunctions may reflect Kidney Essence deficiency.\n\nDevelopmentally, children are in the Water phase of development, so that Kidney and Bladder, the water organs, are most vulnerable.\n\nKidney Yang deficiency can also explain enuresis reported in Western literature that is associated with trauma or surgery: the \"shock\" to the system induces a transient Kidney Yang deficiency that manifests as enuresis.\n\n\u2022 Restrict fluid at and after dinner to decrease urine production \n\nIn Chinese medicine, secondary enuresis that characteristically occurs after a . period of dryness correlates to the presence of Spleen and Lung Qi deficiency. These deficiencies often occur due to poor recuperation after previous illnesses, due to the presence of other illnesses or stress that weaken the digestive and respiratory systems. The Spleen and Lung regulate the body's water and expel excess. Weak Spleen Qi cannot properly carry out the transformation and transportation of fluids. Whereas a healthy Spleen prefers dryness, a weak Spleen retains water. Weak Lung Qi cannot adequately carry out the functions of governing the Qi of the body and regulating body fluid in the Upper Energizer, which in turn interferes with proper water flow down to the Bladder. Nocturnal enuresis ensues. Therefore, TCM explains well the Lung and Kidney relationship that seems baffling to Western medicine. Unlike PNE with Kidney Yang deficiency that typically manifests with copious urine, the enuresis associated with Spleen and Lung deficiency is due to inadequate regulation of fluid with inappropriate water retention, so that this type of bed-wetting characteristically would be of very small volume. Any illness or stress that diverts Qi away from the Lower Energizer would result in SNE: stress from school work, excess playing of computer games, emotional crises such as parental divorce or death of a close family member, could all divert Qi toward the Upper Energizer where it is needed the most. Possible associated symptoms may be facial pallor, poor appetite, lack of thirst, weak muscles, digestive and respiratory symptoms. The tongue is pale and the pulse is thin, deep and slow. \n\nNumerous conditions can lead to secondary Yin deficiency enuresis: all chronic illnesses can eventually lead to Yin deficiency; lingering pathogenic Heat that has not been appropriately expelled with Heat illnesses continue to exhaust Yin; excess consumption of energetically Hot foods, greasy and fried foods. Yin deficiency often manifests as Yang excess syndromes. The most common one in the enuretic child is Yang excess. This can be well explained by the Five-Element Developmental Theory: the child has strong Wood vulnerabilities either because of being in the Wood phase of development or because of having strong Wood tendencies in the Water phase. The heavy sleep that is characteristic of the child can be explained by Ethereal Soul, Hun. The Ethereal Soul resides in Liver Yin, which is constitutionally deficient in children. Hun leaves the body during sleep, and returns upon awakening. When there is Liver Yin deficiency, the Ethereal Soul would wander more at night, resulting in the child being difficult to awaken .. \n\nHuman beings are homeothermic, which means that body temperature is normally maintained within a relatively narrow range, despite wide variations in energy intake and expenditure and environmental temperarure.I?\" The thermoregulatory center is located in the anterior hypothalamus. 395 Normal body temperature ranges from 36.l-37.8'C (97-l00'F), rectal temperature is one degree higher and axillary temperature is one degree lower than body temperature measured by oral thermometer. Children tend to have higher body temperatures than adults, and may have a normal range to as high as 38.5'C (101 'F).\n\nThe fever response can be mediated endogenously and exogenously: endogenous pyrogen is produced by immunologic cells, such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes and phagocytic cells; exogenous pyrogen, such as bacterial endotoxin, produces fever by acting on circulating leukocytes which, in turn, produce and release endogenous pyrogens. 394 Each degree centigrade of fever increases the basal metabolic rate by 10 to 12% and increases basal cellular oxygen consumption by about 13%, with proportionate increase in carbon dioxide production, and requirements for fluid and calories. Elevated body temperature may engender beneficial effects, such as interfering with bacterial reproduction, and accelerating a variety of immunologic responses, such as phagocytosis, leukocyte migration, and lymphocyte transformation. On the other hand, very high fever can impair the immunologic response. The marked increase in insensible water loss requires large volumes of water intake. The increase in cellular energy expenditure requires significant amounts of nutrients. Both of these demands occur when the ill child has diminished oral intake, predisposing the child to dehydration and utilization of substrates contained within body tissues. 394 Fever can also precipitate febrile seizures in the susceptible child between 6 months to 5 or 6 years of age. 396 In children, infection is the most common cause of acute febrile episodes, and inflammatory diseases account for recurrent and persistent temperature e1evation. 397\n\nWestern medicine directs specific treatment toward the disorder that caused the fever, such as antibiotics for an ear infection or an anti-inflammatory drug for IBD, chronic inflammatory bowel disease; and manages fever symptomatically with various cooling measures, extra fluids and antipyretics. Parents and caregivers often manifest \"fever phobia \"398 and are quick to administer medications to control fever. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are two of the most commonly used fever medications in children. 399,400 Aspirin usage is limited by adverse reactions, and the other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have a limited role in pediatrics.t''! The dosage of medication should be carefully calculated according to both the age and weight of the child. However, children are frequently given improper doses, resulting in toxicity or inadequate symptomatic improvement.F''' Some studies have demonstrated that antipyretic therapy may actually prolong influenza A infection. 402 When febrile convulsion occurs, pediatricians in general reassure parents that they are benign, selflimiting, and that long-term prognosis in the vast majority of cases is good. 403 At this time, there are no modalities to increase the child's natural immunity to prevent further susceptibility to febrile illness. Temperature elevation due to hot weather is not considered pathological.\n\nChinese medicine defines fever as Heat accumulation due to external pathogenic invasion or to internal organ imbalances. Current data is in general positive for antipyretic effect of acupuncture. An animal study from Japan demonstrated that e1ectroacupuncture stimulation to the point that corresponds to human LI-l1 exerted an antipyretic effect. 404 Other major antifebrile points studied include GV-14 and ST-36. 405 Research also focuses on elucidation of the mechanisms of antipyretic effects and the potential interaction of acupuncture with drugs. 406 A review from Russia indicates that acupuncture exerts antipyretic effects by triggering adaptive mechanisms that are directed towards correction of disturbances in the homeostatic systems of the body.407 One of these mechanisms may be related to the endogenous opioid system,408 which has been demonstrated to be modulated by acupuncture in pain relief. Other possible antipyretic effects of acupuncture may be modulation of the hypothalamic thermoregularion.w-One study from China suggests that acupuncture stimulation of LI-ll and LI-4 lowered body temperature through decreasing metabolic heat production and cutaneous vasodilatation.fv? An animal study from Russia indicates that when an antipyretic medication is used in combination with acupuncture, its effect is potentiated and lasts longer. 410 Another important question is the effect of acupuncture on immune function in febrile illnesses. One study in China reports that when fever due to Wind-Cold invasion was treated with acupuncture on Dazhui (GV-l4), Fengchi (GB-13), and Quchi (LI-ll), in addition to a significant drop in axillary temperature, sometimes more than lOC, respiratory rate, pulse, and blood pressure also decreased; symptoms were reduced; while the percentage of T-Iymphocytes increased.U! However, an animal study in China using acupuncture on points corresponding to human GV-l4 and LI-ll revealed no change in Wind-Heat fever caused by bacterial endotoxins.tlj A clinical observation in China of pasting herbs on acupuncture points in 72 ill infants revealed an increase in humoral immune substances such as IgA, IgM, IgG. This is a better preventive-prophylaxis-for fever. 4 13 Acupressure can be considered as a potential modality for fever management at home. 4 14 Chinese medicine posits that Heat accumulation in fever is due to either excess Heat or excess Yang with Yin deficiency. The Western medicine finding of children having a higher basal temperature and a tendency toward developing high fever can be easily explained by the TCM concept that children are constitutionally Yin deficient and have a relative abundance of Yang. They are also vulnerable to frequent febrile illnesses which further depletes Yin. The acute fevers are due to external pathogens. Wind-Cold invasion-viral infection-begins to manifest fever in the Shao Yang stage; whereas Wind-Heat invasion-bacterial infection-ean manifest fever from the very beginning during the Wei Qi level. Heat due to hot weather is also considered an external pathogen because it can deplete Yin. Chronic Heat can be due to any disorder that causes Yin deficiency, to continuous consumption of Hot energy foods, to excess emotions that causes Qi stagnation, and may also be due to familial or constitutional predisposition to chronic conditions with underlying Heat disturbance, such as chronic inflammatory diseases.\n\nChinese fever treatment parallels the Western system in symptomatic lowering of fever and expelling the pathogen. In addition, Chinese medicine would tonify Yin and the immune system.\n\n\u2022 Lowering of fever due to any cause: GV-l4, LI-ll \u2022 ST-36 can be used to lower fever and to increase immunity \u2022 Conventional cooling measures such as tepid baths (children should take baths with lukewarm and not cold water, as the sudden chill would cause the child to shiver, which causes compensatory increases in metabolism and further elevation of temperature) \u2022 Eliminate Hot energy foods; increase fluid intake \u2022 Expel pathogen according to stage or level of invasion \u2022 Five-Element four-point Heat treatment if specific organ is identified, e.g, Lung Heat for respiratory illness, Large Intestine Heat for bacterial diarrhea or inflammatory bowel disease \u2022 Tonify Yin \u2022 Tonify immune system.\n\nHeadaches occur in about 40% of preschool children and up to 70% of schoolage children. 415, 416 The guidelines provided in the 55-page International Headache Society (IHS) handbook are widely used in classifying headaches in childhood and adolescence. There is, however, growing concern that the criteria need to be modified to increase sensitivity for pediatric headaches. 417-422 Childhood headaches can be broadly classified as acute or chronic. Acute headaches in children are mostly due to viral illnesses, sinusitis,423 mild head trauma,424 with a small percentage due to bacterial sepsis and meningitis, serious head trauma, or CNS abnormalities, such as brain tumor. 415 The majority of chronic headaches in school-aged children are idiopathic, which means that there is no specific etiology, and the pain is the main symptom and the primary disease entity itself. A small percentage of chronic headaches are secondary to a definite medical condition, such as hypoglycernia.U'' Idiopathic headaches in childhood fall into the migraine, migrainous disorder and tension-type categories. 418,425-427 Stress was the most frequently cited precipitating factor in all types of idiopathic headaches, while weather and environmental factors, and some foods also playa role. 428 Diagnosis and differentiation can be difficult, especially in the very young. 429 Conventional medicine recommends systematic evaluations with careful history taking and neurological examination to identify the primary eti-0Iogy,418,430,431 and diagnostic testing based on individual findings and indications. 432 Although very few studies have evaluated therapy of headache in young patients,432 there is general agreement among medical practitioners that medications are first-line treatment for acute symptoms. 432,433 Appropriate medications are more limited in young children, with older children and adolescents having more options. 433 There is growing emphasis that nonpharmacologic modalities are becoming more important 432,433 so that modalities such as relaxation 434 and acupuncture 435 are being explored.\n\nBecause the etiology of headache can range from a benign, transient condition associated with a viral infection to serious, life-threatening brain tumor, it would be advisable to have an integrative approach in children. A proper neurologic evaluation can be helpful for ruling out significant pathology. In nonlife-threatening headaches, TCM diagnoses and acupuncture treatment can be used either as a primary modality or as an adjunctive therapy to medication or can be incorporated in multidisciplinary approaches that may include relaxation training, change in lifestyle, and diet. Chinese medicine would be especially helpful in the management of \"idiopathic\" headaches that do not have an explanation in Western medicine but can be described as energetic disturbances from either internal or external causes. For those headaches that do have clear Western diagnoses, acupuncture can offer a complementary energetic perspective that can add another dimension to the diagnoses and treatment.\n\nAlthough there are a number of studies on acupuncture treatment of headaches, there is a paucity of data in pediatrics. Many studies on adults are considered flawed scientifically. Nevertheless, available data do seem to support the value of acupuncture for treating headaches.P'' Reports of clinical improvement with acupuncture ranges from 20%437 to approximately 67%438 to as high as 95.6%.439 A few studies report acupuncture as having no effect in prevention of tension-type headachev'\" or making no difference in comparison with sham acupuncture treatment.v'! Paralleling the paucity of research data is the lack of discussion of specific treatment protocols even in currently available pediatric acupuncture textbooks. 242 ,243 Both Western medicine and TCM have very complex classifications for headache. While some diagnoses can be correlated between two disciplines, such as migraine and headaches of acute viral infections, the majority of headaches are difficult to integrate because of very different TCM and Western approaches. This book proposes a classification that incorporates information from classical references, from adult acupuncture books, and from the author's own experience in integrating conventional and TCM pediatrics. This integrated approach broadly categorizes pediatric headaches as acute causes due to external pathogens and chronic, recurrent causes due to internal imbalances.\n\nAcute headaches are due to external pathogenic invasions and to acute head trauma.\n\n\u2022 Wind-Cold-viral syndrome \u2022 Wind-Heat-bacterial infection \u2022 Wind-Damp \u2022 Blood stasis-head trauma.\n\nThe chronic headaches are associated with internal organ imbalance due to various causes: stress, emotional excesses, lifestyle aberrations, dietary imbalance, constitutional vulnerability. They are best classified according to location of headaches in relation to distribution of meridians.\n\n\u2022 Tai Yang-occipital headache \u2022 Shao Yang-lateral side of head and neck; migraines \u2022 Yang Ming-forehead \u2022 Shao Yin-inside the brain \u2022 Tai Yin-heavy and tight sensation as if head is tightly wrapped with a band \u2022 Jue Yin-vertex.\n\nVariable location with history of head trauma.\n\nThe acute onset of headaches in children is usually due to external pathogens-Wind-Cold, Wind-Heat, Dampness-that obstruct Yang channels, resulting in\n\nSince Wind tends to affect the top of the body, headache is a frequent manifestation of both Wind-Cold and Wind-Heat conditions. Wind-Cold or viral infection headache usually affects the Tai Yang channels, the first stage in the six-stage Wind-Cold invasion discussed in Chapter 6. The Cold causes contraction of the channels and decreases defensive Wei Qi circulation, resulting in occipital headache or sense of stiffness in the back of the neck. The diagnosis is easily made, as the headache has an acute onset, and is usually accompanied by other signs and symptoms of Wind-Cold invasion. Further obstruction of Qi circulation in the muscles would lead to generalized myalgia. When Wind-Cold progresses to the Yang Ming stage, the headache becomes more severe and localized to the forehead.\n\nSince Heat also rises in the body, the combination of Wind and Heat causes a sharp, generalized headache. Just as in Wind-Cold invasion, the diagnosis here is easily made as other manifestations of Wind-Heat invasions are usually present. This correlates to bacterial infections, with the more severe forms being sepsis and meningitis.\n\nAcute exposure to Dampness, such as walking barefoot in rainy weather causes Dampness to ascend the leg channels to the Middle Energizer then upward to the head. Dampness obstructs the orifices of the head and prevents clear Yang from reaching the head, so that this type of headache is characterized by a sensation of heaviness.\n\nInjuries are responsible for more deaths in the pediatric age group than all other causes combined,442 and constitute the leading cause of death among US children over 1 year of age. Each year hundreds of thousands of children are seen in an emergency room for head injury. Fortunately, the majority of them are mild 443 which indicates a brief or no loss of consciousness, no abnormalities on radiographic examination, and no neurologic cornplications.v'\" More severe injuries can result in skull fracture, epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, cerebral contusion, and post-trauma seizures. Four-fifths of head traumas are due to accidents, with a mean age of 2.5 years, and the rest are from abuse, occurring primarily in infants, with a mean age of 0.7 years. 44S Skull fracture and intracranial injury are common among children younger than 2 years of age. 446 At this time, there are no formal criteria for obtaining laboratory studies or for admitting children with head trauma,447 so that each institution has its own standards for evaluating pediatric head injury.\n\nChinese medicine considers a blow to the head as the cause of Blood stasis in the area of the trauma. This may result in localized or generalized headache. In mild cases, the headache resolves within a matter of hours or days. In more severe cases of head trauma, such as those associated with concussion, a brief loss of consciousness, or with epidural or subdural hematomas, children may not immediately complain of headache. Acute head trauma is best evaluated with the help of Western evaluation and technology. Head injury with abnormal neurological examination and positive laboratory substantiation, such as findings on skull X-ray, computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans of the head, usually indicates serious trauma and the child often needs to be hospitalized for close observation and for further interventions.\n\nChronic, recurrent headaches are due to impairment of Qi and Blood flow to the internal organ. The various causes include stress, emotional excesses, lifestyle aberrations, dietary imbalance, or constitutional vulnerability. Headache manifests along the path of the meridians to the head, so that the location of the headache would indicate pathogenic imbalance.\n\nSix specific categories of information are important for assessing chronic headaches:\n\n1. Location 2. Characteristics -Yang type: sharp, throbbing, presence of aura, relief with rest, aggravated by activity -Yin type: dull, achy, relief with activity 3. Relationship to food-types of food, manner of eating, e.g., spicy foods, caffeine; eating while working 4. Association with emotions that correspond to specific organs 5. Initial episode that precipitated the headache, such as exposure to Wind-Cold. Recurrence of headache is now associated with exposure to Cold along the Tai Yang channels 6. Evolution of headache-the relationship between the initial episode and current complaint is important to map out. For example, the first episode was precipitated by Wind-Cold invasion. The child now presents with Shao Yang type with exposure to Cold. The history reveals that the gradual evolution of symptoms along the Five-Element Cycle, and Shao Yang headache develops as a result of inadequate Water to nourish Liver Yin, resulting in Liver Yang excess headache. The treatment needs to address the root or the initiating factor as well as correct the current imbalances.\n\nA Tai Yang headache occurs along the Bladder Tai Yang channel. In acute instances, this is the result of Wind-Cold in the Tai Yang stage of invasion. Chronic, recurrent Tai Yang is compatible with the Western diagnosis of tension headache. However, taking a careful TCM history is very important in these cases. If Cold is not properly expelled from the Bladder channel during an acute invasion, Cold can chronically lodge in the Tai Yang channels, predisposing the child to Tai Yang headache each time the back of the neck is exposed to Cold. This headache occurs without the full development of Wind-Cold or viral illness. The child would also be vulnerable to developing tension headaches due to tightening of neck muscles that are already contracted by Cold. Tension headaches occur in as many as one-third of childhood headaches.t'\" and may present as sharp attacks that are sometimes difficult to distinguish from migraine without aura. Tai Yang headaches are usually less intense, do not have emotional components, and usually do not have gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.\n\nShao Yang headaches that occur on the lateral side of the head and neck correlate to the Western diagnosis of classic migraine, considered the most common headache in childhood. 418,425-427 Migraine affects as many as 5-10% of all children 449 and may represent as high as 54% of pediatric headaches. 448 The acute episodes can be triggered by numerous factors: emotional upset; stresssuch as school pressure, lack of sleep; sensory stimulation-such as loud noise, bright light; and sympathetic stimulation-such as sports, physical exercise.P\" Headache is sometimes preceded by a visual or sensory aura. The characteristic attack consists of severe, throbbing or pulsating pain-usually unilateral but in children often bilateral-frequently accompanied by digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) and sometimes hypersensitivity to light and sound. 45o The duration is 4-72 hours in adults, and 2-48 hours in children under age 15. 417 Various hypotheses have been proposed for pathophysiology of migraine, but the precise mechanism is still poorly understood. The headache appears to involve both central and peripheral structures. There is vasodilatation and vasoconstriction of the neurovascular system,417 possibly due to inflammation of cerebral arteries. 451,452 There may be altered neuronal excitability in the CNS.453 Recent evidence suggests involvement of catecholamines,454,455 serotonin,456 and of some neuropeptides. 457,458 There is increasing focus on the role of dopamine, both in the prodromal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, drowsiness) and in the headache phase with pain perception and cerebral blood f1ow. 459,460 Migraine in children is often associated with abdominal pain 453 and cyclical vomiting. 461,462 A strong family history is supported by the finding of a dopamine receptor gene locus in migrainous patients with aura. 451, 459 Separation of migraine without aura from episodic tension-type headache may be difficult. The most important differential characteristics of migraine are the intensity of pain, association with emotions, aggravation by physical activity, and presence of nausea and vomiting. 425 Adolescents usually have migraine with aura and tension headaches, whereas younger children tend to present with migrainous-like headaches aggravated by physical activity, sometimes accompanied by phorophobia.v'?\n\nMuch has been written about the \"migraine personality,\" or the emotional make-up of the headache sufferers. These patients have a high prevalence of various neurotic and even psychotic symptoms: 463 excessive striving for tidiness and for perfection in performance,464 exaggerated tendency in pain perception, in self-criticism;465 and in symbiotic attachment to their own families. 464 They are at increased risk for comorbid affective and anxiety disorder: generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-eompulsive disorder; phobic disorder,466 and depression. 464,466 Pediatric and adolescent patients have been found to be emotionally rigid with a tendency to repress anger and aggression.W Migraine in children and adolescents is extremely disabling, causing loss of school days and extracurricular activities. 449,468 Rest and often sleep bring relief. Western treatment is mainly with medication, ranging from over-thecounter analgesics to specific oral and intramuscular injections of antimigraine medications for acute attacks and daily prophylactic pharmacotherapy. There is no wonder drug in sight. Effective treatments for both acute episodes and for prevention are therefore urgently needed.\n\nIn Chinese medicine, classic migraine is a Shao Yang headache because of the location along the distribution of the Gallbladder meridian on the temple or side of the head. The cause is usually due to the pathology in the couple Yin organ Liver: Liver Yang or Fire rising. Liver is one of two Yin channels (the other being the Heart channel) that flows directly to the head internally. (All the other Yin channels reach the head via divergent channels.) The typical Liver Yang rising headache is the classic migraine of intense, throbbing, pulsating pain, usually along one side, but may involve both sides of the head along the Gallbladder channel, to the temples, or behind the eyes. The visual aura described in Western medicine can be explained by Liver Yang excess blocking Qi flow to the eyes, the external orifices of Liver. Gastrointestinal disturbances, such as nausea and vomiting, are due to Liver Qi invading the Stomach and preventing Stomach Qi from its normal downward movement.\n\nVarious emotions that can trigger migraine attacks correspond to emotions that are directly associated with Liver as well as emotions associated with other organs and indirectly affect the Liver through the Five-Element Cycle. Liver Yang excess manifests as anxiety, anger, frustration, resentment. Kidney deficiency corresponds to fear, and in extreme cases depression, panic and paranoia. Spleen deficiency corresponds to worry and obsession. All chronic emotions eventually affect the Heart, which in turn can manifest as disturbance in self-perception and attachment. Various dietary indiscretions can also trigger migraines. Excessive sour foods can weaken the Liver: yogurt, grapefruit and its juice, sour apples, lemon, pickles, vinegar, spinach, rhubarb, gooseberries, redcurrants; excess Hot energy foods can cause Liver Fire: curries, spices, pepper (black, white, or red), red meat, alcohol. Caffeine in soft drinks and chocolate is a frequent cause of migraine in children.\n\nHereditary and constitutional vulnerability due to prenatal factors, such as stress, anger, excess alcohol or drug abuse of both parents at the time of conception or of the mother during pregnancy; weak pre-Heaven Essence and familial Liver imbalance can contribute to Liver Yin deficiency and Liver Yang excess in the child.\n\nLiver Yang excess can also be due to imbalances in the other Elements, especially the Lung Qi. Excess worry weakens the Spleen and knots Qi, which can in turn affect Lung and Heart Qi. Spleen deficiency would lead to Lung deficiency, as there is insufficient Earth to nurture Metal. Lung deficiency would allow Liver Yang to rise, since there is insufficient Metal to control Wood. Reports on acupuncture treatment are usually favorable for adult migraines. The few studies that include children appear to show promise for acupuncture as a pediatric treatment modality. Several studies propose the possible biochemical effects of acupuncture on migraine as normalization of increased and slightly decreased levels of serotonin,456 and in affecting serum catecholamine levels. 439,456 Needling LR-3 alone has been demonstrated to affect breakdown of catecholamine.V'\" Increased activity of the opioid system has also been dernonstrated.f?\" An animal study posits that efficacy of SI-17 lies in its antiinflammatory effects on blood vessels of the dura mater; it brings about inhabitation of the neurogenic inflammation on the affected side. 471 Acupuncture has been shown to be effective for both acute migraine attacks 472,473 and for prophylaxis. 473-476 When TCM principles are used to differentiate headaches, acupuncture can significantly improve symptoms and even cure migraines.V? The long-term effect of reduction in frequency, duration, and intensity after treatment can persist for months and even many years,478,479 or with up to 50% decrease in drug intake. 476 The effect of acupuncture was comparable to some of the potent antimigraine medications but does not cause any negative side-effects.f\" In a well-controlled randomized study of childhood migraine, acupuncture treatment significantly reduced both migraine frequency and intensity.47o\n\nA multidisciplinary approach that included acupuncture, dietary changes, medication, physical therapy, lifestyle adaptations, was effective in treating the majority of patients with various types of migraine-related dizziness and vertigo. 480 Age, sex, social status, and expectations of benefit did not show any relation to treatment efficacy, but those with fewer emotional issues reported a better response.t''! Acupuncture has been demonstrated to be efficacious even for \"German migraine.\" Germany is a unique country with reported 12 % 482 to as many as 25% of the population afflicted with migraine. 482 The symptoms tend to be severe: sudden onset of usually unbearable headache that can last for up to 72 hours and can be accompanied by vegetative symptoms,483 and can occur frequently. Patients often take numerous analgesics for symptomatic relief but suffer various side-effects. Acupuncture has been successful both for ameliorating acute symptoms and for prophylactic treatment. 482,483\n\nAccording to Western medicine, frontal headache is usually associated with sinusitis 484 and occurs in older children after the frontal sinuses are formed. In Chinese medicine, headache located on the forehead generally indicates a Yang Ming Stomach imbalance, usually due to dietary indiscretions. Recurrent, sharp frontal headache can be caused by Stomach Heat, Stomach Qi obstruction, and food retention. When children consume too much red meat, spicy and fried foods, Stomach Heat accumulates and rises along the Stomach meridian to the forehead. Overeating weakens the Spleen and obstructs Stomach Qi; while eating too quickly or while studying may lead to food retention. Both of these can lead to sharp, frontal headache.\n\nMigraine in children is frequently characteristically Yang Ming: frontallocation accompanied by abdominal pain. 450 In recent years there is increasing advent of Yang Ming headache in children who spend long hours in front of a computer monitor. The eye strain and continuous electromagnetic stimulation to the Yintang point can lead to frontal headaches. A dull, achy frontal headache is caused by a deficiency of Stomach Yin, which occurs when children eat irregularly or eat very late at night.\n\nThis headache is characterized by a heavy and tight sensation as if the head is wrapped with a band. The pain is usually dull and achy, can be generalized or localized to the forehead. Western medicine reports that when patients regularly take analgesics, this type of headache occurs with drug with-drawa1. 485 Chinese medicine attributes the cause of Tai Yin headache to Spleen deficiency with accumulation of Dampness in the head. There may be other Spleen deficiency signs, such as poor muscle tone, fatigue, and digestive problems.\n\nA child may have a predisposition to Tai Yin headache when there is a strong familial tendency toward Spleen deficiency; when parents engage in excess mental work, have excess worry, or have digestive weakness due to poor diet or alcohol abuse during conception; and when the mother has these experiences during pregnancy. Factors that precipitate the headache consist of living in a Damp environment, eating excess Damp-producing foods, and engaging in excess mental activities. Living in a Damp environment, such as in the basement, close to the ocean, in rainy weather; and eating Damp-producing foods, such as milk products, greasy, fried foods, peanuts, sweets and white sugar can lead to Spleen deficiency. Although Dampness usually affects the lower part of the body, it can easily enter the Middle Energizer, from there it rises upward and obstructs the orifices that clear the head. Dampness then accumulates in the head, resulting in an achy, heavy sensation.\n\nTai Yin headache also occurs with excess mental activities. Today's children are faced with increasing pressures to perform academically while also participating in numerous extracurricular activities. From an early age, many children keep a busy schedule without getting adequate rest. Young students in middle school are often studying late into the night and are already beginning to worry about college competition, especially when they have parents with unrealistically high expectations. Excess mental activities, combined with worry and lack of sufficient sleep, can severely weaken the Spleen Qi.\n\nChildren frequently describe the headache as just \"pain inside the whole head.\" Western medicine does not have a diagnosis for this nonspecific type of pain, while Chinese medicine considers these as Shao Yin headaches due to Kidney and Heart deficiency. Characteristically, Shao Yin headache is a dull, achy pain in the whole head. It may also concentrate on the occiput, like tension headache. Since Kidney Essence nourishes the brain, a lack of nourishment in Kidney deficiency would manifest as dull, achy, generalized headache accompanied by a feeling of emptiness in the head. Other Kidney deficiency signs, such as enuresis, frequent urination, and lack of vitality, may accompany this type of headache.\n\nSeveral factors can predispose a child to Shao Yin headache: (1) a strong familial tendency toward Kidney deficiency; (2) a father with history of promiscuity (Jing or Essence is lost through ejaculation) and a mother with polymenorrhea, history of miscarriages, or multiple pregnancies especially close together; (3) fear in either or both parents during conception; (4) studying long hours without adequate rest weakens Spleen Qi and in the long run, Kidney Yin; this is the most common cause of Yin deficiency in Western industrial societies and therefore also in children; (5) too much salty foods, such as tinned or processed foods often heavily salted; bacon, sausages, cereals, tinned soups, smoked fish, (pretzels, chips-both salty and greasy); (6) a chronic state of anxiety and fear can deplete the Kidney; (7) shock suspends Qi and can cause Kidney Qi and jing deficiency.\n\nShao Yin headache can also be due to Heart deficiency, which can manifest as generalized dull, achy pain inside the head or localized on the forehead area. The child may have a bluish tinge on the forehead and chin, and may manifest other Heart deficiency symptoms, such as dream-disturbed sleep, nervousness, difficulty with concentration. The young child under age 3 may also wake up crying at night. Several factors can predispose the child to Heart deficiency: (1) A familial tendency toward Heart or Shen disorders; (2) any excess emotions that both parents felt during conception-since all emotions eventually affect the Heart-eould result in Heart weakness in the child; (3) if the mother experiences physical Heart disorder or excess emotions during pregnancy, especially if there is any major physical or emotional experience that constitute a \"shock\" to the maternal system, can also cause Heart deficiency in the fetus; (4) excess worry can knot Heart Qi; (5) shock can also affect Heart Qi; (6) excess consumption of bitter foods or medications.\n\nThe typical Jue Yin headache occurs at the vertex, the top of the head. This is most often due to metabolic imbalances, such as hypoglycemia, or when children adhere to a strict diet or are anorexic. The insufficient nourishment results in general deficiency of Qi and Blood that is felt as pain at the top of the head.\n\nChronic headaches can be due to severe accidents and falls causing Blood stasis in a particular area of the head. While some children may experience pain immediately following the trauma, many children may not complain of headache until years later. This is usually a localized headache that correlates with area of trauma. Sometimes, there may be a small purple spot near the tip of the tongue to indicate Blood stasis in the head. The injury creates a vulnerability for the particular channel or channels that circulate through the area of trauma, so that headache may be precipitated by physical or emotional factors specific for those meridians. For example, a child may fall on the side of the head and be mildly concussed. The child has transient headache immediately after the trauma. Many years later, the slightest anger or frustration would cause a sharp Shao Yang headache to occur. \n\nFor all external Wind pathogenic invasions, keep the child's occiput and back of the neck warm by wearing a scarf or a coat with a hood during cold and rainy weather. Treat the three major Wind \"Feng\" acupoints to expel Wind in the head: GV-16, GB-20, BL-12.\n\nWind-Heat\n\nBlood Stasis \n\nHiccups are due to brief, powerful involuntary spasms and contraction of the diaphragm and the auxiliary respiratory muscles during inspiration, followed by glottic closure. The movement of inspiratory air is rushed, producing a typical \"hiccupping\" sound. 493,494 Chronic hiccups is defined as recurrent episodes of hiccups or a duration exceeding 48 hours. 494 Hiccups is a physiologic gastrointestinal reflex that already exists in utero, 494 and appears to still occur frequently in young infants. 493 A possible etiology includes gastro-esophageal reflux,494 or secondary to feeding gastrostomy,495 tracheostomy,494 and intubation. 493 While the physiologic effect from hiccups is generally considered negligible,494 upper airway obstruction has been found in unintubated, young infants;493 and respiratory alkalosis in tracheostomy''Ptand gastrostorny'v\" patients.\n\nThe majority of acute episodes of hiccups are self-limiting. Numerous remedies have been reported over the centuries, no single \"cure\" stands out as being the most effective. 496 Various home remedies include telling the child to hold his breath for as long as possible; or breathing in and out of a paper bag (a confined space)-both of which induce elevated levels of pC0 2 to stimulate respiration. Chronic and recurrent hiccups may be treated with medication, the most common being Baclofen. 494,495 More aggressive treatments in adults, such as the calcium channel blocker Nifedipine,497 crushing of the phrenic nerve, or microvascular decompression of the vagus nerve 498 are not indicated in children.\n\nHiccups in Chinese medicine is due to rebellious Stomach Qi that disrupts the descent of Lung Qi during inspiration. Various causes that are applicable in children include improper eating and diet, such as eating too fast 499 or eating excessive Cold and raw foods,499,500 Liver Qi stagnation, such as from emotional disturbances and prolonged illnesses that result in insufficient Qi in the Middle Energizer. 501 Body points 39,499-501 auriculopoints502-504 and other microsystem points 505,506 have all been used for treatment of hiccups.\n\nSince children are not usually seen for acute episode of hiccups, acupressure of body points can be taught to the parents to administer during an attack. If the child is seen for recurrent or chronic hiccups, south pole, tonification magnets can be applied to the body points, and pellets can be applied to microsystem ear points. \n\nThe human immune response is an extremely complex cascade of events that involves numerous different types of immune factors and biochemical mediators. The immune system can be broadly divided into humoral and cellular compartments. The humoral response refers to complement and immunoglobulin antibody-mediated B-cell system. The cellular response refers to delayed hypersensitivity mediated via T-cells, which consist of a wide variety of cells that include leukocytes, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, and natural killer cells. This classification is not precise, as there is a great deal of interaction and cross over of functions. Recent studies have focused in depth on the pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and leukotrienes. These mediators are a heterogeneous group of biochemical compounds produced by a gamut of cells that includes epithelial cells, fibroblasts, PMNs, and macrophages. They trigger or orchestrate an immune response by acting as signals between cells of the immune system, leading to inflammatory responses against pathogens. Neurotransmitters in the CNS and nutrition also actively participate in the immune response. While an immune reaction can be protective to the host, a hyperimmune response can be destructive by damaging normal structures so that regulatory process is necessary to prevent \"immunologic runaway.\"394 Immune deficiency is associated with recurrent infections, malnutrition, trauma, and immaturity of the immune system. Children with recurrent infections often manifest immune insufficiency.509,510 Abnormalities of the local defense mechanisms of the upper airways are very comrnon.U! Poor nutrition, especially a diet low in protein, can cause both humoral and cellular deficiencies. Iron, trace minerals and vitamin deficiencies can all affect the child's immune system.512-518 Trauma can induce a potent inflammatory response. 519,520 Even hemorrhage alone may be a sufficient stimulus to activate the immune system. 519 Infants and young children have immature immune systems and are at greater risk for infections. 513,521 Neonates especially have very inadequate immune systems so that they are vulnerable to infections and often respond poorly to vaccines. [522] [523] [524] [525] [526] While inadequate immune responses predispose children to illnesses and infections, current data also suggest that hyperactive immune or inflammatory responses are possibly due to poor regulatory control and result in destruction of normal tissues. Asthma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer are some of the chronic disorders attributed to uncontrolled hyperimmune response to an initial stimulus. There is evidence which suggests that juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is caused by T-cell infiltration of the synovial membrane. 527,528 Cardiovascular disease in children, such as rheumatic heart disease, are secondary immune response to infections. 529 The presence of pro-inflammatory mediators in diabetes suggests that a hyperinflammatory response to an infection causes pancreatic beta cell destruction. 530,531 Increased levels of mediators have also been found in cancer. 532 Recognition of the significance of pro-inflammatory mediators has generated fervent development of immune modulatory treatments. These treatments are costly and only a few are approved for usage in children.\n\nThere is no medication that induces natural immune defense or regulation.\n\nWestern medicine also considers the skin, lungs, and liver to be immune organs. The skin is a protective organ. The lungs have important B-cell secretion of antibodies and T-cell mediated immune responses to foreign antigens. 533 The liver hepatocytes produce acute-phase proteins and complement in bacterial infections. Many cells participate in a T-cell immune response against bacterial infections and hematogenous tumor metastases. 534\n\nChinese medicine traditionally incorporates strengthening of the immune system as part of the treatment of children. The immune system in TCM is Wei Qi, the Defensive Qi. Whereas the refined Nutritive Qi flows internally in the channels and Blood vessels, Wei Qi is the coarser form of Qi that flows exteriorly during the day and resides in the Liver at night. Wei Qi circulates outside the channels, in the skin and connective tissues, controls the opening and closing of the pores, and acts like a \"shield\" to protect the body against external pathogens. The Defensive Qi is intimately related to the Kidney, as it is influenced by Essence and transformed by Kidney Yang. It is nourished by the digestive organs, Stomach and Spleen, which supply the Food Qi. It is regulated by the Lung during the day. At night, it resides primarily in the Liver, which directs its flow to all the Yin organs.\n\nWhen the body first contracts an infection, the external pathogen is in the superficial layers-the Wei Qi level of Wind-Heat invasion and Tai Yang level of Wind-Cold invasion. Treatment is directed toward expelling the pathogen and strengthening the body, i.e., chasing out the burglar and closing the windows and bolting the doors. At this time, there is ample biochemical support in the literature to indicate that acupuncture activates both the humoral and cellular immune systems to protect the host, as well as regulate a hyperinflammatory response. 531 Acupuncture treatment has been demonstrated to stimulate humoral immune factors. [535] [536] [537] [538] Animal studies demonstrated that when acupuncture points that correspond to human CV-2 and HT-8 were stimulated, an active humoral response ensues. 539 Acupuncture also significantly enhanced T-cell population and activities in both clinical and animal studies. 536, [540] [541] [542] [543] [544] There can be an increase in lymphocyte proliferation-t\" in phagocytosis 545,546 or in enhanced killer cell cytotoxicity.547 There may be a close relationship between the Stomach meridian and mast cell population, since stimulation of many Stomach points seem to result in an increase in mast cells. 548 An animal Common pediatric condftlons 245 study using a point that corresponds to BL-23, the Kidney Shu point, increased T-cell activities.I''! Acupuncture can improve immune function in traumainduced immunosuppression. 544,549 Noninvasive laser acupuncture, which is well tolerated by children, was demonstrated to positively affect both humoral and cellular immunity.536,550 Acupuncture has also been shown to affect the nervous system arm of the immune response. 535 Animal studies have demonstrated increased immunity with stimulation of the catecholaminergic 538,540,551,552 and serotonergic neurons. 538 The immune response may also be mediated via the autonomic nervous system. 553 Acupuncture seems to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system,554 resulting in activation of the release of helper T-cells from the bone marrow. 555 In fact, stimulation of the Kidney Shu point, BL-23, has been demonstrated to stimulate T-cells. 541 While acupuncture stimulates the immune response as a protective mechanism, it also appears to exert a regulatory effect on hyperinflammation. Acupuncture seems to be able to modulate the synthesis and release of proinflammatory mediators. 540,556,557 Current hypotheses suggest that there is a common pathway connecting opioids and the immune system. 535, 544, 546, 549, 558 Acupuncture is well known for its efficacy in the treatment of pain. Acupuncture analgesia is mediated through the stimulation of large myelinated nerve fibers which conduct the impulse to the spinal cord and higher centers. Opioids such as endorphins are released to block the ascending pain signals. It is possible that along with the opioids, other neurotransmitters that modulate the inflammatory response, such as substance P and serotonin, are also released. 559 Magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated the coupling of pain and immune processes via the same afferent and efferent signals. 56o Acupuncture immunomodulation may also be mediated through the release of acetylcholine from the parasympathetic nerve endings. 561 Animal studies have also demonstrated specific immune effects of acupuncture in various conditions. Acupuncture treatment minimizes the hyperinflammatory response in asthma,562 stabilizes mast cells of gastric ulcer,563 reduces anticollagen-specific antibody level,564 enhances the cellular immune functions in cancer,565-567 and diminishes inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. 564\n\nThe most frequently used overall immune point is Zusanli 271, 535, 546, 548, 556, 557, 564, 565, 568, 569 followed by Hegu LI-4. Other points include Lanweixue, Dazhui 568 Bladder Shu points,271 and even local points for specific conditions, such as LI-20 for rhinitis. 569 Since the majority of pediatric illnesses are acute infections, the simple \"immune tonification\" protocol can be carried out along with expelling the pathogen while the invasion is still in the superficial stages or levels. In chronic illnesses, such as inflammatory bowel disease, the priority of treatment is to first balance the internal organs, and add immune tonification points as adjunctive therapy. \n\nChronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprised of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is now being recognized with increasing frequency in children of all ages,570 and has become one of the most significant chronic diseases affecting children and adolescents.V! IBD presents unique challenges for diagnosis and management because physically and psychosocially developing children often do not present with the classic symptoms. 572 Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are probably syndromes rather than single entities,573 since they share many similarities in epidemiology, immunologic, clinical and therapeutic characteristics. 255\n\nTwenty-five to 30% of all patients with CD and 20% of those with UC present before age 20. 574 Four percent of pediatric IBD occurs before the age of 5 years, with a peak age of onset in the late adolescent years. 572 In North America, the incidence for 10-to 19-year-olds is approximately 2 per 100000 for UC and 3.5 per 100000 for CDP5 The incidence of IBD is worldwide.F'' primarily occurring in industrialized countries with well-nourished populations. 255 The possible environmental risks include lack of breast feeding or early weaning, perinatal infections and \"Western diet\" with high fatty acid intake. 255 Although infectious gastroenteritis may be the triggering event,572 there is no convincing or direct evidence that links an infectious agent with IBD.255 There is strong evidence for genetic influence-?\" and specific loci on chromosomes have been identified. 578,579 Currently, the dominant view of IBD pathophysiology is hyperactive immune response of the gastrointestinal mucosa to triggering factors present in the gut lumen, resulting in chronic inflammation and ensuing tissue injury.255\n\nColonic malignancy is a major complication of both UC and CD patients with pancolitis beginning in childhood.V\" The chronic, lifelong disease process also leads to significant psychosocial impact on the child and adolescent.V!\n\nCrohn's disease has an equal incidence in boys and girls. 575 Thirty percent of children have a positive family history.575 In addition to the environmental triggers for IBD, tobacco smoking seems to affect the familial type of CD. 582 The enteric pathology in CD is transmural inflammation, which is characteristically asymmetric and segmental with skipped areas. Granulomas are pathognomonic for the disorder. Any segment of the bowel may be involved: aphthous ulcerations can occur in the mouth, esophagus, stomach or duodenum;255 and perianal lesions including skin tags, fissures, fistulas and abscesses 583 can occur in 15% of pediatric patients with CD. 583 The majority of children (50-70%) with CD have involvement in the terminal ileum, with more than half of these patients also having inflammation in variable segments of the colon, usually the ascending colon. 255,584 Ten to 20% of children have isolated colonic disease, and 10-15% have diffuse small bowel disease involving the more proximal ileum or jejunum. 570 The clinical presentation of CD depends on the part of the gastrointestinal tract involved. The majority of the time, the child presents with small intestine symptoms, consisting of recurrent, poorly localized abdominal pain; chronic diarrhea; lassitude; late afternoon and evening low-grade fever, anorexia; and weight loss of several months' duration. 255,570 CD involving the colon may be clinically indistinguishable from DC, with symptoms of bloody, mucopurulent diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, and urgency to defecate. 255\n\nGrowth failure, seen in 30% of pediatric CD,572 is a disconcerting problem in young children 585,586 and in the adolescent whose sexual development may be delayed. 572 Growth deceleration is usually insidious, and may precede the onset of intestinal symptoms by years,587 thereby delaying diagnosis. 588 Inadequate nutrient intake, anorexia, malabsorption, increased losses, and increased metabolic demands all contribute to poor growth. 57o\n\nThe transmural inflammation leads to bacterial overgrowth and the formation of fistulas and strictures that can cause obstruction. The risk of adenocarcinoma of the colon for Crohn's colitis is 4 to 20 times that of the general population.V'' Perianal disease may precede the appearance of the intestinal manifestations of CD by years, and is seen most commonly in patients with colitis. When perianal disease does not respond to medical therapy, surgical management is necessary.\n\nDC is a diffuse, chronic inflammation restricted to the mucosal lining of the rectum and large intestine, and extends proximally in a symmetric, uninterrupted pattern to involve parts or all of the large intestine. 589 The rectum is involved in more than 95% of cases. 255 In addition to the environmental triggers for IBD, DC patients report a higher incidence of cows' milk allergy. 255 The most common presenting symptoms are rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Children usually have more extensive disease at the time of diagnosis than adults. 589 Mild disease is seen in 50-60% of DC, characterized by increased mucosal blood flow with erythema and mucosal edema, which can lead to granularity and friability, resulting in spontaneous bleeding. The disease is usually confined to the distal colon, the child does not have any systemic signs and symptoms.\n\nThirty percent of pediatric patients present with moderate disease characterized by bloody diarrhea, cramps, urgency to defecate, and abdominal tenderness. Systemic signs, such as anorexia, low-grade fever, and mild anemia, may be present. Fifteen percent of pediatric DC patients have growth failure.\n\nSevere colitis occurs in approximately 10% of patients, presenting with more than six bloody stools per day, abdominal tenderness, fever, anemia, leukocytosis, and hypoalbuminemia. In less than 5% of pediatric patients, DC may present with extraintestinal manifestations, such as arthropathy, skin manifestations, or liver disease. 255,590\n\nThe major gastrointestinal complications of UC are massive bleeding, toxic megacolon, and carcinoma. Toxic megacolon is rare in young patients, but is a medical and surgical emergency because there is a high risk for colonic perforation, gram-negative sepsis, and massive hemorrhage.F\" Children who develop UC before 14 years of age have a cumulative colorectal cancer incidence rate of 5% at 20 years and 40% at 35 years. 592 Children who develop the disease between 15 and 39 years of age have a cumulative incidence rate of 5% at 20 years and 30% at 35 years. Therefore, it is estimated that there is an 8% risk of dying from colon cancer 10 to 25 years after diagnosis of colitis if the disease symptoms are not controlled. 593\n\nTwenty-five to 35% of patients with CD or UC have at least one extraintestinal manifestation, which may be diagnosed before, concurrently with, or after the diagnosis of IBD is made. 594 Skin manifestations, aphthous ulcers in the mouth, ocular findings such as uveitis, arthritis (occurring in 7-25% of pediatric patients), hepatobiliary disease, urologic complications including renal stones (occurs in approximately 5% of children with IBD), and hydronephrosis have been reported.V? Rarely, arthritis can be the first and sometimes only initial symptom for months to years in children with IBD.572 CD also has characteristic erythema nodosum (raised, red, tender nodules that appear primarily on the anterior surfaces of the leg, and affects 3% of children).595 It is estimated that 75% of patients with erythema nodosum ultimately develop arthritis. 596\n\nPhysical examination and initial laboratory evaluations can all be nonspecific. Once infectious causes have been ruled out, it is best to refer the child to a pediatric gastroenterologist for further diagnostic evaluation, which would include flexible colonoscopy with colonic and terminal ileal biopsy specimens. The flexible, smallcaliber endoscopes allow colonoscopic evaluation of pediatric patients of all ages, including infants,597 by direct visualization and biopsy of the colon and terminal ileum. An upper gastrointestinal with small bowel follow-through X-ray contrast study is performed on younger children, whereas double-contrast radiography (enteroclysis) is the state-of-the-art technique for examining fine mucosal details to detect early ulceration in the small bowel in older children. When there is suspicion of abscesses and fistulas in CD, computerized tomography and ultrasonography are useful additional studies. 57o The pediatric CD activity index, which includes growth parameters, was developed in 1990 and validated at 12 pediatric gastrointestinal centers as a scoring system for diagnosing CD. At this time, a disease activity index is being developed for pediatric Uc. 598\n\nThe general goals of treatment for children with IBD are to achieve control of the inflammatory process, to promote growth through adequate nutrition, and to permit the child to function as normally as possible, such as attending school or participating in sports. 570 Nutrition is a very important part of management since growth failure is a major concern.F? Recommendations for nutritional therapy include an increase in energy and protein intake to 150% of recommended daily allowances for height and age. Some studies recommend nocturnal nasogastric infusion as supplements of daily intake. Nutritional support has been shown to be as effective as steroids in achieving remission of disease in children. 572, 586, 599 Antibiotics may be helpful in CD. Omega-3-fatty acids has been shown to reduce relapse rates. 600 Various pharmacologic agents are being used in IBD. Recently, there is growing preference for immunosuppressive therapies 255,601-603 for controlling the hyperactive mucosal immune system. Steroids are used in acute flare-ups, but are usually not beneficial in maintaining longterm remission in CD.604,605 Growth retardation can occur in children even with small doses of steroids and is not overcome by administration of growth hormone. 605 Other immunosuppressive drugs also have significant toxicities that include potential risks of infection and malignancy so that they should not be used indiscriminarely.s\" especially in children. Refractory inflammatory bowel disease can be treated by surgery.603 Various surgical, endorectal pullthrough procedures have been used to treat Uc. CD is often more difficult to manage because surgery does not cure the disease. It is considered only for uncontrollable bleeding, stenotic bowel, or fistulas unresponsive to medical theca py.570,604\n\nApproximately 51 %607 of IBD patients have resorted to complementary healing practices, including acupuncture. 608 Concern about side-effects of medications and lack of effectiveness of standard therapies were the most commonly cited reasons for seeking complementary rnedicine.s''?\n\nThere are very few studies on acupuncture treatment of IBD. Current literature strongly suggests that acupuncture modulates the immune system. 531 There is one animal study that used an herbal tablet to treat induced Spleen deficiency in guinea pigs, resulting in amelioration of symptoms and decrease in size of colonic ulcer and edema. 609 There are no human studies at this time that specifically examine mucosal biopsies with acupuncture treatment. However, since acupuncture has been demonstrated to be successful in modulating immune response-U it would be reasonable to assume that acupuncture can have a beneficial effect on the hyperimmune inflammatory response of gastrointestinal mucosa in IBD.610 Acupuncture treatment is based on TCM differentiation.\n\nThere are several possible TCM diagnoses that correlate with the Western diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease: \n\nChildren are constitutionally Spleen deficient, which can be aggravated by: living in a Damp environment; by consuming excess sweets, greasy and fried foods, and Phlegm-producing foods; by hereditary Spleen deficiency; by chronic illnesses; and by irregular eating habits. In older children, excess mental work, \n\nA child in the Wood phase of development is especially vulnerable to development of IBD due to Liver Qi stagnation. The Wood child is naturally Liver Yang excessed and constitutionally Liver Yin deficient. Emotional disturbances such as anger and frustration may block the Liver function of directing smooth flow of Qi. Since Liver is in a destructive cycle with the Spleen, Liver Yang excess or Liver Qi stagnation would lead to further deficiency of the constitutionally weak Spleen.\n\n\u2022 CV-12, PC-6 for feeling of stuffiness in the epigasrriumvl! \u2022 Explore issues that caused emotional disturbance; teach the child calming exercises; massage Yintang for calming effect \n\nThis correlates to the strong genetic predisposition in IBD. It is often associated with watery stools or diarrhea in the early morning, and is more serious and therefore more difficult to treat. 613 \n\nObesity in childhood and adolescence is increasing in the US and all over the world614-616 in epidemic proportions with an upward trend of 0.2 kg increase in body weight/year at any given age. 619 It has become a major pediatric health issue. 62o Statistics of obesity in children range from 10%621 to 20%617 to 25%622, and even at 30% the condition is still considered to be underdiagnosed and undertreated. 623 There is increased prevalence among some minority subgroups, such as African Americans.v'? Obesity is usually evident by age 5-6 years. 255 Obesity in children is difficult to define, as it is influenced by age, by developmental stage, by physical fitness and individual variations in caloric needs. Skinfold thickness is difficult to apply to children. 624 In general, a body mass index (BMI; in kg/m 2) between the 85th and 95th percentiles indicates a risk of being overweight and a BMI greater than the 95th percentile indicates being overweight,617 or children whose weight exceeds 120% of that expected for their height are considered overweight. Since obese children are at increased risk of becoming obese adults and of developing obesity-related complications later in life, it becomes of utmost importance for early identification and treatment. 615, 617, 618, 625 The potential for persistence of obesity into adulthood increases with obesity at an early age or in adolescence, severity, and parental obesity. 626 The risk of adult obesity is greater if at least one parent is obese, especially when the child is obese before 10 years of age. 627\n\nEndogenous obesity such as metabolic or hormonal disorders, or syndromes such as Prader-Willi, are uncommon in children. 255,623 A comprehensive history and examination can usually elicit any medical causes of obesity. 614 The majority of cases of obesity in children are exogenous, due to a disproportionate intake of calories to expenditure. Genetic factors influence the inheritance of obese phenotypes, the major affectors of body (at content, energy intake and expenditure, and responsiveness to dietary intervention.618.624 Most likely obesity is a complex polygenic trait. 628 The most important issue in exogenous obesity is the balance of energy intake with energy expenditure. The major determinants of energy expenditure are basal metabolism, metabolic response to food, physical activity and growth; these are age-related in children. 255 The traditional view that obesity occurs when intake exceeds expenditure or in individuals with lower metabolic rate are now controversial, especially with respect to the pediatric population. Studies have demonstrated that obese individuals can have comparable metabolism as nonobese individuals 621 and some obese people in fact can have higher metabolic rates. 628 Obese and nonobese individuals often have similar energy intakes and expenditures.617.624 This implies that the difference between obesity and nonobesity can result from very small imbalances of energy intake and expenditure,617.624 possibly due to very small differences in basal metabolic rate or the thermic effects of food 624. In addition, children go through distinct developmental periods with different energy needs, such as early infancy and adolescence. Since there is inherent individual requirement for energy255 and susceptibility to the balance in energy617 and since changes in intake or expenditure in children may occur concomitantly with physiologic changes, such as hormonal levels in adolescence, weight gain especially during critical developmental periods is not always directly related to energy expendirure.vl?\n\nThe hypothalamus is the center for regulation of energy balance. It integrates neural, hormonal, and nutrient messages from the gut and circulation and sends signals to higher centers leading to feelings of hunger or satiety. The hypothalamus also controls energy expenditure via the autonomic nervous system and pituitary hormones. The hypothalamus nuclei contain over 40 neurotransmitters that affect food intake and thermogenesis. Those that stimulate appetite, such as opioids, and neuropeptide Y, suppress sympathetic nervous system activity and thus reduce energy expenditure, while the neurotransmitters that inhibit food intake, such as serotonin, dopamine, cholecystokinin, have the reverse effect of decreasing appetite and stimulating energy expenditure. There is evidence that hormones such as insulin and the concentrations of nutrients such as glucose and amino acids all playa role. Leptin is a recently discovered hormone, which is synthesized in fat and acts on the hypothalamus to suppress food intake and increase energy expenditure. Its concentration is high in nearly all obese people, and falls with weight loss, possibly suggesting some resistance to the central effects of leptin in obesity.617\n\nObesity in children is often associated with high intake of sweets and fattening foods, which is often under-reported by children.V! This, coupled with an increasing sedentary lifestyle in children,624 an increase in television viewing 629 and a decrease in regular physical activi ty621 especially in prepubertal girls 617 result in development of obesity in the pediatric population.\n\nObese children are predisposed to developing physical and psychoemotional complications. The physical complications include hypertension,630,631 and cardiovascular disease 623,632 as autopsy findings reveal progression of atherosclerotic plaques can begin in the very young,617 and fatty liver, which can occur without correlation to severity of obesity.255 One of the most dramatic and disturbing findings in the past decade is the tremendous increase in the incidence of type II diabetes in children and adolescents with obesity.617,633,634 Other physical complications include orthopedic problems due to increased weight on the hips and knees,623 and obstructive sleep apnea with symptoms of snoring and difficult breathing during sleep. 635 Psychologically, the obese child carries emotional burdens 622 such as low selfesteem, resulting in less social interaction with peers and less participation in team sports. 255 The negative psychosocial effect can be long-term, as women who were overweight adolescents are less likely to marry, have lower paying jobs, and complete fewer years of school. Overweight men are also less likely to marry.617\n\nChildhood obesity is among the most difficult problems to treat. It is frequently ignored by the pediatrician or viewed as a form of social deviancy, and blame for treatment failure is placed on the patients or their families. 624 Management is often unsuccessful. 614 There is increasing trend to direct treatment at prevention and early identification, with dietary and lifestyle management. At well child examinations, pediatricians need to identify high risk infants and children and discuss preventive measures such as dietary changes, change in lifestyle and behavior modications. 615, 623 In the future, new information from molecular biology-such as more research on the role of leptin in obesity-and molecular genetics may provide definitive early identification of individuals who are susceptible to developing obesity. 636 Diet and exercise remain the cornerstones in the Western management of obesity.628 A multidisciplinary team consisting of a pediatrician, a nutritionist, a psychotherapist and other ancillary personnel-the number increases with the level of academic involvement of the clinic-devise an appropriate treatment regimen. Weight management usually tries to set reasonable weight-loss goals 623,626 consisting of a combination of healthy diet and physical activities to change the sedentary lifestyle. 614,623 The theory is that a reduction of 500 kcaVday would result in the loss of lIb (500 g) of fat per week. 255 The specialists recognize that family involvement is crucial in management of childhood obesity.614,620,621,623,626,637 Children's food preferences and physical activity (or inactivity) are often influenced by parents. 621 Family readiness to change would also influence therapy. 626 Long-term success requires parental support to motivate the child in continuing the healthier lifestyle and eating habits. 621 Anorexic medications have significant side-effects such as heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, and are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in pediatric populations. Gastric bypass surgery for premorbid obese adults should at best be considered as experimental in children and adolescents. 626\n\nThere are a number of studies, mostly adult clinical trials, which have demonstrated efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of obesity. Acupuncture offers a safe, simple, economical, and effective treatment that can be used in conjunction with conventional managements. Whereas Western medicine treats all children with obesity as having one pathology, Chinese medicine considers a variety of Qi imbalances as the cause of obesity, each requiring a specific treatment regimen. Through energetic balance of the internal viscera, acupuncture treatment has been successful in reducing weight, often with long-lasting effects. 638,639 In addition, acupuncture treatments have been shown to correlate with normalization of Western bioanatomic and biochemical parameters.\n\nAcupuncture has demonstrated impressive effects on the hypothalamus and autonomic nervous system in weight control. Auriculoacupuncture alone has successfully treated obesity640,641 and can reduce weight even in nonobese subjects. 642 One theory proposes that stimulating the auricular Stomach point blocks the afferent signal of the hypothalamus, and thereby suppresses hunger, resulting in less food intake. 638,639 A Japanese study indicates that auriculoacupuncture improves the hypofunction of the hypothalamus, inhibits weight increase and the deposition of lipid. 638,639 A clinical study that included 19year-olds measured fasting blood-glucose, noradrenaline, dopamine, adrenalin and cortisol levels indicates that patients with simple obesity had hypofunctioning of the sympathetic-adrenal system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal system. Acupuncture treatment enhanced the functions of both the sympathetic-adrenal system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal systems and brought about weight loss. 643 The same investigator in China also demonstrated improved functions of the hypothalamus-hypophyseal-adrenal axis and the sympathetic-adrenomedullary systems. 638,639 In an animal study, e1ectroacupuncture stimulation at ST-36 and ST-44 resulted in weight loss by stimulating the center of satiation in the hyporhalamus.vt\"\n\nWestern medicine also posits that the hypothalamus controls energy expenditure via the autonomic nervous system. Nogier in France noted that stimulating the Lung point on the ear (which has vagus nerve innervation) resulted in appetite and weight loss.638,639 A Japanese study revealed simultaneous sympathetic hypofunction and parasympathetic hyperfunction in obese patients, and acupuncture balanced the autonomic nervous system by enhancing the function of the sympathetic nerve and inhibiting the hyperfunction of the parasympathetic nerve. 638, 639 Current data also reveals various effects acupuncture has on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, on regulation of salt and fluids, and on endocrine functions. Acupuncture has been shown to regulate hyperlipidemia,645 cholesterol and high density lipoprotein metabolism,646 and increases cAMP, which can activate lipase and promote decomposition of Iipid. 638,639 In a Russian study on 62 children, electroacupuncture decreased fatty tissue content, and normalized serum lipids. 647 Auricular and body points seem to work synergistically to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides with resultant weight loss.648 Acupuncture treatment can also have a positive effect on carbohydrate metabolism, with a decrease in serum glucose and an increase in lactic dehydrogenase.vt? Acupuncture has been shown to decrease edema in obesity by regulating water and salt metabolism through lowering serum sodium and aldosterone levels. 65o Other studies have demonstrated that acupuncture can regulate endocrine and metabolic functions that are important for control of obesity. A Japanese study showed acupuncture increases basal metabolic rate 638,639 and a European study demonstrated increased levels of pituitary and thyroid hormones with acupuncture. 638, 639 Acupuncture has also been effective in preventing complications of obesity, by reducing the arteriosclerotic index, the indicator for development of cardiovascular disease,651 and by lowering blood pressure. 652 Even when acupuncture fails to reduce weight, it can improve the psychological outlook of the obese patient. 653 An integrated approach with auricular acupuncture, diet control and aerobic exercise resulted in 86.7% success in weight reduction. 654\n\nThe majority of the studies use a TCM paradigm for differentiation of various syndromes as the cause of obesity. This is an important adjunct for Western medicine.\n\nMany children with exogenous obesity do not have a wide discrepancy between intake and energy expenditure and do not respond to conventional dietary management. These children have different Qi imbalances in the viscera that are not manifested in conventional examinations or laboratory studies, and would respond well to acupuncture. The key to successful acupuncture treatment is in the correct differentiation of different types of obesity and in selection of specific points to regulate each imbalance. The Five-Element Developmental Theory can augment understanding of the dysfunctions that result in obesity in children.\n\nThe primary organs of dysfunction in obesity are Stomach, Spleen, and Liver and Kidney. Current acupuncture thinking posits three major obesity syndromes that are applicable in children:\n\n\u2022 Spleen and Stomach Qi deficiency \u2022 Liver Yang excesslLiver Qi stagnation \u2022 Kidney Qi or Yin deficiency.64o, 64 1,643, 648, 649 \n\nThis is the most common TCM syndrome for obesity in pediatrics. Children have constitutionally weak Spleen and are prone to developing Spleen and Evaluation Treatment Common pediatric conditions 257\n\nStomach deficiency, which can in turn lead to Dampness in the Middle Energizer. Children are also susceptible to Wind invasions and tend to accumulate Heat as each fever with Wind invasion would use up Yin. The end result is inefficient transformation of food into Qi and transportation of Qi throughout the body, and insufficient transformation of fluids would further increase accumulation of Heat. Food and fluid tend to be retained in the Stomach.\n\nThese children gain weight easily. If there is more predominance of Stomach Heat, the children would have increased appetite. These are the ones who seem to \"stuff their faces\" when they are stressed. If there is more predominance of Spleen Qi deficiency, the appetite would be poor. In both cases, the children would not respond to a Western dietary regime for two reasons: (1) the foods that cause continuing imbalance are not high caloric foods but Heat foods and spices, such as ginger, or garlic, which do not have calories; (2) even small amounts of food of any type would still accumulate without being transformed or transported, resulting in weight gain. These overweight children tend to be sedentary, partly due to the weight gain, but partly also due to muscle weakness with Spleen deficiency and Dampness that make the legs feel heavy, so that they are easily fatigued with very little activity. The emotional manifestations tend to be excess worry, often about their weight which is made worse when they receive attention from peers, parents, and doctors. In extreme cases, the worry becomes an obsession about weight that can lead to depression and a referral to psychiatry. The complication of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea can be explained by an accumulation of Phlegm due to Spleen Qi deficiency. The treatments that are successful in the various studies have been dispersing Heat, resolving Dampness, and harmonizing the Middle Energizer. Acupuncture treatments of Spleen and Stomach have been shown to decrease weight by having a positive effect on carbohydrate metabolism with a decrease in serum glucose and an increase in lactic dehydrogenases't? and by reducing cholesterol and triglyceride levels. 648 History and physical examination would reveal signs of Spleen Qi deficiency in the presence of Heat and Dampness. There should be no increased physical activities at the beginning of treatment, as the child would become discouraged with an inability to perform. Exercise or increased physical activities can be added to the treatment regime once the child has shown some response to the treatment: such as less Heat and Dampness signs, less Spleen Qi deficiency, some weight loss. The activities need to be increased slowly as tolerated.\n\nThe majority of obese children are in the Wood phase of development when they have Liver vulnerability with a tendency toward Liver Qi stagnation and Liver Yang excess. The basis for this is Liver Yin deficiency. Since Liver has a destructive relationship with Spleen, Liver excess would result in Spleen deficiency and imbalances listed above. These children may respond to lower caloric diets, since greasy and fattening foods are injurious to Liver. Excess medications may also cause Liver imbalance. These children are sedentary because Liver Qi stagnation impairs the overall movement of Qi throughout the body, resulting in easy fatigability. The emotional manifestations from Liver Yang excess tend to be frustration, irritability, smoldering anger, and sometimes withdrawal and depression. These children are resistant to psychiatric intervention as it is very difficult for them to make any affective changes. The emotional manifestations of Liver Yin deficiency reveal a disturbance of the Ethereal Soul and therefore Shen: mental restlessness such as anxiety, fidgetiness that worsens later in the day, and insomnia. Successful managements in the studies have been to move Qi, subdue Liver Yang, tonify Liver Yin. Lipid metabolism was found to be abnormal in obese patients with Liver Yang excess syndrome, which can explain the Western complication of finding fatty livers that do not correlate with severity of obesity. Acupuncture brought about better lipid metabolism and also decreased blood pressure. 651 Use the Five-Element Developmental Theory to assess the root of the child's obesity. If obesity began in infancy or early childhood, or if there is a strong family history of obesity, then the root of the Wood child's obesity is in the Water phase of development. There is Kidney Yin and Kidney Essence deficiency, to cause Liver YinlEthereal Soul deficiency. Kidney Yang is not deficient as there is Liver Yang excess.\n\n\u2022 Dietary management -Eliminate greasy and fattening foods, diminish sour foods -Decrease intake of medications, especially over-the-counter drugs which tend to be taken indiscriminately The same principles on excercise should be followed with no increased physical activities at the beginning of treatment. Exercise or increased physical activities can be added to the treatment regime once the child has shown some response to the treatment, and activities increased slowly as tolerated.\n\nThe Kidney deficiency type of obesity usually has early onset in infancy or early childhood before 6 years of age, and usually has a strong family history of obesity with one or both parents being overweight. It is normal for babies to be chubby with puffy face, hands and feet-the Water phenotype as they are in the Water phase of development. Older children may have a tendency to continue with the Water physique in being shorter, having a puffy appearance and edematous extremities. The Kidney in Chinese medicine is the basis for marrow, the brain. This correlates to the involvement of the hypothalamus and the autonomic nervous system in Western medicine. The Chinese Kidney corresponds to both the kidney and adrenals in Western medicine. Water imbalance is due to both kidney and adrenal dysfunction, which in turn affect the sympathetic system and the adrenal-pituitary-hypothalamic axis. Numerous acupuncture studies quoted in the last section demonstrate the effect on the hypothalamus, the autonomic nervous system, and the sympathetic-adrenal and hypothalamuspituitary-adrenal systems.\n\nSince Kidney Qi and Yin are the basis of the Qi and Yin of all the organs, there are usually other imbalances concomitantly. Kidney Yin has a more specific and direct effect on Heart and Liver because of the mother-child nurturing relationship with Liver and the Fire-Water destructive relationship with the Heart. The child in the Wood phase of development would be more likely to develop both Kidney and Liver Yin deficiencies, manifesting both physical signs of Kidney Yin and Liver Yin deficiency, as well as emotional signs of fear and frustration or anger, and Ethereal Soul and Mind disturbances listed above. When Kidney and Heart are not harmonized, there is usually Heart Fire flaring due to inability of Water to control Fire. The child would manifest more disturbances of Shen: an inability to concentrate or think clearly, restlessness, and agitation. This would be more likely in a child in the Fire phase of development, i.e. the teenager. These children are usually frustrating for a psychotherapist, since they may become passive and deliberately say nothing or look bored during therapy, manifesting more Water characteristics; or they may become \"fiery\" during the sessions and become verbally aggressive toward the therapist or toward family members for sending them there.\n\nKidney Yang deficiency has more specific effects on the Lung and Spleen because of the Lung-Kidney mother-child nurturing relationship and the Spleen-Kidney destructive relationship. An obese child with both Kidney and Spleen Yang deficiency would manifest physical signs and symptoms of both deficiencies-with more exaggerated Spleen Qi deficiency signs because of concomitant Kidney Yang deficiency. Puffy weight gain would continue in spite of very poor appetite. These children tend to dislike exercise as both Yang deficiencies make them become tired very easily, feel very heavy in the lower limbs that tend to be edematous, and to develop soreness in the knees and muscles with little movement. They may respond slightly to a diet eliminating candy. However, as a rule, these children are refractory to conventional treatments. Emotionally, these children may appear dull and lack willpower or motivation to \"stick to a diet,\" or tend to give up easily with any project or school work. They are fearful and worried on the inside, but outwardly may appear apathetic: \"I don't care if people call me fat.\" Their \"I don't care\" attitude presents a challenge to the psychotherapist. The Kidney and Lung deficiency combination would have manifestations of both Kidney Yang and Lung Qi deficiency. These children have a difficult time with exercise because they easily become short of breath and start coughing when they do anything physically strenuous. Hypertension and cardiovascular complications would be the most common in this group. Emotionally, these children are sad and fearful, a combination that makes them withdrawn and depressed. It usually takes many sessions before these children would look at the therapist in the eye and open up to talk about themselves. This group of children would include \"normally obese\" children who developed obesity at an early age, and \"abnormally obese\" children with congenital syndromes, such as Prader-Willi or Beckwith syndromes that have other anomalies, including renal and eNS (Kidney-marrow) abnormalities.\n\nIn view of the complex factors of weight gain due to Kidney deficiency-an early onset with positive family history, secondary involvement of other Yin organs-this type of obesity in children is the most difficult to manage. Treatment entails strengthening a genetic or constitutional predisposition (Kidney Essence deficiency) that may have been in the family for many generations, bringing about overall Yin and Yang balance, and correcting individual organ dysfunctions. Treatment of these children would definitely need involvement of the family, and it would in fact be wise to treat the parents and siblings, who most likely would share similar characteristics. The dietary management should be applicable for the whole family.\n\nThe early onset of obesity and positive family history would point toward Kidney deficiency diagnosis. Look for signs and symptoms of other organ involvement.\n\nKeep in mind that the Kidney deficiency is the root of the problem, and manifestations of other organs are the branches. The treatments would need to\n\nalternate between tonification of the Kidney Yin and Yang and treatment of the dysfunction of the secondary organ of involvement. However, since Kidney is the root of the imbalance, some Kidney points should always be incorporated into the treatment of the secondary organs.\n\n\u2022 If possible, evaluate the family members to gain a better understanding of the child, or even incorporate the family members for treatment \u2022 Diet-may be appropriate for the whole family -Eliminate any excess salt in foods: no extra added salt, no salty foods such as pretzels or chips -Presence of Liver Yin symptoms: eliminate or decrease sour foods; decrease medications -For Heart Fire symptoms: eliminate bitter foods in the diet; also be careful in taking medications which are usually bitter -For Spleen deficiency: eliminate artificially sweetened foods; some medications for children also contain artificial sweeteners -For Lung deficiency: eliminate spicy foods \u2022 Tonify Kidney Yin and Kidney Qi \n\nAOM is one of the most common pediatric infectious conditions. It is most prevalent in young children of 8-24 months of age. Approximately two-thirds of all children will have had at least one episode of AOM before age 3 years, and half of them will have recurrences of chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) into early elementary school years. 659 The pathogenesis of otitis media is primarily mediated through eustachian tube dysfunction. The eustachian tube protects the middle ear from nasopharyngeal secretions, provides drainage into the nasopharynx of secretions produced within the middle ear, and permits equilibration of air pressure with atmospheric pressure in the middle ear. Infants and children are vulnerable to developing middle ear infection because: (1) their eustachian tubes are shorter and more horizontal so that drainage of middle ear is impaired; (2) they are prone to develop congestion from acute upper respiratory tract infection, from smoke or environmental allergens and pollutants. 668,675,676 The congestion generates a negative middle ear pressure, resulting in intermittent obstruction of the eustachian tube 676 that can lead to bacterial colonization.F\" Children have inadequate mucociliary function that is necessary for maintaining eustachian tube sterility. 677 Clinically, the child with AOM presents with earache, and fever, usually accompanied by upper respiratory tract symptoms such as rhinorrhea. The tympanic membrane on otoscopic examination varies from hyperemic with preservation of landmarks, to a bright red, tense, bulging, distorted appearance. In the advanced stage of suppuration, the tympanic membrane ruptures with a gush of purulent, or bloody tinged fluid from the ear. 394 Since viral or bacterial otitis usually cannot be distinguished by otoscopic examination, AOM is usually treated empirically, using antibiotics such as amoxicillin that have a high concentration in the middle ear f1uid. 678, 679 However, the widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in increasing resistance to the more common medications. 666,668 Currently, 10% of children with acute otitis media are recalcitrant to antibiotic therapy.68o The prevalence of resistant organisms tends to increase in the winter months. 681 Economically, treatment failure due to drug resistance has been responsible for further escalating the billions of dollars spent treating acute otitis media. 682 In addition, antimicrobials suppress the normal flora, which is beneficial to the host because it has the capabilities to interfere with and therefore prevent pathogenic infections, and may enhance recovery from upper respiratory tract infections. 681 On the other hand, since the advent of antibiotics, complications such as mastoiditis and intracranial infections have significantly decreased. 77, 394 The current focus is on prevention. Breast feeding confers lifesaving protection against infectious illness, including otitis. 683,684 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), approved in 2000 for use in the US, covers the seven serotypes that account for about 80% of invasive infections in children younger than 6 years of age. This vaccine was demonstrated to have more than 90% efficacy,673 and has resulted in a modest reduction of total episodes of AOM. 685 The goal of pneumococcal vaccine is to prevent symptomatic infections in the middle ear and to prevent colonization of pneumococci that can cause subsequent middle ear infections. 686 It may eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci. 687 However, since PCV only prevents disease due to the most common serotypes, there is concern that the nonvaccine serotypes will become more common, especially in children less than 2 years of age. 685 An effective RSV vaccine for the infant and young child could markedly decrease otitis media disease. 661 Intranasal spray of attenuated viruses is currently under investigation, in the hope that early antiviral therapy would reduce the risk of otitis media following respiratory tract infections. 662,665\n\nChronic otitis media is divided into two categories: chronic suppurative otitis media and chronic OME. Chronic suppurative otitis media is not temporally related to acute otitis, since the pathologic changes in the middle ear are different. The classic symptoms of established chronic suppurative otitis are otorrhea and deafness (some form of hearing loss).394 Chronic suppurative otitis media can lead to the formation of cholesteatoma, a cyst that contains desquamated epithelial cells, that can cause local bone erosion and lead to retention of infected material.P\" Chronic OME is one of the most common diseases in childhood. 675 It is related to infection, eustachian tube obstruction, allergic or immunologic disorders, and enlarged adenoids.P\" The serous fluid in CSOM still contains bacteria, such as H. influenzae and pneumococci. 688 OME has been implicated to be an immune-mediated disease,675 since immune complexes have been demonstrated in the middle ear effusion 689,69o and highly organized lymphatic tissue has been found in the middle ear mucosa.f\"! The rationale for treating OME is prevention of recurrence of AOM. Currently, a once daily antibiotic regimen is the recommended prophylaxis. The benefit is also weighed against the increasing risk of emergence of resistant bacteria. 684 When antibiotics fail to control recurrent otitis, a short trial of prednisone is sometimes prescribed. 68o Surgery is recommended when medical treatment fails,680 especially when the child has hearing loss.667 Tympanostomy tubes appear to be beneficial in OME, but is of less value in chronic suppurative otitis. 684 An increase in hearing loss has been reported with insertion of ventilation tubes. 692 Adenoidectomy is sometimes recommended,664 especially after tympanostomy tube failure. 684\n\nThere is a total lack of recent acupuncture data on treatment of otitis media in children. Only one clinical trial was reported, in 1985. 693 Traditional Chinese medicine diagnoses correlate well with Western categorizations of acute and chronic otitis media.\n\nAOM correlates to the Shao Yang stage of Wind-Cold invasion and to the Wei Qi level of Wind-Heat invasion. Dampness-the Western medicine congestion and fluid accumulation in the eustachian tube-predisposes the child to external invasions, and suppuration correlates to Chinese diagnosis of Damp Heat. An integrative approach would be beneficial, both with diagnosis using otoscopic examination, and with follow-up audiologic evaluations, such as tympanograms and other hearing tests. Acupuncture treatment can be given concomitantly with antibiotics, as Chinese medicine's goal in expelling the pathogens and tonifying the immune system complements the Western regimen.\n\n\u2022 Treat the local ear points: GB-2, SI-19, TE-21; parents can be taught to massage these points \n\nSince AOM is prevalent during winter and early spring, the TCM principle of \"winter disease summer cure\" would be prophylactically tonifying Wei Qi or the immune system, treating the local ear points, or tonifying the Shao Yang Gallbladder channel during the summer months.\n\n\u2022 \n\nThe lingering effusion is indicative of Dampness due to Spleen deficiency. Children are constitutionally Spleen Qi deficient. They may become more Spleen deficient due to inheritance of weak pre-Heaven Spleen Qi, such as a strong family history of Spleen Qi deficiency, Spleen deficiency in both parents during conception, in mother during pregnancy; due to a diet with excessive sweets, dairy and greasy foods; due to chronic illnesses; or from living in a Damp environment. Spleen Qi deficiency results in Dampness accumulation. Chronic Dampness would in turn further injure the Spleen. Spleen corresponds with the emotions worry and obsession, and with excess mental activities. A careful history would uncover any situations that would predispose to worry, and academic overload or lack of rest due to school or extracurricular activities. \n\nThis condition tends to affect children in the Wood phase of development when Gallbladder is vulnerable. Heat in the Gallbladder channel may be due to lingering pathogenic Heat from previous illnesses that was not completely expelled, or to consuming excess greasy food or medications that injure the Wood Element. While Liver is the \"General\" that directs Qi, Gallbladder has the important function of carrying out the decisions. This child, then, would have chronic otitis with other Heat symptoms and indecisiveness. \n\nDuring periods of remission, tonify the immune system.\n\nAcute pharyngitis and tonsillitis are common in healthy children and adolescents. The tonsils and adenoids, located at the portal of entry of many airborne and alimentary antigens, prevent bacterial colonization and form antibodies. They influence both local and systemic immunity, and are often considered the first line of defense against respiratory infections. 694,695\n\nThe majority of pharyngitis cases have a viral etiology-such as rhinovirus, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (mononucleosis), influenza A and B.696,697 Younger children have frequent episodes, while adolescents experience two to four nasopharyngeal infections annually.698 Bacterial pharyngitis occurs when the pathogens adhere to and colonize in the mucous membranes. The extent of pathogenic injury varies according to the host immune system. In a healthy individual, there may only be mild edema and swelling. 699 The most important bacterial agent is group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS). The incidence of GABHS in children ranges from as low as 5%700 to 20%701,702 to 35%,703-706 Even during the peak streptococcal infection seasons, winter and early spring,696 it occurs in less than 40% of pharyngitis cases,7\u00b07 GABHS is primarily a disorder of children between 5 years and 15 years of age. 696 The clinical presentation of GABHS consists of sudden onset of sore throat, fever, and pain on swallowing. 696,708 Headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain may also be present in children. 696,708 Physical examination reveals tonsillopharyngeal erythema with or without exudates, and tender anterior cervical adenopathy.696,708 However, only about 15-30% of children present with classic clinical signs,7\u00b08,670 so that clinically viral pharyngitis and GABHS are often indistinguishable.s'\" Infrequently, other infectious agents that produce sore throat include non-group A streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Neisseria, and Moraxella catarrhalis. They can be distinguished from GABHS because they are usually accompanied by other concomitant clinical illness. 705, 706, 709 Because of the prevalence of viral pharyngitis and unreliable clinical findings, the Infectious Diseases Society of America 696 and the American Academy of Pediatrics Principles on Management of Common Office Infections/!\" recommend throat culture and/or rapid group A streptococci antigen detection test (RADT) to precisely diagnose GABHS,7\u00b00,703-705,708 Their use has been shown to be cost-effective and to reduce antibiotic overprescribing substantially. 670 Newer immunoassays and nucleic acid techniques being developed will be more sensitive and specific.U! Viral pharyngitis is benign and self-limiting, needing only symptomatic care without antibiotics. 680,696,712 Penicillin has been the treatment of choice for group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis since the 1950s,7\u00b00,708 and is currently recommended as first-line therapy by the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Heart Associarion.V?\n\nA 10-day course of oral penicillin or an intramuscular injection of penicillin G benzathine are considered equivalent treatment. Erythromycin is used for patients who are allergic to penicillin. 696, 705, 708, 712 Early antibiotic therapy reduces the duration of pharyngitis, and minimizes formation of peritonsillar retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal abscesses. 664, 676, 698, 708 The primary objective for antibiotic therapy of GABHS infection, however, is the prevention of rheumatic fever. 670 The incidence of rheumatic fever has declined in industrialized countries since the 1950s and now has an annual incidence of around 0.5 cases per 100000 children of school age. In developing countries it remains an endemic disease with annual incidences ranging from 100 to 200 per 100000 school-aged children and is a major cause of cardiovascular mortality. The risk of developing rheumatic fever following untreated tonsillopharyngitis is 1%,?01,702 The current understanding is that there is a genetically determined predisposirion/J! that results in the host's autoimmune response to GABHS,?01,702 In France and most of Europe there is tacit agreement that all cases of pharyngitis and tonsillitis should be treated with antibiotics without identification of the causal agent.7\u00b01 , 702 Empiric and widespread over-treatment of pharyngitis with antibiotics has resulted in emergence of bacterial resistance. 699, 705, 670, 709 Up to 35% of children may experience recurrence,676,699,704,670 which is more prevalent in children younger than 8 years of age.7\u00b06 The high failure rate after penicillin treatment 706 prompts some to recommend against using penicillin as the solo drug of choice. 7 14 Explanations for recurrence include poor compliance with taking medication,7t5 co-colonization by other organisms, and reacquisition from a family member or peer.7\u00b05 ,690 Currently, routine laboratory evaluation or treatment of close household contacts are not recommended.f'\" Compliance can be improved with shorter-course nonpenicillin antibiotics, which tend to be broader spectrum and are often more expensive,7t6 although they may have less gastrointestinal side-effects.\"!\" There is also concern that antibiotics can also suppress natural immune responses by eradication of normal pharyngeal flora that act as natural host defenses 705 in interfering with pathogenic activities and prevent infection. 676 Evidence is mounting that antibiotics may have little impact on the duration of sore throat symptoms, regardless of etiology. Complications of sore throat are now so rare that an adverse drug reaction from antibiotic therapy is more likely.718 Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy for recurrent pharyngitis remains controversial. 694,719\n\nAt this time, there is very little data on acupuncture treatment of pharyngitis. Chinese medicine diagnoses can correlate to both Western categories of acute and recurrent pharyngitis. The best approach would be to integrate the Western diagnosis and treatment with Chinese medicine: examination of the throat and palpating for cervical adenopathy is much easier than Chinese pulse taking and tongue diagnosis in children. Laboratory confirmation for GABHS is important.\n\nThis correlates to viral pharyngitis with negative laboratory findings for GABHS. The \"mild sore throat\" throat indicates that the invasion is beginning to enter the Yang Ming stage involving the Stomach organ and meridian. \n\nThis correlates to bacterial pharyngitis, including GABHS. The Wind-Heat invasion or bacterial infection is much more virulent than the Wind-Cold invasion, and enters quickly into the Qi level that correlates in this case to deep penetrating of the Yang Ming organs and meridians. Acupuncture treatment can be given concomitantly with antibiotics. \n\nIn addition to Wind invasions that cause Yang Ming Heat, Chinese medicine also posits that the sensation of soreness in the throat can be due to Stomach Heat derived from excess consumption of energetically Hot foods, sweet foods, or greasy and fried foods. Since Western medicine does not recognize the relationship between sore throat and foods, the negative culture in this case would be diagnosed as viral pharyngitis. One distinguishing feature is that these children often complain of abdominal pain that may be temporally related to eating.\n\n\u2022 \n\nTwo conditions can predispose to chronic pharyngitis with Yin deficiency: pathogenic Heat lingers and accumulates when Heat is not adequately expelled in acute invasions, and continual consumption of excess Heat foods. Both of these can cause chronic state of Heat that exhausts Yin. Since Kidney Yin is the foundation of all the Yin, tonification of KI-6 has been found to be important for treating recurrent sore throat. 721\n\n\u2022 Eliminate excess Heat foods, sweets, greasy and fried foods \u2022 Use the four-point protocol to clear Stomach Heat \u2022 KI-6 to tonify Kidney Yin \u2022 SP-6, CV-12 to tonify Stomach Yin \u2022 Immune protocol to increase immunity.\n\nParents can be taught to do acupressure on CV-22, KI-27 for acute symptoms and SP-6, KI-6 for tonification of Spleen and Kidney Yin in chronic, recurrent pharyngitis. Although the current Western approach is to not treat close family contacts with medication, acupressure can be used as a preventive measure since it does not encompass antibiotic concerns of potential side-effects and overuse (see Bibliography for further reading on this topic).\n\nEpilepsy, or seizure disorder, is considered primarily a pediatric disease as over two-thirds of all seizures begin in childhood. It is an important disorder since it can significantly affect not only the health but also the quality of life of the child and the family,722 A study from the UK estimates that approximately 0.7-0.8 % of school-aged children have active epilepsy,723 Childhood seizure represents a broad and complex range of disorders which vary from benign to severely disabling diseases.P\" The spectrum of causes encompasses genetic predisposition, birth and perinatal complications, congenital anomalies, metabolic disorders, infections, head trauma, and brain tumor. A significant number of seizures are considered idiopathic-without known cause. 415 Various nonneurologic disorders, such as breath-holding spells, can mimic seizures. 725 Seizures in children are frequently misdiagnosed and inappropriately managed. 726 Epileptic children have a higher incidence of psychiatric disorders. 722 By definition, an epileptic seizure is a paroxysmal disturbance of consciousness, motor function, sensation, perception, behavior or emotion resulting from a cortical neuronal discharge. The symptoms can occur singly or in any cornbination. 723 The immature and developing brain of children, especially infants, has a lower seizure threshold and therefore is vulnerable toward developing epilepsy.727\n\nNeuronal hyperexcitability is the common pathophysiology in the various epileptic syndromes. 728 Neurochemical mechanisms include neurotransmitters gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) and catecholamines and opioid peptides.?28\n\nThe International Classification of Seizure Disorders broadly categorizes seizures into generalized, partial (focal, local), and unclassified seizures. Each class has a long list of differentials that have complex dimensions. 415 This section focuses on the major seizures of childhood and correlates them with TCM diagnoses: generalized seizures: grand mal, febrile, and absence seizures; and partial, focal seizures.\n\nThe generalized seizures have clinical presentations that indicate involvement of both cerebral hemispheres. Consciousness may be impaired, and may in fact be the initial manifestation and motor manifestations are bilateral. The electroencephalogram (EEG) reflects widespread neuronal discharges in both hemispheres. 415\n\nGrand mal seizures are the most common type of convulsive disorders in children.?29 The seizures are characterized by generalized tonic-clonic movements that reflect involvement of both hemispheres. There is usually impairment of consciousness, as well as a postictal period of drowsiness or confusion. The EEG reveals higher amplitude of waves during the tonic phase, and slower waves during the clonic phase. 415 There are numerous causes for grand mal seizures. Convulsions are often associated with CNS infections, such as viral encephalitis or bacterial meningitis. Generalized seizure may be the first presentation of bacterial sepsis and meningitis in infants and young children. Mechanisms of seizure production in infection include venous thrombosis, cerebritis, abscess formation, and subdural effusions. In neonates and infants, grand mal seizures may be due to congenital anomalies, prenatal and perinatal complications, or metabolic dysfunctions. The majority of primary grand mal seizures in older children are idiopathic, often with a strong genetic predisposition.R'' Vascular lesions, and even brain tumors, usually present with focal seizures. Head trauma seizures tend to be focal when the onset is within 24 hours, and generalized when the onset is delayed, usually within 3 years after the injury. 415 Diagnosis is made by neurological evaluation, examination of cerebral spinal fluid, and brain imaging studies. Treatment with long-term anticonvulsants is important, because hypoxemia during an acute episode of seizures can have serious central nervous system sequelae. Overall, epileptic children have diminished mental processing abilities, poorer concentration, and are less alert than age-matched controls.Z'\" Because seizure medications have significant sideeffects, physicians are often confronted with the difficult decision of maintaining a child on long-term treatment versus discontinuation of drugs and risk the relapse of seizures.?31 Medically intractable, disabling seizures may be treated with surgery.?24,732,733\n\nInfantile spasm is one of the most severe forms of epilepsy of the infant. It has distinct recognizable seizure types-spasms or epileptic spasms-associated with definitive electrographic features and hypsarrhythmia. The seizure is generally resistant to treatment, with adrenocorticotrophic hormone still being the drug of choice. 734 More effective newer drugs are associated with more adverse side-effects/F' and have contributed to therapeutic confusion.?26 The neurologic and cognitive prognosis is poor.\n\nThis form of partial or generalized seizure is associated with a genetic predisposition and maturational process. Some cases have transient worsening, including cognitive troubles. 736\n\nFebrile seizures are the most common seizure disorder in childhood, occurring in 2-5% of children.?37 Most often febrile seizures are generalized tonic-clonic convulsions. They usually occur hours after onset of a febrile illness, are usually self-limiting and brief, lasting only a few seconds to a few minutes. They occur in children between 3 months and 5 years of age, with predominant presentation between 18 and 22 months.?38 There is no precise temperature elevation for seizure to occur, since the temperature threshold varies from one child to another, and varies even within the same child during different illnesses.?38\n\nAlthough children with pre-existing neurologic or developmental abnormalities may be more vulnerable to febrile seizures, they usually occur in normal children and are considered benign.?24 The recurrence rate is 30-40%.?39 There is specific genetic defect associated with a child's vulnerability to febrile seizures. 728 About 10% of parents of children with febrile seizures have had seizures themselves, chiefly the febrile type. Maternal illness and smoking during pregnancy also contribute to increased risk. 415 Treatment of most simple febrile seizures consists of fever control and counseling parents,740 who understandably become very upset on seeing their young child convulse. The American Academy of Pediatrics determined that simple febrile convulsions are not associated with long-term adverse effects, and the risk of developing epilepsy is extremely low. Furthermore, even in those children who do become epileptic, there is no evidence that recurrent simple febrile seizures produce structural eNS damage. Therefore, long-term treatment of simple febrile convulsions is not recommended, since the potential toxicities associated with antiepileptic therapy outweigh the relatively minor risks associated with simple febrile seizures.?37 In these cases, EEG changes tend to resolve even within hours or days after the acute episode, and is of limited diagnostic and prognostic value. 415 Neuroimaging is not recommended.P'' Antipyretic treatment does not reduce the recurrence rate. 739 Intermittent diazepam prophylaxis at times of fever mayor may not reduce the recurrence rate significantly. There is no data to suggest that it improves the long-term outcome, as compared with short-term seizure control, in terms of IQ, cognition, academic progress, motor control, and subsequent epilepsy.739\n\nAbsence, or petit mal epilepsy, remains one of the most enigmatic of neurological disorders. There is no widely accepted theory of its etiology,?41 In a typical simple absence attack, the child abruptly loses consciousness and ceases ongoing activity without even change in posture. The child's eyes stare vacantly straight ahead or may roll upward. There is no movement except possibly some subtle fluttering of the eyelids and twitching of the perioral muscles. The episode lasts for a brief moment, usually a few seconds, and the child suddenly resumes previous activity as if nothing had happened. There is no postictal confusion or drowsiness. Dozens to hundreds of seizures may occur in a single day. Intellectual and school performance may deteriorate because of the frequent interruptions of concentration. The child may be labeled as a daydreamer, lazy or dull. These attacks tend to abate by adolescence'S\" although many children continue to suffer absence seizures well into adulthood.I\"! EEG exhibits a typical pattern of bilaterally synchronous, frontally predominant 3-Hz spike-andslow-wave activity. These are thought to be abnormal oscillations between the thalamus and cerebral cortex,?42 There is overwhelming evidence of genetic predisposition in absence seizures,?41 Research has demonstrated neurochemical basis involving GABA, catecholamines, and \"endogenous\" epileptogens/\"! that activate burst firing of thalamic neurons, initiating an absence seizure,743 These seizures are usually managed with medication.V''\n\nPartial, focal seizures have clinical and EEG changes that indicate initial activation of neurons limited to part of one cerebral hemisphere. The seizures mayor may not have impaired consciousness, and often progress to generalized motor convulsions.Uv Some may become generalized so quickly that the initial focal nature of the seizures is masked. Others become generalized after an appreciable time has elapsed. EEG tracing may indicate initial activation of neurons limited to a localized area in one cerebral hernisphere.U> The mechanisms that initiate, promulgate, and terminate seizures remain unknown.\n\nIn children, approximately 30-50% of focal seizure have no known etiologic cause. There appears to be a genetic factor that determines whether a focal lesion becomes epileptogenic. Cerebral damage during or near the time of birth may result in seizures in early infancy or later in childhood. CNS tumor is rare in children. Head trauma is the most common cause of focal seizures. Closed head injuries, which constitutes most of pediatric injuries, are associated with only 5% incidence of epilepsy. The best results (of head trauma) were associated with normal computerized tomography scans,?44 Linear or depressed skull fractures have approximately 50% incidence of post-traumatic seizures. Fifty percent of seizures have their onset within 24 hours of injury, and tend to be focal in nature. Seizures occurring within 3 years of injury are more frequently generalized tonic-clonic grand mal seizures.P'\" The pathogenesis of seizure due to head injury may be extravasation of blood which stimulates epileptogenic processes. Management may require neurosurgical evacuation of subdural hematomas, followed by long-term anticonvulsant medications.\n\nThe first description of grand mal seizures appeared in Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine Huang Di Nei Ching .'45 Pediatric textbooks have indicated successful treatment with acupuncture. Current acupuncture data has demonstrated varying degrees of success in treatment of adult epilepsy-mostly the chronic, medically intractable seizures,746-750 which may not be applicable in pediatrics. Scalp acupuncture has been shown to improve cerebral blood flow in children, which would increase the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the cortical tissues. This can theoretically be beneficial in childhood epilepsy.751 An animal study on corresponding GV-26 and GV-24 points was found to increase brain GABA levels,?52\n\nAn integrative approach to pediatric seizure disorder can combine Western neurologic examination and laboratory evaluations for diagnosis. Since acupuncture has minimal or no side-effects, it can be administered concomitantly with seizure medications. Tapering of medications, however, should be carried out carefully with close coordination with the neurologist. According to Chinese medicine, epileptic convulsions are internal Wind disturbances that can be due to both external and internal causes.\n\nGrand mal generalized seizures can be due to external pathogenic invasion or to internal imbalances.\n\nSeizures are acute manifestations of the Jue Yin stage of Wind-Cold invasion and the Blood Level of Wind-Heat invasion-the sepsis and meningitis of Western diagnoses. The extreme Heat in the Liver generates Wind, dries up Liver Yin, thus preventing Liver from moistening the sinews. Muscles become rigid. Wind and Heat can cloud the Mind and cause unconsciousness. Both pathogens have penetrated to the deepest level of the child's body and have overcome the child's defense system. It is too late to expel the pathogens. The child is critically ill and most likely is already in the hospital on intravenous antibiotics. In those instances, acute seizure episodes are usually managed medically. However, the practitioner can try two classic acupuncture points that have been used to stop seizure and restore consciousness: GV-26 and KI-l. These points can be either needled or pinched very hard with the fingernail, so that parents can be taught to administer the treatment if the child progresses rapidly from mild febrile illness to convulsion. This is often seen in small infants who can progress from having mild symptoms to full blown sepsis in just a few hours.\n\nAcupuncture can be used as a complementary treatment to dissipate Heat, subdue internal Wind, and tonify the child:\n\n\u2022 GV-14 to dissipate Heat, to subdue Wind \u2022 GV-16, GB-20 to subdue Wind \u2022 LR-2 to clear Jue Yin Liver Heat \u2022 LR-3 to subdue Liver Wind, nourish Liver Yin and Blood \u2022 SI-3 to expel Wind from Governor Vessel channel \u2022 GV-20 to increase Qi to the CNS.\n\nYin deficiency in the Kidney and the Liver account for majority of the grand mal seizures in childhood: idiopathic form with strong genetic predisposition; CNS congenital anomalies or lesions; perinatal complications; or metabolic dysfunctions. Benign epilepsy of children and febrile convulsions may be milder forms of this imbalance, while infantile spasm is on the other end of the spectrum, being the most severe manifestation.\n\nThe majority of pediatric grand mal seizures are considered idiopathic, which indicates that Western medicine does not have a clear explanation of the etiology. Genetic predisposition correlates with Kidney Essence, which is Yin. Kidney Yin deficiency would rapidly result in Liver Yin deficiency because of the mother-ehild nurturing relationship between Kidney and Liver. Children are especially vulnerable because they are already constitutionally Yin deficient and Liver vulnerable. CNS congenital anomalies or lesions also correlate with Kidney, which is the foundation for marrow, the brain. Metabolic disorders are usually associated with the Liver.\n\nBenign epilepsy of childhood and febrile convulsion probably represent milder forms of Kidney Yin/Liver Yin deficiency. Children in the Water phase of development-infancy and early childhood-are most vulnerable to Kidney imbalances and neurologic disorders. As the child matures, he moves out of the Water phase and therefore \"outgrows\" the epilepsy. Western medicine explains this as children having an immature brain which has a lower seizure threshold and is therefore vulnerable to developing epilepsy. A febrile seizure characteristically occurs within hours of onset of illness and therefore does not correlate with the Jue Yin stage or Blood level of pathogenic invasion. The predilection in infancy and early childhood again correlates with the Water phase of brain vulnerability. A strong genetic predisposition again suggests deficiency of pre-Heaven Essence, of Kidney Yin deficiency. During an acute illness with high fever, the intense internal Heat rapidly depletes Yin at the same time agitates internal Wind. Those with mild forms of deficiency would have one or two episodes. Those with more severe forms would progress to chronic epilepsy.\n\nThe pathophysiology of grand mal seizures is due to the direct effect of Liver Yin deficiency and the resultant Liver Yang excess. Liver Yin or Blood nourishes muscles and sinews. When Liver Yin/Blood is deficient, the emptiness in the Blood vessels is \"filled\" by internal Wind. Liver Yin deficiency causes Liver Yang rising, which stirs up Wind. Similarly, Heat from fever agitates Wind, both causing tonic-elonic movements in the extremities. The loss of consciousness or the Mind indicates involvement of Heart Yin, which is directly affected by Liver Yin via the mother-ehild relationship and by Kidney Yin, which is the foundation of all Yin, but especially of Liver and Heart. Infantile spasm is the most severe form of Kidney and Liver Yin deficiency, when there is not even enough Yin in the muscles and sinews for convulsive movements and the child becomes \"stiff\" in spasm.\n\nThere is general agreement between Western and Chinese medicine that the more severe forms of grand mal seizures need to be vigorously treated to prevent further neurologic injury. However, whereas Western medicine determines that benign childhood epilepsy and febrile convulsions do not need treatment, Chinese medicine posits that Kidney/Liver Yin of any degree of imbalance needs to be treated in order to prevent future disorders that may have other manifestations. For example, Western medicine has determined that epileptic children have a higher incidence of psychiatric disorders,723 which in TCM represents imbalance of the Mind, of Shen. Since Western medicine operates on a different paradigm, there is no study that examines the correlation between febrile convulsion or childhood seizures and stroke in later years, both of which have the common TCM etiology in Liver Yin deficiency. Finally, whereas Western medicine must weigh the risk of medication side-effects with risk of seizure recurrence with nontreatment, acupuncture is safe and has the ability to \"tonify\" the child. There is no risk of \"overdosing\" the child with treatment, as no child can have too much Kidney Yin or Liver Yin. \n\nThe major manifestations of absence seizures are brief loss of consciousness, staring vacantly, and lack of motor movements. These are suggestive of brief loss of Shen and Ethereal Soul. Shen, or Mind, resides in the Heart Yin while the Ethereal Soul, Hun, resides in the Liver Yin. The Mind controls consciousness. The Hun pertains to the Mind and is the coming and going of the Mind. The eyes, the external orifices of Liver, reflect the state of the Ethereal Soul, as in the Western saying: \"the eyes are windows to the soul.\" During that brief moment when the child stares blankly, the Mind and the Soul are temporarily \"gone.\" A genetic predisposition indicates that there is inheritance of both Liver and Heart Yin deficiency, or inheritance of Liver Yin deficiency that leads to Heart Yin deficiency via the mother-ehild relationship in the nurturing cycle. The course of this disorder is also compatible with the Five-Element Developmental Theory since children tend to \"outgrow\" this type of seizure in adolescence, the Fire phase of development, when the Heart is stronger. Liver Yin deficiency results in Liver Yang excess, which can stir up internal Wind.\n\nHowever, unlike the grand mal seizures in Kidney Yin/Liver Yin deficiency, Liver Wind in this case carries excess Phlegm-which is usually abundant in children with constitutional Spleen deficiency. The Phlegm clouds the Heart, prevents the Heart from housing the Mind, and obstructs circulation to the eyes and an absence seizure ensues. The unpredictability and brevity of the attacks are characteristic of the coming-and-going of Wind.\n\nThis puzzling childhood disorder, therefore, can be explained by TCM theories. Emergency treatment is not necessary or possible since the attacks usually last only a few seconds. Treatment is directed toward prevention of recurrence, focusing on ronification of Heart and Liver Yin, calming the Shen, settling the Hun; and clearing Phlegm. \n\nThe common cold is the most frequent infection in children in the US and throughout the industrialized world. A preschool-aged child has an average of 4 to 10 colds per year. Upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is the major cause of absences from school. 754 The clinical symptoms vary greatly without any correlation with specific viruses,756 The majority of the symptoms are mild, consisting of rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion and obstruction, postnasal drip, and cough. There may often be additional symptoms of low-grade fever, sore throat, clear eye discharge, digestive discomfort, and general malaise,756,757 Some common viruses that cause URI include rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, RSV, influenza and parainfluenza virus,755,758,759 Transmission varies with different viruses. For example, RSV spreads primarily through contact with symptomatic children and contaminated objects; influenza mainly via airborne droplets. The precise route of transmission for rhinovirus remains controversial.758\n\nThe virulence of rhinovirus is maximum in infants before 1 year of age (median age is 6.5 monthsj760 and in immune compromised children.?61 Wheezing is associated with RSV in children younger than 2 years of age and with rhinovirus in those over age 2. 762 Simultaneous infection by more than one virus, such as RSV and adenovirus together, can also occur frequently in the pediatric population.P\" Many children can also have associated bacterial infection, such as Haemophilus influenzae conjunctivitis. 760 The viruses gain entry into host cells through specific viral surface proteins, which cause tissue injury and result in clinical disease,763 Recent studies suggest that it is the host's response to the virus, not the virus itself, that determines the pathogenesis and severity of the common cold. Pro-inflammatory mediators, especially the cytokines, appear to be the central component of the response by infected epithelial cells. 764,765 Specific viral diagnosis is not necessary, both because of the benign, self-limiting nature of the disease,766 and also because the prevalence of different viruses overlaps from fall to spring, so that it is very difficult to determine precisely which virus or viruses are causing the symptoms,?55 Current medical management of URI remains symptomatic, controversial, and in most cases, ineffective. Fluid, rest, a humidifier, and saline nose drops constitute the mainstay of nonpharmacologic treatment. The role of vitamin C both in prevention and in treatment of the common cold remains contro-versiaF67,768 Topical adrenergic agents do not have systemic side-effects, but overuse can result in rebound congestion. 769 Systemic medications are primarily used for symptomatic relief of congestion and cough, and most have limited efficacy,765 Antihistamine and combinations of antihistamine with decongestants are the ingredients in at least 800 over-thecounter (OTC) cold remedies. The majority of studies have concluded that antihistamines are of marginal or no benefit in treating cold symptoms,?57,769-773 Dextromethorphan is an antitussive that is abundant in OTC formulations. Although this medication is reportedly safe when taken in the recommended dosages, there have been cases of \"recreational\" use by teenagers and deaths by overdose have been reported. 772 Codeine is ineffective in controlling URI cough.?73 Antibiotics are not indicated for the common cold,757 but are often overprescribed, leading not only to higher health care costs 774 increased risk of side-effects, but also to the emergence of more resistant strains of bacteria, 775 Research for new medical therapies for the common cold is directed toward increasing resistance to or immunity against the viruses. Interferons are proteins that can induce a nonspecific resistance to viral infection. However, the usual route of administration is by intramuscular injection, usually given on a daily basis because its blood concentration decreases sharply within 24 hours. In view of the self-limiting nature of URI, and the trauma of daily injections, it is unlikely that interferon would be used to treat URI in children. 776 Histamine antagonists are not indicated in the common cold. 777 Anti-inflammatory mediators 764 and specific antiviral agents 778 may be promising. Development of an effective vaccine against the common cold is unlikely because of the large number of viral serotypes.?56 Rhinovirus, for example, has at least 100 different immunotypes. 765 Although viral URI is a benign illness of short duration, it can lead to bacterial complications, such as otitis media, sinusitis and lower respiratory tract infections, or even mastoiditis and meningitis that have much more significant consequences in children. 761,779 Antibiotics are appropriate for otitis and sinusitis. 780 Younger infants are especially susceptible to development of more serious bacterial infections. A 3-week-old baby with low-grade fever and congestion may warrant a full septic workup to rule out sepsis and meningitis, whereas a school-aged child is simply kept home from school and given symptomatic treatment for congestion and antipyretics for fever.\n\nURI correlates to Wind-Cold invasion, discussed in detail in Chapter 6. The Chinese and Western medicine concepts of the etiology of URI are similar: virus infection is the external \"Cold\" pathogen transmitted via \"Wind\" or \"airborne droplets.\" While Chinese medicine also prescribes symptomatic treatment and home management, its therapeutic principle focuses simultaneously on \"eliminating the pathogenic factors by supporting the healthy energy,,781 which translates in biochemical terms as improving the immunity and general health of the child. This is especially important in URI because the host response is of primary importance in pathogenesis of URI, and because recurrent URIs are more likely to lead to complications.\n\nCurrent reports support the efficacy of acupuncture for treating the common cold,?82-785 URI is at the Tai Yang level of illness, the most superficial stage of Wind-Cold invasion. Treatment of Bladder points can be beneficial, even in infants. 786 Symptomatic improvement can be substantiated by positive physiologic changes: acupuncture stimulation of LI-20 and LI-4 has been shown to increase the velocity of the nasal mucociliary transport in chronic rhinitis patients;783 a pilot study showed change in nasal airway resistance, although the results were not statistically significant,? 87 Several reports indicate that acupuncture affects the immune system in URI. When acupuncture was pasted with Chinese herbs for treating rhinitis and bronchitis in infants, serum IgM, IgG, Complement C3, and especially IgA levels increased. 413 Needling general Wind-Cold points-Dazhui (GV-14), Fengchi (GB-13), and Quchi (LI-H)-resulted in decrease in temperature, respiratory rate, pulse and blood pressure with a simultaneous increase in the percentage of Tvlymphocyres.U! Even massaging local acupoints was effective in relieving symptoms and in enhancing immune functions with increasing in immune indices that persisted for at least 6 months,?81 One report of acumassage of Yingxiang LI-20 for just 30 seconds resulted in clinical relief from nasal congestion, even though there was no change in nasal airway resistance (NAR) or airflow. 788 These reports are encouraging for parents, since acupressure can be easily learned by nonprofessionals; is well tolerated by children of all ages, including infants; it has no side-effects and costs nothing. While Western medicine has acknowledged that most medications for the common cold are ineffective for symptom relief, none of the preparations has been demonstrated to affect immunity.\n\nAcupuncture can be used to treat URI complications, such as otitis media or sinusitis. In a clinical study of chronic maxillary sinusitis that included children as young as 3 years of age, acupuncture treatment resulted in significant improvement of symptoms. However, because of the danger of rapid progression to more serious sequelae, the author recommends that antibiotics should still be considered for acute sinusitis,?89 \n\nUrinary tract infections (UTI in this section refers only to urinary cystitis and bladder infection) occur frequently in the pediatric population. [790] [791] [792] Approximately 5% of all girls and 0.5% of all boys have at least one UTI urinary tract infection from infancy until their late teenage years. While boys have the highest incidence of UTI in the first year of life and show decreasing episodes of infection with age, girls remain vulnerable until adolescence.Y! UTI in children is often underdiagnosed.P! Both diagnosis and treatment, especially in infants and young children, are challenging to the general pediatrician. The risk factors for developing UTI vary according to the age of the child. Congenital anomalies that cause obstruction and reflux are the major factors that predispose infants and young children to UTI. School-aged children often hold back urine and delay urination for an extended period of time, especially when they are on the playground. Sexual activity is often associated with UTI in the adolescent.P\" Local immunologic impairment of the urinary tract-such as presence of the Pi-blood-group antigen, increased urothelial colonization-also contribute to development of UTI.791\n\nThe overall health and defense of the child is also important in determining the severity of infection.Z'\" The highest incidence for first-time UTI is found in infants below 1 year of age. 796 Urinary tract infection in infants and young children up to 2 years of age is a special challenge for several reasons: (1) the manifestations of UTI in this age group tend to be nonspecific, and often present as unexplained high fever,397 so that the diagnosis can be easily missed and prevalence underestimated; 795,796 (2) it is difficult to obtain a clean, midstream urine in the diaper population; and (3) the young kidney is most vulnerable to infection,797 so that the early infections often rapidly progress to pyelonephriris.P'' Circumcision 797,798 and breast feeding 797 seem to offer some protection against UTI in babies.\n\nThe classic signs and symptoms of urinary cystitis in older children include dysuria-a burning sensation or pain with urination; increased frequency; nocturnal enuresis, abdominal and suprapubic pain, urgency, cloudy (pyuria) or bloody urine (hematurial.P\"\n\nThe Urinary Tract Subcommittee of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Quality Improvement recommends that a culture needs to be performed on an adequately collected, clean-catch urine specimen. In children under age 2, invasive techniques, such as transurethral catheterization or suprapubic bladder tap, are needed to obtain an uncontaminated urine specirnen.P? Greater than 100 000 colonies of bacteria is diagnostic for UTI. The most common organism in children is Escherichia coli,797 accounting for 90% of first episodes of acute cystitis in children and 75% of recurrent infections. 394 The pathogenic virulence of E. coli in UTI is in its ability to adhere to uroepithelial cells and red blood cells. 394 Other enteric bacteria, such as Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Proteus may also cause pediatric UTI. Adolescent girls are susceptible to Staphylococcus saprophyticus. 394 The Subcommittee also recommends that all 2-24-month-olds should undergo complete imaging studies to include ultrasonography and voiding cystourethrogram.P? in order to assess the abnormalities that predispose children to reflux and pyelonephritis and to assess the extent of renal involvement during infection. 7 95,800 There is no agreement on the most appropriate combination of studies in older children,798 since subjecting the child to an invasive procedure is weighed against the low possibility of finding a congenital anomaly. 7 91 Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important in order to prevent pyelonephritic scarring, especially in the first year of life. 801 Renal scarring is associated with development of hypertension in about 10% of children and accounts for approximately 20% of children with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or even renal transplant. 7 96,802 The severity of renal scarring is directly related to delay in diagnosis. 803 Acute infection is managed with antibiotics for 7-14 days if an appropriate clinical response is observed.T'? A repeat microbiologic examination 48-72 hours after institution of treatment, and a follow-up culture within a week after cessation of therapy are recommended. 394,793 Prophylaxis is also important in pediatric UTI. Children who are found to have vesicoureteric reflux are managed with a single, daily dose of antibiotics for 3-6 months in order to prevent recurrence. 394,797,802 Children with underlying genitourinary abnormalities, such as congenital anomalies, obstructive uropathy, need to be treated for at least 1 year. 394 High-risk children, such as siblings, should be investigated for reflux. 802,803 Adolescents should be counseled about the relationship between sexual activities and the development of UTI. 794 Asymptomatic bacteriuria has been a topic of concern for pediatricians. At this time, there does not appear to be any need for general screening for bacteriuria in healthy infants and children. Although bacteriuria may be found in 1-2% of the pediatric population, asymptomatic children have a very high rate of spontaneous clearing of the bacteriuria,796 which in itself does not destroy the renal parenchyma.P!\n\nThere is no data at this time on acupuncture treatment of UTI in children. In a three-armed study from Scandinavia that included real acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and an untreated control group, acupuncture was found to significantly prevent recurrent lower urinary tract infection in adult women. 804 Becauseof scarring and renal complications, an integrative approach to urinary cystitis would be important, especially in infants and young children. Western laboratory confirmation should be used both for making a definitive diagnosis and for follow-up evaluation. Acupuncture can be an adjunctive therapy with antibiotics for acute episodes and as prophylaxis to prevent recurrences.\n\nTCM defines urinary cystitis primarily as Damp Heat in the Bladder. This can occur as an acute Damp Heat invasion, or can be a chronic, recurrent condition due to Spleen deficiency, Liver and Gallbladder Heat, or Kidney Yin deficiency. The acute infections are due to invasion of Heat combined with Dampness in the Bladder. Spleen deficiency predisposes the child to chronic, recurrent infections.\n\nUrine cultures have demonstrated that Bladder infections are caused by bacteria, most often by E. coli. Bacterial infections correlate to external Heat invasion in Chinese medicine. Whereas Wind-Heat invasion has a predilection for the upper parts of the body and causes respiratory symptoms, the source of bacteria for UTI is the gastrointestinal tract. 394 Since the female urethra is anatomically close to the rectum, the gastrointestinal bacteria ascend upward to the bladder, causing urinary bladder infection. The inflammation of Heat from bacteria normally rises, so the presence of Dampness would retain the Heat in the Lower Energizer. External Dampness can easily enter the body by penetrating the leg channels, then flowing upwards to settle in the Bladder. Children contract external Dampness when they sit on damp grass, walk in the rain, or sit by the pool with their feet dangling in water, etc. Adolescent girls are especially prone to invasion of Dampness during their menstrual periods.\n\nWith accumulation of Damp Heat in the Bladder, the water pathways become unregulated, giving rise to such symptoms as frequent, urgent, and painful urination, back pain, and restlessness. Heat may injure the blood vessels in the urinary tract and cause hematuria (blood in the urine).\n\nThe Damp Heat in the urinary system obstructs the water passages, so that the treatment for all Bladder infections needs to expel Heat and dispel Dampness from the Bladder and open water passages.\n\n\u2022 Increase fluid intake, encourage the child to empty the bladder whenever it feels full \u2022 Decrease energetically Hot foods, Phlegm-producing foods \u2022 ST-40 to disperse Dampness \n\nChildren are constitutionally Spleen Qi deficient. They may become more Spleen deficient due to inheritance of weak pre-Heaven Spleen Qi, such as a strong family of Spleen Qi deficiency, Spleen deficiency in both parents during conception, in the mother during pregnancy, due to a diet with excessive sweets, dairy and greasy foods, due to a Damp living environment, and due to chronic illnesses. Spleen Qi deficiency results in Dampness accumulation. Chronic Dampness would in turn further injure the Spleen. When external pathogenic Heat enters the Lower Energizer, Dampness combines with the Heat and tends to settles as Damp Heat in the urinary system since it is the more external Tai Yang channel. Spleen corresponds with the emotions worry and obsession, and with excess mental activities. A careful history would uncover any situations that would predispose to worry, and academic overload or lack of rest due to school or extracurricular activities.\n\nSince both acute and chronic cases of urinary cystitis have Damp Heat in the Bladder, the acute treatments are also applicable for chronic cystitis.\n\n\u2022 Avoid artificially sweetened foods \u2022 Vigorously tonify Spleen with the four-point protocol \u2022 Modify lifestyle to allow the child to feel less pressure from school work and other activities, to minimize worry.\n\nThis condition is rarely seen in babies and very young children, and tends to affect children in the Wood phase of development when Liver and Gallbladder are vulnerable. Heat can accumulate in the Liver and Gallbladder when there is lingering pathogenic Heat, such as with previous Wind-Heat illnesses; from taking excess medications that are metabolized in the Liver; consuming excess greasy foods; or from excess Wood emotion such as frustration, irritability, anger. Most children have some degree of internal Dampness because of constitutional Spleen deficiency aggravated by diet and lifestyle that are injurious to the Spleen, excess Liver Heat is \"pulled\" downward by the Dampness, and becomes Damp Heat in the Bladder.\n\n\u2022 Treatment listed for acute UTI \u2022 Avoid greasy or sour foods \u2022 LR-3 and LR-13 to move Liver Qi \u2022 Disperse Heat in the Liver and Gallbladder channels with four-point protocol: -Liver Heat: tonify LR-8, KI-IO; sedate LR-2, HT-8 -Two points: tonify LR-8; sedate LR-2 -Gallbladder Heat: tonify GB-43, BL-66; sedate GB-38, SI-5 -Two points: tonify GB-43; sedate GB-38 \u2022 Modify lifestyle to diminish stress that causes frustration and irritability \u2022 Decrease medications, especially excessive over-the-counter medications \u2022 Tonify Spleen.\n\nSince Kidney is the foundation of all the Yin and Yang in the body, and since Kidney and Bladder are coupled Yin-Yang organs, Kidney Yin deficiency can easily lead to Bladder Yin deficiency and Bladder Heat accumulation. Since Kidney Yang holds in urine, deficiency in Kidney Yang would therefore lead to increased frequency. Kidney corresponds to the emotion fear. A careful history can uncover any situations that can precipitate fear in the child, such as fear of failure in school, fear of domestic disharmony, and even violence.\n\nWestern medicine is especially concerned that infants and young children with congenital anomalies frequently develop pyelonephritis that can lead to renal scarring, and therefore treat these children with prophylactic antibiotics for a prolonged period of time. Congenital anomalies in Chinese medicine are due to Kidney Yin, specifically Kidney Essence deficiency, and also Kidney Yang deficiency. Although acupuncture cannot correct the anatomic anomalies, which often need to have surgical intervention, acupuncture treatment can \"modify\" the Bladder \"environment\" to minimize Damp Heat accumulation.
