{"title": "Regioselective synthesis of 6-substituted-2-amino-5-bromo-4(3H)- pyrimidinones and evaluation of their antiviral activity", "body": "The efficacy of interferons in mediating an antiviral response in the virus-infected host has been well established [1] . One of the most important approaches adopted in antiviral therapy is the use of interferon inducers [2, 3] . Agents capable of stimulating interferon production range from viruses and bacterial cell walls to synthetic compounds or biopolymers [4] along with a small group of low-molecular-weight compounds (Fig. 1) . Some of the compounds which have been reported to induce interferon include N,Ndioctadecyl-N 0 ,N 0 -bis (2-hydroxyethyl) propanediamine 1 [5] , N,N 0dihexadecyl-m-xylylenediamine 2 [6] , bis(diethy1amino)fluorenone (3, tilorone) [7], 1,5-bis[[(diethylamino)ethyl]amino]-9,10anthraquinone 4 [8] and nucleobase derived 9-benzyl-8-hydroxy adenines 5 [9] .\n\nAlthough the compound 2-amino-5-bromo-6-methyl-4(3H)pyrimidinone 6 ( Fig. 1) has been reported to induce interferon in rodents and cats when administered orally or intraperitoneally [10] , it has been observed to exhibit toxicity-limiting crystal deposition in the renal papillae of rats upon chronic administration [11] . Subsequent studies have demonstrated that the analogue of ABMP, 6-phenylpyrimidinones does not possess this toxicity and exhibits enhanced interferon-inducing antiviral potency and activity [12] . Further biological evaluation of an initial lead candidate in this second-generation pyrimidinone series, 2-amino-5-bromo-6-phenyl-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 7, revealed an intriguing spectrum of immunomodulatory activity which may be related to its antiviral [13] and antitumour activity [14] . In the present study, a highly regioselective and efficacious protocol to prepare C-6 elaborated 2amino-5-bromo-4(3H)-pyrimidinones required for the elucidation of the structureeactivity relationship (SAR) in this pyrimidinone series has been reported. In addition, a rather elaborated antiviral assay of this series of new compounds along with examination of their cytotoxicity has been carried out.\n\nThe compound 2-amino-6-methyl-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 8 was readily synthesized by condensation of the b-ketoester, ethylacetoacetate with guanidine carbonate in ethanoletoluene mixture (Scheme 1), obtaining 65% yield following a reported procedure [13] .\n\nIn order to append different substituents at the C-6 position of compound 8, our synthesis scheme was commenced by protecting the NH 2 group of compound 8 with a tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group using Et 3 N as the base in THF at 40 C to obtain the desired compound 9 with a yield of 47% (Scheme 2) [15] . A metallatione alkylation sequence was used for the synthesis of 6-substituted derivatives of compound 8. In order to fully exploit the synthesis potential of this procedure, the reaction of the lithium derivative of compound 8 with several electrophiles was investigated (Scheme 2). All the compounds exhibited satisfactory characteristic data (vide experimental).\n\nThe anion intermediate 10 was generated in situ by treating compound 9 with n-BuLi (3.1 equiv) in anhydrous THF at 0 C in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen gas. The treatment of 10 with an appropriate electrophile 11 such as ethyl bromide, n-propyl bromide and n-butyl bromide (1.2 equiv, Table 1 ) at 0 C led to the substitution at the more nucleophilic C-6 (vinylogous) methyl. Thus, the formation of the corresponding O/N-alkylated product was not observed. Subsequent quenching with a saturated aqueous solution of NH 4 Cl at 0 C, afforded 6-substituted derivatives 12aec (Scheme 2). These derivatives were then treated with trifluoroacetic acid: methylene chloride (2:8 v/v) mixture at room temperature without further purification to obtain compounds 13aec in good yields (Table 1, entries 1e3) .\n\nSimilarly, compound 9 was subjected to the above-mentioned metallation reaction, followed by quenching with 2-bromoethyl benzene to obtain compound 12d, and subsequent deprotection of 12d produced the desired compound 13d in 70% yield (Table 1) . Likewise, reaction of the anionic intermediate 10 with acetone followed by deprotection of the corresponding 12e produced a good yield of compound 13e. To achieve further diversification at the C6-position of compound 8, reactions of the anionic intermediate 10 were performed with a few aldehydes. Thus, the reaction of compound 9 with n-BuLi followed by reaction with 4chlorobenzaldehyde and 2-trifluoromethylbenzaldehyde and subsequent deprotection of the corresponding intermediates 12f and 12g with TFA produced good yields of compounds 13f and 13g (Table 1, entries 6 and 7). Likewise, reaction of the anionic species 10 with 2,4,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde and 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde and subsequent deprotection with TFA produced good yields of compounds 13h and 13i (Table 1 , entries 8 and 9). Evidently, the formation of 13h and 13i products suggests in situ elimination of water from the corresponding carbinols 12h and 12i, under the acid catalyzed conditions used in the deprotection reaction.\n\nThe 5-bromo substituted analogues of compound 13aei, namely, compounds 14aei, were obtained in good to excellent yields (Table 1 , entries 10e18) through the reaction of the respective compounds 13aei, with bromine in acetic acid at room temperature (Scheme 2).\n\nThe antiviral assays were based on the inhibition of virusinduced cytopathicity in CRFK [Feline corona virus (FIPV) and Feline herpes virus], HEL [herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-1 (KOS), HSV-2 (G), vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and HSV-1 (TK -KOS ACV R )], Vero (parainfluenza-3, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus B4, Coxsackie B4, and Punta Toro virus), HeLa (VSV, Coxsackie virus B4, and respiratory syncytial virus) and MDCK [(influenza A (H1N1, H3N2) and B virus)] cell cultures. Confluent cell cultures in 96-well microtiter plates were inoculated with 100 cell culture inhibitory dose-50 (CCID50) of virus (1 CCID50 is the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures), along with varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Table S1 (see Supporting information) shows the activity and cytotoxicity data of compounds 14aei against various virus strains. The anti-VSV results observed in HeLa cell cultures (Table S1, entry 5) could not be observed in HEL cell cultures (Table S1 , entry 4).\n\nCompound 14h (R \u00bc 2,4,6-(CH 3 ) 3 C 6 H 2 CH]CH) showed activity against the AD-169 (EC 50 \u00bc 11 mM) and Davis strains (EC 50 \u00bc 8.9 mM)\n\nof cytomegalovirus in HEL cell cultures, but its activity was close to its toxicity threshold (Table S1 , entry 1). Similarly, compound 14h also exhibited activity against varicella-zoster virus (VZV) strains [TK \u00fe VZV OKA (EC 50 \u00bc 2.5 mM) and TK \u00c0 VZV 07-1 (EC 50 \u00bc 5.3 mM)] in HEL cell cultures, which was close to its toxicity threshold (Table S1 , entry 2). In CRFK cell cultures, compound 14h presented activity against Feline Herpes Virus at a concentration well below its cellular toxicity threshold (Table S1 , entry 3). However, none of the compounds presented any activity against HSV-1, HSV-2, vaccinia virus and VSV in HEL cell cultures (Table S1 , entry 4). Compounds 14b, 14c, 14f and 14i possessing, respectively, a n-butyl, n-pentyl, 4- with an n-pentyl substituent at the C-6 position had presented pronounced antiviral activity (EC 50 \u00bc 2 mM), it was close to its toxicity threshold (Table S1 , entry 5). Furthermore, the anti-VSV activity was not observed in HEL cell cultures, in which the toxicity of the compound was also lower. In Vero cell cultures, none of the compounds showed any activity against parainfluenza virus, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie virus B4 and Punta Toro virus (Table S1 , entry 6). In MDCK cell cultures, all the compounds were found to be inactive against influenza virus (Table S1, entry 7).\n\nA new series of 2-amino-5-bromo-4(3H)-pyrimidinone derivatives bearing different substituents at the C-6 position were synthesized from the corresponding 2-amino-6-methyl-4(3H)-pyrimidinones in a synthetically useful manner. The obtained derivatives were evaluated for antiviral activity in a series of cell cultures. Although some of the derivatives were found to be active against various virus strains in different cell cultures, they were effective only close to their toxicity threshold.\n\nAll liquid reagents were dried/purified using recommended drying agents and/or distilled over 4 A molecular sieves. 1 H NMR (300 MHz) and 13 C NMR (75 MHz) spectra were recorded in DMSOd 6 and CDCl 3 on a multinuclear Jeol FT-AL-300 instruments with chemical shifts being reported in parts per million (d) relative to internal tetramethylsilane (TMS, d 0.0, 1 H NMR or CDCl 3 , d 77.0, 13 C NMR). Mass spectra were recorded at The Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (CSIR), Jammu, India, under electron impact at 70 eV on a Bruker Daltonics Esquire 3000 spectrometer. Elemental analysis was performed on FLASH EA 112 (Thermoelectron Corporation) analyzer at the Department of Chemistry, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India and the results were presented in percentage (%). IR was recorded on FTIR Shimadzu 8400 Fouriertransform spectrophotometer in the range of 400e4000 cm \u00c01 using KBr. The melting points were determined in open capillaries and were not corrected. For monitoring the progress of a reaction and for comparison purpose, thin layer chromatography was performed on pre-coated aluminium sheets (Merck; 60F 254 , 0.2 mm) using an appropriate solvent system. The chromatograms were visualized under UV light. For column chromatography silica gel (60e120 mesh) was employed and the eluents were ethyl acetate/ hexane mixtures.
