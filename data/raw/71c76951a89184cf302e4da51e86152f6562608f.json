{"title": "The South Korean Hotel Sector's Perspectives on the ' Pre-' and ' Post-event ' Impacts of the Co-hosted 2002 Football World Cup", "body": "It has been claimed that mega-events, such as the 1986 Asian Games and 1988 Seoul Olympics ( Ahn and Ahmed, 1994 ; Ahn and McGahey, 1997 ; Chon and Shin, 1990 ; Hall, 1997a ; Kang and Perdue, 1994 ; Kim and Song, 1998 ; Kwon, 1990 ; Lee and Kwon, 1995 ; Lee et al., 1996 ) and the Daejeon Exposition (Expo) ( Kim and Uysal, 1998 ; Lee and Kwon, 1995 ) have been a critical component in South Korea's tourism expansion, contributing not only to increased international market awareness and visitor numbers but also to the development of tourist infrastructures ( Hall, 1997a ; Kang and Perdue, 1994 ; Kim and Uysal, 1998 ) . Furthermore, Ministry of Culture and Tourism MCT, 2003) have claimed that the 2002 Football World Cup and the 2002 Busan Asian Games also boosted South Koreans ' self-confidence and pride, and helped further develop tour products and infrastructures. For example, in 1965 South Korea had only 37 hotels with 1837 rooms ( Hall, 1997a ; Ministry of Transport (MOT) and Korea National Tourism Corporation (KNTC) ( \u03ed former Korea National Tourism Organisation (KNTO)), 1980) compared to 127 hotels with 19,296 rooms in 1981. At the time of the 1988 Olympics 265 hotels accounted for a total of 33,189 rooms ( Chon and Shin, 1990 ) .\n\nIn the year of the World Cup, there were 526 hotels, which provided 55,579 rooms. This number had increased by 6.7% for hotels and 4.8% for rooms from the year 2001 (when there were 493 hotels and 53,017 rooms in South Korea). By 2005, this figure had increased to 558 hotels with a total of 58,950 rooms (MCT and KNTO, 2006) . The increased interest in South Korea from foreign tourists, and greater leisure time and disposable income for South Koreans has also corresponded with this growth in accommodation ( Chon and Shin, 1990 ; Hall, 1997a; MCT, 2003 ) .\n\nDespite the example of apparent significance of mega-events on the South Korea's case it is only since the 1980s that substantial attention has been paid to their management, marketing, planning and impacts on host societies (e.g. Getz 1998 ; Hall, 1992 Hall, , 1996 Hall, , 2001 Hiller, 1998 ; Page and Hall, 2003 ; Ritchie and Aitken, 1984, 1985; Ritchie and Lyons, 1990 ; Ritchie and Smith, 1991 ) . Furthermore, there has been a tendency to focus on assessing the economic impacts of events in an extemporal context with relatively little attention having been given to the event as part of a broader\n\nThe Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup is the largest single sporting event in the world (FIFA, 1999a) and an extremely expensive event to host ( Preuss, 2007 ) . The Football World Cup has an extremely high international and national profile and is keenly sought after by nations and cities ( Hall, 1992 ) . The 2002 Football World Cup, jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan, was perceived to be an important mega-event for both countries (FIFA, 1996b) due to its potential to boost the host country's economy by direct and indirect effects. At the same time, the World Cup had the potential to enhance the national image of South Korea and Japan as tourist destinations ( Hall, 1992 ; Ritchie, 1984; MCT, 2003) .\n\nMore hotels (especially low-or medium-priced hotels) were constructed in South Korea while the country prepared for the World Cup ( Seoul Metropolitan Government, 2002 ) . More than 232,000 foreign soccer fans visited South Korea during the games ( Hotel and Restaurant, 2002a ; KNTO, 68 Misuk Byeon, Neil Carr and Michael Hall 2002 ) . The receipts from tourism in South Korea in June 2002, the World Cup period, amounted to US$460 million (MCT, 2003) .\n\nThe hotel sector was chosen as the sample population for this study for five reasons. Firstly, the hotel sector is one of the largest sectors of the South Korean tourism and hospitality industry in terms of capital investment and tourist expenditure ( Kim and Uysal, 1998 ) . Secondly, hotels provide the largest number of jobs, generate the greatest multiplier effect outside the industry and are major foreign currency earners ( Kim and Uysal, 1998 ) . Thirdly, in order to bid for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, one of FIFA's requirements of the host country to have compliance with under FIFA's stipulation was secure accommodation for the FIFA's family and delegation ( Lee, 2000 ; WCOIA, 1995 ) . Fourthly, it has been claimed that the hotel sector is the most affected by events due to the direct impact of event related visitor arrivals and the resulting demand for short-term accommodation ( Dwyer et al., 2006 ; McKay and Plumb, 2001 ) . Finally, little research has been specifically undertaken on the perspectives of the hotel sector on the hosting of mega-events ( Shultis et al., 1996; Byeon and Hall, 2003; Byeon, 2008 ) .\n\nThe data for the pre-/post-event impacts study were obtained through a questionnaire using closed question techniques. The questionnaire was first draughted in English and then translated into Korean by the researcher, who is Korean. The questionnaire was designed to identify the Korean hotel industry's perspective on the positive and negative aspects of the Football World Cup 2002 on their individual hotel. A five-point Likert scale ranging from ' strongly disagree ' (1) to ' strongly agree ' (5) was used to rate 24 impact variables of the 2002 Football World Cup for the pre-event impacts study. However, when present results, percentage of ' strongly agree ' and ' agree ' were combined as ' agree ' and ' strongly disagree ' and ' disagree ' were joined as ' disagree ' . Settle (1995, 2004) noted that scales are used to obtain responses which will be comparable to one another and may be regarded as both efficient and practical. Twenty-four impact variables were generated from a combination of several sources of information including Ritchie's (1984) article concerning the analysis of the impact of hallmark events, Hall's (1992) hallmark tourist events book and a review of the Seoul Olympics by Jeong (1987 Jeong ( , 1992 . Table 5 .1 presents 24 pre-event impact study's variables. To make a comparison between the two points in time, including total 24 impact variables of the pre-event impacts study and adding 3 more impact variables which derived from limitation of pre-event impacts study were used to rate. Thus, a total of 27 impact variables were used in the postevent impacts study (see Table 5 .2 ).\n\nThe pre-event impacts survey was administered to the entire hotel industry (as of 19 April 2000) in South Korea. Korean hotels are divided into five classes and they are divided by facilities. The quality of the hotel is symbolised by a Rose of Sharon and exhibited by a bronze shield in the lobby. They are deluxe 1st class ( \u03ed super deluxe, 5 Rose of Sharon), deluxe 2nd class ( \u03ed deluxe, 5 Rose of Sharon), first class (4 Rose of Sharon), second class (3 Rose of Sharon), third class (2 Rose of Sharon) ( KNTO, 2000 ) . Since the hotel classes are divided by facilities, Chi-Square test conducted to see there is any relationship between the hotel class and hotel room numbers ' variables. The results revealed a significant relationship between the two variables in both the pre-and post-event studies.\n\nEven though the entire population was sampled both in the pre-/post-event studies, the two points in time results are predominantly those of first class hotels because factors other than equal Note : Scale indicates 1 \u03ed strongly disagree, 2 \u03ed disagree, 3 \u03ed neutral, 4 \u03ed agree, 5 \u03ed strongly agree, R \u03ed rank, F \u03ed frequency, % \u03ed per cent.\n\np robability of being chosen in each sample may be present. Moreover, 79.8% ( n \u03ed 221) were found to be non-deluxe (first, second and third class) and 20.2% ( n \u03ed 56) were deluxe (deluxe 1st and 2nd class) in the pre-event study and 73.5% ( n \u03ed 216) were revealed to be non-deluxe and 26.5% (n \u03ed 78) were deluxe hotels in the post-event study. Therefore, in the post-event study deluxe hotels were more represented and non-deluxe hotels were less revealing than the pre-event impacts study, both studies ' results would more likely reflect the non-deluxe hotels perspectives of the 2002 Football World Cup. The population was identified from the 1999 and 2000 Korea Hotel Directory (KHD) and Korea Hotel Association (KHA). The total defined hotel population for the pre-event impacts study was 461. However, after confirming hotel details with each hotel (hotel address and name of the general manager (GM) and/or managing director (MD) with information given by 1999 KHD before distribution of the questionnaire to all hotels for the actual survey, the entire hotel industry population differed from the actual number of questionnaires distributed because of changes to the membership base and member's circumstances. Therefore, from the entire Korean hotel population of 461, the actual distributed questionnaire population in the pre-event study was 431 hotels (see Table 5 .3 ).\n\nSince the pre-event impacts study, Korean hotel numbers have grown continuously. As shown in Table 5 .3 , at the time of the post-event survey there were 530 hotels in South Korea (according to KHD as of 22 March 2004). The same procedure was followed as in the pre-event study to confirm hotel details, a total of 468 hotels were approached for the post-event impacts study.\n\nThe survey was mailed to potential respondents and a reply-paid envelope was included, as is standard practise with this distribution method. The mail-out distribution method for the survey was employed as it is one of the most productive methods when attempting to gather information from large and geographically dispersed population Settle, 1995, 2004 ) . Moreover, the mailout method gives advantages to respondents in terms of time convenience to fill out the questionnaire ( Buckingham and Saunders, 2004 ).\n\nAn initial covering letter providing an introduction to the research and a questionnaire with a stamped reply envelope attached was sent to a specific MD and/or GM by name between 25 January and 18 May 2000 (pilot test period, 25 January to 10 February 2000, included) for the pre-event impacts study. Pilot testing was required so that the survey could be modified slightly in content and in structure, and to ensure that mail surveying would do the job reliably Settle, 1995, 2004 ) . Thus, the questionnaire was pilot tested on 15 hotels in South Korea. Since a high response rate was expected from pilot testing, mainly deluxe 1st and 2nd class and first class hotels in 10 HCs were randomly chosen for the pilot test. The results of this research did indeed confirm that deluxe 1st and 2nd class and first class hotels presented high response rates compared with the other hotel classes. The pilot test recorded a 60% ( n \u03ed 9) result, so no amendments were found to be necessary. While conducting the actual survey a few more questionnaires were returned from the pilot survey. 72 Misuk Byeon, Neil Carr and Michael Hall Thus, the final pilot test response rate was 93% ( n \u03ed 14). By the nature of research conducted on the entire South Korean hotel industry, pilot test respondents were included in this study. GMs are viewed as holding the key executive position in the hotel industry ( Ladkin, 1999 ) . They are considered the most knowledgeable and responsible person within the hotel. By sending it to specified personnel it was an attempt to increase the response rate and also hoped that all surveys would be answered by an equivalent person in all hotels. If a hotel did not have a GM position, questionnaires were addressed to the MD or the manager who is equivalent to GM position within the hotel. With the same administration as pre-event impacts study, the post-event impacts survey was conducted between 31 March and 10 September 2004.\n\nNon-respondents were identified from the initial questionnaire distribution list and telephone follow-up calls were made in order to increase the response rate both the pre-and post-event impacts study. During the telephone follow-ups, it was found that some hotels had misplaced or did not receive the questionnaire. Therefore, the questionnaire was sent again during the two time periods survey to those who still wanted to participate in the survey. Fax and email were also used both for the second distribution of questionnaires and their return to save delivering time while conducting the pre-and post-event impacts survey. As presented in Table 5 .3 , in total 277 (64.3%) and 294 (62.8%) replies were received for the pre-and post-event impacts surveys, respectively. From these results, even if this sample population approximates the overall distribution of hotel population in South Korea, it is clear that hotel samples are skewed towards the Seoul area because of the distribution of hotels in South Korea and may therefore be biased.\n\nFrequency counts and percentages for all the responses and mean scores were used to identify significant hotel industry perspectives of the 2002 Football World. Cross-tabulation using the Pearson Chi-Square was performed to identify the association between the two variables and their relationship simultaneously on the contingency table. t -test was undertaken to examine the significant differences between the two time periods mean scores. The following discussion addresses findings related to the two research aims.\n\nProfile of respondents Table 5 .4 summarises the demographic profile of the study respondents. Of the respondents 69.7 % were GMs and 24.2% had worked for 16-20 years in the hotel industry. In terms of the characteristics of the respondents ' hotels, 42.2% were rated as first class hotels (see Table 5 .5 ) and 22.4% were located in Seoul; 55.2% of respondents were located in cities hosting World Cup games. \n\nChi-Square test showed that the majority of the deluxe 1st and 2nd hotels have over 151 rooms in the South Korea hotel industry. Hotels with between 51 and 100 rooms were mostly first class. The majority of third class hotels only had between 1 and 50 rooms. This result indicates that deluxe 1st and 2nd class hotels have more rooms than first, second and third class hotels (Pearson Chi-Square value (PCSV): 240.000; significant level (SL): 0.000). The post-event study also reveals the same results (PCSV: 250.738; SL: 0.000). Respondents who were located in HCs have a greater number of deluxe 1st class ( \u03ed super deluxe) (7.8%), deluxe 2nd class ( \u03ed deluxe) (18.3%) and third class (13.7%) hotels than NHCs (4.8%, 8.3% and 8.1%, respectively). Therefore, deluxe (1st and 2nd) class and HCs have more capacity to cater for guests demand in rooms than non-deluxe hotels and NHCs during mega-event periods.\n\nChi-Square tests conducted on HCs and NHCs and individual hotel variables indicated that there were significant differences between perspectives on HCs and NHCs. As illustrated in Table 5 .6 , eight variables were perceived as significantly different between HCs and NHCs on the individual hotel. HCs registered higher agreement for both positive and negative impact variables than NHCs on their hotels. However, interesting notes that Chi-Square test conducted on Seoul and non-Seoul and variables found that 12 variables were perceived as markedly different between Seoul and non-Seoul (refer to Table 5 .6 ). Hotels located in Seoul revealed higher agreement for both positive and negative impact variables than hotels located in non-Seoul and even hotels located in HCs and NHCs.\n\nMoreover, two Chi-Square tests between Seoul and Busan/non-Seoul and Busan and variables (10 variables had significant relationships), and between Seoul, Gyeonggi and Incheon/non-Seoul, Gyeonggi and Incheon and variables (12 variables had significant relationships) also found that there Note : Figure in the above table denote: 1st row \u03ed PCSV, 2nd row \u03ed SL, 3rd row \u03ed contingency coefficient value; Pre: \u03ed the pre-event, Post \u03ed the post-event; Seoul, G, I/ Non \u03ed Seoul, Gyeonggi, Incheon/Non-Seoul, non-Gyeonggi, non-Incheon; Seoul, G, I and B/Non \u03ed Seoul, Gyeonggi, Incheon and Busan/Non-Seoul, non-Gyeonggi, non-Incheon and non-Busan; For the pre-event ' stimulated conferences, meetings and exhibitions of before, during and after event ' examined into only one variable. However, ' stimulated conferences, meetings and exhibitions before, during and after event ' are examined individually in the post-event study.\n\nwere significant relationships (see Table 5 .6 ). Surprisingly, most of the above significant relationship results again received a higher level of agreement for positive and negative impacts than results of significant relationships between HCs/NHCs and variables. This implies that respondents perceive that Seoul and Busan would get more benefits and costs than the other HCs. Additionally, Seoul, Gyeonggi and Incheon would get more benefits and costs than the other HCs.\n\nProfile of respondents As presented in Table 5 .4 , GM respondents represented 64.6% for the postevent study. Amongst respondents, unlike the pre-event study results, 21.4% had between 21 and 25 years length of work in the hotel industry. Of the respondents 95.9% were males; 45.6% were rated as first class hotels. 52.7% of respondents were located in HCs, and 21.1% of hotels were from located in Seoul. Since the questionnaires were personalised by sending them to named GM/MD, GMs were highly represented amongst the respondents of both the pre-and post-event study. Male respondents were the predominance (97.5% and 95.9%) in the two time periods result (refer to Table 5 .4 ). Table 5 .6 in contrast to the preevent study results, 19 out of 27 variables were perceived as significantly different between HCs and NHCs on their hotel. NHCs registered higher disagreement for both positive and negative impact variables than HCs, on their hotels. This result confirmed the proposition that hosted events are beneficial to the HCs (e.g. Hall, 1989 Hall, , 1992 . This result also indicates that benefits and costs generated from hosting the sports event could be differentiated by the degree of direct (e.g. HCs) or indirect (e.g. NHCs) involvement in the event. The ' direct involvement group ' has significantly more agreement perceptions towards positive and negative impacts than the non-involvement group and the findings of Jeong's (1992) study and this longitudinal study result support this notion. Hotels which benefited from the event experienced increased revenues and increased numbers of international guests during the event. Hotels in Busan showed the highest agreement that revenue had increased during the event, with 59.2% of hotels experiencing this, a significantly higher percentage than hotels not in Busan (PCSV: 13.836;SL: 0.008). In addition, in HCs, 45.4% of hotels considered that they had experienced increased revenue and in the group that consists of Seoul, Gyeonggi, Incheon and Busan, 46.4% agreed that there was increased revenue due to the event.\n\nUnlikely the pre-event study results, only three variables are significantly different between hotels located in Seoul and non-Seoul (see Table 5 .6 ). Not unsurprisingly, hotels located in non-Seoul (46.3%) showed higher agreement for ' increased your hotel room prices ' variable (PCSV: 14.914;SL: 0.005) than hotels located in Seoul (35%), HCs (27.5%) and NHCs (13.0%) (PCSV:19.380;SL: 0.001). Interesting note that hotels located in Seoul, Gyeonggi and Incheon (35.7%) (where are Seoul metropolitan areas) showed the high level of agreement on ' increased their hotel room prices ' (PCSV: 18.364;SL: 0.001).\n\nIt is interesting to note that prior to the games, respondents believed that Seoul would receive more benefits and incur more costs than other HCs. This prior to the World Cup's result might be influenced by 1988 Seoul Olympics ' actual impacts outcome which Seoul gained great benefit because usually Olympics are held in one city. Likewise, traditionally Seoul already has the most international visitors compared to other HCs (84.7% of visitors visited Seoul, followed by Busan (17.8%) and Jeju Island (8.2%) while visiting South Korea) ( KNTO, 2001 ) . However, after the 78 Misuk Byeon, Neil Carr and Michael Hall actual tournament outcomes, the hotel sector perceived that each HCs ' actual benefits from the World Cup were significantly different amongst cities. It is because of the characteristic of Football World Cup which was hosted in 10 cities.\n\nEven though the entire population was sampled both in the pre-/post-event study, the two points in time results are predominantly those of first class hotels because factors other than equal probability of being chosen in each sample may be present. Moreover, 79.8% ( n \u03ed 221) were found to be non-deluxe (first, second and third class) and 20.2% ( n \u03ed 56) were deluxe (deluxe 1st and 2nd class) in the pre-event study and 73.5% ( n \u03ed 216) were revealed to be non-deluxe and 26.5% ( n \u03ed 78) were deluxe hotels in the post-event study. Even though, in the post-event study deluxe hotels were more represented and non-deluxe hotels were less revealed than the pre-event impacts study, both study's results would more likely reflect the non-deluxe hotels perspectives of the 2002 Football World Cup.\n\nThe pre-event impacts Table 5 .1 shows the impact variable results of the pre-event study. From the perspective of individual hotels, the highest ranking benefit was in terms of tourism and commercial impacts, namely that the World Cup would increase international guests during the hosting of the event (mean \u03ed 3.79) (see Figure 5 .1 ). Economic impact such as ' increases revenues ' was the second \n\nThe pre-event The post-event \n\nThe result of a Chi-Square test showed that 70.9% of deluxe (deluxe 1st and 2nd class) hotels perceived that the World Cup would increase revenue in relation to their hotel. While 55.9% and 45.1% of first and second class hotels showed agreement with ' increases revenue ' in relation to their hotels respectively, only 35.5% of third class hotels showed positive agreement (PCSV: 39.461; SL: 0.000) (see Table 5 .7 ). As shown in Table 5 .8 , 85.7% of deluxe (deluxe 1st and 2nd class) hotels agreed that the World Cup would increase international guests during the event (PCSV: 20.703; SL: 0.000). These results reflect Chon and Shin's (1990) note that deluxe class hotels that cater mostly to \n\ni nternational visitors experience the highest occupancy rates in general. Moreover, FIFA's accommodation request to the host country for FIFA's family and press are mainly for super deluxe, deluxe and first class hotels ( Lee, 2000 ; WCOIA, 1995 ) . Deluxe (deluxe1st and 2nd class) hotels showed higher agreement (51.9%) on ' increase hotel room prices ' than first (30.7%), second (17.2%) and third (19.4%) class (PCSV: 32.395;SL: 0.001;62.5% of deluxe (deluxe 1st and 2nd class) hotels agreed that the World Cup would increase their hotel staff's pride (PCSV: 10.980; SL: 0.027). Table 5 .2 presents the overall variable results of the post-event study.\n\nRespondents revealed the outcomes of actual experiences of the games that the 2002 World Cup increased international guests during the event (mean \u03ed 2.84) which received the highest mean score (refer to Figure 5 .1 ). As presented in Figures 5.2 and 5.3 and Tables 5.1 and 5.2 , inconsistent with the pre-event study results, the second highest gained benefit from the World Cup was ' increased their hotel staff's pride ' (mean \u03ed 2.81) followed by ' increased the revenue of your hotel (mean \u03ed 2.80). As shown in Figure 5 .3 , notably, ' benefits outweighed any disadvantages associated with event ' variable (mean \u03ed 2.48) ranked higher in the post-event study (ranked 4) than the pre-event study (ranked 9, mean \u03ed 3.09). ' Improved your relations with sports associations and/or organisations ' and ' increased your hotel room prices ' variables also noticeably showed higher r anking in the post-event study (ranked 7th and 8th, respectively) than the pre-event study (ranked 13th and 15th, respectively) (see Figures 5.2 and 5.3 , Tables 5.1 and 5.2 ). However, ' increased domestic guests during the event ' 82 Misuk Byeon, Neil Carr and Michael Hall markedly ranked lower after the games (ranked 10th, mean \u03ed 2.17) than prior to the games (ranked 5th, mean \u03ed 3.25) and generated high differences in mean score (1.07) between the two points in time (refer to Figure 5 .1 , Tables 5.1 and 5.2 ). The respondents experienced very low agreement on the ' created/increased additional employment in your hotel ' (mean \u03ed 1.87). This variable created the largest gap mean score (1.35) between the two time periods. Whereas the ' reduced hotel tax in your hotel ' generated the smallest gap mean score (0.33) between two points in time (the pre-event study mean: 2.46; the post-event study mean: 2.13) (see Figure 5 .2. , Tables 5.1 and 5.2 ). As illustrated in Figure 5 .5 , ' underutilised hotel facilities after the event has ended ' (mean \u03ed 2.04) was experienced as the highest cost followed by ' insufficient parking lots in your hotel ' (mean \u03ed 1.86) . In contrast to some previous research on the negative impact of mega-events ( Hall and Hodges, 1996 ; Olds, 1998 ) the likelihood that the World Cup ' increased prostitution ' and ' increased crime ' received a high level of disagreement again at their hotel (mean \u03ed 1.40 and mean \u03ed 1.38, respectively) (refer to Figure 5 .4 , Table 5 .2 ). Additionally, results of paired t -tests reported in Table 5 .9 revealed that there were significant differences ( p \u03fd .05) on 26 impact variables between the two points in time.\n\nWhen compared with the pre-event study, only 52.6% of deluxe (deluxe 1st and 2nd class) hotels agreed that the World Cup increased revenue in relation to their hotel; 44% and 52.5% of first and second class hotels showed disagreement with ' increased revenue ' of their hotel respectively, 50% of third class hotels showed negative agreement (only 25%, 25.4% and 22.7% of first, second and third class hotels, respectively, showed agreement on ' increased revenue ' ) (PCSV;25.682, SL: 0.012).\n\nThe Chi-Square test showed there is a significant difference between the types of hotel in terms of how many agreed the World Cup would increase international guests during the event, 59% of deluxe (deluxe 1st and 2nd class) hotels agreed the World Cup increased international guests during the event. In comparison, 43.2%, 52.5% and 50% of first, second and third class hotels showed disagreement with ' increased international guests during the event ' of their hotels respectively, just 34.1%, 26.9% and 27.2% of first, second and third class hotels agreed, respectively, on ' increased international guests during the event ' (PCSV;25.656, SL: 0.012).\n\nDeluxe (deluxe 1st and 2nd class) hotels (56.4%) agreed that the World Cup increased their hotel staff's pride. However, merely 21.2%, 23.3% and 22.7% of first, second and third class hotels agreed, respectively, that the World Cup increased their hotel staff's pride (PCSV;45.656, SL: 0.000).\n\nTourism/commercial impacts Prior to the games, the respondents showed the highest positive agreement that hosting the 2002 World Cup would bring benefits of ' increases international guests during the event ' to their hotels. This result might reflect findings of and Byeon and Hall's (2003) national levels the highest positive agreement on ' increases international visitors to Korea during the event ' (ranked 1st and mean \u03ed 4.22) and high positive agreement of ' increases hotel occupancy rates ' at a national level (ranked 3rd, mean \u03ed 4.16). Even though, judged by mean score, the hotel sector perceived that it did not receive benefit from the co-hosted 2002 World Cup. This consistent finding in both the pre-and post-event study supports previous literature that resulting events brings international visitors to the country ( Hall, 1992 ; Ritchie, 1984 ) thus increased international guests to the hotel sector ( Dwyer et al., 2006 ) . However, there were also domestic guests displacement occurred during the event. This result indicates that domestic guests probably stayed away during the World Cup because of a possible perception that the event would be marked by inflated prices, crowds and difficulties in finding accommodation. Regular tourists can be displaced when events take up available accommodation ( Getz, 2004 ) . Note : For the pre-event ' stimulated conferences, meetings and exhibitions of before, during and after event ' are examined into only one variable. However, ' stimulated conferences, meetings and exhibitions before, during and after event ' are examined individually in the post-event study. Therefore, pared t -tested tests for both events are done by three variables in the postevent with the one variable of the pre-event.\n\n84 Misuk Byeon, Neil Carr and Michael Hall However, Ohmann, et al. (2006) study found that displacement due to an increase of rents and house prices in preparation for mega-events, as demonstrated by Hall (2001) and Wilkinson (1994) , was not the case in Munich in 2006 Football World Cup. From these results it could be said that perceived impacts of mega-events are differentiated from country to country.\n\nThe pre-event study results indicate that hotel sector highly agreed that individual hotels would benefit economically during the World Cup which is an ambivalent response at the national and city/town level in the findings of and Byeon and Hall (2003) . The pre-event perception is probably due to a direct correlation between ' increases international guests during the event ' (1st ranked) and their accommodation expenditure. In addition, individual hotels do not have to contribute to the costs of staging such national event so therefore their income from the World Cup would be expected to be greater. However, lower ranking agreement on the ' increased the revenue of your hotel ' in the post-event result than the pre-event study supported growing numbers of global critiques on the hosting event and justification for establishing large sports facilities ( Hall, 1992 ; Hiller, 1989 ; Thorne and Munro-Clark, 1989 ) . Kim et al. (2006) also found that the economic benefits were rather a big disappointment for local residents. Those two results may be reflected from outcomes of economic gains from hosted events and confirmed Dwyer et al. (2006) proposition that the actual net impact of events on economic activity are invariably much lower than conventionally estimated.\n\nWhile deluxe 1st class hotels ' occupancy rates decreased by 5.1%, revenue increased by 22% in June 2002 over the previous year due to increase hotel room prices (increased by 32.4% in June 2002 over the previous year) ( Hotel and Restaurant, 2002a ) . During the June 1988 Football World Cup event in France, hotel occupancy rates were only 70% in Paris and visitor numbers had decreased 10% compared with the previous year due to the cancellation of other conferences and exhibitions ( Kim, 1998 ) . Moreover, during the Football World Cup event in Spain (1982) and in Italy (1990) , visitor numbers also decreased 20% and 30%, respectively (ibid).\n\nLikewise, in the year of 1988 Seoul, 1992 Barcelona, 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney suffered a decline in average occupancies during the Olympic year, largely due to the increased level of room supply. While occupancy levels have fallen in all markets in the World Cup and Olympic year, all HC have experienced a substantial increase in average daily rate (ADR) during the mega-events years. The increased room rates have generally been sufficient to offset lower occupancies, as a result, those HCs have recorded an increase in hotel performance as measured by revenue per available room during the Olympic year ( McKay and Plumb, 2001 ) .\n\nGiven this fact and previous mega-events cases it is not surprising that the post-event result revealed higher ranking on ' increased your hotel room prices ' than the pre-event study and generated small gap (difference) mean score (0.53) between the two points in time. A Chi-Square test result indicates that hotels located in non-Seoul area significantly increased room prices during the World Cup. This result, probably due to World Cup, was held in 10 HCs in South Korea thus increased in accommodation demand phenomenon in HCs other than Seoul. From this result it could be said that outcomes of mega-events are differentiated by the types of mega-events such as Olympic or Football World Cup event.\n\nThe largest gap mean score (1.35) between the two time periods on the ' created/increased additional employment in your hotel ' implies that there was not an increased number of employees due to increased demand during the event. During a very short period of time, the increased demand associated with an event may be just met by existing labour working overtime ( Dwyer et al., 2006 ) .\n\nThe ' reduce hotel tax ' (mean \u03ed 2.46) result in the pre-event study indicates that respondents disagree with this variable despite the government having implemented a series of measures since 1997, including financial and tax incentives, to stimulate the development of tourist hotels in order to expand accommodation for foreign visitors (MCT, 1999) . The pre-event study finding might be explained by the probability that the availability of tax incentives from the government is limited to just a few hotels and that such incentives benefit hotels less than other industries who receive a greater level of tax incentive. However, the smallest gap mean score (0.33) between two points in time on the ' reduced hotel tax in your hotel ' indicated that the hotel sector received benefit in reducing hotel tax due to the hosted World Cup. From this result it could be said that perceived impacts of mega-events are differentiated by the government policy.\n\nSocio-cultural impacts Not unsurprisingly, the hotel sector highly disagreed in two time periods that the World Cup ' increases crime and prostitution around hotel areas ' . This is consistent with Jeong's (1987 Jeong's ( , 1992 findings and indicate that unlike other countries or destinations, event related crime and prostitution is perceived as being less likely to happen in South Korea because of the fact that South Korea has strict anti-prostitution laws ( Jeong, 1992 ) . The crime rate fell 11.6% during the World Cup ( Kim, 2002 ) . Likewise, social problems were hardly noticed during the World Cup when prostitution and crime were much less than residents expected in the findings of Kim et al. (2006) . The large majority of respondents also refuted the statement that the co-hosting of the 2006 Football World Cup resulted in a general increase in crime and prostitution ( Ohmann et al., 2006 ) .\n\nPhysical/environmental impacts After the games were over, ' underutilized hotels after the event ' appeared to be the greatest concern of the hosted World Cup. This result implies that there needs diversification of market segmentation to increase occupancy rates and marketing of hotels. Football World Cup boosted up South Korean pride (MCT, 2003 since the winning of hosting over other locations and the winning of events themselves ( Hall, 1989 ) . South Korea's victory against Spain in the quarterfinals of the World Cup on 22 June was the happiest day for Koreans ( Lee, 2002 ) . Although, Labrie (1988) argued that psychological impacts cannot be measured accurately, respondents perceived that World Cup brought pride to hotel staff which revealed higher ranking than prior to the games. Benefits were realised markedly on staff who are working in deluxe hotels. In other words, the results explained that staff from deluxe hotels experienced a greater level of pride about being Korean than staff who worked in non-deluxe hotels. This was might be because staff from deluxe hotels experienced a greater degree of involvement with international guests.\n\nPolitical impacts Even though ' benefits outweighed any disadvantages associated with event ' variable did not receive a higher mean rating than the other top three ranking significant variables, after the games reality result produced higher ranking than the prior games may indicate that, based on actual experience, hosting events are beneficial in overall. Moreover, when comparing with Jeong and Faulkner's (1996) study, the ' benefits outweigh any disadvantage associated with event ' at the city/town level variable result shows that Jeong and Faulkner (1996) received a higher mean (3.27) than Byeon (2002) study (3.15 ). This result explained that perceived impacts from hosting the mega-event could be differentiated by sample population. These results also support the scholars ' perception that while there are costs to having an event, these costs are outweighed by the 86 Misuk Byeon, Neil Carr and Michael Hall benefits and thus cities and nations are willing to host the event (e.g. Hall, 1989 Hall, , 1992 Sparrow, 1989 ) . In addition, hosting the World Cup improved their hotels ' relations with sports associations and/or organisations which can be utilized to bring further benefit to hotels in the future.\n\nThe pre-event research findings indicate that there were perceived benefits by the Korean hotel sector to co-hosting the 2002 Football World Cup. Therefore, the pre-event impacts study result may confirm the belief that the accommodation sector gains benefits from the mega-event.\n\nThe post-event impacts research results produced lower agreement on positive and negative impacts than the pre-event impacts research results. Judged by mean score, the post-games reality revealed that the Korean hotel sector did not feel that they received benefits from the co-hosted 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe pre-event impacts research results may have been influenced by the prospects that respondents could have had high expectations and were highly optimistic about the positive impacts from the 2002 World Cup. A lower mean for the post-event impacts result may be because the benefits of the event were not significant and were given more emphasis as a result of the respondent's experience of the Football World Cup 2002. The notion also confirmed with significant results the different perspectives between HCs and NHCs held by Korean hotel sectors relating to their individual hotels. Kim et al. (2006) also found that after the games residents realised that the benefits generated by the games were lower than they expected. These results may support Hill's (1996) proposition that bidding committees may over-estimate the advantages of holding games but games reality is not. Lower mean score results in the post-event study overall supports one academic group's proposition of critiques on the hosting event.\n\nHowever, the reality of the 2002 World Cup was not affected by mismanagement, but by the impact of several external factors. Lee and Kwon (1998) also already note the panel of experts stated that international tourism demand during the World Cup Games would be highly dependent upon the promotion of the World Cup, capacity of hotel rooms and airline seats, interest in the World Cup by participating countries, and internal and external political circumstances. Since the 11 September terror in 2001, visitor numbers to South Korea already decreased which was a global phenomenon (e.g. in the Asia Pacific region international arrivals decreased by 7.4% in 2001) (MCT and KNTO, 2002 ; MINT e L International Group, 2002 ; WTTC, 2002 ) . In addition after the World Cup in 2003 the tourism industry experienced a decrease in international arrivals due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the war in Iraq (MCT and KNTO, 2004) . Global circumstances were not good for South Korea utilising co-hosted Football event to increase international visitors to South Korea before, during and after the World Cup. Specifically, during the World Cup periods in June 2002 a total of 403,466 visitors travelled to South Korea, a decrease of 12. 4% over 2001 (460,330) (MCT and KNTO, 2002 ) . A main cause of the decrease was the declining number of Japanese tourists by 45% who used to account for 46% of the total inbound travellers (MCT, 2003) .\n\nThis after the reality of the games did not support the findings of and Byeon and Hall's (2003) high mean score (4.13 and ranked 4th out of 53 variables) of ' increases in inbound and outbound tourism between Korea and Japan during the event ' . This is evidence that prior to the games the hotel sector mispredicted the impact of the hosted World Cup. There were many other causes for the decrease of inbound travellers. One of South Korea's major inbound markets, the USA, remains uncertain in the overall economic environment. The most numerous visitors to South Korea, Japan, were in the throes of yet another recession ( MINTe L International Group, 2002 ) . Moreover, because of the co-hosted World Cup with Japan, benefits may have been split and the inspiring performance of its soccer team held them watching at home. The rise of travel costs in\n\nKorea including the hotel room prices also played a role to make them hesitate to come to South Korea (MCT, 2003) . Chinese tourists to South Korea for the event were held back to generate a mere 60,000 decrease from the expected maximum 100,000 due to Chinese travel agents requiring excessive deposit money for returning home (scales from 5 million won up to 10 million won) and the poor performance of the Chinese soccer team (3 defeats in a row with no goals).\n\nMaking the problem worse was FIFA's official agent Byrom Inc. who was in charge of the international ticket sales and hotel rooms (MCT, 2003) . Forcedly and/or voluntarily, Korean hotels signed an agreement with SEAMOS Marketing Ltd (World Cup Accommodation Bureau Korea, WCABK) while in preparation for the World Cup to secure hotel rooms for anticipated visitors that the agreement was unfair to each hotel ( Hotel and Restaurant, 2002c ) . Agreement contents were hotel shall be reserved for the exclusive use of WCABK during the period from 27 May to 2 July 2002. Hotel shall not have the right to change the number of World Cup Rooms which is no less than 70% of each class of hotel room in hotel's entire inventory of guest rooms ( Hotel and Restaurant, 2002b ) . Since the Byrom company could not sell hotel rooms, they cancelled and returned 70.7% (562,863 rooms of the total contract of 796,158 rooms) of blocked rooms to hotels by 30 April 2002. However, it was too late and too difficult to sell rooms to other visitors during the World Cup periods ( Hotel and Restaurant, 2002c ) .\n\nOn the other hand, positive sites for hosting the World Cup was inbound travellers from European and Middle South American regions, where they show soccer fever, registered the record high of 55% and 386% increase, respectively. Such a remarkable increase has shown possible niche markets for the Korean tourism to further develop (MCT, 2003) . Likewise, as deluxe hotels predicted before the games, they were perceived to have received more benefits than non-deluxe hotels. The hotel sectors which gained significant benefits were tourism/commercial, psychological and economic benefits in contrast to Kim et al. (2006) findings of societal and cultural benefits than economic gains for Koreans. From these results it could be said that perceived benefits are differentiated by level of each sample population (private sector, government or residents).\n\nThis study has examined the views of the hotel sector on the pre-/post-event impacts of the 2002 Football World Cup. The study provides perspectives on both hotel industry attitudes towards the impacts of two points in time a mega-event as well as the perceived impact of a World Cup in soccer. Both of these areas are under researched in the event literature. This longitudinal study revealed that the hotel sector's expectation of the benefits from the co-hosted World Cup was higher before the event but reality was not satisfied as they expected. However, deluxe (deluxe 1st and 2nd class) hotels and HCs received benefits from the hosted World Cup the results of which this longitudinal study answered the question of who gets benefit from the hosted sport event even though hotel sector's high expectation was not satisfied in the reality of the games.\n\nEconomic benefit was still ranked highly after the games that confirmed events bring benefit to the accommodation sector. Those deluxe hotels which received economic benefit was due to increased demand pumping up increased hotel room prices whilst remarking lower occupancy rate than previous years. Likewise, clearly, hosting a mega-event generated and increased international guest numbers whilst displacement occurred among domestic guests and possibly non-World Cup international guests.\n\nBecause of these two points in time results were predominantly by non-deluxe hotel (79.8%: pre-event, 73.5%:post-event), losers ' perception dominated winners. Regardless of how events are used there will always be winners and losers in their implementation ( Hall, 1989 ) . Therefore, overall results support critiques on the hosting mega-event that was not enough to justify spending over US$2 billion dollars constructing state-of-the art stadiums in South Korea. However, benefits outweighed costs due to the hosted World Cup perceived by the hotel sector. A question remains.\n\nOn the other hand, it was a once in a lifetime experience which boosted Korean hotel staff's pride. The hosted World Cup has brought future connections with European market to South Korea which needs to be further developed. Events may be used as a tool for development and growth and for personal and institutional goals ( Hall, 1989 ) .\n\nThis longitudinal study has been made to provide some understanding of Football World Cup impacts and has shown that the hotel respondents ' perspectives changed over the period of the study because of differences between the expectations and the realities of the hosted mega-events. The extent of sports events impact on a host community is by no means clear and far more research is needed.\n\nTo conclude this study's findings, this longitudinal study confirmed previous findings of and Byeon and Hall (2003) . The significant benefit and cost impacts of hallmark events differ for each particular event, over time, for each host community (country or region), each level of host community (private sector, city/town and nation), each sample population (private sector, government or residents), for the involvement groups (direct or indirect) and government policy. Thus, from the largest of mega-events through to the smallest non-profit event, the perspective of many stakeholders must be considered. Different planning and policies are thus required to suit different hallmark events in order to maximise benefits and minimise or ameliorate costs and negative impacts. Therefore, on-going monitoring is also required to better manage impacts generated from hallmark events ( Hall, 1992 ) .\n\nAs mega-events are political events ( Hall, 1989 ) , organisers need to understand dynamics of the impact of hosting the event which includes the unpredicted external factors. Therefore, a ' future ' hosts of mega-event needs to be more realistic to the estimation of the event's outcomes. Expecting that the event would bring totally ' honey pot ' into the destination would result in the disappointments. Thus, the future host events need to bring all possibility of displacements into their considerations. Consequently, their historical tourism industry experienced needs to be included into the more precise planning of hosting the mega-event.\n\nSince the event organisers had too much control in hotels due to over-anticipated lack of rooms, each hotel could not do much personal management during the World Cup. Future events organisers need to consider each hotels moderate autonomous management while preparing to host megaevents. Fifty per cent of rooms blocked by event organiser would be ideal. Since South Korean tourism is too much dependent on major visitor markets (Japan, USA and China), Korean tourism organisation need the dynamics of further tourism development and developing new markets (MCT and KNTO, 2002 ) . Hotels are also needed for on-going development of well diversified market mix of leisure, convention/group, commercial and government/airline business to utilise already created hotel facilities and to increase occupancy rates and marketing of hotels.\n\nBecause the survey was conducted solely with the Korean hotel industry, the results are valid only in this context, that is, a different sample population may have different perspectives on the impacts of the co-hosted the Football World Cup 2002. Further research in the area of different sample population perspectives on the co-hosted of the FIFA World Cup 2002 is needed. The perception of different types of lodging could also be measured. Since 2002 World Cup was co-hosted by South Korea and Japan, further research in the area of Japanese perspectives on the co-hosted of the FIFA World Cup 2002 is needed for comparison. Likewise, since the mega-event often has a long-term effect (Ritchie and Aitken 1985; Roche 1994 ; Mihalik and Cummings 1995 ) , on-going long-term post-World Cup 2002 impacts need to be measured. Further research needs to examine with a more critical approach to broader process longitudinally."}
