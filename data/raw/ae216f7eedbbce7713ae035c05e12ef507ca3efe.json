{"title": "Title: Critical Care for Patients with Severe Covid-19 in Sichuan Province, China--A Provincial Cohort Study Novel coRonavirus pneumonia Infected critically ill Patients in Sichuan provincE (SUNRISE) Investigators", "body": "The 2019 novel coronavirus disease has spread globally since its outbreak in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11. Out of over 200,000 patients affected worldwide, approximately 19% are expected to progress to severe or critical disease, which poses a high mortality rate up to 8.1%. 1,2 However, little data has been published regarding critical care for Covid-19.\n\nEarly studies from Wuhan investigated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients affected by . The in-hospital mortality rate ranged from 4.9% to 15%. [3] [4] [5] A recent single-center study reported a 28-day mortality of 61% among 52 critically ill patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and experienced considerable respiratory compromise. 6 Several studies reported a few severe cases of Covid-19, with one in Zhejiang Province 7 , five in Shanxi Province 8 , China. No severe cases were reported in Singapore 9 . The clinical characteristics of 173 patients with severe Covid-19, using data from 30 provinces in China, were described by Guan et al. 2 However, the clinical course, critical care, and patient prognosis of severe Covid-19 remain largely unexplored. 10, 11 Population-based studies regarding these subjects may provide important data to reduce the mortality rate among patients with severe Covid-19. 7 Sichuan province located in the south west of China, with a total area of 486 thousand square kilometers and 83 million population. 12 Since the first reported case of Covid-19 on January 16, 2020, a total of 539 cases have been confirmed in Sichuan. Due to the urban-rural disparities in healthcare, provision of critical care for severely ill patients was centralized by dispatching ICU staff and resources to designated hospitals.\n\nIn this multicenter cohort study (StUdy of 2019 Novel coRonavirus pneumonia Infected critically ill patients in Sichuan provincE, SUNRISE), we aimed to analyze the epidemiology, clinical course and critical care for severe Covid-19 at the provincial level.\n\nTo ensure high quality care despite region-based healthcare disparities, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Health (SPDH) dispatched ICU physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists and resources to designated hospitals. A designated hospital was considered eligible for severe Covid-19 patients if it was covered by ICU physicians and provided advanced respiratory support which was defined as the use of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), non-invasive (NIV), or invasive ventilation (IV). Remote multidisciplinary consultation was arranged to discuss complex patients daily. The number and severity classification 1 of Covid-19 patients in all designated hospitals were required to be reported daily. 8 \n\nThis provincial multicenter cohort study (http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx, ChiCTR2000029758) was initiated by investigators in West China Hospital (WCH) in Sichuan Province. 13 The study involved 21 hospitals designated for severely affected patients, of which 18 were directly caring for patients included in the present study.\n\nData were prospectively collected for patients who were still in the hospital after study enrollment, and otherwise retrospectively collected between January 16 and March 15.\n\nThe study timeline is shown in the supplementary file. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the West China Hospital and the participating hospitals.\n\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient or the patient's legally authorized representative.\n\nConfirmed Covid-19 patients meeting any of the following criteria were included as severe cases: 1) dyspnea or respiratory frequency \u226530/min; 2) pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2) \u226493% without oxygen therapy in resting state; 3) PaO2:FiO2 ratio <300; 4) lung infiltrates >50% within 24-48 hours; 5) respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction. 1 The date of enrollment of each patient was considered day 1 (D1). Covid-19 was diagnosed using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal, pharyngeal swab or sputum specimens by the local Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Patients were followed up from D1 to the end of the study.\n\nPatient characteristics were demonstrated according to the outcome by D28, while the main support methods used were analyzed throughout the study period.\n\nIn the first stage, 13 designated hospitals were included in our study on February 6. In the second stage, another 8 designated hospitals were included on February 12 after obtaining permission from the SPDH to access information regarding daily reported cases of Covid-19. Detailed demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were recorded using the electronic data capture and analysis system (EDC) (more details are provided in the supplementary file). Data entry was completed by physicians and nurses who were trained on the use of EDC and were working in the designated hospitals. Data quality was overseen by a team of senior ICU physicians and statisticians.\n\nIn the special circumstances as stated above, conventional definitions of ICU admission or discharge will not be used because mildly and severely ill patients were treated in the same ward in some cases. We defined D1 as the day when patient met the criteria for severe illness. Patients were categorized into three groups according to clinical outcomes by D28: rapid recovery (RR), prolonged recovery (PR) and no recovery (NR). 1) RR: patient fully meeting the discharge criteria before D28, with normal body temperature \u22653 days, obvious improvement in respiratory symptoms and pulmonary imaging, and twice-negative nucleic acid tests (sampling interval being at least 24 hours) on respiratory samples; 2) PR: patient partially meeting the discharge criteria on D28 and still requiring hospitalization but without advanced respiratory support; 3) NR: death or the patient still in need of advanced respiratory support on D28.\n\nData management, manipulation, and analysis were conducted by a professional epidemiologist and statistician, from a third Clinical Research Center, who did not participate in data collection. To ensure the high quality of database, all missing data and outliers detected were checked by two clinicians independently in the medical records. Then the verified data were collected and transferred for data completion or correction. No imputation was made for missing data. Data are expressed as median (IQR) for continuous variables and number (%) for categorical variables. For continuous variables, Wilcoxon test was applied to assess the difference between patients in one group and others, Kruskal-Wallis test to assess the overall difference among the RR, PR and NR groups. For categorical variables, \u03c72 test or Fisher's exact test were performed according to the distribution of data. Two-sided tests with a significance level of 0.05 were applied. Needs for different respiratory support throughout the study period were assessed using person-day that denoted the use by one person in one day. All the analyses were conducted using R software version 3.6.2 11 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). We used the tydyverse 14 package of to manage daily data and plot the daily use of main support and the pheatmap 15 package to plot the heatmap.\n\nProvince met the criteria for severe Covid-19 and were included in the study, accounting for 15.0% (81/539) of the total provincial patient population. Out of 226 planned designated hospitals, 18 (8.0%) participated in the study. All patients were centralized to the designated hospitals, and 77 patients (95.1%) were admitted by D1 ( Figure 1 ). The median (IQR) durations from the onset of symptoms to the first hospitalization, RT-PCR confirmation and the diagnosis of severe condition were 3 (1-6), 7 (5-10), and 9 (6-11) days, respectively.\n\nThe median age (IQR) of the patients was 50 (39-65) years and 37.0% were female. Of these patients, 37 (45.7%) had travel history to Wuhan, 19 (23.5%) were part of family clusters and 19 (23.5%) had no known contact history. Chronic comorbidities were observed among 43 (53.1%) patients, in which diabetes, hypertension and chronic pulmonary diseases were the most common, accounting for 22.2%, 18.5% and 13.6%, respectively. Forty-one patients (50.6 %) were with an BMI \u226524 kg/m 2 ( Table 1) .\n\nOnly 42 (51.9%) patients had fever on D1 although 69 (85.2%) had a history of fever.\n\nAmong the five predefined criteria for severe illness, PaO2:FiO2 ratio, SPO2, and dyspnea criteria were the most commonly reported, accounting for 87.7%, 66.7% and 27.2%, respectively. All chest images of the patients (80 with CT scan and 1 with chest X-ray) showed bilateral lesions, but only 4 (4.9%) were diagnosed using the imaging criterion. Seventy-six patients (93.8%) were administrated by respiratory support, including 51 (67.9%) by conventional oxygen therapy (COT) through nasal catheter or mask, 13 (16.1%) by NIV, and 8 (9.9%) by HFNC. No patient was intubated or needed ECMO. Six patients developed acute kidney injury (AKI) 16 and 5 met the criteria for septic shock 17 ( Table 1) .\n\nAll patients were followed up and reached the predefined endpoints. Among 81 patients, 53 (65.4%) were regarded as RR and admitted before D28. Eighteen (22.2%) patients were regarded as PR, including 13 still in need of conventional oxygen therapy and 5 awaiting negative results of RT-PCR on D28. Ten patients (12.3%) were in the NR group, including 3 deaths and 7 still in need of advanced respiratory support on D28.\n\nPatients in the NR group tended to be older (p<0.001), had higher Apache II 18 (p=0.01) 13 and SOFA scores 19 (p<0.001), were more likely to have comorbidities (p=0.02) including AKI (p=0.004) than the other groups. C-reaction protein (p=0.02) was higher while lymphocyte (p=0.03) and platelet (p=0.005) were lower in the NR group ( Table   1 ). Among the 3 deceased, one was a 64-year-old female with scleroderma, pulmonary fibrosis and diabetes, one was an 80-year-old female with hypertension and coronary heart disease. Both patients developed severe respiratory failure and died of multi-organ dysfunction. The third patient was a 73-year-old male with hypertension and end-stage renal disease and died from circulatory failure. By March 15, among those who were still hospitalized on D28, 15 were discharged, 9 patients were still hospitalized, and an 81-year-old male died of end-stage chronic pulmonary disease on D45.\n\nDaily respiratory support given to each patient from D1 to D28 were shown in Figure   2 . Of the 81 patients diagnosed severe, 79 (97.5%) used COT, 31 (38.3%) used HFNC, 22 (27.2%) used NIV, 10 (12.3%) used IV, and 1 (1.2%) used ECMO ( Table 2) . Thirtyfour patients (42% of 81) used only COT among which 79.4% discharged before D28.\n\nIn the 25 patients who started with COT and needed escalation to advanced respiratory support methods, 12 (48.0%) were discharged by D28.\n\nAmong patients who were discharged within 28 days, the median duration (IQR) of hospitalization was 18 (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) days. Only COT, HFNC, and NIV were used as 14 respiratory support, for a median duration of 10 (5-14), 0 (0-4), and 0 (0-0) days, respectively. As for PR patients, COT, HFNC, NIV, and IV were used for 18 (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) , 0 (0-7), 0 (0-3), and 0 (0-3) days, respectively. Concerning about the NR patients, the median duration for COT, HFNC, NIV and IV were 3 (1-10), 2.5 (0-11), 0 (0-3), and 2 (0-16) days, respectively. ECMO was used for one day by one patient.\n\nTo describe the needs for respiratory support throughout the study period, we also analyzed the usage of respiratory support along with the daily number of newly diagnosed patients with Covid-19 disease in Sichuan, newly diagnosed severe cases, and patients with severe disease hospitalized (Figure 3) . In total, all forms of respiratory support were used 1579 person-day, of which COT took up 62.7 % (990 person-day), HFNC 19.3% (305 person-day), NIV 9.4% (149 person-day), IV 8.5%\n\n(134 person-day), and ECMO 0.06% (1 person-day).\n\nThe peak needs of respiratory support, which lasted for 20 days and paralleled with hospitalization needs for severely ill patients, had a significant lag of 9 days behind the peak of newly diagnosed patients in Sichuan. During the most demanding days for respiratory support measures, 47 patients with severe disease needed access. Of these demands, 55.3% were COT, 21.3% were HFNC, 12.8% were NIV, and 10.6% were IV.\n\nOther support measures and medical treatment 15 Some patients needed life-saving measures such as renal replacement (5 patients, 6.2%), vasopressors (5, 6.2%), and blood transfusion (6, 7.4%). Other support methods included the prone position, partial parenteral nutrition therapy, analgesics and sedatives, used by 16 (19.8%), 17 (21.0%), and 13 (16.1%) patients, respectively ( \n\nTo our knowledge, it is the first time that the clinical course and critical care of severe Covid-19 patient was demonstrated in detail from the first day when recognized as severe illness to 28-day outcome. Among all the Covid-19 patients Sichuan, only 0.56% (3/539) deceased; even among the severe Covid-19 patients, the rate was 3.7% (3/81), lower than the mortality rates reported elsewhere worldwide 1-6 . Some features of the severe Covid-19 patients were observed in our study: the median duration from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization and D1 was 3 (1-6) and 9 (6-11) days, 16 respectively. Seventy-seven (95.06%) patients were admitted to the designated hospitals with ability to provide critical care by D1. Low PaO2:FO2 ratio was observed among 87.8% of the patients, the highest among the five severity criteria. Conventional oxygen therapy was the most commonly used respiratory support method given to 95.1% of the patients and met 62.7% of all the respiratory support needed.\n\nLimited data has been reported regarding the importance of PaO2:FiO2 ratio in the identification of severe Covid-19. Results in our study suggested that PaO2:FiO2 ratio was a sensitive indicator for early identification of severe Covid-19. On D1 87.8% of the patients in our study had an PaO2:FiO2 ratio lower than 300 mmHg, while the SPO2 was 96 (93-97) %, and 72.8% without symptoms of dyspnea. With the early identification of the severe illness, 93.8% patients were receiving various respiratory support from or before D1, with a median PaO2:FO2 ratio of 204 mmHg. In the previous studies, 4,6 the median PaO2:FO2 ratio on ICU admission reported were much lower (103.8 and 136 mmHg), while many of the studies didn't report the data. [1] [2] [3] 5, 20 It is reasonable to hypothesis that hypoxemia may participate in the inflammation and multiple organ injury 21 if the hypoxic compensatory period was ignored or not timely treated due to limited oxygen support equipment when confronting a surge of patient flow. 22,23 Therefore, we comprehensively analyzed the respiratory support used during the study period. If severely ill patients can be recognized earlier, basic oxygen therapy and close monitoring may suffice, as in the 42% of the patients in our study. This scenario is quite different from that in Wuhan, where more than 80% of patients needed advanced respiratory support. 4, 6 Advanced respiratory support equipment is life-saving but a large availability of conventional oxygen therapy is also necessary. Prioritizing and providing basic care for severe Covid-19 patients should be considered by healthcare providers in early stage.\n\nResources and timing are of critical importance to critical care for severe Covid-19 patients. All the severe Covid-19 patients were centralized to the 18 designated hospitals covering with ICU staff and advanced organ support methods, allowing all patients to receive critical care, albeit at a lower quality than usual. 24 While in other study, only 19.1% of the severe cases were treated in the ICU. 2 In addition, the median duration from symptom onset to admission for critical care in our study was 9 days, while data from Wuhan were 9.5-12 days. 4, 6, 20 The time lag of provision of critical care may have significant impact on patient prognosis. Regarding the duration from symptom onset to hospital visit time, there's obvious difference between studies from Wuhan and outside Wuhan where the mortality rate was much lower than Wuhan. The reported median hospitalization duration was 5-11 days in Wuhan, 3,4,20 while 2-4.5 days in Zhejiang province, 7 Beijing 10 and our study. In the 41 cases study from Wuhan 3 , a significant difference was observed for this duration between ICU and non-ICU patients (8 vs . 1 day, p=0.002) . In our study, because most of our patients were admitted 18 to hospital early, the duration was similar in the RR, PR and NR group (median: 3, 4, and 4.5 days, respectively). Studies with larger sample size including patients from different cities may further clarify the association between admission timing and patient outcomes.\n\nOur study has the following limitations. First, a small part of the data was collected retrospectively, leading to potential incompleteness and inaccuracy for some variables.\n\nWe mitigated this limitation by designating a team of researchers to verify and complete the data. Second, our study was mainly descriptive due to the small sample size; however, this limitation did not detract from our main objective in a relatively well- \n\nOn behalf of all authors, the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest.\n\nHospital.\n\nWe would like to thank Ms. Haixin Miao, Mr. Desong Qiu from Sichuan Zhikang Technology CO., Chengdu, for their help of establishing the electronic data capture and analysis system; We thank Ms. Yu Ma, Mr. Biwei Zhan from Chengdu Urban Planning 25 Information Technic Center for the localization and mapping for the designated hospital.\n\nWe also thank Yi Liu, Ph D. from Shanghai, for his assistance in data visualization. \n\nYes -no. \n\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome-no.
