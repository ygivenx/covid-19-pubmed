{"title": "Bacterial co-infection with H1N1 infection in patients admitted with community acquired pneumonia", "body": "Influenza virus infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. 1 In April-2009, several patients were infected with a novel H1N1 swine-origin influenza virus A in North America 2 and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an influenza pandemic, caused by novel S-OIV A (H1N1) in June 11, 2009. 3 In December 5, 2009 , 208 countries had reported cases and over 10,000 deaths had been registered. In August 10, 2010 the WHO announced that the H1N1 pandemic had moved into the post-pandemic period, and reported a total of 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide. 4 Seasonal and pandemic influenza are frequently complicated by bacterial infections. 5 Bacterial co-infection has been found in around 30% of all cases with seasonal influenza, and the pathogens most often reported include Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. 6 Bacterial co-infection is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality. Bacterial pneumonia complicating influenza infection was a major cause of death during the 1918 influenza pandemic, 7, 8 and during periods of seasonal influenza activity in inter-pandemic periods. 9 Bacterial co-infection was frequently reported in fatal cases during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, 10, 11 with S. pneumoniae as the most frequent pathogen identified. Reports on specific populations such as critically-ill patients found bacterial co-infection ranging from 18% to 33% patients with 2009 influenza A H1N1 virus pneumonia. 12e14 However, the incidence and the role of bacterial coinfection in the outcome of patients with influenza A H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia are not well described in the general population.\n\nWe therefore determined the incidence, risk factors and outcomes of patients with influenza A H1N1 virus-associated community-acquired pneumonia and bacterial co-infection.\n\nThis was a prospective, observational study of 128 consecutive adult patients hospitalized with diagnosis of influenza A (H1N1) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Patients were enrolled from 2 Spanish centers, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona and Hospital La Fe of Valencia, from May-2009 to February-2010. The following information was recorded: demographic data, co-morbidities, time of illness onset and hospital admission, previous antibiotic and corticosteroids therapy, influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, microbiological, chest radiologic, laboratory findings and complications. To determine the severity of illness, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) 15 was calculated in all patients within 24 h from admission. We excluded patients with immunosuppression (e.g., patients with neutropenia after chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, patients with drug-induced immunosuppression as a result of solid-organ transplantation or corticosteroid or cytotoxic therapy, and patients with HIV-related disorders) and health care associated pneumonia (HCAP) patients.\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committees of both centers (Register: 2009/5251). Patients' identification remained anonymous and informed consent was waived due to the observational nature of the study and the fact that this activity is an emergency public health response.\n\nProtocolized samples were performed in all patients with diagnosis of CAP at hospital admission in the two institutions. Samples considered valid for microbiological assessment included, sputum culture, two sets of blood cultures, and urine antigens of S. pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila were applied for all patients. Detection of S. pneumoniae antigen in urine was performed by a rapid immunochromatographic assay (NowTM; Binax, Portland, ME, USA), detection of L. pneumophila serogroup I antigen in urine was performed by an immunoenzymatic comercial method (Legionella Urinary Antigen; Binax). Other additional diagnostic sampling techniques occasionally used were pleural puncture, tracheobronchial aspirates (predefined thresholds !10 5 cfu/ml) and bronchoscopy with quantitative cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage (predefined thresholds ! 10 4 cfu/ml).\n\nSputum and blood samples were obtained for bacterial culture before start of antibiotic therapy in the emergency department. Urine samples for S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila antigen detection were obtained within 24 h after hospital admission. Valid sputum sample criteria were: purulent sample (polymorphonuclear leukocytes ! 25 per high power microscopic field and few squamous epithelial cells 10 per high power microscopic field). Blood samples for serology of atypical pathogens was performed at admission and within the third and sixth week thereafter when possible. This protocol of diagnosis was the same in the two institutions.\n\nAll patients admitted to the hospital in this period with a diagnosis of CAP were tested for influenza A (H1N1) in each institution. Nasopharyngeal-swab specimens were collected at admission, viral diagnosis was performed on RNA from nasopharyngeal-swab swabs in the Microbiology Services of the participant hospitals by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based methods using reagents provided free of charge by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA), the test was performed in accordance with published guidelines from the CDC. 16 In addition, nasopharyngeal-swab specimens from all patients were tested with the use of multiplex PCR using the xTAG1 RVP FAST Assay (LuminexeAbbott Molecular, Wiesbaden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions for qualitative detection of influenza virus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, human coronavirus (strains 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1), parainfluenza types 1, 2, 3 and 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus. The diagnosis of atypical pneumonia was based on the following tests: a fourfold increase in IgG levels for Mycoplasma pneumoniae ! 1:64; Chlamidophila pneumoniae ! 1:512; L. pneumophila ! 1:256; Coxiella burnetii ! 1:160 or a single increased IgM titer (M. pneumoniae ! 1:16; C. pneumoniae ! 1:16; C. burnetii ! 1:80). IgG was evaluated by complement fixation (Diesse) for L. pneumophila, C. burnetti, C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae; IgM for C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae were evaluated by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) Vircell and Virotec respectively.\n\nDefinition of CAP was based on current Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. 17 Severe CAP was defined as the presence of either one of two major criteria, or at least three of nine minor criteria. 17 Fever was defined as two or more consecutive measurements !38 C. We registered the presence of septic shock 18 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) criteria. 19 A confirmed case was defined as a patient with diagnosis of pneumonia with laboratory-confirmed pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus infection by RT-PCR. Only confirmed cases were included in the current study.\n\nBacterial co-infection was diagnosed in patients with one or more positive cultures obtained from blood, other normally sterile fluids, or valid sputum, bronchoscopic samples and/or positive urinary antigens (S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila) at the time of hospital admission.\n\nCategorical variables were described by frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables were described by means and standard deviations (SD) or the median and interquartile range (IQR) for data not normally distributed (KolmogoroveSmirnov test). Categorical variables were compared with the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Continuous variables were compared using the Student's t-test once normality was demonstrated; otherwise the nonparametric ManneWhitney U test was performed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify variables predictive of patients with bacterial coinfection (dependent variable). The variables analyzed were: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, previous antibiotic, influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, neurological disease, chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) risk class, serum creatinine, serum creatinine kinase, serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, leukocyte, platelets, mechanical ventilation, septic shock, and multilobar infiltration. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to predict 30-day mortality (dependent variable). The independent variables analyzed were those mentioned above plus, Pa0 2 /Fio 2 , mechanical ventilation, bacterial coinfection, bacteremia and ARDS criteria. Variables that showed a significant result univariately (p < 0.1) were included in the multivariate logistic regression backward stepwise model to determine which of them were independently related to prognosis. The HosmereLemeshow goodness-offit test was performed to assess the overall fit of the model. 20 The predictive capacity for bacterial co-infection of continuous variables was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves; the area under the curve (AUC), optimal cut-off value, sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive value, predictive negative value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio were calculated. All tests were two-tailed and significance was set at 5%. All analyses were performed with SPSS version 16.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).\n\nDuring the study period 667 consecutive patients admitted with CAP in both hospitals (302 in Barcelona, 365 in Valencia) were registered. Among them, 128 (19%) patients had influenza A H1N1 pneumonia (57, 19% in Barcelona, and 71, and 19% in Valencia).\n\nThe mean age was 44 AE 17 years (range 18e90); only 15 (12%) patients were older than 65 years. Fifty-one (40%) patients had co-morbidities, 14 (12%) patients were obese (BMI ! 30 and <40) and 1 (1%) patient was morbidly obese (BMI ! 40). Five (4%) patients were pregnant women. The main demographic and clinical characteristics of patients are detailed in Table 1 .\n\nThe median (IQR) time from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 5 (3e9) days. The most frequent symptoms and signs on hospital admission were cough (88%), fever (88%), dyspnea (57%), arthromyalgia (46%), chills (46%), gastrointestinal manifestations (32%), pleural pain (24%), rhinorrhea (10%). Thirty-three (26%) patients had received previous antibiotic treatment before admission. The vast majority of patients were classified as low risk, according to a PSI risk class 3 (112, 88%).\n\nOverall, 42 (33%) patients had bacterial co-infection. The bacterial pathogens identified are summarized in Table 2 . Four (10%) patients with bacterial co-infection had bacteremia (S. pneumoniae in 3 cases and Fusobacterium sp. in 1).\n\nPatients with bacterial co-infection had more frequently COPD, higher PSI risk class and leukocyte and platelets counts, and longer length of hospital stay. There was a non-significant trend for higher serum levels of C-reactive protein, and more frequent need for mechanical ventilation. However, the need for ICU admission, and the rates of septic shock and 30-day hospital mortality were similar among patients with and without bacterial co-infection (Table 1) . Statistically significant variables in the univariate analysis are reported in Table 3 . In multivariate analysis the independent predictors of bacterial co-infection were underlying COPD and increased platelets count at admission. The model was well calibrated with p-value in HosmereLemeshow test 0.41. Using ROC analysis, the optimal cut-point for bacterial co-infection was 181,000 per mm 3 , with AUC 0.63 (0.53e0.73) (74% sensitivity, 51% specificity, 43% predictive positive value, 80% predictive negative value, 1.51 positive likelihood ratio, and 0.51 negative likelihood ratio).\n\nThe antibiotic regimens were fluoroquinolone monotherapy (63, 49%), beta-lactam plus macrolide (30, 23%), fluoroquinolones plus beta-lactam (19, 15%), beta-lactam monotherapy (6, 5%), and other combinations (10, 8%). All patients received oseltamivir at doses of 75 mg bid or 150 mg bid, for 5e10 days. 21 Twenty-seven (24%) patients received prior steroids at admission.\n\nThe empirical antibiotic treatment was inappropriate in 7 (17%) out of 42 cases with bacterial co-infection and only one patient with inappropriate treatment died. The pathogens most frequently associated to inadequate treatment were P. aeruginosa in 5 cases, M. pneumoniae and Fusobacterium in 1 case each.\n\nTwelve (9%) patients died in the hospital, in all cases in the ICU. The characteristics of survivors and non-survivors are detailed in Table 4 .\n\nBacterial co-infection was similarly frequent in nonsurvivors and survivors.\n\nSeveral variables were significantly associated with death in univariate analysis (Table 5 ). In multivariate \n\nBacterial co-infection was frequent (33%) in patients hospitalized with influenza A H1N1 pneumonia. The most relevant predictors of bacterial co-infection were underlying COPD and higher platelet count at admission. Although associated with higher PSI risk class, bacterial co-infection was not related with increased mortality in these patients. This is the first investigation that reports all consecutive patients admitted with influenza A H1N1 pneumonia during the whole 2009e2010 pandemic period at two Spanish hospitals with experience in the study of respiratory infections. Unlike previous trials, 12e14 we included both critically and non-critically ill patients. All patients admitted to the hospital with CAP during this period underwent a systematic microbial investigation that included detection tests for Influenza A H1N1 virus and bacterial pathogens. Interestingly, both hospitals found that 19% cases of hospitalized pneumonia during this pandemic period presented with influenza A H1N1 infection.\n\nThe rate of bacterial co-infection in our series, 33%, was slightly higher than 21% reported for patients with seasonal influenza-associated CAP 22 and for critically-ill ICU patients during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic (18%e33%). 12e14 Reports in fatal cases of influenza A H1N1 shown a great variability in the rate of bacterial pathogens detected at autopsy, ranging from 25% to 55%. 10, 11, 23, 24 The rate of bacterial co-infection in our series could possible be underestimated since 26% of our patients had received previous antibiotics, thus limiting the chance to detect bacterial co-infection. Thus, the true bacterial co-infection rate might be even higher. Indeed, a study using molecular techniques such as MassTag PCR testing for 33 microbial agents in nasopharyngeal swabs found 76% rate of bacterial pathogens in a sample of patients with influenza A H1N1. 25 S. pneumoniae was the most frequent bacterial pathogen in our series. This is in accordance with recent studies evaluating seasonal 22 and novel influenza A H1N1associated pneumonia. 11, 13, 21 Unexpectedly, P. aeruginosa was the second most frequent bacterial pathogen, whereas S. aureus was rarely found, and we did not identify H. influenzae. The presence of P. aeruginosa may be related to the high proportion patients with severe CAP 26, 27 and COPD 17 in the bacterial co-infection group. The absence of H. influenzae in our patients is also unusual. This pathogen was the Abbreviations: OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval; NA, not available; \"\u00fe1 mg/dL\" indicates the increase by one mg/dL; \"\u00fe10 units\" indicates the increase by ten units. most frequent bacterial pathogen identified in patients with Influenza A H1H1 in Argentina. 25 However, the molecular techniques such as PCR used in this study are well known to improve diagnosis of the etiology of CAP. 28 Despite a recent report on three cases of H1N1-associated pneumonia and c-MRSA, 29 we did not find any case of MRSA in our series. As regards to S. aureus, this was the most frequent bacterial pathogen identified in a much selected population of severely immunosuppressed patients with solid organ transplant, 30 which is substantially different that that from the present study. This is the first study to assess the predictors of bacterial co-infection in influenza A H1N1 pneumonia in multivariate analysis. Underlying COPD and increasing platelet counts were independently predictive of the presence of bacterial co-infection in our series. Previous tracheobronchial colonization is frequent in COPD patients. 31 Bacterial pathogens such as S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are frequently reported in COPD exacerbations of bacterial etiology, 32e34 and this may explain the presence of these bacteria as the most frequent bacterial isolates in our patients. Thrombocytosis, as well as thrombocytopenia, was recently described as independent predictor of death from CAP. 35 Platelets are inflammatory cells with an important role in antimicrobial host defenses and hence appear to be a marker of bacterial infection in patients with CAP. In our study higher levels of C-reactive protein at admission were nearly significantly higher in patients with bacterial coinfection. Although we did not measure Procalcitonin, a recent study showed that Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein may potentially assist in the discrimination between severe lower respiratory tract infections of bacterial and 2009 influenza A H1N1 origin. 36 Due to the increasing evidence on the usefulness of biomarkers in the diagnosis and management of CAP. 37 the role of biomarkers to discriminate between patients with influenza A H1N1 with and without bacterial coinfection needs further prospective investigation.\n\nThe overall hospital mortality from influenza A H1N1 pneumonia in our population, 9%, was slightly higher than that expected in patients with CAP in general, 5% 38 and seasonal influenza-associated pneumonia, 4.4%. 22 Although our patients were relatively young in average, age >65 years, together with major severity criteria such as septic shock and the need for invasive ventilation were independent predictors of mortality, as observed in previous studies. 39 Our data do not support a specific impact of bacterial coinfection in the outcome of influenza A H1N1 pneumonia, despite the fact that bacterial co-infection was associated with higher PSI risk class at admission and a trend for worse renal function and more need for mechanical ventilation. However, current severity scores such as PSI have limited value in influenza A H1N1 pneumonia, since they underestimate mortality rates likely due to the your average age of these patients, as recently reported. 40 Two important strengths of our study were that patients were included consecutively avoiding in that way potential bias and that we used a systematic microbiological diagnostic protocol in two centers.\n\nSeveral limitations need to be addressed. First, bacterial co-infections might have been underestimated because 26% cases had received previously antibiotics. Second, the relatively low number of deaths, possibly due to the favorable influence of the administration of oseltamivir to all patients, 21, 41 may limit the identification of other factors potentially related with death.\n\nIn conclusion, our data indicate that bacterial coinfection was frequent in influenza A H1N1 pneumonia, with COPD and increased platelet count as the main predictors. Although associated with higher severe scales at admission, bacterial co-infection did not influence mortality of these patients.
