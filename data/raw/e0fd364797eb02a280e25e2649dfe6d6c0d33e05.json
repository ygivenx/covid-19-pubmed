{"title": "Title 4 Spike-based phylogenetically defined clades within the Alphacoronavirus 1 species 5 6 Authors 7", "body": "The Alphacoronavirus genus is composed of viruses infecting bats, ferrets, mink, cats, dogs, pigs, 71 and humans. The prototypical species Alphacoronavirus 1 is composed of the following prototypical virus 72 strains (6): feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine coronavirus (CCoV), and transmissible gastrointestinal 73 enteric virus (TGEV). FCoV is an Alphacoronavirus of particular interest as it manifests as two distinct 74 biotypes or pathotypes with a highly transmissible form, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) that provokes 75 self-limiting, usually mild enteric tract infections, and a systemic form, feline infectious peritonitis virus 76 (FIPV), typically associated with low transmissibility but high morbidity (7). In the widely accepted \"internal 77 mutation\" hypothesis, it is believed that genetic mutations in the genome of FCoV occur within an infected 78 animal, giving rise to FIPV (8). A similar FIP-like pathogenesis phenomenon is also observed with ferret 79 coronaviruses (FRCoV) (9). While CCoV is a widespread enteric virus of dogs and can occur in highly 80 pathogenic forms, the virus does not manifest itself with FIP-like clinical signs (10). 81\n\nThe coronavirus spike (S) envelope glycoprotein, the main determinant of virus entry, is an 82 essential structural protein as it governs binding to the host cell receptor, mediates viral membrane 83 fusion, and is typically proteolytically processed by host cell proteases to activate its fusogenicity (11, 12) . 84 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/101774 doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 As such, the coronavirus S protein is a crucially important viral component as it determines to a large 85 extent host species, tissue, and cell tropism as well as pathogenicity and transmission. Previous 86 serological characterizations of alphacoronaviruses, based on the antigenicity of the S glycoprotein, have 87 revealed the existence of two FCoV serotypes (serotype I and II) (13-15). Both serotype I and II FCoV 88 can manifest as either FECV and FIPV biotypes. FCoV serotype I is more prevalent in cats than serotype 89 II, but has proved more difficult to culture in vitro (16, 17) . Similarly in strains of CCoV, a common enteric 90 virus of dogs, two serotypes (CCoV I and II) have also been characterized, and are distinguished by 91 genetic differences in the S and ORF3 genes. Serotype II CCoV strains can be further subdivided into the 92 IIa, IIb, and IIc subtypes (10). CCoV IIa and IIb strains are distinguished by differences in the N-terminal 93 domain of the S protein (NTD), where the IIb NTD is closely related to TGEV NTD. The recently 94 characterized IIc subtype of CCoV has been reported in Sweden and in the United States. 95\n\nThe evolution of strains within the Alphacoronavirus 1 species is complex and likely involved a 96 number of recombination events. It is thought that serotype I FCoV and CCoV originated from a common 97 ancestor. A recombination event occurring between a serotype I CCoV with an unknown coronavirus 98 gave rise to serotype II CCoV which acquired a recombinant S protein, distinct from serotype I S 99 envelope glycoprotein. TGEV appears to have originated from a serotype II CCoV (18). Additional, 100 independent recombination events between serotype I FCoV and serotype II CCoV gave rise to serotype 101 II FCoV, such as FIPV WSU-79-1146 and FECV WSU-79-1683, which acquired a serotype II CCoV S 102 protein (19). Furthermore, we have previously shown that CCoV strain A76 also has a recombinant S 103 protein, a product of recombination between serotype I and II CCoV sequences (20) . CCoV-A76 S was 104 shown to have a serotype I-like NTD, while the rest of the protein was serotype II-like. Analysis of 105 coronavirus recombination events within the S protein sequence revealed its modular nature, allowing 106 exchanges of functional domains between co-infecting viruses (5, 20) . 107\n\nBecause of the numerous recombination events occurring within the S gene of Alphacoronavirus 108 1 species, current classification of Alphacoronavirus 1 strains are often not well defined and fail to 109 recapitulate the previously established serotype demarcation. However, in addition to serological 110 differences, serotype I and II S proteins are fundamentally different in several biological aspects. While 111 the receptor for serotype II FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV has been shown to be aminopeptidase N (APN, or 112 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/101774 doi: bioRxiv preprint 5 CD13), the receptor for serotype I strains remains unknown. Furthermore, the S protein of serotype I 113 strains contain an additional cleavage site, the S1/S2 site, which is not present in serotype II or in other 114\n\nAlphacoronavirus S proteins. This site has been shown to be important for cell culture adaptation and 115 pathogenesis of FCoV (21, 22) . Because of the critical role played by the S glycoprotein in virus entry, 116 pathogenesis, and tropism, and since the S proteins of serotype I and II strains differ greatly, we propose 117 a classification of Alphacoronavirus 1 strains into two clades (Alphacoronavirus 1 clade A and B), using a 118 functionally-based S protein sequence classification that reflects the previously determined serologically-119 based demarcation. 120 121\n\nAs a starting point to gain a better understating of the phylogenetic relationships between 123 alphacoronaviruses, we generated a phylogenetic tree of key representative species and strains based 124 on complete genome nucleotide sequence alignment, a method often used to classify coronaviruses (Fig.  125 1A). As expected, the Alphacoronavirus 1 FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV strains formed a well-defined 126 monophyletic group. The analysis also reveals the clearly delineated branching of coronavirus strains that 127 infect ferrets and mink, FrCoV-NL-2010, MinkCoV-WD1127, and MinkCoV-WD1133, which were recently 128\n\nproposed to form a separate species, Alphacoronavirus 2 (23) (Fig. 1A) . Two main subgroupings within 129 the Alphacoronavirus 1 species were observed with CCoV and TGEV partitioning into one subgroup and 130\n\nFCoV forming a second, separate subgroup. However, as shown by the CCoV/FCoV serotype 131 highlighting, the complete genome-based phylogenetic tree fails to cluster CCoV and FCoV strains 132 according to serotype demarcations, and instead groups strains according to their host species. 133\n\nAnalysis based on the ORF1ab polyprotein sequence, reveals very similar phylogenetic 134 relationships within the Alphacoronavirus 1 species, with a branching that partitions FCoV strains in one 135 subgroup and CCoV and TGEV strains in another (Fig. 1B) . In a similar manner than with the complete 136 genome analysis, the ORF1ab polyprotein-based phylogenetic tree fails to group strains according to 137\n\nFCoV and CCoV serotypes. 138\n\nOne of the most distinguishing features found in serotype I FCoV and CCoV is a S protein 139 cleavage site containing a polybasic furin recognition motif at the junction between the S1 receptor-140 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/101774 doi: bioRxiv preprint 6 binding domain and the S2 fusion domain (S1/S2, fig. 2A ). While a furin site at S1/S2 is quite common in 141 betacoronaviruses (e.g. MHV, HCoV-HKU1, and MERS-CoV) and gammacoronaviruses (e.g. IBV), it is 142 not typically found in alphacoronaviruses. This observation highlighted the distinctive nature of serotype I 143 S and prompted us to investigate more closely the phylogenetic relationships of Alphacoronavirus 1 144 members by characterizing their S protein cleavage sites and performing S-protein-based phylogenetic 145 analysis ( fig. 2) . 146\n\nAlignment of protein sequences of various representative alphacoronavirus S1/S2 S cleavage 147 sites reveals a clear demarcation between serotype I and II sequences ( fig. 2A ). Serotype I CCoV and 148\n\nFCoV all contain a 16-19 amino acid insert, with a stretch of basic arginine (R) and lysine (K) residues 149 (R/K-R-X-R-R), flanked by fairly well conserved N-and C-terminal regions. This insert is absent in all 150 serotype II FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV sequences. It is interesting to note that neither ferret, mink, or other 151 alphacoronaviruses contain such insert. This analysis highlights the distinctive feature that appears to be 152 uniquely found in serotype I Alphacoronavirus 1 strains. The lack of an S1/S2 furin site in CCoV-A76 S 153 protein sequence and its good alignment with serotype II sequences is in agreement with the fact that 154 only the NTD of the CCoV-A76 S protein is serotype I-like with the rest of the protein being serotype II-155 like, including the region around the S1/S2 site. with the presence of a stretch of basic residues (arginine/lysine) interrupted by a single bulky hydrophobic 164 residue (phenylalanine/tyrosine) upstream of the S2' site. A less conserved site is found for serotype I 165 FCoV and CCoV, however all are less basic in nature and lack the K-R-K motif observed in all serotype II 166 sequences. In a similar fashion to the alignment at the S1/S2 site, CCoV-A76 S2' site aligned best with 167 serotype II sequences. 168 .

Our approach allows for 198 a better understanding of the complex phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history observed in 199 coronaviruses. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis on S proteins can reveal relationships that are not 200 observed using ORF1ab or complete genome-based analysis. In particular, in a study characterizing 201 novel deltacoronaviruses, Woo and colleagues showed that the S proteins of alphacoronaviruses are 202 more closely related to deltacoronaviruses than to other coronavirus genera (3). During our phylogenetic 203 analyses, we took note of a distinct Alphacoronavirus S protein sequence from the Asian leopard cat 204 coronavirus (accession no. ABQ39958.1) and noticed its much smaller size (1035 amino acids) compared 205 to other alphacoronaviruses (1466 and 1356 amino acids for FCoV-RM and HCoV-NL63 respectively). 206\n\nPhylogenetically, we observed that it was highly divergent and did not cluster with the other 207 alphacoronaviruses analyzed (data not shown). As only an incomplete genomic sequence was available, 208 it was not included in our analyses. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
