{"title": "Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of Children with Coronavirus Disease 2019", "body": "During the last three months, we have witnessed the fast-growing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) swept through China and rapidly spread to all over the world. The etiological agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as a novel pathogen with high infectiousness to general population and relatively high mortality rate. According to the lasted data released by the WHO on 17 th March 2020, 184,976 confirmed cases of were reported in 159 countries and regions globally, causing 7,529 deaths. 1 Currently, the epidemic center has been shifted to Europe and WHO advocated that Europe should learn the lessons from China on infection control. Several COVID-19 studies from the Chinese researchers [2] [3] [4] [5] have provided first-hand knowledge and valuable treatment experiences on the disease for other countries, but most of the studies were targeted at adult patients. Although pediatric cases of COVID-19 were constantly reported, the majority of published studies were case reports or studies with sample size of less than 50 pediatric cases. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] To determine the spectrum of disease in children, we collected and analyzed epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data of 74 pediatric COVID-19 cases in two locations of northern and southern China. We hope our study would further the available knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and provide an insight to treatment strategies and prophylactic control of the disease.\n\nFrom January 20 th to February 27 th of 2020, we retrospectively reviewed electronic medical records of 74 pediatric COVID-19 cases admitted in Qingdao Women's and Children's Hospital and Wuhan Children's Hospital, including data recorded during hospitalization and follow-up period. Baseline information (gender, age, weight, time of onset, time of diagnosis by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, time of admission and discharge), epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiologic findings, treatment, outcome and follow-up data were recorded with standardized data collection forms. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the ethics committee in our hospital (QFELL-KY-2020-11) and written informed consent was obtained from patients' legal guardians prior to enrollment.\n\nDetailed epidemiological data of all cases were collected and classified according to whether the case was household contacts of confirmed adult patients, the sequence of infection within the family, and whether the infected children transmitted the virus to others.\n\nConfirmation of COVID-19 was based on a positive result for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharynx swabs by hospital laboratory, and double-confirmed by local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention using the same RT-PCR protocol. Final decision on COVID-19 diagnosis was made according to WHO interim guidance. 12\n\nAccording to the experts' consensus statement on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in children issued by group of respirology of Chinese Pediatric Society, 13 patients were classified into 5 types: asymptomatic infection, acute upper respiratory tract infection and mild pneumonia, severe pneumonia and critical cases (acute respiratory syndrome, SARS). The type of mild pneumonia was further sub-grouped into subclinical type and clinical type depending on whether the case had clinical manifestation.\n\nCategorical data were expressed as number (%) and continuous data were expressed as median with range or interquartile. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA).\n\nThe funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of this manuscript. The corresponding authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\nNone of the 74 infected children had comorbidities. Detailed data of baseline characteristics of the patients were listed in Table 1 and Figure 1 showed the timeline of disease progression including the following points in time: the date of admission, diagnosis, and discharge and the final date of follow-up.

No children showed obvious positive signs of nervous system and digestive system. The most severe case was a 13-year-old boy with body-weight of 85 kg who presented with high fever and cough at onset of the disease, and his fever lasted for 3 days with a highest body temperature of 39.8 .\n\nDuring hospitalization, he suffered from dyspnea with low proximal oxygen saturation of 92% on room air and had bilateral diffuse breath sounds of crackles which could be heard for 5 days.

During the outbreak, public activities were discouraged, and children spent most of their days at home with strengthened protection from caregivers.\n\nThis study included clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data of 74 pediatric cases of COVID-19 from two children's hospitals within and beyond epidemic center (from southern China and northern China, respectively). All patients were discharged from the hospital after recovery and were followed up for 14 days.\n\nClinical presentations of infected children were distinct from that of adult patients.\n\nExcept for one critically ill patient, 20 (27.03%) cases were asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2, 53 (71.62%) were mild to moderate cases with various manifestations.\n\nAmong adult patients, fever (83.0%-98.6%) and cough (59.4%-82.0%) were the most common and predominant symptoms.

Additionally, fatigue, headache, nausea, and gastrointestinal symptoms were not common among infected children. Nearly half of the children were not admitted to hospital for symptoms; they were found SARS-CoV-2 positive for RT-PCR analysis during quarantine after family members had been diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nLaboratory findings of pediatric patients were also different from adult patients.\n\nPrevious studies have shown leukopenia, lymphopenia, and increased serum levels of CRP in majority of adult patients. [2] [3] [4] [5] Only one third of the 74 pediatric cases in our study had abnormal leukocyte and/or lymphocyte counts, among whom 19 (25.68%) had increased and 4 (5.41%) had decreased number of leukocytes; 6 (8.11%) had elevated and 4 (5.41%) had reduced lymphocytes. Moreover, magnitude of these abnormalities in leukocytes and lymphocytes was relatively small without typical changes. Given that children under 6 years of age have higher lymphocyte counts than adults, further consideration would be warranted for evaluation of these indexes. .

One possible explanation is related to children's immature immune system. Their adaptive immunity is less developed to mount an inflammatory response during immune dysregulation phase induced by viral infection. 23 Relatively stronger humoral responses in children may also contribute to this phenomenon. Innate immunity is able to react more rapidly in response to pathogen invasion than adaptive immunity. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20027078 doi: medRxiv preprint SARS-CoV-2 detection or isolation of viable virus from excretions. 30, 31 Xiao and colleagues demonstrated that viral RNA could exist in stools of COVID-19 patients for 12 days or longer. 30 Previously we found that RT-PCR testing results for SARS-CoV-2 remained positive in feces of three pediatric patients for approximately 4 weeks, a duration much longer than that of respiratory specimens (about 2 weeks). 32 Here we simultaneously conducted nucleic acid testing in nasopharynx swabs and Personalized management should be considered for pediatric patients with COVID-19, more precisely, to symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 who come from families with a cluster of infection. Treatment plan should also be tailored for children. 33 Anti-symptomatic therapies including administration of antipyretics and anti-viral agents, inhalation of interferon, and enhanced nutrition support were given to children with fever and pneumonia.

In such cases, we failed to collect the complete epidemiological information from 6 patients due. Only blood routine, biochemical and infection-related biomarkers were analyzed in this study due to the different standards for laboratory testing between the two hospitals. We were unable to measure the viral loads, or to detect presence of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharynx swabs and fecal specimens for all of our patients.
