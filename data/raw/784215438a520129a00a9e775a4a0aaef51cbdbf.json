{"title": "Multiplexed detection and identification of respiratory pathogens using the NxTAG\u00ae respiratory pathogen panel", "body": "Respiratory tract infection (RTI) involves a wide variety of etiologic agents and presents with overlapping signs and symptoms; therefore, prediction of the causative organism based on clinical findings alone is not reliable [1] . Among the various diagnostic tests available, multiplex nucleic acid amplification assays are capable of detecting and identifying multiple respiratory pathogens and are now commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. The xTAG\u00ae Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) from Luminex\u00ae was the first multiplexed molecular assay for respiratory pathogens cleared for in vitro diagnostic use and was capable of detecting 12-19 common respiratory viruses and subtypes, depending on the geographical region [2] . xTAG RVP incorporated multiplex Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex Target Specific Primer Extension (TSPE) with Luminex's xTAG technology, a proprietary universal sequence tag sorting system that allows easy development and optimization of nucleic acid assays on xMAP\u00ae microspheres. In this assay system, samples are spiked with an internal control and subjected to nucleic acid extraction. Nucleic acid extracts are subjected to multiplex RT-PCR and treated with Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase and Exonuclease I (EXO) to inactivate remaining nucleotides and degrade leftover primers. Multiplex TSPE is then used to detect and label any viral nucleic acids that were amplified by PCR, incorporating the unique sequence tag during extension. At the time of its introduction in 2007, it was a major innovation that revolutionized the approach to diagnosis of respiratory infections. While much faster than traditional culture and immunological tests, the entire xTAG RVP procedure still takes approximately 6-8 h to complete. In addition, as an open platform system, there is a potential risk for cross-contamination after specimen extraction and PCR amplification steps [3] .\n\nSubsequently, Luminex developed the xTAG FAST assay chemistry which employed tagged primers and labeled primers together in a target-specific multiplex RT-PCR assay in order to streamline the workflow and shorten the time to result to approximately 4 h. The FAST version 1 assay incorporated the original non-magnetic xTAG microspheres whereas the version 2 assay is detected on the magnetic MagPlex-TAG microspheres. Following the nucleic acid extraction and multiplex RT-PCR reaction, an aliquot of the amplified and tagged targets are simultaneously hybridized to the xTAG or MagPlex-TAG microspheres and labeled with reporter dye for detection on either the Luminex\u2122 200 or MAGPIX\u00ae analyzer. This format eliminated the post-PCR clean-up and TSPE steps from the workflow entirely, decreased the time to result by about 2-4 h, and reduced the tube opening/transfer steps down to one. xTAG RVP FAST (and/or xTAG RVP FAST v2) was IVD-cleared for 7-17 targets, depending on the geographical region.\n\nNxTAG\u00ae is the newest generation of universal tag sorting chemistry from Luminex. The NxTAG\u00ae Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) was launched in December 2015. NxTAG RPP incorporates multiplex RT-PCR with the universal tag system in the form of lyophilized reagents to provide a closed system for amplification and detection of 20-21 respiratory viral and bacterial targets. All of the PCR and bead hybridization components, including tagged primers, fluorescently-labeled primers, enzyme, dNTPs, buffers, and MagPlex-TAG microspheres, are combined in precise mixtures and lyophilized into small beads or Lyophilized Bead Reagents (LBRs). LBRs are pre-plated into individual wells of a 96-well plate that allows scalable batch testing for 1 to 96 reactions. Extracted total nucleic acid is added to pre-plated LBRs sealed in individual reaction wells by piercing the pipette tip through a foil seal. The reaction is mixed by pipette to resuspend the reaction components and resealed with a fresh foil seal. The reaction is then amplified via RT-PCR and the reaction product undergoes near simultaneous bead hybridization within the single sealed reaction well. No open procedures are needed after nucleic acid extraction and amplification, thereby virtually eliminating the risk for carryover contamination [4] . The hybridized, tagged beads are then sorted and read on the MAGPIX\u00ae instrument, and the signals are analyzed using the NxTAG RPP Assay File for SYNCT\u2122 Software, providing a qualitative call for each of the targets and internal control within each reaction well.\n\nThe \n\nNOTES:\n\n\u2022 Standard precautions should be taken with regard to sample collection, handling, and storage prior to extraction (refer to CLSI MM13-A and Farkas et al.) [5, 6] .\n\n\u2022 Specimens and external controls should be extracted using the bioM\u00e9rieux\u00ae NucliSENS\u00ae easyMAG\u00ae system.\n\n\u2022 Specimens can be stored at 2-8\u00b0C for up to 7 days after collection in Universal Transport Media (UTM\u2122) or equivalent. If the specimen is not going to be tested within 7 days of collection, it may be stored at \u2264\u221270\u00b0C for up to 12 months.\n\n\u2022 Follow your institutional or CLSI guidelines for appropriate run and QC controls. NOTE: When piercing the foil be sure to NOT touch the black adhesive. 9 . Reseal the plate after the sample addition using the precut strips of foil provided. Apply the foil(s) directly on top of the plate and press firmly on and around the wells to ensure a tight seal. Ensure the foil covers the wells and surrounding black adhesive. Do not vortex and spin down the plate. 10. Place the foil-sealed plate in the thermal cycler and run the protocol as described in Step 1. Place a TPE Capmat-96 on top of the sealed plate if using a thermal cycler without an adjustable lid. Ensure the thermal cycler is pre-heated to 42\u00b0C. 11. While waiting for the cycling to complete, prepare the MAGPIX instrument. Refer to \"Instrument Preparation for Data Acquisition\". 12. After the cycling program is complete, do not remove the seal.\n\nTransfer the foil-sealed plate directly to the pre-heated MAGPIX. The plate should be read by the MAGPIX instrument immediately after the end of cycling.\n\nNOTES:\n\n\u2022 Refer to the xPONENT\u00ae for MAGPIX Software User Manual for more information.\n\n\u2022 Refer to the \"Initial Instrument Setup\" section of the product insert the first time the instrument is used for NxTAG RPP.

Nasopharyngeal swab specimens from pediatric or adult subjects who were hospitalized, admitted to a hospital emergency department, visited an outpatient clinic, or resided at a long-term care facility, and exhibited clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection were eligible for inclusion in the prospective study. A total of 2132 clinical specimens that met the study inclusion criteria were prospectively collected from pediatric and adult subjects suspected of having respiratory tract infection. Of these, 934 (43.8%) were collected from January to April 2014 and the remaining 1198 (56.2%) were enrolled between January and March 2015. Table 1 provides a summary of the general demographic information of the prospectively collected nasopharyngeal swabs that were included in the prospective data analysis. Among the 2132 specimens tested by comparator assays (xTAG RVP and bidirectional sequencing), 14.1% were infected with rhinovirus, 12.8% were positive for influenza A, 9.6% were positive for RSV A or B, 6.8% were positive for hMPV (N = 144) and 4.3% were positive for influenza B (N = 91). The prevalence of adenovirus, the coronaviruses (CoV 229E, CoV NL63, CoV 229E, CoV HKU1), parainfluenza viruses (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-2, PIV-3 and PIV-4) and human bocavirus (hBoV) in the study population ranged from 0.1% to 3.0%. The majority of hBoV (96.4%), adenovirus (90.0%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (80.0%), CoV NL63 (80.0%), RSV (72.8%), parainfluenza viruses (71.9%) and hMPV (71.5%) infections were reported in pediatric subjects while other respiratory viruses, including influenza, were generally evenly distributed between age groups. Most influenza A positive specimens were typed as influenza A H3 (75.4%). C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae represented < 0.5% of the infections in the prospective study.\n\nOf the 2132 prospective specimens (95.3%), 2031 generated valid NxTAG RPP results for all analytes on the first attempt. Invalid results were generated for one or more analytes in 101 specimens tested. Invalid results were primarily due to external control failure or nonspecific signals in external controls (3.8% of invalids). Other causes for invalid results included low bead count (0.5%), internal control failure (0.3%), and inconclusive results due to abnormal signals (0.1%). The frequency of invalid results was evenly distributed among the clinical sites. All available residual specimens were re-run with NxTAG RPP and generated valid results upon re-test. \n\nThere were 59 specimens identified as positive by reference method but negative by NxTAG RPP (i.e. RPP false negative). Of these, 35 (59.3%) were confirmed as negative (i.e. reference false positive) by either a FDA-cleared RT-PCR assay routinely used at the clinical sites (BioFire FilmArray RP or xTAG RVP) or by bidirectional sequencing using analytically validated primers that targeted genomic regions distinct from those targeted by NxTAG RPP. The 35 reference false positive specimens included: 14 influenza A, 2 H3 subtype of influenza A, 3 influenza B, 6 hMPV, 1 PIV-2, 1 PIV-3 and 8 rhinovirus/ Table 3 shows the resolved performance values following discrepant analysis.\n\nNxTAG RPP detected a total of 217 mixed infections in the prospective clinical evaluation. This represented 17.9% (217/1211) of NxTAG RPP positive specimens during the study period. 182 (83.9%) were dual infections, 23 (10.6%) were triple infections, 11 (5.1%) were positive for four targets and 1 (0.5%) was positive for five targets. All respiratory pathogens probed by NxTAG RPP (with the exception of C. pneumoniae) were implicated in co-infections. The most prevalent virus involved in mixed infections was enterovirus/rhinovirus (47%), (Fig. 2) .\n\nThe retrospective evaluation included a total of 326 unique, preselected, anonymized, remnant nasopharyngeal swab specimens from pediatric and adult subjects who were confirmed as infected with influenza A H1 subtype, adenovirus, parainfluenza, coronaviruses, C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae or enterovirus D68. NxTAG RPP accurately detected 323 out of 329 (98.2%) viral and bacterial pathogens present in the 326 clinical specimens tested (Table 4 ). Due to the limited number of samples positive for the atypical bacterial pathogens, contrived samples were prepared by spiking varying clinically-relevant concentrations of six strains of C. pneumoniae (1 \u00d7 10 2 to 2 \u00d7 10 6 copies/mL) or six strains of M. pneumoniae (1 \u00d7 10 2 to 2 \u00d7 10 6 copies/mL) into negative clinical specimens [7] [8] [9] . Fifty contrived specimens for each of the two atypical bacteria were prepared and tested along with 50 negative clinical specimens in a randomized, blinded fashion at 3 testing sites. NxTAG RPP was able to detect all concentrations of C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae in the contrived specimens (100%; 50/50; 95% CI, 92.9% to 100%).\n\nThe limit of detection (LoD) for each NxTAG RPP target was assessed by analyzing serial dilutions of simulated samples made from high-titer pathogen stocks from commercial suppliers, or clinical specimens when the target pathogen was not commercially available. All sample dilutions were prepared using Universal Transport Medium (UTM). The LoD titer for each target was defined as the lowest concentration at which \u226595% (\u226519/20) of samples tested generated positive calls. The LoD concentrations varied between targets but the majority was in the range of 3.37 \u00d7 10 \u22123 to 2.82 \u00d7 10 1 TCID50/mL [10, 11] . Three stocks samples were provided in alternate unit measurements and were determined to have the following LoDs: 3.91 \u00d7 10 2 copies/mL for hBoV, 1.57 \u00d7 10 4 copies/mL for CoV HKU1 and 1.42 \u00d7 10 2 CCU/mL (Color Changing Units) [12] .\n\nPotential cross-reactivity of the assay was assessed using pathogens that cause respiratory infections but are not probed by the assay, pathogens that may be found in respiratory specimens, as well as pathogens that the assay is designed to detect. Cross-reactivity was evaluated in simulated specimens prepared by spiking cultured organisms into UTM. Viral and bacterial targets were prepared at 1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID50/mL or 1 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/mL, respectively, or at the highest concentration possible based on the organism stock concentration. Three replicates of each pathogen were extracted and then analyzed with NxTAG RPP. A total of 107 pathogens were tested, of which 80 are not and 27 (21 targets plus additional strains of influenza A H1) are probed by the assay [10, 11] . None of the pathogens included in this study were found to cross-react, with the exception of three strains of non-pandemic influenza A H1 (A/Brisbane/59/07, A/ Solomon Islands/3/2006 and A/Singapore/63/04) (data not shown). These strains cross-reacted with CoV 229E when the titer of the influenza A H1 was above 1 \u00d7 10 4 TCID50/mL. Based on both laboratory testing and in silico prediction, high titers of these three non-pandemic influenza A H1 strains may result in a false positive call for CoV 229E. Based on in silico analysis, there is also a potential that the presence of CoV 229E may cause a false positive influenza H1 call and the presence of PIV-2 may cause a false positive influenza H3 call. Nevertheless no false positive calls were observed with these targets in either the prospective or pre-selected sample sets in the clinical study. Laboratory testing was supplemented with in silico data where prediction rules were used to predict both reactivity and cross-reactivity of specific strains. GenBank sequences for 77 avian, human and swine influenza A strains, 39 adenovirus serotypes, 3 human poliovirus strains and the SARS CoV, were aligned with all primer sequences in the NxTAG RPP. Reactivity and cross-reactivity was predicted based on thermodynamic analysis of mismatches between the primers and genomic sequences. With the exception of one influenza A H5N1 swine strain (A/swine/East Java/UT6010/2007(H5N1)), all strains analyzed are predicted to react with the correct primers but show no cross-reactivity with the other analyte primers in the assay. The H5N1 swine strain is not expected to react with the influenza A primers or any other primers in the assay.\n\nThe accuracy of NxTAG RPP was determined by testing the analytes in the presence of potential interfering substances and organisms that are not probed by the assay. Competitive interference due to pathogens that are probed by NxTAG RPP was also evaluated to assess the effects that clinically relevant co-infections may have on the assay. The NxTAG RPP assay was able to successfully detect all analytes at a concentration of three times the LoD (3x LoD) in the presence of 25 potential interfering substances and organisms (data not shown). Although FluMist did not interfere with the assay's ability to identify other analytes, NxTAG RPP was able to recognize and make a positive call for the attenuated viruses present in the FluMist vaccine as expected (i.e., influenza A, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A H3 and influenza B). In addition, no interference was seen when analytes that are a part of NxTAG RPP were evaluated for competitive interference with one pathogen present at a high titer (1.00 \u00d7 10 5 TCID50/mL), and a second pathogen at a low titer (3x LoD).\n\nRepeatability was assessed for each NxTAG RPP target using multianalyte samples comprised of two to four analytes prepared by spiking cultured organisms into UTM. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from anonymous asymptomatic volunteers were used as negative samples. The spiked samples were assessed at two concentrations: low positive at the LoD (1x LoD) and moderate positive (3x LoD). Each sample set was tested in 20 replicates starting from sample extraction, and assessed in a single run by the same operator using the same set of instruments. For all strains tested, 95-100% of replicates (19 or 20 out of 20) were detected at both the low positive and moderate positive concentrations and the negative samples were negative for all targets.\n\nA reproducibility study was performed to assess the total variability of the NxTAG RPP assay across operators, study sites, testing days and instruments. The assay was evaluated by two operators at each of three sites by testing a 17-member reproducibility panel in triplicate on 5 non-consecutive days, for a total of 30 batch runs (2 operators \u00d7 5 days \u00d7 3 sites). The reproducibility panel was comprised of one negative sample, 8 low positive multi-analyte samples (1x LoD) and 8 medium positive multi-analyte samples (3x LoD) prepared in UTM. For each member of the panel, a total of 90 data points (30 batch runs \u00d7 3 replicates per batch run) were generated. Agreement with the expected result ranged from 94.4 to 100% per analyte and was 99.5% overall.\n\nTo assess the potential for carryover and cross-contamination between reaction wells, a study was conducted using negative samples (UTM) alternating with replicates of a high titer purified nucleic acid sample in a checkerboard pattern in the NxTAG RPP plate. Two representative viral (PIV-3) and bacterial (M. pneumoniae) analytes were examined in separate runs. High titer purified viral nucleic acid samples (1.98 \u00d7 10 5 TCID50/mL for PIV-3 and 1.0 \u00d7 10 6 CCU/mL for M. pneumoniae) were prepared in UTM, in order to obtain positive calls 100.0% of the time and maximize the potential for cross-contamination. No carryover or cross-contamination was observed.\n\nNxTAG is the newest innovation in universal tag sorting chemistry from Luminex and is the basis of the NxTAG RPP assay. This technology retains the advantages of Luminex's xTAG universal array technology while providing several enhancements over its predecessors. As with xTAG technology, NxTAG allows for scalable testing which makes it amenable to both low-and high-throughput applications, providing flexibility for routine daily testing of low specimen volumes but also the ability to handle unpredicted increases in sample volume that may occur. Key advancements with NxTAG technology include: a significantly reduced hands-on-time (\u223c7 min for 8 samples), reduced overall turnaround time (approximately 5 h per batch, including extraction), and most notably, the convenience of all RT-PCR and bead hybridization reagents lyophilized and pre-plated into individual wells. This allows all steps of the assay process (post-extraction) to be carried out in a single, closed tube to both maximize the ease-of-use and minimize the risk of cross-contamination. In addition, to accommodate large sample volumes, it would be possible for the user to automate or semi-automate the post-extraction steps through use of standard automated 96-well plate handlers and pipetting robots. Manual set-up, just using a 96-well plate format for the extracted samples and a multichannel pipettor, allows an entire 96-well NxTAG plate to be set up in less than 10 min. The new assay chemistry also leverages new and updated primer designs for the assay targets, in addition to the workflow enhancements.\n\nAs presented here, the clinical performance is comparable to that of the original xTAG RVP assay, with sensitivities of > 92.9% and specificities of \u226596.3% for most pathogens. Exceptions are noted for PIV-2 and PIV-4, and the bacterial pathogens, where sensitivity values were derived from very few positive specimens, and ranged from 50 to 70%. These two targets exhibited 100% and 97.6% positive agreement in the pre-selected sample set, respectively, where data were generated from 33 and 42 pre-selected positive specimens. A particular strength of a multiplex panel, such as NxTAG RPP, is the ability to detect coinfections. In this study, coinfections were seen in 17.9% of clinical samples. While many of the causative organisms are treated similarly, the ability to accurately detect the organisms present and the most likely pathogen is very important when confronted with several organisms in a sample which are of varying risk to the patient. Furthermore, ability to detect co-infections is most important for organisms that can be treated, such as influenza, RSV, adenovirus, or M. pneumoniae where infection control measures are applied and if the patient population is predominantly immunocompromised. Analytical performance is also similar to somewhat better than the preceding xTAG and xTAG FAST assays, with LoDs ranging from 3.37 \u00d7 10 \u22123 to 2.82 \u00d7 10 1 TCID50/mL as compared to LoDs of 3 \u00d7 10 \u22122 to 8 \u00d7 10 3 TCID50/mL for the previous assays [10, [13] [14] [15] .\n\nPreviously published studies have reported the performance of NxTAG RPP as compared to other multiplex molecular respiratory panels. These studies demonstrate excellent performance of the NxTAG RPP assay and confirm a diagnostic accuracy that is comparable to other commercially available multiplex molecular panels on a variety of assay chemistries, as well as in-house developed tests. Several of these studies are summarized below.\n\nBeckmann and Hirsch compared NxTAG RPP to the RespiFinder-22 (RP-22) multiplex ligation assay in parallel with 282 respiratory specimens [4] . Concordant results were obtained in 93.3% (2 6 3) of samples, with concordant positives in 167 (59.2%) and concordant negatives in 96 (34%). NxTAG RPP identified more co-infections (10.3% vs. 5.9%) and more viral pathogens overall, with most additional positive results involved in dual rhinovirus/RSV infections. Discordant samples were retested by quantitative PCR and showed that NxTAG RPP positive/RP-22 negative samples were mainly due to low pathogen levels, suggesting a higher sensitivity of NxTAG-RPP, and also when detecting multiple infections. Hands-on time after extraction was less for NxTAG RPP (0.25-0.5 vs. 2-4 h), as was total turnaround time (5-7 vs. 8-16 h).\n\nChen and coworkers evaluated the performance of NxTAG RPP in comparison to the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FA-RP) or singleplex real-time PCR as reference [16] . NxTAG RPP demonstrated overall diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 98.9 and 99.0%, respectively. Influenza A H7N9 was also detected by the influenza A virus matrix gene target while the influenza A subtyping gene targets in the panel remained negative. Complete concordance between NxTAG-RPP and FA-RP was observed in 98.8% (318/322) of positive samples with substantial agreement observed for most targets. The authors concluded that with the good diagnostic performance, high sample throughput and reasonable turnaround time, NxTAG RPP is a suitable multiplex platform for routine screening of respiratory specimens in hospitalbased laboratories.\n\nSimilarly, Tang et al. evaluated NxTAG RPP using 404 clinical respiratory specimens previously tested by the FA-RP assay [17] . Clinical sensitivities and specificities ranged from 80.0 to 100.0% and 98.9-100.0%, respectively with 95.5% agreement on influenza A genotype. They suggest that the scalability of 96 reactions in a batch makes the assay a potential solution when high-throughput testing is needed during burdensome nosocomial outbreaks, influenza seasons, and pandemics.\n\nBrotons et al. compared the diagnostic accuracy of NxTAG RPP to the Anyplex II RV16 assay with 319 prospectively collected nasopharyngeal aspirates [18] . A total of 268 of 319 (84.0%) specimens yielded concordant results. Positive percent agreement values ranged from 83.3 to 100%, while the negative percent agreement was > 99% for all targets except for enterovirus/rhinovirus (94.4%). In addition, NxTAG RPP detected single bacterial and mixed viral-bacterial infections in seven samples.\n\nSails and colleagues evaluated NxTAG RPP in comparison to an inhouse laboratory developed multiplex real-time PCR panel on 314 clinical samples [19] . The overall agreement between the assays was very high, as indicated by Kappa coefficients ranging from 0.85 for hMPV up to 0.96 for RSV A and 96.2% agreement for rhinovirus/enterovirus and 100% for influenza A, influenza B, PIV-4 and RSV B. The high sample throughput and low hands-on time make NxTAG RPP suitable for screening clinical samples for respiratory pathogens.\n\nThe NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel is the newest generation of bead-based multiplexing for respiratory pathogen detection available from Luminex. Based on NxTAG chemistry, it provides several advantages over the previous xTAG universal array chemistry. All reaction components are provided lyophilized and pre-plated into individual, sealed reaction wells. Once the extracted nucleic acid sample is added and the well is resealed, there is no further hands-on manipulation. This workflow both maximizes ease-of-use and minimizes risk of cross-contamination. As described in this protocol, after set-up, the reactions are processed on a thermal cycler and then read in the MAGPIX analyzer. The prospective multi-center study and several published studies described herein demonstrate the high accuracy of NxTAG RPP as compared to its xTAG predecessors and other multiplex assays, combined with a simplified workflow, low hands-on-time and scalable throughput that can meet the needs of a variety of laboratory settings."}
