{"title": "Evolutionary rate shifts suggest species-specific adaptation events 1 in HIV-1 and SIV 6", "body": "The Human Immunodeficiency Viruses HIV-1 and HIV-2 are the causative agents of AIDS in 22 humans, infecting millions of people worldwide. Both viruses emerged from a clade of 23 lentiviruses known as the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), which naturally infect a variety 24 of non-human primate species. HIV in humans arose from several independent transmission 25 events of primate SIVs that resulted in HIV-1 groups M and N (from SIV infecting chimpanzees, 26 SIVcpz), HIV-1 groups O and P (from SIV infecting gorillas, SIVgor), and HIV-2 groups A through H 27 (from SIV naturally infecting sooty mangabeys, SIVsmm) [1] [2] [3] . The gorilla infecting lentivirus, 28\n\nSIVgor, is itself a result of a transmission of SIVcpz to gorillas [4, 5] . Phylogenetic analyses date 29 the most common recent ancestors of HIV groups M and O to the beginning of the 20 th century, 30 making it a relatively new human pathogen [6, 7] . Similar analyses of SIVgor date the inception 31 of this virus in the western lowland gorilla population somewhere in the 19 th century [4] . SIVcpz 32 itself was found to be a transmission from other primates, dated at roughly 1500 and leading to 33 the two lineages of SIVcpz: SIVcpzptt infecting the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes 34 troglodytes of central Africa, and SIVcpzpts infecting the Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii 35 chimpanzee subspecies of eastern Africa [5, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . 36\n\nHow viruses are able to cross species barrier is a subject of much interest, since many pandemic 37 human viruses arose from zoonosis events such as the influenza strain of \"Spanish flu\" H1N1, 38 measles virus (MeV), and SARS coronavirus [13] . Due to genetic differences between the hosts, 39 virus adaptation occurs at multiple levels: at the level of entry to target cells; interaction with 40 happened [17] . This is due to new roles gained by these protein sites that constrain their 45 evolution. A reciprocal phenomenon where amino acids are less conserved in one clade than in 46 other clades is also possible, and may either reflect a loss of function or a gain of function 47 manifested as positive diversifying selection. Identification of such \"rate shifting sites\" can thus 48 reveal virus adaptation events, and is expected to promote a better understanding of cross-49 species transmissions in general and in the HIV pandemic in particular in this study. 50\n\nA method for identification of evolutionary rate changes has been previously established and 51 was used to study intra-subtype HIV adaptation events [18] . To date, the lack of SIVcpz and 52 group O full genomic sequences limited the ability to study adaptation across cross-species 53 transmission events. Here, we utilized the growing availability of diverse and full HIV-1 and SIV 54 genomes to identify many sites in various SIVcpz/SIVgor/HIV-1 clades whose evolutionary rate 55 changed across clades [19] . We demonstrate how cross-species transmissions are correlated 56 with abundant evolutionary rate shifts and how known adaptation events are manifested in 57 different amino acid substitution rates between lineages. Based on the rate shift patterns, we 58 suggest previously unknown adaptation events, and highlight the exceptional amount of 59 evolutionary rate shifts observed in HIV-1 group O, possibly due to a more extreme host species 60 barrier. 61\n\nWe have previously developed the RASER tool to identify sites that display change in the rate of 63 evolution along a given branch of a phylogenetic tree (see example in Figure 1) to rate deceleration events, as they likely indicate a gain of function in a protein. In Figure 2 we 87 mapped the percent of rate shifts in each protein observed in each lineage, corresponding to 88 different virus speciation events. While rate deceleration distribution patterns differed between 89 the different lineages (see Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 1), one common theme was that 90 all prominent branches underwent a significant portion of their rate deceleration events in the 91 Env protein. The next two common rate decelerating proteins were Gag and Pol identified in all 92 four highlighted branches, which is expected given that together with Env these are the longest 93 proteins in HIV/SIV. When controlling for protein size (as in Table 1 ), a different pattern 94 emerged: Vpu seems to have undergone a disproportionate portion of rate deceleration events, 95 in particular in the branch leading to group M. In general, the rate deceleration patterns for the 96 non-structural proteins seemed to be branch-specific: In the branch leading to SIVgor and group 97 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

This may indicate a relaxation of prior constraint as the SIV allele was 120 maintained in many HIV-1 sequences. 121 research into the origins of the HIV-1 pandemic and its sources identified several major 126 adaptation events of HIV-1 to its human host. These events include adapting to cellular 127 variations such as differences in host receptor CD4; overcoming host innate immune restriction 128 factors such as Tetherin (BST-2) and APOBEC3G; and of course, evasion from the adaptive 129 immune system [16, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . We therefore sought to evaluate whether the proposed rate shifts 130 agree with the known adaptation events. 131\n\nAnti Tetherin/BST-2 adaptations. Tetherin/BST-2 is a trans-membrane antiviral 132 restriction factor that disrupts the budding phase of the retroviral lifecycle, thus preventing the 133 infection from spreading [26, 27] . SIVcpz and many more SIV's antagonize Tetherin through 134 interactions of their nef protein with the cytoplasmic tail of Tetherin [28, 29] . Tetherin is a fast 135 evolving protein, and differs between chimpanzee, gorilla and human [30, 31] . In humans, a 136 significant deletion in the cytoplasmic tail of Tetherin rendered it invulnerable to the SIV's Nef-137 based counteraction [29] . Therefore, in order to regain infectivity HIV-1 developed an 138 .

In groups M and N, Vpu protein adapted to antagonize 139\n\nTetherin through its transmembrane domain [32] . In group O the virus adapted its Nef protein 140 to counteract the human Tetherin, albeit with less efficiency than in group M [33, 34] . Notably, a 141 single O strain that uses its Vpu protein to encounter human Tetherin has been described [35] . 142\n\nNo anti-Tetherin adaptation event is known to have occurred in the rare group P [36] . In gorilla, 143 the Nef protein adapted to encounter its host's Tetherin but also maintained its ability to 144 encounter the chimpanzee tetherin [37, 38] . In line with these findings, our analysis shows that the branch leading to SIVgor and HIV-177 1 groups O and P experienced 14% of its rate decelerations in the Vif protein, particularly in 178 .

In HIV-1, Vif73 is in close proximity to the A3G-binding motif Vif69-72 that 179 is also responsible in-part for interaction with APOBEC3F (which in itself contains differences in 180 the Vif interacting loop between chimpanzee and human/gorilla) [47] [48] [49] . O-Vif experienced a 181 single rate deceleration in position Vif127, which is located in the Cullin-5 interacting domain [48] . 182\n\nLack of rate deceleration events in M-Vif suggest no adaptation of this protein in this strain to 183 the human host; this is supported by the observation that SIVcpz-Vif can encounter human A3G 184\n\n[46]. 185 Env adaptations. Another major barrier for host jumps lies at the cell entry level. CD4 is 186 the target receptor of SIV and HIV, while CCR5 or CXCR4 act as co-receptors, recognized by the 187 viral Env protein which is exposed to the virus external surface. Previous studies mapped the 188 genetic diversity between different chimpanzees' CD4 and revealed that there are several 189 differences between chimpanzee subspecies as well as differences between chimpanzee versus 190 gorilla and human, especially in the regions that are in close contact with Env subunit gp120 [50, 191 51 ]. Some of those changes affect the glycosylation patterns of CD4, making these differences 192 even more distinguishable [50, 51] . It is therefore likely that HIV-1 had to adapt to recognize 193 these differences in CD4. 194 Our analysis overall supports a high level of deceleration and acceleration events found 195 in Env, possibly reflecting the changes that occurred in the host CD4. For instance, many of the 196 changes in M-Env occurred in CD4 interacting residues of Env374, Env455, Env456 and Env458 [52] . 197 However, we cannot rule out that the very high rate of evolution in Env, driven by the adaptive 198 immune system [53] , have led to changes that \"mimic\" a rate shift. Indeed when accounting for 199 the size of the Env protein, it seems that this protein is less pronounced in its rate shift 200 distribution (Table 1) . 201 .

Position 30 of Gag polyprotein has been previously 202 suggested to be an adaptation event of HIV-1 to its human host, as it diversified from 203 Methionine in SIVcpzptt and SIVgor strains into Lysine or Arginine in many HIV-1 strains [54] . 204\n\nReintroduction of HIV-1 to chimpanzees resulted in reversion of this position back to the 205 conserved Met of SIVcpzptt and therefore it was suggested as an adaptation event to the human 206 host [54] . Notably, subtype C of group M is conserved for Methionine at Gag30, suggesting that 207 adaptation occurred only in some subtypes. 208\n\nOur results indeed suggest an evolutionary rate shift event in Gag30 yet are not 209 conclusive about the branches in which the rate shift happened. This is likely since this site 210 displays a \"content shift\" rather than a strong \"rate shift\" (elaborated in the discussion). 211 Understanding the molecular changes in a pathogen when adapting to infect a new host species 214 is of high importance. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first large-scale 215 approach to detect adaptation events in the transition from non-human primates to humans, 216 and relies on a robust phylogenetic modeling approach. We discovered many lineage-specific 217 adaptation-like events in many proteins of HIV-1, SIVgor and SIVcpzpts, and have reported sites 218 in where groups M and O suggested to undergone parallel rate shifts. The majority of sites 219 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Accordingly, we suggest that the major common barrier for a host species 222 jump is composed of both the entry stage and the stage where the virus must overcome the first 223 barrier of cellular defenses. Our results further support a differential model of adaptation: 224 groups M and O underwent adaptation in different proteins, and when adaptation occurred at 225 similar sites, the amino-acid was different in both groups. This model is supported by the fact 226 that activity of group M and O proteins are indeed different (e.g., Vpu), and by the fact that each 227 group originated from an SIV from a different primate. 228\n\nSince group M is the pandemic strain of HIV-1, we initially expected that it would experience the 229 highest number of rate shift events among all HIV-1 groups, indicating more efficient adaptation 230 to its human host. Surprisingly, our analysis revealed that group O had almost twice the amount 231 of rate shift events, despite being a non-pandemic strain that remained localized mainly to 232 infections in west-central Africa [55, 56] . We suggest that the number of rate shift events is not 233 the determinant of a pandemic strain; it may rather reflect the relative height of the species 234 barrier a strain had to overcome, as chimpanzee from which group M originated is genetically 235 closer to human than gorilla from which group O originated [57, 58] . 236\n\nWe further noted a large number of rate shifts that occurred in the lineage separating the two 237 subspecies of SIVcpz (SIVcpzptt and SIVcpzpts). Presumably these events correspond to 238 adaptations of the virus to the two chimpanzee subspecies, which are genetically divergent. 239\n\nFurther research will be required to understand if and how this has affected the adaptation of 240 the virus to the human host. 241 .

It . https://doi. org/10.1101/190769 doi: bioRxiv preprint Limitations. This study has several limitations. First, the availability of full coverage of SIVcpz 242 and the SIVgor genomes is still low, reducing the statistical power of the analysis. Indeed, we 243 noted that increasing the sample size of group M sequences that are much more available, led 244 to detection of more rate shifting sites (Supplementary File 1) . We expect that the availability of 245 additional SIVgor sequences will increase the number of rate shift events that are unique in that 246 clade, possibly revealing more important sites for this lineage. Second, the method that we 247 utilized to identify rate shifts is calibrated to identify dramatic changes in the evolutionary rate 248 along a lineage. Accordingly, it cannot detect sites where a \"content shift\" occurred, i.e. the 249 amino acid changed and remained conserved in two complementary lineages, since this entails 250 only a minor change in evolutionary rate. This is partially demonstrated in Gag30, where the rate 251 of evolution changed mildly, while the content of this site changed between chimpanzee and 252 human viruses. 253\n\nImplications. The compiled list of the positions suggested as rate decelerating can now serve as 254 a guide for future functional studies that aim to understand the differences among HIV-1 and 255 SIV proteins. Furthermore, the ability to track adaptation events by utilizing sequence data 256 highlights the power of the method when studying emerging pandemics, strengthening the 257 need to sequence full genomes of pathogens broadly. 258\n\nharnessed to identify adaptation events of emerging pathogens to their new host species. Our 260 results suggest that innate immunity serves as a strong barrier for cross-species transmission 261 events, and that this barrier imposed a strong selective pressure for viruses to adapt as they 262 crossed these barriers with increasing efficiency. 263 .

In order to reconstruct of the phylogenetic 282 relationship between the sequences, we concatenated the alignments of Gag, Pol, Vif, Vpr, Tat  283 and Env and provided this as input for PhyML [60] . We next used the reconstructed phylogeny 284 as a guide tree to realign each protein with PRANK. JpHMM was used to validate that the strains 285 used in the analysis are not inter-group recombinants [61] . 286 .

It . https://doi. org/10.1101/190769 doi: bioRxiv preprint In order to identify evolutionary rate shifts, we used RASER [18] to analyze each of the nine 287 proteins separately, with the proteome-based phylogeny as input. RASER is a likelihood-based 288 phylogenetic method for detecting a change in site-specific evolutionary rates. First, a likelihood 289 ratio test against a null model of no rate shifts is performed in order to assess if a model 290 enabling rate shifts better fits the data. Next, the posterior probability of rate-shift is calculated 291 at each site and sites with a probability higher than 0.6 are considered here as significant. 292\n\nFinally, for each such site, the method lists the lineages where the rate shift occurred with the 293 highest probability, and further categorizes each sites as undergoing either a rate-deceleration 294 or a rate-acceleration. 295\n\nIn order to test for sequence sampling effects on the identified rate shift patterns, we repeated 296 the analysis with increased amount of group M sequences (n=183), reduced amount of group O 297 sequences (n=13) and no SIVgor sequences, denoted as dataset (i). Analysis revealed more rate 298 decelerations in the branch leading to group M than in dataset (ii) analysis (48 compared to 28, 299\n\nSupplementary File 1). 54% of the positions identified as rate-decelerating in group M in dataset 300 (ii) (n=15) were also identified in dataset (i). Chi-squared tests for differences in group M rate 301 shift distributions showed no significant difference (p=0.11 and 0.87 for rate decelerations and 302 accelerations, respectively), indicating that the patterns of rate shifts between the large group 303 M sample and the smaller group M sample are similar. 304 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
