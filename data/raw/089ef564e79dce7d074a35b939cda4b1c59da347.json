Experimental infections with PED virus isolates have indicated that the virus is a primary etiologic agent of diarrhea in pigs (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980; Debouck et al., 1981; Coussement et al., 1982) . The principal features of PED are watery diarrhea, dehydration and high mortality in suckling pigs.\n\nIn 1978, a coronavirus-like particle was \u00aerst identi\u00aeed during episodes of epizootic diarrhea in pigs in Belgium (Pensaert and Debouck, 1978) and the UK (Wood, 1977; Chasey and Cartwright, 1978) . PED has subsequently been reported in Canada (Turgeon et al., 1980) , Hungary (Horvath and Mocsari, 1981) , Germany (Pospischil et al., 1981) and Korea (Kweon et al., 1993) . In Japan, there was an outbreak of PED-like disease from late 1982 to early 1983 (Takahashi et al., 1983; Kuwahara et al., 1988) . Further outbreaks occurred between late 1993 and 1996 (Sueyoshi et al., 1995; Tsuda, 1997) . In an acute outbreak of PED in 1996, more than the 39,000 suckling pigs died (Tsuda, 1997) .\n\nAttempts at propagating PED virus in porcine cell or organ cultures have been unsuccessful. The \u00aerst adaptation of PED virus to Vero cell cultures using medium containing trypsin was reported in 1988 (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) . In Japan, PED virus was \u00aerst isolated in Vero cell culture in the same manner (Kusanagi et al., 1992) . This paper describes the isolation of PED virus not only in Vero cells but also in cultures derived from pig bladder and kidney cells by addition of trypsin to the medium. Furthermore, to determine the effect of pig age on disease, different age groups of pigs were inoculated with the Japanese isolate of PED virus.\n\nGrowth medium (GM) was Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth, 10% inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics was used for the propagation of cells. Maintenance medium (MM) consisted of Eagle's MEM with 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth, 0.02% yeast extract, and 10 mg/ml trypsin (Difco, USA), unless otherwise stated.\n\nEstablished cell lines of Vero cells derived from African green monkey kidney (RCV0001) and MA104 from fetal macacus rhesus monkey kidney were used. SB1 and SB2 cells prepared from the bladder epithelial cells of cesarean-derived colostrumdeprived (CDCD) piglets were used for virus isolation at approximately 20\u00b130 passages. SK cells prepared from the CDCD pig kidney were used at approximately 70\u00b180 passages.\n\nThe small intestines obtained from four piglets with naturally acquired infection showing severe diarrhea were homogenized with MM. PED virus antigens were detected in the enterocytes of these pigs by immunohistochemistry. The 10% pooled homogenates were centrifuged and the resulting supernatants were passed through a 450 nm membrane \u00aelter. Six 1-day old CDCD piglets were orally inoculated with 2 ml of the homogenized samples and sacri\u00aeced on post-inoculation days (PID) 1\u00b13. The small intestines collected from these infected pigs were treated as described above and the pooled homogenates were used as virus stock. The virus stock was stored at \u00c0808C until experimental inoculation of pigs. The virus stock was approximately 10 5.0 LD 50 /2 ml for a 3-day old pig. For virus isolation, three 7-day old CDCD piglets were inoculated with the virus stock and sacri\u00aeced on PID 1 (second passage in pig). Homogenized samples were prepared for virus isolation according to the method described previously (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988 ).\n\nAfter removal of GM, con\u00afuent cell cultures in collagen-coated 12-well tissue culture plates (Iwaki glass, Japan) were washed once with MEM. Then, the cells were inoculated with 0.2 ml per well of the clari\u00aeed homogenate. After adsorption at 378C for 1 h, the inoculum was removed and the monolayers were washed three times with 2 ml of MEM. The cell cultures were fed with 2 ml per well of MM. Control cultures were mock-inoculated with the same volume of MM instead of viral inoculum. If no cytopathic effect (CPE) was detected within 7 days, \u00aeve blind passages were performed using supernatant\u00afuids of cell culture in the same manner as the original samples.\n\nTwenty eight speci\u00aec pathogen-free (SPF) pigs in different age groups (six at 2 days old, two at 7 days old, \u00aeve each at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks old) were obtained from an SPF pig herd. Each group of pigs was housed separately in a containment room and fed a commercial milk or solid diet. The ambient room temperature was maintained at 29\u00b1308C for 2-and 7-day old pigs and 23\u00b1248C for the other pigs. Two-day old pigs were divided into uninoculated control or infection groups. Two-day old and all other pigs were orally inoculated with 2 ml of 100-and 2-fold diluted virus stock, respectively. Blood samples were collected weekly from each pig. Clinical signs were recorded twice a day until slaughter. Surviving pigs were euthanized and necropsied at post-inoculation week (PIW) 4 or 6.\n\nVero cell cultures on coverslips were \u00aexed in acetone for 10 min, about 24 h after virus inoculation. They were then stained with the experimentally inoculated pig serum at 378C for 50 min. After incubation, they were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times and stained with protein A conjugated with\u00afuorescein isothiocyanate (Zymed, USA) at 378C for 50 min. After washing, the cells were mounted with buffered glycerol and examined under a\u00afuorescence microscope.\n\nThe VN test was carried out by the microtiter method using Vero cells. Sera were heated at 568C for 30 min before use. Serial two-fold dilutions of serum were mixed with an equal volume of Z94P5 strain virus suspension containing 200 TCID 50 /0.1 ml. The mixture were incubated at 378C for 1 h and 0.1 ml of virus\u00b1serum mixture was inoculated into each of the two wells. Following adsorption at 378C for 1 h, the inocula were removed and the monolayers were washed three times with MEM. Then, 0.1 ml of MM containing 5 mg/ml trypsin was added to each well and the cultures were incubated at 378C for 7 days. The antibody titer was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution inhibiting CPE in at least one of the two wells.\n\nThe avidin\u00b1biotin (AB) technique was used for the detection of PED virus antigen in tissues. An ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, USA) was used to examine formalin-\u00aexed, paraf\u00aen wax-embedded sections of the gastrointestinal tract. Sections were counterstained with methyl green. Rabbit antiserum against PED virus (Tsuda, 1997) was used as primary antibody.\n\nHistopathological examination was performed according to routine procedures. In brief, tissue samples were \u00aexed in 20% neutral phosphate-buffered formalin. Thin sections of paraf\u00aen-embedded samples were stained by hematoxylin and eosin.\n\nAs shown in Table 1 , cytopathic agents were isolated in Vero, SK and SB1 cell cultures inoculated with second passage intestinal samples. At \u00aerst passage, CPE was inapparent Vero \u00c0 a SK \u00c0 \u00c0 SB1 \u00c0 SB2 \u00c0 \u00c0 \u00c0 MA104 \u00c0 \u00c0 \u00c0 because of the cytotoxic effect of the inoculum. On passage 2 in Vero cell culture, CPE characterized by cell fusion and syncytial formation was detected microscopically after an incubation period of 1\u00b12 days. CPE progressed more slowly in SK and SB1 cell cultures than in Vero cell culture. The number of cells which were rounded, detached and fused were increased after 3\u00b14 days of incubation (Fig. 1) . Although syncytial formation was not apparent under microscope in non-stained cultured cells, fused cells were obvious in SB1 cell culture samples stained with Wright Giemsa's solution (Fig. 1) . Vero cells inoculated with viruses isolated in SB1 or SK cells showed the same CPE with syncytial formation. By IFA, speci\u00aec brilliant\u00afuorescence were observed in the cytoplasm of these cells (Fig. 1 ) and the isolates were identi\u00aeed as PED virus. N\u014d uorescing cells were observed in uninoculated control cells. The isolated PED virus from pig No. 5 in Vero cell culture was clone-puri\u00aeed three times by plaque selection and designated Z94P5. CPE was not detected microscopically in SB2 and MA104 cells at the \u00aefth passage.\n\nAll 2-and 7-day old pigs inoculated with PED virus developed severe watery diarrhea from PID 1 and died between PID 3 and 4 (Table 2). PED virus antigen was detected by the AB technique in the small intestine of dead pigs. Vomiting was occasionally seen on PID 1\u00b13. Non-inoculated control 2-day old pigs kept under the same conditions remained healthy. Three of \u00aeve 2-week old pigs developed diarrhea on PID 1\u00b14 which lasted 2\u00b14 days. Although all these pigs were slightly depressed and anorectic after inoculation, they recovered after 1 week. PED virus antigen was detected by the AB technique in the jejunum and ileum of pig No. 9 which was euthanized on PID 5. In the 4-week old group, three of \u00aeve pigs had mild diarrhea which started on PID 3\u00b15 and continued for 1\u00b12 days. In this group, other clinical signs such as depression and anorexia were not observed. All of 8-and 12-week old pigs showed no clinical signs including diarrhea throughout the experiment. All the pigs in the 2-, 4-, 8-and 12-week old groups survived.\n\nBefore infection, all of the pigs were negative for antibody against PED virus by both VN test and IFA. The antibodies were \u00aerst detected on PIW 1 or 2 and they peaked between PIW 4 and 5 on VN test and on PIW 3 on IFA (Fig. 2) . IFA titers were higher than those of VN antibody. All of the non-inoculated control pigs were negative for both antibodies throughout the study.\n\nIn the present study, PED virus was successfully propagated not only in Vero cells but also in SB1 and SK cell cultures. Hofmann and Wyler (1988) \u00aerst isolated and adapted PED virus to serial propagation in Vero cells, which are derived from African green monkeys, by adding trypsin to the MM. However, attempts at isolating PED virus in porcine cell cultures in the presence or absence of trypsin have been unsuccessful until now. Previous reports suggested that porcine cell cultures were damaged by trypsin, which then might not be able to support virus replication (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) . In the present study, collagen-coated plates were used; cells cultured on collagen-coated plates are more resistant to trypsin (data not shown). This might be the main reason for the successful isolation of PED virus in porcine cell cultures in the present study. This method may be suitable for cell culture in medium containing trypsin or other proteinases. PED virus was isolated in SB1 cells but not in SB2 cells. Although PED virus propagated in SB1 cells showed CPE in SB2 cells, the titer in these cells was lower than in SB1 cells (data not shown); the cells had been derived from the bladder of different pigs and were used at the same passage numbers. The reason for the difference in susceptibility for viral propagation between these cells is not known. Upon experimental infection, 2-and 7-day old pigs inoculated with PED virus developed severe diarrhea and died. The 2-and 4-week old pigs showed mild diarrhea after inoculation and survived. The 8-and 12-week old pigs did not show any clinical signs, but developed antibody against PED virus. Coussement et al. (1982) described that 2-or 3-day old cesarian-derived piglets infected oronasally with the CV777 strain of PED virus showed severe diarrhea after an incubation period of 22\u00b136 h. Debouck and Pensaert (1980) reported that pigs between 1 and 20 days old experimentally inoculated with PED virus developed diarrhea and some pigs younger than 19 days old died. These results are similar to those of the present study.\n\nIn several outbreaks, PED has caused diarrhea in pigs of all ages (Pensaert and Debouck, 1978; Takahashi et al., 1983) . In the present study, however, severe diarrhea was only observed in 2-and 7-day old pigs. The difference in the clinical signs between \u00aeeld cases and the present examination may re\u00afect differences in the infectious dose, the susceptibility of pigs, the environmental conditions or the virulence of the strains. The majority of herd outbreaks of PED occur during the colder months, especially between January and April (Tsuda, 1997) . In TGE virus infection, (Shimizu et al., 1978; Shimizu and Shimizu, 1979) showed that a high ambient temperature resulted in increased disease resistance, while a low ambient temperature or temperature changes caused a dramatic enhancement in clinical signs. In the present study, 2\u00b112-week old pigs were kept at 23\u00b1 248C throughout the study. Consequently, a stable comfortable ambient temperature might induce resistance to clinical disease after PED virus infection."}
