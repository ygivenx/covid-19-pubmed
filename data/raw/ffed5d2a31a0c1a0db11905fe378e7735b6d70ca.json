We trimmed the poly-A adaptors from the reads using Cutadapt 2 (version 1.8. 3) , and utilized Bowtie 3 (version 1.1.1) to map them to the E. coli-lambda transcriptome. In the first phase, we discarded reads that mapped to rRNA and tRNA sequences with Bowtie parameters '-n 2 -seedlen 23 -k 1 --norc'. In the second phase, we mapped the remaining reads to the transcriptome with Bowtie parameters '-v 2 -a --strata --best -norc -m 200'. We attempted to extend alignments to their maximal length by comparing the polyA adaptor with the aligned transcript until reaching the maximal allowed error (2 mismatches across the read, with 3'-end mismatches avoided). We filtered out reads longer than 31-nt and shorter than 21-nt. Unique alignments were first assigned to the ribosome occupancy profiles. For multiple alignments, the best alignments in terms of number of mismatches were kept. Then, multiple aligned reads were distributed between locations according to the distribution of unique ribosomal reads in the respective surrounding regions. To this end, a 100-nt window was used to compute the read count density (total read counts in the window divided by length, based on unique reads) in vicinity of the M multiple aligned positions in the transcriptome, and the fraction of a read assigned to each position was . The location of the A-site was approximated by an 11nt shift from the 5' end of the aligned read. This shift maximized the correlation between MTDR (described below) and the observed read densities per E. coli gene.\n\nRibosome profiling data normalization. We began the analysis by reconstructing ribosome profiles for E. "}
