{"title": "Mechanisms of Host Receptor Adaptation by Severe Acute Respiratory\nSyndrome Coronavirus*", "body": "Many viruses, particularly RNA viruses, can rapidly adapt to changes in their hosts\ndue to the high mutation rates of these viruses. Such viral adaptation to hosts\nimposes huge threats to human health because it allows viruses to emerge from\nanimals to infect humans. Understanding viral adaptation to hosts would allow humans\nto track viral evolution that may lead to viral epidemics, but current knowledge of\nthe mechanisms of viral adaptation to hosts is limited. This study investigates the\nmechanisms of host receptor adaptation by the severe acute respiratory syndrome\ncoronavirus (SARS-CoV),3 the agent\nof the SARS epidemic, and provides a molecular and structural basis for monitoring\nfuture SARS-CoV evolution in animals.\n\nSARS broke out as a worldwide epidemic in 2002\u20132003, causing >8000\nhuman infections with a 10% fatality rate (1\u20134). SARS briefly\nrecurred in 2003\u20132004, causing sporadic human infections with mild symptoms\nand no human-to-human transmission (5\u20137). Since the SARS\nepidemic, various SARS-CoV strains have been isolated from humans and palm civets\n(see Fig. 1A). The prototypic\nhuman strain, hTor02, was isolated during the 2002\u20132003 SARS epidemic (8). A strain common to humans and civets,\nhcGd03, was isolated during the 2003\u20132004 sporadic SARS infections (6, 7).\nStrain cSz02 was isolated from civets in animal markets in southern China during the\nSARS outbreak (5). Strain cHb05 was isolated\nfrom wild civets in central China several years after the SARS outbreak (9). In addition, human strain hHae08 was\nisolated after adaptation of SARS-CoV to human airway epithelial cells in\nvitro (10). Because of the\nextremely high genetic similarity (\u223c99%) between human and civet SARS-CoV,\nit is believed that civets played a direct role in transmitting SARS-CoV to humans\nand were responsible for both of the human SARS infections (5, 11, 12). Although SARS-like coronaviruses (SLCVs)\nhave been isolated from bats, the genetic difference between SLCVs and human or\ncivet SARS-CoV is much greater than that between human and civet SARS-CoV (13, 14).\nMoreover, SLCVs cannot infect human or civet cells, and SARS-CoV cannot infect bats\n(15). Because of the direct role of\ncivets in the past SARS epidemic, this study focused on SARS-CoV strains isolated\nfrom humans and civets.\n\nReceptor recognition is the first step in viral infection of host cells and one of\nthe most important determinants of viral infectivity and pathogenesis. Although many\nother host and viral factors can also affect the efficiency of infection and\nreplication of a virus in a specific host, these factors come into play only after a\nvirus has bound to a receptor on the cell membrane. A trimeric spike protein on the\nSARS-CoV envelope mediates viral entry into host cells. It first binds to its host\nreceptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (16), and subsequently fuses host and viral membranes (17\u201319). A defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the SARS-CoV spike\nprotein is sufficient for high-affinity binding to ACE2 (20\u201322). The\nRBD/ACE2 binding affinity has been established as a key element of SARS-CoV\npathogenesis and cross-species infections (10, 11, 23\u201325). The\ncrystal structure of hTor02 RBD complexed with human ACE2 (hACE2) showed that the\nRBD contains two subdomains, a core structure and a receptor-binding motif (RBM)\nthat directly binds ACE2 (see Fig.\n1B) (26). Using\nhTor02 RBD as a reference, numerous naturally selected mutations have been\nidentified in the RBDs of different SARS-CoV strains isolated from humans or civets.\nThe majority of these mutations fall in the RBM region (see Fig. 1, A and B). To date,\nresearch has focused on two of these mutations, N479K and T487S (7, 11,\n24, 27, 28). Biochemical studies\nshowed that both mutations N479K and T487S significantly decrease the RBD/hACE2\nbinding affinity (24, 28). Structural studies revealed that mutation N479K introduces\nan energetically unfavorable positive charge at the RBD/hACE2 interface, whereas\nmutation T487S removes an energetically favorable hydrophobic interaction with hACE2\nLys-353 (see Fig. 1C) (26, 27).\nThe molecular and structural mechanisms of all of the other RBM mutations are poorly\nunderstood. It is not known why any of these RBM mutations were naturally selected\nor which RBM mutations were viral adaptations to which host.\n\nHere, we investigated the role of each of the RBM mutations in viral interactions\nwith hACE2 and civet ACE2 (cACE2) using a combination of biochemical, functional and\ncrystallographic methods. Our results show that all of the above RBM mutations were\nviral adaptations to two \u201cvirus-binding hot spots\u201d on ACE2 and\nsuggest that these mutations were naturally selected because they enhance viral\ninteractions with either hACE2 or cACE2. These detailed mechanisms allow us to\nunderstand the events that led to the past SARS epidemic and to monitor the events\nthat may lead to future SARS epidemics.\n\nSARS-CoV RBDs (from different viral strains) and ACE2 peptidase domains\n(human, civet, or chimeric) were expressed and purified as described\npreviously (26, 27). In brief, the proteins\ncontaining an N-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide and a\nC-terminal His tag were expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the\nBac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). The proteins were harvested from Sf9\ncell supernatants and purified sequentially on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic\nacid column and a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). To\npurify the RBD-ACE2 complex, ACE2 was incubated with excess RBD, and\nthen the complex was purified by gel filtration chromatography. RBD-ACE2\ncrystals were grown in sitting drops at room temperature over wells\ncontaining 100 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 20\u201324% PEG 6000, and\n100 mm NaCl. Crystals were soaked briefly in 100 mm\nTris (pH 8.5), 30% PEG 6000, 100 mm NaCl, and 30% ethylene\nglycol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction\ndata were collected at Argonne Photon Source beamlines 19-ID and 24-ID\nand Advanced Light Source beamline 4.2.2. Each structure was determined\nby molecular replacement using the structure of hACE2 complexed with\nhTor02 RBD as the search model (Protein Data Bank code 2AJF). Data and\nrefinement statistics are shown in Table\n1. The software used for data processing and structure\nrefinement is also listed in Table\n1.\n\nSurface plasmon resonance assays using a Biacore 2000 system were carried\nout as described previously (29,\n30). In brief, to measure the\nbinding affinities between mutant viral RBDs and wild-type ACE2, ACE2\nwas immobilized on a C5 sensor chip through direct covalent coupling via\namine groups, and soluble RBDs were introduced at a flow rate of 20\n\u03bcl/min at different concentrations (62.5, 125, and 250\nnm). To measure the binding affinities between mutant ACE2\nand wild-type viral RBDs, RBDs were immobilized on the sensor chip, and\nACE2 was flowed through.\n\nInfection was assayed using murine leukemia viruses expressing\n\u03b2-galactosidase and pseudotyped with SARS-CoV spike protein as\ndescribed previously (29). In\nbrief, to prepare pseudotyped viruses, HEK293T cells were cotransfected\nwith spike protein-encoding pcDNA3.1, p3240 expressing murine leukemia\nvirus gag and pol genes, and a murine\nleukemia virus \u03b2-galactosidase-transducing vector (pBAG) (31). Viral supernatants were\nharvested and inoculated on HEK293T cells expressing ACE2 in pcDNA3.1.\nInfection efficiency was quantified by measuring \u03b2-galactosidase\nactivity. The spike proteins and ACE2 contained a C-terminal C9 tag and\nHA tag, respectively. Hence, the concentrations of the spike protein\npackaged in pseudotyped viruses and of ACE2 expressed on the HEK293T\ncell surface were detected by Western blotting using anti-C9 and anti-HA\nantibodies, respectively, and quantified using ImageJ software (version\n1.6) (supplemental Fig. S1). Compared with the infection\nexperiments using fluorescence assays (32), the \u03b2-galactosidase assays used in this study\nare not as sensitive but are more stable and repeatable.\n\nAll of the RBM mutations cluster around two virus-binding hot spots on\nhACE2, hot spot-31 and hot spot-353, which center on Lys-31 and Lys-353,\nrespectively (Fig.\n1C). Hot spot-353 is recognized by both\nSARS-CoV and human NL63 coronavirus, despite the markedly different\nstructures of their RBDs (29,\n30). Hot spot-31 is\nrecognized by SARS-CoV only but not by NL63 coronavirus. The two hot\nspots have both structural similarities and dissimilarities. In unbound\nhACE2, both Lys-31 and Lys-353 point away from the protein and into\nsolution (33). Upon SARS-CoV\nbinding, both residues fold back, become buried in hydrophobic\nenvironments, and form salt bridges with hACE2 Glu-35 and Asp-38,\nrespectively (26, 27). Because of the hydrophobic\nenvironments, formation of the salt bridges provides significant amounts\nof energy to the virus/receptor interactions. The difference between the\ntwo hot spots is that, upon salt bridge formation, Lys-353 is in a\nrelatively extended conformation that is energetically favorable,\nwhereas Lys-31 is in a strained conformation that is energetically\nunfavorable. In this study, we examined the structure and function of\nhot spot-31 by mutagenesis using surface plasmon resonance Biacore\nassays and pseudotyped viral infection assays (Fig. 2, A and B).\nBoth assays showed that mutation K31A did not have a significant impact\non RBD/hACE2 binding (p > 0.10\n(t test) for both Ka\nand infection). In contrast, mutation K353A significantly decreased\nRBD/hACE2 binding affinity (p < 0.01 for both\nKa and infection). These results\nsuggest that there was a significant net energy gain from salt bridge\nformation at hot spot-353. In contrast, there was no significant net\nenergy gain from salt bridge formation at hot spot-31, as the energy\ngain from salt bridge formation was cancelled out by loss from the\nstrained conformation of Lys-31.\n\nTo further understand the structure and function of hot spot-31, we\ninvestigated mutation K31T in hACE2 based on the observation that cACE2,\ncontaining Thr-31, is an efficient receptor for hTor02 (Fig. 2C). Both\nBiacore and pseudotyped viral infection assays showed that mutation K31T\nsignificantly increased RBD/hACE2 binding affinity (p\n< 0.001 for both Ka and infection)\n(Fig. 2, A and\nB). To investigate the structural basis for\nmutation K31T, we determined the crystal structure of a human-civet\nchimeric ACE2 complexed with hTor02 RBD (Table 1). The chimeric ACE2 contained SARS-CoV-binding\nresidues from cACE2 (Fig.\n2C) and other residues from hACE2. We\npreviously established this chimeric ACE2 as a useful alternative to\ncACE2 in crystallographic analysis of SARS-CoV/cACE2 interactions by\nshowing that the chimeric ACE2 had the same receptor activities as cACE2\nbut the same crystallographic activities as hACE2 (27). The structure of the hTor02 RBD-chimeric ACE2\ncomplex showed that a hydrogen bond between chimeric ACE2 Thr-31 and RBD\nTyr-442 strengthens a hydrophobic network around hot spot-31 at the\nvirus/receptor interface (Fig.\n2D). Therefore, despite its insignificant\nnet energy contribution, hot spot-31 plays an important role in RBD/ACE2\ninteractions. Consequently, upon introduction to a new species, SARS-CoV\nRBD may need to adapt to both hot spot-31 and hot spot-353 on ACE2.\n\nTo investigate the molecular mechanisms of the RBM mutations, we\nintroduced seven single mutations to hTor02 RBD, Y442F, L472P, L472F,\nN479K, N479R, D480G, and T487S, corresponding to all of the RBM\nmutations identified in human and civet SARS-CoV strains (Fig. 1A). We\nexpressed and purified each of these mutant RBDs and measured their\nbinding affinities for hACE2 and cACE2 using Biacore assays (Fig. 3, A and\nB). The results showed that hTor02 RBD bound to\nhACE2 and cACE2 with similar Ka values\n(p > 0.50). The affinity of hTor02 RBD for\nhACE2 was increased by Y442F and L472F (p <\n0.01); unchanged by N479R (p > 0.10); and\ndecreased by L472P, D480G, N479K, and T487S (p\n< 0.02) (Fig.\n3A). The affinity of hTor02 RBD for cACE2\nwas increased by N479R and D480G (p < 0.01);\nunchanged by L472P and N479K (p > 0.50); and\ndecreased by L472F, Y442F, and T487S (p < 0.01)\n(Fig. 3B). In\nsum, among the RBM residues that have been identified in different\nSARS-CoV strains, Phe-442, Phe-472, Asn-479/Arg-479, Asp-480, and\nThr-487 enhanced RBD/hACE2 interactions, whereas Tyr-442,\nPro-472/Leu-472, Arg-479, Gly-480 and Thr-487 enhanced RBD/cACE2\ninteractions.\n\nThe above results suggest that combinations of the RBM residues that\nenhance RBD/hACE2 or RBD/cACE2 interactions can potentially produce new\nRBDs with exceptionally high affinity for hACE2 or cACE2, respectively.\nTo test this hypothesis, we designed and constructed two such new RBDs:\nhOptimize RBD containing Phe-442, Phe-472, Asn-479, Asp-480, and Thr-487\nand cOptimize RBD containing Tyr-442, Pro-472, Arg-479, Gly-480, and\nThr-487 (Fig. 1A).\nWe expressed and purified each of the RBDs. Biacore assays confirmed\nthat compared with hTor02 RBD, hOptimize and cOptimize RBDs had higher\naffinities for hACE2 and cACE2, respectively (p\n< 0.01) (Fig. 3,\nA and B). On the other hand,\nwhereas hOptimize RBD had low affinity for cACE2, cOptimize RBD had\nsubstantial affinity for hACE2.\n\nTo investigate the structural mechanisms of the RBM mutations, we\ndetermined the following three crystal structures: hOptimize RBD\ncomplexed with hACE2, cOptimize RBD complexed with the chimeric ACE2,\nand hOptimize RBD complexed with the chimeric ACE2 (Fig. 4 and Table\n1). Together, these structures show that naturally selected\nRBM mutations either strengthened favorable interactions or reduced\nunfavorable interactions with the two virus-binding hot spots on ACE2.\nThe structural details of each of the RBM mutations are as follow.\n\nRBD residue 442 interacts with hot spot-31 on ACE2. At the RBD/hACE2\ninterfaces, the hydroxyl group of Tyr-442 has partial steric clash with\nthe alkyl side chain of hACE2 Lys-31 (Fig.\n1C). Mutation Y442F removes this hydroxyl\ngroup, partially releases the structural strain of Lys-31 (Fig. 4A), and\nincreases the RBD/hACE2 binding affinity. As discussed above, at the\nRBD/chimeric ACE2 interfaces, the hydroxyl group of Tyr-442 forms a\ncritical hydrogen bond with chimeric ACE2 Thr-31 (Figs. 2D and 4B). Mutation Y442F removes this\nhydrogen bond, weakens the hydrophobic network around hot spot-31, and\ndecreases the RBD/cACE2 binding affinity. Therefore, Phe-442 and Tyr-442\nwere viral adaptations to hACE2 and cACE2, respectively (Fig. 5).\n\nRBD residue 472 interacts with hot spot-31 on ACE2. At the RBD/hACE2\ninterfaces, Leu-472 forms favorable hydrophobic interactions with hACE2\nMet-82 and Leu-79 and strengthens the hydrophobic network around hot\nspot-31 (Fig. 1C).\nMutation L472F further strengthens but mutation L472P weakens RBD/hACE2\ninteractions (Fig. 4,\nA and C). At the RBD/chimeric ACE2\ninterfaces, Phe-472 would have partial steric clash with the hydroxyl\ngroup of chimeric ACE2 Thr-82 (Figs.\n2D and 4B), and hence, mutation L472F decreases\nthe RBD/cACE2 binding affinity. Additionally, neither Leu-472 nor\nPro-472 has significant contact with Thr-82 (Figs. 2D and 4B), and hence, mutation L472P has\nno significant effects on the RBD/cACE2 interactions. Therefore, Phe-472\nand Pro-472/Leu-472 were viral adaptations to hACE2 and cACE2,\nrespectively (Fig. 5).\n\nRBD residue 479 interacts with both hot spots on ACE2. As shown\npreviously, at the RBD/hACE2 interfaces, mutation N479K introduces a\npositive charge that can compete with hACE2 Lys-31 for hACE2 Glu-35 as a\nsalt bridge partner (26, 27), and hence, it decreases the\nRBD/hACE2 binding affinity. Unexpectedly, unlike N479K, mutation N479R\nhas no significant effects on the RBD/hACE2 binding affinity even though\nit does introduce a positive charge. This is because Arg-479 and hACE2\nLys-353 can both form a salt bridge with hACE2 Asp-38 (Fig. 4C). At the\nRBD/chimeric ACE2 interfaces, Thr-31 cannot form a salt bridge with\nchimeric ACE2 Glu-35 (Figs.\n2D and 4B), and hence, Glu-35 is available to form\na salt bridge with Lys-479. On the other hand, Lys-479 has high\nconformational entropy and stacks poorly with the hydrophobic network\naround hot spot-31 (27).\nConsequently, mutation N479K has no significant effects on the RBD/cACE2\nbinding affinity. In contrast, Arg-479 can form a strong bifurcated salt\nbridge with Glu-35 and is also a much better hydrophobic stacker than\nLys-479 (Fig. 4B).\nThus, mutation N479R increases the RBD/cACE2 binding affinity.\nTherefore, Asn-479/Arg-479 and Arg-479 were viral adaptations to hACE2\nand cACE2, respectively (Fig.\n5).\n\nRBD residue 480 interacts with hot spot-353 on ACE2. At the RBD/hACE2\ninterfaces, RBD Tyr-436 forms a hydrogen bond with hACE2 Asp-38 and\nstrengthens the Lys-353\u2013Asp-38 salt bridge (Figs. 1C and 4D). The alkyl side chain of\nAsp-480 forms a hydrophobic interaction with Tyr-436 and supports the\nTyr-436\u2013Asp-38 hydrogen bond. Consequently, mutation D480G\nweakens the above interactions and decreases the RBD/hACE2 binding\naffinity. At the RBD/chimeric ACE2 interfaces, chimeric ACE2 Glu-38,\nwhich has a longer side chain than hACE2 Asp-38, moves back to keep the\nsalt bridge with Lys-353. Accordingly, Tyr-436 also needs to move to\nkeep the hydrogen bond with Glu-38 (Fig.\n4D). Mutation D480G facilitates the movement\nof Tyr-436 and increases the RBD/cACE2 binding affinity. Therefore,\nAsp-480 and Gly-480 were viral adaptations to hACE2 and cACE2,\nrespectively (Fig. 5).\n\nRBD residue 487 interacts with hot spot-353 on hACE2. As shown\npreviously, at the RBD/hACE2 interfaces, the methyl group of Thr-487\nsupports the Lys-353\u2013Asp-38 salt bridge (Fig. 1C) (26, 27), and\nhence, mutation T487S decreases the RBD/hACE2 binding affinity. At the\nRBD/chimeric ACE2 interfaces, the methyl group of Thr-487 also supports\nthe Lys-353\u2013Glu-38 salt bridge (Fig. 4B), and thus, mutation T487S\ndecreases the RBD/cACE2 binding affinity. Therefore, Thr-487 was a viral\nadaptation to both hACE2 and cACE2 (Fig.\n5).\n\nTo further investigate the interactions between different RBDs and ACE2\nfrom humans or civets, we measured the spike protein-mediated infection\nof hACE2- or cACE2-expressing cells using pseudotyped viral infection\nassays (Fig. 3, C\nand D). Compared with Biacore assays that directly\nmeasure binding interactions between monomeric RBD and monomeric ACE2 in\nsolution, pseudotyped infection assays measure binding interactions\nbetween trimeric spike proteins on viral surfaces and monomeric ACE2 on\ntarget cell surfaces. In addition, pseudotyped infection assays require\nnot only receptor binding but also membrane fusion and post-fusion steps\nfor reporter gene expression. Hence, pseudotyped infection assays\nreflect more truthfully than Biacore assays on how the RBM mutations may\nimpact SARS-CoV infectivity and pathogenesis.\n\nThe spike proteins used in the assays share the same sequences as the\nhTor02 spike protein except that their RBDs contain different\ncombinations of RBM residues (Fig.\n1A). hOptimize spike protein mediated a\nhigher level of infection of hACE2-expressing cells than all other spike\nproteins (p < 0.01) because its residues at\npositions 442, 472, 479, 480, and 487 were all best adapted to hACE2\n(Fig. 3C).\nParticularly, hOptimize spike protein-pseudotyped viruses infected\nhACE2-expressing cells about twice as efficiently as hTor02 spike\nprotein-pseudotyped viruses and \u223c4-fold as efficiently as cSz02\nspike protein-pseudotyped viruses. Additionally, hOptimize spike protein\nmediated a lower level of infection of cACE2-expressing cells than all\nother spike proteins except hHae08 (p < 0.01)\nbecause its residues at four of the above positions, except position\n487, were poorly adapted to cACE2. On the other hand, cOptimize spike\nprotein mediated a higher level of infection of cACE2-expressing cells\nthan all other spike proteins (p < 0.01)\nbecause its residues at the above five positions were all best adapted\nto cACE2 (Fig.\n3D). Particularly, cOptimize spike\nprotein-pseudotyped viruses infected cACE2-expressing cells about twice\nas efficiently as hTor02 spike protein-pseudotyped viruses and\n\u223c7-fold as efficiently as hHae08 spike protein-pseudotyped\nviruses. cOptimize spike protein also mediated a substantial level of\ninfection of hACE2-expressing cells, lower than hTor02 but significantly\nhigher than hcGd03 (p < 0.01), because its\nresidues at positions 479 and 487 were well adapted to hACE2, whereas\nits residues at the other three positions were poorly adapted to hACE2.\nOverall, the results from the pseudotyped infection assays correlate\nwell with those from Biacore data and structural analysis.\n\nSARS-CoV evolution in animals needs to be carefully monitored as a\npreventive measure for potential future SARS epidemics. SARS-CoV was\nfound in wild civets in 2005 (9)\nand can potentially cross the species barrier to infect humans again, as\nit did as least twice before. Novel coronaviruses have been identified\nin bats (13, 14), and some of these bat\ncoronaviruses may be transmitted to humans either directly or through\nsome intermediate animal hosts (11). SARS-CoV may also be misused as a bioweapon to infect\nhumans. Regardless of the circumstances under which SARS-CoV re-emerges,\nunderstanding the mechanisms of its host receptor adaptation will be\ncrucial for dealing with its re-emergence.\n\nIn this study, we have identified RBM residues that are best adapted to\nhACE2 or cACE2, and hence, these residues can be predictors of future\nSARS-CoV evolution in animals. The elucidated receptor recognition\nmechanisms by SARS-CoV can allow us to evaluate the potential epidemical\nconsequences of a future SARS-CoV strain simply by examining its genomic\nsequence. For example, if a future SARS-CoV strain is isolated from\ncivets or humans, we will be able to evaluate the binding affinity\nbetween its RBD and cACE2 or hACE2 based on its RBM sequences. More\nspecifically, if a future SARS-CoV strain contains a majority or all of\nthe cACE2-adapted RBM residues, it can potentially have high infectivity\nfor civet cells; if it contains a majority or all of the hACE2-adapted\nRBM residues, it can potentially have high infectivity for human cells.\nMoreover, the detailed interactions between SARS-CoV RBD and the two\nvirus-binding hot spots on ACE2 as elucidated in this study will help us\nunderstand and evaluate new RBM mutations in future SARS-CoV strains\nthat are different from the previously identified RBM mutations. The\nresults from this study can also contribute to the monitoring and\ncontrol of SLCVs in bats by providing insights into how these bat\nviruses may interact with the ACE2 molecules from bats, civets, humans,\nor other animals (27, 34). It should be noted that our\nstudy did not include replication-competent viruses or animal models,\nand thus, future studies will be required to establish the correlation\nbetween optimized RBDs and infectivities of live SARS-CoV strains. To\nconclude, given that SARS-CoV may still be evolving in civets and that\nSLCVs are harbored by bats, it remains possible for SARS-CoV to\nre-emerge into the human population through civets or other animals, but\nwe can be better prepared to prevent or handle future outbreaks of the\nvirus with improved understanding of the mechanisms for its host\nreceptor adaptation."}
