{"title": "", "body": "Let R overall denote the number of new infections caused by each case, averaged over all cases. Let \u00b5 be the average size of transmission chain (i.e. all cases that are linked to an index case). Then on average, \u00b5 cases cause \u00b5 \u2212 1 infections (because the index case is caused by any case in the chain). Therefore [Harris, 2002 , Lange, 2010 ,\n\nMeanwhile the index case is expected to generate R i cases in the first generation of secondary cases. These cases are expected to generate R i \u00b7 R s cases in the second generation. These in turn produce R i \u00b7 R 2 s cases in the third generation and so forth. Therefore,\n\nEquating the two formulas for \u00b5 and rearranging gives,\n\nportion of asymptomatic index cases that are unobserved Here we consider adjustments to the observed value of R i and R overall for the possibility that asymptomatic, unobserved index cases were not incorporated into the initial data analysis. We assume that the proportion of symptomatic, observed index cases is \u03c1 i,c and that the proportion of unobserved index cases is 1 \u2212 \u03c1 i,c . Let R o i and R o overall and \u00b5 o represent the values of R i ,R s and the average chain size based solely on observed data. Let R a i and R a overall and \u00b5 a represents the corresponding values, once adjusted for unobserved asymptomatic index cases.\n\nRecognizing that R a i has a contribution from both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases,\n\nLikewise, given that asymptomatic index cases result in a transmission chain of size one,\n\nCoupling this to equation 1,"}
