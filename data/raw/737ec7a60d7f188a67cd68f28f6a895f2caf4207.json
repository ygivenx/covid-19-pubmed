{"title": "", "body": "field, but Little also realized the need for inbred strains Of mice to study the genetics of cancer. In 1919 L.C. Strong joined Little at Cold Spring Harbor and together they developed the progenitors of most of the current strains, such as A, CBH, C3H, C56BL/6, C58 and BALB/c (1) . In 1929 Little established the Roscoe B. Jackson Laboratory at Bar Harbor, which acted as a major distributor of inbred mice. The work on mouse genetics goes on apace. Examination of enzyme polymorphisms among different inbred strains allowed the exploration of large, previously inaccessible portions of the mouse genome, and an impressive number of loci of a great variety of characters has now been defined and located on individual chromosomes.\n\nGeorge Snell, who joined the Jackson Laboratory in 1935, revived Little f s early work on susceptibility and resistance to tumor transplantation and developed a large number of congenie strains of mice, many of which are still in use today.\n\nHis analyses established the concept of a major histocompatibility complex.\n\nStarting in 1918, Topley made use of mice in his pioneering experiments on experimental epidemiology, first with mouse typhoid and then in 1929 with the newlydiscovered ectromelia virus (2) . However, until about 1930 mice were rarely used as experimental animals in virology, reliance being placed mainly on experiments in monkeys and rabbits.\n\nIn a rather superficial survey of the literature, the first reference I could find to the use of mice related to the infection of mice with rabies virus. Following observations made in 1904 that mice which survived being bitten by a rabid dog or cat subsequently contracted rabies, Remlinger (3) showed that mice could be infected orally with one but not with another strain of rabies virus.\n\nIn about 1920 it had been noted that mice were susceptible to herpes simplex and vaccinia viruses inoculated by the intracerebral and other routes. Shortly after that, in 1926, Dr. Clara Lynch brought ten albino mice from Lausanne, Switzerland, to the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research in New York in a shoe box. These animals were the progenitors of all the major outbred and inbred \"Swiss\" mice used in USA (1) . In relation to virological research, the turning point in the use of mice came in 1930, when Theiler (4) showed that Lynch*s Swiss mice were susceptible to yellow fever virus after intracerebral inoculation, and that relatively accurate titrations could be made by the inoculation of serial dilutions of virus into adequate numbers of mice.\n\nThe next year his colleagues Sawyer & Lloyd (5) developed the intraperitoneal protection test in adult mice, which involved the intraperitoneal inoculation\n\nof virus-serum mixtures and the simultaneous intracerebral inoculation of sterile starch. This test was widely used in yellow fever serological surveys, until in 1943 Whitman (6) showed that the starch inoculation could be omitted if weanling mice were used.\n\nAs a by-product of the yellow fever work, several previously unknown viruses had been isolated. In 1950 the Rockefeller Foundation, under whose auspices Theiler and his colleagues had been working, decided to mount a major program aimed at increasing knowledge about arthropod-borne viruses and their involvement in human disease. The worldwide program that followed was based on the intracerebral inoculation of mice, and later on the use of newborn mice, as indicators of arbovirus infections. In spite of the more recent addition of vertebrate and insect tissue cultures to the armamentarium, many arbovirologists still regard the infant mouse as indispensable for the discovery of new arboviruses.\n\nIn the process of trying to classify, by serological tests, the large number of new viruses that had been discovered during the yellow fever program and subsequently, the Rockefeller Foundation workers found that some of them did not multiply in mosquitoes, and unlike most arboviruses, were resistant to lipid solvents like ether of sodium deoxycholate.\n\nThese isolates turned out to be related to encephalomyelitis virus, which Theiler (7) had discovered some years earlier and had recognized was a disease of the mice themselves. This was not the first time that the risks of picking up a mouse virus during passage of material from human, mosquito or other sources had been recognized. In their studies of Q fever in 1937, which led to the discovery of the rickettsia that was subsequently named Coxiella burneti, Burnet & Freeman (8) had noted: \"In all work on virus diseases in which the infection is transferred from animal to animal by inoculation of crude tissue emulsions, the possibility of the contamination or replacement of the virus by some infective agent latent in the laboratory animals must be constantly borne in mind.\"\n\nWhile this work was going on, Andrewes et al. (9) showed that the mouse was susceptible to influenza virus by intranasal inoculation.\n\nThis initiated another large field of study, which is still being exploited by those interested in the role of cell-mediated and mucosal immunity to influenza.\n\nThen in 1948 Dalldorf & Sickles (10) made the completely unexpected discovery that the feces of two children suffering from mild \"poliomyelitis\" in the little town of Coxsackie, New York, contained a virus that was pathogenic 22 Frank Fenner when inoculated in suckling mice, but not in older animals. This led to the discovery of dozens of similar viruses, now called the coxsackieviruses, from human throat secretions and feces.\n\nUntil the early 1950 f s most laboratory studies in immunology were concerned with the production of antibodies and had made use of rabbits for the production of antisera, although using guinea pigs Chase (11) had demonstrated that cutaneous sensitivity to tuberculin could be transferred by lymphoid cells, but not by serum. In 1951 Medawar and his colleagues, who had been studying skin graft rejection in rabbits, turned their attention to mice (12) and made their classic discovery that the rejection of homografts could be abrogated by the prior injection of cells from the donor strain into suckling mice of the recipient inbred strain. Then Miller (13) by thymectomy of neonatal mice, demonstrated the immunological function of the thymus, and the mouse, with the wealth of inbred and congenie strains developed earlier by the mouse geneticists, became the center of interest for experimental immunologists, and remains so today.\n\nIn parallel but on a smaller scale to its use in \"pure\" immunology, the mouse has continued to be extensively used for studies on the pathogenesis of viral diseases, including the role of the immune response in recovery and protection against reinfection, utilizing both indigenous mouse viruses, like ectromelia, mouse salivary gland virus, Theiler's disease virus and of course the mouse leukemia and sarcoma viruses, and also human viruses that multiply in mice, like herpes simplex and influenza viruses.\n\nRats had a different path to the laboratory. Captured and bred for the sport of rat-baiting early in the nineteenth century, with albinos being especially prized animals, they were used for a few nutritional and anatomical experiments during the mid-nineteenth century. Their history as a laboratory animal, however, really begins with the work of H.H. Donaldson at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia in 1906 (14) .\n\nHe reasoned that the rat should be especially useful for nutritional and neuroanatomical studies because like man, it was omnivorous, and he had found that the nervous system \"grows in the same manner as that of manonly some 30 times as fast.\" Over the next twenty years Donaldson assembled a group of colleagues and undertook a 5. Keynote Address 23 multidisciplinary research program that provided a mass of reference data on the rat. In 1909 one of his colleagues, Helen Dean King, produced the first inbred strain of rats. Subsequent use of rats in the laboratory has covered many fields of biom\u00e9dical research, but especially nutrition and nutritional biochemistry, endocrinology and reproductive physiology, behavioral sciences, cancer research and genetics.\n\nThe rat has hardly figured at all in microbiological or virological research or in the investigation of infectious diseases.\n\nGuinea pigs were domesticated by the Andean Indians in pre-Columban times. On the west coast of South America the conquering Spaniards reported that the Indians kept great numbers of \"cav\u00edes\" in their houses, using them as a source of food.\n\nThey were first brought to Europe in about 1580, where they were bred for show and fancy for some 300 years before they were used for biological research.\n\nThe name \"guinea pig\", for which there seems to be no logical justification, has become almost synonymous with \"experimental animal\", although mice and rats are used in far greater number for these purposes. Guinea pigs have been exploited for biom\u00e9dical research because of special properties in which they differ from other experimental animals.\n\nFor example, they need ascorbic acid in their diet, and were used for the biological assay of vitamin C before chemical assays were developed.\n\nThey are highly susceptible to both human and bovine type tubercle bacilli and have long filled an important place in tuberculosis research and diagnosis. Guinea pigs are also susceptible to rickettsial infections, and a number of rickettsiae pathogenic for man were first studied in the guinea pig. They are also peculiarly sensitive to allergic reactions of various kinds and have long been the animal of choice in studies of general and cutaneous anaphylaxis. The anatomy of the guinea pig ear and associated structure makes it ideal for otologic studies, and it is widely used in auditory research (15) . Finally, the use of guinea pig by Sewall Wright (16) as the material for his classical genetic studies has assured them of a place in genetical research. Each has had a very different laboratory history from the other rodents. Chinese hamsters were originally used as wild caught animals, for the first time about 1919, and present laboratory colonies are probably derived from several different wild animal sources imported into Europe and USA at different times. The Chinese hamster has been used particularly for cytogenetic work, because of its low chromosome number, and some strains have a high incidence of diabetes mellitus, so that it is used as a model for the human disease.\n\nGolden hamsters were not domesticated until 1930, when Professor I. Aharoni of the Zoology Department of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem captured a litter of eight animals in Syria and brought them to his laboratory. Four escaped and one was killed by a litter-mate, but the single male and two female survivors had produced a colony of 364 animals by the end of the first year. The eminent protozoologist, Dr. Saul Adler, found that they were useful for investigations on kala-azar, and he decided to distribute them as widely as possible, sending specimens to the College de France, to the Wellcome Bureau of Scientific Research in London, and to India, Egypt and the USA. As Adler (17) later said \"To the best of my knowledge all the golden hamsters now in use as laboratory animals in Europe and America originate from the abovementioned three litter-mates -one male and two females brought to the Department of Parasitology in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in July 1930\".\n\nAs with the guinea pig, its sensitivity to infections with various agents has made the hamster particularly useful for research in protozoology and as an experimental animal for several viral infections. Under appropriate conditions of diet and oral flora, the hamster develops dental caries and has therefore been much used in dental research. Its habit of hibernation in response to cold weather led naturally to its use for the study of the effects of hypothermia on mammalian physiology and the hamster cheek pouch has been exploited for the study of microcirculation and the growth of transplanted tumors (18) .\n\nPerhaps because of their narrow original breeding base, hamsters show an unusual ability to retain skin homografts, between members of a closed colony.\n\nHowever, the hamster is now most familiar to biom\u00e9dical scientists because of the susceptibility of 24 day old animals to tumor induction by a variety of oncogenic viruses: polyoma virus and SV40, adenovirus, and avian and mammalian retroviruses.\n\nOur knowledge of T antigens is built almost entirely on the results of experiments in hamsters.\n\nTables 1 and 2 summarize the known occurrence of viruses of various families and genera in each of these four species of rodent.\n\nI have indicated which agents are apparently enzootic in each rodent species and those the occurrence of which is probably due to cross-infection in the laboratory. Some striking features emerge.\n\nThere is a notable lack of viruses indigenous to hamsters, probably because of their origin from three litter-mates, which would obviously influence the variety of viruses they carried as well as their genetic characteristics.\n\nThe variety of viruses recognized as enzootic in mouse colonies is very much greater than that found among rats or guinea pigs, although the latter animals may contract and maintain infection, within colonies, with some of the murine viruses.\n\nViruses of several families, subfamilies and genera are not represented in any rodent species. It is difficult to believe that rats and guinea pigs have as few indigenous viruses as the tables suggest -perhaps it is partly because virologists have devoted less attention to them.\n\nSeveral families or genera of viruses were first discovered in mice (Table 3) , and representatives of most of these groups have subsequently been discovered in humans or domestic animals.\n\nSome of the viruses listed are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in young animals, notably, in mice: ectromelia (Orthopoxvirus), mouse Most of the other murine viruses are associated with clinically inapparent infection. Clinical disease from viral infection is rarely seen with viruses that are specific for rats, guinea pigs or hamsters, but epizootics associated with significant mortality may occur due to cross-infection with murine or rarely other viruses, e.g., with cowpox virus in rats in Moscow (30). However, studies with specific-pathogen-free rodents whose normal enteric bacterial flora has been reconstituted suggests that some viral or other latent infections may interfere with normal development, since such SPF mice have larger litters, which grow to a larger size, than \"conventional\" rodents.\n\nIn saying that most of these viruses cause clinically inapparent infection I do not mean to minimize their importance.\n\nAs many of you know to your cost, the rare epizootics of mousepox and the more common outbreaks of Sendai virus infection or mouse hepatitis can be devastating, and during the symposium we shall hear detailed accounts of how best to prevent and control such occurrences.\n\nJust as important, the presence of enzootic viral infection in a colony of laboratory rodents has misled many 5. Keynote Address 29 an investigator. The occasions are legion in which a murine virus has been hailed as the cause of some human ailment, when it was found after human material was inoculated into a mouse.\n\nPerhaps the most dramatic example of the confusion of a rodent virus for a human pathogen was the Laigret-Durand strain of \"mouse-pathogenic murine typhus rickettsia,\" which was inoculated subcutaneously into thousands of human subjects in North Africa as a live vaccine, during the Second World War. The mouse pathogenicity was due to ectromelia virus, and when Packalen (31) studied the vaccine it consisted of nothing but that virus. As I have already mentioned, arbovirologists who routinely used mouse inoculation as the method of isolation of viruses from arthropods introduced the treatment of viruses thought to be recovered from such material with lipid solvents, because of the frequent recovery of murine viruses, expecially Theiler f s virus. Unlike all arboviruses except those of the genus Orbivirus, the murine picornaviruses are etherresistant.\n\nAs well as being disturbing to all experimenters if they cause obvious morbidity and mortality, and to virologists if they confuse attempts to isolate viruses, viral infections of experimental laboratory rodents may have other disturbing effects.\n\nSome latent murine viruses multiply preferentially in macrophages or particular classes of lymphocytes, others again, like mouse hepatitis virus, have destructive effects on the macrophages of genetically susceptible animals. Clearly such behavior may complicate and confound immunological investigations.\n\nMany latent viruses of rodents often localize in tumors produced experimentally in these animals, and may thus play havoc with certain kinds of cancer research. Unsuspected viral infections of the experimental animals may also complicate physiological and toxicological experiments. It is for these reasons that specificpathogen-free animals have been introduced into biom\u00e9dical research.\n\nUse of such animals avoids most of these problems, but for much work it is not practicable to use SPF animals. But natural viruses of rodents have positive values also, in . that they may provide experimental systems of interest in themselves (as with lactic dehydrogenase virus in mice) or as models for diseases of man or of animals of veterinary importance. This is enhanced by the ready availability of scores of genetically well characterized strains of mice, in particular, and of other laboratory rodents as well. Examples of such models that come to mind are the use of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus to study immunopathology, of mousepox to study the pathogenesis of generalized infection and the role of cell-mediated immunity in the recovery process, experiments on the genetics of viral virulence with reovirus in mice, the use of murine and guinea pig cytomegaloviruses as models of the human disease, and the elucidation of major histocompatibility (MHC) restriction by the use of genetically well characterized strains of mice, to say nothing of Wally Rowe's brilliant use of mouse leukemia virus to unravel the mysteries of retrovirus biology.\n\nDuring the rest of today and tommorrow morning and evening we shall hear detailed expositions as of several of these diseases and the uses to which they have been put.\n\nTommorrow afternoon we shall hear from speakers who see viral infections of laboratory rodents, whether clinically inapparent or not, as a cause for serious concern, in that they may interfere with research of various kinds; in infectious diseases, basic immunology, cancer and toxicology, for example.\n\nWhatever the objectives of their work, research scientists are better served if the experimental animals that they use are free of extraneous infectious agents. In theory, this can be achieved by the use of specific-pathogenfree animals, but there are many situations where these cannot be obtained. The key to control and prevention is to know what is present in the colonies of laboratory rodents.\n\nIt is highly appropriate, therefore, that half of the last session of our symposium is concerned with diagnostic methods that can be applied to the recognition of viral and mycoplasmal diseases of rodents.\n\nIn order to assure the maintenance and indeed the improvement of standards of quality in the laboratory rodents on which so many aspects of biom\u00e9dical science depend, it will be necessary to arrange for the continuation of the sort of discussions between basic scientists and animal producers that we see in this symposium. Perhaps one outcome of the meeting will be the development of some kind of machinery to achieve this goal."}
