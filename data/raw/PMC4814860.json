{"title": "Clinical outcomes in outpatient respiratory syncytial virus infection in immunocompromised children", "body": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in US children under 1 year of age.1, 2, 3 Increased morbidity and mortality have been reported in high\u2010risk patients, such as premature infants, infants with cardiac disease, and severely immunocompromised patients.4, 5, 6 Current therapeutic options for the treatment of RSV are limited to ribavirin and/or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).7, 8 New antivirals directed against RSV are under development with efficacy demonstrated in several human challenge studies in adults.9, 10 Increasingly, pediatric patients with malignancy or those undergoing transplantation are managed in the outpatient cancer care setting. Characteristics and clinical outcomes of RSV infection in pediatric immunocompromised outpatients may be different from acutely ill hospitalized inpatients. The objective of our study was to describe the clinical presentation and outcomes of RSV infection in an immunocompromised outpatient pediatric population.\n\nUsing laboratory records, we identified patients between birth and 21 years of age who had laboratory confirmation of RSV by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), real\u2010time reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction (qRT\u2010PCR), or viral culture at Seattle Children's Hospital in Seattle, WA, USA, between 2008 and 2013. For RSV quantitative viral load, the PCR threshold cycles of the nasal swab samples were compared to those of a standard curve generated by amplification of known numbers of RNA transcripts of the PCR amplicons.11, 12\n\n\nWe included patients with hematologic malignancy, solid organ transplant (SOT), or hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) who were outpatient at the time of diagnosis. Sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were abstracted from the electronic medical chart using a standardized form in Project REDCap.13 An illness episode was defined as the presence of at least one respiratory symptom (cough, wheezing, increased work of breathing, rhinorrhea, and/or apnea) in a patient with RSV detected by laboratory testing. The end of the illness episode was defined as a minimum of 14 days following symptom resolution. Only the first RSV illness episode for each patient was included in this analysis. RSV\u2010associated hospitalization was classified based on provider documentation of reason for hospitalization in the medical record.\n\nPotential healthcare\u2010associated infection was defined as an RSV illness in a patient seen in clinic two to eight days prior to RSV detection (\u201cpotential clinic acquired\u201d) [18]. Neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500 cells/\u03bcl. Lymphopenia was defined as an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) < 500 cells/\u03bcl. Viral or bacterial coinfections were determined by chart review of laboratory results obtained within 48 hours of diagnosis. Chest imaging obtained within seven days of diagnosis was included. Abnormal chest imaging was defined as a radiology result of consolidation, alveolar infiltrates, or airspace opacities. RSV\u2010attributable mortality was defined as death due to RSV\u2010associated respiratory failure. Data were analyzed using stata 12\u00b71 (STATA Corp, College Station, TX, USA). Fisher's exact tests were used for comparison of categorical variables, and Wilcoxon rank sum and anova tests were used for comparison of continuous variables. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seattle Children's Hospital.\n\nTen (27%) of 37 patients with chest imaging performed had abnormalities noted, with alveolar infiltrates (n = 4; 40%) as the most common finding. Three (6%) patients required supplemental oxygen therapy, and no patients required mechanical ventilation. Eleven (20%) patients received antibiotic therapy; indications included febrile neutropenia, bacteremia, and pneumonia.\n\nA minority of patients (n = 8, 15%) received ribavirin and/or IVIG for a median of 4\u00b75 days (range, 3\u201331 days) starting 1 day (range, 0\u20134 days) after RSV detection. Indications for treatment with ribavirin or IVIG included lymphopenia, delayed intensification phase of chemotherapy, neutropenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and preparation for transplant. One patient (2%) was admitted to the ICU, and no patients died due to RSV infection; however, one (2%) patient infected with RSV died due to complications of her underlying condition 676 days after RSV diagnosis.\n\nSeven patients had testing performed for RSV quantitative viral load. The median initial RSV viral load was 5\u00b79 log10 copies/ml (range, 4\u00b79\u20138\u00b73). Of the 3 patients with sequential viral load testing (Figure 2), Patient A, an 11\u2010year\u2010old female HCT recipient, received a 13\u2010day course of aerosolized ribavirin 2 days after which a RSV viral load was measured at 3\u00b787 log10 RSV copies/ml. Patient B, a 10\u2010year\u2010old female with ALL, had an increase in RSV viral load from 4\u00b752 log10 RSV copies/ml to 5\u00b744 log10 RSV copies/ml after an initial course of chemotherapy. After her second round of chemotherapy, her RSV viral load increased from 4\u00b757 log10 RSV copies/ml to 6\u00b724 log10 RSV copies/ml. Patient C, a 3\u2010year\u2010old male HCT recipient, experienced a decrease in viral load from 8\u00b734 log10 RSV copies/ml to 6\u00b755 log10 RSV copies/ml after a 6\u2010day course of ribavirin.\n\nThe vast majority of immunocompromised pediatric patients with RSV diagnosed at a tertiary care hospital over a 5\u2010year period were outpatients who were followed and diagnosed in outpatient specialty clinics and were not hospitalized following the detection of RSV. In contrast to reports of RSV infection in hospitalized immunocompromised children, these patients were less likely to be severely immunocompromised given their outpatient status. Few patients in our study received ribavirin and/or IVIG or supportive care with supplemental oxygen, although evaluation of these patients included chest imaging in 37% and antibiotic use in 20%. The overall impact of RSV alone on receipt of chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy was difficult to assess, but in this group of immunocompromised middle\u2010aged children who were likely to have previously experienced RSV infection, the immediate consequences of RSV infection were generally not severe.\n\nNo child died in our study due to RSV\u2010related causes in our study. Previous studies reported mortality rates ranging from 3 to 5% in patients with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease to 12\u201355% in HCT recipients.14, 15 In a single\u2010center study of pediatric immunocompromised inpatients, 5% mortality was reported, with an ICU admission rate of 28%.16 We believe that the low mortality in our population is due to the outpatient population, as well as advances in supportive care and more sensitive laboratory diagnostic techniques that enable more timely and sensitive detection of RSV infection.12\n\n\nFever was associated with risk of hospitalization in our study, while patients with hematologic malignancy were less likely to be hospitalized. El\u2010Saleeby and colleagues found that lymphopenia and younger age were risk factors for RSV\u2010associated LRTI, neither of which was associated with hospitalization in our study.17 Compared to the El\u2010Saleeby study, we also had a higher proportion of SOT recipients, who may be less immunocompromised depending on time since transplant and degree of immunosuppression. In this study, only a minority of the solid organ transplant recipients in this study were hospitalized and none died. Single institution inpatient studies have reported that RSV is the most commonly detected respiratory virus, particularly in pediatric lung transplant recipients. Pediatric abdominal transplant recipients with RSV infections have been reported to have mortality rates of 40%18, 19, 20; however, these studies have primarily described hospitalized patients. Larger studies in solid organ transplant recipients are needed to address this issue more completely.\n\nBecause this was an observational study, we were unable to determine the treatment efficacy of ribavirin or IVIG on viral load. We did observe that viral load decreased after initiation of ribavirin treatment in one patient and increased after several rounds of chemotherapy in one patient. RSV in immunocompromised patients is associated with prolonged shedding, likely as a consequence of inability of the host immune response to clear the infection.21 To our knowledge, there are no large\u2010scale retrospective or prospective studies of antiviral therapy for RSV in immunocompromised pediatric populations. With several new RSV antivirals in development including two that have been evaluated in challenge studies in healthy young adults, the assessment of sequential viral loads with receipt of treatment should be assessed to correlate with clinical outcomes in this relatively high\u2010risk patient population.\n\nWe found high rates of RSV infection that could have potentially been acquired in the outpatient clinic setting. RSV is often implicated in inpatient and outpatient nosocomial outbreaks in transplant wards, as documented by genotypic analysis.22, 23 Although these cases in our study could have been linked to clinic visits, these children were also living at home and therefore likely to have had more frequent contact with individuals interfacing with the community, such as siblings. In addition, many patients were seen very frequently, at least weekly, per their treatment protocols, which could also explain the high rate of potentially clinic\u2010acquired RSV infection.\n\nLimitations of our study include the use of retrospective chart review at a single institution. It is possible that patients who did not present for care with RSV infections were omitted from the study; however, most immunocompromised children received all of their care at our institution. It is also possible that we missed cases of RSV due to the limited sensitivity of DFA as compared to RT\u2010PCR assay in earlier years of the study. However, at our institution, DFA has a sensitivity of 93% compared to RT\u2010PCR in young children.11 Additional limitations include an inability to discern true nosocomial clinic\u2010acquired infections; sequencing of the samples would need to be performed to identify identical viral strains, and no residual samples were available for this analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, we find that a significant burden of RSV disease occurs in outpatient immunocompromised children, with low hospitalization rates and no mortality in a 5\u2010year study at our center. Studies of therapeutic interventions, such as trials of new antivirals, should consider inclusion of both outpatient and inpatient immunocompromised populations to assess the impact of treatment on a broadly representative patient population.\n\nHYC has received funding for research unrelated to this work from Pfizer and Glaxo Smith Kline; DMZ has received funding for research unrelated to this work from Chimerix; JAE has received reimbursement for speaking by Abbvie, and has acted as a paid consultant for Gilead and Pfizer, Inc.
