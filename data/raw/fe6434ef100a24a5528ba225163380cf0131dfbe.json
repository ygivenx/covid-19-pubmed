{"title": "", "body": "HIV pseudoparticles bearing the MERS-CoV spike protein was prepared as described (3) . HIV/MERS pseudoparticles (5 ng of p24) were pre-incubated with serially diluted heat inactivated serum for 30 min at 4\u00b0C and then added to Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) in triplicate in 96-well microtiter plates. Residual virus replication was assayed at 2 days post infection as described (3). The highest serum dilution giving a 90% reduction of luciferase activity was regarded as the ppNT antibody titer."}
