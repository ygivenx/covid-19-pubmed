{"title": "A 2009 cross-sectional survey of procedures for post-mortem management of highly infectious disease patients in 48 isolation facilities in 16 countries: data from EuroNHID", "body": "The European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases (EuroNHID) is a European Union-funded project (July 2007\u2013December 2010), whose aim is to support isolation facilities and provide appropriate infection control advice for isolation centers responsible for managing cases of emerging, re-emerging, or deliberately released HID agents. EuroNHID is coordinated by the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \u2018Lazzaro Spallanzani\u2019 (Rome, Italy) [1, 2, 16].\n\nIn 2009, field surveys were conducted in 48 isolation facilities in 16 European countries to assess resources and capabilities for the safe and effective management of HID patients. This survey assessed many infection control issues, including the availability of procedures and capabilities for the safe management of deceased patients. The objective of this study is to describe the data collected on the management of human remains and autopsies, and to present the indications of the EuroNHID panel for the safe post-mortem management of HID patients.\n\nNational Health Authorities in all European countries were contacted by the EuroNHID Coordination Team and by the European Commission; each was asked to suggest as a project partner a physician with expertise in the management of HIDs. This process resulted in the inclusion of 16 countries, and for each country one institution has been involved (except France, with two institutions involved).\n\nIn order to survey only isolation facilities identified by National Health Authorities for the referral and management of HIDs, we asked the partners to provide official documents in which these hospitals are clearly indicated. This process led to the identification of 48 isolation facilities, representing all centers officially endorsed by National Authorities to care for HID patients, for all participating countries except Spain, from which only centers from Catalonia were identified (Fig. 1).\n\n\nData were collected during on-site visits, using a set of checklists specifically developed (complete checklists are available on the website http://www.eunid.eu, after registration, under \u2018\u2018Documents\u2019\u2019). Three checklists were designed, including 16 main items, 44 topics, and 148 specific questions. \u201cPostmortem procedures\u201d was one of the main item, and the following features were evaluated in the 48 surveyed facilities: (1) the availability of written procedures for management of human remains (e.g., where to keep and how to transport the corpses); (2) the availability of safety procedures for the performance of autopsies; (3) availability and location of a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) autopsy room; and (4) availability of specific devices for safe postmortem examination [e.g., high-level personal protective equipments (PPE)\u2014such as powered air-purifying respirators equipped with N-95 respirator or high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)\u2014filters, impermeable protective clothing, surgical, and cut-proof gloves; and devices for the reduction of aerosol production during the use of oscillating saw\u2014plastic cover or vacuum bone dust collector to be attached to the saw. The specific topic/questions are reported in the Table 2.\n\n\nAll on-site visits were performed by the project coordinator together with a representative of the surveyed facility (usually the head of isolation facility, and/or persons responsible for infection control) from February to November 2009.\n\nOn the basis of the literature and partners\u2019 expert opinions, EuroNHID developed optimal and minimal indications for the management of human remains and for the safe performance of autopsies in HID-suspected/confirmed deceased patients. These indications were discussed with all partners, and a consensus was reached during the project final meeting, held in Rome in May 2010.\n\nAmong the 48 surveyed facilities, 4 (8.3 %) reported the availability of all features for the safe post-mortem management explored by the questionnaire. Conversely, in five facilities (10.4 %) none of these features were available.\n\nIn particular, 39 (81.2 %) reported to have written procedures for the management of human remains, and 27 (56.2 %) for the safe performance of autopsies in HID patients. Of these 27 facilities, we collected details about these procedures: in 7, the procedures stated that no autopsies should be performed on HID patients; among the remaining, in 16 facilities there was a dedicated specifically trained pathologist in charge to perform autopsies equipped with full PPE and trained in infection control, in 2 the autopsies were performed under the supervision of an infection control expert, in one post-mortem needle biopsies only were allowed, in the last one the procedure details were not available.\n\nA BSL-3 autopsy room (e.g., a room including a minimum of six air changes per hour, negative pressure relative to adjacent areas and direct exhaust of air to the outside or passed through HEPA filters, this definition has been adapted from international guidelines and from consensus documents for isolation facilities [1, 11, 13, 15, 18\u201321]) was available in eight facilities (16.6 %). In six of these, the BSL-3 autopsy room was located within the facility, and in the close proximity in two. Specific devices for safe autopsy (e.g., high-level PPE, and devices for the reduction of aerosol production during the use of oscillating saw) were available in nine facilities (18.7 %), six facilities were equipped both with BSL-3 and specific devices, while four facilities have specific devices but no BSL-3 room, and three facilities have infrastructure BSL-3 design only, with no specific devices.\n\nA limit of our study is represented by the fact that surveys were mainly performed about the availability of procedures, but we did not assess their application in the real life, and the compliance of staff to them. Moreover, another limit is represented by the fact that surveys were performed early in 2009, and this means that we collected most of the data before the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic experience, and before the recent EVD outbreak in West Africa, that is requiring an additional effort for preparedness in many European countries. The knowledge gained during the pandemic, as well as the current EVD outbreak, may have lead to modifications and improvements of procedures and capabilities, not registered in our data. Indeed, brief guidance for safe handling of people deceased from confirmed/suspected EVDs in hospitals and mortuaries has been disseminated in UK and USA [11, 15].\n\nAnother limit is that the representatives of the facility usually involved during the on-site surveys have been the infectious diseases and/or the infection control specialists, and not directly the pathologists, except few cases. This may have limited the level of details of data collected about this particular item. Moreover, it is possible that some other BSL-3 autopsy rooms were available in the country included in the study, but not connected with the clinical facilities surveyed, despite it is not probable since these facilities are those identified by National Health Authorities for the management of HIDs, and because we considered in our questionnaire that the BSL-3 autopsy room may be located even far away from the clinical facility [see Table 2, question 2(a)].\n\nThe indications for adequate management have some limits, also, but not linked to the study itself. Given the infrequency of suspected and confirmed HIDs, no high-quality studies exist, or no studies at all. Consequently, neither evidence-based recommendations nor any system of ranking of recommendations, is possible. Therefore, our indications are based on experiences reported in the literature and on the partners\u2019 expert opinion.\n\nDespite these limits, our data suggest some interesting remarks.\n\nFirst of all, these data represent the only available about this issue in European countries. Also in the light of the recent, and still ongoing EVD outbreak in West Africa, these data, even if collected in 2009, may represent a relevant source of information about the general level of preparedness of European facilities in dealing with corpses of patients deceased because of an HID.\n\nOur study shows that the special concerns posed by the post-mortem management in case of HIDs have been considered by the most part of surveyed facilities. Indeed, the majority of them report to have written procedures for the safe management of human remains.\n\nConversely, poor attention was given to safe autopsy procedures, since about half of facilities lack written procedures. This may represent a limit, given the fact that autopsies may be often necessary in these patients (especially if a clear diagnosis has not been established), and represent a high-risk procedure. The lack of written, well-known, and exercised safety procedures is considered cause of an increased risk of exposures for the workers performing the autopsy [22]. Similarly, a better attention should be given to select a small number of selected pathologists, those in charge for performing autopsies in these patients, in order to train them to work with full PPE and to safely remove them, as suggested for other HCWs [23]. Moreover, despite the fact that special autopsy suites and equipments are advocated by existing guidelines to increase the safety of autopsies [3, 18\u201321], the BSL-3 autopsy rooms were few, and the use of special devices, such as those for the reduction of aerosol production during the use of oscillating saw, was rarely reported. In some cases, as in the three facilities that reported to have a BSL-3 design for autopsy room but no specific devices and procedures, results seem inconsistent, since the availability of an equipped BSL-3 autopsy room is not enough if specific procedures are lacking. These data are more alarming in the specific setting of isolation facilities managing HIDs, where the use of special autopsy rooms and equipment is essential and may be more frequent.\n\nOur survey included 15 among the 27 European Member States in 2009 plus Norway. Despite the fact that geographic coverage was not complete, our results may be considered a suitable representative of the whole European picture, considering that the survey included the most populated European countries, covering about the 80 % of the population of the European Union. Of note, most of high-income European countries, which could invest more economic resources in the preparedness for HIDs, were included in the survey.\n\nIn conclusion, the level of preparedness of surveyed isolation facilities in the field of post-mortem management in case of HIDs was not satisfactory, and targeted interventions in this area are needed.\n\nThe indications by the EuroNHID panel about the safe management of human remains and autopsies in case of HID are reported in Tables 3 and 4 [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 18\u201321]. EuroNHID panel proposes minimal and optimal standards procedures, with the aim of improving healthcare workers awareness about the risks they take and to encourage them to be provided with the state of art knowledge and technologies to reduce the risk of infection.\n\n"}
