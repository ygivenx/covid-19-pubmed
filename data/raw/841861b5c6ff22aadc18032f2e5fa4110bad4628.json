{"title": "", "body": "We have recently reported the protective role of IgM in a cohort of patients with severe disease caused by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus [1] . Here we compared levels of 17 cytokines and 7 immunoglobulin isotypes in the plasma of these patients against those of a cohort of patients suffering from pneumonia caused by other viruses. Cytokines and immunoglobulins were measured by using Biorad multiplex kits. Respiratory samples were screened for the presence of viruses by using the A(H1N1)pdm09 Detection Set (Roche \u00ae ), the Respiratory Viral Panel-XTAG RVP (Abott \u00ae ) or culturing them on Hep2/Vero/MDCK-SIAT cells. In the non-influenza group (n = 20), the viral aetiology was as follows: Entero/Rhinovirus (n = 7), Metapneumovirus (n = 6), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (n = 5), Coronavirus NL63 (n = 1) and Herpesvirus (n = 1). Patients with influenza (n = 38) were younger (median (yrs), (Fig. 1) .\n\nLocal IgA in the respiratory mucosa has been shown to play an important protective role in the infection caused by respiratory viruses [3, 4] . However the role-played by systemic IgA in this context is not well known. This work evidences for the first time the existence of lower levels of plasma IgA in patients with viral pneumonia caused by influenza. The potential of IgA in determining viral aetiology along with its participation in the pathogenic events in this disease merits further investigation.\n\nThe authors acknowledge the support of \"Instituto de Salud Carlos III -Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias, FIS\" and Health Council, Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n (JCYL-IECSCYL-SACYL): Programa de Investigaci\u00f3n Comisionada en Gripe, GR09/0021, GR09/0022.
