{"title": "MULTICENTRE DOUBLE-BLIND STUDY OF EFFECT OF INTRATHECALLY ADMINISTERED NATURAL HUMAN FIBROBLAST INTERFERON ON EXACERBATIONS OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS* LAWRENCE JACOBS1 ROBERT HERNDON4 ARNOLD FREEMAN5 ALBERT CUETTER2 WILLIAM A. SMITH2", "body": "IN 1981 we reported the results of an open preliminary study suggesting that intrathecally administered natural human fibroblast interferon (IFN-B) reduced exacerbations in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. 12 The rationale for *Presented in part at the annual meeting of the International Society for Interferon Research, Espoo, Finland, on Sept 12, 1986. administering IFN-B to such patients included evidence for a viral and immunopathological aetiology for this disease and the known potent antiviral and immunomodulatory actions of the interferons.3-8 IFN-B was given intrathecally because interferons do not effectively cross the blood-brain barrier to reach the central nervous system (CNS) when administered systemically, but can safely be given intrathecally. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] We have since carried out a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-year multicentre study, including 3-5 times as many patients as the preliminary study, to determine definitively whether intrathecally administered IFN-B is beneficial in MS. 19 This study was monitored throughout by the United States National Institutes of Health.\n\nWe studied 69 patients who met the clinical and laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of definite MS.20-23 All had exacerbating/ remitting disease (stable or progressive) and high prestudy exacerbation rates (at least 0-6 per year). The prestudy duration of illness was at least 1 year in all but 2 patients (5 months, 10 months), who were included because they clearly had MS (recently revised criteria23) with high exacerbation rates. Each patient underwent a complete neurological examination at the beginning of the study, and the severity of symptoms and signs was scored according to a modified Kurtzke method.\"-24 The prestudy exacerbation rate was determined by dividing the total number of exacerbations (standard definitionz&deg;-z3) recorded before the study by the duration of disease up to the time of randomisation. In the 2 patients who had had MS for less than a year, the number of exacerbations recorded before the study was considered as the number that would have occurred in a full year (ie, we did not adjust their rates upward to compensate for their shorter disease durations). Patients were then randomly assigned (biased coin) to the recipient or control group by means of stratification based on prestudy exacerbation rate (ie, less than two exacerbations/year; two or more exacerbations/year). The randomisation yielded recipient and control populations with similar mean prestudy exacerbation rates (recipients 1 79, controls 1-98 per year). There were no meaningful differences in other clinical parameters between the two groups (eg, age, sex, prestudy disease duration, disability status, and functional group scores).\n\nPatients were re-examined regularly or whenever they felt they might be having an exacerbation, exacerbations, clinical disability status, functional group scores, and an overall assessment of the patient's clinical condition (improved, unchanged, worsened) were recorded. Exacerbations were treated by intramuscular or intravenous corticotropin daily for 10 days. Such treatment may limit the severity of symptoms and signs of exacerbations but does not prevent their recurrence. 21 Exacerbation rates during the study were calculated from the number of exacerbations occurring during the study and the time on the study. A one-tailed t statistic was used to test the effect of treatment on changes in exacerbation rate. The statistical plan, based on data from our preliminary study was designed to detect a true difference in exacerbation-rate reductions between recipients and controls of 0-65 exacerbations per year at a type I error level of 0-05 with a power of 0,80.19\n\nThe IFN-B used was produced by superinduction of human fibroblast cells at Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo.l The preparation had a specific activity of 1 x 107 interferon reference units of IFN-B per mg protein. It was the same type as that used in the preliminary study and had passed the toxicity and safety tests required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA IND no 1325).\n\nIFN-B was given to the recipients by serial lumbar punctures carried out weekly for the first 4 weeks and then once a month for the next 5 months of the study (ie, nine lumbar punctures during the first 6 months of the study). The dose to each recipient was 1 x 106 ' interferon reference units at each treatment, except that at one centre patients received two half-dose treatments in the first week and then 1 x 106 interferon reference units at all the other treatments (ie, ten lumbar punctures during the first 6 months of the study). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was withdrawn for analysis before the injection of IFN-B at each lumbar puncture. Recipients also underwent a lumbar puncture after 2 years on the study so that CSF could be obtained for analysis. Control patients underwent placebo treatments according to the same schedule as the recipients. However, true lumbar punctures were carried out only at the beginning, after 6 months, and after 2 years on the study to obtain CSF for analysis; the remainder were false lumbar punctures in which the routine procedure (eg, positioning, draping, skin cleansing, local anaesthetic) was followed but the needle was advanced only into the subcutaneous tissues, where 5 ml sterile water was injected. Recipients took indomethacin 25-50 mg every 6 h for 24 h after each treatment; controls took indomethacin (same dose) or placebo capsules according to the same schedule. Indomethacin, so administered, is known to reduce the side-effects of intrathecal interferon, which helped blinding of the patients .21\n\nTreatments were carried out by a \"treating\" physician in an outpatient treatment room at each centre; afterwards the patient's vital signs were monitored. The initial and subsequent examinations, assessing exacerbations and clinical status, were carried out by a separate \"examining\" physician at each centre who was not aware what treatment the patient had received. Patients did not discuss side-effects of treatments with the examining physician. Questionnaires completed by the patients and examining physicians during the study confirmed that both groups were blinded. A chi-square statistic based on a 3 x 2 table, testing the independence of each individual's impression (IFN-B, placebo, unknown) from actual therapy received yielded an examining physician p = 0-66 and a patient's p=0'07. The questionnaires also revealed that most patients who had an opinion believed they were receiving IFN-B (79-3% of recipients, 63-6% of controls).\n\nThe figure shows the exacerbation rates before and during the study for the two groups of patients. The exacerbation rates of both groups fell during the study: recipients mean 1-79 (SEM 0-17) to 0-76 (0-15) per year; controls 1-98 (0-21) to 1-48 (0-17) per year. However, the change was significantly greater in the recipients than in the controls ( 1-02 v 0 &deg; 51 exacerbations per year: p < 0-04). The greater reduction in rate in recipients compared with controls was consistently observed at all three centres. The mean prestudy rates of the recipients and controls were nearly identical, but the recipients' mean rate during the study was significantly lower than that of the controls Interferon Placebo\n\nMean exacerbation rates (exacerbations/year) before and during the study in 34 recipients and 35 controls with MS.\n\nVertical bars represent 2SEM; Alfn is reduction in recipient rates and .6 Pla reduction in placebo controls during study.\n\n(p<0'001).\n\nCorrelation analysis revealed that the exacerbation rate during the study was strongly dependent on and directly proportional to the prestudy rate in the controls (r=0'51, p<0001), but not in the recipients (r = 0-02, p=045).\n\nClinically, 26 recipients (76-5%) and 21 controls (60%) were improved or unchanged, and 8 recipients (23-5%) and 14 controls (40%) were worse at the end of the study. The extent of deterioration was greatest in the controls (mean modified Kurtzke score increases: controls 0-80, recipients 0-32). However, this trend (recipients clinically stable or better; controls clinically worse) was not statistically significant (chi-square p = 0-23).\n\nSide-effects of treatment (headache, nausea, myalgia, lethargy) occurred with comparable frequency in recipients and controls, which may be attributed, at least partly, to the efficacy of indomethacin in reducing IFN-B side-effects. Low-grade fevers (mean 38-2&deg;C) occurred more often in recipients (75%) than in controls (31 %) (chi-square p < 0&deg;001), but this did not break the double-blinding (see above).\n\nPleocytosis and rises in CSF protein occurred in recipients during treatment. The maximum pleocytosis (mean 1-22x10/1, range 0-12-5-66 x 10$/1) and rise in protein (mean 590 mg/1, range 240-1600 mg/1) were noted during the first 5 weeks of treatment. At the last treatment (6 months), mean pleocytosis was 0-25 x 108/1 (range 0-02-1-88 x 10$/1) and mean CSF protein 460 mgjl (range 150-1600 mg/1). At 2 years, mean pleocytosis was 0-16 x 108/1 (range 0-01-0-61 x 108/1) and the mean CSF protein was 460 mg/1 (range 150-1600 mg/1).\n\nIt is known that the exacerbation rates of MS patients may fall over time as a natural phenomenon. However, studies of the changes in exacerbation rates of 393 MS patients26 show that, when our patients entered the study (illness duration 5-4 years in recipients, 6-1 years in controls) no decrease in rate would have been expected in either group during the study as a natural phenomenon. Therefore, we attribute most of the 57% reduction in exacerbation rate in recipients to the IFN-B treatment. We also attribute the uncoupling of dependence of the rate during the study on the prestudy rate observed in recipients (but not controls) to IFN-B treatment. The 26% reduction in exacerbation rate observed in the controls during the study might have been due to a placebo effect. We will continue our follow-up of the patients in this study. In our preliminary study the IFN-B prophylactic effect against exacerbations persisted for 4-4&mdash;5-3 years without retreatment.43-45 We emphasise that our treatment schedule may not be the optimum one. In the preliminary study, patients underwent thirteen treatments in 6 months; the number was reduced to nine in this study, and both regimens significantly reduced exacerbation rates. It is possible that even fewer treatments at different intervals might provide similar degrees of prophylaxis."}
