{"title": "ACE2 expression by colonic epithelial cells is associated with viral infection, immunity and energy metabolism", "body": "expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-nCoV infection.\n\nPatients infected by 2019-nCoV can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis.

One (3%) of the first 41 reported cases had diarrhea [1] . In another report describing a familial cluster, 2 of the 6 family members (33%) developed diarrhea [2] . Furthermore, positive 2019-nCoV was detected from the stools of a patient with loose of bowel movement in the United States [3] .\n\nThere have been many studies on the proteins associated with host entry by the SARS-CoV.\n\nCleavage of Spike protein by tissue factor Xa is required for the infectivity of SARS-CoV [4] .\n\nRivaroxaban is an oral anticoagulant used to combat acute pulmonary embolism with or without deep-vein thrombosis [5] . As an Xa inhibitor, it may thus offer protection for 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the SARS-CoV receptor [6] . It also has been linked to 2019-nCoV infection; ACE2 interacts with the Spike protein and mediates 2019-nCoV infection of the type II alveolar cells of the lung [7] .\n\nParadoxically, although ACE2 mediates viral entry to the host, its deficiency worsens lung injury by activating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in experimental models [6] . The circulating RAS regulates blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. Local tissue-based RAS exacerbates pulmonary hypertension, acute lung injury and experimental lung fibrosis [8] . Thus, blocking of the Angiotensin II receptor type I (AT1R) was associated with reduced SARS-CoV spike protein mediated lung injury [6] and reduced pulmonary hypertension in experimental models [9] . The AT1R blocker valsartan has recently been reported to improve clinical outcomes for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated with pulmonary hypertension (DOI:10.1183/13993003.congress-2019.PA2469).

ACE2 expression in the gut epithelial cells is required for maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and the ecology of gut microbiome in the intestine [11, 12] . We had previously generated a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from control subjects and those with colitis or IBD [13] . Using this dataset, we examined ACE2 expression and found that it was specifically and highly expressed by the colonocytes (Figure 1 A- Given that ACE2 plays dual roles in mediating viral entry and preventing tissue injury [6, 11, 12, 14] , we analyzed genes that are co-expressed with ACE2 in the colonic epithelial cells. In total, 3420 and 2136 genes were positively and negatively correlated with ACE2 expression, respectively (Supplementary table 1 and Figure 2A ). In Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, genes positively correlated with ACE2 expression were enriched in viral infection and egress (viral All rights reserved.

In supportive of the view that ACE2 expression prevents intestinal inflammation [11, 12] , bioinformatic analysis suggested that genes regulating type I and type III innate immunity, NK and T cell mediated cytotoxicity and energy metabolism are positively associated with ACE2 expression.

These findings may facilitate concurrent and future investigations of the nature and function of the immune system at systemic and local levels in patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\nNotably, SARS-CoV spike protein engagement downregulates ACE2 expression and activates the RAS [6] . Given that hypertension is common in severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia [1] , it is highly likely that the RAS is activated in the lungs of patients with severe pneumonia.

Informed written consents from the legal guardians of all participants were obtained before conducting these procedures.\n\nColonic biopsies from 17 children (6 control, 6 colitis, 2 ulcerative colitis, 3 Crohn's disease)\n\nwere subjected to single-cell suspension preparation, 5 ' gene expression libraries construction, and 10x Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing [13] . Cellranger v2.1 pipeline (10x genomics) was utilized to demultiplex the cellular barcodes and align reads to the human transcriptome (build GRCh38). The unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrix was converted to Seurat object using the R package Seurat v2. 3.4 [22] . After quality control and data normalization, dimension reduction and cell clustering were performed [13] . Different cell types were identified by mapping canonical marker genes in the two-dimensional t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor embedding (tSNE) map [13] .\n\nNormalized single-cell RNA expression data was used for co-expression analysis. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed between each gene in the single-cell transcriptome and ACE2.\n\nSignificantly correlated genes were chosen (p-value<0.05) for downstream GO enrichment analysis via GENEONTOLOGY at http://geneontology.org/.
