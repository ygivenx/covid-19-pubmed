{"title": "Archives of Virology Electron Microscopy Detection and Characterization of Viral Particles in Doff Stools", "body": "Electron microscopy has revealed the presence of several types of virus particles in faeces from different avian and mammalian species, including man. Among them, the best characterized are the rotaviruses, whose ultrastruetural, biochemical and immunological properties led to the definition of a new taxonomic viral genus (7) . More recently other new intestine born viruses have been detected by transmission electron microscopy of both human and non human diarrheic and normal stools (9) . These newly recognized viruses include : astroviruses, caliciviruses, eoronaviruses, and small round viruses (picorna and parvovirus like) which are easily distinguishable by their particular morphology. All these viruses, and more specially rotaviruses, have been implicated as etiological agents in nosocomial and community acquired diarrhea (8) . Therefore, it seems of impor-0304-8608/80/0066/0089/$ 01.00 tance to define clearly their n a t u r a l history and, more particularly, the possible animal sources of contamination. We report in this article our results concerning the electron microscopy study of the viral flore in dog stools and the demonstration of the existence of several different virus particles in r a n d o m l y collected canine faeces. Some of our results concerning rotaviruses have been published in a preliminary report (17).\n\nDog stools were collected randomly on the sidewalks of Paris streets in June 1979. They were picked up only if they presented a non diarrheic aspect. Treatment of faeces was carried out as described previously (15) . Briefly, 5 g of the collected material were suspended in 5 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 1 ml of trichlorotrifluoroethane and then homogenized. The homogenatcs were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 400 \u00d7 g and 4 \u00b0 C. Supernatants were treated for negative staining with 1 per cent phosphotungstie acid at pH 7.2, and directly inspected under an electron microscope (Phillips 301). Virus particles were sought in at least five grid squares and classified following the criteria defined by FLEWETT (7) and MEDELEY (9) .\n\nThree morphological classes of viruses were present in the stools of 27 out of 56 dogs (Table 1) . These included rotavirus (3.5 per cent), coronavirus (12.5 per cent), and parvovirus-like (23.2 per cent). I n 8.9 per cent of the cases, both coronaviruses and parvoviruses-like particles were observed together. Rotaviruses were always observed alone. The rotavirus particles were morphologically undistinguishable from the ones described in other species (Fig. 1 a) (14) . Both double and smooth single shelled types were seen in the preparations. Double shelled particles showed a circular contour which was sharply defined by a membraneous layer; they had a diameter of 70 nm. Single shelled rough particles had a diameter of 60 n m a n d revealed more clearly the hollow ring shaped eapsomeres.\n\nCoronavirus particles showed a typical morphology (6) (Fig. 1 b) . They were pleomorphic, with a range in diameter from 100 to 500 n m including the projections which were approximately 15 n m in length. Most particles were between 100 and 200 n m in diameter. The projections formed a single fringe radiating from the core. Only the dilated distal ends of the projections were seen with nega, tive stain. IXTo internal structure was observed. The particles appeared both alone and associated.\n\nThe number of particles ressembling parvovirus-like particles (4) was always higher than that of rotaviruses and coronaviruses like particles. B y measuring a large number of them, it was possible to determine a mean diameter of 26 nm (Fig. 1 e) . The outlines were often round or polygonal and m a n y of the particles Fig. 1. a l%otavirus (100,000 \u00d7 magnification) , b Coronavirus (100,000 \u00d7 magnification), c Parvoviruswlike particles ( 100,000 \u00d7 magnification)\n\nwere penetrated by the phosphotungstate, so that they appeared as empty virions with no perceptible surface structure.\n\nSince the assessment of the viral etiology of severe gastroenteritic diseases both in man and in other species, the studies concerning the suspected viral agents have rapidly multiplied (7, 8, 9) . However, many of the questions posed by these viruses are not yet fully understood, specially their natural history and their epidemiology. We decided to focus our attention on dogs for three reasons: l) even if dogs have been shown to be occasionally infected by coronaviruses (18) and parvoviruses (4) , no systematic studies of the canine intestinal flora has yet been published, 2) antibodies against rotaviruses have been found in dogs (1t), 3) pollution by dogs stools constitutes a serious sanitary problem in most cities and suburban areas.\n\nOur results indicate that particles with the ultrastructural morphology of rotaviruses, eoronaviruses, and parvoviruses exist commonly in apparently normal dog faeces randomly collected in the sidewalks of a big city such as Paris.\n\nThe finding of rotaviruses in dog stools could be relevant concerning the epidemiology of rotaviruses associated human diseases. The particles we found could either be merely canine or originated in other species. In any of both cases, they may be pathogenic for man. In fact, a significant number of experimental cross species transmission of rotaviruses have now been reported (12, 3, 13, 23, 21) and some evidence of bovine rotaviruses in pigs has already been published (20, 22) . In our case, we cannot answer this important question. We can only say that the two isolates originated in dogs cross-reacted with bovine rotaviruses in an ELISA test (16) , which would suggest a cross reactivity with human strains. Experiments concerning this subject are going on in our laboratory.\n\nThe presence of coronaviruses in the stools of dogs with and without gastroenteritis has been observed in United States and Australia (19, 18) . We fully confirm these results: an important number of examined specimens showed particles having the ultrastructure morphology of coronaviruses. At present, eoronavirus are classified almost entirely by means of their characteristic morphology (6, 10, 19) . Our strains presented all of them identical morphological aspect and they were strictely comparable to previous eoronavirus isolates. However biochemical and serological studies should be necessary to further ascertain the eoronavirus identity of these strains. In this context, it is interesting to point out that the coronaviruses are known to cause gastroenteritis (5) and respiratory diseases (10) in man.\n\nThe parvovirusdike partieIe which we identified, are undistinghishable from the parvovirus described in canine hemorrhagic enteritis (4) and from the viral agent detected in apparently healthy animals (2) . Recently outbreaks of canine parvovirus-like viral enteritis have been reported in various locations throughout the United States (1).\n\nWe are not yet in a position to draw a conclusion on the possible hazards to human health deriving from the presence of all these viruses in dogs. Nevertheless we believe that this new field should be throughly explored."}
