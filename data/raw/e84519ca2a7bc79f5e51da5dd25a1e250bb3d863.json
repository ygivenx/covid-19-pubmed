{"title": "Approach to the Patient in the Tropics with Pulmonary Disease", "body": "Pulmonary disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality throughout the world and respiratory tract infections are the most frequent infections of humans. 1 As represented in Box 128-1, four of the ten leading causes of global death reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) are attributable to some form of acute or chronic pulmonary disease. 2 The viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoal etiologies of worldwide lung disease are protean. Tropical pulmonary disease includes most temperate climate etiologies as well as a greater incidence and prevalence of tuberculosis (TB), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related disease, and helminthic infections. Diverse factors such as poverty, crowding, malnutrition, and proximity to animals are responsible for a range of diseases that are infrequently encountered outside the tropics.\n\nAs developing nations make economic transitions, smoking and unregulated occupational and environmental exposures become significant risk factors for previously uncommon pneumoconioses and respiratory malignancies. 3, 4 Conversely, as travel between industrialized and tropical nations increases, agents responsible for localized outbreaks of disease in remote, undeveloped areas have been more frequently imported to the industrialized world. Most notably, in China and Southeast Asia in 2003, the ability of a zoonotic coronavirus (later designated SARS CoV) to infect humans led to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS quickly became a major public health emergency not only in much of Asia but also in Canada and, to a lesser extent, in the United States and Europe. Novel influenza viruses have commonly been first discovered in tropical Asian populations where animals, especially chickens, ducks, and pigs, are often kept in close proximity to humans. As outbreaks of avian (and swine) influenza occur in these areas, sporadic cases of these same strains occur in humans, creating the potential for human-zoonotic recombinations and the possibility of returning travelers presenting with these \"exotic\" strains.\n\nThe following overview is designed as a starting point in developing a differential diagnosis for patients presenting with pulmonary complaints who have had exposure in the tropics. Emphasis will be given to those entities found exclusively or more commonly in the tropics. In Table 128 -1, parasitic etiologies associated with respiratory disease from the tropics and their geographic distributions are shown and demonstrates the diversity of pathogens that must be considered. 5 The specific disease entities and treatment are fully described in the individual pathogen chapters of the text.\n\nClinicians evaluate patients' illnesses in geographic areas differently depending on the resources available and the local prevalence of diseases. In developing a differential diagnosis for respiratory complaints, it is helpful to consider patients in three relatively distinct groups that have considerable differences in their exposure to various risk factors:\n\n1. Lifelong denizens of the tropics (as well as those from the tropics who have recently immigrated to a temperate area) 2. Travelers who have returned from the tropics after short (less than 1 month) visits 3. Expatriates from temperate areas who are currently living in or have just returned from the tropics. Even when coming from (or living in) the same region, the etiologies and diagnostic approaches to each of these groups may be quite different as the intensity of their exposures, potential contact with infected individuals, and access to medical care (and advanced diagnostics) may be significantly diverse. For example, a patient who presents with hemoptysis in most industrialized nations has a high likelihood of having a lung neoplasm, whereas natives of the tropics with hemoptysis are much more likely to have tuberculosis, and the differential diagnosis for an expatriate living in the tropics falls somewhere between these two groups. 6\n\nAcute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) include a spectrum of illnesses from colds and influenza to streptococcal pharyngitis and pneumococcal pneumonia. As such, they may be little more than an annoyance or they may be associated with a fulminant course and significant morbidity and mortality.\n\nUpper respiratory illnesses (URIs) are the most common infections in humans in both temperate and tropical climates and are primarily viral in etiology. The frequency of respiratory infections among children is much greater than in adults. 7 Although the frequency of URIs in the tropics appears to be no higher than in temperate climates, children in the tropics often suffer from chronic malnutrition. Undernourished children experience respiratory infections, coupled with bouts of diarrhea, intestinal helminth infection, epidemic measles, and more. These co-morbidities make what might be a mild respiratory illness in an otherwise healthy child significantly more serious in children living in the tropics (Table 128 -2). 8 The role of viral URIs, particularly influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, in predisposing individuals to subsequent bacterial infection, predominantly with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae has emphasized the importance of controlling epidemic influenza in developing nations where vaccines have been historically underutilized. 9 Acute lower respiratory infections cause most of the respiratory disease-associated deaths and, in terms of years of life 10 The most common etiologies of childhood pneumonia in developing countries are summarized in Box 128-2. 11 Although all age groups have some deaths associated with lower respiratory infections, the greatest burden is borne by children, especially those younger than 5 years old, with an estimated 3 to 4 million deaths annually. 12, 13 Data from WHO reveal a marked difference in the proportion of deaths in children less than 5 years old caused by ARIs in Europe (11%) and the Americas (14%) versus Africa (22%) and Southeast Asia (19%). 1 Most developed nations of Europe and North America report less than 5% of childhood deaths due to ARIs. Africa not only bears the burden of very high childhood mortality, but also has nations with more than 25% of childhood deaths due to ARIs. 1 The role of co-infection with HIV and/or malnutrition in ARI-associated deaths cannot be overemphasized. Recent WHO data from Botswana, currently the nation with the highest prevalence of HIV infection, revealed that aproximately 60% of childhood deaths due to HIV/acquired immunodeficiency virus (AIDS), often associated with respiratory coinfections. 14 S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae remain the most important bacterial causes of pneumonia in young children, accounting for 70% of the deaths from pneumonia and neonatal sepsis. 11 The use of H. influenzae B and, more recently, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines has dramatically decreased the frequency of these infections in developed countries but, due to their cost, they remain underutilized in the developing nations. 9 Bacterial antimicrobial resistance has become an increasing problem worldwide, including in the tropics. Lack of antibiotic availability in some areas has led to low prevalence of resistant organisms. Conversely, poorly controlled access to antibiotics and inappropriate use has led to very high levels of resistance in other areas. One study in Uganda identified 95% of S. pneumoniae as penicillin-resistant and 75% of H. influenzae as \u03b2-lactamase producing. Despite this resistance, there was a good clinical response to ampicillin even among HIV-infected individuals. 15 Availability of antibiotics in developing nations is quite variable: Many nations have access to less expensive penicillin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline and aminoglycosides, but the more expensive third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and newer macrolides that are commonly used in developed nations are often unavailable.\n\nCommon causes of atypical pneumonia, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella spp., are probably as common in the tropics as they are in temperate areas but have been poorly studied due to difficulty in culturing and the expense of serology. Outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease associated with travel, especially among the elderly, have been reported on numerous occasions. Nearly half the cases of Legionella pneumonia in the United Kingdom are travel-associated. 16 Measles (rubeola) is the most important viral respiratory disease. Measles is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in much of the developing world, with an estimated 40 million annual cases and 800,000 deaths per year, half of which occur in Africa. Most unvaccinated children in endemic areas are infected by age 5. 17 Since the introduction of measles vaccination in 1963, there has been a marked decrease in measles cases and, as of March 2005, no indigenous transmission of measles has occurred in the Americas for over 2 years; WHO has a goal of worldwide eradication by 2015. 17 Numerous studies from the 1930s to the present have demonstrated a marked reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with measles infections after initiation of childhood vitamin A supplementation. This is especially evident in refugee settings where malnutrition and a measles outbreak may be the leading cause of death. 18 Particular settings in the tropics may suggest the role of certain bacterial organisms: Examples are staphylococcal pneumonia complicating measles and varicella, pertussis in areas with inadequate childhood immunization, and Klebsiella pneumonia in lower socioeconomic rural settings where alcoholism and malnutrition may play a role. Chronic cavitary upper lobe infiltrates in a patient from Southeast Asia may be misidentified as tuberculosis but actually represent melioidosis, a chronic infection of Burkholderia pseudomallei, a soil saprophyte endemic to Southeast Asia and part of Australia (see Chapter 34) . Melioidosis is the most common cause of fatal, community-acquired pneumonia at a regional referral hospital in the Northern Territory of Australia. In a series of 252 cases of melioidosis in Australia, half presented with pneumonia and one-quarter were bacteremic, 15% presented with pneumonia and septic shock, and 84% of the septic individuals died. 19 Melioidosis is well documented to occur months to years after exposure and it should remain in the differential diagnosis for those with appropriate exposure who present with chronic, subacute or acute pulmonary disease that may appear to be tuberculosis. 20 Occupational exposures may suggest an etiology for unusual bacterial pneumonias such as anthrax, Q fever, tularemia, and leptospirosis. Outbreaks associated with Hantaviruses, pneumonic plague, influenza, and SARS corona-virus are all potential etiologies that should be considered. Since all of these rarer causes of pneumonia can be found nearly worldwide to varying degrees, it may be most helpful to query WHO (www.who.int/csr/outbreaknet work/en/) or CDC (www.cdc.gov/travel/outbreaks.htm) websites to get updates about outbreaks of diseases in different countries.\n\nCough, a common symptom of URIs, is also frequently associated with pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, sinusitis, and asthma. URIs are the most common illnesses of travelers to the tropics. Patients will often assume the worst, that they have developed SARS, tuberculosis, or pneumonia, and seek medical evaluation earlier than they may have if they became ill without traveling. Patients usually do not seek medical attention for cough until it has persisted for more than 5 to 7 days and most cough lasting less than two months is associated with relatively benign viral or bacterial etiologies, but may be associated with recent infection with Ascaris, hookworm, Strongyloides, or schistosomes. Cough persisting for more than 2 months is considered chronic, and a far wider differential diagnosis should be considered, especially in individuals in the tropics or returning from the tropics. 21, 22 Table 128-3 lists some considerations for the differential diagnosis of chronic cough. Many of the infectious etiologies for cough are fully described in other chapters.\n\nIn developing a differential diagnosis for chronic cough, in-depth inquiry into the patient' s travel background and exposure history must be obtained. A knowledge of which diseases and infectious agents are endemic to the area is also crucial. A short-term traveler to an urban area of the tropics may have only a remote opportunity to have encountered helminths or tuberculosis, whereas those with a long-term travel history to remote areas, and extensive exposure to the local population, have probably had ample opportunity to be exposed to the wide range of infectious agents endemic in the tropics. Some of these same exposure considerations should be applied to those who live in the tropics; an urban office worker is much less likely to have had the constant animal, insect, and freshwater contact of a rice farmer in rural areas.\n\nTuberculosis should nearly always be considered in the differential of chronic cough if there is associated fever, weight loss, and pulmonary infiltrates, particularly in infants and young children. Schistosomiasis and intestinal helminths should be considered in \"eco-tourists,\" campers, and those who report freshwater exposure as well as rural denizens. Endemic mycoses, melioidosis, and environmental toxins are potential etiologies that should be entertained in the context of the appropriate geographic region and exposure history. Chest radiographs and serology, as well as sputa and stool microscopy, will usually confirm these diagnoses if they have been considered in the evaluation.\n\nA complete blood count with differential should always be obtained, as cough associated with a parasitic infection may have a normal total leukocyte count but a significantly elevated eosinophil count that would guide the diagnostic evaluation (see Chapter 125). Radiographs of the chest are also indicated in evaluation of chronic cough as characteristic radiologic findings are seen with many of the diagnoses. Abnormal chest radiographs in resource-rich nations are often further evaluated by computed tomography (CT) scan. Although readily available in most developed nations, CT scanners are not available in 40% of the sub-Saharan countries and are not readily available in many other areas as well. 23 Similarly, availability of bronchoscopic evaluation is variable outside developed nations but should be considered if the etiology of cough cannot be determined with less invasive testing. Sputum examination is generally available in most areas. Sputum examination is most important to rule out tuberculosis (TB) and, in contrast to some other diagnostic modalities, microscopists in the developing world are often quite experienced and skilled in reading stains for acid-fast bacteria, protozoa, and helminths. In temperate areas, routine sputa and even bronchoscopic samples are often not examined for fungi, mycobacteria, and parasites. These etiologies, more common in the tropics, should nearly always be considered in the diagnostic evaluation.\n\nRegardless of tropical or temperate exposure, the development of significant hemoptysis nearly always warrants diagnostic evaluation. While trivial hemoptysis with scant streaks of blood is not uncommon with bronchitis, the differential diagnosis should remain broad, especially in those with tropical exposure. While studies of the etiology of hemoptysis vary significantly depending on geographic location and decade of publication, hemoptysis often indicates an underlying serious disease.\n\nAlthough bronchiectasis and neoplasia are the most common causes of hemoptysis in developed nations, tuberculosis may exceed these noninfectious etiologies in developing nations. Understanding the prevalence of TB in the area where the patient was traveling (or living) is crucial in developing the differential diagnosis. In a 1997 study from Israel of 208 patients presenting with hemoptysis, only 3 (1.4%) were associated with TB. 24 Similarly, in an older U.S. study from Boston in 1952, only 2 (1.9%) of 105 cases of hemoptysis were attributed to tuberculosis. 25 Conversely, in a 2002 study from Turkey of 108 cases of hemoptysis, 18 (17.4%) were associated with tuberculosis 26 and in a 2001 study of 52 patients with hemoptysis from Kuwait, 17 (32.7%) of the cases were attributed to either \"old\" or active pulmonary TB. 27 A similar study performed in an area with much higher TB rates, such as Afghanistan or sub-Saharan Africa, might find TB in an even greater percentage of patients presenting with hemoptysis than the relatively less affected Turkey and Kuwait.\n\nThe role of other infectious etiologies such as S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus spp., melioidosis, endemic fungi, amoeba, and helminthic agents (ascaris, hookworm, Strongyloides, Echinococcus, and Paragonimus) should all be considered in the differential diagnosis based on the location of the exposure and are summarized in Table 128-4. Work-up of hemoptysis should start with chest radiographs but may require CT scan or bronchoscopy with biopsies to make a definitive diagnosis. Again, informing the microbiology and pathology laboratories of the potential for fungal, mycobacterial, and parasitic disease will ensure that appropriate stains and cultures are performed.\n\nPatients presenting for medical attention in the tropics, or after returning from a trip to the tropics, not uncommonly (up to 5%) are found incidentally to have eosinophilia. 28 Although generally not considered to be clinically significant until reaching an absolute eosinophil count of greater than 1000, a relative increase in eosinophils on a complete blood count will often lead to pulmonary or infectious diseases consultation. The differential diagnosis and evaluation of eosinophilia is thoroughly reviewed in Chapter 125.\n\nEvaluation of patients with eosinophilia can be very difficult, especially in the absence of significant symptoms to help guide the assessment. A thorough account of both domestic and tropical travel must be included in the history as well as a detailed inquiry into use of prescription drugs, over-thecounter drugs, and supplements as the etiology may be a hypersensitivity reaction as opposed to an infection. There are a host of nonparasitic and even noninfectious etiologies that should be considered in the evaluation and these are considered in Chapter 125. Furthermore, multiple infections with a number of helminths from a shared exposure occur quite commonly. Stool, sputa, and serologic assays are frequently negative during the larval stages in the pulmonary vasculature.\n\nThe intestinal helminths most commonly associated with transmigration of their larvae through the lung leading to the eosinophilia, frequently referred to as Loeffler' s syndrome, are Ascaris, Strongyloides, and the hookworms Necator and Ancyclostoma. 29 Larvae penetrate into the alveolar spaces, are coughed into the mouth and then swallowed, thereby completing their journey to the intestinal tract where the adult stages live. Ascaris are most likely to be associated with development of significant pulmonary symptoms; hookworm and Strongyloides usually cause minimal inflammation during pulmonary transmigration. Loeffler' s syndrome occurs 10 to 12 days after ingestion of Ascaris eggs (or 5-10 days after penetration of hookworm or Strongyloides larva) and, if there are any symptoms, is characterized by development of 5 to 10 days of nonproductive cough, burning substernal chest pain, and, frequently, wheezing and rales. Chest radiograph reveals ill-defined, patchy, homogenous consolidation or, occasionally, a fine miliary pattern. Infiltrates may be unilateral or bilateral, have indefinite borders, and range from a few millimeters to 2 to 3 cm. 23 The migration of the larvae of Toxocara canis or T. cati in pulmonary tissues as a manifestation of visceral larva migrans (see Chapter 103) is associated with high levels of eosinophilia, and may be associated with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and transient reticulonodular infiltrates. 30 Schistosomes may be associated with eosinophilia and chest symptoms (see Chapter 116). Especially in nonimmune travelers, acute schistosomiasis (3-8 weeks after schistosome penetration) may be associated with headache, malaise, dyspnea, wheezing, and nonproductive cough, especially while recumbent in bed. These pulmonary symptoms may coincide with the fever (Katayama fever) associated with acute infection, but more commonly present a few weeks after resolution of fever and are associated with marked eosinophilia (approximately 30%-50%), mild to moderate leukocytosis, and liver enzyme abnormalities. 31 Since schistosomes pass through the lung shortly after penetration (5-7 days), the pulmonary symptoms are likely an immune effect triggered in the lung while the organism has become established elsewhere in the host, similar to established intestinal helminths that may also cause pulmonary infiltrates. 32 Chronic pulmonary disease is a complication of established schistosomal infections as ectopic migration of schistosome eggs occurs. This becomes more common in late disease as portal hypertension leads to portacaval shunts and deposition of eggs in the pulmonary vasculature. The granulomatous response to eggs in the pulmonary vessels leads to pulmonary hypertension and eventually cor pulmonale. Finally, some helminths (most importantly Paragonimus spp. and Echinococcus spp.) establish their adult stage in the lung and may be associated with years of waxing and waning eosinophilia 30 (see Chapters 114 and 117).\n\nThe etiologies for pleural effusion are protean and include a wide variety of infectious agents from bacterial and viral to protozoal and helminthic. Common noninfectious etiologies such as malignancies, heart or liver failure, collagen vascular diseases, and others predominate in temperate areas. The differential diagnosis of pleural effusion after exposure in the tropics is skewed due to the high prevalence of tuberculosis and HIV-associated disease and the increased incidence of helminthic, protozoal, and fungal infections. In one study from Zimbabwe of 100 consecutive patients with pleural effusion of unknown etiology, TB was ultimately determined as the final diagnosis in 58 of the patients after pleural biopsy was performed. 33 Temperate areas with a high incidence of tuberculosis may also have TB as a common cause of pleural effusion. For example, a large study of 642 pleural effusions in Spain (in an area with high incidence of TB-95 per 100,000) found TB responsible for 25%, neoplasia for 23%, and congestive heart failure for 18%. 34, 35 In areas with a low prevalence of TB, pleural effusions are rarely associated with tuberculosis and are much more commonly a sign of malignancy. Table 128-5 summarizes etiologic considerations for pleural effusion worldwide and in a patient with potential exposure in the tropics.\n\nEvaluation of pleural effusion should involve consideration of multiple aspects of the clinical setting. Bilateral pleural effusion in a patient with underlying heart disease returning from the tropics is still likely a pleural transudate related to heart failure. Presence of fever, pleuritic chest pain, and leukocytosis are obvious indicators of potential infectious etiologies and are indications that thoracentesis is indicated.\n\nIn addition to cell count, differential, pH, chemistries, Gram stain, and bacterial culture that are routinely obtained, additional consideration of mycobacterial or fungal disease should prompt appropriate stains and cultures. 36 If chest radiographs or the clinical scenario are consistent with possible TB, then a large volume of pleural fluid (at least 10 mL) should be centrifuged and the pellet examined with acid-fast (and fungal) stains and culture to increase the diagnostic yield. Adenosine deaminase levels in the pleural fluid, pleural biopsy, and tuberculin skin testing may also be considered.\n\nAn effusion with an eosinophilic pleocytosis at pleurocentesis appropriately prompts consideration of helminthic or other exotic etiologies. Although estimates are that 5% to 16% of pleural effusions are eosinophilic (more than 10% of nucleated cells are eosinophils), only a minority of eosinophilic effusions are due to infectious etiologies, and even fewer are due to helminths or protozoa. In most studies, blood or air in the pleural space is most commonly associated with eosinophilic pleural effusions, but malignancy, infection, pulmonary embolus, drug-induced, and asbestos-associated are all frequent. 37, 38 The etiology of eosinophilic pleural effusions is summarized in Table 128-6. 38, 39 Patients in or from the tropics presenting with eosinophilic pleural effusion (who do not have an identified etiology for the effusion) should also have a sputum examination and culture for fungi and mycobacteria. Sputa and stool should be examined for ova and parasites as well. Bronchoscopy and/or lung biopsy are considerations if the less invasive diagnostic evaluation is unrevealing. If biopsies are performed, it is important to consider evaluating tissue for fungi, mycobacteria, and parasitic etiologies in the microbiology and pathology labs.\n\nOf all the parasitic etiologies, Paragonimus spp. infections are the most likely to be associated with a significant eosinophilic pleural effusion. Asian studies have found approximately 50% of cases of paragonimiasis are associated with pleural effusions. 40, 41 Findings of pleural pH less than 7.1 and pleural fluid glucose less than 60 are characteristic. 38 Sputa exam with Paragonimus spp. ova will then confirm the diagnosis. Further information on Paragonimus spp. is included in Chapter 117. Despite aggressive evaluation, as many as one-third of eosinophilic pleural effusions remain undiagnosed, but the prognosis for these individuals even if the effusion has been prolonged has been shown to be excellent. There is some suggestion that asbestos-associated pleural effusion is the etiology in many of these undiagnosed cases. This may be even more common in the tropics where occupational exposures may be substantial and personal protective measures may be minimal; patients may not even be aware of their occupational exposure to asbestos.\n\nA discussion of pulmonary disease in the tropics cannot escape the overwhelming impact of tuberculosis on the lives of those in the developing world. Although TB is addressed in-depth in Chapter 36, the importance of including TB in the differential diagnosis of nearly all pulmonary complaints from the tropics cannot be overemphasized.\n\nApproximately 80% of the 8 million new TB cases in the world are from 20 countries, mostly in the developing world. In pediatrics the numbers are even more staggering, with 90% of the cases and 95% of the deaths from TB occurring in developing nations. 2, 14 Many of these same nations are also burdened with the highest HIV infection rates. As the two infections act synergistically to cause progression of each, the effects have been devastating, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (see Chapters 76 and 133).\n\nThe incidence of multidrug resistance has been a further, relatively recent complication of TB in the tropics. Inadequate treatment and follow-up has led to gradually increasing levels of drug resistance, thus requiring not only expensive sensitivity testing but also more expensive, and potentially more toxic, therapy.\n\nNumerous studies have documented the frequency of TB in those who have immigrated to developed nations from the tropics. Concerns about travelers visiting areas of high TB endemicity and potential exposures during air travel are frequently raised. The risk of acquiring TB infection among short-term travelers and on flights is actually quite low. 42 Despite commonly held misconceptions about aircraft air systems, the fairly rapid filtering of air released overhead and leaving the cabin near the floor close to the same row removes and dilutes most infectious particles. Despite hundreds of thousands of flights annually, transmission of TB on aircraft has rarely been reported. 42 In contrast to short-term travelers, those who remain in areas with a high prevalence of TB have rates of infection that approach that of the local population. This was seen most dramatically in long-term Dutch travelers to Africa, Asia, and Latin America, where their risk of infection increased from approximately 10 infections per 100,000 person-years to approximately 2000 infections per 100,000 person-years. Health-care workers with direct patient contact had more than threefold greater risk of TB than other travelers. 43 Obviously, in considering the possibility of tuberculosis in a returning traveler, a new immigrant or a patient in the tropics, it is critical to know the prevalence of TB in the nation of concern as well as contacts with TB, the living situation, and the activity of the individual evaluated. Chest trauma or thoracic medical procedure Presence of air or blood in the pleural cavity Pleural fluid is bloody or straw-colored Malignancy, either primary pulmonary or pleural or metastatic Increased eosinophils, even in nonbloody effusions Parapneumonic effusions Eosinophils appear a month or more after resolution of infiltrate Gram' s stain and culture are negative for bacteria Tuberculosis, either pleural TB or associated with Although eosinophils are rarely associated with TB the pulmonary infiltrates or nodule(s) frequency of pleural effusion due to TB is common in the tropics Endemic fungi such as coccidioidiomycosis, If living in or traveling from an endemic area histoplasmosis, cryptococcisis, penicilliosis Parasitic infections Travel to or living in endemic areas Paragonimiasis, ascariasis, strongyloidiasis, Pleural fluid exam reveals ova, larva or fragments echinococcosis, filariasis, loiasis, toxocariasis, Paragonimiasis is the most common parasitic etiology dracunculiasis, amebiasis, cutaneous myiasis (associated with pleural pH < 7.1 and glucose < 60 mg/dL) Medication associated\n\nUsually weeks to months after drug administration but Nitrofurantoin, isotretinoin, fluoxetine, warfarin, may be as short as hours or as long as years. dantrolene, glipizide, mesalamine, bromocriptine Pulmonary embolism 18% of pleural effusions are eosinophilic Pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea greater than would be expected with size of effusion Asbestosis or other pneumoconiosis History of occupational exposure, Pleural effusion is usually the sole radiographic abnormality Up to 50% of asbestos-associated effusions are eosinophilic Idiopathic\n\nMost commonly in middle-aged males with small to moderate, unilateral effusion. May be longstanding but associated with a good prognosis. Should prompt consideration of undiagnosed parasitic infections. There is little evidence to support the use of either routine bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunization prior to travel or tuberculin skin testing (TST) before and after. Again, consideration of the length of travel, the prevalence of TB in the area, and the activities planned by the individual may make either BCG immunization or TST reasonable recommendations for some individuals. 44, 45 Individuals who immigrate to developed nations have been documented in numerous studies to have a much higher incidence of TB disease than natives of developed nations. Over 50% of cases of TB in the United States and the United Kingdom occur in people born overseas, and the incidence of disease is more than 3 times greater in foreign-born than U.S.-born individuals. 46, 47 Approximately 25% of foreign TB cases diagnosed in the United States present within the first year of presentation. The incidence of active TB among political asylum seekers in London was 241 per 100,000, a level 20 times greater than the overall incidence in England. 48 Clearly individuals from developing nations who present with pulmonary complaints, especially chronic cough associated with hemoptysis, weight loss, and night sweats, should have TB considered as one of the more likely etiologies on a differential diagnosis and have chest radiography, possibly a TST, and sputa examination as part of the evaluation. In some cases, the index of suspicion may be so high that empiric therapy with four antituberculous drugs, preferably with directly observed therapy, should be instituted. Since the prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB is significantly higher in many developing nations, use of four drugs and mycobacterial sensitivity profiles should always be used. 49\n\nPlasmodium falciparum and, to a lesser extent, P. vivax have been associated with significant pulmonary involvement in only a minority of infected patients (see Chapter 90). In contrast to older literature that described \"bronchitic\" and \"pneumonitic\" malaria, there is no evidence that malarial infections are associated with a true pneumonitis. More recent studies have demonstrated the development of pulmonary edema during the treatment of falciparum malaria, especially more severe cases. Malaria-associated pulmonary edema is noncardiogenic (high cardiac index and low systemic vascular resistance) and is considered by most authorities to be consistent with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and related to the malaria-associated increase in pulmonary permeability. 50 While pulmonary edema occurs in less than 1% of all cases of falciparum malaria, it was found in 42% of a series of U.S. soldiers in the Second World War who died of severe malaria. 51 More recently, three of five Marines who returned from Liberia in 2003 with more than 10% falciparum parasitemia developed ventilatory failure and an ARDS-like presentation 48 to 72 hours after initiation of antimalarial treatment and clearance of parasitemia (unpublished personal data). Malaria-associated pulmonary disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of those returning from a malarious region with unexplained pulmonary edema.\n\nLike tuberculosis, the prevalence of HIV in many areas of the tropics, especially sub-Saharan Africa, make it an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary disease. HIV infection is fully addressed in Chapter 76 and HIV-associated opportunistic infections in Chapter 133.\n\nAs stated previously, TB coinfection is clearly the greatest threat to HIV-infected individuals in the tropics. The WHO reports rates of TB/HIV co-infection greater than 250 per 100,000 in a number of sub-Saharan nations. 52 Tuberculosis  11  4  7  10  3  3  7  9  54  CMV  32  5  2  1  2  0  0  1  43  Interstitial pneumonia  5  3  3  4  7  2  1  5  30  Shock lung  11  3  3  7  1  0  0  2  27  Pulmonary edema  4  2  3  1  2  3  2  2  19  Lymphocytic interstitial  2  0  2  5  0  0  0  1  10  pneumonitis  Measles  1  1  1  2  0  2  0  0 Although Pneumocystis jaroveci (formerly P. carinii) pneumonia (PCP) remains an important pathogen in HIV-associated pulmonary disease, it is not as common in the HIV-infected patients in the tropics as in temperate zones. However, in a study of African children dying from respiratory illness in Zambia, PCP was exceeded only by acute pyogenic pneumonia as the cause of death in children infected with HIV who were under a year old. CMV, TB, and interstitial lung disease were all common findings (Table 128-7) . 53 As described in Chapter 133, the etiology of HIV-associated pulmonary disease in the tropics includes all those seen in temperate areas but the variety of pathogens is more extensive. A few notable geographic considerations are the prevalence of Penicillium marneffei and melioidosis in Southeast Asia and Australia, paracoccidioidomycosis in South America, and blastomycosis in areas of Africa, South America, and Asia. These diseases are often erroneously attributed to TB, even in the areas where they are most common. With the frequency of multiple simultaneous pulmonary infections in HIV infection, even in those diagnosed with TB the possibility of additional diagnoses should be considered.\n\nEstimates are that a half billion of the world' s current population will be killed by tobacco, with increasing numbers of deaths in the developing world. 54, 55 It is estimated that the prevalence of male smoking exceeds 50% in many parts of Asia and Latin America. 54 Thus, a change in approach to the patient in the tropics with pulmonary complaints will need to occur as more tobacco-related diseases emerge.\n\nRheumatic heart disease (RHD) continues to be a very common heart problem in the developing world. Incidence rates of RHD as high as 206 per 100,000 and prevalence rates as high as 18.6 per 1000 are described. 56 Pulmonary complaints and fever in the tropics may represent acute rheumatic carditis or bacterial endocarditis complicating prior rheumatic heart damage. Fever, cough, hemoptysis, and shortness of breath may often lead to an incorrect diagnosis of a primary pulmonary infection. Pulmonary hypertension or congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema due to rheumatic heart damage is not uncommonly seen in impoverished countries, where secondary prophylaxis to prevent recurrent RHD episodes is difficult to administer and valve replacements are prohibitively expensive.\n\nDiscussion of pulmonary disease in the tropics cannot ignore the significant role of environmental exposures in acute and chronic lung disease. Poorly regulated working conditions in agriculture and mining have resulted in substantial burdens of occupationally related and environmental lung disease in many regions. 57 Although good prevalence data are lacking, it is likely that there are millions of cases of silicosis worldwide 58 and possibly comparable numbers of other lung disorders due to cotton dust (byssinosis), 59 extrinsic allergic alveolitis caused by microbial contamination of agricultural products such as sugar cane, and airway injury from indiscriminant use and poor control of indoor and outdoor air pollutants. 3, 60 There is a dramatic increase in both TB risk and virulence in populations with silicosis, and probably also people with exposure to silica without overt silicosis. In areas where large portions of the (male) population have been historically recruited into mining, as in southern Africa, this risk factor is very broadly disseminated and may account in part for the astronomical rates of TB in that region of the world. In a study of 304 men from Botswana who had been employed in South African mines for a mean of 15 years, 30% had pneumoconiosis and 6.8% had progressive massive fibrosis, and additionally 26% had a history of, or current, tuberculosis. 61 While adult males are the primary victims of occupational exposures, children and women face increased risk from indoor, nonoccupational exposures due to the use of dung and other biomass fuels for cooking and heating huts and homes. When combusted, these materials emit everything from silica and other minerals to hazardous air pollutants such as oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, resulting in various clinical problems, including silicosis (so-called hut lung in this setting), chronic bronchitis, asthma, and increased risk of respiratory tract infection. 4, 60 The most severely affected regions are those with colder climates, such as the sierra region of South America, the mountainous regions of central Asia, and the high plains of Africa. Ambient air pollution due to rapid urbanization has resulted in levels of ozone, oxides of nitrogen, and other irritants (photo-oxidant pollution) that are much higher than even in the worst cities in Europe and North America. Data from Latin America, India, and China suggest that very high rates of respiratory infection and asthma may be resulting. 3\n\nTo summarize, developing a differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with pulmonary complaints after exposure in the tropics requires clinicians to consider a range of infectious and noninfectious etiologies that is extraordinarily broad. Narrowing the differential is possible only with careful review of the exposure history and geographical areas coupled with knowledge of the available diagnostic resources and treatments."}
