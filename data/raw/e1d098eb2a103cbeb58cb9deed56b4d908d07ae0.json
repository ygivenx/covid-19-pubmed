{"title": "New prodrugs of two pyrimidine acyclic nucleoside phosphonates: Synthesis and antiviral activity", "body": "Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) are compounds of great importance due to the broad spectrum of biological activities, especially antiviral but also cytostatic, immunomodulatory and antiparasitic. [1] [2] [3] [4] Some of them have become already clinically available drugs: cidofovir for the treatment of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients, adefovir in a prodrug form as adefovir dipivoxil for the treatment of hepatitis B (HBV) and tenofovir, either as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or newly (since 2015) also as a new prodrug form tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) for the treatment of HIV and HBV infections. On the other hand, it should be noted that over the last thirty years of systematic investigation of ANPs, there are dozens of other therapeutically attractive structures synthesized but never advanced to the stage of preclinical/clinical investigations. 5 These structures are namely a) antiretroviral purine 3-fluoro-2-[(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] derivatives, 6 b) acyclic nucleoside phosphonates with 5-azacytosine base moiety, 7 c) 6-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)alkoxy]-2, 4-diaminopyrimidines (''open-ring'' derivatives) [8] [9] [10] and d) aza/deaza analogues of purine [(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl] derivatives. 11 The common structural attribute of all ANPs is their highly polar character caused by the presence of the phosphonic acid residue which is responsible for their unfavourable pharmacological properties: low cell permeability and low oral bioavailability. To overcome this problem, transformation of free acyclic nucleoside phosphonates to appropriate prodrugs is often a solution.\n\nIn our work, we focus on two pharmacologically interesting ANP structures: 2,4-diamino-6-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethoxy] pyrimidine -an example of the so-called ''open-ring\" ANPs and on the group of 5-azacytosine derivatives, namely 1-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]-5-azacytosine, and their antiviral potential in diverse prodrug forms.\n\nOpen-ring ANPs are characterized by the phosphonomethoxy group containing an aliphatic part linked to the position 6 of 2,4diaminopyrimidine via the oxygen atom. They are evidently mimics of the appropriate 2,6-diaminopurine derivatives with an open imidazole ring. Their antiviral activity is essentially identical to that of their parent compounds, including the enantiomeric specificity. Compounds as PMEO-DAPy, (R)-PMPO-DAPy and 5substituted PMEO-DAPy ( Fig. 1 ) are very efficient inhibitors of retroviruses [8] [9] [10] and HBV. Despite the number of antiretroviral drugs currently available on the market, further investigation of new structures is advisable for several reasons: 1) the risk of emergence of resistance, 2) none of the known drugs is able to eradicate HIV infection completely, 3) no vaccination are yet available, 4) early development of new drug candidates is necessary due to the longtime process lasting from in vitro laboratory testing to clinical phases and final approval. Moreover, there is an additional reason to focus on open-ring analogs of the PMEO-DAPy type: they are incorporated more efficiently than (R)-PMPA (tenofovir) by the K65R HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) mutant and they are not as efficiently excised as (R)-PMPA by the HIV-1 RT containing thymidine analog mutations. 12 Additionally, PMEO-DAPy is active not only against retroviruses but also against DNA viruses, especially herpesviruses, which often affect immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe development of 5-azacytosine ANPs was initiated in our laboratory in order to search for new demethylating (epigenetic) drugs similar to 5-azacytosine nucleosides. 13 Although none of the new compounds fulfilled this criterion, we managed to find a new class of antiviral agents, 5-azacytosine analogue of cidofovir 1-(S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-5azacytosine (HPMP-5-azaC) and various ester prodrugs derived from its cyclic form (Fig. 2) . 7, 14 Compared to cidofovir, HPMP-5-azaC has improved selectivity. The prodrug hexadecyloxyethyl ester of its cyclic form (HDE-cHPMP-5-azaC) revealed the most potent anti-DNA virus activities and also the highest selectivity indices (ratio activity vs toxicity) in the order of thousands, e.g. 1160 for herpes simplex virus (HSV) ! 5800 for varicella zoster virus (VZV) and !24,600 for HCMV. 14 The only disadvantage of HPMP-5-azaC is its complicated metabolic profile bound to instability of the 5-azacytosine ring in alkaline conditions including physiological pH. Studying the stability of various 5-azacytosine ANPs, we found much better stability for another 5-azacytosine derivative, i.e. 1-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]-5-azacytosine (PME-5-azaC). 15 Despite the fact that its antiviral activity was only marginal in the free phosphonic acid form 7 , we selected the compound for syntheses and further studies of its prodrug forms. We considered the fact that the activities of many ANPs were increased after transformation to appropriate prodrugs. Moreover, in some cases not only the activity was enhanced but also the spectrum of activity could be broaden by transformation to prodrugs. Typical examples are the anti-DNA viral agents 1-(S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (HPMPA) whose octadecyloxyethyl (ODE) ester is a potent and selective inhibitor of hepatitis C virus replication 16 or cidofovir transformed to its hexadecyloxyethyl ester (brincidofovir) whose efficacy is also enlarged to some RNA viral infections including Ebola virus. In fact, the lipid moiety of brincidofovir was found to be required for in vitro antiviral activity against Ebola virus. 17\n\nThe starting compound 2,4-diamino-6-[2-(phosphonomethoxy) ethoxy]pyrimidine (1) was synthesized according to a procedure described in the literature. 8 Briefly: base-catalysed alkylation of 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine with diisopropyl 2-(chloroethoxy)methylphosphonate gave a mixture of appropriate Oand N-diisopropyl (phosphonoethoxy)methyl derivatives where the N-isomer was separated and diisopropyl ester groups deprotected with bromotrimethylsilane. The synthesis of the prodrugs was rather complicated by a low solubility of the starting PMEO-DAPy; finally we managed to synthesize two biodegradable ester prodrugs -pivaloyloxymethyl (POM) and (isopropoxycarbonyl) oxymethyl (POC) esters and the amino acid phosphoramidate prodrug (Scheme 1). Pivaloyloxymethylation was performed by reaction of the starting phosphonic acid with chloromethyl pivalate using N,N 0 -dicyclohexyl-4-morpholinecarboxamidine as a base. The reaction proceeded very slowly to give a mixture of bis (POM) and mono(POM) esters 2 and 3. After chromatographic separation, both compounds were isolated in acceptable yields. Alternative reaction conditions (e.g. reaction in dioxane with DBU) completely failed. Also for the introduction of POC groups, different attempts have been examined (various solvents, DBU or diisopropylethylamine as bases). The only way that led to the bis (POC) derivative 4 consisted in transformation of free PMEO-DAPy to its tetrabutylammonium salt, followed by heating with POCchloride in dioxane. The bis(amino acid) phosphoramidate prodrug 5 was prepared by the direct coupling of PMEO-DAPy with ethyl Lalaninate in pyridine and treatment with a premixed solution of triphenylphosphine and 2,2 0 -dipyridyl disulfide (Aldrithiol).\n\nSynthetic efforts to obtain 1-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]-5azacytosine prodrugs were targeted to carbonyloxymethyl esters (POM, POC), alkoxyalkyl esters, amino acid phosphoramidates and tyrosine based prodrugs. The introduction of POC and POM groups has been performed by the action of appropriate alkyl chloride and N,N 0 -dicyclohexyl-4-morpholinecarboxamidine in dimethylformamide, i.e. conditions described for transformation of adefovir to adefovir dipivoxil 18 (Scheme 2). Unfortunately, and contrary to adefovir, reactivity and solubility of PME-5-azaC (6) was much lower giving the appropriate diesters 7 and 9 in modest yields only, accompanied by formation of monoesters. In pivaloyloxymethylation of PME-5-azaC, the mono-POM derivative 8 was even obtained as the main reaction product.\n\nThe amino acid phosphoramidates 12 and 13 were synthesized by the method developed by Jansa starting from the phosphonate dialkyl esters. 19 Diisopropyl or diethyl esters are formed as common intermediates in syntheses of all ANPs; their deprotection with bromotrimethylsilane leads to the bis(trimethylsilyl) esters in situ which are further hydrolysed to the final phosphonic acids. The principle of this method is the utilization of the intermediary bis(trimethylsilyl) ester of ANP directly for reaction with 2,2 0 dithiodipyridine, triphenylphosphine and amino acid ester to obtain bis-amidates without the need of laborious procedures to isolate the free phosphonic acids. The selection of amino acid esters is directed especially to diethyl esters of L-alanine or Lphenylalanine leading to prodrugs with optimal pharmacokinetic profile. 20 In our case, we selected the diethyl ester of L-phenylalanine (Scheme 3). Similarly as with the preparation of POM and POC esters, we obtained not only the desired symmetrical bis-amidate prodrug 12 but also mono-amidate 13 accompanied by a small amount of mono-methyl ester 14. Compound 14 was formed most probably during the chromatographic separation of the mono-amidate prodrug in a system containing high percentage of methanol.\n\nAnother type of prodrugs selected for our studies include alkoxyalkylesters. 21 The concept of these prodrugs is based on the mimicking of naturally occurring phospholipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). The compounds use the LPC natural uptake pathway in the small intestine to reach the target tissue and achieve oral bioavailability. The most important compound of this family is the hexadecyloxypropyl ester of cidofovir (brincidofovir, CMX-001), currently in Phase III clinical trials for use in humans against HCMV and adenovirus infections. This compound is also being investigated as an experimental drug against smallpox and ebolavirus infections. 22 In our previous studies, we have successfully applied the alkoxyalkylester approach to 9-(S)-[3hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-2,6-diaminopurine ((S)-HPMPDAP) 23 within the search for new bioavailable anti-poxvirus agents and for the synthesis of the above mentioned HDE-cHPMP-5-azaC (Fig. 2 ). 14 In our synthesis, the starting PME-azaC was transformed first to its tetrabutylammonium salt, which was subsequently treated with hexadecyloxypropyl bromide to give the mixture of diester and monoester (15, 17) . The monoester 17 is predominant most probably for steric reasons. Besides, small amounts of N 4 -alkylated product 16 were isolated (Scheme 4).\n\nThe last type of prodrugs included in this study are amino acid ester prodrugs where esterification of the phosphonic acid residue is performed via the free hydroxyl group of the appropriate hydroxy amino acid (serine, valine, tyrosine). This concept has been originally developed by McKenna's group to improve the oral bioavailability of (S)-HPMPC and (S)-HPMPA. 24, 25 Pharmacokinetic studies of various amino acid or dipeptide prodrugs of these ANPs finally revealed that the tyrosine single amino acid was the most favorable promoiety regarding prodrug plasma stability. It was also found that enzymatic stability of the tyrosine promoiety can be significantly increased by replacement of the carboxyl ester with an alkyl amide group. The highest increase in bioavailability and antiviral activity was observed when a long lipophilic alkyl chain was incorporated into the tyrosine amide group. A comprehensive review including synthesis, SAR studies and pharmacology of tyrosine N-alkyl amide ANP prodrugs has been published recently. 26 Considering these findings, we decided to synthesize the symmetrical bis-tyrosine prodrug 23 whose carboxylic function is modified by the hexadecylamido group (Scheme 5). The compound can be prepared via alkylation of the 5-azacytosine sodium salt with the whole aliphatic moiety, i.e. BOC protected bis(hexadecylamido-Ltyrosyl) ester of 2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl chloride (21) BOC groups. The tyrosine synthon 21 can be obtained by multistep synthesis from diisopropyl 2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl chloride (18) which is known as a common building block in the synthesis of diverse PME derivatives. 27 Isopropyl groups in 18 were removed first by the action of bromotrimethylsilane followed by hydrolysis. The intermediary phosphonic acid 19 was then activated by reaction with oxalyl chloride in DMF forming a phosphorodichlori-date 28 whose further reaction with BOC-protected hexadecyl tyrosine amide 20 in a presence of triethylamine formed diester 21 in good preparative yield. Tyrosine amide precursor 20 was prepared from N-BOC-L-tyrosine by standard coupling procedure using EDC and N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in CH 2 Cl 2 (similarly as described for other alkylated L-tyrosine amides, e.g. octyl or octadecyl). 26 \n\nAll the synthesized compounds were tested for their antiviral activities against: (a) human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), varicellazoster virus (VZV) wild type and thymidine kinase deficient (TK \u00c0 ) strains, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) wild type and TK \u00c0 strains, herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), vaccinia virus and vesicular stomatitis in human embryonic lung (HEL) cells; Coxsackie virus B4, and respiratory syncytial virus in human cervix carcinoma (HeLa) cells; parainfluenza-3 virus, reovirus, sindbis virus, coxsackie B-4 virus, and punta toro virus in green monkey kidney (VERO) cells, feline corona virus in feline kidney (CRFK) cells; and influenza A H1N1, influenza B H3N2, and influenza B viruses in canine kidney (MDCK) cells. While none of the synthesized compounds displayed activity against RNA viruses, several of them proved active against herpesviruses (Table 1) .\n\nAmong the synthesized PMEO-DAPy prodrugs, the bis(amino acid) phosphoramidate prodrug 5 emerged as the most active one against HSV, VZV and HCMV. The bis(POC) prodrug 4 was as active as compound 5 against HSV and VZV but proved less effective against HCMV. These prodrugs were 6-20-fold (HSV) and 3-16-fold (VZV) more active than the parental drug PMEO-DAPy and they gained activity against HCMV (EC 50 's of 17-29 mM and 86-90 mM for, respectively, compounds 5 and 4 versus >100 mM for compound 1). Together with an increase in antiviral potency, an augmentation of the CC 50 (50% cytostatic concentration) was seen for compounds 4 and 5 when compared to PMEO-DAPy. As a consequence, when calculating the selectivity index (SI, ratio: CC 50 /EC 50 ) for the prodrugs 4 and 5 against HCMV, no selectivity was seen (SI's 1). However, these two prodrugs selectively inhibited HSV and VZV replication with SI's of, respectively, 4-15 and 15-52, which was slightly better than the SI's for PMEO-DAPy, i.e. 1.7-4.5 (HSV) and 19-44 (VZV).\n\nPivaloyloxymethylation of PMEO-DAPy led to the synthesis of the bis(POM) and mono(POM) esters 2 and 3 but this strategy did not result in improvement of the anti-herpesvirus activity. Thus, the mono(POM) 3 prodrug had a potency and selectivity virtually identical to PMEO-DAPy while the bis(POM) 2 prodrug was 2 to 4.5-fold more active than PMEO-DAPy but 5.5-fold more cytostatic which resulted in decreased selectivity compared to the parental drug.\n\nAmong the carbonyloxymethyl esters (POM, POC) based prodrugs of PME-5-azaC, the bis(POM) compound 9 exhibited improved activity compared to the parent PME-5-azaC which had marginally activity against herpesviruses. The bis(POM) prodrug 9 inhibited the replication of HSV, VZV and HCMV with EC 50 0 s in the range of, respectively, 0.7-1. Amongst the alkoxyalkyl esters, the bis(octadecyloxytheyl) ester 15 and the N 4 -alkylated prodrug 16 were deprived of antiherpesvirus properties while the mono-octadecyloxyethyl ester 17 emerged as one of the most active prodrugs with EC 50 's of Table 1 Antiviral and cytotoxic properties of the synthesized compounds in human embryonic lung (HEL) cells. Compound The bis(POM) ester 9 was the only PME-5-azaC prodrug showing weak activity against vaccinia virus (EC 50 = 152 mM) although no selectivity was observed (Table 1) . Similarly, two PMEO-DAPy prodrugs [i.e. the bis(POC) ester 4 and the bis(amino acid) phosphoramidate prodrug 5] demonstrated very low anti-vaccinia virus activity without selectivity.\n\nWe have successfully synthesized carbonyloxymethyl esters (POM, POC), alkoxyalkyl esters, amino acid phosphoramidates and tyrosine based prodrugs of PMEO-DAPy and/or PME-5-azaC that had weak or marginal activity against herpesviruses. The mono-octadecyloxyethyl ester of PME-5-azaC emerged as the most potent and selective inhibitor of herpesviruses (i.e. HSV, VZV and HCMV). The bis(hexadecylamido-L-tyrosyl) and the bis(POM) esters of PME-5-azaC also had potent anti-herpesvirus activity but less selectivity that the mono-octadecyloxyethyl prodrug. The bis(POC) and bis(amino acid) phosphoramidate prodrugs of PMEO-DAPy proved more active than the parental drug against HSV, VZV and HCMV, showing selectivity for HSV and VZV but not for HCMV.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, solvents were evaporated at 40\u00b0C/2 kPa and compounds were dried at 13 Pa.

The antiviral, assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey cells (Vero), human epithelial cells (HeLa) or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) . Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (VZV) and further incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50%.\n\nThe cytostatic activity measurements were based on the inhibition of cell growth. HEL cells were seeded at a rate of 5 \u00c2 10 3 cells/ well into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to proliferate for 24 h. Then, medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After 3 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cell number was determined with a Coulter counter. The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC 50 , or the compound concentration required to reduce cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls. CC 50 values were estimated from graphic plots of the number of cells (percentage of control) as a function of the concentration of the test compounds. The selectivity index for each compound was calculated as the CC 50 /EC 50 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, cytotoxicity of the test compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology."}
