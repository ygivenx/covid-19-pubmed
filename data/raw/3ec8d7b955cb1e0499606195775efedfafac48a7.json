{"title": "Rhinovirus species and clinical characteristics in the first wheezing episode in children HHS Public Access", "body": "Rhinovirus (RV) -induced early wheezing has been recognised as an important risk factor for subsequent asthma , Lukkarinen et al., 2013 . It has also been associated with atopic characteristics and poor lung function both at acute phase and years later , Guilbert et al., 2011 , Malmstr\u00f6m et al., 2006 , Turunen et al., 2014 . The main explanations for these associations include pre-existing airway inflammation, bronchial epithelial damage, low interferon responses and genetic predisposition [Jakiela et al., 2008 , Baraldo et al., 2012 , Carroll et al., 2012 , Cal\u0131\u015fkan et al., 2013 , Contoli et al., 2015 , Bochkov et al, 2015 .\n\nRhinoviruses are genetically diverse RNA viruses belonging to the Enterovirus genus in the Picornaviridae family. Currently, over 160 different RV genotypes have been identified [Simmonds et al., 2010 , McIntyre et al., 2013 , Bochkov et al., 2014 . They are classified into A, B and C species. RV-A and RV-C seem to be the most common RV species in lower airways illness, wheezing and acute asthma, and cause more severe illnesses than RV-B in children [Arden et al., 2010 , Bizzintino et al., 2011 , Martin et al., 2015 , Fawkner-Corbett et al., 2016 . Also, one study has reported that atopy could worsen the RV-C induced illness outcome when children have acute wheezing [Cox et al., 2013] . Previous studies on RV genotypes have not focused on the first wheezing episode.\n\nConsidering new prevention strategies for asthma, it is crucial to identify high-risk children early, preferably already at the time of their first wheezing episode. Currently, RV is considered as a noticeable risk marker for later asthma development in children with severe early wheezing. We focused on the first wheezing episode in these children and aimed to investigate the RV genotype prevalence, sensitisation status of patients and clinical characteristics of infections caused by different RV species and other respiratory viruses than RV.\n\nThe Vinku2 trial was carried out in the Department of Pediatrics, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, from June 2007 to March 2009 (Vinku means \"wheeze\" in Finnish) [Turunen et al., 2014 , Jartti et al., 2015 . The inclusion criteria consisted of patient's age of 3 to 23 months, delivery at \u226536 gestational weeks, first wheezing episode (parental report and confirmation from medical records), and written informed consent from a parent or guardian. Main exclusion criteria consisted of chronic non-atopic illness and previous systemic or inhaled corticosteroid treatment. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Turku University Hospital. The study was commenced after obtaining written informed consent from a parent.\n\nAt study entry, the child was clinically examined, a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) for viral diagnostics was taken using a standardized procedure and a baseline blood sample was collected [Jartti et al., 2015 , Jartti et al., 2004 . The admission to the ward was decided independent of the study by a physician on duty. The guardian filled in a standard questionnaire on host and environmental risk factors for asthma (e.g. physician diagnosed eczema, parental history of allergic rhinitis, asthma and smoking) [Appendix 1, Online Supplementary]. The respiratory symptom score, need for bronchodilators, respiratory frequency, heart rate, supplemental oxygen and fever was recorded at study entry and daily at the ward as described previously [Turunen et al., 2014 , Jartti et al., 2006 . After discharge, respiratory symptoms (i. e. those including rhinitis, cough, and wheezing) were recorded daily for 2 weeks in a 4-grade scale (0-3) [Turunen et al, 2014, Appendix 3, Online Supplementary] .\n\nWheezing was defined as a high-pitched whistling sound in expiration with breathing difficulty. Atopy was defined as allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) level of >0.35 kU/L or more to any of the following common allergens: codfish, cow 's milk, egg, peanut, soybean, wheat, cat, dog, horse, birch, mugwort, timothy, Cladosporium herbarum and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Phadiatop Combi\u00ae, Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden) .\n\nAeroallergen sensitisation was defined as positive IgE antibodies to any of the latter 8 allergens. Perennial aeroallergen sensitisation was defined as positive IgE antibodies to the dog, cat or Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. The levels of IgE, blood eosinophil count, CRP and blood leukocyte count were analysed according to the routine diagnostics of the Central Laboratory, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland. The cut-off level of increased eosinophil count was \u22650.4 \u00d710 9 /L. The diagnosis of eczema was based on typical symptoms including pruritus, typical morphology and chronicity of illness, and it was defined as atopic if any sensitisation was found. The variable any atopic characteristics included atopy, eczema and/or elevated blood eosinophil count.\n\nVirus analyses were performed for all nasal samples taken. A sterile swab (nylon flocked dry swab, 520CS01, Copan, Brescia, Italy) was dipped into a nasopharyngeal aspirate and placed in a dry tube. The respiratory samples were refrigerated and analysed for RV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and enteroviruses (EV) by an \"in-house\" real-time PCR test within 3 days (4 times a week) [Jartti et al., 2015] . The samples were stored at \u221270 \u00b0C until analysed for other respiratory viruses. Multiplex-PCR (Seeplex RV12 ACE Detection; Seegene, Seoul, Korea) was used to detect RV, RSV, EV, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1-3, metapneumovirus (MPV), adenovirus (AdV), coronavirus (CV) 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1 and influenza A or B virus (Flu A or B) using manufacturer's instructions. Human bocavirus (HBoV) was analysed using PCR method and acute infections were serologically confirmed [S\u00f6derlund-Venermo et al., 2009] .\n\nThe partial VP4/VP2 and 5\u2032 non-coding region (NCR) of RV genome from RV positive samples were amplified and sequenced using four different primer pairs shown in Table S1 , Online Supplementary. The sequencing of 5\u2032 NCR was performed as previously described [Peltola et al., 2008] . The amplification and sequencing method for VP4/VP2 region is described in Online Supplementary [Bochkov et al. 2014 , Wisdom et al., 2009 , Linsuwanon et al., 2009 .\n\nThe PCR products of VP4/VP2 were purified using Exonuclease I (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and the products of 5\u2032 NCR using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). The sequencing of VP4/VP2 was carried out at GATC Biotech AG, Konstanz, Germany and of 5\u2032 NCR at the Turku Centre for Biotechnology's sequencing services, Turku, Finland. The sequences were edited from chromatograms using FinchTV \u00ae (FinchTV 1.5.0, Geospiza, Inc. Seattle, WA, USA). The edited VP4/VP2 and 5\u2032 NCR sequences were analysed by multiple sequence alignment CLUSTALW2 method in SeaView editor [Gouy et al., 2010] . Phylogenetic trees were constructed and visualized using the neighbor-joining method and Kimura's two-parameter model with 1000 bootstrapping value implemented in the MEGA5.5 \u00ae version 5.0 program [Tamura et al., 2011] . Rhinovirus species were assigned by comparing each RV strains with all of the available RV reference sequences encoding either VP4/VP2 region or 5\u2032 NCR in BLAST program available in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.gov/BLAST). The type assignment was based on the \u226596% identity of sequences when analysed from 5\u2032 NCR and \u226590% from VP4/VP2 region in BLAST [Miller and Mackay 2013] . All the strains were further aligned in BLAST by pairwise method to determine their similarity. The sequence identity of \u226598% was considered to represent the same RV type [Peltola et a., 2008] .\n\nStatistical power calculation was carried out for the randomized trial but not specifically for the current analysis [Jartti et al., 2015] . As children having a RV infection were randomized to receive either prednisolone or placebo, prednisolone recipients were censored from the analysis at the time of the initiation of the drug [Jartti et al., 2015] . Because our type assignments based on 5\u2032 NCR were mainly equivalent to those based on VP4/VP2 region, genotyping results were merged and processed as equal for statistical analysis. The normality of the data distribution was tested using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Children infected with non-typeable RV species (n = 17) and RV-B (n = 1) were excluded from the statistical analysis. Children with other respiratory virus than RV caused infection were referred as non-RV. For comparisons of patient characteristics and illness severity variables between RV-A, RV-C and non-RV infections, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskall-Wallis test were used for countinous variables and Pearson's chi square test or Fischer exact test (when count <5) were used for categorical variables. For continuous variables, pairwise comparisons were tested using Bonferroni corrections for skewed data or Tukey's test for normal distributed data. Normally distributed variables are expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD) and non-normally distributed variables as median and interquartile range (IQR). Results were considered statistically significant at the level of p < 0.05. Data was analysed using SPSS software (Version 23, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill, USA).\n\nOf 125 consecutive eligible children, 111 (89%) were enrolled in the study and included in the analysis ( Figure S1 , Online Supplementary). Of them, 84 (76%) children had a RV infection and other respiratory viruses (non-RV) were detected from 27 (24%) patients. The total viral etiology at the study entry was previously described [Turunen et al., 2014] . One or more viruses were detected in the nasopharynx of all of the study children (111/111; 100%). The most common agent was rhinovirus (76%), followed by RSV (28%), HBoV (PCR or serodiagnosis, 18%), and other viruses (<10% each). Single virus infections were found in 62% of the samples (n = 69), of which rhinovirus was the most common causative agent (n = 50, 72%), followed by RSV (n = 11, 16%).\n\nIn order to obtain the maximal sensitivity of viral genome detection and accuracy of RV typing, the PCR and sequencing were carried out from both partial 5\u2032 NCR and VP4/VP2 region of the RV genome. Of the 84 RV positive samples, 75% (63/84) were successfully genotyped using the 5\u2032 NCR specific primers and 40% (34/84) were successfully genotyped with VP4/VP2 specific primers. A total of 33 RV isolates (52%) genotyped by 5\u2032 NCR assay were not amplified with primers targeting VP4/VP2 region. RV-C was the most common species detected in 73% (46/63) of the samples using 5\u2032 NCR specific primers. RV-A isolates were detected in 25% (16/63) and RV-B in 1.6% (1/63) of the samples, respectively. In order to confirm 5\u2032 NCR based sequencing results and to verify RV-C species and type assignments, the sequencing of partial VP4/VP2 was also performed. Of those 34 RV positive samples, 88% (30/34) represented RV-C, 8.8% (3/34) RV-A, and 2.9% (1/34) RV-B. Most of the type assignments (93%) were congruent between the sequences obtained from both 5\u2032NCR and VP4/VP2 region (n = 30). Two sequences matching RV-A101 type inVP4/VP2 region and RV-C23 or RV-C16 types in 5\u2032 NCR suggest either putative recombination or presence of two different RV types in the same sample. Of the 34 isolates genotyped from the VP4/VP2 region, sequencing of 5\u2032 NCR products was unsuccessful from 4 samples. Altogether, 58% (49/84) of the genotyped clinical isolates were indentified as RV-C, 20% (17/84) as RV-A, and 1.2% (1/84) as RV-B while 20% (17/84) remained non-typeable. Of them, 11 could not be typed most probably due to low sensitivity of the primers used in sequencing reactions and 6 cases due to poor quality of the amplicons.\n\nA total of 67 different clinical RV isolates representing 37 different genotypes were identified. Of them, 11 belonged to RV-A and one to RV-B. The remaining 25 types belonged to RV-C of which none was predominant (Figure 1 , Online Supplementary Figure  S2 -S4). The detected clinical isolates used for type assignment are shown in Online Supplementary (Online Supplementary Table S2 ). For statistical reasons the single RV-B isolate was excluded from the clinical analyses.\n\nSimultaneously with RVs, another respiratory virus was detected in 38% of the samples (34/84) ( Table 1 ). The prevalence of co-infections including respiratory viruses other than RV has previously been described [Turunen et al., 2014] . A total of 44% of patients with RV-C (15/34) had co-infections. Co-infections also occurred in 21% (7/34) of samples with RV-A, and in 1.2% (1/34) with RV-B. Another virus was also found in 32% (n = 11) of nontypeable samples. RV-C in combination with HBoV was the most commonly detected (5/15, 33%). Coinfection status had no influence on clinical analyses (Online Supplementary, Table  S3 ). RV-C species circulated throughout the year, mostly in fall. RV-A species were evenly present year around and non-typeable RVs peaked during winter season (Figure 2 ). RV-B was present in fall.\n\nChildren with RV-A (13 months [SD 6.1]) and RV-C (13 months [SD 6.3]) induced wheezing were older than those with non-RV wheezing (9.0 months [SD 5.1]) (p = 0.014, Table 2 ). The prevalence of atopic characteristics was differentially distributed between children with RV-A, RV-C and non-RV infections (p = 0.001). Food allergen sensitization was most significantly distributed (p = 0.029): RV-A 47%, RV-C 23% and non-RV 12%. Aeroallergen sensitization was only seen in RV-C and RV-A (18% and 17%; p = 0.049). Parental allergic rhinitis also differed significantly between RV-A, RV-C and non-RV: RV-A 82%, RV-C 63% and non-RV 41% (p = 0.019). Furthermore, maternal allergic rhinitis differed significantly, respectively: RV-A 53%, RV-C 45% and non-RV 19% (p = 0.032). Paternal smoking was more common in children with RV-A or RV-C infection than with non-RV infection (p = 0.037) ( Table 2) . Also, the seasonality and day care were differentially distributed between RV-A, RV-C and non-RV (p = 0.008 and p = 0.036) ( Table  2 ). In a subgroup analysis of only hospitalized patients, additionally male sex differed significantly between children with RV-A, RV-C and non-RV infection: RV-A 56%, RV-C 86% and non-RV 52% (p = 0.010) (Table S4 , Online Supplementary). Moreover, there was no difference in distribution of food sensitization, however, perennial sensitization occurred only in RV-A and RV-C group (p = 0.042). Also, maternal and parental asthma were differentially distributed occurring only in hospitalized children with RV-A and RV-C (p < 0.05) (Table S4 , Online Supplementary).\n\nDetails between illness severity and RV-A, RV-C and non-RV are shown in Table 4 . The blood eosinophil count was significantly higher in children with RV-A and RV-C infection than in those with non-RV (p < 0.001) ( Table 3 ). The median duration of wheezing before the recruitment was differentially distributed between RV species (p = 0.040). The median duration of wheezing were 2 days (IQR 1, 3) for non-RV, 1 day (IQR 1, 2) for RV-A and 1 day (IQR 1, 2) for RV-C (Table 3) . Also, the median duration of fever was longest for non-RV (1 day [IQR 1, 3]), followed by RV-A (1 day [IQR 0, 2]) and RV-C (1 day [IQR 1, 0]) (p = 0.030). The use of bronchodilator was differentially distributed between RV-A, RV-C and non-RV: RV-A 94%, RV-C 87% and non-RV 63% (p = 0.012). The duration of cough before the recruitment tended to differ between RV-A, RV-C and non-RV (p = 0.064) ( Table 3 ). In a subgroup analysis of hospitalized children, no other significant differences were found in illness severity between children with RV-A, RV-C and non-RV infection (Table S4 , Online Supplementary). The presence of atopy showed a tendency for prolonged wheezing (all p = 0.073), especially in RV-A infected children (p = 0.053). Otherwise, atopy showed no influence on illness severity variable (Table S6 , Online Supplementary). There was neither difference in illness severity between only RV-A and RV-C (data not shown).\n\nOur study showed that RV-C was the most common pathogen in the first wheezing episodes most of which necessitated hospitalization, followed by RV-A. RV-B seems to remain rare in severe wheezing episodes. Interestingly, children with RV-A and RV-C induced first wheezing episodes were associated with atopy, more rapid onset of illness and greater illness severity than those with wheezing induced by other respiratory viruses.\n\nThe prevalence of RV-C genotypes was 58%, which is in line with previous studies on prevalence of RV species in children with acute wheezing, asthma or lower respiratory infection (26% to 68%) [Bizzintino et al., 2011 , Cox et al., 2013 , Linsuwanon et al., 2009 , Lauinger et al., 2013 . However, there are no studies on the prevalence of RV species in the first wheezing episode in hospitalized children. In lower airway illnesses, the RV-A detection rate has varied from 22% to 60% [Martin et al., 2015 . Nonetheless, in our study RV-A genotypes were detected in 20% of the first time wheezing children. Only one RV-B strain was found, which supports the earlier findings that RV-B is less common in respiratory tract infections and acute wheezing .\n\nOf 84 RV positive samples, 20% of RVs could not be sequenced and typed with either set of primers due to the following reasons. In a few samples the PCR product was not specific for RV (false-positive samples). Notably, viral genome copy number was low in most of the non-typeable samples so this might affect the results of repeated PCR amplification (data not shown). It has been shown that sequencing primers targeting VP4/VP2 region are less sensitive than the 5\u2032NCR primers used in the primary diagnostic PCR [Bochkov et al., 2014 , Wisdom et al., 2009 , Simmonds et al., 2010 . Moreover, the sequencing may have been unsuccessful due to presence of multiple RV strains in the same sample. A low number of viral genomes in the samples may represent an antecedent infection. However, the rate of non-typeable RVs is in agreement with previous studies, in which their prevalence has varied from <2% to 30% when using partial sequencing of 5\u2032 NCR and VP4/VP2 region [Bochkov et al., 2014 , Linder et al., 2013 , Principi et al., 2015 , M\u00fcller et al., 2015 . Since non-typeable RVs could represent a heterogeneous group that included all three RV species, they were not used for statistical comparisons.\n\nDuring our study period, 33 different RV genotypes were identified over a 21 months period of time indicating circulation of multiple RV types (Table S2 , Online Supplementary). Earlier studies have shown that various RV types (from 20 to 30) can circulate simultaneously , Iwane et al., 2011 . However, the overall data on the genotype distribution in the community during the study period is not known. It is also known that children have frequent RV infections caused by different virus strains in a year , Principi et al., 2015 . The diversity observed among RV-C (n = 21 types) was greater than that seen among RV-A (n = 11), which is consistent with other studies focusing on children <5 years of age with acute respiratory illnesses (Figure 1 , Online Supplementary Figure S2-S4) ]. In agreement with previous studies, RV-C peaked especially in fall and spring whereas RV-A was present equally throughout the year .\n\nWe showed RV co-infections with other respiratory viruses in 40% of the first-time wheezing children which is in line with earlier reports (10% to 50%) [Bizzintino et al., 2011 , Fawkner-Corbett et al., 2016 , Cox et al., 2013 . In contrast to previous studies showing more co-infections in RV-A cases Fawkner-Corbett et al., 2016] , we found more of them in RV-C cases, which is in agreement with the study of Bizzintino et al [Bizzintino et al., 2011,] . The exact mechanism of higher rates of co-infection associated with RV-A vs RV-C species is currently unknown. Perhaps different viral pathogenesis, for example, lower interferon responses and increased epithelial permeability, in RV-C vs RV-A infection might predispose to co-infections with other viruses and bacteria [Baraldo et al., 2012 , Jakiela et al., 2008 , Contoli et al., 2015 . Besides, the overall prevalence of RV-C isolates in our study samples could also affect the results of co-infection analysis. Our finding also strengthens the role of respiratory viruses, especially RV, in wheezing illnesses [Jackson et al., 2008 , Jartti et al., 2004 . RV is shown to be a strong predictor for recurrent wheezing episodes, and together with allergic sensitization the risk for developing asthma is further increased [Jackson et al., 2008 , Lukkarinen et al., 2013 .\n\nEarlier publications have shown that children with RV-A or RV-C infection had increased risk for wheezing when being sensitised to dust mite, and that atopic sensitisation might increase the risk for hospitalization in children with RV-C induced lower airway illnesses [Cox et al., 2013 , Soto-Quiros et al., 2012 . Our study adds to previous reports that atopy is especially common in young children with first wheezing episode caused by RV-A or RV-C rather than by other respiratory virus infection [Lukkarinen et al., 2013 , Turunen et al., 2014 , Cox et al., 2013 , Soto-Quiros et al., 2012 . Furthermore, our finding may indicate that children who are sensitized to many environmental factors are more prone to be infected by RV-A or RV-C than by other respiratory viruses. Our results also add to previous findings, that blood eosinophilia is associated especially with RV-A or RV-C induced early wheezing [Midulla et al., 2010] . Maternal atopy has been associated with RV induced lower airway illnesses in young children; yet, no association with specific RV species has been found either in a one previous study or in our study . However, in a subgroup analysis, hospitalized children with RV-A and RV-C infection were associated with parental and maternal asthma when compared to those with non-RV infection. An earlier study has shown that RV induced wheezing in children is associated with male sex [Turunen et al., 2014] . This finding is supported by our subgroup analysis of hospitalized patients when children with RV-A and RV-C infections were more associated with male sex than those with non-RV infections. This might also indicate that boys are having a more severe illness than girls.\n\nEarlier studies have found RV-A and RV-C to cause more clinically severe lower airway illnesses than RV-B species and in general RV to cause more aggressive illness than RSV [Arden et al., 2010 , Bizzintino et al., 2014 , Fawkner-Corbett et al., 2016 , Martin et al., 2015 , Cox et al., 2013 . This adds to the previous findings that rapid onset of RV illness is essentially prevailing in children with RV-A and RV-C induced wheezing . The association with the use of bronchodilator in our study also supports the more severe illness in RV-A and RV-C infected children than in non-RV. On the contrary, our findings are in agreement with three recent studies reported that there is no significant difference in the illness severity between only RV-A and RV-C infected children [Fawkner-Corbett et al., 2016 , M\u00fcller et al., 2015 . Furthermore, neither in our study nor in one previous study did co-infection status influence the illness severity; however, the sample size was small in our study [Fawkner-Corbett et al., 2016] . Severe wheezing in association with RV-A and RV-C infections might be explained by impaired antiviral responses and reduced epithelial barrier function [Baraldo et al., 2012 , Jakiela et al., 2008 , Contoli et al., 2015 . RV has shown to be a strong risk factor for recurrent wheezing regardless of whether being detected alone or with other viruses [Jackson et al., 2008 , Bergroth et al., 2016 , Hasegawa et al., 2014 . However, the role of RV coinfections causing recurrent wheezing needs further studies.\n\nThe strengths of the study include the focus on the first wheezing episode, consecutive patients, prospective design and detailed clinical data. For RV typing, we used specific primers from both partial 5\u2032 NCR and VP4/VP2 region of the viral genome. Typing of VP4/VP2 is known to be more definitive for RV species and type differentiation. However, it is generally known that 5\u2032 NCR primers are more sensitive for RV PCR amplification than primers targeting VP4/VP2 region [Bochkov et al., 2014 , Wisdom et al., 2009 , Simmonds et al., 2010 . In our study, the genotyping results from the VP4/VP2 region were similar in 93% of samples when compared to those from the 5\u2032 NCR; however, sequences from both regions were obtained only in 30 samples. RV-C was the most common species based on both 5\u2032 NCR and VP4/VP2 region sequencing. RV-C types were also phylogenetically grouped with RV-C isolates derived from GenBank [McIntyre et al., 2013 , Simmonds et al., 2010 . One of the limitations of our study is that the size of study population was relatively small and mostly represented hospitalized patients.\n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates the role of RV-C being the most common RV species in the first wheezing episodes in hospitalized children. Atopic and illness severity features are associated with children having RV-A or RV-C rather than non-RV induced first wheezing episode. Further studies are warranted on the pathogenesis and preventive strategies for RV-induced early wheezing. Understanding the connection between atopic status and wheezing induced by RV species is clinically important when evaluating subsequent risk of asthma.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
