{"title": "Effective one-pot multienzyme (OPME) synthesis of monotreme milk oligosaccharides and other sialosides containing a 4-O- acetyl sialic acid \u2020 HHS Public Access Author manuscript", "body": "Sialic acids commonly presented as the terminal residues on mammalian oligosaccharides or glycoconjugates are key recognition components of bacterial adhesins, viral surface proteins, selectins, Siglecs, and other sialic acid-binding proteins involved in infection, inflammation, cancer metastasis, and immunoregulation. 1-4 Sialic acids present tremendous structural diversity in nature and more than 50 members have been identified so far. These include Nacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), the non-human sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid 5 Neu4,5Ac 2 (1) has been found in horse, 6 donkey, 7 Australian monotreme Echidna, 5, 8 Japanese dace, 9 South American pit viper, 10 rabbit, 11 guineapig. 6 Neu4,5Ac 2 -containing oligosaccharides have been found to be the dominant components of the acidic milk oligosaccharides (MOSs) of monotremes echidnas and platypus. [12] [13] [14] Both Neu4,5Ac 2 and Neu4Ac5Gc have been found in horse glycoproteins. 5 The presence of Neu4Ac5Gc-GM3 ganglioside in human colon cancer tissues was detected using purified antibodies. 15 Neu4Ac5Gc (2) has also been found in \u03b12-8-linked polysialic acids of glycoproteins from unfertilized kokanee salmon egg 16 and in the serum of guinea pig in trace amounts. 17 4-O-Acetylation of sialic acids provides resistance or decreased sensitivity of sialosides to various sialidases. 6, 18, 19 This property is believed to contribute to the inhibitory activity of Neu4,5Ac 2 -rich horse and guinea pig \u03b1 2 -macroglobulins against hemagglutination and infectivity of several human influenza viruses. 6, 18, 19 On the other hand, Neu4,5Ac 2 is selectively recognized by the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) 20, 21 of mouse hepatitis virus strain S (MHV-S), a type of murine coronavirus, and infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV). 22 Nevertheless, the significance of naturally existing 4-O-acetylated sialic acids is not well understood partly due to the lack of access to sufficient amounts of the corresponding sialosides.\n\nTo our knowledge, the synthesis of sialosides containing 4-O-aceylated sialic acids by either chemical or enzymatic methods has not been reported. Here we present a facile chemoenzymatic approach for preparative and gram-scale synthesis of monotreme milk oligosaccharides including Neu4,5Ac 2 -containing \u03b12-3-linked sialyl lactose (Neu4,5Ac 2 \u03b13Lac) and sialyl lacto-N-neotetraose (Neu4,5Ac 2 \u03b13LNnT). Other Neu4,5Ac 2or Neu4Ac5Gc-containing \u03b12-3-linked sialosides representating common terminal sialosides in mammals are also synthesized.\n\nWe envisioned that the desired 4-O-acetyl-sialic acid-containing sialosides could be chemoenzymatically synthesized using an effective one-pot two-enzyme sialylation system containing a cytidine 5\u2032-monophosphate-sialic acid (CMP-Sia) synthetase (CSS) and a sialyltransferase (ST). 23 To test the feasibility, the corresponding 4-O-acetyl-sialic acids were chemically synthesized. As shown in Scheme 1, Neu4,5Ac 2 (1) was synthesized from N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, 3) by esterification of the C1-carboxyl group with benzyl bromide to provide benzyl ester 4 with a 90% yield. Protection of 4 at C8 and C9 by adding 2,2-dimethoxypropane in the presence of a catalytical amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid produced partially protected 5 in an excellent 92% yield. Regioselectively acetylation of 5 at O-4 using acetic anhydride in pyridine at room temperature provided the key intermediated 6 in a 81% yield. Final deprotection of the O-isopropylidene group in 6 by treating with 80% acetic acid and removal of the benzyl ester group by catalytic hydrogenolysis with H 2 in the presence of Pd/C in methanol resulted in Neu4,5Ac 2 (1) in a 82% yield. The obtained product has a proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) spectrum consistent with that reported. 24 The 4-O-acetyl modification caused a downfield shift of Neu5Ac H-4 signal.\n\nNeu4Ac5Gc (2) was chemoenzymatically synthesized from D-mannosamine hydrochloride (ManNH 2 \u00b7HCl, 7). As shown in Scheme 2, N-(2-Benzyloxyacetyl)-D-mannosamine 8 was obtained by treating ManNH 2 \u00b7HCl (7) with 2-benzyloxyacetyl chloride in the presence of NaHCO 3 in CH 3 CN and water. P. multocida sialic acid aldolase (PmNanA) 25 -catalyzed aldol reaction of 8 with sodium pyruvate at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h produced the corresponding sialic acid derivative 9 in an excellent quantitative yield. The introduction of 4-O-acetyl group was carried out similarly to that described above for the synthesis of Neu4,5Ac 2 (1). Briefly, benzylation of 9 with benzyl bromide formed benzyl ester 10 in a 90% yield. Treating 10 with 2,2-dimethoxypropane produced 8,9-isopropylidene-protected 11 in a 96% yield. Selective acetylation of 11 with Ac 2 O and pyridine produced the corresponding 4-O-acetyl derivative 12 in a good yield (81%). Subsequent removal of the isopropylidene group using HOAc/H 2 O followed by debenzylation using catalytic hydrogenation produced the target Neu4Ac5Gc (2) in a 78% yield.\n\nSialyltransferase-catalyzed reactions use CMP-sialic acids which can be potentially accessed by a suitable CMP-Sia synthetase (CSS, EC 2.7.7.43). The tolerance of using Neu4,5Ac 2 (1) as a potential substrate was tested for several bacterial CSSs including those from Neisseria meningitidis (NmCSS), 26 Pasteurella multocida (PmCSS), Haemophilus ducreyi (HdCSS), as well as two NmCSS mutants (NmCSS_S81R and NmCSS_Q163A). 27 Small-scale reactions carried out in Tris-HCl buffer (100 mM, pH 7.1) at 37 \u00b0C for 15 h followed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) analyses indicated that all CSSs tested could use Neu4,5Ac 2 (1) efficiently (Fig. S1 , \u2020ESI). These results were quite exciting as a previous report showed that CSSs purified from calf brain, bovine, and equine submaxillary glands could not use Neu4,5Ac 2 (1) as a substrate for the synthesis of the corresponding CMP-sialic acid. 28 NmCSS was chosen for further studies and for preparative-scale and gram-scale syntheses.\n\nA coupled enzymatic assay was used to evaluate several bacterial sialyltransferases in using CMP-Neu4,5Ac 2 and CMP-Neu4Ac5Gc synthesized in situ by NmCSS from Neu4,5Ac 2 (1) and Neu4Ac5Gc (2), respectively, as potential donor substrates. Sialyltransferases tested include \u03b12-3-sialyltransferases from Pasteurella multocida (PmST1, 29 PmST2, 30 PmST3 31 ) and PmST1_M144D mutant; 32 \u03b12-6-sialyltransferases Pd26ST 33 and Psp26ST; 34 as well as \u03b12-3/8-sialyltransferase CstII. 35, 36 Among these sialyltransferases, only PmST3 showed good activity as shown by TLC and MS studies. PmST3 was previously characterized as a monofunctional \u03b12-3-sialyltransferase encoded by Pm1174 gene in Pasteurella multocida strain Pm70. It had broad acceptor substrate specificity and could use oligosaccharides, glycolipids, and glycopeptides as acceptors. 31, 37 PmST3 could use oligosaccharides containing a terminal \u03b21-4-or \u03b21-3-llinked galactose as acceptors, but had poor activity on using galactosides containing a monosaccharide unit as acceptors. It could not use fucosylated oligosaccharides, such as Le x , as acceptor substrates. It was delightful to identify the unique efficiency of PmST3, among various bacterial sialyltransferases, in catalyzing the synthesis of sialosides containing 4-O-acetyl sialic acid.\n\nNmCSS and PmST3 were used in an efficient one-pot two-enzyme (OP2E) sialylation system 23, 38 (Scheme 3) for preparative-scale synthesis of target sialosides. To minimize loss of the 4-O-acetyl group, enzymatic reactions were carried out at 37 \u00b0C in a Tris-HCl buffer (100 mM, pH 7.1) containing NmCSS, PmST3, Mg 2+ , cytidine 5\u2032-triphosphate (CTP), Neu4,5Ac 2 or Neu4Ac5Gc, and a galactoside acceptor. Monotreme milk oligosaccharides Neu4,5Ac 2 \u03b13Lac (24) and Neu4,5Ac 2 \u03b13LNnT (25) were readily produced from lactose (Gal\u03b24Glc or Lac, 13) and previously synthesized lacto-N-neotetraose (Gal\u03b24GlcNAc\u03b23Gal\u03b24Glc or LNnT, 14) 39 in 82% and 78% yields, respectively (Table 1) . Neu4,5Ac 2 \u03b13LNT (26) was also synthesized from commercially available lacto-N-tetraose (Gal\u03b23GlcNAc\u03b23Gal\u03b24Glc or LNT, 15) in a 65% yield. Gal\u03b2pNP (16) with a monosaccharide unit was a less efficient acceptor and Neu4,5Ac 2 \u03b13Gal\u03b2pNP (27) was obtained in a 31% yield (the yield could not be improved further by adding more enzymes). Other \u03b12-3-linked sialylated disaccharides containing a propyl azide aglycone (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) were also successfully synthesized from the corresponding disaccharides 29, 40, 41 17-22 in 74-88% yields. To demonstrate the efficiency of the OP2E system, monotreme milk trisaccharide Neu4,5Ac 2 \u03b13Lac (24) was further synthesized in a gram scale (1.33 g) with a 71% yield.\n\nA longer propyl azide-containing oligosaccharide Gal\u03b24GlcNAc\u03b23Gal\u03b24Glc\u03b2ProN 3 or LNnT\u03b2ProN 3 (23) was synthesized from Lac\u03b2ProN 3 (17) using a sequential two-step onepot multienzyme (OPME) 38 process (Scheme 4) similar to that reported previously for LNnT. 39 Briefly, Lc 3 trisaccharide GlcNAc\u03b23Gal\u03b24Glc\u03b2ProN 3 42 was synthesized from Lac\u03b2ProN 3 (17) and GlcNAc in a 94% yield using a one-pot four-enzyme (OP4E) GlcNAc activation and transfer system containing Bifidobacterium longum N-acetylhexosamine-1kinase (BLNahK, NahK_ATCC55813), 43 Pasteurella multocida N-acetylglucosamine uridyltransferase (PmGlmU), 44 Pasteurella multocida inorganic pyrophosphatase (PmPpA), 40 and Neisseria meningitidis \u03b21-3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (NmLgtA). [45] [46] [47] LNnT\u03b2ProN 3 (23) 42 was then produced from Lc 3 and galactose in an excellent (99%) yield using a OP4E galactosylation system 37, 39 containing Escherichia coli galactokinase (EcGalK), 48 Bifidobacterium longum UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase (BLUSP), 49 PmPpA, 40 and Neisseria meningitidis \u03b21-4-galactosyltransferase (NmLgtB). 40, 47 Synthesis of Neu4,5Ac 2 \u03b13LNnT\u03b2ProN 3 (34) from LNnT\u03b2ProN 3 (23) and Neu4,5Ac 2 (1) was successfully achieved in a good 81% yield using NmCSS and PmST3 in one-pot (Scheme 3).\n\nAlthough less efficient compared to the synthesis of their Neu4,5Ac 2 -containing matching pairs, Neu4Ac5Gc-containing \u03b12-3-linked sialosides with a propyl azide aglycone (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) were successfully obtained from Neu4Ac5Gc (2) and the corresponding disaccharides (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) or tetrasaccharide (23) in 51-71% yields using the OP2E sialylation reaction (Scheme 3). This indicated that CMP-Neu4,5Ac 2 generated in situ is a better donor substrate than in situ generated CMP-Neu4Ac5Gc for PmST3. Longer reaction time needed for the synthesis of Neu4Ac5Gc-containing compounds also led to de-O-acetylation which also contributed to lower sialylaton yields.\n\nAll sialoside products synthesized in preparative scale were purified by gel filtration chromatography and semi-prep high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a reverse-phase C18 column. The structures were characterized by 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as wells as high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Neu4,5Ac 2 \u03b13Lac (24) synthesized in gram scale was purified (1.33 g) using a CombiFlash \u00ae Rf 200i system with a ODS-SM column (51 g, 50 \u03bcM, 120 \u00c5, Yamazen).\n\nThe synthesized pNP-tagged sialoside Neu4,5Ac 2 \u03b13Gal\u03b2pNP (27) In order to test whether the cleavage of Neu4,5Ac 2 by human influenza A viruses was caused by de-O-acetylation or direct de-sialylation, Neu4,5Ac 2 \u03b13Lac was incubated with purified human influenza A viruses followed by high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis. A major product peak for Neu4,5Ac 2 was seen and only a trace amount of Neu5Ac was observed (Fig. S2, ESI) , indicating a direct de-sialylation of Neu4,5Ac 2 mechanism was used by human influenza A viruses.\n\nIn conclusions, we report here a convenient and efficient chemoenzymatic sialylation approach for synthesizing \u03b12-3-linked sialosides containing a 4-O-acetylated sialic acid.\n\nPmST3, but not other bacterial sialyltransferases, was identified as a unique sialyltransferase that can catalyze the transfer of 4-O-acetylated sialic acid. Using chemically or chemoenzymatically synthesized Neu4,5Ac 2 (1) or Neu4Ac5Gc (2), \u03b12-3-linked sialosides were readily obtained by a one-pot two-enzyme (OP2E) system containing NmCSS and PmST3. Using Neu4,5Ac 2 \u03b13Gal\u03b2pNP as an effective probe, substrate specific studies showed that while Neu4,5Ac 2 was not hydrolyzed by bacterial sialidases tested, it was effectively removed by human influenza A virus neuraminidases.\n\nChemicals were purchased and used as received. NMR spectra were recored in the NMR facility of University of California, Davis on a Varian Inova 400 (400 MHz for 1 H, 100 MHz for 13 C) and a Bruker Avance-800 NMR spectrometer ( Recombinant enzymes Bifidobacterium longum strain ATCC55813 N-acetylhexosamine-1kinase (BLNahK or NahK_ATCC55813), 43 Pasteurella multocida N-acetylglucosamine uridyltransferase (PmGlmU), 44 Pasteurella multocida inorganic pyrophosphatase (PmPpA), 40 Neisseria meningitidis \u03b21-3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (NmLgtA), 45, 46 Escherichia coli galactokinase (EcGalK), 48 Bifidobacterium longum UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase (BLUSP), 49 Neisseria meningitidis \u03b21-4-galactosyltransferase (NmLgtB), 40 Pasteurella multocida sialic acid aldolase (PmNanA), 25 Neisseria meningitidis CMP-sialic acid synthetase (NmCSS), 26 Pasteurella multocida CSS (PmCSS), Haemophilus ducreyi CSS (HdCSS), and two NmCSS mutants (NmCSS_S81R and NmCSS_Q163A), 27 Pasteurella multocida multifunctional \u03b12-3-sialyltransferase 1 (PmST1) 29 and Pasteurella multocida \u03b12-3-sialyltransferase 3 (PmST3) 31 (14) were prepared as described previously. 29, 40, 41 Tetrasaccharide LNnT\u03b2ProN 3 (23) was chemoenzymatically synthesized via sequential one-pot multienzyme (OPME) glycosylation approach from Lac\u03b2ProN 3 (17) as described below:\n\nChemical synthesis of 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu4,5Ac 2 , 1)\n\nBenzyl 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-\u03b2-D-galacto-2-nonulopyranosonate (4)-To a stirring solution of Neu5Ac (3, 5 g, 16.2 mmol) in water (20 mL), 10% Cs 2 CO 3 was added dropwisely to adjust the pH value of solution to neutral. The reaction mixture was then evaporated and dried for overnight using a vacuum pump. The obtained solid was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (20 mL), and benzyl bromide (3 mL) was added dropwisely. The mixture was stirred under argon for overnight at room temperature and then filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to produce a syrup. Crystallization using 2-propanol produced 4 (5.8 g, 90% \n\nTo a solution of compound 5 (2.0 g, 4.55 mmol) in pyridine (4 mL), acetic anhydride (2 mL) was added. The mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature and then ethanol (10 mL) was added.

Briefly, Neu5Ac (10.1 g, 32.65 mmol) was dissolved in water (50 mL) and 10% Cs 2 CO 3 was added to adjust the solution to neutral. After removal of the solvent and dried under vacuum, the obtained solid was dissolved in dry DMF (60 mL), and benzyl bromide (6 mL) was added at 0 \u00b0C. The mixture was stirred at room temperature under argon for overnight and then filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to a syrup which was crystallized using 2-propanol to produce 4 (11.1 g, 85%). Compound 4 (10.08 g, 25.23 mmol) was then dissolved in acetone (150 mL), and 2,2-dimethoxypropane (20 mL) and camphorsulfonic acid (150 mg) were added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Trimethylamine (500 \u03bcL) was added and the mixture was stirred for 15 min before it was concentrated. The obtained residue was purified using a 150 g RediSep Rf silica column (EtOAc:MeOH = 5:1, by volume) on a CombiFlash \u00ae Rf 200i system to produce 5 (10.5 g, 95%).

After being concentrated, the residue was purified using a 150 g RediSep Rf silica column (EtOAc:MeOH = 10:1, by volume) on a CombiFlash \u00ae Rf 200i system to produce compound 6 (9.1 g, 84%). A solution of compound 6 (8.58 g, 17.83 mmol) in 90% acetic acid (40 mL) was stirred at 60 \u00b0C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was evaporated and the obtained syrup was dissolved in methanol (50 mL) and treated with H 2 in the presence of 10% Pd/C for 2 h at room temperature. The solution was filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified using a ODS-SM column (51 g, 50 \u03bcM, 120 \u00c5, Yamazen) on a CombiFlash \u00ae Rf 200i system and was eluted with a gradient of 0-100% acetonitrile in water containing 0.05% formic acid over 30 minutes with a 30 mL/min flow rate. The fractions containing the pure product were collected and concentrated to produce the final product 1 (5.2 g, 83%) as a white powder.\n\nN-(2-Benzyloxyacetyl)-D-neuraminic acid (9)-Solid K 2 CO 3 (14.4 g, 104.3 mM) was added to a stirred mixture of ManNH 2 \u00b7HCl (7, 4.5 g, 20.8 mM) in dry MeOH (100 mL).

When the reaction was completed as monitored by TLC, the mixture was concentrated and purified by flash chromatography (DCM:MeOH = 10:1, by volume) to produce ManNGc analog 8 (5.8 g, 85%). Compound 8 (3.5 g, 10.7 mM) and pyruvate (4.11 g, 37.4 mM) were dissolved in water (35 mL) in a 50 mL centrifuge tube. After the addition of an appropriate amount of PmNanA (52 mg), the reaction mixture was incubated in an isotherm incubator for 48 h at 37 C with gentle shaking. The reaction progress was monitored by TLC (nPrOH:H 2 O:HOAc = 5:2:1, by volume) and mass spectrometer (MS).
