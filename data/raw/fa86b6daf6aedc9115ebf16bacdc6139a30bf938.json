{"title": "USE OF REAL-TIME ULTRASONOGRAPHY AS AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR EARLY DETECTION, CONFIRMATION AND EVALUATION OF RAT PREGNANCY", "body": "Rats have been the backbone of many biomedical research studies (Aitman et al. 2008) and are one of the most common models in toxicity and developmental studies during gestation. Early and precise diagnosis of pregnancy, confirmation of the number and age of fetuses and evaluation of embryonic development are prominent in these studies (Krinke 2000) . Pregnancy can be determined traditionally by the presence of a copulatory plug after mating, an enlarged lower abdomen, manual palpation (Agematsu et al. 1983; Bennet and Vickery 1970) , hair loss around nipples and nipple enlargement (Bennet and Vickery 1970; Bivin 1986 ) and finally, monitoring of weight gain.\n\nUltrasonography, although widely used in human pregnancy, is not as common in laboratory animal studies. Until recently, the use of ultrasonography was limited to larger non-rodent species (Beccaglia and Luvoni 2006; Carr et al. 2012; Lenard et al. 2007; Lindahl 1966; Quintela et al. 2012; Zambelli and Prati 2006) . Because of advances in ultrasound imaging technology, commercially available ultrasound systems now have the spatial and temporal resolution to obtain accurate images of rat and mouse hearts, kidneys and other organs (Coatney 2001; Golden et al. 2012; Kobayashi et al. 2001; Srinivasan et al. 1998; Stypmann 2007) . For this reason, ultrasound is a practical method for the diagnosis of pregnancy in agouti mice (Sousa et al. 2012) , staging of gestation and monitoring of intrauterine growth in rats (Brown et al. 2006; Mu et al. 2008; Nguyen et al. 2012; Pallares and Gonzalez-Bulnes 2009; Ypsilantis et al. 2009 ).\n\nThe aim of the present study was to develop a method that could be used in conjunction with the standard pregnancy detection setup in routine experiments. Additionally, this method had to be non-invasive and comply with the ''3 Rs''-replacement, reduction and refinement-in animal research (Russell and Burch 1959) . In this article, we describe the results of monitoring pregnancy in Wistar rats using real-time ultrasound and share the results collected relative not only to the early determination of pregnancy, but also to the assessment of fetal development at different embryonic stages.\n\nThe study was performed in the animal facility of the Centre for Experimental Surgery of the Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, and was evaluated and authorized by the Veterinary Service of the Prefecture of Athens, as mandated by Greek legal requirements for animal experimentation. The facility is registered as a ''breeding'' and ''experimental'' facility according to Greek Presidential Decree 160/91, which harmonizes national legislation with European Community Directive 86/609/EEC on the Protection of Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes.\n\nThe animals were weighed before mating and for the duration of pregnancy. Consumption of food and water was observed during experimentation.\n\nThe first ultrasound examination was performed on the seventh day (D7) post-coitum in all animals. Thereafter, pregnant animals were examined ultrasonographically daily by the same operator (G.M.), between 1100 and 1300 h. The last ultrasound was performed on day 19. The ultrasonographer was blinded to the day the animals became pregnant.\n\nAll animals were anesthetized for ultrasound examinations. Anesthesia was induced by administration of isoflurane 5% (Wenger 2012; Flecknell 2009 ) via a face mask (VME Small Animal Anesthesia Machine, MDS Matrix, Orchard Park, NY, USA). Induction of anesthesia was confirmed by loss of the pedal withdraw reflex. Ultrasonography examination commenced immediately after loss of the pedal withdraw reflex of the animal. Anesthesia was maintained by administration of isoflurane 2.5% (Medical Supplies & Services International, Keighley, West Yorkshire, UK) simultaneously with oxygen 1 to 1.2 L/min.\n\nUltrasonography was conducted at the operating room of the facility where the vaporizer is located. All animals were examined in the supine position. The hair of the abdomen was thoroughly clipped and shaved immediately after anesthesia induction, to achieve full contact of the probe with the skin in the region concerned. Acoustic gel (Skintact, Leonard Lang, Innsbruck, Austria) was liberally applied. In this way, the phenomenon of ''grimy acoustic shadow'' created by the air, which holds the animal dander, was reduced to a minimum and the resolution of ultrasound was greatly improved.\n\nWe used the Vivid I ultrasound machine (GE Medical Systems, Tirat Carmel, Israel) with the linear transducer probe 12 L-RS (GE Yokogawa Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan), which has a variable frequency of 5-13 MHz. To achieve detailed imaging of the reproductive tract of rats and embryos, we used a frequency of 13 MHz, with one focal zone set at a depth of 0.5-2 cm. The total duration of the examination was approximately 10 min.\n\nImmediately after the end of each study, administration of isoflurane was interrupted; all animals were receiving oxygen and recovering smoothly when returned to their cages. Use of a volatile anesthetic at the precise dosage for the vaporizer is considered a tolerable method of anesthesia (Flecknell 2009; Kohn et al. 1997) . Specialized personnel (E.B.) handled the animals during vaginal smear collection and anesthesia induction and there were no adverse effects.\n\nA total of 64 female Wistar rats (HsdOla:WI) aged 18 6 1.56 wk were studied. These animals were obtained from the breeding colony of the animal facility and were being used for the first time in reproductive studies; their estrous cycles were confirmed as normal with vaginal smears. The animals were caged in pairs in H-Temp polysulfone type III cages 425 mm long 3 266 mm wide 3 185 mm high (Tecniplast, Varese, Italy).\n\nTwo female Wistar rats were introduced into the cage of a male rat of proven fertility where they remained until the day sperm was detected on the vaginal smear. All cytologic examinations were performed by the same person (M.S.). The day on which sperm was detected was designated as embryonic day 0 (D0), and the female was returned to its cage.\n\nAll cages were kept in the same animal room with a HEPA-filtered air supply, 15 ACH, at a room temperature of 24 6 2 C, relative humidity of 55 6 10%, 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (0700/1900), light intensity of 300 lx, as measured 1 m above the floor in the middle of the room, and positive air pressure of 0.6 Pa within the room. All animals were free of a wide range of pathogens including Kilham rat virus, rat parvovirus, Toolan's H-1 virus, Sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus type III, murine encephalomyelitis virus, sialodacryoadenitis virus, rat min virus, Hantaan virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, CAR bacillus, MAD 1 and 2, rat rotavirus, rat coronavirus, Mycoplasma pulmonis, Clostridium piliforme, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella spp, fur mites and pinworms.\n\nAll Wistar rats had ad libitum access to filtered tap water in drinking bottles and pelleted chow, which contained 18.5% protein, 5.5% fat, 4.5% fiber, 6% ash (irradiated vacuum packed, 2918, Harlan, Italy). Each cage contained 140 g of corncob bedding (Rehofix MK 2000, J. Rettenmaier & Soehne, Rosenberg, Germany). Cages were cleaned once a week.\n\nPresence of an embryonic sac and ability to distinguish embryo, embryonic organs and placenta were evaluated. Findings were correlated with the overall development of the fetus, as previously described by other authors (Theiler 1989; Witschi 1972; Ypsilantis et al. 2009 ). The characteristic features unique for each day were noted and are summarized in Table 1 . With D0 considered the day of detection of sperm in the vaginal smear, ultrasound examination was performed daily starting from D7. The pregnancy was first detected by ultrasound on D8 (Fig. 1a) . The only visible structure was the embryonic sac, which appeared as a round to oval structure filled with anechoic to isoechoic fluid. There was no evidence of the embryo. The placenta was first evident on D9 (Fig. 1b) , as a hyperechoic zonar structure attached in the inner surface of the gestational sac. On D10, the fetus became distinguishable and the heart was also obvious with color Doppler signal (Fig. 1c) . The cardiac pulse appeared on the same day, but the heart rate could not be measured with pulse wave Doppler. On D11, the heart was clearly visible with B-mode imaging, but heart rate could not be estimated (Fig. 1d) . The next day D12, the amniotic fluid was visible and cardiac function was evaluated with pulse wave Doppler (Fig. 1e) . The tail could be distinguished and the fetal extremities were apparent on D13 (Fig. 1f) . The four chambers of the heart and the umbilical cord were also visible on D13.\n\nFrom D14 onward, the body and head became increasingly distinguishable as the embryo was bent dorsally, the snout lifted from the chest and the medullary tube was visible (Fig. 1g) . The body uncoiled and there was clear separation between the head and body at D15, along with cranial ossification. The urinary bladder was also visible on D15 (Fig. 1h) . On D16, osseous tissue started to develop, especially at the body ends, with clear discrimination of the phalanges. The ribs started to develop, and eye sockets were visible. D16 was also the first day the liver became visible (Fig. 1i ). Brain ventricles became detectable on D17, along with the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Ossification of the spine and ribs was in progress, whereas the phalanges were clearly ossified (Fig. 1j) . On D18, the heart ventricles became evident, while ossification of the spine and ribs continued. The liver and other abdominal organs were also distinguishable (Fig. 1k) . Finally, on D19, the jaw bone could be differentiated from the rest of the skull and the kidneys were also discernible (Fig. 1l) .\n\nBecause of advances in ultrasound imaging technology, commercially available ultrasound systems now have the spatial and temporal resolution to obtain accurate images of rat and mouse hearts, kidneys and other target tissues (Coatney 2001; Golden et al. 2012; Stypmann 2007) . The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the use of real-time ultrasound examination in the accurate detection of rat pregnancy. According to the data obtained, D8 is the earliest day on which pregnancy could be detected, and it was based on the observation of the embryonic sacs. Detection of pregnancy is just as important as detection of non-pregnancy; it is crucial for researchers in terms of time management and planning, reducing the number of mother animals sacrificed and waiting time between experiments. Such information might prove vital to decision making in each case. In addition, ultrasound imaging of the reproductive tract during pregnancy provides valuable information relative to the developmental stage of embryos, embryo viability and progression of fetal development. Figure 1 is a sequence of representative images of embryonic development. Information on fetal age and development may be gathered from both somatometric measurements and indexing of other detectable features, such as the heart rate on each day of pregnancy (Zambelli and Prati 2006) . Ultrasonographic detection of the heart rate at day 12 was also considered a clear indicator of embryonic age. Days 14 and 15 were milestones with respect to anatomic changes in the fetus, as fetal skeletal morphology could easily be distinguished and evaluated. Furthermore, another useful finding was the detection of fetal abdominal organs from day 15 onward.\n\nWe created an index as a reference for researchers in their everyday laboratory animal science praxis. The results obtained by ultrasonography (Table 1 ) were in accordance with anatomic descriptions reported in textbooks (Theiler 1989; Witschi 1972) , can be non-invasively obtained by ultrasound examination and may prove to be a valuable tool for future studies.\n\nThe limitations of the present study must, however, be recognized. Only one person performed the ultrasound examinations using a single ultrasound scanner. The intrinsic spatial resolution of the imaging system and the absence of reproducibility analysis may limit the generalizability of our results. Further work is necessary to expand the dataset obtained from this study.\n\nUltrasonography is an examination method with minimal biological or other side effects for the patient, the operator and assisting personnel (Shaw et al. 1999) . Furthermore the interventions used in the present study were in compliance with the principle of refinement of the 3 Rs for humane use of animals in research. Furthermore, this effort may be of benefit in future experimentation in reducing the numbers of animals used or sacrificed, specifically in protocols concerning pregnancy or embryo transfer. Finally, it is worth mentioning that use of ultrasonography in embryonic development studies provides the unique opportunity to monitor the same pregnant animal throughout the whole gestational period, in parallel with real-time monitoring of the viability and somatometric characteristics of the fetuses.\n\nBy exploiting the high sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography in examining soft tissue, we were able to detect rat embryos from gestational day 8. In conjunction with the vaginal smear technique, a profile of the estrous cycle and development of the fetus can be obtained. Such data, along with the corresponding gestational days, are invaluable in studies concerning pregnancy, fetal development and embryo transfer."}
