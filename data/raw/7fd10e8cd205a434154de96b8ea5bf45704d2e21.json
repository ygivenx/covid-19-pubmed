{"title": "Barcode-Enabled Sequencing of Plasmablast Antibody Repertoires in Rheumatoid Arthritis HHS Public Access", "body": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune synovitis associated with the production of autoantibodies, including rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) [1] [2] [3] . ACPAs target proteins that have undergone citrullination 124 , a posttranslational modification that converts peptidyl-arginine to peptidyl-citrulline. Presently, such antibodies are detected in the clinic using the cyclic-citrullinated-peptide (CCP) assay 15 . The CCP assay uses as detector antigens a mixture of cyclized, citrulline-substituted peptides derived from filaggrin, a protein not expressed in joint tissue 4 , and therefore does not identify the bona fide, in vivo targets of ACPAs. Thus, uncovering the specificity of the ACPAs that contribute to the pathogenesis of RA remains a critical challenge 14 . To gain further insights into the specificity of the autoantibody response in RA, we developed and applied a DNA barcoding method to sequence the cognate heavy-and light-chain pairs of antibodies expressed by individual peripheral blood plasmablasts derived from individuals with anti-CCP autoantibody positive RA (anti-CCP + RA).\n\nAntibodies are comprised of heavy and light chains, each containing an antigen-binding domain that is generated by the recombination, junctional diversification, and somatic hypermutation of variable (V), joining (J) and/or diversity (D) gene segments. Several methods exist for the profiling and isolation of native human antibodies, including single B cell RT-PCR [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, single B cell RT-PCR is laborious, requiring Sanger sequencing of each B cell, followed by production and screening of a large number of antibodies [7] [8] [9] [10] . Two recently developed methods have begun to address the issue of heavy-and light-chain pairing on a larger scale. One method involves the deposition of single B cells in highdensity microwell plates followed by the sequencing of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of their antibody genes 13 . The other involves mass spectrometric analysis of circulating antibodies against specific antigens followed by combinatorial expression and screening of possible heavy-and light-chain pairs 14 . Although useful tools, these methods have shortcomings: they use V-gene-specific primers that fail to amplify all immunoglobulin sequences (especially mutated 5'-end sequences that have arisen from extensive somatic hypermutation that may confer interesting biological properties); they cannot distinguish between sequencing errors and closely related sequences that have arisen through somatic hypermutation; they sequence only the CDR3 regions and thus cannot accurately identify clonal families of antibodies that share other heavy-and light-chain variable region sequences; they cannot accurately determine the size of clonal antibody families; and they require PCR cloning and Sanger sequencing to deliver complete V-region sequences.\n\nTo overcome these shortcomings, we developed a novel approach that combines highthroughput sequencing with DNA barcode-enabled pairing of cognate heavy-and lightchain antibody sequences expressed by individual B cells 15 . We focus our analysis on the antibodies expressed by peripheral blood plasmablasts; these antibody-producing cells arise from both the na\u00efve and the memory B cells activated in an immune response 1116-18 , and their antibody repertoires therefore provide a comprehensive 'snapshot' of the ongoing antibody response. By bioinformatically analyzing the resulting sequence datasets, we can generate phylogenetic trees of the antibody responses and rationally select key antibodies for cloning, expression, and characterization of their binding and functional properties.\n\nTo demonstrate the power of our DNA barcoding method and to further study the specificities of the autoantibody response in RA, we applied our DNA barcoding method to characterize the autoantibody response of peripheral blood plasmablasts derived from individuals with anti-CCP + RA. Phylogenetic trees representing the plasmablast antibody repertoires revealed the production of affinity matured clonal families of antibodies in anti-CCP + RA, and these trees were used to guide selection of representative antibodies for recombinant expression. We demonstrate that recombinant antibodies derived from RA plasmablasts bind to CCP in the CCP2 ELISA and to putative, citrullinated autoantigensincluding \u03b1-enolase, citrullinated fibrinogen, and citrullinated histone 2B-contained on RA antigen microarrays.\n\nSamples were collected after obtaining informed consent and under human subject protocols approved by the Investigational Review Board (IRB) at Stanford University. For RA samples, we collected blood from individuals who met at least four of seven of the 1987 classification criteria for RA 19 .\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stained and IgG + plasmablasts bulk sorted by gating for CD19 + CD20 \u2212 CD27 + CD38 ++ IgA \u2212 IgM \u2212 cells. Plasmablasts were then cultured in complete RPMI for 7 days in 96-well plates at a density of 150,000 cells/well. We used the supernatants at a 1:1 dilution in RA antigen microarray assays.\n\nPBMCs were stained and IgG + plasmablasts single-cell sorted into 96-well plates based on gating for CD19 + CD20 \u2212 CD27 + CD38 ++ IgA \u2212 IgM \u2212 cells 11 .\n\nWe performed reverse transcription with an MMLV H \u2212 reverse transcriptase that has 3'tailing 20 and template-switching activity in order to synthesize cDNA and tag it with a 'well-ID barcode' sequence unique to each well (and hence unique to each plasmablast cell) ( Figure 1A and D). We pooled the well-ID-tagged cDNAs from each plate and tagged them with plate-ID barcodes by using nested PCR and primers specific to the constant regions of the heavy and light chains. We used Phusion Hot Start II DNA polymerase (NEB/ Fermentas) for both the first PCR (PCR1) and the nested PCR (PCR2). Primers and adapters are listed in Supplementary Table 1 15 .\n\nFor 454 sequencing, we pooled the amplified DNA, gel purified them, added Lib-L sequencing adapters, and then purified the amplicons with Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). We determined DNA concentrations by using Picogreen DNA assay kits (Invitrogen) and sent the amplicons to Roche, where they were emPCR sequenced at 1 cpb before being subjected to 454 Titanium sequencing.\n\nSequencing data were analyzed by 454 GS FLX data analysis software. Sff output files from 454 sequencing, containing sequences and quality scores for each nucleotide, were read into Python by using the Biopython package, and sequences were grouped and parsed into separate sff files on the basis of their compound ID (plate-ID + well-ID). We used Newbler 2.6 to assemble forward reads into consensus sequences by using the \"-cdna\", \"-ud\" and \"urt\" options, using a minimum threshold of 8 reads. Where multiple assemblies occurred per well, which is common with oversampling (>100 reads), an assembly was accepted if it contained >50% of all reads in a well, and/or was 3\u00d7 more abundant than the next read. Otherwise, we assumed that the well contained more than one plasmablast, and we disregarded the sequence reads from that well.\n\nWe analyzed heavy-and light-chain sequences with IMGT HighV-QUEST 21 , software that compares an antibody-chain sequence to a database of known alleles of germline sequences and predicts which germline alleles the antibody uses, how the germline sequences were recombined, and the number of mutations the antibody has relative to the germline sequence (broken down into \"all mutations\", \"silent mutations\", and \"non-silent mutations\"). Clonal family antibodies were defined as antibodies with shared heavy-chain VJ and light-chain VJ sequence usage and shared mutations as compared to the corresponding germline sequence. Heavy-chain D alleles were not used in the clonal family assignments, as their short length (<20 AA) and high mutation rates can make D-allele calling inaccurate. We also identified 'singleton' antibodies, i.e., antibodies using heavy-chain and/or light-chain VJ sequences that were not used by any other antibody in an individual's plasmablast antibody repertoire.\n\nHeavy-and light-chain sequences were clustered based on their V-region sequences, binned according to their heavy-chain V-gene usage, and then concatenated and aligned with Muscle 22 . They were clustered with PhyML 23 maximum-likelihood clustering, and rooted by their germline heavy-chain V gene. Each V-gene phylogenetic tree was then arranged by heavy-chain V-gene families, generating the displayed phylogenetic trees. Therefore, the distance between each V-gene sub-dendrogram is arbitrary. Trees were drawn with ETE 24 .\n\nTo select antibodies representative of clonal families, we aligned the sequences of antibodies within clonal families and selected the most common sequence for expression. Singleton antibodies were selected at random. We inserted kappa and lambda light chains into vector pEE12.4 (Lonza), and the gamma heavy chain into pEE6.4 (Lonza). Heavy-and light-chain sequences were cloned by PCR or gene synthesized, and the heavy-and light-chain variable regions inserted into the vector containing the 5' end of the antibody chains (the leader and V(D)J sequences) along with the appropriate antibody constant regions. For PCR isolation of the variable regions, we used well-ID-specific forward primers and constant regionspecific reverse primers. For gene synthesis, heavy-and light-chain variable region sequences were emailed to and gene synthesized by Lake Pharma (San Carlos, CA).\n\nWe performed transient, dual transfections of paired light-chain-containing pEE12.4 and heavy-chain-containing pEE6.4 constructs in 293T cells by using Lipofectamine 2000. We purified the expressed antibodies from the culture supernatants by using Protein A Plus agarose beads (Pierce).\n\nAnti-CCP2 ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Eurodiagnostica, Malmo, Sweden).\n\nRA antigen microarrays were printed and probed, and datasets analyzed, as previously described [25] [26] [27] .\n\nWe developed a novel method for tagging all cDNA generated from each individual antibody-expressing cell with a unique DNA barcode before sequencing the cDNA; we then used these unique barcodes to match the heavy-and light-chain antibody sequences that derive from the same cell 15 . In this way, we uncovered the sequences of the specific heavy and light chains that make up each antibody, information that we used to generate phylogenetic trees of the antibody response and to clone and express the antibodies encoded by these sequences.\n\nWe single-cell sorted plasmablasts into separate wells of 96-well plates. For each plate of 96 wells, we included 8 control wells that remained empty (i.e., we did not sort cells into those 8 wells). Therefore, for each plate, we could expect at most 88 sequences. On average, we achieved approximately 44 heavy-chain sequences per plate, and 65 light-chain sequences per plate. After quality control and pairing of sequences on the basis of barcodes, we obtained on average 41 antibody sequences (paired heavy and light chains) per plate.\n\nWe collected PBMCs from individuals with active RA, and bulk sorted IgG + plasmablasts on the basis of cell-surface staining for CD19 + CD20 \u2212 CD27 + CD38 + IgA \u2212 IgM \u2212 (Figure 2A) . Bulk-sorted IgG+ plasmablasts were cultured in vitro, and their culture supernatants were analyzed on RA antigen microarrays ( Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 1 ). Antibodies derived from the supernatants of peripheral blood plasmablasts from individuals with anti-CCP + RA reacted to multiple citrullinated peptides contained on RA antigens microarrays 2526 , including citrullinated peptides derived from fibrinogen alpha, vimentin, histone 2A and clusterin. In contrast, those from individuals with anti-CCP \u2212 RA had minimal reactivity and those from individuals with psoriatic arthritis had no reactivity. This observation, that plasmablasts circulating in the peripheral blood of individuals with RA produce ACPAs ( Figure 2B ), is consistent with the findings of others 28 , and suggests that analyzing plasmablast antibody repertoires in active RA could uncover the specific ACPAs and other key autoantibodies involved in RA pathogenesis.\n\nWe single-cell sorted IgG + plasmablasts from PMBCs derived from 4 anti-CCP + RA patients into 96-well plates on the basis of cell-surface staining for CD19 + CD20 \u2212 CD27 + CD38 + IgA \u2212 IgM \u2212 (Figure 2A) . Following the scheme shown in Figure  1 , we synthesized and barcoded cDNA from the plasmablasts and sequenced it by 454 sequencing. We used our bioinformatic analyses method to obtain sequences of cognate heavy-and light-chain pairs and determined their V(D)J usage. Using 'maximum likelihood clustering', we then performed heavy chain-weighted clustering of the resulting paired heavy-and light-chain sequences to generate phylogenetic trees of the antibody responses in anti-CCP + RA patients and identify clonal families of antibodies that use the same heavychain V(D)J and light-chain VJ sequences as well as singleton antibodies (Figure 3 ). Nucleotide sequence alignments of antibodies contained in clonal families show evidence of somatic hypermutation due to affinity maturation, and an example of a representative heavychain alignment is provided in Supplementary Figure 2 .\n\nUsing plasmablast cDNA generated from 4 patients, we sequenced a total of 557 antibodies (paired heavy and light chains). We identified 38 clonal families, consisting of a total of 105 antibodies. The remaining 452 antibodies we identified as singletons.\n\nWe selected antibodies representative of eleven different clonal families from the 4 patients (RA3-7, RA9-14), and three 'singleton' antibodies that do not belong to a clonal family (RA1, RA2, RA8), for PCR cloning or gene synthesis and recombinant expression ( Figure  3 ). Using the commercial CCP2 assay, we found that 4 of the recombinant antibodies-RA1, RA2, RA3 and RA8-can bind to CCP ( Figure 4A ). Recombinant antibodies RA1, RA2 and RA3 bound weakly, whereas RA8 bound relatively strongly. Our observation that several of these antibodies bind only weakly to CCP may be because CCP is an artificial mimic of the unknown endogenous citrullinated antigens present in RA synovium 1426 .\n\nWe next used RA antigen microarrays containing putative RA autoantigens 2527 to screen the antigen specificity of the recombinant antibodies. We found that antibody RA4 bound strongly to the \u03b1-enolase peptide 403-442, while RA5 and 9 bound to it weakly ( Figure 4B ). \u03b1-enolase is present in the synovium, and autoantibody targeting of \u03b1-enolase is thought to be a pathogenic link between environmental and genetic risk factors for the development of RA 2930 . RA8 strongly bound to citrullinated histone 2B and to the citrullinated fibrinogen-\u03b1 peptide 616-635. RA2 bound to histone H2A (which is constitutively citrullinated as evidenced by mass spectrometric analysis; data not shown) and to the native histone H2B peptides H2B/f 16-35 and H2B/h16-35. RA8, RA12, RA13 and RA14 all bound to the native histone 2B peptide H2B/f 16-35. Although recombinant antibodies RA1 and RA3 did not bind to any of the putative citrullinated synovial-joint antigens contained on our RA antigen microarrays, they did bind to cfc-1 (a citrulline-containing peptide of the synthetic CCP 5 ) ( Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 3) , confirming the results of the CCP2 assay ( Figure 4A ).\n\nThus, our method enabled direct generation of monoclonal antibodies sequenced from peripheral blood plasmablasts derived from anti-CCP + RA patients, and these antibodies were shown to target putative citrullinated and native autoantigens 2629-33 . Our results demonstrate that ACPAs that target citrullinated epitopes present on fibrinogen and histone 2B are produced by the active B cell response (e.g. the plasmablast response) in RA, suggesting that these ACPAs and their corresponding autoantigen targets may contribute to the pathogenesis of RA.\n\nWe describe development of a DNA barcoding technology for the large-scale sequencing of the cognate heavy-and light-chain immunoglobulin genes expressed by individual B cells, and apply this approach to sequence the plasmablast antibody repertoires of individuals with active, anti-CCP + RA. This method accurately and rapidly yields sequence information at a breadth and depth that allows one to dissect the antibody response and map its evolution with high resolution. Bioinformatic identification of groups of antibodies that use the same heavy-chain V(D)J and light-chain VJ sequences allows for rational, bioinformatic selection, and hence efficient production, of the antibodies that are likely to be integral to the active immune response.\n\nPlasmablasts develop during an immune response (from newly activated native as well as memory B cells), express antibodies that are affinity matured, and circulate transiently in the bloodstream [16] [17] [18] . Therefore, by analyzing the antibody repertoires of circulating plasmablasts, we can home in on those antibodies that are produced specifically as part of an ongoing immune response-in this case, the relevant autoantibodies in active RA. Studying antibody responses when antigen exposure is not ongoing would require analysis of other antibody-expressing cells, such as antigen-specific memory B cells or tissue-resident plasma cells, and our method can equally be applied to the analysis of such cell types. Indeed, our method can be used to study the antibody repertoires of any B-cell lineage cells, and thus represents a versatile tool that can be applied to diverse fundamental, translation, and clinical questions.\n\nIn using our DNA barcoding method to characterize the peripheral blood plasmablast antibody repertoires in RA 2834 , we generated phylogenetic trees representing the antibody repertoires of these individuals. The phylogenetic trees revealed multiple distinct clonal families of antibodies with shared heavy-chain V(D)J and light-chain VJ sequences, indicating ongoing B cell activation and affinity maturation in individuals with anti-CCP + RA.\n\nFrom the RA plasmablast antibody repertoires, of the 14 recombinant antibodies we expressed, 4 were reactive in the CCP2 assay and 1 bound to citrullinated epitopes contained on RA antigen microarrays, i.e., a total of 5 out of 14 antibodies had reactivity against citrullinated epitopes. In addition, we identified 3 antibodies that bound to \u03b1-enolase, multiple antibodies that bound to histone 2B, and one antibody that bound to histone 2A, i.e., they bound to antigens that are present in synovial joints and whose autoantibody targeting could contribute to the pathogenesis of RA. In addition, representative recombinant antibodies from several clonal families had RF binding activity (data not shown), and characterization of their binding and functional properties are ongoing.\n\nOne recombinant antibody bound strongly to a citrullinated fibrinogen peptide and to citrullinated histone H2B. We previously demonstrated that the citrullination of fibrinogen increases the potency with which it binds to TLR4 by 10-fold, such that immune complexes comprised of citrullinated fibrinogen and anti-citrullinated fibrinogen antibodies potently dual-stimulate macrophages through TLR4 and Fc receptors to produce TNF 35 . In addition, transfer of an anti-citrullinated fibrinogen antibody exacerbated arthritis in a mouse model 33 . Our finding that peripheral blood plasmablasts derived from anti-CCP + RA patients produce ACPAs that target citrullinated fibrinogen suggests that these plasmablast ACPAs are the product of an ongoing B cell response in RA. This suggests that citrullinated fibrinogen and anti-citrullinated fibrinogen ACPAs 31-33 could play a role in driving synovitis and the pathogenesis of RA.\n\nIn addition, 50% (7 of 14) of the recombinant antibodies bound to epitopes present on histone proteins or histone-derived peptides, specifically to histone H2B peptides or protein, and to histone H2A protein. Histones are one of the constitutively citrullinated proteins 436 . Although histones are generally intracellular (and often nuclear) proteins, neutrophils can extrude neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) containing citrullinated antigens, thereby exposing the antigens to the immune system and triggering autoimmune responses in RA and other autoimmune diseases 3738 . NET-mediated exposure of histones may account for the presence of anti-histone autoantibodies in the RA patients in our study.\n\nThus, our method can be used to isolate monoclonal autoantibodies and hence the autoantigens relevant to the pathogenesis of RA and other autoimmune diseases for which the autoantigens remain obscure.\n\nLimitations of the present study include the small number of individuals from whom plasmablasts were obtained, the limited depth of sequencing performed, and the limited comparisons made between singleton antibodies and antibodies belonging to clonal families. Further studies will be necessary to fully assess whether bioinformatically identifying clonal families is useful in identifying the functional, disease-relevant antibodies. It is possible that certain immunodominant antigens elicit the generation of large clonal families of antibodies that bind to a particular antigen but do not have any functional effect. Nevertheless, the ability to use clonal families to \"normalize\" the antibody repertoires facilitates selection of antibodies representative of both large and small clonal families for recombinant expression and characterization.\n\nIn conclusion, we developed a method for DNA barcoding the cDNA generated from an individual cell, and used this method to perform large-scale sequencing of the paired heavyand light-chain immunoglobulin genes expressed by individual peripheral blood plasmablasts derived from humans with anti-CCP + RA. Bioinformatic analysis of the resulting sequence datasets revealed clonal expansion and affinity maturation of the plasmablast response, and enabled us to bioinformatically select antibodies representative of clonal families and 'singletons' for recombinant expression. This approach yielded recombinant antibodies that bound citrullinated epitopes contained in fibrinogen, histone H2B and \u03b1-enolase, autoantigens implicated in the pathogenesis of RA 14262935 .\n\nHigh-resolution analysis of the clonality and evolution of the antibody response could be useful for identifying, understanding, and monitoring pathogenic immune responses in autoimmune diseases 41 . By enabling the rapid, comprehensive, and accurate characterization of ongoing human antibody responses, our DNA barcode-enabled method could provide a critical tool for uncovering the pathogenic autoantibodies produced in RA and other human autoimmune diseases for which the autoantigens remain obscure. Large-scale characterization of the autoantibody repertoires could provide further insights into pathogenesis of, and facilitate development of next-generation diagnostics and therapeutics for, RA and a variety of autoimmune diseases. Our method also has broad applicability for characterizing protective antibody responses against microbial infections, in response to vaccination, and in cancer.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
