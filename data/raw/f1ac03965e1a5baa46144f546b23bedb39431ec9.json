{"title": "", "body": "The presence of a head tilt, ipsilateral to the lesion, is the salient feature of vestibular disease. Nystagmus and/or vestibular ataxia may accompany the head tilt. The more acute the disease process, the more likely that nystagmus and ataxia are present. In vestibular ataxia, the animal leans, drifts, falls or rolls toward the side of the lesion. The nystagmus can be resting or positional (induced by holding the head in full extension), and, vertical, horizontal or rotatory in direction. The direction may change in time. Pendular nystagmus (oscillatory with rapid, short excursions) is not a sign of vestibular disease.\n\nOccasionally, there is bilateral vestibular disease. The animal may be reluctant to move because of severe disorientation. If able to walk, there are characteristic exaggerated motions of the head and neck and the cat moves in a crouched posture close to the ground. Physiological nystagmus is poor to absent. In these instances, a head tilt may not be present, or if present, is subtle on the most affected side.\n\nCircling is not a feature of vestibular disease but is frequent with thalamic and cerebral diseases.\n\nThe most important diagnostic step is to differentiate if the disease involves the peripheral OR the central portion of the vestibular system.\n\n\u2022 The head tilt is toward the side of the lesion. The nystagmus is horizontal or rotatory but never vertical, and never changes in direction. The ataxia, if present, is on the side of the head tilt. \u2022 By close proximity, the neurological structures associated with the middle ear may be affected leading to facial nerve paresis/paralysis, dry eye from decreased to absent lacrimation, and/or Acute to peracute non-progressive onset of a head tilt with ipsilateral falling or rolling in an otherwise healthy cat. The disorientation may be severe. If the disease is bilateral, the head tilt is not evident, the physiological nystagmus is poor to absent, and the cat moves in a crouched posture, low to the ground. The head swings from side to side in exaggerated motions.\n\n\u2022 Aminoglycosides (p 849)\n\nAcute onset of peripheral vestibular signs uni-or bilaterally following systemic or topical therapy with aminoglycosides. Deafness may accompany the vestibular signs.\n\n\u2022 Ear flush (p 846)\n\nPeripheral vestibular signs that appear immediately or in the 72 hours following an ear flush.\n\n\u2022 Blue-tailed lizard ingestion (p 848)\n\nIn southeastern United States, ingestion of a blue-tailed lizard is thought to be the cause of an acute unilateral peripheral vestibular syndrome.\n\n\u2022 Fracture of the petrous temporal bone or tympanic bulla, and ethmoid fracture (base of the skull) (p 848)\n\nPeripheral and central vestibular signs following a road accident.\n\nHorner's syndrome, partial or complete. The cochlear part of the vestibulo-cochlear nerve may be affected leading to ipsilateral deafness. \u2022 If the disease is bilateral, there is no head tilt or only a mild one on the side that is the most severely affected. The more acute the disease, the more severe the disorientation. The cat is reluctant to walk and has a crouched posture, low to the ground. The head characteristically moves from side to side in exaggerated motions and there is often ventroflexion of the head and neck. The physiological nystagmus (normal involuntary rhythmic typewriter-like movements of the eyes initiated by side-to-side movements of the head) is poor to absent.\n\n\u2022 The most consistent feature indicating central vestibular disease is the concomitant presence of somnolence, or quietness of the animal. This may or may not be obvious at time of examination, but will be evident with good history taking. \u2022 The head tilt is toward the side of the lesion. The nystagmus is horizontal, rotatory or vertical and may change in direction. \u2022 Due to their close proximity, other central nervous system structures may be involved ipsilaterally. These include the ascending reticular activating system or ARAS (somnolence) and the ipsilateral trigeminal nerve (loss of facial sensation and/or masticatory muscle atrophy), abducent nerve (strabismus), facial nerve (facial paresis/paralysis), cerebellum (tremors, hypermetria), ascending sensory pathways (proprioceptive deficits) and descending motor pathways (upper motor neuron weakness). \u2022 Bilateral involvement of the central vestibular system appears clinically similar to bilateral peripheral vestibular disorders in the early phase, except that the animal is more quiet or somnolent. If the cause is not corrected, involvement of other structures of the brainstem and/or cerebellum ensues.\n\nParadoxical vestibular syndrome.\n\n\u2022 In this rare syndrome of central vestibular disease, the head tilt is contralateral to the lesion. The diagnosis is made on the presence of cerebellar signs or postural reaction deficits ipsilateral to the lesion but contralateral to the head tilt.\n\nPeripheral vestibular disease results from a problem in the petrosal bone or tympanic bulla.\n\n\u2022 The peripheral part of the vestibular apparatus (receptors and nerve) is situated in the inner ear, in close proximity to the middle ear. The inner and middle ear are located within the petrosal bone or tympanic bulla. The facial nerve, the parasympathetic innervation of the lacrimal glands and the sympathetic nerve for pupillary dilatation are the neurological structures associated with the middle ear. \u2022 Diseases of the inner ear can by extension reach the middle ear and vice versa. \u2022 The neurologic structures of the middle ear are more resilient to insult than the receptors in the inner ear (receptors vs axons). As a result, middle ear disease may be present without neurological deficits. With time, facial paresis/paralysis and/or Horner's syndrome may appear. \u2022 The auditory receptors are situated in the inner ear as well. Unilateral deafness goes unnoticed clinically but is diagnosed with electrodiagnostic testing (brain auditory-evoked potentials).\n\nCentral vestibular disease results from an intracranial problem in the brainstem, at the level of the rostral medulla. This area is in close proximity to the cerebellum and pons. This anatomical location is called the cerebello-ponto-medullary angle.\n\nThe most common causes of vestibular disease are peripheral and include: \u2022 Idiopathic vestibular disease.\n\n\u2022 Otitis media-interna.\n\n\u2022 Less common causes are the middle ear polyps and tumors.\n\nCentral vestibular diseases are not as frequent as peripheral diseases.\n\n\u2022 Inflammatory diseases are the most common, with the clinical signs directly related to the location and severity of the inflammation. Although inflammatory diseases are multifocal or diffuse pathologically, this is often not the case clinically, where the neurological deficits in most cases can be assigned to one location.\n\nDiagnosis is based on careful history taking (to disclose if there is somnolence or quietness of the animal), physical, neurological, otoscopic and ophthalmoscopic (including Schirmer tear test) examinations, serum protein concentration, cerebrospinal fluid analysis (CSF), CSF anti-coronavirus IgG titer, electrodiagnostic testing (brain auditoryevoked responses), bullae radiography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.\n\nReference ranges for feline CSF.\n\n\u2022 RBC < 0.030 \u00d7 10 9 /L (30/\u03bcl) \u2022 WBC \u2264 0.002 \u00d7 10 9 /L (2/\u03bcl) \u2022 Cytology (%) -Monocytoid cells 69-100% -Lymphocytes 0-27% -Neutrophils 0-9% -Eosinophils 0 -Macrophages (large foamy mononuclear cells) 0-3% \u2022 Protein 0.036 g/L (36 mg/dl) It is good practice to request electrodiagnostic testing (BAER) to evaluate for deafness. If deafness is concomitantly present, it is an indication of a more aggressive disorder and a thorough diagnostic work up should be pursued.\n\nWhen a head tilt is present, or when there is facial paresis/paralysis or a Horner's syndrome, bulla radiography is recommended to evaluate the middle ear cavities. An open mouth view is best to compare the density between the bullae. Bulla radiography is not a sensitive tool. It may be normal despite the presence of disease. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the bullae is superior and should be done when available.\n\nRegardless of the cause of the vestibular signs, nystagmus and vestibular ataxia usually resolve, but the head tilt usually persists for the life of the animal. It may be barely noticeable but may be exacerbated after a general anesthetic or when the cat is ill.\n\nIDIOPATHIC VESTIBULAR SYNDROME*** Classical signs \u2022 Acute to subacute onset of a head tilt, falling, rolling and nystagmus. \u2022 Disorientation can be severe with the cat unwilling to move and crying out with anxiety. \u2022 Otherwise healthy cat.\n\nUnknown.\n\nPossibly higher incidence in July and August in northeast United States.\n\nCats of any age or sex, median age is 4 years old.\n\nAcute, non-progressive, unilateral and occasionally bilateral, peripheral vestibular disturbance.\n\nThe head tilt, ataxia and nystagmus (most often horizontal) can be severe with the animal crying out with anxiety, reluctant to walk, remaining in a crouched posture or with wide abduction of the limbs.\n\nRarely, can be bilateral.\n\nVomiting occasionally occurs, usually soon after onset of signs.\n\nAffected cats are otherwise healthy.\n\nHistory of an acute to subacute onset, in a previously healthy cat, of severe disorientation, falling and rolling, that improves rapidly (a few days to 2 weeks) and without treatment.\n\nThe cat is otherwise healthy and has no other neurological signs.\n\nThe otoscopic examination is unremarkable. Diagnosis is usually by exclusion of other diseases causing similar acute signs.\n\nWith currently available diagnostic techniques it may not be possible initially to differentiate this syndrome from otitis media-interna, but the vestibular signs in otitis media-interna do not usually occur so acutely and severely.\n\nIt is advisable to perform BAERs. If there is concomitant deafness, the idiopathic syndrome is ruled out as only the vestibular system should be affected.\n\nOtitis media-interna usually has a more progressive history. On otoscopic examination there may be otitis externa, mite infestation and/or a ruptured tympanic membrane. Signs of middle ear disease such as facial paresis/paralysis, decreased lacrimation and/or Horner's syndrome are often present. Radiographic changes in the tympanic bulla are rarely observed. Computed tomography and MRI scans are more sensitive for detecting changes.\n\nMiddle ear polyps can cause peripheral vestibular disturbance uni-or bilaterally but since the polyps originate from the middle ear, facial and/or sympathetic nerve deficits are present. The onset is mild and progressive. Blue-tailed lizard ingestion is believed to cause similar signs in the southeastern United States. Vomiting, salivation, irritability and trembling are also observed. Signs may be indistinguishable from idiopathic vestibular syndrome.\n\nAminoglycoside toxicity, especially topical streptomycin, can cause uni-or bilateral peripheral vestibular disturbance but the history reveals use of the drug.\n\nSupportive. In a few cats, fluid therapy, intravenously or subcutaneously, may be necessary initially.\n\nSedation (acepromazine 0.05-0.10 mg/kg IM, SC, IV to a maximum of 1 mg) may occasionally be required if the rolling is severe.\n\nAntibiotics such as amoxicillin or cephalosporine for 10 days are indicated if otitis media-interna cannot be ruled out.\n\nGlucocorticoids are not indicated.\n\nExcellent.\n\nRapid improvement of the clinical signs within the first 2 weeks in all cats.\n\nMost cats recover entirely but frequently have a mild residual head tilt.\n\n\u2022 Acute to chronic history. \u2022 Variable degree of peripheral vestibular disturbance. \u2022 Signs of otitis externa often present. \u2022 Facial paresis/paralysis, decreased lacrimation and/or Horner's syndrome often present.\n\nThe infection extends from an otitis externa or from the oro-and nasopharynx by way of the eustachian tubes, or hematogenously.\n\nMost infections are caused by Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Proteus spp., Pseudomonas spp. or Escherichia coli.\n\nFrequently, mites are the instigating factor for the otitis externa, which leads to secondary microbial infection with spread to the middle ear.\n\nThe diagnosis of otitis media-interna is difficult as, except for surgical exploration of the tympanic bulla, the tests performed have a low diagnostic yield.\n\nThe cat may have a history of chronic otitis externa. The ear may be sore to touch. There may be head shaking or scratching and frequent pawing at the ear.\n\nThere may be difficulty in prehension or chewing food due to pressure on the petrosal bone region upon jaw opening as the temporo-mandibular joint is in the vicinity of the petrosal bone.\n\nThe corner of the mouth may be wet with saliva.\n\nOn otoscopic examination, the external ear canal may be red and inflamed with a brownish discharge. Mites may be present. The tympanic membrane may be red and bulging or perforated.\n\nThe onset and the neurological deficits depend on the extension and severity of the infection. The onset of the vestibular signs may be acute with a marked head tilt, disorientation and nystagmus, or, chronic with nothing else other than a mild head tilt.\n\nThe concomitant presence of facial nerve paresis/ paralysis, decreased lacrimation and/or Horner's syndrome confirms involvement of the middle ear.\n\nThe facial weakness may be subtle. Look for a complete closure of the lids following a single stroke of the finger on both lids at once. Look for saliva-stained hair at the commissure of the lips or for a droop of the lips on the side affected. The symmetry of the pupils is best assessed in a dark room to evaluate for the presence of a partial Horner's syndrome.\n\nFacial nerve paralysis may be accompanied by keratoconjunctivitis sicca because innervation of the lacrimal glands is carried by the facial nerve. A Schirmer tear test should be routinely done in these cases to avoid the formation of corneal ulcer.\n\nUnilateral deafness is often present, but can be substantiated only with electrodiagnostic testing (BAER).\n\nOtoscopic examination may disclose an otitis externa, mite infestation or tympanic membrane bulging/perforation.\n\nIf there is an otitis externa, cytology and culture with sensitivity testing should be done. The same organism may be causing the middle-inner ear infection.\n\nThe presence of facial paresis/paralysis, decreased to absence of lacrimation or Horner's syndrome is a strong indicator of concomitant middle ear disease, but is not specific for infection.\n\nOn physical examination, there may be pain on opening the mouth or pain upon manipulation of the head.\n\n\u2022 Concomitant deafness indicates a more significant disease process such as in middle-inner ear infection, but is not specific for the disease. It is an indi-cation that a more thorough diagnostic work up should be performed. \u2022 Normal hearing does not rule out middle-inner ear infection because the auditory receptors are in the inner ear.\n\n\u2022 It is important to obtain an open mouth view to visualize both bullae simultaneously for comparison. \u2022 A normal study does not rule out middle-inner ear disease. \u2022 The tympanic bulla may appear denser if there is an effusion. \u2022 Thickening of the bulla or bone lysis may be observed in more severe and chronic infections.\n\nCytological examination and culture with sensitivity testing of the middle ear fluid is indicated when an effusion is suspected:\n\n\u2022 The myringotomy is done using an otoscope to guide a 2 1 \u20442\" spinal needle through the tympanic membrane.\n\nCT or MRI scans are superior to radiographs to confirm tympanic bulla disease, but the changes detected are not specific for infection.\n\nSurgical exploration of the middle ear with cytological examination and culture with sensitivity testing is the only definitive diagnostic tool in middle-inner ear disease.\n\nIdiopathic vestibular disease has an acute to per-acute onset in a cat that is otherwise healthy. There is no facial paresis/paralysis, decreased lacrimation, deafness or Horner's syndrome because the disease is limited to the vestibular part of the inner ear. Signs resolve over 1-2 weeks without treatment.\n\nNeoplasia and middle ear polyps can be difficult to differentiate from middle-inner ear infection without an exploratory bulla osteotomy. If a polyp is visible in the external ear canal or in the oro-nasopharynx, a diagnosis of middle ear polyp is likely.\n\nIf a bacterial middle-inner infection is suspected, early and aggressive treatment with antibiotics is best. If cul-ture and sensitivity are not available, a broad-spectrum antibiotic is chosen such as trimethoprim-sulfa, cephalosporin or a penicillinase-resistant penicillin (enrofloxacin).\n\nAntibiotic treatment should be continued for 6-8 weeks.\n\nIf otitis externa is present, the antibiotic is chosen based on the culture and sensitivity of the external ear canal. The otitis externa should be treated as well. Systemic treatment is preferable if the tympanic membrane is perforated or cannot be visualized.\n\nAvoid topical drugs that are toxic for the vestibular and/or auditory system (gentamycin, neomycin). Selamectin (Revolution\u00ae) or systemic ivermectin (200-300 \u03bcg/kg IM, SC, PO) is preferable as a miticide rather than topical treatment.\n\nCats with radiographic changes in the bullae are treated with surgical curettage of the tympanic bulla to allow drainage, followed by long-term antibiotherapy based on the culture and sensitivity obtained from the sample collected at time of surgery. If the culture is negative, a broad-spectrum antibiotic as listed above is administered for 2-4 weeks.\n\nIf there is chronic or recurrent otitis externa, ablation of the external ear canal is indicated.\n\nIn the presence of paralysis of the eyelids, artificial tears are unnecessary if tear secretion is normal as the spread of the tear film is taken over by the third eyelid. Artificial tears should be administered 2-6 times daily in the affected eye, if the Schirmer tear test is abnormal (< 10 mm/minute), to avoid development of a corneal ulcer.\n\nFacial paralysis and partial Horner's syndrome often remain, although the severity is much improved. An ipsilateral mild deviation of the face occurs over time.\n\nThe vestibular signs resolve in most cases, except for the head tilt, which frequently remains for the life of the animal.\n\nThe cases managed medically may recur and require surgical curettage at later date.\n\nTreat otitis externa effectively when it occurs.\n\nTreat ear mites.\n\n\u2022 Mild and slowly progressive head tilt.\n\n\u2022 +/respiratory signs.\n\n\u2022 +/signs of otitis externa.\n\n\u2022 +/facial paresis/paralysis, +/-Horner's syndrome +/keratoconjunctivitis sicca, +/deafness.\n\nThe pathogenesis is incompletely understood.\n\nThe polyp originates from the middle ear cavity and is composed of inflammatory granulation tissue covered by respiratory epithelium.\n\nThe instigating cause is not exactly known. Some believe that it is congenital, to explain its frequency in very young cats. Others postulate that it results from chronic inflammatory middle ear disease, secondary to upper respiratory infections. The respiratory infection would create abnormalities in the eustachian tube epithelium, resulting in poor middle ear ventilation and secondary inflammation.\n\nMost cats with middle ear polyps have a bacterial infection. The most common bacterial isolates are Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides and Pseudomonas.\n\nThe polypoid growth has a tendency to exit the middle ear cavity. It can do so by rupturing the tympanic membrane and emerging into the external ear canal, causing characteristic signs of otitis externa, or it enters the eustachian tube to exit into the nasopharynx with subsequent upper respiratory signs. The frequency of each end location versus the other is unknown.\n\nThe polypoid growth within the middle ear cavity may encroach on the inner ear leading to vestibular signs.\n\nTypically occurs in young cats, but any age can be affected (mean age 1-5 years; range 6 months to 15 years).\n\nThe most common signs associated with a middle ear polyp, which extends into the nasopharynx, are upper respiratory signs including noisy breathing, dyspnea with or without nasal discharge, sneezing or coughing and gagging.\n\nLess often are signs characteristic of otitis externa.\n\nRarely a head tilt may be present. The head tilt may occur without other signs, or with upper respiratory signs, or with a visible external ear canal polyp.\n\nSince the polyp originates within the middle ear cavity, the neurological structures of the middle ear may be affected causing facial paresis/paralysis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca and/or partial or complete Horner's syndrome. These can also occur without other signs.\n\nA mild and transient head tilt may be the only abnormality on neurological examination.\n\nThe concomitant presence of a fibrous mass in the external ear canal, or upper respiratory signs, is pathognomonic for middle ear polyp.\n\nThe concomitant presence of facial paresis/paralysis, decreased lacrimation and Horner's syndrome with a head tilt is indicative of middle and inner ear disease but is not diagnostic for the type of disease.\n\nIf there are upper respiratory signs, visualization of the polyp in the nasopharynx under anesthesia is the most efficient way of reaching a diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 A glistening, red or pinkish mass filling the nasopharynx, or originating from the eustachian tube may be found.\n\nOtoscopic examination, which may necessitate sedation/anesthesia to evaluate both ear canals and tympanic membranes should be performed.\n\n\u2022 Aural inflammation may be present.\n\n\u2022 A pedunculated red, pink or grayish mass may be observed in the ear canal.\n\nThe polyp may also affect hearing. Presence of deafness is evaluated by doing BAERs.\n\nWhen a head tilt is present and there is facial paresis/ paralysis, decreased lacrimation or a Horner's syndrome, bulla radiography is recommended to evaluate the middle ear cavities. An open mouth view is best to compare the density between the bullae. Bulla radiography is not a sensitive tool. It may be normal despite the presence of uni-or bilateral polyps. CT and MRI scans are superior in the diagnosis of middle ear cavities, and one of these scans should be performed if available.\n\nCT and MRI scans are the most sensitive imaging techniques to reach a diagnosis of middle ear disease, but are not specific for the type of disease.\n\nThe final diagnosis is obtained at the time of surgery. Surgical exploration of the middle ear is the only reliable test to reach a diagnosis. Cytology and culture and sensitivity of the curetted tissue should always be done.\n\nIf the disease process involves the middle ear, otitis media-interna, middle ear polyp and neoplasia of the middle ear cavity cannot be differentiated without biopsies taken at the time of surgical bulla exploration.\n\nRemoval of the polyp from its origin through a ventral bulla osteotomy is the best therapeutic approach to avoid recurrence. Removal by grasping the polyp and cutting it at the base from the nasopharyngeal or aural location leads to a high recurrence rate.\n\nHorner's syndrome is a frequent complication of bulla osteotomy. It resolves in most cases in 1-3 weeks, but even if it remains, it does not alter the patient's quality of life.\n\nThe head tilt, if present at onset, usually remains for the life of the patient. Occasional transient vestibular ataxia is rarely reported as a surgical sequella of polyp removal.\n\nThe cat should be treated for 6-8 weeks with an antibiotherapy based on the culture and sensitivity done at the time of surgery.\n\nminimizes the risk of recurrence. Recurrence is frequent using oral or aural access to the polyp.\n\nThe head tilt usually remains but the other vestibular signs (ataxia and nystagmus) usually resolve.\n\nIf facial paralysis is present, ipsilateral deviation of the face ensues.\n\nIf a Horner's syndrome is present, it usually improves and the residual deficit (aniscoria) is of no clinical significance.\n\n\u2022 Head tilt in a cat systemically ill for a few weeks. \u2022 Non-specific systemic signs such as fever, weight loss and lethargy. \u2022 Chronic progressive disease. \u2022 There may be neurological deficits other than a head tilt.\n\nSee main references on page 372 for details (The Pyrexic Cat).\n\nThe causative virus is a macrophage-tropic mutant of the ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus.\n\nThe clinical disease results from an immune-mediated response of the host to macrophage-infected feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). The severity of the disease is based on host susceptibility and strain virulence.\n\nAffected cats are usually less than 3 years of age and from large multiple-cat households or breeders.\n\nThe most common non-specific systemic signs are fever, weight loss and lethargy.\n\nThirty-five percent of the cats with FIP have neurological signs. These vary with the lesion location. Behavioral changes, head tremor, seizures, depression, compulsive walking and decreased menace are some of the signs that may be observed.\n\nClinically, the disease frequently appears to be focal, although this is not the case at postmortem.\n\nThe head tilt is always associated with somnolence, with or without cerebellar signs, because the cerebellum is closely situated.\n\nChorioretinitis may be present (see The Blind Cat or Cat with Retinal Lesions).\n\nThe history of a young cat originating from a multicat household or breeder, with a protracted disease, vague systemic signs and neurological abnormalities raises the index of suspicion for FIP.\n\nThe cerebrospinal fluid analysis on its own is not sensitive for a diagnosis of FIP.\n\n\u2022 Cell counts and protein concentration can be within reference range especially if the disease is focal. Typically, there is a moderate to severe pleocytosis, with mononuclear cells or neutrophils as the predominating cell type, and a marked increase in protein concentration. \u2022 Protein concentration > 2 g/L increases the likelihood of FIP.\n\nMRI scan of the brain is helpful, as frequently there is periventricular enhancement suggestive of ependymitis, and hydrocephalus with ventricular dilatation. The MRI findings are more representative of the neuropathological extent of the disease than is the clinical presentation, which is often focal in nature.\n\nHematology and chemistry abnormalities are nonspecific except for a high serum total protein concentration, which is frequent.\n\nThe anti-coronavirus IgG titer in CSF is consistently positive.\n\nThe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test detects the presence of feline coronaviruses but is not specific to FIP coronavirus.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry are techniques which appear promising for diagnosis of FIP. They use monoclonal antibody targeted against feline coronavirus to demonstrate coronavirus within macrophages in tissue or effusions. The concentration of infected monocytes in CSF fluid may make the test less sensitive for diagnosis of FIP than if used for tissue sections.\n\nAt this point in time, no single test is diagnostic for the neurological form of FIP, but when the history, signalment, serum protein concentration, CSF results, CSF serology and MRI findings are combined, an antemortem diagnosis can be reached.\n\nOther inflammatory infectious diseases of the central nervous system may produce similar neurological abnormalities. However, no other central nervous system infections are typically presented with the gamut of abnormalities mentioned above.\n\nThere is no effective treatment for FIP. Patients almost invariably die. Therapy is based on supportive care. Immunomodulating and antiviral agents seem promising in vitro but have not shown good results in cats.\n\nPoor. Most cats die of their disease from 6 weeks to 6 months after the onset of the neurological signs.\n\nSince most cats with FIP are from a multiple-cat household or breeder, adequate cleanliness is essential to prevent fecal-oral spread of virus.\n\nVaccination may be preventive.\n\n\u2022 Otitis externa initially.\n\n\u2022 Subsequent development of peripheral vestibular signs. \u2022 Swollen face. \u2022 Facial nerve paresis/paralysis and Horner's syndrome are frequent.\n\nThe most common tumor affecting the middle-inner ear is the squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor arises from the epithelial lining of the ear canal and is usually aggressive, invading the adjacent tissue (middle and inner ears) then the skull. Squamous cell carcinomas of the ear canal are most commonly presented with neurological signs.\n\nCeruminous gland adenocarcinomas are also reported with some frequency in the middle-inner ear.\n\nMiddle-aged to older cats.\n\nInitially, the signs relate to otitis externa. There is a more or less rapid progression depending on the tumor type, to cause peripheral vestibular signs, i.e., a head tilt, with or without nystagmus or vestibular ataxia.\n\nDue to the invading nature of the squamous cell carcinoma and the ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma, the facial nerve and the sympathetic chain in the middle ear are involved leading to facial paralysis, decreased lacrimation and Horner's syndrome.\n\nThere is pain when the mouth is open, which may result from involvement of the temporo-mandibular joint, soft tissue pain, microfractures (pathological), bone pain from lysis or involvement of the bulla structures.\n\nThe face may be swollen and firm on palpation.\n\nThe history of an older cat presented with a rapid onset of neurological signs relating to the inner (vestibular signs and deafness) and middle ear (facial paralysis, decreased lacrimation and Horner's syndrome) with pain upon jaw opening and a swollen face increases the index of suspicion.\n\nIn most cases, bulla radiography is diagnostic for the presence of a destructive process. There is opacity in the tympanic bulla with sclerosis and lysis of the bone. Depending on the tumor and how invasive it is, adjacent bony tissue such as the temporo-mandibular joint and the zygomatic arch may also be affected.\n\nAs in most cases of middle-inner ear disease, if there is no swelling of the face, surgical exploration of the bulla is the only reliable approach to reach a definitive diagnosis.\n\nMiddle ear polyp is usually in young cats, but can be in older cats. Typically, the progression is slower. The polyp may be visible in the ear canal or oro-nasopharynx. There is no pain, and no swelling of the face.\n\nAggressive excision including ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy is the treatment of choice for malignant ear canal tumors. If excision is incomplete, radiation therapy can be a useful adjunct to surgery.\n\nPrognosis is guarded because of the invasive nature of the tumor and advanced stage of the disease by the time neurologic signs are present.\n\nCats with ceruminous adenocarcinoma have a 75% 1-year survival rate following aggressive ear ablation and bulla osteotomy compared to a 33% 1-year survival after conservative surgical resection. The prognosis is more guarded for squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n\u2022 Acute onset of peripheral vestibular signs that develop immediately or in the 72 hours following an ear flush.\n\nThe exact pathogenesis is unknown, but several mechanisms have been postulated to be involved. An ear flush that leads to such consequences is usually done under anesthesia or heavy sedation. If the signs develop immediately after the flush, it is possibly due to: (1) a change in the temperature of the endolymph;\n\n(2) flooding of the inner ear through a perforated tympanic membrane; or (3) a toxic effect on the vestibu-lar receptors by the product used to flush the ear (e.g. chlorhexidine, quaternary ammonium compounds).\n\nhours following an ear flush, an inner ear infection is suspected. Bacteria may have been introduced through a perforated tympanic membrane at the time of the flush. The ear flush may not be vigorous for this to occur because the tympanic membrane may have already been ruptured secondary to an otitis externa. Alternatively, topical (e.g. gentamycin-containing ear drops) or systemic treatment administered after the ear flush may be toxic to the vestibular receptors.\n\nAcute onset of peripheral vestibular signs in the 72 hours following an ear flush. The flush may have been an elective procedure or therapeutic for a severe otitis externa.\n\nDiagnosis is based on the history of acute vestibular signs following a recent ear flush.\n\nIdiopathic vestibular syndrome cannot be differentiated from the iatrogenic cause if the signs appear 2-3 days following the flush.\n\nWhenever acute vestibular signs appear to be associated with an ear flush, a broad-spectrum antibiotic such as trimethoprim-sulfa, a cephalosporine or amoxicillin should be administered for 2-6 weeks.\n\nIf the onset was immediate and due to a change in the temperature or flooding of the inner ear, then the signs may disappear within a few hours.\n\nIf the signs are the result of toxicity, the head tilt may remain.\n\nIf the signs appeared 2-3 days later, most vestibular signs resolve except for the head tilt, which usually persists for the life of the animal.\n\nIf an elective ear flush is to be performed under anesthesia or with heavy sedation, ensure the tympanic membrane is intact prior to the procedure.\n\nIf the tympanic membrane cannot be visualized, use only sterile normal saline, as most ear-cleaning solutions contain components that are potentially ototoxic, such as propylene glycol, salicylic acid, malic acid, lactic acid detergents and dioctols.\n\nPerform ear flush with extreme care. Cleansing the ear with rubber bulb syringes, plastic syringes or waterjet appliances may rupture the tympanic membrane.\n\nIf the ear needs cleaning in the consultation room, avoid using solutions that are acidic or potentially ototoxic. Instead of removing the debris manually, let the animal shake its head and dislodge the debris itself after the medication had been put and massaged into the external ear canal.\n\n\u2022 Lethargic cat with a head tilt, +/ataxia, +/nystagmus. \n\nTypically, the cat has usually been ill for a few weeks prior to the development of the neurological signs.\n\nThe systemic signs may have been vague such as decreased appetite, weight loss, lethargy, or signs may relate to a specific system such as the upper respiratory tract, the skin or a combination of both.\n\nChorioretinitis may be present (see The Blind Cat or Cat With Retinal Lesions).\n\nThe development of central nervous system signs in a cat systemically ill for a few weeks or having upper respiratory tract signs and/or draining skin lesions should raise the index of suspicion for this infection.\n\nA latex agglutination test measuring the cryptococcal polysaccharide capsular antigen can be performed on the serum, cerebrospinal fluid or urine. However, negative results do not exclude the possibility of disease.\n\nThe CSF analysis is often diagnostic because the characteristic budding yeast forms are visible. This is best seen using India ink, but new methylene blue, Diff Quick, and Gram's stain preparation are adequate. Sometimes organisms are not evident, but grow when the CSF is cultured. \u2022 The CSF inflammatory response associated with\n\nCryptococcus neoformans varies greatly. The CSF may be normal to grossly abnormal with WBC counts ranging from 0 to > 500 cells \u00d7 10 6 /L (0-0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L). \u2022 In mild inflammation, lymphocytes and monocytes predominate. In severe inflammatory responses, neutrophils and occasionally eosinophils are present. \u2022 The protein concentration varies from mildly to markedly increased (> 2 g/L).\n\nIf the disease is suspected, but the organism is not visible in the CSF, CSF culture and/or serology may provide a definitive diagnosis.\n\nCats may be simultaneously positive for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and/or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), increasing their susceptibility to infection.\n\nCryptococcosis cannot be differentiated from feline infectious peritonitis in cats presented with a protracted illness and vague systemic signs on history, physical and neurological examination alone. If Cryptococcus organisms are not visible, culture or serology may be necessary to establish the diagnosis.\n\nFluconazole is the drug of choice because of its broad antifungal spectrum, its meningeal penetration even in the absence of inflammation, and the fact that serious side effects are uncommon. The recommended dose is 10 mg/kg/day divided twice daily for a period that extends beyond the resolution of all signs by 2-3 months. The drug should be given with food.\n\nKetoconazole should not be used. It does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier effectively and is hepatotoxic.\n\nSee page 26 (The Cat With Signs of Chronic Nasal Disease) for further details on treatment of cryptococcosis.\n\n\u2022 Bilateral vestibular signs, i.e., a characteristic ventro-flexion of the neck associated with a crouched body posture and reluctance to move. \u2022 Bilateral pupillary dilatation with poor light reflexes.\n\nThiamine is a co-enzyme in the oxidative metabolism for energy production in the central nervous system. Thiamine deficiency typically produces lesions (polioencephalomalacia) in the brainstem gray matter and more specifically in the vestibular, oculomotor and lateral geniculate nuclei. Focal, bilaterally symmetric hemorrhages are present in affected areas.\n\nThe deficiency occurs in cats that are fed an uncooked all-fish diet (due to the thiaminase content of the viscera), diets entirely made of cooked meat (where the thiamine is destroyed by heating), poor-quality thiamine-deficient commercial diets, or commercial food stored for long periods of time or in excessively hot conditions. In addition, the meat preserver sodium metabisulfite releases sulfur dioxide, which destroys thiamine. Pet mince meat containing this preserver is thiamine-deficient, and even when mixed with other food may have sufficient preserver to destroy all dietary thiamine.\n\nAnorexia in a sick cat especially associated with polydipsia and polyuria or fluid diuresis may precipitate thiamine deficiency and complicate the primary illness.\n\nLethargy and decreased appetite, sometimes with increased salivation, occur after 2-4 weeks on a deficient diet.\n\nThe cat has an inability or a reluctance to walk and therefore may appear weak. This is associated with a characteristic rigid ventro-flexion of the neck, a crouched body posture and loss of righting responses.\n\nThere is bilateral mydriasis with poor light reflexes from the involvement of the oculomotor and geniculate lateral nuclei.\n\nPhysiologic nystagmus is poor to absent.\n\nBrief episodes of opisthotonus or neck ventroflexing and muscle rigidity may appear like seizures.\n\nBradycardia, and marked sinus arrhythmia may also occur.\n\nIf untreated, the cat becomes comatose and dies. The time of death varies from 1 week to a few weeks to months depending on the health status of the animal and the amount of thiamine in the diet.\n\nDiagnosis is based on a combination of a history that the cat has been quiet and anorexic, signs of a characteristic posture with poor to absent physiologic nystagmus indicative of bilateral vestibular disease and documentation of a thiamine-deficient diet (usually large quantities of uncooked fish).\n\nRapid response (within 24 hours) to treatment confirms the diagnosis.\n\nIn bilateral idiopathic vestibular syndrome, the cat is healthy just prior to the development of the clinical signs. Thiamine-deficient cats are typically lethargic and anorexic.\n\nInjectable thiamine at 10-20 mg intramuscularly. For supplementation, give 5-30 mg/cat/day PO to a maximum of 50 mg/cat/day.\n\nPrognosis is good if treatment is given early when the only clinical signs are bilateral vestibular signs.\n\nPrognosis is poor in the late stage of the disease when the animal's consciousness is significantly altered.\n\n\u2022 Siamese, Himalayan and white tiger cats.\n\n\u2022 Pendular nystagmus, i.e., the phase of the nystagmus is equal on both sides. \u2022 Present from birth.\n\nTypically, the nystagmus has a rapid, short and oscillatory motion that is equal bilaterally. It is observed especially when the cat is fixing its gaze.\n\nThe defect is within the visual pathways and not the vestibular pathways. No obvious visual impairment is present.\n\nThe nystagmus is always congenital and is evident in the first few weeks of life.\n\nIt occurs primarily in Siamese, Himalayan and white tiger cats.\n\nMedial strabismus is usually simultaneously present.\n\nDiagnosis is based on the characteristic oscillatory nystagmus.\n\n\u2022 Altered consciousness and head tilt after a recent accident. \u2022 +/-Facial nerve paresis/paralysis and Horner's syndrome. \u2022 +/-Signs of brainstem involvement such as proprioceptive deficits.\n\nSudden onset of head tilt associated with somnolence or stupor following a road accident or other trauma that caused a fracture at the base of the skull affecting the petrosal and ethmoid bones.\n\nFacial paresis/paralysis and/or Horner's syndrome may be present if there is hemorrhage in the middle ear.\n\nIf the injury is primarily intracranial, facial paresis/paralysis and/or ipsilateral proprioceptive deficits may be present.\n\nOn otoscopic examination, blood may be observed in the ear canal.\n\nHistory of a road accident.\n\nBrain auditory-evoked responses (BAER) may be helpful in localizing the lesion to mainly a peripheral or central location.\n\nSurvey radiographs of the skull are difficult to interpret because of the juxtaposition of multiple structures.\n\n\u2022 Unilateral or bilateral peripheral vestibular signs, following the use of drugs that are toxic for the vestibular receptors. \u2022 Concomitant deafness is frequent.\n\nMultiple drugs cause damage to the vestibular and/or auditory receptors separately or simultaneously.\n\nAminoglycosides especially streptomycin, chloramphenicol, chlorhexidine, cisplatin, furosemide, salicylates and ceruminolytic agents are a few of a long list of agents that may cause damage to these receptors.\n\nToxicity occurs following systemic or topical administration.\n\nThe vestibular signs are peripheral and can be unilateral, or bilateral.\n\nThe signs may develop acutely following exposure to a high dose or after prolonged administration (> 14 days). Cats with renal dysfunction are at risk because decreased renal excretion of many drugs results in higher plasma concentrations.\n\nThe vestibular signs may disappear following discontinuation of the drug.\n\nThe history of use of a drug potentially toxic for the vestibular receptors, topically or systemically.\n\nThe vestibular signs may appear immediately following an ear flush, or following topical treatment with a toxic medication, in a cat that has a perforated tympanic membrane.\n\nAvoid using any medication in the external ear canal if the tympanic membrane is perforated or cannot be visualized. This includes ceruminolytic agents and detergents.\n\n\u2022 Unilateral or bilateral vestibular signs present at birth or developing in the first 12 weeks of life. \u2022 Siamese, Burmese and Tonkinese cats. \u2022 Head tilt and tipping or rolling.\n\nReported in Siamese, Burmese and Tonkinese cats.\n\nUsually unilateral vestibular signs, but can be bilateral.\n\nHead tilt with tipping, rolling or falling developing at birth or in the first 12 weeks of life. The head tilt can be marked and may vary with time.\n\nThe clinical signs are non-progressive and decrease in severity with time, but usually persist for life.\n\nDiagnosis is based on characteristic signs in a kitten from a susceptible breed.\n\n\u2022 Southeastern United States. \u2022 Unilateral peripheral vestibular signs following the ingestion of a blue-tailed lizard. \u2022 The cat also salivates, vomits, trembles and is irritable.\n\nAcute onset of unilateral peripheral vestibular disturbance following ingestion of the blue-tailed lizard. The syndrome has not been well substantiated.\n\nVarying degrees of vestibular signs associated with salivation, vomiting, trembling and irritability.\n\nDeath may occur.\n\nAcute onset of unilateral peripheral vestibular signs in a cat living in southeastern United States with access to lizards. Signs are indistinguishable from the idiopathic vestibular syndrome although salivation, vomiting and trembling are less common with the idiopathic disease."}
