{"title": "Cloning and Sequencing of the Matrix Protein (M) Gene of Turkey Rhinotracheitis Virus Reveal a Gene Order Different from That of Respiratory Syncytial Virus", "body": "Turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV), as the name indicates, was first isolated from turkeys with respiratory disease, although it has subsequently been shown that chickens and other domestic birds can also be infected (McDougall and Cook, 1986; Jones et a/., 1987; ; and references in Yu et a/., 1991) . Biochemical analysis of the TRTV-induced proteins Ling and Pringle, 1988; Cavanagh and Barrett, 1988) and RNAs (Cavanagh and Barrett, 1988) suggested that this virus was a member of the Paramyxoviridae family and more closely related to the genus Pneumovirus (subfamily Pneumovirinae; Pringle, 1991) than to the other two genera in this family, Morbilhkus and f'aramyxovirus (subfamily Paramyxovirinae). Our recent cloning and sequencing of the TRTV fusion (F) protein gene has ' To whom reprints requests should be addressed. supported this view. Thus the TRTV F protein had 39% amino acid identity with that of human respiratory syncytial (RS)virus, a pneumovirus, but only about half that with members of the other two genera (Vu eta/., 1991) . In order to identify the gene upstream (3'proximal) from the F gene, we have used an oligonucleotide, based on the F gene sequence, to prime cDNA synthesis in the hope that some clones would be generated from polycistronic mRNA which comprised F and the 3'proximal gene. This was indeed the case, although the gene adjacent to the 3' terminus of the F gene was not that which had been expected from knowledge of the gene order of RS virus and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) (Collins et a/., 1984; Chambers et al., 1990) .\n\nThe TRTV strain used for cloning was 3BV, plaquepurified clone Rl. 1, this being the UK/3B/85 field iso-late (McDougall and Cook, 1986 ) after passage in cell culture (Vu et a/., 1991) . This virus was propagated in Vero cells (ATCC No. CCL 81; Flow Laboratories, Irvine, Scotland) . The South African TRTV strains SA/9 11 78 and SA/2381/88 and strain UW8544/85 were grown in chick embryo tracheal organ cultures (Cook et a/., 1976) . The coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), strain Beaudette, was grown in Vero cells.\n\nFlasks (75 cm') of Vero cells were inoculated with 1 ml of undiluted TRTV strain 3BV working stock which resulted in the infection of less than 1% of the cells. After 72 hr at 37\" actinomycin D (1 pg/ml; Sigma) was added and 24 hr later the cells were lysed by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (1987) except that isopropanol was substituted by ethanol. Poly(A)+ RNA was selected using Hybond mAP affinity paper according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham International). RNA of strains SA/91/78, U1</8544/85, and SAI 2381/88 was extracted from 60 tracheal organ culture rings, using guanidinium isothiocyanate, which had been infected 3 days previously. Virions of TRTV-3BV were prepared by centrifugation of clarified medium from infected Vero cells at 35,000 g,,, for 90 min in a Sorvall TFA-20.250 angle rotor. Nucleocapsids were sedimented from Nonidet P-40-produced extracts of infected Vero cells (Ward et al., 1983) at 100,000 g,,, for 40 min in a Sorvall TH641 swing-out rotor. The genomic RNA of both virions and nucleocapsids was extracted using guanidinium isothiocyanate.\n\nIBV-Beaudette mRNAs were extracted from Vero cells by the same method.\n\nPreparation of cDNA cDNA synthesis was performed with a cDNAsynthesis kit (Amersham) using the poly(A)+ RNAfrom approximately two 75-cm2 flasks of infected cells. Reverse transcription was primed using a synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 531-547 of the TRTV F gene (Vu et al., 1991). Cloning and sequencing cDNA was cloned into EcoRV-cut phagemid pBluescript KS (Northumbria Biologicals, Cramlington, Northumbria, UK). Colonies containing TRTV-specific inserts were identified by probing with a 32P-labeled, random hexanucleotide (Pharmacia)-primed probe corresponding to a region (398 nucleotides long) near the 3' part of the F gene, generated by Pstl restriction of clone F17 (Yu er al., 1991) . The clones, in pBluescript, were sequenced by dideoxy chain termination follow-ing the generation of a nested set of deletions, as described by Yu et a/. (1991) . Briefly, the recombinant phagemid was digested within the polylinker either with BstXl and Xbal or with Apal and HindIll (Boehringer-Mannheim) to generate deletions from opposite ends and deletions generated with exonuclease III (Northumbria Biologicals). Sequences were analyzed on a MicroVAX 3600 computer system using the Wisconsin program GAP.\n\nThe PCR was performed essentially as described by Sambrook eta/. (1989) using genomic RNAfrom virions and nucleocapsids in the case of strain UW3BV/85 and total infected tracheal organ culture RNA for the other three TRTV strains. Reverse transcription was done with 2 units of AMV reverse transcriptase (Anglia Biotechnology, Colchester, UK); cDNA was amplified using 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Boehringer-Mannheim) in 25 cycles, the polymerization step lasting for 5 or 15 min, as described under Results. Two microliters from the 80-~1 reaction volume was analyzed in 19'0 agarose gels, run at 100 V for 2 hr, and stained with ethidium bromide (5 pg/ml).\n\nThe positions of the 25-mer oligonucleotides (Severn Biotech, Kidderminster, UK) used for priming DNA synthesis are shown in Fig. 2 . Oligonucleotide A (positive sense) corresponded to nucleotides 604-629 of the M sequence (Fig. 3) . Oligonucleotide B (negative sense) corresponded to nucleotides 53-78 in the F gene (Vu et al., 1991) . Oligonucleotide C (positive sense), which corresponded to part of the gene upstream (3') from the M gene, had its 5' terminus 237 nucleotidesfrom the beginning of the M gene. Oligonucleotide D (negative sense) corresponded to nucleotides 54-79 of the M sequence (Fig. 3 ).\n\nThe 5' terminus of the M mRNA was determined by primer extension using a 25-mer oligonucleotide (oligonucleotide D) complementary to nucleotides 54-79 of the M mRNA sequence shown in Fig. 3 . The primer was 5' end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [y-32P]ATP. The primer (100 ng, 5 X 1 O4 cpm) was added to 15 pg of total infected cell extract RNA or 4 pg of poly(A)+ RNA from infected cells. Reverse transcription was performed as described previously (Cavanagh and Davis, 1988) . The same oligonucleotide was used to prime a sequencing reaction (Vu et al., 1991) using pBluescript containing insert MF36 as substrate. All reactions were analyzed in the same sequencing gel so that the 5' terminus of the M mRNA could be deduced directly by comparison with the sequence determined from clone MF36. The 5' terminus of the F mRNA was mapped in the same way using oligonucleotide B, whose 5'terminus was located 78 nucleotides from the presumed start of the F mRNA, and using pBluescript containing insert MF37.\n\nPolycistronic mRNAs of TRTV were detected by Northern blot analysis (Sambrook et a/., 1989 ) using a restriction fragment in the case of M and a PCR product of F to make random hexanucleotide-primed 32P-labeled probes. IBV-Beaudette mRNAs, all of which have been sequenced (Boursnell et al., 1987) , were used as RNA size markers. The IBV-specific probe comprised a complete cDNA copy of the nucleocapsid (N) gene of IBV, produced by the PCR. All IBV mRNAs were detected by this probe because all the mRNAs contain the N gene at their 3'end (Boursnell et al., 1987) . TRTV mRNAs were electrophoresed before and after selection of poly(A)+ RNA; IBV RNAs were used without poly(A)+ selection. Before transfer of the RNA to nitrocellulose, the gel was exposed to uv light (302 nm) (Ultra-Violet Products, Inc., U.S.A.) for 2 min to nick the RNA sufficiently to improve the transfer of genome and anti-genome TRTV RNA and the large IBV mRNAs.\n\nThe sequence of the M mRNA (nucleotides l-824 in Fig. 3 ) will appear in the DDBJ, EMBL, and Genbank Nucleotide Sequence Databases underAccession No. X58639.\n\nCloning and sequencing of the gene 3' proximal to the F gene In order to identify the gene upstream (3' proximal) from the F gene, an F gene-specific oligonucleotide was used to generate cDNA from poly(A)+-infected cell RNA, and clones were selected using a radiolabeled F gene restriction fragment. This strategy was based on the knowledge, gained from probing Northern blots of infected cell RNA with F gene-specific probes, that polycistronic mRNAs were generated during transcription ( Fig. 1 , lanes 3 and 5) and the hope that some of these mRNAs contained F and the upstream gene. Six clones were obtained, two of which did not extend beyond the 5' terminus of the F mRNA. The remaining four clones did extend into the 3' proximal gene; indeed two of them continued into a furthergene (Fig. 2) . Unexpectedly one clone (MF35) extended 622 nucleotides FIG. 1. Northern blots showing mono-and polycistronic TRTV mRNAs containtng M and F gene seque-Ices. RNA was extracted from TRTV-Infected (lanes 3. 5, 7, and 9) a Id mock-infected (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) Vero cells and electrophoresed in a denaturing agarose gel before (lanes 2, 3, 6, and 7) and after (lanes 4, 5, 8, and 9) poly(A)+ selection. The poly(A)+-selected RNA migrated slightly faster than the nonselected RNA. After transfer to nitrocellulose the RNAs were probed with a TRTV F-specific (lanes 2-5) and M-specific (lanes 6-9) DNA probe. Lane 1 contains IBV mRNAs, the sizes (kilobases) of which are shown on the left. The monocistronic M and F mRNAs are identified by M and F, respectively, and dicrstronic M-F mRNA by MF. The positions of other polycistronic mRNAs and genome-sized RNA are shown by filled circles, beyond the primer in the direction of the 5'end of the F gene, to nucleotide position 1170 in the F gene sequence (Vu et a/., 1991). Every nucleotide of the gene 3' proximal to F was sequenced from at least two clones; 83% were sequenced from three clones. The entire sequence was determined from both strands of the cDNA and 96% of nucleotides were determined 5 to 16 times and the remaining 4% on 3 or 4 occasions.\n\nThe M gene is adjacent to the 3' end of the F gene of TRTV As described above the identity of the gene sequences contained within each clone was ascertained by sequencing. Clones MF35 and 36 encoded a large ORF of 254 amino acids. The next longest ORF would encode an ORF of only 51 residues, other ORFs being less than half that size. Comparison of the sequence of the longest ORF with a databank of Paramyxoviridae sequences revealed that it had 37% amino acid identity with the M protein of RS virus which comprises 256 residues (Fig. 3) . The calculated molecular weights of the M protein for TRTV and RS virus were 27,595 and 28,7 14, respectively. Almost immediately upstream from the beginning of the ORF was the sequence GGGACAAGU (nucleotides l-9, doubly underlined in Fig. 3 ) which was identical to the sequence just upstream from the F ORF (nucleotides 827-835, doubly underlined in Fig. 3 ) which we have suggested is the start sequence for the F mRNA (Vu et al., 1991) . Confirmation that these sequences did mark the beginnings of the M and F mRNAs was obtained by mapping the 5' end of the respective mRNAs. Gene-specific oligonucleotides were 5' endlabeled and then used for primer extension. Both the M and the F primer-extended products terminated to yield a double band, consistent with the ends of the respective mRNAs having been reached (Fig. 4) . The same end-labeled oligonucleotides were used in sequencing reactions, with [35S]ATP present, with pBluescript containing either the M or the F cDNA inserts. Electrophoresis of the reaction products in the same gels as those used for analysis of the cDNA generated by primer extension showed that the lower band of the doublet comigrated with a G residue which was the beginning of the sequence GGGACAAGU. This was direct evidence that nucleotides l-9 and 827-835 (Fig. 3) marked the beginning of the M and F mRNAs, respectively. The upper band of the doublet, which was sometimes of lower intensity, was considered most likely to be an artifact, as proposed previously (Jorgensen et al., 1987) . The presence of partial cross-banding in the pBluescript-generated sequence was a consequence of the presence of some n -1 oligonucleotide in the primer preparations.\n\nAt the end of the TRTV F mRNA is the sequence AGUUA followed three nucleotides later by the poly(A) tail (Vu et a/., 1991). Immediately prior to the start of the F gene, i.e., near the end of the M sequence, was the similar sequence AGUCA (nucleotides 8 12 to 8 16, singly underlined, in Fig. 3 ) followed two nucleotides later by AIWWAUU.\n\nThis observation, coupled with the identification of the 5'terminus of the F mRNA (Fig. 4B) , indicates that these sequences mark the end of the M mRNA, the UU residues being the M-F intergenic region (in the mRNA sense). Thus nucleotides 1 and 824 in Fig. 3 define the termini of the TRTV M mRNA.\n\nNorthern blots of TRTV-infected cell RNA, before and after selection of poly(A)+ RNA, were probed with F-and M-specific probes. In addition to the monocistronic F mRNA the F probe hybridized to an mRNA of approximately 2.63 kb (Fig. 1 , lanes 3 and 5; size estimated using IBV mRNAs as markers), a mRNA of this length also being revealed by the M-specific probe (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 9) . The size estimate of 2.63 kb is close to that of 2.56 kb predicted for a M-F dicistronic mRNA based on the sequences for M and F of TRTV and assuming a poly(A) tail of approximately 100 nucleotides. The probes also detected small amounts of several other mRNA species and some genome-sized RNA; Afzal et al. (1990) detected both genome and anti-genome in poly(A)+-selected mumps virus RNAs. TRTV clones MF35 and MF36, which extended into the gene upstream from M, could have been generated from one or more of these additional RNA species.\n\nPCR evidence that the TRTV M gene is adjacent to the F gene From the Northern blot analysis it was most likely that clones MF34-37 had been generated by reverse transcription of polycistronic mRNAs which faithfully reflected the gene order of the M and F genes in the genome. However, it was possible that in the TRTV genome there were one or more genes between M and F and that during the synthesis of our cDNA clones there might have been a fault leading to the deletion of intervening genes. Alternatively the virus RNA preparation may have contained deletion genomes which produced defective RNAfrom which the cDNAs were generated, although we have no evidence for the existence of such RNA. To investigate these possibilities we have used the PCR to generate cDNA, using UK/ 3BV/85 virion RNA as template, covering the proposed M-F junction. First oligonucleotides A and B (Fig. 2 (6) F mRNA by primer extension. (A) An end-labeled 25-mer oligonucleotide whose 5' end corresponded to nucleotide position 79 in Fig. 3 was used to prime extension on M mRNA present in poly(A)+-selected TRTVinfected Vero cell RNA. The same end-labeled oligonucleotide was used to prime a sequencing reaction using pBluescript containing insert MF36 as substrate. All reactions were analyzed in a 6% acrylamide sequencing gel. Primer extension of the M mRNA produced a product which migrated as a double band (right hand side four lanes), the lower of which comigrated with the first nucleotide G in the sequence GGGACAAGU derived from pBluescript containing clone MF36. (B) A 25-mer, end-labeled oligonucleotide whose 5'end was located 78 nucleotides from the presumed start of the F mRNA was used to prime extension on F mRNA present in poly(A)+-selected RNA. The oligonucleotide was also used to prime a sequencing reaction using pBluescript containing insert MF37 as substrate. Primer extension of the F mRNA produced a product which migrated as a double band (right hand side four lanes), the lower of which comigrated with the first base of the sequence GGGACAAGU. This confirmed that the sequence GGGACAAGU was at the start of both the M and the F mRNAs.\n\nTaken together these results strongly support the view that the M and F genes of TRTV occur in the genome in the order 3'-M-F-5'. 377) possessed by paramyxoviruses (Chambers et al., 1986; McGinnes and Morrison, 1987; Sato et al., 1987; Blumberg ef a/., 1984; Spriggs et al., 1987; Luk et a/., 1987; Galinski et al., 1987; Sakai et al., 1987; Sheshberadaran and Lamb, 1990; Elliott et al., 1989; Elango, 1989) and morbilliviruses (Bellini et al., 1986; Limo and Yilma, 1990) . Second, the M protein hydropathy plots for TRTV and RS virus are remarkably similar (Fig. 6) .\n\nThe Wisconsin program GAP revealed that the M protein of TRTV had 37% amino acid identity with that of RS virus and 17-2 1% with members of the other two genera. However, this figure of 17-2 1 O/O tends to exaggerate the extent to which the M proteins of the pneumoviruses resemble those of the other two genera since 7-l 1 gaps had to be inserted in order to produce even this low level of alignment.\n\nThe M protein of paramyxoviruses forms an ordered array at the inner surface of the virion envelope (Heggeness eta/., 1982; Buechi and Bachi, 1982) and plays an important role in the virus maturation process, the protein being believed to interact with the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) (Mountcastle et a/., 1974; Shimizu and Ishida, 1975; Yoshida et a/., 1976) (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) . Each point on the profile represents the average hydropathy of a span of five residues. face of the plasma membrane at areas associated with the viral glycoproteins (Caldwell and Lyles, 1986; Peeples and Bratt, 1984; Faaberg and Peeples, 1988) and actin (Giuffre eta/., 1982; Bohn eta/., 1986) . In addition M has a role in regulating viral transcription (Marx eta/., 1974) . The many interactions of M are believed to involve complex interactions of both hydrophobic and ionic natures (Caldwell and Lyles, 1986; Faaberg and Peeples, 1988) . As for morbilliviruses and paramyxoviruses (Chambers et a/., 1986; Galinski et al., 1987; Limo and Yilma, 1990 ) the hydropathy plots for TRTV and RS virus indicate that the M protein is moderately hydrophobic. While none of the sequences are obvious candidates for membrane-spanning structures, both TRTV and RS virus have a highly hydrophobic sequence of 14 residues centering around amino acid 200 (Figs. 3 and 6 ). This stretch in particular might be membrane associated. Bellini et a/. (1986) have drawn attention to a sequence of 13 to 14 largely nonpolar residues situated about 90 residues from the carboxy terminus of the M protein of the morbilliviruses which might interact with the lipid environment of the virus envelope. With respect to ionic interactions the M proteins of paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses are basic in nature, basic and acidic residues accounting for 12-14 and 896, respectively, of M residues. Many (12-l 6) of the basic residues occur in pairs. In contrast, TRlV and RS virus M proteins have only a small preponderance of basic over acidic residues, these residues accounting for 9-l 1 and 8-9%, respectively, of total residues. TRTV and RS virus have only 6 and 2 basic resi-dues, respectively, in pairs (Satake and Venkatesan, 1984) . TRTV M protein does resemble that of the other two genera in that the amino terminal one-third of M has an acidic character, TRTV M having 7 and 2 acidic and basic residues, respectively, in this region. However, this is not a general observation for pneumoviruses as RS virus has almost equal numbers of acid and basic residues (8 and 7, respectively) in the first third of the molecule (Satake and Venkatesan, 1984) .\n\nAll paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses examined to date have the partial gene order 3'-M-F-(SH)-HN/H-5'; SH is in parentheses to indicate that this gene is not possessed by all viruses in these genera. In contrast two pneumoviruses, human RS virus and PVM, have the equivalent genes in the order 3'-M-SH-G-F-5'; i.e., they have, unlike the other two genera, the SH and cell attachment protein gene(G) on the 3'side of the F gene (Collins et a/., 1984; Chambers et a/., 1990) . It was a surprise, therefore, when we found that TRTV had the M gene immediately adjacent to the 3' side of the F gene. There was no evidence from probing Northern blots that TRTV UK/3BV/85 had generated defective RNA which might have had genes deleted between M and F. Even if such defective RNA had been present, then in order to generate clones MF34-37 the deletion event would have had to be such as to delete genes in their entirety while at the same time preserving completely intact the M gene and the beginning of F. We have confirmed the beginning of both the M and the F mRNAs by 5' mapping and have shown that M has mRNA start and end sequences very similar to those of F. The PCR data supported the gene order deduced from clones MF34-37. Although the PCR would tend to favor the amplification of small products, e.g., the 300-nucleotide product obtained using oligonucleotide pairs A/B, over larger ones, e.g., the product which would have been obtained if there had been a gene between M and F, there was no sign at all of larger PCR products to substantiate the view that there was a gene between M and F. Moreover, the gene order M-F was further supported by the PCR data obtained with three other TRlV strains, representing isolates from two continents, isolated over a 1 O-year period, which had different passage histories, and which had been propagated in chicken tracheal organ cultures.\n\nAlthough the M protein of TRTV is clearly more closely related to that of RS virus than to that of the other two genera, the amino acid identity was only 379/o. This is similar to the amino acid identity shared between the morbilliviruses and the human and bovine parainfluenza virus 3/Sendai virus group of paramyxoviruses, whereas within the morbillivirus genus the amino acid identity is about 75% (Rima, 1989) . This suggests that the evolutionary pathways of TRTV and RS virus diverged before those of members of the morbillivirus genus.\n\nThe subfamily Pneumovirinae is of particular interest because, based on the analysis of the genomes of human RS virus and PVM, the member viruses contain several genes that are not present in species of the Paramyxovirinae subfamily (Collins et a/., 1984; Chambers et al., 1990) . Given that TRTV has some pneumovirus characteristics but appears to have diverged a considerable time ago from the other known members of this genus, further analysis of the number, nature, and order of TRTV genes will be instructive with regard to whether those genes currently known to be unique to the pneumovirus genus are essential for replication. In addition, study of TRTV may help to clarify the evolutionary relationships between the genera of the Paramyxoviridae family."}
