The sequence at their 5 termini which is identical to the sequences from 56 to 436 upstream of the 3 terminus sequence of genomic RNA at the 5 end. Several models of the genome [excluding the poly(A) tail] are thought to of discontinuous transcription have been described to play a role in the synthesis of plus-stranded RNA, alexplain the mechanism of MHV RNA synthesis (Brian et though the mechanism by which this occurs is not clear. al., 1994; Lai, 1990; Sawicki and Our approach to studying MHV RNA replication is to Sawicki, 1990; Schaad and Baric, 1994; identify the cis-acting signals for RNA replication and the 1988). In all of these models, the initial step in MHV RNA proteins which recognize these signals at the 3 end of replication is the synthesis of negative-strand RNA from genomic RNA of MHV. We have focused our attention a positive-strand genomic template. Thus, transcription on the 3 end of MHV genome as it is likely that the 3 region contains sequences necessary for viral RNA polymerase binding, either alone or in combination with quence (UGAAUGAAGUU) were tested for the ability to form complexes with uninfected and MHV, strain JHM (MHV-JHM)-infected cytoplasmic extracts.

The protocol developed for the quantitative analysis of negative-strand DI RNA by competitive RT-PCR is based on a previously reported method with some minor modifications (Dukas et al., 1993) . The 5 positive-sense primer was identical to the primer used for cDNA synthesis; the sequence of the 3 negative-sense primer was 5-GTG ATT CTT CCA ATT GGC-3, which binds to nt 18 to 1 from the 3 end of viral genome, yielding a 615-bp PCR fragment of DI RNA.

Furthermore, no bands corresponding to Precise localization of host protein binding motif at the complexes were observed when the 84-16 probe the 3 end of JHM genomic RNA alone was digested with RNase T 1 in the absence of cytoplasmic extract (Fig. 2, lane 1) . To more precisely localize the protein-binding element we had previously identified within the last 42 nt of the These results, coupled with our previous report that protein-binding activity of the mG1 probe was only 9-10% of the wild-type 84-16 probe. Less extensive mutations within this 11-nt sequence, such as those contained in the mB4, mC5, and mF0 RNA probes, resulted in variable decreases in RNA-protein complex formation (Fig.  3B , lanes 4 to 12). The mB4 RNA expressed 39% of the protein-binding activity seen with the wild-type RNA, while the mC5 RNA with a mutation of the last 6-nt GAA-GUU sequence maintained 90% of the protein-binding activity (Fig. 1B) . However, the contribution of this sequence to protein binding could be observed when this mutation (mC5) was combined with the mutation contained in mB4 (mF0). The mF0 RNA had 17% of the wildtype activity, considerably less than that observed with either of the mutant RNA probes (mB4 and mC5) carrying induced cross-linking\n\nTo characterize the proteins bound to the wild-type the 84-43 RNA did not have any protein-binding activity and mutant RNA probes and determine their molecular (Yu and Leibowitz, 1995) , mapped a protein-binding eleweights, 32 P label was transferred from RNA probes to ment to a 19-nt sequence from nt 42 to 24 at the 3 end of JHM genomic RNA. These 19 nt include an 11nt sequence motif, UGARNGAAGUU (Fig. 1) , which is conserved in both the MHV upstream (171-85) and the downstream (42-1) protein-binding regions (Yu and Leibowitz, 1995) . To investigate whether this 11-nt sequence is responsible for host protein binding, we compared the ability of wild-type (the 84-16 RNA) and a set of mutant RNA probes to form RNA-protein complexes in the presence of cytoplasmic extracts from mock-and MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells. A series of cDNAs corresponding to nt 84 to 16 of the wild-type sequence or the mutations shown in Fig. 1 was put under the control of the T7 promoter by PCR. 32 P-labeled RNA probes were transcribed from these templates with T7 RNA polymerase; 2 the entire 11-nt sequence had been mutated (Fig. 3A, respectively; lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12, 84-16, mB4, mC5, and mF0 probes incubated with JHM-infected lysates, respectively. lanes 5 and 6). Quantitative analysis indicated that the preparations of cytoplasmic extract the 55-kDa protein is barely observed in the complex (compare lanes 2 in Figs. 4A and 4B ).\n\nHaving identified the 11-nt sequence at position 36-26 nt as a required motif in the 3 protein-binding element, we investigated the role this protein-binding motif might play in the viral life cycle, particularly in RNA replication. The plasmid DE25, which carries a 2.2-kb cDNA insert of the MHV-JHM DI RNA DIssE (Makino and Lai, 1989) , elected to use this assay rather than an assay based 4, 7, and 10, free 84-16, mB4, mC5, and mF0 probes in the absence of on hybridization to avoid potential confusion from inputcell lysates; lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11, 84-16, mB4, mC5, and mF0 probes transfected RNA. No DI RNA was observed when host incubated with mock-infected lysates, respectively; lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12, 84-16, mB4, mC5, and mF0 probes incubated with JHM-infected cells were only infected with helper virus in the absence lysates, respectively. of transfected DE25 derived RNA (Fig. 5A, lane 1) . Replication of wild-type DE25 and mG1 DI RNA was easily detected (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3) , while replication of proteins bound directly to these RNAs by UV irradiation. After limited RNase T 1 digestion, RNA binding reaction mB4 and mC5 DI RNA was at barely observable levels (Fig. 5A, lanes 4 and 5) . mixtures were irradiated with UV for 30 min and then completely digested with RNase A. Proteins to which 32 P The levels of positive-strand DI RNAs replication for the experiment shown in Fig. 5A were measured as de-label was transferred by UV cross-linking were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).

The RNA-protein complex formed with the 84-16 RNA con-a GAAGUU mutation in positions 31-26 nt) were 63, 28, and 21% of wild-type DE25 RNA (Fig. 5C ). The replication tains approximately four host polypeptides, a highly labeled protein of 120 kDa, and three minor species with level of mG1 RNA which carried a completely mutagenized 11-nt motif was higher than that of either mB4 or sizes of 103, 81, and 55 kDa (Figs. 4A, and Fig. 4B, lanes  2 and 3) . Incubation of mG1 RNA probe, which contained mC5 RNAs containing partial mutations of this motif, a result which surprised us. As coronaviruses undergo re-an 11-nt mutation, with cell lysates, decreased the amount of the 103-and 80-kDa proteins in the complex combination at high frequency (Liao and Lai, 1992) , we determined if the mG1 RNA sequence was maintained to undetectable levels, and strongly reduced the binding of the 120-kDa protein (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 5) . The pro-or if the replicated mutant DI RNA had been converted to the wild-type RNA sequence. cDNAs were synthesized tein profiles of RNA-protein complexes formed with mB4 and mF0 RNA probes were similar to that of mG1 probe using a reverse-transcription primer complementary to negative-strand DI RNA and RNA templates prepared (Fig. 4B, lanes 5, 6, 11, and 12) , while the protein profile of the complex formed with mC5 probe was similar to from each of the transfections described above; these cDNAs were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. that of wild-type 84-16 probe (Fig. 4B, lanes 8 and 9) . The 55-kDa protein seems to be a relatively nonspecific As indicated in Fig. 5B , transcription of negative-strand RNA from each transfected DI RNA, DE25, mG1, mB4, binding protein; its presence in the complex seems not affected by mutations which decrease the binding of the and mC5 (lanes 2 to 5), was observed, but not from RNA isolated from nontransfected JHM-infected cells (lane 1). other proteins in the complex. In addition, with some almost reached the level of wild-type DE25 RNA (lanes 4 to 5). Quantitative analysis indicated that replication of positive-strand mG1 RNA was reduced to 27% of that observed for DE25 RNA, while mB4 and mC5 RNA replication was 96 and 89% of DE25, respectively (Fig. 6C) . These results differed from those shown in Fig. 5 , where the replication of mB4 and mC5 RNA were strongly reduced relative to wild type, while mG1 RNA replication was only moderately decreased compared to DE25 RNA. Again, RT-PCR demonstrated the synthesis of negativestrand DI RNA from each transfected DI RNA (Fig. 6B) . Sequencing data revealed that all three DI RNAs, mG1, mB4 and mC5, had been converted to the wild-type sequence, presumably by recombination (Fig. 6C) . Despite recombination of mG1 DI RNA with helper virus, a significant decrease of mG1 RNA synthesis was observed in this experiment (Fig. 6A, lane 3) . A DI RNA (mD6) containing a 3-nt mutation from nt 177 to 175 at the 3 end of genome and located upstream of both known 3 proteinbinding elements was also included in this experiment to see if a DI RNA carrying a mutation which is predicted (C) Quantitative analysis of DI RNA replication and summary of recombination of mutant DI RNAs during replication.

The ratio of DI RNA PCR (target PCR) to competitor PCR product was calculated and plotted. Results indicated that a ratio of one is obtained at a value of 9.75 for DE25 cDNA, whereas the same ratio is obtained at a value of 3 for mG1 cDNA. Thus a 3.25-fold difference between the two samples was demonstrated. These results indicated that synthesis of negative-strand mG1 RNA is approximately 31% of wild-type DE25 RNA, which is similar to the effect on positive-strand replication of mG1 RNA relative to the wild-type DE25 (27%, Fig. 6C ).\n\nKinetic analysis of DI RNA replication and recombination FIG. 7 .

We interpret these results as providing an indication times of infection (5.5 to 7.5 hr p.i.), when replication of that the 11-nt sequence UGAAUGAAGUU at the 3 end of genomic RNA of MHV is required for the efficient replication of DI RNA, although high rates of recombination with helper virus appear to preclude unequivocally, demonstrating this point.\n\nTo determine if the mutation in the mG1 DI RNA differentially affects negative-strand or positive-strand RNA synthesis, competitive RT-PCR was performed to quantitate negative-strand synthesis of DE25 and mG1 DI RNA. To allow a comparison of the synthesis of positive-and negative-strand DI RNAs from the same samples, aliquots of the 32 P-labeled viral RNAs shown in Fig. 6 were also used for detection of negative-strand DI RNA, except an additional step of DNase digestion was included. response between the amount of input competitor cDNA positive-strand DI RNA was barely observed, synthesis had a minimal effect on protein-binding activity (Fig. 1) . However, in the experiment shown in Fig. 5 , where re-of negative-strand mG1 RNA could be detected and the recombination between transfected mG1 RNA and helper combination did not rescue the mutation, it nevertheless substantially decreased DI replication. Thus, the 11-nt virus had already taken place (Fig. 8B) .\n\nsequence may contain two partially overlapping functional elements, one of which is necessary for replication DISCUSSION independent of its effect on protein binding. In experiments where recombination events had restored the Our approach to studying the mechanism of MHV RNA replication is to precisely identify the host and/or viral wild-type sequence, mB4 and mC5 replicated to levels similar to wild-type DE25 RNA. mD6 RNA, containing a protein-binding element at the 3 end of genomic RNA, to examine the requirement for protein binding to this 3-nt mutation located upstream of both known 3 proteinbinding elements and predicted to have little or no effect site for viral replication, and to determine the identity and function of the protein(s) which bind to this element.

Although replication of mG1 RNA prevented binding of cellular proteins in vitro, confirming that this 11-nt sequence is an important determinant for varied greatly from one experiment to another, RT-PCR sequencing data from three separate experiments all RNA-protein complex formation. This sequence is fully conserved among MHV strains (Parker and Masters, demonstrated the conversion of transfected DI RNA to the wild-type sequence, providing an indication that the 1990).\n\nThe large size of MHV genome RNA (31 kb) has to conserved 11-nt sequence located from nt 36 to 26 at the 3 end of genomic RNA of MHV is strongly selected date prevented the construction of its full-length, infectious cDNA clone.

Mutations within the 11-nt motif which disrupt RNA-protein interactions were introduced into negative-strand synthesis and its effect on positivestrand replication is indirect or if it directly effects posi-DI RNA. The synthesis of positive-strand mG1 DI RNA carrying a completely mutagenized motif was only 27 to tive-strand synthesis as well. At present we are unsure whether the related se-63% of wild-type DE25 RNA, even though the mutation sequence was repaired by recombination with helper quence UGAGAGAAGUU, located 129-nt from the 3 termini of viral genome within the upstream (171-85) 3 pro-virus during the course of the experiment. Replication of positive-strand DI RNA carrying less extensive mutations tein-binding element, plays any role in viral replication. The data we have presented here, indicating that the within the protein-binding motif, i.e., mB4 (UGA) and mC5 (GAAGUU), was dependent on recombination events dur-mutagenized 11-nt motif in the mG1 RNA probe has a small amount of residual activity of protein-binding, does ing infection. In the experiment where reversion to the wild-type sequence did not take place (Fig. 5) , the replica-not let us distinguish between two alternative hypotheses. In the first hypothesis, the upstream protein-binding tion level of either DI RNA was greatly decreased compared to that of wild type. However, there was not an motif does not function in RNA replication; the residual low-level protein-binding activity of the 3 most motif absolute correlation between the effect of a given mutation on protein-binding activity and RNA replication. allows for a low level of replication sufficient for rescue of the mutated DI by recombination with helper virus. Among several mutant RNA probes, the mC5 mutation The second hypothesis invokes a role for the upstream experiment showed that RNA probe containing the 11-nt sequence binds four host proteins with sizes of 120, 103, protein-binding motif in replication. The upstream element would provide a degree of redundancy for the MHV 81, and 55 kDa. Mutations which disrupt RNA-protein complex formation appeared to result in the disappear-replicon and allows replication to proceed, albeit less efficiently, if the downstream nt 36-26 protein-binding ele-ance of two proteins of 103 and 80 kDa from the complex and dramatically decreased the binding of a highly la-ment is inactivated. The sequencing data demonstrating that all transfected mG1 DI RNA was converted to the beled 120-kDa protein, suggesting a correlation between the presence of these protein components in the RNA-wild-type sequence by recombination suggest that this upstream protein-binding element, if it does have a role protein complex and DI RNA replication. The identity and biological functions of these proteins in viral replication in MHV RNA synthesis, could not completely compensate for the mutation in the mG1 RNA. Further studies of the remains to be established. All of our RNase protection/gel mobility shift and UV effect of mutations in upstream (175-85) protein-binding element or in both protein-binding elements will help cross-linking experiments to date have failed to demonstrate binding of any virus-specific protein to this 11-nt answer this question.\n\nSequences at the 3 end of genomic RNA are strongly sequence, a result which puzzles us. Yet the MHV RDRP must recognize the 3 region of the genome to initiate conserved amongst MHV strains (Parker and Masters, 1990) ; therefore, it seems likely that sequences flanking negative-strand RNA transcription. This may be an indication that viral proteins do not bind directly to the geno-the 11-nt protein-binding motif might also play a role in viral replication. The particular role of these sequences mic RNA, but associate with protein-binding elements within genomic RNA via protein-protein interactions and in replication is unknown but could include stabilizing secondary structures at the 3 end of genome as well as thus could not be detected by the UV cross-linking assay. Alternatively, the binding affinity of viral protein to RNA directly interacting with host or viral proteins.\n\nHost cell proteins binding to either the 3 or the 5 end could be sufficiently low that the RNA-protein complex formed with MHV polymerase proteins is not resistant to of genome RNA have been reported in positive-strand coronavirus (Furuya and Yu and Leibowitz, RNase T 1 digestion under any of the conditions we used.
