To preserve both patient and society's trust, medical communities must hold our standards for professionalism and quality care high. Adherence to state regulations, 2 thorough clinical intake, clear and consistent video connectivity and images, documentation, patient education and transparency, care coordination, data security, and patient privacy should remain a top priority, even in times of crisis. If a non-HIPAA compliant platform is used initially, conversion to a HIPAA-compliant platform should be encouraged as soon as possible.\n\nTelehealth offers a tool to provide accessible, quality care and maintain connectivity while practicing social distancing. Thoughtful implementation 3,4,5 of telehealth now allows for sustainable and scalable practice beyond the current crisis.\n\nWe recommend the following steps for implementing telemedicine into outpatient practices:\n\n1. Use existing systems and platforms (patient portals) to encourage patients to initiate telemedicine when available.\n\n2. Identify highest risk or urgent patients and schedule them for telemedicine visits.\n\n3. Defer all non-essential visits until a later time. In the last weeks, we have been proud of the quick actions of our colleagues to adapt and change their way of practice. However, there will always be questions as clinicians change the way they practice. Will telemedicine provide the same quality care as in person? How can we foster patient relationships with electronic distance? Unfortunately, we do not have the resources to see most patients in person, nor can we risk exposing otherwise healthy people to COVID-19.\n\nWith telehealth implementation, we can see patients remotely, whereas we would not have seen them at all.\n\nWe anticipate that these changes are necessarily difficult, and our system will grow in new ways.\n\nTogether as physicians, we will inevitably learn new things about allocating resources, improving efficiency, and optimizing our health system by using telehealth to tackle this pandemic."}
