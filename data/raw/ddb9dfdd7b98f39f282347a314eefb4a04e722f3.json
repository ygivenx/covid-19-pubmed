{"title": "Effects of Module Development and Role Play Course on Clinical Practice Examination Scores during a 4th Year Clerkship", "body": "One hundred and thirteen students in their fourth-year of a medical school located in Seoul participated in this study. Seventy-one (62.8%) of the subjects were male students, and 57 (50.4%) of the subjects were medical college students. The average age was 26.2\u00b12.5 years. During Table 1 . The other 11 rotation groups had completed their respective community medicine training were not subject to any organized CPX-related training program. Effects of the three-day preparation program could thus be compared through a common subsequent comprehensive CPX between the intervention and control groups.\n\nThe CPX preparation program was operated by a professor, a clinical instructor, and a medical resident in the department of family medicine. Guidelines for CPX case development was taught as the core lecture on the first day, and each group was then divided into three subgroups consisting of three students each to develop cases on three CPX clinical problems (cough, vaginal discharge, and hand tremor). For case selection, students referred to the '2015 basic clinical practice guidelines, ' published by Korea Association of Medical Colleges, using their experience with the actual patients they came across during their clinical clerkship. The three groups were given the same CPX clinical problems, but were asked to develop modules based on \n\nAll students took a CPX on 13 stations in February 2015. CPX on 13 stations was conducted again in July 2015 after the fourth-year clerkship.\n\nBoth examinations involved a 10-minute one-on-one interview with standardized patient and evaluation of standardized patient on clinical competency of students based on a checklist that consists of six sections (patient satisfaction, history taking, physical exam, clinical courtesy, patient education, and patient-physician interaction). This study sought to analyze the difference between the score marked by the students who underwent these programs and the score marked by the student who did not undergo these programs. Two of the taught CPX clinical problems (vaginal discharge, cough) were comprised some of the problems in the CPX taken in July.\n\nThe scores were determined by standardized patients who acted as raters. A chi square test and Student t-test were used to analyze basic characteristics of students. Student t-test and paired t-test were used to compare CPX results between February and July. Statistical significance was assumed when P<0.05, and the analysis of all data was done using IBM SPSS ver. 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).\n\nThere was no significant difference in the distribution of age, sex, and school type between the intervention and control group (Table 2) .\n\nThere was no significant difference between two groups in total score and sectional scores (patient satisfaction, history taking, physical exam, clinical courtesy, patient education, and patient-physician interaction) on the CPX conducted in February 2015 (Table 3) .\n\nAll scores, except for physical exam, increased in both the intervention group and control group on the CPX conducted in July. In particu- Values are presented as mean\u00b1standard error or number (%). *Obtained using a Student t-test for age; the c 2 test was used for sex and type of school. We may interpret it as the educational module being the focus on history taking with case specificity. Other educational interventions, such as a general hands-on skill course for comprehensive physical exam skills, were ineffective enough to affect the area score.\n\nThere was no significant correlation between school achievement, history taking, and physical exam scores of students; 9) history taking and physical exam, sections that require frequent contact with patients, were regarded by students to be the most difficult on the first CPX held in Korea. 10) This means that it is difficult to significantly increase scores on history taking and physical exam through ordinary curriculum. In this study, activities of students to prepare checklist for role play, feedback weak points during role play using the checklist, and repeatedly learn about the checklists of history taking section are believed to have directly and indirectly increased scores on history taking section. In a study by Han et al., 14) physician-patient interaction (PPI) score had high correlation with history taking. Smith 15) defined history taking as \"a communication in which a patient can speak freely and a physician plays the role of an attentive listener to understand and ap- modules in the case of cough, and GERD is a key diagnosis to implicate the digestive system, unlike other cough problems (respiratory system). Therefore, this result suggests that scores may not increase unless role play practice is done on a wide variety of diseases for each item. However, this case specificity alone would not fully explain how the CPX results of the group, which underwent a preparation course, were higher than those of the group that did not undergo a preparation course. Training experiences would have led to acquiring relevant working knowledge and subsequent improvements in clinical competency in general.\n\nThe limitations of this study are as follows. First, the scope of this study is limited to activities conducted within a single medical school, and thus carries inevitable restrictions when its findings are presented to a broader scope. Second, the long-term effects of CPX preparation education on the performance at the national examination could not be examined, as only the short-term effects were observed and exam- "}
