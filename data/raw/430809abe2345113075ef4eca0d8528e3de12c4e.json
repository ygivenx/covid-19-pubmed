{"title": "", "body": "NucliSENS EasyMAG (BioM\u00e9rieux, France) automated extractor according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the extraction was done from 600 \u03bcl homogenized sample which was added to 2 ml NucliSens EasyMAG Lysis buffer and was incubated for 10 min on board. Thereafter, 125 \u00b5l of a mixture of NucliSens EasyMAG Magnetica Silica and NucliSens EasyMAG extraction buffer was added to each sample. Finally, the nucleic acid was eluted in a volume of 75 \u03bcl. PCR reactions were carried out in a 25 \u03bcl volume consisting of 10 \u03bcl nucleic acid extract and 15 \u00b5l mastermix consisting of 1.5 \u00b5l Primer Probe mix, 0.5 \u00b5l SuperScript III RT/Platinum TaQ Mix (Life Technologies, Belgium), 12.5 \u00b5l ReactionMix (a buffer containing 0.4mM of each dNTP and 6 mM MgSO4) and 0.5 \u00b5l RNAse free water (QIAGEN, Benelux). The multiplex RT PCR FTD assay was performed on an CFX 96 RT PCR detection System (BIO-RAD laboratories, Belgium). The thermal profile was as follow: 30 min at 48\u00b0C for reverse transcription; a preheating step of 10 min at 95\u00b0C for initial denaturation and Taq DNA polymerase activation; 50 cycles of 15 sec at 95\u00b0C (denaturation) followed by 60 sec at 60\u00b0C (annealing and elongation) and finally 2 min at 25\u00b0C (cooling).The presence of a specific viral or bacterial sequence in the reaction was detected by an increase in fluorescence of the specific dual labeled probe and is shown as the Treshold (Cq) value by the Real Time thermocycler. In each run, one negative control was 2 extracted and amplified and 1 positive control for each different respiratory pathogen was amplified.\n\nThe results were reported qualitative (presence versus absence, known Cq-value).\n\nAll respiratory samples taken in one of the hospitals of Bruges were analyzed at the AZ Sint-Jan Bruges hospital using an in-house customized Taqman\u00ae Seventy-eight \u00b5l of the obtained DNA/RNA extract was then homogenously mixed with 26 \u00b5l of TaqMan Fast Mastermix (ThermoFisher Scientific, Life Technologies, California) leading to a total volume of 104 \u00b5l of which 100 \u00b5l was loaded on the array card. After pipetting the reaction mixture in the reservoirs of the card, the TAC must be centrifuged twice (2 minutes at 1200 rpm) with as aim the distribution of this mix into the different reaction wells. Then the TAC is sealed twice, to reassure no amplicon can be released during amplification, by using a precision stylus assembly (\"carriage\") which closes the channel going from the reservoir to the wells. Then the reservoirs are cut off. Simultaneously amplification and detection of the target RNA/DNA and internal control RNA using specific primers and probes was performed on the ViiA7 Thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
