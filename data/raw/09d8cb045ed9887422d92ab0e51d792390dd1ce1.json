{"title": "", "body": "The Vertebrate Virus Subcommittee of the International Committee on Nomenclature of Viruses (ICNV) has, following reports from several of its study groups, made certain recommendations concerning the names of viral genera. They have been circulated to members of the ICNV and have received little adverse criticism; it is therefore to be expected that they will receive final official approval at the meeting to be held in Mexico City in August 1970. They have already been approved by the Executive Committee of ICNV.\n\nIt is intended that authoritative descriptions of all genera shall be published in due course; some of these will be revisions of generic names already published. Descriptions will include designations of type species. It seems desirable to publish now recommendations as to the use of certain names which are already widely used but have not been officially approved.\n\nThe names picornavirus and papovavirus will be used as proposed at International Congress held in Montreal in 1962 (Virus Subcommittee, 1963a and not as subsequently modified at the provisional virus nomenclature committee held in Paris in 1965 (PCNV, 1965 . In view of comments received by the Vertebrate Virus Subcommittee, it will be necessary at the ICNV meetings to be held in Mexico City in August 1970 to discuss whether it is desirable to subdivide these genera.\n\nTogavirus (from the Latin toga = a cloak) is the name now proposed to cover what is likely to prove the great majority of arboviruses having taxonomic characters like those of the A and B groups (Casals, 1967) . Fenner's (1968) proposed name \"Encephalovirus\" for the group is not approved. The name \"arbovirus\" is to be used in a purely biological sense to denote those viruses having a biological cycle in both arthropods and vertebrates. The arboviruses related to bluetongue and vesicular stomatitis have clearly different characters from the others and are not included in the toga-viruses. All of the provisional members are, however, biologically arboviruses or else are closely related serologically to others which are. It may prove desirable to employ separate names to designate the A, B, and other groups. The relevant study group is being asked to designate a type-species: until this is done togavirus can be used as a Irjargon name.\" It is realized that future work may reveal that fundamental characters may be shared by a number of viruses which are arthropod-borne and by others which are not (cf. Holmes & Warburton, 1967) .\n\nThe use of the name paramyxovirus and the viruses to be included are matters now being considered by the myxovirus study group.\n\nCoronavirus is a name agreed upon by a number of those working on a group of viruses related to that of infectious bronchitis of fowls. It includes also some human respiratory pathogens and mouse hepatitis virus (Anon, 1968) .\n\nRhabdovirus is proposed for rod-like or bullet-shaped viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus, rabies, and Egtved virus. Several viruses infecting insects or plants have similar morphology, but their possible affinities with rhabdoviruses needs further study.\n\nParvovirus: This group of small singlestranded DNA viruses includes the latent rat viruses, the minute mouse virus, and the adeno-associated (or adeno-satellite) viruses. The name picodnavirus (Mayor and Melnick, 1966) is not approved.\n\nThe ICNV will be considering how to deal with the groups containing morphologically similar viruses infecting vertebrates as well as plants or arthropods."}
