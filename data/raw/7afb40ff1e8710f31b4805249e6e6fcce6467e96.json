{"title": "Evaluation of equine coronavirus fecal shedding among hospitalized horses", "body": "Equine coronavirus (ECoV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, is a single-stranded, positive sense, enveloped ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus associated with outbreaks of enteric disease in adult horses. 1, 2 Infection with ECoV reportedly causes fever, lethargy, colic, or diarrhea of variable severity in adult horses. 1, 3 Hyperammonemic encephalopathy also has been reported. 3 Morbidity and mortality range from 10% to 83% [1] [2] [3] [4] and from 7% to 27%, [1] [2] [3] [4] respectively. Historically, electron microscopy (EM) was considered the gold standard for diagnosis of coronavirus in feces. 5, 6 Because of the expertise and equipment required for this technique and its inability to characterize viruses beyond the family level, EM has been augmented in clinical settings by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as this test provides a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool to document the presence of ECoV in feces of horses. 1 Epidemiological information regarding ECoV is limited, 7 and as a result, definitive diagnosis of ECoV in adult horses remains challenging.\n\nIt is well established that clinically affected horses shed ECoV in feces for 2-5 weeks after infection, 3, 7, 8 \n\nAbbreviations: CT, computed tomography; DI, deionized; ECoV, equine coronavirus; EM, electron microscopy; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RNA, ribonucleic acid; VTH, Veterinary Teaching Hospital; WSU, Washington State University. described. 8 The virus also is demonstrable in feces of unaffected horses during outbreaks, suggesting that inapparent carrier horses or transient shedding of ECoV may occur. 1, 3 Coronaviral-induced disease is associated with stress in other adult large animals. [9] [10] [11] [12] Subclinical carriers and fecal viral load appeared to be minimal in other continents, 13 \n\nSample collection was performed from January 2016 through July 2018. Two fecal samples were collected from each horse. The first sample was collected as soon as a sample was available after admis- \n\nElectron microscopic evaluation was performed at the North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Fargo, North Dakota, as previously described. 16 Briefly, fecal material was mixed with 3-9 times its volume of deionized (DI) water to obtain the desired consistency. The suspension was allowed to settle and cleared by low-speed and then high-speed centrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in DI water, placed on 400-mesh, carbon-stabilized grids and negatively stained for 30-60 seconds with 2% phosphotungstic acid solution. The grids were examined on a JEOL JEM-100CX II transmission electron microscope and evaluated by an experienced electron microscopist.\n\nData were analyzed using commercial software (SigmaPlot; SPSS, Chicago, Illinois). Normality of the data and equality of variances were assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk and Levene's tests, respectively. Differences in breed and age by group were assessed using 2-way repeated measures analysis of variance; multiple comparisons were performed using the Holm-Sidak method. Significance was set at P < .05.\n\nClinical problem and season was summarized in a contingency There were no significant differences in the sex of horses admitted into each group. Overall, geldings accounted for 42% of the total admissions and were significantly more common than stallions (P = .006) and mares (P = .03). Mares also were significantly more common than stallions (P = .006) in both groups.\n\nFor the total period of study, the largest percentage of horses was admitted during fall followed by spring (Figure 1 ).\n\nThe most common cause of hospitalization for horses in the Table 1 . Apart from their presenting complaints (eg, lameness, sinus problem, spinal ataxia), all of these horses were systemically healthy.\n\nFecal samples were selected because ECoV can be shed consistently in feces of affected and exposed horses. 2, 7 Samples were collected upon admission and after 48 hours of hospitalization to increase chances of viral detection because shedding may be low during the peracute stages of infection or may be delayed because of gastrointestinal tract stasis. 1 In addition, serial sampling was performed to evaluate the role of stress in ECoV fecal shedding, because stress has been shown to affect shedding of other equine pathogens. [19] [20] [21] A >48-hour sampling period between samples was not feasible, because most horses undergoing anesthesia for imaging purposes were hospitalized for \u22642 days.\n\nOne hundred thirty horses were included in the study. After the included because there appears to be no age predilection for this infection in adult horses. 5 Horses in the Anesthesia group were significantly younger than horses in the Gastrointestinal Disease group. This is likely because horses undergoing limb imaging usually are actively performing and therefore are younger. As expected, based on the normal distri- \n\nAuthors declare no conflict of interest.\n\nAuthors declare no off-label use of antimicrobials.\n\nThe experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at WSU (ASAF# 04793-001).
