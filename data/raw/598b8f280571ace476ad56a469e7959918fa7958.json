These viruses 34 are rarely confined to their original locations and thus create challenges in containment. 35\n\nNewer viruses also lack available approved treatments and indicate the need for 36 broader spectrum antivirals. We now highlight one such molecule, tilorone 37 dihydrochloride (tilorone, Amixin \u00ae or Lavomax \u00ae ) which is currently registered for human The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.984856 doi: bioRxiv preprint confluent cell culture monolayers in 96-well disposable microplates were prepared. 56\n\nCells were maintained in MEM or DMEM supplemented with FBS as required for each 57 cell line.
