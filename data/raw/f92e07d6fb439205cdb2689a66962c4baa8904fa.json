{"title": "Antiviral Agents Against Respiratory Viruses", "body": "Few antiviral drugs are currently approved for treating respiratory virus infections and most of these are specific inhibitors of influenza viruses (Table 154-1) . However, considerable progress is being made in the development of new therapeutics for other respiratory viruses. 1 The emergence of new pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has also led to screening efforts to identify new therapeutics. 2, 3 Clinical studies to examine novel targets (Table 154-1) , combinations designed to increase potency and reduce resistance emergence, therapeutic antibodies, and immunomodulatory agents selected to mitigate immunopathologic host responses, particularly for influenza, are in progress. 4 Neutralizing antibodies have been proven effective for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease, although not for treatment, 5 but specific neutralizing antibodies (convalescent plasma, monoclonals) appear to be promising for treating novel influenza and coronavirus infections. This chapter reviews the properties and clinical applications of currently approved antiviral agents.\n\nAmantadine (Symmetrel) and rimantadine (Flumadine) are symmetric tricyclic amines that specifically inhibit the replication of influenza A viruses at low concentrations (<1.0 \u00b5g/mL) by blocking the action\n\n\u2022 Most circulating strains of influenza are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine.\n\n\u2022 There are four approved neuraminidase inhibitors: laninamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir and zanamivir.\n\n\u2022 All of the neuraminidase inhibitors have the greatest clinical impact if started within 24-48 hours of symptom onset.\n\n\u2022 For hospitalized adults and children, anti-influenza therapy should be initiated as soon as influenza is considered and should not be delayed for confirmatory testing.\n\n\u2022 Neuraminidase inhibitors appear to reduce morbidity and mortality among hospitalized adults and children when started up to 5 days, and possibly longer, after symptom onset.\n\n\u2022 Aerosol ribavirin is approved for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) but has very limited clinical indications; oral ribavirin is part of a triple drug regimen for influenza undergoing testing.\n\n\u2022 Several new antivirals are in advanced development for the treatment of respiratory viral infections including RSV, rhinovirus and adenovirus.\n\n\u2022 Neutralizing antibodies in the form of convalescent plasma or monoclonals appear to be promising for treatment in novel influenza and coronavirus infections. Oseltamivir is indicated for prophylaxis in children \u22651 year old and for treatment in children in \u22652 weeks of age. \u2021 No treatment or prophylaxis dosing recommendations are available for patients undergoing renal dialysis. \u00a7 Initial loading dose of 600 mg or age adjusted equivalent; maximum dose 600 mg QD. \u00b6 Volume of suspension. \u2016 Zanamivir is indicated for prophylaxis in children \u22655 years old and for treatment in children \u22657 years old.

Recommendations based on those provided by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. 4\n\nInfluenza A and B viruses possess a surface glycoprotein with neuraminidase activity whereas influenza C viruses do not (Figure 154-1 ). This enzyme cleaves terminal sialic acid residues from various glycoconjugates and destroys the receptors recognized by viral hemagglutinin. This activity is essential for release of virus from infected cells, for prevention of viral aggregates, and for viral spread within the respiratory tract. 21 Oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae, a prodrug of the active carboxylate), laninamivir (Inavir\u00ae), peramivir (Rapiacta\u00ae, Peramiflu\u00ae) \n\nPharmacokinetic Properties of Antivirals with Activity Against Influenza [11] [12] [13] [14] decreasing bioavailability. Both the prodrug and parent are eliminated primarily unchanged through the kidney by glomerular filtration and anionic tubular secretion. The dose should be reduced by half for patients with a creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, and further reductions when clearance is below 10 mL/min. 31 Distribution is not well characterized in humans, but peak bronchoalveolar lavage, middle ear fluid and sinus fluid levels are similar to plasma levels. 13 Recent data suggest that significant relationships exist between oseltamivir carboxylate AUC 0-24 and area under the curve (AUC) of symptom scores, time to alleviation of composite symptom scores, and time to cessation of viral shedding in experimentally infected volunteers. 32 \n\nOseltamivir is available for oral delivery only. Oseltamivir comes as 30, 45, and 75 mg tablets and as a white tutti-frutti-flavored suspension (360 mg oseltamivir base for a final concentration of 6 mg/mL). The approved adult dose for treatment is 75 mg twice daily for 5 days and for prophylaxis is 75 mg once daily. Pediatric dosing is based on weight and is outlined in \n\nOseltamivir is indicated for the prevention of influenza infection in patients \u22651 year, with dosing once a day. The efficacy of once-daily oseltamivir 75 mg for 6 weeks in preventing influenza illness in healthy, nonimmunized adults was 84% and in preventing influenza infection irrespective of symptoms was 50%. 13 In immunized nursing home residents, the efficacy of prophylaxis was 92% against illness compared to placebo. 23 Somewhat lower efficacy was seen in a household-contact prophylaxis study, and protection against influenza has been shown in children. 33 Seasonal prophylaxis of high-risk immunocompromised patients was documented to provide ~80% protective efficacy against RT-PCR-confirmed influenza illness. 34 Caution should be used when prescribing oseltamivir for prophylaxis in patients exposed to an index case as prophylaxis has been associated with emergence of resistant mutants; 35 empiric therapy or monitoring is generally recommended in these cases as a result.\n\nPostexposure prophylaxis in nursing home influenza outbreaks is advised for 14 days or for at least 7 days after the last culture-confirmed illness in the ward or building is effective; this regimen should be given with concomitant influenza vaccination for those not previously provided. Seasonal prophylaxis, during the 4-8 weeks of peak influenza virus circulation within the community, can be used for protection of high-risk patients who cannot tolerate immunization, who do not develop an adequate immune response to vaccine, or when the strain circulating in the community does not match the vaccine strain.\n\nOseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days when started within the first 2 days of symptoms was associated with a shorter time to alleviation of uncomplicated influenza illness (29-35 hours shorter) and with reductions in severity of illness, duration of fever, time to return to normal activity, quantity of viral shedding, duration of impaired activity, and complications leading to antibiotic use, particularly bronchitis, compared to placebo in previously healthy adults. 6, 16, 36 One recent study in Bangladesh suggests that oseltamivir may have efficacy up to 72 hours after symptom onset in children. 37 Pediatric studies enrolling children as young as 2 weeks of age demonstrated that oseltamivir is safe and is associated with significantly reduced illness duration and severity, time to resumption of full activities, and the occurrence of complications leading to antibiotic use, particularly acute otitis media. [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] Most existing literature on the safety and efficacy of oseltamivir in elderly or high-risk persons, including those with underlying cardiopulmonary conditions or immunodeficiency comes from observational studies [43] [44] [45] [46] and suggests that among such high risk and hospitalized individuals, there is a benefit to starting antiviral therapy through at least 5 days after symptom onset with the greatest benefit in patients started within 48 hours after symptom onset. 47 and zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae) are sialic acid analogs that potently and specifically inhibit influenza A and B neuraminidases by competitively and reversibly interacting with the active enzyme site. 22, 23 These drugs are active against all nine influenza neuraminidase subtypes in nature. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are globally available, while laninamivir is approved in Japan and peramivir is approved in China, Japan, South Korea and the USA.\n\nLaninamivir octanoate (CS-8958) is a prodrug that is converted in the airway to laninamivir (R-125489), the active neuraminidase inhibitor and is retained at concentrations that exceed the IC 50 for most influenza neuraminidases for at least 240 hours (10 days) after a single inhalation of 40 mg. 24 Only 15% of the drug is systemically absorbed after inhalation. Laninamivir has excellent in vitro activity against wildtype influenza A and B viruses currently circulating, including those H1N1 viruses containing H275Y mutations in the neuraminidase.\n\nLaninamivir octanoate (CS-8958) is currently only approved in Japan and is available as a 20 mg dry powder inhaler. It is undergoing clinical investigation outside of Japan at present.\n\nLaninamivir is approved for the prevention of influenza in adults and children \u2265 10 years of age; a single inhalation of 20 mg daily for 2 days is recommended for this indication. Among household contacts of an index patient with influenza, 2 and 3 days of laninamivir 20 mg daily was associated with a 77% and 78% protective efficacy, respectively, compared with placebo. 25 \n\nLaninamivir is approved for the treatment and prevention of influenza A and B infection in Japan. For treatment, laninamivir is approved as a single inhalation of 40 mg for individuals \u226510 years of age and 20 mg for children less than 10 years of age. Laninamivir was associated with more rapid time to alleviation of influenza illness due to infections by seasonal H1N1 virus with the H275Y substitution in children compared to a standard 5-day oseltamivir regimen, while studies in adults demonstrated noninferiority versus oseltamivir in such patients. 26, 27 Laninamivir demonstrates a similar duration of fever in ambulatory children when compared to patients treated with zanamivir. 28, 29 \n\nNo dose adjustment is currently indicated in any patient population.\n\nClinical studies in Asia found similar rates of nausea in laninamivir octanoate-and oseltamivir-treated patients, lower rates of vomiting in the laninamivir octanoate arm, and similar to slightly higher rates of diarrhea in laninamivir octanoate arms. 26, 27 Dizziness was seen in 0.9-1.8% of laninamivir octanoate-treated patients but not oseltamivirtreated patients. 26 Laninamivir was not associated with significant bronchospasm or other respiratory adverse effects in patients with chronic respiratory disease. 30 Oseltamivir\n\nOral oseltamivir ethyl ester is well absorbed and rapidly cleaved by esterases in the gastrointestinal tract, liver or blood. The bioavailability of the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, is estimated to be ~80% in previously healthy persons (see Table 154 -3). 13 The plasma elimination half-life is 6-10 hours but is more prolonged in the elderly, although dose adjustments are not generally necessary. Administration with food appears to decrease the risk of gastrointestinal upset without All of the studies in hospitalized adults suggest that early therapy is associated with reduced incidence of lower respiratory tract complications, requirement for ICU-level care, duration of illness, duration of shedding and mortality. 6, 16, 45, 46, 48 \n\nThe usual oseltamivir dose should be reduced to 75 mg once a day for treatment and 75 mg every other day or 30 mg of suspension daily for prophylaxis when a patient has a creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min. Doses of oseltamivir should be given after hemodialysis; detailed dosing for renal insufficiency and renal replacement therapy is available in Table 154 -3. The safety and pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment have not been evaluated. Several studies in pregnancy suggest that oseltamivir is likely safe and provides clear therapeutic benefit to pregnant women infected with influenza. [49] [50] [51] There are conflicting data about optimal dosing of oseltamivir in pregnant women, with some studies suggesting need for higher doses (75 mg TID), while others suggest no dose adjustment is needed. 52-54 Current guidelines recommend treating pregnant women with influenza infection with one of the approved neuraminidase inhibitors. The recommended pediatric dosage is listed in Table 154 -2.\n\nDoubling the treatment dose of oseltamivir in hospitalized influenza patients does not appear to increase virologic efficacy, except perhaps for influenza B infections, or clinical effectiveness, although one ICU-based RCT reported that tripling the standard dose was associated with acceleration of viral RNA clearance from the respiratory tract. [55] [56] [57] \n\nOral oseltamivir is generally well tolerated and no serious end-organ toxicity has been found in controlled clinical trials. Oseltamivir is associated with nausea, abdominal discomfort and, less often, emesis in a minority of treated patients. Nausea and vomiting occur at approximately 10-15% excess frequency in oseltamivir recipients. Gastrointestinal complaints are typically mild-to-moderate in intensity, usually resolve despite continued dosing, and are ameliorated by administration with food. Clinical studies comparing 75 mg and 150 mg twice daily found similar frequencies of adverse events with the two doses. Other infrequent possible adverse events include insomnia, vertigo and fever. Postmarketing reports suggest that oseltamivir may be associated rarely with skin rash, hepatic dysfunction or thrombocytopenia. Additionally, there have been reports of abnormal neurologic and behavioral symptoms which have rarely resulted in deaths among mostly children; most of these reports have come from Japan. Existing data suggest that these events are more likely secondary to influenza infections than oseltamivir therapy. 58, 59 It is currently recommended that patients be monitored closely for behavioral abnormalities.\n\nNo clinically significant drug interactions have been recognized to date, including studies with amoxicillin, aspirin and acetaminophen. No interactions with the cytochrome P450 enzymes occur in vitro and oseltamivir does not affect steady-state pharmacokinetics of commonly used immunosuppressive agents. 60 However, probenecid blocks tubular secretion and doubles the half-life of oseltamivir. Protein binding is below 10%. Oseltamivir does not affect the immunogenicity of concomitant inactivated virus vaccine but might impair the immunogenicity of concurrent live-attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine.\n\nPeramivir has low oral bioavailability and is therefore delivered intravenously. Peramivir achieves exceptionally high maximum concentrations (~45 000 ng/mL after 600 mg intravenous dose) with excellent concentrations of drug in the nasal and pharyngeal secrections. 61 Peramivir is predominately eliminated unchanged by renal excretion with a plasma terminal elimination half-life of 12-25 hours. 41, 62 Peramivir has comparable or lower activity in vitro against influenza A and B viruses than oseltamivir carboxylate and zanamivir. 63 \n\nPeramivir is available in 150 mg and 300 mg solutions for intravenous use.\n\nPeramivir randomized clinical trials have been conducted in previously healthy adults and children infected with uncomplicated influenza. When compared to placebo, a single 300-600 mg infusion of peramivir was associated with a significantly shorter time to alleviation of symptoms, significantly shorter time to resumption of their usual activities, and more rapid clearance of virus. 64 Another study found that a single 300-600 mg infusion of peramivir was noninferior to 5 days of oral oseltamivir 75 mg BID in a season when many of the viruses were resistant to oseltamivir as the result of the H275Y mutation; these data question the efficacy of peramivir in the management of viruses with the H275Y mutation. 65 In a study comparing 5 days of 200 mg or 400 mg QD of peramivir with oral oseltamivir 75 mg BID in hospitalized adults, there was a trend toward more rapid resumption of usual activities in peramivir-treated patients and greater reductions of influenza B viral titers in the nasopharynx than oseltamivir over the first 48 h.\n\nSince peramivir is renally cleared, dosing must be adjusted based on renal function (see Table 154 -3). There are limited data to guide dosing of peramivir in children, particularly among neonates. 66 Available data and models suggest that patients receiving intermittent hemodialysis need dose adjustment (see Table 154 -3). 66 Dosing of patients on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) should be based on CRRT clearance. 67 There is limited dosing information for patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Based on modeling data and predicted drug concentrations, it is recommended that children \u2265181 days and \u2264 5 years receive 12 mg/kg daily (daily maximum of 600 mg/dose), infants 91-180 days receive 10 mg/kg daily, infants 31-90 days receive 8 mg/kg daily, and neonates \u226430 days receive 6 mg/kg daily. No dose adjustments are needed for hepatic impairment.\n\nRecognized adverse events associated with the administration of peramivir are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and neutrophil count decreased; other less common adverse events observed in studies to date include dizziness, headache, somnolence, nervousness, insomnia, feeling agitated, depression, nightmares, hyperglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated blood pressure, cystitis, ECG abnormalities, anorexia, and proteinuria. 68 \n\nThe oral bioavailability of zanamivir is low (<5%), and most clinical trials have used intranasal or dry powder inhalation delivery. Following inhalation of the dry powder, approximately 7-21% is deposited in the lower respiratory tract and the remainder in the oropharynx. 14, 69 Median zanamivir concentrations are above 1000 ng/mL in induced sputum 6 hours after inhalation and remain detectable up to 24 hours later. The peak plasma concentration averages 46 \u00b5g/L after a single 16 mg inhalation of zanamivir. The proprietary inhaler device for delivering zanamivir is breath-actuated and requires a cooperative patient. 70 Intravenous zanamivir displays linear dosing kinetics and the volume of distribution is approximately equivalent to that of extracellular water (16L). 14 Intravenous zanamivir provides high peak plasma concentrations (~35 000 ng/mL after 600 mg dose in adults). 71 90% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine with an elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. Intravenous zanamivir clearance is highly correlated with renal function (CL \u2245 7.08 + 0.826 \u22c5 CLCR). 72 \n\nZanamivir is delivered by inhalation with a proprietary breathactivated device (Diskhaler\u00ae). The usual adult treatment dose is two inhalations (10 mg) twice a day for 5 days. Intravenous zanamivir is currently in advanced clinical development and available by compassionate use.\n\nZanamivir is indicated as once-daily inhalations for the prevention of influenza in patients >5 years old. Once-daily inhaled zanamivir for 4 weeks was 84% efficacious in preventing laboratory-confirmed illness with fever and 31% effective in preventing influenza infections, irrespective of symptoms. 69 When used for postexposure prophylaxis, inhaled zanamivir for 10 days reduced the risk of secondary influenza illness by 79% in households. 69 In nursing homes experiencing influenza outbreaks, inhaled zanamivir was more effective for prevention of influenza A illness than oral rimantadine, in part because of frequent resistance emergence to the M2 inhibitor. 69 \n\nIn the USA, zanamivir is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated acute illness due to influenza A and B viruses in adults and pediatric patients 7 years and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days. 9 Inhaled zanamivir in adults has consistently shown at least 1 fewer day of disabling influenza symptoms, and most studies have found a reduction in the number of nights of disturbed sleep, in time to resumption of normal activities, and in the use of symptom relief medications. 6, 16 Similar therapeutic benefits have also been shown in children aged 5-12 years old. 73 Zanamivir has also been associated with a 40% reduction in lower respiratory tract complications of influenza leading to antibiotics, particularly bronchitis and pneumonia. 74 Zanamivir appears generally well tolerated and effective in treating influenza in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma or, less often, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 74, 75 Intravenous zanamivir is in advanced clinical development and has been used in seriously ill influenza patients, especially those with suspected oseltamivir-resistant variants. Most of the emergency IND (eIND) use of intravenous zanamivir were in patients who were clinically failing other antiviral therapy with at least 25% of patients having proven or clinically suspected resistance to oseltamivir. 76 Available data from patients who were treated under eIND demonstrated that among those with reported outcomes, 10.5% died despite therapy. 76 A phase 2 study in critically ill pandemic 2009 H1N1 patients found that treatment was associated with significant antiviral effects, even though therapy was initiated a median of 4.5 days after symptom onset. In patients with influenza detected on initial sample, 2 days of therapy was associated with a median 1.42 log 10 copies/mL decline in viral load. 71 There were no drug-related trends in safety parameters identified. The 14-and 28-day all-cause mortality rates were 13% and 17%, respectively. 71 A phase 3 study comparing iv zanamivir and oral oseltamivir in hospitalized adults is currently in progress.\n\nAlthough the plasma elimination half-life increases with creatinine clearance \u226470 mL/min, drug accumulation is negligible after inhalation and dose adjustment is not necessary for renal or hepatic dysfunction. Certain populations, particularly very young, frail or cognitively impaired patients, may have difficulty using the drug delivery system. 70 Intravenous zanamivir requires dose adjustment for renal insufficiency. All patients should receive an initial 600 mg loading dose. The maintenance dose and dosing interval are reduced with worsening renal function (see Table 154 -2). 71,72\n\nTopically applied zanamivir is generally well tolerated in controlled studies, including those involving patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 75 Postmarketing reports indicate that bronchospasm may be an uncommon but potentially severe problem, particularly in patients with acute influenza and underlying reactive airway disease. 6 Anecdotal reports of hospitalization and fatality indicate that inhaled zanamivir should be used cautiously in such patients. 6 Low bioavailability is associated with low exposure to circulating zanamivir, and no clinically significant drug interactions have been recognized. In vitro studies suggest that zanamivir does not inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. The drug does not affect the immunogenicity of concomitant immunization with inactivated virus vaccines but effects on intranasal, live-attenuated vaccine have not been studied. One randomized control trial in ambulatory adults found that the combination of inhaled zanamivir and oral oseltamivir was less effective than oseltamivir monotherapy. 77 Zanamivir is not associated with teratogenic effects in preclinical studies (FDA pregnancy category C) and should be considered as an option in pregnant women with proven influenza. 78 \n\nNeuraminidase inhibitor resistance in vitro results from mutations in the viral hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase. 79, 80 In the hemagglutinin variants, mutations in or near the receptor binding site make the virus less dependent on neuraminidase action, whereas neuraminidase mutations directly affect interaction with the inhibitors. The altered neuraminidases typically show reduced activity or stability, and the mutated viruses usually have decreased infectivity in animals. 79, 80 The particular neuraminidase mutation determines the degree of resistance and cross-resistance (i.e. H275Y cause high-level resistance to oseltamivir but not zanamivir; R292K results in reduced susceptibility to both oseltamivir and zanamivir). 79, 80 Oseltamivir-resistant variants have been recovered from <1% of treated adults and about 4% of treated children. 22 Assessment for resistance can be assessed by sequencing of the HA or NA gene or phenotypic testing. 79, 80 Ribavirin Ribavirin (Virazole\u00ae, Rebetol\u00ae) is a guanosine analog with a wide range of antiviral activity including influenza viruses, RSV and parainfluenza viruses. Ribavirin is rapidly phosphorylated by intracellular enzymes and the triphosphate inhibits influenza virus RNA polymerase activity and competitively inhibits the guanosine triphosphatedependent 5\u2032-capping of influenza viral messenger RNA. In addition, ribavirin depletes cellular guanine pools 81, 82 and may inhibit virus replication by lethal mutagenesis.\n\nOral ribavirin has a bioavailability of 33-45% in adults and children and achieves peak plasma concentration of 0.6 \u00b5g/mL 1-2 hours after ingestion of a 400 mg dose in adults. Ribavirin has a short initial (0.3-0.7 hour) and a long terminal (18-36 hours) phase half-life and is eliminated by hepatic metabolism and renal clearance. 83 After aerosol administration, plasma levels increase with exposure and range from 0.2 to 1 \u00b5g/mL. Respiratory secretions have levels up to 1000 \u00b5g/ mL, which decline with a half-life of 1.4-2.5 hours.\n\nRibavirin comes in three formulations: oral (approved for combined use in hepatitis C), intravenous (investigational in USA) and aerosol. Ribavirin for aerosolization is available as a 6 g/100 mL solution which is diluted to a final concentration of 20 mg/mL and delivered by small particle aerosol for 12-18 hours with a proprietary device (SPAG-2 nebulizer). A higher concentration of aerosol solution (60 mg/mL) has been given over 2 hours three times daily in some studies and appears improve 30-day mortality or reduce the duration of viral replication relative to no treatment. 90 \n\nSystemic ribavirin is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance <50 mL/min and the dose should be reduced by one-third for patients under 10 years of age. Dose adjustment is needed if there is a substantial decline in hematocrit and the drug should be discontinued if the hemoglobin drops below 8.5 g/dL. There is a fixed combination of oseltamivir, amantadine and ribavirin that is active in vitro against susceptible and resistant strains and shows promise in clinical management of influenza infections. 91, 92 \n\nSystemic ribavirin can cause a dose-related extravascular hemolytic anemia and, at higher doses, suppression of bone marrow release of erythroid elements. Aerosolized ribavirin can cause bronchospasm, mild conjunctival irritation, rash, psychological distress if administered in an oxygen tent and, rarely, acute water intoxication. Bolus intravenous administration may cause rigors. Antagonism of both drugs may occur when ribavirin is combined with zidovudine. Ribavirin is contraindicated in pregnant women and in male partners of women who are pregnant because of teratogenicity of the drug. Pregnancy should be avoided during therapy and for 6 months after completion of therapy in both female patients and in female partners of male patients taking ribavirin (pregnancy category X).\n\nReferences available online at expertconsult.com. well tolerated. 84 Ribavirin also comes in 200 mg tablets and sterile solution for injection.\n\nRibavirin aerosol is currently indicated for the treatment of severe RSV in children. Trials of aerosolized ribavirin for the treatment of severe RSV infection in infants have shown no consistent effect on duration of hospitalization time, mortality or on pulmonary functions. 85 Current guidelines recommend that aerosolized ribavirin be considered in the treatment of high-risk infants and young children, as defined by congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease, immunodeficiency states, prematurity and age <6 weeks, as well as for those hospitalized with severe illness. 85 Aerosolized ribavirin has shown minimal efficacy in treating influenza in hospitalized children. 86 Ribavirin has also been studied for the treatment of RSV and parainfluenza virus infections in immunocompromised patients. Intravenous ribavirin appears to be ineffective in reducing RSV-associated mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients with RSV pneumonia; there may be benefit among lung transplant recipients. 87 Aerosolized ribavirin may provide benefit in selected patient groups with less severe RSV disease. Survival was improved when treatment was started before respiratory failure or when infection was limited to the upper respiratory tract. 88 Observational studies suggest that combination therapy with antibodies (either intravenous immunoglobulin, RespiGam or palivizumab) appears more effective, particularly when started before severe respiratory distress. 88 Oral ribavirin has been tried in the management of RSV with variable success. 89 In the management of parainfluenza virus in bone marrow transplant recipients, two case series found that aerosolized ribavirin failed to"}
