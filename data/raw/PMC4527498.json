{"title": "Genetic and antigenic analysis of Chlamydia pecorum strains\nisolated from calves with diarrhea", "body": "Clinical symptoms in diseased calves: Case 1: In May 2010, a Holstein calf\n(female, 84 days old) showed anorexia, pyrexia and diarrhea in a depositary raising farm in\nYamaguchi Prefecture. Despite treatment with antibiotics (kanamycin and tylosin),\nsulfamonomethoxine and antipyretic, the calf died 20 days after the onset of diarrhea. Case\n2: In July 2012, a Japanese black calf (female, 246 days old) on another farm in Yamaguchi\nPrefecture repeated diarrhea despite treatment with antibiotics (kanamycin) and a probiotic\nproduct after the birth, and then, feces were collected during the acute phase for\ndiagnosis. Paired serum samples were collected during the acute and convalescent phases.\n\nIsolation of microorganisms: Tissue specimens obtained from major organs\nincluding cerebrum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon and ideal contents of the dead calf (case\n1) and feces of the second calf (case 2) were minced and homogenized in serum-free Eagle\u2019s\nminimum essential medium with kanamycin (MEM) (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan).\nAfter centrifugation of the 10% homogenate, the supernatant was filtered through a 450 nm\nmembrane (Merck Millipore Ltd., Carrigtwohill, Ireland), and 0.15 ml of the\nsupernatants were inoculated onto hamster lung (HmLu-1) cells, Mardin-Darby bovine kidney\n(MDBK) cells, bovine testicular (BT) cells, human rectal adenocarcinoma (HRT-18) cells and\nVero cells in 24-well plates. After adsorption for 60 min at 37\u00b0C, the cells were washed\nwith MEM, and then, 0.5 ml of MEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin\n(Bovogen Biologicals, Williams Avenue, Australia) was added to each well. The cells were\nincubated at 37\u00b0C, and cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed. After incubation for 10 days,\ncells were frozen and thawed once and then centrifuged. Subsequent passages were carried out\nat least twice in the same manner with 0.15 ml of the supernatant. Gimenez\nstain was used to identify CPE. DHL Agar, Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood and GAM agar\nwith 5% yolk and 0.1% cysteine were used for bacterial isolation. The gene of\nClostridium perfringens toxin isolated from small-intestinal contents was\nidentified by PCR [2].\n\nIdentification of isolates by PCR, sequence and phylogenetic analysis of C. pecorum\nomp1 gene: C. pecorum-infected cells and the supernatants from\norgans described above were used for DNA extraction. Total DNA was extracted using DNeasy\nBlood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Hiden, Germany). PCR was carried out with TaKaRa Ex Taq Hot\nStart Version (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). Primer pairs targeting fragments of\ngenus-specific and species-specific Chlamydia omp1 genes were used for PCR\nas described by Kaltenb\u00f6ck et al. [13]. PCR products were electrophoresed on 2.0% agarose gel and visualized using\nethidium bromide staining. PCR products were purified using MiniElute PCR Purification Kit\n(QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, U.S.A.) and directly sequenced using a BigDye Terminator Cycle\nSequencing Kit v3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX, U.S.A.). Phylogenetic analysis was\nperformed using the MEGA 5 program. Sequence data were aligned using ClustalW method [23]. Genetic distances were calculated using the\nTamura-Nei model [22]. Phylogenetic trees were\nconstructed using neighbor-joining methods [19], and\nthe reliability of the branch was evaluated by bootstrapping with 1,000 replicates.\n\nAntigenic analysis of C. pecorum isolates: The antigenicity of isolates\nwere compared by immunoblot analysis using rabbit antisera [6] to Bo/Yokohama [6], Bo/Maeda [7] and Ov/IPA [6]\nstrains of C. pecorum. Antisera to Bo/Maeda and Ov/IPA strains were\nprepared as described by Fukushi and Hirai [6]. HmLu-1\ncells were infected with C. pecorum 22\u201358, Bo/Yokohama, Bo/Maeda and Ov/IPA\nstrains and C. psittaci Cal10 [9]\nstrain and then incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 until CPE was observed. The cells\nwere recovered from dishes with 0.02% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After\ncentrifugation at 200 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C, the supernatant was removed,\nand the cells were resuspended in PBS. Cells were then mixed with an equal volume of 2 \u00d7\nconcentrated sample buffer consisting of 6.25 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate\n(SDS), 20% glycerol and 0.001% bromophenol blue. Samples were boiled for 3 min, placed on\nice for 3 min and centrifuged at 13,000 \u00d7 g for 3\nmin at room temperature. Cell lysates were electrophoresed using 12% SDS-PAGE\nand transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.). After\nblocking with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 3% gelatin (EIA Grade Reagent Gelatin;\nBio-Rad, CA, U.S.A.) for 45 min at 37\u00b0C, the membrane was washed three times with TBS\ncontaining 0.05% Tween 20 (T-TBS). After incubation with diluted rabbit antisera for 45 min\nat 37\u00b0C, the membrane was washed 3 times with T-TBS. Then, the membrane was reacted with\nperoxidase-conjugated purified recombinant protein A/G (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Rockford,\nIL, U.S.A.) for 45 min at 37\u00b0C. After washing the membrane with T-TBS and TBS three times\neach, specific bands were visualized using 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB;\nWako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan).\n\nRabbit antisera described above were used for the cross-neutralization test. Sera were\nserially diluted twofold in MEM in 96-well microplates. Each dilution was mixed with an\nequal volume of 200 TCID50/0.05 ml of C.\npecorum strains and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. Then, 0.1 ml\n(approximately 6 \u00d7 103 cells) of HmLu-1 cells in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine\nserum was added to each well. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 7 days, antibody titers were\nexpressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum which inhibited CPE\ncompletely.\n\nHistological and immunohistochemical analyses: Tissue specimens obtained\nfrom major organs, intestines and central nervous system of the dead calf (case 1) were\nfixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Paraffin-embedded\ntissues were cut at 2 \u00b5m and stained with hematoxylin-eosin.\n\nThe sections were also used for immunohistochemical detection of C.\npecorum antigens. After deparaffinization and rehydration of the paraffin\nsections, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in 3%\nH2O2 for 10 min. Sections were incubated with 10% normal goat serum\nfor 30 min and then with a rabbit anti-C. pecorum Bo/Yokohama strain\nantiserum [6] (1:2,000) for 30 min. Sections were\nrinsed three times in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 for 10 min and then incubated with\nHistofine Simple Stain MAX-PO (R) (Nichirei Biosciences, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min. The\nsections were rinsed three times in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 for 10 min. The sections\nwere incubated with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride under the microscope to control\ncolor development, washed in tap water for 10 min and rinsed with distilled water. The\nsections were counterstained with Meyer\u2019s hematoxylin.\n\nIsolation of microorganisms and PCR for virus detection: Characteristic\nCPE appeared in HmLu-1 cells inoculated with jejunum homogenate from case 1 (22\u201358 strain)\nat the first passage (Fig. 1). CPE was observed seven days after inoculation. On the other hand, at the second\npassage, CPE similar to that of 22\u201358 strain appeared in HmLu-1 cells inoculated with calf\nfeces from case 2 (24\u2013100 strain). Gimenez staining of HmLu-1 cells infected with these\nstrains revealed many small purplish-red particles. C. pecorum-specific\ngenes were detected from two isolates. In addition, C. pecorum-specific\ngenes were detected from jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon of case 1. Clostridium\nperfringens was isolated from jejunal and ileal contents of case 1 at\napproximately 105 CFU/g. The gene of \u03b1-toxins was shown in these isolates by PCR,\nand isolates were identified as type A (data not shown).\n\nNo other viruses were isolated from specimens, and PCR was also negative for all specimens\nfrom cases 1 and 2 when tested for bovine viral diarrhea virus [27], bovine coronavirus [26],\nrotavirus [3, 10, 25], bovine torovirus [11], bovine enterovirus [12], paramyxoviruses [24], bovine\nadenovirus [14] and bovine herpesvirus 4 [1].\n\nIdentification of isolates by PCR, sequence and phylogenetic analysis: Two\nisolates (22\u201358 and 24\u2013100) were PCR positive when genus-specific and species-specific\nomp1 genes of C. pecorum were targeted. Nucleotide\nsequences of genus-specific PCR products were determined and compared with those of\npublished C. pecorum omp1 genes. Omp1 gene partial\nsequence of the 2 isolates was 100% identical and showed the highest identity (99.8%) to the\nBo/Yokohama strain isolated from cattle with enteritis in Japan. Nucleotide similarities of\nthe omp1 gene between the isolates and other published C.\npecorum isolates were 89.2%, 85.2% and 82.0% for Bo/Maeda strain which was\nisolated from cattle with pneumonia in Japan, Ov/IPA strain which was isolated from sheep\nwith polyarthritis in United States, and 66P130 strain which was isolated from cattle with\nenteritis in United States, respectively (Fig.\n2, Table 1).\n\nAntigenic characterization of C. pecorum isolates: The 38 to 40 kDa major\nouter membrane protein [6] of 22\u201358 strain strongly\nreacted with rabbit antiserum raised against the Bo/Yokohama strain. On the other hand, no\nspecific reaction was detected by immunoblot analysis with rabbit antisera to Bo/Maeda or\nOv/IPA strains (Fig. 3). Antigenicity between isolates (22\u201358 and 24\u2013100) and the 3 strains (Bo/Yokohama,\nBo/Maeda and Ov/IPA) was compared using cross-neutralization tests with rabbit antisera.\nIsolates 22\u201358 and 24\u2013100 were antigenically similar to the Bo/Yokohama strain, but were a\nlittle different from the Bo/Maeda and Ov/IPA strains (Table 2).\n\nNeutralization test for paired sera of case 2: A significant increase in\nantibody against 24\u2013100 strain was confirmed by neutralizing tests using paired sera.\nNeutralizing titers in sera collected during the acute phase of infection were less than\n1:2, but increased to 1:4 during the convalescent phase.\n\nHistopathology and immunohistochemical staining for C. pecorum antigens in tissues\nfrom case 1: Systemic hyperemia and congestion together with necrosis of villi\nwith short or long rod-shaped bacteria in the upper part of the small intestine were\nobserved in tissue sections. Hemorrhagic ileitis with edematous and granulomatous changes\nwas observed in the intestinal crypts of the ileum. Hemorrhagic colitis was observed in the\ncecum and colon. Multiple hemorrhages were observed in the mesenteric lymph nodes. In some\norgans, historrhexis and decreasing staining properties due to postmortem changes were\nobserved. Positive reactions were observed in the jejunal villi by immunohistochemical\nstaining with rabbit anti-C. pecorum antiserum (Fig. 4).\n\nIn this study, C. pecorum was isolated from specimens obtained from 2\ncalves with diarrhea. In case 1, the bacterium was isolated from jejunum, and C.\npecorum specific omp1 genes were detected from several locations\nin the intestines. Additionally, C. pecorum antigens were observed in the\njejunal villi by immunohistochemical staining. Necrotizing enterocolitis due to\nClostridium perfringens infection was also observed. Therefore, we\nspeculated that C. pecorum might exacerbate the disease caused by\nClostridium perfringens.\n\nIn these 2 cases, it is possible that C. pecorum was either the primary\npathogen or an exacerbating factor causing diarrhea. On the other hand, it is thought that\nC. pecorum causes asymptomatic infections [8]. Recently, Poudel et al. [16] reported that asymptomatic endemic C. pecorum infections\nreduce growth rates in calves by up to 48%. They considered that the mechanism of growth\nsuppression by subclinical chlamydial infection was malabsorption of nutrients due to a\nlocal inflammatory response to intestinal mucosal infection. Additionally, despite the\nabsence of clinical signs, chlamydial infection was associated with reduced serum iron\nconcentrations and lower hematocrit values, and infected calves were leukopenic [17]. Mohamad and Rodolakis [15] reported that the persistence of C. pecorum strains\nin the intestines and vaginal mucus of ruminants could cause long-term sub-clinical\ninfection which may affect the animal\u2019s health. This may explain the poor weight gain\nobserved in case 2 after recovery from diarrhea. Further studies on the pathogenesis of\nC. pecorum infections are required.\n\nAlthough the standard method for detecting antibodies to Chlamydiaceae\nspp. in animals is still the complement fixation test [18], our study showed that a neutralization test was also a useful method for\ndiagnosis of C. pecorum infections. In addition, in the dead calf, it was\nconfirmed that immunohistochemistry for C. pecorum antigens was also\nuseful.\n\nGenetic and antigenic analysis showed that 22\u201358 and 24\u2013100 strains were more closely\nrelated to Bo/Yokohama strain isolated from cattle with enteritis than to Bo/Maeda strain\nisolated from cattle with pneumonia and Ov/IPA strain isolated from sheep with\npolyarthritis. Bo/Yokohama-like C. pecorum strains might cause enteritis\nmore than other serotypes. However, the 2 isolates showed higher sequence identities to\nBo/Maeda and Ov/IPA strains than to 66P130 strain isolated from cattle with enteritis in\nUnited States. Thus, sequence identities of C. pecorum omp1 gene might vary\naccording to their geographical background.\n\nThe isolation of similar strains from different locations in separate years suggests that\nC. pecorum might be spreading among the cattle population in Yamaguchi\nPrefecture. An epidemiological study of C. pecorum is being conducted\ncurrently to clarify the seroprevalence and relationship with disease.\n\nIn conclusion, this study showed that C. pecorum isolates similar to\nBo/Yokohama might be endemic in Yamaguchi Prefecture and cause enteric diseases in\ncattle."}
