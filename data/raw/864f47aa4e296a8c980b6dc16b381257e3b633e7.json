Limited data 51 are available about COVID-19 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated 52 with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and 53 the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) might provide insights into COVID-19's effects 54 during pregnancy. 55 Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe 56 respiratory illness and death. Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for COVID-19 57 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected 58 individuals within 14 days of symptom onset. Data suggest an incubation period of ~5 days 59 (range-2-14 days). Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49-56 years, with a third to half 60 with an underlying illness. Children have been rarely reported. Men were more frequent among 61 hospitalized cases (54-73%) . Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, 62 and diarrhea. Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, 63 lymphopenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory 64 distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in 17-29% of hospitalized patients. Overall case fatality rate 65 appears to be ~1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate. In two reports describing 18 66 pregnancies with COVID-19, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were 67 similar to those in non-pregnant adults. Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some 68 cases. All but two pregnancies were cesarean deliveries, and testing for SARS-CoV-2 was 69 negative on all babies tested. The emergence of a coronavirus not previously seen in humans, first reported in Wuhan, China, 97 on December 31, 2019, has attracted much interest throughout the world. Since then, the number 98 of reported cases has increased rapidly, with more than 51,800 laboratory-confirmed cases and Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA, nonsegmented, enveloped viruses, which cause 112 illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe and fatal illness. The term 113 coronavirus derives from the Latin word \"corona\", which means crown or \"halo\"; that 114 designation arises from the appearance of coronavirus virions viewed by electron microscopy, 115 where the virus particles display a crown-like fringe typically referred to as \"spikes\" (Figure 3 ).\n\nIn the past two decades, two other coronaviruses that cause severe respiratory illness in humans consist of fever, chills, headache, malaise, and myalgia. Diarrhea was seen in some patients.\n\nPneumonia was nearly always seen in patients diagnosed with SARS, with mechanical 136 ventilation being required in 10-20% of cases. Case fatality rate was estimated at 9-10% (Table) .\n\nThe natural reservoir for SARS-CoV is believed to be bats; however, some evidence 138 supported civet cats or raccoon dogs as possible intermediate sources of these illnesses. 8 Pregnancy outcomes varied by trimester of presentation. 10 Among the seven women who 156 became ill in the first trimester, four had a spontaneous abortion, two had pregnancy terminations 157 for social reasons after recovery from SARS, and one delivered a full-term healthy infant.\n\nAmong the five women who presented after 24 weeks gestation, four delivered preterm. Three 159 women delivered by cesarean delivery due to deteriorating maternal condition from their SARS 160 illness at 26, 28 and 32 weeks gestation. 11 These babies had birth weights appropriate for 161 gestational age. Two of the infants had respiratory distress syndrome requiring surfactant (born 162 at 26 and 28 weeks gestation), with one later developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. 163 Gastrointestinal complications were observed in two infants, including a jejunal perforation in an 164 infant delivered at 26 weeks and necrotizing enterocolitis with ileal perforation in an infant 165 delivered at 28 weeks gestation. Whether these gastrointestinal complications were related to 166 complications from SARS or its treatment or if they were secondary to preterm delivery is 167 unknown. 11 The two infants who were delivered after their mothers' recovery from SARS had 168 intrauterine growth restriction. No clinical, radiologic, or laboratory evidence for transmission 169 from mother to fetus was observed, despite laboratory testing of different specimens. 12, 13 170 A matched case-control study 14 compared 10 of the 12 pregnant women noted above (two 171 were excluded because they were unable to be matched) to 40 non-pregnant women with SARS.\n\nWomen were matched on sex, age, timing of contracting SARS, health care worker status, 173 underlying illness and whether the woman resided in a housing area where there was a large 174 outbreak. Pregnancy appeared to have no effect on clinical symptoms or time to presentation 175 after symptom onset. However, complications and adverse outcomes were more common among 176 pregnant women: women who were pregnant had a longer hospital stay, were statistically 177 significantly more likely to develop renal failure, sepsis, and DIC, and were more likely to 178 require intensive care unit admission. Forty percent of pregnant women required mechanical 179 ventilation, compared to 13% of non-pregnant patients (p=0.07). Pregnant women were also 180 significantly more likely to die (p=0.01). 181 We identified five reports of additional cases of SARS during pregnancy treated in Hong 182 Kong (n=2), United States (n=2), and Canada (n=1). [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Two of the five women required mechanical ventilation, one required hemodialysis for acute renal failure, and one had seizures 184 and positive cerebrospinal fluid for SARS-CoV, suggestive of a central nervous system infection.\n\nAll patients recovered from their illness. In one case, the pregnancy was terminated at the 186 mother's request; the remaining pregnancies ended in liveborn infants (two at term and two 187 preterm). Testing of neonatal specimens for SARS-CoV RNA was negative. Postpartum patients were asked to observe a 10-day home quarantine. Health care workers were 195 asked to observe a work quarantine in which they were asked to go directly from home to work 196 and vice versa to minimize interaction in the community. Obstetric services considered to be 197 non-essential such as routine ultrasound and prenatal diagnosis were suspended. Although the 198 impact of these interventions was not evaluated, there may be some relevant lessons learned 199 from these experiences during SARS that could help inform the approach to COVID-19. term; among those who were symptomatic, there was one intrauterine fetal demise, one stillbirth, one baby delivered at 25 weeks who died 4 hours after birth, two healthy preterm infants and five 228 healthy term infants (infant status was not mentioned for one). The SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Table) . 247 Sequencing data show that the SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to coronaviruses found in 248 bats, with more than 85% nucleotide identity with a bat SARS-like CoV. 34, 35 The virus has 79% 249 nucleotide identity to SARS-CoV and about 50% to MERS-CoV. 35 Bats appear to be the natural 250 reservoirs of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The emergence of these viruses in humans has 251 been attributed to host switching: the virus \"jumped\" from an intermediary host species (e.g., 252 civet cats for SARS-CoV and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV) to humans. An intermediary 253 host species is thought to be likely for SARS-CoV-2, 35 although it has been yet to be identified.\n\nSequence data that show a high degree (>99.98%) of similarity of the virus among different 255 patients, suggesting a recent emergence in humans.\n\nClinical manifestations of COVID-19 are similar to those with SARS and MERS (Table) . Previous data on SARS and MERS suggest that clinical findings during pregnancy can 303 range from no symptoms to severe disease and death. The most common symptoms of COVID- 304 19 are fever and cough, with more than 80% of hospitalized patients presenting with these 305 symptoms. 36 In a recent study by Chen et al. 44 , nine women diagnosed with COVID-19 during 306 the third trimester of pregnancy were reported. In this small series, clinical presentation was 307 similar to that seen in nonpregnant adults, with fever in seven, cough in four, myalgia in three, 308 and sore throat and malaise each in two women. Five had lymphopenia. All had pneumonia, but 309 none required mechanical ventilation, and none died. All women had a cesarean delivery, and 310 Apgars were 8-9 at 1 minute and 9-10 at 5 minutes. In a second series of nine pregnancies with 311 ten infants (one set of twins) reported by Zhu et al., 45 44 In the report by Zhu et al., 45 some infants were symptomatic 386 (shortness of breath in six, cyanosis in three, gastric bleeding in two, and one baby died of 387 multiple organ failure and DIC); however, throat swab testing of all infants was negative for 388 SARS-CoV-2 , suggesting that these neonatal complications might not be related intrauterine 389 transmission. Thus, at this time, it is unknown if SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from mother-390 to-fetus. Given the current lack of information, it seems reasonable to assume that a newborn 391 born to a mother with COVID-19 at delivery could possibly be infected, either in utero or 392 perinatally, and thus should be placed in isolation to avoid exposure to other newborns. Although 393 the ideal setting for a healthy infant is within a healthy mother's room, temporary separation of 394 an ill mother and her infant, as was recommended during pandemic H1N1, 51 seems prudent.\n\nWhether COVID-19 can be transmitted through breastmilk is unknown. We are aware of a single 396 report of SARS-CoV testing of breastmilk in a mother who had recovered from SARS and no 397 viral RNA was detected; however, the specimen was collected ~130 days after illness onset. 15 398 SARS-CoV antibodies were seen in breastmilk of that patient, 15 \u2022 Patients with respiratory symptoms should adhere to respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, and hand hygiene. Ensure rapid triage of pregnant patients with respiratory symptoms. Patients with respiratory symptoms should wear a facemask and wait in a separate, well ventilated waiting area at least 6 feet from other people. \u2022 Confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 should be isolated as soon as possible in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR). If an AIIR is not available, consider transfer to a hospital with an AIIR. \u2022 Implement CDC infection prevention and control procedures for healthcare providers including standard, contact, and airborne precautions. Eye protection and properly-fitted N95 respirators should be used. Provide additional staff training in correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE) including correct donning, doffing and disposal of PPE. \u2022 Contact hospital infection personnel.\n\n\u2022 In coordination with local/state health department, collect and send relevant specimens for diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing. \u2022 Limit visitor and health care personnel access to patient rooms with a confirmed or suspected case. \u2022 Pregnancy should be considered a potentially increased risk condition and monitored closely including fetal heart rate and contraction monitoring. \u2022 Consider early oxygen therapy (target O 2 saturations \u226595% and/or pO 2 \u226570mmHg).\n\nConsider early mechanical ventilation with evidence of advancing respiratory failure. Non-invasive ventilation techniques may have a small increased risk of aspiration in pregnancy. \u2022 Use intravenous fluids conservatively unless cardiovascular instability is present.\n\n\u2022 Screen for other viral respiratory infections and bacterial infections (due to risk of coinfections). \u2022 Consider empiric antimicrobial therapy (because of risk for superimposed bacterial infections). \u2022 Consider empiric treatment for influenza, pending diagnostic testing.\n\n\u2022 Do not routinely use corticosteroids. Use of steroids to promote fetal maturity with anticipated preterm delivery can be considered on individual basis. \u2022 If septic shock is suspected, institute prompt, targeted management.\n\n\u2022 Delivery and pregnancy termination decisions should be based on gestational age, maternal condition, and fetal stability, and maternal wishes. \u2022 Consult with specialists in obstetrics, maternal-fetal medicine, neonatology, intensive care, anesthesia, and nursing. \u2022 Communicate with patients and families regarding diagnosis, clinical status and management wishes.\n\n*All guidance should be considered subject to revision as additional data on pregnant women with COVID-19 become available. https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=23312"}
