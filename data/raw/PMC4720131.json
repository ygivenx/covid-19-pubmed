{"title": "N-Methylation as a Strategy\nfor Enhancing the Affinity and Selectivity of RNA-binding Peptides:\nApplication to the HIV-1 Frameshift-Stimulating RNA", "body": "The benzo[G]quinoline moiety of compounds 1\u20134 is fluorescent and quenches on binding\nDNA or RNA.29 As such, fluorescence titration\nprovides a simple, direct means for determining compound affinity.\nDissociation constants (KD) measured for\ncompounds 1Z\u20134E are reported in Table 1; titration curves\nare provided in the Supporting Information. In order to evaluate sequence selectivity, binding constants were\nalso measured for each compound to total yeast tRNA (a standard selectivity\nmeasure)30 and to a DNA sequence homologous\nto the FSS RNA. The concentration-independent melting profile of the\nlatter suggests that it is also a hairpin or hairpin-like structure\n(Supporting Information). These results\nindicate that N-methylation enhanced compound affinity\nfor the FSS-RNA relative to 1E and 1Z by\nas much as 100-fold and improved the selectivity relative to tRNA\nby 6- to 65-fold.\n\nTo confirm the high affinity binding and to determine if this resulted\nfrom changes in binding kinetics, compounds 3Z and 4E were further investigated by surface plasmon resonance.\nCompared to the previously reported compound 1Z, N-methyl compounds 3Z and 4E both\nshow an increase in ka with little to\nno change in kd (Table 2 and Supporting Information). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that N-methylation alters the conformational ensemble such that conformers\nclose to the bound form are favored (faster ka) but that the mode of binding is the same (no change in kd). The small difference in KD values measured between the two techniques is not unexpected,\nas SPR utilizes a surface immobilized RNA as opposed to the fully\nsolution-phase fluorescence titration.\n\nWe used flow cytometry to assess the effect of N-methylation on the ability of HIV FSS-targeted compounds to cross\ncell membranes. Dose-dependent cell toxicity was first measured using\na standard WST-1 proliferation assay31 (Supporting Information S20) in HEK293T cells.\nThese experiments established LD50 values for compounds 1Z\u20134E in the range of 20\u201330 \u03bcM.\nFor flow cytometry experiments, HEK293 cells were incubated with either\n5 or 15 \u03bcM of each compound. Cells treated with N-methyl compounds show an increased amount of fluorescence at an\nequivalent concentration to unmethylated compound 1Z,\nsuggesting that N-methylation enhances the ability\nof HIV RNA-targeted compounds to cross the cell membrane (Figure 2).32,33 The rank order of compound penetration (Figure 2) correlated strongly with differences in\ncLogP, with less-polar compounds displaying better permeability. Differences\nin permeability are also readily observable via fluorescence microscopy\n(Supporting Information).\n\nTo assess the effect of compounds 2E\u20134E on viral fitness, an infectivity assay was performed with\npseudotyped HIV.34,23 HEK293T producer cells were transfected\nwith a pro-viral plasmid for HIV in which the nef gene is replaced with green fluorescent protein and the env gene is deleted. A plasmid coding for VSV-G was cotransfected\nto allow for production of single cycle infectious virions. Producer\ncells were incubated with the compound for 24 h, after which the virions\nwere harvested and normalized for viral load based on p24 ELISA. Equal\nloads of these viral particles were then incubated with TZM-bl reporter\ncells that express luciferase under long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter\ncontrol when infected by HIV-1. All new compounds with the exception\nof 2E showed significantly greater antiviral activity\nin this assay than our previously reported compound 1Z, with compound 4E exhibiting the most potent activity\n(Figure 3). Data shown\nin the figure are a composite from two experiments; additional data\nmay be found in the Supporting Information. While factors governing activity in this assay are complex, the\nenhanced potency of the N-methyl compounds likely\nis a function of both their enhanced affinity for the FSS RNA and\nimproved cell permeability. To ensure reproducibility of the observed\nbiological effect, infectivity inhibition assays were repeated for\nselect compounds in a second laboratory (Supporting Information S27).\n\nWe next assayed viral protein production as a\nfunction of added compounds 2\u20134 to\ndetermine if inhibition of infectivity correlated with increased amounts\nof frameshift products. Viral particles were collected and their proteins\nanalyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The primary antibody reacted\nwith the blots recognized p160, the full length Gag-Pol polyprotein\nthat is only made if the \u22121 frameshift occurs, as well as with\np55 and p24, two forms of Gag that are made with or without frameshifting\n(Figure 4). The ratio\nof p160 to p24+p55 was determined as a semiquantitative measure of\nframeshifting. We observed that this ratio increases in a dose-dependent\nmanner and correlated strongly with the ability of individual compounds\nto inhibit the infectivity of pseudotyped virions. As these ratios\ncould be affected by packaging bias, we also examined Gag/Gag-Pol\nratios directly in the cell lysates of producer cells (Supporting Information). We observed similar\ntrends to those obtained from virus particles. In tandem, these results\nare consistent with a direct concentration-dependent enhancement of\nFSS RNA-binding compounds on frameshifting.\n\nTo control for the possibility\nthat FSS-binding compounds might\nalso interact with viral protease, results were compared with an analogous\nassay including the FDA-approved protease inhibitor, indinavir. We\nobserved that indinavir increased the amount of p55 visible on the\nblot, while dramatically decreasing the amount of p24. No buildup\nof p160 was observed. These results strongly contrast with those observed\nfor compounds 2\u20134. We further confirmed\nthat compound activity is independent of HIV protease via a commercial\nprotease inhibition assay (Supporting Information Figure S-9). The compounds do not show any significant protease\ninhibition up to 100 \u03bcM.\n\nWhile\nseveral authors have hypothesized that compound-dependent\nframeshift enhancement could serve as an effective means of limiting\nviral infectivity,10,11,15,16,37 the lack of\nhigh affinity, sequence-selective frameshift RNA-binding compounds\nhas made testing this hypothesis a challenge. Compounds we reported\npreviously reduced the infectivity of pseudotyped virions and enhanced\nframeshifting, but their modest selectivity for the FSS RNA suggested\nthat the antiviral activity could be due to a variety of mechanisms.\nHere, we find that antiviral activity and changes in Gag/Gag-Pol in\nproduced pseudotyped virus particles strongly correlates with affinity\nfor the HIV-1 FSS RNA, as well as cell permeability.\n\nThe enhanced\non rates observed by SPR for 3Z and 4E relative\nto the non-N-methylated compound 1Z are\nintriguing. Very little is known about the relationship\nof binding kinetics and selectivity for RNA-targeted molecules. This\nis in contrast to proteins, for which a consensus is emerging that\nselectivity and efficacy are direct functions of the off rate (frequently\ndescribed as the \u201cresidence time\u201d).35,36 For RNA, and nucleic acids generally, such a broad generalization\nis probably not possible, as there are clearly nonselective binders\n(for example, many intercalators) with slow off-rates. Here, we observe\nan increase in affinity and selectivity for compounds with enhanced\non-rates, but comparable off-rates. We hypothesize that, as with other N-methyl peptides, the enhanced on-rates are the result\nof differences in the ground-state conformational ensemble in which\nthe proportion of binding-favorable conformers are enhanced. Structural\nstudies designed to test that hypotheses are in progress.\n\nTo\ndate, these compounds show the highest affinity for the FSS-RNA\nand are the only class of molecules that alters the products of frameshifting\nand inhibits viral infectivity.37 Tetramethylated\ncompound 4E has the greatest increase in hydrophobicity\nrelative to 1 and also was the most cell-permeable. Further, 4E showed the greatest ability to inhibit the production of\ninfectious virions. Interestingly, 4E also affected not\nonly the ability to make infectious virions but also severely limited\nthe intracellular replication of the virus, as can be visualized via\nGFP production from the proviral plasmid in HEK 293T producer cells\n(Figure 5). Thus, both\nthe compound interferes with production of virus particles and the\nparticles produced are less infective. While the availability of the\ncompound increases with hydrophobicity, and appears to be the major\nlimiting factor for antiviral effects, the discrepancy between compound 2E and 3E indicates that the increase in hydrophobicity\nis not the only governing factor for cell penetration. Based on the\nvarious patterns of N-methylation, it is not unreasonable\nto hypothesize that the differences are due to changes in the conformational\nensembles of these molecules. More broadly, these results support\nthe general hypothesis that synthetic molecules can have useful biological\neffects, when targeted to RNAs believed to have regulatory roles in\nprotein recoding. Given the breadth of critical RNA-regulated frameshifting\nevents discovered in viruses,38\u221240 bacteria,41,42 and even humans,43,44 further exploration of this strategy\nin the context of understanding basic biology and the development\nof therapeutics is warranted.\n\nFluorescence titrations were\ncarried out in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2, using a Horiba FluoroMax 4 fluorometer. All titrations started\nat a volume of 500 \u03bcL with the compound at 20\u2013500 nM.\nThe concentration was chosen based on a preliminary titration using\n1 \u03bcM compound to get a first approximation of the binding affinity\nand then lowered to more accurately measure the affinity. RNA was\nthen titrated in from a high concentration stock (0.5\u201310 \u03bcM\nfor HIV-1 FSS RNA; 10 \u03bcM for HIV-1 FSS DNA and tRNA) in 1\u201310\n\u03bcL increments. After RNA was added, the solution was thoroughly\nmixed in the cuvette via pipetting and allowed to stand for 10 min\nto reach equilibrium. Each measurement was taken three times with\na 1 min waiting period between scans to confirm equilibrium was reached.\nIntensities were corrected for dilution. All titrations were completed\ntwice.\n\nSPR was conducted using a\nBiacore X (Biacore, Inc.). Compounds were injected at a flow rate\nof 30 \u03bcL/min in 10 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl for 2 min. Flow\nwas then maintained for at least 1 h to allow for dissociation. Each\ninjection was repeated twice for consistency. Each trace was fit individually\nto a mass transfer model.\n\nHEK293T cells were\nplated at 1 \u00d7\n104 cells/well in a 96 well plate in DMEM with 10% fetal\nbovine serum and 1% anti\u2013anti (penicillin-streptomycin + fungizone)\nat 37 \u00b0C. After cells were allowed to adhere for 6 h, they were\nthen incubated with the compound for 24 h in triplicate. A total of\n10 \u03bcL of WST-1 premix (Clontech) was added and incubated for\n1 h followed by measurement using a PerkinElmer EnSpire plate reader.\n\nHEK293T cells were grown in DMEM with\n10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 \u00b0C\nto 80% confluency in a 12-well plate and treated with the compound\nfor 24 h. Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and washed twice with\nDPBS (Gibco). Cells were then resuspended in 300 \u03bcL ice cold\nDPBS and incubated with 5 \u03bcL of propidium iodide to stain dead\ncells. A total of 10 000 events were collected using a BD LSR-II\nflow cytometer.\n\nThe antiviral\nactivity of all RNA-targeted\ncompounds was measured by single-round infectivity assay with pseudotyped\nHIV-1 using HEK293T producer cells. The HIV-1 proviral vector (pDHIV3-GFP)\nincludes all HIV-1 NL4\u20133 genes except nef (replaced\nwith GFP) and env, thus preserving gag and pol, and the frameshift required for production\nof the Gag-Pol polyprotein. A single-round infectivity assay was conducted\nby transient transfection of the viral vector with VSV-G coat protein\nvector at a ratio of 1:0.5 using Fugene HD (Promega). The virus producer\ncells were dosed with compounds 4 h after transfection, and viral\nparticles were harvested from the media 24 h after transfecting by\nfiltering through a 0.45-\u03bcm syringe filter. Viral load was normalized\nwith a p24 ELISA (PerkinElmer). The infections were performed using\nTZM-bl reporter cells containing stably integrated firefly luciferase,\nthe expression of which is driven by the HIV-LTR promoter. Therefore,\nluciferase is expressed upon successful HIV infection. Triplicate\ninfections in 96-well plates at 10 000 cells/well with 500\npg p24/well proceeded for 48 h before the addition of SteadyGlo reagent\n(Promega) to each well for 30 min. Luminescence was measured as a\nquantitative metric for changes in viral infectivity in the presence\nof a compound.\n\nThe protease\ninhibition kit was\npurchased from Protein One and used as instructed. HIV-1 Protease\nwas incubated at RT with no compound, a protease inhibitor, or compound\nfor 90 min in the presence of the peptide FRET substrate. Each condition\nwas made in triplicate in a 96 well plate, and the fluorescence was\nmeasured using 490 nm excitation and 530 nm emission using a PerkinElmer\nEnSPire plate reader."}
