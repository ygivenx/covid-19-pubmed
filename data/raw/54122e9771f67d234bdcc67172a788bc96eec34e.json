{"title": "Loss of IKK subunits limits NF-\u03baB signaling in reovirus infected cells 4 5", "body": "unbiased RNA-seq based approach to measure gene expression induced by 23 transfected viral genomic RNA (vgRNA) and reovirus infection, we discovered that 24 mammalian reovirus inhibits host cell innate immune signaling. We found that while 25 vgRNA and reovirus infection both induce a similar IRF dependent gene expression 26 program, gene expression driven by the NF-\u03baB family of transcription factors is lower in 27 infected cells. Potent agonists of NF-\u03baB, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) 28 and vgRNA, failed to induce NF-\u03baB dependent gene expression in infected cells. We 29 demonstrate that NF-\u03baB signaling is blocked due to loss of critical members of the 30 Inhibitor of KappaB Kinase (IKK) complex, NF-\u03baB Essential MOdifier (NEMO) and IKK\u03b2. 31\n\nThe loss of the IKK complex components prevents nuclear translocation and 32 phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB, thereby preventing gene expression. Our studies 33 demonstrate that reovirus infection selectively blocks NF-\u03baB, likely to counteract its 34 antiviral effects and promote efficient viral replication.

In this study, we show that in cells 40 infected with mammalian reovirus, NF-\u03baB is inactive. Further, we demonstrate that NF-41 \u03baB is rendered inactive because virus infection results in reduced levels of upstream 42 intermediaries (called IKKs) that are needed for NF-\u03baB function. Based on previous 43 evidence that active NF-\u03baB limits reovirus infection, we conclude that inactivating NF-\u03baB 44 is a viral strategy to produce a cellular environment that is favorable for virus replication. 45 .

The primary mechanism of innate control of virus infection is the production of antiviral 9 of uninfected cells treated with TNF\u03b1, using the same criteria described above, led to 150 the upregulation of 32 transcripts ( Fig. 2A) . In contrast, TNF\u03b1 has no significant effect 151 on gene expression in cells infected with T3A ( Fig. 2B, 2C, 2D ). These data indicate 152 that infection of cells with T3A results in blockade of NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription. 153 vgRNA and TNF\u03b1 initiate NF-\u03baB signaling via distinct routes. Therefore, our analyses 154 suggest that reovirus blocks NF-\u03baB signaling at a step that is shared by both signaling 155 pathways. 156\n\nour RNA-seq analyses, we measured the capacity of vgRNA and TNF\u03b1 to induce the 158 expression of an NF-\u03baB target gene in reovirus infected cells using RT-qPCR. For these 159 experiments we monitored the transcript levels of I\u03baB\u03b1, an NF-\u03baB target gene. Because 160 the I\u03baB\u03b1 protein inhibits NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation, its expression serves as a 161 feedback inhibitor of NF-\u03baB activity (20) . Consistent with our RNA-seq data, we found 162 that reovirus inhibits I\u03baB\u03b1 expression to a significant extent following treatment with 163 either agonist (Fig. 3A, 3B ). Because the effect of reovirus on both NF-\u03baB agonists was 164 equivalent, we used TNF\u03b1 for the remainder of our experiments. TNF\u03b1 treatment of 165 cells should promote nuclear translocation of p65. We measured nuclear p65 levels in 166 mock-infected and reovirus-infected cells treated with TNF\u03b1. As expected, TNF\u03b1 167 treatment of mock infected cells resulted in an accumulation of p65 in the nucleus within 168 1 h (Fig. 3C ). Prior infection with T3A prevented TNF\u03b1 driven accumulation of p65 in the 169 nucleus. These data agree with previous evidence indicating that degradation of the 170 I\u03baB\u03b1 protein is blocked in reovirus infected cells (21). I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation is initiated by the 171 phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by the I\u03baB Kinase (IKK) complex, which leads to 172 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/843680 doi: bioRxiv preprint polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by the proteasome (9). Thus, the 173 reduction in nuclear p65 levels in T3A infected cells treated with TNF\u03b1 may be due to an 174 absence of sufficient levels of active IKK. In addition to I\u03baB\u03b1, the IKK complex also 175 phosphorylates p65 at Ser536 prior to nuclear translocation (10). IKK-mediated p65 176\n\nSer536 phosphorylation is critical for NF-\u03baB dependent gene expression and is 177 considered to be a marker for IKK activity (10). To determine if IKK activity is 178 compromised in T3A-infected cells, we assessed the capacity of TNF\u03b1 to promote p65 179 phosphorylation at Ser536. While TNF\u03b1 potently induced p65 phosphorylation in mock 180 infected cells, both basal and TNF\u03b1 induced p65 phosphorylation was dramatically 181 reduced in T3A-infected cells (Fig. 3D) of the reovirus replication cycle that is required for the loss of the IKK complex and the 199 inhibition of NF-\u03baB, we treated cells with ribavirin, which diminishes viral gene 200 expression (13, 22) . We found that ribavirin treatment prevented T3A mediated loss of 201 IKK\u03b2 (Fig. 5A) . Consistent with this, in cells treated with ribavirin, T3A was no longer 202 able to prevent TNF\u03b1-driven nuclear accumulation of p65 (Fig. 5B ). Further, ribavirin 203 treatment also reduced the capacity of T3A to block NF-\u03baB dependent gene expression 204 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. In this study, we sought to evaluate if reovirus infection alters the cellular response to 225 pathogen invasion. Using RNA-seq, which allowed us to examine changes in the global 226 transcriptional landscape, we found that target genes of IRF were induced to a similar 227 extent in cells infected with reovirus and cells transfected with vgRNA. NF-\u03baB target 228 genes, however, were expressed to a much lower extent in infected cells in comparison 229 to cells transfected with vgRNA. Moreover, exogenous NF-\u03baB agonists failed to induce 230 a NF-\u03baB dependent gene expression program in infected cells. These data indicate that 231 NF-\u03baB activity is blocked in infected cells. We found that this blockade of NF-\u03baB 232 dependent gene expression is caused by a loss of IKK\u03b2 and NEMO, two critical 233 components of the IKK complex. We propose that reovirus inhibits NF-\u03baB to counter its 234 antiviral effects and produce a cellular environment that is conducive for replication. 235\n\nWe show here that reovirus infection inhibits NF-\u03baB signaling ( Fig. 1, 2 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/843680 doi: bioRxiv preprint 14 blockade of NF-\u03baB (Fig. 5) . Thus, detection of viral RNA activates NF-\u03baB early in 247 infection and expression of one or more viral gene products following establishment of 248 infection results in blockade NF-\u03baB, limiting further signaling through this pathway. 249\n\nBiphasic regulation of NF-\u03baB was also previously suggested (21, 28). Our work 250 presented here provides an explanation for this phenomenon. Serotype-specific 251 capacity of reovirus to inhibit NF-\u03baB is genetically linked to the genome segment 252 encoding the reovirus attachment protein \u03c31 (28). Because \u03c31 properties impact the 253 efficiency of infection and the level of viral gene expression (29), we think that the 254 genetic link between \u03c31 and NF-\u03baB is indirect and the viral factor responsible for 255 diminishment of IKK levels and blockade of NF-\u03baB signaling remains unknown. 256 NF-\u03baB is an effective pro-inflammatory signaling pathway that curbs infection. 257\n\nPathogens therefore have evolved mechanisms to limit its activity. Infection with human 258 coronavirus causes a loss of both IKK\u03b2 and NEMO through an unknown mechanism 259 (30). The MCMV protein M45 targets NEMO for autophagolysosomal degradation (31). 260\n\nShigella, an intracellular pathogenic bacteria secretes an effector with E3 ligase activity 261 which targets NEMO for proteasomal degradation (32). In addition to degradation, 262 pathogens also sequester the IKK complex (IAV NS1 protein) or prevent its activation 263 (HCMV, enterovirus)(33-35). Here we show that reovirus infection leads to the loss of 264 both IKK\u03b2 and NEMO (Fig. 4) . This loss was not due to differences in the steady state 265 levels of IKK\u03b2 mRNA in reovirus infected cells (not shown). It was also independent of 266 the effect of reovirus infection on host translation suggesting that IKK\u03b2 levels were 267 controlled post translationally (not shown). Reovirus does not encode a protease, ruling 268 out a direct effect of a viral protease on IKK\u03b2. Preventing acid-dependent protease 269 suggesting that certain mouse cell types do not require NF-\u03baB for IFN production (37, 281 38), we found in our RNA-seq analyses that inhibition of NF-\u03baB did not affect IFN 282 production ( Fig. 1) . Thus the antiviral effect of NF-\u03baB is independent from IFN. In 283 contrast with IFN, we found that the expression of several other chemokines and 284 cytokines was inhibited in reovirus infected cells. We hypothesize that one or more of 285 these factors negatively regulates reovirus replication. 286\n\nTwo previous studies have suggested that reovirus limits the innate immune 287 response. Reovirus can inhibit IFN production by sequestering IRF3 into viral factories 288 (39). Additionally, reovirus can inhibit IFN signaling by nuclear sequestration of IRF9, 289 which functions with STAT1 and 2 to promote expression of IFN stimulated genes (40). 290\n\nWhile our work did not directly test these ideas, our gene expression analyses indicate 291 that reovirus does not inhibit the function of IRF3 (Fig. 1) .

Because these 293 previous studies were performed in different cell types and used different reovirus 294 strains, we propose that reovirus has evolved multiple mechanisms to dampen the 295 innate immune response. Our study presented here unveils one such mechanism. 296 .
