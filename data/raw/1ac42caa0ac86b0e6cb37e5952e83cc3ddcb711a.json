{"title": "", "body": "History-No delivery of a fetus for longer than 24 h after the onset of stage 1 labor, including a rectal temperature drop below 37.8\u00b0C (lOOOP); greater than 30-60 min of active labor with no fetus delivered; fetal membrane visibility for 15 min or longer; greater than 3-4 h between deliveries;longer than 24 h of labor to deliver the entire litter of puppies or longer than 36 h of labor to deliver the entire litter of kittens; weak and infrequent labor contractions; crying or biting at the vulvar area or flanks; depression, weakness, signs of toxemia, excessive or abnormal vaginal hemorrhaging or discharge. Dystocia is also present if the bitch or queen has gone> 70-72 days since the first breeding, > 68-70 days since the last breeding, or> 58 days of diestrus. Dystocia occurs commonly in brachycephalic breeds of dogs and miniature and small breeds of dogs, although it can occur in any breed of dog and in cats. Physical exam-Open cervix, fetuses palpable, possibly a complicating factor such as a previous pelvic fracture, inadequate or absence of contractions. Mammary enlargement with milk present and lochia are observed. Lochia, or uteroverdin, is a green vulvar discharge which indicates placental separation has occurred. Delivery of a fetus should normally occur within 2 h of the appearance of lochia. Laboratory evaluation-1. Assessment of the patient's serum calcium level may reveal hypocalcemia. 2. Assessment of the patient's blood glucose level may reveal hypoglycemia. 3. If the patient is systemically ill, a CBC and complete serum biochemical profile and urinalysis should be evaluated. Abdominal radiographs-These are valuable in determining the number of fetuses present, their positioning, their size in relation to the pelvic canal, the presence of an obstruction in the birth canal, and possibly, the presence of fetal death. Signs of fetal death which may be apparent radiographically include intrafetal gas patterns, collapse of a fetal spinal column, overlapping or misalignment of fetal skull bones, or fetal positioning which is abnormal. Abdominal ultrasonography-This may be valuable in assessing fetal age, size, number, position, and viability.\n\nThe prognosis is excellent to guarded. I. An episiotomy may be necessary if the vaginal vault is too small to allow vaginal delivery. g. If instruments are needed to assist deliver, use a spay hook, nonratcheted sponge forceps or placental forceps. If the serum calcium level is decreased administer 0.5-1.5 ml/kg 10% calcium gluconate slow IV, while monitoring the heart for bradycardia or arrhythmias. Administer dextrose IVif the patient is hypoglycemic. Administer 5-20 U oxytocin 1M in the dog (2 U/kg up to 20 U); 0.5-3 U oxytocin 1M in the cat. If the bitch or queen is systemically ill or obvious reasons are apparent which will prohibit vaginal delivery, do not administer oxytocin. Start medical treatment (fluid therapy, etc.) and perform a cesarean section as soon as the bitch or queen is stable. Repeat oxytocin every 30-45 minutes for a total of 3 doses, with intermittent vaginal exams and feathering. If no results, recommend a cesarean section. If the patient delivers a fetus, wait another hour between fetuses. Oxytocin can be administered hourly if it is needed and is effective. Anesthesia and surgery 8. Place an IV catheter, begin administration of LRS or Normosol-R IV;\n\n10-20 ml/kg/h until recovered from anesthesia. b. Administer a broad-spectrum systemic antibiotic. c. Use minimal anesthesia o Canine anesthesia \u2022 Premedicate the bitch with butorphanol, 0.45 mg/kg 1M;diazepam, 0.45 mg/kg 1M; and atropine, 0.045 mg/kg 1M, if desired. \u2022 Epidural analgesia may be administered following sedation m Lidocaine, not to exceed 5 mg/kg. II) Bupivacaine, 1 m1/3.5 kg, and/or morphine, 0.1 mg/kg. \u2022 Mask induction is performed with isoflurane and then the bitch is intubated and maintained on isoflurane. \u2022 Small doses of IVdiazepam (0.2 mg/kg IV in dogs, 0.4 mg/kg in cats) and ketamine (6-10 mg/kg IVin dogs, 6 mg/kg 1Min cats) or oxymorphone (0.02-0.2 mg/kg IVin dogs, 0.4 mg/kg 1M in cats) and diazepam (0.3-0.6 mg/kg IVin dogs, 0.2 mg/kg 1M in cats) or propofol (6.5 mg/kg (2.95 mg/lb) IV) may be administered for induction and followed by isoflurane maintenance. II Feline anesthesia \u2022 Premedicate the queen with glycopyrrolate, 0.011 mg/kg 1M 15 min prior to administering anesthetics. \u2022 Induce anesthesia with diazepam, 0.4 mg/kg 1M and ketamine, 6 mg/kg 1M. Then place an endotracheal tube and maintain with isoflurane inhalation. \u2022 The administration of an additional ketamine bolus, 1-2 mg/kg IVmay be beneficial for intubation. \u2022 Intubation may also be facilitated by spraying the vocal folds with 0.5% lidocaine. \u2022 An alternative method is to inject 0.5-1% lidocaine at a maximum dose of 10 mg/kg subcutaneously along the ventral midline incision site after the diazepam and ketamine combination has taken effect. Once the kittens are removed from the uterus, isoflurane may be administered if more anesthetic time is required for completion of the surgery. \u2022 Ifthe patient is depressed or ill prior to surgery,preoxygenate the queen, then administer diazepam, 0.4 mg/kg 1M, or midazolam, 0.2 mg/kg 1M, combined with either butorphanol, 0.4 mg/kg 1M, or oxymorphone, 0.2 mg/kg 1M. If additional anesthesia is needed, administer ketamine, 1 mg/kg IV, or thiopental, 1 mg/kg IV.\n\nd. Remove fetuses as quickly and gently as possible.\n\ne. Administer oxygen to newborns, give 1-2 drops Dopram under the tongue if needed to stimulate respiration. Reverse narcotics with 1-2 drops Narcan under the tongue. Stimulate and warm newborns but do not shake them forcefully. (Forceful shaking may displace surfactant and decrease the ability of the pulmonary alveoli to expand.)\n\nr. Perform an ovariohysterectomy, if the client so desires, or if complications dictate. I. Complete surgery; hospitalize the bitch or queen for recovery separated from the newborns until she is alert, then gradually introduce the offspring to the bitch or queen. h. Dispense 3-5 days' oral antibiotic therapy. I. Givethe client post-operative instructions (suture removal, monitor temperature and vaginal discharge, etc.). 8. Instruct the client to have the bitch and puppies or queen and kittens reexamined by their regular veterinarian in 3-5 days and to call the regular veterinarian's office the next business day regarding care of the dewclaws and tails. 8. The administration of a post -whelping oxytocin injection ('a clean out shot') is controversial. Oxytocin, at 5-20 U 1M, or 2 UIkg up to 20 U in dogs, and 1-3 U in cats, may be administered upon client request. ... ... History-The highest death rate occurs during the first 3 days but the first 2 weeks of life are very hazardous for puppies and kittens. Typically 15-40% of all fullterm neonates die within this time period. Neonatal mortality increases in litters born to older, heavier dams and queens that are older than 3 years of age at the time the first litter is delivered. Postpartum illnesses, such as metritis and mastitis, also increase the rate of neonatal deaths. The environment should be kept at about 29.4\u00b0C(B5\u00b0F) and 55-65% humidity. Heavy-coated breeds and many house pets are better at 21.1\u00b0to 23.0\u00b0C (70\u00b0to 75\u00b0F) with an ambient humidity. Heat lamps can be utilized to warm one portion of the whelping box. A clean, private, quiet and familiar environment is essential. Exposure to infectious diseases should be restricted.\n\nThe normal rectal temperature at birth is 35.6\u00b0to 36.1\u00b0C (96\u00b0to 97\u00b0F). By 7 days of age, the normal rectal temperature has increased to 37.BoC(100\u00b0F). The normal birth weight of kittens is 90-110 g.The kitten should gain a minimum of 7-10 g/day and weigh at least 500 gat 6 weeks of age. Puppies should gain 5-10% 213 I Ii I I of their birth weight per day. They should have doubled their birth weight by 10-12 weeks of age. Persistent crying (for longer than 20 min) is the most common sign of neonatal illness. Other signs include decreased nursing, decreased activity, failure to gain weight, decreased muscle tone and a dry, rough hair coat. Physical exam-The neonates may pile on top of one another if they are hypothermic, or lay widely spaced and avoid contact if they are hyperthermic. Dehydration, abdominal bloating, cyanosis, and pallor may be observed. Weakness, bradycardia, respiratory distress, convulsions, and coma may be observed in neonates suffering from hypoglycemia. Trauma may result in puncture wounds or crushing injuries. Laboratoryevaluation-: 1. Alwaysmeasure the blood glucose level when presented with an ill neonate. 2. If an adequate blood sample can be obtained, perform a CBC and serum biochemical profile. 3. Consider performing a blood culture. 4. Urinalysis and urine culture. An ECG may be beneficial. Radiographs and ultrasound-These may be helpful. The most useful diagnostic test in litter situations is to perform a necropsy.\n\nDue to the rapid onset and progression of clinical signs, and the generally poor response to treatment, the prognosis is guarded to poor, regardless of the underlying etiology. b. If the patient is vomiting, provide nutritional support with either PPN, TPN, or placement of a feeding tube. 8. Treat traumatic injuries and abscesses as with an adult patient.\n\nHistory-The owner may observe swelling of the mammary glandts). The bitch or queen may be febrile, listless, reluctant to nurse, and have a decreased appetite. The puppies or kittens may be weak, crying and ill. Death of the bitch, queen, puppies, or kittens may occur.\n\nPhysical exam-The involved mammary glandts) is(are) warm, painful and feel firm or hard. The milk from the affected gland(s) is(are) abnormal in color and texture. The bitch or queen may have a fever, may be dehydrated and may exhibit signs of sepsis.\n\nLaboratory evaluation-1. A milk sample may be submitted for cytologic evaluation and bacterial culture and sensitivity. Fluid aspirated from the affected gland may be submitted for cytologic evaluation and bacterial culture and sensitivity. 2. The CBCmay reveal leukocytosis with a neutrophilia and degenerative left shift or leukopenia may occur with sepsis. 3. The serum biochemical profile may reveal hypoglycemia and additional changes associated with sepsis or dehydration.\n\nDifferential diagnosis Hematoma, seroma, abscess, galacto stasis, neoplasia.\n\nIf presented early in the disease course, the prognosis is good. Treatment 1. Inform the client of the diagnosis, prognosis, and cost of the treatment. 2. Ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulonate, or cephalosporins are recommended unless the bacterial sensitivity results indicate another antibiotic would be more appropriate. Administer antibiotics for 10-14 days beyond the resolution of inflammation. 3. Administer intravenous fluids to the bitch or queen if dehydration is evident. 4. Treat the bitch or queen for sepsis if indicated. 5. If the infection is mild, encourage nursing from the affected glands to promote drainage. 6. If the mammary gland is severely infected and necrotic, do not allow the puppies or kittens to nurse. In these patients, manual milking should be performed to keep the affected gland(s) empty. 1. Supplement the neonates with commercial milk replacer to assure adequate nutritional support. 8. Apply warm compresses or run warm water over the infected mammary glands several times a day to promote drainage. 9. If the infected mammary gland is abscessed, lancing, draining, and flushing with dilute (l %) povidone-iodine is indicated. The PCVmay be elevated due to dehydration. The PCVmay be decreased due to a nonregenerative anemia of chronic illness. 2. Complete serum biochemical profile may reveal elevations of the BUNand creatinine due to prerenal or secondary renal azotemia, elevated ALT and ALp, and electrolyte abnormalities. 3. Urinalysis-The urine specific gravity is variable, pyuria and bacturia may be present. Cystocentesis is not recommended. 4. Vaginal smear and cytology-Degenerative neutrophils, macrophages, and bacteria may be observed. Abdominal radiographs-These may reveal a fluid-dense tubular structure in the ventrocaudal abdomen.\n\nPatients with an open-cervix pyometra may not have an enlarged uterus visible radiographically. Abdominal ultrasonography-This will assist in evaluation of the uterine size and thickness of the uterine wall. It also helps to confirm that the intrauterine material is of fluid density rather than fetal tissues. a. Administer balanced electrolyte replacement intravenous fluids, such as LRS or\n\nNormosol-R.The rate needed will vary with the patient's status, from shock rates to twice maintenance rates. 4. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics. Avoid aminoglycosides if possible.\n\nUtilize second-generation cephalosporins, trimethoprim-sulfa, or enrofloxacin 8. Administer cefoxitin, 40 mg/kg IV; initially, and continued at 20 mg/kg IV q6-8h in the dog and q8h in the cat. b. Administer trimethoprim-sulfa, 15 mg/kg 1M ql2h. Co Administer enrofloxacin, 5-10 mg/kg IVq12h or 5-20 mg/kg IVq24h. II. For severelyill patients, administer a combination of ampicillin (20-40 mg/kg q8h IV),or a first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin (20 mg/kg q8h IV) or cephalothin (20-30 mg/kg q6h IV), with a fluoroquinolone (enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin), and a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftizoxime (25-50 mg/kg IV; 1M, SCq6-8h), cefotaxime (20-80 mg/kg Iv; 1M q6-8h)). 5. Ovariohysterectomy 8. If the patient is stable with an open pyometra. it is not essential to perform surgery immediately but recommend surgery as soon as possible due to the potential for uterine rupture and peritonitis. b. If the patient has a closed pyometra, immediate ovariohysterectomy is recom-216 mended.\n\n6. If the patient has an open pyometra and the owner wishes to breed the patient during the next heat cycle, medical therapy with prostaglandin F 2u (PGF 2u) may be attempted \u2022. PGF 2u is not approved for use in dogs and cats. b. PGF 2u should not be used in animals older than 8 years of age. c. PGF 2u should not be used in animals that are critically iII. II. PGF 2u should not be used in patients with concurrent diseases or pre-existing uterine pathology. &. The patient should be hospitalized during therapy, as uterine rupture or retrograde expulsion of uterine contents into the abdominal cavity may occur. I. The only product recommended is Lutalyse. D. Broad-spectrum bactericidal antibiotics should be administered simultaneously. h. The Lutalyse dose for dogs is 0.1-0.25 mg/kg SCq24h for 5-7 days. I. The Lutalyse dose for cats is 0.10 mg/kg SC q24h for 5-7 days. I. Side-effects which commonly occur include restlessness, panting, hypersalivation, vomiting, defecation, abdominal cramping, fever, and tachycardia. Hemorrhagic shock may be caused by administering an overdose. II. After treatment with PGF 2u pyometra may recur.\n\nHistory-Vaginal prolapse occurs most frequently in large breed bitches 3 years of age or less. It appears to be most common in boxers and mastiffs. It usually occurs when the bitch is in, or has just been through, proestrus or estrus. The patient is usually presented when the owner notices tissue protruding from the vulva. The bitch may be observed licking at the tissue or refuse to allow intromission. Vaginal prolapse may occur following forced separation during mating. Uterine prolapse is a rare complication of delivery.The cervix or one or both uterine horns may be involved. The owner may observe straining, licking, vaginal discharge, or a mass protruding from the vulva. Physical exam-Vaginal prolapse appears clinically as either swelling in the perineum or a mass projecting from the vulva. The tissue is usually soft, large, smooth, glistening, pale pink to opalescent in color, rounded and reducible. Usuallythe prolapse originates from the ventral floor of the vaginal vault cranial to the urethral orifice. If the vaginal prolapse is severe it may resemble a doughnut and may include the entire circumference of the vaginal wall. The prolapse may be partial or complete. In complete vaginal prolapse, the cervix projects through the vulvar labia. The appearance of a mass protruding from the vulva in a bitch or queen that has delivered within the last 48 h is diagnostic for uterine prolapse.\n\nDifferential diagnosis Benign polyp, neoplasia (leiomyoma or transmissible venereal tumor) and clitoral enlargement.\n\nThe prognosis for resolution is good, if the ability to urinate is maintained and necrotic tissue is debrided. Spontaneous regression of vaginal prolapse occurs during diestrus. 8. Administer a hyperosmotic agent such as 50% dextrose topically to the extruded and engorged mass to decrease swelling and ease manual tissue reduction. b. If urination is not possible, an indwelling urethral catheter should be placed. c. Administer general anesthesia. d. Attempt manual reduction of the vaginal tissue. An episiotomy may allow for increased exposure and easier reduction. .. Keep the tissue clean with saline washes or with pHisoHex. I. Lubricate the mass with water soluble jelly. II. Prevent trauma to the mass \u2022 Apply topical antibiotic ointments or antibiotic-steroid creams.\n\n\u2022 Apply a 'diaper'.\n\n\u2022 Apply an Elizabethan collar.\n\n\u2022 Keep the patient inside on padded and smooth surfaces. h. Debridement of necrotic tissue is necessary. I. Ovariohysterectomy does not hasten mass shrinkage, but will prevent recurrence. I. Surgical excision of the prolapsed tissue may be attempted if the bitch is unable to urinate, if vascular compromise of the bladder, uterus. or vaginal tissue is suspected. or if the vaginal tissue is extremely necrotic. II. If the patient is septic or hypotensive, intravenous fluids, antibiotics and additional therapy should be administered as needed. Uterine prolapse treatment 8. Administer a hyperosmotic agent such as 50% dextrose topically to the extruded and engorged mass to decrease swelling and ease manual tissue reduction. b. Administer general anesthesia or epidural anesthesia. c. Rinse the prolapsed tissue with warm saline. then with an antibiotic rinse.\n\nd. Lubricate the prolapsed tissue with water-soluble jelly. e. Attempt manual reduction of the uterine tissue if the tissue has not been traumatized and appears viable. Use gloved fingers, a long glass tube. or a sterile smooth syringe plunger to assist in reduction. I. If the prolapsed uterine tissue is replaced, administer systemic antibiotics to treat metritis. II. Surgical removal of the uterine tissue should be performed if the tissue has been traumatized or does not appear viable \u2022 Ovariohysterectomy should be performed after manual reduction of the uterine prolapse. \u2022 If manual reduction is impossible, amputate the uterus and reduce the uterine stump.\n\nHistory-The owner observes that the penis of the male dog is protruding for a long period oftime. The penis may appear swollen or abnormal in color. The owner may observe straining to urinate or difficulty urinating. The dog may be observed licking at its penis. Paraphimosis occurs more commonly in the intact male dog, following sexual excitement. Paraphimosis may also occur in long-haired cats but is uncommon. Physical exam-The male dog presents with an engorged protruding penis.\n\nThe penis may be dry or necrotic. The patient may have hematuria, stranguria, or anuria. Strangulation ofthe penis due to string, hair, or a foreign object 218 may be observed.\n\nUltrasonography-Doppler evaluation of the penis may be helpful to determine the presence of active blood flow.\n\nThe presence of a hematoma or foreign debris within the prepuce may prevent retraction of the penis into the prepuce, paralysis of the retractor penis muscles, malformation or fracture of the as penis, chronic priapism, an abnormally large preputial orifice, congenital shortening of the prepuce.\n\nAlthough not generally life-threatening, paraphimosis is an emergency condition. The prognosis for penile tissues depends upon the severity of the vascular compromise and secondary trauma. If the condition has been prolonged, necrosis and gangrene of the penile tissues with secondary systemic complications may become life-threa tening. Treatment 1. Inform the client of the diagnosis, prognosis, and cost of the treatment. 2. Evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status and treat for shock if necessary. 3. Gently rinse the penis with saline or tap water. 4. Applya hyperosmotic agent, such as 50%dextrose, topically to the extruded and engorged portion of the penis to decrease swelling and edema. 5. Application of a cold pack to the extruded and engorged portion of the penis may also aid in decreasing swelling and edema. 6. Administer sedation or general anesthesia. J. Clean the exposed portion of the penis. Remove all hair and foreign debris. 8. Debride necrotic tissue if necessary. 9. Heavilylubricate the exposed portion of the penis and attempt manual replacement. 10. In some cases, a preputial incision may be required. 11. If the penis is severely traumatized and urethral involvement is suspected, place an indwelling soft rubber urethral catheter for 7-14 days. 12. Place a purse-string suture in the tip ofthe prepuce to hold the penis within for 1-24 h.\n\n13. Place an Elizabethan collar on the patient. 14. Infuse antibiotic and steroid ointments into the prepuce daily for 7-14 days. 15. After 1-24 h, remove the purse-string suture and re-evaluate the penis. If the penis appears normal, manually extrude the penis from the prepuce daily for 7-14 days to decrease adhesion formation. 16. If penile necrosis occurs, penile resection and urethrotomy are necessary.\n\nCastration will also be necessary. History-The dog usually has an acute onset of abdominal pain or back pain, fever, vomiting, lethargy, malaise, polyuria, polydipsia, and anorexia. The owner may observe a hemorrhagic preputial discharge or hematuria. Physical exam-The patient may have a fever, varying degrees of dehydration, palpable caudal abdominal pain, discomfort upon rectal examination, and a hemorrhagic preputial discharge or hematuria. The patient may walk with stiff rear limbs. During the rectal examination, it may not be possible to appreciate a change in prostatic size. If the patient has a prostatic abscess, prostatomegaly, asymmetry, and fluctuant areas may be detected. \n\nAbdominal radiographs-May reveal prostatomegaly.\n\nI Abdominal ultrasonography-May reveal prostatomegaly. If a prostatic abscess is I present, ultrasound may reveal intraparenchymal fluid-filled spaces.\n\nBenign prostatic hypertrophy, prostatic neoplasia, periprostatic cysts.\n\nThe prognosis is guarded to poor depending on the severity of clinical signs at presentation. Treatment 1. Inform the owner of the diagnosis, prognosis, and cost of the treatment.\n\n2. Obtain samples for bacterial culture and sensitivity testing. 3. Pending culture and sensitivity results, administer broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\nRecommendations include enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfonamide, and chloramphenicol. 4. If the patient is dehydrated or in shock, administer intravenous fluids. 5. Ifthe patient is severely ill, the antibiotics should be administered intravenously. 6. Prostatic abscesses should be surgically drained. 1. Antibiotics should be administered for 3-4 weeks. Afew days after discontinuing antibiotic therapy, urine or prostatic fluid should be recultured. 8. Castration should be performed when the patient is stable.\n\nHistory-The owner may observe bloody urine, lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, stranguria, dysuria, pollakiuria, or urinary incontinence. The normal ACT for a dog is 60-110 s, and for a cat is 50-75 s.ln acute DlC, the ACT may actually be shorter than the controls and platelet counts may not reflect consumption. Asthe process continues, the ACT will become prolonged (110-200 s in dogs, and 75-120 s in cats), fibrinogen concentrations will diminish, and platelet numbers will be reduced. In end-stage DlC, there is marked prolongation of ACT (>200 s in dogs, and> 120 s in cats). The ACT tubes should be warmed to 37\u00b0C prior to and during the test procedure. Two tubes should be used. 2 ml of blood is taken by clean venipuncture with rapid aspiration from a large vein, directly into the first tube with a vacutainer system, or quickly transferred from a syringe into the first tube and discarded. Without removing the needle from the vein, additional blood is placed into the second tube and the test is performed. The time interval from injection of 2 ml of blood into the ACT tube until the first visible appearance of clot formation is determined to be the ACT. 4. Perform a urinalysis-Differentiate hemoglobinuria from hematuria by centrifugation of a urine sample. In hemoglobinuria, the urine will retain its deep red color. 5. Submit a urine sample, preferably obtained by cystocentesis, for urine culture and sensitivity testing. \n\nThe prognosis is fair to guarded, depending upon the underlying etiology. Treatment 1. Inform the client of the differential diagnoses, prognosis, and cost of the treatment. 2. Perform cystocentesis or urethral catheterization to obtain urine samples.\n\nCystocentesis must be performed with extreme care since the integrity of the urinary bladder wall at this time is often questionable. 3. Perform retrograde urohydropropulsion of urethral calculi if necessary. 4. Hospitalize the patient to monitor urine output. 5. Attempt to diagnose the underlying etiology and treat appropriately. Administer Vitamin K 1 for treatment of anticoagulant rodenticide toxicities, corticosteroids for immune-mediated disorders, perform surgery to remove calculi, etc. 6. Administer intravenous fluid therapy with a balanced electrolyte crystalloid replacement fluid for diuresis and promotion of potassium excretion, except in cases associated with obstruction, until the obstruction is relieved. 1. Administer antibiotics if the patient is catheterized, the patient has an infectious disease, or presurgical. 8. Patients with myoglobinuria from excessive exertion, such as occurs in hunting dogs or other causes of excessive exertion like a stray dog running around the city streets, may have dark urine, brownish rather than red tinged. Treatment includes the administration of intravenous fluids and diuretics until the urine clears. Myoglobin is nephrotoxic.\n\nThe disease is usually idiopathic. A viral etiology has been suspected by some researchers. Struvite crystalluria, in combination with matrix formation, may cause urethral plugs to form. An increased incidence occurs in cats that are indoor/outdoor cats, obesity, and a high-magnesium diet.\n\nHistory-The owner may observe hematuria, dysuria, lethargy, decreased appetite, and excessive licking of the perineal region. The patient may urinate in inap-222\n\npropriate places, often on cool smooth surfaces such as tile, sinks, or bathtubs.\n\nPhysicalexam-Pain may be detected upon abdominal palpation. Usually at least a small stream of urine can easily (cautiously) be expressed. The cat is obviously urinating. The cat is alert and responsive. The heart rate is normal. Femoral pulses are strong and regular.\n\n1. Evaluate the serum BUN. creatinine. potassium. glucose. PCv, and TS as a minimum database. If the client allows. evaluate a CBC and complete biochemical profile with electrolytes. 2. Perform a urinalysis to check for bacturia, crystalluria. casts. etc. 3. Submit urine obtained by cystocentesis for bacterial culture and sensitivity (See Table 9 .1). Lees (1996) . with permissionofW. B. SaundersCo.\n\nAbdominal radiography-May be beneficial for patients with chronic or recurrent\n\nAbdominal ultrasonography-May be beneficial for patients with chronic or recurrent LUTD.\n\nThe prognosis is good to guarded. depending on progression. r. Trimethoprim and sulfonamide. 15 mg/kg ql2h.\n\n4. The administration of amitriptyline. 5-10 mgt cat/q24h PO, may be beneficial in some cases. 5. The administration of DMSO intravesicularly may be beneficial in some cases. 6. Corticosteroid administration is not recommended. 11.\n\nIf alkaline urine with struvite crystalluria is evident in the initial urinalysis, feed the cat a magnesium-restricted, acidifying diet. If the urine pH does not remain under 6.4, administer urine acidifiers such as ammonium chloride, 800 mg/ day or Y< teaspoonful on food, or methionine, 500 mg q12h. Hospitalize the patient for observation. Be extremely cautious to explain to the owner that the cat may develop a urethral obstruction and require catheterization at any time. You may want to inform them of the estimate of charges to relieve the obstruction for the cat at this time, to avoid surprises for the client later. Give the cat a litter pan, Hill's prescription diet feline s/d\u00ae or c/d\", Purina Urological Diet's, or other similar diets and distilled water. Monitor closely for urinary bladder distention and anuria. Upon discharge, dispense the appropriate antibiotics if indicated and a therapeutic diet.\n\nThe etiology is usually idiopathic.\n\nHistory-The owner may observe dysuria, anuria, hematuria, inappropriate voiding, crying, vomiting, lethargy, aggressiveness, and/or pain when the abdomen is handled. The owner often presents the cat because of perceived 'constipation'. Physical exam-Perform a thorough physical examination. Assess the mental state.\n\nEvaluate the hydration status and cardiovascular status. Auscult the heart for arrhythmias. Palpate femoral pulses for strength and character. Palpate the abdomen for a distended urinary bladder (unless the bladder has ruptured), thickened urinary bladder wall, or the presence of cystic calculi. Examine the penis and preputial area. The penis may be edematous, hyperemic, cyanotic, or necrotic. The patient may be severely depressed or comatose if the illness is severe. Bradycardia, hypothermia, hyperpnea, halitosis, and pale mucous membranes with a prolonged capillary refill time indicate severe illness and prolonged urethral obstruction. Laboratory evaluation- 3. Urolith analysis if the patient has urolithiasis. EeG evaluation-Lead II is sufficient. Abnormalities due to poor perfusion and hyperkalemia include a lack of P-waves, a wide QRS. a prolonged QT interval, and tall spiked T-waves. Abdominal radiographs-May be helpful. Urolithiasis, cystic neoplasia, and other abnormalities may be detected on either plain films or with the aid of contrast studies. 224\n\nAbdominal ultrasound-May be useful.\n\nThe prognosis is good to grave. depending on the presence or absence of hematuria. vomiting. hypothermia. depression. azotemia/uremia. cardiac arrhythmias. Treatment 1. Inform the client of the diagnosis, prognosis, cost of treatment and the need for additional. perhaps lifelong, care. 2. Place an intravenous catheter if the patient exhibits any sign of systemic illness. 3. Attempt to relive the urethral obstruction by passing a urethral catheter. Do not attempt to express the urinary bladder. Some clinicians are able to relieve the obstruction in the majority of cats without anesthesia. 4. If anesthesia is necessary, the anesthetic utilized depends on the condition of the cat 8. Ifthe patient is extremely depressed. attempt urethral catheterization without anesthesia. b. Isoflurane via box induction or mask induction. c. Diazepam, 0.5 mg. and ketamine, 5 to 10 mg IVor 1M. d. Propofol, 2-4 mg/kg IV. 5. Relieve the urethral obstruction by gently massaging the penis between the thumb and forefinger. Extend the penis caudally to make the urethra as straight as possible. Avoidinflicting iatrogenic trauma to the penis or prepuce.\n\nGently insert an open-ended 3.5 Fr Tom-cat catheter and flush the urethra with sterile saline or LRS. If the Tom-cat catheter cannot be passed up the urethra, gently insert an ophthalmic lacrimal duct flush cannula. 6. If unable to relieve the obstruction. clip. prep. and perform cystocentesis, then reattempt urethral catheterization 8. Use a 22-gauge needle attached to a flexible intravenous extension set which is attached to a large capacity syringe (20-60 ml). b. Insert the needle through the ventral or ventrolateral wall of the bladder midway between the vertex of the bladder and the junction of the bladder and the urethra. e. Direct the needle through the bladder wall at a 45\u00b0angle.\n\nJ. If the obstruction is very easy to relive and a good stream of apparently normal urine is obtained. express the bladder, flush with sterile saline, and remove the urethral catheter. 8. If the obstruction was difficult to relieve. the urine stream is of a poor size, the cat is uremic, the urine is very bloody, the urine contains large amounts of crystalline debris. or detrusor dysfunction secondary to bladder overdistention is present. suture a 3.5 French red rubber urethral catheter in place (see Figure 9 .1). Measure the distance to the bladder prior to passing the red rubber urethral catheter. to avoid iatrogenic bladder trauma. 9. Flush the urinary bladder with LRS or sterile 0.9% NaCI until the urine is clear.\n\nEmpty the bladder. Mark 'Time O' on the medical record to facilitate monitoring of urine output. 10. If the urinary bladder does not distend when the bladder is flushed with sterile saline. consider that either a urinary bladder rupture or a urethral tear has occurred. Perform contrast cystography followed by immediate surgical repair if necessary. 11. Connect the urinary catheter to a sterile urine collection apparatus. Monitor urine output and adjust fluid therapy as needed. Postobstruction diuresis may occur. Make sure to keep up with fluid losses. Urine output must be at least 1-2 ml/kg/h. Monitor for acute renal failure 8. If the patient is oliguric or anuric, check the patency and positioning of the urethral catheter. The Tom-cat urethral catheters are too short for large cats. Catheters may become dislodged, punctured, or kinked. fIIIln9.1 Securing an Indwelling urethral catheter in a male cat with urethral obstruction. Note two sutures are placed through the skin of the perineal region laterally to the prepuce and through a piece of tape securely fastened around the catheter as it leaves the prepuce. Another piece of tape is used to secure the catheter to the tail, and a 'Chinese fingerlock' suture is used to secure the catheter to this piece of tape.\n\nb. Administer a fluid bolus of 10-15 ml/kg IV ifthe patient is still dehydrated or normovolemic.\n\nc. Administer furosemide, 1-2 mg/kg 1\\1, or mannitol, 0.25-0.5 g/kg IV if the patient is hydrated and oliguric or anurie. d. If the patient has fluid overload, stop the intravenous fluids, administer furosemide, 1-2 mg/kg IVand consider initiating a dopamine CRIat the rate of 2 ug/kg/rnin, 12. Maintain a closed urinary collection system. 13. Initiate intravenous fluid therapy. Start LRS, Normosol-R or PlasmaLyte at the rate of 10 mllkg/h or more, depending upon urine output. Use a biuret or infusion pump to control the fluid rate 8. To calculate the hydration deficit (mild dehydration is 5%, moderate is 8%, severe or shock is 12%): % dehydration x BW(kg) = liters of fluid needed. b. If the patient is mildly dehydrated, administer the hydration deficit over 12 h. c. If the patient is moderately dehydrated, administer the hydration deficit within 4 h. II. If the patient is severely dehydrated or in hypovolemic shock, administer the hydration deficit over 1-2 h. 8. In addition to correcting dehydration, administer fluids at 1.5-3 times maintenance rates of 1-2 mllkg/h. Keep up with postobstructive diuresis losses. r. The fluid rate of each individual patient will vary, but depends on the patient's vital signs, degree of azotemia, urine production, hydration, and mentation. II. Monitor closely to avoid fluid overload and medullary washout. 14. Evaluate an ECG. If the patient has bradycardia and hyperkalemia, the heart will usually return to normal once the obstruction is relieved and fluid administration is underway. 15. Treatment of hyperkalemia 8. If hyperkalemia is mild, up to 7 mEqll, continue LRS, Normosol-R or PlasmaLyte and re-evaluate. b. If hyperkalemia is moderate, 7-8 mEqll, change the intravenous fluids to 0.9% NaCI.\n\nc. If the serum potassium level exceeds 7.5 mEqll, additional therapy is indicated \u2022 Administer 10% calcium gluconate, 0.2-0.5 ml/kg IV over 15 min while monitoring the ECG.The effect lasts about 10-15 min. While this protects the heart from the cardiotoxic effects of potassium, the serum potassium level is not decreased, so an additional therapy is also indicated. \u2022 Administer sodium bicarbonate, 0.5-1 mEq/kg, slow IVover 2-5 min, then infuse an additional 1-2 mEq/kg slow IVover 30-60 min. The serum potassium level is decreased within minutes, and the effect may last up to several hours. \u2022 An alternative method is to administer 20% glucose, 1-2 mllkg IV over 30-60 min. \u2022 If desired, insulin administration may follow glucose administration.\n\nAdminister regular insulin, 0. for an additional 24 h for observation. 23. Culture the urine at the time of urethral catheter removal by aspirating 3-5 ml of urine through the urethral catheter, discarding it, and then aspirating 7-10 ml of urine through the urethral catheter for testing. 24. To decrease urethral spasms, if no obstruction is present 8. Phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzylene\"), 2.5-5 mg PO qI2-24h. b. Valium\", 1-2 mg PO q8-12h for no more than 2 days. c. Aminopropazine (Ienotonev or Peritonee), 2 mg/kg SC or Po. 25. If bladder atony is present, administer bethanacol, 1.25-5 mg PO q8h in conjunction with phenoxybenzamine. 26. When the patient is discharged, dispense the appropriate antibiotic as indicated by the urine culture for 10-14 days of treatment and also dispense a therapeutic prescription diet. 21. Repeat the urine culture 7-14 days after the antibiotic therapy is complete to confirm a negative urine culture. \n\nHistory-Uroliths are found most often in the urinary bladder or urethra. Less than 10% of uroliths are found in the renal pelvis. In dogs with nephrolithiasis or ureterolithiasis, the owner may observe hematuria, sublumbar or abdominal discomfort, depression, anorexia, and vomiting. The owner may observe dysuria, stranguria, pollakiuria, cloudy urine, or notice a foul odor to the urine in dogs with cystourolithiasis or urethral urolithiasis. Physical exam-Perform a thorough physical exam. Assess the mental state. Evaluate the hydration status and cardiovascular status. Auscult the heart for arrhythmias. Palpate femoral pulses for strength and character. Carefully palpate the abdomen. Evaluate the renal size. and shape. Monitor for a pain response during renal palpation. Evaluate the size of the urinary bladder (unless the bladder has ruptured), thickened urinary bladder wall or the presence of cystouroliths. Examine the penis and preputial area. Perform a rectal examination in all dogs and palpate the extrapelvic urethra in male dogs. During an attempt to pass a urethral catheter, the feeling of passing through grit or sand or an obstruction maybe met. Characteristics ofcanine uroliths (see Figure 9 .2)-1. Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) uroliths 8. There is an increased incidence in miniature schnauzers, miniature poodles, bichon frises and cocker spaniels. b. 80-97% of the uroliths which occur in female dogs are struvite. c. They are radiodense.\n\n(c) (d) 8. There is an increased incidence in miniature schnauzers, miniature poodles, bichon frises, Yorkshireterriers, Lhasa apsos, and shih tzus. b. There is an increased incidence in male dogs. c. They are radiodense. II. The urine is usually acidic to neutral. e. Acontributing factor may be the presence of hypercalcemia. 3. Cystine uroliths 8. There is an increased incidence in chihuahuas, Yorkshire terriers, dachshunds, English bulldogs, basset hounds, mastiffs, and rottweilers. b. There is an increased incidence in male dogs. c. Radiodensity of the uroliths is variable. d. The urine is usually acidic. 4. Ammonium acid urate uroliths 8. There is an increased incidence in Dalmatians and English bulldogs. b. There is an increased incidence in male dogs. c. The uroliths are radiolucent in relation to the surrounding tissue densities. d. The urine is usually acidic to neutral. e. Dogs with severe hepatic insufficiency, such as patients with portosystemic shunts, have an increased incidence. 5. Silicate uroliths 8. There is an increased incidence in Golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers, and German shepherd dogs. b. There is an increased incidence in male dogs. c. Radiodensity of the uroliths is variable. d. The urine is usually acidic to neutral. e. A possible predisposing factor is a high dietary intake of silicates, as found in corn gluten and soybean hulls. Laboratory evaluation-1. Urinalysis may indicate inflammation of the urinary tract (proteinuria. hematuria, pyuria, and increased numbers of epithelial cells). 2. Measure urine pH. 3. Evaluate a urine sediment sample microscopically. Urolithiasis may occur without crystalluria, and crystalluria may be observed in the absence of urolithiasis. However, ifboth conditions are present, the composition of the uroliths is usually the same as that of the crystals observed in the urine. Be aware that exceptions do occur. 4. Submit a urine sample, preferably obtained by cystocentesis, for bacterial culture. 5. Asmall section of the urolith or bladder mucosa should be submitted for bacterial culture if a cystotomy is performed to remove cystouroliths. 6. Evaluate a CBC for signs of dehydration or infection. J. Evaluate a serum biochemical profile for signs of postrenal or renal azotemia, hyperkalemia, and other abnormalities. 8. Evaluate the acid-base balance of the patient. Metabolic acidosis is the most common abnormality. 9. Perform abdominocentesis if a urinary tract rupture is suspected. Measure the creatinine level of the peritoneal fluid and compare it to the patient's serum creatinine level.If the peritoneal creatinine level is higher than that of serum, it indicates that urine is leaking into the abdominal cavity and exploratory surgery is necessary. EeG evaluation-May reveal bradycardia and signs compatible with hyperkalemia (flattened P-waves, a prolonged PR interval, widened QRS complexes. and tall or spiked T-waves). Abdominal radiography-May reveal nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis. Doublecontrast-enhanced cystography or retrograde positive contrast-enhanced urethrography should be performed in patients which exhibit the clinical signs of urolithiasis but lack visibly radiodense uroliths on plain radiographs. If the abdominal contents possess a ground glass appearance and the urinary bladder is not visible on the plain films. a urinary tract rupture should be suspected. Abdominal ultrasonography-May be helpful to confirm the presence of cystouroliths, nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, ureterolithiasis, urethral obstruction and dilation. urolithiasis, or the presence offree fluid (urine) in the abdominal cavity.\n\nDifferential diagnosis 1. Nephrolithiasis-Renal cell carcinoma. transitional cell carcinoma, embryonal nephroblastoma, renal metastatic neoplasia (hemangiosarcoma, melanoma. mast cell tumors, carcinomas), pyelonephritis. 2. Ureterolithiasis-ureteral leiomyosarcoma, leiomyoma. extension of bladder neoplasia, compression by intra-abdominal neoplasia, ureteral blood clots. ureteral strictures. 3. Cystolithiasis-cystitis, cystic neoplasia (including transitional cell carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, adenocarcinoma. and hemangiosarcoma). 4. Urethrolithiasis-mucous plug, blood clot, urethritis, fractured os penis. urethral foreign body.\n\nRecurrence is common. The prognosis depends on the degree and duration of the obstruction and the severity of concurrent renal disease. Apermanent urethrostomy may be beneficial to decrease the severity of life-threatening urethral obstruction. Treatment 1. Inform the client of the diagnosis, prognosis. and cost of the treatment. 2. Attempt urethral catheterization to relieve abdominal distension. 3. If urethral catheterization is unsuccessful and the urinary bladder distention must be immediately relieved. perform cystocentesis a. Use a 22-20 gauge over-the-needle catheter. b. After placing the catheter into the bladder. remove the needle and attach extension tubing with a three-way stopcock. Carefullyaspirate urine. avoiding cystic iatrogenic trauma. c. Reattempt urethral catheterization.\n\n4. If urethral catheterization is unsuccessful and the uroliths are located proximal to the os penis, perform urethrohydropropulsion a. Evaluate the shape and size of the uroliths in relation to the patient size.\n\nSmooth uroliths pass easier than those with irregular surfaces. The urolith must be smaller than the smallest diameter of the patient's urethra. b. Assess the size of the urinary bladder. c. Administer sedatives with analgesic and muscle-relaxing effects or administer general anesthesia. d. Pass a soft flexible catheter aseptically into the urethra until contact is made with the urolith. e. Occlude the urethral orifice while injecting sterile saline into the urethra as an assistant compresses the urethra proximal to the obstruction with digital pressure, usually by rectal palpation.\n\nr. The assistant should quickly release the urethral compression as the urethra is dilated by the hydrostatic force of the injected saline. This causes a gradual 230 retropulsion of the urolith into the urinary bladder.\n\nII. Takefollow-up radiographs or double-contrast-enhanced cystograms to assess D c:\n\ncomplete urolith removal.\n\n:::Ill I. Hold the front end ofthe patient up so that the vertebral column is vertical. g. With abdominal palpation. gently agitate the urinary bladder to move uroliths into the trigone region. h. Express urine and uroliths by applying steady digital pressure to the urinary bladder. I. Repeat steps (e) through (h) as needed. I. Take follow-up radiographs or double-contrast-enhanced cystograms to assess complete urolith removal. If unsuccessful, surgical removal of the uroliths is indicated. 8. Place an intravenous catheter and begin intravenous fluid therapy. If a urinary tract obstruction is present. intravenous fluid therapy should be conservative until the obstruction is relieved. Start 0.9% NaCl or 2.5% dextrose in 0.45% NaCI if the patient is hypernatremic. Administer intravenous fluids at the rate of 10 ml/kg/h or more, depending upon urine output. Use an infusion pump to control the fluid rate 8. To calculate the hydration deficit (mild dehydration is 5%. moderate is 8%, severe or shock is 12%): % dehydration x BW(kg) =I of fluid needed.\n\nb. If the patient is mildly dehydrated. administer the hydration deficit over 12 h. c. If the patient is moderately dehydrated. administer the hydration deficit within 4 h. d. If the patient is severely dehydrated or in hypovolemic shock. administer the hydration deficit over 1-2 h. \u2022. In addition to correcting dehydration, administer fluids at 1.5-3 times maintenance rates of 1-2 mllkg/h. Keep up with postobstructive diuresis losses. I. The fluid rate of each individual patient will vary.but depends on the patient's vital signs, degree of azotemia, urine production, hydration. and mentation. g. Monitor closely to avoid fluid overload and medullary washout. 1. Treat metabolic acidosis if the serum HC0 3 < 12 mmolll or if the patient has a bradyarrhythmia 8. Use the following formula to determine the bicarbonate deficit: [HCO] normal (20) -HC0 3 actual] x 0.3 x body weight in kg. b. Give50% of the bicarbonate deficit as sodium bicarbonate. in the intravenous fluids, over 30 min while monitoring the ECG. c. Re-evaluate the blood gas status. If the pH is still critical (pH~7.2 or HC0 3 < 12), continue fluid therapy with sodium bicarbonate added. d. Monitor blood gases q2-6h as needed. 8. Treatment of hyperkalemia 8. If hyperkalemia is moderate, 7-8 mEq/l, administer 0.9% NaCl to re-establish hydration and then re-evaluate the serum potassium level. b. If the serum potassium levelexceeds 8 mEq/l, additional therapy is indicated. n I I I I\n\n\u2022 Administer 10% calcium gluconate, 0.2-0.5 mil kg IV over 15 min while monitoring the ECG. The effect lasts about 10-15 min. While this protects the heart from the cardiotoxic effects of potassium, the serum potassium level is not decreased, so an additional therapy is also indicated. \u2022 Administer sodium bicarbonate, 0.5-1 mEq/kg, slow N over 2-5 min, then infuse an additional 1-2 mEq/kg slow N over 3~0 min. The serum potassium level is decreased within minutes, and the effect may last up to several hours. \u2022 An alternative method is to administer 20% glucose, 1-2 mllkg IV over 30-60 min. \u2022 If desired, insulin administration may follow glucose administration.\n\nAdminister regular insulin, 0.2-0.4 Ulkg IV; and 50% dextrose, 2 g (4 ml)lU of administered insulin IV slowly. Make the intravenous fluids 2.5% dextrose. Be very cautious to avoid severe, prolonged, potentially fatal hypoglycemia. Co Monitor serum electrolytes q2--4h as needed. 9. Treatment of urolithiasis may be either medical or surgical. The medical dissolution of cystine, struvite and urate uroliths has been successful. 3. Urinalysis (see Table 9 .2) 8. Pre-treatment urine specific gravity\u00bb 1.007 to 1.015. b. Renal tubular casts or granular casts may be observed. 4. Evaluate blood gases. Metabolic acidosis is the most common acid-base disorder with ARE\n\nAbdominal radiography-May assist in the evaluation of renal size, and may also assist in the identification of radiopaque uroliths associated with urinary tract infection or urinary tract obstruction. Contrast radiography may assist in the identification of urinary tract obstruction or rupture. For evaluation of the upper urinary tract. perform excretory urography (an intravenous urogram). The dose of iodinated contrast medium in the form of sodium iothalamate or sodium diatrizoate, is 180 mg/kg body weight. For evaluation of the urinary bladder and urethra. perform urethrocystography. The patient should be well-hydrated prior to the intravenous administration of contrast agents. Excretory urography is usually of limited value in patients with ARF, because the kidneys cannot excrete the contrast media well enough to produce diagnostic-quality films. 12.\n\nDuring the rehydration phase, monitor the Cvp' PCv, TS, and body weight frequently 8. The CVPshould not increase more than 5-7 em H 2 0 . Higher increases indicate possible fluid overload. b. Other signs of overhydration include tachycardia, restlessness, shivering, chemosis, exophthalmos, dyspnea, tachypnea, increased bronchovesicular sounds, pulmonary crackles and edema, serous nasal discharge, decreased mentation. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, ascites, polyuria, and subcutaneous edema (particularly of the tarsal joints and intermandibular space). c. If overhydration occurs, slow or discontinue fluid administration. Administer diuretics and/ or vasodilators and oxygen if indicated. Periodically pass a urethral catheter to closely monitor urine output. Minimum urine output should be 1-2 ml/ kg/h. An indwelling urinary catheter may be used but strict aseptic technique and a closed collection system must be utilized. Monitor the patient's body weight every 12 h. Monitor the patient closely for signs of overhydration. After rehydration, induce diuresis with 8 figure 11 .2, p. 324) 8 . Administer a general anesthetic, being cautious to avoid hypotension. b. Consider performing an omentectomy or partial omentectomy, to decrease omental plugging ofthe peritoneal dialysis catheter, particularly in the cat.\n\nc. The surgeon must use sterile technique. Every junction of the peritoneal catheter set must be covered with a povidone-iodine wrap which is changed daily. 236 d. Use a peritoneal dialysis catheter, a pediatric trocath, or for cats, use a 14-GA Teflon IVcatheter with additional side holes, placed all on the same side to preserve the integrity of the catheter. 8. Consider obtaining a renal biopsy at the time the peritoneal dialysis catheter is placed.\n\nr. Make a stab incision (I ern) through the linea alba 2-4 ern caudal to the umbilicus. g. Aim the catheter towards the pelvic inlet. h. Secure the catheter by suturing to the abdominal wall, not just to skin. Use a purse-string suture at the entry site and a 'Chinese finger-lock' suture on the catheter to secure it in position. I. Cover the entry site into the abdomen with a povidone-iodine patch and a sterile bandage. I. Administer systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics. Administer an appropriate dose and at an appropriate frequency for a patient with ARE II. Use warm 1.5%, 4.0%, or 7% dextrose dialysate solution, or LRS, or 0.9% NaC!.\n\n( r. Everyjunction of the peritoneal catheter set and every injection port must be covered with a sterile povidone-iodine wrap which is changed daily. g. Cover the entry site into the abdomen with a povidone-iodine patch and a sterile bandage. h. Keep a clean, dry and sterile bandage on the abdomen, over the catheter entry site. Check the bandage, the entry site and change the bandage every 2 days. I. If at all possible, perform the installation and drainage of the peritoneal lavage fluid in the surgical suite to keep contamination to a minimum. 11. Supplement intravenous fluids with additional potassium as indicated by frequent monitoring of the serum potassium level (see Table 9 .3). 19. Hypocalcemia often occurs with renal failure caused by ethylene glycol toxicity. 20. Hypercalcemia may cause acute renal failure. The treatment is a. Administer intravenous fluid therapy with 0.9% NaC!. b. Administer furosemide, 2-6 mg/kg IVq8h, in dogs, and 0.5-2 mg/kg IVin cats. c. Administer prednisone, I mg/kg 1M or PO q 12h. 23. For maintenance fluid therapy after rehydration, use balanced electrolyte solutions such as LRS or Normosol. Administer fluids at a volume to match urine volume and other losses, including insensible losses (20 rnI/kg/ day) and continuing losses (from vomiting or diarrhea) \u2022. Replace urine output losses over 6-8 h. b. Replace continuing losses from vomiting and diarrhea over 24 h. c. Monitor the serum sodium level. 24. Treat nausea and gastric hyperacidity with H 2 blockers and gastric protectants \u2022. Ranitidine (Zantace), 0.5-2 mg/kg IV; PO q8h (dogs), 2.5 mg/kg IVq12h (cats) or 3.5 mg/kg PO q12h (cats). b. Famotidine (Pepcid\"), 0.5-1 mg/kg IVor PO qI2-24h. c. Cimetidine (Tagamere), 2.5-5 mg/kg IV; 1M,PO q6-8h. d. Misoprostol (Cytotec\"), 0.7-3 Ilg/kg PO or sucralfate (Carafatee), 0.5-1 gPO q6-8h for gastric protection. 25. Xylocaine (lidocaine) Viscous solution\", 2-10 ml, may be applied orally prior to feeding to decrease the discomfort of oral ulcerations. 28. Control vomiting with antiemetics \u2022. Metoclopramide (Reglane), 0.2-0.3 mg/kg SC or 1M q8h or 1 mg/kg/24 h (0.04-0.08 mg/kg/h) CRI IV If the patient is on metoclopramide, it is very important to palpate the abdomen every 2-4 h and closely monitor for intussusception. Avoidmetoclopramide if a mechanical obstruction is suspected, or if the patient has a history of seizures. b. Chlorpromazine (Thorazine's), 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV q4-6h as needed, 0.2-0.5 mg/kg SC, 1M q6-8h, or 1 mg/kg diluted in 1 ml of 0.9% NaCI and administered rectally q8h via a plastic catheter. c. Prochlorperazine, 0.25-0.5 mg/kg SC, 1Mq6-8h. II. Ondanestron (Zofran\"), 0.1-0.2 mg/kg IVq6-12h. .. Trimethobenzamide (Tigans), 3 mg/kg q8h 1Min dogs. 21. Eventually, the fluid needs decrease, usually after 5-6 days of profound diuresis and intravenous fluid therapy. Signs that the fluid volume should be decreased include "}
