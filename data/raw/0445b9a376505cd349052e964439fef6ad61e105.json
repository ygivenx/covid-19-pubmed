{"title": "Chinese Health Care Workers and COVID-19: For Whom the Bell Tolls", "body": "No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bells tolls; it tolls for thee.\n\nDevotions Upon Emergent Occasions, John Donne, 1624 (1) In mid-December 2019, Chinese physicians working in Wuhan, a port city of 11 million people in the central province of Hubei, reported several cases of an undisclosed pneumonia.\n\nUsing a surveillance mechanism that was established following the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, the initial 4 reported cases of \"pneumonia of unknown etiology\" were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which consequently was shut down on How the 2019-nCoV spread from a seafood market to become a worldwide pandemic that collapsed economies worldwide within a matter of months will continue to be the grist for the medical, economic and political mills, now and for the foreseeable future. Certainly, there is plenty of blame to go around, beginning with the early handling of the outbreak by Chinese officials, as well as the agonizingly slow roll out of nCoV testing in the United States.\n\nNotwithstanding the reflexive finger pointing and blame gaming, there is an inspiring backstory of human sacrifice, heroism and courage on the part of the health care workers in China, who were grappling with treating patients with SARS flu-like symptoms, but without any specific knowledge about the virulence or pathogenicity of the disease they were treating. Moreover, the frontline Chinese health care workers provided care without proper personal protective equipment (PPE) to shield them from harm. In a sobering article in the Los Angeles Times entitled \"Doctors and nurses fighting coronavirus in China die of both infection and fatigue,\" (3) Alice Su reports that there were \"18 reported deaths of medical workers involved in the COVID-19 response as of Monday (February 24 th ), including nurses and doctors who died not because of infection but because of cardiac arrest or other ailments due to overwork and fatigue. One victim was hit by a car while taking temperatures on a highway.\" The article also mentions Dr. Peng Yinhua (age 29), who postponed his planned wedding on February 1, so that he could continue to provide care to COVID-19 patients. Dr. Yinhua promised his pregnant fianc\u00e9e that they would have a ceremony after the outbreak had passed: he died of COVID-19 on February 21 st .\n\nIn his epic work \"Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions\", John Donne argues that that the death of any individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it properly (1) (4) . Fully understanding the COVID-19 attributable deaths of healthcare workers in China, and for that matter, the COVID-19 attributable deaths of healthcare workers all around the word will take some time to process, insofar as many of these deaths were preventable. As noted, there is plenty of blame to go around. The unbelievable courage of the men and women who provided care to COVID-19 patients, knowing that they might die from the same mysterious illness that was killing their patients, is an example of what is truly remarkable and best about humanity. Their lesson of sacrifice and selfless caring is one that can never be washed away, nor ever diminished. Not ever. To this end, we dedicate this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science to the Chinese healthcare workers who died from COVID-19, as well as all of the other health care workers around the world who are caring for COVID-19 patients. A partial list of the names of the frontline Chinese physicians and nurses who died of COVID-19 (online search date 3/20/20) follows at the end of this Editors Page."}
