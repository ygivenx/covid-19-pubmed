{"title": "Identification of two antiviral inhibitors targeting 3C-like serine/3C-like protease of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus A R T I C L E I N F O", "body": "Nidoviruses are important pathogens of both humans and livestock; they are enveloped, plus-strand RNA viruses comprising the families Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae (Gorbalenya et al., 2006) . Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member of the family Arteriviridae (Snijder et al., 2013) , has been a major threat to the worldwide swine industry since its discovery in the early 1990s (Wensvoort et al., 1991; Collins et al., 1992) . In 2006, a highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) emerged and prevailed in mainland China, resulting in devastating damage to swine production (Tian et al., 2007) . Currently, HP-PRRSV causes high morbidity and high mortality in infected pigs of all ages and has remained a major threat to the swine producers in China and surrounding countries (Han et al., 2017) . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alpha-coronavirus (Song and Park, 2012) , was first identified in the 1980s in China (Xuan et al., 1984) . PEDV causes a contagious intestinal disease called porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), which is characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration . In October 2010, a large-scale outbreak of PED caused by a PEDV variant occurred in China, resulting in tremendous economic losses (Li et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013 Wang et al., , 2016 Tian et al., 2014) . PRRSV and PEDV are highly virulent and contagious porcine pathogens that cause respiratory and enteric disease in pigs and result in significant economic losses for the intensive pig production worldwide (Li et al., 2012; Snijder et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016) .\n\nIn the PRRSV and PEDV genome, ORF1a and ORF1b comprise approximately 80% of the genome and encode polyproteins (pp1a and pp1b) that are cleaved by viral proteases into intermediate and mature nonstructural proteins (Ziebuhr et al., 2000; Gorbalenya et al., 2006) . The viral proteases involved in polyprotein cleavage are papain-like proteases (PL1pro and PL2pro) and a 3CL serine protease (PRRSV nsp4; 3CLSP)/3C-like (PEDV nsp5; 3CL) protease (Tian et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2016) . During replication, the PL1pro and PL2pro proteases cleave the N-proximal region of pp1a/pp1ab, and the 3CLSP/3CL protease cleaves the viral polyprotein at other conserved inter-domain junctions (Tian et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2016) . The viral 3CLSP/3CL proteases play an essential role in artertivirus and coronavirus replication; therefore, they have received much attention as potential key antiviral targets (including TGEV, FIPV, IBV and SARS-CoV) (Anand et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2008) .\n\nAs RNA viruses, PRRSV and PEDV are prone to mutation under selective pressures in the field, and this may cause the frequent appearances of new variant strains Han et al., 2017) . Moreover, current commercial vaccination approaches against PRRSV and PEDV are only partially effective Du et al., 2017a,b) . To date, effective broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for PRRSV and PEDV infections are not available, although antiviral compounds have been reported previously (Karuppannan et al., 2012; St John et al., 2016; Evans et al., 2017) . This remains an impediment to identifying new inhibitors that target the PRRSV and PEDV 3CLSP/3CL proteases for use as antiviral therapies during disease epidemics. In this study, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying 3CLSP or 3CL protease-mediated inhibition of viral replication and may also guide the development of new broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.\n\nA low-molecular-weight fragment-based library containing approximately 1000 compounds (Specs, Delf, Netherlands) was used for antiviral fragment screening. These fragments are defined as small molecules obeying the Congreve 'Rule of three' in which molecular weight (MW) \u2264 300, the number of hydrogen donors and acceptors \u2264 3 and cLogP \u2264 3 (Congreve et al., 2003) . All these compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Mpbio) at a concentration of 10 mM. Moreover, compounds 1-5 were prepared in DMSO as stock solutions (50 mM).\n\nMarc-145 cells (a PRRSV-permissive cell line derived from MA-104 cells) (Kim et al., 1993) and African green monkey cells (Vero cells; were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM, HyClone), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . Moreover, the HP-PRRSV WUH3 strain (GenBank accession no. HM853673) (Li et al., 2009) and the PEDV FJZZ strain (GenBank: KC140102.1) were used in all assays.\n\nFor expression of PRRSV 3CLSP, the coding sequence was PCRamplified from the PRRSV WUH3 strain cDNA library and inserted into pET-42b (+) with a C-terminal His 6 -tag at the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. All constructs were validated by DNA sequencing. The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), and cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in LB medium containing 50 mg/l kanamycin. When the optical density at 600-nm (OD 600 ) reached 0.8, the culture was cooled to 18\u00b0C and supplemented with 0.8 mM IPTG (isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside). After overnight induction, the cells were harvested via centrifugation at 8500 rpm (30 min, 4\u00b0C). Protein purification followed our previously reported procedure (Shi et al., 2016) . Finally, the harvested protein was concentrated to a volume of approximately 2.0 ml and filtered using a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl and 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). The concentration of the purified protein was determined by detecting the absorbance at 280-nm (A280) using a NanoDrop 2000c UV-vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). PEDV 3CL protease expression and purification were carried out following our previously reported procedure .\n\nThe polypeptide substrate Dabsyl-KTAYFQLE\u2193GRHFE-Edans (Tian et al., 2009 ) and Dabcyl-YNSTLQ\u2193AGLRKM-E-Edans were chemically synthesized by the GenScript Corporation. PRRSV 3CLSP and PEDV 3CL proteases were used at a final concentration of 2 \u03bcM and 0.25 \u03bcM, respectively. Compounds at various concentrations (6.25-500 \u03bcM) were pre-incubated with protease for 20 min at 37\u00b0C, and 1 \u03bcM (3CLSP substrate) or 10 \u03bcM (3CL protease substrate) was added to the mixture in a black 96-well plate. The mixtures were then further incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 min, and enhanced fluorescence due to substrate cleavage by 3CLSP/3CL protease was monitored at 340 excitation and 485 emission. The relative fluorescence units (RFU) were calculated by subtracting the background (substrate control well without protease) from the fluorescence readings. The percentage of inhibition was calculated as follows: Percentage of inhibition (%) = 100 \u00d7 [1 \u2212 RFU of the experimental group (60 min-0 min)/RFU of the control group (60 min-0 min)].\n\nThe 50% cell death toxic concentrations (CC 50 ) of compounds 2, 3 and 5 in MARC-145 cells and Vero cells were determined following our previously reported procedure (Shi et al., 2016) . Briefly, confluent cells grown in white 96-well plates (Corning, Tewksbury, MA, USA) were treated with various concentrations (50-500 \u03bcM) of compounds for 72 h. MARC-145 cells or Vero cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO as control. Cell cytotoxicity was measured using the Celltiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).\n\nMARC-145 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 cells per well. When cells were grown to 70-80% confluence, PRRSV was added with increasing concentrations of compounds 2, 3 and 5 (6.25 \u03bcM, 12.5 \u03bcM, 25 \u03bcM, 50 \u03bcM, 100 \u03bcM and 200 \u03bcM) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1, and then supernatants containing virus and compounds were used to infect MARC-145 cells for 36 h. Then, the harvested supernatant (include PRRSV and compounds) was used for TCID 50 assays. Briefly, MARC-145 cells were seeded in 96-well plates, and infected with serial 10-fold dilutions of supernatant using eight replicates in TCID 50 assays. The plates were incubated for 72-96 h before viral titers were calculated. The TCID 50 assay for PEDV was also performed following the same methods.\n\nMARC-145 cells or Vero cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5 \u00d7 10 5 -1 \u00d7 10 6 cells per well. When cells were grown to 70-80% confluence, the PRRSV WUH3 strain and the PEDV FJZZ strain were inoculated into cells at an MOI of 0.1. Virus-infected cells were incubated in the presence of compounds (6.25 \u03bcM, 12.5 \u03bcM, 25 \u03bcM, 50 \u03bcM, 100 \u03bcM and 200 \u03bcM) for up to 36 h. Then, compound-treated PRRSV/PEDV-infected or control cells (0.4% DMSO) were lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing proteinase inhibitors (Beyotime). Supernatants were harvested, and the total protein for each sample was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Equal amounts of protein for each sample were analyzed by performing 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). After blocking, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with an anti-PRRSV/PEDV nucleocapsid (N) protein monoclonal antibody (1:3000) and an anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (1:5000; Proteintech). Finally, the membranes were incubated with goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody (Boster Biological Technology Co., Ltd.) for 1 h (1:5000). Then, the membranes were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Imager 600, GE Healthcare). Densitometry analysis of the levels of nucleocapsid protein levels have been measured by Image J software, and normalized to GAPDH.\n\nThe crystal structures of PRRSV nsp4 (3CLSP, PDB: 5Y4L) and PEDV nsp5 (3CL protease, PDB: 4XFQ) and the complex structure of PEDV nsp5 (3CL protease, PDB: 4ZUH) were retrieved. Homology models of PRRSV nsp4 and PEDV nsp5 with compounds 2 and 3 were generated using Autodock 4 software. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) and the most likely binding pattern were analyzed using PDBeFold (http://pdbe.org/fold/) and PyMOL (Schr\u00f6dinger), respectively. The amino acid sequences of Arterivirus (PRRSV and EAV) 3CLSP and PEDV 3CL protease were aligned using ClustalW2 (Larkin et al., 2007) and visualized with the ESPript 3.0 server (http://espript.ibcp.fr) (Robert and Gouet, 2014 ).\n\nIC 50 , CC 50 and EC 50 were determined using GraphPad Prism software 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). All experiments were performed in triplicate, and values ( \u00b1 standard deviations [SD]) are shown. Significant differences were determined using Student's t-test. *, P < 0.05 (considered significant compared with control group); **, P < 0.01 (considered highly significant); ***, P < 0.001 (considered extremely significant).\n\nA library of 1000 lead compounds was screened against PRRSV 3CLSP using FRET assays. Preliminary screening was done at 2 \u03bcM PRRSV nsp4, 1 \u03bcM substrate and 200 \u03bcM compounds. Five compounds inhibiting more than 70% of the protease activity under these conditions were selected for further IC 50 measurements (Fig. 1A) . These compounds, designated compounds 1-5, are shown in Fig. 1B ; their Specs ID numbers are AQ-405/42656504, AE-562/12222651, AE-562/ 12222652, AC-907/34117033 and AF-399/13804049, respectively (Table 1 ). Other detailed information is shown in Table S1 .\n\nTo evaluate their inhibitory effects on 3CLSP activity, we added different concentrations (50 \u03bcM, 100 \u03bcM, 200 \u03bcM, 300 \u03bcM, 400 \u03bcM and 500 \u03bcM) of compounds 1-5 to the protease reaction mixture, and the percentage of inhibition was calculated based on the observed fluorescence. All compounds showed concentration-dependent inhibition, with inhibition levels reaching as high as 60-80% ( Fig. 2A-E) . The IC 50 values, estimated by non-linear regression, were 202.3 \u03bcM (compound 1), 144.3 \u03bcM (compound 2), 115.9 \u03bcM (compound 3), 147.8 \u03bcM (compound 4) and 172.9 \u03bcM (compound 5). Meanwhile, the effects of DMSO on 3CSLP activity were also determined (Fig. S1) . Interestingly, 3CSLP activity exhibited a concentration-dependent trend along with increased DMSO concentration (1-10%), which may lead to the high IC 50 values.\n\nTo evaluate the suppression of PRRSV replication by compounds 2, 3 and 5, we added each compound to PRRSV-infected cells over a range of concentrations (6.25 \u03bcM, 12.5 \u03bcM, 25 \u03bcM, 50 \u03bcM, 100 \u03bcM and 200 \u03bcM). The EC 50 values of compounds 2, 3 and 5 were estimated at 57 \u03bcM, 56.8 \u03bcM and 200 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. 3B) . Furthermore, all three compounds showed low cytotoxicity. The CC 50 values of compounds 2 and 3 were estimated at 479.9 \u03bcM and 482.8 \u03bcM (Fig. 3A) , respectively, whereas cell viability was higher than 60% in the presence of compound 5 at 500 \u03bcM (Fig. 3A) . Although significant cytotoxicity was observed at concentrations higher than 200 \u03bcM, compounds 2 and 3 strongly inhibited PRRSV infection at 100 \u03bcM ( Fig. 3A and B) . Hence, our results showed that compounds 2 and 3 significantly inhibited PRRSV replication at non-cytotoxic concentrations (the S.I. values were approximately 8.42 and 8.5, respectively) (Table 1) . Interestingly, we observed that the EC 50 was higher than the IC 50 , which may be due to the presence of a membrane barrier or the high protease concentration (1 \u03bcM) used in the FRET assay, as previously reported (Kumar et al., 2017) .\n\nTo further quantify the inhibitory effects of compounds 1-5, we detected PRRSV nucleocapsid (N) protein expression by western blot (Fig. 3C ). PRRSV N protein was decreased by compounds 2, 3 and 5 in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, no viral N protein was detectable in the presence of compounds 2 and 3 at 100 \u03bcM, which indicated that these compounds markedly inhibited PRRSV propagation in MARC-145 cells. Compounds 1 and 4 did not substantially suppress PRRSV replication (Fig. 3C) ; differences in their molecular structures may cause weak inhibitory effects on PRRSV replication.\n\nPRRSV and PEDV belong to the order Nidovirales and possess similarities in genome organization and strategies for nonstructural and structural protein expression (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . Hence, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of compounds 2 and 3 on PEDV 3CL protease activity in the FRET assay. Both compounds showed concentration-dependent inhibition, with inhibition levels reaching as high as 80% (Fig. 4A) . The IC 50 values were 37.8 \u03bcM (compound 2) and 23.4 \u03bcM (compound 3), as estimated by non-linear regression. Meanwhile, the ability of compounds 2 and 3 to block PEDV replication was also evaluated. The PEDV strain was sensitive to both compounds with EC 50 values of 100 \u03bcM and 57.9 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. 4C) , and PEDV N protein was decreased by compounds 2 and 3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D) . Furthermore, CC 50 values measured in Vero cells were 533.8 \u03bcM and 522.3 \u03bcM (Fig. 4B) , and the S.I. values were approximately 5.34 and 9.02 (Table 1) , respectively. Additionally, our results showed that the protease activity of EAV 3CLSP was inhibited by compound 3 (Fig. S1) . Therefore, compounds 2 and 3 behave as potential broad-spectrum antiviral agents.\n\nThe complex crystal structures of protein-compounds are used to guide the organic synthesis of high-affinity protein ligands and enzyme inhibitors (de Kloe et al., 2009) . In this study, we soaked PRRSV 3CLSP and PEDV 3CL protease crystals with various concentrations of compounds 2 and 3. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain complex structures. Therefore, the potential binding sites were analyzed in detail using molecular simulations to dock compounds 2 and 3 into the PRRSV 3CLSP and PEDV 3CL protease structures ( Fig. 5A and B) . The complex models were initially positioned based on the X-ray structures (Streptomyces griseus proteinase E, SGPE, PDB code: 1HPG; PEDV nsp5: 4ZUH) (Nienaber et al., 1993; Ye et al., 2016) . Grid maps of 40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 40 grid points, centered on the substrates of the complex structures, covered the binding pockets. A population size of 150, mutation rate of 0.02, and crossover rate of 0.8 were set as the parameters. Simulations were performed using up to 2.5 million energy evaluations with a maximum of 27,000 generations. Each simulation was performed 100 times, yielding 256 docked conformations. The lowest energy conformations were regarded as the binding conformations between the ligands and the proteins (Wei et al., 2008) . In the complex models, compounds 2 and 3 interacted with 3CLSP/3CL proteases via extensive hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces ( Fig. 5A  and B) .\n\nThe active sites of the PRRSV nsp4 consist of His39, Asp64 and Ser118; additionally, the S1 specificity pocket is conserved in artertiviruses (PRRSV and EAV) and comprises His133 and Ser136 (corresponding to His134 and His137 of EAV nsp4) (Fig. 5C) (Tian et al., 2009) . Indeed, the active sites (His39, Asp64 and Ser118) and S1 specificity pocket (His133 and Ser136) of PRRSV nsp4 interacted with compounds 2 and 3 via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces (Fig. 5A ). In PEDV, the active sites of the nsp5 was composed of His41 and Cys144, and the S1 specificity pocket consists of Phe139, Ile140, Asn141, Gly142, Ala143, Cys144, His162, Gln163 and Glu165 . Analogously, extensive interactions among compounds 2, 3 and the active site (His41) and S1 specificity pocket (Glu165) of the PEDVnsp5 were also observed (Fig. 5B) . Hence, compounds 2 and 3 may block the recognition and combination of the 3CLSP/3CL proteases and substrates, thereby inhibiting PRRSV and PEDV replication.\n\nMultiple-sequence alignment indicated that the amino acid sequence identity between PRRSV nsp4 and PEDV nsp5 was approximately only 22.2% (Fig. 5C) . Moreover, there were distinct differences between the structures of the 3CLSP and 3CL protease (RSMD is 2.66). Interestingly, the active site His39 in PRRSV nsp4 (corresponding to His41 of PEDV nsp5) is conservative (Fig. 5C) . Meanwhile, these two sites contact compounds 2 and 3 via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces ( Fig. 5A and B) , which may be the reason that compounds 2 and 3 exhibit broad-spectrum activity against PRRSV and PEDV.\n\nPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are major threats to the worldwide swine industry. Currently, both inactivated and live attenuated virus vaccines have been used in the intensive pig farm. Although reducing mortality, the currently used vaccines cannot to control PRRSV and PEDV infection and spread. Furthermore, no commercial drugs are available to prevent their infection. For Nidoviruses, the 3CLSP and 3CL protease are key players in viral replication (Xue et al., 2008) . Hence, the development of anti-viral drugs targeting the 3CLSP and 3CL proteases would become an important strategy for preventing PRRSV and PEDV outbreaks.\n\nIn our experiment, the compounds screening targeting 3CLSP and 3CL protease was used to identify inhibitors that suppress PRRSV and PEDV replication. Meanwhile, to elucidate the binding mechanism of compounds and 3CLSP or 3CL proteases, we simulated the most likely binding conformations using Autodock 4 software. In the 3CLSP and Y. Shi et al. Veterinary Microbiology 213 (2018) 114-122 3CL protease, the S1 specificity pocket is essential for recognition of the side chain of the substrate P1 residue and determination of the enzyme's preference (Tian et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2016) . Hence, the residues of S1 specificity pockets were selected as targets for molecule docking. A total of 256 binding conformations between the ligands and the proteins were obtained, and the lowest energy conformations were used for further analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, compounds 2 and 3 are illustrated as sticks, and the amino acid residues contacting the compounds are shown as lines. Because there is a significant difference in the residues of S1 specificity pockets between PRRSV nsp4 and PEDV nsp5, compounds 2 and 3 were docked into 3CLSP and 3CL protease with different conformations and interactions ( Fig. 5A and B) . Besides, due to the semi-flexible docking was performed, the binding conformations of compounds 2 and 3 with 3CLSP or 3CL protease also exists subtle differences. Nonetheless, their interactions are highly similar ( Fig. 5A and B) . Otherwise, previous studies have shown that the substrate-binding sites and active sites of the 3CLSP and 3CL protease are located between domains I and II in their structures (Tian et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2016) . The amino acid residue His39 in 3CLSP (corresponding to His41 of 3CL protease) plays a vital role in substrate combination and catalysis. Indeed, our docking analysis results suggested that compounds 2 and 3 bind in the substrate channel between domains I and II, which form strongly hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with His39 (or His41) (Fig. 5A) . Hence, compounds 2 and 3 would be broad competitive inhibitors and bind in the substratebinding channel of the 3CLSP and 3CL protease, replacing the substrate. Additionally, our results showed that compounds 2 and 3 could effectively inhibit the replication of PRRSV and PEDV at a micromolar range. Unfortunately, their EC 50 values were high (> 50 \u03bcM), and the selectivity index (SI) values were less than 10 (Figs. 3 and 4; Table 1 ). As lead compounds, compounds 2 and 3 have a low molecular weight (< 250 Da) (Table S1 ). Thus, further medicinal chemistry optimization is available to increase the selectivity index and pharmacokinetic properties (DMPK). Moreover, the substrate-binding channel of the 3CLSP or 3CL protease is a large cavity, supplementary studies may need to more accurately characterize the compound-binding sites to Fig. 2 . Effects of compounds 1-5 on the activity of PRRSV 3CLSP in a FRET assay. Enzymatic activity was measured using substrate at 1 \u03bcM and compounds 1-5 at various concentrations (12.5-500 \u03bcM). Percentage of inhibition (%) = 100 \u00d7 [1 \u2212 RFU of the experimental group (60 min-0 min)/RFU of the control group (60 min-0 min)]. IC 50 was determined using GraphPad Prism software 5. Bars represent the SD from three replicates.\n\nY. Shi et al. Veterinary Microbiology 213 (2018) 114-122 design and optimize inhibitors. For Norwalk virus and feline coronavirus, the transition state 3C-like protease inhibitors were designed and synthesized, and exhibited notable inhibitory effects against viral replication (Tiew et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2013) . Therefore, transition state compounds that will optimally generate hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with the side chain amino acid residues are needed, and animal studies should also be conducted to develop antiviral drugs against PRRSV and PEDV in the future. Finally, our results emphasize the feasibility of developing anti-PRRSV and anti-PEDV inhibitors as a new class of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs as a treatment for exposure to viral agents.\n\nThe emerging, highly virulent PRRSV and PEDV strains have been widespread and prevalent worldwide, and seriously affect and constrain the development of the pig farming industry. In this study, we identified novel antiviral inhibitors that target PRRSV nsp4 (3CLSP), which were designated compounds 2 and 3. These two compounds could substantially inhibit PRRSV replication. Moreover, compounds 2 and 3 exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activities, which target the PEDV 3CL protease and inhibit PEDV replication. Our results will help to guide the development of new broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against PRRSV and PEDV. Then, the harvested supernatant (include PRRSV and compounds) was used for TCID 50 assays. (C) Dose-dependent inhibition of PRRSV nucleocapsid protein production by compounds 2, 3 and 5. MARC-145 cells were treated with 0.4% DMSO as a control, and GAPDH was loaded as an internal control.
