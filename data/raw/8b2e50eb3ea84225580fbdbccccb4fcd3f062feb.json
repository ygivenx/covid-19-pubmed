By comparing fitted parameters, we found that the fitted curve of 48 infected case is the earliest to be saturated and has the lowest semi-saturation period 49 in both COVID-19 and SARS. While all three population groups of SARS is later to 50 saturate and has longer semi-saturation period than that of Conclusions 52\n\nOur model is robust and stable to depict the intrinsic growth rule for the cumulative 53 number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases in 30 provinces, which could 54 depict the epidemic situation in mainland China very well. Despite the virus caused 55 SARS (SARS-CoV) and the virus caused COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) are homologous, 56 their epidemiologic characteristics are quite different. The duration of the outbreak 57 would be shorter for 59 .

The coronavirus 63 was firstly named as 2019-nCoV on January 12, 2020 and may have a probable bat 64 origin (Zhou et al., 2020) . Human to human transmission through 2019-nCoV has 65 been confirmed among closed contacts since the middle of December 2019 (Wang et 66 al. 2020; Li et al., 2020) . As of February 12, 2020, infections of 2019-nCoV have been 67 identified in all Chinese provincial administrative regions and in dozens of countries 68 around the world (Munster et al., 2020; Holshue et al, 2020; Ki et al., 2020; 69 Shigemura et al., 2020; Nshiera et al., 2020) . So far, the coronavirus has been 70 renamed as COVID-19 on February 12, 2020 officially. Different from a previous 71 famous beta coronavirus in 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 72 (SARS-CoV) (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003; Drosten et al., 2003) China. Furthermore, we compared these characteristics with SARS in 2003 using the 81 same model structure in order to validate this model and understand the differences 82 among these two diseases. 83 84 .

The data 89 used in this study include the number of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, the cumulative 90 number of suspected, dead, and cured cases. All cases were laboratory confirmed 91 following the case definition by national health commission of China (from CCDC 92 website). The basic test procedure has been described in detail in previous work 93 (Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) . We only chose the cases that are tested positive 94 by real-time RT-PCR with specific primers and probes to SARS-CoV-2 both at the 95 corresponding provincial CDC and the National Institute for Viral Disease Control at 96 CCDC. We assumed that the population of each region was susceptible to COVID-19, the 105 number of susceptible people per unit time was proportional to the number of 106 uninfected persons, and isolation or closure of the city could affect the spread effect of 107 infected to susceptible people to a certain extent. Previous studies have showed that 108 daily cumulative number of patients could be explained by logistic function (Huang et 109 al., 2003; Wang et al., 2003) . Based on the above assumption and previous studies, we 110 modeled the epidemic information of virus as logistic form (Eq. (1)) 111 .

(1) could be written in the form of Eq. (2) 116\n\nSimilarly, we could write the analytical solutions for the dead and cured cases by Eq. 119\n\n(4) and Eq.

(8) 128 The data processing and modeling were performed on MATLAB (The MathWorks) 134\n\nwith custom scripts. The nonlinear least square (NLS) algorithm was adopted for data 135 fitting and parameter estimation. We used the MATLAB function \"nlinfit\" to 136 .

(8)). Based on our assumption, the 159 growth pattern was supposed to follow a sigmoid form, and the parameter k here 160 denotes how rapid the number of infected cases get to saturate. If k is large, the S form 161 of the curve would be sharp, and the curve will rise up very quickly to be saturated to 162 the maximum number. While if k is only slightly larger than 0, the curve would show 163 a slow and smooth increase from 0 to the maximum. 164\n\nTo further illustrate the spatial distribution of the infected cases' growth pattern, we 166 exerted further analyses of the fitted infected case curves of 30 provinces. We 167 excluded Tibet in this analysis because the number of confirmed infected case did not 168 .

And the only one confirmed case in Tibet has been cured 169 on Feb 12. The spatial distribution of parameter k is shown in Fig 2A, illustrating  170 provinces varied in the increase patterns of cumulative infected cases. Fitted curves of 171 provinces such as Jilin and Qinghai has larger value of k, which means that the 172 number of infections peaked earlier in these regions than in other provinces. By 173 contrast, provinces like Hainan, Hebei, Ningxia, has smaller value of k than other 174 provinces, suggesting the infections of these provinces would continue increasing 175 when infections of other provinces reach saturation (Fig 2B) . Fig 2C shows We found the k value of fitted curves of infected SARS cases in Beijing was 0.18, 193 which was much lower than that of Hubei province of COVID-19 (k = 0.25) (Fig 3  194 ABC). Furthermore, we found that all 30 provinces' k value were significantly larger 195 than 0.18 (Fig 3D) . We also noted the t 0 of fitted curves of infected SARS cases in 196 .

Moreover, the increasing rate (k) was negatively 198 correlated (Pearson, r=-0.47, p=0.0072) to semi-saturation period (Fig 3F) . We 199 concluded that at the provincial level, the COVID-19 spread more quickly than the 200 SARS did. The infections of COVID-19 increased more rapid and would reach 201 saturation earlier than SARS according to our model. by two parameters, k and t 0 (Fig 4 DEIJ) . We found that k values of the three types 211 cases of SARS were lower than that of COVID-19 (Fig 4 DE) , and semi-saturation 212 period for them in SARS was higher than COVID-19's, which suggested the duration 213 of COVID-19 would be shorter than that of SARS. For both 214 their infected curves have the lowest semi-saturation period (Fig 4 EJ) , while cured 215 curves have the highest which is in keeping with the common sense that the cure is 216\n\nHubei, the k values of death case curves were lowest compared with curves of 218 infected cases and cured cases. For both SARS and COVID-19, the k value of infected 219 case curve was larger than that of cured curve.

We used a differential equation in logistic form to describe the 232 dynamics of the infected, dead and healed cases caused by COVID-19 respectively 233 (See Methods). The increasing of the population no matter in which type of case 234 (infection, death or recovery) has multiple reasons. When the outbreak of COVID-19 235 originated in Wuhan, it did not cause too much concern at the beginning so that it 236 leads to many infections and starts to export potential exposed cases to other 237 provinces. But as the successive closure of the cities in Hubei province, and isolation 238 of the community in all the provinces in mainland China, the virus spread tendency 239 was weakened. In our model, we also considered these measures taken by the 240 government. We rewrote Eq. (1) to Eq. (9).

The growth of cured cases would again be slow since 252 the number of patients is limited. All these facts were considered in our highly 253 summarized model (Eq. (8) ) in a macroscopic scale. All data sets have a R-square 254 greater than 0.95 when fitted by our framework, so that we could further discuss some will be quicker to pass away than SARS.

For both SARS and 283 COVID-19, the k value of infected case curve was larger than that of cured curve, 284\n\nwhile that of death case is the lowest. 285 286 .
