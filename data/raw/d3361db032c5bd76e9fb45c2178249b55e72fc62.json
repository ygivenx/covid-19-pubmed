{"title": "The complete sequence of the bovine torovirus genome", "body": "Toroviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with a pleomorphic virion morphology. The first report on toroviruses described the identification of an unclassified virus from diarrheic calves (Woode et al., 1982) , now designated as the Breda virus (BRV), or bovine torovirus (BoTV), two serotypes of which have been identified (BoTV-1 and BoTV-2). The virus is endemic in cattle herds, with asymptomatic cows possibly acting as reservoirs.\n\nToroviruses have also been reported in humans with gastroenteritis (Beards et al., 1984; Duckmanton et al., 1997; Jamieson et al., 1998) and pigs (Kroneman et al., 1998; Smits et al., 2003) . Antibodies reacting against BoTV and EqTV antigens have been detected in various other mammals, suggesting toroviruses may be widespread (Brown et al., 1987; Weiss et al., 1984) .\n\nIn vitro studies on EqTV grown in cell culture demonstrated the generation of sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNAs) for translation of the ORFs coding for the structural proteins. Approximately 16 kb of sequence from the 3 end of the genome, and approximately 1.5 kb from the 5 end of genome have been determined. These sequence data have revealed the basic torovirus genome organization and the presence of conserved replicase domains (Snijder and Horzinek, 1993) . These findings were instrumental in the revision of the Coronaviridae taxon to include the genus Torovirus, as well as the creation of the order Nidovirales which currently includes the families Coronaviridae (comprising two genera, Coronavirus and Torovirus), Arteriviridae and Roniviridae (Cavanagh, 1997; Cavanagh et al., 1994; Cavanagh and Horzinek, 1993; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2003) . The complete genome sequence of EqTV has yet to be published, although Smits et al. (2003) reported the completion of the EqTV genome sequence in a recent study of torovirus field variants. The published sequence of BoTV is limited to that of the structural genes, which account for approximately 7.5 kb of the 3 end of the genome (Cornelissen et al., 1997; Duckmanton et al., 1998a,b) . Consequently, the genus Torovirus remains the only genus within the order Nidovirales without a representative complete genome sequence.\n\nIn this study, we sequenced the entire genome of the bovine torovirus, BoTV-1, using long RT-PCR followed by the sequencing of amplicons. Assembly of the sequences resulted in a genome of 28,475 nucleotides. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a nidovirus-like replicase gene with conserved domains.\n\nBoTV-1 was obtained from Dr. Gerald Woode, as described (Duckmanton et al., 1998a,b) . The virus, consisting of stool specimens from gnotobiotic calves infected with the original Breda-1 virus, was aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C.\n\nBoTV-1 RNA was extracted from fecal specimens as described (Duckmanton et al., 1998a,b) using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ont., Canada). The RNA was resuspended in 10 l of ddH 2 O containing 10% 100 mM dithiothreitol (Invitrogen) and 5% 20-40 U/l RNasin (Promega, Mississauga, Ont.) , and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C.\n\nPrimers used in RT-PCR (synthesized by Invitrogen) were designed using Gene Runner 3.05 (Hastings Software, Inc.) , based on the available BoTV-1 sequence, and EqTV sequence (GenBank accession no., X52374, and X56016). Primer names, sequences, and positions within the BoTV-1 genome are given in Table 1 . One primer, APPR-RS, was designed within a conserved region of the coronavirus open reading frame (ORF) 1a of the replicase gene. This region was first identified by ORF1a amino acid alignment, followed by the corresponding nucleotide alignment of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), GenBank accession no. NC001451, nucleotides (nts) 3646-3699; human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E), NC002645, nts 4193-4246; murine hepatitis virus (MHV) A59, NC001846, nts 4239-4292; and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), AJ271965, nts 4365-4418. Alignments were done using ClustalX 1.8 (Thompson et al., 1997) . The sequence of the APPR-RS primer was based on the consensus sequence of the nucleotide alignment described above. The EEAT7 primer used in the amplification of the 3 non-coding region (3 NC) is a coxsackie virus B6 specific primer (Martino et al., 1999) . The complementary sequence of the first 21 nucleotides (3 -5 ) of this primer were incorporated into the BRE-3 NC-CVB6 primer used in the reverse transcription reaction. Lastly, the AAP-CVB6 primer used in the 5 RACE PCR reaction was designed to bind within the poly(A) of the cDNA transcripts, and contained sequence complementary to the 3 end of the EEAT7 primer, allowing for the option of using EEAT7 in a reamplification of 1st round PCR products.\n\nThe long RT-PCR was done essentially as described (Tellier et al., 1996a (Tellier et al., ,b, 2003 . Briefly, purified viral RNA was thawed on ice, incubated at 65 \u2022 C for 2 min then placed back on ice. To the RNA was added 10 l of a master mix composed of 4 l of 5\u00d7 1st Strand Synthesis Buffer (Invitrogen), 0.5 l of RNasin (20-40 U/l) (Promega), 1 l of 100 mM dithiothreitol (Invitrogen), 1 l of a 10 mM solution of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ), 2.5 l of a 10 M solution of antisense primer, and 1 l of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture was incubated at 42 \u2022 C for 1 h, after which 1 l each of RNase H (1-4 U/l) and RNase T1 (900-3000 U/l) (Invitrogen) were added and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 20 min. Ten-fold dilutions of the newly synthesized cDNA were then prepared using ddH 2 O and the neat and diluted cDNA samples were kept on ice for use in PCR or stored at \u221280 \u2022 C.\n\nThe PCR master mix was composed of 5 l of 10\u00d7 Advantage 2 PCR Reaction Buffer (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), 1.25 l of a 10 mM solution of dNTP mixture (Amersham Position in the BoTV-1 genome refers to the binding site of the primer. Where three or more primers are listed in a primer set, the first primer listed was the primer used in the RT reaction-BRE-1A-RS was used as the RT primer in production of template for PCR reactions with primer sets 6, 7 and 8, and GSP1 was used as the RT primer in production of template for PCR reactions with primer sets 10-12. Primer 1ASEQ-RS1 was used with BRE-1A-S and 1ASEQ-S2 was used with BRE-1A-NRS to generate amplicons H 1 and H 2 , respectively. The names of the amplicons given in the \"Primer Set\" column refer to the amplicons generated with the given primer set-amplicons are displayed schematically, relative to the BoTV-1 genome, in Fig. 1 . \"*\" indicates the primer was designed using EqTV sequence. Primer EEAT7 is a coxsackie virus B6 specific primer designed by Martino et al. (1999) . The 3 end of this primer was incorporated into the BRE-3 NC-CVB6 RT primer, allowing for the use of EEAT7 in PCR. Primer 1A-APPR-RS was designed using coronavirus consensus sequence in a conserved domain within the 5 end of POL 1a (see ). The abridged anchor primer was the primer supplied by the Invitrogen 5 RACE kit and binds within the poly(C) tail, whereas the AAP-CVB6 primer was designed to bind to the poly(A) tail of cDNA transcripts produced in the 5 RACE reactions (see Section 2 for details).\n\nBiosciences, Piscataway), 1 l each of a sense and antisense primer (10 M solution), 1 l of Advantage 2 DNA polymerase (Clontech), and 38.75 l of ddH 2 O for each 50 l reaction. The mixture was aliquoted in a thin-walled PCR tube (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and overlaid with 40 l of molecular grade mineral oil (Sigma). The master mix was transferred to a room dedicated for cDNA synthesis where 2 l of the RT (or dilution) was added under the oil and the reaction tube was transferred to a Robocycler thermal cycler (Stratagene) in another room. Unless indicated otherwise, all PCR reactions were carried out as follows: 35 cycles of denaturation at 99 \u2022 C for 35 s, annealing at 67 \u2022 C for 30 s, and elongation at 68 \u2022 C for a time specific for the target amplicon (Table 2) . Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the approach used to amplify the BoTV-1 genome by long RT-PCR. Several reactions required modifications from the protocol given above. For 2nd round amplifications where 5 l of unpurified 1st round PCR product was used as template (e.g., amplicon J), the PCR master mix was adjusted accordingly: 4.5 l of buffer was used to account for the buffer already present in the template and the volume of ddH 2 O was adjusted to bring the reaction volume to a total of 50 l. For 2nd round \n\nFor PCR with multiple elongation times, the times and cycles are given in chronological order. The letters given in the \"PCR\" column refer to the amplicons shown in Fig. 1 . The \"Template\" column provides the dilution of the RT or TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase reaction of the 5 RACE) template used in PCR. See Table 1 for primer details. Z: 1st round PCR product was purified from an agarose gel and used as template in 2nd round PCR. Y: 1 l of 1st round PCR was used as template in a hemi-nested PCR reaction. 1-10 l of the first round PCR product was purified from an agarose gel; a 10 \u22121 dilution of the purified DNA was used in 2nd round PCR. 2: The annealing temperature used for both 1st and 2nd round PCR was 65 \u2022 C \u00d7 30 s. 3: The annealing temperature used in both 1st and 2nd round PCR was 50 \u2022 C \u00d7 1 min. 4-40 l of 1st round PCR product was purified from an agarose gel; undiluted and 10 \u22121 to 10 \u22123 dilutions of the purified DNA were used as template in 2nd round PCR. *: Amplicons K and L were obtained via 5 RACE reactions-see Section 2 for details. PCR where the template used was an amplicon purified from an agarose gel, only the ddH 2 O was adjusted, to bring the final reaction volume to 50 l. The RT protocol was modified for amplicon J, using the RT primer listed in Table 1 , primer set 10. After thawing on ice, the 2.5 l aliquot of primer was added to the RNA and the mixture was heated at 99 \u2022 C for 5 min (Kostouros et al., 2003) ; the remainder of the reaction was carried out according to the protocol above.\n\nThe 5 RACE kit (Invitrogen) was used for amplification of the extreme 5 end of the BoTV-1 genome, according to the manufacturer's protocol with modifications. The RT was performed using the protocol above, with Superscript II, GSP1 primer, and with the adjusted RNA denaturation incubation time and temperature of 99 \u2022 C for 5 min as above. The cDNA was purified using QIAquick PCR clean-up kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ont., Canada) according to the manufacturer's protocol and eluted in 30 l of supplied elution buffer. The cDNA tailing reaction was performed with the terminal deoxynucleotidal transferase enzyme supplied with the kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol with the exception of an increased incubation time of 5 min at the protocol specified 94 \u2022 C. Tailing was performed in the presence of dCTP (provided), or dATP (Pharmacia). PCR was performed with Advantage 2 DNA polymerase using the protocol above, with modifications: 5 l of the tailing reaction was used as template, and 2 l of each primer were used (instead of 1 l each); the volume of the ddH 2 O was adjusted accordingly to bring the final reaction volume to 50 l. \n\nPurified amplicons were submitted for automated sequencing of both strands, which was carried out by the DNA Sequencing Facility, Centre for Applied Genomics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ont., Canada. Amplicons were cut out of agarose gels under direct visualization on a Dark Reader transilluminator (Clare Chemical Research Inc., Dolores, CO), with a disposable scalpel and the DNA recovered in 40-50 l of the supplied elution buffer using Clontech Nucleospin Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The initial sequencing reactions were done using the PCR primers. This sequence then allowed for the design of sequencing specific primers. The sequencing continued in a similar step-wise fashion until the sequences of the top and bottom strand crossed over, at which point the remaining sequencing primers could be designed in a single step.\n\nThe individual sequence fragments were aligned and assembled using Gene Runner Version 3.05. The fully assembled BoTV-1 genome sequence was analyzed using Gene Runner; multiple alignments with ClustalX 1.8 (Thompson et al., 1997) , BLAST, and PSI BLAST search programs (Altschul et al., 1997) ; secondary structure and protein fold prediction using the 3D-PSSM Protein Fold Recognition (Threading) Server (Fischer et al., 1999; Kelley et al., 1999 Kelley et al., , 2000 (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/\u223c3dpssm/); and RNA pseudoknot secondary structures were identified using MFOLD Version 3.1 (Zuker, 2003) (http://www.bioinfo.rpi. edu/applications/mfold/old/rna/).\n\nThe Breda-1 torovirus sequence was entered into the Virus Orthologous Clusters (VOCs) database for analysis and comparison using the complete coronavirus database and suite of tools (www.sarsresearch.ca).\n\nComposition vector trees (CVTrees) were generated using several complete genome sequence of representative viruses in the order Nidovirales, including members of all genera. The CVTrees were generated using the CVTree program (Qi et al., 2004a,b) (http://cvtree.cbi.pku.edu.cn), using a value of K = 5.\n\nThe BoTV-1 genome was reverse transcribed and amplified in 8 RT-PCR reactions yielding 8 overlapping products ( Fig. 1 ) (amplicons A-E and I-K-amplicon K is the 5 RACE product, not shown in Fig. 1 ). Five additional amplicons, F-H 2 , which overlapped the large 10,164 bp amplicon (E), were obtained to facilitate sequencing. Lastly, the 5 end of the genome was amplified for sequencing using two 5 RACE reactions.\n\nThe complete BoTV-1 sequence was assembled from the sequences of overlapping amplicons. The total genome was composed of 28,475 nts and had a G + C content of 38%. The genome sequence has been deposited in GenBank with the accession no. AY427798.\n\nSequencing of the genome upstream of the structural genes yielded 20,920 nts of novel BoTV-1 sequence. Although all amplicons were sequenced on both strands, four positions were identified where two different nucleotides were equally credible at each of these four positions based on the analysis of the chromatograms on both strands. These ambiguities were considered genuine; only two of these resulted in a change of amino acid (nt positions 1895 and 9470).\n\nAnalysis of this novel sequence identified two large ORFs that overlap by 13 nts. This arrangement is common to the nidovirus replicase gene, and the two ORFs were identified as ORF1a and ORF1b (Snijder and Horzinek, 1993) . The 5 end of the genome begins with a non-coding region of 858 nts. The torovirus 5 non-coding region is substantially larger than the coronavirus 5 non-coding region-the two largest being TGEV at 314 nts and IBV at 528 nts. Given the difficulty in amplifying this region of the genome (the full-length RACE amplicon of 464 bp (amplicon J, Fig. 1 ) was only obtained when an increased time and temperature of RNA denaturation were used), we suspect that strong secondary structures exist.\n\nTo confirm the previously reported sequence of BoTV-1 (approximately 7.5 kb comprising the 3 end of the genome) (Duckmanton et al., 1998a,b) , this region was re-sequenced. Comparison of sequences showed an identity of 97% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels for the M, HE, and N genes and for the 3 non-coding region. The sequence of the S gene in this study was 93.1% in agreement at the nucleotide level, and 91.6% at the amino acid level compared to that reported by Duckmanton et al. (1998a,b) . Differences were scattered except for a cluster of discrepancies between the two sequences in the small region 21,773-21,985 of the sequence reported here, which displays only 57.7% identity with the corresponding region of the previously reported sequence. Comparison of the sequence reported here with the S gene sequence of the B145 BoTV isolate published by Smits et al. (2003) revealed an identity of 95.5% at the nucleotide level and 97.2% identity at the amino acid level.\n\nThe length of the HE gene was 9 nts longer from that reported previously for BoTV-1 and BoTV-2 (Cornelissen et al., 1997; Duckmanton et al., 1998a,b) , extending the protein sequence by 3 amino acids. A stretch of seven thymidine residues (27, 721) , as opposed to eight in the previously reported sequence, is responsible for this difference. This resulted in a shift of the ORF leading to extension of the gene and protein sequence. The sequences of several BoTV isolates characterized by Smits et al. (2003) are in agreement with the length of the HE gene/protein sequence reported here. Of the six isolates sequenced within the structural genes, four of these had HE genes of 1260 nts, identical to what is reported here. The other two isolates contained HE genes shorter by only 3 nts, although the structural genes were identified as having undergone recombination with a porcine torovirus resulting in an HE gene of mixed origin (Smits et al., 2003) .\n\nThe sequence of the 3 non-coding region matches the previously reported sequence with only two mismatches. With the primer used in the reverse transcription reaction, a portion of the poly(A) tail was amplified in PCR. Consequently, sequencing of this amplicon included poly(A) sequence ensuring that the extreme 3 end of the genome had been amplified and the last nucleotide at the 3 end of the genome had been determined. Fig. 2 illustrates the potential ORFs of the BoTV-1 genome. Table 3 lists the gene and protein characteristic of the BoTV-1 genome, based on currently known genes of the family Coronaviridae.\n\nThe putative replicase gene of BoTV-1 is comparable to the replicase gene of the coronaviruses in many aspects. Most obvious is its size, which at 20,201 nts in length is comparable to the coronavirus replicase genes with a range of 20-22 kb (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . The putative ORF1a of 13,338 nts and ORF1b of 6876 nts encode a ORF1a/1b fusion polyprotein (pp1a/1b) of 6733 aa. A nucleotide sequence comparison of ORF1b between BoTV-1 and EqTV, the latter having been reported previously (Snijder , 1990) , revealed a high degree of identity. At the nucleotide and amino acid level the two viruses display 83.8 and 91.0% identity, respectively. Therefore, it is not surprising that similar potential secondary structures were identified in the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap, and the same conserved domains of ORF1b identified in EqTV and other nidoviruses were also found in BoTV ORF1b (Snijder et al., 2003 (Snijder et al., , 1990 . The ORF1b protein product is believed to be translated via a ribosomal frameshifting event generating the pp1a/1b fusion polyprotein. The two elements required for efficient ribosomal frameshifting, a slippery sequence and a RNA pseudoknot (Brierley, 1995) , were demonstrated in EqTV (Snijder et al., 1990) . The heptanucleotide slippery sequence found in BoTV, UUUAAAC, (nts 14,148-14,190 ) is identical to the slippery sequence identified in EqTV and the coronaviruses (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Snijder et al., 1990) . Secondary structure prediction of the ORF1a/1b overlap region identified two potential RNA pseudoknot structures downstream of the slippery sequence (Fig. 3) . Not surprisingly, these two structures are very similar to those predicted for EqTV.\n\nDue to the relatively high degree of identity between BoTV and EqTV in pp1b, the conserved domains that have been identified in BEV, including the RNA dependant RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase, as well as domains with homology to cellular proteins involved in RNA processing (Snijder et al., 2003 (Snijder et al., , 1990 have also been identified in BoTV (Fig. 4B) .\n\nAnalysis of the BoTV-1 ORF1a revealed several interesting features. This ORF encodes a protein of 4445 aa (pp1a), larger than the pp1a of the majority of the coronaviruses, with the sole exception of the 4470 aa MHV pp1a. The pp1a of the nidoviruses also contain conserved domains with functions important to viral replication. All nidoviruses studied to date contain at least one protease domain within pp1a, Fig. 3 . Predicted pseudoknot structures in the BoTV-1 ORF1a/1b overlap region. A and B represent the two structures predicted using MFOLD software in the analysis of the ORF1a/1b overlap region. Loop 1,2 and stem 1,2 in (A) and (B) refer to structural features of the depicted pseudoknots. Note that the two structures have identical hairpin loops, but differ in the region downstream of the hairpin which folds back to bind to the loop of the hairpin structure, i.e., B has a larger loop 2 and a different stem 2 of the pseudoknot. Also note that loop 2 in B has the potential to form an internal secondary structure. C and D are schematic representations of A and B, respectively. The 5 and 3 orientations are given in each figure. The ORF1a stop codon is underlined in A and B, and the slippery sequence, UUUAAAC, is boxed in all four figures. The dashed line in B indicates that the \"C\" residue can potentially bind to either of the G residues, or both. A and C show BoTV-1 nucleotides 14,184-14,255; B and D show nucleotides 14,184-14,305 . (Snijder et al., 2003) . known as the 'main' protease or 3C-like protease (3CLP), after the picornaviruses 3C protease, and located within the C terminus of the pp1a protein (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . Although all of the nidoviruses possess this domain, the protease is slightly different in each family. The coronavirus 3CLP contains a cysteine as its catalytic nucleophile, but does not appear to contain an acidic residue common to the catalytic triad, His-Asp(Glu)-Cys, found in this family of proteases (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . The 3CLP of the gill associated virus (GAV), genus Oakavirus, family Roniviridae, is also a cysteine protease and like the coronavirus 3CLP, possesses a Cys-His catalytic dyad . Finally, the arterivirus main protease is referred to as a 3C-like serine protease (3CLSP) due to the presence of a serine nucleophile in the triad His-Asp-Ser, more common in the cellular homologues, such as the pancreatic enzyme chymotrypsin (Snijder et al., 1996) . It was, therefore, surprising to find that the main protease of BoTV appears to be a serine protease, similar to the arterivirus 3CLSP. Repeated attempts at aligning the BoTV sequence with the coronavirus 3C protease failed to provide a convincing alignment. The results presented here were obtained with supporting data from PSI BLAST analysis, the protein sequence alignment shown in Fig. 5A , and secondary structure prediction analysis using the 3D-PSSM protein fold recognition (threading) server that identified the BoTV main protease sequence reported here as having trypsin-like or chymotrypsin-like protease folds.\n\nIn addition to the main protease, the nidoviruses, with the exception of GAV (Cowley et al., 2000) , contain one or more 'accessory' protease(s) in the N-terminus of pp1a (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . In both the coronaviruses and arteriviruses this protease is a cysteine protease with homology to papain, referred to as the papain-like protease (PLP) (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . Like the SARS human coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and IBV, the torovirus PLP is present as a single domain and although it has homology with the coronavirus PL2 pro , the torovirus PLP is more similar in size and has a greater degree of identity with the leader protease (L pro ) of the picornaviruses foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) and equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV). This is supported by PSI BLAST analysis, protein fold prediction suggesting folds that are similar to the FMDV leader protease, and the alignment shown in Fig. 5B .\n\nHydrophobic domains are additional conserved domains that are common to the pp1a of all nidoviruses. These domains are conserved in the relative positions within the pp1a protein of all of the nidoviruses. The hydrophobic domains identified in BoTV maintain this configuration (Fig. 4A) .\n\nAlso, a domain was identified in pp1a of BoTV-1 which has homology to the adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1phosphatase (ADRP) processing enzyme family mediating the removal of a phosphate from the adenosine diphosphate ribose 1 -phosphate substrate in the cellular RNA processing pathway (Martzen et al., 1999) . Although this domain is present in other ssRNA viruses such as the alphaviruses, and in bacterial and eukaryotic proteins, the Coronaviridae are the only other nidoviruses to date to contain this domain (Snijder et al., 2003) .\n\nSequence analysis of pp1a revealed that the 3 end of this protein displayed similarity to the non-structural protein 2a, found in coronaviruses such as MHV and HCoV-OC43. The same region of EqTV's pp1a also contains similarity to this protein (Snijder et al., 1991) . Recently, this domain has been identified as a putative cyclic phosphodiesterase (Snijder et al., 2003) .\n\nComposition vector trees (CVTRees) are a new method of inferring phylogeny using complete genome sequences. A distance matrix is generated from comparison of the predicted proteomes of the viruses, calculating the frequency of short amino acid sequences of a fixed length (K-tuples of amino acids, K being a parameter that can be adjusted in each analysis). Phylogenetic trees can then be built from the distance matrix using standard methods such as the Neighbor Joining (NJ) or Minimum Evolution (ME) methods (Chu et al., 2004; Qi et al., 2004a,b) . This method circumvents the difficult, Fig. 5 . (A) Alignment of the putative BoTV-1 3C-like serine protease with the arterivirus 3C-like serine protease.

For each viral sequence, the positions of the N-and C-terminal residues, within ORF1a, are given. and often impossible task of making alignments of distantly related sequences, and analyzes the entire genomes rather than sections which may have evolved separately. Since we report here the first complete torovirus sequence it is the first time that such an analysis can be done with representatives of all genera in the order Nidovirales (Fig. 6) . The trees in Fig. 6 , calculated using a value of K = 5, illustrate a topology only, since calibration of branch lengths in CVTrees present several complications (Qi et al., 2004a,b) . Nonetheless, interesting inferences on evolutionary relatedness can be drawn from the topology alone. It is noteworthy to observe that whereas the arteriviruses and the coronaviruses each form a cluster in both trees, BoTV-1 is quite distinct from both clusters in these trees. \n\nDespite the evidence suggesting that toroviruses infect many different species, most of our understanding of these viruses at the biochemical and antigenic levels comes from studies of EqTV and BoTV (Koopmans and Horzinek, 1994) . Our knowledge of their molecular biology has come mainly from studies using EqTV grown in cell culture. However, a complete torovirus genome sequence or ORF1a sequence has yet to be reported. This has hampered detailed characterization of this genus in terms of molecular biology, evolution, and taxonomy.\n\nLong RT-PCR followed by direct sequencing of the amplicons had been used previously to amplify and sequence the 7.5 kb of the 3 end of the BoTV-1 genome encompassing the structural genes and 3 non-coding region (Duckmanton et al., 1998a,b) . The limited BoTV sequence available for primer design posed a challenge, which was overcome by the use of available sequence from related viruses such as EqTV and the coronaviruses. Using this approach almost 21 kb of novel BoTV-1 sequence was obtained without the benefit of cultured virus. With the availability of the complete genome sequence of BoTV-1, and with more than half of the EqTV genome sequence reported, future studies involving the molecular characterization of other toroviruses should be greatly facilitated. For example, the identification and characterization of the human coronavirus responsible for the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was successful, in part, due to the use of RT-PCR assays targeting conserved domains within ORF1b of the viral replicase gene (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003) .\n\nThe 28,475 nts genome is reported here with confidence that the sequence is complete. The methods used to amplify the extremities of the viral genome ensured that the extreme 5 and 3 nucleotides were internal to the primers used in RT-PCR amplifying the respective areas of the genome. The sequence of first nucleotide at the 5 end of the viral genome was scrutinized further by performing two separate 5 RACE reactions using two different nucleotides in the tailing reactions. The sequences of the two 5 RACE amplicons could then be compared and the first nucleotide of the genome could be distinguished from the poly-nucleotide tail.\n\nThe sequence of the structural genes and 3 non-coding region reported here is in agreement with that previously reported for BoTV-1 (Duckmanton et al., 1998a,b) . There are a small number of discrepancies which may be due to the different sequencing methodologies used (automated sequencing was used in this study and ought to be more accurate). The differences may also point to a quasispecies in BoTV-1, which is not unlikely since it is a RNA virus, and differences in the sequencing data may arise through use of different sequencing primers. In that regard, it is remarkable that most differences occur at isolated nucleotides except for a region of 217 nts in the putative bulbous domain (S1) of the spike glycoprotein. This is highly reminiscent of a well-characterized hypervariable region in the S1 domain of the spike glycoprotein of the murine hepatitis virus (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Rowe et al., 1997) .\n\nComparison of the sequences of the structural genes and 3 non-coding regions of BoTV and EqTV previously showed that the two viruses share a relatively high degree of sequence identity (Duckmanton et al., 1998a,b) . Comparison of the ORF1b sequences of EqTV and BoTV further supports these findings with a nucleotide identity of 83.3% and amino acid identity of 91% and an identically sized ORF of 6876 nts. Thus, it was not surprising that the same conserved domains identified in BEV were found in BoTV pp1b including the newly identified domains with homology to cellular proteins involved in RNA processing, with potential roles in viral replication identified by Snijder et al. (2003) .\n\nThe identification of two potential pseudoknot structures in the ORF1a/1b overlap region of BoTV that are virtually identical to the structures identified in EqTV (Snijder et al., 1990) reaffirms that one or both of these structures are important in the translation of ORF1b, although experimental data will be required to confirm these predictions in BoTV.\n\nPp1a of BoTV contains 3C-like Ser protease (3CLSP) and papain-like Cys protease (PLP) motifs that are most likely involved in the processing of the viral replicase polyprotein. The finding of a 3C-like protease with a Ser catalytic nucleophile, and substrate binding residues that more closely resembled the arterivirus 3CLSP (Snijder et al., 1996) was surprising since toroviruses are classified as members of the family Coronaviridae. Although a PLP motif with similarity to the coronavirus PL2 pro domain was identified, sequence alignment and protein structure prediction analysis support the hypothesis that the BoTV PLP is more similar to the leader protease (L pro ) of the picornaviruses FMDV and ERAV. The coronavirus PL2 pro is the largest protease in this family of enzymes due to a unique zinc finger structure that connects the N-terminal alpha-helical domain to the C-terminal betasheet domain of the protease (Herold et al., 1999) In contrast, the N-and C-terminal domains of the picornavirus protease are joined by a short beta-strand structure (Guarne et al., 1998) , which may also be the case for the torovirus protease given the size similarity.\n\nConsistent with the nidovirus organization of domains within pp1a, several hydrophobic domains were located in the BoTV pp1a sequence. The conservation of these domains within the nidoviruses further emphasizes their significance. The hydrophobic domains in the arteriviruses have been shown to dramatically alter the host-cell membrane architecture in addition to mediating the association of the replication complex with cellular membranes (Pedersen et al., 1999; van der Meer et al., 1998) . A similar role can be conjectured in the toroviruses.\n\nWithin Nidovirales, the ADRP domain identified in pp1a has so far only been identified within viruses of the family Coronaviridae. This domain is within the same relative position in both the torovirus and coronavirus pp1a. This may suggest that an ancestor common to both toroviruses and coronaviruses acquired this domain after the other nidoviruses had split from this lineage, and before the torovirus-coronavirus split.\n\nThe presence of a region within the 3 end of the torovirus pp1a with sequence similarity to the coronavirus non-structural protein 2a has been interpreted as possible evidence for a nonhomologous recombination event, perhaps between an ancestral torovirus and a coronavirus during the co-infection of a cell (Snijder et al., 1991) . Replication of these sequence results in BoTV further supports this hypothesis.\n\nPreviously published phylogenetic analysis based on the RdRp and helicase domains of several members of the Nidovirales including one torovirus (EqTV) suggested a rather large evolutionary distance between EqTV and the coronaviruses (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2003) . Taking advantage of the BoTV sequence in this study, a new alignment of the RdRp protein sequences was done (data not shown) and the dendrogram obtained was highly similar to that obtained by Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2003) but showing the two toroviruses, EqTV and BoTV, clustering together. However, the exact boundaries of the RdRp domains were difficult to establish for many sequences used in the alignment. The availability of the first complete torovirus sequence enabled the establishment of CVTRees with representatives from of all genera within Nidovirales (Fig. 6 ). The topology of the trees shows that whereas the coronaviruses and the arteriviruses form distinct clusters, in both trees the BoTV-1 sequence stands apart from these clusters. Presently, Coronavirus and Torovirus are two genera within the family Coronaviridae. Viral taxonomy currently uses a polythetic approach which considers numerous properties simultaneously (Condit, 2001) . Based on their phylogenetic analysis, Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2003) proposed that the differences between coronaviruses and toroviruses are large enough that the two genera be elevated to subfamilies or even to families within Nidovirales. The data presented here support further taxonomic separation between the genera Coronavirus and Torovirus.\n\nThe completion of the genome sequence of BoTV-1 will contribute to our understanding of the toroviruses at the molecular level. This sequence, combined with the findings obtained from studies on EqTV, is expected to aid in the development of sensitive molecular diagnostic assays, such as RT-PCR targeting conserved regions of the torovirus genome. With the development of such tests, the less well-characterized toroviruses such as the human torovirus, as well any newly identified toroviruses will perhaps be more readily identified and better characterized."}
