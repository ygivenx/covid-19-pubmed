{"title": "Long-Term Stability Monitoring of Printed Proteins\non Paper-Based Membranes", "body": "Detection and sensing of viruses, pollutants,\nand other related\nproteins have received much attention with the Zika and MERS outbursts\nin recent years.1\u22125 To be considered a good detection and sensing platform, stability\nand detection sensitivity as well as ease of use and maintenance should\nbe guaranteed.6,7 There are several careful studies\nof paper-based sensing membranes that provide a cheap and convenient\noption for virus/pollutant detection.8\u221212 To date, a large number of novel paper-based sensing\ntechnologies, including nanoparticle-based and electronic-based sensors,\nhave been developed to increase detection sensitivity.13\u221216 However, many of these technologies require a significant amount\nof detection time, function only under certain storage conditions\nand are quite often expensive. As alternatives to these high technology\nsensing platforms, colorimetric and immunosensors are still popular\nin clinical use.17\u221219 These immunosensors are based on immobilized capturing\nantibodies, and virus particles/antigens captured on antibodies were\ndetected by detection antibodies.20,21 Colorimetric/immunosensing\nplatforms are widely used in various viruses, antigens, and pollutant\ndetection systems; however, most of the studies of these paper-based\nsensors focus on detection sensitivity and not stability or storage\nconditions.22\u221224 In addition, a large number of paper-based sensing\nmembrane systems have adopted chemically treated membranes to enhance\nprotein/antibody adsorption and stability,25\u221227 but comparative\nstudies of protein stability and detection sensitivity on different\npaper-based membranes are rare. To verify the stability of printed\nproteins on paper-based membranes and to fill the gaps in research,\nwe conducted systematic studies of protein stability and sensitivity\non three different paper-based membranes. We also conducted long-term\nmonitoring of printed proteins/antibodies on paper-based platforms\nwith varying storage temperature conditions to identify an optimal\nstoring period and temperature for printed proteins.\n\nFirst, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 \u03bcg/mL aliquots\nof the anti-IgG-HRP antibody were loaded on a Piezo printhead inkjet\nprinter and printed on printing paper and nitrocellulose and polyvinylidene\ndifluoride (PVDF) membranes (Figure 1A,B). Data suggest that IgG-HRP antibodies were successfully\nprinted on the paper-based membrane (Figure 1B). The printed IgG-HRP antibodies on paper-based\nmembranes were then incubated with the HRP substrate, and the HRP\nsignal intensity was recorded. Chemiluminescence intensities from\n100 \u03bcg/mL of the printed IgG-HRP antibody gave values of 4123\n\u00b1 1214, 4325 \u00b1 385, and 4936 \u00b1 325 (arbitrary unit)\nfor printing paper, nitrocellulose membrane, and PVDF membrane, respectively\n(Figure 1C).\n\nThree\ndifferent paper-based membranes printed with the IgG-HRP antibody\nwere stored at room temperature (r.t.), 4 \u00b0C or \u221220 \u00b0C\nfor 1\u2013180 days, and the HRP signal was monitored (Figure 2A). The data suggest\nthat the signal intensity from IgG-HRP printed on printing paper decreased\nby half on days 56.3 and 57.1 (from 0.8 cm diameter dot) under 4 and\n\u221220 \u00b0C storage conditions, respectively, while that at\nr.t. was 6.7 days (Figure 2B\u2013D). The chemiluminescence intensity of IgG-HRP printed\non both nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes decreased by half on day\n1.3 and day 2.5, respectively. Storage temperature does not induce\n>10% changes in the signal for nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes.\nNo chemiluminescence signals from the printed IgG-HRP antibody were\ndetected after 6 months of storage for printing paper or nitrocellulose\nand PVDF membranes.\n\nProstate-specific membrane antigen\n(PSMA) and tumor necrosis factor\nalpha (TNF-\u03b1) recombinant proteins were printed on printing\npaper and nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes (Figure 3A,B). After the designated storage period,\nPSMA/TNF-\u03b1 printed paper strips were incubated with antibodies-HRP,\nand HRP signals were monitored. The chemiluminescence signal intensity\nfrom anti-PSMA and anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibodies conjugated with HRP\nincreased as the concentration of printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 increased\n(Figure 3C,D). PSMA\nand TNF-\u03b1 printed on printing paper showed the highest signal\nintensity from antibody-HRP (2016 and 2786, respectively, from a 0.8\ncm diameter dot, arbitrary unit), followed by PVDF (1073 and 1932,\nrespectively) and nitrocellulose membrane (496 and 693, respectively).\n\nPrinted PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 were stored at r.t., 4, or \u221220\n\u00b0C for 28 days, and chemiluminescence signal intensities from\nantibody-HRP were monitored. Signal intensity from printed PSMA was\nreduced by half on days 3.3, 3.1, and 2.6 for \u221220, 4 \u00b0C,\nand r.t. storage, respectively, for printing paper (Figure 4A), while that of nitrocellulose\nwas 0.9 \u00b1 0.2 (Figure 4B). Times to reach half intensities compared to the original\nsignal for printed PSMA on the PVDF membrane were 4.1, 3.8, and 2.9\ndays for \u221220, 4 \u00b0C, and r.t. storage (Figure 4C). Signal intensity from printed\nTNF-\u03b1 was similar to printed PSMA, and the time to reach half\nintensities of the initial signal was the longest for the PVDF membrane\nfollowed by printing paper and nitrocellulose membrane (Figure 4D\u2013F). No signals were\ndetected.\n\nWe\nfirst tested whether inkjet-printed proteins on a paper-based\nmembrane are functional. We focused on maintenance of functional ability\nof printed HRP and structural integrity of printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1\nproteins. Varying concentrations of anti-IgG HRP antibodies (1\u2013100\n\u03bcg/mL) were printed on printing paper and nitrocellulose and\nPVDF membranes, and the HRP substrate was added to detect signals\nfrom the printed antibodies (Figure 1A). As low as 1 \u03bcg/mL of printed IgG-HRP antibodies\ncan be detected on paper-based membranes (Figure 1B,C), which suggests that piezo inkjet printing\ndoes not induce changes or damage to the function of printed antibodies.\nThe concentration of the anti-IgG-HRP antibody versus the chemiluminescence\nsignal intensity from the printed IgG-HRP plot showed a linear relationship,\nwith R-squared values of 0.952, 0.931, and 0.946\nfor printing paper, nitrocellulose membrane, and PVDF membrane, respectively\n(Figure 1C). These\ndata suggest that the signal intensity from printed IgG-HRP is a good\nreflection of the concentration of IgG-HRP. IgG-HRP-printed printing\npaper and nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes were stored at three different\ntemperature conditions: r.t. (\u223c22 \u00b0C), 4, and \u221220\n\u00b0C, to test the effect of storage temperature on printed protein\nfunctionality and stability. Chemiluminescence signal intensities\nfrom printed IgG-HRP antibodies on printing paper and nitrocellulose\nand PVDF membranes showed less than 10% variation, which suggests\nthat the binding capacity of the three paper-based membranes tested\nare quite similar. The HRP signal from printed IgG-HRP on printing\npaper decreased rapidly during the initial 5 days when stored at r.t.\nHowever, 4 and \u221220 \u00b0C significantly increased printed\nprotein stability, and the signal intensity from HRP remained >50%\nup to 60 days. Signals from printed HRP on printing paper can be detected\nup to 180 days when stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. These data suggest\nthat storing temperature is critical in maintaining printed protein\nfunctionalities. However, when the same protein was printed on the\nnitrocellulose membrane, the signal intensity from HRP dropped rapidly\nover the first 2 days, regardless of storage temperature (Figure 2C). Although protein\nmolecules bind to nitrocellulose membranes through hydrophobic interactions,\nprinted proteins on nitrocellulose membranes lose functionality in\na very short amount of time. IgG-HRP antibodies printed on PVDF also\nshowed significant signal intensity drops over the first 5 days; however,\nsignals from HRP can be detected up to 6 months when stored at 4 and\n\u221220 \u00b0C.\n\nWe next tested whether printed proteins\non paper-based membranes\ncan be detected by antibodies. Two recombinant proteins, PSMA and\nTNF-\u03b1, were printed and HRP conjugated antibodies against the\ntwo proteins were used to detect the printed proteins. Although signals\nfrom anti-PSMA-HRP and anti-TNF-\u03b1 HRP were lower compared to\nthe directly printed IgG-HRP antibody, printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1\nwere still detected when printed on all three paper-based membranes.\nSignal intensities from the detection antibody were highest on printing\npaper followed by PVDF and nitrocellulose membrane; however, they\ndid not show a linear relationship with the concentration of printed\nPSMA and TNF-\u03b1 (Figure 3C,D). These data may suggest that the signal intensities from\ncolorimetric/immunosensors may not exactly reflect the actual concentration\nof antigens. We again tested whether printed proteins can be detected\nby detection antibodies after storage at various storage temperatures.\nIt took \u223c3 days for signals to be reduced to half of the initial\nintensity from printed proteins on printing paper (Figure 3A,D). Storage temperatures\nhave a minimal effect on signal intensity in the first 3 days; however,\nstoring at \u221220 \u00b0C increases printed protein stability\nafter 7 days of storage.\n\nAlthough the signals from printed PSMA\nand TNF-\u03b1 on PVDF\nmembranes were lower than those from printing paper, signal intensity\nfrom printed proteins remains longer at 4 \u00b0C compared to that\nfrom printing paper (Figure 4C,F). Storing at 4 and \u221220 \u00b0C also increases printed\nprotein stability compared to r.t. Printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 antibodies\non the PVDF membrane and printing paper retains >50% activity for\n4.1 and 3.5 days, respectively, when stored lower than 4 \u00b0C.\nTwo antibodies on the PVDF membrane and printing paper retains >25%\nactivity for 14.2 and 5.8 days when stored at \u221220 \u00b0C.\nPSMA and TNF-\u03b1 printed on the nitrocellulose membrane showed\nsignificantly reduced signal intensities from detection antibodies\ncompared to printing paper and PVDF membranes (Figure 4B,E). Low-temperature storage increases the\nchemiluminescence signal upon storing; however, the signal only lasts\nup to 7 and 14 days for PSMA and TNF-\u03b1, respectively. These\ndata suggest that although nitrocellulose membranes are quite often\nused for various protein detection purposes, immobilized protein stability\nupon storing cannot be guaranteed compared to the PVDF membrane or\neven simple printing paper.\n\nHowever, our studies focus more\non protein stability and storage\ntemperature and not on detection sensitivity. Paper-based sensing\nplatforms adopting nanoparticles (plasmonic gold and quantum dot)\nand microelectronics have detection limits up to pictograms of proteins.28 Although this study adopted a simple colorimetric\ndetection method using HRP, we believe that nanoparticles and even\nelectronic or mechanistic sensing methods can be applied in a paper-based\nplatform.29\u221234 Overall, our data suggest that proteins and antibodies printed on\nsimple printing paper can be stable up to several months upon storage\nat low temperature. Our results can be further applied to developing\na simple and cost-effective antigen/virus/pollutant test based on\npaper membranes.\n\nOverall, our data also show that proteins printed\non simple printing\npaper retain functionality for a long duration of time compared to\nnitrocellulose or PVDF membranes when stored at low temperature.\n\nHybond-P PVDF and ECL nitrocellulose membranes\nwere purchased from GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL). The 75 g/m2 uncoated print paper (printing paper) was purchased from Hankuk\nPaper (Seoul, Republic of Korea). The antimouse IgG-HRP antibody was\npurchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The recombinant\nhuman PSMA protein was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK).

The piezo printhead printer (XP-310) was obtained from\nEpson (Suwa, Japan).\n\nFirst,\n1\u2013100 \u03bcg/mL IgG-HRP antibody diluted with molecular biology\ngrade water (Corning, Corning, NY) was loaded on the piezo printhead\nprinter and printed on printing paper or PVDF and nitrocellulose membranes.\nIgG-HRP printed paper-based platforms were then cut into 1.5 \u00d7\n10 cm strips. Finally, 1 mL of ECL western blotting detection reagents\nand the ImageQuant LAS 500 system (GE Healthcare) were used to record\nchemiluminescence intensity from printed IgG-HRP (intensity from 0.8\ncm diameter circular dot).\n\nIgG-HRP-printed\npaper-based platforms (PVDF, nitrocellulose, and printing paper) were\nstored at r.t. or 4 or \u221220 \u00b0C for the designated storage\nperiod.
