{"title": "Immunolabelling of Fish Host Molecules on the Tegumental Surface of Ligula Intestinalis (Cestoda: Ppseudophyllidea)", "body": "There have been several studies on the inflammatory response evoked in piscine hosts infected with pseudophyllidean tapeworms (Stromberg & Crites, 1974; Rosen & Dick, 1984; Otto & Heckmann, 1984; Sharp, Pike & Secombes, 1989) . Arme & Owen (1968; 1970) noted that in the majority of cyprinids the plerocercoid of Ligula intestinalis (L.) elicited an intense cellular immune response which, in roach, Rutilus rutilus (L.), comprised macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, vacuolated granulocytes and lymphocytes (Hoole & Arme, 1982; 1983a,b) . Whether or not ligulosis elicits a humoral immune response has not been clarified. Moln~ir & Berczi (1965) showed that the serum from ligulosed bream, *To whom all correspondence should be addressed.\n\nAbran& brama (L.), contained a precipitin against Ligula which was demonstrable using a double diffusion assay. In contrast, Sweeting (1977) , using the same technique, failed to demonstrate a worm-reactive precipitin in the serum of naturally ligulosed roach. However, in this latter study electrophoretic analysis did reveal an increase in the ~/-globulin fraction of ligulosed roach serum relative to that of serum from non-ligulosed fish, a result possibly indicative of an antibody response. Williams & Hoole (1992) speculated that the apparent absence of antibody noted by Sweeting (1977) may have been due to the duration of infection and/or environmental temperature. Although our previous studies, using sera from naturally ligulosed roach, corroborated the work of Sweeting (1977) we also showed that when fish received an intraperitoneal injection of crude worm homogenates and were maintained at a temperature of 20\u00b0C a precipitin band could be obtained using the double diffusion technique.\n\nIn mammalian-helminth symbioses both antibody and complement can act as mediators in the immune interactions between leucocytes, humoral factors and helminths (Butterworth, 1984; Wakelin, 1986) . The role of serum components in the fish host response to ligulosis has been investigated by Hoole & Arme (1986) using an in vitro cell adherence assay in which worms were exposed to fish leucocytes in the presence of various serum components. Both antibody and a complement protein, probably C3, were implicated as ligands in the mediation of cell attachment. In addition, the results of similar assays carried out by Hoole & Arme (1988) , in which sera was treated with phosphorylcholine (PC), suggested that the acute-phase protein, C-reactive protein (CRP), possibly in association with complement, may also be involved in leucocyte adherence to the metacestode.\n\nStudies on other fish-helminth symbioses have also implicated antibody ligands in the mediation of cellular attack. For example, Bortz, Kenny, Pauley, Garcia-Ortigoza & Anderson (1984) have reported antibodies in the sera of trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, infected with the eye fluke Diplostomum spathaceum, whilst investigations by Whyte, Chappel & Secombes (1989) have suggested an antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity mechanism in the immune response of this fish species to diplostomula of D.\n\nspathaceum. Of particular interest are the in vitro investigations by Sharp et aL (1989) in which wormspecific antibodies were demonstrated on the surface of isolated plerocercoids of Diphyllobothrium dendriticum and D. ditremum exposed to immune serum. However, antibodies were not detected on the surface of worms in situ using immunofluorescence on cryostat sections of intact cysts.\n\nRecent investigations on the roach-Ligula model by Williams & Hoole (1992) revealed that intraperitoneal injections of worm homogenates elicited an increase in the percentage number of antibodyproducing cells in the pronephros and spleen of experimental fish. The fate of secreted antibodies was unknown but in natural infections a role in opsonization of the parasite, either to mediate cellular attachment or to initiate complement activation, has been proposed (Hoole & Arme, 1986) . Clearly, the direct demonstration of host antibody on the surface of uncultured Ligula would be of value in elucidating the role of the humoral immune response to this parasite.\n\nInitial experiments have been carried out to establish whether a polyclonal anti-carp IgM antibody could react with roach antibody. Once this had been established the polyclonal antibody was then used in immunofluorescence and immunogold labelling assays to localize putative fish antibodies on the surface of Ligula intestinalis.\n\nSera. Six non-ligulosed roach from Highfield Pool, Nottinghamshire, U.K. (mean fork length 14.6 -+ 0.1 cm) were maintained at 12\u00b0C +_ l\u00b0C in dechlorinated, aerated tapwater. After anaesthetising in MS222 each fish received a 0.2 ml intraperitoneal (IP) injection of Ligula tegumental homogenates (protein concentration 0.3 mg/ml) in Freunds Complete Adjuvant (FCA) (1:1) on day 0 and again on day 14. Tegumental homogenates were obtained by freezethawing of whole worms, washing in 0.85% saline and removing the supernatant. Fish were bled, under anaesthetic, by caudal puncture one week after the second injection, i.e., day 21 post-primary injection, and blood allowed to clot for 1.5 h at 4\u00b0C, after which the serum (immune roach serum; IRS) was removed, pooled and frozen at --20\u00b0C until required. Pooled normal roach serum (NRS) was obtained from 6 non-ligulosed fish, mean fork length 13.2 _+ 0.1 cm. Immune carp serum (ICS) was obtained from carp, Cyprinus carpio, fork length 10-15 cm, infected with the tapeworm Bothriocephalus achielognathi. Anti-carp IgM polyclonal antibody (ct-clgM), raised in Dutch white rabbits, was kindly supplied by Drs M. Cross and R.M. Matthews of Plymouth University, U.K. Peroxidaselabelled goat anti-rabbit IgG (peroxidase c(-rIgG) was obtained from Sigma Chem. Co.\n\nImmunoblotting. In each assay antibodies were diluted in blocking solution (PBS, 1% dried milk powder, 0.01% Tween 20). Five rows, each comprising 4 spots of 5 ~tl reagent, were immobilized on to 4 sheets of nitrocellulose blotting paper (Sartorius). The first row, comprising IRS, was spotted in dilutions of l:l, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8. Similar dilutions of sera were used in the controls, i.e. a negative control of normal roach serum in row 2 and a positive control of ICS in row 3. Row 4 contained spots of blocking solution whilst the fifth row, which served as a positive colour control, comprised ct-clgM polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:200. After incubating at room temperature (approximately 20\u00b0C) the nitrocellulose papers were immersed for 30 min in blocking solution and washed 3 x 5 rain in PBS, 0.01% Tween 20. Primary antibody ((x-cIgM) was added at dilutions of either 1:50, 1:100, 1:200 or 1:400, each dilution being placed on to one of 4 sheets. The primary antibody was then left to incubate overnight at room temperature. After removal of the primary antibody and washing, the nitrocellulose papers were incubated in a 1:1000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated a-rIgG for 15-30 mins. After washing, the sheets were developed for 10 min in a solution of 0.6mg/ml chloronapthol/0.05% hydrogen peroxide in PBS, and then rinsed in distilled water.\n\nWestern blotting. NRS and IRS were diluated 1:4 in sample buffer (0.2 M-Tris base, 1.0 M-sucrose, 5% mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Bromophenol blue, pH 8.8) and 10 p.l of each solution placed into a well in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel.\n\nTen p.l of molecular mass markers comprising 180, 116, 84, 50 and 48 kDa protein subunits (Sigma) were used as comparisons. Electrophoresis was carried out using an LKB \"Mighty Small\" PAGE electrophoresis unit connected to an LKB Bromma 2197 40 mA power supply. Following separation proteins were electrophorectically transferred from the gels on to nitrocellulose blotting paper using a TE70 Semi-dry transfer unit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments) run at 80 mA. Nitrocellulose papers were temporarily stained with 0.2% Ponceau Red for 5 min to check that all bands had been transferred. The papers were then destained in distilled water and the proteins probed with a 1:200 dilution of rabbit a-clgM. Following this a 1:1000 dilution of peroxidase conjugated goat a-rlgG was added for 15-30 min. Final visualization was carried out as described above.\n\nImmunofluorescence labelling. Ligulosed roach fry, mean weight 0.65 +-0.01 g, were obtained from Tittesworth Reservoir, Staffordshire, U.K. Fish were maintained in dechlorinated, aerated tapwater at 12 _+ I\u00b0C and fed on commercial fish meal. Worms were removed under teleost Ringer (Lockwood, 1963) using parafilm-covered forceps and washed 3 x in fresh Ringer solution to remove any adherent host cells. The worms were then cut into approximately 3 mm pieces and each section prefixed in 2% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS (pH 7.4) for 4-6 h. After prefixing, worms were washed first in teleost Ringer and then PBS-I%BSA. After blocking in 3% BSA in PBS for 2 h, the tissue was again washed in PBS-I%BSA, and immersed for 2 h in primary antibody (a-clgM) in PBS at dilutions of 1:20, 1:50 and 1:100. Worm material was then washed and blocked as above and then incubated for 2 h in the secondary antibody, FITC conjugated c~-rlgG, at a dilution of either 1:10, 1:20, 1:40 or 1:80 in PBS. After washing, specimens were viewed using a Reichert Zetopan microscope with a twin lamp Binolux II source, set up for epifluorescence. Photographs were taken using Kodak EKTAR 1000/31 \u00b0 film. In addition to the above, four controls were prepared: (a) to check for autofluorescence, worms were incubated in PBS-3%BSA, in the absence of antibodies; (b) to check for non-specific binding of the secondary antibody (FITC a-rlgG) the a-clgM stage was omitted, (c) to check for non-specific binding of components other than antibody in the immune rabbit serum, normal rabbit serum was included at a dilution of 1:50, before applying the secondary antibody; (d) IRS was included before the application of the secondary antibody. This addition would check for and eliminate unbound a-IgM in the assay.\n\nImmunogold labelling. Worm material, washed and blocked as described above, was incubated for 2 h in primary antibody (polyclonal c~-clgM) in 0.5 MNaC1, 0.1%BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% Foetal Bovine Serum at a dilution of either l:10, 1:20, 1:50 or 1:100. After washing, the material was immersed for 2 h in the secondary antibody, goat anti-rabit IgG-gold conjugate (ee-rIgG gold), 10 nm particle size (Sigma) in 0.05 MNaC1, 0.01%BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% Foetal Bovine Serum at dilutions of 1:10, 1:20, 1:40 or 1:80, and postfixed overnight in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M-sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) 251 containing 2 mM-CaC1. The material was washed for 4 h in 0.1 M-sodium cacodylate, 2 mM-CaC1 and finally postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer for 2 h. After dehydration in a graded series of acetone (30, 60, 90, 100%) parasite material was embedded in Spurr's resin. Ultra-thin sections were viewed unstained using a Jeol 100 CX II electron microscope at 80 kV. Control preparations were as for immunofluorescence with the exception of the check for autofluorescence.\n\nThe results of the immunoblotting procedure are shown in Fig. 1 . Row 3 (ICS) clearly shows binding of the a-cIgM antibody to whole immune carp serum at all dilutions. IRS (Row 1) also bound the a-cIgM antibody with slightly less colour being developed in the neat, 1:2 and 1:4 dilutions than in the corresponding dilutions of ICS. At a dilution of 1:8 the amount of antibody binding appeared similar in both IRS and ICS. NRS (Row 2) also showed some reactivity with the c~-cIgM antibody. This was expected since it is highly probable that NRS would contain unknown titres of antibody. However, the reaction product was less intense with NRS than with either of the immune sera suggesting that the antibodies in NRS may be present at lower levels.\n\nThe original polyacrylamide gel, after electrophoresis of proteins, is shown in Fig. 2 . Many of the protein bands, particularly 100, 90 and 65 kDa (Fig. 2 arrows) appeared more dense in IRS than those in NRS, perhaps suggesting that immunization results in increased levels of these serum proteins. western blotting (Fig. 3) revealed binding of the et-cIgM antibody to be specific for two major bands, corresponding to 90 and 65 kDa, in both NRS and IRS.\n\nDilutions of 1:50 a-clgM and 1:20 FITC-conjugated a-rlgG were found to give optimal binding. Labelling worm sections with FITC-labelled antibodies resulted in fluorescence, probably due to a greater depth of field, being observed at the periphery of the worm (Fig. 4) . Although not clearly visible on Fig. 4 , the surface of the worm also displayed faint fluorescence. Fluorescence was not observed in any of the control experiments with the exception of (d), where IRS was added to sequester any unbound a-clgM. In this control the level of fluorescence was indistinguishable from experimental specimens. \n\nDilutions of 1:50 polyclonal ct-clgM and 1:40 gold conjugate antibodies were found to produce optimal binding. Gold labelling of the apical plasma membrane/glycocalyx was relatively sparse with particles observed attached to the microtriches particularly associated with the microthrix spines ( observed attached to the membrane/glycocalyx of the proximal microthrix border. As with the fluorescence experiments the only control to display gold labelling was (d), which incorporated IRS to sequester c~-cIgM not bound to the parasite surface.\n\nThe tegumental surface of helminths has been the subject of much research (e.g. Oaks & Lumsden, 1971; Befus, 1977; Friedman, Weinstein, Davidson & Mueller, 1982; Schmidt & Peters, 1987; Lightowlers & Rickard, 1988) . Fig. 5 . Immunogold labelling of fish host molecules on the apical plasma membrane of L. intestinalis using gold-labelled u-rlgG and ct-cIgM antisera. Gold particles were mainly observed bound to the distal microthrix border (arrows) and associated with the microthrix spines (inset) Scale bars = l~tm (main plate) and 0.2 lain (inset).\n\nThe surface of the plerocercoid of Ligula intestinalis, as revealed by the electron microscope, resembles that of other cestodes and is assumed to be polyionic (Hoole & Arme, 1985) . The microthrix border is, however, unusually thick and can extend to a depth of 20 ~tm, with each microthrix being composed of a relatively short shaft and long, flexible spine. The presumed polyionic nature of the surface would suggest that host proteins, including antibody and complement molecules, may be adsorbed on to the surface membrane of worms in situ (Hoole & Arme, 1985) .\n\nExperiments utilizing SDS-PAGE and western blotting procedures have demonstrated that a polyclonal antibody raised against carp immunoglobulin (Ig) cross-reacts with components in xenogenic roach serum. Two bands, corresponding to molecular masses of approximately 90 and 65 kDa, were specifically recognized by the polyclonal. These bands fall within the range of the molecular masses of the heavy chain component of antibodies from other cyprinids, i.e. goldfish, carp and tench, reported by Vilain & Wetzel (1984) . In this latter study Ig light chains had weights of approximately 25 kDa that remained relatively consistent between species.\n\nSince the molecular masses of the bands observed in our experients is well in excess of that observed for the light chains of Ig found in other fish species, it is suggested that one of these bands, probably the 65 kDa band, represents the heavy chain of roach Ig. The nature of the second band remains unknown but its molecular mass is reasonably consistent with that found for the lighter subunits of some components of the complement system. For example, rainbow trout C3 is composed of two polypeptide chains of molecular masses 128 and 74 kDa (Nonaka, Iwaki, Nakai, Nozaki, Kaidoh, Nonaka, Natsuume-Sakai & Takahashi, 1984) .whilst rainbow trout C5 subunits have molecular masses of 133 kDa and 86 kDa (Nonaka, Natsuume-Sakai & Takahashi, 1981) .\n\nImmunolabelling of the tegument of L. intestinalis has demonstrated a distribution of host molecules to be associated mainly with the microthrix spines, with less binding being observed proximally. Whether one or both of the serum components shown to be specifically bound by the anti-carp polyclonal are being labelled on the worm surface cannot be known from our experiments. However, the distal distribution of host molecules presumably reflects a differential distribution of parasite antigens. Such a localized distribution of parasite antigens has also been reported by other workers. Befus (1977) used an immunofluorescence technique to demonstrate host antibodies on the surfaces of H. diminuta and H. microstoma from mice. The distribution of fluorescence on the surface of these worms was different according to the antisera used. IgA was shown to be located linearly at the worm vela whereas the C3 complement component displayed a granular fluorescence. In addition, Schmidt & Peters (1987) , using gold-labelled lectins, visualized glycoconjugates on the microthrix spines of the tegumental surfaces of H. diminuta and H. microstorna. Less binding was observed over the proximal parts of the microtriches.\n\nThe precise nature of the parasite antigens being recognized is not known. However, phosphorylcholine (PC), although never having been directly demonstrated to be a component of the Ligula tegumental membrane is a ubiquitous molecule that has been found to be a component of other helminths (Prry, Petit, Poulain & Luffau, 1974; Gutman & Mitchell, 1977; Fletcher, White & Baldo, 1980) . Indirect evidence for a PC component of the Ligula membrane comes from the cell adherence assays, using PC-treated sera, of Hoole & Arme (1988) . These experiments implicated a possible role for CRP in mediating the cellular attack of roach to the parasite. In addition, Hoole & Arme did not discount the possibility that anti-PC antibodies were involved.\n\nAlternatively the parasite molecules may be ES products of metabolism. Lightowlers & Rickard (1988) reviewed the role of ES products of helminths on the host immune system. Worm ES products may evoke an effective immune response or, alternatively, they may provide the parasite with a means by which immune evasion can be secured (Lightowlers & Rickard, 1988) . A dramatic example of the latter is the excretion of a polysaccharide by Taenia taniaeformis that is able to consume complement at some distance away from the parasite surface (Hammerberg & Williams, 1978) .\n\nSuch sequestration of immune components has also been suggested for a fish cestode by the investigations of Sharp et aZ (1989) . Utilizing an in vitro immunofluorescence technique they demonstrated the presence of specific antibodies on the tegument of two species of Diphyllobothrium from trout when the worms were incubated in pooled immune serum. However, in situ experiments using cryostat sections through intact cysts did not reveal the presence of fish antibodies associated with the worm tegumental surface. Of particular interest were the high levels of fish antibody demonstrated on the inner margins of cysts. Since this site was shown to be composed of detached microtriches in fibrous tissue it was suggested that the passive absorption of antibody in this area may aid in parasite survival. In the roach-Ligula model a layer of host cellular remnants and parasite microthrix fragments has been observed adjacent to worms obtained from roach fry (Hoole & Arme, 1983a) . If a similar mechanism of host antibody absorption, as that suggested for Diphyllobthrium spp. (see Sharp et al., 1989) occurs in the roach-Ligula model, this may account for the paucity of host molecules demonstrated on the tegumental surface of L. intestinalis.\n\nIt is a characteristic of ligulosis that, regardless of the extensive cellular onslaught seen in the majority of fish hosts, the worm can survive the life of its host. Indeed, in the gudgeon, Gobio gobio, not only does Ligula survive the duration of the life of its host but, by a mechanism not yet understood, the worm also avoids eliciting a host cellular immune response (Taylor & Hoole, 1989) . In roach, in vivo tegumental damage to Ligula is restricted to phagocytosis of the microtriches by macrophages (Hoole & Arme, 1982) with extensive damage to the parasite being limited possibly due to the physical inability of the fish leucocytes to penetrate the dense microthrix border. Alternatively, serum components, such as antibody or complement, which are capable of opsonization of the worm tegument, may bind to antigens which are themselves restricted in their distribution on the tegumental surface, as would be suggested from the results described in the present paper.\n\nIn conclusion, the localization of host molecules over the distal microthrix of L. intestinalis suggests a localization of antigens similar to that observed in other cestodes. In addition, the paucity of immune labelling may be the result of a sequestration zone around the parasite, a hypothesis that requires further investigation. The distribution of host molecules that could possibly act as ligands is consistant with the findings of Hoole & Arme (1982; 1983a,b) who infrequently observed leucocyte penetration of the microthrix border. They suggested that the lack of cellular penetration was a physical phenomenon. Based on our observations it is proposed that the distal localization of the cellular response may be a result, at least in part, of the restricted distribution of host ligands and their corresponding parasite immunogens."}
