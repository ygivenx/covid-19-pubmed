{"title": "Protocol for a randomized controlled trial testing inhaled nitric oxide therapy in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19", "body": "The novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) has been first identified in China in December 2019 [1] . As of today, more than 110,000 cases have been reported (with more than 4,000 deaths) and, while the majority of them is still concentrated in China, the infection has spread across the country's border to many Asian countries, as well as to Europe and to the USA [2]. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. The current outbreak would result from the acquired ability of the virus to undergo human to human transmission [3] , after the jump from the original animal reservoir (most likely a bat).\n\nIn the human host, SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory syndrome (named which can range from a mild involvement of the upper airways to a severe pneumonia with Acute Respiratory Syndrome (ARS) and the need of mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). In early case series, the risk of critical care admission ranges between 5 and 26%, with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities or chronic diseases [4, 5] . The time from symptoms onset to development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long, with a median time of 8 days in which the patient remains in a state of mild disease characterized by dry cough, fever and mild hypoxia requiring oxygen supplementation. Once severe disease with the necessity of ICU develops, the outcome worsens decisively, with mortality raising from 3.4% to 61% [4, 6] . Moreover, ICU staying poses a serious strain on resource-limited hospitals. Thus, preventing disease progression during the mild phase would be highly desirable both in terms of morbidity and mortality improvement and healthcare resource-sparing. At the present time, there are no proven etiological treatments for COVID-19 but some ongoing clinical trials are testing the effects of anti-viral drugs (NCT04252664 on ClinicalTrials.gov).\n\nIn 2004, a pilot study showed that low dose inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support during the SARS epidemic, sustained by another coronavirus, SARS-CoV [7] . In an in vitro study, the NO donor compound S-nitroso-Nacteylpenicillamine increased the survival rate in an in vitro model of SARS-CoV .

While further in-vitro testing for this specific virus is recommended, we propose a randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of inhaled NO in preventing progression of COVID-19 disease, when administered at an early stage.\n\nMulticenter randomized clinical trial. Symptoms of COVID-19 must include presence of fever of at least 36.6 \u00b0C from the axillary site or 37.2 \u00b0C from the oral site or 37.6 \u00b0C from the rectal / tympanic site.\n\nIn addition, patient must be spontaneously breathing with a respiratory rate of at least 24 breaths per minute and/or an objective persistent cough consistent with COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n.

Gas exchange and ventilation may be assisted by means of any continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) system, or any system of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) \u2264 10 cmH2O.\n\nCriteria of exclusion are pregnancy (all women in fertile age should be tested for pregnancy before being enrolled); presence of an open tracheostomy; therapy with high-flow nasal cannula; clinical contraindication to NO gas delivery, as judged by the attending physician; hospitalized and confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 for more than 72 hours.

A flowchart of the study is presented in Figure 2 .\n\nThe evaluation of the patients will continue for 28 day after the enrollment.\n\nSince treatment with inhaled NO can lead to increase in plasmatic methemoglobin, the blood levels of methemoglobin will be monitored via non-invasive CO-oximeter or methemoglobin levels in blood. If methemoglobin levels rise above 5% at any point of the study, inhaled NO concentration will be immediately stopped until the subsequent dose. For safety reason we will also evaluate NO2 level in order to keep it below 5 ppm.\n\nIf we observe an increase above this value, we will immediately interrupt the administration of NO until the subsequent dose.\n\nPatients assigned to the control group will not receive any gas therapy.\n\nThe primary outcome will be the proportion of patients who progress to a severe form of the disease, defined as the indication given by the attending physician to intubation and mechanical ventilation in the first 28 days after enrollment in the study. Patients in severe respiratory failure and/or ventilatory distress with indication to intubation but concomitant DNI (Do Not Intubate) will meet criteria for primary endpoint. The proportion of intubation will be calculated at 28 days from study enrollment. .

Collection of study variables will be managed by the outcome assessors by using a dedicated patient's file on Studytrax. The 28 days follow up, if the patient is discharged from the hospital, will be performed by a phone call.\n\nOutcome assessors, treatment providers and the principal investigator will obtain unique usernames and password to transfer all data to a Studytrax page dedicated to the study. Data access is restricted only to authorized member of the team which will be responsible for strict confidentiality all times. The signed informed consent will be kept in a secure place for at least 5 years after study completion.\n\nBased on previously published data on COVID 19 [4] , we predict an incidence of intubation and mechanical ventilation of 12.3%. However, because of the novel nature of this study, we do not have enough data to predict the effect of inhaled NO on the primary outcome. The dynamic trend of this ongoing outbreak also prevents us to determine the rate of enrollment that we can achieve. As such, in Table 2 we are displaying the sample size calculation for our primary outcome, for an alpha level of 0.05 and a power level of 0.8, under different scenario. We will perform a first analysis based on 240 patients, evaluating the actual incidence of the primary outcome, effect of the treatment and the actual rate of enrollment. The PI will decide, together with the DSMB, whether to continue enrollment to 340 patients, if a sufficient rate of enrollment and power had not been achieved with the original sample size. Based on results reported in Table 2 , the same step could then be repeated increasing sample size from 340 to 500 patients, from 500 patients to 760 and from 760 patients to 1260.\n\n.

Demographic and clinical data will be presented as proportions for categorical outcomes and mean plus standard deviation or median plus interquartile range for continuous outcomes.\n\nComparison between groups will be made with the X 2 test or the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and with the t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. For the t-test the normality distribution will be evaluated.\n\nTime to event outcomes will be analyzed by estimating survival curves over treated and non-treated using the Kaplan-Meier method.\n\nA subgroup analysis will be performed with multiple linear regression, as well as logistic and cox regression models to adjust for age, pulmonary comorbidities and coadministration of other experimental treatment.\n\nData monitoring Data will be monitored by the principal investigator (PI) in collaboration with an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). PI, and DSMB will monitor adverse events and quality of the data and provide recommendations. The PI will monitor compliance to safety rules every 20 patients. Every violation will be reported to the DSMB. Peripheral centers will be provided with a data sheet providing safety rules and will be instructed to report every violation to the coordinating hospital. Before the beginning of the study, the DSMB will meet to decide safety rules and stopping guidelines.\n\nWe will not perform any interim analysis, but the DSMB will be granted the authority to stop the trial at any point due to safety concerns.\n\nThe aim of this trial is to evaluate whether high dose of NO administered at an early stage can safely reduce or prevent the progression of COVID-19 disease.
