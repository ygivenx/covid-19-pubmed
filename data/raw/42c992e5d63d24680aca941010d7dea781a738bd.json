{"title": "", "body": "Typically there is little fl uid present in the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial cavities, and thus they are considered potential spaces. Detailed physiologic descriptions of serous body cavity homeostasis are available (Bouvy et al., 1991; Forrester, 1988; Kirby, 2003) . These serous body cavities are lined by specialized cells, termed mesothelial cells. Clinical signs of the presence of increased amounts of fl uid include abdominal distension, abdominal pain, dyspnea, muffl ed heart sounds, and cardiac arrhythmia. Collection and evaluation of fl uid from these sites may be therapeutic as well as diagnostic for the presence of infl ammatory, hemorrhagic, neoplastic, lymphatic, or bilious conditions. Additionally, further diagnostic tests may be indicated by the cytologic characteristics. Removal and examination of fl uid is highly recommended unless anesthetic risks or bleeding diathesis are present or further injury is likely.\n\nPlace the patient in left lateral recumbency and restrain. Clip and surgically prepare an area (e.g., 4 to 6 inches square) with the umbilicus in the center. The urinary bladder should be emptied before performing paracentesis. Infi ltrate a small area with local anesthetic, if desired. Use a 20-to 22-gauge needle or over-the-needle catheter to penetrate the abdomen. Attempt to obtain fl uid in four quadrants, allowing the fl uid to fl ow freely by gravity and capillary action. If needed, gentle suction with a 3-or 6-ml syringe can be employed. For a complete description of the technique, the reader is referred elsewhere (Ford and Mazzaferro, 2006) . Allow the animal to rest quietly while fl uid is being removed. Moving the animal or allowing the patient to move while the needle is in the abdomen can result in laceration of the organs. Some investigators prefer to have the patient standing for fl uid removal; however, it is more likely that the omentum will occlude the needle if the patient is in a standing position.\n\nFor removal of fl uid from the thorax, the patient should be in a standing or in ventral /sternal recumbency. Clip the hair and surgically prepare the thoracic wall from the 5th to the 11th intercostal space. Infi ltrate a small area at the 7th to 8th intercostal space at the level of the costochondral junction with local anesthetic. It is best to attach extension tubing to the hub of the needle or over-the-needle catheter and a three-way stopcock for removal of pleural fl uid. Insert the needle or catheter into the chest wall at the surgically prepared site taking care to avoid the intercostal vessels located just caudal to each rib. For a complete description of this technique, the reader is referred elsewhere (Ford and Mazzaferro, 2006) .\n\nFor removal of fl uid from the pericardial sac, sedate the patient if necessary. Surgically prepare an area over the lower to mid 5th to 7th intercostal space bilaterally. Place the patient in lateral or sternal recumbency. Attach ECG leads to monitor for dysrhythmias during the procedure. Infi ltrate an area at the costochondral junction, or approximately where the lower and mid thorax meet, with local anesthetic. Use an over-the-needle catheter or Intrafusor system with a three-way valve to which a 30-ml syringe is attached. Always maintain negative pressure on the syringe as the chest wall is punctured. Carefully advance the needle into the 4th intercostal space through a nick incision in the direction of the heart. Advance the needle until resistance is met (from the pericardium). A release will be felt as the needle enters the pericardial sac and a fl ash of blood is often seen. Thread the tubing or catheter so that it is securely within the pericardial sac. For a complete description of this technique, the reader is referred elsewhere (Ford and Mazzaferro, 2006) .\n\nAlan H. Rebar and Craig A. Thompson\n\nNote the color and character of the fl uid initially upon removal ( Fig. 6-1 ). If the fl uid is clear initially then turns red, iatrogenic blood contamination is likely. The fl uid should be collected into both a lavender-top tube (EDTA anticoagulant) for cytology and a red-top tube (or any sterile tube without additives) for potential bacterial culture. Also at collection, make both direct unconcentrated smears by a squash or blood smear technique and smears from spun samples. Romanowsky-type stains such as Wright stain or an aqueous-based Wright (quick) stain can be applied to a few slides for immediate inhouse evaluation. The remaining unstained smears, as well as an EDTA and serum tube fi lled with fl uid, should be submitted to the laboratory. This will allow the clinical pathologist evaluating the sample to compare the cellularity of the sample and the appearance of the cells at the time of collection with that which was submitted in the tube.\n\nProtein quantitation is typically done via refractometry; however, some institutions will determine protein via spectrophotometry or automated analysis. Both methods offer accurate readings in a wide range of protein concentrations (George, 2001; George and O'Neill, 2001) . It has been shown with canine effusions that refractometry underestimates the protein content when \u03fd 2.0 g/dl and that the spectrophotometry using the biuret method is more accurate when there is high protein content (Braun et al., 2001) . Others have found that refractometry can be used accurately down to 1.0 g/dl (George and O'Neill, 2001) . A similar fi nding of underestimating protein content in feline effusions with refractometry may occur (Papasouliotis et al., 2002) . In that same study, a dry chemistry analyzer produced increased globulin concentration and therefore lower Albumin:Globulin (A:G) ratios when compared with a reference wet analyzer using the same biuret and bromocresol green methodologies (Papasouliotis et al., 2002) . This fi nding is particularly important since decreased A:G ratios support a diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (Hartmann et al., 2003) .\n\nFor cloudy or turbid samples and bloody samples, the fl uid should be centrifuged and the protein measured on the supernatant. Turbidity may interfere with evaluation of protein by either refractometry or spectrophotometry. The protein content is used with the nucleated cell count to classify the effusion and help formulate a list of possible causes.\n\nAlthough an initial impression of the cellularity and amount of blood can usually be made by visual inspection of the sample (see Fig. 6 -1), knowledge of the actual cell counts for erythrocytes and nucleated cells is important for further classifi cation of the type of fl uid. With this information, one can begin to narrow down the list of possible causes for the abnormal fl uid accumulation. For samples being submitted to a reference laboratory, placing some of the sample in a lavender-top tube (EDTA) and some in a red-top tube is recommended. The lavender-top tube contains anticoagulant, which prevents the sample from clotting if there is a high protein content. EDTA is bactericidal, however, and is contraindicated if a sample is to be cultured (Songer and Post, 2005) . Thus, some of the fl uid should also be put into a red-top tube or sterile tube without additives. The cell counts will be done either with a hemocytometer or an automated cell-counting instrument. If the amount of fi brinogen in the fl uid sample is high, then the sample in the red-top tube is likely to clot, producing erroneous results.\n\nNote: Do not use gel-containing serum separator tubes (SST) for submission of fl uid to a reference laboratory. Cells may bind to the gel in these tubes and result in an artifactually lowered cell count.\n\nStandard procedures for performing a differential of the nucleated cells vary among laboratories. Some laboratories do no differential, others a three-part differential of 100 cells (large mononuclear cells, small mononuclear cells, and neutrophils), while others will provide a 100-cell differential of all cell types observed. The differential provides a relative picture of the types and numbers of cells and aids in establishing a list of potential causes for the fl uid accumulation. A differential is not a substitute for a cytologic evaluation. The cytologic evaluation is performed in an attempt to determine a specifi c diagnosis. (g) brown and slightly turbid-possible bile or red blood cell breakdown.\n\nNormally, only a very small amount of fl uid is found in the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial spaces; thus cytologic evaluation is generally not typically performed unless an increased amount of fl uid accumulates. Normal fl uid is clear and colorless (see Fig. 6 -1). Several types of cells may be found in body cavity effusions and their relative proportions vary depending on the cause of the fl uid accumulation. Cells expected to be in normal fl uid include mesothelial, mononuclear phagocytes, lymphocytes, and rare neutrophils. Mesothelium will easily become hyperplastic or reactive when increased body cavity fl uid or infl ammation is present.\n\nIn most cases, the cytologist will fi nd reactive mesothelial cells in body cavity fl uids. These are considered as large mononuclear cells for the purpose of the three-part cell differential. Mesothelial cells may be seen as individualized cells or in variably sized clusters. They contain a moderate amount of medium-blue cytoplasm ( Fig. 6 -2). Hyperplastic mesothelial cells are large (12 to 30 \u03bcm) with deep-blue cytoplasm and may display a pink to red \"fringed\" cytoplasmic border ( Fig. 6-3A&B ). This feature helps identify these cells as mesothelial cells. These cells may contain one or more nuclei of equal size (see Fig. 6 -3B). Nucleoli may be visible and occasional mitotic fi gures may be evident.\n\nMacrophages are large mononuclear cells with abundant pale-gray to light-blue cytoplasm and a round to kidney bean-shaped nucleus (Figs. 6-3A and 6-4). The chromatin may be fi ne and nucleoli may be visible. Macrophages often contain vacuoles or previously phagocytosed cells and/or debris if there is infl ammation or if the fl uid has been present for a long time ( Fig. 6-5 ). Macrophages are considered as large mononuclear cells for the purpose of the three-part cell differential.\n\nSmall and medium lymphocytes found in effusions appear similar to those found in peripheral blood. These nucleated cells often have a thin rim of lightly basophilic cytoplasm and a round nucleus. Lymphocytes are considered as small, mononuclear cells for the purpose of the three-part cell differential. In normal fl uids they are present in higher proportions in cats and cattle than in dogs and horses. The nucleus nearly fi lls the cell, producing a uniformly high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio. The chromatin is fi nely stippled to evenly clumped; nucleoli are not visible ( Fig. 6-6A&B ). \n\nNeutrophils appear similar to those found in peripheral blood. They are medium-sized cells with pale to clear cytoplasm and a segmented nucleus. Neutrophils should be absent or present in very low numbers in normal fl uid but they will be found in increased numbers with chronic fl uid accumulation or with infl ammation (see Figs. 6-5 and 6-6B).\n\nEffusions are usually classifi ed as transudates, modifi ed transudates, and exudates, related to the protein concentration, nucleated cell count, and cell types present (Table 6 -1).\n\nFluids are classifi ed as transudates when they have a low protein content and a low cell count (protein \u03fd 2.5 g/dl and cells \u03fd 1000/\u03bcl). These fl uids increase in volume in response to physiologic mechanisms, such as increased hydrostatic vascular pressure or decreased colloidal osmotic pressure, that cause the normal homeostatic mechanisms of fl uid production and resorption to be overwhelmed. Some causes for transudate accumulation include severe hypoalbuminemia, portal hypertension, hepatic insuffi ciency, portosystemic shunt, and early myocardial insuffi ciency. The cells commonly found in transudates are similar to those in normal fl uid, which are mostly mononuclear cells consisting of macrophages, small lymphocytes, and mesothelial cells (see Fig. 6 -6A). Neutrophils may compose a small proportion of the population. Note a large macrophage, many small lymphocytes, and nondegenerate neutrophils. This fl uid had a protein of 2.5g/dl and an increased nucleated cell count of 4000 cells/\u03bcl. The macrophage has phagocytized a red blood cell. (Romanowsky; HP oil.)\n\nA fl uid is classifi ed as a modifi ed transudate when a transudate changes its physical features. The accumulation of transudative fl uid in a body cavity causes increased pressure, which is irritating to the mesothelial cells lining the space. They respond by proliferating and sloughing into the effusion. With time, the sloughed mesothelial cells die and in so doing release chemoattractants that draw small numbers of phagocytes into the effusion to remove cellular debris. The result is a mild increase in both total protein (\u05462.5 g/dl) and nucleated cell count (less than 5,000/\u03bcl). Thus, modifi ed transudates are generally transudates that have been present long enough to elicit a mild infl ammatory reaction (see Fig. 6 -6B). It is most often associated with cardiovascular disease or neoplastic conditions. In cases of extended duration, modifi ed transudates can have a cloudy to almost milky gross appearance. Such fl uids strongly resemble chyle and, in fact, have in the past been called \"pseudochylous effusions\" (a term no longer used). The gross appearance of these fl uids is the result of high lipid content (due to higher cholesterol content than serum) but is in no way related to a true chylous effusion, as there are no triglycerides or chylomicrons present (Hillerdal, 1997; Tyler and Cowell, 1989) . The phagocytes attracted to remove cellular debris from transudates are rich in enzymes that digest protein but are virtually devoid of enzymes that will break down complex lipids. Consequently, while most of the constituents of dying cells are removed by phagocytosis, lipid content of the cells simply accumulates in the effusion. Effusions formed in this manner are easily distinguished cytologically from true chylous effusions.\n\nThe principle cellular constituent of the modifi ed transudate is the reactive mesothelial cell (see Fig. 6 -3A). Because of the ability of mesothelial cells to respond to irritation by proliferation, the presence of increased numbers of mesothelial cell clusters and rafts is a common fi nding in reactivity (see Fig. 6 -3B). Mitoses are increased and occasional multinucleated reactive mesothelial cells are seen. Reactive mesothelial cells in clusters are capable of imbibing lipid from the effusion fl uid and when they do, they take on the characteristics of secretory cells. In this form they must be differentiated from metastatic adenocarcinoma or mesothelioma. This may be done by critically evaluating the cell populations for criteria of malignancy.\n\nAs modifi ed transudates mature, the proportion of infl ammatory cells they contain will increase. In most cases the principal infl ammatory cell is the nondegenerate neutrophil, but neutrophils rarely account for more than 30% of the total cell population. Over time, modifi ed transudates gradually become cytologically indistinguishable from nonspecifi c exudates. One method used to distinguish modifi ed transudates from exudates or transudates from exudates is measurement of C-reactive protein concentration in canine effusions (Parra et al., 2006) . \n\nExudates are the result of either increased vascular permeability secondary to infl ammation or vessel injury/ leakage (hemorrhagic effusion, chylous effusion). An exudative fl uid usually contains both increased protein and an increased nucleated cell count. The total protein concentration is usually greater than 3.0 g/dl along with cell counts greater than 5,000/\u03bcl. Infectious causes for exudates include bacteria ( Fig. 6-7A&B) , fungi, viruses, protozoa such as Toxoplasma (Toomey et al., 1995) , or helminthes such as Mesocestoides sp. (Caruso et al., 2003) . Noninfectious causes involve organ infl ammation such as pancreatitis, steatitis, infl ammatory neoplasia and irritants such as bile or urine. Cytologic evaluation is useful to determine an underlying cause in cases of exudative effusions. Infl ammatory effusions are classifi ed according to the standard rules for infl ammation as neutrophilic, mixed, or macrophagic. In neutrophilic reactions, neutrophils (either nondegenerate or degenerate) comprise \u03fe70% of the infl ammatory cells seen. Mixed reactions are characterized by a mixture of neutrophils and macrophages. In histiocytic infl ammation, macrophages are the prevalent cell seen.\n\nMost infl ammatory effusions are cytologically nonspecifi c in terms of etiologic diagnosis. However, as with infl ammatory responses elsewhere, cytomorphology provides signifi cant clues as to the underlying cause. Neutrophilic infl ammatory effusions indicate severe active irritation ( Fig. 6-8 ). If neutrophils are degenerate, an effort should be made to identify bacterial organisms within phagocytes (primarily neutrophils). This is generally easiest at the feathered edge of the smear. If organisms are not seen, the fl uid should still be cultured. Mixed and macrophagic infl ammatory effusions refl ect less severe irritation and are found with resolving acute effusions or in association with less irritating etiologic agents than bacteria (e.g., fungal organisms or foreign bodies). Chemical evaluation of effusion fl uid is also useful in recognizing sepsis.\n\nSeptic effusions may be diagnosed by use of biochemical parameters in dogs and cats. It was shown that effusion fl uid in dogs and cats with a pH \u03fd7.2, pCO 2 \u03fe55 mm Hg, glucose concentration \u03fd50 mg/dl, and lactate concentration \u03fe5.5 mmol/L is highly likely to have bacterial infection (Swann et al., 1996) . A study involving peritoneal fl uid in dogs and cats evaluated blood and effusion fl uid glucose concentrations. This study found that a difference of blood-effusion glucose \u03fe20 mg/dl provides a rapid and reliable means to differentiate septic and nonseptic effusion fl uid (Bonczynski et al., 2003) . In this study, a difference of blood-effusion lactate concentration in dogs \u03fd\u03ea2.0 mmol/L was 100% sensitive and 100% specifi c for the diagnosis of septic peritonitis.\n\nWhile most infl ammatory effusions are cytologically nonspecifi c, some etiologies cause reactions with characteristic diagnostic features. These effusions are discussed below.\n\nFeline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is unique among the causes of infl ammatory effusion in that the fl uid that accumulates is usually high in protein, yet has a low cellularity (McReynolds et al., 1997) . Classifi cation as an infl ammatory effusion is based primarily on the presence of high total protein (often \u03fe4.5 g/dl) which is a refl ection of a similar elevation in serum protein. Electrophoresis of either the effusion fl uid or the serum reveals a polyclonal gammopathy. An albumin-to-globulin ratio of less than 0.8 on the fl uid is very suggestive for FIP. It has been reported that if gamma globulin is greater than 32% of the protein in the effusion fl uid, this is suggestive of FIP (Shelly et al., 1988 ). An additional test that can help rule in or rule out FIP is the Rivalta test. To perform this relatively simple test, place one drop of 98% acetic acid into 5 ml distilled water and mix well in a reagent tube. Then add slowly one drop of the effusion fl uid to the surface of the acetic acid solution. A positive test requires that the drop of effusion retain its form on the surface or slowly sink to the bottom as a droplet or jellyfi sh-like shape ( Fig. 6-9A ). This test indicates a high protein content as well as fi brin and infl ammatory mediators. This test has a positive predictive value of 86% and a negative predictive value of 97% (Hartmann et al., 2003) . A more specifi c cytologic test for FIP involves immunofl uorescence of intracellular feline coronavirus (FCo V) within effusion macrophages. When positive (Fig 6-9B ), this test is diagnostic for FIP; however, the negative predictive value is 57%, so a negative test may miss cases of FIP (Hartmann et al., 2003) .\n\nCytologically these fl uids are usually relative low in cell number (1000 to 30,000/\u03bcl) and inconsistent with regard to the cell types present. In a majority of cases the predominant cell is the nondegenerate neutrophil ( Fig. 6-9C ). However, mixed to macrophagic reactions may be seen ( Fig. 6-9D ). In rare cases, the lymphocyte is prevalent. Regardless of the predominant cell type, slides in all cases have a purple granular background that results from the high protein content (see Fig. 6 -9C).\n\nComplex bacteria such as Nocardia asteroides and Actinomyces sp. are important causes of both peritoneal and pleural effusions in dogs and cats. Grossly, these effusions are turbid and yellow to blood-tinged \"tomato soup.\" Even when collected in EDTA they typically contain visible particulates or granules (the so-called \"sulfur granules\") (Songer and Post, 2005) .\n\nOn the basis of physical parameters, these effusions are typical exudates, with high total protein and markedly high cellularity. Because of the high cellularity, direct smears are generally adequate for cytologic examination. If particles are observed in the fl uid, it is important to make squash preparations of these particles in addition to making smears of the fl uid alone.\n\nMicroscopically, nocardial and actinomycotic infections are characterized by neutrophilic to mixed infl ammation, probably dependent on the duration of the disease. In the more chronic reactions, there is generally a signifi cant reactive mesothelial cell component to the response. A striking feature of the infl ammatory response is the morphology of the neutrophils. Whereas most cases of septic pleuritis and peritonitis are signaled by the presence of predominantly degenerating neutrophils, in nocardial and actinomycotic effusions the majority of the neutrophils away from the organisms are nondegenerate. Degenerating neutrophils are only seen immediately in the vicinity of the bacterial organisms because these agents, in contrast to most other bacteria, produce only weak local toxins. The net effect of this phenomenon is that smears in these cases may be easily misinterpreted as noninfectious, particularly if the organisms are not widespread. Because the particles seen grossly often are composed of bacterial colonies, it is extremely important that squash preparations of these particles be examined to ensure that the diagnosis is not missed (Fig. 6-10A&B) .\n\nMorphology of the organisms microscopically is quite characteristic. Colonies are composed of delicate fi lamentous, often beaded, organisms and are often found at the feathered edge of smears ( Fig. 6-10C) . The most signifi cant diagnostic feature of these organisms is that the fi laments are branching. Using standard hematologic stains, Nocardia organisms cannot be differentiated from Actinomyces. However, Nocardia sp. is gram positive and are variably acid-fast positive whereas Actinomyces sp. are gram positive and acid-fast negative (Songer and Post, 2005) .\n\nCytologic diagnosis should be confi rmed by bacterial culture of the effusion and/or sulfur granules. Because these species have special culture requirements, it is important that the bacteriology laboratory be fully aware of the provisional diagnosis at the time of sample submission.\n\nSystemic histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum is a moderately frequent cause of peritoneal effusion in dogs living in the Ohio River Valley (United States). Because the fungus is ubiquitous in the area, serology cannot be relied upon for diagnosis. In many cases, cytologic identifi cation of the organism is essential.\n\nThe effusion fl uid of histoplasmosis is relatively unique. The fl uid is usually clear and colorless. On the basis of physical characteristics, the fl uid is a modifi ed transudate; however, cytologically, it is clearly infl ammatory with signifi cantly more neutrophils than are seen in the typical canine modifi ed transudate. Whenever infl ammatory modifi ed transudates are seen in dogs, the possibility of histoplasmosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis. If seen in an effusion, the disease is considered disseminated and can be found elsewhere such as the liver, spleen, bone marrow, rectal wall, and peripheral blood.\n\nDemonstration of the organism is best done in macrophages ( Fig. 6-11) at the feathered edge of sediment smears. Histoplasma organisms measure approximately 2 to 3 \u03bcm in diameter, are round to ovoid in shape, and have a single basophilic nucleus surrounded by a thick, colorless cell wall. In fl uids, it is common to see individual organisms free in the background. The only other organisms of similar cytologic morphology are Leishmania. However, Leishmanial protozoans are distinguished by the presence of an internal kinetoplast, which gives them the appearance of having two nuclei.\n\nRupture of the gall bladder or common bile duct may occur in any species secondary to direct trauma or disease of the biliary tree. In addition, it is an infrequent accompaniment to diaphragmatic hernia from any cause in the dog and cat. When the results of direct trauma are mainly to the biliary system, leakage of bile is virtually always restricted to the peritoneal cavity, with a resulting peritonitis. When associated with diaphragmatic hernia, leakage of bile occurs when liver is trapped in the diaphragmatic rent and there is necrosis of the gall bladder or common bile duct. In this circumstance, both peritonitis and pleuritis can result. Bile is a very irritative substance; its presence quickly elicits an infl ammatory response. Grossly, the fl uid may be initially \u25a0 FIGURE 6-11. Histoplasmosis. Dog. A macrophage containing numerous oval 2-3 \u03bcm yeast organisms of Histoplasma capsulatum is seen at left center. There are numerous red cells in the background of the smear. (Modifi ed Wright; HP oil.) brown (see Fig. 6 -1G) to yellow to greenish; however, as the response becomes more and more cellular, this discoloration may become masked. Large volumes of fl uid can usually be obtained.\n\nCytologically, the striking feature of bilious effusion is the presence of bile on the slide. Frequently, bile is seen as yellow to green to blue-black granular material scattered in the slide background ( Fig. 6-12A -C) and in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, reactive mesothelial cells, and macrophages. In reactions of greater duration, bile granules may have all been converted to rhomboidal to amorphous golden crystals of bile pigment. When such crystals are found in the cytoplasm of effusion phagocytes in the absence of evidence of prior hemorrhage (e.g., erythrophagocytosis), the possibility of bilious effusion should be strongly considered. In addition to the typical appearance of bilious effusions, acellular, amorphous, fi brillar blue-grey mucinous material ( Fig. 6-13A ) has been associated with biliary tree rupture, particularly of the common bile duct in dogs (Owens et al., 2003) . Instead of the green or yellow bile granules present, lakes of extracellular material are the predominant cytologic fi nding. It is suspected that this bile-free material is produced by biliary and gallbladder epithelium as a consequence to extrahepatic biliary obstruction with regurgitation of normal bile into hepatic lymph and venous blood.\n\nThe cellular response to bile is generally mixed with large numbers of neutrophils nearly always present (Fig. 6-13B&C) . The degree of degeneration of neutrophils is variable. In addition, bile causes severe irritation to the mesothelial lining of the body cavities, resulting in marked reactive mesothelial cell hyperplasia.\n\nFluid bilirubin levels that are markedly elevated and several times than levels in serum also give support for a diagnosis of bilious effusion (Owens et al., 2003) .\n\nEffusions with more than 10% eosinophils are termed eosinophilic effusions regardless of the protein content or cell count. This condition is uncommonly seen in veterinary medicine. With large numbers of eosinophils, the fl uid grossly may have a green tint. The presence of eosinophils does not provide a specifi c diagnosis and the cause is often unknown in these cases. Neoplasia such as lymphoma or mastocytosis involved half of the cases in one study . Heartworm disease, systemic mastocytosis, interstitial pneumonia, disseminated eosinophilic granulomatosis, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis are other possibilities in dogs (Mertens et al., 2005; Bounous et al., 2000) .\n\nUrine in the peritoneal space results in chemical irritation. The protein content may be markedly low as a result of dilution from the urine but the cell count and predominant cell type is usually indicative of infl ammation or an exudate (see Table 6 -1). Early in the condition, a mononuclear cell population may predominate, suggestive of a modifi ed transudate. Bacteria may or may not be present. Neutrophils exposed to the irritant material may show karyolysis with ragged nuclear borders ( Fig. 6-14) . In some cases, urinary crystals are found on cytologic examination, which leads to a diagnosis of uroperitoneum. In one study in cats, creatinine or potassium was increased in fl uid and served as a useful predictor for uroperitoneum, generally in a ratio of 2:1 compared with that in serum (Aumann et al., 1998) . Simultaneous evaluation of fl uid and serum creatinine should show a higher creatinine in the fl uid, as it equilibrates much slower than urea nitrogen (BUN). In addition, the serum Na:K also tends to depress in cases of uroabdomen (Aumann et al., 1998; Burrows and Bovee, 1974) .\n\nIn a small number of dogs with ascites, often from western North America, the etiology is aberrant cestodiasis from Mesocestoides infection (Stern et al., 1987; Crosbie et al., 1998; Caruso et al., 2003) . Rare reports of infection involve cats. Peritoneal aspirates from anorexic, ascitic dogs are macrophagic with the appearance of tapioca pudding or cream of wheat (Fig. 6-15) . Motile cestodes can be seen in fl uid with the unaided eye. Microscopic examination may show acephalic metacestodes or acoelomic tissue with calcareous corpuscles ( Fig. 6-16) , which may be seen in nonspecifi c cestode infections. Less often seen microscopically are metacestodes with visible tetrathyridia, a unique larval form having four suckers that represents the asexual reproductive form of Mesocestoides spp. infection ( Fig. 6-17) . Cestode ova are not usually found in the feces (Crosbie et al., 1998) .\n\nChylous effusions contain chyle, which is a mixture of lymph and chylomicrons. Chylomicrons, derived from dietary lipids processed in the intestine and transported via lymphatics, are primarily composed of triglycerides. Historically, chylous effusions were thought to be primarily a result of thoracic duct rupture. It is now known that there are a variety of causes for chylous effusions and that rupture of the thoracic duct is uncommon. Causes for chylous effusions in the thoracic cavity include cardiovascular disease, neoplasia (e.g., lymphoma, thymoma, and lymphangiosarcoma), heartworm disease, diaphragmatic hernia, lung torsion, mediastinal fungal granulomas, chronic coughing, vomiting, or idiopathic (Fossum, 1993; Fossum et al., 1986a; Forrester et al., 1991; Waddle and Giger, 1990) . In one study (Fossum et al., 1986a) . Afghan hounds appeared to have a higher incidence of chylothorax compared to other breeds of dogs. It seems that chylous pleural effusions are more common in cats than dogs, presumably because their lymphatics are more easily damaged by trauma or obstruction.\n\nChylous ascites is less common. Causes for chyloperitoneum include intra-abdominal neoplasia, steatitis, biliary cirrhosis, lymphatic rupture or leakage, postoperative accumulation following ligation of the thoracic duct, congenital lymphatic abnormalities, and other causes (Fossum et al., 1992; Gores et al., 1994) .\n\nGrossly, chylous effusions are described as \"milky\" white to pink-white fl uids, depending on dietary fat content and the presence or absence of hemorrhage ( Fig. 6-18A&B ). Some cases of chylous effusion may have fl uid that is clear to serosanguineous. Chylous effusions contain triglycerides at a level higher than that found in serum in a ratio often greater than 3:1 (Meadows and MacWilliams, 1994) . A cholesterol-to-triglyceride (C/T) ratio of less than 1 is generally considered characteristic of a chylous effusion (Fossum et al., 1986b) . Based on lipoprotein electrophoretic studies, pleural chylous effusions can be better identifi ed by fl uid triglyceride concentrations greater than 100 mg/dl and nonchylous effusions by concentrations less than 100 mg/dl (Waddle and Giger, 1990) . In those same studies, C/T ratios were less reliable.\n\nCell counts and protein concentrations are elevated over pure transudate levels and therefore chylous effusions generally fi t into modifi ed transudate or exudate (most commonly) categories depending on the degree of chronicity. The total protein evaluated by refractometry can be spurious due to interference by the lipid in the solution (George, 2001) .\n\nCytologically, they are characterized by the presence of large numbers of morphologically normal small lymphocytes (Figs. 6-19 and 6-20A) . Lesser numbers of reactive lymphocytes are also usually present. Because these fl uids are mildly irritating, long-standing chylous effusions also may contain moderate numbers of reactive mesothelial cells and other infl ammatory cells that may contain phagocytized lipid. This lipid generally appears as multiple discrete, colorless vacuoles within the cytoplasm (Fig. 6-20B ). Some cases of chronic chylous effusion present with signifi cant numbers of eosinophils. The presence of lipid in the background of the slide, visualized as small, unstained droplets at the periphery of the nucleated cells, is variable.\n\nTrue hemorrhagic effusions can occur in any of the major body cavities. Grossly, these effusions are red to serosanguineous depending on the age of the exudate and the extent of the hemorrhage. Physical evaluation reveals a protein level refl ective of, but somewhat less than, that of peripheral blood. Both nucleated cell counts and red blood cell counts are usually elevated.\n\nCytology is needed to differentiate true hemorrhagic effusions from sample contamination at the time of collection. Hemorrhagic effusions contain predominantly red blood cells with lesser numbers of nucleated cells. The most signifi cant indicator of true hemorrhage is the presence of macrophages containing phagocytized red cells (erythrophagocytosis) and/or hemosiderin ( indicates that the hemorrhage occurred more than two days before collection. These cells are best observed at the feathered edge of sediment smears. Erythrophagocytosis is not seen if hemorrhage is strictly a collection artifact. A second signifi cant observation is whether platelets are seen. True hemorrhagic exudates are devoid of platelets but they are commonly observed in contaminated samples. If uncertainty exists whether the pigment is hemosiderin, in contrast to bile, melanin, or carbon, Prussian blue staining can indicate the presence of iron in hemosiderin (Fig. 6-22B ).\n\nNeoplastic processes, both primary and metastatic, are relatively common causes of both abdominal and thoracic effusions in dogs and cats. Neoplastic effusions may be accompanied by signifi cant hemorrhage and/or infl ammation but generally they are noninfl ammatory. Grossly, the fl uid may be clear to cloudy and hemorrhagic. Total protein levels are often elevated but nucleated cell counts are highly variable. In dogs and cats, the common causes of neoplastic effusions are lymphoma (pleural), and adenocarcinoma or carcinoma (either pleural or peritoneal). Sarcomas may cause effusions but neoplastic cells of mesenchymal origin seldom shed cells into the effusion fl uid. Mesothelioma can be a rare cause of effusion in any species.\n\nRegardless of the type of neoplasia present, diagnostic cells may or may not be evident in an effusion. If a mass is known to be present, fl uid analysis a well as fi neneedle aspiration of the mass may be necessary for defi nitive diagnosis. In one study of the detection of malignant tumors in abdominal and thoracic fl uids, sensitivity was low at 64% for dogs and 61% for cats; however, specifi city was high at 99% for dogs and 100% for cats (Hirschberger et al., 1999) . In the following paragraphs the cytologic features of the principal neoplastic effusions are summarized and illustrated.\n\nLymphomatous effusions are generally highly cellular and contain a pleomorphic population of discrete round cells that are morphologically consistent with lymphocytes. The neoplastic cells have high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, scant to moderate amounts of cytoplasm, and often scattered, small cytoplasmic vacuoles. Occasionally granular lymphocytes are the predominant neoplastic cell (Fig. 6-23 ). Moderate numbers of mitoses are seen.\n\nScattered among the neoplastic cells are red blood cells, reactive mesothelial cells, and infl ammatory cells.\n\nThe principle differential diagnosis for lymphomatous effusion is chylous effusion. In truth, lymphomatous invasion of lymphatics often causes a concomitant chylous effusion. However, recognizing the presence of lymphoma is generally not a major problem. Most cases of lymphoma consist of malignant cells that are much larger and more pleomorphic than normal lymphocytes with nuclei containing prominent, often bizarre and angular nucleoli (Fig. 6-24A&B ). Only rare cases of lymphoma have cells that are morphologically the same as normal small lymphocytes. In these cases the principal differentiating feature of the neoplastic disease is a much greater cellularity than what is generally seen with chylous effusion alone.\n\nEvaluation of the types of lymphoid cells found within the fl uid by immunocytochemistry or fl ow cytometry may provide signifi cant information related to the origin of these lymphoid cells. A monotypic population of medium and/or large lymphocytes is more likely associated with neoplasia (Figs. 6-24C, 6-25, and 6-26) than with a reactive process. Immunocytochemistry with antibodies against the molecules CD3 (T-cell) and CD79a (B-cell) is helpful in these cases.\n\nCarcinomatous effusions in dogs and cats may be the result of either a primary or secondary neoplastic process. In the chest, the principal primary neoplasm is pulmonary adenocarcinoma. In order for neoplastic cells from this tumor to be present in pleural effusions, the neoplasm must have invaded either into pulmonary vessels and lymphatics or directly through the pleural surface of the lung and into the pleural cavity.\n\nPulmonary adenocarcinoma is a relatively uncommon tumor that rarely extends into the pleural cavity. As a consequence, most carcinomatous pleural effusions are the result of metastatic disease. In females, by far the most common cause of such effusions is metastatic mammary carcinoma; in males, the two most common metastatic carcinomas seen are prostatic carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma.\n\nIn the peritoneal cavity the principal causes of carcinomatous effusions are those neoplasms which spread by implantation on the peritoneal surface. Signifi cant among these are cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ovarian adenocarcinoma in females, and prostatic carcinoma in males. Metastatic mammary carcinoma is also a common cause of peritoneal carcinomatosis.\n\nCytologically, all of these tumors are morphologically similar and cannot be readily differentiated (Clinkenbeard, 1992) . Carcinomatous effusions are characterized by the presence of rafts and acinar arrays (adenocarcinoma) of round to polygonal cells with variable amounts of often extremely basophilic cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic basophilia may be so intense as to obscure nuclear detail. Infl ammation may or may not be present, but reactive mesothelial cell hyperplasia is a constant feature (Figs. 6-27A&B and 6-28A&B). Establishing a diagnosis of pleural or peritoneal carcinomatosis is probably the most diffi cult challenge in diagnostic fl uid cytology. Carcinoma cells strongly resemble reactive mesothelial cells and cytoplasmic basophilia in both of these populations makes evaluation of nuclear criteria of malignancy particularly diffi cult. The problems become even more exaggerated when signifi cant infl ammation is present because reactive mesothelial cells can become quite dysplastic. For these reasons it is particularly important to search diligently for nuclear criteria of malignancy in suspect populations of cells. Areas where nuclear detail can be seen must be found (see . Whereas in most circumstances four nuclear criteria are suffi cient to allow a diagnosis of malignancy, in the case of pleural or peritoneal carcinomatosis, at least fi ve distinct nuclear criteria should be demonstrated.\n\nOnce the diagnosis of malignancy has been established, differentiation of carcinoma from adenocarcinoma is much easier. Adenocarcinomas are secretory tumors; as such, most instances of these vacuoles are unstained. In some cells the amount of secretory product is suffi cient to displace the nucleus peripherally. Simple carcinomas are devoid of secretory vacuoles.\n\nMesothelioma is a rare tumor that can occur in any species. The neoplasm arises from the mesothelial lining of the serous body cavities. Cytologically, the tumor is very diffi cult to differentiate from carcinoma and reactive mesothelial hyperplasia. Tumor cells are round to polygonal and are arranged primarily in clusters.\n\nNuclei are hyperchromic and located centrally. Often nuclei of adjacent cells within a cluster appear to press against each other resulting in triangulation of nuclei (nuclear molding). Because of the diffi culty of differentiating mesothelioma from reactive mesothelial hyperplasia, caution must be used when evaluating suspect populations for criteria of malignancy. As with carcinomatous effusions, at least fi ve defi nite nuclear criteria of malignancy must be seen before a presumptive diagnosis is made (Fig. 6-29A-C) .\n\nOnce the diagnosis of malignancy has been established, an attempt to differentiate mesothelioma from carcinoma can be made. There are no well-established morphologic criteria for differentiating these tumors; consequently, such attempts are often an exercise in futility. Based on relative frequency of occurrence, most of these effusions are simply considered to be carcinomatous until proven otherwise. A case of mesothelioma has been recognized by the use of the immunohistochemical marker calretinin in a horse (Stoica et al., 2004) ; it is possible that this marker can be used to differentiate mesothelioma and carcinoma in other species. \n\nPericardial effusions may also be classifi ed as transudates, modifi ed transudates, or exudates. Because they are somewhat unique in their presentation, they are considered separately.\n\nIn many cases, pericardial effusion fl uid is hemorrhagic (Figs. 6-30 and 6-31) . Causes of pericardial effusions include neoplasia, which involves 41% (Kerstetter et al., 1997) to 58% (Dunning, 2001) of canine cases examined. Benign idiopathic pericardial hemorrhage accounted for up to 45% of cases in dogs in one study (Kerstetter et al., 1997) . A variety of other infrequently seen causes, including infection, cardiac insuffi ciency, uremia, trauma, foreign body, coagulopathy, pericarditis, hernia, or left atrial rupture, have been reported (Bouvy and Bjorling, 1991; Petrus and Henik, 1999; Shubitz et al., 2001; Peterson et al., 2003) . Pericardial effusions in cats are most often related to congestive heart failure (28%). FIP, which accounted for 17%, is the second most frequent disease causing pericardial effusion in cats (Bouvy and Bjorling, 1991) .\n\nCytologic evaluation of pericardial effusion is challenging, but is most valuable in ruling out infection and infl ammation. The pericardium is notorious for eliciting mesothelial hyperplasia. These mesothelial cells become very large and basophilic, often binucleate with prominent nucleoli (see Fig. 6 -3B) and mitotic fi gures. It is often not possible to distinguish these reactive mesothelial cells from possible neoplastic cells. In addition, hemangiosarcoma may cause pericardial hemorrhage, but neoplasia of mesenchymal origin typically will not shed neoplastic cells into effusions. In one study (Sisson et al., 1984) , 74% of 19 neoplastic effusions were not detected on the basis of cytologic fi ndings and 13% of 31 non-neoplastic effusions were falsely reported as positive, leading the authors to conclude that pericardial fl uid analysis did not reliably distinguish neoplastic from non-neoplastic disorders. More recently, cardiac troponins I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) have been evaluated in Observe the erythrophagia, reactive mesothelial cells, macrophage, and small lymphocytes with many red blood cells. Also note that one macrophage contains brown hemosiderin pigment. One mesothelial cell contains two nuclei. Cytologic evaluation of pericardial fl uid is important to rule out infection and some types of neoplasia. Often additional testing is required to determine the cause of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion. (Romanowsky; HP oil.) pericardial fl uid. Results from this study involving 37 dogs suggest that cTNI may be useful in differentiating idiopathic pericardial effusions from those caused by hemangiosarcoma (Shaw et al., 2004) . Further testing is often required (e.g., ultrasonography, coagulation testing, pericardiectomy, fi nding other evidence of trauma) to determine the underlying cause for the effusion. In a study of 51 dogs with pericardial effusions, the pH of the fl uid was examined and compared with a fi nal diagnosis (Edwards, 1996) . When measured by precise instrumentation, the pH indicated that a reading greater than 7.3 was likely due to noninfl ammatory conditions, usually neoplasia. Using a less accurate urinary dipstick, pericardial fl uid pH \u03ed 7.0 was associated with neoplasia in 93% of the cases, while \u03fd7.0 suggested benign or non-neoplastic conditions. The pH of the fl uid needs to be measured shortly after obtaining the sample. A recent study found similar results; however, considerable overlap was detected, thus limiting the usefulness of pH to differentiate the etiology of pericardial effusions (Fine et al., 2003) .\n\nIn some instances, other laboratory tests on an effusion may be indicated to help determine a specifi c cause for the fl uid accumulation. A summary of previously described tests is shown in Table 6 -2. "}
