{"title": "Suppression of bovine lymphocyte responses to mitogens following in vivo and in vitro treatment with dexamethasone", "body": "The administration of glucocorticosteroids (GC) is widely used as an experimental means of mimicking the immunosuppressive effects of a stressinduced rise in blood cortisol. Glucocorticosteroid-induced immunosuppression is also used in the therapy of inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases (Cupps and Fauci, 1982) and in the study of immune responses to infectious agents (Davies and Carmichael, 1973; Crouch et al., 1985 ) . The result of GC treatment on the immune system varies considerably between species giving rise to designations of a species being either \"cortisone-resistant\" or \"cortisone-sensitive\" (Claman et al., 1971 ). However, not only is there interspecies variation but the effects of GC treatment are dependent on other parameters such as the age of the animal (Yang and Schultz, 1986 ) and the dose of GC used (Roth and Kaeberle, 1982 ) .\n\nAlthough cattle are regarded as a \"corticosteroid-resistant\" species (Wilkie et al., 1979 ) , suppression of proliferative responses of cattle peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens has been reported following both in vivo administration ofGC (Muscoplat et al., 1975; Roth et al., 1984; Pruett et al., 1987) and in vitro treatment of lymphocytes with GC (Ojo-Amaize et al., 1988) . However, there has been no comparison in cattle of in vivo and in vitro effects ofdexamethasone (DM) either on responses to the three mitogens most commonly used, i.e. phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (ConA) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM), or on different sub-populations of T cells.\n\nIn cattle, as in other animal species, the equivalents of the T helper/inducer (CD4 \u00f7, CD8-, CD2 \u00f7, CD5 \u00f7 ) and T cytotoxic/suppressor (CD4-, CD8 \u00f7, CD2 \u00f7, CD5 \u00f7 ) cells represent two major sub-populations in the peripheral blood. However, a third numerically large sub-population is also present in cattle. These are CD2-, CD5 \u00f7, CD4-, CD8- (Clevers et al., 1990) and express the gamma/delta (~,/~) form of T cell receptor (TCR). They can be identified with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against a surface molecule with a molecular mass (Mr) of 215-300 kDa, called the BoWC1 antigen, that has no known human CD homologue (Clevers, 1990; Howard and Morrison, 1991 ) . These cells are called BoWC 1 \u00f7 for convenience here, in accordance with the recommendation of the recent workshop on bovine leukocyte differentiation antigens (Howard and Morrison, 1991 ) .\n\nIn this paper we compare the effects of both in vivo and in vitro treatment with dexamethasone (DM) on the responsiveness of calflymphocytes to PHA, ConA and PWM. Also, we relate these observations to changes in lymphocyte sub-populations in the peripheral blood occurring during DM treatment.\n\nTen gnotobiotic (nine male, one female) calves, from 7 to 43 days of age were used in the in vivo experiments. These animals were produced and reared on a milk-based diet Hoare et al., 1976) .\n\nCalves were randomly assigned to one of two groups (n = 5 ), Group A remained untreated, whilst Group B received daily injections of DM ('Dexadreson', Intervet, Cambridge, UK; intra-muscular, 0.5 mg kg-1 body weight) for 20 days starting at between 11 and 15 days of age.\n\nBlood was collected regularly, at the same time of day and shortly before the injection of DM for haematological analysis and to prepare mononuclear cells to assess proliferative responses to mitogens (see below). Mononuclear cells were obtained from two calves in Group B prior to and during DM treatment and were used for the determination of cell sub-populations by FACS analysis (see below).\n\nBlood was taken from six male gnotobiotic and seven male conventional calves aged between 17 and 260 days for in vitro experiments. Mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens were taken from two of these animals at slaughter.\n\nBlood was collected in vessels containing heparin (20 units ml-I). Total white blood cell counts were made and differential counts were performed on Leishman stained blood smears.\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation of heparinised blood over Histopaque 1083 (Sigma Chemical Co., Poole, UK) at 900 \u00d7 g for 40 min. Suspensions of mesenteric lymph node and spleen cells in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.15 M, pH 7.2 ) were obtained from tissues disrupted by pressing through a wire mesh before centrifugation over Histopaque as above. The cells from the interface were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in tissue culture medium at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 106 cells ml-1. The tissue culture medium used was RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Paisley, UK) supplemented with heat-inactivated (56 \u00b0 C, 30 min) 10% FCS (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, UK), 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU ml-1 penicillin, 0.2 mg ml-1 streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES and 27 mM sodium bicarbonate.\n\nMononuclear cell preparations (0.2 ml, 2 X 10 6 cells ml -I ) were cultured in fiat-bottomed microplates (Nunclon Delta, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) with or without the addition of mitogens. Optimal concentrations of the mitogens PHA, ConA and PWM (all mitogens purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., Poole, UK) were determined in previous experiments and were 45 #g ml-l, 5 #g ml-I and 1 : 100 of stock, respectively. All cultures were set up in triplicate and the mean used in subsequent calculations. After culture for 72 h in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air, 1 /~Ci [3H]thymidine ( [3H ] TdR, 5 Ci mmol -l, Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, UK) was added to each well. After a further 5 h culture, the cells were harvested onto glassfibre filters with a semi-automated harvester. Incorporation of [ 3H ] TdR into cellular DNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting and the results expressed as counts per minute (cpm).\n\nLymphocyte proliferation was assayed with cells from untreated control calves as described above. Tenfold dilutions of DM were made in tissue culture medium and added to some of the cultures to give a range of final concentrations from 5.1 X 10-4 M to 5.1 X 10-lo M. Dexamethasone was added at the start of lymphocyte culture and proliferation was assessed by incorporation of [ 3H ] TdR and the results expressed as the percentage of the control culture.\n\nProliferation, % of control -cpm culture with DM 1 O0 cpm culture without DM X\n\nIn three experiments, recombinant human interleukin 2 (IL2, Boehringer Mannheim, Lewes, UK) was added to the cells over a range of concentrations at the commencement of culture. Proliferation was assessed as above and the results expressed as the percentage of the control culture.\n\ncpm culture with DM + IL2 Proliferation, % of control-cpm culture without DM + IL2 \u00d7 100\n\nPeripheral blood lymphocytes ( 10 ml; 2 X 10 6 cells ml-1 ) were cultured in 25-cm 2 flasks (Nunc) to study the in vitro effect of DM on cell surface markers. They were cultured in the presence or absence of the mitogens, PHA or ConA, added at optimal concentrations, and without DM or with DM added at two concentrations, 10 -9 M or 10 -6 M. After 72 h culture, the cells in the flasks were transferred into plastic Universals (Flow) and washed twice with PBS prior to staining for surface antigens (see below).\n\nThe mAbs used for immunofluorescent staining of cell suspensions together with their specificities are listed in Table 1 . Monoclonal antibody IL-A51 is considered to recognise the BoCD8 antigen (Ellis et al., 1986; Howard and Morrison, 1991 ) . Monoclonal antibody IL-A21 recognises a non-polymorphic MHC class II determinant in cattle (kindly provided by the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Disease, Kenya). Monoclonal antibody CC 15 is directed against the BoWC 1 antigen present on the BoCD2-, BoCD5 \u00f7, BoCD4-, BoCD8-, T lymphocyte sub-population in bovine peripheral blood and recognises the equivalent population to those cells expressing SBU-19 in sheep (MacKay, 1988; Clevers et al., 1990) . Monoclonal antibody CC21 is directed against an antigen with an approximate molecular mass of 145 kDa that is present on peripheral bovine B cells (Naessens et al., 1990) . Suspensions of cells were stained for surface antigen expression as described previously (Howard et al., 1989 ) for examination on a FACS Analyser or FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Sunnyvale, CA) except that FITC-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., Birmingham, AL, USA) was utilised for analysis on a FACScan.\n\nStudent's t-test was used to compare the differences between mean proliferative responses.\n\nAnalyses comparing the differences between responses by control and DMtreated calves used the results (i.e. counts per minute) without further manipulation. Analyses comparing the differences between responses to PHA, ConA and PWM in the DM-treated group used the mean response to each mitogen (in cpm) between days 7 and 20 post-treatment for individual animals, expressed as a percentage of the mean response for the control (untreated) group to the same mitogen over the same period.\n\nCalves receiving DM treatment developed slight hair loss, exopthalmos and apathy after about 1 week of treatment. There were no more infections in the immunosuppressed group compared with the control group but this was expected as the calves were gnotobiotes and were maintained in isolators as described in the Materials and Methods Section.\n\nThe number of circulating white blood cells (WBC) rose within 24 h of the first injection of DM and was highest after 48 h (Fig. 1 ) . The increased WBC count seen on Days 1-4 following DM treatment ( Fig. 1 (a) ) was accounted for by a large increase in the numbers of circulating neutrophils ( Fig. 1 (b) ). However, while total leukocyte counts had returned to normal by Day 5 of DM treatment, the numbers of neutrophils, after an initial decline from peak numbers, remained elevated for a further 11 days ( Fig. 1 (b) ). In contrast, the numbers of mononuclear cells in the circulation fell sharply within 24 h of the start of DM treatment and remained at these reduced levels (approximately 25% of the pre-DM level) until the end of the period of treatment ( Fig. 1 (c) ).\n\nThe total and differential leukocyte counts of the control calves (Group A ) remained relatively constant throughout the experimental period (Figs. 1 (a)-1 (c) ) except for one calf which had an unexplained high neutrophil count on Day 14 ( Fig. l(b) ).\n\nLymphocytes from DM-treated calves showed significantly (P< 0.01 ) decreased responsiveness to the mitogens PHA, ConA and PWM when compared with non-treated calves. However, the level of suppression was similar for all three mitogens. The mean level of suppression between Days 7 and 20 after the start of DM treatment was 83.7% for PHA, 68.7% for ConA and 75.3% for PWM. The results presented in Fig. 2 are from two representative calves from each group and demonstrate the kinetics of suppression to the three mitogens following DM treatment. Despite continued daily injections of DM, all calves showed transient recoveries in the immune responsiveness of their circulating lymphocytes on one or more occasions during the course of treatment (Fig. 2) . \n\nIn vitro addition of DM to cultures of lymphocytes from control calves markedly suppressed PHA responses (results not shown). The proliferative response to PHA was suppressed at low concentrations of DM (5.1 X 10-9 M) in 11 out of 12 calves. However, cells from six of these 11 calves with suppressed proliferative responses showed a recovery of their PHA responsiveness when the concentration of DM was increased to 5.1 \u00d7 10 -6 M or greater. Dexamethasone had no effect on the in vitro PHA response by lymphocytes from one calf. In marked contrast, the response to ConA was virtually unaffected even at very high concentrations ( 5.1 X 10-4 M ) of DM in eight out of ten calves tested (results not shown). In one of the two calves where DM suppressed the ConA response, the suppression was only modest (approximately 50% of the control proliferation ) and recovery of responsiveness was seen at higher DM concentrations as with PHA responses in some calves. Proliferative responses to PWM were variable; responses by lymphocytes from some animals were enhanced, some were suppressed while others were unaffected (results not shown). The responses of spleen and mesenteric lymph node lymphocyte to PHA, ConA and PWM were affected by DM in the same manner as blood lymphocytes (Figs. 3 (a)-3 (c) ).\n\nOne possible explanation for the in vitro suppression of PHA responsiveness was that DM was inhibiting IL-2 production. In order to test this possi- bility, IL-2 was added to PHA-stimulated lymphocyte cultures in the presence or absence of DM. These tests were carried out using lymphocytes from three calves (Fig. 4 ) . Two different patterns of suppression of the PHA response were observed. Lymphocytes from Calf 1 behaved in a similar way to that seen in previous calves with suppression increasing with increasing concentration of DM. However, lymphocytes from the other two calves exhibited maximal suppression at a DM concentration of 5.1 \u00d7 10-8 M and as the DM concentration increased above this, a lower degree of suppression was obtained. Despite these differences, addition of recombinant human IL-2 to the cultures at either 1 unit ml -~ (Calves 2 and 3) or 4 units ml -t (Calf 1 ) was able to, at least partially, restore responsiveness.\n\nThere was a depletion in the absolute numbers of B cells (slg \u00f7 ), T cells (CD5 \u00f7, although this also includes a minor sub-population of B cells) and macrophages from the circulation following DM treatment (Table 2 ) . However, the reduction in B cell numbers was more marked than the reduction of either T cells or macrophages. Similar results were obtained with two other mAbs to B cell antigens, either surface IgM or the 145 kDa B cell antigen (data not shown). Table 2 (Table 3) . Treatment with DM reduced both the number and percentage of circulating BoWC 1 \u00f7 cells, whereas, although the numbers of BoCD2 + T cells were reduced, their proportion of the total population did not decline. When the BoCD2 + T cell population was subdivided into BoCD4 +, BoCD8-and BoCD4-, BoCD8 \u00f7 sub-populations, no differences were seen between these two cell types in their sensitivity to DM. face antigens was analysed to determine whether this suppression was associated with a phenotypic change in the cells present in culture. There was no marked alteration in the percentage of cells expressing the majority of cell surface antigens following culture with DM (Table 4) . How- ever, BoCD8 and MHC II expression were affected. In the presence of PHA, DM (10-6 M) increased the percentage of cells expressing BoCD8. In contrast, MHC II expression was reduced by DM. The latter finding was most marked with cells cultured in the absence of mitogen, while the increased MHC II expression induced by culture with either PHA or ConA showed a more modest decrease. In addition to the change in the percentage of cells staining for MHC II antigens there was also a decrease in the overall intensity of staining for this molecule in the absence of PHA (Fig. 5 ) .\n\nThe results presented here show that the DM regimen used for the immunosuppression of young calves induces marked changes in haematological values. The magnitude of these changes compared with the minor changes seen by others (Pruett et al., 1987) is due probably to the high dose of DM and age of animals used in our studies.\n\nOur finding that responses to mitogens are suppressed following in vivo DM treatment are similar to those of Roth et al. (1984) who demonstrated suppression of both PHA and PWM in DM-treated steers. However, Pruett and colleagues found in stressed heifers that responses to ConA were more sensitive to suppression than those to PHA (Pruett et al., 1986) and PWM responses were enhanced in DM-treated steers (Pruett et al., 1987 ) . The differences between the results of the present study and those of Pruett et al. (1987 ) are unclear, but, as above, are probably a result of differences in the doses of GC used.\n\nThe in vitro studies carried out in parallel with our in vivo studies confirmed the sensitivity of the PHA response to the presence of dexamethasone. In contrast to the in vivo studies however, ConA responses were unaffected by in vitro culture with DM, even at very high concentrations. This finding would indicate that GC suppressed responses to PHA and ConA by different mechanisms or that PHA and ConA stimulate differently. Given in vivo, GC result in a redistribution of lymphocytes from the blood to other lymphoid organs (Cupps and Fauci, 1982) and this effect may have caused the depressed ConA and PWM responses seen following in vivo DM treatment. Redistribution of lymphocytes in vivo may have affected the PHA responses but the results obtained in vitro with DM suggested that DM also exerted a specific physiological effect on responses to PHA.\n\nGlucocorticosteroids have been shown to inhibit the production of IL-2 (Bettens et al., 1984 ) , tumour necrosis factor (Waage and Bakke, 1988 ) , ILl (Lee et al., 1988) in man and IL-3 (Culpepper and Lee, 1985) in mice. On the other hand, IL-4 production by a mouse Th clone was not affected by DM (Bertoglio and Leroux, 1988 ) . Gillis et al. ( 1979 ) found that addition of uncharacterised exogenous T cell growth factor to GC-suppressed cultures of mouse lymphocytes completely restored responsiveness. Similarly, in this study, PHA responsiveness was restored by the addition of exogenous recombinant human IL-2. This finding implies that the suppression of PHA responses by DM is due, at least partially, to blocked induction of IL-2 expression. Additionally, the inhibition of IL-2 receptor expression (Reed et al., 1986) may account for the incomplete restoration of the proliferative response by exogenous IL-2.\n\n\u2022 The effects of GC treatment on the expression of cell membrane components are variable, some being increased while others are decreased (Duval et al., 1983 ) . Another explanation for the difference in results seen with PHA and ConA is that there is a selective GC-mediated suppression of a molecule involved with the PHA responsiveness of lymphocytes. MHC II expression by the mitogen-presenting cell has been demonstrated by Torbett et al. ( 1986 ) to be essential for PHA (but not ConA) responses in the mouse. Of all the surface antigens examined in this study, only MHC II expression was reduced. However, the modest level of suppression seen with DM in mitogenstimulated cultures was not considered sufficient to explain the observed lack of responsiveness. The CD2 molecule on the T cell has been reported to bind PHA and to be involved in PHA-induced stimulation (O'Flynn et al., 1985 ) . The equivalent molecule in our study, BoCD2, was not affected by DM in vitro.\n\nAs stated above, Pruett et al. (1987) found that while PHA and ConA responses were suppressed, PWM responses were enhanced and suggested that this differential responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogens was the result of a change in the sub-populations ofT lymphocytes. No data were presented by these authors to support this suggestion. Although we did not observe this differential responsiveness to the mitogens, we did observe changes in the populations of lymphocytes present in the circulation. Firstly, our results confirmed the reports of others (Wilkie et al., 1979; Pruett et al., 1987 ) that there was no selective loss of total T cells. However, we were able to demonstrate a selective loss from the circulation of the BoWC14, 7/~ T lymphocyte subpopulation\u2022 Previous findings have shown that in vivo depletion with mAbs in cattle resulted in a reduced response to all three mitogens in vitro if the BoCD4 \u00f7 lymphocytes were depleted, but an enhanced response to PWM alone if the BoWC 1 \u00f7 lymphocytes were depleted (Howard et al., 1989) . There is no obvious simple relationship between these observations and DM may have additional physiological effects on lymphocytes. The functions of the BoCD4 \u00f7 and BoCD8 \u00f7 cells in cattle are equivalent to those of the same phenotype in other animal species. The function of the BoWC1 + sub-population, that is highly sensitive to DM in vivo, is not fully understood\u2022 This phenotype characteristically produces the 7/~ form of TCR in ruminants (MacKay, 1988; Clevers et al., 1990) and may have a modulating effect on the immune response (Howard et al., 1989 ) . The relative lack of effect on cell surface mark-ers seen following in vitro culture with DM probably suggests that the changes seen in vivo are the result of a selective redistribution of cells from the circulation into peripheral lymphoid organs.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that DM selectively depletes some lymphocyte populations from the circulation and suppresses peripheral blood lymphocyte responses to mitogens. We have also demonstrated that the immunosuppressive effects of DM differ depending on the mitogen being used and whether exposure to DM was carried out in vivo or in vitro. Clearly, different interpretations would be reached as to the cortisone sensitivity of the calves if only in vivo or in vitro studies had been conducted or if only one mitogen had been used in the proliferation tests. We would therefore suggest that the classification of a species as being corticosteroid-resistant or corticosteroidsensitive requires careful definition, not only of the age of the animal and dose of GC used, as others have demonstrated, but also of the tests used to assess immunosuppression and whether the tests are conducted following in vivo or in vitro exposure to GC. These results would also suggest that the mechanisms of stimulation by the mitogens PHA and ConA act through different pathways, perhaps at the second messenger level, and this system may provide a means whereby these pathways could be analysed."}
