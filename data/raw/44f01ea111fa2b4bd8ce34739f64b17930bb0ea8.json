{"title": "", "body": "This modelling study investigated the impact of an influenza pandemic on a community in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and compared it with that in a similar sized community in Australia. The effectiveness of social distancing interventions was determined using the PNG model and contrasted with the Australian model.\n\nA moderately transmissible pandemic occurring in PNG may be expected to result in a larger illness attack rate compared to that in a developed country setting.\n\nFeasible social distancing intervention strategies may be significantly less effective in PNG compared to the Australian setting. Compared to Australia, the larger household sizes contribute both to the larger attack rates in PNG and to the lower effectiveness of the interventions.\n\nThe larger proportion of children in PNG and the fact that 50% do not attend school lessen the effectiveness of school closure interventions.\n\nStrength and limitations of this study The findings are a first step in understanding how an influenza pandemic will impact on a low-income country.\n\nAs with all modelling studies obtaining high-quality field data with which to \"populate\" models is crucial and accessing such data in countries such as PNG is a challenge. These results and those from future research will permit better pandemic planning and allow intervention strategies to be tailored to the specific demographics and resource constraints found in developing countries. [1] and the possible occurrence of a highly pathogenic virus strain is of concern to health authorities worldwide. South-East Asia is especially at risk given the continuing presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in wild bird populations in close proximity to domestic poultry and humans. Indonesia is a major hotspot for continuing H5N1 infection [2] . Given the high mortality rates seen with human cases of H5N1 and the possibility that this strain may re-assort or mutate to become readily transmissible between humans, as has been shown using a ferret model under laboratory conditions [3] , research has been conducted to inform the development of appropriate pandemic preparedness plans. A key goal of this effort is to determine the effectiveness of interventions, in terms of their ability to reduce infection and consequential mortality rates.\n\nHowever, intervention strategies which modelling shows to be highly effective for developed countries may not be feasible or effective in low-income countries such as Papua New Guinea (PNG) due to different population demographics and resource constraints. Furthermore, little is known about the underlying \"drivers\" of seasonal and pandemic influenza in the tropics, in contrast to temperate regions having a distinctive winter season [4] . Data from the 1918/19 pandemic suggests a much higher attack rate in India compared to Europe and the USA [5, 6] . The aim of this study is to confirm this pattern, between developing and developed countries, and to explain why this higher attack rate occurs.\n\nA substantial number of pandemic influenza models have been constructed in the past decade; however their primary focus is on examining intervention effectiveness in developed (e.g. the USA and European countries [7] [8] [9] [10] ) and middle income countries (e.g. Thailand [11, 12] ). These models, and analyses using them, give limited guidance as to the impact which an influenza pandemic may have on lowincome countries such as PNG and those in sub-Saharan Africa [13] . These countries have markedly different demographic and community structure and limited resources and infrastructural constraints in comparison with developed countries. Significantly, it has been shown that co-morbidity is a strong predictor for severe and fatal outcomes following influenza infection [14] . High rates of co-morbidity arising from influenza infection coupled with disease conditions generally absent in developed countries (such as chronic malnutrition, malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia and HIV) will result in a significantly increased burden on health infrastructures in low-income countries already operating above capacity.\n\nTo address this modelling \"gap\", an individual-based disease transmission model of pandemic influenza has been developed for PNG, based on the methods used previously to develop a pandemic influenza model of Albany, Western Australia [10, 15, 16] . The chosen location of Madang, a town of approximately 35,000 on the northern coast of New Guinea has, along with all of PNG, different demographics and individual-to-individual contact patterns compared to those in developed countries. The model was used to describe the spread of a novel influenza strain after introduction into the community. The resulting illness attack rate was determined together with data indicating where person-to-person transmission occurred. An unmitigated outbreak and two outbreaks with PNG-feasible intervention strategies activated were simulated and the results compared to those obtained using the Albany, Australia model.\n\nCensus and country-wide data from the PNG National Statistics Office [17] together with field collected data was used to construct the Madang model. Following the methodology used to construct the Albany model, each household is explicitly represented, with occupants in one of 7 age categories. Schools, workplace and other mixing hubs were represented and persons allocated to them according to age category, so connecting households and hubs. Using transmission characteristics calibrated with the Australian model, simulations were performed using the Madang model and data extracted. These captured the day-to-day infection profile of the population following introduction of a novel strain of influenza into the modelled community, assuming no existing immunity.\n\nMadang model development used the most recent 2001 census data, other PNG government data and additional field data. [17] Census data provided the location groups of ~50 adjacent households, known as the census unit (CU). The specific demographics of each household in Madang in terms of number of individuals, their ages and occupation of adults was also provided and each individual is uniquely identified in the model. Other PNG data provided the location of workplaces and workforce numbers while the location and student numbers of educational institutions was determined by field data collection. These data allowed for construction of an explicit contact network linking households, schools, workplaces and other meeting places by allocating individuals to workplaces and schools, as with the Albany model [10] .\n\nThe contact network consists of households and schools, further education, workplace and community contact hubs, as indicated in the schematic in Figure 1 . Each household contains uniquely identified individuals and children are assigned by an allocation algorithm to school classes, and adults to workplaces according to age, using field data which gives class and workplace numbers. The field survey revealed that 50% of school-age children do not attend school, and this percentage is thought to be similar to most urban areas in PNG, with still lower rates in rural areas. Of those not attending school 50% are allocated to neighbourhood hubs, as described below. In addition to contact occurring in households and mixing hubs, community contact is introduced to capture mixing which occurs outwith these locales and in the wider community and occurs at a fixed rate, as with the Albany model.\n\nThe contact network captures population mobility occurring between households, schools, workplaces and the wider community, see Figure 1 . The virus spreads through the community due to this mobility, as transmission occurs between individuals when they are co-located, possibly following a move from one location to another.\n\nCensus data provides the occupation/activity of individuals, namely \"wage-job\", \"garden\", \"business\" and \"unemployed\". This was used to locate individuals denoted as wage-job with known workplaces. The numbers in this census category exceeded those found in the survey of major workplaces and local knowledge allowed us to create small, local workplaces to locate these additional adults and those in the business category. Adults with garden as their occupation work in family-owned gardens, subsistence farming and generating produce for sale. For each household containing a garden worker, a garden workplace was created whose members matched those of the household.\n\nThree significant populations in Madang were not counted in the 2001 census, namely those in settlements (unofficial housing areas found in other parts of the developing world), those in the University and Chinese workers at a mine/processing site on the edge of town. The field survey provided numbers resident in each of these locations: the two settlement areas in Madang with ~750 inhabitants each; ~3,000 students and staff living in hostels at the Divine Word University (a further ~280 live in households in town and appeared in the census); and ~650 overseas workers accommodated in hostels at the mine/processing site.\n\nTo model the settlements new households were created and individuals allocated to mixing hubs to match overall Madang demographics. The populations at the University and the mine-site had virtual households created to replicate friendship groups of average size 7, and these locations were also designated as the workplace for these individuals. Contact between the wider Madang population and those at the University involved local students and staff attending on weekdays while resident staff and student had community-wide contact. Contact between the minesite and the town was restricted to community contact.\n\nCensus data classified a significant proportion (16.2%) of adults as unemployed and do not attend a designated workplace [17] . Local knowledge indicated that these adults do have daytime contact with others outwith the home, such as working or visiting the two informal markets. To address this feature an additional daytime contact location was introduced, with unemployed adults in each census unit allocated to neighbourhood hubs of 10 individuals. This mechanism captures the mixing patterns of the large numbers of notionally unemployed in Madang and, together with background community contact, allows marketplace contact to be represented. These hubs also have 25% of all local school age pupils allocated to them, accounting for half of the 50% of school age children which do not attend school.\n\nThe introduction of neighbourhood hubs, which do not exist in the Albany model, give a model which the field survey and local knowledge indicates is representative of the contact patterns found in urban PNG. A Madang model which omits neighbourhood hubs, called Madang-nnh (no neighbourhood hubs), is also used in the simulation experiments and the resulting attack rates are presented in Table 1 . This allows influenza spread dynamics within the three models to be compared and indicates the sensitivity of the Madang model to the presence of neighbourhood hubs.\n\nThe number of individuals in each of the daytime locations for the Madang, Albany and Madang-nnh models is given in Table A1 in the Supplementary Data File. Additional information on the data used to construct the Madang model is given in [18] . To achieve simulations for a particular basic reproduction number R0, \u03b2 was adjusted; details of the procedure for estimating \u03b2 and R0 are given in [10] . A pandemic with a basic reproduction number of 1.5 is used in this study, and corresponds to some estimations of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [21] [22] [23] [24] and the 1957 and 1968 pandemics [25, 26] . Details of parameter settings used are given in Table  A2 in the Supplementary Data File.\n\nA simulation algorithm, realised in computer software, manipulates the underlying demographic model and captures both population mobility and the changing infectivity profile of each individual. The simulation algorithm captures the state of the whole population twice per day, a daytime point-in-time snapshot and an evening snapshot, with individuals (possibly) moving locations between successive day or night periods, such as household to school or workplace for the day phase, returning to home for the night period. Individuals come into contact with other individuals on a one-to-one basis in each location, with possible influenza transmission then occurring.\n\nIndividuals in each household and contact hub made contacts within a close-contact mixing group, taken to be the entire household or a subset of larger hubs, and also made additional non hub-based random community contacts. The individual-toindividual transmission probability in larger households was moderated by household size using data from a study by Cauchemez et al [27] . This reflects the assumed reduction in pairwise contact in households with greater than 3 members and is significant in the Madang context, where the average household size is 6.32 compared to 2.54 in Albany.\n\nUsing the contact, mobility and transmission features described above, stochastic simulations of influenza spread in Madang were conducted. One new infection per day was introduced into the population during the whole period of the simulations, and randomly allocated to a household. The simulation period was divided into 12 hour day/night periods and during each period a nominal location for each individual was determined. This took into consideration the cycle type (day/night, weekday/weekend), infection state of each individual and whether child supervision was needed to look after a child at home. Individuals occupying the same location during the same time period were assumed to come into potential infective contact. Details of the simulation procedure are presented in [10] . The effectiveness of social distancing interventions, such as school or workplace closure, may be quantified by comparing the passage of the influenza virus in the community with and without interventions activated, and presented as the reduction in the daily and cumulative illness attack rates. Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered as antiviral agents may only be available in limited quantities in a PNG setting, whilst a vaccination campaign would face significant delay, supply and delivery constraints. Two intervention strategies considered feasible in a PNG setting were examined. These were: school closure involving all schools, with home isolation of all affected children; and a more rigorous strategy involving school closure coupled with 50% reductions in community-wide contact, workplace participation, and contact in neighbourhood hubs.\n\nBoth Madang models, that is with and without neighbourhood hubs, were used to compare a pandemic in PNG with one occurring in Albany, Australia. Simulations were conducted involving: no interventions; only school closure applied; and rigorous social distancing, for each of the three models.\n\nGeneral comparative trends may be seen in Table 1 , where we compare the Madang and Albany models. For a pandemic in a developed country setting having a basic reproduction number R0 of 1.5 and an illness attack rate of 31.7%, the same pandemic characteristics applied in a PNG setting with no interventions activated resulted in higher rates of influenza transmission, with an attack rate of 46.6% and reproduction number R0 = 1.88, see Table 1 . Comparing the attack rates when interventions are activated, both intervention strategies (solely school closure and rigorous social distancing) are much less effective in a PNG setting compared to the Australian one. The mitigated illness attack rates in the PNG model are approximately 3 times higher than those in the Australian model with the interventions being 60% -70% less effective. Table 2 indicates where transmission resulting in illness occurred, showing a significantly higher number and proportion (see Table 1 ) of transmissions occurring in households, as opposed to other contact/transmission locations, in PNG compared to the Australian model. The average household size in the PNG model is 2.5 times larger than that in Albany and this had a significant impact on the overall infection rate, making it noticeably higher in the PNG model.\n\nWe also conducted experiments with the Madang-nnh model, where neighbourhood contact hubs were omitted, to contrast the transmission characteristics with and without these contact hubs. The results of these simulation experiments are included in Tables 1 and 2 . It should be noted that the Madang model with neighbourhood hubs included is believed to be more representative of population 10 mixing characteristics in PNG, following local knowledge. Neighbourhood hubs were introduced to reflect the known mixing patterns occurring with adults not working in designated workplaces, such as found in regular contact in marketplaces. The addition of such contact hubs increased individual-to-individual contacts and hence infection transmission opportunities, (see in Table 2 ) with approximately 2,000 additional symptomatic infections resulting, for all three (mitigated and nonmitigated) scenarios. In terms of cumulative illness attack rate, the Madang model gave a basic reproduction number R0 of 1.88 and an illness attack rate of 46.6%, compared to that of the no-hub Madang-nnh model with R0 = 1.74 and 40.8%. The daily case incidence resulting from simulating the Albany, Madang and Madang-nnh models is presented in Figure 2 for the three scenarios. \n\nNo intervention scenario From the results given in Table 1 there is an approximately 47% increase in the illness attack rate in the Madang setting compared to that of resulting from the Albany model; from 31.7% to 46.6%. If no neighbourhood hub contact occurs, as with the Madang-nnh model, there is still an increase in illness attack rate compared to that resulting from the Albany model, with an approximately 29% increase in the attack rate; from 31.7% to 40.8%.\n\nIt is apparent from Table 1 that there is a greater proportion of cases occurring within households in both Madang models compared to that of the Albany model (see Table 1 ). This arises from the average Madang household size being larger than in Albany. The number of cases occurring in Madang due to household transmission is ~8,000 compared to ~3,500 in Albany; note that Madang has a total population of ~35,000 compared to ~30,000 in Albany. School closure scenario The school closure intervention in the Madang model is found to be approximately five times less effective compared to that of the Albany model. Simulation results suggest a 9.4% reduction (46.6% to 42.2%) in the illness attack rate can be achieved in Madang due to school closure whereas a 48.6% reduction (31.7% to 16 .3%) can be achieved in Albany (see Table 1 ). For the no-hub Madang-nnh model, school closure is ~3.5 times less effective compared to the Albany model. Table 2 (middle panel) indicates an illness attack rate of ~15,000 in Madang compared to ~4,800 in Albany. Much higher case numbers occur in households, workplaces and the wider community (including neighbourhood hubs) than in Albany, highlighting the poorer efficacy of this intervention strategy in a PNG setting. The Madang-nnh model also has higher household and workplace transmission than in Albany. Note that while there is a significantly higher proportion of under 17 year old children in Madang (40%) compared to Albany (28%), our field survey indicates that 50% of school age children in Madang do not attend school, hence school closure is less effective in disrupting the transmission chain (household 1 / school / household 2) compared to Australia. This feature also is present in the rigorous social distancing intervention.\n\nPrevious simulation studies [10, 28, 29] show that rigorous social distancing interventions involving school closure coupled to contact reductions in other locations may be highly effective in reducing the attack rate. Comparing the effectiveness of rigorous social distancing between the Albany and the Madang models, an ~83% reduction (from 31.7% to 5.4%) reduction may be achieved in Albany whereas a smaller ~62.7% reduction (from 46.6%% to 17.4%), is achieved in the Madang model; see Table 1 . In the no-hub Madang-nnh model a ~69.4% reduction in the attack rate (40.8% to 12.5%) can be achieved by this rigorous social distancing intervention. These results suggest that both social distancing strategies are much less effective in a PNG setting compared to what might be achieved in a developed country. Figure 2 also reveals this clear trend, with peak case incidence and the area under the curves (the cumulative attack rate) being higher in both Madang models compared to the Albany model. \n\nThe sensitivity of key model parameters, such as school contact group size, illness withdrawal rates and intervention duration have been extensively examined for the Albany model [29, 30] . These indicate that while the model is sensitive to some parameter settings, the relative effectiveness of social distancing interventions remains unchanged, a feature also shared by the Madang models.\n\nThe major difference between the Albany and Madang models is the presence of neighbourhood hubs. We have included a Madang model which has no neighbourhood hubs (Madang-nnh), and present comparative results for all three models in Tables 1 and 2, Figure 2 and Table A3 , Supplementary Data File).\n\nCompliance with home isolation of school children following school closure has been examined and reduction from 100% to 50% considered. Reduced compliance increases the attack rate in Albany as those affected make additional daytime contacts with other children. In Madang, such compliance has minimal effect as ~50% of school age children do not attend school and continue to make daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs (see Table A4 , Supplementary Data File).\n\nIntroduction of a pandemic influenza strain with identical transmissibility characteristics results in a significantly higher infection and illness rate in a PNG setting when compared to that of a developed country. Social distancing intervention strategies suitable for a developing country may be significantly less effective in reducing the attack rate when compared to the outcomes expected in an Australian setting. Substantially more infections occurred in PNG households compared to that of the Australian model. The significantly larger size of households, a feature shared by many developing countries, together with higher community-wide contact in PNG, contributed to the higher infection rates.\n\nInterventions are less effective in a PNG setting since they are not targeted at household transmission, and given the larger household sizes, are applicable to a smaller proportion of transmission compared to the Australian scenario. In addition, as only half the school-age children in Madang attend school, the two school closure based interventions impact on many fewer individuals.\n\nWhile care was taken to obtain detailed data used to populate the Madang and Albany models, government data was found to be more limited in PNG. While a field data collection exercise was conducted in Madang to fill in missing data and make the models as directly comparable as possible, there is still scope for conducting further data collection. The lack of similar low-income modelling studies prevents comparison with related studies, and suggests that this is an area requiring further attention. Research studies expanding on that reported here suggest themselves: the construction and use of a number of additional PNG models capturing different population structures, such as rural villages and island communities; and the determination of health outcomes following a moderately severe influenza pandemic, taking into account co-morbidities with extant diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, diseases common to many low-income countries.\n\nWhile pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered due to cost and delivery issues in a low-income country setting, consideration may need to be given to some form of antiviral agent use, given the poor performance of purely social distancing interventions suggested by this study. This raises issues regarding how to optimise antiviral delivery and who would fund and manage such a program. If neuraminidase inhibitor antivirals were to be considered, care would need to be taken to understand how reduced efficacy compared to that provided by limited studies [31] [32] [33] might impact on the overall effectiveness and cost effectiveness of antiviral-based strategies. This antiviral efficacy issue is discussed in [34] and the consequences of lower efficacy in [35] .\n\nThe importance of suitable pandemic influenza preparedness plans for low-income countries is recognized by the WHO [4, 36] . Disease transmission models will play a role in guiding policy makers in determining the effectiveness of possible pandemic countermeasures. History tells us that low-income countries are likely to be more affected, yet almost all models deal with mitigation strategies for developed nations with good health infrastructure and low prevalence of endemic diseases. These countries have poorer access to antiviral drug and vaccine-based interventions and higher extant disease burdens, compared to developed countries. For the reasons, development of appropriate intervention strategies focused on countries such as PNG needs to occur. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 The baseline assumption in the main results is that individuals in neighbourhood hubs mix with 10 other individuals. If this value is alternatively assumed to be 20 or 30 individuals, additional contacts gives increased transmission and results in higher final attack rates. Compliance with home isolation of school children following school closure intervention has been examined and compliance reduction from 100% to 50% considered. Effects of the compliances on the illness attack rates have been presented in Table A4 . For the purely school closure intervention, illness attack rate increases by ~3% in Albany as reduced isolation permits additional childto-child contact. In the Madang models, reduced compliance with home isolation during the period of school closure has minimal effect on the attack rate as ~50% school age children do not attend school. In all three models, reduced compliance has minimal effect if rigorous social distancing intervention is applied. \n\nEach individual has their influenza infection history modelled using the classical SEIR approach 5 and are in one of 4 infection states, namely susceptible (that is, uninfected), exposed (infected but not infectious), infectious, or recovered and thus immune. The passage of infection in each individual reflects the known time-changing infectiousness profile (that is, virus shedding) of influenza at two discrete points-of-time every 24 hours, namely a daytime and a nighttime period.\n\nDisease transmission is realised using a probabilistic transmission function, implemented by the simulation algorithm. Together with mobility data, the transmission function captures disease spread throughout the modelled community and may be adjusted to reflect pandemics with various transmission characteristics, corresponding to the basic reproduction number R0 of a particular influenza strain.\n\nIt is assumed that infectious transmission may occur when an infectious and susceptible individual came into contact during a simulation cycle. Following each contact a new infection state for the susceptible individual (either to remain susceptible or to become infected) will be randomly selected via a Bernoulli trial. Once infected, an individual progressed through a series of infection states according to a fixed timeline, taking then from a susceptible state, to an exposed state, to an infectious state and thence to an immune, recovered state. 5 The probability that an infectious individual would infect a susceptible individual was calculated using the following transmission function, which takes into account the disease infectivity of the infectious individual Ii and the susceptibility of susceptible individual Is , at the time of contact.\n\nThe factors which determine probability of transmission from an infectious individual (Ii) to a susceptible individual (Is) are the basic virus transmissibility (\u03b2v), the age-based susceptibility of Is the current level of infectiousness of Ii, and, if the contact between Ii and Is occurs in a household, the household size Household(Ii, Is). These factors are explained below.\n\nThe transmission coefficient \u03b2 was initially chosen to give an epidemic with a final attack rate of 17.4% which is consistent with seasonal influenza as estimated in Table 3 of 6 . To achieve simulations for a particular basic reproduction number, \u03b2 was increased from this baseline value; details of the procedure for estimating \u03b2 and R0 are given in 7 . A pandemic with a basic reproduction number of 1.5, and which has been used in this study, corresponds to some estimations of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [8] [9] [10] [11] and the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. 12 13 The susceptibility parameter Susc(Is) is a function which may be dependent on the age of the susceptible individual, to capture age-varying susceptibility to transmission. This age variance may be due to either partial prior immunity, as thought to have occurred in the 2009 pandemic, or age-related differences in contact behaviour. In the work reported here a flat, non age-varying susceptibility was used to reflect a novel pandemic strain where none of the population has any prior immunity, as would be the case if H5N1 becomes human transmissible.\n\nThe disease infectivity parameter Inf(Ii) was set to 1 for symptomatic individuals at the peak period of infection and then to 0.5 for the rest of the infectivity period The infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals is also assumed to be 0.5 and this applies to all infected individuals after the latent period but before onset of symptoms. The infection profile of a symptomatic individual was assumed to last for 6 days as follows: a 0.5 day latent period (with Inf(Ii) set to 0) is followed by 1 day asymptomatic and infectious, where Inf(Ii) is set to 0.5; then 2 days at peak infectiousness (with Inf(Ii) set to 1.0); followed by 2.5 days reduced infectiousness (with Inf(Ii)set to 0.5). For an infected but asymptomatic individual the whole infectious period (of 5.5 days) is at the reduced level of infectiousness with Inf(Ii) set to 0.5. This infectivity profile is a simplification of the infectivity distribution found in a study of viral shedding 1 .\n\nFollowing infection an individual is assumed to be immune to re-infection for the duration of the simulation. We further assume that influenza symptoms develop one day into the infectious period 1 , with 20% of infections being asymptomatic among children and 32% being asymptomatic among adults using data from 2 . Symptomatic individuals will withdraw into the home with the following probabilities; adults 50% and children 90%, which is consistent with 14 15 .\n\nThe individual-to-individual transmission probability in larger households was moderated by the household size factor Household(Ii, Is), using data from a study by Cauchemez et al 16 . This reflects the assumed reduction in pairwise contact in households with greater than 3 members, and is significant in the Madang context where the average household size is 6.32 compared to 2.54 in Albany. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\nObjectives The possible occurrence of a highly pathogenic influenza strain is of concern to health authorities worldwide. It is known that during past influenza pandemics developing countries have experienced considerably higher mortality rates compared to developed countries. Furthermore, many developing countries lack appropriate pandemic preparedness plans. Mathematical modelling studies to guide the development of such plans are largely focused on predicting pandemic influenza spread in developed nations. However, intervention strategies shown by modelling studies to be highly effective for developed countries give limited guidance as to the impact which an influenza pandemic may have on low-income countries given different demographics and resource constraints. To address this, an individual-based model of a Papua New Guinean community was created and used to simulate the spread of a novel influenza strain. The results were compared to those obtained from a comparable Australian model.\n\nDesign A modelling study.\n\nSetting The towns of Madang in Papua New Guinea (population ~35,000) and Albany (population ~30,000) in Australia.\n\nOutcome measures Daily and cumulative illness attack rates in both models following introduction of a novel influenza strain into a naive population, for an unmitigated scenario and two social distancing intervention scenarios.\n\nThe unmitigated scenario indicated an approximately 50% higher attack rate in PNG compared to the Australian model. The two social distancing-based interventions strategies were 60% -70% less effective in a PNG setting compared to an Australian setting.\n\nConclusions This study provides further evidence that an influenza pandemic occurring in a low-income country such as PNG may have a greater impact than one occurring in a developed country, and that PNG-feasible interventions may be substantially less effective. The larger average household size in PNG, the larger proportion of the population under 18 and greater community-wide contact all contribute to this feature. Strength and limitations of this study The findings are a first step in understanding how an influenza pandemic will impact on a low-income country.\n\nAs with all modelling studies obtaining high-quality field data with which to \"populate\" models is crucial and accessing such data in countries such as PNG is a challenge. These results and those from future research will permit better pandemic planning and allow intervention strategies to be tailored to the specific demographics and resource constraints found in developing countries. [1] and the possible occurrence of a highly pathogenic virus strain is of concern to health authorities worldwide.\n\nIt has been shown under laboratory conditions that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza strain may re-assort or mutate to become readily transmissible between humans. [2] In response to the threat of influenza pandemics, most countries have developed pandemic preparedness plans. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] . However the level of completeness of these plans with regards to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [9] varies dramatically between developed high income countries and developing, low-income countries. [7, 8] Low-income countries suffer the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from influenza pandemics. Data from the 1918/19 pandemic suggests much higher mortality rates in India compared to Europe and the USA. While in northern Europe and the USA mortality rates were consistently below 1%, over 4.3% average mortality was reported from India, with some Indian provinces exceeding mortality rates of 7%. [10, 11] Even in the mild H1N1 pandemic of 2009, 59% of the estimated 284,500 deaths occurred in Africa and South-East Asia. [2] These differences are most likely due to the significant association of influenza mortality with comorbidities usually absent in the developed countries (such as chronic malnutrition, malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia and HIV). [12] Furthermore it has been shown that the increased mortality rate due to an influenza pandemic is strongly associated with per capita income. [11] It is apparent that the burden of the next pandemic will also be focused overwhelmingly on the developing world, a point made by the WHO and others. [5, 11, 13, 14, 15] A substantial number of pandemic influenza models have been constructed in the past decade. A key goal of this effort is to determine the effectiveness of interventions, in terms of their ability to reduce infection and consequential mortality rates. Although it has been recognized that the major burden of mortality from influenza pandemics is suffered by low-income countries [5, 11, 16] the primary focus of the vast majority of these models is on examining intervention effectiveness in developed (e.g., the USA and European countries [17, 18, 19, 20] ) and middle income countries (e.g., Thailand [21, 22] ). Given the markedly different demographic and community structure, as well as resource and infrastructural constraints in comparison with developed countries, these models have limited capability to predict the impact of an influenza pandemic on low-income countries [23] . In addition, many low-income countries are located in tropical or subtropical regions where the timing and impact of influenza epidemics are more poorly understood than in temperate regions, where they are known to have a well-defined winter season. [15] To address this 'modelling gap' an individual-based disease transmission model of pandemic influenza has been developed for Papua New Guinea (PNG), based on the methods used previously to develop a pandemic influenza model of Albany, Western The model was used to describe the spread of a novel influenza strain after introduction into the community. The resulting illness attack rate was determined together with data indicating where person-to-person transmission occurred. An unmitigated outbreak and two outbreaks with PNG-feasible intervention strategies activated were simulated and the results compared to those obtained using the Albany, Australia model.\n\nCensus and country-wide data from the PNG National Statistics Office [27] together with data collected in a field survey in Madang were used to construct the Madang model. Following the methodology used to construct the Albany model, each household is explicitly represented, with occupants in one of 7 age categories. Schools, workplace and other mixing hubs were also explicitly represented. Individuals were allocated to these mixing hubs according to their age category, so connecting households and hubs as shown in Figure 1 . Using virus intrinsic transmission characteristics calibrated with the Australian model, simulations were performed using the Madang model. These simulations captured the day-to-day susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered/immune infection profile of the population following introduction of a novel strain of influenza into the modelled community, assuming no existing immunity. [28] \n\nMadang model development used the most recent census data from 2001, other PNG government data and additional data collected in our field survey. [17] Census data provided the location groups of approximately 50 adjacent households, known as the census unit (CU). The specific demographics of each household in Madang in terms of number of individuals, their ages and occupation of adults was also provided by the census and each individual is uniquely identified in the model.\n\nFrom July to September 2011 we also conducted a survey in Madang to obtain data on the number of people working in smaller workplaces, school class sizes, market sizes, and the number of people attending the major tertiary education centres in Madang (Divine Word University (DWU), Madang Teachers College, Madang Technical College and Madang Maritime College). We asked the headmasters of schools and colleges, the human resource department at DWU and business owners of small to medium scale businesses about the respective numbers and, if no records existed relied on their estimates. We also obtained estimates on the size of informal These data allowed for the construction of an explicit contact network linking households, schools, workplaces and other meeting places by allocating individuals to workplaces and schools, as with the Albany model [10] .\n\nThe model captures explicit person-to-person contact with the contact network describing population mobility occurring between households, schools, workplaces and the wider community as shown in Figure 1 . The virus spreads through the community due to this mobility, as transmission occurs between individuals when they are co-located, possibly following a move from one location to another.\n\nThe number of contacts made by each individual each day in school, work and community settings were adjusted to reproduce the proportion of cases occurring in different settings as reported by empirical studies, specifically 40% of infections occurred in households, 30% in schools and workplaces, and 30% in the wider community. [29, 30, 31] Contacts within schools and workplaces occurred in fixedsize mixing groups of maximum size 10. Within mixing groups contact was assumed to be homogeneous. Community contacts occurred between randomly selected individuals, weighted toward pairs of individuals located in neighbouring households.\n\nEach household contains uniquely identified individuals. Children and adults are assigned by an allocation algorithm to school classes and workplaces according to age based on class sizes and employee numbers obtained in the field survey. The field survey described above revealed that 50% of school-age children do not attend school, and this percentage is thought to be similar to most urban areas in PNG, with still lower rates in rural areas. Of those children not attending school 50% are allocated to neighbourhood hubs, as described below. In addition to contact occurring in households and mixing hubs, community contact is introduced to capture mixing which occurs outwith these locales and in the wider community. The community contact occurs at a fixed rate, similarly to the Albany model.\n\nCensus data provided the occupation/activity of individuals, namely 'wage-job', 'garden', 'business' and 'unemployed'. This was used to locate individuals denoted as wage-job with known workplaces. The numbers in this census category exceeded those found in the survey of major workplaces and knowledge of Madang suggested the creation of small, local workplaces to locate these additional adults and those in the business category. Adults with garden as their occupation work in family-owned gardens, subsistence farming and generating produce for sale. For each household containing a garden worker, a garden workplace was created whose members matched those of the household.\n\nThree significant populations in Madang were not counted in the 2001 census, namely those in settlements (unofficial housing areas also found in other parts of the developing world), those in the University and Chinese workers at a mine/processing site on the edge of town. The field survey provided numbers resident in each of these locations: the two settlement areas in Madang with ~750 inhabitants each; ~3,000 students and staff living in hostels at the Divine Word University (a further ~280 live in households in town and appeared in the census); and ~650 overseas workers accommodated in hostels at the mine/processing site.\n\nTo model the settlements new households were created and individuals allocated to mixing hubs to match overall Madang demographics. The populations at the University and the mine-site had virtual households created to replicate friendship groups of average size 7, and these locations were also designated as the workplace for these individuals. Contact between the wider Madang population and those at the University involved household and neighbourhood contacts for local students and staff living in town while resident staff and students were restricted to community contact. Contact between the mine-site and the town was also restricted to community contact.\n\nCensus data classified a significant proportion (16.2%) of adults as unemployed and not attending a designated workplace [27] . Knowledge gathered from the field survey in Madang indicated that these adults do have daytime contact with others outwith the home, such as working or visiting the two informal markets. To address this feature an additional daytime contact location (neighbourhood hubs) was introduced, with unemployed adults in each census unit allocated to neighbourhood hubs of 10 individuals. In addition, these hubs also have 25% of all local school age pupils allocated to them, accounting for half of the 50% of school age children which do not attend school.\n\nThe introduction of neighbourhood hubs, which do not exist in the Albany model, give a model which the field survey and local knowledge indicates is representative of the contact patterns found in urban PNG. A Madang model which omits neighbourhood hubs, called Madang-nnh (no neighbourhood hubs), is also used in the simulation experiments and the resulting attack rates are presented in Table 1 . This allows influenza spread dynamics within the three models to be compared and indicates the sensitivity of the Madang model to the presence of the neighbourhood hubs.\n\nThe numbers of individuals in each of the daytime locations for the Albany, Madang and Madang-nnh models are presented in Table A1 in the Supplementary Data File. Additional information on the data used to construct the Madang model is given in [32] . \n\nEach individual has their influenza infection history modelled using an SEIR approach and are in one of 4 infection states, namely susceptible, exposed, infectious, or recovered and thus immune [28] . The passage of infection in each individual reflects the known time-changing infectiousness profile (that is, virus shedding [33] ) of influenza at two discrete points-of-time every 24 hours, during a day-time and a night-time period.\n\nDisease transmission is realised using a probabilistic transmission function, implemented by the simulation algorithm. Together with mobility data, the transmission function captures disease spread throughout the modelled community and may be adjusted to reflect pandemics with various transmission characteristics, corresponding to the basic reproduction number R0 of a particular influenza strain, as discussed further in [20, 24, 25] .\n\nIt is assumed that infection transmission may occur when an infectious and a susceptible individual come into contact, in a stochastic fashion. Once infected, an individual progresses through a series of infection states according to a fixed timeline, taking them from susceptible, to exposed state, to infectious and then to an immune, recovered state [28] .\n\nThe probability that an infectious individual infects a susceptible was calculated using the following function.\n\nThe factors which determine probability of transmission from an infectious individual (Ii) to a susceptible individual (Is) are the basic virus transmissibility (\u03b2v), the age-based susceptibility of Is the current level of infectiousness of Ii, and, if the contact between Ii and Is occurs in a household, the household size Household(Ii, Is). These factors are explained in detail in the Supplementary Data File.\n\nTo achieve simulations for a particular basic reproduction number R0, \u03b2v was adjusted; details of the procedure for estimating \u03b2v and R0 are given in [20] . A pandemic with a basic reproduction number of 1.5 is used in this study, and corresponds to some estimations of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [34, 35, 36, 37] and the 1957 and 1968 pandemics [38, 39] . Since it is virus intrinsic, we assumed that \u03b2v was similar in Madang and thus calculated R0 in the Madang and Madang-nnh models using the \u03b2v corresponding to an R0 of 1.5 in the Albany model. Details of parameter settings used in each model are given in Table A2 in the Supplementary Data File. A simulation algorithm, realised in the C++ programming language, manipulates the underlying demographic model and captures both population mobility and the timechanging infectivity profile of each individual. Each individual has their infectivity status denoted by one of the four (S,E,I,R) states at any time point during the duration of the simulated period. The simulation algorithm captures the state of the whole population twice per day, a daytime point-in-time snapshot and an evening snapshot, with individuals (possibly) moving locations between successive day or night periods, such as household to school or workplace for the day phase, returning to home for the night period. Individuals come into contact with other individuals on a one-to-one basis in each location, with possible influenza transmission then occurring.\n\nIndividuals in each household and contact hub make contacts within a close-contact mixing group, taken to be the entire household or a subset of larger hubs, and also make additional non hub-based random community contacts. The individual-toindividual transmission probability in larger households was moderated by household size using data from a study by Cauchemez et al [40] . This reflects the assumed reduction in pairwise contact in households with greater than 3 members and is significant in the Madang context, where the average household size is 6.32 compared to 2.54 in Albany.\n\nUsing the contact, mobility and transmission features described above, stochastic simulations of influenza spread in Madang were conducted. All simulations were repeated 40 times with random numbers controlling the outcome of stochastic events (the locality of seeded infected individuals and the probability of transmission) and the results were averaged. Analysis of this simulation model has shown that the 40-run mean attack rate is highly unlikely (95% confidence) to differ by more than 1.2% from the mean attack rate of a much larger set of experiment repeats.\n\nOne new infection per day was introduced into the population during the whole period of the simulations, and randomly allocated to a household. This seeding assumption of 1 case per day was chosen to reliably begin a local epidemic in every stochastic simulation. For the transmission characteristics described above, analysis shows that seeding at this rate for 7 days results in a sustained epidemic in >97% of the simulation runs and 100% with two weeks of seeding, with higher percentages for the higher transmissibility scenarios. Seeding at this rate is continued throughout the simulation in order to capture the case where an epidemic may be initially suppressed by a rigorous intervention strategy, but may subsequently break out if intervention measures are relaxed.\n\nAfter the beginning of a sustained local epidemic, any subsequent variation in the amount of seeding has very little effect on the progress of the local epidemic, as the number of imported cases is much smaller than those generated by the local epidemic. Preliminary analyses using the present model have shown that even if the seeding rate is increased to 5 infections per day, after 7 days the number of infections generated from the self-sustained local epidemic is twice the number of imported infections, and by 14 days local infections outnumber imported infections by a factor of 8.\n\nThe simulation period was divided into 12 hour day/night periods and during each period a nominal location for each individual was determined. This took into consideration the cycle type (day/night, weekday/weekend), infection state of each individual and whether child supervision was needed to look after a child at home. Individuals occupying the same location during the same time period were assumed to come into potential infective contact. Details of the simulation procedure are presented in [20] .\n\nThe effectiveness of social distancing interventions, such as school or workplace closure, may be quantified by comparing the passage of the influenza virus in the community with and without interventions activated, and presented as the reduction in the daily and cumulative illness attack rates. Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered as antiviral agents may only be available in limited quantities in a PNG setting, whilst a vaccination campaign would face significant delay, supply and delivery constraints. Two intervention strategies considered feasible in a PNG setting were examined. These were: school closure involving all schools, with home isolation of all affected children; and a more rigorous strategy involving school closure coupled with 50% reductions in community-wide contact, workplace participation, and contact in neighbourhood hubs.\n\nBoth Madang models, (with and without neighbourhood hubs), were used to compare a pandemic in PNG with one occurring in Albany, Australia. Simulations were conducted involving: no interventions; only school closure applied; and rigorous social distancing, for each of the three models.\n\nGeneral comparative trends are presented in Table 1 , were the Albany and Madang models are compared. For a pandemic in a developed country setting having a basic reproduction number R0 of 1.5 and an illness attack rate of 31.7%, the same pandemic characteristics applied in a PNG setting with no interventions activated resulted in higher rates of influenza transmission, with an attack rate of 46.6% and reproduction number R0 = 1.88 (Table 1) . Comparing the attack rates when interventions were activated, both intervention strategies (solely school closure and rigorous social distancing) were much less effective in the PNG setting compared to the Australian one. The mitigated illness attack rates in the PNG model were approximately 3 times higher than those in the Australian model with the interventions being 60% -70% less effective. Table 2 indicates where transmission that resulted in illness occurred, showing a significantly higher number and proportion of transmissions occurring in households, as opposed to other contact/transmission locations, in the Madang compared to the Australian model ( Table 1 ). The average household size in the PNG model is 2.5 times larger than that in Albany and this had a significant impact on the overall infection rate, making it noticeably higher in the PNG model.\n\nWe also conducted experiments with the Madang-nnh model, where neighbourhood contact hubs were omitted, to contrast the transmission characteristics with and without these contact hubs. The results of these simulation experiments are included in Tables 1 and 2 . It should be noted that the Madang model with neighbourhood hubs included is believed to be more representative of population mixing characteristics in PNG, following local knowledge. Neighbourhood hubs were introduced to reflect the known mixing patterns occurring with adults not working in designated workplaces, such as found in the regular contact which may occur among individuals in marketplaces. The addition of such contact hubs increased individual-to-individual contacts and hence infection transmission opportunities (see Table 2 ) with approximately 2,000 additional symptomatic infections resulting, for all three (mitigated and non-mitigated) scenarios. In terms of cumulative illness attack rate, the Madang model gave a basic reproduction number R0 of 1.88 and an illness attack rate of 46.6%, compared to that of the Madang-nnh (no neighbourhood hub) model with R0 = 1.74 and an illness attack rate of 40.8%. The daily case incidence resulting from simulating the Albany, Madang and Madang-nnh models is presented in Figure 2 for the three scenarios. \n\nThe results given in Table 1 show that there is an approximately 47% increase in the illness attack rate in the Madang setting compared to that resulting from the Albany model; from 31.7% to 46.6%. If no neighbourhood hub contact occurs, as with the Madang-nnh model, there is still an increase in illness attack rate compared to that resulting from the Albany model, with an approximately 29% increase in the attack rate; from 31.7% to 40.8%.\n\nIt is apparent from the results presented in Table 1 that there is a greater proportion of influenza cases occurring within households in both Madang models note that Madang has a total population of ~35,000 compared to ~30,000 in Albany.\n\nThe school closure intervention in the Madang model is found to be approximately 5 times less effective compared to that of the Albany model. Simulation results suggest a 9.4% reduction (46.6% to 42.2%) in the illness attack rate can be achieved in Madang due to school closure whereas a 48.6% reduction (31.7% to 16.3%) can be achieved in Albany (see Table 1 ). For the Madang-nnh (no neighbourhood hub) model, school closure is approximately 3.5 times less effective compared to the Albany model. workplaces and the wider community (including neighbourhood hubs) than in Albany, highlighting the poorer efficacy of this intervention strategy in a PNG setting. The Madang-nnh model also results in higher household and workplace transmission than the Albany model. Note that while there is a significantly higher proportion of under 17 year old children in Madang (40%) compared to Albany (28%), our field survey indicates that 50% of school age children in Madang do not attend school, hence school closure is less effective in disrupting the transmission chain (i.e., household 1-to-school-to-household 2) compared to Australia. This feature is also present in the rigorous social distancing intervention.\n\nPrevious simulation studies [20, 41, 42] show that rigorous social distancing interventions involving school closure coupled to contact reductions in other locations may be highly effective in reducing the attack rate within a developed country setting. Comparing the effectiveness of rigorous social distancing between the Albany and Madang models, an ~83% reduction (from 31.7% to 5.4%) reduction may be achieved in Albany whereas a smaller ~62.7% reduction (from 46.6%% to 17.4%), is achieved in the Madang model; see Table 1 . In the Madangnnh model a ~69.4% reduction in the attack rate (40.8% to 12.5%) can be achieved by this rigorous social distancing intervention. These results suggest that both social distancing strategies are much less effective in a PNG setting compared to what might be achieved in a developed country. Figure 2 also reveals this clear trend, with peak case incidence and the area under the curves (the attack rate) being higher in both Madang models compared to the Albany model.\n\nThe sensitivity of key model parameters, such as school contact group size, illness withdrawal rates and intervention duration have been extensively examined for the Albany model [42, 43] . These indicate that while the model is sensitive to some parameter settings, the relative effectiveness of social distancing interventions remains unchanged, a feature also shared by the Madang models.\n\nThe major difference between the Albany and Madang models is the presence of neighbourhood hubs. We have included a Madang model which has no neighbourhood hubs (Madang-nnh), and present comparative results for all three models in Tables 1 and 2, Figure 2 and Tables A3-A6 (Supplementary Data File).\n\nSimulations comparing neighbourhood mixing group sizes 10 (baseline), 20 and 30 indicate that for hubs of size 20 and 30, the increased transmission results in higher attack rates, as expected (see Table A3 , Supplementary Data File).\n\nThe effect of varying compliance with home isolation of school children following school closure on attack rate was examined. Compliance was reduced from 100% to 50%. Reduced compliance increased the attack rate in Albany as those children affected made additional daytime contacts with other children. In Madang, the reduction in compliance had only minimal effect since approximately 50% of school age children do not attend school and continue to make daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs (see Table A4 , Supplementary Data File).\n\nThe effect of using different probabilities of voluntary withdrawal to the home of symptomatic adults and children is presented in Table A5 . Lower rates of voluntary withdrawal lead to higher attack rates in all three models. Voluntary withdrawal from work or school has a more pronounced effect in the Albany model, as a significant proportion of children in Madang still transmit through daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs.\n\nThe effects of variation of the timing of intervention initiation are presented in Table  A6 . In the school closure scenario, delayed response had the most severe impact on the attack rates in Albany, whereas for the Madang models the changes in attack rate were marginal. This is again due to a large fraction of children not attending school and the existence of neighbourhood hubs. Similarly, in the rigorous contact reduction scenario the effect of delayed response on attack rate was more \n\nIntroduction of a pandemic influenza strain with identical transmissibility characteristics results in a significantly higher infection and illness rate in a PNG setting when compared to that of a developed country. Social distancing intervention strategies suitable for a developing country may be significantly less effective in reducing the attack rate when compared to the outcomes expected in an Australian setting. Substantially more infections occurred in PNG households compared to that of the Australian model. The significantly larger size of households, a feature shared by many developing countries, together with higher community-wide contact in PNG, contributed to the higher infection rates.\n\nInterventions are less effective in a PNG setting since they are not targeted at household transmission, and given the larger household sizes, are applicable to a smaller proportion of transmissions compared to the Australian scenario. In addition, as only half the school-age children in Madang attend school, the two school closure based interventions impact on many fewer individuals.\n\nWhile care was taken to obtain detailed data used to populate the Madang and Albany models, government data was found to be more limited in PNG. While a field survey was conducted in Madang to fill in missing data and make the models as directly comparable as possible, there is still scope for conducting further data collection. The lack of similar low-income modelling studies prevents comparison with related studies, and suggests that this is an area requiring further attention.\n\nResearch studies expanding on that reported here suggest themselves: the construction and use of a number of additional PNG models capturing different population structures, such as rural villages and island communities; and the determination of health outcomes following a moderately severe influenza pandemic, taking into account co-morbidities with extant diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, diseases common to many low-income countries.\n\nThe interventions used in the present study are based on social distancing. Surveys have shown that a higher proportion of low-income countries have social distancing interventions planned in the case of a pandemic, compared to high income European countries due to their feasibility and cost-effectiveness. Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered in this study due to cost and delivery issues found with low-income countries. [4, 8] Consideration may need to be given to some form of antiviral agent use, possibly for case treatment, given the poor performance of purely social distancing interventions in developing countries as suggested by this study. The advantage of antiviral use is that it may be targeted at reducing within-household transmission, a location of transmission otherwise not impacted by social distancing interventions. The present study shows that larger numbers of transmissions occur within households due to the larger household sizes in countries such as PNG. Furthermore, low-income countries generally have population health profiles not seen in developed countries, including the prevalence of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. [44] Antiviral treatment of influenza cases co-infected with such diseases may be an appropriate intervention strategy given the poorer health outcomes which co-morbidity may impose. [12] The provision and use of antiviral agents will have challenges not faced by industrialised countries, due to the cost of providing an antiviral stockpile and subsequent distribution of antivirals in countries which have health systems already stretched to capacity. [15] The importance of suitable pandemic influenza preparedness plans for low-income countries is recognized by the WHO [45, 46] . Disease transmission models will play a role in guiding policy makers in determining the effectiveness of possible pandemic countermeasures. History tells us that low-income countries are likely to be more affected, yet almost all models deal with mitigation strategies for developed nations with good health infrastructure and low prevalence of endemic diseases. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Daily case incidence for the no intervention, school closure and rigorous social distancing (school closure and workplace and community contact reductions) scenarios is shown. The blue, red and green curves represent the Albany, Madang and Madang-nnh models respectively. \n\nObjectives The possible occurrence of a highly pathogenic influenza strain is of concern to health authorities worldwide. It is known that during past influenza pandemics developing countries have experienced considerably higher mortality rates compared to developed countries. Furthermore, many developing countries lack appropriate pandemic preparedness plans. Mathematical modelling studies to guide the development of such plans are largely focused on predicting pandemic influenza spread in developed nations. However, intervention strategies shown by modelling studies to be highly effective for developed countries give limited guidance as to the impact which an influenza pandemic may have on low-income countries given different demographics and resource constraints. To address this, an individual-based model of a Papua New Guinean community was created and used to simulate the spread of a novel influenza strain. The results were compared to those obtained from a comparable Australian model.\n\nDesign A modelling study.\n\nSetting The towns of Madang in Papua New Guinea (population ~35,000) and Albany (population ~30,000) in Australia.\n\nOutcome measures Daily and cumulative illness attack rates in both models following introduction of a novel influenza strain into a naive population, for an unmitigated scenario and two social distancing intervention scenarios.\n\nThe unmitigated scenario indicated an approximately 50% higher attack rate in PNG compared to the Australian model. The two social distancing-based interventions strategies were 60% -70% less effective in a PNG setting compared to an Australian setting.\n\nConclusions This study provides further evidence that an influenza pandemic occurring in a low-income country such as PNG may have a greater impact than one occurring in a developed country, and that PNG-feasible interventions may be substantially less effective. The larger average household size in PNG, the larger proportion of the population under 18 and greater community-wide contact all contribute to this feature. Strength and limitations of this study The findings are a first step in understanding how an influenza pandemic will impact on a low-income country.\n\nAs with all modelling studies obtaining high-quality field data with which to \"populate\" models is crucial and accessing such data in countries such as PNG is a challenge. These results and those from future research will permit better pandemic planning and allow intervention strategies to be tailored to the specific demographics and resource constraints found in developing countries. [1] and the possible occurrence of a highly pathogenic virus strain is of concern to health authorities worldwide.\n\nIt has been shown under laboratory conditions that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza strain may re-assort or mutate to become readily transmissible between humans. [2] In response to the threat of influenza pandemics, most countries have developed pandemic preparedness plans. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] . However the level of completeness of these plans with regards to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [9] varies dramatically between developed high income countries and developing, low-income countries. [7, 8] Low-income countries suffer the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from influenza pandemics. Data from the 1918/19 pandemic suggests much higher mortality rates in India compared to Europe and the USA. While in northern Europe and the USA mortality rates were consistently below 1%, over 4.3% average mortality was reported from India, with some Indian provinces exceeding mortality rates of 7%. [10, 11] Even in the mild H1N1 pandemic of 2009, 59% of the estimated 284,500 deaths occurred in Africa and South-East Asia. [2] These differences are most likely due to the significant association of influenza mortality with comorbidities usually absent in the developed countries (such as chronic malnutrition, malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia and HIV). [12] Furthermore it has been shown that the increased mortality rate due to an influenza pandemic is strongly associated with per capita income. [11] It is apparent that the burden of the next pandemic will also be focused overwhelmingly on the developing world, a point made by the WHO and others. [5, 11, 13, 14, 15] A substantial number of pandemic influenza models have been constructed in the past decade. A key goal of this effort is to determine the effectiveness of interventions, in terms of their ability to reduce infection and consequential mortality rates. Although it has been recognized that the major burden of mortality from influenza pandemics is suffered by low-income countries [5, 11, 16] the primary focus of the vast majority of these models is on examining intervention effectiveness in developed (e.g., the USA and European countries [17, 18, 19, 20] ) and middle income countries (e.g., Thailand [21, 22] ). Given the markedly different demographic and community structure, as well as resource and infrastructural constraints in comparison with developed countries, these models have limited capability to predict the impact of an influenza pandemic on low-income countries [23] . In addition, many low-income countries are located in tropical or subtropical regions where the timing and impact of influenza epidemics are more poorly understood than in temperate regions, where they are known to have a well-defined winter season. [15] To address this 'modelling gap' an individual-based disease transmission model of pandemic influenza has been developed for Papua New Guinea (PNG), based on the methods used previously to develop a pandemic influenza model of Albany, Western Australia [20, 24, 25] . The chosen location of Madang, a town of approximately 35,000 on the northern coast of the island of New Guinea has, along with all of PNG, different demographics and individual-to-individual contact patterns compared to those in developed countries. Papua New Guinea has an annual per capita income of about $US 2500,-and is thus at a similar level of development as many African nations. [26] The model was used to describe the spread of a novel influenza strain after introduction into the community. The resulting illness attack rate was determined together with data indicating where person-to-person transmission occurred. An unmitigated outbreak and two outbreaks with PNG-feasible intervention strategies activated were simulated and the results compared to those obtained using the Albany, Australia model.\n\nCensus and country-wide data from the PNG National Statistics Office [27] together with data collected in a field survey in Madang were used to construct the Madang model. Following the methodology used to construct the Albany model, each household is explicitly represented, with occupants in one of 7 age categories. Schools, workplace and other mixing hubs were also explicitly represented. Individuals were allocated to these mixing hubs according to their age category, so connecting households and hubs as shown in Figure 1 . Using virus intrinsic transmission characteristics calibrated with the Australian model, simulations were performed using the Madang model. These simulations captured the day-to-day susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered/immune infection profile of the population following introduction of a novel strain of influenza into the modelled community, assuming no existing immunity. [28] Madang Demographics\n\nMadang model development used the most recent census data from 2001, other PNG government data and additional data collected in our field survey. [17] Census data provided the location groups of approximately 50 adjacent households, known as the census unit (CU). The specific demographics of each household in Madang in terms of number of individuals, their ages and occupation of adults was also provided by the census and each individual is uniquely identified in the model.\n\nFrom July to September 2011 we also conducted a survey in Madang to obtain data on the number of people working in smaller workplaces, school class sizes, market sizes, and the number of people attending the major tertiary education centres in Madang (Divine Word University (DWU), Madang Teachers College, Madang Technical College and Madang Maritime College). We asked the headmasters of schools and colleges, the human resource department at DWU and business owners of small to medium scale businesses about the respective numbers and, if no records existed relied on their estimates. We also obtained estimates on the size of informal These data allowed for the construction of an explicit contact network linking households, schools, workplaces and other meeting places by allocating individuals to workplaces and schools, as with the Albany model [10] .\n\nThe model captures explicit person-to-person contact with the contact network describing population mobility occurring between households, schools, workplaces and the wider community as shown in Figure 1 . The virus spreads through the community due to this mobility, as transmission occurs between individuals when they are co-located, possibly following a move from one location to another.\n\nThe number of contacts made by each individual each day in school, work and community settings were adjusted to reproduce the proportion of cases occurring in different settings as reported by empirical studies, specifically 40% of infections occurred in households, 30% in schools and workplaces, and 30% in the wider community. [29, 30, 31] Contacts within schools and workplaces occurred in fixedsize mixing groups of maximum size 10. Within mixing groups contact was assumed to be homogeneous. Community contacts occurred between randomly selected individuals, weighted toward pairs of individuals located in neighbouring households.\n\nEach household contains uniquely identified individuals. Children and adults are assigned by an allocation algorithm to school classes and workplaces according to age based on class sizes and employee numbers obtained in the field survey. The field survey described above revealed that 50% of school-age children do not attend school, and this percentage is thought to be similar to most urban areas in PNG, with still lower rates in rural areas. Of those children not attending school 50% are allocated to neighbourhood hubs, as described below. In addition to contact occurring in households and mixing hubs, community contact is introduced to capture mixing which occurs outwith these locales and in the wider community. The community contact occurs at a fixed rate, similarly to the Albany model.\n\nCensus data provided the occupation/activity of individuals, namely 'wage-job', 'garden', 'business' and 'unemployed'. This was used to locate individuals denoted as wage-job with known workplaces. The numbers in this census category exceeded those found in the survey of major workplaces and knowledge of Madang suggested the creation of small, local workplaces to locate these additional adults and those in the business category. Adults with garden as their occupation work in family-owned gardens, subsistence farming and generating produce for sale. For each household containing a garden worker, a garden workplace was created whose members matched those of the household.\n\nThree significant populations in Madang were not counted in the 2001 census, namely those in settlements (unofficial housing areas also found in other parts of the developing world), those in the University and Chinese workers at a mine/processing site on the edge of town. The field survey provided numbers resident in each of these locations: the two settlement areas in Madang with ~750 inhabitants each; ~3,000 students and staff living in hostels at the Divine Word University (a further ~280 live in households in town and appeared in the census); and ~650 overseas workers accommodated in hostels at the mine/processing site.\n\nTo model the settlements new households were created and individuals allocated to mixing hubs to match overall Madang demographics. The populations at the University and the mine-site had virtual households created to replicate friendship groups of average size 7, and these locations were also designated as the workplace for these individuals. Contact between the wider Madang population and those at the University involved household and neighbourhood contacts for local students and staff living in town while resident staff and students were restricted to community contact. Contact between the mine-site and the town was also restricted to community contact.\n\nCensus data classified a significant proportion (16.2%) of adults as unemployed and not attending a designated workplace [27] . Knowledge gathered from the field survey in Madang indicated that these adults do have daytime contact with others outwith the home, such as working or visiting the two informal markets. To address this feature an additional daytime contact location (neighbourhood hubs) was introduced, with unemployed adults in each census unit allocated to neighbourhood hubs of 10 individuals. In addition, these hubs also have 25% of all local school age pupils allocated to them, accounting for half of the 50% of school age children which do not attend school.\n\nThe introduction of neighbourhood hubs, which do not exist in the Albany model, give a model which the field survey and local knowledge indicates is representative of the contact patterns found in urban PNG. A Madang model which omits neighbourhood hubs, called Madang-nnh (no neighbourhood hubs), is also used in the simulation experiments and the resulting attack rates are presented in Table 1 . This allows influenza spread dynamics within the three models to be compared and indicates the sensitivity of the Madang model to the presence of the neighbourhood hubs.\n\nThe numbers of individuals in each of the daytime locations for the Albany, Madang and Madang-nnh models are presented in Table A1 in the Supplementary Data File. Additional information on the data used to construct the Madang model is given in [32] . \n\nEach individual has their influenza infection history modelled using an SEIR approach and are in one of 4 infection states, namely susceptible, exposed, infectious, or recovered and thus immune [28] . The passage of infection in each individual reflects the known time-changing infectiousness profile (that is, virus shedding [33] ) of influenza at two discrete points-of-time every 24 hours, during a day-time and a night-time period.\n\nDisease transmission is realised using a probabilistic transmission function, implemented by the simulation algorithm. Together with mobility data, the transmission function captures disease spread throughout the modelled community and may be adjusted to reflect pandemics with various transmission characteristics, corresponding to the basic reproduction number R0 of a particular influenza strain, as discussed further in [20, 24, 25] .\n\nIt is assumed that infection transmission may occur when an infectious and a susceptible individual come into contact, in a stochastic fashion. Once infected, an individual progresses through a series of infection states according to a fixed timeline, taking them from susceptible, to exposed state, to infectious and then to an immune, recovered state [28] .\n\nThe probability that an infectious individual infects a susceptible was calculated using the following function. To achieve simulations for a particular basic reproduction number R0, \u03b2v was adjusted; details of the procedure for estimating \u03b2v and R0 are given in [20] . A pandemic with a basic reproduction number of 1.5 is used in this study, and corresponds to some estimations of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [34, 35, 36, 37] and the 1957 and 1968 pandemics [38, 39] . Since it is virus intrinsic, we assumed that \u03b2v was similar in Madang and thus calculated R0 in the Madang and Madang-nnh models using the \u03b2v corresponding to an R0 of 1.5 in the Albany model. Details of parameter settings used in each model are given in Table A2 in the Supplementary Data File. Individuals in each household and contact hub make contacts within a close-contact mixing group, taken to be the entire household or a subset of larger hubs, and also make additional non hub-based random community contacts. The individual-toindividual transmission probability in larger households was moderated by household size using data from a study by Cauchemez et al [40] . This reflects the assumed reduction in pairwise contact in households with greater than 3 members and is significant in the Madang context, where the average household size is 6.32 compared to 2.54 in Albany.\n\nUsing the contact, mobility and transmission features described above, stochastic simulations of influenza spread in Madang were conducted. All simulations were repeated 40 times with random numbers controlling the outcome of stochastic events (the locality of seeded infected individuals and the probability of transmission) and the results were averaged. Analysis of this simulation model has shown that the 40-run mean attack rate is highly unlikely (95% confidence) to differ by more than 1.2% from the mean attack rate of a much larger set of experiment repeats.\n\nOne new infection per day was introduced into the population during the whole period of the simulations, and randomly allocated to a household. This seeding assumption of 1 case per day was chosen to reliably begin a local epidemic in every stochastic simulation. For the transmission characteristics described above, analysis shows that seeding at this rate for 7 days results in a sustained epidemic in >97% of the simulation runs and 100% with two weeks of seeding, with higher percentages for the higher transmissibility scenarios. Seeding at this rate is continued throughout the simulation in order to capture the case where an epidemic may be initially suppressed by a rigorous intervention strategy, but may subsequently break out if intervention measures are relaxed.\n\nAfter the beginning of a sustained local epidemic, any subsequent variation in the amount of seeding has very little effect on the progress of the local epidemic, as the number of imported cases is much smaller than those generated by the local epidemic. Preliminary analyses using the present model have shown that even if the seeding rate is increased to 5 infections per day, after 7 days the number of The simulation period was divided into 12 hour day/night periods and during each period a nominal location for each individual was determined. This took into consideration the cycle type (day/night, weekday/weekend), infection state of each individual and whether child supervision was needed to look after a child at home. Individuals occupying the same location during the same time period were assumed to come into potential infective contact. Details of the simulation procedure are presented in [20] .\n\nThe effectiveness of social distancing interventions, such as school or workplace closure, may be quantified by comparing the passage of the influenza virus in the community with and without interventions activated, and presented as the reduction in the daily and cumulative illness attack rates. Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered as antiviral agents may only be available in limited quantities in a PNG setting, whilst a vaccination campaign would face significant delay, supply and delivery constraints. Two intervention strategies considered feasible in a PNG setting were examined. These were: school closure involving all schools, with home isolation of all affected children; and a more rigorous strategy involving school closure coupled with 50% reductions in community-wide contact, workplace participation, and contact in neighbourhood hubs.\n\nBoth Madang models, (with and without neighbourhood hubs), were used to compare a pandemic in PNG with one occurring in Albany, Australia. Simulations were conducted involving: no interventions; only school closure applied; and rigorous social distancing, for each of the three models.\n\nGeneral comparative trends are presented in Table 1 , were the Albany and Madang models are compared. For a pandemic in a developed country setting having a basic reproduction number R0 of 1.5 and an illness attack rate of 31.7%, the same pandemic characteristics applied in a PNG setting with no interventions activated resulted in higher rates of influenza transmission, with an attack rate of 46.6% and reproduction number R0 = 1.88 (Table 1) . Comparing the attack rates when interventions were activated, both intervention strategies (solely school closure and rigorous social distancing) were much less effective in the PNG setting compared to the Australian one. The mitigated illness attack rates in the PNG model were approximately 3 times higher than those in the Australian model with the interventions being 60% -70% less effective. We also conducted experiments with the Madang-nnh model, where neighbourhood contact hubs were omitted, to contrast the transmission characteristics with and without these contact hubs. The results of these simulation experiments are included in Tables 1 and 2 . It should be noted that the Madang model with neighbourhood hubs included is believed to be more representative of population mixing characteristics in PNG, following local knowledge. Neighbourhood hubs were introduced to reflect the known mixing patterns occurring with adults not working in designated workplaces, such as found in the regular contact which may occur among individuals in marketplaces. The addition of such contact hubs increased individual-to-individual contacts and hence infection transmission opportunities (see Table 2 ) with approximately 2,000 additional symptomatic infections resulting, for all three (mitigated and non-mitigated) scenarios. In terms of cumulative illness attack rate, the Madang model gave a basic reproduction number R0 of 1.88 and an illness attack rate of 46.6%, compared to that of the Madang-nnh (no neighbourhood hub) model with R0 = 1.74 and an illness attack rate of 40.8%. The daily case incidence resulting from simulating the Albany, Madang and Madang-nnh models is presented in Figure 2 for the three scenarios. It is apparent from the results presented in Table 1 that there is a greater proportion of influenza cases occurring within households in both Madang models note that Madang has a total population of ~35,000 compared to ~30,000 in Albany.\n\nThe school closure intervention in the Madang model is found to be approximately 5 times less effective compared to that of the Albany model. Simulation results suggest a 9.4% reduction (46.6% to 42.2%) in the illness attack rate can be achieved in Madang due to school closure whereas a 48.6% reduction (31.7% to 16.3%) can be achieved in Albany (see Table 1 ). For the Madang-nnh (no neighbourhood hub) model, school closure is approximately 3.5 times less effective compared to the Albany model. These results suggest that both social distancing strategies are much less effective in a PNG setting compared to what might be achieved in a developed country. Figure 2 also reveals this clear trend, with peak case incidence and the area under the curves (the attack rate) being higher in both Madang models compared to the Albany model.\n\nThe sensitivity of key model parameters, such as school contact group size, illness withdrawal rates and intervention duration have been extensively examined for the Albany model [42, 43] . These indicate that while the model is sensitive to some parameter settings, the relative effectiveness of social distancing interventions remains unchanged, a feature also shared by the Madang models.\n\nThe major difference between the Albany and Madang models is the presence of neighbourhood hubs. We have included a Madang model which has no neighbourhood hubs (Madang-nnh), and present comparative results for all three models in Tables 1 and 2, Figure 2 and Tables A3-A6 (Supplementary Data File).\n\nSimulations comparing neighbourhood mixing group sizes 10 (baseline), 20 and 30 indicate that for hubs of size 20 and 30, the increased transmission results in higher attack rates, as expected (see Table A3 , Supplementary Data File).\n\nThe effect of varying compliance with home isolation of school children following school closure on attack rate was examined. Compliance was reduced from 100% to 50%. Reduced compliance increased the attack rate in Albany as those children affected made additional daytime contacts with other children. In Madang, the reduction in compliance had only minimal effect since approximately 50% of school age children do not attend school and continue to make daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs (see Table A4 , Supplementary Data File).\n\nThe effect of using different probabilities of voluntary withdrawal to the home of symptomatic adults and children is presented in Table A5 . Lower rates of voluntary withdrawal lead to higher attack rates in all three models. Voluntary withdrawal from work or school has a more pronounced effect in the Albany model, as a significant proportion of children in Madang still transmit through daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs.\n\nThe effects of variation of the timing of intervention initiation are presented in Table  A6 . In the school closure scenario, delayed response had the most severe impact on the attack rates in Albany, whereas for the Madang models the changes in attack rate were marginal. This is again due to a large fraction of children not attending school and the existence of neighbourhood hubs. Similarly, in the rigorous contact reduction scenario the effect of delayed response on attack rate was more \n\nIntroduction of a pandemic influenza strain with identical transmissibility characteristics results in a significantly higher infection and illness rate in a PNG setting when compared to that of a developed country. Social distancing intervention strategies suitable for a developing country may be significantly less effective in reducing the attack rate when compared to the outcomes expected in an Australian setting. Substantially more infections occurred in PNG households compared to that of the Australian model. The significantly larger size of households, a feature shared by many developing countries, together with higher community-wide contact in PNG, contributed to the higher infection rates.\n\nInterventions are less effective in a PNG setting since they are not targeted at household transmission, and given the larger household sizes, are applicable to a smaller proportion of transmissions compared to the Australian scenario. In addition, as only half the school-age children in Madang attend school, the two school closure based interventions impact on many fewer individuals.\n\nWhile care was taken to obtain detailed data used to populate the Madang and Albany models, government data was found to be more limited in PNG. While a field survey was conducted in Madang to fill in missing data and make the models as directly comparable as possible, there is still scope for conducting further data collection. The lack of similar low-income modelling studies prevents comparison with related studies, and suggests that this is an area requiring further attention.\n\nResearch studies expanding on that reported here suggest themselves: the construction and use of a number of additional PNG models capturing different population structures, such as rural villages and island communities; and the determination of health outcomes following a moderately severe influenza pandemic, taking into account co-morbidities with extant diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, diseases common to many low-income countries.\n\nThe interventions used in the present study are based on social distancing. Surveys have shown that a higher proportion of low-income countries have social distancing interventions planned in the case of a pandemic, compared to high income European countries due to their feasibility and cost-effectiveness. Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered in this study due to cost and delivery issues found with low-income countries. [4, 8] Consideration may need to be given to some form of antiviral agent use, possibly for case treatment, given the poor performance of purely social distancing interventions in developing countries as suggested by this study. The advantage of antiviral use is that it may be targeted at reducing within-household transmission, a location of transmission otherwise not impacted by social distancing interventions. The present study shows that larger numbers of transmissions occur within households due to the larger household sizes in countries such as PNG. Furthermore, low-income countries generally have population health profiles not seen in developed countries, including the prevalence of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. [44] Antiviral treatment of influenza cases co-infected with such diseases may be an appropriate intervention strategy given the poorer health outcomes which co-morbidity may impose. [12] The provision and use of antiviral agents will have challenges not faced by industrialised countries, due to the cost of providing an antiviral stockpile and subsequent distribution of antivirals in countries which have health systems already stretched to capacity. [15] The importance of suitable pandemic influenza preparedness plans for low-income countries is recognized by the WHO [45, 46] . Disease transmission models will play a role in guiding policy makers in determining the effectiveness of possible pandemic countermeasures. History tells us that low-income countries are likely to be more affected, yet almost all models deal with mitigation strategies for developed nations with good health infrastructure and low prevalence of endemic diseases. Daily case incidence for the no intervention, school closure and rigorous social distancing (school closure and workplace and community contact reductions) scenarios is shown. The blue, red and green curves represent the Albany, Madang and Madang-nnh models respectively. Compliance with home isolation of school children following school closure intervention has been examined and compliance reduction from 100% to 50% considered. Effects of reduced compliances on the illness attack rates and their corresponding 95% CI (in parentheses, shaded rows) are presented in Table A4 . For the purely school closure intervention, the illness attack rate increases by ~3% in Albany as reduced isolation permits additional child-to-child contact. In the Madang models, reduced compliance with home isolation during the period of school closure has minimal effect on the attack rate. This is due to ~50% school age children not attending school. In all three models, reduced compliance has minimal effect if additional rigorous social distancing interventions are also applied. Alternative intervention activation timing assumptions for school closure, workforce reduction and community contact reduction are examined and two different settings are considered. Effects of these alternative assumptions on the illness attack rates and their corresponding 95% CI (in parentheses, shaded rows) are presented.

The comments of the reviewer(s) are included at the bottom of this letter.\n\nThe reviewer(s) have recommended revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the reviewer(s)' comments and revise your manuscript. Please remember that the reviewers' comments and the previous drafts of your manuscript will be published as supplementary information alongside the final version.\n\nOnce again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to BMJ Open and I look forward to receiving your revision.\n\nIndia compared to Europe and the USA [5, 6] .\" (p 4, line [27] [28] [29] Perhaps data from the recent 2009 H1N1 could be used to demonstrate clear differences.\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that the rationale for conducting the study required to be made in a more comprehensive fashion. We have now revised the introduction of the manuscript to describe the motivation of our study in greater detail by including recent references on the impact of influenza pandemics on developing countries. We have now illustrated in more detail the deficiencies in preparedness of developing nations to pandemic influenza and the elevated mortality that can be expected if a pandemic influenza occurs in a developing country. We have now cited a number of papers which have documented a) the level of preparedness of developing countries for influenza pandemics in terms of preparedness plans and available infrastructure [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] and b) the mortality burden of historic pandemics in developing countries. [6] [7] [8] .\n\nThe study is under-referenced throughout. Many general statements are given without citation.\n\nWe have addressed this by including more references e.g., those mentioned in our response to Comment 1 above. \n\nWe agree with the reviewer. The methods section 'Madang Demographics' now contains further details on the survey we conducted in Madang, and this extended section can be found below. The data collected in the field survey are incorporated in Table A1 where the total numbers of all people allocated to specific locations are shown.\n\nMadang model development used the most recent 2001 census data, other PNG government data and additional field data. [17] Census data provided the location of groups of approximately 50 adjacent households, known as the census unit (CU). The specific demographics of each household in Madang in terms of number of individuals, their ages and occupation of adults was also provided by the census dataset and each individual is uniquely identified in the model. Table A1 .\n\nThese data allowed for the construction of an explicit contact network linking households, schools, workplaces and other meeting places by allocating individuals to these meeting places, similar as in the Albany model [10] .' \n\nWe thank the reviewer for this comment. We have now conducted additional sensitivity analyses on the parameters mentioned by the reviewer. Specifically, we have varied the probabilities of adult and child withdrawal from school/work and the response times for intervention activation. The results of the sensitivity analyses can be found in the Supplementary Data File in Tables A5 and A6 . We have also extended the Sensitivity analysis section in the main text to include the results from varying the timing of interventions as follows:\n\n'The effect of varying compliance with home isolation of school children following school closure on attack rate was examined. Compliance was reduced from 100% to 50%. Reduced compliance increased the attack rate in Albany as those children affected made additional daytime contacts with other children. In Madang, the reduction in compliance had only minimal effect since approximately 50% of school age children do not attend school and continue to make daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs (see Table A4 , Supplementary Data File).\n\nThe effect of different probabilities of voluntary withdrawal to the home of symptomatic adults and children is on the model outcome is presented in Table A5 . Lower rates of voluntary withdrawal lead to higher attack rates in all three models. Voluntary withdrawal from work or school has a more pronounced effect in the Albany model, as a significant proportion of children in Madang still transmit through daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs. The effects of variation of the timing of intervention initiation are presented in Table A6 . In the school closure scenario, delayed response had the most severe impact on the attack rates in Albany, whereas for the Madang models the changes in attack rate were marginal. This is again due to a large fraction of children not attending school and the existence of neighbourhood hubs. Similarly, in the rigorous contact reduction scenario the effect of delayed response on attack rate was more pronounced in the Albany model, due to lower effectiveness of interventions in a PNG setting.'\n\nMore discussion needs to be made of the interventions. How feasible are they in developing nations?\n\nResponse: All the interventions we used in the present study are based on social distancing. We think that these types of interventions are quite feasible since they are the most cost effective and do not rely on the supply of antiviral drugs. Our view is supported by other studies which have analyzed pandemic influenza preparedness plans for low and medium income countries. These show that a higher proportion of low-income countries have social distancing interventions planned in the case of an outbreak, compared to high income European countries due to their feasibility and cost-effectiveness, given that the supply of antiviral drugs will be difficult in developing nations [3, 4] . We have now included additional text in the discussion section of the manuscript regarding the feasibiltity of the interventions we modelled in this study. This text can be found below.\n\n'The interventions used in the present study are based on social distancing.

'Census data classified a significant proportion (16.2%) of adults as unemployed and do not attend a designated workplace [17] . Local knowledge indicated that these adults do have daytime contact with others outwith the home, such as working or visiting the two informal markets. To address this feature an additional daytime contact location (neighbourhood hub) was introduced, with unemployed adults in each census unit allocated to neighbourhood hubs of 10 individuals. In addition, these hubs also have 25% of all local school age pupils allocated to them, accounting for half of the 50% of school age children which do not attend school.' The seeding assumption of 1 case per day was chosen to reliably begin a local epidemic in every stochastic simulation. Analysis of the low transmissibility scenario shows that seeding at this rate for 7 days results in a sustained epidemic in >97% of the simulation runs and 100% with two weeks of seeding, with higher percentages for the higher transmissibility scenarios.

Table 2 ?\n\nWe have rephrased the captions in Table 2 . The numbers in Table 2 are the absolute number of infected people per location. 'Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered in this study due to cost and delivery issues found with low-income countries. However, consideration may need to be given to some form of antiviral agent use, possibly for case treatment, given the poor performance of purely social distancing interventions in developing countries as suggested by this study.

[19] ' \n\nWe have addressed this comment with our extended sensitivity analysis. In this analysis, we also vary the timing of the interventions. The results can be found in the Supplementary Data File in Tables A5 and A6 . We also discuss them in the 'Sensitivity Analysis' section of the Results where we added the following text:\n\n'The effect of different probabilities of voluntary withdrawal of symptomatic adults and children is presented in Table A5 . Lower rates of voluntary withdrawal lead to higher attack rates in all three models. Voluntary withdrawal from work or school has a more pronounced effect in the Albany model, again since a significant proportion of children in Madang still transmit through daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs.\n\nThe effects of variation of the timing of intervention initiation are presented in Table A6 . In the school closure scenario, delayed response had the most severe impact on the attack rates in Albany, whereas for the Madang models the changes in attack rate were marginal. This is again due to a large fraction of children not attending school and the existence of neighbourhood hubs. Similary, in the rigourous contact reduction scenario the effect of delayed response on attack rate was also more pronounced in the Albany model. However in comparison to school closure only, the effect on attack rate in Madang was also increased.'\n\nSince the contact network is un-weighted, I would assume that a social contact within the households is equivalent to a social contact in the neighborhood in terms of disease transmissibility. If so, this would be a crude assumption and has to be explicitly discussed about how this assumption may affect the results shown in the text. \n\nThe reviewer is correct that in order to model different transmission rates for different settings, the force of infection experienced by each individual must differ in each setting (i.e. it must be weighted). We achieve this in our model by adjusting contact parameters to obtain location-specific ratios of transmission, and have calibrated these parameters to match published transmission location data, see below.\n\nOur transmission function, which appears on page 8 of the manuscript, is based on pair-wise contact between two individuals, one who is infectious and one who is susceptible. Our 'force of infection' parameter \u03b2 adjusts the probability of transmission to reflect alternative attack rates (cf. reproduction number). Differential transmission by location is captured by adjusting contact parameters, that is, whois-in-contact-with-whom, for contact in schools, large workplaces and in the wider community.\n\nWe have expanded the methods section of the manuscript, giving an outline of the contact and transmission mechanism used, specifically stating the data sets used to calibrate the model to produce location and age specific transmission rates. The following text has been added under 'Contact Network' in the methods section of the main text:\n\n'The number of contacts made by each individual each day in school, work and community settings were adjusted to reproduce the proportion of cases occurring in different settings as reported by empirical studies, specifically 40% of infections occurred in households, 30% in schools and workplaces, and 30% in the wider community. [20] [21] [22] Contacts within schools and workplaces occurred in fixed-size mixing groups of maximum size 10; within mixing groups contact was assumed to be homogeneous. Community contacts occurred between randomly selected individuals, weighted toward pairs of individuals with nearby households.'\n\nThe evaluation of the impact of school closure in mitigating an influenza epidemic might strongly depends by the model assumptions. The coupling effect of workforce closure and school closure should be also evaluated as the compliance rates may vary when implementing them individually or in combination mode. Authors may need to evaluate or discuss this point.\n\nWe have now conducted a sensitivity analysis of compliance with home isolation of children resulting from school closure as well as rigorous social distancing resulting from school closure coupled with workplace closure and community contact reduction. This analysis can be found in the Supplementary Data File. (Table A4 ). The table illustrates that while compliance in the school closure scenario has a profound effect on transmission in the Albany model, it has only a marginal effect in the Madang models. This is because about half of the children in Madang do not attend schools in the model and household sizes are larger. Thus the majority of transmission occurs in household and neighbourhood hubs in the Madang models and less in the wider community. Please see Table 1 in the main text for specific numbers. We have also added more text to the 'Sensitivity Analysis' part of the manuscript. This text can also be found in our response to Comment 6b of Reviewer 1. \n\nObjectives The possible occurrence of a highly pathogenic influenza strain is of concern to health authorities worldwide. It is known that during past influenza pandemics developing countries have experienced considerably higher mortality rates compared to developed countries. Furthermore, many developing countries lack appropriate pandemic preparedness plans. Mathematical modelling studies to guide the development of such plans are largely focused on predicting pandemic influenza spread in developed nations. However, intervention strategies shown by modelling studies to be highly effective for developed countries give limited guidance as to the impact which an influenza pandemic may have on low-income countries given different demographics and resource constraints. To address this, an individual-based model of a Papua New Guinean community was created and used to simulate the spread of a novel influenza strain.

The larger average household size in PNG, the larger proportion of the population under 18 and greater community-wide contact all contribute to this feature. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\nArticle focus This modelling study investigated the impact of an influenza pandemic on a community in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and compared it with that in a similar sized community in Australia. The effectiveness of social distancing interventions was determined using the PNG model and contrasted with the Australian model.\n\nA moderately transmissible pandemic occurring in PNG may be expected to result in a larger illness attack rate compared to that in a developed country setting.\n\nFeasible social distancing intervention strategies may be significantly less effective in PNG compared to the Australian setting. Compared to Australia, the larger household sizes contribute both to the larger attack rates in PNG and to the lower effectiveness of the interventions.\n\nThe larger proportion of children in PNG and the fact that 50% do not attend school lessen the effectiveness of school closure interventions.\n\nStrength and limitations of this study The findings are a first step in understanding how an influenza pandemic will impact on a low-income country.\n\nAs with all modelling studies obtaining high-quality field data with which to \"populate\" models is crucial and accessing such data in countries such as PNG is a challenge. These results and those from future research will permit better pandemic planning and allow intervention strategies to be tailored to the specific demographics and resource constraints found in developing countries. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\nNovel influenza virus strains have resulted in pandemics costing millions of lives [1] and the possible occurrence of a highly pathogenic virus strain is of concern to health authorities worldwide.\n\nIt has been shown under laboratory conditions that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza strain may re-assort or mutate to become readily transmissible between humans. [2] In response to the threat of influenza pandemics, most countries have developed pandemic preparedness plans. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However the level of completeness of these plans with regards to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [9] varies dramatically between developed high income countries and developing, low-income countries. [7, 8] Low-income countries suffer the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from influenza pandemics. Data from the 1918/19 pandemic suggests much higher mortality rates in India compared to Europe and the USA. While in northern Europe and the USA mortality rates were consistently below 1%, over 4.3% average mortality was reported from India, with some Indian provinces exceeding mortality rates of 7%. [10, 11] Even in the mild H1N1 pandemic of 2009, 59% of the estimated 284,500 deaths occurred in Africa and South-East Asia. [2] These differences are most likely due to the significant association of influenza mortality with comorbidities usually absent in the developed countries (such as chronic malnutrition, malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia and HIV). [12] Furthermore it has been shown that the increased mortality rate due to an influenza pandemic is strongly associated with per capita income. [11] It is apparent that the burden of the next pandemic will also be focused overwhelmingly on the developing world, a point made by the WHO and others. [5, 11, [13] [14] [15] A substantial number of pandemic influenza models have been constructed in the past decade. A key goal of this effort is to determine the effectiveness of interventions, in terms of their ability to reduce infection and consequential mortality rates. Although it has been recognized that the major burden of mortality from influenza pandemics is suffered by low-income countries [5, 11, 16] the primary focus of the vast majority of these models is on examining intervention effectiveness in developed (e.g., the USA and European countries [17] [18] [19] [20] ) and middle income countries (e.g., Thailand [21, 22] ). Given the markedly different demographic and community structure, as well as resource and infrastructural constraints in comparison with developed countries, these models have limited capability to predict the impact of an influenza pandemic on low-income countries [23] . In addition, many low-income countries are located in tropical or subtropical regions where the timing and impact of influenza epidemics are more poorly understood than in temperate regions, where they are known to have a well-defined winter season. [15] To address this 'modelling gap' an individual-based disease transmission model of pandemic influenza has been developed for Papua New Guinea (PNG), based on the methods used previously to develop a pandemic influenza model of Albany, Western 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   5 Australia [20, 24, 25] . The chosen location of Madang, a town of approximately 35,000 on the northern coast of the island of New Guinea has, along with all of PNG, different demographics and individual-to-individual contact patterns compared to those in developed countries. Papua New Guinea has an annual per capita income of about $US 2500,-and is thus at a similar level of development as many African nations. [26] The model was used to describe the spread of a novel influenza strain after introduction into the community. The resulting illness attack rate was determined together with data indicating where person-to-person transmission occurred. An unmitigated outbreak and two outbreaks with PNG-feasible intervention strategies activated were simulated and the results compared to those obtained using the Albany, Australia model.\n\nCensus and country-wide data from the PNG National Statistics Office [27] together with data collected in a field survey in Madang were used to construct the Madang model. Following the methodology used to construct the Albany model, each household is explicitly represented, with occupants in one of 7 age categories. Schools, workplace and other mixing hubs were also explicitly represented. Individuals were allocated to these mixing hubs according to their age category, so connecting households and hubs as shown in Figure 1 . Using virus intrinsic transmission characteristics calibrated with the Australian model, simulations were performed using the Madang model. These simulations captured the day-to-day susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered/immune infection profile of the population following introduction of a novel strain of influenza into the modelled community, assuming no existing immunity. [28] \n\nMadang model development used the most recent census data from 2001, other PNG government data and additional data collected in our field survey. [29] Census data provided the location groups of approximately 50 adjacent households, known as the census unit (CU). The specific demographics of each household in Madang in terms of number of individuals, their ages and occupation of adults was also provided by the census and each individual is uniquely identified in the model.\n\nFrom July to September 2011 we also conducted a survey in Madang to obtain data on the number of people working in smaller workplaces, school class sizes, market sizes, and the number of people attending the major tertiary education centres in Madang (Divine Word University (DWU), Madang Teachers College, Madang Technical College and Madang Maritime College). We asked the headmasters of schools and colleges, the human resource department at DWU and business owners of small to medium scale businesses about the respective numbers and, if no records existed relied on their estimates. We also obtained estimates on the size of informal 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Table A1 (Supplementary Data  File) .\n\nThese data allowed for the construction of an explicit contact network linking households, schools, workplaces and other meeting places by allocating individuals to workplaces and schools, as with the Albany model [10] .\n\nThe model captures explicit person-to-person contact with the contact network describing population mobility occurring between households, schools, workplaces and the wider community as shown in Figure 1 . The virus spreads through the community due to this mobility, as transmission occurs between individuals when they are co-located, possibly following a move from one location to another.\n\nThe number of contacts made by each individual each day in school, work and community settings were adjusted to reproduce the proportion of cases occurring in different settings as reported by empirical studies, specifically 40% of infections occurred in households, 30% in schools and workplaces, and 30% in the wider community. [30] [31] [32] Contacts within schools and workplaces occurred in fixed-size mixing groups of maximum size 10. Within mixing groups contact was assumed to be homogeneous. Community contacts occurred between randomly selected individuals, weighted toward pairs of individuals located in neighbouring households.\n\nEach household contains uniquely identified individuals. Children and adults are assigned by an allocation algorithm to school classes and workplaces according to age based on class sizes and employee numbers obtained in the field survey. The field survey described above revealed that 50% of school-age children do not attend school, and this percentage is thought to be similar to most urban areas in PNG, with still lower rates in rural areas. Of those children not attending school 50% are allocated to neighbourhood hubs, as described below. In addition to contact occurring in households and mixing hubs, community contact is introduced to capture mixing which occurs outwith these locales and in the wider community. The community contact occurs at a fixed rate, similarly to the Albany model.\n\nCensus data provided the occupation/activity of individuals, namely 'wage-job', 'garden', 'business' and 'unemployed'. This was used to locate individuals denoted as wage-job with known workplaces. The numbers in this census category exceeded those found in the survey of major workplaces and knowledge of Madang suggested the creation of small, local workplaces to locate these additional adults and those in the business category. Adults with garden as their occupation work in family-owned gardens, subsistence farming and generating produce for sale. For each household containing a garden worker, a garden workplace was created whose members matched those of the household.\n\nThree significant populations in Madang were not counted in the 2001 census, namely those in settlements (unofficial housing areas also found in other parts of the developing world), those in the University and Chinese workers at a mine/processing site on the edge of town. The field survey provided numbers resident in each of these locations: the two settlement areas in Madang with ~750 inhabitants each; ~3,000 students and staff living in hostels at the Divine Word University (a further ~280 live in households in town and appeared in the census); and ~650 overseas workers accommodated in hostels at the mine/processing site.\n\nTo model the settlements new households were created and individuals allocated to mixing hubs to match overall Madang demographics. The populations at the University and the mine-site had virtual households created to replicate friendship groups of average size 7, and these locations were also designated as the workplace for these individuals. Contact between the wider Madang population and those at the University involved household and neighbourhood contacts for local students and staff living in town while resident staff and students were restricted to community contact. Contact between the mine-site and the town was also restricted to community contact.\n\nCensus data classified a significant proportion (16.2%) of adults as unemployed and not attending a designated workplace [27] . Knowledge gathered from the field survey in Madang indicated that these adults do have daytime contact with others outwith the home, such as working or visiting the two informal markets. To address this feature an additional daytime contact location (neighbourhood hubs) was introduced, with unemployed adults in each census unit allocated to neighbourhood hubs of 10 individuals. In addition, these hubs also have 25% of all local school age pupils allocated to them, accounting for half of the 50% of school age children which do not attend school.\n\nThe introduction of neighbourhood hubs, which do not exist in the Albany model, give a model which the field survey and local knowledge indicates is representative of the contact patterns found in urban PNG. A Madang model which omits neighbourhood hubs, called Madang-nnh (no neighbourhood hubs), is also used in the simulation experiments and the resulting attack rates are presented in Table 1 . This allows influenza spread dynamics within the three models to be compared and indicates the sensitivity of the Madang model to the presence of the neighbourhood hubs.\n\nThe numbers of individuals in each of the daytime locations for the Albany, Madang and Madang-nnh models are presented in Table A1 in the Supplementary Data File. Additional information on the data used to construct the Madang model is given in [33] . \n\nEach individual has their influenza infection history modelled using an SEIR approach and are in one of 4 infection states, namely susceptible, exposed, infectious, or recovered and thus immune [28] . The passage of infection in each individual reflects the known time-changing infectiousness profile (that is, virus shedding [34] ) of influenza at two discrete points-of-time every 24 hours, during a day-time and a night-time period.\n\nDisease transmission is realised using a probabilistic transmission function, implemented by the simulation algorithm. Together with mobility data, the transmission function captures disease spread throughout the modelled community and may be adjusted to reflect pandemics with various transmission characteristics, corresponding to the basic reproduction number R0 of a particular influenza strain, as discussed further in [20, 24, 25] .\n\nIt is assumed that infection transmission may occur when an infectious and a susceptible individual come into contact, in a stochastic fashion. Once infected, an individual progresses through a series of infection states according to a fixed timeline, taking them from susceptible, to exposed state, to infectious and then to an immune, recovered state [28] .\n\nThe probability that an infectious individual infects a susceptible was calculated using the following function.\n\nThe factors which determine probability of transmission from an infectious individual (Ii) to a susceptible individual (Is) are the basic virus transmissibility (\u03b2v), the age-based susceptibility of Is the current level of infectiousness of Ii, and, if the contact between Ii and Is occurs in a household, the household size Household(Ii, Is). Details of the household size factor are given below; further details of the influenza transmission model can be found in [35] .\n\nTo achieve simulations for a particular basic reproduction number R0, \u03b2v was adjusted; details of the procedure for estimating \u03b2v and R0 are given in [20] . A pandemic with a basic reproduction number of 1.5 is used in this study, and corresponds to some estimations of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [36] [37] [38] [39] and the 1957 and 1968 pandemics [40, 41] . Since it is virus intrinsic, we assumed that \u03b2v was similar in Madang and thus calculated R0 in the Madang and Madang-nnh models using the \u03b2v corresponding to an R0 of 1.5 in the Albany model. Details of parameter settings used in each model are given in Table A2 in the Supplementary Data File. Individuals in each household and contact hub make contacts within a close-contact mixing group, taken to be the entire household or a subset of larger hubs, and also make additional non hub-based random community contacts. The individual-toindividual transmission probability in larger households was moderated by household size using data from a study by Cauchemez et al [42] . The reduction of the probability of within-household transmission with household size is also shown in Figure A1 in the Supplementary Data File. This reflects the assumed reduction in pairwise contact in households with greater than 3 members and is significant in the Madang context, where the average household size is 6.32 compared to 2.54 in Albany.\n\nUsing the contact, mobility and transmission features described above, stochastic simulations of influenza spread in Madang were conducted. All simulations were repeated 40 times with random numbers controlling the outcome of stochastic events (the locality of seeded infected individuals and the probability of transmission) and the results were averaged. Analysis of this simulation model has shown that the 40-run mean attack rate is highly unlikely (95% confidence) to differ by more than 1.2% from the mean attack rate of a much larger set of experiment repeats. [20] Where 95% confidence intervals are reported in the results, these were calculated from the mean and standard deviation of 40 randomly seeded simulation runs, using the normal approximation method.\n\nOne new infection per day was introduced into the population during the whole period of the simulations, and randomly allocated to a household. This seeding assumption of 1 case per day was chosen to reliably begin a local epidemic in every stochastic simulation. For the transmission characteristics described above, analysis shows that seeding at this rate for 7 days results in a sustained epidemic in >97% of the simulation runs and 100% with two weeks of seeding, with higher percentages for the higher transmissibility scenarios. Seeding at this rate is continued throughout the simulation in order to capture the case where an epidemic may be initially suppressed by a rigorous intervention strategy, but may subsequently break out if intervention measures are relaxed. After the beginning of a sustained local epidemic, any subsequent variation in the amount of seeding has very little effect on the progress of the local epidemic, as the number of imported cases is much smaller than those generated by the local epidemic. Preliminary analyses using the present model have shown that even if the seeding rate is increased to 5 infections per day, after 7 days the number of infections generated from the self-sustained local epidemic is twice the number of imported infections, and by 14 days local infections outnumber imported infections by a factor of 8.\n\nThe simulation period was divided into 12 hour day/night periods and during each period a nominal location for each individual was determined. This took into consideration the cycle type (day/night, weekday/weekend), infection state of each individual and whether child supervision was needed to look after a child at home. Individuals occupying the same location during the same time period were assumed to come into potential infective contact. Details of the simulation procedure are presented in [20] .\n\nThe effectiveness of social distancing interventions, such as school or workplace closure, may be quantified by comparing the passage of the influenza virus in the community with and without interventions activated, and presented as the reduction in the daily and cumulative illness attack rates. Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered as antiviral agents may only be available in limited quantities in a PNG setting, whilst a vaccination campaign would face significant delay, supply and delivery constraints. Two intervention strategies considered feasible in a PNG setting were examined. These were: school closure involving all schools, with home isolation of all affected children; and a more rigorous strategy involving school closure coupled with 50% reductions in community-wide contact, workplace participation, and contact in neighbourhood hubs.\n\nBoth Madang models, (with and without neighbourhood hubs), were used to compare a pandemic in PNG with one occurring in Albany, Australia. Simulations were conducted involving: no interventions; only school closure applied; and rigorous social distancing, for each of the three models.\n\nGeneral comparative trends are presented in Table 1 , were the Albany and Madang models are compared. For a pandemic in a developed country setting having a basic reproduction number R0 of 1.5 and an illness attack rate of 31.7%, the same pandemic characteristics applied in a PNG setting with no interventions activated resulted in higher rates of influenza transmission, with an attack rate of 46.6% and reproduction number R0 = 1.88 (Table 1) . Comparing the attack rates when interventions were activated, both intervention strategies (solely school closure and rigorous social distancing) were much less effective in the PNG setting compared to the Australian one. The mitigated illness attack rates in the PNG model were approximately 3 times higher than those in the Australian model with the interventions being 60% -70% less effective. Table 2 indicates where transmission that resulted in illness occurred, showing a significantly higher number and proportion of transmissions occurring in households, as opposed to other contact/transmission locations, in the Madang compared to the Australian model ( Table 1 ). The average household size in the PNG model is 2.5 times larger than that in Albany and this had a significant impact on the overall infection rate, making it noticeably higher in the PNG model.\n\nWe also conducted experiments with the Madang-nnh model, where neighbourhood contact hubs were omitted, to contrast the transmission characteristics with and without these contact hubs. The results of these simulation experiments are included in Tables 1 and 2 . It should be noted that the Madang model with neighbourhood hubs included is believed to be more representative of population mixing characteristics in PNG, following local knowledge. Neighbourhood hubs were introduced to reflect the known mixing patterns occurring with adults not working in designated workplaces, such as found in the regular contact which may occur among individuals in marketplaces. The addition of such contact hubs increased individual-to-individual contacts and hence infection transmission opportunities (see Table 2 ) with approximately 2,000 additional symptomatic infections resulting, for all three (mitigated and non-mitigated) scenarios. In terms of cumulative illness attack rate, the Madang model gave a basic reproduction number R0 of 1.88 and an illness attack rate of 46.6%, compared to that of the Madang-nnh (no neighbourhood hub) model with R0 = 1.74 and an illness attack rate of 40.8%. The daily case incidence resulting from simulating the Albany, Madang and Madang-nnh models is presented in Figure 2 for the three scenarios. note that Madang has a total population of ~35,000 compared to ~30,000 in Albany.\n\nThe school closure intervention in the Madang model is found to be approximately 5 times less effective compared to that of the Albany model. Simulation results suggest a 9.4% reduction (46.6% to 42.2%) in the illness attack rate can be achieved in Madang due to school closure whereas a 48.6% reduction (31.7% to 16.3%) can be achieved in Albany (see Table 1 ). For the Madang-nnh (no neighbourhood hub) model, school closure is approximately 3.5 times less effective compared to the Albany model. \n\nPrevious simulation studies [20, 43, 44] show that rigorous social distancing interventions involving school closure coupled to contact reductions in other locations may be highly effective in reducing the attack rate within a developed country setting. Comparing the effectiveness of rigorous social distancing between the Albany and Madang models, an ~83% reduction (from 31.7% to 5.4%) reduction may be achieved in Albany whereas a smaller ~62.7% reduction (from 46.6%% to 17.4%), is achieved in the Madang model; see Table 1 . In the Madangnnh model a ~69.4% reduction in the attack rate (40.8% to 12.5%) can be achieved by this rigorous social distancing intervention. These results suggest that both social distancing strategies are much less effective in a PNG setting compared to what might be achieved in a developed country. Figure 2 also reveals this clear trend, with peak case incidence and the area under the curves (the attack rate) being higher in both Madang models compared to the Albany model.\n\nThe sensitivity of key model parameters, such as school contact group size, illness withdrawal rates and intervention duration have been extensively examined for the Albany model [44, 45] . These indicate that while the model is sensitive to some parameter settings, the relative effectiveness of social distancing interventions remains unchanged, a feature also shared by the Madang models.\n\nThe major difference between the Albany and Madang models is the presence of neighbourhood hubs. We have included a Madang model which has no neighbourhood hubs (Madang-nnh), and present comparative results for all three models in Tables 1 and 2, Figure 2 and Tables A3-A6 (Supplementary Data File).\n\nSimulations comparing neighbourhood mixing group sizes 10 (baseline), 20 and 30 indicate that for hubs of size 20 and 30, the increased transmission results in higher attack rates, as expected (see Table A3 , Supplementary Data File).\n\nThe effect of varying compliance with home isolation of school children following school closure on attack rate was examined. Compliance was reduced from 100% to 50%. Reduced compliance increased the attack rate in Albany as those children affected made additional daytime contacts with other children. In Madang, the reduction in compliance had only minimal effect since approximately 50% of school age children do not attend school and continue to make daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs (see Table A4 , Supplementary Data File).\n\nThe effect of using different probabilities of voluntary withdrawal to the home of symptomatic adults and children is presented in Table A5 . Lower rates of voluntary withdrawal lead to higher attack rates in all three models. Voluntary withdrawal from work or school has a more pronounced effect in the Albany model, as a significant proportion of children in Madang still transmit through daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs.\n\nThe effects of variation of the timing of intervention initiation are presented in Table  A6 . In the school closure scenario, delayed response had the most severe impact on the attack rates in Albany, whereas for the Madang models the changes in attack rate were marginal. This is again due to a large fraction of children not attending school and the existence of neighbourhood hubs. Similarly, in the rigorous contact reduction scenario the effect of delayed response on attack rate was more \n\nIntroduction of a pandemic influenza strain with identical transmissibility characteristics results in a significantly higher infection and illness rate in a PNG setting when compared to that of a developed country. Social distancing intervention strategies suitable for a developing country may be significantly less effective in reducing the attack rate when compared to the outcomes expected in an Australian setting. Substantially more infections occurred in PNG households compared to that of the Australian model. The significantly larger size of households, a feature shared by many developing countries, together with higher community-wide contact in PNG, contributed to the higher infection rates.\n\nInterventions are less effective in a PNG setting since they are not targeted at household transmission, and given the larger household sizes, are applicable to a smaller proportion of transmissions compared to the Australian scenario. In addition, as only half the school-age children in Madang attend school, the two school closure based interventions impact fewer individuals.\n\nWhile care was taken to obtain detailed data used to populate the Madang and Albany models, government data was found to be more limited in PNG. While a field survey was conducted in Madang to fill in missing data and make the models as directly comparable as possible, there is still scope for conducting further data collection. As with all modelling studies, the accuracy of results is limited by the quality of data used to construct the model. In the case of influenza epidemic modelling, outcomes are dependent on assumptions about the number, duration and physical closeness of contacts between people, and how these attributes of contact affect transmission probability. These data are very difficult to estimate, with the best data source available being [46] . In the absence of high-quality reliable data, we have made plausible assumptions regarding interpersonal contact, and, in the Albany case, these are reflective of the data in [46] .\n\nThe lack of similar low-income modelling studies prevents comparison with related studies, and suggests that this is an area requiring further attention. Research studies expanding on that reported here suggest themselves: the construction and use of a number of additional PNG models capturing different population structures, such as rural villages and island communities; and the determination of health outcomes following a moderately severe influenza pandemic, taking into account comorbidities with extant diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, diseases common to many low-income countries.\n\nThe interventions used in the present study are based on social distancing. Surveys have shown that a higher proportion of low-income countries have social distancing interventions planned in the case of a pandemic, compared to high income European [3, 4, 6, 8, 47, 48] Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered in this study due to cost and delivery issues found with low-income countries. [4, 8] Consideration may need to be given to some form of antiviral agent use, possibly for case treatment, given the poor performance of purely social distancing interventions in developing countries as suggested by this study. The advantage of antiviral use is that it may be targeted at reducing within-household transmission, a location of transmission otherwise not impacted by social distancing interventions.\n\nThe present study shows that larger numbers of transmissions occur within households due to the larger household sizes in countries such as PNG. Furthermore, low-income countries generally have population health profiles not seen in developed countries, including the prevalence of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. [49] Antiviral treatment of influenza cases co-infected with such diseases may be an appropriate intervention strategy given the poorer health outcomes which co-morbidity may impose. [12] The provision and use of antiviral agents will have challenges not faced by industrialised countries, due to the cost of providing an antiviral stockpile and subsequent distribution of antivirals in countries which have health systems already stretched to capacity. [15] The importance of suitable pandemic influenza preparedness plans for low-income countries is recognized by the WHO [50, 51]. Disease transmission models will play a role in guiding policy makers in determining the effectiveness of possible pandemic countermeasures. History tells us that low-income countries are likely to be more affected, yet almost all models deal with mitigation strategies for developed nations with good health infrastructure and low prevalence of endemic diseases. These countries have poorer access to antiviral drug and vaccine-based interventions and higher extant disease burdens, compared to developed countries. For the reasons, development of appropriate intervention strategies focused on countries such as PNG needs to occur. \n\nObjectives The possible occurrence of a highly pathogenic influenza strain is of concern to health authorities worldwide. It is known that during past influenza pandemics developing countries have experienced considerably higher mortality rates compared to developed countries. Furthermore, many developing countries lack appropriate pandemic preparedness plans. Mathematical modelling studies to guide the development of such plans are largely focused on predicting pandemic influenza spread in developed nations. However, intervention strategies shown by modelling studies to be highly effective for developed countries give limited guidance as to the impact which an influenza pandemic may have on low-income countries given different demographics and resource constraints. To address this, an individual-based model of a Papua New Guinean community was created and used to simulate the spread of a novel influenza strain. The results were compared to those obtained from a comparable Australian model.\n\nDesign A modelling study.\n\nSetting The towns of Madang in Papua New Guinea (population ~35,000) and Albany (population ~30,000) in Australia.\n\nOutcome measures Daily and cumulative illness attack rates in both models following introduction of a novel influenza strain into a naive population, for an unmitigated scenario and two social distancing intervention scenarios.\n\nThe unmitigated scenario indicated an approximately 50% higher attack rate in PNG compared to the Australian model. The two social distancing-based interventions strategies were 60% -70% less effective in a PNG setting compared to an Australian setting.\n\nConclusions This study provides further evidence that an influenza pandemic occurring in a low-income country such as PNG may have a greater impact than one occurring in a developed country, and that PNG-feasible interventions may be substantially less effective. The larger average household size in PNG, the larger proportion of the population under 18 and greater community-wide contact all contribute to this feature. Strength and limitations of this study The findings are a first step in understanding how an influenza pandemic will impact on a low-income country.\n\nAs with all modelling studies obtaining high-quality field data with which to \"populate\" models is crucial and accessing such data in countries such as PNG is a challenge. These results and those from future research will permit better pandemic planning and allow intervention strategies to be tailored to the specific demographics and resource constraints found in developing countries. [1] and the possible occurrence of a highly pathogenic virus strain is of concern to health authorities worldwide.\n\nIt has been shown under laboratory conditions that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza strain may re-assort or mutate to become readily transmissible between humans. [2] In response to the threat of influenza pandemics, most countries have developed pandemic preparedness plans. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However the level of completeness of these plans with regards to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [9] varies dramatically between developed high income countries and developing, low-income countries. [7, 8] Low-income countries suffer the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from influenza pandemics. Data from the 1918/19 pandemic suggests much higher mortality rates in India compared to Europe and the USA. While in northern Europe and the USA mortality rates were consistently below 1%, over 4.3% average mortality was reported from India, with some Indian provinces exceeding mortality rates of 7%. [10, 11] Even in the mild H1N1 pandemic of 2009, 59% of the estimated 284,500 deaths occurred in Africa and South-East Asia. [2] These differences are most likely due to the significant association of influenza mortality with comorbidities usually absent in the developed countries (such as chronic malnutrition, malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia and HIV). [12] Furthermore it has been shown that the increased mortality rate due to an influenza pandemic is strongly associated with per capita income. [11] It is apparent that the burden of the next pandemic will also be focused overwhelmingly on the developing world, a point made by the WHO and others. [5, 11, [13] [14] [15] A substantial number of pandemic influenza models have been constructed in the past decade. A key goal of this effort is to determine the effectiveness of interventions, in terms of their ability to reduce infection and consequential mortality rates. Although it has been recognized that the major burden of mortality from influenza pandemics is suffered by low-income countries [5, 11, 16] the primary focus of the vast majority of these models is on examining intervention effectiveness in developed (e.g., the USA and European countries [17] [18] [19] [20] ) and middle income countries (e.g., Thailand [21, 22] ). Given the markedly different demographic and community structure, as well as resource and infrastructural constraints in comparison with developed countries, these models have limited capability to predict the impact of an influenza pandemic on low-income countries [23] . In addition, many low-income countries are located in tropical or subtropical regions where the timing and impact of influenza epidemics are more poorly understood than in temperate regions, where they are known to have a well-defined winter season. [15] To address this 'modelling gap' an individual-based disease transmission model of pandemic influenza has been developed for Papua New Guinea (PNG), based on the methods used previously to develop a pandemic influenza model of Albany, Western 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 The model was used to describe the spread of a novel influenza strain after introduction into the community. The resulting illness attack rate was determined together with data indicating where person-to-person transmission occurred. An unmitigated outbreak and two outbreaks with PNG-feasible intervention strategies activated were simulated and the results compared to those obtained using the Albany, Australia model.\n\nCensus and country-wide data from the PNG National Statistics Office [27] together with data collected in a field survey in Madang were used to construct the Madang model. Following the methodology used to construct the Albany model, each household is explicitly represented, with occupants in one of 7 age categories. Schools, workplace and other mixing hubs were also explicitly represented. Individuals were allocated to these mixing hubs according to their age category, so connecting households and hubs as shown in Figure 1 . Using virus intrinsic transmission characteristics calibrated with the Australian model, simulations were performed using the Madang model. These simulations captured the day-to-day susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered/immune infection profile of the population following introduction of a novel strain of influenza into the modelled community, assuming no existing immunity. [28] Madang Demographics\n\nMadang model development used the most recent census data from 2001, other PNG government data and additional data collected in our field survey. [29] Census data provided the location groups of approximately 50 adjacent households, known as the census unit (CU). The specific demographics of each household in Madang in terms of number of individuals, their ages and occupation of adults was also provided by the census and each individual is uniquely identified in the model.\n\nFrom July to September 2011 we also conducted a survey in Madang to obtain data on the number of people working in smaller workplaces, school class sizes, market sizes, and the number of people attending the major tertiary education centres in Madang (Divine Word University (DWU), Madang Teachers College, Madang Technical College and Madang Maritime College). We asked the headmasters of schools and colleges, the human resource department at DWU and business owners of small to medium scale businesses about the respective numbers and, if no records existed relied on their estimates. We also obtained estimates on the size of informal 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Table A1 (Supplementary Data  File) .\n\nThese data allowed for the construction of an explicit contact network linking households, schools, workplaces and other meeting places by allocating individuals to workplaces and schools, as with the Albany model [10] .\n\nThe model captures explicit person-to-person contact with the contact network describing population mobility occurring between households, schools, workplaces and the wider community as shown in Figure 1 . The virus spreads through the community due to this mobility, as transmission occurs between individuals when they are co-located, possibly following a move from one location to another.\n\nThe number of contacts made by each individual each day in school, work and community settings were adjusted to reproduce the proportion of cases occurring in different settings as reported by empirical studies, specifically 40% of infections occurred in households, 30% in schools and workplaces, and 30% in the wider community. [30] [31] [32] Contacts within schools and workplaces occurred in fixed-size mixing groups of maximum size 10. Within mixing groups contact was assumed to be homogeneous. Community contacts occurred between randomly selected individuals, weighted toward pairs of individuals located in neighbouring households.\n\nEach household contains uniquely identified individuals. Children and adults are assigned by an allocation algorithm to school classes and workplaces according to age based on class sizes and employee numbers obtained in the field survey. The field survey described above revealed that 50% of school-age children do not attend school, and this percentage is thought to be similar to most urban areas in PNG, with still lower rates in rural areas. Of those children not attending school 50% are allocated to neighbourhood hubs, as described below. In addition to contact occurring in households and mixing hubs, community contact is introduced to capture mixing which occurs outwith these locales and in the wider community. The community contact occurs at a fixed rate, similarly to the Albany model.\n\nCensus data provided the occupation/activity of individuals, namely 'wage-job', 'garden', 'business' and 'unemployed'. This was used to locate individuals denoted as wage-job with known workplaces. The numbers in this census category exceeded those found in the survey of major workplaces and knowledge of Madang suggested the creation of small, local workplaces to locate these additional adults and those in the business category. Adults with garden as their occupation work in family-owned gardens, subsistence farming and generating produce for sale. For each household 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   7 containing a garden worker, a garden workplace was created whose members matched those of the household.\n\nThree significant populations in Madang were not counted in the 2001 census, namely those in settlements (unofficial housing areas also found in other parts of the developing world), those in the University and Chinese workers at a mine/processing site on the edge of town. The field survey provided numbers resident in each of these locations: the two settlement areas in Madang with ~750 inhabitants each; ~3,000 students and staff living in hostels at the Divine Word University (a further ~280 live in households in town and appeared in the census); and ~650 overseas workers accommodated in hostels at the mine/processing site.\n\nTo model the settlements new households were created and individuals allocated to mixing hubs to match overall Madang demographics. The populations at the University and the mine-site had virtual households created to replicate friendship groups of average size 7, and these locations were also designated as the workplace for these individuals. Contact between the wider Madang population and those at the University involved household and neighbourhood contacts for local students and staff living in town while resident staff and students were restricted to community contact. Contact between the mine-site and the town was also restricted to community contact.\n\nCensus data classified a significant proportion (16.2%) of adults as unemployed and not attending a designated workplace [27] . Knowledge gathered from the field survey in Madang indicated that these adults do have daytime contact with others outwith the home, such as working or visiting the two informal markets. To address this feature an additional daytime contact location (neighbourhood hubs) was introduced, with unemployed adults in each census unit allocated to neighbourhood hubs of 10 individuals. In addition, these hubs also have 25% of all local school age pupils allocated to them, accounting for half of the 50% of school age children which do not attend school.\n\nThe introduction of neighbourhood hubs, which do not exist in the Albany model, give a model which the field survey and local knowledge indicates is representative of the contact patterns found in urban PNG. A Madang model which omits neighbourhood hubs, called Madang-nnh (no neighbourhood hubs), is also used in the simulation experiments and the resulting attack rates are presented in Table 1 . This allows influenza spread dynamics within the three models to be compared and indicates the sensitivity of the Madang model to the presence of the neighbourhood hubs.\n\nThe numbers of individuals in each of the daytime locations for the Albany, Madang and Madang-nnh models are presented in Table A1 in the Supplementary Data File. Additional information on the data used to construct the Madang model is given in [33] . 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\nEach individual has their influenza infection history modelled using an SEIR approach and are in one of 4 infection states, namely susceptible, exposed, infectious, or recovered and thus immune [28] . The passage of infection in each individual reflects the known time-changing infectiousness profile (that is, virus shedding [34] ) of influenza at two discrete points-of-time every 24 hours, during a day-time and a night-time period.\n\nDisease transmission is realised using a probabilistic transmission function, implemented by the simulation algorithm. Together with mobility data, the transmission function captures disease spread throughout the modelled community and may be adjusted to reflect pandemics with various transmission characteristics, corresponding to the basic reproduction number R0 of a particular influenza strain, as discussed further in [20, 24, 25] .\n\nIt is assumed that infection transmission may occur when an infectious and a susceptible individual come into contact, in a stochastic fashion. Once infected, an individual progresses through a series of infection states according to a fixed timeline, taking them from susceptible, to exposed state, to infectious and then to an immune, recovered state [28] .\n\nThe probability that an infectious individual infects a susceptible was calculated using the following function.\n\nThe factors which determine probability of transmission from an infectious individual (Ii) to a susceptible individual (Is) are the basic virus transmissibility (\u03b2v), the age-based susceptibility of Is the current level of infectiousness of Ii, and, if the contact between Ii and Is occurs in a household, the household size Household(Ii, Is). Details of the household size factor are given below; further details of the influenza transmission model can be found in [35] .\n\nTo achieve simulations for a particular basic reproduction number R0, \u03b2v was adjusted; details of the procedure for estimating \u03b2v and R0 are given in [20] . A pandemic with a basic reproduction number of 1.5 is used in this study, and corresponds to some estimations of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [36] [37] [38] [39] and the 1957 and 1968 pandemics [40, 41] . Since it is virus intrinsic, we assumed that \u03b2v was similar in Madang and thus calculated R0 in the Madang and Madang-nnh models using the \u03b2v corresponding to an R0 of 1.5 in the Albany model. Details of parameter settings used in each model are given in Table A2 in the Supplementary Data File. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   9 A simulation algorithm, realised in the C++ programming language, manipulates the underlying demographic model and captures both population mobility and the timechanging infectivity profile of each individual. Each individual has their infectivity status denoted by one of the four (S,E,I,R) states at any time point during the duration of the simulated period. The simulation algorithm captures the state of the whole population twice per day, a daytime point-in-time snapshot and an evening snapshot, with individuals (possibly) moving locations between successive day or night periods, such as household to school or workplace for the day phase, returning to home for the night period. Individuals come into contact with other individuals on a one-to-one basis in each location, with possible influenza transmission then occurring.\n\nIndividuals in each household and contact hub make contacts within a close-contact mixing group, taken to be the entire household or a subset of larger hubs, and also make additional non hub-based random community contacts. The individual-toindividual transmission probability in larger households was moderated by household size using data from a study by Cauchemez et al [42] . The reduction of the probability of within-household transmission with household size is also shown in Figure A1 in the Supplementary Data File. This reflects the assumed reduction in pairwise contact in households with greater than 3 members and is significant in the Madang context, where the average household size is 6.32 compared to 2.54 in Albany.\n\nUsing the contact, mobility and transmission features described above, stochastic simulations of influenza spread in Madang were conducted. All simulations were repeated 40 times with random numbers controlling the outcome of stochastic events (the locality of seeded infected individuals and the probability of transmission) and the results were averaged. Analysis of this simulation model has shown that the 40-run mean attack rate is highly unlikely (95% confidence) to differ by more than 1.2% from the mean attack rate of a much larger set of experiment repeats. [20] Where 95% confidence intervals are reported in the results, these were calculated from the mean and standard deviation of 40 randomly seeded simulation runs, using the normal approximation method.\n\nOne new infection per day was introduced into the population during the whole period of the simulations, and randomly allocated to a household. This seeding assumption of 1 case per day was chosen to reliably begin a local epidemic in every stochastic simulation. For the transmission characteristics described above, analysis shows that seeding at this rate for 7 days results in a sustained epidemic in >97% of the simulation runs and 100% with two weeks of seeding, with higher percentages for the higher transmissibility scenarios. Seeding at this rate is continued throughout the simulation in order to capture the case where an epidemic may be initially suppressed by a rigorous intervention strategy, but may subsequently break out if intervention measures are relaxed. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 After the beginning of a sustained local epidemic, any subsequent variation in the amount of seeding has very little effect on the progress of the local epidemic, as the number of imported cases is much smaller than those generated by the local epidemic. Preliminary analyses using the present model have shown that even if the seeding rate is increased to 5 infections per day, after 7 days the number of infections generated from the self-sustained local epidemic is twice the number of imported infections, and by 14 days local infections outnumber imported infections by a factor of 8.\n\nThe simulation period was divided into 12 hour day/night periods and during each period a nominal location for each individual was determined. This took into consideration the cycle type (day/night, weekday/weekend), infection state of each individual and whether child supervision was needed to look after a child at home. Individuals occupying the same location during the same time period were assumed to come into potential infective contact. Details of the simulation procedure are presented in [20] .\n\nThe effectiveness of social distancing interventions, such as school or workplace closure, may be quantified by comparing the passage of the influenza virus in the community with and without interventions activated, and presented as the reduction in the daily and cumulative illness attack rates. Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered as antiviral agents may only be available in limited quantities in a PNG setting, whilst a vaccination campaign would face significant delay, supply and delivery constraints. Two intervention strategies considered feasible in a PNG setting were examined. These were: school closure involving all schools, with home isolation of all affected children; and a more rigorous strategy involving school closure coupled with 50% reductions in community-wide contact, workplace participation, and contact in neighbourhood hubs.\n\nBoth Madang models, (with and without neighbourhood hubs), were used to compare a pandemic in PNG with one occurring in Albany, Australia. Simulations were conducted involving: no interventions; only school closure applied; and rigorous social distancing, for each of the three models.\n\nGeneral comparative trends are presented in Table 1 , were the Albany and Madang models are compared. For a pandemic in a developed country setting having a basic reproduction number R0 of 1.5 and an illness attack rate of 31.7%, the same pandemic characteristics applied in a PNG setting with no interventions activated resulted in higher rates of influenza transmission, with an attack rate of 46.6% and reproduction number R0 = 1.88 (Table 1) . Comparing the attack rates when interventions were activated, both intervention strategies (solely school closure and 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Tables 1 and 2 . It should be noted that the Madang model with neighbourhood hubs included is believed to be more representative of population mixing characteristics in PNG, following local knowledge. Neighbourhood hubs were introduced to reflect the known mixing patterns occurring with adults not working in designated workplaces, such as found in the regular contact which may occur among individuals in marketplaces. The addition of such contact hubs increased individual-to-individual contacts and hence infection transmission opportunities (see Table 2 ) with approximately 2,000 additional symptomatic infections resulting, for all three (mitigated and non-mitigated) scenarios. In terms of cumulative illness attack rate, the Madang model gave a basic reproduction number R0 of 1.88 and an illness attack rate of 46.6%, compared to that of the Madang-nnh (no neighbourhood hub) model with R0 = 1.74 and an illness attack rate of 40.8%. The daily case incidence resulting from simulating the Albany, Madang and Madang-nnh models is presented in Figure 2 for the three scenarios. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 It is apparent from the results presented in Table 1 that there is a greater proportion of influenza cases occurring within households in both Madang models 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 note that Madang has a total population of ~35,000 compared to ~30,000 in Albany.\n\nThe school closure intervention in the Madang model is found to be approximately 5 times less effective compared to that of the Albany model. Simulation results suggest a 9.4% reduction (46.6% to 42.2%) in the illness attack rate can be achieved in Madang due to school closure whereas a 48.6% reduction (31.7% to 16.3%) can be achieved in Albany (see Table 1 ). For the Madang-nnh (no neighbourhood hub) model, school closure is approximately 3.5 times less effective compared to the Albany model. Table 2 (middle panel) indicates an illness attack rate of ~15,000 in Madang compared to ~4,800 in Albany. Much higher case numbers occur in households, workplaces and the wider community (including neighbourhood hubs) than in Albany, highlighting the poorer efficacy of this intervention strategy in a PNG setting. The Madang-nnh model also results in higher household and workplace transmission than the Albany model. Note that while there is a significantly higher proportion of under 17 year old children in Madang (40%) compared to Albany (28%), our field survey indicates that 50% of school age children in Madang do not attend school, hence school closure is less effective in disrupting the transmission chain (i.e., household 1-to-school-to-household 2) compared to Australia. This feature is also present in the rigorous social distancing intervention.\n\nPrevious simulation studies [20, 43, 44] show that rigorous social distancing interventions involving school closure coupled to contact reductions in other locations may be highly effective in reducing the attack rate within a developed country setting. Comparing the effectiveness of rigorous social distancing between the Albany and Madang models, an ~83% reduction (from 31.7% to 5.4%) reduction may be achieved in Albany whereas a smaller ~62.7% reduction (from 46.6%% to 17.4%), is achieved in the Madang model; see Table 1 . In the Madangnnh model a ~69.4% reduction in the attack rate (40.8% to 12.5%) can be achieved by this rigorous social distancing intervention. These results suggest that both social distancing strategies are much less effective in a PNG setting compared to what might be achieved in a developed country. Figure 2 also reveals this clear trend, with peak case incidence and the area under the curves (the attack rate) being higher in both Madang models compared to the Albany model.\n\nThe sensitivity of key model parameters, such as school contact group size, illness withdrawal rates and intervention duration have been extensively examined for the Albany model [44, 45] . These indicate that while the model is sensitive to some parameter settings, the relative effectiveness of social distancing interventions remains unchanged, a feature also shared by the Madang models.\n\nThe major difference between the Albany and Madang models is the presence of neighbourhood hubs. We have included a Madang model which has no neighbourhood hubs (Madang-nnh), and present comparative results for all three models in Tables 1 and 2, Figure 2 and Tables A3-A6 (Supplementary Data File).\n\nSimulations comparing neighbourhood mixing group sizes 10 (baseline), 20 and 30 indicate that for hubs of size 20 and 30, the increased transmission results in higher attack rates, as expected (see Table A3 , Supplementary Data File).\n\nThe effect of varying compliance with home isolation of school children following school closure on attack rate was examined. Compliance was reduced from 100% to 50%. Reduced compliance increased the attack rate in Albany as those children affected made additional daytime contacts with other children. In Madang, the reduction in compliance had only minimal effect since approximately 50% of school age children do not attend school and continue to make daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs (see Table A4 , Supplementary Data File).\n\nThe effect of using different probabilities of voluntary withdrawal to the home of symptomatic adults and children is presented in Table A5 . Lower rates of voluntary withdrawal lead to higher attack rates in all three models. Voluntary withdrawal from work or school has a more pronounced effect in the Albany model, as a significant proportion of children in Madang still transmit through daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs.\n\nThe effects of variation of the timing of intervention initiation are presented in Table  A6 . In the school closure scenario, delayed response had the most severe impact on the attack rates in Albany, whereas for the Madang models the changes in attack rate were marginal. This is again due to a large fraction of children not attending school and the existence of neighbourhood hubs. Similarly, in the rigorous contact reduction scenario the effect of delayed response on attack rate was more \n\nIntroduction of a pandemic influenza strain with identical transmissibility characteristics results in a significantly higher infection and illness rate in a PNG setting when compared to that of a developed country. Social distancing intervention strategies suitable for a developing country may be significantly less effective in reducing the attack rate when compared to the outcomes expected in an Australian setting. Substantially more infections occurred in PNG households compared to that of the Australian model. The significantly larger size of households, a feature shared by many developing countries, together with higher community-wide contact in PNG, contributed to the higher infection rates.\n\nInterventions are less effective in a PNG setting since they are not targeted at household transmission, and given the larger household sizes, are applicable to a smaller proportion of transmissions compared to the Australian scenario. In addition, as only half the school-age children in Madang attend school, the two school closure based interventions impact fewer individuals.\n\nWhile care was taken to obtain detailed data used to populate the Madang and Albany models, government data was found to be more limited in PNG. While a field survey was conducted in Madang to fill in missing data and make the models as directly comparable as possible, there is still scope for conducting further data collection. As with all modelling studies, the accuracy of results is limited by the quality of data used to construct the model. In the case of influenza epidemic modelling, outcomes are dependent on assumptions about the number, duration and physical closeness of contacts between people, and how these attributes of contact affect transmission probability. These data are very difficult to estimate, with the best data source available being [46] . In the absence of high-quality reliable data, we have made plausible assumptions regarding interpersonal contact, and, in the Albany case, these are reflective of the data in [46] .\n\nThe lack of similar low-income modelling studies prevents comparison with related studies, and suggests that this is an area requiring further attention. Research studies expanding on that reported here suggest themselves: the construction and use of a number of additional PNG models capturing different population structures, such as rural villages and island communities; and the determination of health outcomes following a moderately severe influenza pandemic, taking into account comorbidities with extant diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, diseases common to many low-income countries.\n\nThe interventions used in the present study are based on social distancing. Surveys have shown that a higher proportion of low-income countries have social distancing interventions planned in the case of a pandemic, compared to high income European 17 countries due to their feasibility and cost-effectiveness. [3, 4, 6, 8, 47, 48] Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered in this study due to cost and delivery issues found with low-income countries. [4, 8] Consideration may need to be given to some form of antiviral agent use, possibly for case treatment, given the poor performance of purely social distancing interventions in developing countries as suggested by this study. The advantage of antiviral use is that it may be targeted at reducing within-household transmission, a location of transmission otherwise not impacted by social distancing interventions. The present study shows that larger numbers of transmissions occur within households due to the larger household sizes in countries such as PNG. Furthermore, low-income countries generally have population health profiles not seen in developed countries, including the prevalence of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. [49] Antiviral treatment of influenza cases co-infected with such diseases may be an appropriate intervention strategy given the poorer health outcomes which co-morbidity may impose. [12] The provision and use of antiviral agents will have challenges not faced by industrialised countries, due to the cost of providing an antiviral stockpile and subsequent distribution of antivirals in countries which have health systems already stretched to capacity. [15] The importance of suitable pandemic influenza preparedness plans for low-income countries is recognized by the WHO [50, 51]. Disease transmission models will play a role in guiding policy makers in determining the effectiveness of possible pandemic countermeasures. History tells us that low-income countries are likely to be more affected, yet almost all models deal with mitigation strategies for developed nations with good health infrastructure and low prevalence of endemic diseases. These countries have poorer access to antiviral drug and vaccine-based interventions and higher extant disease burdens, compared to developed countries. For the reasons, development of appropriate intervention strategies focused on countries such as PNG needs to occur. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 (top table) , Madang (centre table) and Madang-nnh (bottom table) models are presented. One of the key differences between the Albany and the Madang models is that ~50% of school age children do not attend school in Madang compared to Albany. There are ~8900 school age children in Madang among which ~4300 do not attend school. Another key difference is ~5700 individuals (including unemployed adults and the ~50% of children not attending school) in Madang are assumed to mix in neighbourhood hubs. If no neighbourhood hubs are included, then the individuals who are in neighbourhood hubs in the Madang model in daytime would mix only in their households, as in the Madangnnh model. The baseline assumption in the main results is that individuals in neighbourhood hubs mix with 10 other individuals. If this value is assumed to be 20 or 30 individuals, additional contacts gives increased transmission and results in higher final attack rates. The table gives the final attack rate and their corresponding 95% CI (presented in parentheses, shaded rows) for the Madang model for the no intervention, school closure, and rigorous social distancing scenarios, under the assumption that the neighbourhood group size is 10, 20 or 30 individuals. Compliance with home isolation of school children following school closure intervention has been examined and compliance reduction from 100% to 50% considered. Effects of reduced compliances on the illness attack rates and their corresponding 95% CI (in parentheses, shaded rows) are presented in Table A4 . For the purely school closure intervention, the illness attack rate increases by ~3% in Albany as reduced isolation permits additional child-to-child contact. In the Madang models, reduced compliance with home isolation during the period of school closure has minimal effect on the attack rate. This is due to ~50% school age children not attending school. In all three models, reduced compliance has minimal effect if additional rigorous social distancing interventions are also applied. Alternative intervention activation timing assumptions for school closure, workforce reduction and community contact reduction are examined and two different settings are considered. Effects of these alternative assumptions on the illness attack rates and their corresponding 95% CI (in parentheses, shaded rows) are presented. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 "}
