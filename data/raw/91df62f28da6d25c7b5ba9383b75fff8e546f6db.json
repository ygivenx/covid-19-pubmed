{"title": "Electronic supplementary material Implications of asymptomatic carriers for infectious disease transmission and control", "body": "To determine the basic reproduction number we follow the next-generation method outlined in [1] . We construct the linearised infection subsystem from the system of equations (1) which describes only the production of new infecteds and changes in the states of already existing infecteds from the disease-free steady state (where S = N ) so that where the matrix T incorporates all epidemiological events that lead to new infections, and all other events are included in the matrix \u03a3 so that\n\nand\n\nThe next generation matrix K is then given by \u03b3\u03c4 +\u03be\u03b3(\u03b3+\u03c9) \u03b1\u03b2(\u03c4 +\u03b7(\u03b3+\u03c9)) \u03b3\u03c4 +\u03be\u03b3(\u03b3+\u03c9) \u03b1\u03b2(\u03be\u03b3+\u03c4 +\u03b7\u03c9) \u03b3\u03c4 +\u03be\u03b3 (\u03b3+\u03c9) . The elements K ij of the next generation matrix K can be interpreted as the expected number of new cases that an infected individual of type j causes among the susceptible individuals of type i, in a fully susceptible population. Thus, the expected number of new cases of infection due to a carrier is K 11 + K 21 . Similarly, a newly symptomatic host is expected to cause K 12 + K 22 new cases in a fully susceptible population.\n\nThe dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix K is equal to the basic reproduction number R 0 . Hence,\n\nThis expression for R 0 can be decomposed into the form shown in equation (2) to reveal the contribution to R 0 from symptomatic infections versus asymptomatic carriers.\n\nIn the main text we derive the following expression for the relative endemic prevalence P of asymptomatic carriers to symptomatic infections\n\nHere, we show how the basic reproduction number R 0 depends on P. From equation (S4) we see that\n\nBoth R 0 and P determine the respective endemic infection-type prevalencesP C andP I , which are found by setting the system of equations (1) to zero so that\n\nBy substituting\u015c = N \u2212\u00ce \u2212\u0108, \u03bb(\u0108,\u00ce) = \u03b2(\u03b7\u0108 +\u00ce) and\u0108 = P\u00ce into the second expression in equation (S5) we see that\n\nDividing by\u00ce, this becomes\n\nwhich after some rearrangement give\u015d\n\nand soP\n\nOne could also substitute\u015c = N \u2212\u00ce \u2212\u0108, \u03bb(\u0108,\u00ce) = \u03b2(\u03b7\u0108 +\u00ce) and\u0108 = P\u00ce into the first expression in equation (S5) to obtain the same result. Finally, we show that R 0 is a threshold for global stability of the disease-free steady state to rule out the possibility of backward bifurcation. Following the method outlined in [2] , we re-write the system of equations (1) in the form\n\nHere, denotes differentiation with respect to time; x = (C, I) T \u2208 R 2 and y = S \u2208 R; F = (F 1 , F 2 ) T and V = (V 1 , V 2 ) T , where F i represents the rate of new infections in compartment i; and V i represents the transition terms in compartment i such that\n\nWe note that the feasible region \u0393 = {(S, I, C) \u2208 R 3 + |S + I + C = N } is positively invariant with respect to (S6). The model (S6) always admits a disease-free equilibrium (S, I, C) = (N, 0, 0) \u2208 \u0393. An endemic equilibrium (S, I, C) = (\u015c,\u00ce,\u0108) \u2208 \u0393 exists if and only if the basic reproduction number R 0 > 1 with\u015c = N/R 0 ,\n\nWe set\n\nwhere T and \u03a3 are defined as above, which satisfies\n\nis irreducible, then by Theorem 2.2 in [2] , the disease-free equilibrium (S, I, C) = (N, 0, 0) is globally asymptotically stable in \u0393 provided that R 0 < 1.\n\nAccounting for demography in the system of equations that describe our model is straightforward. We simply replace the recovery rates \u03b3 and \u03be\u03b3 with the respective rates \u03b3 + \u00b5 and \u03be\u03b3 + \u00b5 that include a contribution \u00b5 which is the per capita rate of host death in the model for each host type. Here we are assuming that this death rate balances the birth rate so that the total population size N remains constant.\n\nIn this case, the basic reproduction number becomes,\n\nthe relative reproduction potential of asymptomatic carriers is\n\nand the relative endemic prevalence of asymptomatic carriers is\n\nThe form of all other equations in the main text remain the same with the above expressions for R 0 , A, and P substituted in. Hence, our results regarding the impacts of carriage on predictions from epidemiological models do not change when we consider pathogens whose timescale of disease is comparable to the timescale of host demographic change.\n\nThe effect of asymptomatic carriers on predictions of the endemic prevalence of symptomatic infectionsP I . Here we compare the endemic prevalence of symptomatic infections predicted using the full modelP I to that of the SIS modelP SIS when \u03b2 SIS = \u03b2 and \u03b3 SIS = \u03b3. We only consider the case where R 0,SIS > 1 and R 0 > 1 so that the endemic equilibrium in both models is stable and biologically meaningful. It is straightforward to show thatP SIS >P I when\n\nThis condition always holds true when A < 1. Therefore, when the host-specific reproduction number of asymptomatic carriers is less than that of symptomatically infected hosts, excluding asymptomatic carriers from our model will always lead to overestimating the endemic prevalence of symptomatic infections. If instead A > 1, then it is possible that the SIS model will underestimate the endemic level of disease.\n\nHow can infrequent asymptomatic carriers play a key role in pathogen transmission? To understand how asymptomatic carriers can contribute the most to transmission at endemic equilibrium while remaining less prevalent than symptomatically infected hosts we consider the endemic incidence of infection \u2126, which is the total number of new cases of infection (both symptomatic infection and asymptomatic carriage) per unit time at endemic equilibrium. In our model, it is identified from the system of equations (1) as\u03a9\n\nwhere\u03a9 C is the contribution to the endemic incidence of infection by asymptomatic carriers, and\u03a9 I is the contribution by symptomatic infectives such that \u2126 C = \u03b2\u03b7\u015c\u0108/N and\u03a9 I = \u03b2\u015c\u00ce/N.\n\nClearly, asymptomatic carriers contribute more to the endemic incidence when\u03a9 C >\u03a9 I which holds true when \u03b7P > 1. Thus, asymptomatic carriers can be responsible for the majority of endemic transmissions whilst remaining in the minority (in terms of prevalence) when\n\nwhich is only possible if asymptomatic carriers have a sufficiently greater infectivity than symptomatic infectives. Hence, even if the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers is grossly outweighed by that of symptomatic infectives, it is still possible for asymptomatic carriers to be playing a key role in pathogen transmission.\n\nThe impact of control interventions on the endemic prevalence of symptomatic infection\u015d P I . Here we explore how interventions may change the endemic prevalence of symptomatic infectionsP I . Again, we only consider the case where R 0 > 1 so that the endemic equilibrium is stable and biologically meaningful. It is straightforward to show that\n\nTherefore \u2202P I /\u2202x > 0 when\n\nFor the parameters x \u2208 {\u03b2, \u03b7}, condition (S17) always holds true since \u2202P/\u2202x = 0 and \u2202R 0 /\u2202x > 0 for all x \u2208 {\u03b2, \u03b7}. This makes intuitive sense since increasing the infectivity of either infection type (through increasing \u03b2 or \u03b7) will always result in more cases of both infection types. For all other parameters, the effect of interventions on the endemic prevalence of symptomatic infectionsP I is more complicated. For the parameters x \u2208 {\u03b3, \u03be\u03b3}, both \u2202R 0 /\u2202x < 0 and \u2202P/\u2202x < 0 always holds true. Therefore, an intervention that alters the clearance rate of carriage or symptomatic infection (that is, either \u03b3 or \u03be\u03b3) may either increase or decreaseP I , depending on whether condition (S17) is satisfied.\n\nFor x \u2208 {\u03c9}, \u2202P I /\u2202x < 0 when A < 1 since \u2202P/\u2202x > 0 always holds true and \u2202R 0 /\u2202x < 0 for x \u2208 {\u03c9} if and only if A < 1. However, if A > 1 then an intervention that alters \u03c9 may either increase or decreaseP I , depending on whether condition (S17) is satisfied. For x \u2208 {\u03c4, \u03b1}, \u2202P I /\u2202x > 0 when A < 1 since \u2202P/\u2202x < 0 always holds true and \u2202R 0 /\u2202x > 0 for x \u2208 {\u03c4, \u03b1} if and only if A < 1. However, if A > 1 then an intervention that alters \u03c4 or \u03b1 may either increase or decreaseP I , depending on whether condition (S17) is satisfied. Therefore, when asymptomatic carriers have less potential for infection reproduction than symptomatic infectives (so that A < 1), decreasing the relative frequency of appearance of symptomatic infectives (by decreasing \u03c4 or \u03b1, or increasing \u03c9) will always result in a lower endemic prevalence of diseaseP I . If, on the other hand, asymptomatic carriers have a higher reproduction potential (so that A > 1), then decreasing the relative frequency of appearance of symptomatic infectives may actually increase the endemic prevalence of diseaseP I . Figure S1 : Initial categorisation of the generic carriage models identified in the literature review. Models are separated into those which do not allow reinfection (top) and those that do allow reinfection (bottom). Models are then sorted according to the transitions between C and I so that models in column 1 have no transitions between C and I, column 2 has models with the C \u2192 I transition only, column 3 has models with the I \u2192 C transition only, and column 4 has models with both C \u2192 I and I \u2192 C transitions. The articles identified in the review using the model structures shown here are as follows. Reinfection not possible: (1a) [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] (2a) [3] (2b) [8, 9] (2c) [3] (3a) [10, 11] (3b) [12, 13, 14, 15] (4a) [16] (4b) [17] . Reinfection possible: (1a) [18] (1b) [19, 20, 21, 22, 23] (1c) [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30] (2a) [31] (2b) [21] (2c) [32] (3a) [33] (3b) [34] (3c) [35] (4a) [36] (4b) [37] (4c) [38, 39, 40] (4d) [41] (4e) [42, 43] (4f) [44] . Figure S2 : The basic reproduction number R 0 is shown as a function of the relative reproduction potential of asymptomatic carriers A (vertical axis) and the progression rate to symptomatic infection \u03c4 (horizontal axis). The dashed red lines indicate directions where R 0 is increasing, while the solid white and black lines indicate contours where R 0 is constant. It is clear that the slope of R 0 in the direction of \u03c4 is dependent on whether A > 1 or A < 1. Parameter values are provided in appendix E. Figure S3 : The endemic prevalence of asymptomatic carriersP C (a,d,g), symptomatic infectionsP I (b,e,h), and total endemic prevalenceP (c,f,i) is shown before (B) and after (A) an intervention when A < 1 (blue) and when A > 1 (red). These scenarios correspond to those shown in Figure 4 in the main text. (a-c) The intervention increases \u03c9; (d-f) The intervention decreases \u03c4 ; and (g-i) The intervention decreases \u03b1. Parameter values are provided in appendix E. Figure S4 : The endemic relative prevalence of asymptomatic carriers compared to symptomatic infections P (a), endemic prevalence of symptomatic infectionsP I (b), and total endemic prevalenceP (c) are shown before (B) and after (A) an intervention that reduces \u03b1. Here, the intervention increases the relative prevalence of asymptomatic carriers and the absolute prevalence of symptomatic infections. Parameter values are provided in appendix E."}
