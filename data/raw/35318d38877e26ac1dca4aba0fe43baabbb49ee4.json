{"title": "Nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the membrane protein of human coronavirus 229 E Brief Report", "body": "The coronaviruses are a group of positive strand RNA viruses that cause a wide spectrum of disease in mammals and birds [21] . The human coronaviruses are though to cause 10-20% of all common colds, and about half of these are associated with the human coronavirus strain HCV 229 E [4, 5] . The HCV 229 E virion is comprised ofa genomic RNA of approximately 6 x 106 molecular weight (mol.wt), a lipid envelope and three major proteins; a phosphorylated protein of 50,000mol.wt. associated with the genome, a glycosylated 180,000 mol.wt, protein and a family of polypeptides with estimated molecular weights of 25,000, 23,000, and 21,000 [7, 16] . It is clear that these proteins represent the nucleocapsid (N), surface (S) and membrane (M) proteins characteristic of coronaviruses [reviewed in 19] .\n\nThe replication of HCV 229 E appears to follow the pattern which has now been well established for several coronaviruses, notably, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) [reviewed in 19] . In the HCV 229 E infected cell a set of 6 T-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized, the smallest of which, mRNA 7, encodes the nucleocapsid protein (22, 17] . As for other coronaviruses, the synthesis of the HCV 229E subgenomic mRNAs appears to involve a leader-primed mechanism of discontinuous tran-324 T. Raabe and S. G. Siddell scription in which a specific intergenic sequence (TCTAAAC for MHV and HCV) plays an important role [-17] . In this paper we report the nucleotide sequence of the genomic region of HCV 229 E which encodes the membrane protein. This region is adjacent to the 3' terminal nucleocapsid protein gene and corresponds to the unique region of mRNA 6.\n\nHCV 229E virus was obtained from Dr. D. A. J. Tyrrell of the MRC Common Cold Unit, Salisbury, U.K., plaque purified and propagated in C 16 cells at 33 \u00b0C as described previously [,11 ]. The cytoplasmic RNA from 108 cells which had been infected 48 h previously at an m.o.i, of 3 was extracted by standard procedures [,18 ] and the poly A-containing fraction selected by hybridization to poly U-Sepharose. cDNA synthesis was performed according to the procedure of Gubler and Hoffman [-3] using 5 gg of RNA primed with random hexanucleotides. The double-stranded cDNA was ligated to EcoRI linkers and cloned into the EcoRI site of the pBluescript vector, pKS + (Stratagene, Federal Republic of Germany). After transformation, a library of recombinant clones was established and screened by colony hybridization with a synthetic oligonucleotide, 5'TTGAACATTCCAATAGCC 3', which is complementary to a region 165-183 bases from the 5' end of the HCV 229E nucleocapsid gene in prep.; 17] . This search identified the clone 2 F 7 which hybridized to all 7 virus specific mRNA species in HCV 229 E infected cells (data not shown). The cDNA insert of the clone 2 F 7 was sequenced completely on both strands using restriction endonuclease fragments subcloned into the M 13 vector, mp 18 [-9 ] and the dideoxyribonucleotide chain termination method of Sanger [15] . Universal and sequence specific primers synthesized on a Cyclone DNA synthesizer (Milli Gen, Federal Republic of Germany) were used. The sequence data were assembled and analysed using the programs of Staden [20] and the University of Wisconsin Genetics Group [2] .\n\nThe sequence of the clone 2 F 7 corresponding to the genomic region representing the unique region of mRNA 6 is shown in Fig. 1 . This region contains a single large open reading frame (ORF) of 678 nucleotides. The open reading frame is flanked on either side by the nucleotide sequence TCTAAAC (Fig. 1 , nucleotide positions 33-39 and 722-728) which would be at or near the sites of fusion between the leader RNA and the mRNA6 and mRNA7 coding regions, respectively [17] . Fourteen nucleotides downstream from the large ORF is an AUG codon which represents the initiation codon of the nucleocapsid gene [Myint et al., in prep.] and 12 nucleotides upstream from the large ORF is a TAA codon which represents the termination codon of the 5' proximal gene [Raabe et al., in prep.] .\n\nThe large open reading frame predicts a polypeptide of 225 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26,000. The predicted polypeptide has several features which are characteristic of a coronavirus membrane protein. Firstly, there are three potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. 1 , amino acid positions 5, 190, and 214), one of which is near the amino-terminus. Secondly, the polypeptide Fig. 1, amino acid positions 17-37, 48-63, and 75-95) within the amino terminal half and a relatively hydrophilic carboxy-terminus (Fig. 1, amino acid 213-221) . Thirdly, the polypeptide is slightly basic with a net charge of + 4 at neutral pH. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of the M proteins of HCV 229 E, TGEV, MHV, BCV, and IBV (Fig. 2) On the basis of structural and biochemical data Rottier and coworkers [12-14-] have proposed a model for the membrane topology of the MHV M protein.\n\nIn this model a short glycosylated region of the amino terminus is on the outside of the virion. The protein then enters and traverses the virion membrane three times (corresponding to the hydrophobic regions 1, 2, and 3) before emerging from the cytoplasmic face of the lipid bitayer. Basic domains in the carboxy terminal region of the protein are then proposed to interact with the nucleocapsid structure during virus maturation. The data presented here are fully consistent with this model."}
