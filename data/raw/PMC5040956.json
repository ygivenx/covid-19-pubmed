{"title": "Pre-fusion F is absent on the surface of formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus", "body": "Antigenic characterization by dot blot using mAbs that either target antigenic site II on the shared surface between pre-F and post-F (motavizumab) or epitopes unique to pre-F (D25, 5C4, and AM14)2122 (Fig. 1b) showed that all four antibodies recognized freshly purified RSV, but FI-RSV was only recognized by motavizumab (Fig. 1c). In the experiments using a conformationally stabilized prefusion F protein (DSCav1), pre-F specific antibodies were able to recognize DSCav1 after incubation at 37 \u00b0C with or without the addition of 0.025% formalin. This indicates that the loss of recognition of FI-RSV by pre-F specific antibodies is not due to chemical modifications by formalin, but rather due to modifications of pre-F conformation. To investigate the effect of formalin on antigenic recognition, we increased the concentration of added formalin to 1% and found that the recognition of post-F by motavizumab and DSCav1 by all antibodies were greatly reduced (Supplementary Fig. 1). This indicates that formalin can influence antigenicity, but the effect is not discernable at the \u201cformalin-inactivating\u201d concentration of 0.025%, and is much less than the impact of temperature. To further understand the effect of formalin and elevated temperature on the antigenic profile of RSV virions, we recapitulated the methods used to manufacture FI-RSV and defined the kinetics of antibody reactivity. Immediately after the application of formalin, RSV retained both pre-F and post-F antigenic sites; however, over time at 37 \u00b0C, pre-F specific epitopes on the surface of RSV disappear (Fig. 2a). The disappearance of pre-F specific epitopes (particularly site \u00d8) correlated with reduction in infectivity, as determined by flow cytometry of recombinant GFP-expressing RSV-infected cells (Fig. 2b).\n\nA similar correlation of diminished AM14 trimer binding and loss of infectivity was observed for virus incubated at different temperatures ranging from 25 \u00b0C to 37 \u00b0C in the presence of 0.025% formalin (Fig. 3a,b). While reactivity with motavizumab remains relatively stable at every temperature, virus incubated at close to room temperature (25 \u00b0C) maintains pre-F epitopes (AM14, D25, 5C4 binding) longer than viruses incubated at human body temperature (37 \u00b0C) or mouse body temperature (39 \u00b0C). These data indicate that pre-F on the surface of virions is converted to post-F more quickly at temperatures above room temperature; and that after 72 hours at 36 \u00b0C, the original FI-RSV had no remaining pre-F.\n\nAs a class I fusion protein, RSV F shares properties with surface glycoproteins of other enveloped viruses such as parainfluenza virus fusion (F), influenza hemagglutinin (HA), HIV-1 envelope (Env), Ebola glycoprotein (GP) and coronavirus spike (S). These proteins all mediate membrane fusion by a conformational change from a prefusion form to a transitional pre-hairpin intermediate form and eventually to a stable 6-helix bundle postfusion form. Therefore, defining the protein conformation presented on the surface of a viral immunogen is key to understanding mechanisms of antibody neutralization, and represents an important step toward designing a vaccine immunogen targeting the functional prefusion conformation. Recent work on HIV-1 Env has demonstrated that, in contrast to strain-specific antibodies raised against gp120 monomers or non-native trimeric gp140, stabilized versions of the prefusion Env trimer can preferentially elicit conformation-dependent, cross-reactive antibodies that can effectively target a functional prefusion conformation23. Similarly, the critical differences between antigenic sites of pre-F on infectious RSV and post-F on FI-RSV suggest that the balance of F conformational states determines virus infectivity. Designing immunogens that preserve neutralization-sensitive epitopes on the functional form of viral proteins will promote the induction of protective antibody responses and diminish non-neutralizing antibody responses, theoretically reducing the likelihood of immune complex formation and complement activation.\n\nStudies in mice and macaques have shown that stabilized pre-F immunogens elicit potent neutralizing antibody responses with titers at the high end of what is achieved after recurrent natural infections in humans21. By 72 hours, the time used to make the FI-RSV vaccine, the presence of pre-F-specific epitopes on the virion surface of the membrane was nearly completely lost (Fig. 4). This contradicts the original presumption that production of FI-RSV from RSV alters only the infectivity of the virus, not the antigenicity, and that this low concentration of formalin would help preserve or fix the antigenic sites on the virus24.\n\nThe catastrophic failure and tragedy resulting from the FI-RSV vaccine trails has restricted consideration for using protein-based RSV vaccines in antigen-na\u00efve infants. Defining the atomic-level detail of RSV F in two distinct conformations as well as isolation and characterization of mAbs that can distinguish surfaces unique to the functional pre-F from those on non-functional post-F, provides new reagents to define the antigenicity of FI-RSV and an additional piece of the FI-RSV-induced vaccine-enhanced disease puzzle. We anticipate that vaccine design based on understanding the relationship between conformational state and specificity of immune responses will guide the development of effective vaccines against RSV and potentially other viral diseases.\n\nAntigenic characterization was performed by dot blot using mAbs that either target antigenic site II on the shared surface between pre-F and post-F (motavizumab) or epitopes unique to pre-F surfaces (D25, 5C4, and AM14)2122. Briefly, dots of pre-F, post-F, heat inactivated pre-F (HI-Pre-F), formalin inactivated pre-F (FI-Pre-F), RSV or FI-RSV are applied to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with antibodies motavizumab, AM14, D25 and 5C4 (made in house) similarly to a Western blot and probed with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody reactive against either human (goat anti-human IgG-HRP, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse (rabbit anti-mouse IgG-HRP, Jackson Immunoresearch) Fc regions25. Both HI- and FI-Pre-F are incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 96 hours, FI-Pre-F includes a 0.025% concentration of formalin and 1% Pre-F includes a 1% concentration of formalin. Antibodies are incubated for one hour at room temperature in 5% skim milk in TBS-T at a concentration of 0.2 \u03bcg/mL. Antibody binding is detected via a G-box gel imager (Syngene) and densitometry done using Genetools (Syngene). Antibody binding to post-F and virions is reported relative to antibody binding of a pre-F protein loading control.\n\nThe manufacture of FI-RSV required RSV to be exposed to a 0.025% formalin for 72 hours at 36 \u00b0C. We produced FI-RSV by incubating RSV with 0.025% formalin at 37 \u00b0C for up to 96 hours. Viruses are sampled for antigenic analysis and infectivity every 24 hours over a 96 hour-interval after incubation at 25 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b0C, 37 \u00b0C or 39 \u00b0C.\n\nRSV expressing GFP (A2 strain) was incubated at 37 \u00b0C with a 0.025% concentration formalin and sampled periodically to infect HEp-2 cells26. Infection was monitored as a function of GFP expression (encoded by the viral genome) at 18 hours post- infection by flow cytometry (LSR II, BD Bioscience, CA, USA). Prior to assessment by flow cytometry, cells were treated with 4 mM EDTA to ensure a single-cell suspension optimal for analysis and fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde. One hundred percent infectivity represents the number of cells infected by RSV with no prior incubation.\n\nHow to cite this article: Killikelly, A. M. et al.
