{"title": "Title 1 INFECTIVITY OF ATTENUATED POXVIRUS VACCINE VECTORS AND IMMUNOGENICITY OF A 2 RACCOONPOX VECTORED RABIES VACCINE IN THE BRAZILIAN FREE-TAILED BAT 3", "body": "Groups of 8 wild-caught T. brasiliensis were separated into two screened flight cages (33\"W x 66\"D 142\n\nx 84\"H) approximately 5 meters apart. Four bats from each group were given 10 9 plaque forming 143 units (PFU) in 100\u03bcl of either RCN-luc or MVA-luc by intramuscular (IM) injection, split into two 144 50\u03bcl volumes injected into each thigh muscle. The remaining four bats in each group were given 145 the same amount of virus in 70\u03bcl sterile saline; using a micropipette with sterile tips, the volume 146 split among the nostrils (10 \u03bcl given each nare) and mouth (50 \u03bcl) for oronasal (ON) exposure. 147\n\nBats were monitored for 3 hours post inoculation for signs of adverse effects. Animals were 148 scanned using an IVIS 200 Biophotonic imager (PerkinElmer, Hopkinton, MA, USA) at one-day 149 post infection (dpi) and every-other day thereafter until 2 consecutive images with less than 100 150 radiance units (comparable to background) were observed. Bats were scanned prior to infection 151 and confirmed to have no auto-luminescence beyond background levels. Imaging was conducted 152 at roughly the same time period each day, midway through the bats' active period. On imaging 153 days the bats were separated individually into paper lunch bags, weighed, and injected 154 intraperitoneally (i.p) with d-luciferin (Potassium-Luciferin, Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO 155 63132, dose: 150 mg/kg) at 14 minutes prior to imaging the ON group and 26 minutes prior to 156 imaging the IM group, which were empirically determined to be the time of peak luminescence 157 post substrate exposure on the first day of imaging. All bats were examined for signs of disease or 158 discomfort at the time of substrate injection. For imaging, animals were anesthetized by chamber-159 delivered isoflurane and positioned in the imager in dorsal recumbency with wings extended 160 laterally, where they were maintained on mask-delivered isoflurane. After imaging the anesthesia 161 was ceased, bats were monitored and given thermal support during recovery. After 11 dpi the bats 162 with remaining detectable luminescence were imaged every 3 days until luminescence was below 163 detectable levels. Images were collected and analyzed using Living Image software (Caliper Life 164 Sciences, Alameda, California, USA). A region of interest (ROI) was created which covered the 165 entire body of the bat when analyzing the luminescence data. 166\n\nAt 87 dpi, a random group of six bats, all initially exposed to RCN-luc by either the ON (n=4) or IM 167 (n=2) route, was given a booster exposure to the RCN-luc vaccine via the ON route at the same 168 dose. Bats from this group were imaged at 1, 3, and 5 dpi using the same protocol as described 169\n\nabove. were also collected at 30 and 60 dpi and used for controls. Serum was collected by making a small 203 lance in the interfemoral vein and collecting up to 200 \u03bcl of blood in a capillary tube (Microvette\u00ae 204 CB 300 Blood Collection System, Sarstedt AG & Co., N\u00fcmbrecht, Germany), which was 205 subsequently centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min. A micropipette was used to collect the serum 206 from the top of the blood container and transfer it to a separate tube for storage at -80\u00ba. 207\n\nTesting was conducted at the CDC Poxvirus and Rabies Branch using standard RFFIT protocols 208\n\n[42], augmented for smaller volumes of serum as previously described [43] . The assay was run in 209 triplicate for each sample, and the results reported represent average titers. Prior to the 60 dpi 210 sample collection, two bats from the RCN-G group were lost from the study due to non-vaccine 211 related mortalities. Table) . All bats infected with 226 luc-expressing poxvirus vectors had detectable expression of luminescence by 1 dpi, and peak 227 levels were observed at 1 and 3 dpi for the IM and ON routes, respectively (Figures 1 and 2 In the group of bats re-exposed to RCN-luc to assess whether prior exposure would affect the 238 infectivity of the viral vectors, no significant difference (P =0.33) was detected in luminescence 239 when compared to initial exposure through 5 dpi (Figure 3) . Table) . As a 255 control, bats vaccinated with luc-expressing virus for the imaging study (N=7) were bled at 0 and 256 60 dpi and assessed by RFFIT as well. By 30 dpi all rabies vaccinated bats (5/5) developed Ab 257 titers greater than 0.2 IU/ml (0.20 -11.46, with a mean of 5.14), while 7/7 bats that received RCN-258 luc had titers \u2264 0.09 IU/ml (S5 table) to RCN, which may be expected due to the highly attenuated nature of MVA. The lack of significant 283 difference in the levels of viral encoded protein (luciferase) production upon re-infection with 284 RCN, as shown in the booster study (Fig. 3) , may be important if bats had been previously exposed 285 to RCN, or if boost inoculations of RCN-vectored vaccine are necessary. While neither vector 286 caused clinical illness, the fact that RCN produced more viral encoded protein (luciferase) over a 287 longer period suggests it is a more immunogenic vector when expressing heterologous antigens. 288\n\nDue to limitations of this study, we were not able to compare the immunogenicity of the vectors 289 directly. 290\n\nThe development of significant levels of rabies neutralizing antibodies after ON exposure to demonstrates that the vaccine is highly immunogenic in T. brasiliensis. While previous studies 292 have demonstrated the effectiveness of injectable vaccines in this species[52], our study is the 293 first to demonstrate effective mucosal vaccination. An average anti-rabies G titer of 5.14 IU at 60 294 dpi was detected in bats orally administered RCN-G , which is higher than the levels obtained after 295 vaccination with the VR-G construct in any previous studies, including oral, IM, and scarification 296 routes of exposure (28-30). While these differences may be due to the animal models used, this is 297 additional evidence of the superiority of the RCN vector over vaccinia in bat species. Additionally, 298 the previous studies failed to address the infectivity of vaccinia in the bat host, relying on the lack 299 of clinical disease and development of protective immunity to assess the virus-host interaction. 300\n\nWe were unable to assess the duration of immunity past 60 days, but this would be useful 301 information to collect in future studies. 302\n\nLimited oral shedding of the RCN virus was detected in bats by both PCR and culture of live virus 303 up to 9 dpi, but at very low levels. While there was no evidence of shedding of live MVA virus, 304 there was PCR evidence of vector DNA in oral swabs through 7 dpi; detection of live virus may 305 have been limited due to the method used and the necessary lack of lower dilutions resulting from 306 low sample volumes. One of the advantages of in vivo imaging studies is that it is not necessary to 307 sacrifice animals to obtain data, and the bats used in this study went on to be used in a different 308 investigation. Because of this, we were unable to assess organ tissue for evidence of pathology 309 during the infection trials. However, the lack of any apparent morbidity in RCN-treated bats, along 310 with RCN's natural history, record of success in various domestic and non-domestic species, and 311 ability to induce immunity via the oral route, make it a very attractive candidate for use in free-312 ranging bats. 313\n\nThe results of our experiments provide proof-of-principle that oral vaccination is possible in free-314 ranging bats. In future work, topical vehicles will be developed that could be used to deliver oral 315 vaccines to the fur coat of bats as they roost or are otherwise congregated. Bats are fastidious 316 animals and spend a large proportion of their time self-grooming [53], which could lead to 317 significant oral exposure to topically applied vaccines. A vaccine that would broadly protect free-318 ranging bats from rabies virus infection may reduce local incidence of rabies in certain bat 319 populations, limiting the amount of spill-over into humans and other species. T. brasiliensis 320 represents a species that roosts in dense colonies and is exposed to significant levels of circulating 321 rabies virus in their population that may result in human exposures [54] . Therefore, a topically 322 delivered rabies vaccine may be directly applicable to this species, but only if a method for mass 323 application (such as a spray) could be developed. Table.
