{"title": "The Role of Electron Microscopy in the Rapid Diagnosis of Viral Infections -review and Foreign Cell in Clinical Specimens CONTENTS", "body": "In the early 1960s, electron microscopy (EM) became widely used in viral diagnosis, primarily thanks to the introduction of the negative staining techniques (Brenner and Horne 1959; Hayat and Miller 1990; Harris 1997) . During the 1970s and 1980s, EM made it possible to detect in diagnostic cell cultures many clinically important infectious agents such as adenoviruses, enteroviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses and reoviruses. Differences in virus size and fine structure (symmetry, presence and/or absence of the envelope and projection size) were used as the criteria for the classification of viruses and thus also for morpho-logical diagnosis (Tyrrell and Almeida 1967) . In some diseases, such as hepatitis or gastroenteritis, none infectious agent was detected by EM; it was not due either to the failure or inefficiency of the method but to the fact that the respective causative viruses are impossible or very difficult to grow in cell cultures. This pitfall was overcome by direct examination of clinical specimens (Almeida 1983; Madeley 1979 Madeley , 1995 . EM is a rapid diagnostic method capable of detecting viruses in a wide range of clinical specimens such as crust, vesicular fluid, lavage fluid, biopsy specimens, feces, urine samples, cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and others (Biel and Gelderblom 1999) . The preparation of specimens for EM does not require any special or expensive reagents. EM visualizes all infectious agents that are contained in the analysed specimen regardless of whether or not they are suspected by the clinician (Curry 2003) . This method can rapidly detect even very small viruses (Hazelton and Gelderblom 2003) .\n\nIn plant and animal virology more than 30 000 different viruses have been described, and based on genetic properties, classified into 56 different virus families. Humans have been found to host 21 of the 26 families specific for vertebrates (Van Regenmortel et al. 2000) . Since the virus families differ from each other in fine structure, an agent visualized by EM can be classified into the relevant family based on morphology. Nevertheless, the development of other techniques, e.g., immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and above all molecular biological methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), progressively reduced the importance of EM in virus diagnosis and microbiology. However, in comparison with other diagnostic methods, EM still benefits from its rapidity and \"open view\", i.e. the capability of detecting all the pathogens present in a clinical specimen (Gentile and Gelderblom 2005) . Modern techniques also have limitations: antigenic analysis may not detect antigens that differ in the antigenic make-up while nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAT, PCR) are only capable of detecting the genomic sequences that are already known and PCR can be inhibited by contaminants in clinical specimens. Moreover, commercially available reagents are still lacking. Test kits for many agents have not been marketed yet (Curry et al. 2006) .\n\nTherefore EM should be utilized as a front line method in infectious diseases emergencies and/or in suspect cases of bioterrorism (Hazelton and Gelderblom 2003; Madeley 2003) . If a number of different agents can be etiologically involved, as in gastroenteritis outbreaks, the use of EM will be a prudent decision.\n\nIn this review we would like to emphasize the benefit of EM for viral diagnosis and analysis of a wide range of clinical specimens.\n\nDiagnostic EM can be performed when the agent is present in concentrations of a least 10 5 particles per mL (Almeida 1983; Gelderblom et al. 1991; Biel et al. 2004) . In clinical samples, such as vesicles, brain and wart tissues, feces, urine and serum, often much higher particle concern EM was used to analyze various clinical specimens sent to the National Reference Laboratory for Direct Diagnosis of Viruses, Borreliae and Foreign Cells in Clinical Specimens (NRL/ELM). Some clinical specimens, such as vesicular fluid, cell culture, urine, serum, plasma, etc. were directly analyzed by EM without the need for any previous processing. Sputum specimens or nasopharyngeal secretion should be diluted in PBS and treated with 20 % N-acetylcysteine (Gentile and Gelderblom 2005) . If suspension turns out negative, the virus may be concentrated by centrifugation, sediment is resuspended in small amount of distilled water. Cerebrospinal fluid usually contains only low concentrations of viruses, so it always needs centrifugation.\n\nTo investigate outbreaks of gastroenteritis, feces are prepared as a 10-% suspension in distilled water, followed by low-speed centrifugation to remove cell debris and bacteria (1000 g for 5 min). After negative staining of supernatants, EM may reveal the presence of one of at least six different virus families involved in diarrhea.\n\nSuspensions of viruses must be supported on thin of plastic, carbon, or a combination of the two applied to the surface of an electron microscope grid (Hazelton and Gelderblom 2003; Curry et al. 2006) ; we used 1 % polyvinyl formal (Formvar) with carbon coating film, to enhance its stability. Stability and adhesiveness are best guaranteed using 400 mesh copper grids. To improve the adherence of diagnostic material poly-L-lysine, alcian blue, or UV light may also be used (Gentile and Gelderblom 2005) . We preferred coated grids with 1 % poly-L-lysine.\n\nNegative staining\n\nThe negative staining technique developed by Horne and colleagues was a major advance in diagnostic virology (Brenner and Horne 1959; Horne and Wildy 1963, 1979) . This technique uses of heavy metals salts to provide contrast to viruses. In EM viruses will appear translucent, while the electrondense stain forms a dense, highly detailed halo. Phosphotungstic acid (PTA) is probably the most commonly used negative stain within diagnostic microbiology, but there are others that are used also. We used routinely 2 % ammonium molybdate and 2 % aqueous uranyl acetate. Two grids were used for each virus suspension, negatively stained one with 2 % ammonium molybdate and with 2 % uranyl acetate. Because uranyl acetate and ammonium molybdate differ in staining properties both stains were applied in parallel of every sample. We have found that PTA destroyed envelope of viruses. The specimens were processed in a biohazard hood in compliance with the biological safety level regulations. The grids were examined under an electron microscope Joel 100CX at a magnification of 100 000 \u00d7 .\n\nDetection sensitivity may be increased and virus identification achieved using the technique of immune electron microscopy, which employs specific antiserum to bind to a viral antigen of interest. There are several immune electron methods (IEM): immune clumping, solid phase immune electron microscopy (SPIEM) and immune-gold labeling. Both immune clumping and SPIEM have routine uses in virology, but immune-gold labeling is mainly used in research investigation.\n\nImmune clumping Some of the smaller viruses lack distinctive morphological features and are thus difficult to discern from the background debris present in clinical specimens. Target virus, if present, will be aggregated by the antibody into clumps, which are much easier to detect than individual virus particles (Lee et al. 1996) .\n\nThe SPIEM methods provides increased sensitivity over immune clumping, allowing detection of virus when only small numbers of particles are present in clinical sample. In SPIEM, antibody-coated grid is floated on drop of the clinical sample under investigation. Virus particles are attracted onto the grid surface and these are spread individually over the grid rather than being aggregated into clumps (Lewis et al. 1988 ).\n\nImmune-gold labeling Immune-gold labeling utilizes specific antibodies tagged with small particles of colloidal gold as electron dense marker. The technique may be used to localize antigens on whole virus or for example, antigens in thin sections of infected cells or tissues (R\u00fdc et al. 1989 ).\n\nDirect EM detected viruses in a wide range of clinical specimens. It was made possible by the nonselective nature of the method and morphological differences between virus families. Viruses come in whole range of size and shapes, but into three morphological group characterized by (1) helical symmetry, (2) cubic or icosahedral symmetry, and (3) other or complex symmetry (Horne and Wildy 1961; Horne 1974; Nermut 1987; Madeley and Field 1988) . Viruses are taxonomically grouped in families and genera by morphological criteria, i.e. by size, shape, fine structure of viral capsid and the presence or absence of an envelope and surface projections. Members of the same family or genus have a similar morphological appearance and can originating from various clinical specimens, but they are antigenic distinct. EM detects not only complete but also incomplete viruses and their morphological variants, e.g., empty capsids that are found in 30-40 % cells after virus replication (Fig. 1) . Antibody-coated viruses or viruses still enclosed in cells are shown in Fig. 2 .\n\nEM still has an important role in the investigation of viral gastroenteritis, particularly that associated with infants and community outbreaks. The presence of one or more viral species of six families responsible for diarrhea was detected in stool extracts after negative staining (Fig. 3 , Table I ). Adenoviruses (family Adenoviridae) already comprised a large group of antigenically distinct viruses causing wide range symptoms from mild respiratory illness and sore throats to tumors. They are non-enveloped icosahedral viruses with a diameter of \u224880 nm (Fig. 3a) . Adenovirus types 40 and 41 are specifically associated with gastroenteritis (Gary et al. 1979) . Gastroenteritis originate in adenoviruses are found sporadically throughout the year, being slightly prevalent in winter and spring.\n\nRotaviruses (family Reoviridae) are now being considered to be the most important enteritic viral infection in infancy and are associated with an estimated 600 000 deaths per year, particularly in the developing world (Parashar et al. 2003) . They are generally spherical, have two capsid layers and are 65-75 nm in diameter which, because of its wheel-like ultrastructure (Fig. 3b) , was named 'Rotavirus' (Flewett et al. 1973) . They were found primarily in stool extracts from young children (less than 5 years of age) and in the elderly in old people's homes and nursing homes. They are isolated more often in winter.\n\nNoroviruses (family Caliciviridae) are regarded as the commonest cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis in developed countries (Kapikian 2000) . They are small (\u224835 nm) and have icosahedral symmetry with \"fuzzy\" or ragged edge. They are also called Norwalk-like viruses or small-round-structured viruses (SRSVs) (Mayo 2002) , and may account for 68-80 % of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks in all age groups. They are highly infectious, readily transmissible from person to person (Fig. 3c) .\n\nSapoviruses (family Caliciviridae) are small viruses being \u224832-35 nm in diameter with surface hollows (Madeley and Cosgrove 1976; Kogasaka et al. 1981) . The viruses were detected mainly in young children, whereas noroviruses infect all age groups (Fig. 3d) .\n\nCoronaviruses (family Coronaviridae) are spherical, lipidcontaining, enveloped particles with tear-drop-shaped surface projections or peplomers. They usually have a diameter excluding projections of between 80 and 120 nm. Coronaviruses cause a wide range of diseases, they are pathogens of the respiratory tract and also of the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 3a,e) .\n\nAstroviruses (family Astroviridae) (Appleton and Higgins 1975; Madeley and Cosgrove 1975) are small, morphologically Vol. 55 distinct from other enteric viruses, being \u224828 nm in diameter with a five or six-pointed surface star and have icosahedral symmetry (Fig. 3f) . Human astroviruses cause a less severe diarrhea in infants than rotavirus infection. They are found in children particularly in summer. Enteroviruses (family Picornaviridae) are small non-enveloped viruses with an icosahedral symmetry in general are 25-30 nm in diameter. They rarely cause gastroenteritis, observed predominantly in young children (Fig. 3g) .\n\nViruses of the family Herpesviridae were detected in vesicular fluid of skin lesion. EM still has an important role in the investigation of skin lesions because within 30 min can distinguish herpesviruses from the various poxviruses and papilloma viruses in skin scrapings.\n\nThe non-selective nature of EM was helpful mainly in the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Viruses of the families Herpesviridae, Paramyxoviridae (Fig. 4a) , Picornaviridae (Fig. 4b) , and Reoviridae (orbiviruses) (Fig. 4c) , were detected in CSF specimens, varying in quantity, with the last ones being sporadic (Table II) .\n\nParamyxoviruses (family Paramyxoviridae), which cause measles, mumps and other respiratory infections contain a long, thin helical nucleocapsid 18-22 nm in diameter with a herringbone appearance which is diagnostic feature (Madeley 1997) .\n\nOrthomyxoviruses -influenza (family Orthomyxoviridae) are identified by the presence of surface spikes, which form characteristic fringe 10 nm long. Particles are usually round or oval with an approximate diameter of 80-120 nm (Madeley 1997) .\n\nPicornaviruses (family Picornaviridae) are small non-enveloped viruses with icosahedral symmetry, in general are 25-30 nm in diameter. Picornaviruses are broadly classified into four categories: the enteroviruses, the aphthoviruses, the rhinoviruses and the cardioviruses.\n\nEM investigation of samples from immunocompromised individuals remains an important use of EM. Urine examination by EM can quickly reveal the presence of polyomavirus (BK) or adenovirus (Cotterill et al. 1992; Appleton 2005) .\n\nUrine specimens from children and transplant recipients were examined. Apart from viruses of family Herpesviridae, polyomaviruses BK (family Papovaviridae), adenoviruses (Fig. 5a) , and mycoplasmas ( Fig. 5b) were detected (Table III) . Treatment for organ rejection by inducing further immunosuppression would actually prolong virus replication (Curry et al. 2006) . Therefore, a rapid diagnosis by EM can significantly aid patient management by indicating the need for the administration of antiviral drugs.\n\nIn respiratory samples by EM were detected picornaviruses (Fig. 6a) , orthomyxoviruses (Fig. 6b) , and paramyxoviruses (Fig. 6c) . Adenoviruses, coronaviruses were also detected ( Table IV) . Examinations of respiratory samples from patients with severe acute respiratory symptoms, resulted in the discovery of the SARS, the virus had the characteristic ultrastructural features of a coronavirus (Ksiazek et al. 2003; Falsey and Walsh 2003) . \n\nPlasma examination is more suitable for the detection of viruses from the blood. In the plasma, we detected viruses of the families Herpesviridae (Fig. 7) , Picornaviridae, Papovaviriadae, Paramyxoviridae and arborviruses. Generally, the detection of these viruses in plasma can be very difficult and requires an experienced specialist. \n\nEvaluation in EM is time-consuming. Each grid should be screened for 20 min (or 10 fields on the 400 mesh grid) to detect also multiple infections. EM preparation and evaluation cannot be performed in an automated way, they both are dependent on experienced and dedicated staff. Another limitation is the relatively low sensitivity (10 5 -10 6 particles per mL) of diagnostic EM compared to other diagnostic methods. However, as stated before, clinical samples often contain virus concentrations that exceed this limit by several orders. Therefore, the negative evidence is not an absolute diagnosis. A number of effective concentration or immunologic procedures exist that markedly increase sensitivity of EM. Nonimmunological procedures include: (a) ultracentrifuge concentration, (b) agar diffusion, (c) direct centrifugation to the electron microscopic grid with the Beckman Airfuge (for immunologic procedures see Chapter 2.4).\n\nAs it has been already said, the assets of direct EM are the rapidity and non-selective nature. EM is able to visualize even the smallest viruses. Therefore, the unbiased, \"open view\" EM is able to detect any virus in a diagnostic sample, i.e. also those that were not considered before by the clinician (Biel and Gelderbolm 1999; Gelderblom et al. 1991; Hazelton and Gelderblom 2003; Madeley 1995 Madeley , 2003 . In the diagnosis, EM has two advantages over ELISA, PCR and NAT -after a simple and rapid negative staining the EM \"open view\" makes possible the rapid morphological identification and differential diagnosis of various infectious agents present in the examined specimen (Table V) . The main advantage of the electron microscopy results is that it is based on the morphology and not on the presence of a particular antigen or nucleic acid type. Probably, the intact virions seen with EM may be indicative of infectious virus, whereas detection of antigen or nucleic acid may not always indicate the presence of viable infectious virus particles (Curry 2003) .\n\nEM has also been used in many other laboratories for routine diagnosis of human viruses causing gastroenteritis, i.e. non-cultivable noroviruses, astroviruses and rotaviruses (Beards 1988; Clark and McKendrick 2004; Frankenhauser et al. 2002; Suzuki et al. 2005) . EM is valuable for differential diagnosis in patients with vesicular dermatitis to exclude smallpox (Hawranek et al. 2003; Schimmer et al. 2004 ). Furthermore, it is essential for the diagnosis in outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics caused by an agent, which is difficult to define (Hazelton and Gelderblom 2003) . The causative agent of the recent SARS pandemic was also first identified by EM (Drosten et al. 2003; Goldsmith et al. 2004; Ksiarek et al. 2003) . EM was the only method able to identify the causative agent of an outbreak of human monkey pox in the USA 2003 (Reed et al. 2004 ). Modern immunological and molecular genetic methods facilitate the routine diagnosis of viruses and thus make it possible for EM to focus on urgent and serious cases of virus infections, e.g., in immunocompromised patients (Biel et al. 2004) .\n\nComparison of results obtained by EM and real-time PCR in the detection of viruses from untreated tissue culture showed the superiority of EM that found 38-times higher number of viral copies than PCR (Johnsen et al. 2006) . EM is occasionally used in combination with other viral methods to identify the causative viruses of zoonotic outbreaks and both seasonal and non-seasonal epidemics or pandemics. For instance, EM visualized reovirus-like particles in the rhesus monkey kidney after inoculation of cerebrospinal fluid and further examination confirmed the diagnosis of reovirus serotype 2 (Hermann et al. 2004). The same approach was used to diagnose Chandipura virus implicated in an encephalitis outbreak (Rao et al. 2003) . EM was helpful in diagnosing a zoonotic disease in a rural population with cowpox-like symptoms in Brazil, caused by vaccinia-like virus called Aracatuba virus (Trinidate et al. 2003) . In Japan, EM confirmed that the rotavirus infection peak shifted from winter months to early spring months (Suzuki et al. 2005) .\n\nRecently, noroviruses have become a major problem in hospitals as the cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks (Clark and McKendrick 2004) . The great diversity of this group of viruses often leads to misidentification of the causative agent using conventional routine diagnostic RT-PCR kits. In such instances, EM as a complementary method can be of relevance (Galliomore et al. 2004; Vipond et al. 2004) .\n\nEM morphological diagnosis can provide results within 30 min after the specimens is obtained. Viruses present in low amounts can be concentrated by centrifugation. The \"open view\" makes it possible for EM to detect, in a single specimen, multiple causative agents possibly implicated in acute gastroenteritis (Hazelton and Gelderblom 2003) or neuroinfection. EM is a polyvalent method that can be used for analysis of a wide range of specimens and detection of all types of agents, e.g., Legionella in respiratory tract lavage fluid, and can make the routine tissue diagnosis more rapid. The potential of EM can be fully exploited in the quality control, with EM used as a front-line method in parallel with other diagnostic methods (Gentle and Gelderblom 2005) . The morphology-based identification coupled with case history often provide sufficient information to the clinician to make the diagnosis, institute therapy and quarantine the patient, if necessary. If further typing of the virus is needed, EM narrows the range of typing tests and thus reduces the costs.\n\nNo simple method for an unequivocal and rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases is available (Hazelton and Gelderblom 2003; Madeley 2003) . Because the unusual and unexpected can be rapidly identified, EM must remain a front-line method for rapid diagnostic virology, investigation of potential bioterrorist events, and investigation of new and unusual cases of suspected infectious origin. EM has a crucial role to play in times of the emerging threat of bioterrorism, as it was proved in the case of anthrax letters in the USA (Gentile and Gelderblom 2005) . The method is versatile and can be used for different types of samples material and all kinds of agents."}
