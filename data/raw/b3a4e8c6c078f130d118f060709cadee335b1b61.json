As RNA template we used the poly(A)-RNA that was prepared lated by poly(U)-Sepharose (lane 1).\n\nIn order to generate HCV 229E-specific cDNAs, we from HCV 229E-infected cells using oligo(dT) 25 magnetic beads. We primed the reverse transcription with did reverse transcriptions with HCV 229E-specific oligonucleotides and the RNA templates described above. the oligonucleotide 85 and 3 ml of the RT reaction then served as template for a subsequent PCR reaction with To amplify DNA products from the HCV 229E cDNAs, we inserted aliquots of the RT reaction, without further the primers 159 and 89. As is shown in Fig. 4A (lane 3), this protocol resulted in a PCR product with the purification, into the PCR. In a first series of experiments, we carried out the RT reaction using the HCV expected size of 12.6 kb and an additional smaller product of 3.9 kb. Restriction enzyme analysis revealed that 229E-specific oligonucleotide 85 (Table 1, Fig. 2 ) as the the smaller product was amplified from a region of the transcription reaction, in order to reduce the amount of RT primer carryover into the subsequent PCR.

If we reduced the RT primer concentration from tion reaction was performed at 42\u040aC, we reasoned that this product could result from the amplification of a 0.75 to 0.5 mM, the amount of the 3.9-kb PCR product decreases significantly without affecting the yield of cDNA generated during the RT reaction by a ''less stringent'' priming event. Indeed, analysis of the HCV the 12.6-kb product (lane 2). If we reduced the RT primer concentration to 0.25 mM, only small amounts 229E genomic RNA sequence revealed a stretch of 6 nucleotides (nt 4205-4210) that match exactly to the of the 3.9-kb product were synthesized, again without affecting the yield of the 12.6-kb product (lane 1). We 3 end of primer 85 (Fig. 4B) . Thus, a priming event at this position, during the RT reaction, would result also tried to reduce the RT primer concentration to 0. 15 mM but, in this case, the yield of the 12.6-kb product in the synthesis of a cDNA with the primer sequence at its 5 end. Since we inserted aliquots of the reverse decreased significantly (data not shown). transcription reaction directly into the PCR, we also introduce significant amounts of the primer 85, and it The PCR Reaction is likely that during the PCR, the 3 truncated cDNA was amplified with the upstream primer 159 and the Adjusting the amount of PCR template. Our next goal was to establish a RT-PCR protocol that enabled reverse transcription primer 85.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, and to try to circumvent such us to amplify cDNAs longer than 12.6 kb. On the basis of the results described above, we looked for an RT problems, we performed two further experiments. First we changed the temperature of the reverse transcrip-primer that would fulfill two criteria. First, in order to synthesize cDNAs over 12.6 kb in length, the priming tion reaction from 42 to 45\u040aC in order to minimize the occurrence of ''less stringent'' priming events. However, site should be located at least 20 kb downstream from the 5 end of the HCV 229E genomic RNA. Second, this when we used this approach, we only obtained small amounts of the PCR product with the expected size of primer has to be highly specific, in order to minimize the occurrence of ''less stringent'' priming events dur-12.6 kb without diminishing the amount of the 3.9-kb PCR product (data not shown). The second strategy ing the reverse transcription reaction. Therefore, we chose RT-primer 32 at a concentration of 0.25 mM. The was to reduce the primer concentration in the reverse Optimization of the PCR cycle conditions. In parallel to the experiments described above, we set out to optimize the PCR cycle conditions, in order to improve the yield of long RT-PCR products. In most DNA template PCR protocols that aim to produce longer products, the elongation step is performed at 68\u040aC. Therefore, we repeated the RT-PCR reactions described above (Fig. 5, lanes 2-4) , but changed the elongation temperature from 72 to 68\u040aC. With this change, the amount of full-length (16.7 kb) PCR product synthesized is significantly increased (Fig. 5, lanes 5-7) . This result encouraged us to believe that it should be possible to effectively synthesize RT-PCR products longer than 16.7 kb.\n\nIn an attempt to effectively amplify DNA of more than 20 kb by RT-PCR, we used the protocol described above with RT primer 32 and PCR primers 159 and 11 (Table 1, Fig. 2) . In contrast to our standard protocol, the PCR cycle conditions for this exper- 2 and 4) . 5ml aliquots of the PCR reactions were separated on a 0.6% agarose gel.

As is shown in Fig. 5 , it was possible to amplify a DNA fragment with the expected size of 11.5 kb (lane 1) using this procedure. However, when we did the PCR with primers 147 and 11 (Table 1, Fig. 2), we obtained not only the desired product with the expected size of 16.7 kb but also a second product with a size of approximately 4.9 kb (lane 2). Again, by restriction enzyme analysis, we identified this 4.9-kb fragment as an amplification product of the HCV 229E genomic RNA. Our interpretation of this result was as described above, so again we tried to lower the RT primer concentration in the reverse transcription reac- length RT-PCR product (Fig. 5, lanes 2-4) .\n\nThe experiments described above were all done with poly(A)-RNA from HCV 229E-infected cells as RNA template in the RT reaction. In this material, the viral RNAs constitute 10-20% of the total RNA and the 27 kb viral genomic RNA represents approximately 4% of the viral RNAs or 0.4-0.8% of the total RNA (S. Siddell, unpublished) . Obviously, we were interested to know if the RT-PCR protocols described above could also be used for less abundant RNAs, for example, cellular mRNAs.\n\nThe human dystrophin gene was used to study the long RT-PCR amplification of cellular mRNAs. The exon structure of this gene has been characterized and it has been shown to transcribe a 14-kb mRNA with a 4 and 7) of the RT reaction were then used for PCR reactions with the oligonucleotides 127 and 11 (lane 1) or oligonucleotides 147 and 11 (lanes 2 to 7). Elongation temperatures were 72\u040aC (lanes 1 to 4) or 68\u040aC (lanes 5 to 7). 5-ml aliquots of the PCR reactions were separated on a 0.6% agarose gel.

The result is shown in Fig. 6 . Using this protocol, it was possible to synthesize a DNA product with the expected size of 20.3 kb (lane 1). The identity of this product was confirmed by restriction analysis, however, the yield of the product was relatively poor. Also, we observed an unacceptable amount of heterogeneous DNA products that were clearly visible in agarose gel electrophoresis. Therefore, we did a series of experiments to optimize the PCR conditions by varying the cycle profile.
