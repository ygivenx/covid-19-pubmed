{"title": "Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell-Derived IFN-\u03b1 Promotes Murine Liver Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury Via Induction of Hepatocyte IRF-1 NIH Public Access", "body": "Hepatocellular injury caused by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is the result of a highly complex cascade of events that is triggered when the liver is exposed transiently to hypoxia then reperfused with oxygenated blood. I/R injury is unavoidable during transplant surgery, and adversely affects patient and graft outcomes. 1, 2 In a recent large study of living-and deceased-donor liver transplant patients, extended cold ischemic time was associated with elevated rates of early organ failure and acute cellular rejection. 3 Moreover, because of the greater susceptibility of extended criteria liver grafts to ischemic insult, I/R injury exacerbates the donor organ shortage problem. No specific treatment is available to prevent or reduce hepatic I/R injury and current management is based on supportive care. Thus, extensive efforts are warranted to better understand the mechanisms that underlie liver I/R injury.\n\nType I interferons (IFNs; IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) are multifunctional cytokines, that activate or modulate immune responses. 4 Type I IFNs bind to type 1 IFN receptors (IFNAR) and activate Jak1 and Tyk2 that, in turn, phosphorylate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 and STAT2 and promote the formation of the IFN-stimulated gene factor (ISGF) 3 complex. The ISGF3 complex binds to nuclear IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) and induces transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) 4, 5 that encode factors responsible for antiviral, antiproliferative and immunoregulatory responses. 6 Due to their critical role in innate immunity, type I IFNs are used as therapeutic agents in viral hepatitis, leukemia, renal cell carcinoma and multiple sclerosis. 7 On the other hand, type I IFNs can play pathogenic roles in some autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 4 Neutralization of IFN-\u03b1 is a potential therapeutic approach in type I IFN-related diseases and therapeutic effects of IFN-\u03b1 neutralizing antibody (Ab) have been reported in mouse models of HIV encephalitis and septic shock. 8, 9 Recently, the safety of an anti-IFN-\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (MEDI-545) has been confirmed in a chronic psoriasis phase I trial. 10 Type I IFNs are regarded as critical factors in both warm and cold liver I/R injury. Thus, in mice, IFNAR KO livers are protected from damage, 11, 12 suggesting that IFN-\u03b1 neutralization might be a therapeutic option for inhibition of liver I/R injury.\n\nThe transcription factor IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-1 is induced by cytokines (type I IFNs, IFN-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1], IL-1), viruses and retinoic acid. 13, 14 It regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis and immune responses. Overexpression of IRF-1 promotes apoptosis by up-regulation of Fas ligand (CD95L), while IRF-1-deficient hepatocytes are resistant to apoptosis. 15, 16 IRF-1 is known to play a key role in liver I/R injury since high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) released from dying/dead cells up-regulates IRF-1 in hepatocytes through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 ligation and promotes liver injury. 17 Furthermore, IRF-1-deficient livers exhibit less I/R injury correlated with the reduced apoptosis due to diminished expression of death ligands, including Fas ligand and death receptor (DR)5. 18, 19 Although type I IFNs are produced by almost all cells, IFN-\u03b1 is produced mainly by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) while IFN-\u03b2 is produced by fibroblasts, synoviocytes and stromal cells. 20 pDC are an unconventional subset of bone marrow-derived DCs and produce large amounts of IFN-\u03b1 following TLR7 and TLR9 ligation. 21, 22 Although rare cells, pDC are recognized as important players in protecting the host from viral infection by producing IFN-\u03b1. By contrast, pDC that sense self DNA through TLR9 and produce high amounts of IFN-\u03b1, drive autoimmunity and exacerbate SLE and psoriasis. 23 In addition to IFN-\u03b1, pDC produce pro-(IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) following TLR ligation. 24 Thus, like conventional DCs, pDCs play key roles in innate and adaptive immunity in the liver. 25 While conventional DC have been implicated in the regulation of liver I/R injury. 26, 27 to date, no data are available concerning the role of pDC in hepatic I/R injury.\n\nIn this study, we hypothesized that IFN-\u03b1 derived from pDC might be involved in the pathogenesis of liver I/R injury, and that IFN-\u03b1 blockade might protect the liver from damage by inhibiting IRF-1 expression in hepatocytes and consequently reducing their apoptosis. Our data show that pDC are activated and produced IFN-\u03b1 after liver I/R and that IFN-\u03b1 promotes IRF-1 expression by hepatocytes in vitro. In vivo, IFN-\u03b1 neutralization significantly reduces liver I/R-induced damage, with associated reduction in IRF-1, proinflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) and death receptor (Fas and DR5) expression in the liver. Moreover, depletion of pDC in vivo reduces hepatic IFN-\u03b1 and protects the liver from I/R injury. \n\nA non-lethal model of segmental (70%) hepatic warm ischemia was used, as described. 27 Mouse livers were exposed to 1 hour ischemia by clamping the portal triad. The animals were euthanized after 6 hours reperfusion.\n\nFor IFN-\u03b1 neutralization experiments, anti-IFN-\u03b1 mAb (clone F18; 50\u00b5g/mouse iv, Abcam Inc, Cambridge, MA) was injected 30 minutes before I/R injury. For in vivo pDC depletion, mice were injected for 3 consecutive days with anti-mPDCA-1 pure-functional grade mAb (500\u00b5g/mouse, ip; Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA).\n\nmPDCA1 + pDC were isolated from livers of mice given the endogenous DC poietin fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L; CHO cell derived recombinant human Flt3L; 10 \u00b5g/ mouse/day i.p., for 10 days), as described. 28 Thus, bulk liver DC were enriched by density centrifugation using Nycodenz (Sigma, St, Louis, MO). For pDC purification (consistently >95%), mPDCA1 + cells were positively selected from the DC-enriched fraction using immunomagnetic beads and a paramagnetic LS column (MiltenyiBiotec).\n\nLiver pDC, liver non-parenchymal cells (NPC) and spleen cells were treated with Fc\u03b3Rblocking rat anti-mouse CD16/32 mAb (2.4G2) to prevent non-specific Ab binding. They \n\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) expression was quantified by SYBER Green real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with an ABI-Prism 7000 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and primers specific for IFN-\u03b1 \n\nHepatocytes (B6 mouse) were isolated by an in situ collagenase (type IV, Sigma) perfusion technique, as described. 17 Hepatocyte purity exceeded 98%, and viability exceeded 95% as determined by standard testing. Liver pDC from sham or I/R injury mice were incubated for 18hr, without stimulation, to accumulate IFN-\u03b1 in the supernatant. The pDC and their respective supernatants were then applied to hepatocyte cultures with/without anti-IFN-\u03b1 mAb. Mouse IFN-\u03b1 4 (PBL Interferon Source, Piscataway, NJ) was used as a positive control. After 3 hr coculture, the hepatocytes were harvested for RT-PCR.\n\nHepatocytes (B6 WT or IRF1KO) were cultured with or without IFN-\u03b1 (1000 U/ml) for 4 hr. Hepatocyte viability were determined by MTT assay (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nLevels of IFN-\u03b1 in culture supernatants were determined using commercial ELISA kits from PBL Interferon Source following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nSerum ALT levels were measured using the Opera Clinical Chemistry System (Bayer Co., Tarrytown, NY).\n\nLiver tissue samples were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned (6 \u00b5m), and stained with H&E and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) as described. 19 \n\nData are expressed as means \u00b1 1 SD. Significances of differences between means were determined by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test. A 'p' value < 0.05 was considered significant.\n\nTo verify the level of IFN-\u03b1 expression in B6 mouse liver following warm I/R, real-time RT-PCR was performed on whole liver tissue. As shown in Fig. 1A , IFN-\u03b1 gene transcription was markedly and significantly up-regulated (approximately 5-fold) after 6 hours I/R compared with sham-operated control mice. We also examined the phenotype and function of liver pDC freshly-isolated after liver I/R. As shown in Fig. 1B , liver pDC from I/R injury mice displayed significant increases in the intensity of expression (MFI) of cell surface co-stimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, CD86) compared with pDC from shamoperated controls, whereas similar levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (I-A b ) were expressed by both groups. Moreover, freshly-isolated liver pDC from I/R injury mice secreted enhanced quantities of IFN-\u03b1 following 18 hours culture (Fig. 1C) .\n\nIRF-1 is induced in hepatocytes by stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as type I IFNs, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1. 13, 14 Therefore we next examined whether IFN-\u03b1 released by liver pDC after liver I/R injury might upregulate IRF-1 expression by cultured hepatocytes in vitro. 30 23 22 Liver pDC were isolated from sham operated or I/R-injured mice and cultured overnight without stimulation. Liver pDC and their accompanying supernatants were transferred to mouse hepatocyte cultures for 3 hours, with or without addition of neutralizing anti-IFN-\u03b1 mAb at the start of co-cultures. IRF-1 production by hepatocytes was then measured by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2A , liver pDC isolated from sham-operated mice and to a significantly greater extent from I/R-injured mice, up-regulated IRF-1 production by mouse hepatocytes. Notably, neutralization of IFN-\u03b1 significantly reduced the ability of liver pDC of I/R-injured mice to induce IRF-1 production by hepatocytes. To confirm the involvement of IRF-1 in IFN-\u03b1-induced hepatocyte apoptosis, the viability of hepatocytes from WT or IRF-1 KO mice in the presence of IFN-\u03b1 was examined. Whereas the viability of WT hepatocytes was significantly decreased after 4hr incubation with IFN-\u03b1, that of IRF-1 KO hepatocytes was not affected ( Figure 2B ).\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1 , IFN-\u03b1 is upregulated during mouse liver I/R and is thought to be involved early in the pathogenesis of tissue injury. 11 To further evaluate the role of IFN-\u03b1 in liver I/R, we injected mice with neutralizing anti-IFN-\u03b1 mAb or isotype control Ig immediately before liver I/R injury. As is evident in Fig. 3A , serum ALT levels after 6 hours reperfusion were significantly lower (approx 50%) in the mAb-treated mice compared with the control group (Fig. 3A) . Consistent with these reductions in ALT levels, the extent of tissue necrosis and the incidence of TUNEL + (apoptotic) cells (hepatocytes) in the anti-IFN\u03b1-treated group were much lower than in the untreated I/R injury group (Fig. 3B-D) . At the same time, gene transcripts for pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) in liver tissue were reduced significantly in the IFN neutralizing mAb-injected group (Fig. 3E) .\n\nIFN-\u03b1 is a potent inducer of IRF-1 13 that promotes cell apoptosis in a Fas-related manner. 15 To ascertain whether the protective effect of IFN-\u03b1 neutralization in vivo that was associated with reduced hepatocyte apoptosis was due to down-regulation of IRF-1 expression in liver tissue, we performed real-time RT-PCR for IRF-1, death ligand (FasL) and the death receptors Fas and DR5. As shown in Fig. 4A , IRF-1 gene transcription levels in livers of anti-IFN-\u03b1-mAb-treated mice were much lower (approx 80%) than in isotypetreated control mice. Consistent with the IRF-1 mRNA levels, Fas, DR5 and FasL gene transcription that is regulated by IRF-1 and determines the extent of apoptosis, was also reduced significantly in anti-IFN-\u03b1-mAb-treated mouse livers (Fig. 4B) . These data suggest that the protective effect of IFN-\u03b1 neutralization in liver I/R injury is due to reduced apoptosis as the result of less IFN-\u03b1-mediated induction of IRF-1 and consequently less induction of both death receptors and death ligands that are regulated by IRF-1.\n\npDC are regarded as the main source of IFN-\u03b1 in the body. 20 To further investigate their role in IFN-\u03b1 production and liver I/R injury, we depleted pDC in vivo before surgery using anti-PDCA1 mAb. Mice were injected i.p. for three consecutive days with anti-mPDCA-1 pure-functional grade Ab (500\u00b5g), and 24 hours after the last injection underwent I/R. Fig.  5A shows the profound depletion of liver pDC (Siglec-H + B220 + ) achieved by mAb administration. IFN-\u03b1 induction in injured livers was markedly inhibited (~70% reduction) by pDC depletion (Fig. 5B ). As shown in Fig. 5C -F, the livers of pDC-depleted mice were protected from I/R injury, as evidenced by reductions in serum ALT (C) and tissue damage (areas of necrosis and numbers of TUNEL + cells; D-F). Taken together, these data suggest that liver pDC are an important source of IFN-\u03b1 during liver I/R injury and play a key role in the pathogenesis of I/R injury.\n\nType I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) are pleiotropic cytokines produced by DC, macrophages, other immune cells, fibroblasts and virally-infected cells, that contribute both to viral clearance and disease pathogenesis. They have been shown recently to play a pathogenic role in warm and cold liver I/R injury. Thus, in mice, IFNAR KO livers are protected from such injury. 11, 12 Specific cytokine (e.g. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) neutralization has already proved an effective approach for disease therapy in the clinic 31, 32 and an IFN-\u03b1 neutralizing Ab (MEDI-5) is already in phase I clinical trials in psoriasis that have confirmed its safety. 10 Here, we show marked reduction in murine liver warm I/R injury either by selective depletion of pDC or IFN-\u03b1 neutralization and a possible underlying protective mechanism of impaired production of IRF-1, a key downstream molecule of IFN-\u03b1 signaling 13 in the liver.\n\nIRF-1 is a transcription factor induced by viruses, double-stranded RNA, retinoic acid and cytokines, including IFN-\u03b1. It regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis and immune responses. 33 We show in this study that IFN-\u03b1 neutralization reduces IRF-1 induction by hepatocytes in vitro and in the liver after I/R injury. IRF-1 is known to induce apoptosis by increasing expression of FasL. 15, 19 We also found that IFN-\u03b1 neutralization reduced hepatocyte apoptosis after liver I/R injury, consistent with lower expression of death ligand (FasL) and death receptors (Fas and DR5) within the liver. These results suggest that IFN-\u03b1 neutralization attenuates the induction of IRF-1 in hepatocytes and consequently Fas-FasL and DR5 expression, resulting in reduced apoptosis following liver I/R injury.\n\nRecently, other IRF members have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of liver warm I/R injury. IRF-2 is structurally similar to IRF-1 and competes with IRF-1 as an antagonist. Klune et al have reported that overexpression of IRF-2 protects the liver from I/R injury by an IRF-1-dependent mechanism. 34 IRF-3 is another transcription factor that is involved in type-I IFN and other pro-inflammatory cytokine production after TLR stimulation. Interestingly, IRF-3-deficient mice exhibit severe warm liver injury due to greater IL-17 induction and enhanced neutrophil infiltration. 35 Type I IFNs have immunostimulatory capacity and can activate immune cells, including T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and DCs. 36 IFN-\u03b1-primed DCs produce enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, and promote T helper type-1 cell responses. 37 In this study, we have shown that IFN-\u03b1 neutralization decreases key pro-inflammatory cytokines,-IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, after liver I/R injury. This finding is consistent with recent observations using IFNAR KO mice. 11, 12 Although we did not identify the sources of these pro-inflammatory cytokines, our data suggest that IFN-\u03b1 is involved in promotion of pro-inflammatory cytokine production during liver I/R injury.\n\npDC are comparatively abundant in the liver compared with secondary lymphoid tissue 38 and regarded as the main source of IFN-\u03b1. 20, 39 These non-conventional DCs predominantly express TLR7/TLR9 and produce high amounts of IFN-\u03b1 in response to their ligation. Although these TLR receptors recognize single-stranded RNA and double-stranded DNA as pathogen-associated molecular patterns during viral infection, 40 TLR7/TLR8/TLR9 on pDC can sense self-RNA (TLR7/8) 41 and self-DNA (TLR9) 23 as damage-associated molecular patterns and produce IFN-\u03b1. In this study, we found that hepatic warm I/R injury rapidly upregulated IFN-\u03b1 gene transcription in the liver after 6 hours reperfusion. This finding is consistent with an earlier report that type I, but not type II IFN receptor KO mice are protected from warm liver I/R damage. 11 Moreover, very recently, using a clinicallyrelevant mouse model of extended hepatic cold preservation followed by orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT), Shen et al 12 have shown that liver graft but not recipient type I IFN receptor KO deficiency is required to ameliorate I/R injury in OLT.\n\nNotably, in the present study, mice profoundly depleted of pDC exhibited less tissue damage after liver I/R compared with control mice. The decreased liver injury in pDC-depleted mice was associated with a significant reduction in IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 5B) in hepatic tissue. Interestingly, after 6 hours reperfusion, the extent of hepatic IFN-\u03b1 message in pDCdepleted animals was >70% lower than in controls, suggesting that pDC are the main source of type I-IFNs in the liver. We did not compare IFN-\u03b1 production by liver pDC and Kupffer cells that are much more abundant in the liver than pDC and play a role in regulation of hepatic IRI. 42, 43 However, since pDC depletion resulted in such profound reduction in hepatic IFN-\u03b1 expression, it may be concluded that liver macrophages are not a major source of IFN-\u03b1. Since IFN-\u03b2, another type I IFN, may be produced by macrophages during liver I/R injury, 11 and shares downstream STAT1 and IRF-1 signaling pathways with IFN\u03b1, it would be of interest in future studies, to address the in vivo function of both IFNs in this model.\n\nHere we also show that, following reperfusion, liver pDC acquire a more mature phenotype and secrete enhanced amounts of IFN-\u03b1 that are associated with higher levels of IFN-\u03b1 expression in the liver. Liver pDC isolated after warm I/R (activated pDC) secreted IFN-\u03b1 that contributed to enhanced IRF-1 production by hepatocytes. Taken together, these observations suggest that during I/R, liver pDC may be activated by self-DNA to produce IFN-\u03b1 that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of I/R injury. A schematic outline of the proposed mechanisms suggested by our findings is shown in Fig. 6 .\n\nConventional myeloid DC that are important regulators of innate and adaptive immunity, have been implicated previously in the regulation of inflammation and tissue injury after liver I/R, 26, 27, 37, 44 with both inhibitory and enhancing effects reported. Our recent observations 27 suggest that the local liver microenvironment plays an important role in determining DC function during I/R injury. However, no previous reports have focused on the role of pDC in hepatic I/R injury. pDC are believed to exhibit immunoregulatory properties due to their poor immunostimulatory function, Treg inducing ability and IL-10 production 45, 46 Depletion of these cells in vivo exacerbates viral infection, 47 asthma 48 and transplant rejection. 49 On the other hand, the present study shows that pDC depletion can protect the liver from warm I/R injury and reveals an underlying pathological role of these cells. Similarly to our results, pDC have been shown to play a pathological role in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice, with pDC depletion reducing disease activity. 50 Type I IFNs derived from pDC are important for inhibition of viral replication and clearance, 21 but type I IFNs are also pathogenic in the early phase of EAE 50 and in our liver warm I/R injury model. Overall, these observations suggest that the specific role of type I IFNs in each experimental model may determine the role of pDC (protective or pathogenic).\n\nTaken together, our novel findings demonstrate that IFN\u03b1 secreted by activated pDC is involved in the promotion of hepatic I/R injury and in modulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 and most importantly, IRF-1 which regulates hepatocyte apoptosis. The data provide significant new insight into mechanisms that promote liver I/R injury via a pDC-IFN-\u03b1-IRF-1 pathway and support the therapeutic potential of IFN-\u03b1 neutralization for amelioration of liver I/R injury. Hepatic I/R injury stimulates phenotypic maturation and IFN-\u03b1 production by liver interstitial pDC. B6 mice underwent I/R injury as described in the Materials and Methods. After 6 hours reperfusion, liver pDC were isolated by immunomagnetic bead sorting and phenotypic and functional analyses performed.

Vascular occlusion involving 70% of the liver for 1 hour followed by 6 hours reperfusion induces hepatocyte necrosis and release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as the TLR9 ligand self-DNA. Self-DNA engages TLR9 in hepatic pDC that, in turn, are activated and release comparatively large amounts of type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1). Thereafter, IFN-\u03b1 engages its receptor (IFNAR) on hepatocytes and induces transcription of IRF-1, a key pro-inflammatory factor involved in the pathogenesis of I/R injury, able to perpetuate liver damage and release new DAMPs. Blocking of type I IFN using neutralizing anti-IFN-\u03b1 mAb down-regulates hepatocyte IRF-1 with a concomitant reduction in hepatocyte apoptosis (decreased levels of Fas and DR5) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in reduced liver damage. +++, elevated expression."}
