{"title": "Comparative performance of four nucleic acid amplification tests for SARS-CoV-2 virus 2", "body": "amplification tests (NAATs) have been rapidly developed and quickly applied to 23 clinical testing during the pandemic. However, studies evaluating the performance of 24 these NAAT assays are limited. We evaluated the performance of four NAATs, which 25 were marked by the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne and widely used in China during the 26 pandemic. Results showed that the analytical sensitivity of the four assays was 27 significantly lower than that claimed by the NAAT manufacturers. The limit of 28 detection (LOD) of Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs was 3000 copies/mL, 29 whereas the LOD of Bioperfectus NAATs was 4000 copies/mL. The results of the 30 consistency test using 46 samples showed that Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs 31 could detect the samples with a specificity of 100% (30/30) and a sensitivity of 100% 32 (16 /16), whereas Bioperfectus NAAT detected the samples with a specificity of 100% 33 (30/30) and a sensitivity 81.25% (13/16). The sensitivity of Bioperfectus NAAT was 34 lower than that of the three other NAATs; this finding was consistent with the result 35 that Bioperfectus NAAT had a higher LOD than the three other kinds of NAATs. The 36 four above mentioned reagents presented high specificity; however, for the detection 37 of the samples with low virus concentration, Bioperfectus reagent had the risk of 38 missing detection. Therefore, the LOD should be considered in the selection of Introduction 46 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly 47 since its recent identification in patients with severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China(1-3). 48 To date, SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than 372,000 patients worldwide and 49 resulted in more than 16,000 deaths (as of March 24, 2020)(4). The World Health 50 Organization (WHO) has declared the Chinese outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 51 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and stated 52 that the spread of COVID-19 may be interrupted by early detection, isolation, prompt 53 treatment, and the implementation of a robust system(4, 5). On March 11, at a regular 54 press conference in Geneva, WHO Director-General Tan Desai said that the 55 COVID-19 epidemic can be called a pandemic in terms of its characteristics.\n\nUnfortunately, no drug or vaccine has yet been approved to treat human coronaviruses, 57 and new interventions are likely to require months to years to develop(6). Therefore, 58 early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is important to distinguish it from 59 asymptomatic, healthy, and other pathogenic infections and to ensure timely isolation 60 of the infected patients.\n\nAt present, various detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, 63 such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, 64 sequencing, CRISPR technique, nucleic acid mass spectrometry, and serum personnel operation (11) (12) (13) . Moreover, the quality of the examined regents is related 76 closely to the PCR results for SARS-CoV-2. In response to this outbreak, a number of 77 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for SARS-CoV-2 were rapidly developed in 78 China and quickly applied to clinical testing. To date, no quality evaluation of 79 SARS-CoV-2 NAATs has been reported.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the performance of four 82 SARS-CoV-2 NAATs, which were Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (CE) marked and widely 83 used. The results of this study will be helpful for laboratorians to select the 84 appropriate assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2.

If more than 95% of the results were positive, the concentration was 142 finally determined as the LOD of the reagent. The experiments were spread over 3 143 days so that the standard deviations reflect the performance of the assay over a range 144 of typical laboratory conditions but without a change in reagent lots. Accuracy. Ten positive reference materials and two negative reference materials from 155 the performance verification reference material kit were used to evaluate accuracy. Analytical interferences. To investigate the analytical interferences, three 168 interference reference materials from the performance verification reference material 169 kit were used, including 6 g/dL hemoglobin, 30 g/dL albumin, and the mix of 100 170 \u00b5g/mL ribavirin and 100 \u00b5g/mL azithromycin. All tests were repeated three times. all four systems were less than 4%, and the total CVs were less than 5% (Table 2) . Analytical interferences. An assessment of interferences is shown in Table 3 . The 232 bias of Ct value for the N gene and ORF1ab gene on all four systems was less than 233 8.5% at the following interfering substance concentrations tested: 6 g/dL hemoglobin, 234 30 g/dL albumin, 100 \u00b5g/mL ribavirin, and 100 \u00b5g/mL azithromycin.\n\nComparison of the four NAATs.

The RNA detection data from clinical 268 samples showed that the LOD of Bioperfectus NAAT was slightly higher than that of 269 the three other reagents but still reached the detection sensitivity of 20 copies per PCR In the present study, we further compared four NAATs for the detection of The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 and Hybribio reagents were all close to 40, indicating that the concentration of the 286 three samples may be lower than the LOD of Bioperfectus. Therefore, the LOD Obtaining high-quality viral RNA from original clinical samples is crucial to ensure 296 the accuracy of the detection results by NAATs. Therefore, the poor quality of 297 extraction reagents and the unoptimized extraction process of viral RNA would affect 298 the detection results. In this study, the performance of NAATs was evaluated by using 299 the same viral RNA samples. Therefore, the difference in the experimental results 300 only reflected the difference in the performance of nucleic acid amplification for 301 NAATs but not the diversity in the performance of the whole SARS-CoV-2 detection 302 system, which usually includes the nucleic acid extraction system. In summary, the four SARS-CoV-2 NAATs commonly used with commercial assays 313 showed good reliability, but the actual LOD was significantly higher than the declared 314 LOD.
