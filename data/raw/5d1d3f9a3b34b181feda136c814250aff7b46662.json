{"title": "Transcription factor Sox11b is involved in spinal cord regeneration in adult zebrafish", "body": "cord injury (Agrawal and Schaffer, 2005; Bambakidis et al., 2005; Conti and Cattaneo, 2008) . However, little is known about the mechanisms of activation and subsequent neural differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells by which we can gain further insights into the optimization of regenerative neurogenesis in mammals.\n\nAdult zebrafish have an impressively high regenerative capacity and can recover from spinal cord injury almost to the extent of their original swimming ability before the injury (Becker et al., 1998; Becker et al., 2004; Bhatt et al., 2004; Fetcho et al., 2008) . Therefore, zebrafish have become an attractive model for exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying regeneration and adult neurogenesis after spinal cord injury. To analyze the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this intrinsic ability to regenerate we identified damageinduced gene expression changes in the injured spinal cord caudal to the lesion site by microarray expression profiling. This strategy has been used to discover regulated genes in a successfully regenerating adult central nervous system of zebrafish (Veldman et al., 2007) as well as mammalian systems that do not regenerate (Biase et al., 2005; Carmel 2001 ). Using this system, we have identified a large set of genes regulated during spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish, including the transcription factor Sox11b, up-regulated in its expression after spinal cord injury. Since little is known of the role of Sox11b in central nervous system (CNS) regeneration, we chose to investigate its function in zebrafish spinal cord injury.\n\nThe Sox family of transcription factors is characterized by the presence of a HMG (high mobility group)-box sequence motif (Pevny and Lovell-Badge, 1997; Bowles et al., 2000; Schepers et al., 2002) . Sox proteins bind DNA sequences with an HMG domain, allowing them to function as transcription factors. According to the sequence homologies of the HMG domain, Sox proteins are divided into groups A-H (Bowles et al., 2000; Schepers et al., 2002) and are expressed in a tissue-specific manner during development, in which the Cgroup Sox11 (including two gene duplicates in zebrafish, Sox11a and Sox11b (Martino et al., 2000) ) is mainly expressed in neural progenitor cells that have already been committed to neuronal differentiation (Kamachi et al., 2000; Uwanogho et al., 1995) . In chicken, maturing neurons express Sox11 transiently as they leave the neural epithelium (Uwanogho et al., 1995) . In mice, the developing CNS prominently expresses Sox11 genes but the expression is down-regulated as neuronal development progresses (Hargrave et al., 1997; Southard-Smith et al., 1998) . The expression of Sox11 remains at a very low level in adult mice, being prominently expressed in the neurogenic areas of the adult brain (Haslinger et al., 2009) . The specific expression patterns of Sox11 genes suggest that they function at early stages of neural development, especially in the transition from immature to mature neurons. Much evidence shows that Sox11b expression is highly up-regulated in developing retinal ganglion cells of zebrafish during regeneration of the optic nerve (Veldman et al., 2007) and in dorsal root ganglion neurons after mouse sciatic nerve transection (Tanabe et al., 2003) . Transient forebrain ischemia enhances Sox11 gene expression in the brain regions where neuronal progenitors and immature neurons are enriched (Kim et al., 2008) . Given that specific developmental regulatory genes functioning during neural development are also present in endogenous neural stem cells and can be induced after injury (Veldman et al., 2007; Schepers et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2008; Bergsland et al., 2006) , we wished to explore the function of Sox11b during endogenous regeneration after spinal cord injury.\n\nHere, using a zebrafish spinal cord injury model, we report that Sox11b is predominantly expressed in ependymal cells lining the central canal and in newly-differentiating neuronal precursors or immature neurons of the gray matter. Moreover, Sox11b regulates the expression of neural stem cell associated gene Nestin and the proneural gene Achaete-scute complex-like 1a (Ascl1a, also named Mash1a) in the injured spinal cord. Most importantly, morpholino-based suppression of Sox11b expression specifically impairs locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury. These data suggest that Sox11b is a critical transcription factor that contributes to regenerative neurogenesis via endogenous stem cells after spinal cord injury in the adult zebrafish.\n\nAdult zebrafish (Danio rerio), 6 months old, were bought from Aquatica Tropicals (Plant City, FL). The body lengths for all fish were 2-3 cm. Before surgery, the fish were kept in groups of 10 with a light cycle of 14 hours light and 10 hours dark at a temperature of 28\u00b0C.\n\nAll animal experiments were approved by the Rutgers University Animal Care Committee. Spinal cord transection was performed as previously described (Becker et al., 1997) . Briefly, fish were anesthetized by immersion in 0.033% aminobenzoic acid ethylmethylester (MS222, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 5 min. A longitudinal incision was made at the side of the fish to expose the vertebral column, which was then cut between two vertebrae at a level halfway between the dorsal fin and the operculum, about 4 mm caudal to the brainstem/spinal cord transitional zone. Wounds were sealed with Histoacryl (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany), and the fish were kept individually at room temperature for up to 6 weeks following surgery. As control, a sham injury was performed by making the incision but without injury to the spinal cord.\n\nAnimals were anesthetized and intraperitoneally injected with BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine) (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (2.5 mg/ml) in a volume of 50 \u03bcl immediately after the transection.\n\nIn total, we studied 6 groups of injured or sham-injured control fish for survival times of 4 hrs, 12 hrs, and 11 days. Total RNA was isolated from 5 pooled spinal cords (5 mm caudally away from the lesion site) per time point using Qiagen RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total 200 ng of RNA was used for Agilent Zebrafish Oligo Microarray (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) analysis. Samples were labeled using the NuGEN (San Carlos, CA) WT-Ovation kit and hybridized at the Bionomics Research & Technology Center (Rutgers University). Microarray assays were performed on three biological replicate spinal cord pools per time point. Gene expression results were imported and analyzed using Agilent GeneSpring GX software. Data were quantile normalized, filtered for detectable expression in 50% of the samples, and then tested by 2-way ANOVA (treatment, time) at 5% FDR. Hierarchical clustering and gene ontology analysis were performed using Agilent GeneSpring GX software or R/Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org).\n\nFor qPCR analysis, first-strand cDNA was generated using random primers and Superscript\u2122 II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The PCR primers were designed using Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The following primer sequences were used: Sox11b, 5'-cgagttcccggactattgca-3' and 5'-tctcccgcgatcatctcact-3';\n\nAscl1a, 5'-cgccaagatggaaataagcg-3' and 5'-caagcaggtggcatgaactg-3';\n\nNestin, 5'-cggcccttgatccgttataa-3' and 5'-accgatgtggtgtgaggtttc-3'; Ribosomal protein P0, 5'-atcggctacccaactcttgct-3' and 5'-tgtttcgacagtgacagccag-3'.\n\nReverse transcribed mRNA was amplified in the presence of SYBR green (Applied Biosystems). Accumulation of fluorescence was monitored during amplification in an Applied Biosystems 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems), using 10 \u03bcl reactions in 384-well plates. All assays were performed on triplicate samples. All assay products were validated using melting curves to confirm the presence of single PCR products. Ribosomal protein P0 served as the internal control for qPCR.\n\nIn situ hybridization for Sox11b, Oct4, Nestin, Ascl1a\n\nIn situ hybridization probes (sense and antisense probes) for Sox11b (NM_131337.1), Nestin (XM_001919887.1), Ascl1a (NM_131219.1) and Oct4 (NM_131112) were transcribed in vitro from purified RT-PCR fragments. Each amplified probe was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) containing the T7 promoter sequence: 5'-ccctatagtgagtcgtatta-3' and SP6 promoter sequence: 5'-atttaggtgacactatagaa-3'. All four probes were transcribed in vitro using the SP6 MEGAScript Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) or T7 MEGAScript Kit (Ambion) as described previously (Tongiorgi et al., 1995) .\n\nNon-radioactive detection of mRNA in sections of adult zebrafish CNS was performed as published previously (Bernhardt et al., 1996) . The spinal cords were fixed for 6 hrs in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.0), followed by incubation in 15% sucrose in PBS overnight. Then, 15 \u03bcm sections of spinal cords were cut from fresh-frozen tissue on a cryostat. The sections were pre-hybridized for 3 hrs at 55\u00b0C, and hybridized with the DIGlabeled probes at 55\u00b0C overnight. After extensive washing (at 55\u00b0C), alkaline phosphatasecoupled anti-DIG Fab fragment antibodies (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) were applied at 4\u00b0C overnight. Antibody binding was detected using an alkaline phosphatase reaction with NBT/ BCIP (nitro-blue-tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate; Roche) as substrates. Developing times ranged from several hours to overnight depending on the level of mRNA expression in the spinal cord. Sense probes were developed in parallel under the same conditions as the antisense probes, serving as negative controls. Sham injured control and injured fish were analyzed on the same microscopic slides. Sections were viewed and photographed using an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).\n\nImmunohistochemical staining was performed following standard methods. Sections were prepared as described above and incubated with primary antibody against HuC/D (1:20, Invitrogen), GFAP (1:200, Invitrogen), NG2 (1:100, Millipore, Billerica, MA), BrdU (1:200, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (1:500, Invitrogen) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. Fluorescence images were collected using an Axiophot microscope. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating the sections for 30 min in 2N HCl for BrdU immunohistochemistry at 37\u00b0C. For double staining experiments, in situ hybridization preceded immunohistochemistry as described previously (Chen et al., 2007) .\n\nBrdU positive cells in the wall of the central canal were counted in the same region of the spinal cord both in sham-injured control and injured zebrafish. Ten consecutive cross sections (from the lesion site to the caudal part of the spinal cord) per zebrafish were selected for counting by fluorescence microscopy. The average number of cells was used for statistical analysis. The observer was blinded to experimental treatments. The same BrdU pulse labeling assay was applied to the fish that received standard control morpholino treatment and the fish that received Sox11b antisense morpholino treatment.\n\nSox11b vivo-morpholino (5'-CTGTGCTCCGTCTGCTGCACCATGT-3', vivo-porter coupled, Gene Tools, Philomath, OR) and Ascl1a vivo-morpholino (5'-TTTCCATCTTGGCGGTGATGTCCAT-3', vivo-porter coupled) and standard control morpholino (5'-CCTCTTACCTCAGTT-3', vivo-porter coupled) were dissolved in Danieau solution (Nasevicius and Ekker, 2000) and soaked onto small pieces of Gelfoam (Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI) in a volume of 6 \u03bcl. These pieces of Gelfoam were divided into 30 smaller pieces to yield 600 ng of morpholino per piece and allowed to dry. Per zebrafish, one of these pieces was applied to the spinal transection site immediately after performing the transection. The wound was sealed with Histoacryl and each animal was allowed to survive the operation for 6 weeks.\n\nSwimming capabilities of injured fish at 6 weeks after Sox11b morpholino or standard control morpholino treatment were analyzed in two trials of 5 min each (intertrial interval, 4 hrs). In each trial, the zebrafish was placed in a brightly illuminated (100 lux) glass tank (50\u00d730\u00d730 cm) filled with aquarium water (5 cm deep; 25\u00b0C). A video camera recorded the trials from above the tank. We used an ANY-maze video system (Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL) to track swim paths. Mean lengths of the swim paths (\"total distance moved\") of the two trials were used for graphical presentation and statistical analysis. The experimenter was blinded to the treatment of individual zebrafish before testing.\n\nStudent's t-test was used to compare the Sox11b, Nestin and Ascl1a qPCR mRNA levels between experimental group and sham injured control group and also for analysis of the difference in BrdU positive cell numbers and in the swimming behavior between experimental group and sham injured control group. Two-way ANOVA was used to compare the Sox11b mRNA expression between each group in microarray analysis. Differences were considered statistically significant at p<0.05, marked with an asterisk (*). Data are presented as mean \u00b1 S.D. of at least 3 independent experiments.\n\nTo investigate damage-induced gene expression of the injured spinal cord, Agilent Zebrafish Oligo Microarray assays were performed. We chose 4 hrs, 12 hrs and 11 days post-injury for harvesting the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site because these times represent the acute and the more chronic response phases of the spinal cord to the injury. A large list of genes was selected by two-way ANOVA as differentiated by treatment (i.e., injury vs. control, 530 genes), time (3,096 genes) or an interaction of the two (6 genes) (GEO accession number: GSE20460. The link for the GEO dataset: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE20460). We explored the literature on many of these genes, and noted that Sox11b (Agilent probe ID A_15_P102878) was of particular interest in the context of regeneration after spinal cord injury. The change in Sox11b expression after injury is shown in Fig. 1A . Microarray analysis indicated that the expression of Sox11b was similar to control during acute injury phase time points (4 hrs or 12 hrs) but had increased significantly by 11 days post injury, with a 2.44 \u00b1 0.117 fold change from sham-injured control at this time (1.00 \u00b1 0.009; p<0.01; Fig. 1A , Table 1 ). qPCR analysis confirmed the array results, producing 1.66 \u00b1 0.135 fold (Table 2) or 1.83 \u00b1 0.156 fold from control in two separate sets of fish. While this effect of injury is not large, it was highly reproducible and statistically significant in every assay that was performedperhaps only a subset of cells in the dissected tissue express Sox11b and therefore the effect has been diluted in the dissected tissue samples. Examining ANOVA-selected array results by K-means clustering (not shown), GAP-43 mRNA was found to cluster with Sox11b, suggesting that the pattern of regulation of Sox11b after spinal cord injury was similar to other regeneration-associated genes. We chose to identify cells expressing Sox11b to better understand its function after injury.\n\nTo determine which cell types express Sox11b, we performed in situ hybridization. At 12 hrs post-injury, expression of Sox11b mRNA increased in the injured spinal cords compared to the sham-injured controls ( Fig. 1B-J) . Sox11b expression was mainly in ependymal cells lining the central canal and in some cells located in the gray matter and dorsal column. At 3 and 11 days post-injury, the hybridization signal for Sox11b mRNA continued to increase relative to sham-injured controls. In addition, more Sox11b positive cells appeared in the gray matter compared to 12 hrs post-injury samples ( Fig. 1B-J) . At 6 weeks post-injury, Sox11b expression returned to normal levels (Data not shown). BrdU, a thymidine analog that is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells during S-phase, labels mitotic cells. We used pulse labeling with BrdU to find newly generated cells in the spinal cord. At 3 days post-injury, the number of BrdU-positive proliferative cells increased compared to shaminjured controls, mainly in ependymal cells lining the central canal ( Fig. 2A, 2B) . Moreover, double labeling of BrdU and HuC/D, a marker of neuronally committed stem cells or immature neurons (Marusich et al., 1994) , showed that the immunofluorescence signal for BrdU co-localized on some ependymal cells (Fig. 2C) . These data suggest that ependymal cells could differentiate toward neurons in response to injury.\n\nTo investigate the migration of newly generated cells, we applied the same BrdU pulse labeling assay to fish that received Sox11b antisense morpholino treatment and standard control morpholino treatment. At 3 days after BrdU application, BrdU-positive cells were mainly localized in the wall of the central canal ( Fig. 2A-C) . But, at 11 days after BrdU application, few BrdU-positive cells were in the wall of central canal while more BrdUpositive cells were present in the gray matter of spinal cord (Fig. 3A) , indicating that newly generated cells migrated toward gray matter from the wall of central canal. By comparison, fish that received Sox11b antisense morpholino treatment had less BrdU-positive cells in the wall of the central canal (at 3 days after injury) and the gray matter of spinal cord (at 11 days after injury) than fish that had received standard control morpholino treatment (Fig. 3A) .\n\nTo identify the Sox11b-positive cells in the spinal cord parenchyma, we double stained with in situ hybridization for Sox11b and immunohistochemistry for NG2, GFAP and HuC/D. NG2 is a marker for oligodendrocyte precursor cells. GFAP is a marker for mature and reactive astrocytes. Immunofluorescence signals for NG2 or GFAP did not co-localize with the in situ hybridization signal for Sox11b, indicating the lack of Sox11b expression in glialrestricted precursor cells and astrocytes. However, immunofluorescence signal for HuC/D co-localized with in situ hybridization signal for Sox11b. This result suggests that the Sox11b-positive cells in the spinal cord parenchyma are newly-differentiating neuronal precursors and/or immature neurons (Fig. 3B) .\n\nBecause ependymal cells and newly-differentiating neuronal precursors expressed Sox11b, we hypothesized that Sox11b participates in neurogenesis initiated by endogenous ependyma-derived neural stem cells. Therefore we investigated the relationship between injury-induced Sox11b expression and the neural stem cell associated gene, Nestin. qPCR showed that expression of Nestin mRNA in the injured spinal cords did not differ from sham-injured controls at 4 and 12 hrs post-injury. But at 11 days post-injury, Nestin expression significantly increased in injured spinal cords compared to sham-injured controls ( Table 2 ). The in situ hybridization signal was clearly visible at 3 and 11 days post-injury, while hybridization signals were very weak both at 12 hrs post-injury and in the shaminjured controls (Fig. 4A-F) . Significantly, Nestin was also primarily expressed in ependymal cells lining the central canal and in some cells located in the spinal cord parenchyma (Fig. 4A-F) , closely resembling the expression pattern of Sox11b. Double staining with in situ hybridization for Nestin and immunohistochemistry for HuC/D showed that only few cells were co-labeled. One possible explanation is that Nestin and HuC/D are markers of different kinds of cells. Nestin is a marker for neural stem cells, whereas HuC/D is a marker for neuronally committed stem cells or immature neurons. Only few neuronally committed stem cells were co-labeled with nestin and HuC/D. Taken together, these results reveal that Sox11b is expressed both in neural stem cells and neuronally committed stem cells after injury.\n\nTo evaluate the effect of Sox11b on Nestin expression, we inhibited translation of Sox11b mRNA in the spinal cord by applying antisense morpholino to the injury site at the time of injury. Given the time points that Sox11 is up-regulated post-injury, we chose to assess Nestin expression at 3 and 11 days after morpholino treatment. Interestingly, Sox11b antisense morpholino treatment strongly reduced Nestin expression in the caudal spinal cord (Table 3 ) compared with standard control morpholino treatment. These results indicate that Sox11b is involved in regulating the Nestin expression in the caudal part of the spinal cord after injury.\n\nSince the HMG domain is known to regulate target gene expression by pairing with specific partner proteins, we searched for a partner protein corresponding to Sox11b. We examined the expression of Oct4 (POU5F1), a POU transcription factor family member, using in situ hybridization. Oct4 expression was clearly visible in the spinal cord after injury (Fig. 5A-E) . Oct4 mRNA was primarily expressed in ependymal cells lining the central canal and in some cells of the gray matter, closely resembling the expression pattern of Sox11b ( Fig. 1B -J).\n\nSince expression of Sox11b is largely restricted to newly-differentiating neuronal precursors or immature neurons in spinal cord parenchyma, and because of its involvement in regulating the Nestin expression in the caudal spinal cord after injury, we hypothesized that Sox11b regulated neurogenesis after spinal cord injury. To test this hypothesis we examined the expression of the proneural bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) transcription factor Ascl1a (also named Mash1a) in the spinal cord caudal to lesion site. Ascl1a participates in neuronal differentiation and subtype specification during embryogenesis (Helms et al., 2005; Parras et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2007; Fausett et al., 2008) . Its expression after spinal cord injury is significantly greater than in sham-injured controls (Fig. 6A, Table 1 ). qPCR confirmed the microarray results (Table 2 ). In situ hybridization data showed Ascl1a expression in the caudal part of spinal cord at 12 hrs after injury and continued upregulation of the gene at 3 and 11 days after injury (Fig. 6B-G) , with an expression pattern similar to that of Sox11b ( Fig. 1B-J) . However, as contrast to Sox11b, Ascl1a expression was stronger in cells of the spinal cord parenchyma and weaker in ependymal cells lining the central canal.\n\nTo determine whether Sox11b induction participates in up-regulation of Ascl1a expression, we administered Sox11b antisense morpholino, Ascl1a antisense morpholino, or standard control morpholino to acutely injured spinal cords and examined Ascl1a and Sox11b expression by qPCR. At 3 days post-injury, Sox11b antisense morpholino treatment significantly reduced Ascl1a expression compared with standard control morpholino-treated spinal cords (Table 3) . At 11 days post-injury, Sox11b antisense morpholino treatment had no effect on Ascl1a mRNA expression (Table 3) . At 3 days post-injury, Ascl1a antisense morpholino treatment increased Sox11b expression compared to standard control morpholino (Table 4 ). These results suggest that Sox11b expression may be necessary for Ascl1a expression after injury. In addition, Ascl1a antisense morpholino-treated spinal cord exhibited an increase in the expression of Nestin (Table 4 ). Double staining by in situ hybridization for Ascl1a and immunofluorescence staining for HuC/D indicated that Ascl1a was expressed in cells of the spinal cord parenchyma, co-localizing with the immunofluorescence signal for HuC/D (Fig. 6H-K) . Taken together, these results indicate that Ascl1a expression induced by Sox11b does not promote the maintenance of neural stem cells, but may promote their differentiation toward a neuronal lineage.\n\nTo examine the effects of reduced Sox11b expression on functional recovery, we quantified locomotor activity by measuring distance moved in 5 min (Becker et al., 2004) in fish treated with Sox11b antisense or standard control morpholino. At 6 weeks after injury the total distance moved was 9.1 \u00b1 5.9 m (n=4) for fish treated with Sox11b antisense morpholino, and 16.9 \u00b1 3.8 m (n=6, p<0.05) for fish treated with standard control morpholino. Thus, fish that had received Sox11b antisense morpholino moved 46% less than fish that had received standard control morpholino (Fig. 7A, B ).\n\nIn this study, we report that after spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish, ependymal cells lining the central canal proliferate rapidly in response to injury and express Nestin, a neural stem cell marker (Mahler and Driever, 2007) . Some BrdU-positive ependymal cells express the marker of newly-differentiating neuronal precursors, suggesting that ependymal cells serve as stem cells and differentiate into neurons after spinal cord injury. Previous data have indicated that cells with astroglial characteristics act as stem cells in the adult CNS of mammals (Alvarez-Buylla et al., 2001) . More recent findings demonstrate that stem cells in the adult zebrafish cerebellum are not typical glia but instead exhibit neuroepithelial cell characteristics (Kaslin et al., 2009) . Similarly, in the spinal cord injury model of adult zebrafish, ependymo-radial glial cells are progenitor cells for spinal motoneurons (Reimer et al., 2008) . Genetic fate mapping was used to characterize candidate neural stem cells within the ependymal cell population, which differentiated into astrocytes/oligodendrocytes and migrated towards the injury site to participate in regeneration after spinal cord injury in the mouse (Meletis et al., 2008) . Our results are in agreement with these findings, highlighting that ependymal cells are likely to be endogenous neural stem cells mobilized after spinal cord injury.\n\nMoreover, Sox11b expression is induced in ependymal cells lining the central canal and in newly-differentiating neuronal precursors or immature neurons located in the spinal cord parenchyma. Treatment of Sox11b antisense morpholino reduced BrdU-positive cells in the wall of the central canal and inhibited migration of newly generated cells toward the gray matter. Previous studies indicate that Sox11 expression is strictly confined to doublecortin-expressing neuronally committed precursors in the adult rodent brain (Haslinger et al., 2009 ). More importantly, reducing expression of Sox11b in adult zebrafish impairs locomotor recovery after injury. Together, these results suggest that Sox11b, up-regulated in ependymal cells and newly-generated neurons in the spinal cord, plays an important role in regulating endogenous proliferation and neurogenic determination after spinal cord injury, which contribute to the locomotor recovery in the adult zebrafish.\n\nTreatment with Sox11b antisense morpholino dramatically reduced Nestin expression after spinal cord injury. Given that Nestin marks immature neural cells in the developing nervous system or neural stem cells in the adult central nervous system of zebrafish (Mahler and Driever, 2007) , the ability of Sox11b to regulate Nestin expression suggests that it influences endogenous neural stem cell fate. The regenerative process after spinal cord injury is likely to recapitulate at least to some extent neural development during embryogenesis. Sox11, with its HMG domain, is a key player in the regulation of embryonic nervous system development and determination of the cell fate, especially in the developmental stage from immature to mature neurons (Uwanogho et al., 1995; Hargrave et al., 1997; Southard-Smith et al., 1998) . The HMG domain regulates target gene expression by pairing with specific partner factors (Kamachi et al., 2000) . Much evidence indicates that SOX and POU gene families interact with each other during development (Kamachi et al., 2000; Kuhlbrodt et al., 1998; Dailey and Basilico, 2001; Wilson and Koopman, 2002) . Recent studies also indicate that an enhancer, located in the second intron and including a POU factor binding site (Josephson et al., 1998; Lothian and Lendahl, 1997) , regulates Nestin expression in the neural tube during rat embryonic development. Furthermore, a potential Sox protein binding site is present in the 258bp mouse Nestin enhancer, immediately upstream of the POU binding site. Combinations of Sox2-POU and Sox11-POU activate Nestin transcription by binding to its enhancer in mice (Tanaka et al., 2004; Jin et al., 2006) . The identity of the member of POU family that cooperates with Sox11b to activate Nestin expression is not known. Our finding of the similarity of spatio-temporal increasing co-expression of Sox11b and Oct4 of the POU family in injured spinal cords supports the view that Sox11b associates with POU family members (of which one member is Oct4, POU5F1, POUV) to regulate Nestin expression after spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish.\n\nAscl1 is a proneural bHLH transcription factor involved in neuronal differentiation and subtype specification during the nervous system development (Helms et al., 2005; Parras et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2007; Fausett et al., 2008) . Our data show that spinal cord injury induces Ascl1a expression in a similar expression pattern as Sox11b. Ascl1a expression, however, is strong in cells of the spinal cord parenchyma and weak in ependymal cells lining the central canal. Since Ascl1a is involved in differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons and suppressing expression of Ascl1a increased expression of Nestin, a reasonable interpretation is that the more neuronally differentiated neural stem cells express AscI1a in the injured spinal cord. Moreover, suppressing Sox11b expression reduced Ascl1a expression. These results suggest that Ascl1a may be a downstream target gene of Sox11b and that Ascl1a is not involved in the maintenance of the endogenous neural stem cell pool. After spinal cord injury, up-regulation of Sox11b may then regulate neuronal determination in stem cells, and Sox11b-induced up-regulation of Ascl1a expression may contribute to neurogenesis by promoting neuronal differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells. The functional relationships between Sox11 and Ascl1 are, however, poorly understood. Some studies report that proneural bHLH proteins, such as Ngn2 and Ascl1, induce Sox4/11 expression (Bergsland et al., 2006) . Therefore, more studies are needed to establish the functional relationship between Sox11b and Ascl1a.\n\nRecently, it has been shown that human glioma-initiating cells lose Sox11 expression and over-expression of Sox11 prevents tumorigenesis of glioma-initiating cells by inducing neuronal differentiation (Hide et al., 2009) . In line with this view is that in adult zebrafish Sox11b expression is enhanced after spinal cord injury and mobilizes endogenous neural stem cells to contribute to neurogenesis by promoting neuronal determination. Stem cell availability and neuronal-differentiating potential may be critical factors for determining regeneration after spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish. In mammals, the capability of constitutive proliferation and neurogenesis is limited, correlating with the capacity to regenerate after injury. Moreover, in mammals progenitor cells are thought to be responsible for the generation of astrocytes, leading to the formation of an inhibitory tissue environment for neurogenesis (Horner et al., 2000; Mothe and Tator, 2005) . As shown in our study, Sox11b participates in the transcriptional regulation of specific gene expression (including Nestin and Ascl1a) to organize a distinct neurogenic niche containing neural stem cells that differentiate into immature neurons in adult zebrafish. Therefore, enhancing Sox11b expression to promote proliferation and neurogenic determination of endogenous neural stem cells after injury may be a promising strategy in restorative therapy after spinal cord injury in mammals.\n\nIn summary, our study shows that Sox11b can promote neuronal determination of endogenous stem cells and regenerative neurogenesis after spinal cord injury in the adult zebrafish by regulating the expression of Ascl1a. Enhancing Sox11b expression to mobilize endogenous neural stem cells after injury may be a promising therapeutic strategy to promote regeneration after spinal cord injury in mammals. "}
