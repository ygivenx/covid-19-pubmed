Schematics of the mRNA constructs used in this study and then inserted between EcoRI and SalI sites of pCMVTnT_rluc_3tag.\n\nThe dual-fluorescent protein constructs were prepared by essentially the same procedure above. A DNA fragment encoding EmGFP was amplified by PCR with a forward primer 5\u02b9-d (GAG TCG ACG   TGA GCA AGG GCG AGG AGC TGT TCA CC) containing either the F-VPK, M1-VPK, or M2-VPK sequence were prepared by inserting the dsDNA fragment corresponding to each sequence between EcoRI and SalI sites of pCMVTnT_mito_mCherry_EmGFP as described above.\n\nWe generated an MMTV slippery site variant with the NCTn-responsive downstream secondary structure. The spacing between the stimulatory elements was unchanged compared to the MMTV frameshifting site. The codon located two codons upstream of the slippery sequence was changed to AUG, which was used as the start codon for 70S initiation. The immediate upstream codon of the slippery sequence was changed to GGA (Gly). The slippery sequence AAC (Asn) codon was mutated to AAG (Lys). The codon following the slippery sequence UUG (Leu) was mutated to UUA (Leu).\n\nThese replacements were introduced to simplify the separation and quantification of peptides in \u22121 and 0 frames by RP HPLC.\n\nThe following mRNA variants were used in the purified E. coli in vitro translation assay (start codon values were calculated by fitting the data to a sigmoidal curve using a four-parameter logistic model.\n\nEach data point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of four replicates.
