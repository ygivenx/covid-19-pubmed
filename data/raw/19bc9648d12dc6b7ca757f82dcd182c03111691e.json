{"title": "Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): An Updated Systematic Review", "body": "COVID-19 among different studies, partly due to anthropogenic differences in patients enrolled and differences in sample size across different studies. Notably, variation in reporting descriptive data may lead to the misunderstanding of COVID-9 characteristics. In this updated systematic review, hence, we sought to address the heterogeneities among published retrospective studies and to synthesize the available data. We expect this critical review will provide insights to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in a more systematic manner.\n\nSystematic searches were performed via the Medline database (PubMed) and Embase combining the terms (novel coronavirus OR 2019 novel coronavirus OR 2019-nCoV OR Coronavirus disease 2019 OR COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2). We also searched the database of Chinese Medical Journal full-text database (http://journal.yiigle.com/) for publications in Chinese using the above strategies. Searches were limited to publications from January 1, 2020 to March 1, 2020.\n\nTwo of the authors (Z. F. and F. Y.) independently screened searching results to determine inclusion or exclusion of the articles. Disagreements were modulated by consulting another author as adjudicator (Z. L.). We included retrospective observational studies as long as they contain clinical characteristics of COVID-19 associated illness. If the patients came from the same hospital with overlapping cases, we only selected the publication containing greatest number of cases. The following All included literatures were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) 11 .\n\nThe quality score of the literature ranged from lowest 0 to highest 9. Total quality score of 0-3, 4-6, and 7-9 indicated poor, fair, and good studies, respectively.\n\nInformation on baseline demographic data, medical and exposure history, symptoms and signs, underlying comorbidities, laboratory findings, chest computed tomographic (CT) scans and CFR were recorded. Based on the diagnostic gold standard for COVID-19 (positive RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2), we synthesized data on demographic and clinical parameters in an unbiased manner. The proportion of each parameter was calculated by the following formula: (actual patient counts)/ (total patients confirmed using the gold standard) \u00d7 100%. The \n\nA total of 1052 publications were retrieved using the search strategy. Seventy-two retrospective studies (including 22 case report, 20 case series, 3 case-control and 27 cross-sectional studies) that met the inclusion criteria were included in the final analysis ( Figure 1 ). Of the selected publications, 51 were written in English while 21 were written in Chinese. The general information on eligible publications can be found in Table 1 \n\nThe most common symptom of COVID- 19 Table 3 for details). Figure 3A ), with either bilateral or unilateral ground-glass/consolidative pulmonary opacities. Laboratory blood tests showed that\n\nCollectively, a total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall CFR was 3.7% ( Table 2) . Our further analysis showed that COVID-19 patients admitted in Hubei province (Wuhan in particular) suffered from a significant higher ICU admission rate than that outside of Hubei, China (21.9% vs.\n\n2.5%, p<0.001). Also, CFR attributed to COVID-19 in Hubei province, China was significantly higher than that in non-Hubei, China (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001). indicating that COVID-19 may not have a gender predisposition. Although 13.2% of the selected patients had a history of smoking, we could not draw the conclusion that smokers are less susceptible to the viral infection than non-smokers, as the patients All rights reserved.

This is of great importance for early quarantine for the subjects with emerging infectious disease when specific treatments are not available.\n\nActually, we have learned from the SARS outbreak 17 years ago that early identification, early isolation and early management would lead to the stop of viral transmissions from human to human 79 . Collectively, there were 36% of the COVID-19 patients absent from fever as the onset symptom. In this case, such patients may have been ignored at the early stage if we focused heavily on fever examination for initial screening. Our composite analysis showed that fever remains the most common symptom (83.0%) in patients with COVID-19. However, the proportion of fever is somewhat lower than that of other coronavirus related respiratory illness, such as SARS (100%) 80 81 or middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) (98%) 82 . Similarly, the accompanied symptoms of dyspnea (14.5%) and diarrhea (6.1%) are relatively less common in patients with COVID-19 than those seen in SARS and MERS 87 . More importantly, this study revealed an overall CFR of 3.7%, which was quite similar to that reported by the WHO official statistics as of March 5, 2020 (CFR 3.7%, 3,015 died of 80,565 cases) 4 . Nevertheless, the CFR of COVID-19 was much lower than that of SARS (9.6%) 83 and MERS (37.1%) 84 . By far, the mechanisms underlying the varying symptoms and CFR for these three coronavirus-infected diseases are not fully understood. One reason may be that there were still some COVID-19 patients being treated in hospitals at the time of the manuscripts submitted, so the outcome (death or recovery) is not known yet.\n\nAdditionally, we suppose that the varied tropism as well as virulence of these three coronaviruses may in part account for the discrepancies, which warrants further investigations.\n\nAccording to the seven version Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel All rights reserved.
