{"title": "Supplementary Materials IFITM3 directly engages and shuttles incoming virus particles to lysosomes", "body": "Supplementary Table 1 | CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations in IFITM1, 2 and 3 in HeLa and A549 clones. The target genome of IFITM2 and IFITM3 in HeLa clones was verified by gene sequencing. The expression levels of IFITM2/3 in A549 clone and IFITM1 in all clones were verified by WB analysis. (c) Exogenous dextran trafficking in A549 WT and IFITM2/3-KO cells. Cells were treated with 50 \u03bcg/ml dextran-pHrodo-red for 4 h and cultured for another 20 h in fluorophore-free growth medium. Next, cells were treated for 10 min with 100 \u03bcg/ml dextran-Alexa-488 and shifted for 5 min to fluorophore-free growth medium for indicated time periods. (d) Quantification of (c) under 40 min was performed by Image J. 20 cells were randomly picked from each group and the ratio of localization was analyzed under the same threshold. The percentage of merged volume above threshold colocalized was counted by Image J software. The values shown represent the mean and standard deviation (n = 20), as defined by error bars. *P < 0.05 (n = 20), t-test. "}
