{"title": "The epidemiology of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2012-2015", "body": "624 patients (66%) were male, 33% were elderly (>60 years), and 3.2% were children (<20 years) ( Table 1 ). Compared to the other groups, a higher proportion were female in the group of healthcare workers. The largest proportion of cases were from the Riyadh region (n = 369; 39.3%), followed by Jeddah (n = 195; 20.8%) and the Eastern region (n = 125; 13.3%). The majority of cases in Riyadh (n = 197; 53.4%) and Jeddah (n = 197; 91.8%) occurred in 2014, while most cases in the Eastern region (n = 67; 53.6%) were reported in 2015.\n\nPrimary cases and secondary case hospital inpatients were older than household contacts and secondary case healthcare workers ( Figure 1 ).\n\nThe distribution of MERS-CoV cases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from September 2012 to July 2015 by month of symptom onset showed no specific constant seasonal pattern. Most of the cases occurred during the first 6 months of the year (Figure 2 ).\n\nThe location of diagnosis was reported for 788 patients. Of these, 329 patients were diagnosed following presentation with illness. Of the remaining 459 patients who were diagnosed as contacts, 114 were contacts of known cases in the community, 174 were inpatient contacts of known cases, and 171 were healthcare worker contacts (Table 1) . Of the secondary cases, 93 were asymptomatic; this proportion was highest in healthcare workers (32%), followed by household cases (23%).\n\nMedical comorbidities were reported in 421 patients (Table 1) . Overall, 351 patients (44%) had one or more comorbidity; the proportion with comorbidities was higher in patients who were >60 years of age and those who were secondary cases in hospital inpatients. Diabetes was common in all groups (53% overall).\n\nThe case-fatality ratio increased with age, with a mortality of 12.5% in children aged <20 years rising to 86% in elderly patients aged >80 years. In the univariate analysis of patients for whom complete data were available and excluding asymptomatic cases, acquisition as a hospital inpatient, hypertension, renal disease, cardiac disease, and cancer were positively associated with mortality ( Table 2) . On multivariate analysis, age >80 years, cardiac disease, and cancer were independently associated with mortality. Compared to primary cases, mortality was lower in household cases and healthcare workers. The duration from symptom onset to admission was not statistically associated with the disease outcome.\n\nMERS cases were notified to the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) from different regions of the Kingdom. The present data showed that 564 (65.1%) patient cases were notified within 7 days after the onset of symptoms, while 301 (34.8%) patient cases were notified at >7 days after symptom onset (Table 1 ).\n\nIn this series, the risk factors and outcomes of more than 900 cases of MERS-CoV occurring over 3 years are described. These represent 60% of the 1570 cases reported worldwide.\n\nA distinct clinical profile was found in the different populations based on their likely location of acquisition, which reinforces the association of chronic comorbidity and severe infection. While previous studies have noted a lower mortality in secondary cases consistent with a detection bias in primary cases, 8 it was found that the case fatality varied in the different groups with secondary infection. Patients who presented with primary infection were more severely unwell but had a similar mortality as hospital inpatients who acquired the infection in hospital. Healthcare workers and household contacts had a lower mortality, reflecting a lower severity of illness in these populations who were previously well.\n\nThe present findings confirm the association between comorbidities in patients and severe illness. [9] [10] [11] Previous studies have defined obesity, diabetes, and renal disease as risk factors when comparing cases to test-negative hospital-based controls with respiratory illnesses. [8] [9] [10] Diabetes was very common across all groups, including healthcare workers. The high prevalence of renal disease in hospital inpatients reflects the wards in which nosocomial outbreaks occurred.\n\nPatients with secondary infections were detected by active surveillance and therefore are more likely to reflect the full spectrum of illness. Of note, a significant proportion of household infections and healthcare worker infections were reported to be asymptomatic, and previous cases have been noted to have prolonged viral shedding. 5, [12] [13] [14] Similar to a previous study, it was found that acute disease (with a short duration of symptoms at the time of hospital admission) was not associated with increased mortality. 11 It was reassuring to find that the majority of cases were admitted within a week, as early diagnosis is required to ensure that control measures are effective. 15 A small proportion who were asymptomatic was noted; the clinical significance of asymptomatic infection, and particularly the potential for transmission, is not yet known.\n\nThere were several limitations in reviewing this public health database. The data reported here represent almost 90% of the 1045 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but the reasons for the missing data are not apparent. Available clinical data on diagnosis and treatment were scarce, and a significant proportion had missing data on comorbidities. As primary cases were detected following presentation with illness, unknown selection biases may be present. It is not possible to comment on risk factors for the acquisition of MERS-CoV without a control group without infection. "}
