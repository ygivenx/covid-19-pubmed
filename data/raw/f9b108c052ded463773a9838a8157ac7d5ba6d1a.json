Since 2007, large epidemics of Asian genotype Zika virus have been reported around the world (2, 3) .\n\nRecently it has been estimated that one-third of the world population will be infected (4). Most seriously, Zika infection has been found to be associated with serious sequelae such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and microcephaly in newborn infants of mothers infected with Zika virus during pregnancy (5) (6) (7) (8) , and consequently WHO has declared a public health emergency for Zika virus (9) . Zika virus represents a significant challenge to the public health of the whole world but unfortunately there is no effective vaccine or other therapy available so far.\n\nZika virus with a single stranded, positive sense RNA genome of 10.7 kb belongs to the flavivirus genus, which also contains Dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses (4, 10) . Zika virus shares a high degree of sequence and structural homology with other flaviviruses particularly Dengue virus, thus resulting in immunological cross-reactivity (11). Seriously, the current Zika outbreaks are largely localized within dengue-endemic areas, it is thus proposed that preexisting dengueinduced antibodies may enhance Zika infection by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a factor that makes the vaccine approaches extremely challenging (11).\n\nZika genome is translated into a single ~3,500-residue polyprotein, which is further cleaved into 3 structural proteins and 7 non-structural proteins (10) . The correct processing of the polyprotein is essential for replication of all flaviviruses, which requires both host proteases and a viral NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) (10, (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . As a consequence, the flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro has been well-established to be a key target for developing antiviral drugs (10, (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) .

Subsequently we characterized their conformations, catalysis, inhibition and dynamics by both experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results reveal that despite sharing a similarity to the Dengue one, Zika NS2B-NS3pro does have unique catalytic and inhibitory properties, which appear to result from its high dynamics. Furthermore, we identified the first allosteric inhibitor for Zika NS2B-NS3pro. Taken together, our study provides the first insight into the unique dynamics of the Zika NS2B-NS3pro, which may have key implications in further design of better protease inhibitors for fighting Zika.\n\nauthor/funder.

From synthetic genes with E. coli preferred codons, we amplified and subsequently cloned the DNA fragments into His-tagged expression vectors, which encode the isolated NS2B (48-100) with the transmembrane regions deleted (Fig. 1A) ; as well as isolated NS3 (14-185) (Fig. 1B) . The expression level of the recombinant NS2B was extremely low, and consequently we needed to grow many liters of E. coli cells to obtain sufficient NS2B for refolding with NS3pro by the same protocol we previously utilized for the Dengue one (12) . The refolded NS2B-NS3pro with His-tag (column 2 of Fig. 1C ) was cleaved by thrombin covalently linked to beads to remove the His-tag, followed by binding to an excess amount of the Ni 2+ -beads to remove His-tag and uncleaved fusion protein, as well as final purification with FPLC gel-filtration chromatography to obtain unlinked NS2B-NS3pro without His-tag (column 3 of Fig. 1C ). We attempted to refold Zika NS3pro without NS2B and found that NS3pro completely precipitated during refolding, thus indicating that Zika NS3pro also absolutely requests its NS2B cofactor for the correct folding, as previously observed on other flavivirus NS3 proteases (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) .\n\nWe also constructed a Zika protease with NS2B and NS3pro linked by a (Gly)4-Ser-(Gly)4 sequence extensively used for functional and structural characterization of flavivirus NS2B-NS3pro complexes (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . No linked NS2B-NS3pro protein was detected in the supernatant, but we were able to purify a small amount from the inclusion body by the Ni 2+affinity chromatography under the denaturing condition, which was confirmed to be the linked NS2B-NS3pro by sequencing with mass spectrometry and western plot with the His-tag antibody. Linked NS2B-NS3pro was successfully refolded by dialysis without any author/funder. All rights reserved.

Subsequently, linked NS2B-NS3pro without His-tag (column 3 of Fig. 1D ) was obtained by the cleavage with thrombin covalently linked to beads, followed by binding to Ni 2+ -beads and final purification with FPLC gel-filtration chromatography as described above.\n\nBiophysical characterization-We acquired 1 H NMR one-dimensional spectra for both linked and unlinked NS2B-NS3pro ( Fig. 2A) . Both spectra have similar up-field peaks manifested, suggesting that both of them are folded (12, 20, 23, 24) . However, it is interesting to note that the peaks of the linked complex are much more broad than those of the unlinked, implying that the linkage may introduce \u00b5s-ms conformational dynamics, as previously observed on the linked Dengue NS2B-NS3pro (12, 20, 23) . Indeed, we attempted to acquire 1 H-15 N NMR HSQC spectrum of the linked protease, but failed to detect any peaks due to significant peak broadening. By contrast, despite having almost the same sequences, 15 N-labeled Zika NS3pro in the unlinked complex has a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum, indicating that the NS3pro is well-folded, although many HSQC peaks were still too broad to be detectable (Fig. 2B ).\n\nAmazingly, 15 N-labeled Zika NS2B in the unlinked complex has a very narrowly-dispersed HSQC spectrum, in which HSQC peaks of 22 residues are too broad to be detected, and in particular only two out of four Gly residues have HSQC peaks detectable (Fig. 2C ). This is very different from what was previously observed on Dengue NS2B in the complex, which showed a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum with peaks of most residues detectable (12, 20, 23) .\n\nThis implies that Zika NS2B is much more dynamic than Dengue one, in which a portion of residues undergoes \u00b5s-ms dynamics, thus becoming too broad to be detectable; while the rest is disordered and absent of tight packing, thus resulting in narrowly-dispersed HSQC peaks (12, 23, 24) . author/funder.

This suggests that in Zika NS2B-NS3pro, all 4 Trp residues are similarly buried as Dengue ones, as Trp residue in the unfolded proteins has an emission maximum wavelength > 352 nm (24) . Strikingly, however, both linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes have far-UV CD spectra with the maximal negative signal at the wavelength of ~201 nm and is lacking of any positive signal below 200 nm, which is very different from that of unlinked Dengue one of the same length (12) , which has the maximal negative signal at 217 nm and large positive signal at 192 nm ( Fig.   2E ). This strongly suggests that Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes contain much more disordered regions than the Dengue, completely consistent with the NMR HSQC result of the 15 N-labeled NS2B (Fig. 2C) . Unfortunately, the low solubility and \u00b5s-ms conformational dynamics prevented us from conducting NMR assignments of Zika NS2B-NS3pro by triple-resonance NMR experiments.\n\nCharacterization of the enzymatic catalysis-We subsequently characterized the enzymatic properties of both linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes. First, we found that the activity of both complexes showed a very similar dependence on the pH values, with the optimal pH at ~9.5 (Fig. 3A) , very similar to other flavivirus NS2B-NS3pro linked by (Gly4)-Ser-(Gly4) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Amazingly, this is very different from Dengue NS2B-NS3pro, for which the optimal pH significantly switched from basic pH to neutral pH upon separating NS2B from NS3pro (23) . Second, the catalytic activity reduced significantly upon increasing the concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 3B ). In the presence of 150 mM NaCl, the catalytic activity is author/funder.

We also measured the proteolytic activities of our linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes in the same buffer as previously published (17) . Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3C , the Zika NS2B-NS3pro efficiently cleaved Bz-nKRR-AMC, but unexpectedly showed very weak activity on other two. This implies that in addition to requesting dibasic residues at the P1 and P2 sites characteristic of the flaviviral NS3 proteases, Zika NS2B-NS3pro appears to have the higher request of a basic residue at P3 site than the Dengue complexes (17) . However, as our current focus was not on profiling substrate specificity, in the present study, we did not test on more substrates but measured kinetic constants of linked and unlinked Zika complexes on Bz-nKRR-AMC.\n\nAs shown in Table 1 , linked and unlinked Zika complexes only have slightly different kinetic constants. On the other hand, the linked Zika complex showed much larger differences from those of Dengue complexes (17) . For example, linked Zika complex has a Km of 43.38 \u00b5M, which is ~7 folds of the Dengue 1 (6.2 \u00b5M); ~3.6 folds of the Dengue 2 and Dengue 3 (12 \u00b5M); and ~6 folds of the Dengue 4 (7.3 \u00b5M) on the same substrate. This implies that the Zika complex has the lower affinity to this substrate than all four Dengue ones. However, the linked Zika NS2B-NS3pro has a kcat (48.89 S -1 ) much larger than those of all four Dengue (0.32, 1.4, 0.61 and 2.8 S -1 respectively). Consequently, the catalytic efficiency as reflected by kcat/Km (1,128,681 M -1 S -1 ) is ~3 folds of that of Dengue 4 (380,000 M -1 S -1 ), the largest among the four Dengue complexes (17) . author/funder.

It has a Km of 18.3 \u00b5M and kcat of 44.6 S -1 respectively. While the kcat values are very similar, the Km value is ~2.4-fold less than our current one. This small difference is likely due to: 1) the difference of substrate as Bz-nKKR-AMC was used in the study (25) ; or/and 2) the presence of more unstructured regions in our construct, 3) or/and the difference of the buffers: our buffer is 50 mM Tris pH 8.5 while the buffer in the publication (25) is only 10 mM Tris pH 8.5. It is well-established that high salt concentrations reduced the activity of the flaviviral proteases (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Indeed, we measured the activity of our linked Zika protease in 10 mM Tris pH 8.5, and the catalytic activity is 1.36-time higher.\n\nCharacterization of the enzymatic inhibition-Previously, a small molecule p-Nitrophenyl-pguanidino benzoate (Fig. 3D ) has been identified to specifically bind to the active site of West Nile NS2B-NS3pro by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, followed by NMR binding confirmation (19) . Later, this molecule has been extensively demonstrated to bind Dengue (Table 1 ). Most strikingly, as clearly evidenced from Lineweaver-Burk plots for both linked (Fig. 3E ) and unlinked (Fig. 3G ) Zika complexes, the small molecule acts as a non-competitive inhibitor for both forms. We have searched all literatures citing the original paper (19) , but only found IC50 value of this inhibitor on West Nile NS2B-NS3pro complex (34.2 \u00b5M) in the original paper (19) . Therefore, this inhibitor could inhibit the enzymatic activity of Zika NS2B-NS3pro much more potently than that of author/funder. All rights reserved.

While it remains unclear whether this molecule inhibits other flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes in a competitive or non-competitive manner, our present results clearly reveal that it inhibits Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes in a non-competitive manner, fundamentally different from a just reported peptidomimetic boronic acid inhibitor which competitively inhibited Zika NS2B-NS3pro (25). Our results thus decoded for the first time that Zika NS2B-NS3pro in fact has a pocket, to which small molecules can bind to trigger allosteric inhibition of the enzymatic activity.\n\nlonger Zika NS2B-NS3pro constructs prevented from further determination of its structure by crystallography or NMR. On the other hand, Zika and Dengue viruses have a high sequence identity for the NS2B (35.19%) and NS3pro (56.67%) respectively, which is sufficient to allow to build up a homology model (26, 27) . Therefore, with MODELLER software suite (9v10) (26), we generated a homology model of the Zika NS2B-NS3pro in the \"open\" form by use of a Dengue crystal structure (PDB code: 2FOM) as a template. This Dengue crystal structure\n\nrepresents the \"open\" form, which is adopted by the flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes in the absence of any inhibitors (12, 18, 21, 22) . The obtained Zika model only has 0.13 \u00c5 of rootmean-square-distance (RMSD) of heavy atoms from the Dengue complex.\n\nMolecular dynamics (MD) simulation represents a powerful tool to gain insights into roles of protein dynamics in the enzymatic catalysis (28), and we have previously utilized it to study the Dengue NS2B-NS3pro in the \"open\" form (12) , as well as the dynamically-driven allosteric mechanisms of the SARS 3C-like protease, which also shares the chymotrypsin fold to host the catalytic machinery (29, 30) . Here with the exact same protocols we previously used for the Dengue (12), we conducted MD simulations up to 100 ns for Zika and Dengue NS2B-author/funder. All rights reserved.

As seen in Fig. 4A , Zika NS3pro only has a slightly higher RMSD than Dengue one and interestingly, after 60 ns their average RMSD trajectories become similar. By contrast, Zika NS2B has a constantly larger average RMSD trajectory than Dengue one during the whole 100-ns simulations. This indicates that both Zika NS2B and NS3pro have intrinsic dynamics higher than those of the Dengue, and particularly the Zika NS2B is much more dynamic than the Dengue one.\n\nFurthermore, although the overall patterns of the root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) are similar for NS3pro ( Fig 4C) and NS2B (Fig 4D) of Zika and Dengue complexes, the RMSF values averaged over four simulations of the Zika ones are all larger than those of the Dengue.\n\nIn particular, the Zika NS2B has much larger RMSF over the N-terminal 6 residues C-terminal 22 residues (Fig 4D) . A close inspection of the structure snapshots reveals that although the Dengue NS2B residues Glu80-Glu90 have large conformational fluctuations, the residues Gln93-Thr94-Leu95 constantly have close contacts with the NS3pro residues Leu31-Gly32-Tyr33-Ser34 in the whole 100-ns simulations (Fig 4E) , and consequently have small RMRF over this short fragment (Fig 4D) . By a sharp contrast, the Zika residues Pro93-Met94-Arg95 corresponding to Dengue Gln93-Thr94-Leu95 lose the contact with NS3pro after 10 ns and consequently the Zika NS2B C-region becomes highly exposed (Fig. 4F ). The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/078113 doi: bioRxiv preprint structure snapshots of Zika NS2B (Fig 5B) reveal that only after 30 ns, a short \u03b2-sheet is formed with two \u03b2-strands over residues Val76-Asp79 and Gly82-L86, which is further illustrated by the structure snapshots of Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex (Fig. 5C ). This is a significant finding as in the closed conformation, this \u03b2-sheet further get packed to NS3pro, even with residues Ser80-Gly81-Asp82 directly contacting the inhibitor (25) . Unfortunately, the formation of such packing is expected to occur at least over \u00b5s-ms time scale, which still remains challenging to be simulated by MD.\n\nSo why do Zika and Dengue NS2B have such radical differences in conformations and dynamics? Examination of NS2B sequences reveals that the Zika NS2B region corresponding to the Dengue NS2B Glu91-Thr96 shows no sequence homology at all (Fig. 5D ), thus implying that the sequence variations over this region may mainly account for the loss of the contact between the Zika NS2B and NS3pro corresponding to the Dengue NS2B Gln93-Leu95 and NS3pro Leu31-Ser34, thus leading to the high dynamics of Zika NS2B C-region, which is successfully detected by CD and NMR spectroscopy, as well as pinpointed by MD simulations.\n\nWe also attempted to assess the dynamics of Zika and Dengue NS2B-NS3pro complexes in the closed conformation. To achieve this, we performed MD simulations up to 100 ns on the crystal structures of Zika (5LC0) (25) and Dengue (3U1I) (31) NS2B-NS3pro complexes with the small molecule inhibitors removed. We remove the small molecule inhibitors because: 1) we aimed to find whether the removal of the small molecules would trigger a difference in dynamic instability for Zika and Dengue complexes. 2) Currently the force-field parameters for simulating small molecules are still not universally established. Fig 6A and 6B show the root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) trajectories averaged over four independent MD simulations respectively for NS3pro and NS2B of both Zika and Dengue complexes in the closed form. Interestingly, for the closed conformation without inhibitors, Dengue complex is more dynamic than the Zika one. While the Dengue NS3pro has author/funder. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, although the overall patterns of the root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) are similar for NS3pro ( Fig 6C) and NS2B (Fig 6D) of Zika and Dengue complexes, the RMSF values averaged over four simulations of the Dengue ones are all larger than those of the Zika. In particular, the Dengue NS2B has relatively larger RMSF than Zika one over the C-terminal 7 residues (Fig 6D) . It is very interesting to observe here that although the majority of contacts of the small molecule inhibitors are with NS3pro, their removal triggers much more significant changes of dynamics of NS2B than those of NS3pro for both Zika and Dengue complexes. Again, as the current simulations only reached 100 ns, the short \u03b2-sheet still persists and remains packed with NS3pro for both Dengue (Fig. 6E) and Zika (Fig. 6F) complexes.\n\nthat the high dynamics of Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex detected by CD and NMR is mostly resulting from the C-terminal region of Zika NS2B, we cloned and expressed a His-tagged Zika NS2B(48-74) with the C-region deleted. Despite its low expression level and insolubility, by growing many liters of E. coli cells, we managed to purify a sufficient amount of NS2B(48-74) for refolding with NS3pro. Interestingly, NS2B(48-74) is capable of forming a soluble complex with NS3pro (Fig. 1E) . However, its NMR peaks are much more broad even than those of linked NS2B-NS3pro ( Fig. 2A) , most likely due to \u00b5s-ms conformational dynamics or/and dynamic aggregation. On the other hand, its intrinsic UV fluorescence spectrum indicates that its four Trp residues are similarly buried as linked and unlinked Zika complexes with the fulllength NS2B (Fig. 2D ). Most interestingly, as judged from its CD spectrum which has the maximal negative signal shifted to 207 nm and has positive signal at 191 nm (Fig. 2E) , this author/funder. All rights reserved.

Previously, we have generated a truncated Dengue NS2B with the C-terminal residues deleted but the short NS2B lost the capacity in forming a soluble complex with its NS3pro.\n\nHowever, we generated another truncated NS2B with only residues 77-84 deleted, which was designated as NS2B(48-100; \u039477-84). Interestingly, NS2B(48-100; \u039477-84) was able to form a soluble complex with its NS3pro, which appeared to be highly disordered as reflected by its CD spectrum, as well as highly dynamic as judged by its NMR spectrum (12) .\n\nTogether, these results clearly indicate that unlike Dengue one, Zika NS2B indeed has a dynamic and disordered C-terminal region even in the enzymatically active complexes with its NS3pro domain. Nevertheless, our results suggest that this C-terminal region is absolutely required for implementing the catalytic actions, implying that the closed conformation might be indeed the enzymatically-active conformation, as previously speculated (20) (21) (22) (23) 31) , because the deletion of the C-terminal region completely abolishes the potential of Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex to form the closed conformation. Additionally, despite being highly disordered, the C-region might have other functional roles such as to maintain functional dynamics to facilitate HCV replication (32, 33) . author/funder.

This is particular relevant to flaviviral NS2B-NS3 proteases which appear to need a transition from the open (inactive) to closed (active) conformations to achieve their catalytic actions (20) (21) (22) (23) 31) . As well demonstrated (18, (21) (22) (23) 25, 31) , the \"open\" (inactive) and \"closed\" (active) forms of the flaviviral NS2B-NS3 proteases have very similar structures of the catalytic domains (NS3pro) but differ mostly in the structures and dynamics of NS2B: the \"open\" is characteristic of the highly unstructured and dynamic C-half of NS2B, while the \"closed\" has the C-half adopting a well-folded \u03b2-hairpin which become tightly contacted with the NS3pro chymotrypsin fold (Fig. 6G) . As a consequence, better understanding of their conformational dynamics may provide key clues to design inhibitors by blocking the conversion from the open to closed conformations.\n\nHere, we have successfully obtained both linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes, which, despite sharing similarity, do have some unique catalytic features including the lower substrate affinity but higher efficiency than those of the complexes of all four Dengue serotypes. Most strikingly, as reported by CD and NMR HSQC spectroscopy, Zika NS2B appears to be much more dynamic and disordered than Dengue NS2B of the same length as we previously studied (12) . Indeed, in preparation of our current manuscript, a crystal structure was published on Zika NS2B-NS3pro which was linked with (Gly)4-Ser-(Gly)4 but had almost all flexible regions of both NS2B and NS3pro deleted (25) . Interestingly, it was reported that unlike Dengue complexes whose high-quality crystals could be obtained for the \"open\" form, this small Zika complex could only be crystallized in complex with a tight competitive inhibitor, and consequently the structure represents a \"closed\" form ( Fig. 6) , in which the characteristic author/funder.

This is completely consistent with NMR HSQC spectrum of 15 N-labeled Zika NS2B in complex with unlabeled NS3pro (Fig. 2C) , indicating that at least half of the Zika NS2B residues are highly dynamic. This unusually high dynamics appear to result mainly from the large sequence difference over the NS2B C-terminal residues 91-96 between Zika and Dengue (Fig. 5D) . Indeed, a short Zika NS2B with residues 75-100 deleted is sufficient to form a complex with its NS3pro, which has the less disordered structure but is enzymatically inactive, thus not only confirming that the Zika NS2B C-terminal residues is highly disordered, but also supporting the previous proposal that the formation of the closed conformation is essential for the enzymatic catalysis.\n\nAmazingly, a short \u03b2-sheet characteristic of the closed conformation is formed only at 30 ns of simulations of Zika NS2B-NS3pro in the open conformation (Fig. 5) . Furthermore, the contact between Dengue NS2B Gln93-Leu95 and its NS3pro only existing in the \"open\" form is completely incompatible with the structure of the NS2B C-half in the \"closed\" conformation ( Fig. 6E ). As such, the loss of this contact in Zika NS2B-NS3pro in the open conformation implies that the energy barrier separating the \"open\" and \"closed\" forms of the Zika complex might be lower than that of the Dengue complex (Fig. 6G) .

Most importantly, this molecule acts as an allosteric inhibitor for both Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes, fundamentally different from a recently reported peptidomimetic boronic acid inhibitor which is a competitive inhibitor (25) . This suggests that Zika NS2B-NS3pro is susceptible to allosteric inhibition. Furthermore, as this allosteric inhibitor also has a structure scaffold very different from the peptidomimetic boronic acid inhibitor, our discovery might open up a new avenue for the future development of allosteric inhibitors, which is highly demanded to achieve therapeutic inhibition of flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes (35) .\n\nCurrently we are focused on optimizing various conditions which would allow atomic resolution studies on the structures, dynamics and inhibitor design for Zika NS2B-NS3pro by NMR spectroscopy (12, 19, 20, 23, (36) (37) (38) .\n\nauthor/funder.

With designed primers, the genes by GenScript were used as templates for amplifying DNA fragments encoding the isolated NS3 (14-185) and NS2B (48-100) with the transmembrane regions removed, as well as NS2B (48-74) with the C-region further deleted. Furthermore, DNA fragments were designed for linking NS2B (48-100) to NS3 (14-185) by (Gly)4-Ser-(Gly)4 using overlap PCR as previously described (14) . Amplified DNA fragments were subsequently cloned into His-tagged pET28a vector (Novagen). DNA sequences of all constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing.

Protein concentration was determined by the UV spectroscopic method with 8 M urea (12) .\n\nFluorescence, CD and NMR experiments-Intrinsic UV fluorescence spectra were measured with a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer as we previously described (24) with the excitation wavelength at 280 nm. Circular dichroism (CD) experiments were performed on a Jasco J-1500 spectropolarimeter and data from five independent scans were added and averaged (12, 24) . All NMR experiments were acquired on an 800 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer equipped with pulse field gradient units as described previously (12, 24, 36) . For steady state kinetics, we used the exactly the same buffer as a previous one on profiling substrate specificity for the NS2B-NS3pro complexes of all four Dengue serotypes (17) : 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.5, except that no glycerol was added as it would lead to significant NMR signal broadening due to high viscosity.

Water molecules using the TIP3P model are used to solvate the MD system. 8 Na + ions were added into the Zika NS2B-NS3pro to make the charge of the respective MD system neutral. The solvated Zika homology NS2B-NS3pro complex was first energy minimized with 1000 steps of steepest descent using GROMACS version 4.5.7 (40) using AMBER all-atom force field (41) . The time step was set as 2 fs. Prior to MD production simulation, two stages of equilibration were done independently for each MD simulation set. First equilibration phase was done in NVT ensemble for 100 ps with the following settings: long-range electrostatic interactions calculated with fast particle-mesh Ewald summation method; a cutoff of 9 \u00c5 for electrostatic interactions and a cutoff of 14 \u00c5 for van der Waals interactions; the temperature was kept constant at 300 K with Berendsen's coupling. Second equilibration phase was done in NPT ensemble for 100 ps with the same settings as the first equilibration phase and some additional settings: pressure coupling was held at 1 bar with Parrinello-Rahma coupling; isothermal compressibility was set at 4.5*10 bar. Heavy atoms of proteins were positioncontrained using LINCS algorithm (42) . The MD production simulation was done with the same settings with NPT equilibration without the position-contraints on heavy atoms of protein and temperature coupling was done with Nose-Hoover. author/funder.
