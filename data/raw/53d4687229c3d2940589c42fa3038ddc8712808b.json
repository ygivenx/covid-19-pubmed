We used setting-specific demographics, measured contact matrices where possible, and synthetic contact matrices otherwise 27 . The age-dependent clinical proportion was markedly lower in younger age groups in all regions (Fig 2b) , with 20% of infections in children under 10 resulting in clinical cases, rising to over 70% in adults over 70 in the consensus age distribution estimated across all regions. To determine whether this distribution was capable of reproducing epidemic dynamics, we fitted our dynamic model to the incidence of clinical cases in Beijing, Shanghai, South Korea and Italy ( Fig 2c ) . The consensus age-specific clinical fraction was largely capable of reproducing the age distribution of cases, although there are some outliers, for example the 20-30 age group in South Korea. This could be the result of clustered transmission within a church group in this country 4 . The predicted age distribution of cases for Italy is also less skewed towards older adults than reported cases show, suggesting potential differences in age-specific testing in Italy 28 .

There were many more clinical cases for COVID-19 than influenza in all cities, with relatively more cases in children in the influenza-like scenario, and more cases in adults in simulated COVID-19 epidemics ( Fig 3c) . More clinical cases were seen in older adults in Milan compared with the other cities, and a markedly younger age distribution in clinical cases in Bulawayo. Using the same age-dependent clinical fraction drawn from high and upper-middle income countries in low and lower-middle income countries (LMIC) may underestimate clinical cases due to the presence of comorbidities.\n\nTo fully explore the effect of school closure we simulated 3 months of school closures with varying infectiousness of subclinical cases, at either 0, 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 times the infectiousness of clinical cases ( Fig 3d) . We found that school closures decreased peak incidence slightly for influenza-like infections, and delayed the peak substantially. For COVID-19 epidemics, the delay and decrease of the peak was smaller, and this was especially the case in Bulawayo, which has the highest proportion of children (Fig 3e) .\n\nBecause children exhibit more subclinical cases for COVID-19, school closures were more effective at reducing transmission of COVID-19 when the subclinical infectiousness was assumed to be higher (Fig 3f) .\n\n.

Simulating COVID-19 outbreaks in 146 capital cities, we found that the total expected number of clinical cases in an unmitigated epidemic varied between countries depending on the median age of the population, which is a proxy for the age structure of the population. The total clinical attack rate was higher, and the peak height of the epidemic was greater, in older populations ( Fig 4a ) . By contrast, the number and peak of subclinical infections was lower in older populations ( Fig 4b ) . The mean estimated basic reproduction number, R 0 , was higher in cities with a lower median age ( Fig   4c ) , because of the greater proportion of children and the higher number of contacts made by children compared to adults. We applied the same age-dependent clinical fraction to all 10 .

If the relationship between clinical fraction and age skews younger in low and lower-middle income countries, there would be higher clinical attack rates in these countries (Supplementary Section 4).\n\nThe expected age distribution of cases shifted substantially over time, where in the early phase of the epidemic, the clinical case distribution tended to be skewed to younger ages, and the late phase showed more cases in older individuals ( Fig 4d ) . This impacts projections for likely healthcare burdens at different phases of the epidemic, particularly because older individuals tend to have higher healthcare utilisation on infection 1 ( Fig 4e ) . \n\n.

Given evidence of a stark age gradient in severity 8 and mortality 21, 28 , and recent studies of close follow up of children at risk of infection 16 showing that infection was frequent in all age groups, the plausibility of age-specific severity is higher than age-specific susceptibility to infection. For a number of other pathogens, there is evidence that children (except for the very youngest) have lower rates of symptomatic disease 12 and mortality 26 . For these reasons, we find that age-specific clinical fraction is more supported than age-specific susceptibility to infection.\n\nSerological surveys will provide critical information on the true distribution of subclinical infections.\n\nThe age-specific distribution of subclinical infection we have found is similar in shape (but larger in scale) to that generally assumed for pandemic influenza. However, for the 2009 influenza A/H1N1p pandemic, the age-specific susceptibility to infection was lower in older individuals compared to COVID-19. These differences have a large effect on how effective school closures may be in limiting transmission, delaying the peak of expected cases, and decreasing the total and peak number of cases. For COVID-19, school closures are likely to be much less effective than for influenza-like infections where children play a more substantial role in transmission.\n\nIt is critical to determine how infectious subclinical infections are compared to clinical infections in order to properly assess predicted burdens both with and without interventions.\n\nIt is biologically plausible that milder cases are less transmissible, for example, because of an absence of cough 28, 29 , but direct evidence is limited 35 . If those with subclinical infection are similarly efficient transmitters of infection compared to those with clinical infections, the 12 .

If those with subclinical infections are (much) less efficient at transmitting, then the overall contribution to the burden of clinical disease in the population may be proportionally lower. At the same time, lower relative infectiousness would reduce the impact of interventions targeting younger ages, such as school closure. By analysing epidemic dynamics before and after school closures, it may be possible to estimate the infectiousness of subclinical infections, however this will rely on granular data by age and time.\n\nA great deal of concern has been directed toward the expected burden of COVID-19 in low and middle income countries (LMIC), which have lower population median age than many high income countries. Our results show that these demographic differences, coupled with a lower symptomatic fraction in younger ages, can result in proportionally fewer clinical cases than would be expected in higher-income countries with flatter demographic pyramids. This should not be interpreted as few cases in LMIC, because the projected epidemics are still very large, resulting in high numbers infected. Moreover, the particular relationship found with age here is drawn from high income countries, primarily in East Asia, and may reflect not only age, but also the increasing frequency of comorbidities with age. This relationship, therefore, may differ in LMIC for two key reasons: first, the distribution of non-communicable comorbid conditions-which are already known to increase the risk of severe disease from COVID-19 21 may be differently distributed by age, often occurring in younger age groups 34 , along with other possible risk factors such as undernutrition 36 ; and second, communicable comorbidities such as HIV 33 , TB coinfection (which has been suggested to increase risk 37 ), and others 38 may alter the distribution of severe outcomes by age. Observed severity and burden in LMIC may also be higher due to a lack of health system capacity for intensive treatment of severe cases.\n\n.

The true explanation for the age distribution could be a combination of age-specific susceptibility and clinical fraction, although some recent studies indicate children are infected at similar 24 , or slightly lower rates 39 than adults, and children are not commonly spared from other coronavirus infections 40, 41 . It is not possible to simultaneously estimate both effects from available data, so we were unable to validate a mixture model. While information drawn from the early stages of the epidemic are subject to uncertainty, age-specific information is drawn from several regions and countries, and clinical studies support the hypothesis presented here. We assumed that clinical cases are reported at a fixed fraction throughout the time period, although there may have been changes in reporting. We assumed that subclinical infections were less infectious than clinical infections but were not able to estimate how infectious subclinical infections were, instead testing the sensitivity of our findings to this parameter. We have used mixing matrices from the same country, but not the same location as the fitted data. We used contact matrices that combined physical and conversational contacts. We therefore implicitly assume that they are a good reflection of contact relevant for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. If fomite, or faecal-oral routes of transmission are important in transmission, these contact matrices may not be representative of transmission risk.\n\nThe role of age in transmission is critical to designing interventions aiming to decrease transmission in the population as a whole, and to projecting the expected global burden.\n\nEarly evidence 24 , including presented here, suggests that there is age dependence in the risk of clinical symptoms following infection. Understanding if and by how much subclinical infections contribute to transmission has implications for predicted global burden and the impact of control interventions. This question must be resolved to effectively forecast and control COVID-19 epidemics.\n\n14 .

We adjusted the size parameter of the negative binomial distribution used to model case incidence to 10 to reflect greater variability among fewer data points for these countries than for Wuhan. Beijing and Shanghai were fitted jointly, with separate dates of introduction but the same fitted susceptibility, large-scale restriction date and large-scale restriction magnitude. South Korea and Italy were each fitted separately; we fitted a large-scale restriction date and magnitude for both South Korea and Italy.\n\nFor both the linelist fitting and validation, we assumed that schools were closed in China, but remained open in South Korea, Japan, Italy, Singapore, and Canada, as schools were open for the majority of the period covered by the data in the latter five countries.\n\nTo determine the impact in other cities with different demographic profiles we used the inferred parameters from our linelist analysis to parameterise our transmission model for projections to other cities. We chose these to compare projections for a city with a high proportion of elderly individuals (Milan, Italy); a moderate-aged population (Birmingham, United Kingdom); and a city in a low-income country with a high proportion of young individuals (Bulawayo, Zimbabwe). For this analysis, we compared an outbreak of COVID-19, for which the burden and transmission is concentrated in relatively-older individuals, with an outbreak of pandemic influenza, for which the burden and transmission is concentrated in relatively-younger individuals. We assumed that immunity to influenza builds up over a person's lifetime, such that an individual's susceptibility to influenza infection plateaus at roughly age 35, and assumed that the severity of influenza infection is highest in the elderly and in children under 10 years old 7 .\n\n.

We assumed that the epidemic was seeded by two infectious individuals in a random age group per week for 5 weeks to. We scaled the age-specific susceptibility u i by setting the \"target\" basic reproductive number R 0 = 2.4 as an illustrative example. We also performed a sensitivity analysis where we scaled u i to result in R 0 = 2 in Birmingham, and using the same setting for u i in all three cities, so that the actual R 0 changed depending upon contact matrices and demographics used to model each city.\n\nWe projected the impact of school closure by setting the contact multiplier for school contacts school(t) to 0. Complete removal of school contacts may overestimate the impact of school closures because of alternative contacts children make when out of school 57 . This will however give the maximum impact of school closures in the model to demonstrate the differences.\n\nTo project the impact of COVID-19 outbreaks in global cities, we used mixing matrices from Prem et al. 27 and demographic structures for 2020 from World Population Prospects 2019 to simulate a COVID-19 outbreak in 146 global capital cities for which synthetic matrices, demographic structures and total populations were available. For simplicity, we assumed that capital cities followed the demographic structure of their respective countries and took 24 .

For each city, we scaled u i to result in an average R 0 = 2 in Birmingham, UK, and used the same setting for u i for all cities, so that the realised R 0 would change according to the contact matrices and demographics for each city. We simulated 20 outbreaks in each city, drawing the age-specific clinical fraction y i from the posterior of the estimated overall clinical fraction from our line list analysis (Fig. 2) , and analysed the time to the peak incidence of the epidemic, the peak clinical and subclinical incidence of infection, and the total number of clinical and subclinical infections. We took the first third and the last third of clinical cases in each city to compare the early and late stages of the epidemic.\n\n.
