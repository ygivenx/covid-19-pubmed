{"title": "Efficient diastereoselective synthesis of a new class of azanucleosides: 2 0 -homoazanucleosides", "body": "Azanucleosides, a class of sugar-modified nucleoside analogues in which the 4'-oxygen of the ribose is replaced by a nitrogen atom, have recently attracted considerable attention. 1, 2 The Immucillins, a series of aza-sugar-C-nucleosides, show potential for the treatment of leukemia, auto-immune disorders, bacterial infections, etc. 3 The pyrrolidine nitrogen atom allows these nucleosides to function as transition state analogue inhibitors of several nucleosideprocessing enzymes such as human purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), 4 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase (MTAN) & 5'methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP). 5 Due to the diverse essential functions of these enzymes among several organisms and species, inhibitors may exhibit various biological activities. The most notable are inhibition of quorum sensing (through MTAN) and anticancer activity (through MTAP and PNP). 4, 6, 7 Other noteworthy effects include antiparasitic and antibacterial activity. 8e10 Immucillin A (1), also shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity (Fig. 1) . It is an RNA polymerase inhibitor and functions as a non-obligate chain terminator. It is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of Ebola virus infection under the name galidesivir \u00ae . 11e13\n\nThe synthesis of azanucleosides is not trivial. The core iminosugar often requires a long multi-step synthesis, and attachment of the nucleobase poses a second challenge, due to the unstable hemiaminal linkage that would hydrolyze spontaneously upon contact with water. Several strategies have been investigated to overcome this liability. Apart from synthesizing C-nucleosides, where most of the research has been focusing on, enhanced stability can also be obtained by substituting the nitrogen. Chiacchio et al., for example, reported an N-Boc-protected 3'-deoxyazaribonucleoside that displays highly potent anti-HCV activity in a replicon assay. 14 A third strategy is the synthesis of N-homoazanucleosides, in which a methylene linker is inserted between the carbohydrate mimic and the base. Although this formal insertion of a CH 2 unit in the glycosidic bond lengthens the separation between the base and the pyrrolidine ring relative to that in the natural substrate, this bond is likewise elongated in transition states. 1'-homoaza-adenosine 3 is an inhibitor of protozoan nucleoside hydrolases, although less potent than the corresponding C-nucleoside. 15, 16 Furthermore, several second-generation Immucillins, for example the femtomolar MTAP/MTAN inhibitor 2, also possess an extra methylene linker between the pyrrolidine and the surrogate nucleobase. 17e19 In addition, homonucleosides are resistant towards nucleases, may still be phosphorylated by cellular enzymes and are able to pair with natural nucleosides through Watson-Crick interactions. 20 1 0 -Homonucleosides were recently reviewed by Wr oblewski et al. 21 In this work we report the synthesis of a series of 2'-homoazanucleosides, regioisomers of the 1'-homoazanucleosides (e.g. 3) , in which the nucleobase is attached to the 2'-position of the pyrrolidine ring via a methylene linker. This transposition of the nucleobase affords analogues with the same number of bonds between the nucleobase and carbons 2 0 , 3 0 and 4 0 of the pyrrolidine ring as in the natural nucleosides and therefore might more closely mimic the spatial arrangements of natural nucleosides. A series of 2'-homo-azanucleosides was synthesized containing the natural and some closely related nucleobases, as well as two 5'-thio analogues, inspired by the potent methylthioadenosine-mimicking aza-C-nucleosides (e.g. 2).\n\nWe envisioned a convergent synthetic approach wherein the protected polyhydroxylated pyrrolidine scaffold is synthesized first, subsequently coupled with a variety of nucleobases. The desired 2 0 -C-hydroxymethyl iminosugar has, contrary to several of its stereoisomers, 22 not been reported yet. Its retrosynthesis comprises ring-closing metathesis and subsequent dihyroxylation as key steps (Fig. 2) , based on the observation that this strategy has already been successfully applied in the synthesis of a number of analogous iminosugars. 23 Several syntheses for the vinylglycinol precursor of 10 have been reported, 24,25 but we opted for the method of Van den Nieuwendijk et al. using an Ellman tert-butylsulfinamide because of its 100% enantiopurity. 26, 27 Rac-Solketal 12 was first protected as benzyl ether, after which the isopropylidene acetal was hydrolyzed (Scheme 1). Oxidative cleavage of the resulting diol and condensation with (S)-tert-butanesulfinamide led to sulfinimine 14.\n\nAddition of vinylmagnesium bromide resulted in a mixture of diastereoisomers in a 9:1 ratio in favor of the desired diastereoisomer 15, as determined by 1H NMR. We found that the addition of hazardous AlMe 3 , as described by Van den Nieuwendijk et al., could be omitted without a significant drop in diastereoselectivity. The two diastereoisomers could be separated by column chromatography, affording enantiopure 15. Removal of the sulfinamine chiral auxiliary with HCl in MeOH and subsequent Boc-protection of the resulting amine furnished 10 in 45% yield over 6 steps.\n\nThe second building block was synthesized from commercially available 2-methylene-1,3-propanediol 17 (Scheme 2). Selective monoprotection as TBS-ether and subsequent iodination yielded 11, which required purification prior to use in the alkylation reaction with 10 in order to get reproducible results.\n\nCarbamate 10 was alkylated with 1.1 eq. of iodide 11 using sodium hydride as base (Scheme 3). Product 19 was then cyclized by ring closing metathesis, which proceeded smoothly with only 1.5 mol% Grubbs II catalyst. Ring-closed product 20 was then dihydroxylated with OsO 4 to yield diastereomerically pure 21. The stereocenter already present apparently provides enough stereoinduction to have dihydroxylation selectively on the opposite face, rendering the reaction stereospecific. The stereochemistry was proven by X-ray analysis of compound 21 (see Supporting Information), which shows the product to be the expected diastereoisomer (Fig. 3 ). Isopropylidene protection of 21 was first tried with 2,2-dimethoxypropane and catalytic TsOH, but resulted in significant amounts of TBS-deprotected compound. This could be circumvented by using 2-methoxypropene and 2 mol% camphersulphonic acid (CSA), affording 22 in almost quantitative yield. Final TBS-deprotection with TBAF provided the orthogonally protected central scaffold 23 in 43% yield over 5 steps from 10.\n\nIntroduction of the desired nucleobase in 23 was accomplished by a Mitsunobu reaction. Two possible issues (i.e. the solubility of the nucleobases in organic solvents and the alkylation site selectivity) were avoided by prior protection of the nucleobases. 28 We chose protecting groups that are cleavable under the same conditions as the protecting groups on the pyrrolidine scaffold. Adenine was protected as its N-6-Boc 2 derivative, and almost exclusively yielded the desired coupling product 24 (Scheme 4). 29 N-3-BOM-protected uracil and thymine readily afforded 30 and 31. 30 We first tried to deprotect the resulting nucleosides in 2 steps using hydrogenolysis with Pd/C and subsequent acidic hydrolysis. However, hydrogenolysis proved to be difficult and afforded only small amounts of debenzylated product, presumably due to the Scheme 1. Synthesis of (S)-O-benzyl-N-Boc-vinylglycinol 10. Reagents and conditions: a) (i) BnBr, NaH, THF/DMF, 0 C to rt, 3 h; (ii) AcOH/H 2 O, rt, 24 h, 97% (2 steps); b) (i) NaIO 4 , CH 2 Cl 2 /H 2 O, 0 C, 6 h; (ii) (S)-tert-butylsulfinamide, CuSO 4 , CH 2 Cl 2 , rt, overnight, 77% (2 steps); c) vinylMgBr, toluene, \u00c078 C, 3 h, 71%; d) (i) HCl, MeOH, rt, 1.5 h; (ii) aq. NaOH, rt, 94% (2 steps); e) Boc 2 O, Et 3 N, CH 2 Cl 2 , rt, 4 h, 90%. coordinating effects of the different nitrogen atoms of the nucleobase to the palladium. 31 Fortunately, deprotection with the Lewis acid BCl 3 , provided the completely deprotected nucleosides in one step. 32 Purification by column chromatography and acidification yielded the desired nucleoside analogues as their HCl salts.\n\nThe guanine and hypoxanthine analogues 28 and 29 were synthesized from the corresponding 6-chloropurines. The chloride was substituted for a hydroxy function during the BCl 3 -mediated deprotection, by dropwise quenching with MeOH at low temperature. Substitution can be avoided by adding Et 3 N prior to quenching with MeOH. 33 Mitsunobu reaction of 23 with 7-deaza-6-chloropurine to synthesize 34 was not possible due to the less acidic pyrrole NH. Hence, 23 was first mesylated and then substituted in a classical S N 2 fashion, to afford 34. The chloride was then substituted with NaN 3 . Reduction of the azide and simultaneous removal of the 5 0 -Obenzyl with Pd(OH) 2 and H 2, followed by acidic hydrolysis of the remaining protecting groups afforded 7-deazadenine analogue 35. 5-Fluorouracil was introduced as its N-3-benzoyl protected derivative. 34 Deprotection of 36 was realized in 2 steps: first basic removal of the benzoyl group, then treatment with BCl 3 . Lastly, substitution of the mesylate of 23 with N-4-acetylcytosine, afforded an acceptable amount of N-1-alkylated 38.\n\nThe regiochemistry of the nucleobase alkylation reactions was verified on the final compounds via NMR data, which were in agreement with those found in literature. 20,35e37 The deprotected compounds were purified by column chromatography and converted to the corresponding mono-or bis-HCl salts. 38 \n\nPd(OH) 2 -catalyzed hydrogenolysis of 24 yielded alcohol 40, which was then converted to the mesylate and subsequently substituted with sodium thiomethoxide or 4-chlorothiophenol to yield 41 and 42, respectively (Scheme 5). Deprotection with BCl 3 and HCl-salt formation yielded 43 and 44.\n\nThe synthesized nucleosides were screened against a panel of viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2, Vaccinia virus, Adenovirus-2, Human Coronavirus) and microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Trypanosoma brucei) in cell cultures, but no activity was found in concentrations up to 64 mM. The effect on signaling molecule (AI-2, AHL/CAI-1) production in Vibrio harveyi was also investigated, but no activity was found in concentrations up to 100 mM.\n\nA convenient synthetic approach was developed to prepare a series of 2'-homoazanucleosides. The unprecedented orthogonally protected iminosugar scaffold was synthesized first, involving a ring closing metathesis and dihyroxylation as key steps. All steps proceeded in high yield, highlighting the practical use of this synthesis. From this scaffold a series of 9 nucleoside analogues with different nucleobases, as well as two 5'-thio modified adenine analogues was synthesized. The nucleoside analogues were evaluated broadly for antiviral, antibacterial, and antiprotozoal activity, but failed to show activity.\n\nAll reactions described were performed under argon atmosphere and at ambient temperature unless stated otherwise. All reagents and solvents were purchased from SigmaeAldrich (Diegem, Belgium), Acros Organics (Geel Belgium), TCI Europe (Zwijndrecht, Belgium) or Carbosynth Ltd (Compton Berkshire, United Kingdom) and used as received.
