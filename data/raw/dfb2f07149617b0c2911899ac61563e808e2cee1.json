The 136 complete genome 1 6 2 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and an outgroup (bat-RaTG13-CoV) were aligned using 1 6 3 MAFFT then the alignment was manually checked using Geneious. For probing the 1 6 4 haplotypes relationships among localities, the Network v.4.6.1 (Fluxus Technology, 1 6 5 Suffolk, UK) was used to construct the minimum-spanning network based on the full 1 6 6 median-joining algorithm [26] . During the alignment, 10 genomes containing 1 6 7 ambiguous sites or \"N\" bases or more degenerated bases were excluded in this study 1 6 8 (Table S1 ). In addition, 4 genome sequences (EPI ISL 409067, EPI ISL 412981, EPI 1 6 9 ISL 407071 and EPI ISL 408489) with one degenerated base were included, which 1 7 0 were divided into two sequences without degenerated base. For ensuring the accuracy 1 7 1 of this analysis, the 5'UTR and 3'UTR contain missing and ambiguous sites of both 1 7 2 regions were excluded in the following alignment analyses. DnaSP v.5.10 [27] was 1 7 3 used to convert the relevant format. Population genetic indices in was estimated in 1 7 4\n\nDnaSP, including nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) and haplotype diversity (Hd). F ST between 1 7 5 haplotypes was calculated in Mega 6.0 based on haplotype frequency differences with 1 7 6 10,000 permutations [28] . Additionally, a sliding window of 500 bp and steps of 50 1 7 7 bp were used to show nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) for the entire alignment this data. Nucleotide diversity for the entire alignment was plotted against midpoint positions of 1 7 9 author/funder. All rights reserved.

To indicate the relative position of the mutations in the genome, we 1 8 0 selected the EPI ISL 402124 sequence as the reference genome. The alignment was then imported into DnaSP for haplotype analyses. Population BEAST using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with a strict 1 9 5 clock. In this study, the substitution rate was set as 0.92\u00d710 -3 (95% CI, 1 9 6 0.33\u00d710 -3 -1.46\u00d710 -3 ) substitution/site/year based on the most recent estimation for 1 9 7 SARS-CoV-2 [25]. The other parameters were set as follows: extended Bayesian 1 9 8 skyline process, 10 million MCMC generations, sampling every 1,000 th iteration, the 1 9 9 initial 25% burn-in. Tracer was used to check the convergence of the MCMC analyses 2 0 0 (effective sample size [ESS] values >200). Convergence of the two independent 2 0 1 MCMC runs was assessed in Tracer, as was convergence of model parameter values 2 0 2 (ESS) to ensure ESS values >200. 2 0 3 author/funder.

Based on this finding, , the study suggested that pangolin may not be 2 4 3 the intermediate host, as had been reiterated by other previous study [33] . As the 2 4 4\n\nHuanan seafood market was closed on 1 January 2020, this created many challenges Therefore, more sampling and analysis of the sample from this area may suggest 2 4 7 clearer results for more concrete conclusions in future studies. The evolutionary network of 80 haplotypes of SARS-CoV-2, with bat-RaTG13-CoV 2 5 0 as the outgroup, is shown in Figure 4 . The network analysis showed typical star 2 5 1 network, with several core haplotype node (H3, H14, H15) and edge haplotype nodes. In the network, fifty-five satellite haplotypes and H14 connected to the H3 haplotype; 2 5 3 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Most of these haplogroups were 2 5 5 separated by one to six mutations, except two haplotypes (H19 and H80, Fig. 4) . The 2 5 6 evolutionary network showed that bat-RaTG13-CoV to be connected through a 2 5 7 hypothesized haplotype (mv6) to the H15 and H31 haplotypes by single mutations 2 5 8 (Fig. 4) . However, the mutations between mv6 and bat-RaTG13-CoV was more than 2 5 9 1,000, which indicated that SARS-CoV-2 still has a relative distant kinship with the 2 6 0 outgroup (bat-RaTG13-CoV). As the most abundant haplotype, H3 included 28 samples, while 55 satellite 2 6 2 haplotypes are directly derived from the H3 haplotype ( Fig. 4 and Table S1 ). Moreover, many haplotypes from other countries should also be derived from the H3 2 6 4 haplotype. The current samplings showed that the H3 haplotype has been found to be 2 6 5 in 28 samples, but 12 of 28 samples were collected from Wuhan in Hubei Province. Fifteen of the 55 satellite haplotypes were also collected from Hubei Province (Fig. 4 ). 2 6 7\n\nOne possible explanation was that a common haplotype from the Huanan seafood 2 6 8 market (Fig. 4) was rapidly circulated at an early stage of human-to-human 2 6 9 transmissions. It is worth noting that in the H14, there are two samples (EPI ISL 2 7 0 406801 and EPI ISL 412979) from Wuhan. Although these two hosts didn't directly 2 7 1 link with the Huanan market, one of the host (EPI ISL 412979) having lived in a 2 7 2 residential area about 2 kilometers from the Huanan seafood market. This also 2 7 3 provides the possibility of them having indirect possible contact with the Huanan 2 7 4 seafood market. Additionally, the networks of 24 th December, 2019 -30 th December, 2019 and 2 7 6 24 th December, 2019 -6 th January, 2020 also suggested that the most frequent 2 7 7 haplotype (H3) occurred.

On the 2 7 9 other hand, in this study, 16 sequences of Huanan seafood market (4 new sequenced 2 8 0 and 12 GISAID data) were collected. Fifteen of out of the sixteen samples were 2 8 1 collected before 1 st Januray, 2020 and one samples was collected on 8 th Januray, 2020. 2 8 2\n\nThese samples were represented ten haplotypes (H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H10, 2 8 3 H11, H16), which indicated the high proportion of haplotype diversity in Huanan 2 8 4 seafood market. Among those haplotypes, the H3 haplotype, the most abundant, was 2 8 5 present in 6 samples from Huanan seafood market, while the other haplotypes were 2 8 6 directly derived from the H3 haplotype. All the samples from the Huanan seafood 2 8 7 market had the H3 haplotype and other 9 derived haplotypes (Fig. 4) "}
