On the contrary, in certain viral 88 infection settings, the self-cannibalistic or, paradoxically, even the pro-survival 89 functions of autophagy may be deleterious. Evidence suggest that some viruses, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/852608 doi: bioRxiv preprint 7 127\n\nLow doses exposure of DON could trigger autophagy in the intestinal tissues of 128 weaning piglets.\n\nTo explore whether autophagy can be induced in piglets exposed to DON, the 130 intestinal autophagy levels of piglets in experiment groups were measured by testing 131 the autophagosome-like vesicles formation using TEM and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio 132 using immunoblotting. As shown in Figure 1E , a larger number of double-or single-133 membrane vesicles (black asterisk) were observed in jejunum of piglets with the basal 134 diet containing 750 and 1500 \u03bcg/kg DON compared with piglets received a basal diet.\n\n135 The LC3-II/LC3-I ratios were also significantly increased in the duodenum, jejunum, 136 ileum and mesenterium of piglets in II and III groups compared with that of piglets in 137 I group (Fig 1I and 1J ). These data indicated that DON could trigger autophagy in 138 PEDV-infected piglets, which might be related to DON-promoted PEDV infection as 139 autophagy can facilitate to PEDV proliferation [22] .\n\nLow concentrations of DON could facilitate PEDV entry in IPEC-J2 cells.\n\nTo eliminate the effects of DON on cytotoxicity, the viability of IPEC-J2 cells treated 142 with different concentrations of DON was analyzed by enzymatic reduction of MTT.\n\n143 As shown in Fig 2A ( 158\n\n159 entry.\n\nTo explore the mechanism that low concentrations exposure of DON could facilitate 161 PEDV entry, we analyzed the protein levels of the tight junction proteins (ZO-1, 162 occludin and claudin-1) in PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells exposed to DON. As 163 determined by immunoblotting, the protein levels of claudin-1 were significantly 164 decreased by 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM DON and that of ZO-1 had changed little, however, that 165 of occludin were significantly increased by 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM DON in PEDV-infected 166 IPEC-J2 cells (Fig 3A) . The cellular expression and distribution of occludin and 167 claudin-1 were measured to further explore the relationship between tight junction 168 proteins and DON-promoted PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells.

The were also significantly blocked (Fig 10C and 10D gastroenteritis virus and porcine rotavirus as determined by fecal and blood diagnostics.\n\nTwenty-seven out of eighty piglets (BW= 5.5 \u00b1 0.5 kg) were selected and randomly 360 divided into three groups, with 3 replicates per group and 3 piglets per replicate.
