{"title": "Bioinformatical study on the proteomics and evolution of SARS-CoV", "body": "The first case of atypical pneumonia, referred to as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified in Guangdong Province in China in November, 2002. Then, it has spread to several countries and regions such as Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, Canada and Taiwan. Cumulative number of reported cases of SARS has been 8221, and the number of deaths has been 735 in the world up to May 28, 2003. Among them there are 5332 reported cases of SARS and 321 deaths in China, and the mortality rate has increased to 15% from the early 4% estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO)!).\n\nWHO stated that under the efforts of 13 laboratories in China, Germany, Canada, etc., a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of the SARS on April 16, 2003 , and this virus was named SARS Coronavirus (SARS-COV) [1] [2] [3] . The first completed genome and gene SPECIAL TOPICS map of SARS-CoV were released by scientists in Canada [3] on April 12. Subsequently, scientists in China, Hong Kong, USA and Singapore released in succession the completed SARS-CoV genomes determined by themselves [4] [5] [6] [7] . There were 27 items of SARS-CoV associated nucleotide sequences deposited in GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.govl) and 14 of them were completed SARS-CoV genomes up to May 30, 2003.\n\nThe classification status of coronavirus is order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, gnenus Coronavirus. It replicates in the cytoplasm of human and animal host cells and causes respiratory and enteric diseases in host. Coronaviruses contain a positive-stranded RNA with approximately 30000 nucleotides, and feature the largest viral RNA genome known to date. The coronaviruses known to date are divided into three groups (groups 1, 2 and 3) according to their serotype, groups 1 and 2 contain mammalian viruses, while group 3 contains only avian viruses. Within each group, coronaviruses are classified into distinct species by host ranges, antigenic relationships and genomic organization. Each species of coronavirus typically infects only one host species and is fastidious in cell culture. The viruses can cause severe disease in many animals, including avian infectious bronchitis, feline infectious peritonitis, porcine gastroenteritis, etc., and often cause significant lose in stock raising [8] . The two known human coronavirus HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 belong to respectively group 1 and group 2, and are responsible for about 30% of influenza and mild upper respiratory tract illness [9] . Upon coronavirus entry into an appropriate host cell, the 5 I most open reading frame ORFlab of virus genome is translated into a large polyprotein that is cleaved by viral-encoded proteases to release several protein products [5] , including a 3C-like proteinase (3CU ro ), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Rep), an ATPase helicase (Hel), etc. Out of them Rep and Hel are responsible for replicating the viral genome and generating nested transcripts that are used in the synthesis of the viral proteins by host cell ribosome. There are four primary structural proteins including the nucleocapsid protein N, spike protein S, membrane protein M, and small envelope protein E. All of them are glycoproteins. The full-length replicated RNA plus strand first assembles with the N protein. This RNA-protein complex then associates with M and N proteins embedded in the membranes of the ER and new virus particles are formed as the nucleocapsid complexes which bud into the ER. The virus then migrates through the Golgi and eventually exits the cell likely by exocyto-SiS [IO] . It is worth pointing out that the S membrane glycoprotein is functionally important for defining host range and tissue tropism because the virus entry into cell requires the interaction between S protein and its special I) Cumulative number of reported cases of SARS is published at http://www.who.int/csr/sars/ ARTICLE cellular receptor [8] .\n\nThe sequence lengths of the 14 completed genomes of SARS-CoV deposited in NCBI GenBank range from 29712 to 29751, and the nucleotide difference between these genomes is about 0.1 %, the GC content is about 41 %. The genomic organization is typical of coronaviruses, with the characteristic gene order of 5 I rep, S, E, M and N genes [5, 6] , of which the SARS-CoV rep gene comprises approximately two-thirds of the genome, it includes two open reading frames, ORFla and ORFlb, which are predicted to encode two polyproteins undergoing co-translational proteolytic processing and generate many protein products. It also predicted that the regions located between Sand E and between M and N encode a number of non-structural proteins that vary widely among different coronaviruses with unknown function [4] [5] [6] .\n\nIn this study, all the SARS-CoV associated proteins were subject to bioinformatical analysis. The physiochemical properties of each protein such as molecular weight, isoelectric point and extinction coefficient were calculated. The transmembrane segments and subcellular localization prediction and conserved protein motifs search against databases were employed to analyze and predict the function of each SARS-CoV protein. Furthermore, the evolution distance between SARS-CoV proteins and their corresponding homology proteins of other coronaviruses were calculated and analyzed.\n\nThe SARS-CoV associated protein sequences were searched in SWISS-PROT database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk /swissprot/) with the keyword \"SARS\". The protein sequences deposited in SWISS-PROT refer to almost all the corresponding nucleotide sequences in GenBank, so the protein sequences obtained from SWISS-PROT is more typical than those from GenBank [ll] . There are 10 SARS-CoV associated protein sequences in SWISS-PROT up to  May 28, 2003, including structural proteins S, E, M and  N, and function unknown proteins Xl, X2, X3 and X4 . Through comparing each of these proteins with the corresponding ORF of the completed SARS-CoV genome AY274119 in GenBank, we found that the proteins encoded by ORF9-11 and ORF14 have not been deposited into SWISS-PROT. All the SARS-CoV associated proteins including the proteins from SWISS-PROT and the putative proteins from ORF are listed in Table 1 . The studies on other coronaviruses have revealed that the ORFlab occupies about two-thirds of virus genome, and it can be divided into two ORFs: ORFla and ORFlb [12] . For SARS-CoY, the polyprotein is synthesized by a -1 ribosomal frameshift at the predicted slippery site (13392 -13398, 5 I -UUUAAAC-3 ') where the ORFla and ORFlb are overlapped. During the translational process of ORFla and ORFlb, the translated polyprotein is autocatalytically precessed to initially yield mature viral proteases PLpPro (papain-like proteinase) and 3CU ro (chymotrypsin-like proteinase), then generated Rep (RNAdependent RNA polymerase), Hel (ATPase-Helicase) and other protein products whose functions have not been well characterized. Through analysis of the cleavage sites of ORFlab, we got 14 putative protein products (Table 2) , and because these proteins may exist in the actual life cycle of SARS-CoY, these 14 proteins but not the polyprotein corresponding to ORFlab are subject to bioinformatical calculation and analysis.\n\nFirst, the amino acid composition, charge distribution, and the possible repetitive sequence motif of each SARS-CoV protein were analyzed by program SAPS [13] (Statistical Analysis of Protein Sequence). Then, the isoelectric point (pI) and extinction coefficient at 280 urn a) Hypothetical protein 5; b)P596xx is Swiss-Prot ID; AY274119 is GenBank ID; c) Extcoef denotes molecular extinction coefficient at 280 nm; d) pI denotes isoelectric point; e) the putative function of proteins in this study (for details see the text); f) protein functions are not available. of each protein were calculated by PI!) and EXTCOEF [14] program, respectively. TMAP[15] and TMHMM 2.0 [16] were employed to predict the transmembrane segments or transmembrane helical regions of the proteins, from which the subcellular localizations of these proteins were predicted. The HMMPFAM [17] and BLIMPS [18] were used to compare each of SARS-CoV protein sequence against the HMM and BLOCKS databases to search for possible matching conserved protein motifs. Finally, the PSIB-LAST program [19] at bioinformatics platform of Workbench [14] was used to search for homology protein sequences of each SARS-CoV protein through comparing against databases at non-redundant protein database (SDSC) (the matrix is BLOSUM80 and the maximum number of rounds is 6). The CLUSTALW program [20] was used to performs multiple sequence alignments of the homology sequences, then the unrooted phylogenetic trees were drawn by DRAWTREE and DRAWGRAM program [21] , and the evolutionary distance matrixes based on the above protein alignments were computed by PROT-DIST program 2 ).\n\nLike the proteins of other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV associated proteins are divided into structural protein and non-structural protein. The former includes proteins S, E, M and N that are responsible for making up of protein envelope of the virus, the latter includes 3CU ro , Rep, Hel, etc. that are responsible for the proteolytic processing of polyproteins (3CU ro ) and replication and translation of viral RNA (Rep and Hel). However, there are many putative proteins derivated from ORFs of SARS-CoV genome, for example, proteins Xl, X2, X3, X4 and X5, and the functions of these proteins are unknown. All the SARS-CoV associated proteins were subject to analysis and calculation by bioinformatics tools. The sequence length, molecular weight, isoelectric point and extinction coefficient of each protein are listed in Tables 1 and 2.\n\n( i) Analysis of the protein products encoded by ORFlab. The polyprotein encoded by ORFlab generates about 14 protein products ( Table 2 ) through cotranslational proteolytic processing. Among them the leader protein is an acidic protein with molecular weight of 19.6 kD. The positive-charged amino acids (K+R) content is 10.1%, and the negative-charged amino acids (E+D) content 14.5%. Both TMAP and TMHMM predict that there is no transmembrane region in this protein. BLIMPS analysis of the leader protein reveals that the segment 25-49 matches to the conserved sequence motif IPB001407D that is from Influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit PB 1 in BLOCKS database. PSIB-LAST search reveals that partial segments of this protein possess about 30% identities with partial segments of intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 receptor, cubilin, Cation transporter/ATPase and Aminopeptidase N, respectively. P65 is a weakly acidic protein with molecular weight of 70.7 kD. TMAP predicts the existence of two potential transmembrane regions spanning residues 400-424 and 467-486, but TMHMM predicts no transmembrane helical segment. BLIMPS search reveals that the segment 508-545 1) Program by Dr. Luca Toldo, developed at http://www.embl-heidelberg.de 2) Felsenstein, 1. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package) version 3.5c, 1993, Distributed by the author. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle. ARTICLE matches to conserved protein motif IPB001156 (Transferrin) in BLOCKS database. HMMPFAM search reveals that segments 142-185 and 291-351 match to PF05256 (Uncharacterised protein family) and PF00087 (Snake toxin) in HMM database, respectively. PSIBLAST analysis of this protein exhibits that some partial segments of P65 share about 30% sequence identities with proteins Drosophila melanogaster, extracellular matrix protein B, mitochondrial ribosomal protein, Hypothetical 12.7 kD protein in 16S-23SDNA spacer and Listeria innocua. PLpPro is a strongly acidic protein with molecular weight of 269.7 kD and comprises abundant Cys (3%), the sequence region 111-183 (DEEEEDDAECEEEEIDET-CEHEYGTEDDYQGLPLEFGASAETVRVEEEEEEDW-LDDTTEQSEIEPEPEPTPEE) is a high scoring negative charge segments. TMAP and TMHMM analyses both indicate the presence of seven transmembrane helical segments, while the large N-terminus 1-1390 region is oriented on the surface of the virus particle or inside the lumen of the ER/Golgi, and C-terminus 112 residues are oriented inside the virus particle or cytoplasm. HMMPFAM analysis of PLpPro reveals that segments 44 -182, 218-326, 790-1065, 1216-1416 and 2152-2312 regions match separately to conserved protein motifs of PF05066 (RNA--pol_delta), PFOI661(Alpp), PFOl831 (Peptidase_Cl6), PF03649 (UPFOOI4), PFOI891(CbiM) in HMM database. BLIMPS search results show that some partial segments of PLpPro match to conserved protein sequences IPB002589 (Domain of unknown function DUF27), IPBOOl509 (NAD dependent epimerase/dehydratase family), IPB001394 (Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase family 2), IPB000135 (High mobility group proteins HMGl and HMG2), PR00375 (Huntingtin signature) in BLOCKS database, respectively. PSIBLAST search indicates that the sequence identities between SARS-CoV PLpPro and the corresponding proteins of Murine hepatitis virus (MHV), Bovine coronavirus (BoCoV), Avian infectious bronchitis virus (AlBV), Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) range from 30% to 40%. These analytical results of PLpPro indicate that it most likely functions as hydrolase. 3CU ro is an acidic protein with molecular weight of 33.8 kD. It contains two repetitive segments that repeat two times: TTTLN located at positions 24-28, 224-228, and AGTD located at 173-176 and 194-197. TMHHMM fails to predict any existence of transmembrane helical region, and BLIMPS and HMMPFAM search yield no matching conserved protein motifs. PSIBLAST analysis of 3CU ro shows that the sequence identities between 3CU ro of SARS-CoV and the corresponding proteins of MHY, BoCoY, AIBY, HCoV-229E and AIBV range from 40% to 50%, and 3CU ro also shares 43.8% sequence identity with the segment 2879-3180 of Hydrolase, in-1280 dicating that 3CU ro can cany out the function of hydrolysis of protein. Rep is an acidic protein with molecular weight of 106.5 kD. TMAP and TMHMM predict no transmembrane region. HMMPFAM analysis of Rep yields a matching conserved sequence family PF00680 in HMM database, and PF00680 is derived from RNA dependent RNA polymerase. PSIBLAST search results show that the sequence of Rep share about 60% identities with the sequences of corresponding Reps of other coronaviruses. Hel is a basic protein with molecular weight 66.9 kD. TMAP and TMHMM predict no existence of transmembrane segment. HMMPFAM search yields a match to PFOl443 (Viral_helicasel Viral (Superfamily 1) RNA helicase). PSIBLAST search results indicate that the sequence identities between SARS-CoV Hel and the corresponding helicases of other coronaviruses are about 60%. The best-conserved motif is a glycine-rich region located at 282-288, which typically forms a flexible loop between a~-strand and an a-helix. This loop interacts with one of the phosphate groups of the nucleotide. This sequence motif is generally referred to as the \"P_loop,, [22] . The analyses above reveal the strongly conserved property of 3CU ro , Rep and Hei. HD2INSP3 is a basic protein with molecular weight of 33.0 kD. TMHMM analysis predicts the presence of seven-transmembrane a-helices, with the N-terminus residues 1-11 oriented inside virus particle, and the C-terminus residues 236-290 located outside the virus particle, in which the segment 209-219 (CIMLVYCFLGYCCCCYFGLFC) is a sequence containing abundant Cys. PSIBLAST analysis reveals that HD2INSP3 of SARS-CoV shares about 30% sequence identities with the corresponding proteins of other coronaviruses. HMMPFAM search reveals that the segment 43 -140 of HD2INSP3 matches to the conserved protein motif PF00420 (NADH-ubiquinone/plastoquinone oxidore) in HMM database. BLIMPS search reveals that some partial segments of HD2INSP3 match to the conserved sequence motifs IPB001169 (lntegrin beta, C-terminus), IPB002561 (Filovirus glycoprotein), IPB000832 (G-protein coupled receptors family) and IPB002091 (Aromatic amino acids permease) in BLOCKS database. The results above imply that HD2INSP3 might be a member of G-protein coupled receptors family that is inserted into the envelope of the virus and functions as signal transduction. NSP4 is an acidic protein with molecular weight of 9.3 kD, and it contains two segments that repeat two times: VLLS at positions 12-15 and 58-61, LLSVL at positions 13-17 and 55-59. NSP4 shares about 40% sequence identities with the corresponding proteins of other coronaviruses. TMHMM prediction yields no transmembrane helical region. BLIMPS and HMMPFAM searches fail to identify any matching conserved sequence motifs. NSP5 is a neutral protein with molecular weight of 21.9 kD, and no transmembrane segment is predicted. HMMPFAM search indicates the segment 16-117 of NSP5 matches to PF04233 (Phage Mu protein F like protein) and segment 29-140 matches to PF04696 (pininlSDK/memA/ protein conserved region) in HMM database. BLIMPS search reveals some partial segments of NSP5 match to conserved sequence motifs IPB003660 (RAMP domain), PR00331 (Haemagglutinin HA2 chain signature) and PR00329 (Raemagglutinin HAl/HA2 chain signature) in BLOCKS database. Sequence alignments of SARS-CoV NSP5 and the corresponding proteins of other coronaviruses reveal 40% sequence identities between them. NSP6 is a strongly basic protein with molecular weight of 12.4 kD. TMAP and TMHMM predict no transmembrane segment. BLIMPS and HMMPFAM searches fail to identify matching conserved sequence motif. PSIBLAST analysis indicates that the sequence identities between NSP6 of SARS-CoV and the corresponding proteins of other coronaviruses are about 45%. GFLP (Growth factor like protein) is an acidic protein with molecular weight of 14.8 kD, and no transmembrane region is predicted. BLIMPS search reveals that segment 73-86 of GFLP matches to IPB000315 (B-box zinc finger superfamily) and the segment 36-74 matches to IPB003854 (Gibberellin regulated protein) in BLOCKS database. The sequence identities of GFLPs between various coronaviruses are about 55%. No transmembrane regions are predicted in NSP11, NSP12 and NSP13. BLIMPS search reveals that the segments 101-117 and 247-257 of NSP11 match to conserved sequence motifs PR00059 (Ribosomal protein L6 signature) and IPB001608 (Uncharacterized pyridoxal-5'-phosphate dependent enzyme family) in BLOCKS database, respectively, and the segment 179-215 of NSP13 matches to IPB000903 (Myristoyl-CoA: protein N-myristoyltransfe-rase). HMMPFAM search reveals that the segment 50-213 of NSP13 matches to PFOl728 (FtsJ-like methyltransferase) in HMM database. For NSP12, no matching conserved sequence motif is found in HMM and BLOCKS databases. The sequence identities of NSP11, NSP12 and NSP13 between various coronaviruses are about 50%, 40% and 60%.\n\nThe results above indicate that the protein products encoded by SARS-CoV ORFlab are very conservative among various coronaviruses. The matching conserved sequence families searched by BLIMPS, HMMPFAM and PSIBLAST are mainly from protease, which implies that these proteins encoded by ORFlab play various catalytic function roles during the virus life cycle.\n\n( ii) Analysis of structural proteins of SARS-CoV The S protein of coronaviruses is a large membrane glycoprotein. The mature S protein is inserted in the viral envelope with the majority of the protein exposed on the surface of viral particles and forms the primary viral sur- \n\nface projection. It is believed that the S trimer makes this virus family look like a corona structure under an electron microscope. The S proteins of majority of coronaviruses are cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits after synthesis. The S1 subunit is responsible for recognizing and binding of cellular receptors while the integral membrane S2 subunit is required to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membrane. For these reasons, the virulence and host cellular specificity of coronavirus are defined by S protein [8] . The S protein of SARS-CoV comprises 1255 amino acids and it is a strong acidic protein with molecular weight of 139.1 kD, pI 5.4, and there is a repetitive segment FNGLT at positions 529-533 and 837-841. TMHMM analysis of S protein predicts a transmembrane helical region near the C-terminus at residues 1196-1218, with the N-terminus segment 1-1195 oriented on the surface of viral particle, and C-terminus hydrophilic region 1219-1255 oriented inside the viral particle, in which the segment 1217-1236 (CCMTSCCSCLKGACSCGSCC) is rich in Cys. HMMPFAM search reveals that the region 75 -609 of SARS-CoV S protein matches to the conserved coronavirus Sl domain PF01600 in HMM database, and the region 641-1247 matches to conserved coronavirus S2 domain PF016001 in HMM database. The feature of the cleavage site of coronavirus S protein usually is a basic amino acid sequence RRXRR or RXRR; however, the S protein of SARS-CoV lacks such basic cleavage site, implying that it is probably not cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits and just forms Sl and S2 domains. Through searching for the homology sequences of coronavirus S proteins with PSIBLAST and aligning them with CLUSTALW, we found that the S2 domain of SARS-CoV is more conservative than the Sl domain because the former shares 18%-21% sequence identities with the Sl subunits of other coronaviruses, and the latter shares 34% -35% sequence identities with S2 subunits of other coronaviruses. This result can interpret well the functions of S protein: S1 domains are responsible for identification and binding of special receptors, various coronaviruses use different receptors and infect different host cells, which can explain the non-conserved property of Sl domains; while S2 domains are responsible for mediating fusion of viral and cellular membrane, such unique function explains the conserved property of S2 domains. The current mechanism of protein-mediated membrane fusion proposes the collapse model: first, the interaction of Sl subunit with the special cellular membrane receptor induces conformational change of S1, which in succession induces the structural changes of S2--some of the amphipathic a-helices in the carboxyl half of S2 collapse into coiled-coils, thus bringing a fusion peptide toward the transmembrane domain, resulting in cellular and viral membrane fusion [8] . We predicted the secondary structure of SARS-CoV S protein using eight different secondary structure prediction methods provided by the bioinfomatics platform of Workbench. The prediction results reveal nine successive a-helices at residue positions 750-10 10 (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, the relative hydrophobic and hydrophilic character of amino acids in S protein is calculated by GREASE program[23 J \u2022 The hydropathicity profile in 885-950 and 973-990 regions shows a distinct property that hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids present alternately, suggesting that such regions may be the amphipathic a-helices whose conformation could collapse into coiled-coils. It has recently been shown that for RCoV-229E virons, residues 417-546 are required for SA binding to the cellular receptor aminopeptidase N [24] . Through sequence alignment between S proteins of SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E, we found that the residues 492-----651 of SARS-CoV S protein correspond to residues 417-547 of HCoV-229E S protein. However, further experiments are required for identifying if residues 492-651 of SARS-CoV S protein are necessary for receptor binding. E protein of SARS-CoV is a small acidic protein comprising 76 amino acids with molecular weight of 8.3 kD. Both TMAP and TMHMM predict a hydrophobic transmembrane helix at residues 12-34, with residues 1-11 oriented inside viral particle and hydrophilic segment 35-76 on the surface of viral particle. HMMPFAM search reveals that the complete sequence of E protein matches to the conserved sequence motif PF02723 (NS3/small envelope protein E) in HMM database. BLIMPS search also reveals that the segment 36-----67 ofE protein matches to IPB003873 (conserved coronavirus small envelope protein E) in BLOCKS. However, PSIB-LAST search reveals that there are only two coronaviruses whose E proteins are similar to that of SARS-CoV in sequence: the murine hepatitis virus MHV and Rat sialodacryoadenitis coronavirus RSCoV, the sequence identities between E protein of SARS-CoV and those of the two coronaviruses are 23% and 24%, respectively, suggesting that E protein is not conservative in evolution. Furthermore, studies have revealed that the E protein in porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus is essential for virus replication [25] , while in MHV it has been shown that although deletion of gene E reduces virus replication by more than ten thousand fold, the virus still can replicate [26] . Further studies are required for ascertaining if E protein of SARS-CoV plays a functional role in virus replication in addition to attaching itself to the virus envelope.\n\nM protein is a basic protein comprising 221 amino acids with molecular weight of 25.1 kD. The residues 44 -97 near the N-terminus make up of a strongly hydrophobic region, and a repetitive segment LVIG presents at positions 21-24 and 137-140. PSIBLAST and alignment results reveal a strongly conserved sequence (WSFNPE) of SARS-CoV M protein at positions 109-114, while the sequence identities between M proteins of various coronaviruses are about 30%. TMHMM predicts three transmembrane a-helical segments located at residues 15-37, 50-72 and 77-99, with N-terminus residues 1 -14 on the surface of virus particle and C-terminus hydrophilic domain 100-221 on the inside of the virus particle. The segment inside the virus particle is rich in positive charged amino acids, and is believed to interact with the nucleocapsid or virus RNA. HMMPFAM and BLIMPS searches reveal that the complete sequence of E protein of SARS-CoV matches to conserved protein Protein N is a strongly basic protein comprising 422 amino acids with molecular weight of 46.0 kD, a repetitive segment SRGNS is found at positions 191-195 and 203-207. Both TMAP and TMHMM predict no transmembrane region. PSIBLAST and alignment analysis reveal a strongly conserved segment PRWYFYYLGTGP located at position 107-118, and the function of this segment is unknown. Furthermore, there is a segment KKKKTDEA-QPLPQRQKKQ at position 373-390 in SARS-CoV N protein that is rich in Lys, which matches to the bipartite nuclear targeting signal QDOC50079 in PFAM database, and is responsible for nuclear location and interaction. A hydrophilic segment (SRGGSQASSRSSSRSRGNSRNS-TPGSSRGNS) that is rich in Ser is located at position 177 -207. It is not clear if such segment interacts with nuclear. BLIMPS search indicates that the complete sequence of SARS-CoV N protein matches to IPBOOl218 (Coronavirus nucleocapsid protein); in addition, some partial sequences of N protein match to IPB002565 (Orbivirus NS3), IPB000096 (Serum amyloid A protein), IPBOOI677 (Transferrin binding protein), and IPB000689 (UbiH/ COQ6 monooxygenase family) in BLOCKS database. The sequence identities between the N proteins of SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses are about 30%.\n\n( iii) Analysis of function unknown proteins of SARS-CoV The putative protein Xl from SARS-CoV genome is an acidic protein comprising 274 amino acids with molecular weight of 30.9 kD. The analysis of Xl sequence reveals a strongly hydrophobic region FICNLL-LLFVTIYSHLLLVAAGMEAQFLYLYALIYFL located at 79-115. Both TMAP and TMHMM predict three transmembrane helical regions located at residues 34-56, 77 -99 and 103-125, with N-terminus residues 1-33 on the surface of virus particle and C-terminus residues 126 -274 on the inside of the virus particle. PSIBLAST search yields no corresponding homology sequence of other coronaviruses, and HMMPFAM analysis fails to identify any matching conserved sequence family in HMM database, while BLIMPS search reveals that the segment located at 231 -252 matches to PR01542 (Foot-and-mouth disease virus VPl coat protein signature), and segment at 67-87 matches to the conserved protein motif PR00699 (c. elegans integral membrane protein Srb signature), implying that Xl of SARS-CoV may be a structural protein inserted in the viral envelope.\n\nX2 is a strong basic protein comprising 154 amino acids, and the proportion of positive-charged amino acid (K+R) content to negative charged amino acid (D+E) content is 22 : 1. A repetitive small segment SLLK at positions 28-31 and 95-98 is found in X2. PSIBLAST search fails to identify any corresponding homology sequences. A C-terminal segment KKVSTNLCTHSFR-KKQVR located at residues 137-154 is found to match to bipartite nuclear localization signal PS50079INLS_BP in PFAM database. Both TMAP and TMHMM predict no transmembrane region. The results above suggest that X2 may function like N protein (for details see discussion for N protein), which is oriented inside virus particle, interacts with virus RNA, and should be essential for virus assembly.\n\nX3 is a small acidic protein comprising 63 amino acids with molecular weight of 7.5 kD. PSIBLAST search fails to identify any matching homology sequence, and both HMMPFAM and BLIMPS searches yield no matching conserved sequence family. Although TMHMM fails to predict transmembrane a-helix, TMAP analysis predicts a transmembrane segment located at position 9-37 with N-terminal residues 1-8 on the outside of virus particle. We cannot predict the function of X3 of SARS-CoV based on the analytical results above. X4 is a basic protein comprising 122 amino acids with molecular weight of 13.9 kD, and there is a strongly hydrophobic segment LFLIVAALVFLILCF located at residues 101-115 in X4. Both TMAP and TMHMM predict a transmembrane a-helical region at position 95-117, with N-terminal residues 1-94 on the outside of virus particle and C-terminal residues 118-122 on the inside of virus particle. We also note three uninterrupted basic amino acids KRK at C-terminal tail 118-l20 that may interact with virus RNA. BLIMPS search reveals the segment 101-119 of X4 matches to Tetracycline resistance protein TetE signature PR01036 in BLOCKS database, while PSI-BLAST search fails to yield any homology sequence matching to X4. These analyses suggest that X4 may be a structural protein that is inserted in virus envelope and plays a function role in virus assembly. X5 is a basic protein comprising 84 amino acids with molecular weight 9.5 kD. PSIBLAST search fails to identify any corresponding homology sequence of other coronaviruses matching to X5. TMAP and TMHMM predict no transmembrane segment. BLIMPS search reveals that the segment 52-68 1284 of X5 matches to conserved sequence family IPBOOOOO 1 (Kringle) in BLOCKS database. These analyses suggest that X5 may be oriented inside virus particle, the strongly positive-charged regions located at N-and C-terminuses may interact with virus RNA and facilitate virus assembly.\n\nHP5 (Hypothetical protein 5) is a strongly acidic protein comprising 98 amino acids with molecular weight of 10.8 kD. Both TMAP and TMHMM predict no transmembrane segment. HMMPFAM and BLIMPS searches yield no matching conserved protein motif. PSIBLAST search fails to identify any matching homology sequence. We cannot predict the function of HP5 from these analyses above.\n\nORF9 encodes a predicted small acidic protein comprising 44 amino acids with molecular weight of 5.3 kD, and the negative-charged amino acids are all located at Nand C-terminuses of this protein. PSIBLAST yields no matching homology protein. Both TMAP and TMHMM predict a transmembrane a-helical region at residues 9-31 with N-terminal residues 1-8 on the inside of virus and C-terminal residues 32-44 on the surface of virus particle. BLIMPS search reveals that the sequence 11-32 of ORF9 matches to conserved sequence family PR00697 (c. elegans Sra family integral membrane protein signature) in BLOCKS database, segment 8-32 matches to IPB001898 (Sodium:sulfate symporter family), and some other partial sequences match to IPB003804 (L-Iactate permease), PR01434 (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 5 signature), PR01535 (Vomeronasal type 2 receptor family signature), IPB001421 (Mitochondrial ATPase subunit 8), IPB003362 (Bacterial sugar transferase), PR00169 (Potassium channel signature) and PR00701 (60 kD inner membrane protein signature), respectively. We speculate from these results that the protein encoded by ORF9 may be a structural protein oriented in virus envelope whose function role is involved in ion transferring. The protein encoded by ORFlO is a small basic protein comprising 39 amino acids with molecular weight of 4.3 kD. PSIBLAST search fails to get any homology sequence matching to this protein. Although TMHMM predicts no transmembrane helical region, TMAP predicts a transmembrane segment located at residues 3 -31. BLIMPS search reveals that the segment 4-29 matches to IPBOOlOlO (Thionin) in BLOCKS database, and segments 2-25 and 6-15 match to PR01520 (Zeta-tubulin signature) and IPB003606 (N-terminal to some SET domains), respectively. The protein encoded by ORF14 is an acidic protein comprising 70 amino acids with molecular weight of 7.8 kD. PSIBLAST search fails to identify any matching homology sequence. TMHMM predicts no transmembrane helical region, while TMAP predicts a transmembrane segment at position 34 -61. Both HMMPFAM and BLIMPS searches yield no any matching conserved protein motif. We cannot predict the func-tions ofOFRlO and ORF14 from the results above.\n\n(iv) Phylogenetic analysis of the proteins of SARS-CoV We searched the non-redundant protein database (SDSC) for the homology sequences of each protein of SARS-CoV using PSIBLAST program, then the homology sequences of these proteins were subject to evolutionary distance matrix calculations (Table 3 ) and the unrooted phylogenetic trees were drawn (data not shown) to ascertain the classification status and evolutional relationship between SARS-CoV and other coronavimses.\n\nThe topologies of the resulting phylograms are remarkably similar, the species formed monophyletic clusters consistent with the established three taxonomic groups. For each protein of SARS-CoV that possesses of the homology sequences, the SARS-CoV sequence segregated into a fourth, well-resolved branch, which indicates that SARS-CoV is not related to any of the three previously characterized groups of coronavimses and forms a distinct group within the genus Coronavirus, this result is consistent with that of refs. [5, 6] . The evolutionary distance matrix analyses reveal that most of SARS-CoV proteins (except PLP and N) are approximately equidistant from the corresponding proteins of previously characterized coronavimses. For example, the evolutional distance of SARS-3CU ro against the corresponding proteins of other coronavimses ranges from 2.61 to 3.52, the average value is 3.09 and the standard deviation is 0.36; Rep ranges from 1.40 to 1.84, the average value is 1.66 and the standard deviation is 0.21; Hel ranges from 1.26 to 1.78, the average value is 1.52 and the standard deviation is 0.22, etc. (see Table 3 ). These results support the conclusion that SARS-CoV does not belong to any of the three previously characterized groups and should be within the fourth group reported by refs. [5, 6] . However, the evolutional distance analytical results indicate that the Hel and Rep related more closely to the corresponding proteins of other coronavimses, the average distances between them are less than 1.7 ( Table 3 ). The proteins Hel and Rep are responsible for vims RNA replication and transcription, and undergo a huge evolutional pressure because of their conserved functions, so the sequences and structures of them are more conservative than those of other SARS-CoV proteins. Furthermore, it is interesting that most of proteins of BoCoV and MHV are more close to the corresponding proteins of SARS-CoV in evolutional distance. For example, there are seven proteins PLP, NSP4, Rep, Hel, NSPll, NSP12 and S in Bo-CoV possessing of the closest evolutional distances against the corresponding proteins of SARS-CoV, and six proteins 3CU ro , HD2, GFLP, Rep, M and N in MHV possessing of the closest evolutional distances against the corresponding proteins of SARS-CoV However, there is no evidence to prove that the proteins of SARS-CoV come from the recombination of BoCoV and MHV or other coronavimses.\n\nThe phylogenetic and evolutional distance analyses \n\nof SARS-CoV associated proteins indicate that it is a previously unknown coronavirus and neither come from the recombination of the previously characterized coronaviruses nor arise as a mutant of known human or animal coronaviruses. We conjecture that there are two possible sources for SARS-CoV: One possibility is that it arises as a mutant of an unknown animal coronavirus or as a recombinant of two unknown coronaviruses, and acquired new virulence factors and the ability to infect humans; the other one is that it arises as a mutant of unknown human coronavirus that acquired new virulence factors. However, antibodies to the SARS-CoV werefound in serum samples obtained from patients with SARS during convalescence but not in human serum samples from people without SARS[3 J , which indicates no existence of such \"mild\" unknown human coronavirus. The large-scale serologic tests of wild and domestic animals and birds in the region where the SARS outbreak first appeared may identify the usual host or \"sources\" of SARS-CoV When this manuscript will be completed, a research team from the University of Hong Kong stated that a coronavirus resembling the SARS virus had been isolated from six masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) in a wild-animal market in Shenzhen, China, and five out of the ten civet handlers at the market had antibodies against the SARS virus in their blood[27 J \u2022 However, how does the coronavirus in palm civet acquire the ability to infect human (mutant or recombinant)? Does the SARS-CoV arisen from palm civets coronavirus still possess the ability to infect palm civets? Does it cause the lower respiratory tract infection? Is there any other animal hosts for SARS-CoV? The resolvents of these questions are essential for annihilation of SARS completely.\n\nThe predictions of the molecular weight, pI and extinction coefficient for all the proteins of SARS-CoV are helpful for their separation, extraction and purification. And the transmembrane region predictions, the conserved sequence family searches, and homology sequence alignments provide significant information for predicting protein function. The analytical results indicate that the protein products encoded by ORFlab mainly playa function role in polyprotein cleavage, virus RNA replication and RNA transcription. Xl protein is possessed of transmembrane segments and an integral membrane protein Srb signature sequence, suggesting that Xl may be a structural protein that is oriented in the virus envelope. X2 protein is a strongly basic protein. It possesses no transmembrane segment and has a bipartite nuclear localization signal, suggesting that it may interact with and bind to virus RNA and facilitate virus assembly. The secondary structure features and hydrophobic and hydrophilic character of S 1286 protein support well the collapse model of coronavirus membrane fusion mechanism. The bioinformatical analysis of S protein provides useful information in search of antigenic determinant aimed at S protein. This study establishes the foundations for construction of the structures of SARS-CoV associated proteins with molecular modeling and for determination of SARS-CoV proteomics with experiments, and in the long run, it provides significant information for design of anti-SARS drugs and for development of antiviral vaccine."}
