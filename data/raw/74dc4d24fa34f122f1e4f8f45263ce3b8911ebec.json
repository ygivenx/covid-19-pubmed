{"title": "Primary Structure of the Membrane and Nucleocapsid Protein Genes of Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus and lmmunogenicity of Recombinant Vaccinia Viruses in Kittens", "body": "The feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV) causes a highly fatal disease in cats. In the pathogenesis of FIP the immune status of the animal is very important: cats with preexisting antibodies to FIPV may experience an accelerated infection upon challenge, resulting in survival times shorter than those of seronegative animals (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Weiss and Scott, 1981) . This phenomenon is referred to as \"early death.\" The underlying mechanism is thought to be an antibody-dependent enhancement of infection of macrophages (Pot-terfield, 1986) . Although antibodies against the spike protein (S) neutralized viral infectivity in vitro (de Groot et al., 1989; Vennema et a/., 1990a) , immunization of kittens with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the S protein caused early death after challenge (Vennema et a/., 1990a) .\n\nThe FIPV virion contains three protein species: The 200,000 mol wt S protein, the 25-30,000 mol wt membrane glycoprotein M, and the 45,000 mol wt nucleocapsid protein N (reviewed by Spaan et al., 1988) . During natural and experimental FIPV infections antibodies are found against all structural proteins (Boyle et al., 1984; Horzinek et a/., 1986) . For other coronaviruses it ' To whom reprint requests should be addressed. * Present address: Department of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Leiden. has been demonstrated that antibodies against M or N may inhibit virus replication, in addition to those directed against S. In the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) system monoclonal antibodies against both M and N which neutralize infectivity in vitro and were able to protect mice against lethal challenge have been found (Fleming et a/,, 1989; Lecomte et a/., 1987) . Protection was also demonstrated for a monoclonal antibody against N, which did not neutralize MHV in vitro (Nakanaga et al., 1986) . Monoclonal antibodies against the M protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine neutralized viral infectivity in vitro in the presence of complement, whereas those against N did not . Fiscus and Teramoto (1987) described six anti-FIPV N protein and two anti-FIPV M protein monoclonal antibodies which failed to neutralize in vitro.\n\nIn this report we present the cDNA cloning and sequence analysis of the M and N protein genes of FIPV. The cloned genes were expressed using the recombinant vaccinia virus system. These recombinants were used to immunize kittens, which were subsequently challenged with FIPV. Cloning and sequencing of the FIPV M and N genes\n\nThe preparation of a cDNA library of FIPV genomic RNA has been described (de Groot et a/., 1987b).\n\nClones containing sequences derived from the 3' end of the genome were identified as described before (de Groot et al., 1988) . Restriction fragments of clone B12 (de Groot et al., 1988) , were subcloned in Ml 3 and sequenced, using the dideoxy chain termination procedure @anger eta/., 1977) . Comparison with the published sequence of the 3' one-third of the TGEV genome (Rasschaert eta/., 1987) allowed identification of the coding regions of both the M and N gene. Sequence data were analyzed using the computer programs of Staden (1982) and Devereux et al. (1984) .\n\nRecombinant DNA techniques were performed essentially as described by Maniatis er al. (1982) . The FIPV M gene was isolated as an 870-bp Klenow-filled Sryl-M/u1 fragment and recloned in the Smal site of vaccinia virus insertion vector pSC1 1 (Chakrabarti et al., 1985;  obtained from Dr. B. Moss), yielding plasmid pSCFM. The Sty1 site (5'-C-CAAGG-3') was located 48 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon, and the Mlul site (5'-ACGCGT-3') was located 30 nucleotides downstream of the termination codon. The N gene was isolated as a 1159-bp Noel-Sphl fragment which was made blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and recloned in pSC1 1, yielding plasmid pSCFN. The fill-in reaction of the Ndel site (5'-CA_TATG-3'), located 23 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon of the N coding region, restored an AUG codon. The reading frame followed by this AUG is only two amino acids long and terminates just upstream of the N gene. The Sphl site (5'-GCATG-C-3') was located 7 nucleotides downstream from the N gene termination codon. All restriction sites are underlined in Fig. 2 .\n\nThe insertion plasmids, pSCFM and pSCFN were then used to construct the recombinant vaccinia viruses vFM and vFN respectively, using procedures de-scribed before (Chakrabarti et a/., 1985) . For control experiments the recombinant vaccinia virus vSC was constructed using pSC1 1.\n\nRecombinant vaccinia viruses vFM, vFN, and vSC were used to immunize kittens. Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) kittens, 13 to 14 weeks of age, were injected subcutaneously with 10' PFU. A second immunization with 5 X 1 O* PFU of the appropriate virus was given 3 weeks later. Two weeks after the second immunization, all kittens were challenged orally with 3 X 1 O5 PFU of FIPV strain 79-l 146; they were examined daily for clinical signs. Euthanasia was carried out when the kittens became prostrate and a full postmortem examination was performed.\n\nLysates of FIPV-infected fcwf-D cells or recombinant vaccinia virus-infected HeLa cells were prepared after metabolic labeling with L-[35S]methionine.\n\nRadioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) and analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were carried out as described before (Vennema et al., 1990b) .\n\nNeutralizing antibody was determined in heat-inactivated sera using fcwf-D cells in a 96-well microplate assay. Titers were expressed as the maximum serum dilution that inhibited the cytopathic effect of 100 50% tissue culture infectious doses of FIPV.\n\nThe coding regions of the M and N proteins have been assigned to mRNAs 4 and 5, respectively (de Groot er a/., 1987a). Together with mRNA 6, these mRNAs correspond to the 3' end of the FIPV genome. The preparation of a cDNA library of FIPV genomic RNA has been described (de Groot et a/., 1987b).\n\nClones containing sequences derived from the 3' end of the genome were identified by colony hybridization, using mRNA 6 as a probe (de Groot et a/., 1988). Clone B12 was selected for sequence analysis. The sequencing strategy is shown in Fig. 1 . Additional cDNA clones were isolated from the library using fragments of pB 12 as probes and analyzed to confirm the nucleotide sequence. By comparison with the published sequence of TGEV regions of both the M and N protein genes were identified. The nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 2 . The nucleotide sequence was 79% identical to the corresponding sequence of TGEV . Optimal alignments of the predicted amino acid sequences are represented graphically in Fig. 3 . Among the M protein sequences most differences were found in the N-terminal region which is thought to protrude from the viral membrane. Between the N protein sequences domains with insertions/deletions and multiple differences were found around residues 200 and 350. Other differences were predominantly conservative changes. Overall identity was slightly lower for the N proteins (77%) than for the M (84.7%) and S proteins (82.29/o; Jacobs et al., 1987) .\n\nRecombinant vaccinia viruses containing the FIPV M and N protein genes were constructed as described above. Expression of the recombinant proteins was studied in an immunoprecipitation assay with lysates of L-[36S]methionine-labeled cells (Fig. 4) . The proteins produced in vFM-and vFN-infected cells comigrated with the authentic viral M and N proteins and were specifically precipitated by ascitic fluid from a cat that had died of FIP. The recombinant M protein was fully glycosylated as demonstrated by removal of the oligo-saccharide side chains with endoglycosidase H (data not shown).\n\nKittens were immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses and subsequently challenged with FIPV as described under Materials and Methods. Details of the immunized kittens are presented in Table 1 , together with the survival times. After challenge the kittens developed fever during the first 3 days; they returned to normal body temperatures by Postchallenge Day (PCD) 9-l 0. Secondary pyrexia started on PCD 1 l-l 5 (exceptions: M81 on PCD 28, 721 on PCD 27; M89 had only a few days of pyrexia) and reached up to 41.2\". All kittens were anorectic from PCD 16 onwards. Fluid therapy was given where necessary. The mortality curves after challenge are represented in Fig.  5 . Most kittens were euthanized between 3 and 4 weeks after challenge. In the groups immunized with vSC and vFN seven animals were euthanized during this period, in contrast to only three of those immunized with vFM. During the 6th week after challenge two animals immunized with vFM and one immunized with vFN were euthanized. Postmortem examination showed that all kittens, with the exception of 722, had peritoneal effusions and granulomatous lesions on the viscera. Cat 722 was apparently normal, apart from weight loss. It was euthanized on PCD 22 because of  50  70  90  ~~AT*TAATCCCCACCGc~~TGGTTTCGTnCAAtTAAG  MKYILLILACIIACVYG  110  130  150  170  190  GTGAACGCTACTGTGCCATGCAAGACAGTGGCTTGCAGTGTATT~TGGCAC~TTC~~TGTC~CCTGCT~~CGTGGT~TCTTA~TGGCA  ERYCAMQDSGLQCINGTNSRCQTCFERGDLIWH  210  230  250  270  290  TCTTGCTAACTGGAACTTCAGCTGGTCTGTAATATTGATTGTT~TAT~CAGTG~A~TATGG~~CCA~T~A~TGGCTCG~TAT~CATT  LANWNFSWSVILIVFITVLQYGRPQFSWLVYGI  310  330  350  370  390  AAAATGCTGATCATGTU;CTATTATGGCCTA~GTTCTAGCGC~AC~~~T~TGCATACTCT~GTACC~GT~CCA~TATGT~TG~CGGCT  KMLIMWLLWPIVLALTIFNAYSEYQVSRYVMFGF  410  430  450  470  490  TTAGTGTTGCAGGTGCAGTTGTAACGTTTGCACTTTGW\\T  SVAGAVVTFALWMMYFVRSVQLYRRTKSWWSFN  510  530  550  570  590  TCCTGAGACTAATGCAATTCTTTGTGTTAATGCATTGGGTA~GTTATGTGCTTCCCTTA~TGGTACTCCTACAGGTGTTACCCTTACTCTAC~TCA  PETNAILCVNALGRSYVLPLDGTPTGVTLTLLS  610  630  650  670  690  GGAAATCTATATGCTGAAGGTTTCAAAATGGCTGGTGGTCCATCGAGCA~TGCCT~TACGTCAT~~GCTACACCTAGTA~CCATCGTTT  GNLYAEGFKMAGGLTIEHLPKYVMIATPSRTIVY  710  730  750  770  790  ATACATTAGTTGGAAAACAT~GCAACTACTGCCACAGGATGGGCTTACTACGT~TCT~GCTGGT~TTACTC~CAG~GCACGTACT~ T T 0  810  830  850  870  890  CAATTTGAGTGAACATGTATTA~GTGTAACTA  NLSEHEKLLHMV*  MATQGQRVNWGDEPSK  910  930  950  970  990  AGACGTGGTCGTTCTAACTCTCGTGGTCGGAAGAATAATGT  RRGRSNSRGRKNNDIPLSFYNPITLEQGSKFWNL  1010  1030  1050  1070  1090  TATGTCCGAGAW\\CC~GTTCCCAAAGGAATAGGTAATAACG  CPRDLVPKGlGNKDQQlGYWNRQlRYRlVKGQR  1110  1130  1150  1170  1190  TAAGGAACTCGCTGAW\\GGTGGTTCTTTTACrrCTTAGGTACAG~CCTCATGCT~TGCT~TTC~~C~~~~TG~GTCTTCTGGG~GCA  KELAERWFFYFLGTGPHADAKFKDKIDGVFWVA  1210  1230  1250  1270  1290  AGGGATGGTGCCATGAACACCCACAACGCTTGGCACTCGTGG~CC~T~C~TCC~CCACT~~T~GATGGT~~TACCGCCACAGT~C  RDGAMNKPTTLGTRGTNNESKPLRFDGKIPPQFQ  1310  1330  1350  1370  1390  AGCTTGAAGTWV\\CCGTTCTAGGAACAATTCA4GGTCTGGTTCTCAGTCTAGATCTGTTTC~~CA~TCTC~TCTAGAG~~CACCATTCC~  LEVNRSRNNSRSGSQSRSVSRNRSQSRGRHHSN  1410  1430  1450  1470  1490  TAACCAGAATAATAATGTTGAGGATACAATTGTAGCCGTGCTTWT  NQNNNVEDTIVAVLEKLGVTDKQRSRSKPRERS  1510  1530  1550  1570  1590  GATTCCAAACCTAGGGACACAACACCTAAGAATGCCAACA  DSKPRDTTPKNANKHTWKKTAGKGDVTTFYGARS  1610  1630  1650  1670  1690  GTAGTTCAGCTR9CTTTGGTGATAGTGATCTCGTTGCCAAT  SSANFGDSDLVANGNAAKCYPQIAECVPSVSSI  1710  1730  1750  1770  1790  AATCTrrGGCAGTCAATGGTCTGCTGAAGAAGCTGGTCAiT  IFGSQWSAEEAGDQVKVTLTHTYYLPKDDAKTS  1810  1830  1850  1870  1890  CAATTCCTAGAACAGATTGGCTTACAACCGACCTTCTGGCCTG  QFLEQIDAYKRPSEVAKDQRQRRSRSKSADKKPE  1910  1930  1950  1970 : I I i~ntn~~ 1 I I III1 I I I I II Ill1 II II I   TGEVM.  5A  I  I   100  150  A  *A0   50  loo  150  200  250  300  350  I  I  I  I  I  I  I   FPVN   I Ill III I I II I I III IIIIII III I Iii7 #II Ill I I III 11111111 Humoral immune response to FIPV proteins Serum samples were taken on the days of primary and secondary immunization, 3 days before challenge and at different PCDs, or on the day when euthanasia was pet-formed. Aliquots of sera obtained from animals Recombinant vFS. expressing the FIPV S protein (Vennema et a/., 1990b) , was included (lane vFS). FIPV structural proteins and the recombinant vaccinia virus expression products have been indicated. 14C-labeled marker protein molecular weights in kilodaltons have been indicated on the left side. from one group were pooled for each time point and used in an RIP assay with a lysate of metabolically labeled, FIPV-infected cells. The amount of pooled antiserum used was such that each individual serum was diluted lOO-fold in the final immunoprecipitation mixture. Pooled sera of the days of primary and secondary immunization gave a background level of precipitation (Fig. 6) . Particularly, the nucleocapsid protein was precipitated nonspecifically, probably by binding to Pansorbin. Pooled sera from 3 days before challenge of the kittens immunized with vFM and vFN precipitated the M and N proteins, respectively. The same serum pool of the control group gave only background signal. After challenge, the amount of N and M protein precipitated increased, starting from PCD 5 and 7, respectively, as a result of secondary immune responses. The primary response against the S protein could be detected at low levels on PCD 9. The pooled sera of vFN-immunized kittens from before and shortly after challenge appeared to precipitate small amounts of M protein.\n\nSince the intensity of the signal correlated with the amount of N protein detected, precipitation of the M protein may be due to formation of complexes between M and N as was described previously for MHV (Sturman et al., 1980) . Coprecipitation of N protein with antibodies against M was not observed, probably because it was below the background level of N precipitation. Antibody against all structural proteins increased to high levels between PCD 9 and 17 in all groups.\n\nIn order to find out whether antibody levels and survival times correlated for the kittens immunized with vFM, individual sera were tested from the day of secondary immunization, 3 days before challenge and PCD 1, 9, and 17. Although differences in the levels of antibodies were seen (Fig. 7) these did not correlate with the survival times. Similarly, small differences were found in the levels of antibody against the S and N proteins on PCD 17; again there was no correlation with survival times.\n\nIn vitro neutralizing activity of sera from immunized kittens Sera were tested in a neutralization assay. Neutralizing activity was not detected in pooled sera until PCD 5. At this day sera delayed but did not completely inhibit CPE. From PCD 7 onwards neutralization titers gradually increased similarly in all groups, from 1 OW2 to 2 X lop4 on PCD 23. No differences were observed between the vFM group and the other two groups which could be advocated to explain the differences in survival time. Also, among the kittens of the vFM group, only small differences were observed in the de-velopment of neutralization titers with respect to time (data not shown).\n\nComparison of the amino acid sequences of the M protein of FIPV and TGEV revealed an overall identity of 84.7%. The structural features predicted for the TGEV M protein Kapke et al., 1988; Britton et a/., 1988) , also apply to FIPV. Interestingly, a short stretch of highly divergent amino acid sequence was observed. A stretch of 23 amino acids (residues 23 to 45) between the signal sequence and the first hydrophobic domain had only 47.8% identity in an optimal alignment. The N-glycosylation site and three cysteine residues located in this region were conserved. In analogy to MHV, this part of the M protein is predicted to be exposed on the outside of virus particles (Rottier et a/., 1986) . The observed divergence in this region is indicative of specific immunologic pressure. Presumably, an immune response against this portion of the M protein influences virus multiplication.\n\nFrom the data of the M protein of FIPV an N-terminal signal sequence is predicted, similar to the one found in TGEV Britton et al., 1988) . The N-terminal signal sequence of the TGEV M protein is not absolutely required for translocation and glycosylation (Kapke eta/., 1988) . However, after its removal only a small portion of the M protein produced by in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes became glycosylated . A construct of the FIPV M gene lacking the signal se- infected kittens. FIPV-specific antibodies were detected using a lysate of metabolically labeled FIPV-infected fcwf-D cells as antigen source. Panels vSC, vFM, and vFN: pooled sera of eight kittens immunized with vSC, vFM, or vFN, respectively. The lanes marked 1 st, 2nd. and -3 represent reactions at the day of the first and second immunization, and at 3 days before challenge. Subsequent numbers indicate the postchallenge day on which sera quence coding region was expressed in HeLa cells (data not shown), using the hybrid vaccinia virus T7 expression system (Fuerst et al,, 1986 ). The mutant M protein was fully glycosylated (data not shown), which illustrates that the N-terminal signal sequence of the FIPV M protein is not required for glycosylation. After alignment of the N proteins of FIPV and TGEV two divergent regions, which may represent immunologically important domains in the N protein, were found. Since the N protein is not exposed on the outside of virus particles, these domains may represent T-cell epitopes rather than B-cell epitopes.\n\nWe have shown before that immunization of kittens with the FIPV S protein expressed by a live recombinant vaccinia virus made them more sensitive to challenge than control animals (Vennema er a/., 1990a). We now show that neither the N protein nor the M protein expressed by recombinant vaccinia viruses induced early death after challenge. Immunization with vFN induced N-protein specific antibodies in kittens but appeared to have no effect on the outcome of challenge. In contrast, immunization with vFM markedly affected the survival time after challenge in a number of kittens. However, all animals seroconverted after challenge (Fig. 7D ) and showed clinical signs (pyrexia and anorexia) and only three of eight animals recovered from infection. Clearly, the significance of these results needs to be substantiated with additional immunization experiments. The serological assays performed with individual sera from the animals of the vFM-immunized group showed no correlation between antibody levels and survival times. It has been implied that immunity against FIPV is largely ceil-mediated (Pedersen, 1989 ). Measurements of cell-mediated immunity in experimentally infected cats have been reported but were difficult to perform and showed considerable variation (Pedersen, 1987) .\n\nFor further immunization experiments to evaluate the potential role of the M protein in protection we consider improvement of its immunogenicity with an approach similar to that shown recently for recombinant vaccinia virus-encoded HIV-1 gpl60 (Earl et a/., 1990) . It was demonstrated that removal of 2 cryptic vaccinia were taken. Sera taken postmortem from kittens euthanized between the indicated time points were included in the pool of the closest time point. Therefore, at 31 days after challenge n = 4 for pool vSC, n = 5 for pool vFM, and n = 3 for pool vFN and at PCD 24 n = 7 for pool vFN. For all other pools n = 8. 12345678 12345678 12345678 12345678 FIG. 7. SDS-PAGE analysis of RIP assays with individual sera of the vFM-Immunized group. Kittens immunized with vFM were numbered from shortest to longest survival time after challenge; these were 2 1 days for 1 (89s). 23 days for 2 (89R) and 3 (M93), 36 days for 4 (M94), 41 days for 5 (M88), or more than 90 days for 6 (M87), 7 (721), and 8 (M79). Sera were from the day of the second immunizatlon (A). from 3 days before challenge (B), and from 9 (C) and 17 (D) days after challenge; panels A through C represent only the lower portions of the gels containing the M protein bands. D Illustrates the primary immune response against the S and N proteins. The structural oroteins have been indicated. virus early transcription termination signals (mNT; Rohrmann et a/., 1986) enhanced the immunogenicity considerably. The M protein gene contains 1 transcription termination signal. Expression of the M protein in vitro could be measured only after 6 hr p.i. (data not shown) although transcription is driven by the 7.5-kDa gene early-late promoter. Besides increasing immunogenicity, early expression is essential for the induction of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) by recombinant vaccinia viruses (Wachsman et al., 1989) . Specific CTLs are probably of major importance in recovery from FIPV infection but the viral antigens involved are not known. Enhancement of the induction of CTLs by removal of early transcription termination signals remains to be shown."}
