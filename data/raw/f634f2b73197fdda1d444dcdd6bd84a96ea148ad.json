{"title": "Viral fitness predicts the magnitude and direction of perturbations in the infected host transcriptome", "body": ". Analyses of expression data allowed us to characterize differential gene expression upon infection with each TEV genotype, as well as to identify sets of candidate genes whose expressions positively or negatively correlate with the magnitude of TEV fitness. Moreover, differences in expression for representative genes from these two categories were experimentally validated by an alternative method.\n\nDifferences in viral fitness and host symptomatology. Table 1 shows relevant information about the seven TEV genotypes used for this study. The mutant genotypes differ from the wildtype (WT) TEV in a rather limited number of nonsynonymous mutations (1 or 2). However, their fitness values and the severity of symptoms induced differ widely. Significant differences existed among the fitness values of the seven viral genotypes chosen for this study ( Fig. 2A ; GLM likelihood ratio test: c 2 = 373.006, 6 df, P < 0.001) and among plants inoculated with the same viral genotype (c 2 = 2927.885, 14 df, P < 0.001). As a measure of the quality of data, the percentage of total variance for relative fitness explained by true genetic differences among genotypes was 70.56%, whilst differences among plants inoculated with the same viral genotype accounted for 29.16% of the observed variance. The remaining 0.28% of the observed variability was assignable to error measurements. A Bonferroni post hoc test classifies the seven genotypes into five groups (labeled as a to f in Fig. 2A) . Interestingly, the three genotypes with the lowest fitness values (AS13, CLA2 and CLA11) contain mutations in the multifunctional protein HC-Pro, whose most relevant role during infection is to serve as suppressor of the RNA-silencing (VSR) defense 40 . The two genotypes with mutations in the CI protein (PC55 and PC48), a helicase also involved in cell-to-cell movement 40 , have the mildest deleterious fitness effects.\n\nMutant PC95, which contains a point mutation in the replicase NIb protein 40 Symptoms ranged from the asymptomatic infection or local chlorotic spots characteristic of mutant AS13, the mild etching of mutant CLA11 and the severe etching induced by the WT and the other mutants. No correlation exists between virus fitness and symptoms, a finding previously reported for this experimental system 32 .\n\nDifferences in viral fitness are associated with differences in the magnitude of the perturbation over the host transcriptome. First, we sought to test whether differences in TEV fitness might be associated with differences in the gene expression profiles of the infected plants.\n\nWe hypothesized that viral fitness results from a particular interaction between virus and host factors, assuming that the outcome of infection of a WT virus in its natural host results from an optimal (from the virus perspective) modulation of the host's gene expression profile. As viral fitness in the host is reduced, interactions are less optimal and, consequently, the gene expression profile of the plant will be more and more different from that resulting from the successful infection with the WT genotype. To test this hypothesis, we infected N. tabacum plants with each one of the seven TEV genotypes described above. Eight days post-inoculation (dpi) symptomatic tissues were collected for all mutants except for the very low fitness mutant AS13, for which tissues were collected 15 dpi because the delay in symptoms appearance and severity (Fig. 2B) .\n\nTotal RNAs were extracted, its quality verified, concentration normalized and used to hybridize N. tabacum Gene Expression 4\u00d744K Microarrays (Agilent). Slides were handled as described in the Methods section; intensity signals were normalized using tools in BABELOMICS 41 .\n\nNormalized expression data are contained in Supplementary Dataset S1. Fig. 3A shows the clustering (unweighted average distance method; UPGMA) of average expression data for those genes that significantly changed expression (\u00b12-fold) among plants infected with the seven viral genotypes (1-way ANOVAs with FDR correction; overall P < 0.05) relative to the mockinoculated plants.\n\nRegarding individual genes, two major clusters can be distinguished, one corresponding to the over-expression of genes related to stress response and a second one corresponding to the underexpression of genes involved with metabolism and plant development. To further explore the similarity in the perturbation induced by each viral genotype into the plants' transcriptome, we computed all pairwise Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (r) between the mean expression values for all genes in the microarray. Then, these correlations were used as a measure of similarity to build a UPGMA dendrogram. The rationale for this analysis is as follows: the more correlated two expression profiles are, the more similar the effects induced in infected plants. When comparing expression profiles from a pair of infected plants, a significant correlation may indicate that genes that changed expression relative to the mock-inoculated plants, are exactly the same in both samples, showing a similar expression pattern. If this is the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/206789 doi: bioRxiv preprint case, the correlation coefficient is expected to be high. Conversely, if genes with differential expression do not match in the two samples being compared, then the correlation will be lower. Three clusters result from this analysis (Fig. 3B) show the most dissimilar gene expression profile. The heat-map is shown with viral genotypes ordered according to the UPGMA clustering. Obviously, it is symmetric, with the diagonal corresponding to the correlation between profiles from plants infected with the same viral genotype, thus being r \u00bb 1. Correlations decreased as the distance in the cladogram increases.\n\nWithin clusters, r > 0.85, whilst between clusters the correlations ranged 0.65 < r < 0.75, except for plants infected with AS13, whose similarity with other infected plants was always r < 0.65.\n\nNext, to further investigate the similarity between expression profiles of plants infected with different TEV genotypes, we performed principal components analysis (PCA) of all the gene expression data. The percentage of total observed variance explained by the first three PCAs was ~93% (the first principal component, pc 1 , itself explained up to 81%). Fig. 3C shows the distribution of values in the space defined by the three first principal components. Results are equivalent to those obtained with the two previous clustering methods, as genotypes are classified into three groups. WT, PC55 and PC48 are closer in the space and characterized by positive values of pc 1 but negative values of the second (pc 2 ) and third (pc 3 ) components. CLA11, PC95 and CLA2 form a second group, with positive values of pc 1 and pc 2 but negative values of pc 3 .\n\nAs before, AS13 effect on host' transcriptome is clearly different, and has negative values of pc 1 and pc 2 but positive of pc 3 . Interestingly, Fig. 3C shows that genotypes are located in this principal component space following a trajectory of increasing fitness values (indicated by the grey arrow in Fig. 3C ). Along this trajectory, pc's switch of sign but in different ways. This transition suggests that the over-or under-expression of a set of genes is associated with particular levels of viral fitness: low fitness AS13 is characterized by a positive pc 3 and a negative pc 1 while high fitness viruses are characterized by the opposite sign. That is, over-or under-expressed genes are not progressively accumulated as long as viral fitness changes. These genes will be evaluated in the following sections.\n\nFollowing from our working hypothesis, if the WT virus has evolved to optimize its interaction with the host, it is logical that small departures in viral fitness will be associated with small deviations between the transcriptomes of plants infected with the WT virus and with viruses whose fitness are close to the WT. Conversely, the less similar fitness between the WT and mutant viruses, the more dissimilar would be the transcriptional profiles of infected plants. To test this prediction, we have explored (i) the correlation between the similarity of transcriptional profiles of plants infected with the WT TEV and with each mutant (again using Pearson's r) and\n\n.

The results of these analyses are shown in Figs. 3D and 3E. As expected, both correlations were significant (r = 0.826, P = 0.005 and r = -0.857, P = 0.003, respectively; in both cases 5 d.f.) and of the expected sign.\n\nThe number of altered genes depends on viral fitness. Next, following the same rationale than in the previous section, we sought to determine whether the number of DEGs also depends on the difference in fitness between WT and the mutant TEV genotypes. In this case, we hypothesized that the overlap in the lists of DEGs must be similar for WT and viruses of equivalent fitness (e.g., PC48 or PC55), whereas the magnitude of the overlap between DEG lists would decrease as differences in fitness exist. Of particular interest following all results presented above is the similarity between PC95, a mutant of the replicase NIb gene, and CLA11, a mutant of the VSR HC-Pro gene. These two mutations led to close fitness values ( Fig. 2A) , but also resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles (Fig. 4B ). At first sight, one may argue that their impact in transcriptomic profiles should be different since these mutations affect virus proteins that are functionally unrelated. However, our results suggest that the effects on the overall virus-host interaction of each mutant are canalized in the same way. This clearly exemplifies that viral fitness, despite its incompleteness, is a figure that contains high information about the virus-host interaction. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/206789 doi: bioRxiv preprint functions that appear as enriched among negatively correlated DEGs. Together, these results suggest that positively correlated DEGs play a role in the transcriptional regulation of host defenses. By contrast, DEGs with negative correlation between expression and TEV fitness participate more in catalytic and transport activities than genes with positive correlation, suggesting a redirection of resources by the host to face the viral infection, which is not independent of viral fitness. VQ29 is a negative transcriptional regulator of light-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation that likely promotes the transcriptional activation of phytochrome interacting factor 1 (PIF1) during early seedling development, participates in the jasmonic acid-mediated (JA) plant basal defense and the VQ proteins interact with WRKY transcription factors 43 .

FDM1 is an SGS3-like protein that acts in RNA-directed DNA methylation participating in the RNA silencing defense pathway 50 . GBSS1 is involved in glucan biosynthesis and responsible of amylase synthesis essential for plant growth and other developmental processes 51 . Relative expression data were calculated using the DDC T method normalized by each one of the two reference genes and then averaged. Finally, to make expression data by both methods (microarray readings and RT-qPCR) readily comparable, they were both transformed into z- For each gene, the right plot shows both expression z-scores as a function of TEV fitness; solid lines represent the best linear fitting between normalized expressions and TEV fitness. In this representation, the more overlap between the two regression lines, the better the agreement between both quantitative methods. In this representation, VQ29 and ADK2 show the largest departure between both regression lines, thought even in these extreme cases, the difference was not large enough as to be significant in a non-parametric Wilcoxon's signed ranks test (P \u00b3 0.499 in all nine cases) or in a Student's t-test for the comparison of regression coefficients (P \u00b3 0.285).\n\nThus, we conclude that, at least for the sample of genes here analyzed, the observed correlations between host's gene expression and viral fitness are consistent for both experimental methods used to evaluate the levels of gene expression.

Plant-virus interactions result from the confrontation of two players with opposed strategies and interests. From the plant perspective, activation of basal defenses, immunity, hormone-regulated pathways, and RNA-silencing (some of which are not virusspecific) will result in an immediate benefit to control virus replication and spread. We found that there are plant's defense responses that are expressed upon infection regardless the fitness of the virus, and defense responses induced progressively as viral fitness increases. Consistent with the first mode, we observed the activation of the genes EDS1 and PAD4, components of R genemediated disease resistance with homology to lipases, in every infection studied in this work (Fig.   8A ). These are master regulators of plant defenses that connect pathogen signals with salicylic acid (SA) signaling 53 . SA is involved in resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogens, and in particular viruses 54, 55 . Consistent with the second mode, we observed the activation of many genes involved in defenses in an extent that is proportional to TEV fitness (Fig. 8A ). For example, the DCL2 and AGO1 genes -key for the RNA silencing response-, genes modulating resistance to pathogens such as the subtilisin-like protease (SBT1.9), or genes expressing proteins involved in hormone-regulated defenses such as GASA1 and VQ29, brassinosteroids (e.g., brassinosteroid However, these activations have a cost, mainly in terms of resources that can be invested into secondary metabolism and development. Consistent with this idea is the fact that many genes participating in metabolic processes (e.g., CYSC1, a cysteine synthase) are highly repressed upon infection (Fig. 8A ). There are also central genes for the plant metabolism whose repression correlates with viral fitness, such as GBSS1, photosystem components or assembly factors (e.g., HCF136) , Rubisco subunits and ATPases, catalases, transketolases, nucleotide and phosphate transporters, synthases involved in flavonoid, isoprenoid, ascorbate, or tryptophan biosynthesis, and GAPDH (Fig. 7) .\n\nDiverting host cell resources and reprograming the metabolic machinery to support RNA metabolism and ATP production is a general strategy both of plant 56 and animal viruses 57, 58 . TEV achieves this reprogramming by altering the expression of a series of genes in its own benefit. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/206789 doi: bioRxiv preprint For example, we found the expression of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton organization such as ADF4 and PFN3 to be negatively correlated with TEV fitness. The profilin PNF3 is a actinbinding protein and ADF4 participates in the depolymerization of actin filaments that results from microbial-associated molecular patterns being recognized by the corresponding patternrecognition receptors 59 . Therefore, by downregulating this function, longer and more stable actin filaments are produced that virions use to move around the cell from the ER-associated replication factories to plasmodesmata. Other example is the repression observed for the UBP1B gene, a negative regulator of potyvirus translation, that would allow for a more optimal virus accumulation 60 . Genes involved in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) defenses 61 , such as the ATP-dependent RNA helicase UPF1, also show reduction in levels of expression. Other group of proteins that show alteration during viral infection are those involved in protein degradation, via ubiquitination and downstream into the proteasome pathway (e.g., ubiquitin-protein ligase 1, UPL1; ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2, UBC2; ubiquitin E2 variant 1B, MMZ2; EIN3-binding F box protein 1, EBF) or via autophagy (e.g., the ATP-driven chaperone CDC48C and the plant autophagy adaptor NBR1). Moreover, TEV activates in a fitness-dependent manner the expression of genes RH8, an RNA helicase, and PCaP1, a membrane-associated cation-binding protein, also required by potyviruses for cell-to-cell movement 62 (Fig. 8A) , and of a diversity of transcription factors including global (e.g., GRA2, GTE8), sequence-specific (e.g., SACL1 and SPL12), GATA/NAC family members (e.g., GATA1, NAC083, NAC029), bZIP G-box finding factors (e.g., GBF1 and BZIP63), and involved in homeotic gene expression (e.g., AGL20 and homeobox-1). We also found genes related to genome integrity, (e.g., the cohesins SYN2 and SMC3, and the chromatin protein SPT2), DNA replication and nucleosome assembly, alternative splicing (e.g., SF1, an homolog nuclear splicing factor), chromatin transition (e.g., SPT16, an histone chaperone involved in transcription elongation from RNApolII promoters and regulation of chromatin transitions; or the histone acetyltransferase HAC1, a coactivator of gene transcription with a major role in controlling flowering time and also essential for resistance to bacterial infections), DNA replication and cell division (e.g., the mitotic cohesin RAD21 and the cyclin-dependent protein kinase CYCH1). However, not all host factors recruited by the virus present alterations in their expressions. According to our data, the translation initiation factor eIF4E, known to be exploited by TEV for its own translation 63 , was found to be unperturbed (Fig.   8A ) whilst eIF3A and eIF4G expression positively correlated with TEV fitness.\n\nIn essence, there are genes that are significantly altered (up or down) upon infection irrespective of the ability of the virus to replicate, genes whose expression correlates with this ability (positively or negatively), and genes that remain unaltered. Nevertheless, this picture of virus-plant interaction may be biased by the limited number of viral genotypes analyzed in this work. Three out of six genotypes correspond to HC-Pro mutants. As a multifunctional protein, it is not surprising that different fitness levels can be reached by introducing mutations in different . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/206789 doi: bioRxiv preprint functional domains. But, certainly, more mutants should be analyzed in future work to provide a comprehensive picture, avoiding the bias towards certain virus proteins. In addition, we here focused on the transcription regulation, but other networks exist in the cell (e.g., metabolism, protein-protein interactions, \u2026), all them interlinked. To provide an insight on these other networks, we constructed the interactome (Fig. 8B) of HC-Pro with the host proteins known to interact with this virus protein 40 . We then contextualized our gene expression data over multiple TEV infections. Many of the cellular functions in which HC-Pro participate (protein degradation, translation, redox processes, and cation signaling) are not regulated transcriptionally upon infection (or regulated marginally). Presumably, the virus exploits these processes in its own benefit (mainly to enhance replication and movement within a cell), and the normal expression of the corresponding genes is sufficient for such subversion. By contrast, RNA silencing and methylation are functions involved in defense against pathogens that are quantitatively regulated, as a sort of control strategy exerted by the plant, as long as they are needed, that is, according to viral fitness.\n\nBiological systems and processes can be analyzed and modeled at every scale of complexity. It is expected that components of each level of complexity may contribute to determine the behavior of processes at other levels. The complexity at the molecular level (i.e., the lowest level of biological organization) is astonishing both in terms of possible elements (genes, functional RNAs, proteins, and metabolites) and of interactions among them 24 . Thus, if the components at lower scales of complexity, presumed to be more accessible experimentally, are informative enough about the underlying processes, they result in excellent proxies to rationalize biological systems. In the case of a disease (in plants or animals), the symptoms exhibited by the organism have been traditionally used as macroscopic indicators of what occurred within the organism.\n\nThis allows diagnosing diseases without the need to performing further inspections. However, symptoms are generally uncoupled from the magnitude of the perturbation at the molecular level in the host (with respect to a healthy state) 24, 25 . This is particularly true in the case of a virusinduced disease, a paradigmatic example of a system-wise perturbation [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . adapted to their local host ecotype than to any alternative one, but with viruses evolved into more restrictive ecotypes being more generalists that viruses evolved in the more permissive ones 65 .\n\nInterestingly, these differences in fitness had a parallelism with differences in the transcriptomic profiles of plants from different ecotypes; the more generalist viruses altering similar genes in every ecotype, while the more specialist viruses altered different genes in different ecotypes 66 .\n\nSimilarly, A. thaliana plants infected either with a mild or a virulent isolate of turnip mosaic potyvirus (TuMV) also showed profound differences in the genes and functional categories altered 67 . In this case, the more virulent strain mainly altered stress responses and transport functions compared to the mild one 67 . In a recent study, the transcriptomic alterations induced in Nicotiana benthamiana plants infected either with a wild-type tobacco vein banding mosaic potyvirus (TVBMV) or a genotype deficient in VSR protein HC-Pro were compared 68 . Both transcriptomes differed in many aspects, including repression of photosynthesis-related genes, . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Our observation that viral fitness indeed correlates positively or negatively with the expression of certain genes is of particular interest. By simply measuring the fitness of the virus infecting a given host, we may predict the whole genomic profile of the host cell to characterize its state (molecular impact of infection). Moreover, by specifically targeting host genes that are essential for high fitness virus variants but not for milder ones, we may prevent the spreading of the former variants, while still allowing mild variants to replicate and, perhaps, act as attenuated vaccines that enhance the antiviral response of the plant.\n\n.

The infectious clone pMTEV contains a full copy of the genome of a WT TEV strain isolated from tobacco ( Fig. 1A ; GenBank accession DQ986288) 69 . Six TEV mutant genotypes were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis starting from template plasmid pMTEV as described in ref. 70 (mutants AS13, CLA2 and CLA11) and ref. 32 (mutants PC48, PC55 and PC95).

RNA extraction from 100 mg of fresh tissue per plant was performed using Agilent Plant RNA Isolation Mini Kit (Agilent Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of total plant RNA extract was adjusted to 50 ng/\u00b5L for each sample. Each RNA sample was re-sequenced again at this stage to ensure the constancy of the genotypes as described above. Fitness evaluations. Total RNA was extracted and virus accumulation quantified by RT-qPCR as described above and detailed previously 72 . Virus accumulation (expressed as genomes/ng of total RNA) was quantified 8 dpi for all genotypes with the exception of AS13, that was quantified 15 dpi. These sampling times assure that viral populations were at a quasi-stationary plateau in N. tabacum. These values were then used to compute the fitness of the mutant genotypes relative to that of the WT genotype using the expression W = (R t \u2044R 0 ) 1/t , where R 0 and R t are the ratios of accumulations estimated for the mutant and WT viruses at inoculation and after t days of growth, respectively 32 .\n\nRelative fitness data were fitted to a generalized linear model (GLM) with Normal distribution and an identity link function. Virus genotypes and plant replicates were treated as random factors, with the second factor nested within the first one. Three technical replicates of the RT-qPCR were used to evaluate the magnitude of the error term in the model. This statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS version 23.\n\nMicroarray hybridizations. Total RNA was isolated as described above and its integrity assessed using a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent) before and after hybridization.

To identify the genes shown in Fig. 3A , the test was done over all samples, including the control. By contrast, to identify the genes shown in Fig. 6A , the test was done over all samples corresponding to infections with distinct TEV genotypes. An additional criterion of significant Spearman's correlation between mean fitness and mean expression (P < 0.05) was imposed in this latter case.

Sequences not returning a significant BLAST hit were removed from the output. A total of 40,430 annotated probes were generated. In 2,673 cases, more than one probe pointed to the same N. tabacum gene (e.g., probes A_95_P217927 and A_95_P046006 were both complementary to gene EB438730), and in those cases the target appeared twice in the output.\n\nEach one of the hits could be associated to an alternatively spliced mature mRNA in the SGN database.

Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg of fresh tissue of plants infected with each one of the seven TEV genotypes as described above. The concentration of total plant RNA was adjusted to 50 ng/\u00b5L. Nine candidate genes were selected to validate the effect of infection with each TEV genotype on their expression.
