{"title": "Supplementary Information Differential innate immune response programs in neuronal subtypes determine susceptibility to infection in the brain by positive stranded RNA viruses", "body": "*Genes selected for cloning and expression in neurons. \n\nIn situ hybridization. Brain tissues were harvested from na\u00efve mice, and differential RNA expression was visualized by the QuantiGene View RNA in situ hybridization tissue assay (Affymetrix)\n\naccording to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were permeabilized, gene-specific probes (Ifi27, Irg1, Stat1, Ubc (positive control), and E.Coli Dapb (negative control)) were hybridized, and the signal was amplified by sequential hybridization of amplifier (branched DNA). Target mRNAs were visualized by confocal microscopy after addition of the Fast Red substrate.\n\nwere determined using an encephalomyocarditis virus L929 cell cytopathic effect bioassay as described previously 1 .\n\nand Stat1 -/-GCN in Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 5% (v/v) \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed using antibodies against Stat1 (Cell Signaling), \u03b2actin (Abcam), and Rsad2/Viperin (MaP.VIP 2 ).\n\nQuantification of tissue viral burden. Infected brain tissues were harvested after extensive perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), weighed, homogenized, and virus titers were determined by standard plaque assay on BHK21-15 cells 3 ."}
