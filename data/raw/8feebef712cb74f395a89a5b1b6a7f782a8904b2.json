The relative enzymatic activities of Previously, we identified a net \u03e91 translational recoding \u2424-galactosidase and luciferase reflect the frameshifting event within the tk gene from an ACV-resistant HSV efficiency. To normalize this efficiency, we constructed mutant (Hwang et al., 1994) . Because this recoding event two control plasmids.

Therefore, HSV sequences upstream of this termination codon were deleted, creating pBCH2a. This plasmid, containing 46 nt of HSV sequence, could direct frameshifting at standard levels ( Figure 1) . A further 5\u0408 deletion of 30 nt yielded plasmid BCH4. The 16 nt of HSV sequence contained within this plasmid was sufficient to promote frameshifting at standard levels. However, a control plasmid, BCH4a, which contained 16 nt of a randomly generated sequence, did not frameshift (Figure 1) . To narrow the minimal signal for frameshifting, we deleted either 3 or 6 nt from the 3\u0408 or 5\u0408 end of the 16 nt HSV sequence, creating plasmids BCH5, BCH7, BCH6, and BCH8, respectively ( Figure 1 ). Deletions from the 3\u0408 end had no effect on frameshift efficiency, whereas 5\u0408 deletions abolished frameshifting. Therefore, these results indicate that the sequence G(8)AG is suffi- Figure 2 .

We therefore consider corrected values of greater than or equal to 0.2% as meaningful.\n\nout in the examples examined thus far (Somogyi et al., from the 44 kDa marker was due to methonine labeling of an endogenous reticulocyte polypeptide]). In contrast, a control plasmid, pPS1a (Somogyi et al., 1993 ; a gift of I. Brierley), which contains a coronavirus pseudoknot, produced a paused product of the expected size, 42 kDa (data not shown). However, as the sensitivity of these assays was limited, we cannot totally discount the possibility that a very low level pause occurs at the HSV recoding site. Nevertheless, in contrast to results obtained in other translational recoding systems, there was no observable detectable pause associated with the HSV recoding event, nor was recoding stimulated by a downstream structure believed to act by pausing ribosomes.\n\nAs the sequence defined by deletion analysis was highly G-rich, we wished to assess the importance of monotonous runs of G's (G-strings) in net \u03e91 frameshifting.\n\nReplacing the G(8)AG motif of BCH4 with A(8)AG abolished frameshifting (Figure 1 ), indicating a requirement for G's rather than for any purines. We lengthened the run of G's from 8 in BCH4 to 11 (BCH14) or shortened These results suggest that the recoding event occurs as ribosomes encounter the run of G's. Thus far, however, all attempts to determine the site of recoding by 1993; Tu et al., 1992) . Given the lack of effect of the HIV protein sequencing have failed, primarily due to low stimulator, we asked whether paused ribosomes could frameshift efficiency (B. C. H. and S. Matusfuji, unpubbe detected during recoding in the HSV tk system, using lished data). Therefore, we decided to use site-directed the translational inhibitor edeine (Somogyi et al., 1993) . mutagenesis to address this question. In an initial at-Briefly, ribosomes were allowed to initiate on mRNA in tempt to define the site of frameshifting, we mutated the presence of 35 S methionine.

The efficiency of frameshifting is generally con-into the \u03e91 reading frame (Hwang et al., 1994 ; this study). We have found that a specific G-rich signal embedded sidered to depend on the extent of pausing, and, in particular, weakly functioning recoding sites are most within the tk mRNA corrupts the translational machinery. The ability of sequences to induce recoding correlates affected by the presence of stimulators. We failed to detect paused ribosomes at the HSV tk recoding site well with their ability to form unusual RNA structures. We discuss below in what way this recoding event differs ( Figure 3B ), suggesting that the HSV frameshift does not involve a kinetically slower second step. Given the from previously described translational frameshifts, possible mechanisms to explain the correlation between low efficiency of the tk frameshift, it could be argued that the pause was too short for us to detect. Nevertheless, if RNA structure and recoding, and the potential relevance of our results to herpesviruses and other biological pausing were important for the tk frameshift, one would expect that stimulators would greatly increase frame-systems.\n\nOur mutational analysis is consistent with net \u03e91 re-shift efficiency. Instead, neither a downstream RNA structure nor termination codons increased frameshift coding occurring within the G-string (Figure 1 ; data not shown) but is not definitive. Unfortunately, due to the efficiency. Thus, it appears that the tk frameshift operates via a mechanism that does not entail a kinetically low efficiency of recoding, it has not yet been possible to determine by protein sequencing whether the net \u03e91 slow step that is enhanced by ribosomal pausing. BCHH3 and BCHH4 (the oligonucleotide used to create these mutant was synthesized as a mixture, i.e., tcgaGGRGGRGGAGGCTGGG, where R equals pyrimidine). The right panel shows an autoradiogram of a polyacrylamide gel of the corresponding 32 P-labeled oligonucleotides, run as described in (A). As above, F and S indicate the faster-moving and slowermoving species, respectively.\n\nMoreover, it has been argued that tRNAs should not slip on G-strings because of the predicted strength of Conventional \u03e91 frameshifting utilizing slippage is exemplified by the frameshift in the overlap between the the mRNA-tRNA interactions (Jacks et al., 1988) . Indeed, replacement of A-or U-rich codons with G-or C-rich TYA and TYB genes in the retrotransposon ty1 (Belcourt and Farabaugh, 1990; Farabaugh, 1996) . The frameshift triplets reduced frameshifting in \u03ea1 frameshift systems that utilize slippage (Brierley et al., 1992 ; Jacks et al., requires a 7 nt sequence, CUU AGG C, and occurs by slippage of the P-site tRNA from CUU to UUA. This slip 1988), and replacement of third position U's in the inphase triplet decreased frameshifting in a \u03e91 system, is stimulated by a translational pause induced by the slowly decoded hungry codon AGG in the A site. The suggesting that the weakness of wobble pairs facilitates \u03e91 slippage (Curran, 1993) . One might imagine a sce-frameshift requires no other factors.\n\nIf the HSV frameshift were conventional, then its P-site nario whereby the mRNA G-string interacts, for example, with rRNA (see below) in a way that might promote tRNA codons could be GGG or GGA. Given either of these P-site codons, we analyzed several A-site codons that slippage. For example, if the G-string formed non-Watson-Crick base pairs with rRNA, that would weaken could permit \u03e91 slippage while maintaining base pairing at at least two out of three codon-anticodon positions the hydrogen bonds between the O 6 positions of G's in the codon and C's in the anticodon. It would be tempting (UAG [BCH21], UGA [BCH20], GGA [gly; BCH6], GGG [gly; BCH13], and GAG [glu; BCH18]) when placed down-to speculate that the weakening of these bonds could add to the slipperiness of the mRNA-tRNA complex. stream of a single GGG or GGA codon. Of these, UAG and UGA are nonsense codons and are, in general, more However, for this scenario to be viable, we would expect that an A string would also promote net \u03e91 frameshift-slowly decoded than sense codons. (These nonsense codons operated efficiently in the antizyme frameshift ing, since A-U base pairs have even less energy than the weakened G-C base pairs imagined above. This system, which, like the HSV frameshift system, has been characterized in a mammalian system [Matsufuji et al., did not occur (BCH 11; Figure 1) . Moreover, this model would predict that an RNA structure or termination co-1995]). GGA is an intermediately used codon, and GGG and GAG are very commonly used (\"well-fed\") codons don that enhanced the probability of the second, kinetically slower, slip would increase the efficiency of frame- (Haas et al., 1996) . Thus, if the HSV frameshift were conventional, we would expect higher frameshift effi-shifting, which did not occur. Thus, it is difficult to consider slippage on G-strings as a viable explanation ciencies with A-site codons UAG and UGA, intermediate frameshift efficiencies with GGA codons, and lower for our results. Furthermore, although tRNA GLY UCC will form base pairs at frameshift efficiencies with GGG and GAG codons. This was not observed. Instead, only the well-fed A-site co-positions one and three with the \u03e91 codon, GAG in BCH12, the U:G wobble base pair is relatively weak at dons promoted frameshifting, whereas slowly decoded A-site codons did not (e.g., compare BCH18 and codon position 3 while the clashing middle base pair (A:C) in the slipped codon-anticodon complex should BCH21). Thus, the HSV frameshift is not conventional. result in destabilization. Grosjean and co-workers (1978) demonstrated that centrally positioned C:A or A:C pairs abolished synthetic anticodon-codon complexes. Such mismatches decrease frameshifting more than 80-fold in the \u03e91 E. coli RF2 system (Curran, 1993) , compared with the only 3-fold decrease in the HSV tk frameshift (BCH12, Figure 1) . Thus, the ability of BCH12 to frameshift is very difficult to explain by either conventional slippage or by the unconventional mechanism considered above. Taken together, our results argue that tRNA slippage is highly unlikely to account for the HSV recoding event.\n\nA second mechanism for frameshifting involves specific peptidyl tRNAs, which are thought to facilitate out-offrame binding of tRNAs at the A site (Farabaugh et al., 1993; Matsufuji et al., 1995; Pande et al., 1995; Vimaladithan and Farabaugh, 1994) . In our case, this would implicate tRNA GLY CCC and tRNA GLY UCC as responsible for the frameshift when they occupy the P site. In yeast, GGG codons in the P site can induce frameshifting but only ity that a subpopulation of glycine tRNAs contain 4 nt anticodons and therefore function as \u03e91 frameshift suppressors.\n\nHowever, as pointed out by Farabaugh et al. (1993) , In summary, the tk recoding event appears to function who considered a similar model to explain the TY3 \u03e91 with the same efficiency with or without a stimulator frameshift, it is more likely that such an excluded base and in the absence of detectable pausing (Figures 1-3) .\n\nwould still stack between the paired nucleotides on ei-It does not behave as if it utilizes slippage or peptidylther side.

Rev Responsive Element RNA bound to Rev peptide For example, HSV-1 tk genes contain one G(6) and one (Battiste et al., 1994) . In this structure, purine-purine G(7) string, and HSV-2 tk genes contain two G(6) and base pairs form within an internal loop of a helix to create one G(7) string. It has been suggested that the high a quasi-continous helix with the concomitant bulging of mutation frequency in the tk gene of HSV may be a bases (Battiste et al., 1994) .\n\nconsequence of these guanine repeats (Kit et al., 1987) , In our third model, a non-Watson-Crick base-paired and, indeed, Hwang and Chen (1995) have obtained structure forms within the ribosome, distorting the riboevidence that frameshift mutations can occur frequently somal A site, thus favoring binding of tRNA to the mRNA in the G(7) string.
