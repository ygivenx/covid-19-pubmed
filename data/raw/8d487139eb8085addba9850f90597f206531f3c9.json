To perform fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, vimentin and ROP18 cDNA fragments were inserted into the SalI/SacII sites of the plasmids pEYFP-N1 and pECFP-C1, respectively. Vimentin-HA and ROP18-3\u00d7flag were cloned into pcDNA3.1 (+) digested with HindIII/BamHI.\n\nTo disrupt the rop18 gene in the RH strain, a CRISPR plasmid, pSAG1::CAS9-U6::sgROP18, was generated by replacing the UPRT targeting gRNA in pSAG1::CAS9-U6::sgUPRT [1] with a specific rop18 targeting gRNA sequence, by Q5 DNA polymerase mutagenesis (NEB). A homologous template (pBlue-5'-3'-ROP18-homo-DHFR-TS) was also generated to promote efficient recombinant insertion of the DHFR-TS cassette into the rop18 locus and disrupt the expression of rop18. To generate this homologous template, 5\u2032-homo, 3\u2032-homo, and DHFR-TS cassette were amplified using RH genomic DNA and plasmid pYFP-LIC-DHFR (Addgene, 83114), respectively as templates, using the primers indicated in Table S2 . Briefly, a 990bp fragment homologous to the sequence upstream of the gRNA target rop18 gene was cloned into the HindIII/EcoRV sites of the pBlue-script SK II (-) plasmid to generate pBlue-5\u2032-ROP18-homo, and an 850bp fragment homologous to the downstream of the gRNA target rop18gene was then cloned into the BamHI/XbaI sites of pBlue-5\u2032-ROP18-homo to form pBlue-5\u2032-3\u2032-ROP18-homo. Next, a DHFR-TS cassette was cloned into the EcoRV/BamHI sites of the pBlue-5\u2032-3\u2032-ROP18-homo plasmid to form a recombinant plasmid which was used for electrotransformation of tachyzoites.\n\nTo generate the recombinant RH strain expressing C-terminally eGFP-FLAG-tagged ROP18, a CRISPR plasmid, pSAG1::CAS9-U6::sgROP18-in, expressing an sgRNA targeting downstream of the TAA stop codon of the rop18 gene was first generated. Second, a recombinant plasmid containing homologous template for the eGFP-FLAG fusion expression at the C-terminus of ROP18 and insertion of a DHFR-TS cassette was generated. To construct this plasmid, fragments of the 5\u2032-homo-in, 3\u2032-homo-in, and DHFR-TS cassette were amplified from genomic DNA of RH strain and pYFP-LIC-DHFR, eGFP, and SAG1-3\u2032-UTR plasmids were amplified using pSAG1::CAS9-U6::sgUPRT as template;\n\nall primers are provided in Table S2 . In brief, a 996bp fragment (5\u2032 flanking region) homologous to the sequence upstream of the rop18 stop codon (TAA), a 1038bp fragment (3\u2032 flanking region) homologous to sequence downstream of the rop18 sgRNA target site, eGFP, SAG1-3\u2032-UTR, and the DHFR-TS cassette were amplified and inserted into pBluescript II SK(-), using NEBuilder \u00ae HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB, E5520).\n\nTo generate the pBlue-p24-eGFP-DHFR-TS plasmid, the p24 promoter was amplified from RH strain parasites and eGFP-SAG1-3\u2032-UTR and DHFR-TS were amplified using the templates described above with the primers indicated in Table S2 . Briefly, p24 promoter, eGFP-SAG1-3\u2032-UTR, and DHFR-TS fragments were cloned into the ApaI/BamHI, BamHI/SpeI and XbaI/NotI sites of the plasmid pBluescript II SK(-), respectively. The recombinant plasmid was then linearized with ApaI prior to transfection into parasites, to generate a strain ectopically expressing GFP, RH/GFP.\n\nCos7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and 3 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA per well were used for transfection with Lipofectamine \u00ae 2000 (Invitrogen, 11668019), following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. For transfection of cells in T-75 culture flasks and 12-well plates, 18\u03bcg or 1\u03bcg (per well), respectively, of plasmid DNA were used.\n\nThree vimentin specific siRNAs, VIMHSS111286 (siRNA1), VIMHSS111287 (siRNA2), and VIMHSS187671 (siRNA3) (Invitrogen), and a negative control siRNA (12935-300, Invitrogen) were transfected into HFF cells using Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 reagent following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Information of used siRNAs was shown in Table S3 . Before transfection, red fluorescent control siRNA (Invitrogen, 14750100) was used to optimize the transfection conditions and 90pmol/well (3\u03bcl/well) Lipofectamine \u00ae 2000 was used in subsequent experiments. After siRNA transfection for different periods of time (1, 2, 3, 5, and 7d) , cells were collected to extract total RNA and protein to identify the transcription and expression levels of vimentin. After evaluation by qRT-PCR and western blotting, the most efficient siRNA (siRNA2) was chosen for use in subsequent experiments."}
