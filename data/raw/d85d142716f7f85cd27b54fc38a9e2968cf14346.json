The potential impact and optimal timing of city-wide social distancing interventions to reduce the spread of influenza and other respiratory viruses are largely unknown. Most estimates of social distancing impact are limited to studies of school closures, including both routine holiday closures and reactive closures due to influenza epidemics. School closures may reduce rates of medically-attended influenza in school-aged children, although with highly heterogeneous effects (2% to 29% reductions), and with lesser effects on younger children and adults. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Generalizing to broader social distancing efforts from these studies is difficult, however, as school closures tend to have limited impacts on working-age and older adults, and school-aged children may recongregate outside of schools. 4, [6] [7] [8] In February 2019, unusually high snowfall in western Washington State led to widespread school and workplace closures and to reduced regional travel. This disruption of work and travel can be considered a proxy for social distancing that might accompany community-wide social mobility restrictions in the event of a pandemic. The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of this weather-created social distancing on transmission of respiratory viruses in the greater Seattle metropolitan area.\n\nThe Seattle Flu Study, initiated during the 2018/19 influenza season, is a multi-armed regional surveillance project which aims to evaluate the transmission of influenza and other respiratory pathogens at a city-wide scale 9 . During the 2018/19 influenza season, surveillance occurred at a variety of settings in the greater Seattle metropolitan area. The main surveillance arms of the Seattle Flu Study were:\n\n\u2022 prospective enrollment of community members with acute respiratory illness (ARI) through standalone kiosks at university campuses, airports, workplaces, homeless shelters, and high-traffic tourist areas;\n\n\u2022 prospective enrollment of ambulatory care patients with acute respiratory illness; \u2022 active surveillance for ARI in a cohort of children enrolled in daycare centers; \u2022 collection and molecular testing of residual specimens from patients evaluated at regional hospitals for ARI. For this analysis, we focus on data from the residual specimen testing as that provided 86% of samples (9, 199 of 10,696) and with the broadest regional population representation.\n\nNucleic acids extracted from respiratory swab specimens from study participants were screened for the presence of multiple respiratory pathogens by reverse-transcription and Taqman. Screened pathogens included influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B; human coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1) (hCoV); human metapneumovirus (hMPV); rhinovirus (HRV), and adenovirus (AdV).\n\nUnusually heavy snowfall occurred in the greater Seattle metropolitan area between Feb 3 and Feb 11 2019, totalling 20.2 inches at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport over this time ( Figure 1 ). The majority of public schools in the region were closed for at least five days, with a weekend in between. Traffic volumes on major interstate highways in the greater Seattle area ranged between 24% and 90% (mean, 63%) of average daily volume during the 12 day period from Feb 3 to Feb 15, 2019. 10 Admissions to Harborview Medical Center, University of Washington Medical Center, and Northwest Hospital ranged from 72% to 99% (mean, 90%) of average daily volume over this same period. City of Seattle public preschools were closed from Feb 9 through Feb 13, and King County public transportation was on emergency service from Feb 9 through Feb 12.

The transient weather-related decrease in effective contact rates ranged from 16.2% (95% CI, 7.1-24.2%) for coronavirus to 94.6% (95% CI, 70.7-100%) for RSV A (Table  1 ). 5 .

The percent of infections averted ranged from 3.0% (95% CI, 2.0-3.7%) for human metapneumovirus to 9.2% (95% CI, 6.2-10.3%) for RSV B (Table 1) . Comparing the pathogens with the highest incidence, influenza A/H1N1 and influenza A/H3N2, we observed that the weather-related disruption occurred shortly before the predicted peak of the influenza A/H1N1 epidemic but early in the course of the influenza A/H3N2 epidemic (Figure 3) . The estimated impact of the disruption was significantly greater for A/H1N1 (7.6% of infections averted, 95% CI, 5.2-8.7%) than for A/H3N2 (3.1% averted, 95% CI, 2.5-3.2%). For A/H1N1, the weather-related transmission disruption appears to have reduced incidence without significant rebound, while the main effect on A/H3N2 was to delay the peak in incidence by an estimated 18 days (95% CI, 17-21 days).\n\n7 .

Figure 3 : Effect of weather-related disruption on incidence. Percentage of the population infected over time for the best fit model (gray) and assuming no weather-related disruption in contact patterns (colored). The solid and dashed black lines mark the beginning and end of weather-related social distancing.\n\nTo characterize the effect of the timing of social distancing on epidemic incidence, we simulated the incidence of influenza A/H3N2 without any weather-related disruption, and with a 14-day disruption starting between day 20 and day 80 of the epidemic (Figure 4 ). In the absence of any disruption, the epidemic is predicted to peak on day 67. Early in the course of the epidemic, a 14-day disruption, by itself, has little effect on the final epidemic size. In contrast, disruptions at or near the peak can meaningfully reduce peak incidence. For example, a disruption starting on day 65 reduced total incidence by 16% in these simulations. 8 .

Although there is heterogeneity in the specific form of social distancing modeled, most of the studies have assumed that social distancing measures are initiated early in the course of a pandemic. These studies consistently suggest that such social distancing can delay the timing and intensity of the pandemic peak, but with little impact on the final attack rate of the pandemic. Our observations support these findings. The extreme snowfall of February 2019 occurred early in the seasonal epidemics of influenza A/H3N2 and hMPV, and we estimate that the final attack rates of these viruses only decreased by 3% and the peaks only shifted by 18 or 15 days, respectively.\n\nIn contrast, the extreme snowfall occurred close to the predicted peak of the seasonal epidemics of several other viruses, particularly influenza A/H1N1 and RSV. For these viruses, weather-related social distancing had larger impacts, with final attack rates reduced by 7.6% to 9.2% and prevalence remaining below the pre-disruption level for 9 .

This finding suggests that short-term social distancing is most effective at reducing overall attack rates when it occurs close to the peak of the epidemic, or equivalently when force of infection is greatest.\n\nBecause it is unlikely that traffic and school closure data fully capture the changes in population contacts due to extreme snowfall, we did not attempt to parse the relative impacts of specific changes on routes of transmission. However, we did observe that decreases in effective contact rates were negatively correlated with the fraction of subjects 18 years of age or older for each pathogen ( R 2 = -0.65, p =0.06). As reductions in effective contact rates were greatest for viruses impacting the youngest, this suggests that weather-related school closures may have had a greater effect on contact frequencies among children than commuting and workplace disruptions among adults.\n\nSimulation studies to estimate the impact of social distancing on an influenza pandemic [11] [12] [13] [14] have generally assumed that social distancing is implemented early in the pandemic and maintained until the end of the pandemic, a period of many months. The feasibility of such long-term interventions is unclear. In contrast, the widespread school and travel disruptions resulting from snowfall in Feb 2019 serve as a proxy for a more realistic high-intensity, short-duration social distancing intervention, where schools and workplaces are closed and re-congregation is discouraged for approximately two weeks. Our study suggests that such an intervention could be beneficial in reducing the total incidence if implemented near the peak of a pandemic.\n\nWe modeled each pathogen with a deterministic SEIR transmission model coupled to a simple observation model:\n\n, and I are the proportion of the population that is susceptible, infected but not yet infectious, and infectious, respectively. \u03b2 is the effective contact rate, \u03c3 is the rate of movement from pre-infectious to infectious ,and \u03b3 is the rate of loss of infectiousness. The \u03b2 ' is the strength of the interruption to disease transmission during the extreme weather event, which operates on a square pulse \u03b8 t between times t start and t end . In the observation model, H is the number of observed infections, p is the convolution of sampling probability and population size. The \u03b1 parameter is the strength of the interruption of observation during the extreme weather event, which is assumed to be -10% based on hospital visit data (Figure 1 ).\n\n.
