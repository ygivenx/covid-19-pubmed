{"title": "Fused-ring structure of decahydroisoquinolin as a novel scaffold for SARS 3CL protease inhibitors", "body": "Although the primary epidemic of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) 1-3 affecting about 8500 patients and 800 dead was eventually brought under control, the recent identification of a SARS CoV (coronavirus)-like virus in Chinese bats 4, 5 and of a novel coronavirus MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus, previously known as human CoV-EMC) raise the possibility of a reemergence of SARS or related diseases. 6, 7 Since no effective therapy exists for these viral infections, developing anti-SARS agents against future outbreaks remains a formidable challenge.\n\nSARS is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus featuring the largest known viral RNA which produces two large proteins with overlapping sequences, polyproteins 1a ($450 kDa) and 1ab ($750 kDa). 8-10 SARS 3CL (chymotrypsin like) protease (3CL pro ) is a key enzyme to cleave the polyproteins to yield functional polypeptides. 11, 12 The 3CL pro is a cysteine protease containing a Cys-His catalytic dyad and it exists as a homodimer; each monomer contains the catalytic dyad at each active site. Due to its functional importance in the viral life cycle, 3CL pro is considered an attractive target for the structure-based design of drugs against SARS. Thus, numerous inhibitors of 3CL pro have been reported including peptide-mimics [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] and small molecules derived from natural products, [18] [19] [20] anti-viral agents, 21, 22 anti-malaria agents, 23 or high throughput screening. [24] [25] [26] [27] In the course of our own studies on the SARS 3CL pro and its inhibitors, 28 we found that the addition of an extra sequence to the N-or C-terminus of the mature SARS 3CL pro lowered the catalytic activity and that the mature SARS 3CL pro is sensitive to degradation at the 188Arg/189Gln site, which causes a loss of catalytic activity. The stability of 3CL pro is dramatically increased by mutating the Arg at the 188 position to Ile. The enzymatic efficiency of the R188I mutant was increased by a factor of more than 1 \u00c2 10 6 . The potency of the mutant protease makes it possible to quantitatively evaluate substrate-based peptide-mimetic inhibitors easily by conventional HPLC using a substrate peptide containing no fluorescence derivatives. The evaluations revealed that a peptide aldehyde covering the P-site sequence of substrate, Ac-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-NHCH(CH 2 CH 2 CON(CH 3 ) 2 )-CHO, inhibits the SARS 3CL pro with an IC 50 value of 37 lM. Systematic modification guided by the X-ray crystal structure of a series of peptide-mimics in a complex with R188I SARS 3CL pro resulted in 1 with an IC 50 value of 98 nM (Fig. 1) . 13 All of the side-chain structures of 1 differed from the substrate sequence except at the P 3 site, where the side-chain was directed outward. Kinetic inhibition data for 1 obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plots suggested that inhibitors containing an aldehyde at the C-terminus can be expected to function as competitive inhibitors.\n\nIn the present study, we designed a novel non-peptide inhibitor focusing on the interactions at the S 1 and S 2 sites of the 3CL pro Confirmed to be critical to make the 1 potent competitive inhibitor. Among the key interactions clarified by X-ray crystallographic study, we focused on hydrophobic interactions at the cyclohexyl side-chain to design a novel inhibitor scaffold. Thus, the cyclohexyl ring is connected to the main-chain at an a-nitrogen atom of the P 2 position Cha (cyclohexylalanine) via a methylene linker to yield compound 2 (Fig. 1) . The resulting decahydroisoquinolin scaffold of 2 is expected to keep the hydrophobic interactions at the cyclohexyl ring of the substrate-based inhibitor at the S 2 pocket. In addition, the resulting decahydroisoquinolin scaffold arranges the P 1 site imidazole and active site functional aldehyde at each required position, giving the fused-ring structure of decahydroisoquinolin as a scaffold for a novel inhibitor. The acyl substituent on the nitrogen in the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold may add an extra position for the interactions with the 3CL pro .\n\nThe retro synthetic route for the desired decahydroisoquinolin derivative 2 is shown in Scheme 1. The P 1 site His derivative could be introduced by a reductive amination reaction using an aldehyde derivative prepared by oxidative cleavage of the olefin bond of 3. The trans-decahydroisoquinolin scaffold of 3 could be constructed via Pd-mediated stereoselective intra-molecular cyclization 29 by nucleophilic attack of a nitrogen atom to the Pd-activated olefin moiety of an allyl alcohol of 4. The olefin structure of 4 could be constructed by a Horner-Emmons reaction utilizing an aldehyde of precursor 5, and the amino group of 4 could be introduced by a Mitsunobu reaction to the alcohol of 5. The six-membered ring structure of 5 could be constructed by a Diels-Alder reaction of known ester 6 30 with butadiene.\n\nThus, the key intermediates 12 and 13, a precursor of the Pdmediated cyclization, were prepared according to the route shown in Scheme 2. The known ester 6 was first reacted with butadiene to construct the six-membered ring structure to yield 7 as an enantiomer mixture of 1,6-trans-substituted cyclohexene. The product was reduced with LAH and the resulting alcohol was then protected as tert-butyldiphenylsilyl ether to give 8. The benzyl group was removed by catalytic hydrogenation, which reduced the cyclohexene to cyclohexane at the same time. The resulting hydroxyl group was then oxidized with PCC and the resulting aldehyde was then reacted with (EtO) 2 P(O)CH 2 COOEt to yield 9. The ethyl ester of 9 was reduced with DIBALH and the resulting alcohol was protected as acetyl ester to give 10. After treatment with TBAF, the resulting alcohol was converted to the azide derivative 11 by a Mitsunobu reaction. Since the product 11 was rather unstable, 11 was immediately reduced to the corresponding amine. Without further purification, the amine derivative was coupled with p-phenylbenzoic acid using HBTU to yield 12 as an enantiomer mixture. Coupling with p-bromobenzoic acid was similarly conducted to yield a related derivative 13.\n\nConstruction of the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold was achieved as shown in Scheme 3. (CH 3 CN) 2 PdCl 2 -mediated cyclization of 12/ 13 gave the desired trans-decahydroisoquinolin derivative 14/15 as a major product. The product was an enantiomer mixture which was thought to have the relative configuration of 14/15 due to the cyclization through a less hindered Pd-chelated intermediate. Thus, the vinyl substituent of the product 14/15 was thought to be axial, which was clearly confirmed by X-ray crystallographic studies of the inhibitor in a complex with the R188I mutant SARS 3CL pro as discussed below. The olefin bond of 14/15 was oxidatively cleaved by the treatment with K 2 O s O 2 (OH) 4 followed by NaIO 4 to yield aldehyde 16/17. Reductive amination by H-His(Trt)-N(OCH 3 )-CH 3 gave the coupling products 18 and 20 or 19 and 21 as a 1:1 diastereomer mixture which was separable on a reversed-phase column (YMC Pack ODS) by analytical HPLC (Fig. S1 ). The diastereomers could also be separated by conventional silica-gel column chromatography to yield diastereomers 18 and 20 or 19 and 21, each having single peak on the above reversed-phase column. Each separated diastereomer was then treated with TFA to cleave the Trt group at the imidazole ring, and the product was reduced with DIBALH to yield the desired aldehyde 22/23 or 24/25. Although the absolute configuration of each product was not determined at this stage, the purity of each product was confirmed by analytical HPLC. Since moderate but clear inhibitory activities were observed in a preliminary evaluation on the inhibitory potency of 22 and 24, the identification of the stereo-structure was then conducted.\n\nTo separately prepare the above diastereomers and estimate the absolute configurations, cyclohexene carboxylic acid obtained by a Diels-Alder reaction was converted to a salt with (R)-or (S)-amethylbenzylamine and resolved according to the literature procedure for (1R/6S,1S/6R)-6-(2-bromophenyl)cyclohex-3-ene-1-carboxylic acid 26 31 (Scheme 4). Resolution of a carboxylic acid derived from compound 7 and compound 29 having the corresponding p-bromobenzyl group gave compounds showing the same polarimetric characters as the literature compounds. 31 (\u00c0) Carboxylic acid 27 or 30 was obtained by salt formation with (R)-a-methylbenzylamine and following salt-liberation with HCl, whereas the salt with (S)-a-methylbenzylamine gave (+) carboxylic acid 28 or 31. Compared with the literature values, these results strongly suggest that 27 and 30 would have (1R,6S) and 28 and 31 would have (1S,6R) absolute configurations. Optical purity of each enantiomer was further confirmed using a chiral column (YMC CHIRAL Amylose-C) by HPLC (Fig. S2 ). Since the chemical yield from the p-bromobenzyl derivative 29 was superior to the benzyl derivative 7, enantiomer 30 or 31 was used as the starting compound for the separate synthesis of decahydroisoquinolin diastereomers.\n\nThe separated (1S,6R) enantiomer 31 was then used to synthesize the corresponding decahydroisoquinolin diastereomer 40 or 41 using basically the same route as above (Scheme 5i). (1R,6S) Enantiomer 30 was also employed for the syntheses of diastereo- (Fig. S3) . The comparison was also conducted on 39 and 43 having a p-bromophenyl N-substituent with the corresponding diastereomers 19 and 21, and the same results as above were obtained (Fig. S4) . These results clearly demonstrated that the two diastereomers 18 and 20 were derived from the trans-decahydroisoquinolin structure constructed from enantiomer 7. Each protected diastereomer 38/39 and 42/43 thus synthesized was converted to the desired derivatives 40/41 and 44/45 without difficulty. Several analogs shown in Table 1 containing different Nacyl substituents of the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold were also prepared using the same synthetic route (Fig. S5 ).\n\nDigestion of the substrate peptide with R188I SARS 3CL pro in the presence of decahydroisoquinolin derivatives of different concentrations was conducted according to the published procedure. 13 The inhibitory activities were evaluated based on IC 50 values calculated from the decrease in the substrate digested by R188I SARS 3CL pro ; a typical sigmoidal curve used for estimation of the IC 50 value is shown in Figure S6 . As summarized in Table 1 , synthesized decahydroisoquinolin derivatives all showed inhibitory activities for the mutant 3CL pro . The results strongly suggest that the decahydroisoquinolin fused-ring can function as an inhibitor scaffold. Comparison of IC 50 values of trans-decahydroisoquinolin diastereomers in N-4-phenylbenzoyl derivatives (40 vs 44) or N-4-bromobenzoyl derivative (41 vs 45) clearly showed that the (4aR,8aS) isomer is more potent than (4aS,8aR) isomer. The results suggest the importance of the interaction at the S 2 pocket of the mutant 3CL pro . It was also demonstrated that a series of the N-benzoyl derivative was more potent than N-4-phenylbenzoyl derivatives. Substitution at the 4-position of the benzoyl substituent in 48 with halogen showed no significant effect on the inhibitory activity (41 and 49), whereas substitution at the 4-position of the phenyl group in the N-biphenylacyl derivative 40 gave a slightly more potent inhibitor than 2-or 3-substituted biphenyl derivatives (46 and 47). The results suggest that the substituent on the nitrogen atom of the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold may have some interactions with R188I SARS 3CL pro .\n\nTo clarify the interactions of a newly synthesized decahydroisoquinolin inhibitor with R188I SARS 3CL pro , the structure of the protease in a complex with the inhibitor was revealed by X-ray crystallography. Subsequently, a co-crystal of the inhibitor with 3CL pro was prepared and analyzed. Structures of the 3CL pro in a complex with inhibitors 40, 41, and 44 were refined to resolutions of 1.60 \u00c5, 2.42 \u00c5, and 1.89 \u00c5, respectively (PDB code 4TWY, 4TWW, and 4WY3). The data obtained are summarized in Table 2 .\n\nThe overall structure of the 3CL pro in complex with inhibitor 41\n\n(IC 50 = 63 lM) was first compared with the substrate-based inhibitor 1 (PDB code 3ATW) (Fig. 2) . Basically, the decahydroisoquinolin inhibitor 41 was at the active site cleft of the 3CL pro as observed in the highly potent inhibitor 1. The aldehyde group and imidazole ring of His-al, as well as the decahydroisoquinolin structure of 41, had an almost identical conformation with 1 and similarly interacted with 3CL pro . In contrast, the direction of the p-bromobenzoyl group was outward from 3CL pro and opposite to the P 3 to P 4 sites of 1. The N-p-bromobenzoyl group, however, was at the surface of 3CL pro , where additional hydrophobic interaction with Met of the 3CL pro may be possible (Fig. S7 ). The carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde group in 41 was detected at a distance of 2.43 \u00c5 from the active center thiol of Cys-145, and its electron density could be fitted to an sp 2 carbonyl carbon as in 1 (Fig. 3i) . The results suggest that the decahydroisoquinolin inhibitor would function as a competitive inhibitor as do the peptide-aldehyde inhibitor 1. 13 It was clearly confirmed that the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold of 41 took a trans-fused (4aR,8aS) configuration, as expected from the salt-resolution of enantiomixture 29. It was also confirmed that the P 1 His-al substituent on the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold took an axial-configuration, as expected from the Pd(II)-mediated cyclization. The decahydroiso-quinolin scaffold of 41 was inserted into a large S 2 pocket created by His-41, Met-49, Met-165, and Asp-187, as in the case of a parent peptide aldehyde inhibitor, and most of the S 2 pocket was occupied by the fused-ring structure of decahydroisoquinolin (Fig. 3i) . The nitrogen atom of the P 1 site imidazole of 41 formed a hydrogen bond with the imidazole nitrogen of His-163, resulting in close fitting at the other side of the S 1 pocket formed from the Phe-140, Leu-141, and Glu-166 side chains of the protease (Fig. 3ii ). These interactions, especially of the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold in the S 2 pocket, function to hold the P 1 site imidazole and terminal aldehyde tightly inside the active site cleft, which resulted in the compact fitting of the novel scaffold to the 3CL pro .\n\nTo evaluate the effects of absolute configuration of the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold, structures of the 3CL pro in complex with (4aR,8aS)-N-4-phenylbenzoyl decahydroisoquinolin inhibitor 40 and (4aS,8aR)-N-4-phenylbenzoyl decahydroisoquinolin inhibitor 44 were compared (Fig. 4i) . In both inhibitors, the P 1 site imidazole ring and the terminal aldehyde group had nearly the same interactions as in the (4aR,8aS)-N-bromobenzoyl decahydroisoquinolin inhibitor 41 described above. Due to the configuration change at the decahydroisoquinolin moiety, however, the (4aS,8aR) decahydroisoquinolin scaffold was clearly twisted compared to the (4aR,8aS) decahydroisoquinolin in the S 2 pocket (Fig. 4ii ). This conformation change of the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold transferred to the direction of the N-substituent. Thus, the substituent of (4aR,8aS) decahydroisoquinolin 40 took nearly the same conformation as the N-p-bromobenzoyl inhibitor 41 located on the surface of the 3CL pro , whereas the substituent of (4aS,8aR) decahydroisoquinolin directed outside from the protease surface. These conformational differences at the N-substituent, as well as the interactions at the S 2 pocket, explain the discrepancy in the inhibitory activity between (4aR,8aS) and (4aS,8aR) decahydroisoquinolin inhibitors (41 vs 44).\n\nA novel non-peptide inhibitor based on the interactions at the S 1 and S 2 sites of SARS 3CL pro was designed and synthesized. Focusing on cleavage site interaction at the S 1 site and hydrophobic interaction at the S 2 site, a decahydroisoquinolin scaffold was designed. Using a cyclohexene enantiomer obtained by salt resolution using chiral amine, the trans-decahydroisoquinolin derivative was synthesized as an enantiomer. Several analogs containing different N-substituents were also prepared similarly. All decahydroisoquinolin inhibitors showed moderate but clear inhibitory activities for SARS 3CL pro , which confirmed that the fused ring structure of the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold functions as an inhibitor for SARS 3CL pro . By X-ray crystallographic studies, it was confirmed that the decahydroisoquinolin inhibitors were at the active site cleft of 3CL pro , as observed in the highly potent peptide-aldehyde inhibitor. The decahydroisoquinolin scaffold was inserted into a large S 2 pocket and occupied most of the pocket. The P 1 site imidazole was inserted into the S 1 pocket as expected. These interactions were effective to hold the terminal aldehyde tightly inside the active site cleft, which resulted in the compact fitting of the novel scaffold to 3CL pro . The acyl substituent on the nitrogen in the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold was at the surface of the 3CL pro , where additional interactions with the 3CL pro may be possible. Evaluations on the analogs focusing on the interactions at the N-substituent are now underway.\n\nAll solvents were of reagent grade. THF was distilled from sodium and benzophenone ketyl. CH 2 Cl 2 was distilled from CaH 2 . All commercial reagents were of the highest purity available. Analytical TLC was performed on silica gel (60 F-254, 0.25 mm Plates).

The coupling constants are given in Hz. 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on the same spectrometers at 100 or 125 MHz, using the central resonance of CDCl 3 (d C 77.0 ppm) as the internal reference unless otherwise stated.

Optical rotations were determined with a HORIBA SEPA-300 polarimeter. Preparative HPLC was performed using a COSMOSIL 5C18-ARII column (20 \u00c2 250 mm) with a linear gradient of CH 3 CN in 0.1% aqueous TFA at a flow rate of 5.0 mL/min on a HITACHI LaChrom system (OD, 254 nm). For analytical HPLC, unless otherwise noted, a COS-MOSIL 5C18-ARII column (4.6 \u00c2 150 mm) was employed with a linear gradient of CH 3 CN in 0.1% aqueous TFA at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min on a HITACHI LaChrom system (OD, 254 nm).

Rigid body refinement and subsequent restrained refinement protocols were performed with the program Refmac 5 35 of the CCP package. 36 The Coot program 37 was used for manual model rebuilding. Water molecules were added using Coot only after the refinement of protein structures had converged. Ligands generated on JLigand 38 software were directly built into the corresponding difference in electron density, and the model was then subjected to an additional round of refinement. The figures for structural representation were generated on Pymol 39 or chimera 40 software.\n\n4TWY, 4TWW, and 4WY3."}
