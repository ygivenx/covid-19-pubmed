{"title": "Medical Microbiology and Immunology Reactivity of Antibodies in Human Serum with Antigens of an Enteropathogenic Bovine Coronavirus", "body": "Coronaviruses are an important cause of enteritis and diarrhea in piglets, calves, rodents, and other animal species [11] . Intestinal infections of man with cornaviruses were demonstrated repeatedly by electron microscopy, but the significance of this infection as a cause of human enteric disease remains unsettled [1, 2, 16] . Sharpe and Mebus [17] detected antibodies neutralizing infectivity of an enteropathogenic bovine coronavirus in sera of human subjects. Subsequently, antigenic relationships were found by direct and indirect immunofluorescence between the human coronavirus strain 0C43, an enteropathogenic bovine coronavirus, the type 3 mouse hepatitis virus, and the 67N hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine [ 13 ] . Kaye and coworkers postulated that the occurrence of antibodies to 67N in human sera may derive from heterologous antibody response during naturally occurring 0C43 infections [9] .\n\nSince human subjects may be exposed to enteropathogenic bovine coronavirus while caring for diarrheic calves, we investigated the reactivity of antibodies in human sera with antigens of an enteropathogenic bovine coronavirus. This report demonstrates evidence of antibodies against a bovine coronavirus in human sera that neutralized infectivity at a surprisingly high frequency, and it details the interactions of these antibodies with infected cells and viral structures.\n\nThe enteropathogenic bovine coronavirus strain L9 was used. It was originally isolated in bovine fetal kidney (BFK) cells from diarrhea fluid of a calf with enteritis [12] . It was adapted to bovine fetal thyroid (BFTy) cells for our investigations [ 18, 19] . Diarrhea fluid (10/26) was also available from a human subject who developed gastroenteritis while caring for calves experimentally infected with the bovine coronavirus strain LY-138 [4, 5 ] . This sample was collected on the fourth day after diarrhea began. The virus was partly purified from the human diarrhea fluid by differential and densitygradient centrifugation in sucrose, as described previously [5] .\n\nOne hundred serum samples from a blood bank (kindly provided by Dr. H. Krauss); 36 sera from diagnostic admissions to the clinics of the Justus-Liebig-University, Giessen; (kindly provided by Dr. W. Willems) as well as 26 sera from students of a virology course, and 8 sera from laboratory workers in the Department of Microbiology at Colorado State University, Fort Collins, were tested by DID. Several high-titer bovine sera from calves with experimentally induced and naturally occurring coronavirus infection also were used [18] .\n\nThe micromethod of Crowle [3] was slightly modified and applied in the DID test. The reaction substrate, 1.2% agarose in a 0.9% NaC1 solution, was applied to precoated, 0.5-ram thick glass slides. Plastic templates with one central well and 6 peripheral wells having diameters of 3.75 mm and spaced 8.5 mm appart were placed onto the agarose surface. Antigens and antisera were added to the wells in volumes of 25 X. The diffusion reaction proceeded for 2 days at room temperature in a humidified plastic container. The templates were removed, and the reaction slides were washed in saline for 24-36 hs. The agarose layer was then covered with filter paper and dried in a stream of warm air. The dried preparations were stained with 0.25% Coomassie brilliant blue, then destained with methanol-acetic acid-water (5:1:5).\n\nAn alkaline extract of L9-infected BFTy cells was used as antigen [18] . Serum-free, L9-infected BFTy cells were scraped from the growth surface into the medium after cytopathic changes had developed. This suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 x g at 5~ The cell sediment was suspended in 0.1 M tris-barbital buffer (pH 8.6), disrupted with three short ultrasound treatments, then left in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 h. The extracted antigen preparation was then centrifuged again, as described above. The supernatant fluid was concentrated to a protein content of 2-3 mg/ml by vacuum dialysis against tris-barbital buffer. Control antigens were prepared from uninfected BFTy ceils by identical procedures.\n\nConstant 1:10 dilutions of serum that had been inactivated at 56~ for 30 min were mixed in amounts of 0.025 ml with equal volumes of serial 10-fold dilutions of L9 virus in Falcon microtest I1 plates [18] . Four replicates were used, and the serumvirus mixtures were allowed to react for 1 h at room temperature before 50-100,00 BFTy cells in a volume of 0.05 ml were added to each well. The cytopathic changes were scored after 6 days. The difference in infectivity between virus controls and the serum-virus mixtures, calculated according to the method of Reed and Muench [15] , gave the neutralization index of a given serum.\n\nThe antigen consisted of L9-infected BFTy cells, which were fixed in cold paraformaldehyde as soon as clearly distinguishable cytopathic changes were evident. Sera free of, or positive for, antibodies against bovine coronavirus from calves and three human subjects were tested in dilutions of from 1:10 to 1:320 in the test. Fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled antiserum against human or bovine IgG was used to trace binding of antibodies to coronavirus antigens in infected cells. Uninfected BFTy cells and normal sera served as controls.\n\nThe interaction of antibodies in bovine ( [ 13 ] , 1745) and in human sera (1255, 1334, 1339) with virions of coronavirus strain L9 was studied by IEM (7,10). These tests were done with heat-inactivated sera diluted 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, and 1:80. The sera were tested against BFTy-propagated L9 virus and virus from human diarrhea (10/26). Cell culture fluid of L9-infected BFTy cells was centrifuged at 10,000 \u2022 g for 20 min to settle cell debris. The superuatant fluid was mixed in 10 X amounts with 5 X of the respective serum dilutions and allowed to react for 45 rain at room temperature. Supernatant fluid from similarly centrifuged human diarrhea fluid was treated identically. The serum-virus mixtures were placed in 10 )t amounts on gel consisting of 0.4% agarose and 0.4% agar in barbital buffer of pH 8.2 in 60~mm Petri dishes. The plates were kept at 37~ for 30 rain before the samples were applied. Formvar carbon-coated grids were placed onto the specimen drops on the agar surfacer When the samples were absorbed, the grids were removed and negatively stained with 1.5% phosphotungstic acid for examination with an HU-12 Hitachi electron microscope\n\nFor assessing the effect of complement on the virus-antibody interaction, guinea pig complement at a 1:30 dilution was added in 5 X amounts to serum dilution-L9 virus mixtures, as described above. This reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37~\n\nC o m p l e m e n t , n o r m a l serum, and virus c o n t r o l s were included. These preparations were t h e n processed as m e n t i o n e d above for electron microscopic e x a m i n a t i o n . (Figs. 1 ~2) . These sera did not react with normal cell extracts.\n\nThe serum samples reacting in the DID test all neutralized the infectivity of bovine coronavirus Lg, having neutralizing indices of 2.5 to more than 5 ( Table 2 ). Forty serum samples that did not react in the DID test were assayed for neutralizing activity. Twenty one did not neutralize and 19 had an index of 1 to 3. The neutralization test thus detected 19 of 28 subjects with antibodies in the blood bank group 16 of 27 in the clinic patient group. Accordingly, a relatively high proportion in human subjects have antibodies that neutralize the bovine coronavirus. \n\nHuman sera 1255, 1334, and 1339 were titered by indirect immunofluorescence, and the fluorescence pattern and titers were compared with bovine sera 13 and 1745 in BFTy cells infected with L9 coronavirus. Brilliant cytoplasmic fluorescence was observed with human serum having a titer of 20. The bovine serum samples had titers of 40 (Table 3 ). Some individual cells had more intense juxtanuclear staining with both types of serum. The nuclei did not stain, nor did these sera react with uninfected ceils (Figs. 3,4) . Bovine and human sera not reacting in the DID test or neutralization test stained neither infected nor uninfected BFTy cells at dilutions of 1:10.\n\nThe interaction of antibodies against bovine coronavirus L9 in selected human and bovine sera was also compared by 1EM. The serological activities of the sera used are given in Table 3 . When present in excess, antibodies in both human and bovine sera matted or bridged the peplomers of the L9 coronavirus (Fig. 5) . Such viral particles remained single or in relatively small aggregates, but not all viral particles in a field Fig.3 were m a t t e d . T h e m a t t i n g reaction on the p e p l o m e r e s was m o s t readily seen on virus particles t h a t were flat a n d partly covered with stain. A t e q u i l i b r i u m c o n c e n t r a t i o n s of a n t i b o d i e s and virus particles, large viral aggregates f o r m e d with h u m a n as well as bovine sera (Fig. 6) . Virtually n o single particles remained in these preparations. It was difficult to identify a n t i b o d y molecules bridging virus particles in such aggregates.\n\nWhen c o m p l e m e n t was added to the a n t i s e r u m dilutions or after a n t i b o d i e s had i n t e r a c t e d with the virions, m a t t e d particles also were seen, b u t the viral aggregates were smaller. Viral m e m b r a n e pitting or o t h e r changes were n o t observed in viral particles excluding stain. C o m p a r e d with n o r m a l virus controls, flat, stain-covered viral particles h a d increased structural damage in c o m p l e m e n t -t r e a t e d samples. However, these changes also were observed in the incubated virus controls, as well as in the incubated virus-serum and virus-complement controls.\n\nDuring pathogenetic studies of coronavirus enteritis, one investigator, while handling calves inoculated orally with coronavirus strain LY-138 [4] , developed gastroenteritis with diarrhea that lasted 4 days. One diarrhea sample was collected for viral examination. Virus could not be cultivated from this sample. This strain was maintained by oral inoculation and intestinal passage in calves. Electron microscopic examination of differentially centrifuged diarrhea samples contained round or pleomorphic enveloped viral particles 80 to 130/am in diameter and with surface projections characteristic of coronaviruses. These viral structures were fiat and covered with stain. Morphologic evidence for other types of viruses was not found. Bovine serum 1745 and human serum 1334 induced matting of surface projections and aggregations of viral particles. A serum sample collected from this subject a year before this episode did not react in the DID test, but one collected thereafter induced one precipitin band in the DID test and had a neutralization index of 3.\n\nThis limited serological survey demonstrated that antibodies against an enteropathogenie bovine coronavirus occur in human sera obtained from subjects in Germany and the United States. These sera had antibodies that neutralized the infectivity of the bovine coronavirus, but they also functioned in the DID, IEM, and IFA reactions. This finding confirms the observation of Sharpee and Mebus [17] , who previously found that antibodies in human serum neutralized a bovine coronavirus. An antigenic relationship had also been demonstrated, by direct or indirect immunofluorescence, between human coronavirus represented by the organ culture strain 0C43 the porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus 67N mouse hepatitis coronavirus type 3 and a bovine coronavirus [ 13 ] .\n\nIt was surprising to us how frequently these cross-reacting antibodies can be found in human sera. Even so-called normal sera obtained from a blood bank had 7% that were positive in the DID test, and a still higher percentage had neutralizing antibodies. A similarly high frequency of antibodies against this bovine coronavirus strain had been previously detected during sero-epidemiological investigations of cattle [5, 18] . These results demonstrate that infections with bovine coronavirus or a closely related virus are widespread in human and cattle populations.\n\nThe different serological methods used exclude the possibility that the cross-reactions found were due to the presence of nonspecific inhibitors. Such inhibitors, which influence hemagglutination by coronaviruses, are known to occur in human serum [6, 8] . Similarly, the participation of so-called heterotypic antibodies on the serological crossreactions [9, 14] can be excluded, since all serum samples tested were heat-inactivated. Furthermore, there was no evidence in the electron microscopic pictures that complement changes the morphology of virus particles in virus-antibody complexes which was described to be the case when heterotypic antibodies interact [14] .\n\nWhether the same virus strain infects man as well as cattle, or whether the demontion of antibodies is merely the result of similarities in the antigenic structure in two different species-specific virus strains is not yet known. The immune electron microscopic findings and the results of the neutralization tests suggest that the reactive antigen is associated with the glycoprotein peplomeres. From the murine coronavirus A59 it is known that the glycoprotein E2 induces the formation of neutralizing antibodies [20] . The general experience that viral glycoproteins are strain-specific antigens could favor the assumption that the same coronavirus strain, which has a stable antigenic structure [18] , may infect either species. Accordingly, the extent of the antigenic relationship between OC43 and the bovine coronavirus has to be defined further. It is of interest that calf sera commercially available for cell culture contained antibodies having high neutralizing activity for the L9 strain [18] . Such calf serum specifically neutralized the human coronavirus strain 0C43 [6] .\n\nThe significance of bovine coronavirus as a causative agent for a human disease cannot be assessed at the present time. One should be aware of the possibility that the infection may become of clinical importance in rural areas. Our findings that the bovine coronavirus LY-138 was transmitted from calves to man, resulting in gastroenteritis with diarrhea, seems to be especially relevant. The potential danger that bovine coronavirus could infect man should be kept in mind when calves affected with coronaviral enteritis are handled."}
