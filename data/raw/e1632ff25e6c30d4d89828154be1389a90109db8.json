{"title": "Comparative genomics reveals signature regions used to develop a robust and sensitive multiplex TaqMan real-time qPCR assay to detect the genus Dickeya and Dickeya dianthicola", "body": "The genus Dickeya belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae and is comprised of pectinolytic Gram negative plant pathogenic bacteria, responsible for the soft rot diseases worldwide. Due to their association with catastrophic diseases, Dickeya species have been listed among the top ten most destructive bacterial plant pathogens (Mansfield et al. 2012) . Soft rot Enterobacteria are also associated with the most serious problems facing potato production worldwide. The impact of soft rot disease varies from country to country; in the Netherlands, the annual estimated losses are around \u20ac30 million per year, while in Israel, potato yield losses of 20-25% have been observed. Symptoms caused by Dickeya spp. are more severe in high moisture and temperature environments (Czajkowski et al. 2009 ). Infected plants show stunting, chlorosis, wilting, black discoloration and soft rot, which begins at the stem base and progresses upward. Once infection has occurred, the pathogen colonizes the vascular tissues and moves throughout the plant (Raoul des Essarts et al. 2016); severe infections lead to whole plant collapse. Latent infections can result in severe losses during storage, especially in warehouses that lack refrigeration facilities (Laurila et al. 2008 ). In recent years, D. dianthicola has emerged as one of the most important pathogens infecting potatoes worldwide, and symptoms resemble those of blackleg caused by Pectobacterium species (Boluk and Arif 2019). Due to high economic impact in the European potato growing countries, D. dianthicola (syn. Erwinia chrysanthemi pv. dianthicola) has been listed in the EPPO A2 List of pests recommended for regulation as quarantine pests A2/53 (Pg 8); http://archives.eppo.int/EPPOStandards. At present, neither resistant varieties nor effective physical, chemical or biological controls have been reported to manage D. dianthicola diseases under field conditions (Czajkowski et al. 2014) . Only preventive measures are recommended, which include planting certified seeds, eradicating contaminated plant materials, screening for latent infections, monitoring appropriate storage conditions and inspecting fields (Motyka et al. 2017) . Therefore, early, accurate and sensitive detection of Dickeya species is important to identify inoculum sources before they become a problem. TaqMan qPCR assay for detection of Dickeya spp. and described a number of primer pairs to detect different Dickeya sp. TaqMan qPCR with the probes labelled with different fluorogenic dyes enables simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens or pests in a single tube (Arif et al. 2015) . Multiplex TaqMan can be very useful for detection of different Dickeya species, which produces nearly indistinguishable disease symptoms without compromising the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.\n\nIn this study, we have presented a multiplex TaqMan qPCR for sensitive and simultaneous detection of genus Dickeya and D. dianthicola. The developed multiplex TaqMan qPCR was validated in the lab extracted DNA from purified cultures and naturally infected potato samples. Comparative genomics using Mauve identified signature genomic regions; the gene mglA/mglC region was used to design the primers/probe for the genus Dickeya, while the alcohol dehydrogenase gene was used for designing the primers targeting D. dianthicola. The developed assay has applications in farm management, seed certification, biosecurity and to discover new reservoir hosts.\n\nThirty-three Dickeya strains, collected from different geographical locations worldwide, were used in an inclusivity panel (Table 1 ). Strain numbers prefixed with \"A\" were obtained from the Pacific Bacterial Collection (University of Hawaii at Manoa). In addition, 34 bacterial strains from other genera comprising closely related species from different genera, were included in an exclusivity panel (Table 1 ). All strains were stored at -80 \u2022 C. For culturing, strains were streaked on 2,3,5triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride sucrose medium (TZC-S: peptone 10 g l -1 , sucrose 5 g l -1 , 0.001% TZC and agar 17 g l -1 ) (Norman and Alvarez 1989). The plates were incubated at 26\u00b0C (\u00b12\u00b0C) overnight; single colonies were streaked on YSC medium (yeast extract 10 g l -1 , dextrose 20 g l -1 , calcium carbonate 20 g l -1 and agar 17 g l -1 ) and incubated at 26\u00b0C (\u00b12\u00b0C) overnight; these plates were used for DNA isolation. \n\nNew York, USA Prunus avium --Soil --Healthy potato ---Indicates no amplification; \u00b1 standard deviation of cycle threshold (Ct) values of three replicates; *95% identity with P. wasabiae and 94% with P. parmentieri (BLASTn results on 5.22.18); SD is standard deviation; a sequencing quality was poor. Therefore, sequence was not submitted to NCBI GenBank.\n\nHealthy potato plants were grown in a greenhouse. Before planting, the sprouting seed potatoes were cut into two pieces, and a piece having at least two buds was planted into a separate pot and placed on the greenhouse bench. Four-week-old healthy potato plants were inoculated with D. dianthicola strains. For plant inoculations, sterile scalpels were used to make wounds at the base of the stems of the healthy plants and a loopful of bacteria was stabbed into the fresh wound. The inoculated plants were covered individually with the plastic bags to maintain the humidity, tied and incubated at 28 to 30\u00b0C for 24-48 h. Black leg symptoms were observed at the base of the stem three days after inoculation. Healthy plants inoculated with sterile water showed no symptoms. The DNA was extracted from the healthy and inoculated plants.\n\nGenomic DNA extraction, identification and phylogenetic analysis Extraction of genomic DNA from infected and healthy plant materials was performed using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI); DNA was isolated from bacterial cultures using the Ultra Clean Microbial DNA Isolation kit (Mo Bio., Carlsbad, CA).

DNA concentration and purity were measured using NanoDrop 2000/c spectrophotometers (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Worcester, MA). The genomes of all Dickeya, and Pectobacterium species were aligned separately with progressive Mauve ( Pectobacterium Pec.dnaA-F1 (5'-CATACGTTTGATAACTTCGTTG-3') and Pec.dnaA-R1 (5'-GATGTCGTGGCTTTCTTCAC-3') primers were used to amplify the dnaA gene region of Pectobacterium species. The identity of other bacteria listed in the exclusivity panel was confirmed using primers P16s-F1 and P16s-R1 targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA region. The PCR conditions used for Dickeya and Pectobacterium dnaA gene amplifications were: Initial denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles with 95 \u2022 C for 20 s, 58 \u2022 C for 1 min, 72 \u2022 C for 1 min and a final extension at 72 \u2022 C for 3 min. The amplified PCR products were cleaned by adding 2 \u00b5l ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA) in 5 \u00b5l of PCR product and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 15 min followed by enzyme inactivation at 80 \u2022 C for 15 min. Sequencing was performed at the GENEWIZ facility (Genewiz, La Jolla, CA) for both sense and anti-sense strands. Obtained sense and antisense strands of each strain were aligned, manually edited and the error free consensus sequence was used to confirm identity by comparing the sequences of each strain against the NCBI GenBank nucleotide and genome databases using NCBI BLASTn tool. Sequences generated from each strain were deposited in the NCBI GenBank database and the accessions numbers are listed in Table 1 . Consensus sequences of 46 strains used in this study were aligned to generate a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic relationships among the strains was generated using the Neighbor-Joining method and the evolutionary distances were calculated using Tamura The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Whole genomes were aligned using progressive Mauve (2.4.0) and Geneious (10.2.3). Generated locally Collinear Blocks (LCBs) were analyzed to search unique and conserved regions for the genus Dickeya and D. dianthicola. The galactose/methyl galactoside ABC transporter ATP-binding protein MglA/MglC region was used to design the primers and probe specific for the genus Dickeya. Similarly, for D. dianthicola, the genomes of D. dianthicola (NZ_CM001838, NZ_CM001840, NZ_CM001841 and NZ_CM002023) were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank Genome database (Supplementary Table 1 ) and aligned using progressive Mauve; Geneious was used for analyzing the unique genes present in the D. dianthicola genome. The alcohol dehydrogenase gene was used to design the primers and probe specific for D. dianthicola. Table 2 . No flap sequences were added to the probes. The specificity of each primer was confirmed in silico using the BLASTn tool against the NCBI GenBank nucleotide and genome databases ( Table 2 ). All primers and double-quencher probes 5'-/6FAM/ZEN/3IBQ/-3' and 5'-/5HEX/ZEN/3IBQ/-3' were synthesized by IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA).

The blue and green arrows indicate the location of the region for the galactose/methyl galactoside ABC transporter ATP-binding protein MgIA/MglC and alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively. The BLAST RING IMAGE GENERATOR (BRIG) 40 (Alikhan et al., 2011) was used to generate the image. Plasmids were not included in the analysis.\n\nThe multiplex TaqMan qPCR was performed in Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen, Germatown, MD). The concentrations of the primers and probes were adjusted to obtain the optimal amplification. The primer mix was prepared by adding 10 \u00b5l of each forward and reverse primer (from stock: 100 \u00b5mol l -1 ) for genus Dickeya and D. dianthicola and 160 \u00b5l nuclease free water. The multiplex TaqMan reactions were initially performed in two combinations: primers without 5' AT-rich flap sequences and with 5' AT-rich flap sequences. The multiplex TaqMan qPCR reaction was carried out in 25 \u03bcl reaction mixture containing 12.5 \u03bcl of Rotor-Gene Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen), 2 \u03bcl of the primer mix (5 \u00b5mol l -1 each), 0.5 \u03bcl of each DICg-P and Ddia-P probes (5 \u00b5mol l -1 stock), 1 \u00b5l of template DNA and nuclease free water was adjusted to obtain final volume. Positive and negative controls (non-template; water) were included in each TaqMan qPCR amplification run. Each qPCR reaction was performed in three replicates; standard deviation was calculated. Temperature cycling conditions were: 5 min at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 60 \u00b0C for 15 s, acquiring fluorescence on both green (FAM) and yellow (HEX) channels at the end of each extension step. The data analysis was done using the Rotor-Gene Q series software 2.3.1 (Built 49) with auto threshold (Ct); dynamic tube-based normalization was used.\n\nThe specificity of the developed multiplex TaqMan qPCR was validated using the individual DNA template from all 67 bacterial strains included in the inclusivity and exclusivity panels ( Table 1) . The specificity assays were performed using the primers with flap sequences. All reactions were performed in triplicate; positive and negative template controls were included in each qPCR run. The data analysis was done as described above.\n\nTo minimize the variations among the assays, all sensitivity experiments were performed using the same serial dilutions on the same day. The sensitivity was performed using a ten-fold serially diluted purified genomic DNA (10 ng to 1 fg) of D. dianthicola (A5569). To compare the sensitivity, two sets of assays were performed, one using the primer mix with no flap and other using the primer mix with flap primers. The limit of detection of the developed assay was determined in a host DNA background: 1 \u00b5l of host (potato) genomic DNA (10 ng \u00b5l -1 ) was added in each 10-fold serially diluted genomic DNA of D. dianthicola (A5569) from 10 ng to 1 fg. The assays were performed in triplicate. These dilutions along with a no-template control (NTC, water) were run in a Rotor-Gene Q Thermocycler; the TaqMan real-time qPCR conditions were used as .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/847590 doi: bioRxiv preprint described above. The estimated genome size of D. dianthicola is ~ 4.86 Mb. Based on the genome size, the copy number was calculated using the formula: number of copies (molecules) = * . / ( * / ) * * / (where X = amount of amplicon (ng), N = length of dsDNA amplicon, 660 g/mole = average mass of 1 bp dsDNA) or web based software (www.scienceprimer.com/copy-number-calculator-for-realtime-pcr).\n\nTo compare the sensitivity of the multiplex with the single TaqMan qPCR assay, the ten-fold serially diluted DNA was used with the single flap primer set. Two separate reaction mixes were prepared, one containing the primer set targeting the genus Dickeya and the other targeting D. dianthicola. The ten-fold serial dilution sensitivity was performed in the similar way as described above.\n\nThe capability of the developed assay was tested with naturally infected potato samples collected from the field. A total of twenty-four plant samples were brought to the lab and washed with sterile water; stem explant of 1 cm size was taken in an Eppendorf tube and crushed with small pestle; DNA was isolated using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit. The DNA was quantified using Nanodrop and used for the multiplex TaqMan real-time qPCR. The multiplex TaqMan qPCR was performed using the reaction components and conditions as described above. Three replicates of each sample were run along with the positive and the negative controls.\n\nThe developed TaqMan qPCR was used to screen the samples, collected from six potato growing states of USA, for the genus Dickeya and/or D. dianthicola contamination/infection. A total of 132 asymptomatic, symptomatic plant samples which included potato stems, tubers and roots, and 3 from potato fields water sources, were screened. The tests were performed at the Wisconsin Seed Potato Certification Laboratory (Wisconsin, USA). Each sample was replicated once; the positive and the negative template controls (NTC) were included in each test run.\n\nThe highly conserved region present only in the core genome of D. dianthicola as well as the genus Dickeya was found by evaluating sixteen genomes of the genera Dickeya, Pectobacerium, Erwinia, Ralstonia and Clavibacter using BLAST comparisons and MAUVE (Figure 1 ). Mauve-based progressive whole genome alignments enabled the gene selection for the Dickeya species and D. dianthicola. The alcohol dehydrogenase gene region was identified as a signature gene region present in the core genome of D. dianthicola and was used for designing the robust primers and probe specifically amplifying this species. Furthermore, the galactose/methyl galactoside ABC transporter ATP-binding protein mglA/mglC region was identified as a unique target for designing the primers and probe amplifying all known species of genus Dickeya (Figure 1 ). This gene is a part of ABC transporter complex and involved in the import of galactose/methyl galactoside by ATP hydrolysis. Both sets of designed primers and probes were analyzed by BLAST against the NCBI GenBank database and showed 100% query coverage and 100% similarity only corresponding to their target species that is Dickeya and D. dianthicola (Table 2) .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/847590 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nTo determine identities and relationships, all bacterial strains present in inclusivity and exclusivity panels were sequenced. Pectobacterium and Enterobacter strains were amplified and sequenced using either dnaA or 16S rRNA specific primer set to confirm their identity (Table 1) . A manually corrected and proofread dnaA consensus sequence of ~742 bp was generated. Consensus sequences, produced from both strands, were queried against the NCBI GenBank database using the BLASTn tool to confirm the identity of each strain mentioned in Table 1 . The phylogenetic relationships among the bacterial strains were determined using MEGA-X and the sequence demarcation tool (v1.2), clearly grouped the strains of Dickeya species from the Pectobacterium. All Dickeya species strains were clustered together except D. paradisiaca which was out-grouped ( Figure 2 and 3) . The strains of Pectobacterium species were clustered all together.

All Dickeya strains grouped together except two D. paradisiaca strains that form a separate clade. All Pectobacterium species clustered together. \n\nThe in-silico analyses were performed via similarity search of each primer sequence against the NCBI GenBank database using the BLASTn tool; primers showed 100% specificity with query coverage and percent identity match of 100% with the target Dickeya genus and the species .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/847590 doi: bioRxiv preprint dianthicola ( Table 2) . During in-vitro experiments, the specificity of the developed assay was tested with the DNA from 13 and 20 strains of D. dianthicola and other species of Dickeya from distinct geographical origins, respectively ( Table 1 ). The Ct values from Dickeya strains, excluding D. dianthicola, ranged from 13.89\u00b10.04 to 30.84\u00b10.11 in the yellow channel (n=18), while the green channel showed amplification and Ct values from 13.76\u00b10.06 to 23.15\u00b10.06 with the strains of D. dianthicola (n=13). The yellow channel exhibited almost similar Ct values as the green channel for the same strains of D. dianthicola (13.93\u00b10.06 to 23.09\u00b10. 13) . No amplification in green or yellow channels were observed from the non-target and/or closely related species (n=34). This demonstrated that the developed primers/probes are highly specific for the genus Dickeya and specifically for D. dianthicola (Table 1) . No Ct values were observed in either green or yellow channels with any member of the exclusivity panel, healthy plant or soil sample included in the assay validation. In addition, during the specificity validation, no Ct value >35 was obtained with any member of the inclusivity panel. The amplification from each representative species from genus Dickeya is shown in Figure 4 . The primers with and without 5' AT-rich flap sequences were also tested for their specificity; no false positives or false negatives were obtained (data not shown). The assays were highly specific but still the samples with Ct value after 35 cycles were considered negative. \n\nThe primer sets with and without flap sequences were compared for their sensitivity using the purified D. dianthicola genomic DNA. Both primer sets with and without flaps were sensitive and detected 10 fg of purified genomic DNA ( Figure 5A1, A2; 5B1, B2 ). The primers with the 5' ATrich flap showed better reaction efficiency compared to the primer set with no flap (Figure 5A1 , A2). At lower concentrations of template DNA, the primers with no AT-rich flap sequences showed higher standard deviation among the replicates compared to primers with flap, indicating the enhanced stability and better reaction thermodynamics.\n\nNo change in the sensitivity was observed when 1 \u00b5l of host genomic DNA (DNA extracted from healthy potato plant) was added to each ten-fold serially diluted genomic DNA. The detection limit of 10 fg was detected; demonstrating the robustness of the developed assay with no adverse effect from host background DNA ( Figure 5C1, C2) .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/847590 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nTo demonstrate the robustness of the multiplex TaqMan qPCR, a single TaqMan qPCR assay was also performed to compare the detection limit using both primer/probe sets. Primer sets DICg-F1/R1-wf and Ddia-F1/R1-wf were able to detect up to 10 fg in both yellow and green reporting channels, respectively. These results indicated that the developed multiplex assay is robust and equally sensitive as single target TaqMan real-time qPCR assay ( Figure 5D1, D2) . Figure 5 . Multiplex and single TaqMan qPCR standard curves and graphs. The graphs and curves were generated using ten-fold serial diluted genomic DNA (10 ng to 1 fg) of Dickeya dianthicola (A, B, D) and ten-fold serially diluted genomic DNA mixed with host plant DNA (C).

The Ct values in both yellow and green channels ranged from 18.02\u00b10.04 to 32.37\u00b10.52 and 18.16\u00b10.01 to 34.08\u00b11.07, respectively. The bacteria were isolated from the positive samples and sequenced with forward and reverse primers described previously to confirm their identity. The multiplex qPCR showed 100% accuracy in detection of the Dickeya infected field samples. No false positives or false negatives were detected during the experiment ( Figure 6 ). Figure 6 . Multiplex TaqMan qPCR assay using infected field samples. The Green and yellow channels correspond to the different reporter dye 6-FAM (495/520) and HEX (535/554) (excitation/emission spectra in nm), respectively.

Each reaction was performed in three replicates.\n\nThe developed multiplex TaqMan real-time qPCR was used to screen 143 field samples (stem, potato tuber, root and water) for Dickeya and specifically for D. dianthicola infection ( Table 3) . Out of 143 samples, 61 were positive for genus Dickeya and of these, 60 were positive for D. dianthicola. Samples crossing the threshold value (Ct) after 35 cycles were considered negative. \n\nIn plant disease management, rapid, sensitive and accurate detection of pathogens is critical for timely responses that facilitate disease control. Furthermore, early disease detection is important for assessing plant health prior to seedling transplant. In this study, we developed a robust multiplex TaqMan real-time qPCR for simultaneous detection of all known Dickeya species and D. dianthicola in a single reaction. The primers were developed from unique and conserved genes, extracted using comparative genomic analyses of Dickeya species. The developed method has been thoroughly validated using strains in inclusivity and exclusivity panels as well as naturally and artificially infected samples. The method showed 100% accuracy and successfully detected infection of both Dickeya species and D. dianthicola from infected plant samples received from different states of the United States.\n\nDickeya is one of the most important enteric soft rot pathogens known to cause tremendous economic losses worldwide. Dickeya species, especially D. dianthicola, is a major problem for potato growing countries, and therefore is included in the European Union A2 quarantine list of pathogens. Accurate detection, distribution and monitoring of this pathogen is critical for prevention of higher economic losses. Detection by culturing and isolation is time-consuming, especially when the pathogen can be overgrown by saprophytic bacteria commonly present in infected samples. PCR provides fast, robust and accurate detection of pathogens compared to traditional culture-based methods. Compared to traditional PCR, real-time qPCR allows faster, accurate, sensitive and quantitative monitoring of a pathogen with less chance of carry over contaminations (Arif et The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/847590 doi: bioRxiv preprint assays depends on the target gene selection and the thermodynamics of the primers and probes .\n\nDuring this study, comparative genomics identified unique region/gene in the target genomes of Dickeya species. We designed the primers from these target genes and their flanked region -this approach enhances the specificity and reliability of the developed assay since the gene arrangement among the strains within a species is conserved compared to strains from different species. The primers were selectively tested both in-silico, by searching for the homology in the nucleotide database (NCBI GenBank BLASTn), and in-vitro, by screening against the strains present in inclusivity and exclusivity panels (Table 1 ). Using BLASTn, the primers and probes were found to be specific for the target pathogen with 100% identity match and query coverage. No false negatives or false positives were observed during the validation. In our lab, the alcohol dehydrogenase gene was also used to develop a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for specific, on-site detection of D. dianthicola and proved to be highly specific (Ocenar et al. 2019) .\n\nPreviously, we have demonstrated that incorporation of flap sequences at the 5' position of the primer could lead to increased sensitivity, fluorescence, overall PCR yield and optimize reaction efficiency (Arif and Ochoa-Corona 2013; Larrea et al. 2019). The 5' AT-rich flap sequences were added to both primers sets, DICg F1/R1 and Ddia F1/R1, to evaluate their effects on sensitivity and/or specificity of the developed assay. Both primers with and without 5' AT-rich flap sequences, targeting the Dickeya species and D. dianthicola, were specific for respective pathogens; no cross-reactions were observed (data not shown). Both multiplex primer sets, DICg F1/R1wf and Ddia F1/R1wf, with 5' AT-rich flap showed optimum reaction efficiency compared to the primers with no flaps ( Figure 5 ) and were sufficiently sensitive to detect the genomic DNA of D. dianthicola and Dickeya species down to 10 fg. However, primers with no flap showed some discrepancy among the replicates at the lowest concentration (10 fg; DICg F1/R1). Therefore, both primers with the 5' flap sequences were used for overall validation of the developed multiplex TaqMan qPCR assay. The addition of the 5' AT-rich flap also made the primers and probes compatible to mix and match based on user's need without losing specificity and/or sensitivity; these primers work under the \"One Lab -One Protocol\" concept (Arif 2019).\n\nMultiplexing for specific detection of multiple targets in a single reaction is time efficient, provides enhanced reliability and further validation of the outcomes (Li et al. 2017) . The probes labelled with internal ZEN quencher along with the traditional 3'end quencher enhance quenching efficiency, provide less background noise and increase precision ). Multiplexing the reaction with different primer and probe sets can adversely affect the sensitivity and can increase the background noise (Li et al. 2017 ). However, the developed assay did not show any discrepancy in the detection limit when assays were performed individually as compared to the multiplex reaction; both detected 10 fg of genomic DNA. The presence of plant DNA mixed with pathogen DNA has been reported to interfere with the Taq DNA polymerase due to the presence of strong DNA-binding domains, reducing Taq-polymerase availability and activity, which results in higher Ct values (Hoy et al. 2001; Strayer et al. 2016) . Therefore, the spiked assays were performed by adding the DNA from healthy plants along with target pathogen DNA in the multiplex qPCR reaction. No adverse effect on the Ct values was observed -the detection limit remained the same (10 fg) as with the pure genomic DNA from D. dianthicola. The genome size of Dickeya species ranges from 4.62-5.05 Mb (supplementary Table 1 ). Based on the calculations, 10 ng of D. dianthicola genomic DNA contains 1.93X10 6 copies, therefore, 10 fg should be equivalent to ~ 2 copies. The sensitivity of the developed multiplex TaqMan qPCR is higher (10 fg per reaction; Ct=33.75\u00b10.24 compared to the previously reported primers/assays by Potrykus et al. (2014) for Dickeya species (detection limit 10 pg per microlitre) and van der Wolf et al. (2014) for D. dianthicola (20 fg per reaction; Ct=36.5\u00b10.38).\n\nThe effectiveness and robustness of any developed method is accessed by its ability to detect the pathogen from naturally infected samples. Therefore, the developed assay was tested with twentyfour asymptomatic and symptomatic, naturally infected plant samples. Thirteen samples showed positive amplification in both yellow and green channels, confirming the presence of D. dianthicola. Each infected sample that tested positive with TaqMan qPCR assay was further confirmed by sequencing the dnaA gene region followed by BLASTn (data not included). The BLASTn results confirmed 100% identity match with D. dianthicola. Furthermore, the developed method was also tested with 143 different plant and water samples received from various locations by the Wisconsin Potato certification laboratory. The method was able to detect 61 samples positive for Dickeya species and 60 for D. dianthicola. The developed method demonstrated the ability to be used for monitoring Dickeya species and D. dianthicola infections in naturally infected plant samples.\n\nIn conclusion, we developed a highly sensitive, robust, accurate, reproducible and specific multiplex TaqMan qPCR based on the whole genome comparative genomics approach, to simultaneously detect Dickeya species and D. dianthicola. To our knowledge, this is the only multiplex TaqMan qPCR to simultaneously detect genus Dickeya and D. dianthicola. The potato industry involves the global exchange of plant propagative materials; this tool will allow diagnosticians and certification agencies/labs to quickly test and identify the pathogen from pure culture and/or infected plant samples to prevent the dissemination of the disease to uninfected areas. Practical applications of the developed assay were demonstrated in rapid and large-scale screening of potato samples for certification purposes. This tool can also be utilized for the phytosanitary, disease epidemiology and management purposes.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
