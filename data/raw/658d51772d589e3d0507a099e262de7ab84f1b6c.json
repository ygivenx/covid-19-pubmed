{"title": "Chromatographic removal combined with heat, acid and chaotropic inactivation of four model viruses", "body": "Despite rigorous controls being applied to biotechnology production processes, contamination with viruses is a common feature in most of the biological products. Viral contamination of a biological may occur from the source material, e.g. cell banks of animal origin, human blood, human or animal tissues, or as adventitious agents introduced by the production process, e.g. the use of animal sera in mammalian cell culture.\n\nIt is for this reason that process validation becomes an important tool for evaluating biopharmaceutical production processes of any mam-malian-derived product. The virus validation should provide a high level of assurance that final product will be free of contaminants.\n\nThis kind of study involves spiking the scale down downstream process with a highly infectious virus titer and evaluating the removal/inactivation ability of the whole process or process steps to reduce viruses.\n\nIt is not necessary to validate every individual step of a given manufacturing process, only those steps which most likely contribute to inactivate/ remove any virus need to be subject to a validation study (Larzul, 1999) .\n\nModel or relevant viruses need to be evaluated and these should represent the potential viral contaminants in the starting material (Table 1) .\n\nAnother critical element into the viral validation process is the validity of the scale down, which can be demonstrated by comparison of process parameters such as pH, temperature and bioseparation variables (e.g. residence time, elution profile, specific activity etc.).\n\nDue to the risk of viral contamination the virus validation study should be performed in a laboratory physically separated from the large-scale production facilities.\n\nIn this work we have studied the clearance factor of protein A affinity chromatography, acid pH and a combination of high temperature with a chaotropic agent for the production of a recombinant hepatitis B virus vaccine.\n\nThe monoclonal antibody (Mab) CB.Hep-1 is an IgG 2b , specific for the 'a' determinant of the recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (rHBsAg) (Fern\u00e1ndez de Coss\u00edo et al., 1997) . This Mab is used as immunoligand in the downstream purification process of rHBsAg, which is employed for a commercially available recombinant hepatitis B virus vaccine (HeberBiovac HB\u2122, Heber Biotec SA, Cuba) (Pent\u00f3 n et al., 1992; Agraz et al., 1994) . The ascites was obtained from specific pathogens free BALB/c mice, which were previously submitted to rigorous microbiological controls viral infection in the ICLAS Reference Center for Rodents Viruses of Nijmegen, Holland.\n\nThe design proposed for the purification of the monoclonal antibody CB.Hep-1 was a combination of several steps including its selective purification by protein A affinity chromatography ( Fig.  1 ).\n\nThe rHBsAg was obtained as previously described (Hardy et al., 2000) . Briefly, the recombinant Pichia pastoris yeast strain was kept under carefully controlled multiplication conditions. After harvesting, the yeast cells were disrupted (P\u00e1ez et al., 1993) to recover and purify the rHBsAg by a series of well-established steps. These included acid precipitation (P\u00e1ez et al., 1993) , adsorption/desorption from diatomaceous earth matrix and finally, successive purification through immunoaffinity, ion exchange and gel-filtration chromatographic procedures Pent\u00f3 n et al., 1994 ).\n\nThe clearance studies were performed in a laboratory separated from the production facilities, scaling down three steps potentially able to remove and/or inactivate viral charges: protein A affinity chromatography, low pH treatment and heating at 60\u00b0C in presence of 3 M KSCN, pH 7.0.\n\nThe virus reduction factor (R) was calculated individually and according to the following formula:\n\nwhere, V 1 and V 2 are the volumes of the starting and post-processing material, respectively, and C 1 and C 2 are the virus concentrations in the starting and post-processing material, respectively. The overall clearance factor was calculated as the sum of each individual removal and inactivation factor (Hageman, 1991) .\n\nThe model viruses used in this viral validation study (HIV-IIIb), human herpesvirus I, canine parvovirus, human poliovirus type II and sendaivirus (see Table 2 ) cover a wide range of physical-chemical and structural characteristics of the murine viruses according to the regulatory \n\nThe cytopathic effect was determined by the value of the tissue culture infectious dose (D 50 ml \u2212 1 ), which was calculated following the Reed Muench method (Reed and Muench, 1938) . The sensitivity limit of this assay is 10 1,3 TCID 50 ml \u2212 1 . Eight experimental determinations per each of the three replies of the reduction and inactivation experiments were used as a criterion in the assays. The cell lines used (HIV negative MT4, Vero and MDK LFKB) were cultured in serum containing medium 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C for several days according to the time needed by each virus to express its cytopathic effect. All cell culture materials and reagents used in these assays came from Gibco, Grand Island, USA.\n\nIn Table 3 we show the parameters considered in the scale down of the protein A affinity chromatography step. We determined the purity of the eluted Mab (SDS-PAGE), the process yield and the 'specific activity' of the Mab (ELISA). These were the principal comparative criteria to define process reproducibility. The protocols of these assays have been previously described (Vald\u00e9s et al., 1994) .\n\nFifty ml of semipurified material was individually loaded with viruses and applied into protein A affinity column (2.5 ml) (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, Upssala, Sweden) packed in a c 9/10 column, previously equilibrated with 150 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. Subsequently the ma-trix was washed with the same buffer and the Mab CB.Hep-1 was eluted with 100 mM citric acid, pH 3.0. The samples were neutralized by addition of 2 M tris before measuring the virus cytopathic effect.\n\nDepending on the maximum titer obtained for each virus we applied different quantities of viruses to the above mentioned column for virus removal evaluation. The initial titer was 8.4, 5.7, 7.5, 10.2 and 9.7 for sendaivirus, HIV-IIIb, human herpesvirus I, human poliovirus type II and canine parvovirus, respectively.\n\nThe viral inactivation at low pH study was carried out by incubating the samples of Mab CBV.Hep-1 containing virus at 4\u00b0C for 7 h in 100 mM citric acid, pH 3.0 and taking samples \n\nEach virus model was inoculated in 1 ml of the eluted antigen and was incubated at 60\u00b0C for 2 h. After this, temperature was reduced to 20\u00b0C and the cytopathic effect was measured for each virus. The initial titer was 7.5, 5.5, 8.0, 10 and 8.5 for sendaivirus, HIV-IIIb, human herpesvirus I, human poliovirus type II and canine parvovirus, respectively.\n\nWe measured viruses by detecting their cytopathic effects (including parvo and poliovirus). This method has the disadvantage that it is culture specific-infectivity and/or replication and the effect depends on the specific virus strain; but it is quantitative, has a broad range of specificity and can detect low levels of viral contamination.\n\nAs is shown in Table 4 the process yield, purity and specific activity of the Mab obtained at laboratory scale were similar to the results obtained at large scale.\n\nWe evaluated the ability of the protein A affinity chromatography to remove the model viruses previously showed in Table 2 . The distribution of the viral amounts onto the column is shown in Table 5 .\n\nDue to the specific interaction between protein A and Mab, the matrix was able to remove 86% for sendaivirus, 93% for HIV-IIIb and 97.3% for human herpesvirus I of the respective initial viral charges. It had been hypothesized that charged regions of the viral envelope would interact with protein A media. These high reduction factors coincide with results reported by other authors (Darling and Spaltro, 1996) .\n\nAdditionally nonenveloped viruses behaved differently than the enveloped viruses. The observed reduction factor was about 71 and 60.1% for human poliovirus type II and canine parvovirus, respectively.\n\nThe behavior of nonenveloped viruses can not be explained solely by the hypothesis that certain kind of viruses could interact with the matrix by mean of electrostatic binding of positive charges present in viral enveloped glycoproteins. These results seem to suggest that the chromatographic matrix could also function as a gel filtration matrix. This is possible, because viruses ranging from 18 to 30 nm are trapped in the Sepharose CL-4B and consequently a few viral particles may not be easily removed from the inner of the solid phase. The increase in the quantity of washing buffer prior the elution step to differentiate any unspecific elution from the Mab elution could solve this problem.\n\nIn addition, we did not find inactivation of any virus into the chromatographic column. That is an important observation, because it forces us to use acid pH as an inactivating agent after the protein A affinity chromatography. As a consequence, the removal and inactivation factors obtained in the affinity and acid pH steps, respectively, can be analyzed individually, because they work under different mechanisms, which in-crease the cumulative clearance factor of the whole purification process. However, a longer residence time (more than 7 min) could favor the inactivation process inside the column, allowing both processes (removal and inactivation) to be considered as individual steps in terms of the cumulative process clearance factor.\n\nConsidering the results obtained for human poliovirus type II and canine parvovirus and also because, no single chromatographic step should be considered sufficient as its own, an additional inactivation step was included. We included the low pH condition, which occurs as part of the purification process, during the elution step (see Fig. 1 ).\n\nAs Fig. 2 (I-A, II-A) illustrates almost all the initial charge of enveloped viruses was completely inactivated by pH 3.0, 75% of inactivation factor was obtained for canine parvovirus and no inactivation was demonstrated for human poliovirus type II after 7 h.\n\nThe difference observed in resistance between viruses could be partially explained, because of the presence of the viral envelope.\n\nAs it was previously mentioned the purified Mab CB.Hep-1 is used during the immunopurification of rHBsAg, which is eluted from immunoaffinity column, by using 3 M KSCN.\n\nThe HBsAg that is initially liberated from yeast cells is a non-disulfide-bonded aggregate of monomer subunits. This aggregated can be converted into fully disulfide-bonded particles that resemble the natural HBsAg by treatment with 3 M KSCN, which is suggested to facilitate exchange (intrachain to interchain) within already oxidized HBsAg polypeptides (Wampler et al., 1985) , intrachain and interchain disulfide linkages between dimmers and higher multimers are known to be responsible for stabilizing the correct three-dimensional structure of highly immunogenic HBsAg particles.\n\nAs the stability of rHBsAg is increased at high concentration of 3 M KSCN, we combined this condition with high temperature (60\u00b0C) and virus inactivation was analyzed using a phase exponential decay model.\n\nTaking into account this process design, we carried out the spiking experiments by infecting samples with viral charges before heating them and then we evaluated viral reduction after sample desalting. As Fig. 2 (I-B , II-B) shows that 100% of the viral charges were inactivated under this condition during 60 min.\n\nConsidering these results it is possible to conclude that the protein A affinity chromatography followed by a low pH treatment is able to reduce 16 logs for enveloped viruses. However, no more than 7.7 logs was the maximum clearance factor showed by these two steps for nonenveloped viruses. Human poliovirus type II was not inactivated by citric acid, pH 3.0. The heat treatment is an additional safety level, of- LRV, log reduction value. The sensitivity limit of the assay is 10 1.3 TCID 50 ml \u22121 . fering a robust reduction factor to the production of the Cuban hepatitis B virus vaccine."}
