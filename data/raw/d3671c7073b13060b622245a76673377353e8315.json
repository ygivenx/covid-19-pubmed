{"title": "CEA adhesion molecules: multifunctional proteins with signal-regulatory properties Bj6rn Obrink", "body": "The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which was discovered in 1965 [1], has given its name to a large and complex family of abundantly expressed proteins. Available data indicate that these molecules are multifunctional, but largely their biological roles have remained elusive. One of the documented properties for many of the CEA family proteins is cell adhesion, and recently results have emerged from several laboratories that demonstrate that some of these adhesion molecules have important functions in signal transduction. This review will focus on recent progress in the study of the role of CEArelated adhesion molecules, particularly the phylogenetically conserved cell-cell adhesion molecules (C-CAMs), as signal-regulatory proteins, and on the possible molecular mechanisms that are involved in signal transduction via CEA molecules. For background information and reference to earlier work, previous reviews [2--6] should be consulted.\n\nThe CEA gene family belongs to the immunoglobulin gene superfamily (IgSF) and comprises a large number of genes [2, 3] . Two major subgroups, designated the CEA and the pregnant-specific glycoprotein (PSG) subgroups, exist [2] . The majority of the proteins in the CEA subgroup are cell surface bound, whereas the PSGs are secreted. Only the cell surface bound molecules of the CEA subgroup will be considered here. Unfortunately, the nomenclature of the CEA family is complex and confusing, and several of the molecules are known under many different names. The cell surface bound CEA subgroup molecules and their names are shown in Figure 1 .\n\nThe cell surface associated CEA family proteins are heavily glycosylated and can either be transmembrane or associated with the plasma membrane via a GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor. However, .GPI-linked CEA family cell surface proteins are only found in humans (and probably in other primates as well), whereas the rodent cell surface molecules are exclusively transmembrane ( Figure 1 ). In the rat, the transmembrane proteins have been called C-CAMs, while they are known as biliary glycoproteins in mice and man (abbreviated as Bgps and BGPs, respectively). In the following discussion, however, these homologous molecules will be referred to as rat C-CAMs, mouse C-CAMs, and human C-CAMs, respectively ( Figure 1 ). All CEA-related cell surface molecules have an extraceilular amino-terminal V-type Ig domain, which is followed by a variable number (0-6) of C2-type Ig domains.\n\nThe cell surface associated C-CAMs in rat, mouse and man are highly conserved with respect to both domain organization and amino acid sequence, suggesting that they originated from a common ancestor. Only one gene has been found in each of humans and rats, whereas mice have two related genes, Bgpl and Bgp2 [7] . The number of Ig domains in C-CAMs varies from one to four as a result of differential splicing. The amino-terminal V-type domain is highly homologous to that of other CEA family members. Alternative splicing also gives rise to two forms of cytoplasmic domains containing either 10-12 or 71-73 amino acids [8] [9] [10] . The different cytoplasmic domains will be referred to as S (short) and L (long), respectively. In addition to glycosylation and splice variants, two allelic \n\ngp 110 (rat) NCA-160 (man) pp 120 (rat) CBATP (rat)\n\nCell surface bound CEA-related molecules. The cell surface bound CEA-related molecules are either transmembrane proteins or bound to the plasma membrane via a GPI anchor. The GPl-linked molecules (CEA, NCA, CGM6 and CGM2) do not occur in rodents, nor do two transmembrane molecules, CGM1 and CGMT, but they are found in man. In contrast, the C-CAMs, which are phylogenetically conserved, are expressed in rats, mice and humans. Several of these molecules are known under a large number of names in the literature, and this confusion over nomenclature has contributed to the complexity of this field. In this review a simplified nomenclature, shown in the upper half of the figure, is used. Some of the many other names that are in use are shown in the lower part of the figure. In addition to the two C-CAM isoforms (C-CAM-L and C-CAM-S) shown in the figure, several alternatively spliced isoforms with fewer Ig domains occur. They have been given distinct names, and are not shown in the figure. Also CGM1 can be alternatively spliced, yielding either a soluble isoform or a transmembrane isoform with a shorter cytoplasmic domain; only the isoform with the long cytoplasmic domain is shown in the figure. CBATP, canalicular bile acid transport protein; CD, cluster of differentiation; gp, glycoprotein; HA 4, hepatocyte antigen 4; MHVR, mouse hepatitis virus receptor; pp, phosphoprotein; TM-CEA, transmembrane CEA.\n\nvariants, denoted a and b, occur in both rats and mice [8, 9] . They are different from each other primarily in the amino-terminal Ig domain.\n\nThe GPI-linked CEA-related molecules, including CEA itself, represent the evolutionarily youngest members of the family. It is not clear why the human species contains GPI-linked cell surface bound CEA-related proteins, but it suggests that they may have replaced some of the functions of rodent C-CAMs. A comparison of the tissue expression of C-CAM and CEA in rat and human tissues gives some support for this idea [I1,12] . Novel functions for the GPI-linked proteins may also have developed.\n\nIn adult tissues the CEA-related cell surface molecules are expressed primarily in different epithelia, vessel endothelia, and hematopoietic cells [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , but individual molecules show distinct expression patterns. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of C-CAMs suggests important functions during embryonic development; a highly dynamic expression has been seen in, for example, the trophoblasts of the placenta [16, 17] , the endothelial cells and pericytes during vascularization of the central nervous system [18] , muscle development [16] , and development and eruption of teeth [19] .\n\nInterest in this family also emanates from numerous reports showing that its members are associated with malignancy [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Alterations in expression patterns in various tumors have been reported for CEA, NCA (nonspecific cross-reactive antigen), CGM (CEA gent family member)2 and C-CAM. CEA has for a long time been the most widely used tumor marker in clinical medicine. However, no clear picture of the functional roles of these molecules in cancer has yet emerged.\n\nA number of functions have been ascribed to the membrane-bound CEA family molecules, including cell adhesion, ecto-ATPase activity, bile salt transport activity, receptor internalization, recognition of bacteria and viruses, blocking of cell differentiation, and regulation of signal transduction. It has been reported that the cytoplasmic L domain is needed for C-CAM-mediated homophilic adhesion in insect Sf9 cells [31\u00b0,33]. However, both the L and the S forms of C-CAM can mediate adhesion in mammalian CHO cells [34, 35] ; in these cells there are indications that the S form may even be more effective than the L form (K WikstriSm, B 0brink, unpublished data). Thus, it seems as if the cellular background is essential for the manifestations of C-CAM adhesive activities, which may be a function of the supramolecular organization of C-CAM and its interactions with other molecules (see below).\n\nIn addition to homophilic and hetetophilic binding between the CEA-related adhesion molecules themselves, human C-CAM and NCA mediate adhesion of granuiocytes to E-selectin on vessel endothelial cells because they carry a specific carbohydrate structure known as the sialyl Lex epitope which is a ligand for E-selectin [36, 37] . This interaction triggers activation of I]2 integrins in the granulocytes, which leads to firm adhesion to the endothelial cells. Stimulation of granulocytes by antibodies to human C-CAM and NCA also induces 132-integrin-mediated cell aggregation [38] .\n\nC-CAM is not present in intercellular junctions but is concentrated in areas where cells are more loosely associated with each other. A striking example is the junctional epithelium that forms a transition zone between the teeth and the gingival epithelium. The junctional epithelial cells have no tight junctions, very few desmosomes, and express no E-cadherin (C Terling, J Wroblewski, B Obrink, unpublished data), but they seem to be kept together by abundant microvillar projections [39] . The high concentration of C-CAM in these areas [19] indicates that it may have a major adhesive role.\n\nAlthough C-CAM appears in intercellular contact areas in several locations, such as between stratified epithelial cells [11] , in contact zones between endothelial cells and pericytes of vessel walls [18] , and between hepatocytes in mature liver [40] , it has also been found in high concentrations on microvillar-rich apical surfaces of simple epithelia and in bile canaliculi [11] . The GPI-linked molecules CEA and NCA are also found on apical surfaces and in the glycocalyx of colon epithelial cells [41] . Thus, in these locations the CEA-related molecules may have functions other than intercellular adhesion, although it is possible that they might mediate dynamic adhesive interactions between microvilli. However, one should consider the possibility that the adhesive properties of CEA-related molecules might reflect molecular interactions that are more important for signal transduction than for the formation of strong physical intercellular bonds.\n\nThe eDNA encoding rat C-CAM was originally cloned as encoding a CaZ+/MgZ+-dependent ecto-ATPase [42] .\n\nIn agreement with this, increased ecto-ATPase activity was conferred on COS cells and Sf9 cells that were transfected with rat C-CAM-L [31\u00b0, 43] . The C-CAMinduced ecto-ATPase activity in Sf9 cells was abrogated by mutation of Arg98, which is believed to be part of an ATPase consensus sequence [31\u00b0,42] . However, the agreement between the C-CAM sequence containing Arg98 and the ATPase consensus sequence is only partial. It seems more likely that this arginine residue affects the ATPase activity because of its essential role for the three-dimensional structure of the Ig domain, as discussed above. A truncation of the cytoplasmic L domain of C-CAM also destroyed the ATPase activity [31\u00b0]. Thus, both an intact amino-terminal V-type Ig domain and an intact cytoplasmic L domain seem to be required for ecto-ATPase activity in these cells. However, efforts in a number of laboratories have failed to confirm any ATPase activity of purified C-CAM, and it has been found that the bulk of the ATPase activity can be chromatographically separated from C-CAM ( [44] ; I Hunter, B 0brink, unpublished data). How could these apparently conflicting results be explained? There seem to be two possibilities: either the ecto-ATPase activity is not an intrinsic property of C-CAM, which instead might regulate the ATPase activity of another molecule; or the ATPase activity needs a particular C-CAM supramolecular organization, requiring both the amino-terminal Ig domain and the L domain, that is lost when C-CAM is solubilized from the membrane.\n\nIn experiments with reconstituted purified C-CAM [45] or with C-CAM-transfected COS cells [43] , it has been observed that rat C-CAM-L can mediate ATP-driven efflux of taurocholate. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that this activity required phosphorylation of Set503 and was regulated by phosphotylation of Tyr488; both of these amino acid residues are located in the cytoplasmic domain of C-CAM-L [43] . The transport activity was completely abrogated by truncation of the cytoplasmic domain. However, it is not easy to see how a single-pass membrane protein can act as a transmembrane, taurocholate-transporting molecule, unless specific oligomerization of C-CAM-L occurs. The ileal and hepatocyte sinusoidal bile acid transporters are muhipass membrane-spanning proteins [46, 47] . A possibility is that C-CAM may interact with a bile acid transporter and thus act as a tissue-specific regulator of bile acid transport.\n\nC-CAM also has receptor-regulating effects as observed from its effect on the insulin receptor. A two-to threefold increase in the rate of receptor internalization, triggered by insulin stimulation, was observed in cells that were transfected with C-CAM [481.\n\nCEA-related surface proteins act as receptors for both bacteria and viruses. Fimbrial proteins of several strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella bind to D-mannosyl residues on CEA, NCA and human C-CAM [49, 50] . A different mode of bacterial binding was recently described for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis, which bind specifically to the amino-terminal Ig domains of human C-CAM, NCA, CGM1 and CEA via their virulence-associated Opa proteins [51, 52] .\n\nLike several other cell adhesion molecules of the IgSF, C-CAM cart also function as a virus receptor. Thus, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavirus, utilizes mouse C-CAM as its receptor [53] . Several splice variants coded by the Bgpl a gene act as MHV receptors, but mice having the allelic variant Bgpl b are resistant to MHV. However, in transfected cells one of the Bgplb-coded isoforms could also act as a receptor [53] , although the efficiency of the two allelic variants differs significantly [54] . A protein product from the murine C-CAM gene B~2 can also act as receptor for MHV [7] .\n\nRat coronaviruses do not use rat C-CAM as a receptor.\n\nIt has been argued that overexpression of CEA and NCA in human carcinomas interferes with cell differentiation [55, 56] . This suggestion is supported by findings that ectopic expression of CEA and NCA in rat myoblasts blocks biochemical and morphological differentiation [55] . CEA can cooperate with Myc and Bcl-2 and cause complete cellular transformation [56] . The differentiation-blocking effect of CEA depends on its adhesive activity, but it is not known if specific signaling mechanisms are involved.\n\nThere are now convincing data showing that C-CAMs and several of the human GPI-linked CEA-related molecules participate in signal transduction. In human granulocytes, which express C-CAM-L, CGM6, NCA and CGM 1, treatment with monoclonal antibodies against these molecules \n\nA direct approach to investigating the effects of C-CAM on tumor growth has recently been taken. In one study it was demonstrated that transfection of mouse C-CAM-L (the Bgpla gene product) into mouse colon carcinoma cells inhibited tumor development in mice of the same genetic background as the carcinoma cells [61] . In another study it was found that transfection of rat C-CAMla-L into human prostate carcinoma cells caused inhibition of tumor development caused by injection of these cells into nude mice [62] . In the latter study it was furthermore demonstrated that transfection of an antisense construct decreased C-CAM expression in benign rat prostate cells In most tissues and cells there is a simultaneous expression of C-CAM-L and C-CAM-S [66] , and regulation of the L:S ratios as a means of regulating signal transduction by C-CAM is an intriguing possibility. Support for this idea comes from the finding that the expression levels of the two isoforms can indeed be regulated independently of each other in an epithelial rat cell line, NBT-II [67] . In these cells fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-I (acidic FGF) selectively upregulates the expression of C-CAM-L, and this is correlated with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.\n\nThe downstream events that are involved in signal transduction by C-CAMs are not known, but inspection of the structure of the cytoplasmic L domain ( Figure 2 ) and studies of the interactions of C-CAM both with itself and with other proteins give exciting clues to the mechanisms that might be involved. As will be seen, C-CAMs participate in a complex network of molecular interactions that may be essential both for the effects on signaling and for the regulation of enzymatic and transport activities.\n\nThe cytoplasmic L domain contains two tyrosine residues in phosphorylatable motifs ( Figure 2 ). The membraneproximal tyrosine residue (Tyr488 in rat) has been found to be phosphorylated by the insulin receptor kinase in hepatocytes [68] , by c-src in epithelial cells [69] , and by c-src [69] and lyn and hck [70] in granuiocytes. Convincing data about phosphorylation of the membrane-distal tyrosine (Tyr513 in rat) are lacking. These two tyrosine residues are part of a modified ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif), although the similarity is imperfect, as the spacing between the two tyrosines (24-26 amino acids) is greater than the spacing of 10 amino acids found in classic ITAMs [71\u00b0]. However, the proximal tyrosine is part of a perfect ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif) [72] . ITAMs and ITIMs are present in a number of membrane receptors, such as T-cell receptor complexes, B-cell receptor complexes, FcTRIIB, CD22, interleukin receptors, and natural killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs) [72,73\u00b0] . Upon phosphorylation ITAMs and ITIMs bind protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), respectively, whose actions lead to stimulation or termination of signaling with profound effects on cellular proliferation. Interestingly, different splice variants of KIRs having short or long cytoplasmic domains occur [73\u00b0]; the spacing between the two tyrosine residues in the long KIR cytoplasmic domain is 29 amino acids, which is similar to that found in the long cytoplasmic domain of C-CAMs.\n\nC-CAM can bind both PTKs and PTPs (Figure 3) . Phosphorylation of the membrane-proximal tyrosine leads to binding of c-src in colon carcinoma cells [69] , and of lyn and hck in granulocytes [70] . C-CAM-L can also bind the PTP Src homology (SH)2-domain-containing PTP-1 (SHP-1) in colon carcinoma cells [71\u00b0] . This binding requires the presence of both tyrosine residues although only the membrane-proximal tyrosine has been found to be phosphorylated. C-CAM-L is also able to bind the PTP SHP-2, and tyrosine-phosphorylated C-CAM-L is a substrate for both SHP-1 and SHP-2 (N Beauchemin, M Huber, personal communication). However, at present it is not clear if the binding of SHP-1 or SHP-2 is involved in the tumor-inhibitory effect, because mutation of Tyr488 to phenylalanine does not abrogate the tumor-inhibitory effect of rat C-CAM-L, at least not in breast carcinoma cells [64\u00b0].\n\nAnother signal-regulating protein that can bind to the cytoplasmic domains of C-CAM is calmodulin [74\u00b0]. Both C-CAM-L and C-CAM-S contain a calmodulin-binding site which is found close to the lipid bilayer ( Figure 2 ). Rodent C-CAMs also have a calmodulin-binding site in the distal portion of the cytoplasmic domain, close to the carboxy-terminal end of the cytoplasmic L domain. Binding of calmodulin to C-CAM is regulated by the intracellular calcium concentration and leads to downregulation of C-CAM self-association [74\u00b0].\n\nAnother feature of C-CAMs, which might be important for the signaling mechanisms of C-CAM, is that both the L and the S isoforms can dimerize [75\"] ( Figure 3a ). This has been demonstrated by the use of chemical cross-linkers on both intact epithelial cells and purified C-CAM in solution. The dimers are in equilibrium with the monomers, but the extent of dimerization can be controlled by the cells. Increase of the intracellular calcium concentration leads to dissociation of C-CAM dimers. This dissociation might be mediated by calmodulin, as it was found that calcium-activated calmodulin caused dissociation of C-CAM dimers in vitro [75 \u00b0] (Figure 3b ).\n\nThe C-CAM dimers are preferentially homodimers, that is, C-CAM-L dimerizes with itself and C-CAM-S dimerizes with itself [75\" ]. Both the ectodomain alone and the L domain alone can dimerize (I Hunter, B Obrink, unpublished data), which implies that the affinity of C-CAM-L for itself is higher than the affinity of C-CAM-S for itself or the affinity of C-CAM-L for C-CAM-S. As the dimerization process is in chemical equilibrium, both a change in the overall expression level of C-CAM and a shift of the ratio between the L and the S forms would alter the monomer:dimer ratio and the concentration of heterodimers.\n\nThe regulation of C-CAM expression and variation in the monomer: dimer ratio of C-CAM-L in epithelial cells could have profound influences on the regulatory and signaling activities of C-CAM, as it might affect the binding of PTKs, PTPs and other proteins (Figure 3c ). In addition to influences by calmodulin, the monomer : dimer ratio might also be regulated by phosphorylation. Both the S and the L cytoplasmic domains contain several serine/threonine residues that can be phosphorylated. Protein kinase C catalyzed phosphorylation of Ser503 in rat C-CAM-L [43] , Ser449 in rodent C-CAMs and Thr453 in human C-CAM-L (M Edlund, K Wikstr~m, R Toomik, P Ek, B Obrink, unpublished data) has been demonstrated. These phosphorylation sites are SIRPs share a number of characteristics with the C-CAMs. They are transmembrane proteins, belonging to the IgSF, with three Ig domains in the extracellular portions. Short and long cytoplasmic domains exist, the long domains having four tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated. The first tyrosine residue is part of an ITIM, and the spacing between this and the following tyrosine, as well as between the third and the fourth tyrosines, is 23 amino acids. Both SHP-1 and SHP-2, as well as Grb2 (growth factor receptor binding protein 2), bind to the long cytoplasmic domain upon tyrosine phosphorylation of the long domain, which can be catalyzed by the insulin receptor and various growth factor receptors and can be induced by cell attachment to fibronectin. SIRPs have negative effects on cellular proliferation induced by insulin and growth factors. A large number of genes and/or ailelic variants for SIRPs exist, and there are indications of various alternatively spliced products.\n\nThe structural and functional similarities between C-CAMs and SIRPs are overwhelming, and it will be interesting to see if yet other related families of signal-regulatory proteins exist. A candidate would be platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), another cell adhesion molecule of the IgSF. PECAM-1 can possess one of several differently spliced cytoplasmic domains that regulate its ligand-binding properties [78] . In two of these alternative cytoplasmic domains there are two tyrosine residues that bind SHP-2 upon phosphorylation [79\u00b0]. The first of these tyrosines is part of an ITIM and the spacing between the two tyrosines is 22 amino acids, which is similar to the spacing in C-CAMs, natural killer cell inhibitory receptors, and SIRPs. Stimulation of PECAM-1 with antibodies leads to upregulation of integrin function in leukocytes and platelets which results in increased adhesion to endothelial cells [79\u00b0].\n\nThe CEA family is a large and complex family containing several cell surface bound proteins with cell adhesion activity and signal-regulatory properties. Accumulating data show that these adhesion molecules are multifunctional and participate in the regulation of various cellular activities. The phylogenetically original cell adhesion molecules in the CEA family, the C-CAMs, affect ecto-ATPase activity, bile acid transport and receptor internalization. In addition, they function as receptors for various bacteria and for mouse hepatitis virus. Considerable progress has been made concerning the role of C-CAMs as important negative regulators of cellular and tumor growth, and much information has been collected on the supramolecular organization of C-CAMs and their interactions with various signaling molecules. The challenging tasks now will be to define how C-CAMs regulate cellular activities, which signaling mechanisms are affected, and how the various molecular interactions in which C-CAMs participate are related to these events. A central problem will be to understand the role of the different C-CAM isoforms and how they interact in the regulation of the signaling activities. It will be interesting to see if the activities of other signal-regulatory proteins with alternative cytoplasmic domains, such as SIRPs, natural killer cell inhibitory receptors, and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecules, may be regulated by similar interactions between different isoforms of these proteins.\n\nAnother important task for future analysis will be to decipher the functional roles of the "}
