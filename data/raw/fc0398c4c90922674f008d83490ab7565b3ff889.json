{"title": "Synthesis and Biological Properties of C-2 Triazolylinosine Derivatives NIH Public Access", "body": "The Cu-catalyzed version 1,2 of the classic Huisgen azide-alkyne cycloaddition 3-9 is a highly atom-economical reaction, often requiring mild conditions. Both factors render Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) highly attractive for the modification of complex and sensitive molecules such as nucleosides. We have recently reported a facile and general synthesis of C-6 azidopurine nucleosides and their use in CuAAC reactions, where some of these new compounds showed low cytostatic activity against ovarian carcinoma cell lines. 10 In general, azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions have been a highly important transformation in the chemistry of nucleosides and DNA. [11] [12] [13] To our knowledge, our previous report on the CuAAC reactions of 6-azidopurine nucleosides was the first to describe such reactions at the C-6 position of purine nucleosides. 10 On the other hand, CuAAC chemistry involving C-2 azidopurine nucleosides has been reported in the context of adenosine A 3 receptor research 14 as well as in the development of antituberculosis agents, 15 and both describe reactions of 2-azidoadenosine analogues. In general, there are three methods for the synthesis of 2-azido adenosine derivatives. The first involves treatment of 6-amino-2-hydrazino ribofuranosylpurine with nitrous acid, 16 the second is a Cu-catalyzed azidation of tri-O-silyl 6-amino-2-iodo ribofuranosylpurine, 17 and the third involves diazotization/azidation of tri-O-acetyl 2amino-6-chlororibofuranosylpurine with isoamylONO/azidotrimethylsilane (TMS-N 3 ), followed by replacement of the chloride with an amino group. 18 For the current study, we were interested in the CuAAC reactions of 2-azidoinosine and its 2\u2032-deoxy analogue. Syntheses of 2-azidoinosine derivatives are less well developed in comparison to the adenosine analogues. Reaction of 2-chloroinosinic acid with NaN 3 has been shown to yield 2-azidoinosine-5\u2032-monophosphate, which was subsequently converted to 2-azidoinosine by reaction with acid phosphatase. 19 Similarly, 2-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyinosine, which requires relatively nontrivial synthesis, 20 has been converted to the 2-azido derivative within the context of a DNA oligomer. 21 For our purposes, we needed a simple, general access to 2-azidoinosine and 2-azido-2\u2032-deoxyinosine. In this paper we report the synthesis of suitable O 6 -protected 2-azidoinosine derivatives and their applicability toward CuAAC reactions. We have evaluated the anticancer and antiviral properties of C-2 (1,2,3triazol-1H-yl) inosine and 2\u2032-deoxyinosine analogues after appropriate deprotection protocols. We also report methodology for conversion of C-2 triazolylinosine derivatives to adenosine analogues via their O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl) derivatives, as well as the development of doubly reactive 2-azido-O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl)purine ribonucleoside.\n\nWe have recently reported that O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl)inosine and guanosine derivatives, as well as the corresponding 2\u2032-deoxy analogues, are exceptionally effective reagents for the introduction of substituents at the C-6 position of these purine nucleosides. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] On the basis of these results, we reasoned that O 6 -allylguanosine and 2\u2032-deoxyguanosine would be excellent precursors for the present work. 25 We have previously developed the synthesis of 2-chloro-3\u2032,5\u2032-di-O-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-2\u2032-deoxyinosine from an O 6 -allyl-2\u2032deoxyguanosine precursor, 27 and as reported for 2-chloroinosinic acid, 19 this can potentially be used to generate the 2-azidoinosine derivative. Despite this, as shown in Scheme 1, it is more expeditious to directly install the azido group at the C-2 position by diazotization of the amino group in the presence of TMS-N 3 . 18 Silyl-protected O 6 -allyl-2-azidoinosine 2a(A) and the 2\u2032-deoxyinosine analogue 2b(A) could be synthesized via this procedure in ca. 60% yield. C-2 azido derivatives of purines 28, 29 and purine nucleosides 16, [30] [31] [32] [33] can exist in equilibrium with two possible tetrazolyl isomers. Similarly, 2a,b can exist as two tautomers termed 2a,b(T 1 ) and 2a,b(T 3 ), depending upon the nitrogen atom of the purine that is involved. Among the two azide derivatives, synthesis of 2b from the C-2 triflate has been reported in 26% yield, and this compound was reported not to display any tetrazole tautomer. 34 In our case, assessment by 1 H NMR indicated that both 2a and 2b exist predominantly as the azide 2a(A) and 2b(A) (\u2265 90% in CDCl 3 , acetone-d 6 , and DMSO-d 6 ) . Consistent with this, IR spectra of 2a and 2b showed absorptions at 2126 and 2130 cm \u22121 , respectively. By comparison, 2-azidoadenosine derivatives demonstrated 17-55% of the tetrazolyl isomer. 14, 15, 30, 31, 33 Apart from factors such as temperature and solvent polarity, 31, 33 the electronic nature of substituents also influences the azide/tetrazole ratio of purinyl derivatives. 33 Whereas electron-donating substituents favor the ring-closed tetrazolyl form, the azide form is preferred with electronwithdrawing groups. 33 The significantly greater proportion of the azido rather than the tetrazolyl forms of 2-azidoinosine derivatives 2a,b as compared to the 2-azidoadenosines is possibly linked to this substituent effect. Between the two tetrazolyl forms, the T 1 form is generally invoked for nucleosides. 14, 15, 32, 33 With the synthesis of the C-2 azido derivatives 2a,b completed, conditions for effectuating their ligation reactions with alkynes were evaluated (Table 1 ). In previous work with 6azidopurine nucleosides, we had observed that reduction of the azide to the amine was a competing process and that biphasic conditions were essential in order to obtain satisfactory azide-alkyne ligation. 10 Interestingly, application of those conditions here resulted in an unsatisfactory outcome (entry 1). Switching the solvent to 1:1 t-BuOH/H 2 O gave an improved result (entry 2). Cu(I) thiophene-2-carboxylate as the catalyst gave a modest improvement (entry 3), whereas CuCl proved to be the best under the conditions tested, affording a product yield of 82% (entry 4). Therefore, the generality of azide-alkyne ligation chemistry was next investigated using both the ribose derivative 2a as well as the 2\u2032-deoxy analogue 2b. Results from these experiments are summarized in Table 2 .\n\nWith a series of O 6 -protected C-2 triazolylinosine and 2\u2032-deoxyinosine derivatives available, deprotection of the products became the focus. Two possible sequences could be envisioned; either deprotection of the O 6 -allyl group followed by desilylation or vice versa. Desilylation by Et 3 N\u2022HF followed by deallylation was the preferred order. This is because we have noted that nucleoside desilylations with amine\u2022HF complexes can leave a fluoride contaminant in some instances, which can be difficult to eliminate. Hence, our chosen deprotection sequence offers the possibility to chromatographically purify the products of desilylation prior to deallylation. We also generally recommend checking products of desilylation by 19 F NMR. Several conditions were tested for this purpose: Pd 2 (dba) 3 /(\u00b1)-BINAP with morpholine in THF, Pd 2 (dba) 3 /(\u00b1)-BINAP with Et 2 NH 2 + HCO 3 \u2212 , in CH 2 Cl 2 , and Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 with sodium benzenesulfinate (PhSO 2 Na) in THF. The first two sets of conditions were not very successful, but use of Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 /PhSO 2 Na proved optimal. Scheme 2 shows the products prepared by deprotection.\n\nHaving synthesized a series of C-2 triazolylinosine and 2\u2032-deoxyinosine analogues, which can also be considered as modified guanine nucleosides by virtue of the C-2 nitrogen atom, we considered methodology for facile synthesis of C-2 triazolyladenosine analogues (derivatives of 2,6-diaminopurine nucleosides). For this purpose, our previously described methodology for activation of the amide linkage, via the O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl) derivative, appeared to be a reasonable approach. 22, 25, 26 As shown in Scheme 3, deallylation of 3 followed by exposure of the resulting silylprotected C-2 triazolylinosine derivative to 1H-benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) and i-Pr 2 NEt in THF at room temperature led to the formation of the corresponding O 6 -(benzotriazolyl) derivative 31 in 55% yield. Reactions of 31 with morpholine and benzyl amine were conducted in 1,2dimethoxyethane (DME) to yield the adenosine derivatives 32 and 33 in 77% and 90% yields, respectively. The products were then desilylated to yield the C-2 triazolyl adenosine analogues 34 and 35.\n\nThe foregoing experiments clearly showed that azide-alkyne ligation could be effectively utilized to synthesize C-2 triazolyl nucleoside analogues. This in combination with chemistry leading to O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl)purine nucleosides produces a powerful new approach to difunctionalization at C-2 and C-6 of the purine scaffold. At this point, we considered whether an appropriately functionalized, doubly reactive purine nucleoside derivative could be obtained. Therefore, the synthesis of a 2-azido-O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl)purine nucleoside derivative was investigated. This would not only allow us to evaluate the stability of the benzotriazolyl moiety to the diazotization/azidation conditions but also provide a route to novel reactive nucleosides that can be difunctionalized at the C-2 and the C-6 positions of the purine. In this context, hydroxyl-protected O 6 -(benzotriazolyl)guanosine derivatives have been converted to the C-2 halo (F, Cl, and I) purine nucleosides. 35 We chose to diazotize O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl)-2\u2032,3,5\u2032-tri-O-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)guanosine (37) 25 with t-BuONO/ TMS-N 3 (Scheme 4), along the lines of previously published methods. 18, 31 This reaction gave a 49% unoptimized yield of 38 indicating the general stability of the O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl) group to the reaction conditions. The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of 38 in CDCl 3 showed the presence of three isomers, presumably the azide and the two tetrazolyl forms (T 1 and T 3 ). For example, three singlets are observed in the 1 H NMR spectrum (\u03b4 8.63, 8.58, and 8.55 ppm) corresponding to the purinyl resonances. Although only two resonances are observed for H-1\u2032 (\u03b4 6.16 and 6.05 ppm), the HMQC spectrum clearly shows three C-1\u2032 resonances (\u03b4 89.61, 89.06, 88.99 ppm). The three H-2\u2032 resonances at \u03b4 4.58 (22%), 4.54 (42%), and 4.47 ppm (36%) ppm were used to determine the isomer ratio. At this time, no attempts have been made to assign structures to these isomers. The IR spectrum of 38 showed an absorption at 2128 cm \u22121 . Doubly reactive compounds, such as 38, with two preinstalled reactive entities can potentially be functionalized at the C-2 and the C-6 by CuAAC and S N Ar chemistry, respectively. Further work along these lines is forthcoming.\n\nThe compounds were evaluated for their antiviral activity against a broad variety of DNA and RNA viruses. Several compounds (i.e., 18, 22, and 25, see Table 3 ) showed marginal activity against cytomegalovirus (CMV), whereas the anti-CMV activity of 23 was somewhat more pronounced. Indeed, the inosine derivative 23 showed activity against CMV in human embryonic lung (HEL) cells at an EC 50 of 39-73 \u03bcM. None of the compounds showed antiviral activity against other viruses at subtoxic concentrations except the inosine derivative 17 that was endowed with moderate antivesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) activity (27 \u00b1 2.4 \u03bcM) in human cervix carcinoma HeLa cell cultures. This activity could not be confirmed in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblast cell cultures against the same virus, making the moderate activity rather cell-type specific. Yet, in the HeLa and HEL cell cultures toxicity of 17 was observed at 100-240 \u03bcM. This may also mean that the anti-VSV activity noticed for 17 in the VSV/HeLa cell assay can be due to underlying toxicity to the host cells, rather than to a specific antiviral activity of the compound. From the antiviral assay systems performed, compound 34 had the highest impact on mammalian cell morphology, but this highly depended on the nature of the cell line used as the virus host [minimum detectable morphology-altering (cytotoxic) concentration (MCC): 8.3 \u03bcM against canine kidney MDCK, 42 \u03bcM against HeLa, 83 \u03bcM against feline kidney CRFK, 210 \u03bcM against green monkey kidney Vero, and \u2265 40 \u03bcM against HeLa cells].\n\nThe inosine derivatives 17-24 and 2\u2032-deoxyinosine derivatives 25-30 were also evaluated for their cytostatic activity against murine leukemia L1210, human lymphocyte CEM, and HeLa cells. Modest cytostatic activity was noticed for several compounds. In particular, the HeLa cells were usually somewhat more sensitive to the inhibitory potential of these compounds than the other cell lines. Also, the ribose derivatives were consistently more cytostatic than their corresponding 2\u2032-deoxyribose derivatives. Among all compounds tested, 17 proved most cytostatic, irrespective the nature of the tumor cell line (IC 50 : 34-124 \u03bcM). Both adenosine derivatives 34 and 35 were poorly cytostatic (IC 50 for 34 98-185 \u03bcM, for 35 90-120 \u03bcM).\n\nAll of the newly synthesized C-2 triazolyl nucleoside analogues were also tested for their antiproliferative activity using human ovarian cancer 1A9 cells and their paclitaxel-resistant clones, 1A9-PTX10 and 1A9-PTX22, and colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells and their clones ( Table 4 ). Several compounds were modestly active against 1A9 and 1A9-PTX22, but all were inactive against 1A9-PTX10. Adenosine derivatives 34 and 35 showed the best activity against 1A9, and among the two, 34 bearing a morpholinyl group at C-6 was most active (0.18 \u03bcM). Inosine derivative 21 with a phthalimido triazolyl substituent also showed activity at < 10 \u03bcM. Against HCT116, only 34 showed notable activity (3.7 \u03bcM) and this compound was also active against HCT116 p53 knockout cells, albeit at a higher concentration (10.4 \u03bcM). In the series, adenosine derivative 34 emerged as the most interesting cytostatic candidate showing activity against 1A9, 1A9-PTX22, HCT116, and HCT116 p53 knockout cells.\n\nIn this paper, we describe syntheses of O 6 -allyl-2-azidoinosine and 2\u2032-deoxyinosine derivatives and their use in CuAAC reactions. In contrast to the C-6 azidopurine nucleosides, these C-2 azides do not exhibit significant azide\u2022tetrazole equilibrium, and the azido form appears to predominate. In comparison, C-2 azidoadenosine analogues show a greater proportion of the tetrazolyl form. This is possibly linked to the greater electronwithdrawing allyloxy group at the C-6 position in the present cases. The products from the CuAAC reactions were desilylated and evaluated for their potential antiviral activity. Unfortunately, none of the compounds proved antivirally active at subtoxic concentrations with the exception of compound 17 that was endowed with a moderate inhibitory activity against vesicular stomatitis virus and compound 23, which showed activity against cytomegalovirus. It is, however, currently unclear whether the anti-VSV activity is a specific antiviral effect or due to underlying compound toxicity.\n\nThe C-2 triazolylinosine nucleosides, which can be considered as modified guanine analogues, were also converted to the O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl) derivatives. S N Ar substitution of the benzotriazolyloxy group with amines then furnished C-2 triazolyl adenosine analogues. In addition, we have converted silyl-protected O 6 -(benzotriazol-1Hyl)guanosine to a doubly reactive 2-azido-O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl)purine nucleoside derivative. Interestingly, based upon the NMR results, this compound appears to exist as the azide and two tetrazolyl isomers. This nucleoside derivative, which can react at the C-2 via CuAAC and at the C-6 via S N Ar, should find broad utility in greatly diversifying the purine nucleoside scaffold via generally simple operational procedures.\n\nThin layer chromatography was performed on 250 \u03bcm silica plates, and column chromatographic purifications were performed on 200-300 mesh silica gel. CH 2 Cl 2 was distilled over CaCl 2 , THF and 1,2-DME were distilled over LiAlH 4 and then over Na prior to use. All other reagents were obtained from commercial sources and were used as received. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded at 500 MHz, in the solvents indicated, and are referenced to residual protonated solvent resonance. 13 C NMR data were recorded at 125 MHz in the solvents indicated and are referenced to the solvent resonance. In all cases, for HRMS analyses ESI ionization and a TOF analyzer were used. Although 1a and 1b are reported in the literature, 25 larger scale syntheses are described below. 13 was added dropwise, followed by the addition of tet-BuONO (5.67 mL, 45.1 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at \u221220 \u00b0C for 1 h, then brought to room temperature, and allowed to stir for 24 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with MeOH:H 2 O (1:1), allowed to stir for 1 h, and then extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (3 \u00d7 25 mL). The organic layer was washed with water and brine. Evaporation of the solvent followed by chromatographic purification on a silica gel column using 15% acetone in hexanes afforded 1.83 g (59% yield) of 2a as a thick, pale-yellow oil. R f ( Table 2 for reaction times). The reaction mixture was diluted with CH 2 Cl 2 and washed with water followed by brine. The organic layer was dried over Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. Chromatographic purification on a silica gel column using 20% EtOAc in hexanes afforded 461.0 mg (82% yield) of 3 as an off-white foam. R f (SiO 2 /20% EtOAc in hexanes) = 0.57. 1 13 0.21, 0.19, 0.14, 0.12, 0.05, and \u2212 0.03 (6s, 18H, SiCH 3 ). 13 13 \n\nStep 1: desilylation: Et 3 N\u20223HF (389 \u03bcL, 2.39 mmol) was added to a solution of 3 (380.0 mg, 0.47 mmol) in dry THF (5.0 mL), and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The mixture was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas using a polypropylene pipet. The crude product was purified by chromatography on silica gel column using 10% MeOH in EtOAc to give 171. \n\nStep 1: desilylation: Using the procedure described for the desilylation of 17, this compound was synthesized from 4 (300.0 mg, 0.371 mmol) and Et 3 \n\nStep 1: desilylation: \n\nStep 1: desilylation: Using the procedure described for the desilylation of 17, this compound was synthesized from 6 (210.0 mg, 0.280 mmol) and Et 3 \n\nStep 1: desilylation: Using the procedure described for the desilylation of 17, this compound was synthesized from 7 (350.0 mg, 0.428 mmol) and Et 3 N\u20223HF (348 \u03bcL, 2.14 mmol). \n\nStep 1: desilylation: Using the procedure described for the desilylation of Step 2: deallylation: The desilylated product (95.0 mg, 0.156 mmol) obtained in step 1 was deallylated as described for 17 using Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 (9.0 mg, 5 mol %) and \n\nStep 1: desilylation: Using the procedure described for the desilylation of \n\nStep 1: desilylation: Using the procedure described for the desilylation of Step 2: deallylation: The desilylated product (24.0 mg, 0.048 mmol) obtained in step 1 was deallylated as described for 17 using Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 (2.8 mg, 5 mol %) and PhSO 2 Na ( \n\nStep 1: desilylation: Using the procedure described for the desilylation of \n\nStep 1: desilylation: \n\nStep 1: desilylation: \n\nStep 1: desilylation: \n\nStep \n\nIn a clean, dry reaction vial equipped with a stirring bar was placed 31 (50.0 mg, 0.057 mmol) in dry DME (2 mL). Morpholine (20.0 \u03bcL, 0.229 mmol) was added, the reaction mixture was flushed with nitrogen gas, and allowed to stir at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture was evaporated, the residue was dissolved in EtOAc and washed with water containing a small amount of NaCl. The aqueous layer was separated and reextracted with EtOAc. The combined organic layer was dried over Na 2 SO 4 and evaporated to dryness. Chromatographic purification of the crude material on a silica gel column using 20% EtOAc in hexanes afforded 36.1 mg (77% yield) of 32 as a white foam. R f (SiO 2 /30% EtOAc in hexanes) = 0.70. 1 \n\nThe cytostatic effects of the test compounds on murine leukemia cells (L1210), human Tlymphocyte cells (CEM) and human cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa) were evaluated as follows: an appropriate number of cells suspended in growth medium were allowed to proliferate in 200-\u03bcL-wells of 96-well-microtiter plates in the presence of variable amounts of test compounds at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified CO 2 -controlled atmosphere. After 48 h (L1210), 72 h (CEM) or 96 h (HeLa), the number of cells was counted in a Coulter counter. The IC 50 value is defined as the concentration required to inhibit cell proliferation by 50%. The methodology of the anti-HIV assays was as follows: human CEM (~3 \u00d7 10 5 cells/mL) cells were infected with 100 CCID 50 of HIV(III B ) or HIV-2(ROD)/mL and seeded in 200 \u03bcL wells of a microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds. After 4 days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, HIV-induced CEM giant cell formation was examined microscopically. The 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) was defined as the compound concentration required to inhibit syncytia formation by 50%. The 50% cytostatic concentration (CC 50 ) was defined as the compound concentration required to inhibit CEM cell proliferation by 50% in comparison to mock-infected cell cultures.\n\nDetermination of GI 50 s using ovarian cancer and colon carcinoma cell lines were essentially as described. 10,36-38 A 10 mM stock solution of paclitaxel (PTX), obtained from the Drug Synthesis Branch of the National Cancer Institute, was prepared in DMSO. Control samples contained 1% (v/v) DMSO vehicle, a level equivalent to that in the drug-treated cultures.\n\nOvarian cancer cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% carbon dioxide incubator. 1A9/PTX10 and 1A9/PTX22 cells were maintained in the presence of 15 ng/mL PTX and 5 \u03bcg/mL verapamil. This medium was replaced with regular medium two to three days before plating the cells in 96 well plates. HCT116 and p53KO \u2212/\u2212 cell lines were maintained in McCoy medium with 10% fetal bovine serum.\n\nCells were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates for 48 h and the compounds (prepared in 100% DMSO as a stock solution) were added in quadruplicate. At least five different concentrations were tested for each compound. In each experiment, one plate consisted entirely of cells and medium used for time zero cell number determination, at the time/day of addition of compounds. After four days, 20 \u03bcL of Promega Cell Titer reagent was added into each well and plates were incubated in the tissue culture incubator. Approximately 2 h later, the plates were read using a plate reader at 490 nm minus 630 nm absorbance wavelengths. The data was then analyzed using an Excel Spreadsheet grid. Resulting average values ranging from < 50 or > 50 cell culture expansion for two or more concentrations were used to calculate the GI 50 . b Yields are of isolated and purified products. "}
