{"title": "AN ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY FOR IDENTIFICATION AND QUANTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS MURINE PARVOVIRUS IN CULTURED CELLS", "body": "Conventionally-housed laboratory rodents commonly sustain infection with one or more viral agents (Foster et al., 1982) . Since some of these infections are known or thought to affect the outcome of experimental procedures, it is important to understand their pathogenesis and natural history. The execution of studies designed to elucidate the biology of rodent virus infections requires the ability to detect and quantify infectious virus in large numbers of clinical specimens. Because of the high transmission potential of many of these agents, alternatives to animal inoculation are desirable. Many rodent viruses do not induce morphologic changes in inoculated cell cultures, necessitating the use of immunochemical probes to detect viral antigens. We have used the fluorescent focus test for detection and quantification (Smith, 1983; Smith et al., 1984) ; however, the procedure is expensive and labor-intensive. It is particularly cumbersome when applied to large numbers of samples. Smith et al. (1981) reported quantification of herpes, mumps and measles viruses in unfixed cultured cells using the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) . Recently, Yong-He et al. (1984) reported the use of EIA to detect several flaviviruses in cultured cells which were formalin-fixed prior to processing. In the case of rodent viruses, viral inactivation prior to EIA is desirable to protect animals housed in the vicinity of the laboratory, as well as personnel in the case of zoonotic viruses.\n\nIn this paper, we report the application of EIA methodology to detection and \n\nThe immunosuppressive (MVM(i)) and prototype (MVM(p)) strains of minute virus of mice were obtained from Dr. Peter Tattersall (Department of Human Genetics, Yale University) and were passaged once in BHK21 cells. Virus stocks used for tissue culture inoculation were in the form of crude BHK21 celllysates. Virus obtained from Dr. Tattersall was also used to inoculate neonatal Crl: CFlBr mice intracerebrally to generate clinical material for testing.\n\nAscitic fluid containing polyclonal antibody to MVM(i) was prepared by injecting multiparous female Crl : CFl Br mice intraperitoneally at weekly intervals with infected infant mouse brain emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant. Mouse ascitic fluid containing antibody to a mouse brain-adapted rat coronavirus, sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), was similarly prepared for use as a control reagent. Hyperimmune rabbit antiserum to MVM(p) was obtained from Dr. Tattersall.\n\nCell cultures C6 rat glioma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (DMEM 95-5). Cells were added in a volume of 0.1 ml to 96-well cluster dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) or in a volume of 0.5 ml to 4-chamber Lab Tek slides (Miles Laboratories, Naperville, IL) at densities of 1-2 X IO3 or 5-10 X 103, respectively. Culture vessels were maintained in humidified chambers in a 37\u00b0C 5% CO, atmosphere. Cultures were inoculated within 3 h of seeding.\n\nFor the fluorescent focus test, 10% tissue homogenates or IO-fold virus dilutions in volumes of 0.3 ml were added to chambers of Lab Tek slides containing C6 cells. After a 1 h absorption period at 37\"C, the virus inocula were removed, and the cells were washed once with DMEM 95-5. Medium (1 ml per chamber) was added, and the cultures were maintained for periods outlined in the results, Acetone-fixed cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid to MVM(i) diluted 1 : 50 and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Antibodies Inc., Davis, CA) diluted 1 : 50 and containing 0.01% Evans blue (Roboz  Surgical Instruments Co., Washington, DC). Glycerol-mounted slides were viewed with an Olympus BH-2 transmission fluorescence microscope, and single cells or foci containing viral antigen were counted at 100 or 40 diameters, respectively. \n\nLog dilutions of hyperimmune rabbit antiserum to MVM(p) were mixed in 96-well transfer plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Inc., Alexandria, VA) with equal volumes of virus suspensions containing either 100 or 1,000 median infectious doses of MVM(p). After 1 h at 37\u00b0C the mixtures were added to newly seeded C6 cells in cluster dishes. After 4 days, the cells were fixed and processed through the EIA protocol outlined above. The hyperimmune rabbit antibody reduced infectivity of MVM(p) or MVM(i) in plaque assays by 90% when diluted 1 : 10,000 (Tattersall and Bratton, 1983) .\n\nOptical density (O.D.) values were considered significant if they exceeded by 3 SD the mean value for control wells in the same assay. Virus titers measured by the EIA were calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (1938) . Fluorescent focus titers were calculated by the method described by Lorenz and Bogel (1973) .\n\nIn an early experiment, C6 cells inoculated with log dilutions of MVM(p) and held for 4 days were treated with ( In the next experiment, cells in cluster dishes and Lab Tek slides were inoculated in paralIe1 with MVM(p) dilutions and fixed for EIA and IFA, respectively, on day 2,4,5 or 6 (cluster dishes only on day 6). ID,, and fluorescent focus unit (FFU) titers were calculated for each day ( Table 2 ). The virus titer as determined by fluorescent focus test did not change with time, although the size of countable foci did increase. The titer calculated from the EIA increased significantly between day 2 and day 4, plateau&g on day 5 at the same level as the fluorescent focus titer.\n\nWe next wished to determine whether MVM infectivity was being inactivated by the glutaraldehyde fixation, since processing of large numbers of plates in a biological safety cabinet was cumbersome.\n\nCells were inoculated with 3,000 or 30,000 ID,, of either MVM(p) or MVMfi) and held for 4 days. Supernatant culture fluid was collected from wells prior to treatment with 0.02% glutaraldehyde and at 2, 6, and 24 h after fixation. Viral infectivity was measured by fluorescent focus assay. Infectivity of MVM(i) was reduced by about 70% at 24 h post-fixation. Infectivity of MVM(p) was unaltered by treatment with this concentration of glutaraldehyde, even at 24 h.\n\nSince viral inactivation was not achieved with 0.02% glutaraldehyde and since a higher concentration had resulted in unacceptable background signal, we studied the ability of neutral buffered formalin to inactivate virus in the supernates of wells inoculated with 30,000 ID,, of MVM(p). The experiment was performed only with MVM(p), since this strain had been more resistant to inactivation.\n\nFormalin at final To confirm that the reaction product detected in the EIA was specific for MVM antigen, a neutralization test using rabbit hyperimmune MVM antibody was performed (Table 3) . Using a challenge dose of 100 ID,, of MVM(p), a marginal mean O.D. value was obtained only at the highest antibody dilution tested (1: 10,000). With lo-fold more virus, there was a significant mean O.D. reading (0.97) for this antibody dilution, but the value was lower than the mean for wells inoculated with virus plus diluent (,1.51).\n\nHaving confirmed the specificity of the EIA results, we wished to determine whether the assay could be applied to clinical material (infected animal tissue). Homogenates of ' Day post-inoculation of brain collections from neonatal mice infected intracerebrally.\n\nbrains from neonatal mice inoculated intracerebrally with MVM(p~ or MVM(i) and collected on day 3,7 or 10 post-inoculation were assayed by fluorescent focus test and EIA (Table 4 ). Selected homogenates were assayed repeatedly by EIA to assess reproducibility.\n\nVirus titers determined from the two types of infectivity assays were generally similar. In some cases, fluorescent focus titers were about ten-foid higher than EIA titers. The greatest variability among independent assays was 1.0 log,, for a brain sample collected from MVM(p)-infected mice 7 days post-inoculation.\n\nThe application of EIA methodology to rodent virus quantification as described here has several advantages over previously used techniques. EIA uses a microtiter format and therefore requires small volumes of reagents and facilitates processing of large numbers of specimens. Results may be obtained without the eye fatigue induced by long periods of microscopic examination required for immunofluorescence assays. Formalin fixation prior to assay eliminates the risk of infecting animals which might be housed in the vicinity of the laboratory.\n\nYong-He et af. (1984) reported that mosquito cells fixed with 10% formalin detached during the course of the EIA. In contrast, we found that C6 rat glioma cells fixed with 3% formalin adhered to the plastic surface, while those fixed with 2% formalin did not. However, in both studies, viral antigen liberated from the fixed cells and subsequently bound to the solid phase was apparently detected. Additionally, we have shown that neutralization tests may be performed using this method. Antibody preparations used for neutralization and detection must, of course, each be made in a different species.\n\nFluorescent focus titers tended to be higher than EIA titers obtained for brain homogenates from infected infant mice. The most likely explanation for this observation is that the assays were terminated 4 days post-inoculation of C6 cells. This was necessitated by the fact that the cells had reached confluency and could not be held for an additional day. As shown in Table 2 , optimum virus titers determined by EIA are not reached until day 5. Thus, it was not surprising that EIA titers were, in some cases, about lo-fold lower than fluorescent focus titers. This problem may be rectified in the future by the use of cells seeded at lower densities. The absolute association between parvovirus replication and cell division dictates that conditions for an assay such as the one described here be fully standardized.\n\nSuch standardization may be necessarily incomplete in the clinical setting. Toxicity induced by tissue-associated enzymes may result in the death of a proportion of inoculated cells, and tissue-associated growth factors may induce cell division at a rate faster than that of control, uninoculated cells. Based on this experience with EIA applied to a murine parvovirus, we feel that the method is worthy of further development and application to other rodent viruses. The ability to assay virus in formalin-fixed cells renders the method especially attractive for the assay of agents which are known to be zoonotic, such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and Hantaviruses."}
