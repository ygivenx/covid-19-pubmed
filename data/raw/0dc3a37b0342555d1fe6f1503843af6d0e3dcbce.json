{"title": "Diagnosis and Treatment of Viral Infections Antiviral Chemotherapyand Prophylaxis of Viral Respiratory Disease", "body": "colds, currently number 100. Additionally, antigenic changes in epidemic virus strains, as occurs with influenza A, necessitate annual reformulation and administration of this vaccine. Thus, a need exists for effective antiviral agents. This article reviews antivirals useful in the prevention and treatment of respiratory viral infections. In addition to discussing those of proven clinical value (see Table l ), it concludes by briefly considering agents and approaches of investigational interest.\n\nAmantadine (1-adamantanamine) hydrochloride, the first antiviral agent licensed for treatment of respiratory virus infections in the United States, specifically inhibits the replication of influenza A viruses. This symmetric tricyclic amine (Fig. lA) , given orally, has therapeutic165. 177 and prophylactics 39, 507 lZ9, I3l efficacy in human influenza A virus infections.\n\nThe exact mechanism of action of amantadine has not been defined, but it appears to inhibit an early stage of replication, possibly uncoating of the virus within lysosomes.107~ 141 One proposed mechanism of action relates to raising the pH within lysosomes and possibly interfering with the low pH-mediated events of uncoating.12* Although amantadine is readily concentrated in the lysosomes of mammalian cells, most of the cell-associated amantadine does not appear to contribute significantly to its antiviral a~t i 0 n . l~~ Furthermore, a nonspecific effect on lysosomal pH would not explain amantadine's restricted spectrum activity. Genetic studies indicate that susceptibility of human influenza viruses to low concentrations (1 pg per ml) of amantadine is conferred by the RNA segment coding for the M (matrix) proteins of the virus, and recent evidence indicates that single amino acid changes in the transmembrane portion of the M2 protein can lead to amantadine r e s i s t a n~e .~~ AMANTADINE RIMANTADINE HYDROCHLORIDE HYDROCHLORIDE \n\nAlthough high concentrations (10 yg per ml or greater) are inhibitory for other viruses, low concentrations (1 pg per ml or less) inhibit only influenza A viruses.31 By plaque reduction assay, the 50 per cent inhibitory concentration of amantadine ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 pg per ml for most common influenza A isolates. 73 In mice, amantadine given subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, or orally before virus challenge provides dose-dependent protection against death from infl~enza.~' Therapeutic activity is observed in mice if treatment is begun as late as 72 hours after infection. Aerosolized amantadine is more efficacious than intraperitoneal administration in mice.\n\nAt high concentrations (25 to 50 pg per ml), not achievable in humans with conventional doses, lymphocyte transformation responses to mitogens and specific antigens in vitro are inhibited.l16 High doses are teratogenic in certain laboratory animals.\n\nAmantadine-resistant influenza A viruses have been recovered under laboratory conditions, when virus is passaged in the presence of amantadine. 25 97 In experimental avian influenza, amantadine-and rimantadineresistant viruses have been isolated from drug-treated birds. 167 These birds were able to infect and cause illness in contact birds that were receiving amantadine prophylaxis. Although no cases of drug resistant isolates have been reported in persons receiving amantadine for prophylaxis or therapy, the monitoring of drug susceptibilities of respiratory viruses will assume increasing importance as the use of respiratory antivirals increases. Resistant viruses have reportedly been isolated from non-drug exposed patient^.^'\n\nAmantadine is well-absorbed after oral administration with time to peak plasma levels averaging 1 to 4 hours.\" Steady-state levels are obtained within 3 days.6 Measurement of amantadine concentrations has been achieved by gas liquid chromatography with electron capture or flame ionization detection.''. lS1 After administration of 200 mg daily in divided doses, steady-state peak and trough plasma concentrations in healthy adults average 0.5 to 0.7 pg per m1\" and 0.3 pg per ml,6 respectively. During long-term administration of 6 mg per kg per day to children with cystic fibrosis, mean plasma concentrations of 0.6 kg per ml are detected. 175 Salivary and nasal mucus concentrations are similar to those in the blood.12, 85, 153 In the mouse lung, 15-to 60-fold greater concentrations are found than in the blood following oral drug administration.'' In one report the amantadine concentration in autopsy lung tissue from an infant with immunodeficiency was 21.4 pg per ml, 14-fold the serum c~ncentration.~' Despite the high concentration, viral replication was not eliminated.\n\nApproximately 90 per cent of orally administered amantadine is recovered unmetabolized in the urine.'& 164 It is excreted by glomerular filtration and probably tubular se~retion.~' The mean plasma half-life is about 12 hours (range: 9 to 31 hours) in healthy young adult^,^' which allows dosing once or twice daily. The plasma half-life increases with renal insufficiency and is over 30 days in anuric patients.\" Because of age-related decreased renal clearance, higher blood levels are also seen in the elderly5; consequently, dose reductions are indicated to reduce the risk of sideeffects. Only a small portion of the drug is removed by hemodialy~is.~'\n\nThe occurrence of dose-related side-effects may be responsible in part for the slow acceptance by clinicians of amantadine as an effective antiinfluenza agent. Central nervous system adverse effects, including nervousness, lightheadedness, difficulty concentrating, insomnia, and fatigue, are reported by 5 to 33 per cent of those receiving 200 mg per day. Loss of appetite and nausea also occur infreq~ently.~' In long-term prophylaxis studies using amantadine 200 mg daily, the excess drop-out rate due to drug side-effects has ranged from 6 to 11 per cent39. 13' ( Table 2) . During a 4-week uncontrolled prophylaxis trial involving 78 residents of a mental institution, 46 per cent had clinical manifestations compatible with adverse effects and 19 per cent had increased seizure activity on a relatively high dosage (6.6 mg per kg per day).' One third of college students taking 200 mg daily for 5 days in one study complained of difficulty concentrating or lightheadedness, and 14 per cent did not complete a 5-day course of treatment,165 whereas another study in a similar population found complete compliance despite minor symptoms.'77 Doses of 300 mg per day are associated with high rates of adverse complaints and decreased psychomotor performance on tests of sustained attention and problem-solving ability.79 Neurotoxicity is most common at plasma concentrations above 1.0 kg per mlsl and with concomitant administration of antihistamine~l~~ or anticholine r g i c~.~~~ Confusion and auditory and visual hallucinations have occurred at toxic levels in patients with renal failure.lO' Serious neurologic reactions may be transiently reversed by phys~stigmine.'~ Aerosol administration of amantadine is generally well-tolerated but causes mild local side-effects such as rhinorrhea and nasal irritation in healthy adults.80 Reversible deterioration in pulmonary function, associated with coughing and wheezing, may occur in patients with pre-existing airway abnormalities. lo8\n\nA number of controlled, blinded studies have documented the efficacy of oral amantadine for both prophylaxis and treatment of experimentally induced and natural influenza A infections. Amantadine 200 mg per day is approximately 70 to 90 per cent effective in preventing naturally acquired influenza when taken for the duration of the outbreak in the community, usually 6 to 8 weeks3' (see Table 2 ). Some amantadine recipients experience subclinical infection manifested by seroconversion. This is a desirable feature of chemoprophylaxis, because it would protect against reinfection by the same strain. Amantadine prophylaxis appears to be effective in preventing nosocomial infections in hospitals and institutions,' lZ9 among household family contacts, 50 Amantadine is an effective agent for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza A infections.165, When begun within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, a dosage of 200 mg per day is effective in decreasing the height and duration of fever, viral shedding, and the time to subjective improvement (Fig. 2 ). One study in college students found that amantadine treatment reduced the number of missed classes compared to p1aceb0.l~~ Another study in college students compared amantadine to aspirin for the treatment of influenza and found more rapid defervesence among the aspirin recipients, but amantadine recipients had significantly more rapid symptom improvement. 177 Certain abnormalities in peripheral airway function also improve more rapidly in amantadine recipient^.^'^, Higher doses of amantadine (up to 500 mg per day) have been used under uncontrolled conditions to treat influenza pneumonia,30. log but the efficacy of amantadine in treating severe influenza or its complications has not been established. Intermittent aerosolized amantadine had limited therapeutic effects in uncomplicated influenza infection^.'^ The use of aerosolized amantadine, which can achieve high levels in respiratory secretions, has not been evaluated in influenza pneumonia. Table 3 . and a detailed discussion of prophylaxis strategies has been published by the Centers for Disease Control.' The usual adult dose of amantadine for both prophylaxis and treatment is 200 mg per day orally as either single or twice daily administration. Splitting the dose may decrease the incidence of sideeffects.' The duration of administration for treatment is usually 5 to 7 days.\n\nFor prevention, the duration of use depends on the specific prophylaxis strategy (for example, 2 weeks in conjunction with immunization, or 4 to 8 weeks for seasonal prophylaxis). Amantadine dosage must be decreased in the elderly (100 ing once daily) and those with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance less than 80 ml per minute).' 5, 98 Nonelderly persons with an active seizure disorder appear to be at increased risk of seizure activity and should also be given reduced dosages (for example, 100 mg per day).' RIMANTADINE Rimantadine (alpha-methyl-1-adamantane-methylamine) hydrochloride (see Fig. lB ), a derivative of amantadine, also has specific anti-influenza A activity. Similar to amantadine, rimantadine is believed to block a late step in the intracellular uncoating of the influenza A virus. 16 Preclinical Studies Rimantadine appears to have greater intrinsic antiviral activity than amantadine.160 Rimantadine concentrations required to cause 50 per cent inhibition of influenza A virus plaque formation range from 0.1 to 0.4 pg per m1.73 Compared to amantadine, rimantadine produces significantly longer protection against influenza virus-induced cytopathic effects in ferret tracheal ciliated epithelium, and exhibits comparable protective effect at four-to eightfold lower concentration^.^' At high concentrations (16 or 32 pg per ml) rimantadine is more toxic for uninfected epithelium than is amantadine. Is In mice, subcutaneous rimantadine has greater therapeutic efficacy against influenza than does equimolar doses of amantadine.160 Prophylactic intraperitoneal rimantadine, beginning 24 hours prior to virus inoculation, results in lower pulmonary virus titers, less severe lung lesions, diminished antibody response, and decreased capability to transmit infection to contact animals, compared with amantadine or ~1 a c e b o . l~~\n\nPassage of influenza A virus in the presence of rimantadine leads to the development of resistance. 17 One study found that in vitro passage of an H2N2 virus in the presence of amantadine resulted in resistance to amantadine but only slight resistance to rimantadine, whereas passage in the presence of rimantadine resulted in marked resistance to amantadine with only slight resistance to rimantadine.\"jO Rimantadine-resistant viruses have been isolated from birds treated with this\n\nRecently, rimantadine treatment of children was associated with prolonged viral shedding and recovery of resistant isolates.66A, 158A\n\nDespite their structural similarity (see Fig. l ), significant differences exist between amantadine and rimantadine kinetics in man. Rimantadine has a longer plasma half-life, lower plasma concentrations, and different metabolism than amantadine. Rimantadine has good oral bioavailability but relatively slow absorption with time to peak plasma levels of 3 to 6 At steady-state in young adults given dosages of 100 mg twice daily, peak plasma concentrations are approximately 0.4 pg per mLB1 In an elderly population receiving 100 mg twice daily for 3 months, peak steady-state plasma levels average 1.2 pg per ml. 130 In healthy adults the plasma half-life averages 24 to 36 hours. 85, 164 Rimantadine undergoes extensive metabolism with subsequent renal elimination of metabolites. Less than 10 per cent of the parent drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. The elimination half-life is increased about 50 per cent in dialysis patients, but hemodialysis does not remove significant amounts of rimantadine. Rimantadine concentrations are determined by gas chromatography using methods similar to those for amantadine but with modified initial derivatization steps.\"\n\nFollowing single 200-mg doses, the maximum nasal mucus concentrations of rimantadine and amantadine are similar, and the ratio of nasal mucus to plasma concentration is about twofold higher for rimantadine. 85 These findings suggest that rimantadine may be concentrated in respiratory secretions, a result that could explain rimantadine's comparable efficacy, despite lower plasma concentrations than for amantadine.\", 85 Toxicity At equivalent dosages of 200 to 300 mg per day, rimantadine is associated with fewer side-effects than is amantadine, and this represents the major clinical advantage of rimantadine. In particular, central nervous system toxicity is uncommon in recipients of rimantadine 200 mg per day79, 165 and withdrawals due to adverse effects occur less often than with amantadine3', (see Table 2 ). At a dosage of 300 mg per day for 4% days, 3 per cent of rimantadine recipients considered their work performance impaired, compared with 30 per cent of amantadine recipient^.^' Aerosolized rimantadine has been associated with an unpleasant taste or smell and nasal irritation. 89 \n\nThe prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of rimantadine is similar to that of amantadine in naturally occurring influenza A infections. Most studies have been conducted at dosages of 200 to 300 mg per day, although some reports suggest that as little as 50 mg per day is effective for prophy1a~is.l~~ A dosage of 200 mg per day is approximately 85 per cent effective in preventing laboratory-documented influenza illness (see Table  2 ).39 Among children receiving prophylaxis, rimantadine 5 mg per kg per day reduced the influenza A infection rate from 32 to 3 per cent and provided complete protection against influenza A illness. 24 In previously vaccinated nursing home residents, rimantadine was 75 per cent effective in preventing influenza-like illness, compared to placebo. 38 One study comparing rimantadine and amantadine given 100 mg twice daily for treatment of uncomplicated influenza found slightly more rapid improvement over the first 24 hours of treatment in the amantadine recipients (see Fig. 2 ). Thereafter, similar functional recovery and reductions in symptoms and viral shedding occurred in both groups, with fewer side-effects in the rinlantadine recipients. 165 Another study used a modified loading regimen so that patients received 400 to 500 mg of rimantadine over the first 24 hours and found rapid reductions in viral titers and fever, compared to placebo. 86 In treatment of children with influenza, rimantadine was associated with more rapid symptom improvement and defervescence compared to acetaminophen in one but not another.lS8* Aerosolized rimantadine for treatment of experimentally induced influenza infection has effects compared to 150 mg per day of rimantadine orally.89 Rimantadine is expected to be licensed for oral use in the United States in the near future. Its indications for clinical use are the same as those for amantadine (see Table 3 ).\n\nRibavirin (1-6-D-ribofuranosyl-l,2,4-triazole-3 carboxamide) is a synthetic nucleoside analog of guanosine (Fig. 3 ). Its antiviral spectrum includes a variety of DNA and RNA viruses, in particular influenza A and B, parainfluenza, and RSV viruses.100, 146, lS0 Such an agent would have clinical application where serious illness inay be caused by any of these viruses and where clinical features are not distinctive enough to allow an etiologic diagnosis. Because of limited effectiveness and concerns regarding hematologic toxicity when ribavirin is given orally, recent studies have focused on aerosol administration. \n\nSeveral different mechanisms of antiviral action have been ~r o~o s e d for r i b a~i r i n .~~ Ribavirin monophosphate acts as a feedback inLibiior of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of guanine n~c1eotides.l~~ Ribavirin triphosphate inhibits steps in the capping and elongation of the messenger RNA of certain viruses.172 It appears to directly interfere with the influenza virus RNA polymerase complex. In certain test systems ribavirin concentrations of 5 to 25 pg per ml inhibit cellular macromolecular synthesis, cell growth, and lymphocyte proliferative responses. '12, 140, 174 Ribavirin has additional biologic activities including inhibition of humoral antibody responses, and antitumor effects. 139, 152 Preclinical Studies\n\nThe 50 per cent plaque inhibitory concentrations of ribavirin range from approximately 3 to 9 pg per ml for influenza A and B viruses,14. \" 3 to 10 pg per ml for respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV),\" and from 10 to 12 pg per ml for parainfluenza viruses. l3 By plaque reduction assay in canine kidney (MDCK) cells, influenza A viruses appear to be 10-fold less sensitive to ribavirin than amantadine,13, \" but by yield reduction assay in primary rhesus monkey kidney cells, ribavirin appears to be more active than rimantadine. 87 Aerosolized ribavirin initiated at 6 hours after infection in mice significantly lowers virus titers and prevents pneumonia in experimental influenza infections, whereas similar beneficial effects are not observed with aerosolized amantadine or rimantadine. 166 Relatively brief aerosol exposures (2 hours, twice daily) to high concentrations of ribavirin provides protection comparable to that observed with longer treatments (11 hours per day) at threefold lower concentration^.'^^ Ferrets treated with ribavirin and subsequently infected with influenza virus do not develop a typical febrile reaction or serum or local antibodies, and have 10-fold lower virus titers in nasal washings than untreated animals.I3' Recent studies have shown that intravenous administration of liposome-encapsulated ribavirin is more effective in the treatment of experimental murine influenza than higher doses of free ribavirin given by the same route.54 High doses are embryotoxic in rabbits and rats, and teratogenic in rats but not baboons.9G\n\nDevelopment of resistance has not been observed during the treatment of human influenza170 or RSV2, 64, 'I9 infections ' with aerosolized ribavirin. Passage of RSV in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of ribavirin does not select viruses resistant to the drug.\"\n\nLimited information is available concerning the pharmacokinetics of ribavirin because of the lack of routine means for measurement. Bv radioimmunoassay, the plasma half-life averages approximately 9 hours (range: 5.0 to 13.5 hours).'G3 Using orally administered 14-C labeled ribavirin, it has been found that 53 per cent of the dose is excreted in the urine.22 Radioactivity is concentrated in red blood cells with an apparent half-life of 40 days. 22 The approved use of ribavirin for viral respiratory disease in the United States is currently limited to administration by small-particle aerosol for the treatment of RSV infections. Generators have been designed to produce particles of aerodynamic size averaging 1.5 nm in diameter. Using radiolabeled tracers, inhalation of this aerosol mist by uninfected adults produces uniform distribution of about 70 per cent of the inhaled particles throughout the respiratory tract.log Mean peak respiratory secretion levels up to 1900 pg per ml have been measured after 8 hours of exposure in children. 28 Plasma concentrations depend on the duration of exposure and average 0.9 pg per ml and 1.5 p g per ml after 8 hours of exposure daily for 2 and 3 days, r e~p e c t i v e l y .~~ The elimination half-life of ribavirin in respiratory secretions is approximately 2 hours.28\n\nOral ribavirin administration has been associated with reversible decreases in red blood cell counts. increases in serum bilirubin. and reticul o~y t o s i s , '~~ which are most likely due to ribavirin accumulation in, and toxicity for, circulating red blood cells. Hematologic toxicity has not been observed with aerosolized treatments. l o 64. 6G. 'I7, Aerosol administration has been reported to cause bronchospasin in some adults with pre-existing airway disease, but has been well-tolerated when used for treatment of RSV infections in children. One case of transient redness of the eyelids has been described, presumably due to deposition of the drug on the skin.'' Potential problems with the drug delivery system are discussed in the next section. \n\nRespiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Ribavirin by small particle aerosol is effective in the treatment of experimentaP6 and naturallo, 62' 64, 144, 1 5 ' RSV infections. In infants with naturally acquired RSV lower respiratory tract disease, ribavirin given by continuous aerosol for 3 to 6 days causes more rapid improvement in illness severity and arterial oxygenation, and after several days of treatment decreases in viral titers in respiratory secretions, compared to placebo.64 In infants with underlying cardiopulmonary disease and RSV lower respiratory tract infection, ribavirin recipients experience similar clinical benefits (Fig. 4) . Decreases in virus titers in respiratory secretions occur by the third day of treatment.62 Infants with RSV bronchiolitis treated with aerosolized ribavirin for 12 hours daily for 5 days have more rapid recovery from illness but no difference in virus shedding than those receiving placebo.15' A recent study of infants with bronchiolitis treated with aerosolized ribavirin for 18 hours daily for at least 3 days found more rapid declines in respiratory and heart rates, compared to placebo.1\u00b0 In children with RSV infection, RSV-specific IgE and IgA antibody responses develop less frequently in nasopharyngeal secretions after treatment with aerosolized ribavirin, compared to untreated controls.44 The long-term benefits or consequences of using ribavirin for treatment of RSV infections have not been determined.\n\nA specific generator unit is required for administration. Aerosol exposure has been given for 12 to 24 hours per day for 3 to 6 days using a reservoir concentration of 20 gm per ml to achieve an hourly dose of approximately 0.82 mg per kg per h o~r . '~ The usual daily dosage of ribavirin costs about $250 to the hospital pharmacy, and treatment costs may exceed $500 per day when respiratory therapy charges are included.\n\nA consensus regarding which infants should receive this newly available therapy has not been reached. During a winter RSV epidemic, therapy might be appropriate for an illness consistent with RSV in an infant in one of the high-risk groups (congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, or cystic fibrosis). Another potential indication for therapy is the group of presumed RSV-infected infants who manifest progressive deterioration likely to result in intubation.\"' Candidates include those with PaO, levels lower than 65 mm Hg or with rising Pa,,, levels.4A In such cases, ribavirin could be started while awaiting results of rapid viral diagnostic tests. More controversial is its early use in RSV-infected infants who are not seriously compromised, or in infants already on ventilators, which may become clogged by the drug.ll'. lG9 Use of in-line filters may ameliorate this problem. Precipitation has also been reported with delivery of the drug in an infant receiving oxygen through a hood.93 For these reasons, frequent routine checking of the tubing and equipment is e~sential.'~ Another concern, currently under study, is contamination of the environment and possible exposure of hospital personnel to ribavirin. Recent studies have not found ribavirin in the urine or sera of such p e r~o n n e l .~~ Influenza. Prophylactic oral administration of ribavirin 1000 mg per day reduces illness severity and virus titers in experimental influenza A infections,'l5 but the same dose beginning within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms has no clinical benefit or inhibitory effects on viral shedding in natural influenza A infections.15' Prophylactic oral ribavirin 600 mg per day has marginal effectiveness against experimental influenza B15' and no activity against influenza A infecti~n.~'\n\nAerosolized ribavirin provides some therapeutic benefit in young adults with uncomplicated influenza A or B virus infection if started within 24 hours of symptom onset.5', 170 Given to college students for up to 18 hours the first day and then 12 hours daily over the next 2 to 3 days, aerosolized ribavirin is associated with significant reductions in the height and duration of fever, systemic symptoms, and virus shedding, compared to placebo aerosol (average dose of ribavirin 2.4 gm over 42 hours).58 Studies comparing the therapeutic activities of aerosolized ribavirin and oral amantadine or rimantadine have not been done. The use of aerosol therapy, which requires hospitalization and special equipment, for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza infections appears to be limited. A few patients with influenza pneumonia due to influenza types A and B have been treated with aerosolized ribavirin,log. but controlled trials are needed in highrisk groups.\n\nother Respiratory Viruses. Aerosolized \n\nInterferons are regulatory proteins that can afiect a variety of host cell functions including cell growth, immune response, and inhibition of virus replication. In particular, these proteins are capable of inducing a broad spectrum of antiviral activity, including all of the respiratory viruses. Once named for their principal cellular source, human interferons are currently classified by specific molecular types.'05 Alpha interferons (formerly leukocyte) include over 12 species. Beta interferon (formerly fibroblast) has at least one species, which appears to share the same cellular receptor as alpha interferons. Gamma, or immune, interferon is a lymphokine derived from stimulated lymphocytes. The molecular weights of alpha and beta interferons are approximately 17,000 daltons.\n\nBecause of the unavailability of sufficient quantities of pure interferon, initial research emphasized the use of chemical interferon inducers. These experiments were generally unsuccessful owing to problems of inadequate in vivo induction of interferon and, in some instances, poor tolerance. With advances in genetic engineering techniques during the past decade, however, it has become possible to produce large amounts of purified interferons. Recent studies have shown that intranasal administration of recombinant interferon-alpha 2b is effective in preventing experimental and natural rhinovirus\n\nThe exact mechanisms by which interferons induce an antiviral state in host cells are not fully understood.lo5 Interferons induce the formation of several antiviral proteins in target cells that inhibit the translation of viral messenger RNA. Interferon exposure activates the enzyme 2,soligoadenylate synthetase to produce oligoadenylates, which in turn activate an endonuclease capable of degrading viral mRNA. In addition, interferons activate a protein kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of a subunit of the initiation factor eIF,, thereby inhibiting the initiation of viral protein synthesis. For certain viruses inhibition of maturation and assembly appears to occur. Detailed studies in mice have determined that a particular gene and its product, the Mx protein, confer selective resistance to influenza virus infection after interferon exposure.155A\n\nInterferons have the broadest antiviral spectrum of current agents. At concentrations of 30 to 500 units beta interferon has activity against many adenovirus types.52, 53 Because the antiviral activity of interferons is usually species-specific, human interferons have not been studied extensively in animal models. Using a human interferon hybrid that is active in mouse cells, aerosolized interferon was found to have limited efficacy in experimental murine influenza. 15' Interferon concentrations can be determined biologically by measuring inhibition of viral replication (by plaque or yield reduction techniques), virus specific metabolism (protein production or RNA synthesis), or virusinduced cytopathic effects. Additionally, immunoassays are now available for measuring the concentrations of specific interferons in specimens.83\n\nBecause interferons act principally on host cells, it would be expected that viral resistance would not develop with their use. Resistance has not been recognized in interferon treatment of nonrespiratory v i r~s e s .~\n\nMost studies of interferon for preventing respiratory infections have used intranasal delivery with the hope of achieving local antiviral effects while avoiding systemic toxicity. The initial half-life of intranasal interferon is about 20 minutes,133 but its antiviral effects persist at least 18 hours.59\n\nThe concentration dependency of antiviral effects and rapid nasal clearance may explain the necessity for high dosages to achieve protection in clinical trials. Interventions to maintain higher local concentrations-such as the use of oral antihistamines to decrease clearance, or saturated cotton pledgets-reduce the amount of interferon necessary to achieve an antiviral effect.59 but are ~r o b a b l v of limited clinical value. Furthermore. it has been shown that beta interferon may be directly inactivated by nasal secretion^.^^ Variable concentrations (10 to 10,000 units per ml) are found in nasal washings after intranasal application of alpha interferons, but the relationship between such levels and clinical efficacy has not been established.\n\nIn contrast to the multiple adverse effects of parenteral interferon, the only observed systemic toxicity of intranasal interferon has been transient leukopenia at high doses-that is, 10 million units (MU) per day or greaterand in subiects with mucosal a b n o r m a l i t i e~.~~ 74 Nasal intolerance has been the major limiting factor in the intranasal use of both recombinant and natural alpha interferons. The occurrence of symptoms (nasal dryness, obstruction, discomfort, blood-tinged mucus) and signs (mucosal friability, bleeding sites, erosions, ulcerations on nasal examination) depends on the dose and duration of use. Symptoms of nasal irritation have been reported after both short-term use of high-dose (22.5 MU per day for 4 days)14' and long-term use of low-dose (2 MU per day for 2 to 4 weeks)41 alpha interferons. Histologic studies have documented moderate or severe subepithelial chronic inflamrnati~n.'~, \" These reversible changes occur within 4 days of initiating treatment and appear to be related to the immunologic effects of interferons. Recent long-term studies with recombinant beta interferon indicate that it is better tolerated than alpha interferons at comparable dosages.\"\n\nOne potential problem with the use of intranasal interferons is the development of anti-interferon antibodies. Limited attempts thus far have failed to detect such antibodies in nasal secretion^,'^ but additional studies are needed, because such therapies would be expected to be used repetitively or on a prolonged basis. The development of circulating antiinterferon antibodies after intranasal administration has been observed very infrequently. 155\n\nRhinovirus. Intranasal administration of natural or recombinant alpha interferons is effective in preventing experimentally induced rhinovirus colds. 71 The level of protection is dependent on both the interferon dosage and the duration of administration prior to virus challenge. Short-term administration of high doses (22.5 to 46.0 MU per day) protects against both illness (defined by occurrence of colds and measurement of mucus production) and infection (determined by virus isolation and/or seroconver-~i o n ) .~~, 14' Lower dosages (10 MU per day) allow infection to take place but protect against i 1 l n e~s . l~~ A dosage that permits subclinical infection to occur would be desirable, because this could allow the development of natural immunity to subsequent infection.\n\nThe efficacy of alpha interferons to prevent natural rhinovirus colds has been evaluated in seasonal prophylaxis studies in which interferon has been given over a period of several weeks. Ten MU daily provides high levels of protection against rhinovirus infections but is associated with unacceptable degrees of nasal irritation.l1, 47 Lower daily doses (2 to 3 MU per day)41 cause significant reductions (75 to 88 per cent) in rhinovirus infections compared to placebo but nasal side-effects still occur in 20 to 40 per cent of recipients.\n\nAnother approach is the short-term use of interferon after exposure to a close contact with upper respiratory illness. Recent studies using 5 MU per day for 7 days for postexposure prophylaxis in family members found nearly 40 per cent reduction in total respiratory illness and 90 per cent reduction in rhinovirus-specific illness (Fig. 5 ).72 Another study found a 41 per cent reduction in definite respiratory illnesses overall, and an 86 per cent illness reduction in those exposed to r h i n o v i r~s .~~ However, the beneficial effect of this prophylactic strategy appears to be limited to rhinovirus infections, because influenza and parainfluenza virus infections are not prevented at these dosages (see subsequent discussion). Interferon is generally well-tolerated when used in this manner. Other Respiratory Viruses. Limited evidence suggests that interferons may be effective against infections caused by coronavirus, which is responsible for 10 to 15 per cent of common colds. Alpha interferon 12 M U per day significantly protects against experimental coronavirus infection and illness but has little effect in volunteers lacking antibody to the challenge virus.95 Lower dosages (2 MU per day) protect against illness but allow subclinical infection to occur.lG1 However, no effect on naturally occurring coronavirus illness has been observed at low dosages in seasonal and familybased prophylaxis studies. 41, 42 In experimental influenza virus infections, alpha interferon 10 MU per day reduces the frequency and severity of illness and number of days of viral shedding,37 whereas other studies using lower doses have found less clinical benefit. '35 In seasonal prophylaxis studies, no apparent reduction of infections due to influenza or parainfluenza viruses4'~ 783 have been observed with alpha interferons. Therefore, at the present time, the major utility for interferons in respiratory viral disease appears to be through use of short-term dosing strategies for the prevention of rhinovirus colds. Further studies are needed to determine optimal dosing schedules, methods of administration, and effectiveness in groups at increased risk for the complications of respiratory viral infections.\n\nA need exists for additional antiviral agents with expanded spectrum, diminished toxicity, and increased ease of use. Several new agents, some of which are the result of exciting advances in molecular biology, are at varying stages of investigation and may have clinical usefulness. Other agents are of historic interest.\n\nVirucidal agents are those capable of causing contact inactivation of viral infectivity. An important practical application is their use in interrupting transmission of infection. Under experimental conditions, paper handkerchiefs impregnated with virucidal agents such as citric acid and malic acid are more effective in blocking transmission of rhinovirus than are regular paper handkerchief^.^^' '' The application of virucidal substances, such as iodine, to the fingertips61. 92 or disinfection of contaminated fomites prior to fingertip contact also reduces the risk of rhinovirus transmission under experimental condition^.^^ These approaches are of considerable potential value but have not yet been proven to be effective under natural conditions.\n\nAscorbic Acid Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) has been espoused for the treatment and prevention of the common cold. In vitro data as to its specific antiviral effect are lacking, and data from recent controlled clinical trials indicate negligible 453 138, Some earlier studies were confounded by inadequate blinding and potential bias in reporting of symptoms.23. '06 Zinc Zinc chloride (0.1 mM) has been shown to significantly inhibit rhinovirus plaque formation in HeLa cells for eight of nine serotypes. \"' However, zinc gluconate and other zinc salts at this concentration result in only minimal reductions in virus yield and modest delay in virus cytopathic effect in cell culture, whereas slightly higher concentrations are c y t o t~x i c .~~ One clinical study reported that zinc gluconate lozenges, 23 mg dissolved in the mouth up to eight times daily after the onset of cold symptoms, resulted in a significant reduction in the svmDtoms of natural u , L However, the lozenges were distinguishable from placebo and virologic analysis was not performed. A recent study with zinc gluconate lozenges, 23 mg taken eight times daily, has failed to show clinical or antiviral effects in experimental rhinovirus infe~tion.~' Another placebo-controlled trial using zinc acetate lozenges, 10 mg dissolved in the mouth six to eight times daily, found no beneficial effect on symptoms of natural colds.40\n\nA flavone, isolated from a Chinese medicinal herb, selectively inhibits rhinovirus and coxsackievirus replication but is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.lo4 RO 09-0410, a chalcone derivative of this compound, specifically inhibits 50 per cent of rhinovirus types tested at a concentration of 0.03 pg per m1.1\u00b02 Inhibition appears to be mediated through binding to the virus capsid.lZ7 A phosphate ester, Ro 09-0415, is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and converted to the active chalcone, which achieves sufficient levels of the chalcone in the res~iratorv tract of rodents.lo3 but clinical trials have not shown prophylactic activity in man. 134 Despite demonstrable blood levels, the parent and active compounds were undetectable in nasal wash specimens. These results illustrate the importance of achieving adequate antiviral concentrations at the site of infection in the respiratory tract.\n\nIn cell and organ culture, enviroxime, 2-amino-1-(isopropyl sulfony1)-6-benzimidazole phenyl ketone oxime, is a potent inhibitor of rhinovirus r e p l i~a t i o n .~~ It appears to inhibit translation of viral mRNA. When given by intranasal spray at concentrations many times higher than those inhibitory for rhinovirus in vitro, enviroxime provides inconsistent protection against experimentally induced rhinovirus infection33 and is associated with nasal irritatiom7= Combined oral and intranasal administration leads to decreased cold symptoms and virus titers but is associated with gastrointestinal side-effects.13' Intranasal enviroxime has modest therapeutic activity in experimental rhinovirus colds13' and is ineffective in the treatment of natural c01ds.l~~ A modified derivative, enviradene, is undergoing further investigation. 157\n\nA new cyclo-nonane hydrochloride, ICI 130,685, structurally similar to amantadine, has better prophylactic activity against influenza than amantadine in animal studies. Dosages of 100 and 200 mg per day are 72 and 91 per cent effective, respectively, in preventing illness following experimental influenza virus challenge in man.4 Treatment of experimental infection with 200 mg per day results in significant decreases in virus shedding and clinical symptoms on certain postchallenge days. Drug concentrations in nasal secretions appear to be several times higher than those present in the blood. Neurologic and gastrointestinal side-effects are observed at the higher dosage, but no direct comparisons have been made with other adamantanes. Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in natural influenza infections has not yet been evaluated.\n\nA potent new antipicornaviral agent 5-(7-[4-(4,5, dihydro-2-oxaz-do1)phenoxylheptyl) 3-methyl-isoxazole, WIN 51711, inhibits the majority of rhinovirus serotypes tested at concentrations of less than 1 pg per ml. This drug is not directly virucidal but binds to the virus capsid and appears to have its major effects on the uncoating step of viral r e p l i c a t i~n .~~, lS4 This antiviral agent is effective orally and parenterally for treatment of enteroviral infection in rodents.lZ0 Studies in experimentally induced enterovirus infection of man are in progress.\n\nNearly 90 per cent of human rhinovirus serotypes share a single type of cellular receptor,' and recent efforts have been directed at the development of agents to block the attachment of virus to the host cell receptor. Murine monoclonal antibodies directed against the cellular receptor site are potent in vitro inhibitors of rhinovirus repli~ation.'~ Intranasal administration of this murine monoclonal antibody provides partial protection against experimental rhinovirus infections in man. 77 The use of agents capable of blocking attachment of virus to the host cell could prove effective in the prophylaxis and possible treatment of rhinovirus and other viral infections.\n\nThe use of combinations of antivirals with different modes of action might allow for broader spectrum of activity, synergistic or enhanced antiviral effects, prevention of drug resistance, andlor diminished toxicity. For rhinoviruses, synergistic antiviral activity has been demonstrated in vitro when various types of interferons are combined with each other or with chemical antirhinoviral agentsS3 Additive or synergistic effects have been shown with ribavirin and amantadine or rimantadine against influenza A in vitroS1, 87 and in mice,51, 693 171 interferon alpha-2 and rimantadine against influenza A in ~i t r o ,~~ and interferon alpha-2 and ribavirin against influenza A and B in ~i t r o .~~ combination chemotherapy warrants further evaluation in man.\n\nRespiratory viruses continue to be major causes of morbidity and mortality. Currently available chemotherapy is limited to oral amantadine for uncomplicated influenza A and aerosolized ribavirin for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. Amantadine is also efficacious for chemoprophylaxis of influenza A virus infections. Rimantadine has similar clinical efficacy and is better tolerated than amantadine. Aerosolized ribavirin may be useful in the treatment of serious respiratory illness caused by viruses other than RSV. Intranasal application of interferon is effective in inter-rupting the spread of rhinovirus colds in families, but chronic use is limited by nasal toxicity. Several newer agents and approaches for chemoprophylaxis and therapy are at different stages of clinical investigation. Combinations of antiviral agents may offer the best therapeutic advantage but have not been adequately tested in man. As additional drugs become available and uses expand for the currently available agents, rapid viral diagnosis will assume an increasingly important role in their optimal use."}
