These exacerbations are associated with substantial morbidity, lead to approximately 2 million hospital admissions annually, cause respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in some patients, and are an important cause of death in COPD [1] . Exacerbations are caused by a wide range of factors, including viral infection, bacterial infection, allergy, \u00a3uid overload, environmental factors and others [1, 2] . In order to develop successful strategies to better treat and prevent exacerbations, it will be important to elucidate more precisely the etiology of exacerbations. Unfortunately, the etiology of exacerbations is di\u2044cult to determine with certainty in individual patients.\n\nDetermining the infectious etiology of exacerbations is particularly challenging in view of the limitations of routine laboratory tests. Viral pathogens have been identi\u00a2ed by viral cultures, analysis of clinical samples by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and by serological tests. Since these assays are not routinely performed, the diagnosis of a viral infection is generally a presumptive, clinical diagnosis by the practicing physician. Several studies which utilized assays to identify viral pathogens have established that viral infection is associated with a signi\u00a2cant proportion of exacerbations of COPD [3^7] . One study demonstrated that respiratory tract viral infections were present in 23% of hospitalizations in adults with COPD and in 45% of those admitted during winter months [3] .\n\nNon-typeable Haemophilus in\u00a3uenzae is the most common bacterium implicated as a cause of exacerbations of COPD [1] . A goal of the present study is to assess the immune response to non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae isolated from the sputum of patients experiencing exacerbations. Several studies have used this approach [8] . However, one must be cautious in interpreting these studies because recent work has established that the immune response to non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae in COPD is directed at strain-speci\u00a2c antigens [9^14] . Therefore, in order to detect a human immune response to non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae, it is critical that the homologous infecting strain be used as the source of antigen in the immunoassays.\n\nWhile several studies have assayed for the presence of viral infection in exacerbations and several studies have looked carefully for evidence of infection caused by nontypeable H. in\u00a3uenzae, no studies have used rigorous methods to look for both in the same set of patients. In the present study, 35 exacerbations during which nontypeable H. in\u00a3uenzae was isolated from the sputum, were identi\u00a2ed in a cohort of adults with COPD followed prospectively at Baylor College of Medicine. The goal of the present study was to rigorously assess these 35 exacerbations for the presence of viral infection and for infection by non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae as evidenced by the presence of the organism in sputum and a new immune response to the homologous isolate.\n\nSamples were collected from subjects receiving care at Ben Taub General Hospital of the Harris County Hospital District and enrolled in a longitudinal study of chronic bronchitis. To be eligible for the longitudinal study, a subject had to have chronic bronchitis as de\u00a2ned by the American Thoracic Society [15] . Subjects with known asthma, bronchiectasis, malignancy or immunocompromising conditions were excluded. Subjects also had to agree to be followed monthly for evaluation and to be seen when signs or symptoms of a respiratory illness developed.\n\nStudy samples were selected from subjects who had an exacerbation, had non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae isolated from a sputum sample collected during the illness, had pre-and post-exacerbation sera available for analysis, and had no other illness in the interval covered by the paired sera. An exacerbation was de\u00a2ned as upper and/or lower respiratory symptoms, and one of the following symptoms: increased sputum production, cough or dyspnea.\n\nSputum specimens were collected and transported on ice to the laboratory within 4 h of collection for bacteriologic studies as previously described [16] . Nasal washes and throat swab specimens were collected for virologic studies, placed in veal infusion broth, and transported on ice to the laboratory within 4 h of collection. Serum for antibody studies was collected at each visit, at the time of an exacerbation, and 2^4 weeks later, and it was stored at 320 \u2021C until used in serologic assays.\n\nViral cultures and virus identi\u00a2cation were performed as described previously [3, 17, 18] with the following modi\u00a2cations. Primary rhesus monkey kidney cells (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD, USA) were used in place of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells for some samples, and two human lung embryonic lung \u00a2broblast lines (WI-38, MRC-5) were used for some samples. All samples were inoculated onto human epidermoid cells (Hep-2) and monkey kidney (LLC-MK2) cells.\n\nSerologic studies for antibody levels to respiratory viruses were performed as described previously [3] . These included microneutralization tests for in\u00a3uenza A and B viruses, parain\u00a3uenza viruses types 1^3, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronavirus type 229E [3, 19] , hemagglutination inhibition assays for in\u00a3uenza A and B viruses, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for coronavirus type OC43 [20] .\n\nReverse transcription PCR assays were performed using virus-speci\u00a2c primers and probes for in\u00a3uenza A and B viruses, picornaviruses, coronavirus type OC43, parain-\u00a3uenza virus types 1 and 3, and respiratory syncytial virus as previously described [21^25] . For parain\u00a3uenza virus type 2, a region of the F gene [26] was ampli\u00a2ed using the following virus-speci\u00a2c primers : upstream primer, 5P-CATGTACTATACTGATGGTGG-3P; downstream primer, 5P-GTTAGTAACTTAAATAGGGTAAC-3P. Para-in\u00a3uenza virus type 2-speci\u00a2c amplimers were identi\u00a2ed using a digoxigenin-labeled oligoprobe: 5P-AATGGAACAT-GCAACATCACC-3P.\n\nIsolates of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae were grown on chocolate agar overnight at 37 \u2021C under 5% CO 2 . For ELISA, strains were grown in a shaking incubator to mid-exponential phase (optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) V0.2) in brain heart infusion broth containing hemin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) both at 10 Wg ml 31 . Bacteria that did not reliably grow to mid-exponential phase by this method (total of 10) were grown in chocolate broth (15 g proteose peptone No. 3, 1 g corn starch, 4 g potassium phosphate dibasic, 1 g potassium phosphate monobasic, 5 g sodium chloride, 10 mg hemin and with 10 Wg ml 31 NAD in 800 ml distilled water).\n\nIsolates of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae were subjected to typing by sodium dodecyl sulfate^polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS^PAGE) of whole bacterial cell lysates, as previously described [27, 28] . This method is based largely on the mobility of outer membrane proteins in SDSP AGE [29] . Isolates were grown on chocolate agar overnight. A loopful of bacteria was suspended in 0.1 ml of phosphate-bu\u00a1ered saline (PBS). An equal volume of 2U sample bu\u00a1er (0.1 M Tris, 2% SDS, 10% L-mercaptoethanol, 40% glycerol and 0.05% bromophenol blue) was added, and the mixture was heated in a boiling water bath for 15 min. A 20-Wl aliquot was subjected to SDSP AGE on 11% gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie blue.\n\nThe level of IgG in human serum to whole cell preparations of homologous isolates of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae was determined by ELISA. Wells of a 96-well microtiter plates (Immulon 4; Dynatech) were coated overnight at 4 \u2021C with 0.1 ml of mid-exponential phase bacteria suspended in PBS to an OD 600 of V0.20. Wells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-Tween). Unbound sites on plastic were blocked with 3% non-fat dry milk in PBS-Tween for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were washed three times with PBS-Tween. Serum was diluted in 1% non-fat dry milk in PBS-Tween, 100 Wl was added to wells in multiple dilutions (ranging from 1:500 to 1:64 000), and incubated at 37 \u2021C for 2 h. After the wells were washed three times with PBS-Tween, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-human F(abP) 2 IgG (DAKO, Carpenteria, CA, USA), diluted 1:3000 in 3% goat serum, was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing wells, substrate and color developer (0.1 mg 3,3P,5,5P-tetramethyl-benzidine-dimethyl sulfoxide^0.2% hydrogen peroxide per ml in 0.1 M sodium acetate adjusted to a pH 4.5 with citric acid) were added to the wells and incubated for 15 min at room temperature before the reactions were stopped by addition of 4 N H 2 SO 4 . The OD 450 was read.\n\nPaired samples of pre-and post-exacerbation sera were always run together. The percentage change in OD between the pre-exacerbation serum and the post-exacerbation serum for each dilution was calculated using the following formula: (OD post-exacerbation serum3OD preexacerbation serum)U100/OD pre-exacerbation serum. To determine the percentage change which represents a sig-ni\u00a2cant increase in the antibody response from a pre-exacerbation to a post-exacerbation sample, ELISA was performed on 15 paired serum samples, collected 2 months apart from adults with COPD followed with monthly sputum cultures and who did not grow non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae in the sputum. These paired sera were tested against isolates of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae. The percentage change in OD was calculated as described above.\n\nThirty-\u00a2ve of 152 exacerbations were studied. Reasons for exclusion from study included the failure to obtain a sputum sample during the illness (n = 13), failure to isolate non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae from sputum samples collected (n = 75), lack of availability of either a pre-exacerbation or a convalescent serum for the illness (n = 14), lack of availability of at least one strain of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae from the illness sample (n = 8), and illness not selected for study (n = 7). The 35 exacerbations occurred in 24 subjects during which non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae was isolated from sputum. Table 1 shows the baseline clinical characteristics of the patients. Pre-exacerbation sera were collected a median of 24 days (range 5^104 days) before the onset of the illness, and post-exacerbation sera were collected a median of 39 days (range 24^83 days) after illness onset. The median time from illness onset to clinic visit was 2 days (range 0^15 days).\n\nMultiple colonies of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae were picked from original culture plates and grown individually when possible. Of 35 exacerbations, two or more colonies (range 2^19 colonies) were recovered from the original culture plate in 28. An average of 4.3 colonies per sample was recovered with 134 isolates in total. In seven exacerbations, a single colony was recovered. Molecular typing by SDS^PAGE was performed to determine the frequency with which single or multiple isolates were present in the sputum simultaneously. Of the 28 samples with multiple colonies, 25 had a single strain of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae. Three sputum samples contained isolates with two banding patterns in SDS^PAGE that di\u00a1ered in multiple bands from one another, indicating that these two sputum samples had two genetically di\u00a1erent strains of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae simultaneously.\n\nH. in\u00a3uenzae\n\nELISAs were performed to measure serum IgG to the homologous isolate in pre-exacerbation and post-exacerbation sera of 35 exacerbations during which non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae was isolated from sputum. Paired pre-and post-exacerbation sera were always tested in the same as-say. Varying dilutions of each set of paired samples were tested and the OD was plotted against dilution. The percentage change between paired pre-and post-exacerbation sera was measured at a dilution of serum which demonstrated a linear relationship between OD and dilution (1:500 to 1:16 000).\n\nTo determine the percentage change which represents a signi\u00a2cant increase in the antibody response from a preexacerbation to a post-exacerbation sample, ELISA was performed on 15 paired serum samples, collected 2 months apart from adults with COPD who did not grow non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae from monthly sputum samples. These paired control sera demonstrated a 0.43 \u00fe 8.58% (mean \u00fe S.D.) change when tested with heterologous isolates of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae. A change in OD of 22.1% represented the upper limit of the 99% con\u00a2dence interval for the controls. Therefore, any change in OD from pre-to post-exacerbation serum samples of 22.1% or more was regarded as a signi\u00a2cant change. Three sputum samples contained two di\u00a1erent isolates of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae simultaneously during exacerbations. Each isolate was tested individually in ELISA with homologous pre-and post-exacerbation sera. None of these three patients had a statistically signi\u00a2cant IgG response to either of the homologous sputum isolates.\n\nEighteen respiratory viral infections were identi\u00a2ed in 16 of the 35 (46.7%) exacerbations (Table 2) . Rhinovirus was cultured from four subjects, parain\u00a3uenza type 3 from three subjects, and in\u00a3uenza A/H3N2 from one subject. Serologic evidence of infection with in\u00a3uenza A virus was seen in four subjects and parain\u00a3uenza type 3 virus in two subjects and coronavirus OC43 in one subject. RT-PCR assays identi\u00a2ed three additional infections (two picornavirus and one parain\u00a3uenza type 3 virus). Dual infections were identi\u00a2ed in two subjects (one rhinovirus Table 3 shows a summary of the results of virological studies and ELISAs to non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae in the 35 exacerbations. All possible combinations were observed, including evidence of simultaneous viral and bacterial infection, absence of both viral and bacterial infection and evidence of each individually. Three exacerbations (8.6%) showed evidence of both viral infection and also a new serum IgG response to non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae, suggesting co-infection. Overall, evidence of infection with a respiratory virus or non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae was seen in 24 of 35 exacerbations (68.6%). The data were analyzed to test the hypothesis that when evidence of viral infection was absent, an immune response to non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae was more likely. An immune response to non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae occurred more frequently in the absence of viral infection but did not reach statistical signi\u00a2cance (P = 0.167).\n\nAn important limitation in developing strategies to prevent exacerbations of COPD is the relative lack of accurate information regarding the etiology of exacerbations in individual patients. Because specialized techniques are required to establish a diagnosis of viral infection, the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infection by clinicians is generally made on clinical grounds. To complicate matters further, the isolation of a bacterial pathogen from the sputum of an adult with COPD during an exacerbation does not prove etiology because colonization by bacteria occurs in the absence of an exacerbation. Therefore, assays beyond sputum cultures are necessary to more accurately predict bacterial etiology.\n\nIn the present study, 35 exacerbations associated with the isolation from sputum of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae were identi\u00a2ed as part of a prospective study. These patients were studied carefully for evidence of viral infection using viral culture, serology and PCR-based assays. In addition, samples from these patients were subjected to immunoassays to identify a new immune response to the homologous isolate of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae to more accurately assess a bacterial etiology. This careful evaluation allows a far more accurate assessment of the etiology of exacerbations. Previous studies have used similar methods, but no studies thus far have evaluated the same set of patients with exacerbations of COPD for both viral and bacterial infection in this way [3, 6, 7, 30] .\n\nSixteen of the 35 exacerbations (45.7%) were associated with evidence of acute viral infection. This number is similar to that observed in previous studies of COPD patients with exacerbations, including those whose sputum cultures were negative for non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae [3, 5, 31] . The most frequent viruses were parain\u00a3uenza type 3 and picornaviruses. This pattern is similar to that observed in previous studies [3, 31] .\n\nThe demonstration of a new immune response to nontypeable H. in\u00a3uenzae isolated from the sputum at the time of the exacerbation provides evidence that the organism caused the exacerbation. Eleven of the 35 exacerbations (31.4%) were associated with the development of new serum IgG to the homologous isolate detected in whole cell ELISA. Although the demonstration of new serum IgG to non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae provides supportive evidence that the organism in the sputum was etiologic, no gold standard exists for unequivocally identifying the organism as the cause of an individual exacerbation. Some patients who experience exacerbations due to bacteria may develop an immune response which is not detected by using whole cell ELISA with serum. For example, a mucosal immune response can occur independent of a systemic immune response [32, 33] . Indeed, in a recent study, analysis of systemic and mucosal antibody responses to Moraxella catarrhalis isolated during exacerbations of COPD revealed instances of the development of mucosal IgA responses in the absence of serum IgG responses to the homologous isolate [34] . Similarly, cell-mediated immune responses to antigens of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae may occur in adults with COPD independent of antibody responses [35] . Therefore, the absence of a new serum IgG response does not exclude the possibility that the exacerbation was caused by non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae. Further- more, it is possible that colonization with an isolate of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae may induce an immune response, even in the absence of a clinical exacerbation. In spite of these limitations of measuring new serum IgG to non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae, several elements of the design of the present study should be emphasized. First, the homologous isolate was used as the antigen in ELISA for all assays. A serious limitation of a large number of published studies on the immune response to nontypeable H. in\u00a3uenzae is the use of laboratory strains or heterologous isolates to detect immune responses [8] . The antibody response following infection with non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae is predominantly directed at strain-speci\u00a2c epitopes [9^14]. Therefore it is important to use homologous isolates to measure immune responses to non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae as was done in this study. Second, adult human serum contains 'background' antibodies to many antigens of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae. These antibodies are cross reactive with antigens on other bacteria and do not bind to the surface of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae; thus, the antibodies are unlikely to mediate protective immune responses. The present study utilized whole bacterial cells in ELISA to increase the likelihood that antibodies which bind to the intact bacterial cell were detected.\n\nA third important element of the present study is the availability of samples as a result of the prospective study design. Serum from prior to the onset of symptoms was used as the pre-exacerbation serum. Such samples are preferable to 'acute' serum collected at the time of the exacerbation since partial antibody responses may already be developing by the time the patient is evaluated. Furthermore, assays of pre-and post-exacerbation serum allowed us to detect exclusively new antibody responses in spite of the presence of varying titers of background antibodies.\n\nFinally, multiple strains of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae can colonize the human respiratory tract simultaneously [28, 36] . In the present study, multiple colonies from the original sputum culture plates were subcultured separately and subjected to molecular typing to assess the possibility that multiple strains were present. In three of the 35 exacerbations, multiple strains were present. Whole cell ELI-SAs were performed with both of the isolates individually in these cases.\n\nWe hypothesized that patients who showed evidence of viral infection would be less likely to develop an immune response to non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae than those patients who lacked evidence of viral infection. While a trend in this direction was observed, the data did not support this hypothesis. This study showed that exacerbations may be caused by virus alone, non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae alone, or virus and non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae simultaneously. In the case of evidence of simultaneous infection by virus and non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae, several interpretations are possible. First, the exacerbation may be caused by virus and H. in\u00a3uenzae is a colonizer that induces an immune response. Second, a viral infection may be the initial inciting event in the exacerbation and secondary infection with non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae occurs. This scenario has been proposed in several respiratory tract infections including otitis media, sinusitis and exacerbations of COPD. Third, a virus may be causing upper respiratory tract infection while the lower respiratory tract symptoms characteristic of an exacerbation are caused by non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae. It is not possible to draw a conclusion regarding these possibilities based on the data in the present study.\n\nIn summary, rigorous methods to identify evidence of viral infection were applied to samples from patients experiencing exacerbations of COPD from whom non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae was isolated from sputum. A total of 45.7% of these exacerbations were associated with evidence of viral infection and approximately one third were associated with the development of serum IgG responses to the homologous isolate of non-typeable H. in-\u00a3uenzae; overall, two thirds of exacerbations were associated with a viral infection or a rise in serum IgG to the homologous isolate of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae. The data indicate that exacerbations may be caused by virus alone, non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae alone, or virus and nontypeable H. in\u00a3uenzae simultaneously. These results highlight the challenge facing practicing physicians who treat patients with exacerbations of COPD and emphasize the need for better methods to accurately identify the etiology of exacerbations of COPD."}
