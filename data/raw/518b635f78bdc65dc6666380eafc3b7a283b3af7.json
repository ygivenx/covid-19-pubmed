Averaging across other predictors, presented the lowest risk. An increased probability of severe virulence was also observed for 1 4 5 viruses transmitted by direct contact or respiratory routes, and those with known but limited 1 4 6 human-to-human transmissibility. Although the single classification tree model predicted the training set well, it did not appear 1 5 0 generalisable to novel data within the test set. The single tree correctly predicted virulence gave better predictive accuracy, correctly predicting virulence ratings for 28 of 31 test set accuracy (exact binomial one-tailed test, p = 0.025). The random forest also achieved 1 5 7 superior performance when considering sensitivity, specificity, True Skill Statistic, and the 'severe'-rated viruses ( Table 1 ). The random forest also outperformed the classification tree in All misclassifications from the random forest occurred within the genus Flavivirus (S2 Table) . Within the test set, there were two flaviruses rated as severe from literature protocols that The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

The observed predictor importances and risk factor directions were robust to constructing 1 6 7 random forest models for subsets of viruses, removing those with low-certainty data or data 1 6 8 from serological evidence only (S1 Fig, S2 Fig) , and similar performance diagnostics were obtained (S5 Table) . Redefining our virulence measure to integrate information on known 1 7 0 fatalities and differences with subspecies or strains in an ordinal ranking system (S5 Table) 1 7 1 did not improve predictive performance (S6 Table) . Using alternative virulence 1 7 2 measurements, the most informative variables and virus traits predicting severity showed 'severe' virulence were widened, hepatic tropism became an informative predictor towards 1 7 5 disease severity. We present the first comparative analysis of virulence across all known human RNA virus 1 7 8 species to our knowledge. We find that disease severity is non-randomly distributed across virus families and that beyond taxonomy, severe disease is predicted by risk factors of tissue Primary tissue tropism was the most informative non-taxonomic risk factor (Fig 4) and the first 1 8 9 split criteria in the classification tree (Fig 2) , with specific neural tropism and generalised predicted how tissue tropism should influence virulence. The identified risk factor tropisms 1 9 2 could be explainable as a simple function of pathology occurring in multiple or sensitive 1 9 3 tissues respectively, increasing intensity of clinical disease. However, it has been suggested 1 9 4 that an excessive, non-adapted virulence may result if infections occur within non-target tissues that do not contribute to transmission [28] . Furthermore, the evolutionary determinants of tissue tropism themselves are not well understood [29] . Tissue tropism should be a key 1 9 7 consideration for future comparative and evolutionary modelling efforts.

The relationship between virulence and transmissibility appears more complex. Firstly, the human-to-human transmissibility (level 4) (Fig 5) . This would lend support towards disease for a specific subset of four viruses in the single classification tree (Fig 2) , all 'dead-end' infections) have been predicted to result in higher virulence as without any 2 2 5 evolutionary selection, viral phenotypes within that host will be non-adapted, i.e. a 2 2 6 'coincidental' by-product [24, 25] . However, we did not observe viruses incapable of human-to-2 2 7 human transmissibility to be more virulent, the highest risk instead being observed for viruses dead-end infections, ultimate levels of virulence could also feasibly turn out to be 2 3 0 'coincidentally' low. Taxonomic family being a highly informative predictor in the random forest implies that there 2 3 3 is a broad phylogenetic signal to virulence, but it is also highly likely that the explanatory 2 3 4 power represents a proxy for many other phylogenetically-conserved viral traits that are 2 3 5 challenging to implement in comparative analyses of this scale, such as variation at the 2 3 6 proteomic, transcriptomic or genomic level; or further data beyond simple categorisations, e.g. specific arthropod vector species. Untangling these sources of variation from different scales 2 3 8 of traits will be a critical next step in predictive modelling of viral virulence.

However, our models have restricted function in predicting the virulence of a newly identified 2 6 8 virus. Although taxonomy is easily accessible and applicable to give simple virulence 2 6 9 estimates, the most informative non-taxonomic predictor, tissue tropism, is not likely to be More widely, our analysis brings a novel focus that complements comparative models 2 8 2 predicting other aspects of the emergence process, such as zoonotic transmission certain virus families (e.g. Hantaviridae) or tissues (e.g. neural tissue) could contribute to a 2 9 0 viable strategy to detect future virulent zoonoses. This work adds to the comparative and predictive modelling efforts surrounding emerging 2 9 4 infectious diseases. Here, we contribute a novel focus in ecological predictors of virulence of 2 9 5 human RNA viruses, which can be combined in holistic frameworks with other models such 2 9 6 as those predicting emergence dynamics. As a predictive model, the featured random forest infections. We propose that future predictive studies and preparedness initiatives with respect to emerging diseases should carefully consider potential for human virulence. and 4 were carried out only when fatality or tropism data respectively were not already found virus species. Therefore, virulence was rated using a simple two-category measure of severity viruses as 'severe' if they had frequent reports of hospitalisation, were associated with 3 2 0 significant morbidity from certain conditions (haemorrhagic fever, seizures/coma, cirrhosis, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/581512 doi: bioRxiv preprint described as \"severe\" or \"causing severe disease\" (S1 Table, S2 Table) . We rated viruses as 3 2 3 'nonsevere' if none of these conditions were met. Note that this led to 'nonsevere' ratings for 3 2 4 some viruses with clinically severe, but rare syndromes, e.g. Dengue virus can cause 3 2 5 haemorrhagic dengue fever, though this is much rarer than typical acute dengue fever vulnerable individuals (defined as age 16 and below or 60 and above, immunosuppressed, 3 2 8 having co-morbidities, or otherwise cited as being 'at-risk' by sources for specific viruses) and in healthy adults, and whether any 'nonsevere' virus has atypically severe strains (for disease; however, poliovirus, which causes severe paralytic disease, is also classified under 3 3 2 this species). These were examined both individually and within a composite six-rank system 3 3 3 (S5 Table) . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We accepted isolation accept generalised symptoms such as inflammation. However, many human viruses were 3 4 8 isolated from blood with no further evidence of any specific tissue tropisms (n = 69).\n\nTherefore, we also included an additional 'viraemia' category in this variable to indicate only 3 5 0 blood presence was known. Binary variables were also constructed denoting whether viruses were ever known to utilise a) more than one transmission route/tissue tropism, and b) each reproductive, sensory, skin, muscular and endocrine tropism).

To validate the predictive power of the 3 9 0 classification tree, predictions of virulence rating were generated when applied to the test set. Tree accuracy was then calculated comparing the proportion of correct predictions compared 3 9 2 to literature-assigned ratings (assuming these to be 100% accurate as the 'gold standard' or 3 9 3 'ground truth'). As virulence ratings were imbalanced (i.e. only a minority of viruses cause 3 9 4 severe disease, so correct nonsevere classifications are likely to be achieved by chance), predicted 'nonsevere' for all viruses. Additional diagnostics of interest (sensitivity, specificity, 3 9 7 negative predictive value, and True Skill Statistic [60]) were also obtained. Due to their high structuring, random forest models cannot give a simple parametric predictor 4 1 6 effect size and direction (e.g., an odds ratio). Instead, potential virulence risk factors were 4 1 7 evaluated using two metrics: variable importance and partial dependence. Variable importance is calculated as the mean decrease in Gini impurity following tree splits on the predictor and can be considered as how informative the risk factor was towards correctly 4 2 0 predicting virulence. Partial dependence is calculated as the mean relative change in log- reflect any complex risk factor interactions. Therefore, to test hypotheses regarding virulence 4 2 5 risk factors, we present both random forest partial dependences and the less robust but more and Feifei Zhang for assistance in data collection.
