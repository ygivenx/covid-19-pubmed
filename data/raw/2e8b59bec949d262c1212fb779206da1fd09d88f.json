{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Antimicrobial resistance in southern China: results of prospective surveillance in Dongguan city, 2017 Antimicrobial resistance in Southern China -Results of prospective surveillance in Dongguan City, 2017", "body": "Few studies have estimated the burden of infections due to antimicrobial resistant (AMR) pathogens in China.\n\nWe aimed at summarising AMR and assessing the frequency of community-associated infections (CAIs) and healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) due to AMR pathogens in Dongguan city, China.\n\nSeven acute care hospitals provided antimicrobial susceptibility data for 2017 of which \"bugdrug\" combinations were analysed. To calculate incidence proportions of CAI and incidence densities of HAI, data from three tertiary-care hospitals were merged with patient data, obtained from the Dongguan Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System.\n\nA total of 16,548 pathogens were analysed. Non-susceptibility to 3 rd generation cephalosporins (3GC) in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 43.9% and 30.2%, respectively. Nonsusceptibility to carbapenems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were 29 .5% and 50.9%, respectively. A quarter of Staphylococcus aureus (26.3%) were nonsusceptible to oxacillin. The incidence density of HAI due to E. coli non-susceptible to 3GC and fluoroquinolones combined was 0.09 (95% CI: 0.07-0.11) per 1,000 patient-days. Both E. coli and K. pneumoniae were the predominant pathogens isolated from blood. Compared with the 2017 European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network report, the incidence proportion of bloodstream infections due to multidrug-resistant E. coli was significantly higher (14.9% and 4.6%, respectively).\n\nThe incidence of non-susceptible bug-drug combinations in Dongguan city was lower compared with China as a whole. Non-susceptible bug-drug combinations were significantly more frequent in HAI compared with CAI. The incidence proportion of bloodstream infections due to multidrugresistant pathogens in Dongguan city was higher compared with Europe.\n\nSurveillance; incidence proportion; incidence density; antimicrobial resistance; multidrug resistant pathogens; China; Dongguan\n\nHealthcare-associated infections (HAIs) due to antimicrobial resistant pathogens have been recognized as a challenge in modern healthcare [1] [2] [3] . The global action plan of the World Health Organization (WHO) on antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the World Antibiotic Awareness\n\nWeek and WHO's global infection prevention and control (IPC) priorities 2018 -2022, focus on the burden of AMR, in particular in Asia [4, 5] . Surveillance, and in particular prospective incidence surveillance, is the cornerstone in understanding and controlling AMR [1, 2] . Global AMR surveillance networks such as the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) [6] or the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) [7] , report on current status and trends of AMR on a yearly basis.\n\nA major driver to step up surveillance on infectious diseases in Mainland China was the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003 [8, 9] . Two national AMR surveillance Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy [11] . From an IPC perspective, there are gaps in reports on infections due to AMR pathogens in Mainland China: 1) most publications in China focus on molecular characteristics rather than epidemiology [12] ; 2) pooled data on AMR are not deduplicated [13] ; 3) data on infections due to AMR pathogens are not stratified into HAI and community-associated infection (CAI) [14] ; and 4) data analysis does not address AMR combinations [7, 11, 12] .\n\nThe aims of this study were: 1) to summarise incidence proportions of pooled AMR data in Dongguan city of Guangdong province in 2017 and to compare the results with the 2017 CHINET report [11] ; 2) to calculate incidence proportions of CAIs and incidence densities of HAIs due to AMR pathogens and to compare the results for HAI with data from Germany [14] ; and 3) to calculate incidence proportions of bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to AMR pathogens in tertiary-care hospitals and to compare the results with the 2017 EARS-Net report [7] .\n\nDongguan city is located in the Guangdong province in Southern China and has a population of about 8 million [15, 16] . In 2014, the city established the Dongguan city Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System (DNISS) to organise yearly point prevalence surveys, prospective surgical site infection surveillance, and prospective AMR surveillance [15] . Data on AMR incidence of 2017 was provided by seven public/not-for-profit hospitals, two secondary-and five tertiary-care hospitals of the city. All institutions are general hospitals with a mixed patient population. Data collection on AMR follows the national surveillance protocol [11, 12] .\n\nAntimicrobial susceptibility data were obtained from the microbiology laboratories of the seven hospitals. Clinical data were obtained from DNISS [17] : 1) anonymous patient identifier, age, gender, date of hospital admission, department of admission, date of hospital discharge, length of stay, and in-hospital mortality; 2) presence of healthcare/community-associated infection or colonisation, infection type, date of infection/colonisation; 3) type and date of microbiological sampling (i.e. sputum, urine, blood, pus, and other clinical specimens), pathogen, date of microbiological reporting, and microbiological identifier. The definitions of HAI included temporal (>48 hours after admission), clinical and microbiological criteria [15, 18] ; otherwise, infections diagnosed within 48 hours of admission without any previous encounter with healthcare were defined as CAI. Healthcare-associated infections and CAIs due to AMR pathogens were obtained by merging the microbiology databases with the DNISS database, using the anonymous patient identifier (the same for both databases), date of microbiological sampling, date of microbiological reporting, pathogen, and microbiological identifier. Figure 1 summarizes the data extraction flow for the analysis of AMR and HAI/CAI due to AMR pathogens.\n\nThe following HAI-relevant indicator pathogens were addressed: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium [7, 11, 13, 19] . Identification and susceptibility testing was performed using VITEK \u00ae 2 (BioM\u00e9rieux, France) in all hospitals. Breakpoints for minimal inhibitory concentrations were based on the US National Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (NCLSI) guidelines (modified version based on M100 -28 th editions in 2017) (Supplementary table 1) [20]. Primary outcome was non-susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of epidemiologically significant antimicrobial categories, termed AMR markers [7, 13] . Multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens were defined as pathogens with non-susceptibility to at least one agent of three or more relevant antimicrobial categories [21] .\n\nIncidence proportions of pooled bacterium-antimicrobial (\"bug-drug\") combinations as used by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) were calculated [7, 13] , with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results were compared with the 2017 national CHINET report [11] . Data were de-duplicated using the criteria of the EARS-Net surveillance protocol and taking into account all pathogens in context with the first infection during hospitalisation. Incidence proportions of CAI (N/100 admissions) as well as incidence densities of HAI (N/1000 patient-days) due to AMR pathogens were calculated [13] . Healthcare-associated infections due to E. coli and K. pneumoniae non-susceptible to 3 rd -generation cephalosporins (3GC), fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, or any combination of these agents, were compared with a multi-centre surveillance report, performed in Germany in 2014/2015 [14] .\n\nBloodstream infections due to AMR pathogens were calculated following the EARS-Net protocol for pathogen-resistance combinations [13] . Incidence proportions of BSI due to MDR pathogens were compared with the 2017 EARS-Net report [7] .\n\nHealthcare-associated infections due to AMR E. coli and AMR K. pneumoniae were compared with German surveillance data using the Pearson's Chi-Square test [14] . Bloodstream infections due to MDR pathogens were compared with the EARS-Net data using the Fisher's exact test [7] .\n\nTwo-sided P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses and graphs were performed using STATA 15.1 version (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA).\n\nThe Chinese Ethics Committee of Registering Clinical Trials waived patient informed consent and approved data analysis for this study (ChiECRCT20190134). A total of 1,508 and 4,090 pathogens were allocated to HAI and CAI, respectively ( Figure 1 ). Non-susceptibility was consistently higher in HAI compared with CAI. However, statistically significant differences were identified only for P. aeruginosa to all antimicrobials, and for E. coli and K. pneumoniae to both ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin ( Figure 3 ). Table 1 summarises \"bug-drug\" combinations by HAI-types and clinical departments. Supplementary tables 4 and 5 summarise distributions and incidence densities of HAI and CAI due to indicator pathogens non-susceptible to one or more antimicrobial combinations. No HAI due to carbapenem non-susceptible E. coli was reported. The incidence density of HAI due to E. coli non-susceptible to 3GC and fluoroquinolones combined was 0.09 (95%CI: 0.07-0.11) per 1,000 patient-days. The incidence proportion of CAI due to E. coli non-susceptible to 3GC and fluoroquinolones combined was 0.24 (95%CI: 0.22-0.27) per 100 admissions. The incidence density of HAI due to K. pneumoniae non-susceptible to 3GC, fluoroquinolones and carbapenem combined was 0.008 (0.004-0.014) per 1,000 patient-days. Incidence densities of HAI due to E. coli and K. pneumonia non-susceptible to 3GC and fluoroquinolones combined were significantly lower compared with the 2014/2015 multi-centre surveillance report in Germany (Figure 4) [14] . No significant differences of incidence densities of HAI due to MDR K. pneumoniae were identified between Dongguan city and Germany.\n\nTen percent (562/5,598) of the pathogens in the combined dataset were isolated from blood. Among these, 41.4% (65/157) of E. coli were non-susceptible to 3GC, but all were susceptible to carbapenems; 19.6% (10/51) and 2.0% (1/51) of K. pneumoniae were nonsusceptible to 3GC and carbapenems, respectively; all of the 15 isolated P. aeruginosa were susceptible to carbapenems; 28.6% (4/14) of A. baumannii were non-susceptible to carbapenems; 21.3% (10/47) of S. aureus were non-susceptible to oxacillin; all 14 isolated E.\n\nfaecalis and all 4 isolated E. faecium were susceptible to vancomycin. Figure 5 compares the incidence proportion of BSI due to MDR indicator pathogens with the 2017 EARS-Net report [7] . \n\nThis study summarises susceptibility of indicator pathogens in Southern China, and highlights incidence proportions of CAI and incidence densities of HAI due to non-susceptible pathogens.\n\nIt not only fills a research gap on prospective AMR incidence surveillance in general, but also provides clinical perspectives about infections due to MDR pathogens in one of the most rapidly developing regions in the World [15, 16] . Interestingly, non-susceptibility was lower than average incidence proportions in Mainland China, and lower than anticipated.\n\nThird-generation cephalosporin-resistance in E. coli and K. pneumoniae remains a major challenge in Dongguan city. It is lower compared with the 2017 CHINET report [11] and other Chinese studies (2017/2018 AMR data: 3GC-resistant E. coli: 56%; and 3GC-resistant K.\n\npneumoniae: 30%) [22] , but similar compared with Thailand (3GC-resistant E. coli in blood: 40%; and 3GC-resistant E. coli in urine: 45%) [6] . The proportion of resistance to carbapenem in K. pneumoniae has emerged from 3.0% in 2005 to 20.9% in 2017 in China [23] . With 4.2%, this proportion was much lower in Dongguan city, but similar to the average of invasive pathogens in Europe (7.2%) [7] . Also similar to the average of invasive MDR pathogens in Europe (3.9%) [7] , 5% of P. aeruginosa were multidrug-resistant in Dongguan city. The proportions of vancomycinresistant E. faecalis (0.7%) in our study was lower compared with the US (8.5%), but similar to Canada (0.1%) and the Asia-Pacific region (0.01%) [24, 25] .\n\nCompared with Germany [14] , incidence densities of HAI due to E. coli and K.\n\npneumoniae with resistance to 3GC and fluoroquinolones combined were significantly lower. On the other hand, the incidence densities of CAI due to E. coli and K. pneumoniae with resistance to 3GC, or 3GC and fluoroquinolones combined were significantly higher. One reason for this may be that 50% of outpatients in China receive antibiotics [26] , particularly cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones [27] . In addition, there is little antimicrobial stewardship in primary care hospitals [28] . Because CAIs are treated without performing microbiological testing, far too many broad-spectrum antimicrobials are prescribed [29] . Furthermore, UTI was the most common HAI type due to 3GC-resistant E. coli, which is consistent with German National study from 2014/2015 [14] .\n\nThe incidence density of infections due to carbapenem-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae together in our study was 0.017 (95%CI: 0.011 -0.025) per 1,000 patient-days. This is lower compared with the 2015 \"China Carbapenems Resistant Enterobacteriaceae Surveillance Project\" (0.041 [95%CI: 0.038 -0.044] per 1,000 patient-days) [30] , but was fourfold higher compared with the \"French National Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacteriaceae Surveillance Project\" (0.0041 per 1,000 patient-days) from 2011 and 2012 [31] . More than two thirds of infections due to carbapenem resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) were in the lower respiratory tract, of which almost half occurred in the ICU. This may be associated with high incidence densities of ventilator-associated pneumonia in China, which ranges from 19.5 to 30.8 infections per 1,000 ventilator days [32, 33] . Therefore, active CRAB screening in patients in the ICU should be envisaged [34] .\n\nBoth E. coli and K. pneumoniae were the predominant pathogens isolated from blood.\n\nThe incidence proportion of BSI due to MDR E. coli was significantly higher compared with the 2017 EARS-Net report [7] , whereas the incidence proportion of BSI due to MDR K. pneumoniae was similar. The incidence proportion of BSIs due to MDR S. aureus in our study was higher compared with the 2017 EARS-Net report [7] , although the difference was not statistically significant. Interestingly, the incidence density of hospital onset BSI due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus in our study was very low (0.004 [95% CI: 0.001-0.009] per 1,000 patient-days), even lower compared with Europe (0.026 [95% CI: 0.021-0.031] per 1,000 patient-days) [35] . A number of factors may explain this finding: 1) the average length-of-stay in our hospitals was longer (6.2-10.6 days) compared with the US (4.5 days) or Europe (5.1 days) [18, 19, 36] , which inflates the denominator; 2) blood culture sampling was low, with a rate of 10.4 (95% CI: 10.1-10.8) performed blood culture sets per 1,000 patient-days. This is significantly lower than e.g. in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, France, or UK (>50 blood culture sets per 1,000 patient-days) [7] .\n\nThis study has limitations. First, microbiology and clinical data could be merged for the subset of three tertiary-care hospitals only. Although the results can be considered representative for tertiary care hospitals in Dongguan city, they may not be for the entire province or other hospital types. Prospective AMR surveillance in the future should aim to link clinical and AMR data. Second, Chinese microbiology laboratories follow the US breakpoints for susceptibility testing [20] , which allowed comparison to CHINET (and other Asian databases) but was limited to compare results with European data, where the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EuCAST) breakpoints are used [37] . To variable degrees, this may have resulted in underestimating the burden of AMR/MDR pathogens in Dongguan city compared with Europe. Third, no colistin resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae were reported in our study, which was unexpected given that colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae have been isolated from food animals in China [38, 39] . Colistin susceptibility was reported only for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii non-susceptible to imipenem in our study; and only rarely for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, which may have underestimated the burden of colistin resistance.\n\nIn conclusion, this is the first study summarising susceptibility of indicator pathogens in Southern China, highlighting incidence proportions of CAI and incidence densities HAI due to non-susceptible pathogens. This study applied a standardised protocol to conduct prospective AMR surveillance and data analysis. The outcomes serve as a reference for infection prevention and control of AMR not only in China, but also in other South Asian countries.
