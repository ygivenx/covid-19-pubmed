{"title": "DGV: Dengue Genographic Viewer", "body": "Dengue viruses (DENVs) are members of the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae and consist of four serotypes (DENV-1 to -4) (Lanciotti et al., 1992; Kuhn et al., 2002). Each serotype can be divided into five to six genotypes. However, there is no standard genotyping classification [DENV-1, (Goncalvez et al., 2002); DENV-2, (Anez et al., 2011; Khan et al., 2013); DENV-3, (Lanciotti et al., 1994; Wittke et al., 2002; Klungthong et al., 2008); DENV-4, (Abubakar et al., 2002)]. DENV has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that is ~11 kb in length and encodes a capsid protein (C), premembrane protein (prM), and envelope glycoprotein (E) in addition to seven non-structural proteins (NSs, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). DENV infection causes dengue illness, which may range from dengue fever (a mild illness) to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (the severe forms of the illness) in addition to asymptomatic cases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; http://www.cdc.gov/dengue/clinicalLab/clinical.html). Infection results in lifetime immunity against the same serotype, but successive exposure to different DENVs increases the likelihood of contracting a severe form of dengue illness, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome (Chiappelli et al., 2014).\n\nDENV and its vectors have become widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world (Murray et al., 2013). An autochthonous case of DENV infection was reported in Tokyo, Japan, in 2014 for the first time in 70 years (Kutsuna et al., 2015). To ensure prompt action in response to a DENV outbreak, a comprehensive DENV database based on the genotypes would be essential for tracing the outbreak source. To date, only two DENV databases provide genotype information. The web service ViPR1 (Pickett et al., 2012) supports genetic analysis based on the viral genome for a tested input sequence, including DENV sequences. The second database is the Dengue virus genotyping database2 (Yamashita et al., 2013), which provides a summary table containing the DENV serotype/genotype, year and country of collection and accession number. There are many other DENV databases; however, no other sites provide summarized genotype information. The Dengue Virus Resource3 facilitates the retrieval of DENV sequences deposited in GenBank according to serotype, disease symptom, host, region/country, genome region, and collection and/or release data (Resch et al., 2009). DENVirDB4 provides sequence information and computationally curated information of dengue viral proteins (Asnet et al., 2014). DENVDB focuses on the dengue virus sequence database for keyword searches (no publication: http://proline.bic.nus.edu.sg/denvdb/). Finally, the Dengue Virus Portal is a sequence collection with metadata (no publication: https://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/viral/Dengue/Home.html).\n\nHere, we constructed the website Dengue Genographic Viewer (DGV), which presents DENV information based on the genotype and epidemiological data by using the geographic tool Google Maps\u00a9 to update the recent dissemination of DENV genotypes from a global perspective.\n\nThe DENV genotype database was constructed as follows: (1) all accessible DENV nucleotide sequences were collected; (2) the complete sequences of each protein region (C, prM, E, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) were extracted from the sequences; (3) a blastn homology search was performed against the genotype database and the genotype of the most homologous sequence was assigned; (4) and the genotype data were stored in a database using SQLite (https://www.sqlite.org/).\n\nThe above processes except for the original database construction are performed automatically every night to update the recent DENV database.\n\nWe implemented a set of viewer applications on DGV by using Google Maps\u00a9, which shows the data in a temporal and spatial manner. One application presents the geographical distribution of each DENV genotype on the map in a user-specified time span. Another option is a homology search program that searches for the most homologous DENV sequence in the DGV database and show the geographical positions of closely related sequences on the map. The other interface shows the sources of imported dengue cases on the map, according to the Infectious Agents Surveillance Report (IASR), Japan (http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/iasr-e.html). This set of applications is available at the DGV web site (https://gph.niid.go.jp/geograph/dengue/content/genomemap).\n\nOn March 4, 2016, DGV included a total of 10,514 DENV sequences, which consisted of 3872, 3414, 2309, and 919 DENV serotype-1, -2, -3, and -4 sequences, respectively (Table 1). Some genotypes have been abundantly sequenced and deposited in the public database, whereas other genotypes have rarely been sequenced (i.e., DENV-1 genotype II was reported in only seven records from 1960 to 2012, DENV-4 genotype III was also reported in only seven records from 1997 to 2001, and DENV-3 genotype IV has not been reported since 1977). These rare genotypes may have become minor populations or may be undergoing a silent transmission cycle (Lanciotti et al., 1994; Chen and Vasilakis, 2011; Santiago et al., 2012).\n\nFifteen years' worth of data from 2000 to 2014 for all serotypes showed that DENV sequences were primarily reported from South to Southeast Asia, Central to South America, and the countries of Oceania (Figure 1A). Some biases in DENV serotype compositions were observed in several countries. For instance, the dominant serotypes were DENV-1 and -2 in Mexico, DENV-1 and -4 in Polynesian countries with the exception of Fiji, and DENV-2 and -3 in Pakistan. In contrast, all serotypes were sampled in Brazil and Thailand.\n\nIntriguingly, when focusing on the genotype instead of the serotype, the data from 2000 to 2014 showed at least three potential geographical genotype distribution border lines in Asia (Figures 1B,2). The first border is between the American continents and other regions (Figure 1B), the second is located between Bangladesh and Myanmar for the genotype distributions of DENV-1 and -2 and India and Myanmar for DENV-3, and the third is located between Indochina and the Malay Peninsula (Figure 2). There seem to be differences in the DENV-1 and -3 distributions between Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia; however, the border line is not clear because Malaysia and Indonesia consist of many islands and share Kalimantan Island and the deposited sequence data do not specify the original island isolation site. Although, some boundaries are not clear, these boundaries are roughly conserved among all serotypes except for the Bangladesh-Myanmar border line for DENV-4, suggesting potential barriers against the vector mosquitos' movements or human activities between the countries.\n\nWe also found a timeline change in the predominant genotypes. From 1998 to 2007, the dominant genotype in Asia was Cosmopolitan, although India-Pakistan-Sri Lanka and Southeast-Oceania belonged to different lineages (Khan et al., 2013). The major genotypes in the Indochina countries were different from those of the other Asian countries; genotype Asian I was predominant in Thailand, whereas genotype Asian American was predominant in Cambodia and Vietnam (Figure 3 and Movie S1). From 2001, Asian I increased in Cambodia and Vietnam until finally in 2007 Asian I became the predominant genotype in Indochina. The genotype Asian I viruses in Thailand seemed to be widely disseminated into Vietnam via Cambodia but did not reach Malaysia and Bangladesh (Figure 2). Thus, the Asian American genotype was replaced by Asian I in Cambodia and Vietnam between 1998 and 2011. This example also suggests the idea of genotype transition, which probably reflects the mosquito vector habitat and human activities in the Indochinese Peninsula.\n\nDGV currently does not support the prediction of Dengue epidemics, because number of deposited sequence data does not always reflect the actual number of events, in addition, it takes long time to be a public sequence through isolation, sequencing, and publication.\n\nDGV provides a search engine for the assignment of the DENV serotype, genotype, and origin country according to the most homologous sequence on the basis of a blastn search against the DENV database. The search results are shown as text and are also plotted through Google Maps\u00a9. Subsequently, the query sequence is divided into mature protein regions and displayed with a serotype/genotype assignment. The homology search results and the divided nucleotide sequences in fasta format can be downloaded.\n\nHere, we present an example similarity search for an Env sequence derived from an autochthonous case in Japan (LC006123 or gi: 698162713). DGV assigned the sequence as the Env region of the DENV-1 genotype I and identified homologous sequences from Japan, China, Singapore and Indonesia. These results are consistent with those from a previous study (Figure 4; Kutsuna et al., 2015).\n\nTo aid in visualizing the source countries of dengue infection cases imported to Japan, the number of annual imported cases was also mapped on Google Maps\u00a9. The serotype (but not genotype), year, and visiting country/area are also indicated based on the Infectious Agents Surveillance Report (IASR), which releases monthly data and information obtained from prefectural and municipal public health institutes and quarantine stations to the public (Figure 5).\n\nAY performed the experimental design, participated in the analysis and drafted the manuscript.
