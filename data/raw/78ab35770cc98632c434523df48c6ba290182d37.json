{"title": "Excess cases of Influenza like illnesses in France synchronous with COVID19 invasion. Pierre-Yves Bo\u00eblle 1 and the Sentinelles syndromic and viral surveillance group", "body": "Influenza Like illnesses cases are defined as cases with fever of sudden onset (>39\u00b0C) with respiratory signs (cough, running nose) and myalgia of any age. Acute Respiratory Infection (AIR) include diseases with respiratory signs and are only monitored in the > 65 y.o. Cases are reported in real time by participating GPs (approx. 600 GPs) all over France. Additionally, Sentinelles GPs may swab 1 ILI case and up to 2 IRA cases per week for viral characterization (3) . Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus are routinely looked for, and SARS-CoV-2 has been added since February 2020.\n\nWe computed the expected number of ILI consultations using the superposition of a seasonal (4) and an influenza epidemic component (5) , as detailed in the appendix. Excess cases were computed as the difference between observed cases and expected numbers. The rate of increase in excess cases was determined, assuming exponential growth.\n\nConfirmed COVID19 cases were obtained from the sant\u00e9 Publique France website, March 7 Bulletin(6).\n\nIn week 10 of 2020, 93 swabs were collected in ILI patients and 23 in ARI patients. Two (2) swabs in each category were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The 2 positive swabs in ARI patients had been collected in In Bourgogne-Franche Comt\u00e9 (BFC) and Grand Est (GRE) regions, out of a total of 7 swabs in these 2 regions. Assuming a positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 of 2/7 in these regions, we estimated that 760 (CI95% [219, 1706]) ARI consultations in the > 65 y.o. could have been caused by COVID19 during week 10 (2/7 of 2600 ARI visits). One of the positive ILI case was linked to an existing cluster in the east of France.\n\nThe modelling approach allowed computing excess cases in 11 out of 13 regions. The model did not provide a good fit in the remaining 2 regions (see appendix). The overall ILI incidence showed renewed increase with 33 [-8, 64] consultations/100000 in excess during week 9 and 84 [447, 108] consultations/100000 in excess in week 10. This changed with regions: 4/11 regions displayed positive excess (credible interval excluding 0) in week 9 and 7/11 regions in week 10. \n\nIn the last 30 seasons of routine surveillance in France with the Sentinelles network, this is the first time that an increase in ILI cases is observed simultaneously in several regions after the peak of the annual influenza epidemic.\n\nSeveral processes may be at play in this observation, including at least characteristics of the influenza season, change in population behaviour or increase in COVID19 incidence.\n\ncan lead to prolonged periods for decrease in incidence but a renewed increase has never occurred before (1). The school holidays occurred gradually in France during the end of February and early\n\nMarch. While this may change the dynamics of influenza (7), the effect is generally notable in the ascending phase of the epidemic rather than after the peak.\n\nThe current situation with COVID19 may change the health-seeking behaviour of patients and, to some extent, of the contributing general practitioners although they conform to a case definition.\n\nPreliminary assessment of behavioural data in crowdsourced surveillance system is under way (grippenet.fr(8)) but, as of today, no massive trend towards more consultations has been observed.\n\nAs information regarding the coronavirus risk is widespread, a uniform increase over all regions could have been expected in this scenario, but we acknowledge that it may have led to increased consultation rates in regions where COVID19 is the most reported.\n\nThe overlap between COVID19 and flu symptoms makes it possible that the excess of ILI cases is due to COVID19 cases, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 positive swabs in the patients demonstrate this possibility. The correlation between the number of confirmed cases and the computed excess is also consistent with this scenario. In this case, the excess in cases is compatible with an exponential growth with rate estimated at approximately 0.7/week. Interestingly, this estimate is very similar from one region to the next in the four most affected regions (GRE, IDF, OCC, HDF). This estimate may prove useful to help calibrate models for studying the impact of the COVID19 pandemic.\n\nEstimating the true number of COVID19 cases remains difficult in the presence of these uncertainties. We note that the extrapolated number of COVID19 presenting as ARI was 760 in the >65 y.o. in the 2 eastern regions (GRE and BFC), which was at least twice more than the number of reported cases at the time (250+129), all ages confounded.\n\nAs we enter a period of generalized circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, surveillance based on clinical description and swabbing by GPs will prove essential to help us assess the situation. .
