{"title": "Monitoring the Systemic Human Memory B Cell Compartment of Melanoma\nPatients for Anti-Tumor IgG Antibodies", "body": "Malignant melanoma, the most fatal form of skin cancer, arises from\nmalignantly-transformed melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis. The\nincidence of melanoma has been increasing at an accelerated rate in the past few\ndecades amongst fair skinned populations [1] and advanced forms of the disease\nare highly resistant to treatment [2], [3]. Thus, an urgent need exists for novel therapies and\nearlier diagnosis.\n\nMelanoma is widely thought to be immunogenic, supported by clinical observations such\nas the frequency of spontaneous tumor regressions, the prevalence of melanoma in\nimmunosuppressed patients, and the partial success of clinically-available immune\nmodulatory therapies such as the polyclonal immune activating cytokines IFN\u03b1-2b\nand IL- 2 [4],\n[5],\n[6], [7]. Host adaptive\nimmune responses have been described in melanoma with a main focus on melanoma\nspecific T cell responses [8], [9], and supported by successful case scenarios using\nimmunotherapeutic strategies such as dendritic cell vaccines, adoptive T cell\ntherapies, and CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies [7], [10], [11], [12], [13].\n\nLimited research has focused on B cells and the specificity of antibodies they\nproduce in cancer. Promotion of cancer development by the creation of a\npro-inflammatory environment [14], [15] and anti-tumor functions by activating mature T cell\nresponses [16]\nhave been proposed as potential roles for B cells in animal models of cancer. While\nthere may be host immune responses to malignancy following immunization [17], a variety\nof mechanisms involved in tumor escape have been described and understanding this\ncomplex relationship between immunosurveillance and tumor escape in patients is key\nto the design of effective immunotherapies [18], [19], [20], [21].\n\nDespite well-characterized tumor-induced immunomodulation, immunotherapies such as\nmonoclonal antibodies are emerging as key diagnostic and therapeutic modalities and\nare now standard of care for the treatment of various cancers. Antibodies for the\ntreatment of melanoma aimed at enhancing key pathways of T cell activation\n(Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte-Associated Antigen 4, e.g. Ipilimumab), targeting tumor\nvasculature (e.g. Bevacizumab), or tumor-associated antigens (e.g. High Molecular\nWeight-Melanoma Associated Antigen, HMW-MAA) have demonstrated promise in clinical\nstudies [13], [22], [23], [24]. Antibodies\ntherefore represent an attractive approach for the treatment of melanoma.\n\nReports of tumor-specific antibodies in the sera of melanoma patients date back over\nforty years [25]\nand have so far provided valuable insight into immune responses to cancer.\nSerological studies of individuals with melanoma have shown that patients expressing\ncertain tumor-associated antigens have antibodies against these antigens,\nconversely, patients without the antibodies also lack the corresponding tumor\nantigens [26].\nThese studies have been restricted to few antibodies in sera against known\ntumor-associated antigens. Serological studies reported IgG antibodies recognizing\nintracellular melanocyte and melanoma-associated antigens such as tyrosinase,\ntyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, TRP-2, and melanoma-associated glycoprotein\nantigen family (gp100/pmel17) in patients with melanoma. Serum-resident antibodies\nto some of these antigens were enhanced following polyvalent melanoma cell vaccine\nimmunization in patients with melanoma, suggesting that melanoma-associated antigens\nmay be immunogenic and that humoral responses to melanocyte and melanoma antigens\nmay constitute potential targets for immunotherapy [27]. New antigens, such as the\nNY-ESO-1, with restricted expression in normal tissues and wide distribution in\nvarious cancers including melanoma have been discovered using serological analysis\nof recombinant cDNA expression libraries (SEREX) techniques tested against tumor\nmRNA and autologous patient sera [28]. SEREX studies from human melanomas [29] and from one cell line [30] have led to the\ndiscovery of the human testis antigen HOM-MEL-40. Many of these antigens are\nprimarily intracellular, making them less attractive targets as monoclonal\nantibodies. Furthermore, serological screens may also be limited by the temporal\ndynamics of sera antibodies. Evaluating the reactivity of antibodies secreted by\ncirculating B cells may therefore provide additional insight to serological\nevaluations by interrogating the long-term memory anti-tumor systemic mature humoral\nresponse to cancer.\n\nThe production of tumor-specific antibodies in melanoma from patient-derived B cells\nin the peripheral blood and tumors has been reported and has yielded a few\nantibodies of the IgM and IgG class [31], [32], [33], [34]. In the past, such studies have\nbeen limited by poor EBV transformation efficiency of human B cells, low production\nof immunoglobulin, evaluation of few patients, and lack of effective, reproducible\nmethods to rapidly screen for tumor-specific antibodies. To address some of these\nlimitations, we took advantage of recent advances in growing and immortalizing\nmemory B cells in culture [35], [36], increased the number of patients evaluated, and\ndeveloped a novel screening tool to specifically detect tumor-reactive antibodies\nagainst cell surface antigens on melanoma cells. Our approach entails culture of\npatient-derived circulating B cells and screening of the antibodies they secrete for\ntheir reactivity and specificity to melanoma cells versus melanocytes. Our strategy\ndoes not screen for antibodies against known antigens or evaluate antibodies\nsecreted or sequestered in the serum at discrete times, but rather uniquely, the aim\nhere is to monitor tumor cell-reactive IgG antibodies produced by B cell cultures,\nelucidating the breadth of the long-term mature B cell repertoire recognizing\nmelanoma antigens expressed on the surface of cancer cells.\n\nIn this study, we screen for tumor-reactive and tumor-specific IgG antibodies\nproduced by patient and healthy individual B cell cultures. This allowed\ncharacterization, beyond phenotype, of the circulating B cell repertoire of\nindividuals with melanoma and clinical correlations of mature humoral responses and\ndisease progression. We also provide an example demonstrating that this screen may\nfacilitate the identification of antibodies able to target cancer cells.\n\nWe developed and optimized a cell-based ELISA for specific detection of\ntumor-reactive antibodies in order to obtain a robust and optimized system for\nthe detection of anti-tumor antibodies from patients (Figure S1).\nWe first evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of an IgG antibody against a\nmelanoma cell surface antigen (HMW-MAA), expressed on A-375 melanoma cells using\nimmunocytochemistry (cytospins) and live cell flow cytometry. An anti-HMW-MAA\nantibody was observed to bind to A-375 cells, but not melanocytes over a range\nof concentrations as low as 20 ng/mL using both immunocytochemistry (Figure 1, A) and flow\ncytometry (Figure 1, B).\nNext, we compared the detection of this antibody bound to melanoma cells in our\ncell-based ELISA to the above methods.\n\nUtilizing our novel ELISA, we detected tumor-specific antibodies at\nconcentrations as low 10 ng/mL (Figure 1, C), demonstrating comparable sensitivity to flow\ncytometric or immunocytochemical methods. Additionally, we validated our ability\nto identify tumor-reactive antibodies from our patient cultures, compared to\nequal amounts of non-specific IgG and culture media (Figure 1, D). We also examined the potential\napplicability of this method to identify tumor-specific antibodies in other\ncancers using the mammary carcinoma cell line SK-BR-3, which highly expresses\nthe cell surface tumor-associated antigen HER2/neu\n[37].\nTrastuzumab (Herceptin\u2122), a humanized antibody specific for\nHER2/neu, was specifically detected compared to an equal\namount of a control IgG employing our method (Figure 1, D). Thus, we demonstrate that we\ncan detect antibodies against tumor cell antigens in a sensitive, specific and\nreproducible manner.\n\nWe first established B cell cultures from the peripheral blood of melanoma\npatients to study antibody responses to cancer (Figure S1).\nIn agreement with a previously published report, we detected a reduced memory B\ncell subset in melanoma patients. Melanoma patient and healthy volunteer B cells\nwere cultured with B cell purity greater than 90%. Following EBV\ntransformation and activation with a TLR9 agonist, patient B cells were observed\nto proliferate in culture for over eight weeks and 80% of the cells in\nthese cultures were IgG positive. B cell cultures derived from healthy\nvolunteers (n = 5) and melanoma patients\n(n = 5) had comparable mean antibody titers after 18 days,\nranging from 1 to 7 \u00b5g from each individual, with an overall mean of 2.5\n\u00b5g (95% CI  =  2.3 to 2.7) per culture arising\nfrom 500 B cells per well. We therefore established antibody-secreting cultures\nfrom melanoma patients with comparable rates of IgG secretion to healthy\nvolunteers.\n\nWe next investigated whether specific antibody responses to melanoma could be\ndetected from circulating B cells of patients and healthy volunteers utilizing\nour cell-based ELISA. Antibody-secreting B cell cultures from 10 healthy\nvolunteers and 10 patients (n = 4 stage II,\nn = 4 stage III, and n = 2 stage IV)\nwere evaluated for reactivity to both metastatic and primary melanoma cells\nrelative to non-specific human IgG control (calculated as fold increase above\nthe non-specific human IgG control) employing our cell-based ELISA. We found a\nsignificant (P<0.0001) increase in the mean reactivity (fold\nincrease) of patient-derived antibody cultures (n = 600) to\nmetastatic melanoma cells (2.5 fold increase, 95% CI\n =  2.4 to 2.6) compared to antibody cultures\n(n = 600) derived from healthy volunteers (1.1 fold\nincrease, 95% CI  =  1.1 to 1.2) (Figure 2, A). A significant\n(P<0.0001) increase was also seen in the mean reactivity\nof patient-derived antibodies to primary melanoma cells (2.3 fold increase,\n95% CI  =  2.2 to 2.4) compared to antibodies from\nhealthy volunteers (1.0 fold increase, 95% CI  = \n1.0 to 1.1) (Figure 2, B).\nFrom this patient cohort, we thus observed a significantly increased reactivity\nto primary and metastatic melanoma cells, compared to healthy volunteers.\n\nTo examine if antibody responses differ according to disease stage, we studied a\ncohort of 21 patients diagnosed with stage I, II, III and IV melanoma (Table 1) and evaluated the\nreactivity of antibody cultures (n = 1,800) from these\npatients to the metastatic melanoma cell line A-375 utilizing the cell-based\nELISA. This patient cohort was almost exclusively Caucasian. Antibody reactivity\nagainst melanoma cells was quantified relative to a non-specific human IgG\ncontrol and measured as fold increase above this negative control. Patients with\nlocal (non-metastatic, stages I and II) disease had a significantly\n(P<0.0001) higher mean antibody response (2.6 fold\nincrease, 95% CI  =  2.4 to 2.8) compared to those\nwith confirmed metastatic disease (stages III and IV, 1.7 fold increase,\n95% CI  =  1.7 to 1.8) (Figure 3, A). We also found an overall\nsignificant reduction (P<0.0001) in the mean reactivity of antibodies\nsecreted in B cell cultures against melanoma cells from stage II (2.8 fold\nincrease, 95% CI  =  2.6 to 3.0,\nn = 660) to stage III (1.9 fold increase, 95% CI\n =  1.8 to 2.0, n = 540) and to stage\nIV patients (1.5 fold increase, 95% CI 1.5 to 1.6,\nn = 480) (Figure 3, B). The stage I patient was not evaluated since samples\nfrom only one patient (n = 120 B cell cultures) from the\ncohort was available to include in this group. The highest mean antibody\nreactivity against melanoma cells was observed in Patients 5 and 6 diagnosed\nwith stage II and III melanoma, respectively (Table 1). However, we observed variation in\nthe antibody response among individual patients, with 19 out of 21 patients in\nour cohort having at least one antibody-producing culture with optical density\nvalues 2.5-fold above the negative IgG control (Table 1). These findings suggest that despite\nthe significant reduction in the proportion of tumor-reactive antibody cultures\nas a function of disease progression, patients from each of stage groups had B\ncells with antibodies that recognized tumor cells.\n\nWe screened for tumor-reactive antibodies from patient B cell cultures and\napproximated frequency and specificity of selected cultures to tumor cells. For\nthis we screened B cell culture supernatants against a stringent comparator\nusing a positive control monoclonal antibody, Trastuzumab, that recognizes the\nHER2/neu tumor antigen, expressed on breast cancer cells\nand on some melanoma cells [38]. Trastuzumab was selected as a positive control\nbecause of comparable binding across melanoma cell lines and melanocytes, as\nshown by mean fluorescence intensities of antibody binding against a range of\nthese cells (Figure 4, A).\nPrevious studies screening for tumor-specific antibodies have selected wells\ngreater than the mean negative control optical density (OD) + three\nstandard deviations as criteria for positive tumor-reactive antibodies [39]. Due to the\ninherent variability of cell-based assays, and the potential identification of\nfalse positive cultures, we chose more stringent criteria for antibody\nscreening, by comparing antibodies produced by B cells to a positive control\nantibody (> 75% OD of positive control). Based on this antibody\nselection criteria (>75% OD of positive control), we estimate that\n28% of B cell cultures (n = 1,800) derived from 21\npatients, each arising from 500 B cells, produced antibodies that recognized\nmetastatic melanoma cells, compared to 2% (n = 600)\nof cultures derived from 10 healthy volunteers (Figure 4, B). From these 10 healthy\nvolunteers, 2 individuals had one reactive culture (out of 60 cultures), 1\nindividual had 10 reactive cultures, and the rest of the cohort had no reactive\ncultures.\n\nFrom our patient cohort, we can roughly estimate the frequency of B cells that\nproduce an antibody that recognizes melanoma cells under the assumption that a\nreactive antibody culture, defined as having an OD >75% of the\npositive control, arises from only a single B cell (1 out of 500 plated per\nculture). By dividing the total number positive antibody cultures from the\npatient cohort by the total number of B cells evaluated from the patient cohort\nby the number of positive antibody cultures, we roughly approximate that from\nour patient cohort one out of 1,765 B cells produce an antibody that may\nrecognize melanoma cells.\n\nTo estimate the frequency of melanoma-reactive antibody-producing B cells in\nmelanoma patients we performed limiting dilution analysis. We selected a stage\nII patient, who, we predict, may have a high antibody response to melanoma,\nbased on our findings that the antibody responses were highest in this group\n(Figure 3, B). For this\nstage II patient (Patient 15, see Table 1) from our limiting dilution analysis assays using the\ncell-based ELISA, we estimate that one out of 1,790 peripheral blood B cells\nproduces antibodies that bind to A-375 melanoma cells (Figure 4, C). For this same patient, the\nfrequency of B cells producing antibodies that react with melanocytes was also\nevaluated at the same B cell densities as melanoma cells. We did not observe a\ncomparable patient antibody response to melanocytes as we did to melanoma cells,\nsuggesting a much lower frequency of antibodies that bind to normal cells of the\nsame origin (Figure 4, C\nleft).\n\nLimiting dilution analysis against two additional metastatic (SK-MEL-28, A-2058)\nand one primary (WM-115) melanoma cell lines for the same patient yielded\ndifferent but comparable frequencies to A-375 for the metastatic cell lines\n(SK-MEL-28, 1 out of 1,650 B cells; A-2058, 1 out of 1,170 cells), and a much\nlower frequency of antibodies that bind to the primary melanoma line WM-115\nwhich was similar to that observed with primary melanocytes (Figure 4, C right). For this\npatient, the data suggest detectable circulating B cell humoral response\nfrequency against metastatic melanoma cells and lower frequency for normal human\nmelanocytes or primary melanoma cells. To further confirm the frequency\nobservations for the patient-derived circulating B cell repertoire, we performed\nadditional limiting dilution assays for another stage II patient (Patient 21,\nTable 1). For Patient\n21, we estimate 1 out of 2,430 B cells that produces antibodies bind to the same\nmelanoma cell line tested for Patient 15 (Figure 4, D), suggesting lower but comparable\nfrequency to those estimated for B cells from Patient 15. In summary, applying\nthe above methodology, these results suggest that tumor-reactive antibodies from\ncirculating B cells are more frequent in melanoma patients than healthy\nvolunteers and more frequent against a range of metastatic melanoma cells\ncompared to normal melanocytes.\n\nWe then selected patient-derived, tumor-specific antibodies in order to further\nevaluate their reactivity to melanoma cells, and conducted a preliminary\nassessment of the potential functional capabilities of a patient-derived\nantibody from this screen. B cell culture wells were selected based on stringent\ncriteria (OD > 75% positive control antibody), using the cell-based\nELISA. Tumor specificity of antibody cultures was evaluated by comparing binding\nof antibodies from these cultures against multiple melanoma cells (A-375,\nSK-MEL-2, WM-115) versus normal cells (Figure 5, A). We observed multiple antibody\ncultures with a higher degree of binding to some melanoma cells compared to\nmelanocytes from the same patient (Patient 3, Figure 5, A; a selection of five of these\ncultures is shown on Figure 5,\nB). Similar results were obtained when we screened for tumor-specific\ncultures from different patients against melanoma cells and melanocytes.\nPositive cultures with different binding patterns against four melanoma cell\nlines (A-375, SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL-28, WM-115) and primary human melanocytes were\ndetected (selected cultures derived from Patients 2, 3, 4 and 6 are shown as\nexamples in Figure 5, C),\nreflecting specificity and reactivity of different antibodies to a range of\nantigens expressed at different levels in a number of melanoma cell lines, and\nsome reactivity to antigens lowly expressed on human melanocytes. Selection of a\ntumor-positive antibody culture for sub-cloning and limiting dilution was based\non degree of reactivity to melanoma cells relative to melanocytes (Figure 5, C).\n\nOne B cell culture from Patient 6 was selected for further evaluation since cell\nculture supernatants were observed to have a higher degree of binding to A-375\nand SK-MEL-28 cells compared to melanocytes by ELISA (Figure 5, C; right). After limiting dilution\nof this melanoma-reactive B cell culture, a monoclonal antibody (6_2G3) was\nfurther assessed for specificity to 6 melanoma cell lines, melanocytes and\nfibroblasts by live cell flow cytometry (Figure 6). Since more antibody was available\nafter monoclonal dilution, 2 additional melanoma cell lines along with dermal\nfibroblasts were evaluated. In concordance with the cell-based ELISA findings\n(Figure 5, C), the 6_2G3\nclone bound to a range of melanoma cell lines, but not to melanocytes (Figure 6). The antibody had no\nreactivity against primary human dermal fibroblasts. In summary, by evaluating\nthe specificity of antibodies to melanoma cells versus melanocytes and\nfibroblasts we could identify a melanoma-specific monoclonal antibody clone\n6_2G3. While we had limited amounts of monoclonal antibodies our B cell culture\nsupernatants after evaluating melanoma-cell specificity, we were able to conduct\na limited functional investigation of this antibody.\n\nUsing clone 6_2G3, we wished to assess whether a patient-derived antibody has\npotential cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. We tested the tumor cell\nkilling potential of this antibody using a real-time live-dead cell cytotoxicity\nassay using as targets metastatic melanoma cells recognized by this clone (Figure 7 & Supporting\nVideos S1 and S2). In these experiments, U-937 human monocytic cells which\nexpress Fc\u03b3 receptors served as effector cells [40] and A-375 melanoma\ncells were used as target cells to evaluate antibody-dependent cellular\ncytotoxicity (ADCC) of tumor cells mediated by patient-derived IgG antibodies.\nWe tested two monoclonal antibodies, both derived from Patient 6 (Table 1): (1) the 6_2G3\nantibody, which bound to A-375 cells and not melanocytes and (2) the 6_2D10\nantibody, which did not bind to A-375 cells or melanocytes in the cell based\nELISA prior to limiting dilution, which served as a non-tumor-reactive control\n(Figure 7).\n\nAfter 2 hours in culture, 18% (95% CI  =  -5\nto 41%) of tumor cells given the melanoma-specific antibody were viable,\ncompared to 95% (95% CI  =  86 to\n104%) of the tumor cells given the non-melanoma specific antibody\n(P<0.0001) (Figure 7, A, left). Relative to tumor cell fluorescence at the start\nof the assay, mean green/live tumor cell fluorescent intensity was reduced to\n64% for the non-tumor specific antibody (6_2D10) compared to 18%\nfor the tumor-specific antibody (6_2G3) (Figure 7, A, right). These results highlight\nthe potential of a patient derived tumor-specific antibody to kill tumor cells\nby antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (Figure 7, B and see Videos S1 and\nS2). For tumor cells treated with the tumor-specific 6_2G3 antibody,\nwe also observed a significant (P  = \n0.0002) reduction in the movement of monocytic effector cells in contact with\ntumor (13 \u00b5m, 95% CI  =  10 to 17 \u00b5m)\ncompared to effector cells not in contact with tumor (26 \u00b5m, 95%\nCI =  21 to 31 \u00b5m) (Figure 7, C and D). Using the 6_2D10\nnon-specific antibody, no significant\n(P = 0.3) difference was observed for the\nmovement of effector cells not in contact with tumor cells (20 \u00b5m,\n95% CI =  15 to 25 \u00b5m) compared to those in\ncontact with tumor cells (25 \u00b5m, 95% CI = 18\nto 31). With this example, we demonstrate that a patient-derived tumor-specific\nantibody is capable of engaging immune effector cells in antibody-dependent\ncellular cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Taken together, these data suggest\nthat systemic melanoma-specific mature B cell responses may be present in\npatients with melanoma and may harbor the potential to be activated against\ncancer cells.\n\nWe describe an approach to study the circulating B cell-derived humoral immune\nresponse to cancer and apply this to detect tumor-specific IgG antibodies from\nmelanoma patient B cells. This strategy has the potential to be applied to any type\nof cancer. Findings presented herein complement previous serological studies,\nproviding added insight into the mature systemic B cell response to melanoma.\n\nAs a first step to evaluate the tumor reactivity and specificity of patient B\ncell-derived IgG antibodies, we developed a medium-throughput cell-based ELISA with\nmelanoma cells to detect antibodies against tumor cell surface antigens (Figure 1). Cells were allowed to\ngrow and adhere on to 96-well plates prior to being preserved by a light fixative\n(0.5% formaldehyde). While preserving the cells and allowing for storage and\naccess to multiple plates at any one time, light fixation with formalin allows\npreservation of potentially-antigenic epitopes on the surface of target cells.\nPrevious studies have reported cell-based ELISA methods to identify tumor-specific\nantibodies in melanoma [39], [41], where tumor cells were preserved using strong fixatives\nsuch as glutaraldehyde, known to potentially mask antigenic epitopes, thus\ncompromising the recognition of antigens by antibodies [42]. Furthermore, the specificity\nand sensitivity of such methods has not been reported using antibodies against known\ncell surface antigens. Although many intracellular melanoma associated antigens have\nbeen described (tyrosinase, TRP-1, TRP-2, gp100/pmel17), most are also expressed by\nnormal melanocytes, only a few defined cell surface antigens such as the High\nMolecular Weight Melanoma-Associated Antigen (HMW-MAA) are reported to be expressed\non the surface of melanoma cells, and other antigens show heterogeneous expression\namong patients [43],\n[44]. Thus,\nthis ELISA constitutes an attractive tool to evaluate broad responses to any\nnaturally-expressed antigens on the surface of melanoma cells and melanocytes in\nthis context. This screening methodology has additional potential advantages. Unlike\nassays screening against a single recombinant antigen or antigenic epitope, our\nmethod enables the evaluation of antibody repertoires of patients against a\nmultitude of cell surface antigens in their native confirmation on the surface of\nboth primary and metastatic melanoma cells and also melanocytes, providing more\ncomprehensive information on the broad prevalence of tumor-reactive and\ntumor-specific antibodies. Previous studies have shown concordance of cell\nline-associated antigens with antigens expressed on corresponding tumors, making\nthem a suitable platform for tumor-reactive antibody screening [26], [45]. Thus, cell lines provide a\npromising alternative source of multiple tumor antigens in the absence of multiple\nwell-defined, highly expressed, and readily available recombinant antigens. Unlike\nflow cytometric evaluations, the cell-based ELISA does not require the use of\nproteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, therefore better preserving cell surface\nantigens. Plates of target cells can be prepared, fixed and frozen in batches, thus\nallowing for higher throughput screening for tumor cell-reactive antibodies. It can\nbe applied to evaluate > 300 culture supernatants against cell lines within a few\nhours. In principle, numerous ELISA plates for screening a range of cell lines with\nmultiple supernatant samples can be processed simultaneously. Additionally, this\nmethodology may be a potential tool for immunomonitoring tumor-specific humoral\nresponses to therapies; selecting patients most likely to benefit from\nimmunotherapy; or as a prognostic factor in linking tumor-reactive humoral responses\nto clinical outcomes. This assay may also be utilized to detect surface antigens in\na range of cell types, and thus may be adapted to monitor the B cell-derived\nantibody repertoire in different disease contexts.\n\nIn agreement with a recent report [46], we also observed a reduction in the peripheral blood\nmemory B cell compartment of metastatic melanoma patients. We measured a reduction\nof the CD27+ subset of memory B cells in patients with both metastatic and\nnon-metastatic melanoma compared to healthy volunteers (Figure S2).\nDespite the reduction of circulating memory B cells in our cohort, patient-derived B\ncells were capable of secreting high amounts of IgG antibodies when activated\nin vitro with a TLR 9 agonist, with comparable antibody\nproduction to B cells from healthy individuals, and a high percentage of patient-\nand healthy volunteer-derived B cells expressed IgG antibodies within a few days in\nculture (80% of B cells from three patients with melanoma, Figure S2).\nThus, while a reduced memory B compartment has been reported in cancer patients, we\nshow that a melanoma-reactive portion of this compartment remains in our patient\ncohort.\n\nWe demonstrated a high prevalence of melanoma patient-derived antibodies produced by\ncirculating B cells in cancer patients that recognize melanoma cell lines (Figure 2). We observed that B cell\nculture supernatants from different patients displayed differential binding to each\ncell line, which reflects specificity and reactivity of different antibodies to a\nrange of antigens expressed at different levels in a number of melanoma cell lines;\nthese may also reflect binding to some antigens lowly expressed on human melanocytes\n(Figure 4 and Table 1). Melanoma patients had\na high percentage of melanoma-reactive antibody-producing B cell cultures,\nsignificantly higher than those from healthy volunteer-derived B cell cultures\n(Figure 2), with 28%\nof melanoma patient-derived B cell cultures recognizing melanoma cells, compared to\n2% of cultures from healthy volunteers (Figure 4). Limiting dilution analyses of\nreactivity against melanoma cells versus normal melanocytes provided further\nevidence in support of the presence and frequency of tumor-reactive B cells in\npatient blood (Figure 4). For\none stage II patient evaluated, the data indicate that metastatic melanoma cells are\nrecognized by a higher proportion of B cells (estimated on average \u223c 1 in 2,000\nmature B cells) compared to primary melanoma cells or melanocytes, although in a\ncohort of 10 patients we measured reactivity of B cell cultures to both metastatic\nand primary melanoma cell lines (Figure\n2). Taking into consideration the expected variability in immune\nresponses among patients, and the array of tumor antigens these patients may be\nexposed to, the observations that B cells from two patients with stage II melanoma\nyielded comparable reactivity to metastatic melanoma cells (estimated 1 in 1,790 for\nPatient 15, and 1 in 2,430 B cells for Patient 21) indicate the presence and support\nthe prevalence of a circulating melanoma-reactive B cell compartment.\n\nWhile tumor-reactive antibodies were detected from most melanoma patients studied,\nantibody responses derived from circulating B cells against melanoma cells decreased\nwith more advanced disease stages (Figure 3). Previous serological studies report serum-resident antibodies\nagainst tumor cells in melanoma patients, with some evidence that serum antibodies\nare diminished in patients with advanced disease [25], [47]. It was unclear whether this\nwas a consequence of the sequestering of antibodies into tumors with increasing\ntumor burden in these patients. Our findings provide further insight by\ndemonstrating the presence of a circulating long-term mature B cell response to\ncancer at all disease stages, against a broad range of naturally expressed antigens\non the surface of primary and metastatic tumor cells. We also report decreased\nfrequency of tumor-reactive antibody-producing B cells with advanced disease, thus\nsupporting the premise that mechanisms of immune tolerance rather than adsorption of\nantibodies into tumors in advanced disease setting may also explain these\nreductions. One limitation may arise from screening for antibodies against mostly\nmetastatic melanoma cells. It is possible that our observations may reflect\nreactivity to antigens present in primary disease, which may be preserved or\nupregulated in advanced disease setting. While our findings may not account for\nreactivity to tumor antigens that are lost with disease progression, this reduced\nreactivity to melanoma we observed may imply weakened immune responses to a subset\nof antigens on the surface of melanoma cells. Another explanation for these\nobservations may be that with advanced disease, mature circulating B cells home into\nincreasing tumor sites, thus reducing the circulating tumor-reactive B cell\ncompartment in these patients. Future studies aimed at monitoring local B cell\nresponses in tumors may provide further clues into the dynamics of mature B cell\nresponses at the systemic and local levels in cancer. Thus, despite well-known\nweakened host immune response with disease progression [48], we were able to detect\nmelanoma-reactive antibodies from patient circulating B cells, implying that\nalthough mature humoral immune responses are weakened, responses in the form of\nmature memory B cells may persist. However, further work elucidating potential\nimmunomodulatory roles of B cells and other immune cells in cancer, including the\nproduction of IL-10 by B cell population subsets [49], merits consideration.\n\nAlthough we report the presence of anti-tumor antibodies produced by patient memory B\ncells, and these cells were stimulated ex vivo to secrete\nantibodies, it is not clear whether tumor antigen-reactive B cells are activated in\npatients to secrete antibodies or whether these humoral responses are capable of\nexerting any beneficial anti-tumoral activities in the same patients in\nvivo. In the 21 patient cohort at different disease stages in this\nstudy, we were not able to draw any conclusions regarding the relationship between\ntumor cell reactivity and clinical disease progression in the short term (6 months\nto 2 year follow up) or associations with any particular disease treatment regimes.\nHowever, monitoring mature memory B cells and their antibody repertoires together\nwith clinical outcomes in patients over a long period of time may help identify any\ncorrelations between melanoma-reactive mature memory B cell responses and disease\nprogression. Additionally, future studies may help identify particular components of\nthe humoral response which may hold clinical relevance, and elucidate the potential\nmerits of monitoring these responses in relation to therapies, or of evaluating\nhumoral responses as a prognostic factor to clinical outcomes.\n\nAn important question therefore relates to whether patient-derived mature B cell\nresponses have any functional capability to potently activate immune effector cells\nagainst cancer. For this, we measured the capacity of one antibody clone to kill\ntumor cells. Antibody clone 6_2G3 derived from a patient with stage III disease\n(Patient 6, Table 1) was not\nobserved to bind to fibroblasts or melanocytes, but bound to a proportion of\nmelanoma cell lines tested (Figure\n5). Antibodies against tumor-associated antigens can attack tumor cells\nvia a number of mechanisms including induction of apoptosis in tumor cells and\nengaging Fc receptors on immune cells [50], [51], [52], [53]. Antibodies approved\nfor the treatment of cancer have been shown to function through one or more of these\nmechanisms [54],\n[55]. While\nour strategy yields fully human monoclonal antibodies in a matter of a few months,\nwe were limited in the amount of antibody we could produce from the B cells to\nperform functional studies and evaluate reactivity to patient-derived melanoma\ntumors. However, we had sufficient quantity to evaluate whether a patient-derived\nmelanoma tumor-specific monoclonal antibody could mediate antibody dependent\ncellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the presence of monocytic effector cells and tumor\ncells using a real-time live cell imaging assay. We show that the tumor-specific\n6_2G3 clone is capable of mediating ADCC in vitro and additionally\nmeasured the restricted movement of monocytic effector cells once in contact with\ntumor-specific antibody-coated tumor cells, providing further evidence of ADCC\n(Figure 6). These\npreliminary assessments provide a promising clue that a potentially active mature B\ncell response against melanoma may be present in patients. An example of this\npossibility was recently reported by Yuan et al. who demonstrated that\nadministration of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab led to serological enhancement\nof antibodies to the testis antigen NY -ESO-1 in patients who responded to the\nantibody therapy [56]. It is therefore conceivable that the mature B cell\ncompartment could be enhanced with immunotherapeutic approaches, and that monitoring\nhumoral responses to therapeutics may have clinical relevance.\n\nHarnessing the cancer-specific antibody repertoire of cancer patients using the\nmethodology described herein may also potentially offer an alternate strategy to\nyield IgG antibodies against cancer antigens. Recent advances reported by Traggiai\net al., evaluating monoclonal antibodies from human memory B cells have yielded\nfully-human virus-neutralizing antibodies of therapeutic relevance for infectious\ndiseases and have contributed to the dissection of humoral memory responses to\nvaccinations [35], [57], [58]. Here, we focus on B cells from cancer patients such as\nmelanoma patients, analyze systemic humoral responses to cancer and demonstrate the\npresence of tumor-reactive and tumor-specific antibodies. This approach may offer an\nadvantage over other approaches such as phage display in that it yields in\nvivo affinity-matured human antibodies with naturally paired heavy and\nlight chains. The patient-derived monoclonal antibody 6_2G3 bound to 2 out of 6 of\nthe melanoma cell lines evaluated compared to melanocytes, suggesting that this\nantibody may be against a protein over-expressed or mutated on the surface of cancer\ncells. In light of the efficacy of Trastuzumab, against the\nHER2/neu antigen expressed on 20\u201330% of breast\ncancers, as a clinically-validated therapeutic tool for the treatment of an\nequivalent proportion of breast cancer patients [59], selection of antibodies that\nbind to a portion of cell lines may merit further characterization. Although the\nclinical significance of mature memory B cells expressing antibodies that recognize\ntumor cells in patients remains to be elucidated, antibodies derived from these\ncells, introduced by passive immunotherapy in therapeutically-relevant doses, such\nas those used for Trastuzumab to patients with breast cancer, merit investigation\nfor any potential relevance in melanoma. Other potential future benefits of\nscreening patient-derived B cells from tumor-reactive antibodies may be\nidentification of novel cell surface tumor antigens. Future evaluations of clone\n6_2G3 will include sequence analysis and expression cloning to allow for further\nanalyses of specificity to melanoma tumors, antigen identification, and for thorough\nfunctional assessments.\n\nThese data provide additional understanding of the mature B cell response to melanoma\nby evaluating antibodies derived from circulating B cells of cancer patients. The\nprevalence of mature humoral responses against cancer cells in patients, as well as\nthe capacity of a patient-derived antibody to activate effector cells against\nmelanoma cells indicate the potential functional significance of the humoral immune\nresponse against cancer.\n\nSpecimens from patients and healthy volunteers were collected with informed\nwritten consent. The work was conducted in strict accordance with study design\napproved by the Guy\u2019s Research Ethics Committee, St. Thomas\u2019\nHospital, London, UK.\n\nAfter obtaining informed consent, peripheral blood was isolated from healthy\nvolunteers (n = 10) and from patients with melanoma\n(n = 21). Patients were staged and classified according to\nthe American Joint Committee on Cancer Melanoma Staging and Classification\ncriteria [60].\nB cells were isolated by negative selection using RosetteSep\u00ae B cell\nenrichment cocktail (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions. B cell purity was assessed by flow cytometry\nby staining for mature B cells (CD22), T cells (CD3), monocytes (CD14) and\nplasmacytoid dendritic cells (BDCA3) using fluorescently-labeled monoclonal\nantibodies, all from BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK (Figure S1).\nFlow cytometry experiments were conducted with either the FACSAria or FACSCanto\n(BD Biosciences) and flow cytometric data were analyzed using Flow Jo (Tree\nStar, Ashland, OR).\n\nB cells were plated at 500 cells per well on 96 well U-bottom microplates (Nunc,\nRochester, NY) along with 3x104 cells per well of irradiated (30 Gy)\nautologous PBMCs, obtained by Ficoll centrifugation, as feeder cells. B cells\nwere grown in RPMI-1640 medium obtained from Gibco (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)\nsupplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1%\npenicillin-streptomycin, 2.5 ng/mL TLR9 ligand CpG 2006 ODN (Operon, Ebersberg,\nGermany), and 30% supernatant of Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) producing B95-8\ncells [35].\nFor each patient evaluated, 60-120 B cell cultures originating from 500 B cells\neach were established, and cultures were grown in 200 \u00b5L per well volumes.\nAfter 18 days, supernatant (40 \u00b5L) from each culture well was screened\nindividually for tumor-specific antibodies and selected B cultures were\nsub-cloned by limiting dilution to derive monoclonal cultures. We plated B cells\nat 1 cell/well in the presence of 3x104 autologous 30 Gy irradiated\nautologous PBMC stimulated with 2.5 ng/mL CpG 2006 ODN.\n\nHuman dermal fibroblasts were a gift from Dr. Christian Hundhausen, King\u2019s\nCollege London, UK. All other cell lines used were obtained from the American\nType Culture Collection [ATCC] (Manassas, VA). Cell lines were used to\nidentify tumor-reactive antibodies and to test for cytotoxic activity of\nantibodies. Media used for cell lines A-375 (CRL-1619), A-2058 (CRL-11147),\nG-361 (CRL-1424), SK-MEL-2 (HTB-68), SK-MEL-28 (HTB-72), SK-BR-3\n(HTB-30), U-937 (CRL-1593.2) and WM-115 (CRL-1675) were obtained from Gibco and\nsupplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1%\npenicillin-streptomycin. The human metastatic melanoma cell lines A-375 and\nA-2058 were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium. The human\nmelanoma cell line derived from primary melanoma tissue, WM-115, and the\nmetastatic melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-2 and SK-MEL-28 were grown in\nEagle\u2019s Minimum Essential Medium. The human metastatic melanoma cell line\nG-361, and the human mammary carcinoma cell line SK-BR-3, which expresses the\nHuman Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2/neu), were grown\nin McCoy's medium. The Fc receptor-expressing monocytic-like U-937 cell\nline was grown in RMPI-1640 medium. Primary human melanocytes (ATCC,\nPCS-2000-012) were grown in Dermal Cell Basal Medium (ATCC) and supplemented\nwith the Melanocyte Growth Kit (ATCC). Human fibroblasts were grown in Medium\n106 (Invitrogen) and supplemented with Low Serum Growth Supplement\n(Invitrogen).\n\nQualitative detection of tumor-specific antibodies by immunocytochemistry was\nperformed by centrifugation of 2\u00d7105 cells at 300g using a\nShandon Cytospin\u00ae 4 Cytocentrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA)\nonto glass slides. Cells were fixed in 0.5% formalin and antibodies, such\nas those recognizing the human High Molecular Weight Melanoma-Associated Antigen\n(anti-HMW-MAA clone LHM2, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), were incubated overnight at\n4\u00b0C and detected following a 2 hour incubation at 4\u00b0C with a horseradish\nperoxidase-conjugated anti-IgG Fc-specific antibody (1:100 dilution in Tris\nBuffered Saline, Sigma, Dorset, UK). Slides were stained with DAB chromogenic\nsubstrate (DAKO, Ely, UK) for 5 minutes, washed and counterstained with\nMayer\u2019s hematoxlin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for one minute, dehydrated\nand mounted in DPX mountant (Sigma) prior to assessments.\n\nAntibodies bound to cell surface antigens were also detected on live cells by\nflow cytometry. Adherent cells were detached using StemPro\u00ae Accutase\u00ae\ncell disassociation solution (Gibco) and incubated at 2\u00d7105\ncells per sample with antibody, isotype control or cell culture supernatants for\n30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Antibodies bound to cells were detected using a\nFITC-conjugated anti-IgG Fc-specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The\nbinding of tumor-specific antibodies to cells was compared to an excess of\nisotype control IgG1 antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Binding of\nTrastuzumab across melanoma cell lines and primary human melanocytes was\nevaluated by subtracting the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of equal\namounts of isotype control. Evaluations are representative of three\nexperiments.\n\nWe developed and employed a novel cell-based ELISA to identify melanoma-reactive\nantibodies. Adherent cells of interest were plated at 3\u00d7105\ncells per in 200 \u00b5L of appropriate media well on 96-well flat bottom\ntissue culture plates (Corning, Corning, NY) and were grown in a monolayer at\n37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 to 80-100% confluence. Cells were\nthen lightly fixed in 0.5% formaldehyde/Hank\u2019s Buffered Salt\nSolution. Plates were then wrapped in foil and placed in a -80\u00b0C freezer\nuntil the day of the assay. On the day of the assay, plates were thawed for 30\nminutes, washed 3 times with PBS and then blocked with a 5% non-fat\nmilk/PBS solution for 2 hours. After removal of the blocking solution, 50\n\u00b5L of culture supernatants or tumor-specific antibodies were diluted 1:2\nin 1% non-fat milk/PBS solution and then added to each well, and plates\nwere incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature on an orbital shaker. Plates\nwere then washed 4 times with PBS/0.05%Tween (PBS-T). The binding of\nantibodies to cell surface proteins was detected following a 45 minute\nincubation with a goat anti-human horseradish peroxidase-labeled\nF(ab)\u20192 Fc-specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West\nGrove, PA) diluted 1:250 in 1% milk/PBS-T at room temperature on an\norbital shaker. Wells were then washed 4 times with PBS-T. The color reaction\nwas developed for 15 minutes with OPD (Sigma) and OD was measured in an ELISA\nreader (BMG Labtech, Offenbury, Germany) at 492 nm (reference wavelength, 650\nnm). Each plate contained triplicate wells of a positive control antibody,\nTrastuzumab (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), and a negative control\nantibody, non-specific human IgG1 (Jackson Immunoresearch) at a\nconcentration of 250 ng/mL both diluted in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with\n10% fetal calf serum. Binding of Trastuzumab to cells and background OD\nvalues for the negative non-specific human IgG control antibody formed the\ncriteria for inclusion of readouts in the study. Since we were limited by the\nvolume of culture supernatants for each culture, assays were repeated only when\nsufficient culture supernatants were available to confirm reproducibility of\nreadouts.\n\nPatient and healthy volunteer antibody responses were assessed using the\ncell-based ELISA. We evaluated the reactivity of the supernatant from each B\ncell culture to tumor cells relative to negative and positive control\nantibodies. In order to compare anti-tumor antibody responses to metastatic and\nprimary melanoma cells between patients and healthy volunteers, and among\npatient groups, optical densities (OD) were normalized using the following\nformula:Additionally, this calculation was used to normalize ELISA\nresults among multiple melanoma cell lines and primary melanocytes in order to\nevaluate the tumor specificity of antibodies.\n\nTo evaluate the presence and estimate the frequency of tumor-reactive antibodies,\nwe selected wells with OD values above 75% of the OD of the positive\ncontrol antibody. To compare the percentage of positive cultures across\npatients, OD values were normalized against the positive control. For these\nevaluations, the mean positive control OD was assigned a relative absorbance of\n1 for each plate and B cell cultures were converted from OD units to relative\nabsorbance, and culture wells with relative absorbance values greater than 0.75\nto melanoma cells but not melanocytes were selected. These criteria were also\napplied in limiting dilution assays to estimate the percentage of non-reactive B\ncell culture well. In these limiting dilution assays, B cells were plated at\ndifferent densities (ranging from 125 to 2,500 B cells) and the percentage of\nnon-reactive cultures was calculated for different patients and cell lines as a\nway to approximate the frequency of B cells producing melanoma-reactive\nantibodies using Poisson distribution.\n\nThe tumor-killing potential of 2 patient-derived monoclonal antibodies was\nassessed: one tumor-specific antibody (6_2G3), and another antibody that did not\nrecognize tumor cells (6_2D10), both derived from the same patient (Patient 6).\nBoth antibodies were simultaneously evaluated using a three-color fluorescent\nlive cell imaging cytotoxicity assay. A-375 cells were plated overnight at\n2x105 cells per well on 6-well culture plates (Corning). Using a\nLIVE/DEAD\u00ae Viability/Cytotoxicity kit (Molecular Probes,\nEugene, OR) live tumor cells were labeled with 2\u00b5M of Calcein AM 30\nminutes prior to cytotoxicity assays, washed in RPMI 1640 supplemented with\n10% FCS and 1% penicillin streptomycin, and re-suspended in media\ncontaining 4 \u00b5M Ethidium homodimer-1. Ethidium homodimer-1 incorporates\ninto the DNA of dead cells and served as a label for cell death in this assay.\nU-937 monocytic cells expressing Fc\u03b3 receptors were used as immune effector\ncells at a ratio of 3:1 (effectors: tumor cells) [40]. U-937 monocytes were\nincubated with the 6_2G3 or 6_2D10 antibody for 30 minutes, stained with the\nCellTracker\u2122 Blue dye (4-chloromethyl-7-hydroxycoumarin) (Molecular\nProbes), washed and added to the Calcein AM-labelled tumor cell cultures\ncontaining Ethidium homodimer-1. Samples were incubated and images were captured\nevery 5 minutes for two hours in a humidified temperature controlled chamber\nusing a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with a LD-Plan-Neofluar 20x/0.4\nKorr/Ph2 objective and AxioVision software system (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).\nFollowing incubation, fluorescent intensities of Calcein AM-positive live tumor\ncells, as well as incorporation of Ethidium homodimer-1 into cells were measured\nand cell death was assessed with NIS-Elements BR 3 software (Nikon). The\nmovement of effector cells in the cultures was tracked and analyzed using IMARIS\nsoftware (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland).\n\nDescriptive statistics were generated to examine the distribution of\nmelanoma-reactive B cell cultures from each patient including the mean,\n95% confidence interval and maximum reactivity to melanoma cells. A\ntwo-sided Student\u2019s t test was used to compare the mean\nreactivity of antibody cultures derived from melanoma patients to healthy\nvolunteers to primary or metastatic melanoma cell lines and to compare antibody\nresponses between patients with non-metastatic and metastatic disease. A one-way\nANOVA was used to compare antibody reactivity to a metastatic melanoma cell line\namong B cell cultures derived from patients with stage II, III and IV disease\nwith a Tukey\u2019s post hoc comparison test. A two-sided Student\u2019s\nt test was used to compare antibody-mediated tumor cell\nkilling between tumor-specific and non-specific monoclonal antibodies derived\nfrom the same patient. A two-sided Student\u2019s t test was\nalso employed to compare the movement of immune effector cells, pre-incubated\nwith antibodies, in contact with tumor cells to the movement of immune cells not\nin contact with tumor cells. All statistical analyses were performed using\nGraphPad Prism software (version 5.03, GraphPad, San Diego, CA) and error bars\nin all figures represent 95% confidence intervals."}
