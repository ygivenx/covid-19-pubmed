Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1994;150:S123-S130. 16 Fifty years ago, Dr Ward summarized research underway on poliomyelitis. Polio was a very important public health problem at the time: in 1952, there were 57,879 cases in the United States alone, with 21,269 cases of paralysis and 3000 deaths. 1 The virus had been first isolated in 1909, but the propogation of the virus in tissue culture by Enders, Weller, and Robbins in the late 1940s was the critical breakthrough for further progress. Dr Ward reported that the development of the inactivated vaccine of Salk, and of the live, attenuated vaccine of Sabin were underway. Of course, these efforts were ultimately successful, and universal vaccination was implemented by the mid-1950s, leading to the eradication of wild-type polio in the United States by 1979.\n\nToday, a new feared pathogen has emerged and the comparisons are intriguing. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has emerged from the Far East, so far occurring in 3000 patients and causing 150 deaths. 2 The reaction worldwide has been immediate and profound. Fear has already had huge social and economic impact throughout eastern Asia, the final extent of which is not yet known. Meanwhile, the medical research community has turned on a dime toward new goals. Within months of the report of the first cases of this apparently new disease, the causative agent has been identified, its entire genome sequenced, and work is well underway to develop diagnostic tests. Both therapeutic trials of existing agents and the steps to develop a vaccine are under discussion.\n\nThe comparisons of the public health impact of the two diseases, the response of the public, and the expectations of the medical research community are striking. What accounts for the differences? Surely, the pace of research has accelerated with the technologic capabilities of today's biologists. It remains to be seen whether the capabilities of the research teams will keep pace with the public's expectations.\n\nThomas P.
