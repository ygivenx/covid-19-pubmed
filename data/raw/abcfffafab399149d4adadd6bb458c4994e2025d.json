{"title": "Time-varying transmission dynamics of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in China At a Glance Commentary Scientific Knowledge on the Subject: Since", "body": "Eighteen years ago, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out globally, which caused more than 8000 cases with a fatality rate of 9.6% (1). Since December 2019, a pneumonia infection with 2019-nCoV, which was now named as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP), broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread throughout China and to many other countries (2) (3) (4) . As of February 9, 2020, 2019-nCoV had transmitted to 34 provinces, regions and municipal cities across China. A total of 40,235 confirmed NCP cases with 908 deaths (2.3%) and 6,484 (16.1%) critically ill cases, and there were still 23,589 suspected cases (5) .\n\nAs an emerging infectious disease, we need to quickly understand its etiological, epidemiological and clinical characteristics to take prevention and control measures. Several studies have described the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCP, and have demonstrated that it can transmitted between humans (4, 6) . A few studies have also estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) of NCP (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . For instance, Li et al. computed the R0 of 2.2 using daily NCP data before January 4 in Wuhan. Our study using early epidemic stage data also found reproductive number of NCP was 2.9 (11) . However, most of these studies employed daily reporting cases at very early epidemic stage or were purely based on mathematical modeling. It has been suggested that epidemic size may be seriously under-reported due to the unknown etiology and lack of diagnosis protocol at early epidemic stage (12) , which may lead to underestimation of R0. In addition, for control measures to be optimized during ongoing NCP epidemics, temporal changes in reproduction number must be tracked. However, none of previous studies have estimated time-varying instantaneous reproduction number (Rt), which is author/funder. All rights reserved.

Moreover, excerpt for Hubei Province, most of confirmed cases reporting from other provinces were imported from Hubei Province at early epidemic stage. With increasing secondary cases in those provinces, however, it is unknown how much the Rt for secondary cases is in those Provinces. Knowing this information is very helpful to assess the epidemic trend and the effects of control measures in those provinces.\n\nAs a milestone of global public health events, the transmission dynamics of SARS have been well studied (14, 15) . Comparing the transmissibility of NCP with SRAS could imply decision making on the prevention and control of NCP. Therefore, in this study, we described the epidemiological characteristics of NCP using the latest data across China, and estimated the basic and time-varying reproduction numbers which were compared with SARS. Our findings are critical to optimize prevention and control measures during the ongoing epidemic of NCP, as well as guide clinical management. author/funder. All rights reserved.

(17) and WHO website (18) , respectively.\n\nBecause only the daily number of reporting cases were obtained from regions out of Guangdong Province, we estimated the daily number of incidences using a generalized additive model (GAM) (Section 1.2 in Supplementary materials). First, we collected each individual onset date and reporting date in Guangdong province which was treated as a sample of all confirmed cases nationwide. Second, a GAM model was used to establish the relationship between onset date and reporting date, and obtained the lagged probability distribution of daily number of incidences for the number of reporting cases. Third, we used the lagged probability distribution author/funder. All rights reserved.

In order to test the validity of this approach, we randomly divided all cases in Guangdong into two groups (group A and B). Cases in group A was used to establish a GAM model, which was then used to predict the number of incidences in group B. We then estimated the correlation between the actual incidence and the estimated incidence, and the results of cross-validation showed that the R 2 was 89.7%, and the root mean square error (RMSE) was 4.11 ( Figure S1 ).\n\nThe number of occurred-but-not-yet-reported cases were further estimated during the study period, which caused by reporting delays. Reasons for such delays include the time to complete diagnosis test, logistics, and overwhelmed surveillance systems. To minimize the effects of reporting delay, we applied a Bayesian nowcasting model (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) to complement the daily total number of incidences (19) . This model is characterized by its ability to deal with the uncertainty in the delay distribution and the time evolution of epidemic curve.\n\nIn the early phase of an infectious disease outbreak, the initial reproductive rate approximated an exponential growth rate (20) . We selected a period of exponential growth in the epidemic curve to calculated R0, which was defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical primary case. Since the daily incidence data is an integer, Poisson regression was used to fit the exponential growth rate. We used a prior Gamma distribution for the generation time, with a shape parameter (mean generation time of 7.5 days) and a scale parameter (standard author/funder. All rights reserved.

We estimated R0 of all confirmed NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan, and R0 of SARS cases in Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and Beijing. We also estimated R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong Province.\n\nIn contrast to R0, time-varying instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) represents the average number of secondary cases that would be produced by a typical primary case infected at time t if conditions remained constant after time t (13) . We estimated Rt from the time series of onset cases, with the same Gamma distribution of generation time as R0. In order to maintain the accuracy of the prediction and without hiding the underlying time trend, Rt values were estimated over a 10-day moving window. For the period of estimation, the end date was selected as the latest date of the available data, and the starting date was selected as the earliest date for which the 10-day instantaneous reproduction number estimated above could be assumed constant. We estimated Rt for all confirmed NCP cases nationwide, and in Wuhan, and for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong Province.\n\nWe applied frequency and percentages (%) to describe categorical variables, and used mean\u00b1SD to describe the continuous variables. The doubling time of NCP and SARS were defined and estimated using a method proposed by Galvani et al (21) .\n\nA series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to quantify the effect of parameters changes on R0 value. We changed the shape parameter of Gamma distribution from 7.0 to 8.0 days for estimating the R0 of NCP cases, and changed the same parameter from 8.0 to 9.0 for estimating author/funder.

The peak of daily reporting cases was on January 31, 2020 in Guangdong Province, and then significantly decreased. The daily incidence after nowcasting showed similar trend with the reporting data. The doubling time of NCP was 2.4, 2.8, and 3.6 days nationwide, in Wuhan, and in Guangdong Province, respectively (Table 1) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.25.919787 doi: bioRxiv preprint prior to the peak, respectively ( Table 1) .\n\nThe Table 1 ).\n\nDuring the epidemic, at national level, Rt values increased from 6.9 (95%CI: 5.5-8.4) before January 9 to a peak of 8.8 (95%CI: 8.3-9.4) before January 16, and then continuously decreased to 1.59 (95%CI: 1.57-1.61) before February 6. The Rt values in Wuhan continuously decreased from 6.2 (95%CI: 4.9-7.6) by January 9 to 2.10 (95%CI: 2.07-2.14) before February 6. By contrast, Rt values for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong Province was kept at a low-level ranging from 0.8 (95%CI: 0.6-1.1) to 0.2 (95%CI: 0.2-0.3) during the epidemic (Figure 3 ).\n\nThe results of sensitivity analyses showed the R0 values of NCP and SARS were robust to the changes of GT ( Figure S3 ). For example, the R0 of NCP cases nationwide changed from 4.0 (95%CI: 3.9-4.1) using GT=7.0 to 4.9 (95%CI:4.8-5.1) using GT=8.0. author/funder. All rights reserved.

However the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the epidemic remain unclear(22). In this study, we estimated the R0 of NCP infected with 2019-nCoV nationwide, and found that the R0 was 4.5, which means an average of 4.5 secondary cases generated by a primary case in the early stage. An approaching R0 of 4.4 was found in Wuhan.\n\nOur estimated R0 was larger than that (R0=2.2) reported by Li et al. who employed the data in Wuhan between December 10, 2019 and January 4, 2020, the very early stage of this epidemic (7) . It was debated that the number of NCP cases might be seriously underreported in the early stage (10, 23) , since 2019-nCoV was confirmed on January 7, and the official diagnosis protocol was released by WHO until January 17 (12) . In addition, the surveillance was not widely conducted, and many infections may be missed. Read et al. estimated that only 5.1% of infections in Wuhan were identified in the early period (23). Zhao et al. estimated that the R0 of NCP was larger than 5.0 using national reported data from January 10 to January 24, 2020, under the scenario that the reporting rate was not changed during that period (12) .\n\nAlthough the fatality rate of NCP cases was much lower than SARS(1), we observed higher R0 and much shorter doubling time of NCP than SARS (14, 24, 25) , indicating the higher transmissibility of 2019-nCoV. These differences can be due to two reasons. First, epidemiological and clinical evidences suggest that asymptomatic or mild NCP cases during their incubation periods could effectively transmit 2019-nCoV, which was different from SARS because most SARS cases were infected by \"super spreaders\", and SARS cases in incubation period and mild cases could not infected susceptible (26) .

This can be verified by decreasing period from onset to diagnosis during the epidemic in Guangdong Province ( Figure S5 ).\n\nWe also observed that the R0 was less than 1, and the Rt values continuously declined after January 23 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong Province, which demonstrates that the implemented prevention and control measures have significantly reduced the risk of indigenous outbreak of NCP, and that the increasing NCP cases were dominated by imported cases.\n\nMeanwhile, we found that two secondary cases were infected through sharing the public elevator with cases from their neighbors, which indicates the higher risk of transmission of NCP in community. Similar cases were also reported in other regions. For example, Wang et al.\n\nreported that 57 (including 40 healthcare workers and 17 patients) out of 138 hospitalized patients were presumed to have been infected with 2019-nCoV in a Wuhan hospital (29) .\n\nTherefore, more efforts are needed to prevent the transmission in communities and other public places.\n\nThis study has several strengths. First, this is the first study, to date, to assess the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP based on incidence data nationwide. We also estimated instantaneous reproduction number for secondary cases in Guangdong Province. Secondly, we compared the transmission dynamics of NCP with SARS using the same methods. Third, we initially assessed the effects of control measures previously taken by the governments. These findings could provide important information for optimizing control measures.\n\nOur study has several limitations. First, the incidence date of confirmed cases in provinces except for Guangdong Province were estimated by a GAM modeling, which may lead to misclassification bias. However, the cross-validation test indicated a good performance of our author/funder. All rights reserved.

In addition, the R0 (3.8, 95%CI: 3.4-4.2) estimated for imported cases in Guangdong Province, as a sample of the total confirmed cases nationwide, was comparable with the R0 estimated nationwide, indicating that our results are robust. Second, we are still in the early stage of this outbreak, and there is much uncertainty in epidemiological parameters that affects transmissibility of NCP. Sequential studies are urgently needed to fill-in these knowledge gaps.\n\nIn summary, NCP may have a higher pandemic risk than SARS in 2003, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are taking into effect. Our findings indicate that rigorous control and prevention measures taken by Chinese governments on early detection, diagnosis and treatment of NCP cases are still needed to uphold until the time-varying reproduction number below one. author/funder.
