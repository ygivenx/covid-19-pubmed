{"title": "Clinical review: A systematic review of corticosteroid use in infections", "body": "Traditional teaching suggests that corticosteroids impair the ability of the body to fight infection and that this may prove catastrophic if an appropriate antibiotic is not chosen. In recent years, however, the early use of steroid therapy has become progressively established in a wide range of infective conditions [1,2], including septic shock, its most severe systemic manifestation. We thus decided to conduct a systematic review of the literature to identify the current strength of evidence for the use of corticosteroids in specified infections, and to make appropriate graded recommendations.\n\nThe Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 1, 2005) were searched using medical subject headings (MeSH) for steroids, glucocorticoids, adrenal cortex hormones AND (virus diseases OR bacterial infections OR mycoses). In addition, phase 1 of the Cochrane highly sensitive strategy for randomised controlled trials [3] AND a steroid search (Table 1) AND search terms for specific clinical entities were utilised in both MEDLINE and EMBASE.\n\nSystematic reviews published since 1999 formed the mainstay of analysis. Trials published more recently, or not considered by the reviews, were also included. For infections with no prior review, original articles are summarised. The abstracts thus obtained were scanned for relevance, and the original papers retrieved. Specific clinical entities are reviewed in order of the strength of evidence, proceeding through meta-analyses of multiple well-controlled trials to single small studies and case reports.\n\nTable 2 shows the systems used to grade the level of evidence and consequent level of recommendation for the use of corticosteroids for each specified infection.\n\nLow dose (200 to 300 mg) hydrocortisone equivalent/day for 7 days should be given to patients with a subnormal cortisol response (<9 \u03bcg/l (248 nmol/l)) following 250 \u03bcg tetracosactrin.\n\nGrade of evidence I; grade of recommendation B.\n\nHydrocortisone can be started pending the laboratory results and discontinued if the rise in cortisol level following 250 \u03bcg tetracosactrin exceeds 9 \u03bcg/l.\n\nGrade of evidence I; grade of recommendation B.\n\nAfter the seven day course, the dose of corticosteroid should be tailed off over a further five to seven days.\n\nGrade of evidence IV; grade of recommendation E.\n\nDexamethasone 10 mg qds or equivalent should be given for 48 hours, preferably commencing prior to antibiotic therapy.\n\nGrade of evidence I; grade of recommendation A.\n\nPrednisolone 40 mg twice daily for 5 days, then 40 mg daily for 5 days, then 20 mg daily for 10 days should be given to adult patients with PaO2 <9.3 kPa or alveolar-arterial gradient >4.7 kPa.\n\nGrade of evidence I; grade of recommendation A.\n\nHydrocortisone (200 mg bolus followed by 10 mg/h infusion for 7 days) may be considered in severe community-acquired pneumonia.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nSteroids cannot be recommended for treatment of SARS-related pneumonia.\n\nGrade of evidence V; grade of recommendation E.\n\nSteroids should not be used in children with bronchiolitis who are ventilated.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nSteroids should be given to children with mild bronchiolitis or viral wheeze who present as outpatients. The best regimen is as yet undetermined.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nSteroids should be administered to children with croup. The optimal dose and route are yet to be defined.\n\nGrade of evidence I; grade of recommendation A.\n\nDexamethasone tapering over four weeks, from 0.4 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg depending upon severity, should be administered for tuberculous meningitis.\n\nGrade of evidence I; grade of recommendation A.\n\nPrednisolone tapering from 60 mg daily (adult dose) over 11 weeks should be given in tuberculous pericarditis.\n\nGrade of evidence I; grade of recommendation A.\n\nSteroids should not be given for tuberculous pleurisy in HIV positive patients.\n\nGrade of evidence I; grade of recommendation B.\n\nSteroids cannot yet be recommended for tuberculous pleurisy in non-HIV positive patients.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nSteroids may be considered for patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly those with extensive disease, but not in HIV-positive patients.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nShort course oral steroid should be given for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This may be in the form of 30 mg prednisolone daily for 14 days.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nInhaled steroids should not be administered routinely in cystic fibrosis patients.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nSteroids should not be used for pre-treatment of chronic hepatitis B.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nSteroids should not be used for treatment of chronic hepatitis C.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nSteroids should not be used for treatment of acute viral hepatitis.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation B.\n\nSteroids should not be used to treat Bell's palsy.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nSteroids should not be used to treat cerebral malaria.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nSteroids should not be used to treat nephrotic syndrome secondary to malaria.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nSteroids should be used in severe typhoid.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nDexamethasone 0.2 mg/kg for 4 days should be given for haematogenous septic arthritis.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nSteroids should not be used for Dengue shock syndrome.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nSteroids may be of benefit in infectious mononucleosis if there is respiratory compromise or severe pharyngeal oedema.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nSteroids should not be administered for whooping cough in infants.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nPrednisolone 40 mg daily for 12 to 20 weeks should be used to treat reversal reaction causing new nerve function impairment in leprosy.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nSteroids should not be used as prophylaxis for leprosy reversal reaction.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nSteroids should not be used to treat established impaired nerve function in leprosy.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nPrednisolone 60 mg daily for 3 days should be used in treating the Mazzotti reaction.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nPrednisolone 1 mg/kg for 10 days should be used to treat solitary granuloma stage neurocysticercosis.\n\nGrade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C.\n\nWe present a synthesis of the diverse evidence related to steroid use in infections. A more detailed consideration of the applicability of steroids can be found in some condition-specific reviews, many of which are cited above. The conditions we have covered range widely in severity, duration, site, and type of causative organism. Furthermore, the dosing and duration of steroid therapy varies enormously between conditions and, as clearly illustrated by steroid use in sepsis, benefit or harm may accrue depending on the regimen used. In many of the conditions listed, only limited data are available. There is an obvious need to have more adequately powered trials to provide definitive evidence of benefit or harm, and a better understanding of how steroids modulate disease processes.\n\nCI = confidence interval; EBV = Epstein-Barr virus; FEV1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 second; NNT = number needed to treat; PaO2 = arterial partial pressure of oxygen; RR = relative risk; SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome.\n\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."}
