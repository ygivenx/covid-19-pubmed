{"title": "LY6E impairs coronavirus fusion and confers immune control of viral disease", "body": "4 hepatoma cells was largely specific to CoV. Among 10 genetically divergent viruses tested, only hepatitis C virus was also restricted (Extended Data Fig. 1f ).\n\nLY6E is a member of the LY6/uPAR family of GPI-anchored proteins, and is implicated in diverse cellular processes 14 . To evaluate the specificity of LY6E for inhibiting CoV, we ectopically expressed select LY6/uPAR proteins 9 and infected with HCoV-229E. Only LY6E inhibited CoV infection (Extended Data Fig. 1g) . We previously showed that a conserved residue (L36) is required for LY6Emediated enhancement of influenza A virus 9 . L36 was also required to restrict HCoV-229E infection (Extended Data Fig. 1h) . These data suggest a conserved functional domain that is responsible for both the virus-enhancing and -restricting phenotypes.\n\nNext, we investigated the effect of LY6E on specific steps of the virus replication cycle. First, we tested whether LY6E restricts HCoV-229E attachment to the cell surface and observed no effect (Extended Data Fig. 2a) . In accordance, LY6E had no effect on surface expression of CD13, the specific receptor for HCoV-229E (Extended Data Fig. 2b) . To test whether LY6E restricts viral entry, we used a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudoparticle (pp) system bearing CoV spike (S) proteins.\n\nStrikingly, LY6E significantly inhibited VSVpp entry mediated by S proteins from HCoV-229E (Fig.   2a) , MERS-CoV (Fig. 2b) , SARS-CoV (Fig. 2c) , and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2d) . Entry mediated by VSV glycoprotein G was only marginally impacted by LY6E (Extended Data Fig. 2c, d) . To test whether LY6E interferes with the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, we performed a syncytia formation assay using propagation competent VSV pseudoviruses co-expressing CoV S protein and a GFP reporter (VSV*\u0394G(CoV S)) (Extended Data Fig. 3a) . LY6E potently inhibited CoV S protein-mediated syncytia formation (Fig. 2e-f ). To determine whether LY6E impairs S protein expression or maturation, we also performed a heterologous syncytia formation assay. CoV-resistant hamster cells infected with trans-complemented GFP reporter VSV*\u0394G(CoV) were co-cultured with susceptible target cells that ectopically expressed LY6E. LY6E again significantly blocked syncytia formation, demonstrating that LY6E inhibits S protein-mediated fusion and not S protein expression or maturation (Extended Data Fig. 3b-c) . As membrane fusion can occur without syncytia formation, we also performed a quantitative fusion assay in which mixing of cell contents results in complementation of split luciferase (Fig. 2g) .\n\nauthor/funder.

LY6E reduced CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion, indicating that LY6E blocks fusion of viral and cellular membranes ( Fig. 2h) . Time-course experiments revealed that LY6E had no effect on HCoV-229E translation, replication, assembly, or release (Extended Data Fig. 2e-i) . Collectively, our results demonstrate that LY6E specifically inhibits CoV S protein-mediated membrane fusion, which is required for viral entry.\n\nWe next addressed whether LY6E modulates proteolytic activation of the S protein. Upon S proteinmediated binding to the respective receptor, host proteases cleave the S protein and make it fusion competent for \"early entry\" at the cell surface or \"late entry\" in endosomes 15, 16 . Pharmacological inhibition of cell surface and endosomal proteases had no effect on LY6E-mediated restriction of CoV infection (Extended Data Fig. 4a-c) . Next, we addressed whether LY6E directly interferes with the proteolytic activation of S protein. Mutation of S1/S2 and S2\u2032 in the S protein prevents activation (Extended Data Fig. 4d ) 16, 17 . Ectopic LY6E expression had no effect on MERS-CoV S cleavage or infection by cleavage-resistant MERS-CoV pp (Extended Data Fig. 4e-g) . Collectively, our data indicate that restriction of viral fusion is independent of S protein activation.\n\nNext, we aimed to evaluate LY6E-mediated CoV restriction in vivo. Systemic genetic ablation of Ly6e in mice is embryonic lethal 18 . Therefore, we generated transgenic Ly6e fl/fl mice, which are functionally 'wild-type (WT)' for Ly6e expression, and crossed them with Vav1-iCre mice to ablate Ly6e in cells that originate from a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) progenitor (Extended Data Fig. 5a-b ). This genetic model was chosen since immune cells are critical for protection from CoV in vivo 5,19-23 . Bonemarrow derived macrophages (BMDM) from Ly6e \u0394HSC mice had reduced Ly6e mRNA levels (Extended Data Fig. 5c ). The natural mouse pathogen MHV is a well-studied model CoV that causes hepatitis and encephalomyelitis in mice 24 . Ly6e \u0394HSC BMDM were more susceptible to MHV infection than Ly6e fl/fl BMDM, demonstrating that murine Ly6e is a restriction factor for murine CoV (Extended Data Fig.   5d ).\n\nTo determine whether Ly6e is important for controlling CoV infection in vivo, Ly6e fl/fl and Ly6e \u0394HSC mice were infected with a high dose (5 x 10 4 PFU) of MHV that causes sub-lethal hepatitis in WT author/funder.

Since MHV pathogenesis is influenced by sex 26 , we performed independent experiments in male and female mice. Ly6e \u0394HSC mice of both sexes rapidly succumbed to MHV infection by day 6 ( Fig. 3a-b, Extended Data Fig. 6a-b) . To examine viral pathogenesis and immunopathology in infected mice, Ly6e fl/fl and Ly6e \u0394HSC mice were infected with the same high dose of MHV and euthanized 3-or 5-days post-infection. At both time points, female Ly6e \u0394HSC mice exhibited significantly higher levels of liver damage as measured by serum ALT while no difference was observed in male mice (Fig. 3c,i, Extended Data Fig. 6c,i) . However, hepatic viral burden did not differ in either sex ( Fig. 3d,j, Extended Data Fig. 6d,j) , possibly due to tissue saturation at this high dose. Indeed, female but not male Ly6e \u0394HSC mice exhibited increased liver damage and viral burden at a low dose (5 PFU) of MHV (Extended Data Fig. 7a -b, f-g). Spleen viral burden was elevated in female and male Ly6e \u0394HSC mice at both time points and doses of MHV (Fig. 3e,k, Extended Data Fig. 6e ,k, Extended Data Fig.   7c ,h). At 3 days post-infection, there was no difference in liver necrosis, but inflammation was moderately reduced in female but not male Ly6e \u0394HSC mice ( Fig. 3f-h, Extended Data Fig. 6f-h) . By 5 days post-infection and at both low and high doses of MHV, female Ly6e \u0394HSC mice had significantly higher levels of liver necrosis and a reduced presence of mononuclear immune cells ( Fig. 3l- Fig. 7k-n) . These data demonstrate that Ly6e in hematopoietic cells is important for controlling murine CoV infection.\n\nWe next used a transcriptomic approach to evaluate the effect of Ly6e ablation on global gene expression in liver and spleen of female Ly6e fl/fl and Ly6e \u0394HSC mice injected with PBS or the high dose of MHV at 3-and 5-days post-infection. In infected tissues, loss of Ly6e in hematopoietic cells correlated with differential gene expression in pathways associated with tissue damage, such as liverspecific metabolic genes, angiogenesis, wound healing, and immune response to viruses (Fig. 4a-c) . We also observed a striking loss of genes associated with the type I IFN response, inflammation, antigen presentation, and B cells in infected Ly6e \u0394HSC mice ( Fig. 4d-e, Extended Data Fig. 8) . 7 The histopathology (Fig. 3h,n) and transcriptome data (Fig 4a-e, Extended Data Fig. 8 Fig. 7k-n, Extended Data Fig. 9 ). Multiple cell types were depleted in livers and spleens of infected Ly6e \u0394HSC mice, irrespective of sex (Figure 4f g, Extended Data Fig. 10a-b) . B cells were dramatically reduced in livers from infected Ly6e \u0394HSC mice.\n\nHepatic CD4 + T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells (DC), macrophages, and neutrophils were also depleted in infected Ly6e \u0394HSC mice, whereas CD8 + T cells were unchanged (Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 10a ).\n\nInfected Ly6e \u0394HSC mice had a reduction in all splenic immune cell subsets except for CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (Fig. 4g, Extended Data Fig. 10b) . Depletion of immune cell populations in Ly6e \u0394HSC organs was MHV-dependent, as cell numbers were not altered in PBS-injected mice.\n\nTo determine whether loss of immune cells in MHV-infected Ly6e \u0394HSC mice correlates with increased permissiveness to infection, we assessed MHV infection in splenocytes cultured from Ly6e \u0394HSC , Ly6e fl/fl , and Ifnar -/mice. In Ly6e fl/fl splenocyte cultures, MHV infected macrophages, neutrophils, DC, and B cells, but not CD4 + or CD8 + T cells, as previously published (Fig. 4h, Extended Data Fig. 10c Together, our data demonstrate an important role for Ly6e in immune cell-mediated control of CoV infection. Higher viral burden and lower liver inflammation suggests that liver damage in MHV-infected female Ly6e \u0394HSC mice may be due to viral pathogenesis that exceeds the ability of the immune system to control the infection. Notably, we observed MHV-induced loss of three classes of cells: 1) cells that are not permissive to the virus (CD4 + T cells), 2) cells that are permissive to MHV but do not demonstrate Ly6e KO-dependent infection (NK cells, macrophages, and neutrophils), and 3) cells that are permissive to MHV in a Ly6e KO-dependent manner (B cells and DC). This latter group is capable of antigen-presentation to CD4 + T cells 27,28 . Thus, in the absence of Ly6e, unrestricted MHV infection author/funder. All rights reserved.

Our findings are striking given that LY6E has been primarily associated with an enhancing phenotype in which LY6E promotes entry of multiple viruses 29 . However, our data clearly expand the role of LY6E during coronaviral infection and establishes a novel function in protecting the host immune cell compartment. Determining the precise molecular mechanism underlying how LY6E inhibits CoV S protein-mediated membrane fusion will advance our understanding of cellular antiviral defenses against these important human pathogens. Antiviral membrane fusion inhibitors have been successfully implemented for treatment of HIV-1 infection 30 . A therapeutic approach mimicking the mechanism of action of LY6E could provide a first line of defense against novel emerging CoV infections. Furthermore, delineating which Ly6e-expressing immune cells protect mice from MHV will provide new insight into how individual antiviral effectors in distinct cellular compartments modulate viral pathogenesis. author/funder.

Cells were incubated at 33\u00b0C for 24 hours, then washed with PBS and lysed using the Renilla Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega). Rluc activity was measured using a plate luminometer (EnSpire 2300 Multilabel reader by Perkin Elmer). For the reconstitution with CRISPR resistant LY6E (CR LY6E), 2.5 x 10 4 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate. One day post-seeding, cells were either left untransduced or transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding for CR LY6E or the empty control. 48 hours post-transduction, cell lysates were either infected with HCoV-229E-Rluc (MOI=0.1) for 24 hours as described above or harvested for Western blot.\n\nPseudotyping of VSV*\u0394G(Fluc) was performed as previously described 50 with two silent mutation (T2568G, T3327C)), have been described previously [51] [52] [53] .

The MERS-CoV S cleavage mutants have been described before 17 \n\nThe split luciferase fusion assay has been described before, with slight modifications 54 . Briefly, 6 x 10 5 293LTV cells were transfected with plasmids encoding CoV S proteins (pCAGGS-HCoV-229E, pCAGGS-MERS-CoV) together with a split-luciferase construct (Rluc8155-156 DSP1-7).

Approximately 30 hours post-transfection, both cell populations were dissociated (TryPLE Express, Gibco), counted, and equal cell numbers (2x10 4 cells each) were co-cultured for 16 -20 hours at 37\u00b0C.

Cells were kept on ice during all times post-cell lysis to eliminate DSP post-lysis complementation.\n\nFollowing extraction of total RNA from MERS-CoV (strain EMC) infected VeroE6 cells, the cDNA encoding the MERS-CoV S protein was generated by reverse transcription (RevertAid Premium Reverse Transkriptase, ThermoScientific). Three overlapping cDNA fragments were amplified by PCR (Phusion Hot Start II High Fidelity Polymerase, Thermo Scientific) and subsequently assembled by overlapping PCR. The cDNAs encoding the S proteins of either MERS-CoV (strain EMC) or HCoV-229E (truncated variant lacking the 10 amino acids at the C terminus, original plasmid pCAGGS-229E S) were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pVSV* plasmid 55 between MluI and BstEII restriction sites. The resulting plasmids were used to generate the recombinant viruses VSV*\u0394G(MERS S) and VSV*\u0394G(229E S) according to a published procedure 56 . All viruses were propagated on BHK-G43 cells 57 , resulting in viruses predominantly containing the homotypic VSV glycoprotein G in the envelope.\n\nCells expressing LY6E or empty control were infected with VSV*\u0394G(MERS S) or VSV*\u0394G(229E S) at a MOI of 0.01. At 20 hours post-infection, the cells were fixed with 3% PFA/PBS and the nuclei stained with 4',6-diamidine-2'-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma).

In order to generate TMPRSS2-encoding retroviral vectors, the open reading frame of human TMPRRS2 was first PCR amplified with primers adding an N-terminal cMYC epitope to the TMPRSS2 coding sequence. The resulting sequence was inserted into a modified version of the pQCXIP plasmid that contains a blasticidin resistance cassette instead of the usual puromycin resistance cassette 17 . Huh7 cells stably expressing human TMPRSS2 were generated by retroviral transduction and selection with the antibiotic blasticidin (50 \u00b5g/ml).\n\nFollowing selection, cells were maintained in culture medium (cDMEM) supplemented with 10 \u00b5g/ml blasticidin. To generate STAT1 -/-_CEACAM1 cells, human STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts were transduced with lentiviruses encoding for the murine CoV receptor CEACAM1 (kind gift from David Wentworth, CDC, Atlanta, USA 59 and subsequently selected with 1 \u00b5g/mL puromycin. Stable LY6E expressing cell lines were generated upon lentiviral transduction with SCRPSY LY6E or as control SCRPSY Empty in DMEM containing 4 \u00b5g/ml polybrene (Millipore) and 20 mM HEPES buffer solution (Gibco).

The puromycin selected cells were further passaged and frozen down for subsequent experiments. The stable cell lines harboring LY6E orthologues have been described before, with the exception of C. dromedarius 9 . For this, a gBlock was ordered (XM_031439745.1) and Gateway cloning performed as described previously to generate pENTR and pSCRPSY plasmids 9 . Constructs encoding for Ly6/uPAR family members and LY6E ASM mutants have been described before 9 .\n\nTo generate clonal LY6E KO cells and CRISPR-resistant LY6E, A549 cells were transduced with lentivirus containing a LY6E-specific sgRNA and Cas9 as described previously 9 . To generate a clonal cell line, the bulk transduced population was plated at single cell dilutions. Candidate clones were screened by Western blot for LY6E expression and Sanger sequencing. Silent mutations in the region targeted by the LY6E-specific sgRNA were introduced into HA-tagged LY6E to generate CRISPRresistant LY6E (CR LY6E). LY6E KO A549 cells were reconstituted with CR-LY6E by lentiviral transduction and expression confirmed by Western blot.\n\nAll cell lines were regularly tested to check they were free of mycoplasma contamination using a commercially available system (PCR Mycoplasma test kit I/RT Variant C, PromKine).\n\nThe ISG screen was performed as described previously with slight modifications 7,8 . Briefly, 5 x 10 3 Huh7 cells were seeded, transduced with individual lentiviruses, and 48 hours post-transduction infected with HCoV-229E at 33\u00b0C. Infection was stopped 24 hours (MOI=0.1) or 48 hours (MOI=0.01) postinfection and plates were immuno-stained as described previously 61 with an anti-HCoV-229E N protein antibody and a AlexaFluor488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Extended methods;\n\nAntibodies for immunofluorescence and flow cytometry).

To determine extracellular viral replication, viral supernatant was harvested, and viral RNA extracted (NucleoMag-Vet kit, Macherey Nagel), followed by RT-qPCR as described before. To determine intracellular infectivity, cells were subjected to 3 rounds of freeze/thaw cycles, centrifuged to remove debris (4,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min), and the supernatant titrated on na\u00efve Huh7 cells. To determine extracellular infectivity, supernatant was harvested at the indicated time points and titrated on na\u00efve \n\nTo test various protease inhibitors, 2 x 10 4 na\u00efve or TMPRSS2-expressing, control or LY6E cells were seeded in a 96-well plate. One day post seeding, cells were pre-treated with the following compounds for 1 hour in OptiMEM, at 37\u00b0C: DMSO (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich), E64 D (10 \u00b5M, Sigma-Aldrich), and/or Camostat (100 \u00b5M, Sigma-Aldrich).
