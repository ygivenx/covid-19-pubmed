{"title": "Correlation of immunogenicities and in vitro expression levels of recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara HIV vaccines", "body": "A plethora of recombinant AIDS vaccines are in early stages of evaluation. Many of these vaccines consist of live, attenuated viruses that express HIV genes and induce humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. However, little is known regarding the most basic aspects of recombinant vaccine vector development. The purpose of the present study was to determine the relationship between in vitro levels of protein expression and immunogenicities in an animal model. A highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus (VACV), called modified VACV Ankara (MVA), is replication-deficient in most mammalian cells [1, 2] and in mouse and monkey hosts [3, 4] . MVA is an attractive vector because of its safety in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice and non-human primates [4, 5] , in addition to its ability to highly express foreign gene inserts [6] and generate vigorous humoral and T cell responses to a variety of pathogens with or without heterologous priming [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Here we show a strong positive correlation between the amount of HIV Env synthesized by an MVA vector and the induction of both antibody and T-cell responses in mice.\n\nPreparation and growth of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF), BS-C-1 cells (ATCC CCl- 26) and HeLa S3 (ATCC-CCL-2.2) have been previously described [5, 20] .\n\nMVA 1974/NIH Clone 1 was derived from a vial originally obtained from Anton Mayr and plaque purified 3x at the NIH [5] .\n\nThe env open reading frame of HIV ADA (clade B) was modified as described previously [21] . TTTTTNT sequences, representing poxvirus transcription termination signals, were modified by introducing silent mutations with the Quik Change Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The C-terminal 115 amino acids of gp41 were deleted by PCR amplification of the gene yielding a terminal sequence of GGDRD. Three safety mutations were made in the HXB2/ BH10 gag-pol to inactivate reverse transcriptase, and the associated integrase gene was deleted as described [22] .\n\nThe transfer plasmid pLAS-1 (Fig. 1A) , which contains sequences flanking deletion III of the MVA genome, was constructed in the following steps: i) the P11 VACV promoter and the Escherichia coli glucuronidase (GUS) gene were removed from pLW-51 [21] by digestion with restriction enzymes AscI and SacI; ii) the P11 VACV promoter and the gene encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) obtained from pLW-44 [23] by PCR amplification with AscI and SacI ends were inserted into pLW51 and the resulting plasmid named pLW-51GFP; iii) the psynII promoter was removed from pLW-51GFP by XhoI and NotI digestions, and the resulting pLAS-1 plasmid recircularized by ligation. The mutated gagpol gene was amplified by PCR and inserted into the SalI site of pLAS-1.\n\nThe transfer plasmid pLAS-2 ( Fig. 1A) , which contains sequences flanking deletion II of the MVA genome, was constructed by inserting the mH5 VACV promoter [24] with HincII and SmaI sites into the SmaI site of pLW-16 [25] to make pLW-37. The last 217 bases of MVA flank 2 were duplicated by PCR amplification with ending KpnI sites (containing AscI and SacI sites on the forward oligo) and inserted into the KpnI site of pLW-37 to make a direct repeat. The P11 VACV promoter and GFP were inserted between the two direct repeats at restriction sites AscI and SacI and the resulting plasmid was designated pLAS-2.\n\nThe env gene described above was inserted into either the SmaI or NotI site of pLAS-2. Because a SphI site containing an ATG is located between the SmaI and NotI sites, insertion into the latter site resulted in a premature translation start site. New transfer shuttle plasmids containing the env gene were designated: pLAS-2ADAenv (NotI site) ( Fig.1 B1) , pLW-66 (SmaI site) ( Fig. 1 B2) , and pJD-17 (Sph I site) (Fig.1 B3) . The correct sequences of the promoter and HIV env gene in each plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing.\n\nThe plasmid transfer vectors were transfected into MVA infected CEF cells as previously described [26] and fluorescent foci that expressed GFP were picked followed by a second round of picking GFP-expressing plaques. Subsequently, because of the direct repeats, GFP could be deleted on further passage so non GFP-expressing plaques were picked and analyzed for Env or Gag by plaque immunostaining. MVA expressing both Env and Gag-Pol were generated by recombination after co-infecting CEF with the single recombinant viruses, each at a multiplicity of 5.\n\n>Metabolic labeling of cells with [ 35 S]methionine and immunoprecipitation of HIV Env and Gag have been described in detail [24] . Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) T8 and T32 react with gp120 and gp41, respectively [27] and MAb 183-H12-5C with Gag p24 [28] . Immunoprecipitated labeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.\n\nFor quantitative Western blotting, BS-C-1 cells were infected at a multiplicity of 10 and harvested at 24 h. Two-fold dilutions of lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with mouse T8 mAb and secondary R-Dye-800CW conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc., Gilbertsville, PA). Reactive bands were quantitated using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska). Band intensities from four consecutive lysate dilutions were subjected to linear regression analysis using Prism software (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA) and the slope determined.\n\nGenetic stability of the HIV env and gag genes was assessed by repeated passages of rMVA. Virus was passaged at an MOI of approximately 1 pfu/cell in CEF, grown for three days, harvested, and reinoculated at MOI of 1 onto freshly made CEF for each passage. Yields of passaged viruses were titrated in CEF, using medium containing 0.5% methylcellulose. After 3 days incubation, the infected cells were fixed and stained with mAbs reactive to Env or Gag [26] .\n\nSeven-week-old BALB/c mice (5 per group) were inoculated intramuscularly at weeks 0 and 4 with 10 7 pfu of rMVA (greater than 95% of infectious virus particles in each stock expressed both Env and Gag proteins). For dose response experiments, mice were immunized with 10 3.7 , 10 4.7 or 10 5.7 pfu. Mice were bled at 0, 3 and 6 weeks.\n\nNinety-six well plates (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) were coated overnight with 0.5 \u03bcg/ml of sheep antibody to the C-terminus of gp120 (International Enzymes, Inc, Fallbrook, CA) in bicarbonate buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), followed by purified ADA gp140 (0.6 \u03bcg/ml) of HIV clade B ADA as described [17] . Two-fold serial dilutions of sera were added and plates incubated overnight at room temperature followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). BM Blue substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added for 30 min and absorbency read at 370 and 492 nm.\n\nFor intracellular cytokine assays comparing all of the rMVAs, 2\u00d710 6 splenocytes, prepared from individual animals at three weeks after the second immunization, were mixed with 1\u00d710 5 P815 cells pulsed with either the immunodominant Gag peptide AMQMLKETI or the Env V3 peptide IGPGRAFYTT. After 2 h at 37\u00b0C, brefeldin A (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml. Following overnight incubation, the cells were washed, blocked with purified CD16/32 (Clone 2.4G2, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated CD3 (Clone 145-2C11, BD Pharmingen) and allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated CD8 (Clone 53-6.7, BD Pharmingen). The cells were then fixed and permeabilized, stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 B\u1e0cPharminge\u1e47), and resuspended in 2% paraformaldehyde. About 100,000 cells were acquired on a FACSCalibur (San Jose, CA) using Cell Quest analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc, Ashland, OR) to determine the percentage of CD3+ CD8+ splenocytes that expressed IFN-\u03b3. Dose response studies were carried out on splenocytes pooled from 5 mice harvested 2 weeks after immunization as previously described [29] .\n\nConfluent cultures of HeLa cells, grown in 60 mm diameter dishes, were infected with MVA62B or MVA62BSm1 at a multiplicity of 5 pfu per cell. After 28 h, the cells were fixed, embedded in epon, and ultrathin sections stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate in preparation for transmission electron microscopy. Alternatively, infected cells were cryosectioned and immunostained with T8 and T32 mAbs to HIV Env protein, followed by protein A gold as described previously [30] .\n\nStatistical differences between antibody and T cell responses elicited by various recombinant MVA/HIV constructs were assessed by Mann-Whitney using Prism software (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA).\n\nWe constructed three rMVAs that express HIV Env at low or high levels and Gag at the same level. The env gene of the HIV clade B strain ADA was modified by removal of poxvirus transcription termination signals and truncation of 115 amino acids from the cytoplasmic tail of gp41. The latter alternation has been shown to increase the amount of Env protein on the surface of infected cells, the immunogenicity of Env in mice, and the stability of the recombinant virus in tissue culture [31] . We achieved differential Env expression by using the same mH5 promoter [24] to regulate transcription of env in each construct and modulating the efficiency of translation. Thus, insertion of env into the NotI site of the transfer vector pLAS-2 resulted in the presence of a premature translation initiation codon and a presumed out-offrame product of 33 amino acids (Fig. 1A, B1) . Reinitiation at the start of the env open reading frame was predicted to occur at a reduced level in accordance with the scanning model of translation [32] . In contrast, insertion of env into the SmaI site (Fig. 1B2 ) or after mutation of the upstream ATG codon (Fig. 1B3) , eliminated premature initiation and was therefore predicted to increase translation. Each env gene expression cassette was then inserted into del II of MVA by homologous recombination. Another rMVA containing a clade B HXB2/BH10 gag-pol gene regulated by the mH5 promoter in del III was constructed by insertion into pLAS-1 (Fig. 1A) followed by homologous recombination. MVAs expressing both Env and Gag-Pol were subsequently isolated by co-infecting cells with Env and Gag-Pol viruses and isolating double recombinants. Double recombinant viruses with env inserted at either NotI or SmaI sites of pLAS-2 were named MVA62B and MVA62BSm, respectively; the rMVA in which the ATG codon from the SphI site was removed was designated MVA62BSp. Two independent clones of MVA62BSm and MVA62BSp, designated 1 and 2, were isolated. Genetic stability of Env after 8 or 9 passages was demonstrated by staining plaques with Envspecific antibody.\n\n[ 35 S]methionine-labeled Env and Gag proteins, synthesized by rMVAs in BS-C-1 cells, were immunoprecipated with mAbs, resolved by PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Env gp160 and its cleavage product gp120 were resolved as two closely spaced bands and lower expression by MVA62B as compared to MVA62BSm and MVA62BSp was evident ( Fig. 2A) . Quantitative Western blotting indicated that MVA62BSm1 and MVA62BSp2 expressed 4.4and 6.2-fold more Env, respectively, than did MVA62B. As expected, all rMVAs expressed similar amounts of Gag proteins (Fig. 2B) , since the gag gene was inserted into each rMVA in the same manner. The assembly of Gag into VLPs was suggested by the presence of p24 protein in pellets produced from infected cell supernatants sedimented through sucrose cushions (data not shown). VLPs were also visualized by transmission electron microscopy of rMVA-infected cells (Fig. 3A) . The presence of Env on VLPs produced by both MVA62B and MVA62BSm1 was detected by immunogold labeling (Fig. 3B ).\n\nMice (5/group) immunized with 10 7 pfu of rMVA at 0 and 4 weeks developed antibody responses as measured by an Env ELISA binding assay using purified gp140 as the capture antigen (Fig. 4A) . The ELISA titers of sera from mice immunized with MVA62BSm and MVA62BSp were \u223c15-fold higher than that of mice immunized with MVA62B. This difference was statistically significant when comparing MVA62B to each of the high expressors (p=0.008). In contrast, the anti-VACV ELISA titers differed by less than 2.5-fold (not shown), confirming that titers of virus inocula were similar. Sera collected prior to immunization as well as sera from wild type MVA-inoculated mice were uniformly negative for Env antibodies (data not shown). Gag antibody responses were also measured, but were extremely variable within each group of 5 mice and the differences were not statistically significant (data not shown).\n\nIn a second experiment, similar analyses were carried out using lower virus inocula. At a 10 5.7 pfu dose, which is about 20-fold lower than the dose used above, the difference between the ELISA titers of low and high expressing rMVAs was approximately 100-fold (Fig. 4B) . Thus the expression of higher levels of Env in tissue culture was associated with the elicitation of higher levels of Ab in mice.\n\nMice (5/group) were immunized twice (0 and 4 weeks) with 10 7 pfu of the rMVAs, and spleens were harvested 3 weeks after the second immunization. Splenocytes from individual mice were assayed directly ex vivo after overnight culture with Env peptide-pulsed P815 cells. CD8+ IFN-\u03b3+ cells were enumerated by flow cytometry. rMVAs expressing higher levels of Env induced 3 to 5-fold higher percentages of CD8+ IFN-\u03b3+ T cells in comparison to the lower Envexpressing MVA62B (Fig. 5A) . The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.008, 0.02, and 0.008) for MVA62BSm1, MVA62BSm2 and MVA62BSp2, respectively. In contrast to the difference in Env-specific CD8+ T cell responses, Gag-specific CD8+ IFN-\u03b3+ cell responses were similar with no statistically significant difference between groups (Fig. 5B) . Thus, the higher Env CD8+ T cell responses were specifically related to higher Env expression. Furthermore, the higher Env CD8+ T cell response did not compromise the Gag response.\n\nSimilar CD8+ IFN-g+ T cell analyses were assessed in mice immunized once or twice with lower rMVA inocula (10 3.7 to 10 5.7 pfu) of MVA62BSm1, MVA62BSp2, and MVA62B. As above, similar Gag CD8+ T cell responses were induced by each rMVA and the effect of increasing virus dose was relatively modest, as previously reported [29] (Fig.6A) . The Envspecific CD8+ T cell responses were higher in mice inoculated with MVA62BSm1 and MVA62BSp2 as compared to those in mice inoculated with MVA62B. This difference was magnified several fold in mice receiving lower inocula. CD4+ T cell responses were also measured in mice after one or two immunizations with 10 3.7 to 10 5.7 pfu of rMVAs. The Gag-specific CD4+ T cell responses, like the corresponding CD8+ T cell responses, were similar whereas MVA62BSm1 and MVA62Sp2 elicited several fold higher anti-Env CD4+ responses than did MVA62B (Fig. 6B) . This difference was seen after one or two immunizations.\n\nThe majority of vaccine studies using rMVA have focused on the immunogen rather than the level of expression per se. We previously reported that the stability of gene inserts in some rMVA could be enhanced by decreasing expression of the apparently toxic foreign protein [24] . We adopted the mH5 promoter, which gives relatively high expression at early times of infection and moderate expression at late times compared to some other promoters, as a standard for construction of recombinant MVA vaccines [24] . Nevertheless, even this level of expression can be toxic depending on the protein (Wyatt and Moss, unpublished results).\n\nThese observations raised the question of whether high protein expression is necessary for raising good immune responses. To address this, we modulated the expression of the HIV Env protein by introducing an upstream translation initiation codon as described by Kozak [32] . This strategy provided some advantage over altering promoter strength because vaccinia virus late mRNAs traverse downstream genes and in theory can interfere with their transcription by promoter occlusion. The 5-fold lower expression of Env achieved in this manner is similar to the difference in expression of Env using our favored mH5 promoter and the weaker 7.5 promoter [24] , which has been used for rMVAs by some other groups [9, 33] . Although the upstream translation initiation site lowered the amount of Env, the protein size, cleavage pattern and incorporation into VLPs appeared unchanged. Comparative immunogenicity studies indicated a difference of 15-to 100-fold in the antibody response to Env and a several fold difference in Env-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The superiority of the high expressers was seen over a 100-fold range in virus inoculum size. We concluded that increasing the inoculum was not as useful as increasing the level of expression.\n\nOur results are in accord with several previous studies. Thus, CD8+ T cell responses elicited by DNA vaccines increase with the level of expression and dose [34, 35] . Using replication competent VACV recombinants in which cell surface epitope expression was modulated, Wherry et al. [36, 37] have shown a correlation of epitope density and increased CTL response. A positive relationship between dose and immunogenicity was also obtained using rMVA [7, 29] . In comparing canarypox virus and MVA vectors, a positive correlation was found between expression levels and T cell responses in an in vitro assay of antigen presentation [38] . The need for high expression of a stable protein is also consistent with a recent report that CTL responses elicited by recombinant MVA are dominated by cross-priming mechanisms in vivo [39] .\n\nThe beneficial effect of high expression highlights the importance of reducing the tendency of recombinant MVA to delete genes that encode toxic products. We have taken two approaches to accomplish this. The first is to modify HIV Env by truncating the cytoplasmic tail [31] . The second is to decrease the frequency of Env mutations and deletions (Wyatt, Earl and Moss, manuscript in preparation). Ultimately, for vaccine purposes, one should aim at constructing rMVA that produce as much recombinant protein as is consistent with the growth and stability of the rMVA. Electron micrograph of MVA62B and MVA62BSm1-infected HeLa cells. Infected HeLa cells were fixed and stained for transmission electron microscopy (A) or cryosectioned and immunostained with T8 and T32 mAbs to Env followed by 10 nm gold particles conjugated to protein A (B). Serum IgG ELISA Env responses. (A) Groups of 5-10 mice were inoculated intramuscularly with 10 7 pfu of rMVA and boosted at one month. At 2 weeks after the second immunization, mice were bled and serum IgG response determined by ELISA assay using purified ADA gp140 as antigen. (B) Similar to above except that 10 5.7 pfu of rMVAs were used for inoculation. Results are the averages of individual mouse titers anderror bars represent standard error of the mean. Env and Gag CD8+ T cell responses. Env-specific (A) and Gag-specific (B) INF-\u03b3 producing CD8+ T cells were enumerated in splenocytes from mice that had been immunized twice with 10 7 pfu of each of rMVA as described in Materials and Methods. Results presented are the averages of individual mouse spleen determination and error bars represent standard error of the mean. Effect of dose on Env-specific and Gag-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses. Groups of 5 mice were immunized with 10 3.7 , 10 4.7 , or 10 5.7 pfu of MVA62B (filled line), MVA62BSm1 (dashed line) or MVA62BSp2 (dotted line) and boosted at week 4 by intramuscular inoculations. Spleens were harvested at 2 weeks after one or two immunizations and pooled for each group. Splenocytes were stimulated with 4 HIV-1 ADA Env peptide pools or immunodominant Gag peptide AMQMLKETI and 2 Gag peptide pools as previously described [29] . Env-specific or HIV Gag-specific INF-\u03b3 producing CD8+ (A) or CD4+ (B) cells were quantitated by flow cytometry."}
