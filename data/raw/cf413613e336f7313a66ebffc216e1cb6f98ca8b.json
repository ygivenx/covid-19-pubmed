{"title": "The synthesis, antiviral, cytostatic and cytotoxic evaluation of a new series of acyclonucleotide analogues with a 1,2,3-triazole linker", "body": "Several acyclic nucleosides and nucleotides exhibit antiviral or anticancer activities. However, in most cases, the clinical use of antiviral nucleosides is hampered by the drug resistance and/or toxicity problems. Under these circumstances intensive search for new drugs effective in the chemotherapy of viruses such as HIV, herpes virus, hepatitis viruses and cytomegalovirus has been conducted by many laboratories. A large number of modifications has been introduced to both the nucleobase and the sugar moieties of natural nucleosides. Consequently, several analogues like adefovir [1, 2] , tenofovir [3] and cidofovir [4] (Fig. 1) were synthesised in which the furanose ring and the readily hydrolysable phosphate ester linkage present in natural nucleotides have been replaced by an acyclic chain and phosphonate moiety, respectively.\n\nIn drug discovery replacement of canonical nucleobases [5] by substituted five-membered heterocyclic rings such as imidazole or triazole has been particularly successful. Ribavirin [6e12], AICA [13, 14] , Bredinin [15, 16] and TSAO analogues [17, 18] are the best known examples among these analogues (Fig. 2) .\n\nFurther efforts in this field led to the synthesis of several analogues containing both modified nucleobases and 1,2,3-triazole moieties [19e37] . Among them compounds 1e11 [27e37] in which nucleobases or their mimetics and substituted triazoles are linked by the methylene group are of special interest (Fig. 3) .\n\nMoreover, several compounds possessing the 1,2,3-triazole ring show cytostatic [38e45], antiviral [46e49], antibacterial [50e56] or antifungal activities [57e60] . The conventional synthesis of 1,2,3-triazoles relies on the H\u00fcisgen [3 \u00fe 2] cycloaddition between alkynes and organic azides and usually provides a mixture of 1,4and 1,5-disubstitued regioisomers [61, 62] . Recent discovery of copper(I) as an efficient and regiospecific catalyst for this transformation [63, 64] provides a general and mild approach for the preparation of 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole derivatives.\n\nIn continuation of our studies on nucleotide analogues [65e70] a new series of modified phosphonylated 1,2,3-triazoloa cyclonucleosides bearing selected nucleobases or their mimetics at C-4 of the 1,2,3-triazole moiety (Scheme 1) has been synthesised and subjected to biological evaluation.\n\nCompounds 20e26 ael were obtained by the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azidoalkylphosphonates 12e18 with propargylated nucleobases 19ael: N 9 -propargyladenine 19a [27] , N 1 -propargylthymine 19b [27] , N 1 -propargyluracil 19c [71] and N 4acetyl-N 1 -propargylcytosine 19d [71] and mimetics of nucleobases: N 3 -benzoyl-N 1 -propargylquinazoline-2,4-dione 19e, N 1 -propargyl-6-azauracil 19f [30] , 8-chloro-N 7 -propargyltheophylline 19g [72] , N 1 -propargyltheobromine 19h [73, 74] , N 7 -propargyltheophylline 19i [75] , 5,6-dimethyl-N 1 -propargylbenzimidazole 19j [76] , 3acetyl-N-propargylindole 19k [77] , N-propargyl-2-pyridon 19l [76] . The required azidoalkylphosphonates 12e18 were synthesised according to the procedures described previously [65, 66, 69, 78, 79] .\n\nExcept for N 3 -benzoyl-N 1 -propargylquinazoline-2,4-dione 19e all alkynes used in this paper have already been described in the literature. N 3 -Benzoyl-N 1 -propargylquinazoline-2,4-dione 19e was synthesised in 19% overall yield in three steps from quinazoline-2,4-dione 27 beginning with bis-N 1 ,N 3 -benzoylation to 28 followed by the selective N 1 -debenzoylation to 29 and propargylation (Scheme 2). The N 3 -benzoylquinazoline-2,4-dione 29 was previously obtained from 2-benzoylaminobenzoxazinone in less than 5% yield [80] .\n\nThe structure of N 3 -benzoyl-N 1 -propargylquinazoline-2,4-dione 19e was confirmed on the basis of 1 H, 13 C NMR and IR spectral data and finally proved by 2D COSY and NOESY experiments (Fig. 4) . All 1,2,3-triazoles 20e26 were obtained in good yields in 1,3dipolar cycloadditions which were carried out in a microwave oven at 40e45 C. This approach caused significant improvements in purity of the final products and allows to shorten the reaction time from 48 h at room temperature to 10 min of irradiation. Since syntheses of phosphonylated 1,2,3-triazoles 20aed, 21aed, 22aed, 24aed and 25aed have already been described and their biological activity evaluated [32, 69] , N 9 -propargyladenine 19a, N 1 -propargylthymine 19b, N 1 -propargyluracil 19c and N 4 -acetyl-N 1 -propargylcytosine 19d were reacted with two azidophosphonates 15 and 18, only. However, mimetics of nucleobases 19eel were applied in cycloadditions with all seven azidophosphonates 12e18 (Schemes 3 and 4).\n\nSince the preliminary experiments have demonstrated antiviral activity of compound 22e against herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2) in HEL cell cultures (EC 50 \u00bc 17 mM) and feline herpes virus (EC 50 \u00bc 24 mM) in CRFK cell cultures, phosphonate 22m was synthesised in order to establish the influence of the fused phenyl ring in 22e on the observed activity (Scheme 5).\n\nOur synthesis of N 3 -benzoyl-N 1 -propargyluracil 19m by propargylation of N 3 -benzoyluracil with propargyl bromide (Scheme 6) appeared more efficient (95%) in comparison to the previously described approach from N 3 -benzoyluracil and propargyl alcohol via the Mitsunobu reaction (76% yield) [81] .\n\nFinally, using bromotrimethylsilane [82] selected diethyl phosphonates 22e, 22g, 22j, 22m, 23aec and 24i were transformed into the respective phosphonic acids in good yields (Scheme 7).\n\nAll the synthesised compounds 20e26 aem, 31e, 31g, 31j, 31m, 32aec and 33i were evaluated for their antiviral activities against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses, using the following cellbased assays: (a) human embryonic lung (HEL ). Ganciclovir, cidofovir, acyclovir, brivudin, (S)-9-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)adenine [(S)-DHPA], Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA), Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA), dextran sulphate (molecular weight 5000, DS-5000), ribavirin, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine and rimantadine were used as the reference compounds. The antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 : the compound concentration required to reduce virus plaque formation (VZV) by 50% or to reduce virusinduced cytopathogenicity by 50% (other viruses).\n\nThe cytotoxicity of the tested compounds toward the uninfected host cells was defined as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) that causes a microscopically detectable alteration of normal cell morphology. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ), causing a 50% decrease in cell viability was determined using a colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay system. Among all the 1,2,3-triazole derivatives tested, compound 22e having a three carbon fragment between the phosphorus atom and the 1,2,3-triazole ring substituted at C4 0 with N 3 -benzoyl-N 1methylquinazoline-2,4-dione showed a moderate activity against both herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2) (EC 50 \u00bc 17 mM) in HEL cell cultures, and feline herpes virus (EC 50 \u00bc 24 mM) in CRFK cell cultures.\n\nThe cytostatic activity of the tested compounds was defined as the 50% cytostatic inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ), causing a 50% decrease in cell proliferation was determined against murine leukaemia L1210, human lymphocyte CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells. Most compounds were not cytostatic at 200 mM.\n\nSeveral compounds showed very moderate inhibitory against the proliferation of tumour cell lines (Table 1) , although in a few cases, the compounds seemed to be preferentially cytostatic against human tumour cell lines (esp. lymphocyte CEM cells) than murine (L1210) cells. In particular, compound 20k, 21k, 22k and 23k were antiproliferative at IC 50 values ranging between 2.8 and 12 mM.\n\nStructureeactivity relationship studies on a series of 1,2,3triazoloacyclonucleotides 20e26 aem and 30e, g, j, m, 31aec and 32i revealed cytostatic activity of compounds substituted at C4 0 of the 1,2,3-triazole ring with 3-acetylindole, N 3 -benzoylquinazoline-2,4-dione and 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole. Regardless of the length of the linker (1e4 carbon atoms) all derivatives of the 1,2,3triazoles with 3-acetylindole were the most active towards CEM cell lines (e.g. IC 50 \u00bc 2.78 AE 1.4 mM for 20k) and also some of them against HeLa cells. Furthermore, compounds 21j, 22e, 23k, 24k, 25e and 26e selectively inhibited the proliferation of human Tlymphocyte (CEM).\n\nAs could be expected the phosphonic acids were found inactive in all biological tests including these acids for which the corresponding diethyl esters displayed significant activity (22e vs. 31e and 22j vs. 31j). This is in full agreement with observation that lipophilic phosphonate esters better penetrate through membranes in comparison with phosphonic acids and thus the sufficient concentration of the ester is achieved in cells to undergo further reactions.\n\nFor compound 22e containing a three methylene linker between the phosphorus atom and the 1,2,3-triazole ring substituted at C4 0 with N 3 -benzoyl-N 1 -methylquinazoline-2,4-dione activity against both herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2) (EC 50 \u00bc 17 mM) in HEL cell cultures, and feline herpes virus (EC 50 \u00bc 24 mM) in CRFK cell cultures was established. The presence of the quinazoline ring appeared necessary for 22e to display antiviral activity, since its structural analogue lacking the condensed phenyl ring (compound 22m) was found inactive EC 50 > 200 mM.\n\nA new series of 1,2,3-triazoloacyclonucleotides 20e26 aem has been efficiently obtained from diethyl azidomethyl-, 2-azidoethyl-, 3-azidopropyl-, 4-azidobutyl-, 2-azido-1-hydroxyethyl-, 3-azido-2- The N 3 -benzoyl-N 1 -propargylquinazoline-2,4-dione 19e was synthesised from quinazoline-2,4-dione 27 in the sequence of reactions including bis-N 1 ,N 3 -benzoylation followed by the selective N 1 -debenzoylation and propargylation.\n\nUnder standard conditions (TMSBr, ethanol) several O,O-diethyl phosphonates 22e, g, j, m, 23aec and 24i were transformed into their respective phosphonic acid.\n\nAll synthesised compounds were evaluated against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses. Compound 22e containing a three carbon linker between the phosphorus atom and the 1,2,3-triazole ring substituted at C4 0 with N 3 -benzoyl-N 1 -methylquinazoline-2,4dione showed a moderate activity (EC 50 All synthesised compounds were also evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against three tumour cell lines (L1210, CEM and HeLa) and several compounds, i.e. 20k, 21jek, 22jek, 23jek and 24k were found to be the most active (and preferentially inhibitory) towards T-lymphocyte CEM cell proliferation. IR spectral data were measured on an Infinity MI-60 FT-IR spectrometer. Melting points were determined on a Boetius apparatus and are uncorrected. Elemental analyses were performed by the Microanalytical Laboratory of this Faculty on a Perkin Elmer PE 2400 CHNS analyzer.\n\nThe following adsorbents were used: column chromatography, Merck silica gel 60 (70e230 mesh); analytical TLC, Merck TLC plastic sheets silica gel 60 F 254 . TLC plates were developed in chloroformemethanol solvent systems. Visualisation of spots was effected with iodine vapours. All solvents were purified by methods described in the literature.\n\nAll microwave irradiation experiments were carried out in microwave reactor Plazmartonika RM 800. The reaction carried out in 50 mL glass vial.\n\nThe benzoyl chloride (6.48 mL, 0.056 mol) was added to a stirred suspension of quinazoline-2,4-dione (4.00 g, 0.025 mol) in dry acetonitrile (25 mL) containing dry pyridine (10 mL) at room temperature. After 24 h the products were concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned between dichloromethane (100 mL) and water (100 mL). The organic layer was dried (MgSO 4 ), concentrated in vacuo and the residue was crystallised from ethanol to give 1,3-dibenzoylquinazoline-2,4-dione 28 (7.985 g, 87%) as a white powder; m.p.: 159e160 C; IR (KBr): \n\nA mixture of 1,3-dibenzoylquinazoline-2,4-dione 28 (1.73 g, 4.67 mmol), dioxane (50 mL) and 1 N K 2 CO 3 aq. (25 mL) was stirred at room temperature. After 24 h glacial acetic acid was added to pH 5. The products were concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was stirred with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (200 mL) at room temperature for 2 h. The solid was filtered off, washed with cold water and dried on air. The crude product was chromatographed on a silica gel column with chloroformemethanol \n\nA suspension of N 3 -benzoylquinazoline-2,4-dione 29 (0.239 g, 0.898 mmol), potassium carbonate (0.135 g, 0.978 mmol) and propargyl bromide (0.081 mL, 1.08 mmol) in DMF (3 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The mixture was co-evaporated with toluene (5 \u00c2 10 mL). The residue was dissolved in chloroform \n\nTheophylline >200 >200 >200 a 50% Inhibitory concentration or compound concentration required to inhibit tumour cell proliferation by 50%.\n\n(10 mL) and washed with brine (2 \u00c2 5 mL \n\nA suspension of N 3 -benzoyluracil 30 (0.506 g, 0.234 mmol), potassium carbonate (0.356 g, 0.257 mmol) and propargyl bromide (0.211 mL, 0.281 mmol) in DMF (4 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The mixture was co-evaporated with toluene (5 \u00c2 10 mL). The residue was dissolved in chloroform (10 mL) and washed with brine (2 \u00c2 5 mL). The organic phase was dried over MgSO 4 , concentrated in vacuo and crystallised from methanole diethyl ether to give compound 19m (0.562 g, 95%) as a white solid; m.p.: 139e140 C; 1 \n\nTo a solution of azidoalkylphosphonate (1.00 mmol) in EtOH (1 mL) and H 2 O (1 mL) were added CuSO 4 \u00c2 5H 2 O (0.05 mmol), sodium ascorbate (0.10 mmol) and alkynes (1.00 mmol). The suspension was microwave irradiated in the microwave reactor (Plazmatronika RM 800, 800 W) at 40e45 C for 10 min. After cooling the solvent was removed by vacuum evaporation. The residue was suspended in dry chloroform (5 mL) and filtered through a layer of Celite. The solution was concentrated in vacuo and the crude product was purified on a silica gel column with chloroformemethanol mixtures (50:1, 20:1 or 10:1, v/v) to give the appropriate 1,2,3-triazoles. recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virusinfected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. The antiviral concentration was expressed as the EC 50 or 50%-effective compound concentration required to inhibit virusinduced cytopathicity by 50%.\n\nThe cytotoxicity of the test compounds was monitored as a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology, and expressed as the minimal cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or compound concentration required to afford a microscopically detectable alteration of cell culture morphology.\n\nThe cytostatic activity of the test compounds was determined as the 50% cytostatic concentration (IC 50 ) or compound concentration required to inhibit cell proliferation by 50%.

At the end of the exponential proliferation phase, the cells were counted by an automated Coulter ZI particle counter (Analis, Ghent, Belgium)."}
