{"title": "Potent and selective inhibition of pathogenic viruses by engineered ubiquitin variants", "body": "Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification mediated by an enzyme cascade that results in the conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub) to cellular proteins [1, 2]. This process is regulated in part through activity of cellular deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which remove Ub from cellular proteins [1, 2]. Given the essential role of the Ub system in regulating a large number of critical cellular processes, it is not surprising that viruses have acquired the means to modulate this system in order to promote infection and replication in host cells [3]. In particular, virus-encoded DUBs reverse the ubiquitination process to alter host signaling pathways critical to the induction of cellular antiviral and pro-inflammatory innate immune responses [3]. In addition to removing Ub molecules from host proteins, many viral DUBs (vDUBs) also remove the Ub-like protein interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) to further suppress antiviral responses [4, 5]. Importantly, a number of vDUBs also play an essential role in viral replication [4\u20136]. Together, the replicative and/or deubiquitinating activities of viral proteases contribute directly to pathogenesis during viral infection in vivo [7], making them ideal antiviral drug targets.\n\nThe Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) viruses have caused significant concern globally due to their rapid emergence, high lethality rates in humans [8], and high potential for genetic recombination. Coronaviruses initially express their non-structural proteins (nsps) as large viral polyproteins, which are processed into functional domains by proteases encoded within the polyproteins to establish a viral replication-transcriptase complex. SARS- and MERS-CoV release nsp1-3 through the activity of a papain-like protease (PLpro) domain situated within nsp3, in a process that is indispensable for replication [4]. The chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), corresponding to nsp5, is responsible for cleaving the remaining part of the polyproteins, releasing mature nsps [8]. Strikingly, coronaviral PLpros also act as vDUBs to suppress host antiviral innate immune responses by targeting cellular Ub-conjugated substrates [9\u201314]. The CoV proteases are well-recognized drug targets, and since the emergence of these zoonotic CoVs research has focused on the identification and development of small molecule inhibitors targeting these enzymes [15, 16]. Another highly pathogenic virus that encodes a vDUB is the nairovirus Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). The CCHFV vDUB domain is located within the large (L) segment of the genome, and has also been explicitly implicated in the evasion of host Ub- and ISG15-dependent innate immune responses [17].\n\nCrystal structures of PLpro from MERS- and SARS-CoV revealed that these proteases share structural similarity with cellular DUBs belonging to the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family [9, 18, 19]. Conversely, structural studies of nairovirus vDUBs revealed resemblance to the ovarian tumor (OTU) domain family of DUBs [20, 21]. In addition to these well characterized vDUBs, which are conserved in the coronavirus and nairovirus families respectively, numerous other vDUBs have been identified across diverse and distantly related virus lineages of significant concern to human health and agriculture. They include arteriviruses, herpesviruses, adenoviruses, picornaviruses, hepadnaviruses and tymoviruses, further emphasizing the broad potential utility of vDUB-specific antivirals [22].\n\nThe importance of vDUBs in viral replication and innate immune evasion make them attractive pharmacological targets, although their structural similarity with human DUBs has posed a significant challenge that complicates the successful development of highly selective small molecule vDUB inhibitors [23]. Despite intensive efforts, only a handful of inhibitors targeting vDUB proteases have been reported, and none have been approved for clinical use [24]. To meet this challenge, we have developed a strategy to target the vDUB activity as an antiviral approach by the rapid identification of virus-specific, protein-based vDUB inhibitors from a phage-displayed library of billions of Ub variants (UbVs). The exquisite specificity of identified UbVs has also enabled us to isolate UbVs that potently inhibit human Ub-binding proteins with equally high specificity [25, 26]. Here we describe UbVs that selectively block the deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities of MERS-CoV and CCHFV OTU vDUB domains. Importantly, UbVs specific for MERS-CoV abolished replicative polyprotein processing activities. Expression of MERS-CoV-specific UbVs during MERS-CoV infection reduced infectious progeny titers by more than four orders of magnitude, demonstrating the remarkable potency of UbVs as antiviral agents.\n\nThe UbV library [25] was screened against the MERS-CoV PLpro domain (MERS-CoV PLpro) and the CCHFV OTU domain (CCHFV OTU). Within three weeks, UbVs were identified that bound with high affinity to either MERS-CoV PLpro (ME.1 to ME.4) or CCHFV OTU (CC.1 to CC.5) (Fig 1A). To confirm the specificity of the UbVs towards their cognate vDUBs, the phage-displayed UbVs were challenged against a diverse panel of 11 DUBs from several species representing distinct DUB families (USP, OTU, and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCH)). All UbVs bound to their cognate viral proteins but not to any of the 11 additional DUBs (Fig 1B). To determine the binding affinity of each UbV, phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (S1 Fig) and Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) measurements were performed (S2 Table). Each UbV was found to bind its cognate vDUB with affinities in the low to sub-nanomolar range, whereas wild-type Ub (Ub.wt) showed binding to MERS-CoV or CCHFV vDUBs only in the high micromolar range (S1B Fig and S1 Table). Consistent with the high affinities observed for the UbVs toward their respective vDUBs, each UbV also potently inhibited the deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities of MERS-CoV PLpro or CCHFV OTU as measured using the fluorogenic substrates Ub-AMC or ISG15-AMC, respectively (Fig 1C and S2 Fig). The most potent inhibitors of MERS-CoV PLpro and CCHFV OTU were ME.4 (deubiquitination IC50 = 0.8 nM and deISGlyation IC50 = 1.2 nM) and CC.4 (deubiquitination IC50 = 3.3 nM and deISGlyation IC50 = 11 nM), respectively (S1 Table). Furthermore, the UbVs were confirmed to inhibit processing of K48- and K63-linked tetra-Ub substrates by their respective vDUBs (Fig 1D).\n\nTo reveal the molecular basis for the inhibition of MERS-CoV PLpro by UbVs, crystal structures of the enzyme were determined bound to ME.2 or ME.4 (Fig 2A and 2B and Table 1). Both UbVs bound in nearly identical orientations as Ub.wt (Fig 2C and S3A Fig) with interface surface areas of ~1000 \u00c52 [9, 27]. Substitutions common to both ME.4 and ME.2 at positions 46, 64 and 70 (Fig 1A) were found to promote more favorable hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme relative to Ub.wt. In comparison to Ub.wt residue Val70, UbV residue Ile70 extends further into a hydrophobic pocket of PLpro formed by residues Thr1730* and Val1691* (asterisks denote amino acid numbering of MERS-CoV polyprotein) (Fig 2D). UbV residue Phe46 inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed by PLpro residues Trp1668*, Glu1670*, Val1680*, Leu1682*, Tyr1690* and Tyr1705*, and forms a cation-\u03c0 interaction with Arg1715* (Fig 2E). These extensive interactions are not formed at the PLpro-Ub.wt interface with the Ub.wt residue Ala46. In addition, UbV residue Tyr64 makes more extensive hydrophobic interactions with Val1706* and Gly1710*, compared to Ub.wt residue Glu64\n(Fig 2F). The UbVs also differ in their C-terminal residues at positions 74, 75 and 77 (Fig 1A). In ME.4, Asn74 extends into the active site and forms a hydrogen bonding network with Asp1645* and Gly1758* (Fig 2G), which mimics hydrogen bonds formed by the same region of MERS-CoV PLpro with Ub.wt residues Arg74, Gly75 and Gly76 (Fig 2H). In ME.2, Pro74 cannot form an analogous hydrogen bonding network, which likely contributes to the decreased inhibitory potency of ME.2 compared to ME.4 (Fig 1D and S2A and S2B Fig). Instead, Pro74 and the C-terminal tail are excluded from the active site and the main-chains interact through a hydrogen bond formed between the main-chain amide nitrogen of Arg75 and the backbone carbonyl of Glu1754* (Fig 2I). A structural comparison of the C-terminal regions of ME.2 and ME.4 near the PLpro active site is shown in S4 Fig. Additional substitutions in the N-terminal region of ME.4 and ME.2 (Fig 1A, region 1) do not make favourable contacts with MERS-CoV PLpro, and in fact, residues 8\u201310 and 7\u201310 of ME.4 and ME.2, respectively, failed to resolve in electron density maps (S5 Fig). Taken together, our structural analyses revealed that a small subset of substitutions is sufficient to enhance hydrophobic packing and hydrogen bond networks to endow ME.4 and ME.2 with highly potent and specific inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV PLpro.\n\nSimilarly, crystal structures of CCHFV OTU were determined bound to CC.2 or CC.4 to gain insight into how they selectively block the DUB and deISGylating activities of the viral protease (Fig 3A and 3B and Table 1). CC.2 and CC.4 were bound in the same orientation as Ub.wt with similar buried surface areas of ~1000 \u00c52 (Fig 3C and S3B Fig) [20, 21]. Interestingly, substitutions in these UbVs were concentrated in the C-terminal region (Fig 1A) and only substitutions at position 68 and downstream were found to interact with the enzyme. In both UbVs, Tyr68 improves hydrophobic packing with Thr10*, Val12* and Val18* (asterisks denote amino acid numbering of the large segment-encoded protein of CCHFV), relative to His68 in Ub.wt (Fig 3D). In CC.2, residue Leu70 projects further into a hydrophobic cavity in CCHFV OTU formed by residues Val12*, Ile14*, Val18* and Ile131*, than does the equivalent Ub.wt residue Val70 (Fig 3E). The conformational freedom of a Gly substitution at position 74 enables the C-terminal tail of each UbV to form numerous favorable interactions with the enzyme. Residues Gly75 and Val75 of CC.2 and CC.4, respectively, occupy space on the CCHFV OTU surface, which in the case of Ub.wt is occupied by the side-chain of Arg74 (Fig 3E\u20133G). This alternative conformation permitted by Gly74 in CC.2 and CC.4 allows the side-chain of Trp76 or Trp77 of CC.2 or CC.4, respectively, to pack within different adjacent grooves near the CCHFV OTU active site, with Trp76 of CC.2 forming a cation-\u03c0 interaction with Arg92* (Fig 3E), and the amide nitrogen group of CC.4 residue Trp77 forming a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Gln149* (Fig 3F). Conversely, Trp71 in both CC.2 and CC.4 does not interact with CCHFV OTU, but instead packs into a hydrophobic cavity within each UbV (Fig 3E and 3F). Differences between the orientations of the C-terminal tails of CC.2 and CC.4 arise from the variation at positions 75 and 76. In CC.4, residue Val75 packs against CCHFV OTU residue Trp99*, and Pro76 appears to restrict conformational freedom and enable hydrophobic interactions with Trp99* and Thr150* (Fig 3F). Together with the packing orientation of Trp77, these additional contacts likely account for the high binding affinity of CC.4 for CCHFV OTU (S2 Table).\n\nTo explore the effects of UbVs on MERS-CoV PLpro activity in cells, deubiquitination assays were performed by transfecting cells with combinations of plasmids encoding the following proteins: HA-tagged Ub (which becomes conjugated to cellular proteins), MERS-CoV PLpro, and UbVs (which are unconjugatable due to substitutions in the C-terminal di-Gly motif). A clear decrease of cellular HA-Ub conjugates was observed during co-expression of MERS-CoV PLpro, while there was no effect upon expression of a catalytically inactive mutant (Fig 4A, compare lanes 3 and 4). The co-expression of increasing doses of different UbVs attenuated MERS-CoV PLpro DUB activity to varying degrees (Fig 4A and S6A Fig). In a dose-dependent manner, ME.4 co-expression resulted in severe inhibition of HA-Ub deconjugation mediated by MERS-CoV PLpro, whereas co-expression of an unconjugatable form of Ub.wt as a negative control (Ub.AA, which contains Gly75Ala and Gly76Ala substitutions) had no effect on the DUB activity of MERS-CoV PLpro at any dose (Fig 4A, compare lanes 5\u20137 to 8\u201310). Like ME.4, ME.2 had a strong effect resulting in near complete inhibition of MERS-CoV PLpro DUB activity at the lowest UbV dose, whereas the inhibitory effect of ME.1 and ME.3 was apparent only at higher UbV doses (S6A Fig). Notably, none of the UbVs inhibited the DUB activity of the closely related SARS-CoV PLpro, highlighting their specificity for MERS-CoV PLpro (S7A Fig). A superposition of ME.4 onto the Ub domain of a previously determined SARS-CoV-Ub complex suggests that Phe46 and Ile70 of ME.4 clash with Val188* and Met209* of SARS-CoV PLpro, respectively, and offers a plausible explanation for the specificity of ME.2 and ME.4 toward MERS-COV PLpro (S8 Fig).\n\nWe previously found that the DUB activity of MERS-CoV PLpro suppresses IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity upon activation of cellular innate immune signaling [9]. In a luciferase-based IFN-\u03b2 reporter assay we show that ectopically expressed UbVs competed with endogenous Ub for binding to MERS-CoV PLpro resulting in an alleviated suppression of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity (Fig 4B and S6B Fig). Consistent with described binding and inhibition data, ME.2 and ME.4 were more potent than ME.1 and ME.3 at blocking the ability of MERS-CoV PLpro to suppress IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation, whereas none of the UbVs were able to block suppression of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity by SARS-CoV PLpro (S7B Fig). The UbVs thus prevented MERS-CoV PLpro-mediated suppression of cellular anti-viral innate immune responses, and in a remarkably selective, virus-specific manner.\n\nA critical step in the replication cycle of MERS-CoV is the processing of viral polyproteins into functional non-structural proteins (nsps) that is accomplished in part by the protease activity of PLpro, which cleaves the nsp1\u21932, nsp2\u21933, and nsp3\u21934 junctions [28]. In order to assess the ability of UbVs to inhibit MERS-CoV PLpro-mediated polyprotein processing activity, an in trans cleavage assay was performed [9]. FLAG-tagged UbVs and V5-tagged MERS-CoV PLpro were co-expressed with N-terminally HA-tagged and C-terminally V5-tagged nsp3C-4 (HA-nsp3C-4-V5), a fragment of the viral polyprotein encompassing the C-terminal part of nsp3 (excluding the PLpro domain) and nsp4. In trans cleavage of the nsp3\u21934 junction is indicative of proteolytic activity of PLpro during infection [9]. MERS-CoV PLpro efficiently cleaved HA-nsp3C-4-V5 into HA-nsp3C and nsp4-V5 products, whereas the active site mutant did not (Fig 4C, compare lanes 3 and 4). The cleavage of the nsp3\u21934 site was not affected upon expression of the negative control Ub.AA, whereas only a fraction of HA-nsp3C-4-V5 was cleaved upon expression of ME.4 or ME.2 at the lowest dose, and cleavage was completely blocked at higher UbV doses (Fig 4C compare lanes 5\u20137 to 8\u201310, S6C Fig). Increasing doses of ME.1 and ME.3 also resulted in reduced cleavage as gradually more HA-nsp3C-4-V5 precursor was observed (S6C Fig).\n\nTo directly asses the ability of UbVs to inhibit MERS-CoV replication, MERS-CoV PLpro-specific UbVs were ectopically expressed in cell culture, and cells were subsequently infected with MERS-CoV. MRC5 and HuH-7 cell lines were transduced with lentiviruses encoding FLAG-tagged UbVs, Ub.AA, or GFP. Efficient expression of FLAG-ME.1 and GFP in these cells was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and by western blotting (S9 Fig). Either 32 or 48 hours post-transduction, cells were infected with MERS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01, and MERS-CoV titers were determined from supernatants harvested 32 hours post infection (Fig 4D). In MRC5 cells, ME.1 and ME.4 expression resulted in significantly lower virus titers as these dropped from 5 x 105 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml recovered from control cells to 1,000 or 10 PFU/ml, respectively, when the MERS-CoV infection was started 32 hours post-transduction (Fig 4D). The effect of the UbVs was even more pronounced in MRC5 cells that were infected with MERS-CoV 48 hours post-transduction, as virus titers dropped below 10 PFU/ml upon expression of ME.4, which represented a reduction in infectious progeny titers of more than four orders of magnitude (Fig 4D) and correlated with higher expression of the UbVs at this time point (S9 Fig and S10 Fig). In HuH-7 cells the expression of GFP or Ub.AA did not affect MERS-CoV titers compared to the non-transduced cells, whereas ME.1 expression led to a two orders of magnitude reduction in virus titer, and an even greater reduction of more than three orders of magnitude was observed upon ME.4 expression (S11 Fig). The effect of UbVs on MERS-CoV progeny titers was more severe in MRC5 cells compared to HuH-7 cells, which might be due to generally higher expression of UbVs in MRC5 cells than in HuH-7 cells (Fig 4D, S9B Fig and S11 Fig). Taken together, these studies show that UbVs readily inhibit the proteolytic activities of MERS-CoV PLpro in cells and provide extremely effective protection from MERS-CoV infection.\n\nThe continued introduction of viruses from zoonotic sources into human populations poses a serious and constant threat to human health [8]. In the case of coronavirus infection, therapeutic options are limited, and vaccine development remains in progress [8, 29]. Here, we describe a unique protein engineering platform that can be used to rapidly generate UbVs to selectively block the activity of vDUBs from a range of evolutionarily distinct viral lineages. Indeed, UbVs generated against MERS-CoV almost completely abolished the replication of this virus in host cells. Meanwhile, none of the UbVs generated in this study likely cross-reacted with human DUBs as no toxicity was observed upon expression of UbVs, demonstrating their potential therapeutic safety.\n\nTargeting intracellular targets with protein-based inhibitors is currently not a therapeutic option due to the practical limitations of immunogenicity and the lack of efficient means for delivering proteins in to cells in vivo. However, progress continues to be made on methods for intracellular delivery of mRNA or proteins [30\u201332], and strategies to reduce immunogenicity, including the use of mirror-image proteins [33], have been developed. Thus, in the future, we are hopeful that UbVs may become bona fide drug candidates, but at present, they are best viewed as tool compounds that can enable drug discovery. For example, while the interface between the UbVs and vDUBs is large, we have recently used combinatorial mutagenesis to reveal a smaller site on human USPs within the UbV interaction interface, which may be amenable as a target for small-molecule inhibitor design [34]. Indeed, while the design of small molecules that target protein-protein interfaces remains challenging, there are successful examples where polypeptide-based tools have facilitated design and screening of small molecule inhibitors [35].\n\nA plethora of viruses causing human disease encode for vDUBs implicated in replication and/or pathogenesis, emphasizing the potential clinical importance of vDUBs as therapeutic targets [9, 36\u201341]. The UbV development platform can also be readily extended to target viruses that infect plants and animals of economic importance, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, equine arteritis virus, bovine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and turnip yellow mosaic virus, all of which encode vDUBs that are essential for virus replication [22]. In contrast, some vDUBs, like the CCHFV OTU protease, do not appear to process viral polyproteins and are instead dedicated to increasing viral pathogenicity by suppressing cellular innate immunity [17, 42]. Interestingly, the CCHFV OTU protease comprises a domain on the viral polymerase, and targeting it with a UbV may not only suppress viral pathogenicity but RNA replication as well, since it has been found that viral OTU DUB activity can suppress proteasome-dependent viral polymerase degradation [43]. Additionally, the strong binding of a UbV to the viral polymerase could cause steric hindrance and in this way affect polymerase function.\n\nWith current transgenic technologies [44], livestock and plant crops expressing virus-specific UbVs could be readily engineered to generate virus-resistant organisms. Significant progress has also been made towards the development of animal models of MERS-CoV infection ([45\u201349] and reviewed in [50]), which includes mouse models used in concert with mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strains, together mimicking MERS-CoV pathology observed in humans [51]. These technologies will provide attractive platforms to assess the efficacy of UbV delivery systems to treat MERS-CoV infection in vivo.\n\nThe utilization of the Ub scaffold as a template for vDUB inhibitor development exploits the large Ub-binding interface to provide a high degree of specificity in comparison to small molecule-based approaches, since the latter usually rely on targeting the active site of the viral protease, thereby invoking the risk of cross-reactivity with cellular proteases. The amino acid substitutions in UbVs that confer potent inhibition of vDUBs are distributed across relatively large binding interfaces, and we speculate that resistance to UbVs is less likely to develop in comparison to small-molecule inhibitors. The larger binding surface and the much tighter binding affinities of UbVs (low to sub-nanomolar, Fig 1C) compared to reported micromolar affinities for small-molecule inhibitors of MERS-CoV PLpro [52] imply that rather extensive mutations in the viral protease will be necessary to efficiently repel the UbV. Since development of resistance mutations requires virus replication, the extreme reduction in MERS-CoV progeny titers upon expression of UbVs during infection is therefore expected to severely delay occurrence of resistance. Additionally, if a resistant virus happens to be already present in the quasi species it is likely that mutations to repel the UbV from the vDUB will concomitantly lead to less optimal binding of the viral protease to Ub/ISG15 itself and maybe even the virus replicase polyproteins. Therefore, the resistant virus is expected to be attenuated and to have at least reduced deubiquitinating/deISGylating activity that is important for the virus\u2019 capacity to suppress host innate immune responses [9, 53]. This idea is supported by described escape mutants for MHV to a broad-spectrum CoV 3C-like protease inhibitor where the inhibitor-resistant virus was attenuated in mice, highlighting that the mutant was generated at the cost of replicative fitness [54] In future experiments we will experimentally assess the development of UbV resistance during infection in cell culture and mouse models, which will show whether our speculations are correct.\n\nUltimately, in the event that resistant strains do emerge in a clinical setting, new UbVs targeting these strains can also be generated rapidly. Most importantly, unlike small-molecule approaches that can take years to implement and often fail, phage display yields potent and selective viral inhibitors in weeks, a rate that could allow therapeutic development to keep pace with the continued emergence of pathogenic viruses and limit their pandemic potential. Together, these findings make further exploration of UbVs as potent and rapidly developed antiviral agents an exciting and promising venture.\n\nThe phage-displayed UbV library used in this study was re-amplified from Library 2 as previously described [25]. Protein immobilization and the following UbV selections were done according to established protocols [26, 55]. Briefly, purified viral proteases were coated on 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Scientific 12565135) by adding 100 \u03bcL of 1 \u03bcM proteins and incubating overnight at 4\u00b0C. Afterwards, five rounds of selections using the phage-displayed UbV library were performed against immobilized proteins including the following steps: (a) Each phage particle in the library pool displays a unique UbV and encapsulates the encoding DNA; (b) Binding phages are captured with an immobilized protein; (c) Non-binding phages are washed away; and (d) Bound phages are amplified by infection of bacteria. The enriched phage pool is cycled through additional rounds of selection to further enrich for protein-binding UbVs. After the fifth round of binding selections, individual phages with improved binding properties were identified by phage ELISA using established techniques and subjected to DNA sequencing of the phagemids to obtain UbV sequences [26, 55].\n\nTo form the non-covalent MERS-CoV PLpro-UbV complexes, a 4-fold molar excess of ME.4 or ME.2 was incubated with MERS-CoV PLpro overnight at 4\u00b0C. The excess, unbound UbVs were removed from the sample using a Superdex 75 size exclusion column and fractions containing the MERS-CoV PLpro-UbV complex were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/mL. The MERS-CoV PLpro-ME.4 complex was found to crystallize under similar conditions to those previously reported for the MERS-CoV PLpro-Ub complex [9], with optimal crystals appearing in 0.1 M trisodium citrate pH 5.6, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 and 20% (v/v) isopropanol. Crystals of the MERS-CoV PLpro-ME.2 complex were grown in 0.1 M trisodium citrate pH 5.6, 19% (w/v) PEG 4000 and 19% (v/v) 1,2-isopropanediol. Crystals were grown by mixing PLpro-UbV (10 mg/mL and 9 mg/mL for PLpro-ME.4 and PLpro-ME.2, respectively) with crystallization solution at a 1:1 volumetric ratio (2 \u03bcL MERS-CoV PLpro-UbV + 2 \u03bcL well solution). Immediately prior to mixing, 1 M DTT was added to the MERS-CoV PLpro-UbV complexes to a final concentration of 10 mM to prevent oxidation of the sample.\n\nPurified CCHFV OTU was pooled with 2-3-fold molar excess of purified UbV and dialyzed overnight against 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT. Protein complexes were concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 75 size exclusion column and eluted in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT. For all samples, a single peak corresponding to the respective complex was observed in the gel filtration profile and two bands corresponding to the CCHFV OTU and respective UbV were observed by SDS-PAGE, indicating the high purity of the complexes. The CCHFV OTU169-CC.2 complex was concentrated to 12 mg/ml for crystallization trials, and initial crystals and crystalline material obtained from preliminary screens were used to prepare seed stocks for microseed matrix screening [56, 57], which was set up for the hanging drop vapor diffusion method in 48-well VDX plates (Hampton Research) and carried out using conventional screens (Qiagen) at 4\u00b0C, with and without heterogeneous nucleation using 0.3\u20130.4 cm strands of human hair [58]. Total drop volume was 2 \u03bcl containing equal volumes of the protein complex and the well solution. Crystals of the CCHFV OTU169-CC.2 complex were grown in 30% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.2 M CaCl2 and 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5 and appeared after 5\u20138 days.\n\nThe CCHFV OTU185-CC.4 complex was concentrated to 23 mg/ml and initial leads were observed with a combinatorial approach using microseed matrix screening with crystallization screens (Qiagen) along with the Silver Bullets screen (Hampton Research) and micro-seeding using crystals of a CCHFV OTU185-CC.5 (a weaker binding variant selected by phage display) complex. Using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method and 48-well VDX trays (Hampton Research), screens were set up at 20\u00b0C with a reservoir volume of 150 \u03bcl, and a drop size of 3.5 \u03bcl, which comprised of 1.5 \u03bcl of the protein complex, 1 \u03bcl of the reservoir solution and 1 \u03bcl of Silver Bullet additive, added in this order. Crystals were obtained with 25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 M Tris pH 7.0 and 0.2 M sodium chloride. The Silver Bullet formulation in the drop was as follows: 0.16% (w/v) each of 5-Sulfosalicylic acid dehydrate, dodecanedioic acid, hippuric acid, mellitic acid, oxalacetic acid, suberic acid and 0.02 M HEPES sodium pH 6.8.\n\nData collection procedures are described in Supporting Information.\n\nTo produce lentiviruses, HEK293T cells (Virgin lab, Washington University School of Medicine) grown in a T175 flask were transfected with packaging vectors pMDLg/pRRE and pRSV-REV, envelope protein-expressing vector pCMV-VSVG [59] and the transfer vector (pLenti6.3/TO/V5-DEST containing GFP or FLAG-UbVs) using polyethylenimine (PEI; Polysciences Inc.). Medium was replaced 24 h post transfection and 48 h and 72 h post transfection supernatant was collected, centrifuged (1000 x g for 10 min) and filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter before storage at -80\u00b0C. Titers of the lentivirus particles were determined by p24 antigen ELISA (ZeptoMetrix). HuH-7 (Bartenschlager lab, Heidelberg University) and MRC5 cells (CCL-171; American Type Culture Collection) grown in a 12-well plate were transduced with lentiviruses encoding GFP or FLAG-ME.1 diluted in DMEM containing 2% FCS and 8 \u03bcg/ml Polybrene (Sigma Aldrich). Medium was replaced 24 h post transduction (pt), and 32 h or 48 h pt protein lysates were obtained by adding 250 \u03bcl 2xLSB containing 25 mM NEM to each well while cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS.\n\nGFP and FLAG-ME.1 expression were analyzed by Western blotting as described in the supporting information. Fixed cells that were grown on coverslips were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and subsequently indirect immunofluorescence assays were carried out. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 5% FCS and Hoechst 33258 was added to the secondary antibody dilution to stain nuclear DNA. Coverslips were analyzed with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 fluorescence microscope with an Axiocam HRc camera.\n\nTo obtain a cell population in which >90% of the cells expressed GFP, the amount of lentivirus yielding 120 ng of p24 was required to transduce 1x105 HuH-7 cells and 40 ng of p24 for 1x105 MRC5 cells was required. HuH-7 or MRC5 cells (1x105/12-well) were transduced with lentiviruses encoding GFP, FLAG-Ub.AA, FLAG-ME.1 or FLAG-ME.4. Cells were infected with MERS-CoV with a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 32 h or 48 h pt. MERS-CoV inocula were prepared in PBS containing 50 \u03bcg/ml DEAE-dextran and 2% FCS. Cells were inoculated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and the inoculum was replaced with EMEM containing 2% FCS. Supernatants were harvested 32 h post MERS-CoV infection and simultaneously cells were lysed in 4x LSB for Western blotting analysis. MERS-CoV titers were determined by plaque assays on Vero cells (Department of Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center) as described by van den Worm et al. [60]. MERS-CoV infection experiments were performed at least twice and plaque assays were performed in duplicate in order to determine MERS-CoV titers. Work with MERS-CoV was performed inside biosafety cabinets in Biosafety Level 3 facilities at Leiden University Medical Center.\n\nFull details of materials and methods are described in Supplemental files (S1 Appendix).\n\nCoordinate files and structure factors have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 5V6A and 5V69 for the MERS-CoV PLpro-ME.2 and\u2013ME.4 structures, respectively, and 5V5H and 5V5G for the CCHFV OTU-CC.2 and\u2013CC.4 structures, respectively."}
