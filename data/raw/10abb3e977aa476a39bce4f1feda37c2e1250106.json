The sequence of M. pusillus was not determined, as RT-PCR for the DPP4 mRNA 155 from bat cells was negative. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the bat DPP4 mRNA sequences 156 formed a distinct cluster being closely related to sequences from human and non-human MERS-CoV spike protein (64, 65). Upon multiple sequence alignment of the corresponding 160 regions that contain these critical residues, most of the residues are conserved in the six bat 161 DPP4 sequences in this study (Fig. 3B) The broader cellular tropism of MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E in bat 206 cells may reflect the host diversity of lineage C betacoronaviruses in bats.

SARSr-CoVs in bats were shown to 210 utilize the SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), for cell 211 entry (67). Similar to SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E is likely to have originated from bats. CoVs 212 closely related to HCoV-229E have been detected in bats of the genus Hipposideros in Africa 213 (68). More recently, CoVs even closer to HCoV-229E were identified in dromedary camels in 214 the Middle East, which were able to utilize the receptor of HCoV-229E, human aminopeptidase 215 N (hAPN) for cell entry (69). This suggests that dromedary camels may have served as 216 intermediate hosts for bat-to-human transmission of HCoV-229E, which may be analogous to 217 the evolution of MERS-CoV. Recently, a CoV, closely related to HCoV-NL63 in most genome 218 regions except the spike protein, was detected from a bat of the genus Triaenops in Kenya (70). 219 However, further studies are required to identify even closer relatives of HCoV-NL63 to 220 ascertain its possible bat origin. In contrast to SARSr-CoVs and HCoV-229E which were 221 mainly found in horseshoe and roundleaf bats respectively, a more diverse host range was 222 observed in lineage C betacoronaviruses. Yet, the different bat species harboring lineage C 223 betacoronaviruses all belonged to the family Vespertilionidae. Specifically, Ty-BatCoV HKU4, 224 including cells from Hipposideros. This may suggest a relatively narrow host range of SARS-231\n\nCoV and HCoV-229E in bats compared to lineage C betacoronaviruses including The close phylogenetic relationship between bat and primate DPP4 sequences may 233 reflect the replicative ability of MERS-CoV in bat cells. Moreover, cells that supported MERS-234\n\nCoV replication showed significantly higher DPP4 mRNA expression than those that were non-235 susceptible to MERS-CoV, suggesting that cellular DPP4 expression is critical for viral 236 infection. Since Ty-BatCoV HKU4 from T. pachypus was previously shown to be able to utilize 237 hDPP4 for cell entry (52, 53) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
