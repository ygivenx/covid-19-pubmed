{"title": "A time-of-drug addition approach to target identification of antiviral compounds", "body": "Shortly after the isolation of HIV, an intensive search for compounds that would inhibit infectivity and replication of this virus was initiated. A major breakthrough in this search was the establishment of a rapid and automated anti-HIV screening assay 1, 2 . The active development of new anti-HIV compounds continues, and many lead compounds still emerge from initial antiviral screens. Knowing the target of action of these new drugs is not only of extreme importance for swift progress in the development of novel anti-HIV strategies but is also essentially a prerequisite for their clinical development.\n\nThe in vitro tests most commonly used to determine the target of action of anti-HIV drugs are assays measuring the activity of the following viral enzymes: reverse transcriptase (RT) (polymerase and RNaseH activity) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , integrase 8, 9 and protease 10 . The advantage of these enzymatic assays in the test tube is that they are straightforward to perform, do not require any special safety infrastructure and produce clear interpretable results. However, if there are no previous indications of the presumed target of a new drug, it is difficult to know with which assay to start. In that case, viral resistance is selected against the inhibitor and the target of action is then needed to be determined by sequence analysis, which is time-consuming and cumbersome. Currently, many other test-tube assays have been described for measuring the distinct interactions (protein-protein, RNA-protein) that are essential for viral replication, and new assays are being developed 11,12 . However, on the basis of test-tube studies of mechanisms of action, several compounds have been mistakenly ascribed to inhibit a certain target that, upon further study in cell culture, appeared to inhibit an off-site target. For example, suramin was first found to be a very potent inhibitor of the retroviral reverse transcription process in the test tube and to block the in vitro infectivity and cytopathic effect of HIV 3, 13 . It was not only the first antiviral drug to be shown in vitro to block HIV infection but was also the first to be proven effective in suppressing HIV replication in HIVinfected patients 14 . Although suramin was originally pursued for its anti-HIV potential because of its RT-inhibitory capacity, it has since become clear that, in cell culture, suramin primarily targets the viral adsorption step 15 involving the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 (ref. 16) . Another example is the Tat inhibitor CGP64222 (ref. 17 ), shown to target viral entry in cell culture 18 . Yet another example is l-chicoric acid and its derivatives, which counteract HIV-1 integrase activity in vitro but in cell culture block virus entry 19, 20 . Therefore, tools to characterize the mechanism of action of virus inhibitors in cell culture are required to define their correct targets of action 21 .\n\nThere are several tests for studying the target of action of antiviral compounds in cell culture. For example, by comparing the activity of a compound on acutely 1 versus persistently or latently infected cells [22] [23] [24] , it can be easily determined whether an inhibitor targets a pre-or a postintegrational step of the viral replication cycle 25 . A drug blocking the production of a new virus from persistently infected cells presumably targets a postintegrational event because in the persistent infection system all preintegrational steps, such as virus binding, reverse transcription and integration, are omitted. Alternatively, for several steps in the HIV replication cycle (e.g., virus binding 26 , integration 21 , transcription 27 and viral budding 28 ), there exist specific tests in cells that can be performed to study the effect of a potential inhibitor of this target. For example, if one presumes that a newly discovered inhibitor interferes with virus binding, a virus-binding assay 26 can be performed. However, none of these assays combine all these properties in just one test that covers a full replication cycle.\n\n[1,4]-benzodiazepine-2-(1H)-one (TIBO) derivatives, later recognized as prototype of the NNRTIs (non-nucleoside RT inhibitors). Indeed, when an inhibitor that interferes with, for example, the viral RT enzyme, is present at the time when the reverse transcription process occurs within the viral replication cycle, it will be able to inhibit virus replication. In contrast, when this inhibitor is added once the reverse transcription is completed, the inhibitor will no longer be effective in blocking viral replication.\n\nTo replicate, HIV undergoes several major essential steps that occur in a well-established chronological order (see overview in Box 1 and ref. 30 for a review). A single round of HIV-1 replication takes ~24 h (Fig. 1) . Therefore, the standard protocol of a TOA experiment is based on the bulk infection of susceptible cells for 1 h; this is followed by removing the unbound virus and subsequent dispensing of the infected cells in a 96-well tissue culture plate and adding test compounds at 0, 1, 2, 3,\u2026, 24 h after virus infection. Further, the extent of virus replication is monitored at 31 h after infection. To synchronize the infection in all conditions, it is a prerequisite to wash out all unbound virus at 1 h after infection. The distinct steps of the procedure are detailed in Figure 2 . Key to the success of the experiment and to obtaining a maximal viral output that can be reliably measured is the use of: a highly susceptible cell line, e.g., the human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-transformed MT-4 cell line; a high multiplicity of infection (0.5-1); and an optimal harvest time. For HIV, the newly produced virus is harvested 31 h after infection (Fig. 1) to ensure that only one replication cycle has been completed.\n\nAs other viruses also undergo major processes of replication in a chronological order, this protocol can be adapted for the identification of the target of action of inhibitors of viruses other than HIV (e.g., coronaviruses) 31, 32 . In principle, this protocol is applicable to any virus/inhibitor combination, although in the absence of known inhibitors of the replication of the virus under study, it would be more challenging to interpret the data. However, for most viruses at least a few inhibitors with an established mode of action are known.\n\nThe advantage of this method is that a single experiment will give an indication of the possible target of interaction of an inhibitor and provide the basis for further investigations. The major limitation, however, is the availability of well-characterized inhibitors for the virus of interest. In principle, the more wellcharacterized inhibitors that exist for a certain virus, the more precisely a TOA experiment can reveal the target of action of a new inhibitor. A second limiting factor is that the result obtained from compounds with limited selectivity is not easily interpretable. Indeed, the use of compound concentrations of 10-to 100-fold their antiviral activity (half-maximum inhibitory concentration or IC 50 ) are most favorable in this experiment, and compounds with limited selectivity will often be toxic at these concentrations.\n\nExperimental design Compound concentration. The antiviral activity (IC 50 ) and toxicity (CC 50 ) of a compound should be determined before a TOA experiment is performed. The concentration of compound used in the TOA experiment is 100-fold its IC 50 , as established in an MT-4/MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay 1 . It should be confirmed that the compound is not toxic to the cells at this concentration; if so, a lower concentration should be used, although we recommend not to use a concentration lower than tenfold its IC 50 , as this could result in\n\nHIV replication involves several essential chronological steps (Fig. 3a) 30 . First, infectious virions bind to the cellular receptors on the surface of susceptible cells. Fusion of the viral envelope with the cellular membrane ensues, and the viral core penetrates into the cytoplasm. The single-stranded RNA genome of the virus is copied into a double-stranded linear DNA molecule by the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase. Next, the DNA is transported to the nucleus as a nucleic acid-protein complex (the preintegration complex) and is integrated into the host cell's genome by the action of a second viral enzyme, integrase. The covalently integrated form of viral DNA, which is defined as the provirus, serves as the template for transcription. The viral Tat protein stimulates transcription, and retroviral RNAs are synthesized, processed and then transported with the support of the viral protein Rev to the cytoplasm, where they are translated to produce the viral proteins. The proteins that form the viral core, encoded by the gag and pol genes, initially assemble into immature particles together with two copies of the full-length viral RNA. As these structures bud through the plasma membrane, they become enveloped by a lipid bilayer from the cell membrane that also harbors the viral Env glycoproteins in the form of trimers. Concomitantly with virus assembly and budding, the viral protease cleaves the Gag and Gag-Pol precursors to release the structural core proteins and pol enzymes in their final processed forms, resulting in a fully matured and infectious virus particle. an insufficient inhibition of viral replication. Moreover we recommend checking the solubility of the compound in aqueous medium at the intended concentration, as precipitation reduces the final concentration of the compound.\n\nVirus replication capacity. Not any cell line can be used in this protocol. It is important to use a highly susceptible cell line in combination with a highly replicative virus to ensure that replication can be accurately measured 31 h after infection (in the case of HIV). A pretest should be carried out to ensure that sufficiently high virus production is measured after 31 h of infection ( Fig. 1) . For other viruses, the time required for one replication round should first be determined in order to assign a suitable detection window. In addition, the amount of inoculum required should be optimized to ensure that sufficient virus is released into the supernatant at the time of harvest.\n\nControls. If available, always include sufficient control/reference compounds that are well established in their target of interaction.\n\nDetection of viral replication. The virus replication can be monitored in different ways. For HIV, usually the virus-associated p24 antigen in the supernatant of infected cells is quantified by ELISA (commercially available through different suppliers). Other methods such as virus-associated RT activity (assay kits are available through different suppliers) or quantitative RT-PCR 33 can be used as alternatives. \n\nThe overview given below is based on a detailed protocol described in reference 1. 3G) . Mix, change tips and repeat to transfer solution from column 3 to column 4, and similarly for each column up to column 10. Discard 25 \u00b5l from column 10 so that in every well the volume is 100 \u00b5l. Do not add virus to column 11, as this will be used as uninfected control. 4. Dispense 100 \u00b5l of a 3 \u00d7 10 5 cells per ml MT-4 cell suspension into the microplate wells (wells 2B to 11G) and incubate the plate in a humidified atmosphere at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2 in air for 5 d. 13| Mix the bulk suspension again and add 200 \u00b5l to each remaining well in the 96-well plate that will be used for the experiment. Place the plate at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in air, and store the compound solutions in the dark at room temperature. 15| At 31 h after infection, microscopically score the plate for cytotoxicity by visually monitoring the cell morphology and/or for eventual crystallization/precipitation of the compounds in solution. Next, take 110 \u00b5l supernatant from each well, inactivate by adding 12 \u00b5l Triton X-100 (5%) and store at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until you can quantify the virus-associated p24 core antigen by ELISA. \ue06a pause poInt The samples may be stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C (for up to 6 months) without affecting the results.\n\n16| Quantify the virus-associated p24 core antigen in the supernatant by ELISA; we use a commercially available kit from PerkinElmer and follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n17| Plot the amount of p24 (pg ml \u2212 1 ) versus time points (see Fig. 3, panel b) .\n\n? trouBlesHootInG ? trouBlesHootInG Troubleshooting advice can be found in table 1. 35 , AMD3100 (targeting the CXCR4 coreceptor binding) 36 , NV038 (an NCp7 inhibitor) 37 , AZT (an NRTI) 38 , nevirapine (an NNRTI) 39 , L-708,906 (a strand transfer integrase inhibitor) 40 , WP7-5 (a transcription inhibitor) 24, 41 and ritonavir (a protease inhibitor) 42 .

For example, the RT inhibitor AZT is able to inhibit the replication of HIV-1 when it is present within the first 3 h of infection (Fig. 3b) ; on the contrary, when it is added at 4 h after infection or later, it is unable to inhibit the viral replication because its target of action (the reverse transcription process) has already occurred and the target is no longer of importance for the further replication of the virus in a single round of infection. It should be pointed out that it is imperative to include control drugs with a known and well-characterized target of action in each experiment. When a drug with an unknown target of action shows a similar profile to the established anti-HIV agent, it strongly suggests that this drug targets the same process or at least targets one that is operative at the same time. Most notably, using this assay makes it possible to discriminate between an RT inhibitor of the nucleoside RT inhibitor type (NRTI) versus NNRTI type (Fig. 3) . Indeed, we have consistently observed in all experiments that NRTIs (2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxynucleoside (ddN) analogs) lose their antiviral activity exactly 1 h before that of any NNRTI. This is most likely because of the fact that ddN analogs need to undergo phosphorylation by cellular enzymes before becoming active, as chain terminators, in the RT reaction. One should keep in mind that for drugs with a dual target of action, i.e., one molecule targeting two distinct steps within the replication cycle, always the last occurring target in the viral replication will be revealed by this experiment, as this is the last step at which replication can be blocked by the inhibitor. To illustrate this point, several combinations of two wellknown HIV inhibitors were combined in one experiment (Fig. 4) . In the case of dextran sulfate (an inhibitor of viral entry) combined with AZT (an RT inhibitor), the TOA assay only reveals reverse transcription as a target for this combination. For AZT combined with L-870,810 (an integrase inhibitor), only the integrase is revealed as a target. A special example of drugs with a dual mechanism of action are polysulfonate dendrimers, which at low concentrations in cell culture inhibit the viral adsorption but when added at higher concentrations also target a process coinciding with the viral reverse transcription (Fig. 5) 34 . This can be explained by both the extent of cellular uptake of the drug(s) at different concentrations and their differential potency against different processes. Therefore, in a TOA experiment, it is advised to test compounds at different concentrations.\n\nIt is possible that a compound will not completely block HIV replication. In many cases this is because of the compound being present at too low a concentration to completely inhibit the virus replication or having too low an intrinsic potency. In the first case, this can be remedied by increasing the concentration of the compound, but cytotoxicity and solubility in aqueous medium of the compound will be limiting factors. We have noticed that there are compounds that are able to inhibit the viral replication and generate an IC 50 value in the replication assay but that do not reach a complete (100%) block of viral replication because of a lack of intrinsic potency. Even when no complete inhibition of viral replication can be established with a certain compound, a satisfactory and reliable result could be obtained in this TOA assay. In this case, one can expect to see a residual amount of p24 at time points occurring before the target of the compound that is not zero (only reached when there is a 100% block of viral replication) but lower than in the control without the compound. It is also possible that sometimes a slight slope in loss of activity will be observed instead of a clear jump. This can be because of toxicity of the compound or because the compound is targeting a step in the viral replication that involves an iterative process that takes place for several hours. Many variations of the TOA experiment can be envisaged, e.g., a so-called negative TOA experiment can be performed for drugs that need time to be processed by the host cell to become active in the cells. In such an experiment, the compound is added at different time points before the virus infection takes place. A similar approach can be used when the mechanism of action of a compound is based on the down-or upregulation of a cellular co-factor involved in viral replication. In addition, shorter time periods between compound addition (15 or 30 min) can be used instead of the 1-h interval. Figure 5 | Result obtained with a polyanionic dendrimer targeting two steps in the viral replication depending on the concentration tested. At low concentrations, the BRI2923 blocks virus entry, whereas at higher concentrations, it also targets the viral reverse transcription process. Dextran sulfate and AZT were included as reference compounds for virus entry and reverse transcription.\n\nacknowleDGMents We thank K. Erven, C. Heens and L.
