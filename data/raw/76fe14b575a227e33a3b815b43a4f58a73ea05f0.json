{"title": "Bovine Respiratory Coronavirus", "body": "Bovine coronaviruses (BCoV) cause respiratory and enteric infections in cattle and wild ruminants [1] [2] [3] . They belong to the Coronaviridae family in the Nidovirales order and are members of subgroup 2a along with swine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), canine respiratory CoV (CRCoV) and human CoV OC43 and HKU1. HEV, which causes wasting disease is an exception [4] , the others cause enteric and/or respiratory disease. Recently discovered SARS-CoVs that are associated with both respiratory and enteric infections in humans and animals (civet cats, raccoon dogs, bats) belong to a new CoV subgroup 2b [1, 5] .\n\nBovine CoV is a pneumoenteric virus that infects the upper and lower respiratory tract and intestine. It is shed in both feces and nasal secretions and also infects the lung. The BCoV is involved in the etiology of 3 distinct clinical syndromes in cattle: calf diarrhea (CD) [1, 2] ; winter dysentery (WD) with hemorrhagic diarrhea in adults [3, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] ; and respiratory infections in cattle of various ages including the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) or shipping fever of feedlot cattle [2, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . All BCoV isolates examined to date, regardless of clinical origin, belong to a single serotype based on virus cross-neutralization tests [8, 14] . Although 2-3 subtypes of BCoV are recognized as determined by biologic properties and antigenic variation identified by neutralization tests or using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), each encompasses viruses from all 3 clinical syndromes [2, 3, 8, 14, 15] . Despite genetic differences (point mutations but not deletions) detected in the S gene between enteric and respiratory isolates, including ones from the same animal [26] [27] [28] , in vivo challenge revealed a high level of cross-protection between such isolates [29, 30] . No consistent antigenic or genetic markers have been identified to discriminate BCoVs from the different clinical syndromes. Reviews describing the role of BCoV in calf diarrhea and winter dysentery are available [1, 3, 7] . The focus of this review is on respiratory BCoV infections including viral characteristics, epidemiology and interspecies transmission, diagnosis, pathogenesis and clinical signs, and immunity and vaccines.\n\nThe BCoV is enveloped and pleiomorphic in shape, ranging from 65-210 nm in diameter, and covered with a double layer of short (hemagglutinin) and long (spike) surface projections [2] . Like other enveloped viruses, BCoV is sensitive to detergents and lipid solvents (ether, chloroform, etc) and is also inactivated by conventional disinfectants, formalin and heat. The large genome consists of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of 27-32 Kb encoding 5 major structural proteins. Among these, the 50 kDa nucleocapsid (N) is highly conserved among strains, so it is often the target for viral RNA detection assays [29] . Unique to some group 2 CoVs including BCoV and wild ruminant CoVs, is the presence of a surface hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein (120-140 kDa). The HE acts as a receptor destroying enzyme (esterase) to reverse hemagglutination. Like other CoVs, BCoV also possesses an outer surface spike (S) glycoprotein (190 kDa). It consists of an S1 subunit that contains the dominant neutralizing epitopes and S2 that mediates viral membrane fusion. The HE and S are important viral proteins that are involved in attachment to host cell receptors and hemagglutination of chicken, rat, mouse and hamster erythrocytes. MAbs to the HE or S protein prevented BCoV-induced villous atrophy in vivo in intestinal loops of calves, confirming their dual role in vivo protection [31] . Both elicit neutralizing antibodies that can block viral attachment and infectivity, so they are important for immunity and vaccines.\n\nVariation in tissue tropism and host range among CoVs is attributed mainly to changes in the S protein. Researchers sequenced the partial or full length S gene of multiple BCoV strains to ascertain the genetic basis for the broad host range of BCoV (see Epidemiology section) and occurrence of the distinct clinical syndromes. Several groups have compared the S (or S1) or full length genomic sequences [22, [26] [27] [28] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] of WD or respiratory and enteric BCoV isolates, including isolates from the same animal. The porcine respiratory CoV evolved as an S gene deletion mutant (deletions of 621-681 nuceotides) of swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, acquiring an almost exclusive respiratory tropism [37] . No similar large S gene deletions were detected in respiratory BCoV strains, most of which also possess an enteric tropism as revealed by calf challenge studies [29] . Focusing on the hypervariable region [amino acids (aa) 452-593] containing the neutralizing epitope (S1B) of the S1 subunit, 4 groups [22, 26, 27, 36] reported that respiratory strains (or respiratory and enteric isolates from the same feedlot calf) had changes in aa residues 510 and 531 compared to the reference enteric Mebus and a WD strain (DBA). One of the polymorphic positions (aa531) discriminated between enteric (aspartic acid, D or asparagine, N) and respiratory (glycine, G) BCoV strains in two studies [26, 36] , but not in others [27, 28, 34] . Therefore, like the antigenic and biological differences observed among BCoV isolates, variability was not necessarily related to the clinical origin of the isolates [14, 15] . BCoV, like other RNA viruses represents a quasispecies or swarm of viruses [38] , some viruses within a population may be more suitable for replication in respiratory versus intestinal sites, contributing to the sequence differences reported for paired enteric/respiratory isolates from the same host [28] . Zhang et al [28] noted that in the process of cell culture adaptation, an enteric BCoV strain accumulated mutations to resemble the corresponding respiratory BCoV isolate from the same animal. Consequently interpretation of the comparative sequence analysis of enteric and respiratory strains of BCoV may be compromised by lack of complete genome sequences and the laboratory manipulation of field strains (multiple cell culture passage and plaque isolations) prior to sequencing.\n\nAll investigators showed that the greatest aa sequence divergence (42 aa changes at 38 distinct sites [27] and the most differences by phylogenetic analysis were between the historic (1972) reference Mebus enteric BCoV and more recent BCoV isolates, regardless of clinical origin. This demonstrates that BCoVs, like other RNA viruses, are evolving in the field, with recent isolates more similar to contemporary strains than to historic strains. If the genetic divergence affects neutralizing or other key epitopes allowing virus to escape existing immunity [36] , then vaccines containing more contemporary or broadly crossreactive BCoV strains may be required to enhance the efficacy of existing or newly developed BCoV vaccines. Notably sequential sera from cattle undergoing respiratory BCoV infections associated with BRDC pneumonia reacted with higher neutralizing and HI titers to a more contemporary respiratory lung isolate (97TXSF-Lu15-2) than to much older historic enteric BCoV strains, including a derivative of the high cell culture-passaged Mebus 1972 strain (L9-81) and an older wild type strain (LY138-3) [39] . However in a prior report from the same lab [35] , an earlier isolate of a respiratory BCoV strain (BRCV G95) was more similar to the enteric LY 138 strain than to the older Mebus strain L9-81 based on Sspecific MAb reactivity. These data concur with the greater phylogenetic and antigenic divergence decribed between the Mebus cell culture passaged strain in comparison with the more recent enteric and respiratory BCoV isolates [14, 15, 28, 40] . In the studies by Lin et al [39] , it is likely that the antigenic variation observed reflects the time frame differences, independently of the enteric versus respiratory origin of the isolates. Repeating these immunologic assays using more recent enteric BCoV strains is necessary to clarify this issue.\n\nBovine CoV is ubiquitous in cattle worldwide based on BCoV antibody seroprevalence data [2, 3, 7] . Respiratory BCoV is associated with mild respiratory disease (coughing, rhinitis) or pneumonia in 2-6-mo-old calves. It is detected in nasal secretions, lung and often intestine as well as feces (Table 1) [2, 3, 16, 24, [41] [42] [43] [44] . Four respiratory disease outbreaks associated with BCoV infection, but without concurrent detection of other common respiratory viruses, bacteria and mycoplasms were investigated in dairy and beef cattle in Italy [41] . In 3 of 4 outbreaks classical signs of bovine respiratory disease (dyspnea, fever, respiratory distress) were evident in 2-3-month-old calves and BCoV was detected by qRT-PCR in nasal samples. In 2 of 4 oubreaks both respiratory and enteric disease was present: BCoV was detected simultaneously in nasal and fecal specimens. In one of these latter 2 herds, clinical signs were present in calves, heifers and lactating dairy cattle. In the second, concurrent infection with a group A bovine rotavirus was detected. Researchers also detected ocular shedding of BCoV in lower titers in one of the herds, suggesting ocular swabs could be another diagnostic specimen for detection of BCoV.\n\nBCoV was isolated in HRT-18 cells from nasal swabs of calves from 3 of the 4 outbreaks. BCoV seroprevalence studies in 135 Norwegian dairy herds indicated that calves (>150 days of age) in herds with BCoV-seropositive calves had an increased risk [hazard ratio = 3.9] of respiratory disease compared to herds with BCoV seronegative calves [45] . In studies of dairy calves in Ohio from birth to 20 weeks of age, Heckert et al [16, 24] documented both fecal and nasal shedding of respiratory BCoV, but with diarrhea prominent in the initial infection. Subsequently repeated or intermittent nasal shedding episodes occurred in the same animal, with or without respiratory disease, but with transient increases in serum antibody titers consistent with reinfection. These findings suggest a lack of long-term mucosal immunity in the upper respiratory tract after natural respiratory BCoV infection, confirming similar observations for human [46] and porcine respiratory CoV infections [47] .\n\nWithin a herd, reservoirs for respiratory BCoV infection may be virus cycling in clinically or subclinically infected calves, young adult cattle in which sporadic nasal shedding occurs [16, 24] or clinically or subclinically infected adults [3, 48] . Respiratory BCoV is transmitted via both fecal-oral and potentially respiratory (aerosol) routes.\n\nRespiratory BCoV has been increasingly implicated since 1995 in the BRDC associated with respiratory disease and reduced growth performance in feedlot cattle (Table 1) [13, 17-21, 23, 25] . Respiratory BCoV was detected from nasal secretions and lungs of cattle with pneumonia and/or from feces [15, 17-21, 23, 25] . In a follow-up study, a high percentage of feedlot cattle (45%) shed BCoV both nasally and in feces as determined by ELISA [13] . Application of nested RT-PCR detected higher respiratory BCoV nasal and fecal shedding rates of 84% and 96%, respectively [23] . Storz et al [20] reported that 25 of 26 Texas feedlot cattle that died had a respiratory BCoV infection. Both respiratory BCoV and Pasteurella sp were isolated from lungs of the cattle with necrotizing pneumonia.\n\nSome investigators have shown an association between nasal shedding of respiratory BCoV and respiratory disease. In a large feedlot study (n=1074 cattle), Lathrop, et al [17] noted that feedlot calves shedding respiratory BCoV nasally and seroconverting to respiratory BCoV (>4-fold) were 1.6 times more likely to have respiratory disease and 2.2 times more likely to have pulmonary lesions at slaughter than animals that did not shed respiratory BCoV. Similarly, in studies by Hasoksuz et al [23] , and Thomas et al [25] , calves shedding respiratory BCoV nasally were 2.7 and 1.5 times, respectively, more likely to have respiratory disease than calves that were not shedding. Nasal shedding of respiratory BCoV or antibody titer <20 increased the risk of requiring treatment for respiratory disease in another report, [49] . Intranasal vaccination of such calves using a commercial modified live BCoV calf vaccine on entry to a feedlot reduced the risk of treatment for BRDC in the latter study.\n\nBoth respiratory and enteric shedding of respiratory BCoV are common in feedlot cattle with peak shedding at 0-4 days post-arrival at feedlots. In one study, 3 day pre-arrival specimens were tested, nasal shedding consistently preceded fecal shedding [25] . Many cattle (61-74%) shed respiratory BCoV at the buyer-order? Order-buyer, perhaps? prior to shipping to feedlots [21] . A high percentage (91-95%) of feedlot cattle seroconverted (2-4fold increased titers) to respiratory BCoV by 3 wks post-arrival.\n\nAn important observation from several studies was that cattle arriving with relatively high respiratory BCoV antibody ELISA titers or neutralizing antibodies in serum were less likely to shed respiratory BCoV, seroconvert or develop BRDC [13, 18, 25, 50, 51] . Furthermore some investigators have shown that respiratory BCoV infections had a negative impact on weight gains in feedlot cattle [13, 23] , which suggests that respiratory BCoV may have an impact on herd health and performance. Conversely, higher serum antibody titers against respiratory BCoV have been associated with increased weight gains [25, 50] .\n\nWe and others have previously identified possible wildlife reservoirs for BCoV. Captive wild ruminants from the US including Sambar deer (Cervus unicolor), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), elk (Cervus elephus) and more recently giraffe [52] harbor CoVs biologically, genetically and antigenically (crossneutralizing) closely related to BCoV [53, 54] . Bovine-like CoVs have also been identified in water buffalo calves [55] and in alpacas [56] . Deer and waterbuck isolates were from animals with bloody diarrhea resembling WD in cattle. Serologically, 6.6% and 8.7% of sera from white tailed deer in Ohio and mule deer in Wyoming, respectively, were seropositive for antibodies to BCoV by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) tests [54] . Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) were also BCoV seropositive [57] . These studies confirm the circulation of CoVs that are antigenically closely related to BCoV in captive and native wild ruminants.\n\nSeveral CoVs from wild ruminants have recently been fully sequenced to assess their genetic similarity to BCoV [40, 52] . The antigenically related giraffe, sambar and whitetailed deer, waterbuck and sable antelope CoVs share high (99.3-99.6%) amino acid sequence identity with enteric and respiratory BCoV strains, supporting their close genetic relatedness. Wild ruminant CoV isolates from Sambar and white-tailed deer and waterbuck also infected the upper respiratory and intestinal tracts of gnotobiotic calves and caused diarrhea [54] affirming experimentally that wild ruminants may serve as a reservoir for CoV strains transmissible to calves. The possibility exists that native wild ruminants may transmit bovine-like CoVs to cattle (see below) or vice versa. Few serologic surveys of wild ruminants in native habitats have been done. A particular concern is that such interspecies infections may culminate in more genetically divergent BCoV strains including recombinant, increasing the possiblity for their tranmission to other species. Analysis of CoV genomic sequence data has revealed that porcine HEV and human respiratory CoV OC-43 represent CoVs that likely evolved from ancestral BCoV strains. [58] .\n\nMany CoVs have restricted host ranges, some such as the BCoV and more recently the SARS-CoV appear to be promiscuous [5, 59] . Coronaviruses genetically (>95% nucleotide identity) and/or antigenically similar to BCoV have been detected from respiratory samples of dogs with respiratory disease [60] and also from humans [61] and wild ruminants (see above). A human enteric CoV isolate from a child with acute diarrhea (HECoV-4408) was genetically (99% nt identity in the S and HE gene with BCoV) and antigenically closely related to BCoV suggesting that it is a BCoV variant able to infect humans. A recent report confirmed that the HECoV-4408 strain infects (upper respiratory tract and intestine) and causes diarrhea and intestinal lesions in gnotobiotic calves. This strain induced complete cross-protective immunity against the virulent BCoV-DB2 enteric strain. An enteric BCoV also experimentally infected dogs, causing subclinical infection and seroconversion [62] . Furthermore the virulent BCoV-DB2 enteric strain caused mild disease (diarrhea) in phylogenetically diverse species such as avian hosts, including baby turkeys, but not baby chicks [63] . These data raise intriguing questions of whether dogs or wild birds (such as wild turkeys) could also be a reservoir for bovine-like CoVs transmissible to cattle or wild ruminants, or conversely, if cattle (or ruminants) can transmit CoVs to dogs, wild birds or poultry. There are few if any seroprevalence surveys for bovine-like CoVs in avian species and only limited data for wild ruminants [54, 57] . The reasons for the broad host range of BCoV are unknown but may relate to the presence of a hemagglutinin on BCoV and its possible role in binding to diverse cell types. Experimental evidence for interspecies transmission of bovine-like CoVs between wild ruminants, dogs, birds and cattle is of concern for open feedlots where wild birds may congregate or cattle may be exposed to dogs, wild ruminants or their feces.\n\nBCoV commonly infects the upper respiratory and the intestinal tract with shedding detected in nasal secretions and/or feces [13, 23, 43, 64] . BCoV has also been detected [how? FA, IHC, ELISA, PCR? ]or isolated from lung in respiratory disease cases,.\n\n[reference] Uncomplicated BCoV infections are characterized as acute infections with a short duration of virus shedding ( Table 1 ). The sensitivity of the assay used to detect BCoV shedding influences both the detection rates and the length of time the virus is detected. Generally nucleic acid detection assays are among the most sensitive (RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR, real time quantitative (q) RT-PCR) barring interference by inhibitors common in fecal samples.\n\nThe acute transient nature of BCoV infections necessitates sample collection at disease onset or shortly thereafter (Table 1) . For BRDC-associated infection, the peak of BCoV nasal (or fecal) shedding is often upon entry into the feedlot or within the first week of arrival [13, 21, 23, 25] . This pattern of BCoV shedding is likely attributable to the stress of shipping and the transmission of new BCoV strains among mixed source, co-mingled calves from auction barns [21, 25] . For BRDC cases, differential diagnosis is needed because multiple respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens contribute to this syndrome and the ensuing fatalities.\n\nTo diagnose BCoV from suspect necropsied respiratory (or enteric) disease cases, samples to submit include tissues from the upper respiratory tract (nasal, pharyngeal tissues, trachea) and lung [14, 20, 21] and as available, tissues from the distal small intestine and colon [64] . For live animals, ideally both nasal secretions collected using sterile polyester-tipped swabs (one per nostril) and feces collected into sterile fecal cups (via anal stimulation using sterile gloves), should be transported on ice to the diagnostic lab [13, 15] . Also tracheobronchial lavage fluids can be aspirated from live calves with acute respiratory disease. In at least one study, they were positive for BCoV antigen by ELISA [65] .\n\nBCoV infections can be diagnosed by detection of virus, viral antigen or viral RNA in tissues, secretions or excretions of infected animals. Comprehensive methods used by our lab for the isolation and detection of BCoV from nasal secretions, lung homogenates or feces or titration of BCoV serum or neutralizing antibodies have recently been published [66] and will not be reiterated in detail. They include procedures for primary virus isolation, propagation and plaque induction in our cloned line of human rectal tumor (HRT)-18 cell cultures [15, 20, 21, 23] . This cell line is used most successfully and almost universally for isolation of both respiratory and enteric BCoV strains and bovine-like CoVs from wild ruminants and dogs. Some BCoV field strains fail to grow in cell culture, so sensitivity for BCoV detection may be low.\n\nFor viral antigen detection in respiratory (trachea, lung) or intestinal (ileum, colon) tissues (frozen or paraffin-embedded), immunofluorescent or immunohistochemical straining is performed using hyperimmune antiserum or MAbs to BCoV. Detection of BCoV in nasal secretions or feces is accomplished by immune electron microscopy (IEM) which has the advantage of detecting other viruses, but sensitivity is relatively low [16, 54] . Bovine CoV antigens are most commonly detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using MAbs to improve assay specificity and sensitivity. Advantages include rapid test results and applicability to large sample numbers. Highly sensitive molecular assays to detect BCoV RNA in nasal secretions, lung lysates or feces are becoming more widely used. They include RT-PCR and the more sensitive nested RT-PCR and real time qPCR assays [29, 67] . Ideally these assays should target conserved regions of the BCoV genome (polymerase or N protein) to detect divergent strains, and especially for feces, controls are needed to detect interference by PCR inhibitors that need to be eliminated or diluted out for assay validity.\n\nAntibodies to BCoV can be quantitated by virus neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests that measure functional neutralizing or hemagglutinating antibodies, respectively that often correlate with immunity [14, 51] . Also ELISAs are used to quantitate overall or isotype-specific antibodies (IgM, IgA, IgG1, IgG2) in serum, nasal secretions or feces, because certain isotypes (ie. IgA, IgG1, IgG2) may be better correlated with mucosal immunity or neutralizing or HI antibodies [16, 24, 51, 68, 69] . Because BCoV antibodies are widespread in cattle, paired acute and convalescent serum samples are needed for serologic diagnosis of BCoV infections.\n\nResearch on respiratory and enteric BCoV infections of cattle have provided important information on BCoV disease pathogenesis, possible potentiators for increased disease severity and vaccine strategies. Enteric BCoV infections are generally most severe in calves. Respiratory BCoV infections in adults, are more severe or even fatal when combined with other factors including stress and transport of animals (shipping fever of cattle) that increase corticosteroid levels, high virus exposure doses, aerosols, and co-infections with other respiratory pathogens (viruses, bacteria, bacterial lipolysaccharides). Such variables, by accentuating viral shedding or increasing titers shed may also contribute to virus transmission.\n\nBesides causing diarrhea in young calves (1-3 weeks of age) and cows with WD, BCoV is implicated as a cause of mild respiratory disease (coughing, rhinitis) or pneumonia in 2-6mo-old calves [16, 24, [42] [43] [44] . Clinical signs include coughing, fever, rhinitis and inappetence, often with concurrent diarrhea. BCoV has been isolated from nasal and pharyngeal swabs and lung wash of sick calves. Experimental calf challenge studies using calf respiratory BCoV isolates confirmed both fecal and nasal shedding (averaging 5 days) and diarrhea, but only variable mild respiratory disease [42, 43] . i, BCoV respiratory infections in the field are likely exacerbated by stress or respiratory co-infections that may include the common bovine respiratory viruses, bacteria and mycoplasma sp.\n\nIn two experimental studies of WD in BCoV seronegative or seropositive dairy cows (107,110), fecal shedding of BCoV was coincident with or preceded diarrhea and persisted for 1-4 days. No respiratory disease or fever was evident in the BCoV seropositive cows, but nasal shedding of BCoV was detected in 1 of 5 cows [6] . BCoV seronegative cows directly exposed to calves experimentally infected with a WD strain of BCoV developed transient fevers, mild cough and serous mucopurulent discharge [10] . These data are consistent with field outbreak reports indicating variable signs of respiratory disease in cattle with WD [7, 9] . WD isolates of BCoV are antigenically closely related to calf enteric and respiratory isolates, but the various strains, regardless of clinical origin, elicited cross protection against one another in calf challenge studies [12, 29, 30] .\n\nA plausible scenario for the pathogenesis of BCoV and its transit to the intestine has been proposed based on the time course of BCoV nasal and fecal shedding in natural and experimental BCoV infections [16, 25, 64] . Following initial and extensive replication in the nasal mucosa, BCoV may spread to the gastrointestinal tract after the swallowing of large quantities of virus coated in mucous secretions. This initial respiratory amplification of BCoV and its protective coating by mucus may allow larger amounts of this labile, enveloped, but infectious, virus to transit to the gut after swallowing, resulting in intestinal infection and fecal shedding.\n\nThe BRDC of feedlot calves is characterized by fever, dyspnea, inflammatory and necrotizing lung lesions leading to bronchopneumonia, weight loss and death. It is most pronounced during the first weeks after arrival at feedlots. This overlaps with a high prevalence of respiratory viral and secondary bacterial co-infections and various environmental or host stress factors during this period. A growing number of reports in the past decade have provided epidemiological or experimental evidence suggesting that BCoV respiratory infection contributes substantially to the BRDC. Multiple previous studies (see Epidemiology section) have documented both nasal and fecal shedding of BCoV by calves shortly after arrival in feedlots and subsequent seroconversion to BCoV (Table 1 ). Storz et al [19] showed a progression in development of the BRDC for natural cases, initiated by BCoV respiratory infection (nasal shedding) upon arrival followed by dual infections with BCoV and respiratory bacteria (Mannheimia hemolytica and Pasteurella multocida). This led to pneumonia and deaths in 26 cases, most of which had concurrent high titers of BCoV and bacteria in the lungs. The cattle died within 5-36 days after the disease onset. Clinical signs included high fevers and severe respiratory distress. Gross lung lesions consisting of subacute exudative and necrotizing lobar pneumonia involving 50-80% of the lung volume. Histologic lung lesions were characterized as fibrinous, necrotizing lobar pneumonia, but with moderate to severe bronchitis and bronchiolitis. The authors concluded that these data supported a role for BCoV in the BRDC as defined by Evan's criteria for causation. In this and another study [20] , researchers confirmed the presence of BCoV antigen in respiratory epithelial cells or isolated BCoV from nasal secretions, trachea, bronchi or lung aveoli and documented the presence of interstitial emphysema, bronchiolitis and aveolitis in concert with bacterial infection (Table 1) . Although BRDC is recognized as a multi-factoral disease, this evidence supports a role for BCoV in inciting the disease. Multifactorial/multiagent experiments describing interactions between respiratory viruses, bacteria and stress have highlighted their synergistic effects in the BRDC [70] , but no such experiments have been reported for BCoV. Such studies of feedlot age, BCoV seronegative, stressed calves are needed to further elucidate the role of BCoV in the BRDC and the mechanisms involved in predisposing calves to development of fatal pneumonia.\n\nUnderlying disease or respiratory coinfections, dose and route of infection and immunosuppression (corticosteroids) are all potential cofactors that can exacerbate the severity of BCoV infections and enhance virus transmission or host susceptibility. The BRDC (shipping fever) is recognized as a multifactorial, polymicrobial respiratory disease complex in young adult feedlot cattle with several factors exacerbating respiratory disease, including BCoV infections [13, 17-21, 23, 25, 49] . The BRDC can be precipitated by several viruses, alone or in combination (BCoV, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza-3 virus, bovine herpesvirus) and viruses capable of mediating immunosuppression (bovine viral diarrhea virus, etc). The shipping of cattle long distances to feedlots and the co-mingling of cattle from multiple farms creates physical stresses that overwhelm the animal's defense mechanisms and provide close contact for exposure to high concentrations of new pathogens or strains not previously encountered. For the BRDC, various predisposing factors (viruses, stress) allow commensal bacteria of the nasal cavity (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella sp, Mycoplasma sp, etc) to infect the lungs leading to a fatal fibrinous pneumonia [17, [19] [20] [21] .\n\nIt is also possible that antibiotic treatment of animals co-infected with BCoVs and bacteria, with massive release of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), could precipitate induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may further enhance lung damage. Van Reeth et al [71] showed that pigs infected with porcine respiratory CoV followed by a subclinical dose of E. coli LPS within 24 hr developed enhanced fever and more severe respiratory disease compared to each agent alone. They concluded that the effects were likely mediated by the significantly enhanced levels of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the bacterial LPS in synergy with the CoV infection. Thus there is a need to examine both LPS and lung cytokine levels in BCoV-infected feedlot cattle as possible mediators of the severity of BRDC.\n\nCorticosteroids induce immunosuppression and reduce the numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells and certain cytokine levels [72] [73] [74] . A recrudescence of BCoV fecal shedding was observed in 1 of 4 WD BCoV-infected cows treated with dexamethasone [6] . Similarly treatment of weaned pigs with dexamethasone prior to porcine respiratory CoV inoculation led to increased disease severity and reduced T cell immune responses in the treated pigs [73, 74] .\n\nAn understanding of the pathogenesis of respiratory BCoV infections including the target organs infected and how virus is disseminated to these organs should assist in development of vaccine strategies. The realization that BCoV infects epithelial cells lining the respiratory and/or intestinal tracts may necessitate development of vaccines effective at both sites of infection to provide optimal protection. In addition vaccines for mucosal pathogens may fail to induce sterilizing immunity or to prevent respiratory reinfections, as observed for natural or experimental respiratory BCoV infections [16, 29] . Consequently, the major vaccine focus should be to prevent the severe disease requiring treatments and the weight loss/ reduced gain in the infected animals. This may be best accomplished by vaccinating calves on farm prior to shipping to auction barns or feedlots. This is because BCoV infections occur at the auction barn or shortly after arrival at feedlots necessitating rapid onset of immunity.\n\nIn spite of its economic impact, no respiratory BCoV vaccines have been developed to prevent BCoV-associated pneumonia in young calves or in the BRDC of feedlot cattle. The correlates of immunity to respiratory BCoV infections remain undefined. Limited data from epidemiologic studies of BCoV infections in cattle suggest that serum antibody titers to BCoV may be a marker for respiratory protection. In multiple studies the BCoV antibody isotype (IgG 1 , IgG 2 , IgA), neutralizing and HI antibody titer and magnitude of antibody titer in serum of naturally-infected calves or in cattle on arrival in feedlots were correlated with protection against respiratory disease, pneumonia or BCoV respiratory shedding [13, 24, 25, 39, 50, 51, 69] . However whether the serum antibodies are themselves correlates of respiratory protection or only reflect prior enteric or respiratory exposure to BCoV is uncertain and requires additional research. If indeed serum BCoV neutralizing antibodies are a correlate of immunity to respiratory BCoV infection [51] , then parenteral vaccines to boost levels of existing BCoV antibodies may be protective.\n\nLin et al [51, 69] assessed the kinetics of the neutralizing and HI antibody responses to respiratory BCoV in sera of cattle during an epizootic of pneumonia associated with the BRDC. Cattle shedding respiratory BCoV at the start of the epizootic had low levels of neutralizing and HI antibodies, whereas cattle with high levels and antibodies against the HE and S viral glycoproteins remained negative for respiratory BCoV. The neutralizing and HI BCoV antibody levels in serum were highly correlated. Moreover all the BCoV antibody isotypes measured (IgM, IgG1 and IgG2) were significantly correlated with the levels of neutralizing and HI antibodies. iIn cattle with fatal respiratory BCoV infections, only IgM antibody responses were detected.\n\nAlternatively in a recent study, intranasal (IN) vaccination of feedlot calves with a modified live BCoV calf vaccine on entry to a feedlot reduced the risk of treatment for BRDC in calves [49] . The immune correlates for the BCoV vaccine were not identified, but based on data from IN modified live IBR vaccines, the authors speculated that locally induced interferon or IgA antibodies could be involved. The data further suggest that IN administration of a BCoV calf diarrhea strain induces cross-protection against field exposure to a respiratory BCoV. The findings concur with results of experimental challenge studies of calves confirming cross-protection among BCoV strains of distinct clinical origin. Inoculation of gnotobiotic or colostrum-deprived calves with calf diarrhea, winter dysentery or respiratory BCoV strains led to both nasal and fecal CoV shedding followed by complete cross-protection against diarrhea after challenge with a calf diarrhea strain [29, 30] . Subclinical nasal and fecal virus shedding (detected only by RT-PCR) in calves challenged with the heterologous BCoV strains [29, 30] , confirmed field studies documenting subclinical BCoV infections and the potential for subclinically infected animals to be a reservoir for BCoV in infected herds [16, 24] . Consequently a goal is to develop vaccines that are protective against divergent field strains of BCoV, including ones from the distinct clinical syndromes. Inclusion of a mixture of strains representing CD, WD and respiratory isolates may be an ideal strategy to develop a single broad spectrum BCoV vaccine effective against BCoV infections associated with each of the clinical sydromes, including respiratory disease.\n\nFuture areas for research include understanding the basic mechanisms of how BCoVs induce a broad spectrum of respiratory disease (ranging from mild to fatal) and the co-factors and interactions that exacerbate disease or lead to enhanced shedding and transmission. Relatively little is known about the basis for interspecies transmission of BCoVs or why they have broad host ranges. We understand little about the ecology of bovine-like CoVs present in wildlife reservoirs or their potential to emerge as either public or animal health threats. Finally a lack of basic understanding of the attributes required for effective respiratory BCoV vaccines and the immune correlates of protection remain obstacles to vaccine development.\n\n\u2022 Bovine CoV causes pneumoenteric infections in cattle and wild ruminants.\n\nDetection of similar CoV strains among wild ruminants and in dogs, with evidence for experimental interspecies transmission to calves, suggests that these species could harbor CoVs transmissible to cattle or vice versa.\n\n\u2022 BCoV is associated with 3 clinically distinct syndromes in cattle: calf diarrhea, winter dysentery in adults and respiratory disease in cattle of various ages.\n\n\u2022 Greater biologic, antigenic and genetic diversity is evident between contemporary and historic BCoV strains than between enteric and respiratory strains. There are no consistent markers to discrim\u00ednate between respiratory and enteric BCoVs.\n\n\u2022 Existence of a single serotype of BCoV and cross-protection among strains from the different clinical syndromes suggests that a single broadly cross-reactive strain of BCoV may suffice for a vaccine. Alternatively because of variations among field strains, including ones from the 3 clinical syndromes, a single vaccine comprised of CD, WD and respiratory BCoV isolates may provide a broader spectum of protection against all 3 syndromes.\n\n\u2022 An accumulating body of evidence suggests that BCoV respiratory infections contribute substantially to the BRDC of feedlot cattle.\n\n\u2022 Underlying disease or respiratory co-infections, dose, route of infection (fecal/ oral or aerosols) and immunosuppression (corticosteroids) related to shipping or immunosuppressive viral co-infections are potential cofactors that could exacerbate the severity of BCoV infections and the BRDC.\n\n\u2022 Samples for antemortem diagnosis of BCoV infections include nasal swabs, tracheobronchial aspirates, and feces collected in the acute stage of infection; postmortem tissues include ones from the upper respriatory tract, lung, ileum and colon. Highly sensitive molecular assays (RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR, qRT-PCR) are being used increasingly to detect BCoV RNA in diagnostic samples including tissue homogenates (lung, etc).\n\n\u2022 Because most cattle are seropositive to BCoV, in suspect herd outbreaks collection and testing of paired sera for BCoV antibody tests is essential for diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 There are no BCoV vaccines to prevent respiratory BCoV infections in cattle and the correlates of immunity to respiratory BCoV infections are unknown.\n\n\u2022 In multiple studies, the serum BCoV antibody isotype (IgG1, IgG2, IgA), neutralizing and HI antibody titer and magnitude of antibody titer in serum of cattle on arrival in feedlots were correlated with various parameters of protection against the BRDC. Whether the serum antibodies are correlates of protection or only reflect prior BCoV exposure is uncertain.\n\n\u2022 Because BCoV infections commonly occur at or shortly after arrival of cattle to feedlots or at auction barns, use of BCoV vaccines in pre-conditioning calf programs, prior to shipment of calves would be the most beneficial.
