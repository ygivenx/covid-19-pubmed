{"title": "ProOmpA Is Stabilized for lVlembrane Tianslocation by Either Purified E. coli Trigger Factor or Canine Signal Recognition Particle", "body": "The salient features of protein translocation across membranes have been described during the last decade (reviewed in Wickner and Lodish, 1985) . These include the presence of a leader sequence, a requirement for metabolic energy, and conformational change of the precursor proteins. Protein insertion into the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum has been viewed as a strictly cotranslational event (Blobel, 1980) coupled to translation by the action of signal recognition particle (SRP; Walter and Blobel, 1981) . Although mammalian and bacterial presecretory proteins share a common leader peptide structure, bacterial secretion is not coupled to translation, and many proteins are exported largely posttranslationally.\n\nAlthough bacterial membrane assembly has been reconstituted with purified components for one protein, the Ml3 procoat protein (Ohno-lwashita and Wickner, 1983) this protein is unusually simple in that its membrane insertion does not require the functioning of secand prl-encoded proteins (Wolfe et al., 1985) . More recently, an in vitro translation-translocation reaction has been described for set and p&dependent proteins (Miiller and Blobel, 1984; Rhoads et al., 1984) . In this reaction, presecretory proteins, synthesized in an Escherichia coli extract, translocate into the lumen of inverted, sealed plasma membrane vesicles. As clearly established in vivo, the in vitro translocation is not coupled to ongoing polypeptide chain growth and requires both ATP hydrolysis (Chen and Tai, 1985) and the membrane electrochemical potential (Geller et al., 1988) .\n\nWe have undertaken an enzymological approach to resolve and reconstitute the components of this translocation reaction. [sS] proOmpA was purified lSOO-fold in 8 M urea from an in vitro protein synthesis reaction (Crooke and Wickner, 1987) . Upon dilution, the proOmpA renatures into a form competent for membrane assembly (Crooke et al., 1988) . However, it rapidly loses this competence unless a soluble protein, which we have termed trigger factor, is present. Trigger factor stabilizes proOmpA in a form that is competent for membrane assembly. Indirect evidence has been presented which indicates that trigger factor and proOmpA may form a complex (Crooke and Wickner, 1987) .\n\nWe now report the isolation of homogeneous proOmpA and trigger factor. An important step in the purification of trigger factor is affinity chromatography on proOmpA-Sepharose, confirming our hypothesis that these proteins can form a complex. N-terminal sequence analysis indicates that trigger factor is not one of the proteins encoded by the well-studied set, prl, or heat shock genes. Studies reported here and in an accompanying article (Lill et al., 1988) show interactions of trigger factor with ribosomes, proOmpA, and membranes and suggest a cyclic mode of its action. The similarity of this trigger factor cycle to the cyclic action of canine SRP led us to the finding that SRP, which had been thought to act exclusively in the context of the ribosome, can also stabilize purified proOmpA for membrane insertion. These studies suggest that a primary function of trigger factor, and possibly SRP, is to stabilize presecretory proteins for membrane translocation.\n\nof ProOmpA A first step toward the isolation of large amounts of proOmpA was its overproduction in vivo. Expression of the omp9 gene under the trc promoter in a multicopy plasmid causes substantial overproduction of proOmpA and OmpA ( Figure 1, lanes 1 and 2) . Cells were disrupted and incubated with Sarkosyl to solubilize the membrane proteins. As described by Freud1 et al. (1986) the proOmpA remains aggregated in this detergent extract and can be separated from the other cellular proteins simply by centrifugation. ProOmpA was solubilized from this \"washed pellet\" fraction with 8 M urea. This procedure resulted in a 5-fold purification and 35% yield of proOmpA. In a typical preparation, 422 mg of purified proOmpA (Figure 1 , lanes 3-9) was obtained from 62 g (wet weight) of cells.\n\nThe purified proOmpA can be renatured for membrane assembly by dilution of the urea. ProOmpA in 8 M urea was diluted into a reaction mixture that contained ATP and inverted, sealed E. coli plasma membrane vesicles Strain W3110 bearing the trc-omp9 plasmid was grown at 37X in MQ minimal medium with 0.5% glucose, 0.4% Casamino Acids (Difco), and 100 us/ml ampicillin. At an Am of 1.0, isopropyl thiogalactoside was added to 05 mM and growth was continued for 2 hr. Cells were collected bycentrifugation, suspended in buffer (50 mM his-HCI [pH 7.51, 10% sucrose), frozen as small nuggets by pipetting the suspension into liquid nitrogen, and stored at -8OOC. To prepare proOmpA, frozen cell suspensions (128 g) were thawed, mixed with lysozyme (0.9 mglml), and incubated for 5 min at 23OC. After addition of MgCIZ (5 mM) and DNAase I (4 kg/ml), the suspension was incubated an additional 5 min at 23OC. Extraction buffer (360 ml; 1.5% Iwt/vol] Sarkosyl, 50 mM citrate, titrated to pH 6.0 with solid NazHPO.,) was added and the mixture subjected to Dounce homogenization.\n\nAfter 30 min at 23OC), the solution was centrifuged (27,000 x g, 15 min at 23OC). This extraction was repeated twice. The final pellet was suspended in 22 ml of buffer C (see Experimental Procedures) by continuous vortexing for 5 min at 23\"C), followed by centrifugation for 1 min at 27,000 x g. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie brilliant blue R250 staining. The leftmost two lanes show 5 pg and 15 pg of the unfractionated crude lysate. The other lanes contain the indicated amounts of purified proOmpA. (Rhoads et al., 1984) . After incubation at 40% to allow membrane assembly, samples were chilled on ice and assayed for translocated OmpA by incubating the sealed membrane vesicles with proteinase K. Each reaction mixture was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblot analysis with antiserum to OmpA ( Figure 2 ). When 0.22 pg of proOmpA was assayed with 1.5 Ng of membrane vesicles (Figure 2, lane 7), approximately loo/o was translocated across the membrane and processed to mature OmpA (compare with standard in lane 9). Translocation was dependent on ATP (see lanes 2, 4, 6, and 6; no ATP). The total translocation increased with increasing amounts of proOmpA in the assay (Figure 2, lanes 5 and 3) .\n\nAt the highest levels of proOmpA, the translocation reached a plateau level, suggesting that this concentration of proOmpA was saturating an essential membrane element. To test this, varying amounts of proOmpA were mixed with a constant amount of [35S]proOmpA in 8 M urea, then diluted with membranes and assayed for translocation ( lo present a low background for the assembly assay, inner-membrane vesicles were prepared from E. coli JF699, a strain deficient in OmpA. Each translocation reaction contained 1.5 ug of membrane protein. The indicated amount of proOmpA in 1 ul of buffer C was diluted into an ice-cold translocation mixture (80 !I), allowed to translocate for 20 min at 4oOC, and assayed for translocation by protease inaccessibility (see Experimental Procedures). ATP and NADH were omitted from the incubation in even-numbered lanes. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by immunoblot with antiserum to OmpA. Lane 9 is a standard of 0.021 ug of proOmpA. sivefy inhibits the translocation of proOmpA. The translocated proOmpA into these vesicles is thus both saturable and energy dependent. As a control, we determined that addition of various amounts of nonradioactive proOmpA to the assembly reactions after translocation of [sS]pro-OmpA was complete had no effect on the protease protection assay ( Figure 3 , lanes 5, 9, and 13). As expected, OmpA translocates poorly or not at all under these reaction conditions (data not shown).\n\nPurification of Trigger Factor We have previously reported indirect evidence that trigger factor forms a complex with proOmpA (Crooke and Wickner, 1987) . With large amounts of pure proOmpA now I 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 IO II I2 I3 14 15 The indicated amounts of purified proOmpA (in 1 ~1) were added to each incubation, either from the beginning of the translocation reaction (time 0) or after 20 min of the 23 min incubation. Incubations were performed in either the presence, or absence of ATP and NADH, as indicated. Lane 15 is a standard of proOmpA. available, we covalently linked proOmpA to a CNB-activated Sepharose column to create an affinity resin for the isolation of trigger factor. The resin was suspended in crude soluble protein extract (S40) from E. coli in the presence of 8 M urea, then dialyzed to remove the urea. These conditions were chosen to mimic those in which the trigger factor in S40 was shown to support renaturation of radiochemically pure [s5S]proOmpA (Crooke and Wickner, 1987). The dialyzed suspension was poured into a column, rinsed with buffer, and step-eluted with buffer containing 8 M urea. This affinity step resulted in a 23-fold purification of trigger factor with a 55% yield.\n\nFurther purification was achieved by successive ion exchange chromatography with S-Sepharose Fast Flow cation exchange resin and Mono Q anion exchange FPLC. The overall purification, in three steps, is 150-fold with a 54% yield (Table 1 ; see Experimental Procedures for trigger factor activity assay). Analysis of trigger factor at each step of the purification by SDS-PAGE and silver staining ( Figure 4A ) shows that the purified protein (lane 5) is a single polypeptide of apparent size 63,000 daltons. It was recovered as a single, sharp, symmetric peak on the final step of ion exchange chromatography ( Figure 48 ). The 63,000 dalton polypeptide eluted at fraction 28 ( Figure  4C ), coincident, with the trigger factor activity of promoting proOmpA translocation into membrane vesicles ( Figure  4D ). While minor bands of lower molecular weight can be detected, these polypeptides are not consistently seen (see, for example, Figure 3A of Lill et al., 1988) and do not form a complex with proOmpA (see Figure 7 ). Gel filtration analysis shows that the prominent polypeptide ( Figure  4C ) and trigger factor activity co-elute with an apparent size of 73,000 daltons ( Figure 5 ), indicating that trigger factor is a monomeric protein.\n\nAutomated Edman sequence analysis showed that the amino terminus of trigger factor has the sequence Met-Gin-Val-Ser-Val-GIu-ThrThr-Gin-Gly-Leu-Gly-.\n\nThis sequence does not correspond to any of the published set or p&encoded proteins, to heat shock proteins DnaK (Bardwell and Craig, 1984) or C62.5 (Bardwell and Craig, 1987) , or to GroEL (Hemmingsen et al., 1988) . It does not correspond to any protein currently listed in the 1987 update of the PSQ data base (Dayhoff, 1979) , which currently lists approximately 500 E. coli proteins.\n\nof Purified Trigger Factor Aliquots of purified trigger factor were incubated with proOmpA-Sepharose and OmpA-Sepharose and as-sayed for binding. Trigger factor was also incubated with Sepharose with covalently bound Ml3 procoat leader peptide, a leader typical in structure (von Heijne, 1983 ) that functions in vivo to promote OmpA secretion (Kuhn et al., 1987) . Trigger factor bound to proOmpA-Sepharose but not to the immobilized OmpA or leader peptide (E. C., unpublished observation), suggesting either that the trigger factor recognizes features of the leader as well as the mature protein or that proper recognition of a domain of proOmpA requires the presence of the intact precursor protein.\n\nWe have previously reported that partially purified trigger factor will stabilize proOmpA in a conformation competent for membrane assembly (Crooke et al., 1988) . To establish that this is a feature of the purified protein, and to characterize its action, proOmpA was diluted from 8 M to 0.8 M urea and assayed for translocation. Immediately after dilution, proOmpA is competent for translocation ( Figure 6 , lane 3) and the efficiency of this translocation is not affected by trigger factor (lane 4). However, pro-OmpA lost competence for membrane insertion after a 3 hr preincubation at 21% (Figure 6, lane 5). As previously reported (Crooke et al., 1988) proOmpA preincubated in the presence of trigger factor retains full activity for assembly into inverted plasma membrane vesicles from E. coli ( Figure 6, lane 7) . Addition of trigger factor to proOmpA that had already misfolded during preincubation at 21% did not restore its competence for assembly (lane 9) suggesting that trigger factor stabilizes the competent form of proOmpA rather than refolding the incompetent protein. Since proOmpA can bind directly to membrane vesicles in the absence of trigger factor, we determined whether membranes would stabilize the translocation-competent form of the precursor protein. Pro-OmpA preincubated at 21\u00b0C with membrane vesicles lost competence for subsequent membrane translocation ( Figure 6 , lane 11) while preincubation in the presence of membranes and trigger factor, but without ATP and NADH (lane 12), stabilized the assembly-active precursor.\n\nTrigger factor and proOmpA form a 1:l complex that can be isolated by gel filtration. ProOmpA and trigger factor were mixed in 8 M urea, dialyzed to remove the urea and allow complex formation, and size fractionated on a Superose 12 FPLC column (Figure 7 ). The complex emerged as a single, symmetric peak ( Figure 7 , line C). In the absence of trigger factor, proOmpA aggregates and emerges in the void volume (Figure 7, tent with a 1:l 8tiOChiOmetry of proOmpA (molecular mass 37,563 daltons; Chen et al., 1980) and trigger factor (apparent molecular mass 73,000 daltons as judged by gel filtration). A 1:l complex can also be demonstrated by covalent cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate (data not shown). The purified complex was stable to storage and was fully active for membrane assembly (S. L., unpublished observations). Further studies will be needed to establish the structural features of this complex and the parameters of its formation and dissocation. SRP Stabilizes ProOmpA for Membrane Translocation Like trigger factor, canine SRP ha8 been shown to recognize presecretory proteins, although until now its activity has been assayed in the context of a polysome. We therefore asked whether dog pancreas microsomes might contain a trigger factor activity. ProOmpA was diluted from urea and preincubated at 21% with either a salt extract of dog pancreas microsomes or with salt extract buffer alone. After various preincubation times, the proOmpA was assayed for assembly into E. coli plasma membrane vesicles. The microsomal extract stabilizes proOmpA for membrane insertion (Figure 8) , although not as well as (lane 4) of trigger factor (100 ng). Samples in lanes 5-12 were preincubated at 21\u00b0C for 3 hr before addition of membrane vesicles and assaying of membrane assembly. The samples in lanes 5 and 6 were preincubated in the absence of trigger factor (lane 6 also lacked ATP and NADH during the preincubation). Samples in lanes 7 and 8 were preincubated in the presence of trigger factor (lane 8 had no ATP or NADH during preincubation or during membrane assembly).\n\nThe sample in lane 9 was preincubated for 3 hr without trigger factor, then mixed with trigger factor and assayed for membrane assembly. Samples in lane 11 and 12 were preincubated in the presence of membrane vesicles for 3 hr at 2W but without ATP or NADH; after the 3 hr preincubation, ATP and NADH were added and samples were assayed for translocation.\n\nThe sample in lane 12 had trigger factor present during preincubation.\n\nLane 1 contains a pro-OmpA marker. Lanes 2 and IO had no sample. trigger factor (Figure 6 ; see also Crooke et al., 1968) . This may in part reflect the instability of SRP itself in the absence of detergent (Walter and Blobel, 1980) . To stabilize the SRP and to allow its purification, we added 0.01% Nik- kol to our buffers and isolated SRP by published procedures (Walter and Blobel, 1980) . Nikko1 does not inhibit the membrane assembly of proOmpA that has already formed a complex with trigger factor (Figure 9 , lane 3, no detergent; lane 4, detergent added), and thus has no effect on the membrane translocation \"machinery\" per se or on the protease protection assay. However, it strongly inhibits the membrane assembly of proOmpA in the absence of stabilizing trigger factor ( Figures 1OA and 106,  lanes 3) .\n\nSRP and the activity of stabilizing proOmpA copurified by either w-aminopentyl agarose chromatography or sucrose gradient sedimentation. SRP prepared by each of these methods ( Figure 10 ) stabilizes proOmpA against the detergent denaturation (lanes 4 and 5) and allow8 a level of assembly comparable to that seen in the absence of detergent (lanes 8). This SRP-dependent membrane assembly requires ATP (lanes 6 and 7, no ATP). To assess the relative potency of trigger factor and SRP in stabilizing proOmpA, comparable molar amounts of each were assayed ( Figure 1OC ). While the trigger factor is clearly somewhat superior in stabilizing proOmpA, this is hardly surprising since these proteins evolved in the same organism, while SRP was isolated from canine pancreas.\n\nIsolation of a Trigger Factor-ProOmpA Complex by Gel Filtration ProOmpA (300 ng; 25 mglml in buffer C), trigger factor (100 ng), or a mixture of the two was diluted to 250 PI in buffer C and dialyzed overnight against 1.0 liter of 66 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.6) 25 mM NH&I, 10 mM Mg acetate, 0.5 mM f3-mercaptoethanol.\n\nAliquots (200 nl) were applied to a 25 ml Superose 12 FPLC column (equilibrated in the dialysis buffer) and eluted at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Fractions (250 ~1) were collected, and 5 pl aliquots of each were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The Azsc tracing and corresponding gel analysis are shown for trigger factor (A) proOmpA (B) and trigger factor-proOmpA complex (C). V, indicates the column void volume.\n\nThe membrane assembly reaction of proOmpA with trigger factor and inner-membrane vesicles requires ATP, the membrane potential, and the leader sequence of proOmpA. It therefore represents an authentic reconstitution of translocation. The proOmpA is translocated across an intact membrane and, as in vivo, it is processed to OmpA after translocation. It is likely that other soluble proteins, such as those encoded by the secA and se& genes, would bind to our preparations of plasma membrane vesicles or, if added to the in vitro translocation in the absence (lane 2) or presence (lanes 3 and 4) of trigger factor (100 ng). Samples were maintained at 21\u00b0C for 3 hr. Membrane vesicles were added to each reaction, and samples were incubated at 40\u00b0C for 20 min. Buffer J (3 pl, contains 0.01% Nikkol) was added to the sample in lane 4 immediately before addition of membranes. Translocation was assayed by protease protection. The marker in lane 1 represents 33% translocation efficiency.\n\nreaction, would enhance either the rate or extent of the assembly reaction. The SecB protein (Collier et al., 1988) may have the same function as trigger factor, with different, but overlapping, substrate specificity. Further experiments with these proteins will be essential to settle these questions.\n\nThe purification of proOmpA has provided several insights into the mechanisms of its assembly across the E. coli plasma membrane. It can spontaneously fold into a form competent for membrane assembly (Crooke et al., 1988) . ATP is the only other essential soluble component. In the absence of other proteins, proOmpA loses this competence (Crooke et al., 1988) . At physiological temperatures, proOmpA misfolds within minutes (E. C., unpublished observations), suggesting a physiological role for trigger factor in stabilizing proOmpA by forming a stoichiometric complex.\n\nThe isolation of these proteins and the demonstration of their activity in translocation across a membrane raise several important questions. Perhaps foremost is the question of whether trigger factor has a role in vivo similar to that deduced from its action in vitro. This may be addressed by isolating the gene for trigger factor and establishing control of its synthesis in the cell. A second question is whether trigger factor is related to the heat shock, ATP-dependent unfolding activities required for protein translocation into endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria in yeast (Deshaies et al., 1988; Chirico et al., 1988) . We note, however, that the cellular concentraGon of trigger factor is not affected by heat shock (E. C. and S. L., unpublished observations). Finally, it will be important to understand how trigger factor is released from proOmpA as the proOmpA crosses the membrane. The availability of milligram quantities of pure trigger factor and proOmpA should facilitate studies of these questions.\n\nA close analogy can be drawn between trigger factor and the SRI? Either may associate with both the ribosome A. 3-7) . Each sample in lanes 3-7 contained the equivalent of 3 ~1 of buffer J. ATP was omitted where indicated. Membranes were immediately added, and samples were incubated for 20 min at 40\u00b0C. Purified SRP (in 3 PI of buffer J) was added to the sample in lane 8 after the translocation reaction. All samples (lanes 3-8) were assayed for translocation by incubation with proteinase K. The marker in lane 1 represents 10% translocation; lane 2 contains no sample. SRP was purified from canine microsomal salt extract by elution from an o-aminopentyl agarose column (A) or by sucrose gradient centrifugation (6). (C) [35S]proOmpA was renatured by dilution into translocation mixtures (without membranes) that contained the indicated amounts of purified trigger factor or o-aminopentyl agarose-isolated SRI? Membrane vesicles were immediately added to reactions that contained 0.0003% Nikko1 and SRP. The reactions were assayed for membrane assembly.\n\nReactions that contained trigger factor were preincubated for 3 hr at 2YC before addition of membrane vesicles and assaying of membrane assembly. Protease-protected [35S]OmpA was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The resulting fluorography bands were quantitated by densitometric scanning. (Walter and Blobel, 1981; Lill et al., 1988) and with proteins bearing a leader sequence. Each can allow a presecretory or membrane protein to translocate across a membrane. While the interaction of SRP with precursor proteins was initially thought to be strictly coupled to an early stage of polypeptide chain growth (Walter and Blobel, 1981) , recent studies have revealed that it can promote the translocation of nearly full-length polypeptides (Rottier et al., 1985; Ainger and Meyer, 1988; Perara et al., 1988) . We have found that SRP can interact with purified proOmpA to stabilize it in a form competent for membrane transit. This raises the question of whether SRP also functions in vivo to stabilize presecretory and membrane proteins in a conformation that allows transit across the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nThe subunit structures of SRP and trigger factor are, of course, completely different. SRP consists of six polypeptides and a 7s RNA, while trigger factor is simply a monomeric protein. This difference in structural complexity is reminiscent of the leader peptidases of these two organisms: the E. coli enzyme is a single polypeptide (Wolfe et al., 1983) , while that from dog pancreas has six polypeptide subunits (Evans et al., 1988) . In addition to its affinity for leader sequences and ribosomes, SRP has a specific membrane receptor (Meyer et al., 1982) . Studies in the accompanying paper (Lill et al., 1988) suggest that trigger factor may also bind to a specific site on the plasma membrane. Our observations lead to a working model of the cyclic action of trigger factor in promoting preprotein translocation (Lill et al., 1988 SlOO (Gold and Schweiger, 197i) , and S40 were prepared from E. coli strain DlO (ma-70 &Al spoJ7 met81) grown in L-broth at 37%. Inverted inner-membranevesicles were prepared from DlO (Rhoads et al., 1984) and, where indicated, JF899 @foC24 omp-A252 his-53 purE41 i/v-277 mer-65 lacy29 xyl-74 rpsL97 cyc41 q&2 tsx-63 k-). ProOmpA was isolated from wild-type E. coli W3110 carrying the pTRC-Omp9 plasmid. Cells for S40, SlOO, ribosomes, and proOmpA were harvested from a 150 liter fermenter using a Sharples centrifuge.\n\nCell pastes were suspended in an equal weight of 50 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 10% (Wvvol) sucrose, then frozen as small nuggets by rapid pipetting into liquid nitrogen and stored frozen at -80% (Wickner et al., 1972) .\n\nPreparation of ProOmpA-Sepharose Resin ProOmpA (475 mg of the washed pellet, Figure 1) Nuggets of frozen DlO cell suspension (300 g; Am = 1 .O at harvest) were thawed without warming. Lysozyme (8 ml, 10 mglml) was added with gentle stirring. The suspension was immediately poured into centrifuge tubes and maintained on ice for 30 min. Tubes were heated at 37% for 3 min; care was taken not to subject the sample to hydrodynamic shear forces. The lysate was centrifuged for 60 min at 41,000 x g at 0%. The clear amber supernatant (540) was pooled.\n\nStep II, Affinity Chromatography S40 (1 IO ml) was made 8 M in urea by the addition of 66 g of urea. This was mixed with 110 ml of settled Sepharose CL-4B resin with covalently attached proOmpA, equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.0), 2 mM DTT, 8 M urea (buffer C). The S40 and resin slurry was dialyzed at 2% with vigorous stirring against three 6 liter portions of 66 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.6), 25 mM NH&I, IO mM Mg acetate, 2 mM DTT (buffer B). The resin was harvested by low-speed centrifugation (10 min at 150 x g). The supernatant was removed, and the resin was resuspended in 100 ml of fresh buffer Band poured into a 2.5 x 22.5 cm column. Unbound proteins were eluted with 600 ml of buffer B. Bound proteins were eluted with buffer C.\n\nStep III, SSepharose Fast Flow Step II trigger factor (18 ml) was dialyzed at 2\u00b0C against two 1 liter portions of 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 1 mM DTT, 10% (vollvol) glycerol (buffer D). The dialyzed sample was applied to a 15 ml (1.5 x 9.0 cm) S-Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated in buffer D. The column was washed with 75 ml of buffer D. Trigger factor was eluted with 0.5 M NaCl in buffer D.\n\nStep IV, Mono Cl FPLC The pool (8 ml) of Step III trigger factor was dialyzed against two 500 ml portions of 50 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.0), 1 mM DTT, 10% (vollvol) glycerol (buffer E). The dialyzed sample was applied to an FPLC Mono Q IO/10 column (approximately 8 ml) equilibrated in buffer E. The column was washed with 40 ml of buffer E. Trigger factor was eluted with a O-O.5 M NaCl linear gradient (120 ml) in buffer E. Trigger factor eluted at approximately 275 mM NaCI.\n\nIsolation of Trigger Factor-free [35S]proOmpA [%]proOmpA was synthesized in a cell-free synthesis reaction (4.0 ml, 10 mCi %-Translabel) as previously described (Bacallao et al., 1986) . SDS (0.25%) was added following the synthesis reaction. The sample was heated at 100\u00b0C for 10 min, then cooled to 21%. Triton X-100(15% in 2.5 ml of buffer B) was added to 5.7% final concentration. $%]proOmpA was immediately isolated on a 15 ml proOmpA affinity column as previously described (Crooke and Wickner, 1987) .\n\nIn Vitm Translocation of PmOmpA Renatured by Dilution ProOmpA (6 ~1, 100,000 cpm) in 8 M urea was diluted into 60 VI translocation reaction mixtures as previously described (Crooke et al., 1988) . Translocation of proOmpA into E. coli inverted inner-membrane vesicles was assayed by accessibility to added protease (Bacallao et al., 1988) .\n\nTrigger Factor Activity Trigger factor was assayed for its ability to maintain proOmpA in a translocation-competent state following renaturation by dialysis (Crooke and Wickner, 1987) . For each sample, a 2 ~1 aliquot was mixed with trigger factor-free ]%]proOmpA (100,000 cpm in 98 ~1 of buffer C with 300 pglml bovine serum albumin). Each mixture was dialyzed against two 100 ml portions of buffer B at 2% for 8 hr. Aliquots of the dialyzed samples were added to translocation reaction mixtures (60 ~1) that contained\n\n[%]proOmpA, 50 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.6), 37 mM KCI, 16 mM NH&I, 8.2 mM Mg acetate, 1.4 mM DTT, 1 mM spermidine chloride, 8 mM putrescine chloride, 330 wg of protein per ml of inverted inner-membrane vesicles, and (unless indicated) 1 mM ATP and 5 mM NADH. Translocaiton was assayed by the inaccessibility of proOmpA and OmpA to added protease (Bacallao et al., 1986) . One unit (Table  1 ) of activity is defined as the amount of trigger factor that causes 10% of the added proOmpA to be inaccessible to protease following translocation.\n\nof Mlcmsomal Extract and Purification of SRP A salt extract of dog pancreas microsomes was prepared, and SRP was purified following published procedures (Walter and Blobel, 1980) with the following minor modifications:\n\nBuffer H (50 mM triethanolamine [pH 751, 500 mM KCI, 5 mM MgCls, and 1 mM DTT) was used for the extraction of microsomes.\n\nSRP was purified by chromatography on w-aminopentyl agarose using buffer H as the loading buffer and buffer J (50 mM triethanolamine [pH 7.51, 1 M KCI, 5 mM MgCls, 1 mM DTT, and 0.01% Nikkol) as the elution buffer. Alternatively, purification was achieved by ultracentrifugation on a 50/b-20% linear sucrose gradient in buffer H containing 0.01% Nikkol.\n\nProOmpA purification and translocation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described by Ito et al. (1980) . Trigger factor and ribosome protein profiles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 15% acrylamide, 0.12% N,N'-methylene his-acrylamide, and 6 M urea (Ito et al., 1981) .
