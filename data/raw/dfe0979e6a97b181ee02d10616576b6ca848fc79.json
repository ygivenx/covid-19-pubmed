{"title": "Dendritic cells: microbial clearance via autophagy and potential immunobiological consequences for periodontal disease", "body": "The oral cavity, oral-pharynx and naso-pharynx comprise the most proximal extent of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts (36) . They are also part of the intricate network of the craniofacial mucosal immune system. This system shares many properties with other mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues and secondary lymphoid tissues, but is also quite distinct in terms of cellular requirements for organogenesis and mucosal imprinting molecules [reviewed in (137) ]. Oral mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue must deal with a continuous bacterial onslaught, where the number of colonizing bacteria far exceeds the number of host cells per surface area (48) . Because of this bacterial load, humans have evolved different biological mechanisms to tolerate commensal bacterial while preventing invasion by more pathogenic bacteria. However, in some instances the human immune response is not up to the task, unable to maintain the delicate balance needed between tolerance and protection. Consequently, the host becomes more susceptible to long-term effects of disruption of immune homeostasis, manifest by several autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders, including periodontal disease (163) .\n\nDendritic cells are the peripheral sentinels of the human mucosal immune system and key regulators of tolerance and protection. Dendritic cells capture and process antigens, express co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines needed for antigen presentation to B and T lymphocytes. Dendritic cells also play an essential role in \"tolerizing\" T cells to selfantigens, thereby minimizing autoimmune reactions. As such, dendritic cells play a seminal role in deciding whether to mount a vigorous immune response against pathogenic bacteria, and to tolerate commensal microbes (or self-antigens). When dendritic cell-mediated immune homeostasis is disrupted, dendritic cells can contribute to the pathogenesis of different inflammatory destructive conditions (11, 37) .\n\nDendritic cells are commonly distinguished by their location in peripheral tissues, secondary lymphoid organs or in circulation in blood. Tissue \"resident\" dendritic cells, namely Langerhans cells or interstitial dendritic cells have relatively long lifespans and play an active role in immune surveillance, promoting host tolerance or immunity. However, nearly 50% of the dendritic cells found in these tissues are not typical resident dendritic cells, rather migratory dendritic cell subsets. Circulating blood dendritic cells are distinguished from tissue dendritic cells in that they neither show dendrite formation nor express maturation features (such as CD83 expression) (186) . Because blood dendritic cells lack lineage specific markers such as CD3, CD14, CD19, CD56, and glycophorin A, they are generally isolated by negative selection (157, 171, 173) . Blood dendritic cells can be divided into three general dendritic cell types based on function and phenotype: plasmacytoid dendritic cells and two types of conventional or myeloid dendritic cells (CD1c+ or CD141+) (56, 85, 186) . Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are derived from lymphoid progenitors and resemble plasma cells, however plasmacytoid dendritic cells share more commonalities to myeloid dendritic cells. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are commonly identified by CD123, CD303, and CD304 expression, and they also strongly express Toll-like receptor-7 and -9 and can produce high amounts of interferon-alpha in response to C-phosphate-G bacterial DNA motifs (but not bacterial lipopolysaccharide) (169) . Therefore, plasmacytoid dendritic cells are thought to predominantly recognize viral antigens (30, 68) . Myeloid dendritic cells on the other hand are highly phagocytic, antigen-processing dendritic cells that recognize both bacterial and viral antigens (117, 156) . Myeloid dendritic cells can be characterized by CD1c+ (BDCA-1+) expression or CD141+ expression. CD1c+ myeloid dendritic cells express all Toll-like receptors (except Toll-like receptor-9), whereas CD141+ myeloid dendritic cells express a more restricted pattern, limited to Toll-like receptor-3 and Toll-like receptor-10, suggesting a more specific role in antiviral immunity (85) . Recent studies have revealed the important role for blood myeloid dendritic cells in responding to periodontal infection (Table 1) .\n\nMyeloid dendritic cells are widely distributed in the body and can regulate immune activation or tolerance functions (depending on activation/maturation state and cytokine profile). Myeloid dendritic cells show such a degree of plasticity that some subsets can even serve as osteoclast precursors and have a role in osteoclastogenesis (2, 145) . Myeloid dendritic cells are normally at very low abundance in the blood (below ~1% circulating leukocytes). A rise (or fall) in blood myeloid dendritic cells is often a hallmark of underlying chronic inflammatory/infectious disease; as such blood myeloid dendritic cells have been called the \"canary in the coal mine\" of these diseases (124) . Most myeloid dendritic cells predominantly function within the confines of the tissues, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, lymphatics and secondary lymphoid organs. Myeloid dendritic cells typically exhibit short lifespans (especially after activation) as well as the need for constant replenishing. Where needed, myeloid dendritic cells can rapidly mobilize in response to hematopoietic factors (such as Flt-3 ligand) (93, 99) . In a normal physiologic state of immune homeostasis, myeloid dendritic cells constantly undergo influx to and efflux from mucosal tissues; however in pathophysiologic states of infection, the total number of blood myeloid dendritic cells can significantly increase (23, 124) . Whether this is a consequence of active mobilization of epidermal Langerhans cells and lamina propria myeloid dendritic cells from e.g. periodontally infected tissues to the blood, increased dendritic cell differentiation from progenitors, decreased apoptosis (122) or reduced homing to secondary lymphoid organs (123) are a matter of speculation. From a histopathological context, Langerhans cells decrease in the gingival epithelium in both gingivitis and periodontitis, apparently by efflux through the basement membrane. In contrast, myeloid dendritic cells increase in the lamina propria in periodontitis and form immune conjugates with CD4+ T cells, called oral lymphoid foci in situ (Table 1 ).\n\nBlood monocytes have the ability to differentiate into various cell lineage types, including myeloid dendritic cells and Langerhans cells. In vitro, this differentiation is dependent on the presence of recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4, resulting in monocyte derived dendritic cells (8, 100, 138, 183) , or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor/interleukin-4 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 in the case of Langerhans cells (65) These 'canonical' monocyte-derived dendritic cells and Langerhans cells are similar in many ways to typical myeloid dendritic cells (25, 65, 109) , thus facilitating study of their functions despite low abundance in physiological conditions (108) . When the host encounters microbial/pro-inflammatory signals in an infected site, CCR2+ blood monocytes can rapidly migrate and then differentiate into distinct populations of myeloid dendritic cells (27, 66) . Toll-like receptor recognition and stimulation seems to be particularly influential in 'non-canonical' differentiation of monocytes into CD209 + CD16 + or CD1b/c + -monocyte-derived dendritic cells (103) . However, such increases in the myeloid dendritic cells population do not necessarily lead to efficient immune responses; in fact, the resultant myeloid dendritic cells pool can be \"immuno-incompetent\" in some cases. Such a phenomenon is particularly found during chronic, low-grade infections and it is also associated with faulty pathogen elimination and antigen presentation processes; this may further exacerbate the immune dysregulation observed in chronic inflammatory diseases (124) .\n\nIn the case of periodontal diseases, oral mucosal infection is initiated by biofilm colonization of the tooth and oral mucosa. The biofilm composition is eventually transformed by an increase in certain pathogens. The host response to this biofilm ultimately leads to soft and hard tissue destruction (24, 40) . This involves release by local neutrophils and mast cells of vasoactive peptides (via tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1) resulting in secretion of inflammatory mediators by resident cells of the gingival tissue (fibroblasts); Moreover, invading immune cells \"amplify\" the local immune response, particularly polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other myeloid inflammatory cells that are increasingly recruited into tissues via diapedesis, in a process facilitated by vasodilation. Also, certain microbial species, notably the anaerobic gram-negative bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis, have the unique ability to invade tissues and produce destructive proteolytic enzymes as well as to induce strong local inflammatory responses (21, 77) .\n\nAmong the leukocytes that promote pro-inflammatory responses are myeloid dendritic cells (35, 37) . The myeloid dendritic cells in gingival lamina propria typically express the C-type lectin and the pattern recognition receptor DC-SIGN (Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin, or CD209), which is used as an invasin by a broad range of pathogenic organisms (45, 116, 120, 160) . In the case of P. gingivalis, the 67-kDa minor fimbrial adhesin (denoted mfa-1) is expressed, which is glycosylated and targets dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN for entry into myeloid dendritic cells (182) . This interaction has also been shown to drive myeloid dendritic cell function away from maturation, leading to low accessory molecule expression and a more immunosuppressive cytokine production profile (180) ( Table 1 ). Due to their pronounced migratory function, immature status and weak bactericidal mechanisms, myeloid dendritic cells in blood may be particularly susceptible to exploitation by invasive pathogens. For example, more recent in vitro findings in our lab show that P. gingivalis, through its manipulation of dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin dendritic cell-SIGN-Toll-like receptor-2 signaling, rapidly induces differentiation of dendritic cells from monocyte progenitors. These dendritic cells, which we termed \"pathogen-differentiated\" dendritic cells, are CD1c +CD209+CD14\u2212, but immature in phenotype and function unless forced to mature with an inflammatory cocktail (122) . In addition, the P. gingivalis-dendritic cell interaction further dysregulates homeostasis by driving cells towards an aberrant chemokine receptor profile. These pathogen-differentiated dendritic cells display poor secondary lymphoid-organ homing capabilities (123) that would prevent efficient effector cell responses. Hence, the generation of non-canonical pathogen-differentiated dendritic cells may have implications for pathogen dissemination and immune subversion in the low-grade transient bacteremia and chronic inflammation scenarios observed in periodontal diseases.\n\nTargeting host cells is a fundamental step in viral infection by which viruses translocate their genome into host cells. Accordingly, two main questions are crucial in understanding such a process: 1) how viruses translocate their genomes into the target cell cytoplasm, 2) how the virus reaches the \"remote\" targeted cells after initial entry. Studying the interactions of dendritic cells with viruses could provide clues on these two aspects of viral diseases pathogenesis. As the main immune sentinels, many viruses target dendritic cells for direct propagation or systemic dissemination. Dendritic cells exist in the peripheral tissues in several phenotypic and functional subsets (186) . The distinction of these subtypes is mainly based on the expression of pattern-recognition receptors at their surface such as toll-like receptors and specific lectins for detecting high-mannose glycan motifs. Differential receptor expression governs the maturation state of dendritic cells and subsequently its function in immune homeostasis. In addition, the early acquaintance with each receptor administers the subsequent dendritic cell differentiation as well as the fate of the microorganisms. For example, in the case of dendritic cells, dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN can be used as an attachment by many viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (38) , measles virus (43), hepatitis C virus (139) , influenza A viruses (115) , cytomegaloviruses (78), herpes simplex virus type 1 (42) , Ebola virus (3), West Nile virus (41) , SARS coronavirus (178) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (91) . Understanding such early recognition and subsequent intracellular pathways has been heavily investigated to reveal key pathogenic aspects in several viral diseases. Dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN directly interacts with the Human immunodeficiency virus through its gpl20 envelope glycoprotein, and this interaction has been established as the route of HIV transmission to T cells (63) . In general, C-type lectin receptors have shown repetitive patterns of being used for virus uptake, survival and even systemic dissemination (10) . For instance, CD46 and CD150 have been identified as the classic measles receptors for epithelial and immune cells (52, 161) ; however, the identification of measles infection on alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, which do not express CD150, suggested the involvement of other receptors (62, 106, 110) . Consequently, it has been demonstrated that measles interaction with dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN allows CD150mediated entry into dendritic cells (9) . Hence, dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN seems to provide a means for measles transport across the epithelial barrier, suggesting that dendritic cell infection facilitates measles virus to reach the lymphatic organs and replicate robustly (10) . Similarly, dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN efficiently captures the glycan structures on the viral envelope glycoproteins, including herpes simplex virus-1. Herpes simplex virus-1 infection can decrease the immuno-stimulatory phenotype of dendritic cells, and dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN is specifically involved in binding and the uptake of herpes simplex virus into dendritic cells (121, 135) . Another example of herpesvirus infections and dendritic cell interactions is illustrated with herpes simples virus-2, in which persistent localized inflammatory response in the dermis below herpetic lesions contains CCR5 or CXCR4+ve-CD4 cells with mixed dendritic cell populations that express dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN (185) . The latter suggests that the wide inflamed surface allowed more access to target cells especially with the anatomical proximity of dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN-rich dendritic cells (185) .\n\nA recent clinical study by our group (23) showed that the pool of blood myeloid dendritic cells CD1c + (BDCA-1) CD209 + expands in the peripheral blood of subjects with chronic periodontitis relative to healthy controls. This expansion of the myeloid dendritic cell pool was further increased upon scaling and root planing, due to the induced bacteremia. Moreover, in chronic periodontitis patients with existing acute coronary syndrome, the dendritic cell pool was further expanded relative to chronic periodontitis alone and healthy controls. We have previously reviewed other diseases reported to influence the blood myeloid dendritic cell pool (124) . The myeloid dendritic cells response in chronic periodontitis was not due to an overall increase in total peripheral blood mononuclear cells, nor was it due to a rise in canonical factors, the DC-poietins (e.g. CD135 ligand, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor/interleukin-4-, tumor necrosis factor receptor ligands I/II that would otherwise account for the increased myeloid dendritic cells in circulation. It appears that the expansion occurs due to the microbial carriage state of the dendritic cells and their progenitors, as a result of the bacteremia. The circulating myeloid dendritic cells were demonstrated to carry P. gingivalis, along with a diverse microbiome. Moreover, dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN + myeloid dendritic cells shown to contain P. gingivalis were identified within the coronary artery plaques in situ. As P. gingivalis targets CD209 for entry into myeloid dendritic cells via its glycoprotein fimbriae mfa-1 (180) , this phenomenon was proposed to have particular significance to the pathophysiology of both chronic periodontitis and cardiovascular disease. Chronic periodontitis and cardiovascular disease have been linked through epidemiologic studies, but the mechanisms involved in this association are still unclear (50) . The results of our studies indicate that the microbial carriage state of myeloid dendritic cells activates dendritic cell differentiation and promotes trafficking of these infected myeloid dendritic cells to sites of neovascularization such as diseased coronary arteries, thereby increasing the cardiovascular risk associated with chronic periodontitis (122) .\n\nAn important early aspect of dendritic cells function is microbial clearance, wherein the pathogens are taken up by receptor-mediated phagocytosis and subsequently processed for presentation to other immune cells. This process is a key mechanism in activation of the innate immune response and significantly affects the subsequent antigen-presenting function of dendritic cells (151, 168) . The process of phagocytosis itself provides important information about the nature of the engulfed targets so that the pathogen can be routed to appropriate intracellular compartments for tailoring of the immune/inflammatory response (168) . After phagocytosis, there are at least four pathways for lysosomal degradation in mammalian cells (126) : 1) the endocytic/phagocytic pathway (167) , 2) macroautophagy, involving isolation in an enclosed membrane in the cytoplasm (i.e. the autophagosome), that fuses with lysosomes for degradation (19, 55, 152) , 3) microautophagy, in which a small portion of cytoplasm is engulfed by a lysosome membrane itself (126) and 4) chaperonemediated autophagy (49) . These different mechanisms depend on the size and the nature of the insult, early recognition by pattern recognition receptors and the type of the phagocytic cell involved.\n\nMacroautophagy (or autophagy) is an intracellular bulk degradation system by which cytoplasmic components are directed to the lysosome in a membrane-mediated process (152, 179) . The autophagic pathway proceeds through several phases, including the initiation and formation of a pre-autophagosomal structure, the development of a phagophore (isolated membrane), followed by vesicle elongation and maturation (lysosomal fusion). In the final stage, autophagosomal contents are degraded by lysosomal acid hydrolases (28) . Autophagy is regulated by homologues of products of the autophagy-related genes, originally identified in yeast (127, 142) . Starvation is a potent environmental inducer of autophagy through inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway (104) . Conversely, growth factors, along with other nutrients, signal activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway that subsequently results in autophagy inhibition. Another important pathway for autophagy is Beclin 1-interacting complex, which consists of: 1) Beclin-1, BCL-2 family proteins that inhibit autophagy and 2) class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and autophagy-related gene ATG14L which is required for autophagy (83) . Autophagosomal elongation requires two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems: the autophagy-related protein 12 and the microtubuleassociated protein light chain 3-protein 8 conjugation systems. After elongation, the cytoplasmic microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 protein (LC3-II) is the active form that associates with the autophagosome formation until cargo degradation (128) . The presence of LC3-II discrete puncta on immunofluorescence analysis indicates autophagosome formation. Impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion may result in increases in the number of autophagosomes, as observed in several diseases (28, 142) .\n\nAutophagy was initially recognized as a mechanism for cellular homeostasis and protein turnover, especially in starvation responses. However, autophagy plays an important role in protein quality control (82, 101) , degradation of toxic proteins (141) and defense against bacterial pathogens (111, 133, 136) . For metabolic and antibacterial mechanisms, autophagy involves the formation of membrane vesicle autophagosomes, which then fuse with lysosomes to degrade its contents in a process similar to phagosomal maturation. Recently, autophagy has been shown to function in defense against microbes. For example, Shigella, an invasive bacterium, is reported to evade autophagy in hamster kidney cells by secreting the Shigella flexneri virulent factor IscB (136) . This study also reported that the mutant bacteria that lacks the S. flexneri virulent factor gene showed lower intracellular growth rates, which returned to normal growth levels in fibroblast cells with defective autophagy (Autophagy protein 5 Atg5 \u2212/\u2212 knockout) (136) . Another study reported that autophagy eliminates Streptococcus after it escapes the endosomes in non-phagocytic cells (132) .\n\nAutophagy is particularly active in macrophages and dendritic cells (6, 105, 111, 148) . Autophagy proteins in murine macrophages are required for the fusion of phagosomes (which contain toll-like receptor enveloped particles) with lysosomes (148) . Toll-like receptor engagement during phagocytosis rapidly stimulates recruitment of microtubuleassociated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) and Beclin 1 (autophagy factors) to the phagosomes, promoting rapid acidification and enhanced intracellular microbial killing in these macrophages (148) . Another study using human and murine macrophages identified Toll-like recepto-r4 as a sensor for autophagy (177) . They also showed that the signaling was TRIF-Toll-like receptor-4 dependent and did not affect the cell viability indicating that it is distinct from the autophagy cell death pathway. In addition, Toll-like receptor dependent autophagy overcomes phagosomal arrest and induces co-localization of Mycobacterium with autophagosomal structures (177) . The role that the autophagic machinery serves in these cells is not only for optimal fusion of phagosome or autophagosome with lysosomes, but is also involved in antigen presentation through the major histocompatibility complex. Autophagy proteins in dendritic cells are critical for the fusion of lysosomes with Toll-like receptor apoptotic cell antigens during major histocompatibility complex class II presentation (105).\n\nAs mentioned above, dendritic cells are professional phagocytes but are more versatile than neutrophils and macrophages. When in an immature state dendritic cells specialize in immediate pathogen clearance for which they express a wide spectrum of pattern recognition receptors (45, 92, 151) . Dendritic cells also are inclined to preserve epitopes required for antigen presentation to initiate the adaptive immune response (151) . They also possess a unique phagocytic machinery for controlled antigen processing and efficient presentation (15, 84, 146) . As dendritic cells mature, they upregulate antigen presenting apparatus which includes accessory molecules that prime and initiate a suitable adaptive immune response (15, 33, 84, 88, 144, 151) . Dendritic cells presumably need to be efficient in controlling and inhibiting the growth of intracellular pathogens, otherwise dendritic cells would be a significant niche for pathogen dissemination through the blood to distant organs, as reported for P. gingivalis (23) . Autophagy is recognized as an antibacterial lysosomal mechanism for dendritic cells, but also has an immunoregulatory component (13, 47, 94) . Although the mechanism of autophagy apparently serves dendritic cells well in most situations, very little is known about its role in elimination of specific intracellular pathogens, the pattern recognition receptors involved, and their positive or negative regulatory roles.\n\nPattern recognition receptors on innate immune cells recognize microbes through their pathogen associated molecular patterns (45, 92) . Pathogen associated molecular patterns are conserved groups of molecules expressed by microbes that are essential for microbial survival, such as bacterial or fungal cell wall components (e.g. lipopolysaccharide) and viral or bacterial nucleic acids. The classes of pattern recognition receptors in dendritic cells that sense pathogen associated molecular patterns include Toll-like receptors, NOD-like family receptors, CARD helicases and C-type lectin receptors (e.g. dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN). Activation of pattern recognition receptors stimulates receptor-specific intracellular signaling pathways that regulate transcription of response genes, such as those encoding co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines through transcription factors such as nuclear factor-\u03baB (45) . Although, endocytic and signaling receptors were considered separate mechanisms, emerging evidence actually shows tight links between endocytosis and signaling (158, 167, 168) . These connections were presumably made early in receptor evolution, along with links to autophagy in antigen presenting cells.\n\nThe role of toll-like receptors in autophagy bears many similarities with their role in phagosomal maturation. Toll-like receptor engagement is the characteristic difference between immune responses in apoptotic and phagocytic cellular machineries in phagocytes (17, 167) . For example, the activation of Toll-like receptors by bacteria has been reported to regulate phagosomal maturation and lysosomal activities in murine macrophages (17) and efficient antimicrobial autophagy (89, 105, 177) . Experiments in Toll-like receptor-2\u2212/\u2212 or Toll-like receptor-4 \u2212/\u2212 knockout mice have demonstrated lack of co-localization of engulfed bacteria with lysosomal markers within the cytoplasm (17) . These studies showed that the receptor recognition by the phagocytic cells of bacterial components is a decisive factor for the intracellular bacterial routing and intracellular degradative systems. Furthermore, a recent study on dendritic cells showed that lipopolysaccharide (a Toll-like receptor-4 ligand) and PAM3CYS4 (a Toll-like receptor-1/2) ligand) can induce autophagy in dendritic cells. Furthermore, autophagy is upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human gingival fibroblasts from periodontitis patients in the presence of P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (20) . Interestingly, dendritic cells obtained from Crohn's disease patients demonstrated defective autophagy responses. In addition, the induction of NOD2-mediated autophagy in these cells was required for bacterial handling and generation of major histocompatibility complex class II specific CD4 + T cells in dendritic cells (31) A mechanism by which toll-like receptors induce autophagy has been suggested as TRIF and MyD88 interact with autophagy protein, Beclin 1, resulting in disruption of its interaction with Bcl-2 (153) .\n\nTwo members of Nod-like receptor family, Nod1 and Nod2, have been reported to induce autophagy upon bacterial sensing. Nod1 agonists induced autophagy in epithelial cells, while Nod2 agonists induce autophagy in myeloid cells (164) . Peptidoglycan (Nod2 ligand) induces autophagy in human dendritic cells and enhances surface major histocompatibility complex class II antigen expression. In addition, Nod2 or autophagy factor (ATG16L1) knockdown reduced antigen-specific CD4 T-cell proliferative responses to dendritic cells infected with a Salmonella vector. Moreover, dendritic cells from Crohn's disease patients with NOD2 or ATG16L1 risk alleles have impaired induction of autophagy in response to Nod2 ligand, but not to the Toll-like receptor-2 ligand PAM3CYS4. Dendritic cells with Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 mutations have decreased co-localization of Salmonella typhimurium and adherent invasive Escherichia coli with lysosomes, and increased survival of intracellular adherent invasive E. coli. Hence, NOD2 stimulation induces autophagy in dendritic cells that subsequently augments major histocompatibility complex class II antigen presentation and bacterial targeting for lysosomal degradation (31) .\n\nAs mentioned earlier, dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN (CD209) is a C-type lectin receptor involved in pathogen uptake, signaling and antigen presentation in dendritic cells (64, 159, 180) . For uptake CD209 contains internalizing motifs in its cytoplasmic tail (184) . Interestingly, CD209 has been implicated in immune suppression and regulation in certain contexts (59, 60, 184) . Most notably CD209 is targeted for immune escape by several pathogens such as HIV, hepatitis C virus, human herpesvirus-8, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori and Streptococcus pneumoniae (79, 102, 140, 184) . Recently, we reported that dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN engagement by the minor fimbriae (Mfa-1) of P. gingivalis yields weak dendritic cell maturation and an immunosuppressive cytokine profile. In the absence of dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN targeting motif Mfa1, the same pathogen yields a very different dendritic cell response with high levels of interleukin-23 and interleukin-6 as well as induction of a T helper cell-1/T helper cell-17 type response (180, 181) . Furthermore, our study showed that the anaerobe P. gingivalis survives within dendritic cells in an aerobic atmosphere, while it dies rapidly in the absence of dendritic cells (180) . More recent investigations from our laboratory (unpublished data) revealed higher survival rates of P. gingivalis after dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN mediated uptake. This survival was associated with inhibition of LC3-II, Rab5 and LAMP1 expressions within human dendritic cells. Interestingly; the survival of this strain was inhibited within dendritic cells by autophagy induction. Alternatively, Mfa1 \u2212 P. gingivalis targets a non-CD209 route, mostly through Toll-like receptor-2, induced high expression of LC3-II and co-localized with Rab5/LAMP1 rich vesicles. Furthermore, P. gingivalis was enclosed in the characteristic double membrane phagophores, while escaping vesicle fusion after uptake via dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN (57) (Fig. 1) . The engagement of CD209 and Toll-like receptors activates distinct signaling pathways (45, 70) , which result in differential intracellular routing and processing of the microbe within dendritic cells. While Toll-like receptors promote phagosomal and autophagosomal maturation (177) and subsequent bacterial clearance (17, 167) , dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN seems to serve a counter-regulatory function. The latter observation can also be exemplified with the human immunodeficiency virus and dendritic cells interactions, in which HIV not only takes the advantage of dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN receptor permissibility to facilitate engulfment, but recent evidence suggests that the interaction can shut down autophagy mechanisms on dendritic cells (16) . Although HIV generally ends up in lysosomes after autophagocytosis, the process activates the mTOR pathway, which results in increased HIV-1 levels in dendritic cells and increased transmission to T cells. In fact, the pharmacological induction of autophagy by rapamycin increases HIV degradation and presentation to T cells (16) . Collectively, experimental evidence supports the concept that, since the immuno-regulatory machinery enclosed in dendritic cells could be exploited by certain pathogens, augmenting the innate immunity elements (e.g Toll-like receptors/autophagy crosstalk) could be a useful tool in tipping back the immune response toward efficient microbial clearance.\n\nPhagocytosis relies on a network of endocytic vesicles to deliver antigen load from early phagosomes to lysosomes for degradation. The bilayer phagosomes formed at the plasma membrane and composition of these membranes gains a unique character depending on the type of pattern recognition receptors engaged during phagocytosis (18) . The maturation of the phagosome will not necessarily proceed through similar steps in different phagocytic cells. Moreover, different phagosomal maturation pathways have been reported in the same cell type. These different pathways are dictated primarily by the cargo contained in the phagosomes, as well as by external signals and the activation and/or differentiation state of phagocytes (69) . In other words, \"all phagosomes are not created equal and there is a significant degree of phagosome heterogeneity and individuality\" (18) . In this regard dendritic cells seem very well equipped for such heterogeneity in phagosome pathways. The functional organization of the dendritic cell phagocytic pathway is unique in several aspects such as: 1) the ability of dendritic cells to export proteins from the phagosome to the cytosol (146), 2) the characteristic cross-presentation and subsequent cross-priming by dendritic cells to defeat viral immune evasion strategies and promote self-antigen tolerance (15, 84) , 3) evidence of a phagosomal active system of alkalinization in dendritic cells which suppress acidification within the phagosomes specially for the first few hours after pathogen engulfment (150, 151) . The complex phagosomal system in dendritic cells is therefore designed to suit its crucial role as a link between innate and adaptive immune responses as well as link between systemic and peripheral immunity.\n\nDendritic cell phagophores contain a wide range of esterases, reductases as well as endopeptidase. The majority of the proteases in dendritic cells belong to the group of cysteine proteases, such as cathepsins S, B, H, and L; the aspartate proteases cathepsins D and E; or the asparagine endopeptidase (87, 107) . Characteristically, dendritic cell proteases have a lower degradative potency than those within macrophages (44) . These low lysosomal activities in dendritic cells could be due to a reduced concentration of proteases (44) or the expression of protease inhibitors (cystatin family) within intracellular vesicles (80, 154) . Dendritic cells express several members of the cystatin family of protease inhibitors that inhibit lysosomal protease activity by obstructing their active site. Some of them are present in lysosomes and most likely contribute to restricting proteolytic activity in dendritic cell lysosomes and phagosomes (154) . It seems that the phagosomal machinery within dendritic cells is set to partially degrade rather than completely eliminate the target.\n\nPH is a critical rate-regulating factor for protease activity in phagocytes. Basically, the acidic pH enhances the accessibility of proteases to target proteins by denaturation. However, each class of enzymes requires a specific range of pH for optimal activity (151) . The optimal pH of proteolytic enzymes provides a system with a crucial adaptability function that suits the role of each phagocyte. For instance, studying the acidification in immature dendritic cells showed no change in pH at 3 hours after engulfment, contrary to the immediate drop of pH in macrophages. This was not only due to low vacuolar-type H+ -ATPase (V-ATPase) pump but also due to an active alkalinization of the phagosomes in dendritic cells (150) . The active alkalinization process in dendritic cells was assumed to resemble the NADPH oxidase process in neutrophils. However, the NAPDPH oxidase activity in dendritic cells is negligible compared to neutrophils (58) . It has been proposed that this weak generation of reactive oxygen species in dendritic cells is due to endogenous inhibitors, which could be abolished by pro-inflammatory signals. Reactive oxygen species production was also improved in dendritic cells by Toll-like receptor ligation and T-cell interactions (118, 170) . Although dendritic cells and neutrophils (but not macrophages) show active alkalinization processes, the kinetics and intensities are different. Whereas neutrophil phagosomes 'actively' raise the pH to 8 for 15 minutes, dendritic cells phagosomes maintain high pH for several hours. As suggested by others, this extended alkalinization process could be due to a microbicidal oxidase system contained in the vesicles or due to \"inhibitory lysosome-related organelles\" within dendritic cells that consumes O 2 and H + to produce ROS within the phagosomal lumen (150) . This highly controlled machinery allows dendritic cells to preserve the useful epitope information of the antigen for ultimate presentation. However, it could also be exploited by certain pathogens to evade intracellular degradation thereby using dendritic cells as a protective niche for persistence and systemic dissemination. A significant factor in regulation of phagosomes in dendritic cells is their maturity state. In immature dendritic cells, V-ATPase cytosolic component is inefficiently assembled to the membrane subunits on lysosomes. This results in poor lysosomal acidification. In contrast, in mature dendritic cells vacuolar-type H+ -ATPase (V-ATPase) was fully assembled and efficient acidification was restored (165) . Interestingly, we recently reported that dendritic cells infected through dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN maintain the immature form and displayed a reduced apoptotic rate (122) . In addition, bacteria targeting dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN were able to survive at a higher rate for a longer time within these immature dendritic cells (57) . Typically, immature dendritic cells have a short life due to active apoptosis being initiated shortly after maturation, presumably to avoid immune overstimulation (26, 32) . CD209 engagement seems to alter this homeostatic balance. It also appears to negatively influence the ability of dendritic cells to expel intracellular cargo by pyroptosis (122) . The antibacterial autophagy pathway aims to route the cargo for fusion with lysosomes to facilitate final degradation. Hence, several intracellular pathogens are suggested to block autophagosomal maturation by hindering lysosome fusion or inhibiting autophagy protein-dependent fusion with the lysosome. Interestingly, some reports suggest that certain pathogens use autophagosomes for replication by blocking autophagosomal maturation (5, 13, 53) . One of the earliest studies describing such a mechanism was with P. gingivalis, where it traffics to autophagosomes to evade conventional endocytic trafficking to lysosomes in endothelial cells (14) . However, in our recent results, P. gingivalis seems to be using an alternative tactic in myeloid dendritic cells involving evasion of the autophagic capture through early engagement with CD209 receptor (57) .\n\nPhagosomal maturation is heterogeneous, with variation being derived predominantly from receptor-ligand interactions. When microbes (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium) engage Toll-like receptor receptors, they are delivered to lysosomes at an inducible rate manifested by increased clearance and phagolysosomal fusion (174) . However, slower phagolysosome maturation has been detected in pathogen interactions involving C-type lectin family and scavenger receptors. Porphyromonas gingivalis, by virtue of its fimbriae, is capable of engagement of at least two different classes of pattern recognition receptors in dendritic cells, the C-type lectin DC-SIGN and Toll-like receptors using the mfa-1 (minor) and fimA (major) fimbriae, respectively (180) . In addition, the expression of these fimbriae could be altered by environmental conditions (176) . This suggests that major and minor fimbriae may control the intracellular routing of P. gingivalis within the dendritic cells and shift the phagosomal maturation of intracellular vesicles containing the microbe. Studying the phagosomal maturation in dendritic cells after P. gingivalis phagocytosis could reveal an important mechanism for P. gingivalis survival through manipulation of CD209-Toll-like receptor-2 signaling. This could profoundly impact upon, not only P. gingivalis survival within dendritic cells, but dendritic cell maturation and T-cell activation at secondary lymphoid organs and oral lymphoid foci at chronic periodontitis sites (95) (96) (97) .\n\nDefective autophagy has been associated with microbial survival, but also with several other chronic inflammatory conditions. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the small intestine characterized by inflammatory alterations in the mucosal barrier combined with failure of microbial clearance. A genome-wide association study revealed the potential involvement of autophagy proteins in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Genetic defects in NOD2, Immunity-related GTPase family M protein IRGM and the Autophagy-related protein 16 ATG161L1 were suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Although, IRGM protein was reported as an autophagy inducer during the elimination of mycobacterium, its role in microbial elimination in Crohn's has not been tested yet (12) . However, dendritic cells from Crohn's disease patients with the high risk NOD2 mutation showed defects in autophagy induction as well as altered expression of inflammatory signaling (31) . In human dendritic cells, NOD2 is required for induction of autophagy and subsequent efficient antigen presentation to CD4 + T cells. In this context, the role of NOD2 in the regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators was crucial in the pathogenic process. Indeed, the recently established link between NOD2 and autophagy helps to clarify the links between NOD2 defects and the manifestations of Crohn's disease. Hence, it seems that dendritic cells with defective-NOD2 maintain the presence of opportunistic microbes and the pro-inflammatory signals that trigger intestinal inflammation.\n\nChronic periodontitis is initiated by an interaction between bacterial components of oral biofilms and host response mechanisms (162) . The pathogenicity of chronic periodontitis involves excessive activation of innate and adaptive immune response and/or failure of sufficient T cell polarization for its resolution. This continuous immune activation is influenced by unique microbial complex (i.e. biofilm) at the oral mucosal interface; however, certain microbes (e.g. P. gingivalis) are able to infect and penetrate the epithelial barrier. In addition, this persistent immune activation induces endotoxin tolerance, which can prevent excessive immune responses, but can also prevent microbial clearance (129) (130) (131) . Porphyromonas gingivalis has been called a 'keystone' species in the oral microbial community due to its ability to influence the entire biofilm and contribute to innate immune mediated pathogenesis (39) . In chronic periodontitis, P. gingivalis exhibits several virulence factors, which include endotoxin, cysteine proteinases (gingipains), hemagglutinins, and its adhesive fimbriae (72, 75) . Still, P. gingivalis ability to invade cells and survive within, particularly in migratory cells, raises the spectre of systemic dissemination and contribution to chronic diseases [e.g. cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus (67, 143) ]. We have been interested for some time in the communication between P. gingivalis fimbriae with host immune elements. The two adhesins of P. gingivalis, termed the mfa-1 (minor) and fimA (major) fimbriae have been shown to play roles in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease in the rat model (166) . Several lines of evidence show that P. gingivalis fimbriae are essential in the communication with the innate immune system (and thus the adaptive immune system) through Toll-like receptor-2/4, as well as through integrins and complement receptor 3 and CD14 (4, 73, 74, 132, 172) .\n\nThe minor fimbriae are comprised of a 67 kDa protein which is encoded by the mfa1 gene (81) and is glycosylated with CD209 ligands fucose, mannose and N-acetyl galactosamine.\n\nAlthough little was known about the cellular receptors targeted by the minor (mfa1) fimbriae, our recent study showed that the minor fimbria targets dendritic cell specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrins (CD209) on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells for entry. In addition, interplay between major and minor fimbriae of P. gingivalis play critical and counter-regulatory roles in dendritic cell maturation and T cell responses (180) . Specifically, CD209 ligation by minor fimbriated P. gingivalis results in immature dendritic cells with a low pro-inflammatory cytokine profile and low allostimulatory response. On the contrary, fimA + P. gingivalis strains lacking minor mfa-1 fimbriae induce more robust dendritic cell maturation with a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response and an allostimulatory profile. In DC-CD4+ T cell co-culture conditions, P. gingivalis strains expressing only the minor fimbriae induced dendritic cells to prime na\u00efve T cells into T helper cell-2 effectors. Alternatively, P. gingivalis strains expressing only the major fimbriae induced dendritic cells to prime na\u00efve T cells into Th 1 subtype (180) . These and other in vitro findings are summarized in Table 1 . This distinction in dendritic cell responses to the P. gingivalis strains can be understood in the context of intracellular trafficking of these strains within dendritic cells and antigen presentation functions of dendritic cells. This is evidenced from our recent observations for the ability of mfa1+ P. gingivalis to evade autophagic vesicles (LC3 +ve ) after dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN uptake by dendritic cells (57) . In the intracellular milieu of the dendritic cells, P. gingivalis can exploit the controlled proteolysis process. However, the fate of P. gingivalis is sealed early in the process by CD209-Toll-like receptor-2 manipulation [reviewed in (76)) leading to differential endosomal and phagosomal routing, P. gingivalis survival and dendritic cell activation.\n\nBacterial pathogens exhibit several mechanisms by which they can avoid elimination by host cells. Certain intracellular pathogens can evade antibacterial autophagy by several mechanisms that range from evading the early recognition to inhibition of protease activity within lysosomes. For instance, Listeria monocytogenes masks itself from recognition of autophagic machinery by the formation of a propulsive actin tail (54) . Listeria monocytogenes surface protein, ActA, recruits host actin polymerization apparatus (Arp2/3 and Ena/VASP) to polymerize and elongate the actin tail on the bacterial surface. In addition, L monocytogenes seems to harbor another 'anti'-autophagic protein (In1K). Although, the mechanism of In1k is yet unclear, the lack of both In1k and Acta1 causes more bacteria to be targeted by autophagy than Acta1 sole defect (54) .\n\nAnother mechanism by which microbes can resist autophagy is through inhibition of critical steps of autophagosome formation or maturation. Legionella pneumophila shows the ability to de-conjugate LC3-II and lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (29) . LC3 conjugation with phosphatidylethanolamine on the vacuole membrane is a crucial step in autophagosome elongation and development. Legionella pneumophila RavZ protein irreversibly inhibits vesicle development \"shielding\" the microbe within these vacuoles despite early autophagic recognition. Modulation of autophagosomal maturation is also a widely used mechanism by several intracellular pathogens (13) . For instance, Anaplasma phagocytophilum has been reported to secrete Ats-1 protein which induces autophagy through Beclin-1 (134) , however, the vacuoles formed fail to fuse with lysosomes, providing a double-membrane vacuole for microbe survival.\n\nBacterial persistence can result from active evasion of the degradative machinery component of autophagy, but the mechanism underlying this evasion involves inflammatory signaling pathways. For example, Yersinia spp. recruits YopJ protein, which inactivates several levels of the MAPK pathway. In addition, YopJ induces apoptosis and secretion of caspase-1 by inhibiting IKK\u03b2 (nuclear factor-\u03baB subunit) (119, 125) . Shigella spp. are reported to regulate nuclear factor-\u03baB through secretion of IpaH (E3 ligases) type III secreted effector proteins (7) . Escherichia coli and Burkholderia pseudomallei use similar approaches by secretion of Cif and CHBP (type-III secreted effectors, which de-activate nuclear factor-\u03baB by blocking the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 (nuclear factor-\u03baB inhibitor) (34) . Alternatively, Shigella spp. decrease the acute inflammatory responses by type-III secreted protein (OspF), which specifically inhibits MAPKs. It seems that microbes can suppress certain pathways and activate others to their advantage. Certain species attempt to hinder acute responses while augmenting chronic immune activation. This concept could be exploited through pharmacological induction of autophagy and its potential scheme in the treatment of chronic infectious diseases (28) . One of the important candidates for such a strategy is sirolimus (mammalian target of rapamycin-mTOR-inhibitors). Rapamycin functions through inhibition of the mTOR pathway in mammalian cells and has been widely used to augment the anti-microbial properties of immune cells, while serving an immunosuppressive role (28, 51) . Recently, we showed that rapamycin impairs intracellular survival of P. gingivalis strains that utilize the CD209 dependent route to evade autophagy (57) . This could be particularly relevant to treatment of chronic periodontitis and other chronic persistent microbial infections (122, 124, 180, 181) .\n\nOne of the earliest studies providing the first clue that autophagy up-regulation may be beneficial in the treatment of infectious diseases was in 1998. The study showed that genetic up-regulation of the autophagy gene Becl-1 protected mice against the lethal alphavirus encephalitis in neuronal tissues (113) . Later, several studies reported that important pathogens are degraded in vitro by autophagy, including group A Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, S. flexneri, Salmonella enterica, L. monocytogenes and Francisella tularensis; viruses such as herpes simplex virus type 1 and chikungunya virus; and parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii (46, 98) . In addition, in vivo data showed the involvement of key autophagy genes could be protective against certain pathogens e.g. L monocytogenes, M. tuberculosis and T. gondii (71, 98) . Such evidence suggested pharmacological induction of autophagy as a promising approach against certain persistent pathogens.\n\nBesides the antimicrobial effect of autophagy induction, the immune regulatory arm of autophagy seems also to be beneficial. Autophagy showed regulatory actions in the innate and adaptive immune elements (as described above). Of particular interest, induction of autophagy seems to augment antimicrobial innate immunity while preventing the excessive inflammatory responses. Hence, autophagy induction has great potential especially in targeting chronic infections diseases such as periodontitis. For instance, autophagy can enhance type I interferon production and innate immune responses by delivering viral nucleic acids to endosomal Toll-like receptors. However, autophagy also was reported to control cellular levels of reactive oxygen species production, which prevent the response from being excessive (147) . Regarding adaptive immunity, it was reported that autophagy protein-5 is required for dendritic cells to process and present extracellular microbial antigens for major histocompatibility complex class II presentation (105) . In addition, autophagy also enhances the presentation of endogenous viral antigens on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules as well as cross presentation for tumor cell antigens in dendritic cells (61, 105, 112) . The link between autophagy and antigen presenting cells suggests that pharmacological induction of autophagy may be beneficial not only in the treatment of acute infection but also in enhancing vaccine efficacy. In mice dendritic cells, autophagy induction with rapamycin enhanced the efficacy of the Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine by increasing peptide processing and presentation (90) .\n\nDrugs that modulate autophagy can be classified broadly as mTOR-dependent andindependent agents. Rapamycin and its analogues (CCI-79, AP23573 and RAD001) inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR and subsequently induce autophagy in primary cell culture, mammalian cells and in vivo (90, 111, 114) . Sirolimus (rapamycin) is a clinically approved immuno-suppressive and anti-cancer drug, hence it exerts pleiotropic effects where it induces autophagy and down-regulates excessive inflammatory mediators (28) . However, it is important to note that the mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR regulates several biological pathways and more specific targeted therapy may be required. Another similar approach was studied by targeting 5' AMP-activated protein kinase activity, which induces autophagy by mTOR inhibition and the serine/threonine-protein kinase ULK1 (autophagy transcriptional factor) activation (1) . Autophagy can also be induced by inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, using agents like lithium, carbamazepine and valproic acid (149) . It has been suggested that these drugs induce autophagy through reduction in mitochondrial uptake of Ca +2 released by the Ins(l, 4, 5)P3 receptor, which causes a mild defect in mitochondrial respiration and 5' AMP-activated protein kinase activation (22) . However, these agents have several additional targets that could limit their application in the treatment of simple infections conditions (86) . Recently the US Food and Drug Administrtion approved pharmacological agents have been identified for the mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR-independent autophagy. This group included: clonidine and rilmenidine (imida-zoline receptor), calpain inhibitors and verapamil (1-type Ca2+ channels) (175) . Many of these drugs are used for the treatment of hypertension, cluster headaches and angina. In addition, they seem to have favorable safety profiles. However, further investigation is needed to clarify their autophagic induction properties. Some reports (as described earlier) did not recognize autophagy as an antibacterial mechanism but suggested that certain pathogens use autophagosomes for replication by blocking autophagosomal maturation (5, 13, 53) . These observations shaped the need for agents that do not regulate the autophagic process as whole, but specifically target certain levels of autophagosomal formation and maturation (lysosomal fusion). In addition, a promising therapeutic strategy tackles the microbial properties that antagonize antibacterial autophagy. For instance, S. flexneri and L. monocytogenes discussed earlier) are able to secrete proteins that enable them to escape autophagy recognition by the autophagic machinery (54, 136) . Presumably, inhibition of these virulence factors would provide a safer and more therapeutic specific approach. This will entail specific approaches to individually address each type of infection and even the targeted host cells. One recent approach that investigated the interaction between the autophagy gene Bec-1 and Phosphoinositide 3kinase revealed a candidate peptide (Tat-becline 1) for inducing anti-bacterial autophagy. Tat-becline 1 specifically induced autophagy and subsequently decreased replications of several pathogens including HIV and reduced mortality rates in mice infected with lethal West Nile viruses (155) . This substantial line of evidence shows that autophagy has diverse functions in innate and adaptive immune responses with a crucial role in the chronic infectious diseases. A thorough understanding of initiation, development and regulation of the processes is therefore necessary in order to design efficient therapeutic strategies.\n\nThe pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis encompasses innate and adaptive immune responses. Both have a destructive and protective potential, depending on the microbial insult and host susceptibility. Actually, the disease illustrates the \"double edged sword\" of immune responses where the principal clinical signs of the disease are the result of activated immuno-inflammatory mechanisms rather than direct effects of the bacteria. However, microbial elements are essential for the initiation of periodontitis and bacterial virulence factors are decisive in the disease progression. Substantial evidence from different studies indicates that the disease is a combination of hyper-responsive immune mechanisms along with failure of microbial clearance. Autophagy could add a new dimension in understanding the multifactorial basis of chronic inflammatory conditions such as periodontitis. In addition, therapeutic strategies tackling autophagy regulation could present a very promising approach in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.\n\nIn conclusion, we see promotion of autophagy as integral to restoration of immune homeostasis; hence essential for resolution of infection in periodontitis. Fig. 2 illustrates our hypothesis model for the sake of clarity. Recognition by dendritic cells of the oral pathogen P. gingivalis through either dendritic cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN-dependent orindependent routes (the latter probably dominated by Toll-like receptor mediated signaling) results in a very different outcome. The first scenario blocks autophagy, favoring pathogen survival and differentiation of long-lived immature immunoregulatory or suppressive dendritic cells that may favor immune dysregulation via altered inducible regulatory T cell function. The second scenario promotes autophagy and bacterial degradation, resulting in mature immunostimulatory dendritic cells that promote effective immune responses capable of long-term resolution of infection. The use of autophagy promoters could favor the latter scenario and promote periodontitis resolution, may represent a novel therapeutic approach in the search of a \"cure\" for periodontal disease in humans.\n\nAuthor Manuscript\n\nEl-Awady et al. \n\nLocal histopathology in chronic periodontitis patients \u2193 Langerhans cells in epithelium (96) , \u2191maturing dendritic cells (95) and DC-SIGN + myeloid dendritic cells in lamina propria (98) , \u2191dendritic cells/T-cell conjugates (95) .\n\nBlood myeloid dendritic cells in chronic periodontitis patients \u2191non-canonical myeloid dendritic cell expansion, \u2191 P. gingivalis content of blood dendritic cells, dissemination of minor fimbriae-1 + P. gingivalis to atherosclerotic plaques (23) .
