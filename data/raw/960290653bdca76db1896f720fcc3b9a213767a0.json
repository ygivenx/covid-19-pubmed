{"title": "Supplemental Information Selective Bottlenecks Shape Evolutionary Pathways Taken during Mammalian Adaptation of a 1918-like Avian Influenza Virus", "body": "Mut index 3, day 5 n = 13 S113N + D265V S113N I187T I187T + D265V D265V WT Due to read length limitations of Illumina sequencing, we were unable to determine whether HA mutations S113N and D265V were linked using our haplotype analysis. To determine whether these two mutations were encoded on the same HA molecules in infected animals, we cloned and sequenced full length HA from HA190D225D index and contact 3, and from the Mut index animals on day 5. The fraction of clones containing each mutation combination are shown as different colors within the pie chart and the number of clones sequenced is displayed below each. (a) On day 5 in HA190D225D index animal 3, we acquired 20 HA clones, of which 5/20 (25%) encoded only S113N, 5/20 (25%) encoded only D265V, 2/20 (10%) encoded both S113N and D265V together, and the remaining 8/20 (40%) contained neither mutation (WT). (b) On day 5 in HA190D225D contact animal 3, we sequenced 32 clones, of which 25/32 (78.125%) encoded S113N alone, 4/32 (12.5%) encoded D265V alone, 1/32 (3.125%) encoded both S113N and D265V together and 4/32 (6.25%) encoded neither mutation. (c) For day 5 in Mut index animal 1, we were only able to acquire 6 clones. 2/6 (33%) encoded S113N and D265V together, 2/6 (33%) encoded I187T and D265V together, and 2/6 (33%) encoded D265V alone. I187T and S113N were not detected in any of the 6 clones without D265V also present, although the small number of clones we were able to acquire may not fully capture the diversity present in the viral population at that timepoint. (d) For day 5 in Mut index animal 3, we sequenced 13 clones. 1/13 clones (7.69%) encoded both S113N and D265V, 5/13 (38.46%) encoded both D265V and I187T together, and 7/13 (53.85%) encoded D265V alone. Again, S113N and I187T were not found in any sequences that did not also contain D265V. This figure shows the same data as Fig. 5 , except that the \u03c0 statistic was calculated using PoPoolation software, rather than SNPGenie, and corrected for potential template resampling. (a) The first transmission event is characterized by a loose genetic bottleneck, in which a minor, and not statistically significant, reduction in both synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity is observed across almost every gene segment. (b, c) After further adaptation, transmission in both Mut pairs is characterized by a selective sweep over the HA1 region of HA, resulting in a significant reduction in nucleotide diversity centered over HA1. In Mut pair 1 (b), nucleotide diversity is increased or only slightly decreased in all gene segments excluding HA after transmission. In Mut pair 3 (c), nucleotide diversity is reduced most strongly in HA but also across the other gene segments, suggesting the possible combination of a selective sweep and a small founding population size. (d-f) Because the exact day that transmission occurred is not known, we compared changes in nucleotide diversity using both the index animal day 5 and day 3 timepoints. The comparison using day 5 is shown in the main text in Fig. 5 and the same data using the index animal day 3 data are shown here. (d) As in Fig. 5 , during transmission between the HA190D225D pair, both synonymous and nonsynonymous diversity are slightly reduced across the genome, with the exception of a large reduction in M2 synonymous diversity. (e and f) In Mut pairs 1 and 3, nonsynonymous diversity is reduced the most significantly in HA1. In Mut pair 1 (e) synonymous and nonsynonymous diversity are only slightly decreased or increased across the rest of the genome, while in Mut pair 3 (f), diversity is also reduced in other genome segments, possibly due to a founder effect. Table S1 , related to Experimental Procedures. Primer sequences used for PCR. Segments were amplified using specific PCR primers as listed above. Nei and Gojobori's (1986) method of estimating synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions from next-generation sequencing data (Nelson et al., 2015) . These estimates were performed using deep sequence data subsampled such that each base position is covered by approximately 5000x coverage. The second set of values represent those calculated from deep sequence data subsampled such that each base position is covered by 1000x coverage using PoPoolation. For both, red values highlight genes with \u03c0N/\u03c0S ratios greater than 1, suggesting that diversity is favored at these loci. With the exception of the HA gene, most of the influenza genome is under purifying selection during replication at all time points. Shown are every mutation detected in at least 1% of all sequencing reads for every timepoint in the index and contact animals in the HA190D225D and Mut transmitting pairs. Amino acid changes are represented in H3 mature peptide numbering as is shown in the manuscript. Mutations occurring within the signal peptide are numbered with reference to the amino acid number within the signal peptide and are denoted by \"(SP)\" in the amino acid change column. Mutations occurring before the signal peptide are denoted as \"non-coding\" in the amino acid change column. Nucleotide changes are shown in reference to the original 1918-like avian influenza virus. Syn indicates that the mutation was synonymous, i.e., did not cause a change in amino acid. \"SNP\" denotes a single nucleotide polymorphism and \"fs\" denotes a frameshift mutation. We queried every polymorphic nucleotide site in HA that occurred more than once in the study, i.e., in either more than 1 animal or in more than 1 timepoint. This resulted in a final query of 12 nucleotide positions (400, 507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653, 747, 748, 749, and 868) , which encode 9 amino acid substitutions (113, 145, 159, 187, 189, 190, 192, 225, and 265) . Due to the limits imposed by the average fragment length of the input sequencing library, we were unable to query all of the sites of interest in HA in a single window. We therefore analyzed each sample with two overlapping windows. Window 1 covered 9 nucleotide sites (634, 640, 644, 648, 653, 747, 748, 749 and 868) and window 2 covered 8 nucleotide sites (400, 507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653) . Each haplotype was given an arbitrary number as shown in the left-most column. For each window, the nucleotide and amino acid positions queried are displayed in the first row in bold. For each unique haplotype, the identity of the nucleotide and corresponding amino acid identified at that position are shown.
