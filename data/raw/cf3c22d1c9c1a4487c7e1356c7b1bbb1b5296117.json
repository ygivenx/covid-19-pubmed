{"title": "Phage display technique identifies the interaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus open reading frame 6 protein with nuclear pore complex interacting protein NPIPB3 in modulating Type I interferon antagonism", "body": "The pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) arose from Guangdong Province of China in November 2002, and eventually infected > 8500 people worldwide. 1, 2 The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which emerged from the Arabian Peninsula in 2012, was globally identified in 941 laboratory-confirmed cases with 347 related deaths until December 26, 2014, according to the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/csr/don/ 26-december-2014-mers/en/). The CoV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of w30 kb; it contains 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs) and encodes replicase (ORF1a and ORF1ab), structural proteins (spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope), and accessory proteins (ORF 3a, ORF 3b, ORF6, ORF 7a, ORF 7b, ORF 8a, ORF 8b, and ORF 9b). 3 These accessory proteins could be dispensable for virus replication, but might have a specific function in viral infection. ORF3 and ORF 7a proteins activate JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa B) signaling, upregulate interleukin-8 and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted), and modulate apoptosis and cell cycle. 4, 5 ORF 3b and ORF6 proteins modulate the host innate immune response, including inhibition of Type I IFN production and signaling. 4, 5 The SARS-CoV ORF6 protein localizes in the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus in infected cells 6 ; ORF6 overexpression triggers the ER stress in transfected cells. 7 The ORF6 protein is dispensable for viral replication in vitro and in vivo, 8 but associates with viral escape from the innate immune system, particularly inhibition of Type I interferon (IFN) production and signaling pathways. 7, 9 ORF6 protein interacts with the C terminus of karyopherin alpha 2, leading to impeding the nuclear import of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) in response to IFN-b. Thus, SARS-CoV ORF6 protein is an antagonist of Type I IFNs. In this study, we identified cellular ORF6-interacting factors using phage display human lung cDNA library, further examining the association of SARS-CoV ORF6 and host factors in Type I IFN antagonism. The C terminus of nuclear pore complex interacting protein NPIPB3 (nuclear pore complex interacting protein family, member B3; Gene ID: 23117), also known as phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3-kinase-related kinase SMG-1 isoform 1 homolog, displayed on phage surface showed the highest binding affinity to recombinant ORF6 protein. The interaction of ORF6 and NPIPB3 was analyzed using coimmunoprecipitation in vitro and colocalization in cells. The effect of NPIPB3 overexpression on Type I IFN antagonism of ORF6 was determined using dual-luciferase reporter assay system, and STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation.\n\nConstruction and expression of recombinantORF6 protein in Escherichia coli and human promocyte HL-CZ cells For generating bacterial and mammalian expression of recombinant ORF6 protein, the SARS-CoV ORF6 gene of the SARS-CoV TW1 strain genome (GenBank Accession No. AY291451) was amplified by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from genome RNA template and cloned into the pTriE-4 Neo vector for the production of the recombinant ORF6 protein fused with an N-terminal His-tag. The primers included 5 0 -ATCGGAATTC-TATGTTTCATCCGTT-3 0 and 5 0 -ATCGGCGGCCGCTGGATAAT-CTAACTC-3 0 . The forward primer contained an EcoRI restriction site; the reverse primer included a NotI restriction site. The amplified RT-PCR product was cloned into the pTriEx-4 Neo vector (Novagen, Madison, Wisconsin, USA), resulting in construct named pTriEx-ORF6. For the production of E. coli-synthesized ORF6 protein, pTriEx-ORF6 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The induction expression and purification of E. coli-synthesized ORF6 protein were performed as described in our prior reports. 10, 11 Finally, the recombinant ORF6 protein was purified using immobilized-metal affinity chromatography as described in our previous study, 12 and then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-His-tag monoclonal antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antimouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. The immunoreactive band was developed with tetranitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-idolylphosphate (TNBT/BCIP) (Gibco, Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium) (Invitrogen).\n\nFor identifying ORF6-interacting proteins, a human lung cDNA library (Novagen, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) was used to screen high-affinity phage clones to recombinant ORF6, as previously described. 10, 11 Briefly, biopanning of the phage display lung cDNA library was performed using ORF6coated microplates. After five rounds of biopanning, ORF6interacting phage clones were eluted with the soluble ORF6 protein. The ORF6-interacting phage clone was randomly picked up from individual plaques, amplified in E. coli, and then used for determining the binding affinity to the recombinant ORF6 protein using direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The nucleotide sequences of ORF6interacting proteins displayed on the high-affinity phage clones were directly sequenced; their deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed using BLAST search (http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).\n\nThe nucleotide sequences of the C terminus (amino acid residues 936e1050) of NPIPB3 (Accession Number Q92617) fused with the coat protein of ORF6-interacting phage clone 40 was amplified using PCR, and then cloned into bacterial expression vector pET32a for coimmunoprecipitation in vitro and mammalian expression vector pDsRed1-C (BD Biosciences Clontech) for colocalization assay. The two primer pairs were 5 0 -ATCGGATATCTCAAGCGAGGCAGAAAAA-3 0 and 5 0 -ATCGGAATTCGCTCAACCTCCGCCTCTT-3 0 for pET32a cloning, as well as 5 0 -ATCGATGAAGCTTATTCAAGCGAGGCA-GAA-3 0 and 5 0 -ATCGATGGGATCCGCTCAA-CCTCCGCCTCTT-3 0 for pDsRed1-C cloning, respectively. For coimmunoprecipitation assays, E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with pET32a-NPIPB3; the E. coli-synthesized C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 protein was induced and purified using immobilized-metal affinity chromatography as described in our prior studies. 10e12 The recombinant C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 with a thioredoxin (Trx) at the N terminus and a Histag at the C terminus was mixed with the recombinant ORF6 protein with an N-terminal His-Tag; the mixture was incubated with the anti-TrxmAb overnight in a cool room, followed by addition of protein A-Sepharose beads for an additional 2 hours. After centrifugation (16,000 \u00c2 g, 15 minutes), the immunoprecipitate was analyzed using Western blotting with the anti-His tag mAb for a 1-hour incubation period. The immune-reactive complexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG antibodies, and then developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For colocalization assays, pTriEx-ORF6 plus pDsRed1-C (BD Biosciences Clontech), pTriEx-ORF6 plus pDsRed-NPIPB3, pTriEx plus pDsRed1-C, or pTriEx plus pDsRed-NPIPB3 were cotransfected into HL-CZ cells (human promonocyte cell line) with GenePorter reagent. Transfected cells were generated, fixed, and stained with primary antibodies against His-tag, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antimouse IgG antibodies, as described in our previous studies. 13, 14 A confocal image of stained cells was taken using Leica TCS SP2 AOBS laser scanning microscopy (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg GmbH, Germany). In cells, red fluorescence indicated DsRed-NPIPB3 fusion protein, whereas green fluorescence was ORF6-His tag fusion protein. The colocalization of DsRed-NPIPB3 and ORF6 appeared orange to yellow in color.\n\nDual-luciferase reporter assay of IFN stimulated response element promoter HL-CZ cells expressing single and both of ORF6 and NPIPB3, described above, were further cotransfected with pISRE-Luc cis-reporter (Stratagene) and control reporter pRluc-C1, treated with IFN-b (Hoffmann-La Roche) for 4 hours, and then harvested. The activity of experimental firefly luciferase and control renilla luciferase in lysate was measured using dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and TROPIX TR-717 Luminometer (Applied Biosystems) described by Lin et al. 11 Subcellular localization assays of STAT1 HL-CZ cells expressing single and both of ORF6 and NPIPB3, described above, were treated with IFN-b (Hoffmann-La Roche) for 1 hour, and then harvested. Cells were fixed by cold methanol, incubated with anti-STAT1 mAb for 2 hours, followed by FITC-conjugated antimouse IgG antibodies for additional 2 hours. Finally, cells were stained with 4 0 ,6diamidino-2-phenylindole for 10 minutes. Photographs of cells were taken using immunofluorescent microscopy.\n\nFor testing the effect of ORF6 and NPIPB3 interaction on IFNstimulated STAT1 activation, lysate from cells expressing single and both of ORF6 and NPIPB3 treated with IFN-b for 15 minutes and 30 minutes was obtained using Western blotting with antiphosphotyrosine STAT1 (Tyr701), and anti-b actin mAb (Cell Signaling Technology). The immune-reactive bands were probed using horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat antimouse IgG antibodies, and then developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents.\n\nThree independent experiments in each independent result were performed; all data are represented as mean AE standard deviation and statistically analyzed using SPSS software (version 10.1; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) via one-way analysis of variance analysis by Scheffe's test.\n\nSelection of SARS-CoV ORF6-interacting host facts using phage display library SARS-CoV ORF6, cloned into the pTriEx-4 vector, was synthesized as a 17.5-kDa fusion protein with an N-terminal His-Tag in E. coli that was purified using immobilized-metal affinity chromatography (Figure 1 ). The recombinant ORF6 protein was used for the selection of its interacting cellular factors with phage-displayed human lung cDNA library. After the fifth round of biopanning, ORF6-specific binding phage clones eluted were selected from single phage plaques, amplified in E. coli for determining relative ORF6-binding affinities. Each phage clone was performed by direct binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inORF6coated wells (Figure 2 ). Phage clone numbers 16, 26, and 40 with higher binding affinity to ORF6 were quantitated using plaque assays (p < 0.01), and we subsequently measured the binding specificity ( Figure 3 ). Phage clones numbers. dose-dependent manner. Among the three phage clones, clone number 40 at a titer of 10 7 phages showed the highest affinity to ORF6 protein (p < 0.001). ORF6-interacting protein-encoding sequences fused in-frame with protein III gene of phage clone numbers 16, 26, and 40 were sequenced. A BLAST alignment search of the nucleotide sequences indicated that ORF6-interacting protein display phage clone numbers 16, 26, and 40 were identified as CCNL1 (cyclin L1), RBMXL2 (RNA binding motif protein, Xlinked-like 2), and NPIPB3 (nuclear pore complex interacting protein family, member B3), respectively. Because NPIPB3 displayed on phage clone 40 had the highest binding affinity to ORF6 protein (Figure 3 ), the interaction between ORF6 and NPIPB3 was further evaluated.\n\nTo test in vitro and in vivo interaction between ORF6 and NPIPB3, the C terminus (amino acid residues 936e1050) of NPIPB3 was cloned into bacterial expression vector pET32a for in vitro coimmunoprecipitation and mammalian expression vector pDsRed1-C for in vivo colocalization assay (Figures 4 and 5) . In the coimmunoprecipitation assay, the ORF6-His tag protein reacted with the Trx-NPIPB3-His tag fusion protein for 4 hours in a cool room, and then the protein complex were coimmunoprecipitated using anti-Trx antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads. The coimmunoprecipitates were analyzed using Western blotting with the anti-His tag antibodies (Figure 4) . The Western blotting analysis of immunoprecipitates revealed that the ORF protein bound to the Trx-NPIPB3-His tag fusion protein, but not to Trx protein (Figure 4 , lane 3 vs. lane 1). In the colocalization assay, single and both of DsRed-NPIPB3 and ORF6-His tag proteins were expressed in human promonocyte HL-CZ cells. After immunofluorescence staining with anti-His tag and FITC-conjugated antimouse IgG antibodies, confocal microscopy revealed a very close colocalization of DsRed-NPIPB3 and ORF6-His tag protein appearing as orange to yellow fluorescent light ( Figure 5P ), but no colocalization between DsRed and ORF6-His tag protein, or DsRed-NPIPB3 and His tag protein ( Figures 5D, 5H, and 5L ). The results demonstrated SARS-CoV ORF6 directly interacting with the C terminus of NPIPB3 in vitro and in vivo.\n\nTo determine the role of NPIPB3 in Type I IFN antagonism of SRAS-CoV ORF6, the IFN-b induced responses of transfected cells with single or both of pDsRed-NPIPB3 and pTriEx-ORF6 were explored using ISRE (IFN stimulated response element) luciferase reporter, STAT1 subcellular localization, and Western blotting assays (Figures 6e8) . Transient overexpression of NPIPB3 C terminus improved with 2.5-fold increase of the ISRE promoter activity in ORF6-expressing cells in response to IFN-b ( Figure 6 ; p < 0.001). To examine the subcellular location of STAT1, confocal imaging analysis indicated that the overexpression of NPIPB3 C terminus did not change the subcellular localization of STAT1 in vector control and ORF6-expressing cells [ Figure 7A \n\nThe study demonstrated Type I IFN antagonism of SARS-CoV ORF6 through the inhibition of IFN-b-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in human promonocytes (Figures 6e8), in agreement with a previous report in that ORF6 blocked STAT1 nuclear translocation in response to Type I IFNs via disrupting the import complex formation by binding with karyopherin alpha 2. 6 The Cterminal hydrophilic domain of ORF6 interacted with cellular karyopherins, but the N-terminal lipophilic part of ORF6 was also required for retaining cellular karyopherins at the ER/Golgi membrane, leading to impede nuclear import. 15 Besides STAT1, SARS-CoV ORF6 also affected the activity of karyopherin-dependent transcription factors, including VDR, CREB1, SMAD4, p53, EpasI, and Oct3/4. 16 Therefore, ORF6 plays the vital role in innate antiviral responses.\n\nBiopanning of phage-displayed human lung cDNA libraries identified the binding interaction of ORF6 with its interacting host factors, including CCNL1, RBMXL2, and NPIPB3 (Figures 2 and 3) . CCNL1 displayed on phage clone number 16, containing an arginine-and serine-rich domain and a cyclin domain was required for spliceosome assembly and regulated splicing. 17 ribonucleoproteins, suggested as a germ cell-specific splicing regulator. 19 ORF6-interacting phage clone number 40 displayed the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 (Figures 2  and 3 ). NPIPB3 had many alternative names such as nuclear pore complex-interacting protein-like 3, protein pps22-1, KIAA0220-like protein, nuclear pore complexinteracting protein B type, and PI-3-kinase-related kinase SMG-1 isoform 1 homolog. 20 NPIPB3 containing a transmembrane region at the N terminus was recognized as a membrane protein and served as an RNA splicing factor. NPIPB3 was upregulated in epithelial Caco-2 cells after exposure to probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92, linking with immune response, DNA binding, and protein synthesis. 21 NPIPB3 was also identified to bind IFN-a promoter. 22 In this study, overexpression of NPIPB3 C-terminal domain reduced the antagonistic activity of Type I IFN by SARS-CoV ORF6 protein (Figures 6e8) . The diacidic cluster motif (residues 53e56) was found in the ORF6 protein, as the critical determinant of subcellular localization to vesicular structures. 23 Interestingly, the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 had several four positively charged residue (KRRR) repeats. Therefore, ionic interactions could be linked with the binding interaction between SARS-CoV ORF6 and NPIPB3 C-terminal domain. In addition, the interaction between SARS-CoV ORF6 and NPIPB3 C-terminal domain might influence the binding interaction between ORF6 and karyopherin alpha 2; thus, the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 recovered the nuclear import carrier function of karyopherin alpha 2 in ORF6-expressing cells, correlating with STAT1 nuclear translocation after IFN-b treatment (Figure 7 ). In addition, overexpression of the NPIPB3 Cterminal domain reduced IFN-b-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 at Tyr701 (Figure 8, lane 2) . Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (Janus kinase 1) contained a putative phosphoinositide binding site; an interaction between JAK1 and PI-3kinase was reported in interleukin-2 signaling pathway. 24 Meanwhile, NPIPB3, also known as PI-3-kinase-related kinase SMG-1, showed functional and structural similarities to PI-3-kinase. 25 Therefore, NPIPB3 overexpression might increase the interaction with JAK1, which influenced IFN-binduced JAK/STAT signaling, resulting in the decrease of STAT1 phosphorylation at Tyr701.\n\nIn conclusion, SARS-CoV ORF6-interacting proteins including CCNL1, RBMXL2, NPIPB3, and karyopherin alpha 2 were involved in RNA splicing, nuclear pore complex formation, as well as nuclear export and import of some transcription and splicing factors. This study demonstrated SARS-CoV ORF6 inhibiting IFN-b-induced ISRE promoter, STAT1 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation. By contrast, the interaction of SARS-CoV ORF6 with the Cterminal domain of NPIPB3 in human promonocytes reduced the Type I IFN antagonism of ORF6.\n\nAll authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.
