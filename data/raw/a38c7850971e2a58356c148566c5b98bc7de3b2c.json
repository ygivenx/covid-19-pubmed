Brazil would start to face shortages of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators, with ICU beds 147 being the most immediate problem. The timing of shortages across the country depends on the 148 onset and the intensity of transmission. Also, the population that relies solely on SUS may bear 149 the largest burden, further exacerbating the existing inequalities, which calls for a reflection 150 around equity and ethics in service allocation. Avoiding this scenario is the paramount task of the 151\n\nIt is unreasonable to expect that all hospital resources could be entirely dedicated to Although elective procedures can be postponed, other health emergencies compete for resources. 154 author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the Second, there is a short window of opportunity to prepare. The response must be immediate, and 184 it will demand a concerted effort from society. Repurposing large spaces (e.g., arenas, 185 convention centers) to build makeshift hospitals for additional beds is critical. Calling on the 186 industry to produce the necessary equipment (e.g., ventilators, masks, gloves, protective gown, 187 etc) and to provide it to hospitals at minimum or no cost would also contribute to mitigating the 188 stress on the system, and to safeguarding the working conditions of health care professionals. 189\n\nMobilizing community leaders, artists, athletes, and local role models would help to convey a 190 unique message to the population, and to gather support from the wealthy that could provide 191 resources to expand the production of medical equipment. Brazil is, in theory, uniquely equipped to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic. It has a free and 202 universal health system, 7 it has one of largest community-based primary care delivery programs 203 that serves 74\u00b78% of the population, 28 it can learn from the mistakes and success that other 204 countries hit by COVID-19 have made, and it has a history of responding to health threats by 205 implementing governmental action and by generating high-quality scientific evidence, such as 206 was done when Zika virus hit the country. 29 Yet, the current moment is unique. It requires a 207 unified message from the country's leadership at various levels: federal, state, and municipal. It 208 requires the industry to work in solidarity to produce needed inputs without aiming profit but the 209 collective wellbeing. It requires the population to realize the importance and the urgency to 210 comply. We hope our results will help to move forward this agenda. 211 212 All rights reserved.
