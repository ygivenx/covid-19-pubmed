{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Effects of hand disinfection with alcohol hand rub, ozonized water or soap water - time for reconsideration?", "body": "Preventing the spread of virulent microorganisms is an essential part of infection control programmes [1] where hand disinfection plays a pivotal role. The microbiological flora on the hands can be classified into resident and transient groups. Organisms in the former normal flora group are stable and reproduce locally, are generally non-virulent, and the concentrations can only be reduced with disinfection. In contrast, transient microbes do not reproduce while on the hands, and are normally only viable for a short time. However, they can be pathogenic, easily transmitted or colonize skin wounds or dermatitis [1, 2] .\n\nConsidering the necessity for frequent hand sanitization in hospitals, healthcare workers (HCW) show a high prevalence of skin irritation [3] . Studies have found a high prevalence of bacteria on the hands of healthcare personnel, and the Center for Disease Control have reported that frequent hand washing amongst HCW ranges from 5% to 81%, with an average of 40% [4] .\n\nThe maintenance of healthy skin is crucial for HCW. In particular, the preservation of lipids, fatty acids and resident microbial flora is important [5] . Hand disinfection with alcohol has become a standard procedure, and wall-mounted dispensers can be easily found in healthcare institutions.\n\nSoap and water hand wash is recommended more for hand cleaning, rather than disinfection.\n\nHowever, WHO guidelines state that disinfection with alcohol is more effective for eradicating transient bacteria [1, 5] .\n\nOzone has been reported to have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial effects. It was first used for disinfection of water, and is now being used in food hygiene, fish farming, air purification, hot tubs and in dentistry [6] . Appelgrein et al. reported that ozonized water was inferior to propanol based hand rubs [7] , while Nakamura et al. observed a 3 log 10 reduction in CFU after hand washing with ozonized water, or antimicrobial soap and water [8] . A concern is that ozone gas is toxic to humans at high concentrations and can substantially damage the lungs. However, the gas can be dissolved in tap water for hand washing, and most of the gas then passes in the water through the outlet of the sink. The Norwegian Labor Inspection Authority accepts an 8-h average exposure (TWA) of 0.1 ppm in the working atmosphere [9] . Usually humans can also notice the characteristic smell of ozone gas at very low concentration.\n\nPreviously, we compared alcohol hand disinfection with ozonized water for eradicating or removing transient Escherichia coli from contaminated hands [10] . The results showed that alcohol hand disinfection, even under optimal conditions, failed in removing all transient E. coli from hands of participants and results showed higher CFU/ml values than for the ozone-water hand wash. Besides, several participants reported adverse skin irritation from frequent use of alcohol disinfection.\n\nAgainst this background, we wanted to conduct a follow up study, this time including also a group using soap and water hand wash. We merged the results from both crossover studies, comparing standard alcohol disinfection, ozonized-water wash and soap and water wash.\n\nA modified procedure from the standard EN 1500:2013 was used as described earlier (10) . Briefly, a non-pathogenic E. coli strain (ATCC 25922) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassan, Virginia, USA) was used to contaminate hands followed by three hand disinfectant procedures under the supervision of a hygiene nurse. The disinfectant alcohol was Antibac with 85 % ethanol and <5%\n\npropan-2-ol and glycerine (KiiltoClean AS, Asker, Norway). Non-alcoholic Antibac hand soap (3 mL liquid soap) (KiiltoClean AS) was used in a regular soap and water washing procedure, and 0.8 ppm ozone-water was produced (Ozonator CYS300C, Cleanzone, Bergen, Norway) directly in tap water for a hand wash procedure.\n\nThe participants were checked for any visible signs of dermatitis before included in the tests. Twelve (22%) of 55 volunteers were men and 43 (78%) were women. Ages ranged from 20 to 66 years. Out of 40 participants, half were merged with 15 students from the earlier study [10] . Altogether this represented 35 participants. The other half washed their hands with ozone-water or regular soap and water wash. The temperature of tap water was approximately 20\u00b0C and the water flow was approximately 8 L/min. The alcohol and ozone groups were included in a crossover design. This was not possible for the soap and water wash group due to the limited number of participants and laboratory facilities.\n\nBesides descriptive statistics, differences in outcomes were investigated using a paired -test with 1000 bootstrap samples, Wilcoxon's test or Mann Whitney U test. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v24, and figures were prepared using GraphPad Prism v8.\n\nVolunteers were informed in a separate lesson about the study, provided written information and invited to participate. All participants provided written consent. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics and Norwegian Data Inspectorate (reference no.:\n\nThe pre-test CFU/mL values exceeded the cut-off value of \u226530 000 in 52 of 55 participants, and for the samples from the remaining three participants, the CFU/mL values were 10 500, 10 600 and 2 900 respectively. The post-test CFU/mL values are presented in Table I p=0.359). Figure 1 illustrates the difference in outliers with a rather high dose of E. coli left after disinfection for some of the alcohol group.\n\nFor the alcohol hand rub group there was also a difference between the left and right hand (mean CFU/ml of 1356 vs. 974), while the ozone and soap group showed less left or right hand side differences.\n\nThe measured ozone concentration in the surrounding air was 0.01 ppm or lower, but still most of the participants had noticed a mild smell of ozone gas.\n\nBased on self-reporting, one third of participants reported adverse skin effects (burning/dryness) from regular alcohol disinfection, even if none had active dermatitis. None of the participants reported unpleasant skin symptoms with the ozone-water or regular soap and water. The majority (66%) also stated that they would prefer using ozonized tap water if the disinfection effect was similar as of other agents.\n\nBased on the results, the best methods seem to be hand washing with soap and water, and alternatively ozonized water. However, the use of standard alcohol disinfection is more flexible for hand sanitization when no water supply or sinks are required, and dispensers can be easily installed in healthcare institutions or public places. This method will therefore continue to play a vital role in hand disinfection.\n\nWe think that some of the transient bacteria on hands may be removed by the running water alone, and this should be examined further. We also suspect that the disinfection procedure with 3 mL alcohol is more complicated to perform correctly, as it fails to disinfect the hands in a substantial number of participants. Also, a difference in bacterial counts for the left and right hand were observed for the alcohol disinfection group. In regular public use, the disinfection failure rate may be expected to be even higher, and this should be further scrutinized.\n\nThe WHO guidelines for hand hygiene in health care do not take in to account ozonized water as an alternative method [1] . However, we found that it is a simple and skin friendly method that leaves no residual chemicals to the environment. An environmental and economic incentive to use ozone in water could be that this device once installed, require no need for transportation or stocking of refill.\n\nEthanol and soap distribution and packaging waste is huge, compared to none with ozone gas.\n\nWe observed that washing with a mild disinfectant such as ozonized water, besides a regular soap and water hand wash, may be more effective than only alcohol for the removal of transient E. coli from artificially contaminated hands. Based on this work, ozonized water might be an alternative to traditional hand disinfectants. However, larger studies in clinical settings would be required to validate its efficacy. The potential use of ozonized water against viruses should also be further examined, including a possible effect on the new COVID-19."}
