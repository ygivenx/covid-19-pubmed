{"title": "Detection of alpha and betacoronaviruses in multiple Iberian bat species", "body": "The emergence of infectious diseases is a major threat to global public health in this century (WHO, World Health Report http://www.who.int/whr/previous/en/index.html) and many of these new infectious human diseases are caused by viruses emerging from wildlife. In the last 50 years, more than 30 new infectious human diseases have been identified (WHO, World Health Report http://www.who.int/whr/previous/en/index.html) including the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The aetiological agent of this disease was identified as a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1] and BatCoV are putative precursors of SARS-CoV [2]. The outbreak of SARS-CoV and subsequent identification of two additional human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63[3] and HCoV-HKU1 [4]) has drawn human and animal health attention to Coronavirinae subfamily, that includes three genera, Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1 CoV), Betacoronavirus (\u03b2 CoV) and Gammacoronavirus (\u03b3 CoV), replacing the classical groups 1, 2 and 3 [5] (http://talk.ictvonline.org/media/g/vertebrate-2008/default.aspx).\n\nThe relevance and possible re-emergence of the pandemic SARS-CoV and other emerging viruses of zoonotic origin have activated surveillance systems of hazard agents in wild animals, including bats. As a result of these studies, bats have been described as putative reservoirs for some emerging viruses affecting humans [6]. BatCoV are putative precursors of CoV affecting humans and mammals [7, 8], including SARS-CoV [2] and other CoV that crossed the species barrier from zoonotic reservoirs into the human population [9]. In fact, association of some of these CoV to certain bat species has been suggested [10, 11], reinforcing the notion that there may be a relationship between some BatCoV and their hosts. Nowadays the presence of CoV has been shown in bats in China [12, 13], North and South America [14\u201317], Africa [18] and a number of regions in Europe [11, 19\u201321] but not the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal), which is a bridge for European and African bat populations [22]. Thus, surveillance of wildlife reservoirs of putative zoonotic CoV is necessary, not only to unveil the ecology of these viruses, but also to permit early detection of viruses that might pose a threat to human health.\n\nTo determine the presence and distribution of putative zoonotic CoV in Iberian bats, 576 individuals from 26 bat species were captured and sampled in 13 different locations throughout Spain during 2004-2007 (Fig. 1). These samples were collected in the context of bat rhabdoviruses and lyssaviruses Surveillance Program in Spain. Most of the sampled bat species are also distributed across Europe, but Eptesicus isabellinus is a meridional serotine bat restricted to North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula [23], and Myotis escalerai is endemic in the Iberian Peninsula. Bats were caught with mist nets mainly as they left diurnal roost and by hand with polyethylene butterfly nets within roosts. Oro-pharyngeal swabs (n=390) between 2004 and 2007 as well as faecal samples from individual bats (n=216) in 2007 were taken before bats were released (Table 1).\n\nOro-pharyngeal swabs collected between 2004 and 2006 were preserved in 1 ml of lysis buffer (4 M GuSCN (Sigma), OS% N-lauroyl Sarcosine (Sigma), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma), 25 mM Sodium Citrate and 20 pg/tube Glycogen (Boehringer Mannheim). Oro-pharyngeal swabs and faeces collected in 2007 were preserved in both 1 ml of lysis buffer and 1 ml of viral transport medium (VTM) (Eagle\u2019s minimal essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10 UI/ml of penicillin, 10 \u03bcg/ml of streptomycin, 160 \u03bcg/ml of gentamicin, 50 UI/ml of mycostatin and 1% of bovine serum albumin). All samples were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C before sending them to the Rabies Reference Laboratory at the Centro Nacional de Microbiolog\u00eda, ISCIII in Madrid. Faecal samples were clarified by centrifugation. Total nucleic acid was extracted from a 200 \u03bcl aliquot of each specimen for PCR assays and the rest were stored to \u221280\u00b0C in two different aliquots. Final pellets were always resuspended to 55 \u03bcl of water.\n\nA pan-coronavirus nested PCR was designed in the RdRp gene. A total of 5 \u03bcl of extracted RNA was added to 45 \u03bcl of reaction mixture of OneStep RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) containing 200 \u03bcM dNTPs and 60 pmol of generic CoV-specific degenerated primers (forward 5\u2032-CARATGAATYTIAARTAYGC-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-TGYTGWGARCAAAAYTCRTG-3\u2032) and following manufacturer indications. Amplifications were carried out into thin-walled reaction tubes (Sorenson, BioScience, UT) in a PTC-200 (Peltier Thermal Cycler, MJ Research, Watertown, MA). Nested PCR amplifications were performed using 2 \u03bcl of first amplification product and 48 \u03bcl of reaction mixture containing 60 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 15 mM (NH4)2SO4, 200 \u03bcM dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ), 3 mM MgCl2, 35 pmol of generic CoV-specific degenerated primers (forward 5\u2032-ATGGGWTGGGAYTAYCCIAARTG-3\u2032and reverse 5\u2032-ACRTTRTTYTGRWARTA-3\u2032) and 1.25 U AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk). Amplification product size of 512 nt was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced directly in both directions using an automated ABI PRISM 377 model sequencer. For phylogeny reconstruction, consensus sequences were aligned together with others obtained from public genomic databases using the program CLUSTAL X (version 1.83) (Table 2). A Bayesian phylogenetic inference was obtained using Mr Bayes version 3.1 [24] with random starting trees without constraints. For the analyses GTR substitution model, gamma estimation and two simultaneous runs of 107 generations were done, each with four Markov chains, and the trees were sampled every 100 generations. Amino acid identity was calculated with MEGA 4 using the pairwise deletion option. The alignment comprised the same 396 bp of the RdRp gene used for the phylogenetic reconstruction.\n\nA total of 26 out of the 30 known bat species known for Iberian Peninsula were screened for CoV and 14 samples taken from 9 bat species, all included in the family Vespertilionidae, were positive for CoV RNA (Tables 1 and 2). Twelve of them were found within faecal samples (5.5%) of 7 different bat species in 6 locations and two were obtained in oral samples (0.5%) of 2 other different species in the same location (Table 1). In view of these results, it is not surprising that the presence of CoV RNA is significantly more frequent in faeces than in oral cavity (p<0.0001, FISHER EXACT TEST). It is of interest that none of the viruses has been found in oropharingeal and faecal samples of the same individual, when both samples were available. This fact may indicate either that the infection was at different stage in the different individuals at the time of sampling or that replication of virus may take place independently in the intestinal and respiratory tracts [25]. Most of the CoV RNA sequences found in faecal samples (83%) correspond to \u03b1 CoV, the remaining two belonging to \u03b2 CoV. All CoV RNAs from oral samples (100%) were found to contain viral RNA sequences corresponding to \u03b1 CoV. In agreement with all previous studies [7], none of the coronavirus detected in Spanish bats belong to group \u03b3.\n\nThe phylogenetic analysis of Spanish BatCoV was performed using 396nt out of the 512 nt RT-PCR amplified fragments. 116nt fragment information was lost to allowed us include more sequences from other European countries and other continents deposited in GenBanK to perform a meaningful analysis. This small part of the RdRp gene has been previously used, and sufficiently represents the full gene information, for phylogenetic analysis of BatCoV [11, 14, 20]\n\nThe phylogenetic reconstruction showed 6 different lineages of Spanish BatCoV (Fig. 2). BatCoV A and B were closely related to other \u03b1 BatCoV found in China [12], although they appeared to display certain genetic differentiation (Fig. 2). Myotis daubentonii-associated CoV H, and Pipistrellus-associated CoV K, clustered respectively with lineages 4 and 3 of \u03b1 CoV previously described in Germany and are hosted by the same bat species or genera [11] (Fig. 2). BatCoV L was closely related to cluster HKU7 described in China [10]. BatCoV C, D, E, F, G and I belonged to the same lineage and showed an intriguing new independent cluster (significant posterior probability = 0.95) including BatCoV I\u2032 (Fig. 2). In addition, BatCoV J and M were genetically related to \u03b2 CoV, although they did not really associate with any of their previously described linages. Sequences corresponding to two different groups of CoV were found in the same bat species (Hypsugo savii) as it was also found for other bat species elsewhere [12]. Spanish BatCoV described here were also classified calculating amino acid distances of these viruses from phylogenetic neighbours and related reference species [21]. Amino acid distance criteria recently described for separating RdRp grouping units (RGU) were adopted [21]. Interestingly, the amino acid distance criteria (>4.8% for alphacoronavirus and >6.3% for betacoronavirus) reinforced the presence of the new group of alphacoronaviruses mentioned above including Spanish BatCoV C, D, E, F, G and I; and additionally showed four new tentative groups (Fig. 2). BatCoV A and B were included in a new alphacoronavirus group and BatCoV I\u2032 constituted another independent alphacoronavirus group. BatCoV J, and M represented two new betacoronavirus groups and BatCoV H, K and L remained as part of several established species (Fig. 2).\n\nIt has been previously suggested that some CoV associate to certain bat species [10, 11]. However, we found that different bat species from the same colony or location harbour CoV of the same genetic lineage (BatCoV A and B; G and I), indicating a greater diversity and higher complexity than previously described for the ecology of BatCoV. Similar exceptions were found in China and South America [12, 16, 26] and could also be observed with Australian BatCoV (Fig. 2 and Table 2).\n\nIn conclusion, previous studies showed the presence of BatCoV in Europe. However, to our knowledge, this is the first report describing the presence of CoV RNA in Iberian bat species. Phylogenetic data indicate high diversity, wide distribution and complex ecology of CoV in bats captured in diverse Spanish locations. The sequences reported herein provide new insights into the diversity of coronaviruses and describe new phylogenetic linages that appear to diverge from all genotypes previously detected in other European locations. Future studies should clarify whether such apparently high diversity reflects the bio-geographical peculiarities of the Iberian Peninsula or not. This study contributes with a new dataset to the global surveillance of emerging BatCoV with pathogenic potential in humans. Our data reinforce the notion that the ecology and transmission of CoV in bat reservoirs is far from being completely understood and that more studies will be necessary to evaluate the magnitude of the potential threat that these viruses pose to human health."}
