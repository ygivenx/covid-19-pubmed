{"title": "The Microbiome in Cystic Fibrosis", "body": "Recent elucidation of the richness and complexity of the microbiome in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has invigorated new discussions of the role of microbial infection in CF beyond pathogens classically linked to CF like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An increasing number of studies have characterized the composition of airway microbiota in patients from different CF cohorts (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) , and common threads have emerged across studies in the relationships observed between features of the respiratory microbiome and clinical outcomes. Extending these observations, however, to the clinical realm in a predictive manner remains a challenge for several reasons, including the inter-patient heterogeneity in airway microbiota composition that has come to be appreciated from these studies.\n\nMost studies, to date, have focused on bacterial members of the respiratory microbiome, but some recent investigations have also begun to characterize fungal and viral communities in CF (13) (14) (15) (16) . Such efforts are important for these other microbial kingdoms have largely been ignored in the schema of lung microbiome investigation. Additionally, recent studies have begun to explore the microbiome in other organs affected by CF, such as the gastrointestinal tract (17) (18) (19) (20) . Since gut dysfunction is another prominent feature of CF, findings from these studies may have potentially important clinical implications (21) .\n\nThe intent of this review is to highlight recent insights in the rapidly evolving area of CF microbiome investigation. Advances in knowledge about the nature of microbial dysbiosis (i.e. altered microbial balance) in CF are re-shaping the conceptual framework within which the role of infection in CF has long been considered. Select studies are discussed that have contributed to the current understanding of the structure, composition, and collective functions of CF microbiota, and their relationship to disease benchmarks. Lastly, we discuss both the challenges and opportunities presented from these recent insights with an eye towards how such knowledge may be leveraged to inform CF patient care.\n\nAdvances in sequence-based analysis of microbial genomes have laid the foundation for techniques to characterize the types of microbial species present in a sample. For bacteria, the most widely used approaches are based on analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, whose conservation across species along with polymorphisms in hypervariable regions of the gene, enable both the broad detection of bacteria present in a sample and their phylogenetic identities. For more comprehensive discussions regarding methods and tools to study the microbiome, including in the context of lung disease, readers are referred to recent papers in this area (22) (23) (24) .\n\nThe unique anatomy of the lung presents challenges to studying its microbiome. Collecting lower airway samples requires passage through the upper respiratory tract or oropharynx, which has previously raised questions about the extent of oral contamination in such samples. However, several studies now have established that microbiota identified from lower respiratory specimens are distinguishable from upper airway microbiota (especially nasopharyngeal) in measures of diversity and also in the types and relative abundance of specific bacterial groups (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) . Moreover, it is worthy to keep in mind that the architecture of the bronchial airways leads to regional differences in lung biology and the airway microenvironment, even in the healthy state (30) . In CF, it is likely that patterns of dysbiosis are greatly influenced by the altered airway milieu related to CFTR dysfunction and subsequent changes to mucus clearance (31) .\n\nBronchiectasis and chronic infection are well-recognized clinical features of CF that contribute the most to disease morbidity and mortality. Though it is well established that P. aeruginosa is an important pathogen in CF lung disease, other bacteria that also contribute to pulmonary morbidity in CF include Burkholderia cepacia complex (32), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (33) , and certain non-tuberculous mycobacteria such as M. abscessus complex or M. avium complex (34) . Microbiological features of these organisms, including factors responsible for virulence and resistance to antimicrobial therapies, have been extensively studied (35, 36) . Additional potential pathogens associated with CF include Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Achromobacter spp, including Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Achromobacter ruhlandii, which can be difficult to treat (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) .\n\nThe role of anaerobic bacteria in CF lung disease remains uncertain, but they are frequently identifiable and prevalent by both culture-targeted and culture-independent methods (2, (42) (43) (44) (45) . Current data supports an argument for anaerobes playing an important role in the CF airway microenvironment, especially given the steep oxygen gradients present (45) . In addition to contributing to the CF antibiotic resistome (i.e. the collection of all antibiotic resistance genes in microorganisms), certain prevalent anaerobic species produce quorumsensing molecules that mediate interspecies signaling pathways (46) and potentially influence virulence characteristics of pathogens like P. aeruginosa (47) . More recent evidence also suggests that metabolic products associated with anaerobes (43, 48) , including short-chain fatty acids detected in airway specimens, may increase the release of IL-8, GM-CSF, and IL-6 and reduce inducible NOS gene expression. Thus conceivably, anaerobic bacteria may be a group of 'keystone' organisms that collectively have a large influence on the CF pulmonary ecosystem.\n\nCulture-independent investigations within the past 10-15 years have expanded and are reshaping traditional views of CF airway microbiology. Across both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of CF respiratory samples, several similar observations have been made.\n\nFirst, studies of respiratory samples from young children with CF have noted that a number of distinct bacterial groups are present in both directly sampled, CF-affected lung tissue (26) , and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (1, 11) . Coupled with the knowledge that structural and physiologic function of the lung is compromised in early life of CF-affected children (49, 50) , this suggests a direct relationship between the early development of microbial dysbiosis in the lungs and these clinical outcomes.\n\nSecondly, airway bacterial diversity in CF patients is greatest in early life up to adolescence, declining thereafter into adulthood. These observations have been made from both crosssectional and longitudinal analyses, including one birth cohort study that found bacterial diversity in the first two years of life was influenced by feeding habit and that a decline in specific species, such as Haemophilus, preceded colonization of P. aeruginosa (12) . Similar trends have been observed from cross-sectional analyses across different age groups (3, 4) . Huang Selective pressure from cumulative courses of antibiotics is the predominant factor shaping this change in bacterial community structure (7).\n\nThirdly, studies in adults with CF have observed great heterogeneity among patients in the composition of bacterial communities identified from airway samples, mostly sputum (2, 6, 8) . That is, the types and relative abundance of different bacterial groups detected vary considerably between patients, as shown by a representative example from one study ( Figure  1 ). Another consistent finding is that bacterial groups that are most prevalent within a subject also do not tend to vary substantially in relative abundance over time. The most prevalent communities identified by culture-independent investigations mirror, not surprisingly, those species or genera detected in clinical cultures, such as P. aeruginosa, Burkholderia, and Staphylococcus. When prevalent these bacterial groups in essence represent 'core' members of the CF respiratory microbiome, but results of cultureindependent analyses suggest additional bacterial groups, not usually detected by typical CF clinical culture methods, comprise this core. For example, using approaches that partition the distribution of species based on statistical variance-to-abundance ratios, investigators in one study reported that in addition to Pseudomonas, anaerobic species, such as members of the Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Veillonella genera, also contribute to their study cohort's core group of microbiota (a total of 15 taxa from 7 genera) (5) . This contrasted with the greater range of bacterial groups (67 taxa from 33 genera) comprising a 'satellite' group of microbiota, which they did not find to correlate with any clinical factors. However, whether satellite species nonetheless contribute ecological interactions of importance within the CF microbiome remains an outstanding question.\n\nAn implication of these findings is that a molecular-based bacterial community signature that distinguishes patients clinically has been difficult to ascertain. For example, in CF pulmonary exacerbations, no consistent changes in airway bacterial burden or community composition have been observed among patients within a given study or when compared across studies (6, 7, 51) . Some patients show marked shifts in their respiratory bacterial community structure at a given exacerbation, while others demonstrate very little change despite clinical symptoms suggestive of such events. Moreover, patients across different studies have demonstrated exacerbation-related reductions in the abundance of baseline predominant species, suggesting that increased abundance of less prevalent microbiota members may play a greater role in certain exacerbations. Finally, antibiotic treatments for exacerbations do not cause a sustained shift in bacterial community structure following exacerbation (6, 7) . Indeed the CF airway microbiome is generally resilient to these perturbations with community re-assembly after recovery resembling a patient's baseline community structure (7).\n\nCharacterization of fungal microbial communities (\"mycobiome\") has in general lagged behind studies of bacteria, and only recently have some advances been made in respiratory studies (52, 54, 55) . A number of factors make identifying fungi, and analysis of the mycobiome challenging (52) . Similar to bacteria, the vast majority of fungal species are difficult, if at all possible, to culture (53) . As such, the application of high-throughput Huang sequencing approaches has better delineated the diversity of fungal species harbored in the lungs, and in the context of respiratory disease (54, 55) . However, approaches for sample preparation, from extraction of fungal DNA and choice of primers to amplify fungal sequences, are non-uniform across studies and that can influence read-outs of fungal composition (52) . Moreover, existing reference databases for comparing fungal sequences are far less rich or robust than those for bacteria (e.g., 16S rRNA databases), further limiting analytic efforts. Investigators considering such studies should therefore be cognizant of factors that could bias or limit fungal community characterization.\n\nNotwithstanding these challenges, several studies have explored the respiratory mycobiome in CF. In a study of sputum samples from four CF patients, 60% of the identified fungal taxa were not detected by mycological cultures (13) . In addition to Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, 30 fungal species or genera identified included other species of Candida and Aspergillus, Penicillium, Malassezia and Kluyveromyces. Another study of six CF subjects found that a mixture of Candida and Malassezia species dominated 74-99% of fungal sequence reads from sputum, although the samples were collected at the time of admission, and after completion of antibacterial therapy, which could influence these findings (14) . One of the largest studies to date involving 56 patients (55) found that the number of fungal species detected in CF sputum was higher than that for bacteria, but also fluctuated much more over time. The investigators concluded that this suggests that inhalational exposure is a greater driving factor in the detection of fungi rather than established fungal colonization in CF airways. Other culture-independent, non-sequencing approaches to identify fungal species, such as denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (15) , have also been explored using CF sputa. However, the utility of this approach compared to others remains uncertain.\n\nInfections by RNA viruses (e.g., rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenzae, etc.) are important triggers of CF pulmonary exacerbations (56) (57) (58) (59) . However, few studies have examined the respiratory \"virome\" in CF, in part due to the challenges of conducting comprehensive viral sequencing studies (60) . A number of studies have focused on bacteriophage populations in the airways (16, (61) (62) (63) . As these DNA viruses infect specific bacteria, specific phages have been studied as alternative therapeutic approaches to potentially target particular bacterial pathogens like P. aeruginosa (62, 63) .\n\nMetagenomic studies that provide a more comprehensive picture of DNA viruses in the respiratory tract of CF patients have noted CF-associated phage communities to be highly similar to each other, in contrast to those found in non-CF patients (16) . This likely reflects the range of bacterial species selected for in the CF lung. Intriguingly, high phage-tobacteria ratios have been described in a variety of mucosal environments, including human gingival samples, and in vitro studies have shown phage adherence to mucus to be mediated by binding interactions between Ig-like domains on phage capsids and glycan residues on mucin glycoproteins (64) . Further, pre-treatment of mucus-producing cell lines with T4 phages led to subsequent decreased bacterial attachment (Eschericheria coli) to the cells.\n\nThese findings have led investigators to propose that bacteriophage adherence to mucus may Huang serve as a form of antibacterial immunity along mucosal surfaces. However, the potential significance of this system extrapolated to the CF lung remains unclear. Other data also suggest phages may be functionally synergistic with antibiotics, wherein antibiotics stimulate phage production and/or activity to aid bacterial killing (65) . Lytic activity of temperate phages may also be preserved long-term in chronic P. aeruginosa infection and potentially contribute to controlling P. aeruginosa density (62) .\n\nCompositional studies of the microbiota harbored within CF patients has broadened our knowledge of microbial diversity associated with this disease. However, it is likely that the functions and metabolic features encoded for, and expressed by, a collective microbial community span species-level differences in taxonomic composition, which in itself is nonuniform across patients. Evidence for this cross-phylogeny sharing of gene functions has been demonstrated in the gut microbiome, via known mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer between bacteria (66), and has served as a premise for the development of in silico approaches to determine functional capacities of bacterial microbiota based on metagenome predictions (67).\n\nUsing a combined metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach wherein sequencing of both DNA and RNA were carried out, Quinn et al., examined the functional capacities of microbiota detected from CF patient sputa (68) . They noted that enriched functions expressed by CF-associated organisms included amino acid catabolism, folate biosynthesis, and nitrate reduction pathways, the latter largely encoded by Pseudomonas and Rothia. Their data also suggested that ammonia may accumulate in the airway environment, as oxidative pathways involved in the nitrogen cycle were incomplete.\n\nArtificial culture systems have also been applied in attempts to simulate and study CF microbial-related physiology in the airways (69) . One approach utilized glass capillary tubes instilled with artificial sputum medium intended to mimic CF physiologic conditions, which were then inoculated with bacterial strains derived from CF patients collected serially during periods of clinical stability and exacerbation. Using a combination of techniques to evaluate physiology of the system, the investigators observed increased gas production and a two-unit drop in pH prior to the onset of exacerbation. Parallel analysis of the microbial community noted an increase in the abundance of fermentative anaerobes, suggesting that metabolic activities of these organisms may contribute to the development of exacerbations.\n\nWhile studies of respiratory microbiota have dominated CF microbiome studies, recently investigations have also begun to characterize and analyze relationships between gastrointestinal bacterial microbiota, clinical disease markers, and profiles of airway bacterial community composition. Gastrointestinal complications of CF are a significant cause of disease morbidity, and problems beyond pancreatic insufficiency are often difficult to manage (21) . Two studies (17, 18) involving a cohort of CF patients found Enterobacteriaceae were marginally higher in CF fecal samples, whereas there was significant underrepresentation of Bifidobacterium and members of Clostridium cluster XIVa. Two-year longitudinal analysis of two CF patients and their healthy siblings observed a trend towards lower species richness and temporal stability of CF fecal microbiota (17) .\n\nPatterns of gut and respiratory microbiome development in early life of children with CF have been reported in two studies from a single birth cohort (19, 20) . Though the number of subjects was small, the investigators observed initial diversification in gut and respiratory microbiota composition, followed by subsequent shifts in community composition related to changes in diet, namely cessation of breast-feeding and introduction of solid foods. Although non-CF children were not included as a control group for comparison in these studies, this observation is consistent with normal patterns of gut microbiome maturation in early life in healthy infants (70, 71) . Changes in diet also influenced respiratory microbiota composition indicating links to nutritional intake (19) . Decreases in specific bacterial genera, both in the gut (Parabacteroides) as well as respiratory tract (Haemophilus), preceded airway colonization with P. aeruginosa (20) . Another interesting observation was that intestinal, but not respiratory, bacterial community structure in the first six months of life was associated with the occurrence of CF exacerbations during that timeframe. Findings from these types of studies, as well as those from interventional trials using probiotic species (72, 73) , suggest that manipulations of the gut microbiome to foster a less pro-inflammatory environment could be an avenue to mitigate pulmonary morbidity in CF.\n\nThe new insights afforded by the studies described above provide a foundation for addressing several important questions pertaining to the microbiology of CF. As we continue to explore the long-term dynamics of airway bacterial community structure, a focus will be on better elucidating the relationship between decreasing community diversity and advancing patient age and lung disease. An intriguing question is whether maintaining more diverse communities might have a positive impact on lung health -and if so, whether novel treatment strategies (e.g., targeted 'species-specific' antimicrobial therapy) may enable maintenance of 'healthier' airway communities. A more complete understanding of shortterm community dynamics may identify reproducible changes in community structure and/or activity that are associated with changes in patient clinical condition. If multi-omic analyses identify, for example, biomarkers of impending exacerbation, it will of great interest to determine if these can be monitored in real time and exploited to prevent or better manage these events. Similarly, it is conceivable that specific patterns of community change may be identified that predict exacerbation severity and/or recovery.\n\nMoving forward, it will be important to complement our growing understanding of bacterial ecology in CF airways with attention to the broader microbial community, including viral and fungal species. Advances in our appreciation of how microbial interactions drive the activity of polymicrobial communities would be expected to provide opportunities for novel therapies. Finally, continued investigation of the relationship between disordered gut microbiota and lung pathology in CF has potential to translate to creative management strategies and to generate mechanistic hypotheses addressing CF pathobiology.
