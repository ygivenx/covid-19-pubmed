{"title": "Aerosol and surface stability of HCoV-19 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to SARS-CoV-1 4 5 6 Full author list: Neeltje van Doremalen", "body": "To the Editor, 21 A novel human coronavirus, now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 22 (SARS-CoV-2, referred to as HCoV-19 here) that emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 is now causing a 23 pandemic 1 . Here, we analyze the aerosol and surface stability of HCoV-19 and compare it with SARS-24 CoV-1, the most closely related human coronavirus. 2 We evaluated the stability of HCoV-19 and SARS- HCoV-19 remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of our experiment (3 hours) with a 30 reduction in infectious titer from 10 3.5 to 10 2.7 TCID 50 /L, similar to the reduction observed for SARS-CoV-31 1, from 10 4.3 to 10 3.5 TCID 50 /mL ( Figure 1A ).\n\nHCoV-19 was most stable on plastic and stainless steel and viable virus could be detected up to 33 72 hours post application ( Figure 1A ), though the virus titer was greatly reduced (plastic from 10 3.7 to 34 10 0.6 TCID 50 /mL after 72 hours, stainless steel from 10 3.7 to 10 0.6 TCID 50 /mL after 48 hours). SARS-CoV-35 1 had similar stability kinetics (polypropylene from 10 3.4 to 10 0.7 TCID 50 /mL after 72 hours, stainless steel 36 from 10 3.6 to 10 0.6 TCID 50 /mL after 48 hours). No viable virus could be measured after 4 hours on copper 37 for HCoV-19 and 8 hours for SARS-CoV-1, or after 24 hours on cardboard for HCoV-19 and 8 hours for 38 SARS-CoV-1 ( Figure 1A ).

Estimated differences in half-life between the two viruses were small 47 except for on cardboard ( Figure 1C , Table S1 ). Individual replicate data were noticeably noisier for 48 cardboard than other surfaces (Figures S1-S5), so we advise caution in interpreting this result. This article is a US Government work.
