{"title": "Supplementary Information for mTOR inhibitors lower an intrinsic barrier to virus infection mediated by IFITM3", "body": "wash buffer (PBS + 0.1% saponin + 1% BSA). Cells were stained with anti-IFITM2/3 (Proteintech, 66081-1-Ig), and anti-LAMP1 Antibody (Thermo Fisher, PA1-654A) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Slides were washed three times and incubated for one hour with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies for one hour at room temperature. Slides were mounted for three days with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Thermo Fisher, P36930). Confocal microscopy analysis of endosomal markers was performed using a Zeiss 710 laser scanning confocal microscope at 64X oil-immersion magnification at a 2-fold digital zoom with a 1024 x 1024 field size. For establishing voltage and aperture parameters, snap images were captured for each channel using control slides stained only with secondary antibody. Images were collected in 16-slice intervals and 0.2 \u00b5m apart. At least 50 cells were imaged for each condition. Z-stacks were analyzed with Imaris (Bitplane) using the ImarisCell analysis module to quantify number and intensity of IFITM2/3 and LAMP-1+ vesicles. Statistical analysis of vesicle quantity and staining intensity was conducted using Prism 7 (GraphPad) and evaluated with the Kruskal-Wallis test using Dunn's multiple comparison correction.\n\nHeLa cells were treated with DMSO or rapamycin (20 uM) for four hours and total RNA was extracted with Tri-Reagent (Sigma). RNA was incubated with Turbo DNAse I (Ambio) for one hour at 37\u00b0C followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR of cDNA templates was run on a DNA Engine Opticon 2 detection system using Power SyberGreen PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosciences) paired with the following primer sets: 5'-GAATCACACTGTCCAAACCTTC-3' and 5'-CATAGGCCTGGAAGATCAGC-3' (IFITM3); 5'-GAAATCCCATCACCATCTTCCAGG-3' and 5'-GAGCCCCAGCCTTCTCCATG-3' (GAPDH). HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates (50,000/well) overnight and treated with DMSO or the indicated concentration of Torin 1 for four hours. Cells were fixed/permeabilized, stained with anti-IFITM3, and analyzed by flow cytometry. (C) HEK293T cell lines stably expressing FLAGtagged IFITM3, IFITM3 mutants, IFITM2, or IFITM1 were seeded in 24-well plates (50,000/well) overnight and treated with DMSO or rapamycin (30 uM) for four hours. Cells were fixed/permeabilized, stained with anti-IFITM3, and analyzed by flow cytometry. MFI from univariate histograms of IFITM3 or FLAG expression were normalized and averaged, with expression in the DMSO condition of each cell line set to 100. Error bars indicate standard error from three to five experiments. \n\nRel. IFITM3 protein"}
