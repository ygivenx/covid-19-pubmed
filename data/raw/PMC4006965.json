{"title": "Respiratory viral pathogens among Singapore military servicemen 2009 \u2013 2012: epidemiology and clinical characteristics", "body": "Influenza-like illness (ILI) is often used for influenza surveillance [1], as influenza is a disease of global interest with 5% of adults developing symptomatic disease annually and with case fatalities of 3.5% in susceptible populations [2]. While influenza surveillance remains a priority, ILI can also be caused by a wide range of viral pathogens that present with a spectrum of respiratory symptoms [3-6]. In the tropics, viral respiratory pathogens have been reported to exhibit different seasonality and transmission characteristics compared to temperate climates [2,7-9]. This necessitates a better understanding of their epidemiology to assess the utility and importance of surveillance in these settings. The year-round circulation of respiratory viruses in the tropics may also predispose patients to co-infection with multiple pathogens, with implications for severity of disease [10,11] and secondary bacteria infection [12,13].\n\nWhile there have been studies comparing differences in clinical presentation between influenza and non-influenza cases [14], few describe the epidemiology and differences in clinical presentation among various non-influenza respiratory viruses. As influenza viruses have accounted for only between 10.1% to 53.0% of all ILI cases [15-17], it is important to understand the contribution of other respiratory pathogens to overall morbidity and to determine their epidemiological distribution and clinical presentation.\n\nTo address these issues, this study explores data obtained from a respiratory disease sentinel surveillance system in the Singapore military to examine the etiologic viral agents of respiratory illnesses in a tropical environment, to determine the viruses that circulate post-influenza vaccination, and to compare the differences in clinical presentation.\n\nSingapore is a city-state in tropical South-East Asia with a population of 5.3 million people (mid-year 2012). The Singapore military is based on national service in which all male Citizens and liable Permanent Residents serve for two years after high school. Servicemen typically live in barracks-style accommodation on weekdays and return home on weekends.\n\nThe Singapore military started a sentinel respiratory disease surveillance program in 5 major camps (including a recruit training camp) on 11 May 2009, tracking febrile respiratory illness (FRI) cases (temperature \u226537.5\u00b0C with cough or sore throat). The definition of FRI contrasts with influenza-like illness (ILI, defined as fever \u226538.0\u00b0C with cough or sore throat) to broaden the capture of other febrile cases that also result in absenteeism while limiting cases to those with fever as an indicator of severity. This allows for detection of a larger number of respiratory pathogens.\n\nPatients who visited the primary healthcare clinics in the camps between 11 May 2009 and 31 October 2012 during regular consultation hours who met the FRI criteria were recruited. Healthcare workers obtained written informed consent, administered a questionnaire, obtained clinical specimens and performed a clinical examination on partcipants. Repeat consultations were excluded if the healthcare worker determined that the patient had not recovered from the first illness episode. We also obtained samples from controls (those without respiratory symptoms or acute infections), who were recruited across the year at between 5 to 10 persons per week. Informed consent, the baseline questionnaire, and clinical specimens were obtained.\n\nFrom December 2009, all recruits were administered with the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (FLU-A(H1N1)pdm09) vaccine. The trivalent seasonal influenza vaccination was first introduced to recruits in December 2010, followed henceforth by all other personnel in November 2011.\n\nNasal washes from each side of the nose were taken from consenting participants by trained medical staff, placed in viral transport media and refrigerated. The samples were transported to the laboratory on ice for etiological testing within 24 hours.\n\nLaboratory analysis was performed in an ISO15189-accreditated laboratory for molecular diagnostics which regularly takes part in external proficiency programs such as QCMD EQA programs. Detailed laboratory methods were previously described [14]. We used the multiplex PCR strategy based on the Resplex assays described below, and performed additional singleplex PCR assays to determine the influenza subtype. Total nucleic acids were extracted from each specimen using the DNA minikit (Qiagen, Inc, Valencia, CA, USA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A total of 20 \u03bcl of extract were tested with Resplex I and II (version 2.0, Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) [18] for respiratory micro-organisms on the LiquiChip 200 Workstation, according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The Resplex I and II (version 2.0) assays are multiplex PCR assays coupled with bead array detection technology and can simultaneously detect and subtype 18 different pathogens including influenza A (FLU-A) and influenza B (FLU-B). Specimens that were Resplex II positive for FLU-A were further subtyped with real-time PCR for H1 or H3 (Singapore Ministry of Health), or for FLU-A(H1N1)pdm09. Briefly, 5 \u03bcl of total genetic extracts were tested using an in-house developed assay based on the one-step SuperscriptIII/Platinum Taq kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions on the LightCycler machine from Roche or the Applied Biosystems real-time PCR machine (7500).\n\nThe analysis was limited to viral mono-infections amongst cases to discern clinical presentations and symptom complexes associated with each pathogen. We excluded viruses with fewer than 20 cases (0.6% of the total), as the number was too small to have a reasonable sample size \u2013 these were Coronavirus HKU1 (CoV-HKU1), Parainfluenza 1 (hPIV-1), hPIV-2, hPIV-4, Influenza A(H1N1) (the prepandemic strain), respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV A), RSV B, CoV and Bocavirus (BV). This left 14 viruses for the subsequent analyses.\n\nThe main aim was to compare the differences in clinical expressions, including individual symptoms (or signs), pairs of symptoms, and overall symptom load between patients with different viral infections. We counted the clinical symptoms/signs and calculated the corresponding empirical proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the overall symptom load. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the differences in symptom expressions for each pair. Differences were identified at a significance level of 0.05. To assess the presence of paired symptoms/signs for all viruses, we conducted binomial tests to compare the joint proportions of symptom pairs occurring together to the expected proportions assuming independence of symptoms. The ratio of the observed proportion of symptom pairs relative to the product of the marginal proportion of each symptom is defined as the excess probability ratio which measures effect size. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare the risk of having an individual symptom/sign among viral mono-infections by assigning a categorical variable for all viruses as the primary predictor. Potential confounding was addressed by adjusting the model for age, smoking status, asthma and heart disease. Non-significant variables were dropped at a significance level of 0.05 to obtain the final model. Statistical analyses were performed using the R Statistical Software (version 3.0.0) [19].\n\nEthics approval was given by the Singapore military\u2019s Joint Medical Committee for Research, and the National University of Singapore\u2019s ethics review committee.\n\nThe basic demographic data are described in Table 1. Participants were mostly young male adults, with other characteristics largely similar. However, there were significantly less recruits amongst controls than amongst other groups.\n\nThe temporal distribution of cases is described in Figure 1. No obvious overall seasonal pattern can be observed. The peak in June and July 2009 corresponds to the FLU-A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic [16]. As this peak tailed off, we observed an increase in FLU-B cases (starting Feb\u2013Mar 2010). Subsequently, as the FLU-B cases fell, Adenovirus E (ADV-E) cases started to increase. Coxsackie/echovirus (CV) and rhinovirus (RV) infections were consistently present in the earlier periods but appeared to tail off by 2012, corresponding to the rise in FRI cases due to other viruses.\n\nThe etiologies of selected infections are illustrated in Table 2. At least one virus was detected in 3794 of the 7733 FRI cases (49.1%). In 376 (9.0%) of the 3794 cases, more than one virus was detected and these were excluded. 4120 (53.3%) of the FRI cases fulfilled the definition of ILI; 2146 (52.1%) of these ILI cases were positive for at least 1 virus. Of the 3430 FRI mono-infection cases, 2128 (62.0%) were viral. 1259 (59.2%) of these 2128 cases met the definition of ILI.\n\nWe examined the proportion of ILI cases among those with viral mono-infections (Table 3). Influenza viruses accounted for only 40% of ILI. Among FRI cases, more than 60% of patients with influenza and adenovirus infections presented with ILI. However, several other viral infections led to high rates of ILI, including CV, Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) and CoVs. The sensivity, specifity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of ILI for influenza was 72.2%, 48.1%, 40.1% and 69.3% respectively.\n\nOn univariate comparison of clinical symptoms and signs, Adenovirus B (ADV-B), as well as Influenza A(H3N2) (FLU-A(H3N2)), FLU-A(H1N1)pdm09 and FLU-B tended to cause fever more frequently (0.31 (95% CI: 0.14,0.48), 0.30 (0.21,0.40), 0.23 (0.17,0.28), 0.28 (0.22,0.33)). ADV-E was inclined to cause less respiratory symptoms (cough with phlegm, dry cough, running nose)(-0.08 (-0.17, 0.03), -0.26 (-0.37, -0.16), -0.18 (-0.28, -0.07)).\n\nFrom the multivariate analysis (Figure 2), compared to most other viruses, A FLU-A(H1N1)pdm09 and FLU-A(H3N2) less commonly resulted in sorethroat. Running nose was more common in enterovirus (EV) and RV cases and less common in ADV. FLU-B was more likely than a majority of the other viruses to cause dry cough while EV and ADV-E were less likely to cause dry cough. CoV-OC43 and hMPV were more likely to cause cough with phlegm than the most other viruses. Influenza viruses and adenoviruses were more likely to cause fever \u226538.0\u00b0C.\n\nIn Figure 3, we explored the associations (and dissociations) between different clinical symptoms and signs across all viruses. Some are expected, such as association of fever \u226537.8\u00b0C and fever \u226538.0\u00b0C and dissociation of dry cough and cough with phlegm. Fever \u226538.0\u00b0C was also associated with systematic complaints, such as chills, bodyache, headache and eye pain. Sorethroat was associated with an injected pharynx.\n\nThe analysis was limited to viral mono-infections and future studies should explore co-infections and bacterial infections. This study involved predominantly young adult males, and results may not be generalizable to the overall population, necessitating further studies among various age groups and gender. There were also less recruits amongst controls than amongst other groups, and this would be an important consideration when comparing the two groups in the future. Finally, the actual clinical impact of differentiating between various viral etiological agents may be limited, and we could not determine the relative severity of symptoms other than fever.\n\nOur study highlights the varied etiology for FRI and ILI in the tropical setting \u2013 influenza and ADV and CV were all common. Influenza and ADVs tend to present with higher fever, and vaccination should be considered. The utility of ILI for tropical surveillance of influenza needs to be reviewed given the low PPV and high NPV compared to temperate regions. The surveillance system has enabled the Singapore military to understand the etiologic agents affecting servicemen, hence implementing and evaluating controls measures such as vaccination.\n\nVJL had previously received unrelated research grants from GSK.\n\nXQT wrote the manuscript.
