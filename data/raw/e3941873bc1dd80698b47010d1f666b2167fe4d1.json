Analysis of the sequences showed that the crossover site between other Dutch isolate, D1466/78, is 97%, whereas the pre-ceding nucleotides in the S sequence show an identity of recombination events had occurred. These recombination events seemed to have occurred randomly between 73%. These observations suggested that the evolution of the UK/6/82 isolate involved a recombination event, near the selected primers.

To detect The technique of strain-specific PCR has been shown to be an extremely powerful method for distinguishing hybrid IBV RNAs, following as little selection pressure as possible, we used RT-PCR on virion RNAs produced between closely related virus strains (Banner and Lai, 1991; Jarvis and Kirkegaard, 1992) and opens the possi-from the mixed infections without passage.

An alternative explanation for the detection of hybrid nants using strain-specific PCR. Although oligonucleotide M8 had only two nucleotide mismatches in relation RNA molecules in this study is that they were not derived from genomic RNAs but from subgenomic RNAs, as small to the corresponding Beaudette sequence, the oligonucleotide was shown to be specific for M41. This is in amounts of subgenomic mRNAs were detected in IBV preparations (Zhao et al., 1993) .

Second, this removed the mixture of M41 and Beaudette RNA, indicated that the hybrid RNAs produced following mixed infection had not possibility that the hybrid RNA could have been produced as a result of some RT-PCR artefact. We demonstrated arisen from template switching by either of these two enzymes.
