A fraction of patients do not need hospitalisation, and 27 the symptoms disappear in a short time (around 1-2 weeks). In some cases, 28 COVID-19 causes severe pneumonia, which requires respiratory support and 29 can lead to death, especially in the presence of co-morbidities such as diabetes 30 or hypertension [3] . Patients with severe pneumonia need to be treated in 31 ICUs with the use of mechanical ventilators [1] . 32 We focus on disease diffusion modelling at a regional scale in Italy and 33 3 .

We 34 propose a prediction model at a regional scale that can be adapted and also 35 used at different scales (i.e., countries, regions or even single district) by 36 countries where COVID-19 diffusion is still growing.\n\n2 Data analysis and model 38 We start from the analysis of epidemiological data from Wuhan city (China, which, by law, are designed to be occupied by patients for the 80% at any 60 given time. Also, these are allocated at a regional level proportionally to its 61 population and are usually managed locally (see Table 1 ).\n\nBeds of new ICU beds, the movement of people from one region to another (to 69 5 .

Our model start by considering infected people (X 0 ). A fraction of infected people presents severe symptoms and they need to be hospitalised and treated in ICUs (X 1 ). Diversely, some people may be treated at home (X 2 ) since they do not have severe complications. Treated people has a lethal outcome (X 3 ) while a hopefully large fraction of people is recovered from disease.\n\n.

On the X axis there are days and on the Y axis there are the total number of cases. The two curves are very similar showing that the initial trend of the infection follows an exponential growth, even though the Chinese government rapidly adopted stringent confinement measures. We can thus expect to observe the same initial infection evolution, before arriving to the logistic portion of the curve.\n\n.

In such case note that the government restrictions rapidly 151 adopted allow a slower diffusion of infectious.\n\nNote that in a similar way we map all data for all the 21 Italian regions.\n\n.

We also 156 think that patients management is strictly related to the availability of hos-157 pital structure to manage such kind of diseases that require different and 158 non-standard protocols as use of respiratory devices.
