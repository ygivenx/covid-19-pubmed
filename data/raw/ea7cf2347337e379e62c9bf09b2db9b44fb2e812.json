{"title": "Novel Function of Bluetongue Virus NS3 Protein in Regulation of the MAPK/ERK Signaling Pathway 2 3", "body": "proteins of the outer capsid VP5 and the most variable of BTV protein VP2 representing the 84 main target of neutralizing antibodies and determines the serotype specificity (15, 16). Non-85 structural proteins contribute to the control of BTV replication (17), viral protein synthesis (18), 86 maturation and export from the infected cells (19-23). Initially described for NS4, NS3 has also 87 been shown to counteract the innate immune response, and in particular the type I interferon 88\n\n(IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) pathway (13, 24, 25) . To address the question of BTV modulation with the MAPK/ERK pathway, we used a 118 trans-reporter gene assay that measures Elk1 activation by ERK1/2. In this system, Elk1 119 transcription factor is fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (Gal4-DB) and leads to the 120 expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene downstream of a promoter sequence containing 121 a Gal4 binding site. Upon stimulation with a growth factor like EGF, Elk1 was activated as 122 assessed by a 5-fold increase of luciferase activity compared to unstimulated HEK-293T cells 123 ( Figure 1A ; mock control). Cells infected with BTV at different MOIs showed a very strong 124 enhancement in this cellular pathway, even in absence of EGF stimulation ( Figure 1A) , and in 125 a MOI-dependent manner. Moreover, the inability of a UV-inactivated BTV to activate the 126 luciferase reporter gene indicated that the induction of MAPK/ERK was dependent on viral 127 replication or de novo viral protein expression. To determine whether viral protein(s) could be 128 involved in the MAPK/ERK activation, we tested separately all the BTV proteins in our reporter 129 assay. As shown in Figure 1B , only BTV-NS3 is able to strongly activate the MAPK/ERK 130 pathway both in presence or absence of EGF stimulation. Thus, the activation of the 131 (with Mascot scores of 64 and 104, respectively) whereas BRAF was not detected in the control 140 conditions (mock infected-or empty pCI-neo-3xFLAG transfected-cells). The identified 141 peptides corresponding to BRAF are listed in Table 1 . 142 BRAF, together with ARAF and CRAF, are members of the RAF kinase family that 143 play a central role in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Therefore, binding to 144 BRAF represents a potential molecular mechanism underlying this manipulation that we 145 decided to investigate. To validate this interaction, full-length BTV-NS3 (NS3FL) and different 146 fragments of NS3 ( Figure 2A ) were tested for their ability to interact with endogenous BRAF. 147\n\nTo do so, GST-tagged NS3FL or indicated fragments were expressed in HEK-293T cells and 148 purified 48 h later with glutathione-sepharose beads. As shown in Figure 2B , endogenous 149 BRAF copurified only with NS3FL. 150\n\nUsing the same luciferase assay, we showed that only full-length BTV-NS3 is able to 151 enhance Elk1 activation ( Figure 2C ). In contrast, the indicated fragments of NS3 were unable 152 to do so, consistently with the previous pull-down assays ( Figure 2B ). Altogether, these results 153 demonstrate that only the full-length BTV-NS3 interacts with BRAF and activates the 154 MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. 155 156\n\nTo further decipher the impact of BTV-NS3 on the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, we 159 compared the phosphorylation kinetics of ERK1/2 and eIF4E in HEK-293T cells infected by 160 BTV ( Figure 3A ) and in cells expressing BTV-NS3 ( Figure 3B ). HEK-293T cells were infected 161 with BTV (MOI=0.01) and 24 h later, cells were serum-starved for 12 h before being stimulated 162 with EGF. Phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, determined at 10, 30, 120 min, 6 h and 24 h after 163 stimulation, were markedly and reproducibly higher after BTV infection compared to mock 164 author/funder.

Interestingly, we observed that BTV also induced ERK1/2 165 phosphorylation even in absence of EGF stimulation. This is reminiscent to what was observed 166 for Elk1 activation ( Figure 1A) showing a significant activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway 167 by BTV. In parallel, we also determined the phosphorylation level of the translation initiation 168 factor eIF4E, a downstream target of this pathway that is involved in the control of mRNA 169 translation. In contrast to ERK1/2, the phosphorylation level of eIF4E in BTV infected-cells 170 was increased only at later time points after EGF stimulation whereas p-eIF4E decreased in 171 mock condition ( Figure 3A) . 172\n\nIn parallel to the BTV infectious context, cells were transfected with 3xFLAG-tagged 173 BTV-NS3 or a control plasmid. After 24 h, cells were serum-starved and the phosphorylation 174 levels of ERK1/2 and eIF4E were measured at the same time points post-EGF stimulation as 175 before. Like BTV infection, similar phosphorylation kinetics of ERK1/2 and eIF4E were 176 observed for BTV-NS3 expression alone ( Figure 3B ). In conclusion, these phosphorylation 177 kinetics confirm that either BTV infection or transient expression of BTV-NS3 can both 178 activate the MAPK/ERK pathway. 179\n\nAlthough HEK-293T are highly efficient for transfection and support BTV replication, 182 we aimed to complement our analysis by carrying out similar experiments using a cell line 183 derived from a host naturally infected by BTV. To do so, we measured phosphorylation levels 184 of ERK1/2 in a bovine kidney cell line (MDBK). MDBK cells were serum-starved and infected 185 with BTV at different MOIs for 24 h. As shown in Figure 4A , BTV increased phosphorylation 186 levels of ERK1/2 in a MOI-dependent manner, which is consistent to what was observed for 187 Elk1 activation in HEK-293T cells infected with BTV ( Figure 1A) . 188 author/funder.

Cells were 190 serum-starved and infected with BTV (MOI=0.01). Then, BTV-NS3 and BRAF localizations 191 were analyzed at 24 h post-infection by fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 4B ). Firstly, in mock-192 infected cells, BRAF is present throughout the cytosol with a sparse punctate distribution. As 193 expected, in cells infected by BTV, NS3 is localized in specific cytoplasmic structures 194 evocative of the Golgi apparatus but also at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, we also found 195 that the subcellular distribution of BTV-NS3 matched the relocalization of BRAF in infected cells. These results demonstrated that BTV-NS3 alters the localization of BRAF, which 197 may contribute to the BTV-activated MAPK/ERK pathway. 198\n\nreplication 201\n\nTo demonstrate that enhancement of Elk1 activation by BTV-NS3 is completely 202 dependent on ERK1/2 activation, HEK-293T cells were transfected with 3xFLAG-tagged 203 BTV-NS3 or a control plasmid, and 24 h later treated with MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 ( Figure  204 5A). The U0126 molecule targets MEK1/2 that are directly activated by BRAF proteins (40). 205\n\nAs shown in Figure 5A , NS3-induced Elk1 activation was completely inhibited by U0126. To 206 confirm these results, we measured the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and eIF4E in HEK-207 293T cells treated with U0126 before infection with BTV. As observed for Elk1 activation, 208 U0126 efficiently blocked the phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and eIF4E after BTV infection 209 ( Figure 5B ). Interestingly, the presence of U0126 also prevented the expression of BTV-NS3. 210\n\nTo test if this inhibitor could have an antiviral effect on BTV replication, HEK-293T cells were 211 treated with MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and infected with BTV (MOI=0.01). As shown in Figure  212 5C, HEK-293T cells treated with U0126 exhibited significant lower viral titers compared to the 213 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Interestingly, it has been reported that the 247 activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway could be associated with the inhibition of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 248 synthesis (41). Therefore, we asked if the activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway by BTV-NS3 249 is required for an efficient control of the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response. Using a luciferase gene reporter 250 assay, we tested NS3FL and its fragments for their capacity to inhibit an IFN-\u03b2 specific promoter 251 downstream a stimulation with a constitutively active form of RIG-I (N\u0394RIG-I for N-terminal 252\n\nCARDs of RIG-I). As shown in Figure 8A , only NS3FL fully blocked the IFN-\u03b2 promoter 253 activity. Moreover, while NS3118-229 and NS3\u0394118-182 fragments were not able to activate Elk1 254 as previously shown in Figure 2C , both are partially, but significantly, able to block the IFN-\u03b2 255 promoter activity ( Figure 8A ). As a complementary approach, we used the MEK1/2 inhibitor 256 U1026 and measure its impact on the capacity of BTV-NS3 to inhibit the IFN-\u03b2 promoter 257 activity. As shown in Figure 8B , the U0126 molecule was unable to prevent the antagonist 258 function of BTV-NS3 on the induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and thus to rescue a significant activation of 259 the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the activation of MAPK/ERK by 260 BTV-NS3 does not contribute its antagonist activity on the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 synthesis. 261 262 author/funder.

The 266 MAPK/ERK pathway contains one of the most highly conserved family of serine/threonine 267 kinases from yeast to humans, which regulates a multiplicity of cellular processes including 268 cell survival, proliferation and differentiation, as well as immune and inflammatory responses. 269 Therefore, many viruses have been shown to modulate this pathway for their own benefit (33). 270\n\nConsidering that its aberrant activation represents an important step toward carcinogenesis, the 271 modulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway has been initially described for DNA tumor viruses 272 and oncogenic retroviruses. However, non-oncogenic RNA viruses are also able to activate this 273 signaling cascade even if the molecular mechanisms underlying this manipulation, in particular 274 in term of protein-protein interactions, often remain a pending question. 275\n\nIn this report, we show that BTV activates the MAPK/ERK pathway as assessed by 276 Elk1 transactivation and phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and eIF4E, which is reminiscent to 277 findings of Mortola and colleagues (37), but we also give the first example of a BTV protein 278 that contributes to this positive regulation. We further demonstrate that both BTV infection and 279 NS3 expression alone also activate the MAPK/ERK pathway in the absence of external stimuli. 280\n\nMoreover, our data provide molecular basis to this activity through the identification of BRAF 281 as a new interactor of BTV-NS3 together with the fact that BRAF silencing impairs BTV-282 activated MAPK/ERK signaling. Intriguingly, two other studies have shown that BTV does not 283 activate the MAPK/ERK pathway (38, 39). However, their findings are not necessarily in 284 contradiction with our current data. This apparent discrepancy does not appear to depend on 285 factors related to the virus used as we have demonstrated that NS3 proteins from at least three 286 serotypes of BTV have similar abilities to bind BRAF and activate the MAPK/ERK pathway. 287 author/funder.

One possible 288 explanation could be that, in contrast to these previous studies, all of our experiments were 289 performed under starvation conditions, which is likely to be essential since the MAPK/ERK 290 pathway is activated in response to growth factors. 291\n\nIn contrast to BTV, NS3 proteins from EHDV, AHSV and EEV are unable to activate 292 the MAPK/ERK pathway suggesting that BTV-NS3 is likely to be functionally distinct from 293 other Orbiviruses NS3 proteins. Although BTV-NS3 shares several domains with EHDV-NS3, 294\n\nAHSV-NS3 and EEV-NS3 (e.g. the amphipathic helix at the N terminus, the late-domain 295 motifs, the extracellular and the two transmembrane domains) (23, 42), these proteins are 296 genetically different. Indeed, the NS3 proteins of AHSV and EEV only share \u00bb30% of sequence 297 homology with BTV-NS3 whereas the protein sequence is more conserved between BTV-NS3 298 and EHDV-NS3 (57% of sequence homology), which is consistent with the fact that both BTV 299 and EHDV are transmitted to ruminants. Although we have currently no explanation for this 300 apparent specificity of BTV, these differences in protein sequence could account for their 301 capacity or incapacity to activate the MAPK/ERK pathway. Nevertheless, further investigations 302 will be needed to understand how the MAPK activation could provide an advantage for BTV 303 at molecular/cellular level in comparison to other orbiviruses. 304\n\nConsidering that ERK1/2 regulate more than 160 downstream target factors (43), 305 activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway by BTV could have several consequences on host cell 306 biology. It triggers both NF-kB, c-Jun and STAT1 transcription factors (44, 45) leading to an 307 increased expression of inflammatory factors, in particular cytokines and chemokines that 308 participate to immunity and inflammation such as IL-6 and IL-8 (46-48). Although expression 309 of cytokines and chemokines are critical for developing an efficient antiviral response, their 310 excessive production could also lead to deleterious inflammation by causing tissue damages 311 and, therefore, contributing to disease pathogenesis. Indeed, both in vivo and in vitro studies 312 author/funder. All rights reserved.

A consequence of such production could be an aggravation of the 314 endothelial injury associated with an increased vascular permeability as already observed in 315 severe cases of BT disease (10, 56). Altogether, our data suggest that BTV-NS3 interaction 316 with BRAF enhances MAPK/ERK activation above normal level in infected cells, possibly 317 contributing to a deregulation of the blood vessels permeability to promote BTV replication 318 and spreading. 319\n\nBesides its effects on immunity and inflammation, activation of the MAPK/ERK 320 pathway has considerable consequences on viral replication as assessed by experiments using 321 Our findings support a model where BTV-NS3 interacts with BRAF to activate 352 MAPK/ERK pathway. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating both 353 BRAF as a target of a viral protein and this interaction as an important step toward a viral 354 manipulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. We also demonstrate that BTV infection leads to a 355 re-localization of BRAF either at the cell membrane or the Golgi apparatus. Initially described 356 to be mainly regulated at the plasma membrane (71, 72), it has now been clearly established 357 that the control of MAPK/ERK pathway can also occur in the Golgi apparatus (73). Thus, these 358 specific localizations could contribute to the aggregation of NS3-BRAF complexes to enhance 359 MAPK/ERK signaling. Further analyses with confocal microscopy will be needed to confirm 360 the colocalization between NS3 and BRAF and additional biochemical investigations are still 361 required to decipher how this viral protein activates BRAF and the downstream events of this 362 author/funder.
