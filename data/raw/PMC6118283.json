{"title": "Elevated serum LAMC2 is associated with lymph node metastasis and predicts poor prognosis in penile squamous cell carcinoma", "body": "Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is a relatively rare malignant tumor worldwide; however, in developing countries, it has a much higher incidence and accounts for up to 2% of malignancies in men.1 The major risk factors mainly comprise human papilloma virus infection, phimosis, and poor hygiene.2 The involvement of local lymph nodes (LNs) is the major prognostic factor in PSCC.3\u20135 The main treatment for PSCC is currently a partial or radical penectomy with or without bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy, along with radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.1,6\u20139\n\nSome classical serum biomarkers (such as CEA, AFP, PSA, and CA-199) are clinically useful in many cancers10\u201312; however, they are not suitable in penile cancer. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) were reported to be prognostic markers in PSCC.13\u201315 However, large-scale investigations are required to assess the clinical application of these markers. The discovery of more serologic biomarkers would be helpful in guiding treatment and predicting prognosis in PSCC.\n\nTogether with laminin alpha 3 and laminin beta 3, laminin gamma 2 (LAMC2) composes the heterotrimeric basement membrane component laminin 332 and plays important physiologic and pathologic roles through its involvement in cellular migration and adhesion, especially in the processes of tumor invasion and metastasis.16 It has been reported that the overexpression of LAMC2 is associated with a poor prognosis in numerous cancers,17\u201319 and cytoplasmic accumulation of LAMC2, as opposed to its extracellular deposition in the basement membrane, is correlated with cancer metastasis and poor prognosis.18 Interestingly, elevated LAMC2 levels have also been detected in peripheral blood, indicating that LAMC2 could be a novel cancer biomarker.12,19 However, the expression level of LAMC2 and its clinical significance are unknown in PSCC.\n\nIn this study, we found that LAMC2 was overexpressed in PSCC tissues and facilitated the metastasis of cancer cells and that elevated serum LAMC2 (sLAMC2) levels predicted poor disease-specific survival (DSS) and could aid in risk stratification of early-stage PSCC patients.\n\nOne hundred fourteen patients newly diagnosed with PSCC were included in this study. All patients underwent a partial or radical penectomy with or without bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) between 2009 and 2015. Surgical specimens were collected and then paraffin-embedded or cryopreserved with liquid nitrogen. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Board of SYSUCC, and written informed consent was obtained from each person. The pathologic TNM stage was redetermined by two pathologists according to the 2018 American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging system for PSCC. The clinicopathologic characteristics are presented in Table S1.\n\nsLAMC2 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (USCN Life Sciences, Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, and the serum SCC-Ag and CRP concentrations were measured at the Department of Molecular Diagnosis, SYSUCC, before surgery. High or low levels of sLAMC2, CRP, and SCC-Ag were distinguished by their corresponding cutoff values (sLAMC2: 108 ng/mL; CRP: 5.0 mg/mL; and SCC-Ag: 1.5 ng/mL). The cutoff values of sLAMC2 and CRP were obtained by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, whereas the cutoff value for SCC-Ag followed the clinical guidelines.\n\nIHC assays were conducted as previously described to detect LAMC2 and E-cadherin expression in tissues. Briefly, 4-\u03bcm-thick formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, followed by antigen retrieval and endogenous peroxidase inactivation.20,21 After blocking, the slides were incubated with LAMC2 (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) or E-cadherin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology [CST], Danvers, MA, USA), followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (CST), and were then visualized using a peroxidase Envision kit (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). All slides were independently evaluated by two pathologists to determine the percentage of cancer cells with positive staining. Cells with cytoplasmic staining were considered to be positive for LAMC2, while cells with membrane staining were positive for E-cadherin (Figure S1). According to the definitions used in previous reports, a high level of LAMC2 expression in tumor tissues (tLAMC2) was defined as more than 30% of the tumor cells staining positive for LAMC2,17,22 while a low level of E-cadherin expression was defined as less than 90% of the tumor cells staining positive for E-cadherin.23\n\nLAMC2 mRNA levels in tumor tissues were detected by RT-qPCR. Briefly, total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed using PrimeScript\u2122 Master Mix (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), and quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex Taq\u2122 (TaKaRa) with specific primers (Table S2). The relative expression of genes is presented as 2\u2212\u0394Ct (normalized against GAPDH expression).24,25\n\nWB was performed as previously described26,27 to analyze protein levels in cells and frozen tissues. Briefly, protein samples were routinely extracted, quantified, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with LAMC2-(Sigma-Aldrich Co.), E-cadherin-, N-cadherin-, ZEB-1-, ZO-1-, vimentin-, or GAPDH-specific antibodies (CST) (1:1000\u20132000), followed by incubation with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (CST). The bands were visualized with Clarity Western ECL Substrate and detected through a ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).\n\nPSCC cell lines (Penl1, Penl2, and 149RCa) were established in our laboratory.28\u201330 HaCaT and 293T cells were obtained from the CAS Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).\n\nStable cell lines with overexpressing or silenced LAMC2 were established according to the methods described previously.31,32 Briefly, LAMC2 cDNA was cloned into the pCDH-EF1-CMV-MCS-T2A-Puro vector (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and LAMC2 shRNAs (Table S3) were inserted into the pLko.1 vector (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). Recombinant lentiviruses were packaged in 293T cells and used to construct the stable cell lines.\n\nPSCC cells were cultured in 96-well plates for the indicated times, and cell proliferation was then analyzed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay (Dojindo, Japan) and represented by the optical density at 450 nm (OD450nm).33\n\nTranswell assays were used to evaluate the migration and invasion abilities of PSCC cells, as previously described.34,35 Briefly, 1\u00d7105 Penl2 cells, 2\u00d7105 Penl1 cells, or 2\u00d7105 149 RCa cells were seeded into Boyden chambers (8 \u03bcm pore) without or with Matrigel coating (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). After 18 or 24 hours of incubation for the migration or invasion assays, respectively, cells on the lower surface of the filter were fixed, stained, and counted under a microscope. All assays were performed in duplicate and were repeated three times.\n\nAnimal experiments were approved by the SYSUCC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee following the Animal Welfare and Rights in China. Male BALB/c nude mice (4\u20135 weeks old; SLRC Laboratory Animals, Shanghai, China) were used to generate an inguinal LN metastasis model, as described previously.31 Two million cells were injected into the foot pads of the mice (n=10/group). The mice were killed after 10~12 weeks, and inguinal LNs were examined.\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical software: the chi-squared test was used for the correlation analyses, the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate the HR for death, Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis with a log-rank test was used for the survival analysis, and ROC curve analysis was used to calculate the optimum cutoff values. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.\n\nLAMC2 expression was significantly upregulated at the mRNA level (29/30, Figure 1A) and protein level (14/15, Figure 1B) in the PSCC tissues compared to that in paired normal epithelial tissues. Moreover, LAMC2 expression was higher in LN metastatic lesions than in primary cancer tissues (Figure 1C). There was more cytoplasmic accumulation of LAMC2 in PSCC tissues than normal tissues, and the ratio of local PSCC tissues expressing high level of LAMC2 is higher in patients with LN metastasis (LNMP) than in LN metastasis-free patients (MFP) (Figure 1D).\n\nThe concentration of sLAMC2 was markedly higher in PSCC patients with LN metastasis than those in MFP and healthy age-matched volunteers, while no differences were found between the two latter groups (Figure 1E). Moreover, the sLAMC2 level likely gradually increased with more advanced N stage (Figure 1E). These data suggest that overexpression of LAMC2 is mainly related to LN metastasis in PSCC.\n\nLAMC2 was expressed at a significantly higher level in PSCC cells than in the immortalized human keratinocyte HaCaT cells (Figure 2A), in accordance with the findings in clinical cases. Penl1 and Penl2 cells showed much higher LAMC2 expression than 149RCa cells.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that LAMC2 overexpression significantly increased the migration and invasion of 149RCa cells (Figure 2A, B), whereas LAMC2 silencing significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of Penl1 and Penl2 cells (Figure 2A, C). Moreover, LAMC2 knockdown significantly reduced the ability of Penl2 cells to metastasize to inguinal LN (Figure 2D). However, overexpression and knockdown of LAMC2 did not obviously affect the proliferation of PSCC cells (Figure S2). Taken together, these results indicate that LAMC2 may play important roles in promoting PSCC cell migration, invasion, and LN metastasis.\n\nThe expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and ZO1 was found to be downregulated in LAMC2-overexpressing 149RCa cells and upregulated in LAMC2-silenced Penl1 and Penl2 cells compared to their corresponding control cells (Figure 2E); conversely, the expression of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and ZEB1 decreased in LAMC2-silenced Penl1 and Penl2 cells and increased in LAMC2-overexpressing 149RCa cells (Figure 2E). The clinical data analysis revealed that a high level of tLAMC2 displayed a close correlation with low expression of E-cadherin in PSCC tissues and that a high sLAMC2 level was also correlated with a low E-cadherin level (Figure 2F). These data suggest that LAMC2 may promote EMT and then facilitate PSCC metastasis.\n\nAs LAMC2 promotes LN metastasis, the relationship between LAMC2 expression and clinicopathologic parameters was investigated in 114 PSCC patients, and the prognosis of these patients was estimated. The results showed that a high level of tLAMC2 was strongly correlated with pathologic grade and N stage but not with T stage (Table 1); the tLAMC2 level was also correlated with the sLAMC2 level, which was associated not only with pathologic grade and N stage but also with T stage (Table 1).\n\nThe univariate Cox regression analysis suggested that the LAMC2 (both tLAMC2 and sLAMC2), SCC-Ag, and CRP levels, along with T stage, N stage, and pathologic grade, showed significant prognostic value for survival (Table S4). The Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis suggested that tLAMC2, sLAMC2, SCC-Ag, and CRP levels were significantly correlated with DSS in PSCC; however, patients with a high level of sLAMC2 had markedly lower 3-year survival rates than those with a high level of tLAMC2, SCC-Ag, or CRP (sLAMC2 42.7% vs tLAMC2 62.0%, SCC-Ag 55.8%, or CRP 58.0%) (Figure 3A\u2013D).\n\nFurthermore, we combined T/N stage and pathologic grade with each potential biomarker in a multivariate Cox regression analysis and found that among the levels of tLAMC2, sLAMC2, SCC-Ag, and CRP, only sLAMC2 level was an independent prognostic indicator for DSS in PSCC patients (Table 2 and Table S5). These data indicate that sLAMC2 is a more important risk factor for DSS in PSCC patients than tLAMC2, SCC-Ag, or CRP.\n\nA subgroup survival analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive value of sLAMC2 for the survival of patients stratified by T stage, pathologic grade, and N stage. The results showed that a high sLAMC2 level indicated a high risk of death in patients at a less-advanced T stage (T1/a or T2) and without LN metastasis (N0/X) but did not in those with T3/4 stage or N+ stage disease, while there were no differences in the prognostic value of sLAMC2 among the different pathologic grade classifications (Table 3). Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis demonstrated that sLAMC2 level was significantly associated with DSS in PSCC patients at the T1/a, T2, and N0/X stages, and the cumulative 3-year survival rates were markedly lower in the high-LAMC2 group than in the low-LAMC2 group (T1/a: 50.0% vs 93.5%; T2: 47.4% vs 91.0%; and N0/X: 80% vs 91.1%) (Figure 3E\u2013G).\n\nSerologic markers are more accessible for detection compared to the pathologic parameters, although pathologic indicators are the most important prognostic factors, especially the N stage.3 Serum markers, such as AFP, CEA, PSA, and CA19.9, have been widely applied in clinical practice as adjuncts to clinicopathologic parameters for monitoring tumor progression and predicting survival.10\u201312 However, few valuable prognostic serologic factors have been identified in PSCC. Although serum CRP and SCC-Ag levels have been reported to predict postoperative recurrence, progression, and prognosis in PSCC,13\u201315 their prognostic values need to be validated by large-scale investigations.\n\nIn previous reports, elevated expression of LAMC2 was detected in numerous malignancies,17\u201319 and cytoplasmic accumulation of LAMC2 and/or an increase in serum LAMC2 was correlated with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis in patients.12,18,19 Here, we found that LAMC2 expression was upregulated, LAMC2 demonstrated an especially high cytoplasmic accumulation in PSCC tissues, and that LAMC2 overexpression was associated with LN metastasis in PSCC. Furthermore, sLAMC2 level was associated with N stage and pathologic grade in the analyzed patients. The relationship between LAMC2 level and N stage in PSCC patients was also supported by the results of our in vitro and in vivo experiments, which indicated that LAMC2 promoted PSCC cell metastasis. The effects of LAMC2 on PSCC cells may partially result from LAMC2-directed EMT in PSCC cells; this hypothesis is supported by previous reports showing that EMT endows cells with migratory and invasive properties.23\n\nElevated levels of both tLAMC2 and sLAMC2 were significantly associated with shorter DSS in PSCC patients; however, N stage, pathologic grade, and sLAMC2, but not tLAMC2, SCC-Ag, or CRP, were independent prognostic factors according to the multivariate regression analysis in our study. These results may be in accordance with the lower HRs for tLAMC2, SCC-Ag, or CRP compared to those for N stage, pathologic grade, and sLAMC2 (Table S4). Thus, we speculate that sLAMC2 is a more important predictive factor for survival in PSCC patients than SCC-Ag and CRP, which have been previously reported to be potential predictive factors in PSCC patients. In particular, the stratification analysis revealed that sLAMC2 level showed more predictive value for DSS in patients with early-stage penile cancer (such as patients at the N0/X stage). However, due to the lower number of patients at the T3/4 stage in our analysis, we cannot conclude that sLAMC2 level showed more predictive value in early T-stage penile cancer, and this finding needs to be further investigated in a large cohort.\n\nAccording to the NCCN Guidelines for Penile Cancer (Version 2.2018), up to 25% of penile cancer patients with nonpalpable LNs harbor micrometastases and several predictive factors and risk stratification systems have been evaluated for the prediction of the presence of occult node metastasis.36 However, these factors and systems are based on pathologic diagnosis, which may introduce errors because of the heterogeneity of tumors and the limitations of sampling. Our findings in this study suggested that serum LAMC2 level might be useful for risk stratification in these patients and might add prognostic information to the conventional clinicopathologic risk factors.\n\nHowever, some barriers must be overcome in the development of sLAMC2 as a serologic index from the bench to the clinic. First, independent, multicenter, large-scale retrospective studies will be necessary. Next, prospective controlled clinical trials are also needed before this index can be brought into clinical use, especially for LN metastasis prediction and treatment monitoring. There are some limitations in our study: 1) only a small sample of PSCC patients from a single center was included, so selection bias is inevitable; 2) the number of patients at an advanced T stage (T3/4) or with LN metastasis (N+) was lower than the number of patients at the T1/2 or N0 stage, so we could not confirm that sLAMC2 level does not have predictive value for DSS in PSCC patients at a high T stage (T3/4) or with LN metastasis (N+); and 3) the diversity of adjuvant therapy may also affect the analysis. Given the deficiencies mentioned above, all of the analyses in this study were regarded as hypothesis generating rather than hypothesis testing.\n\nOur study revealed that LAMC2 plays a critical role in PSCC progression and metastasis; elevated sLAMC2 levels were strongly correlated with advanced clinicopathologic parameters, especially LN metastasis, in PSCC patients; sLAMC2 level might serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in PSCC patients, especially in those with early-stage penile cancer (especially patients at the N0/X stages); the predictive value of sLAMC2 level is superior to that of CRP and SCC-Ag previously reported in PSCC patients. Certainly, studies based on large samples from multiple centers are needed to assess the possibility of clinical application of LAMC2."}
