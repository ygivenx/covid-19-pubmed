{"title": "Cross-reactive antibody response between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections 2 3 18", "body": "The emergence of spread of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing severe 42 respiratory disease has now led to a pandemic with major impact on global 43 health, economy and societal behavior (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International 44 Committee on Taxonomy of, 2020; Poon and Peiris, 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . As of 2020\n\nMarch 15, over 150,000 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported with close 46 to 6,000 deaths. Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-\n\nCoV, a coronavirus that also caused a global outbreak in 2003, are closely related 48 phylogenetically, with genomic nucleotide sequence identity of around 80% (Wu et al., 49 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Moreover, it has been shown that both viruses use the 50 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for cell entry and infection 51 (Letko et al., 2020; Li et al., 2003) .\n\nThe spike glycoprotein (S) on the surface of coronaviruses is essential for virus entry 54 through binding to the ACE2 receptor and viral fusion with the host cell. The S protein 55 forms a homotrimer in which each protomer is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2 56 (Figure 1A) . Binding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit and 57 the ACE2 receptor triggers a conformational change in the S protein that subsequently 58 initiates membrane fusion events with the host cell. The RBD is also a primary target of 59 the antibody response in humoral immunity and is believed to be the major protective 60 antigen (Chen et al., 2005) . The prefusion structure of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has 61 been recently determined by cryo-EM (Wrapp et al., 2020) , and revealed overall 62 structural similarity to that of SARS-CoV. However, most monoclonal antibodies tested 63 to date that target the RBD of SARS-CoV have failed to bind to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 64 (Tian et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) , suggesting that the antigenicity of these two 4 polyclonal human sera from patients to evaluate the antibody response elicited by 67 SARS-CoV-2 infection and to determine whether cross-reactive antibody responses 68 between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV can be generated. In this study, we examined the 69 antibody responses in 15 patients from Hong Kong who were infected by SARS-CoV-2, 70 and seven by SARS-CoV. Mice infected or immunized with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV 71 were also used to investigate cross-reactivity of antibody responses between SARS-\n\nCoV-2 and SARS-CoV.\n\nFifteen heparin anticoagulated plasma samples (from day 2 to 22 post-symptom onset) 77 from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were analyzed (Table S1 ). Binding of plasma to the 78 S ectodomain and RBD of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (see Methods) was 79 measured by ELISA ( Figure 1B , Figure S1 ). Plasma samples from healthy donors 80 collected from the Hong Kong Red Cross served as controls. As compared to the 81 plasma from healthy donors, plasma from patients from day 10 post-symptom onward 82 reacted strongly in ELISA binding assays to the S ectodomain (p-value < 2e-16, two-83 tailed t-test) and RBD (p-value = 2e-13, two-tailed t-test) of SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, 84 the plasma from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients could also cross-react, although less 85 strongly, with the SARS-CoV S ectodomain (p-value = 8e-06, two-tailed t-test) and the 86 SARS-CoV RBD (p-value = 0.048, two-tailed t-test) ( Figure 1B) . Nevertheless, only five 87 of the samples from the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients had convincing antibody binding 88 responses to the SARS-CoV RBD. The other plasma reacted more weakly or not at all 89 with the SARS-CoV RBD ( Figure 1B ). This result indicates that the cross-reactive 90 antibody response to the S protein after SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly targets non-RBD 91 regions. Consistent with that observation, reactivity of the plasma from SARS-CoV-2-\n\n. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Similar to that observed in 97 plasma samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, cross-reactivity in binding could be 98 detected ( Figure 1B) . As compared to the plasma from healthy donors, SARS-CoV-99 infected patients have significant cross-reactivity in binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike (p-100 value = 0.03, two-tailed t-test), RBD (p-value = 0.03, two-tailed t-test), and S2 subunit (p-101 value = 0.007, two-tailed t-test). These results show that cross-reactivity in binding is 102 common between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in both directions.\n\nWe next tested the neutralization activity of these plasma samples from SARS-CoV-2-106 infected patients. Except for four plasma samples that came from patients with less than 107 12 days post-symptom onset with concomitantly low reactivity to both SARS-CoV-2 S 108 ectodomain and RBD, all other plasma samples could neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus 109 with titers ranging from 1:40 to 1:640 ( Figure 1C , Table S1 ). However, only one plasma 110 sample could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV, with very low neutralization activity (1:10). In 111 fact, that cross-neutralizing plasma sample had the strongest reactivity in binding against 112 SARS-CoV S ectodomain among all 15 patient samples, although its binding activity 113 against SARS-CoV RBD is not particularly strong (Table S1 ).\n\nSimilarly, while five of the seven plasma samples from SARS-CoV-convalescent patients 116 could neutralize SARS-CoV with titers ranging from 1:40 to 1:320, none can cross-117 neutralize SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1C ). These results show that although cross-reactivity in 118 . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Plasma from mice with mock immunization with a genetically more distant 126 betacoronavirus coronavirus OC43-CoV, PBS or adjuvant were used as negative 127 controls (Figure 2A -D) . As compared to controls, plasma from mice immunized with 128 SARS-CoV-2 virus reacted strongly to its autologous S ectodomain (p-value < 0.002, 129 two-tailed t-test, Figure 2A ) and RBD (p-value < 1e-4, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2B ).\n\nSimilarly, plasma from mice immunized with SARS-CoV virus reacted strongly to its 131 autologous S ectodomain (p-value < 2e-7, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2C ) and RBD (p-value 132 < 6e-6, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2D ). In addition, plasma from mice immunized with 133 SARS-CoV S ectodomain could react to its autologous RBD (p-value < 0.02, two-tailed t-134 test, Figure 2D ). However, while plasma from mice infected with SARS-CoV virus could 135 react with its autologous S ectodomain (p-value < 8e-6, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2C ) and 136 RBD (p-value < 2e-5, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2D ), the reactivity of plasma from mice 137 infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus to its autologous S ectodomain and RBD could not be 138 observed in this assay (p-value > 0.28, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2A -B). Unlike SARS-CoV 139 virus, which can replicate in wild-type mice (Yang et al., 2004) , it has been recently 140 shown that SARS-CoV-2 is only able to replicate in human ACE2-expression transgenic The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.993097 doi: bioRxiv preprint 7 Interestingly, we observed some cross-reactivity of plasma from SARS-CoV-2-145 immunized mice to the SARS-CoV S ectodomain (p-value < 4e-5, two-tailed t-test, 146 Figure 2C ) and less so to SARS-CoV RBD (p-value < 0.006, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2D ), 147 as well as plasma from SARS-CoV-infected mice to the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain (p-148 value < 0.005, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2A ). The conclusion that the cross-reactive 149 antibodies mostly target non-RBD regions is supported by the stronger reactivity of the 150 antibody responses from SARS-CoV-2 immunization with the SARS-CoV S ectodomain 151 than to its RBD, and that plasma from SARS-CoV-infected mice did not react at all with 152 SARS-CoV-2 RBD (p-value > 0.5, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2B ). Despite the presence of \n\nThe work here shows that antibody responses in the SARS-CoV-2 infected patient 159 cohort are generated to both S protein and RBD in the majority of the patients.\n\nFurthermore, cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV can be detected in these plasma samples 161 as well as in mice studies. These cross-reactive antibody responses mostly target non-162 RBD regions. Consistently, higher sequence conservation is found between the S2 163 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (90% amino-acid sequence identity) as 164 compared to that of their RBDs (73% amino-acid sequence identity). Nonetheless, some 165 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were able to produce cross-reactive antibody responses 166 to SARS-CoV RBD. Consistent with these findings, a human antibody CR3022 that The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.993097 doi: bioRxiv preprint 8 While cross-reactive antibody binding responses to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S 171 proteins appears to be relatively common in this cohort, cross-neutralizing responses are 172 rare. Only one out of 15 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients was able to generate a cross-173 neutralizing response to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses, and this cross-174 reactive response was very weak. Therefore, it is possible that only a subset of the 175 cross-reactive binding epitopes is a bona fide neutralizing epitope. This notion is also 176 supported by our recent study, which showed that the cross-reactive antibody CR3022 177 could not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 despite its strong binding (Yuan et al., 2020) .
