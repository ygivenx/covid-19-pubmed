{"title": "A proposal of alternative primers for the ARTIC Network's multiplex PCR to improve coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing", "body": "of this rapidly spreading viral disease. We have also seen the great performance of their primer set and protocol; the primer set amplifies all desired 98 PCR amplicons with fairly small amplification bias from clinical samples with relatively high viral load. However, we also observed an acute drop of reads derived from some amplicons especially amplicon 18 and 76 in \"pool 2\" as a sample's viral load decreases. We suspected this low coverage issue was due to dimer formation between primers targeting those two amplicons. Indeed, replacement of just one of those primers, nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT, to a newly designed primer resulted in a drastic improvement of coverages at both regions targeted by the amplicons 18 and 76.\n\nGiven this result, we further replaced four primers in \"pool 1\" with each respective alternative.\n\nThese modifications also improved coverage in eight amplicons particularly in samples with low viral load. The results of our experiments clearly indicate that primer dimer formation is one critical cause of coverage bias in ARTIC protocol. Importantly, some of the problematic primers are detectable by observing primer dimers in raw NGS sequence reads and replacing them with alternatives as shown in this study. We expect a continuous improvement of the ARTIC primer set will extend the limit for completion of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to samples with lower viral load, that supports better genomic epidemiology and mitigation of spread of this pathogen.\n\nThe spreading of the novel corona virus, SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the respiratory illness, COVID-19, starting from December 2019 has become a huge concern in .

As sample's viral load decreases, however, gradual increase of the entire coverage bias was observed with their protocol. Although such phenomenon is normally expected in multiplexed PCR for low-copy templates, we observed that coverages for the two particular PCR amplicons, 18 and 76, which correspond to the genomic regions coding for the nsp3 in ORF1a and S protein, respectively, decays far more rapidly than other targets. In our experience so far, low to absolute-zero depth for those two amplicons tends to be most frequent bottle neck for completion of all targeted genomic regions from samples with middle to low viral load (Ct > 27). This low coverage issue at the amplicons 18 and 76 are also seen in data published from other groups (e.g. https://cadde.s3.climb.ac.uk/covid-19/BR1.sorted.bam).\n\nIn ARTIC primes set, the PCR amplicons, 18 and 76, are amplified by the primer pairs nCoV-2019_18_LEFT and nCoV-2019_RIGHT and nCoV-2019_76_LEFT and nCoV-2019_RIGHT, respectively, which are included in the same multiplexed reaction \"pool_2\". We noticed that two of those primers, nCoV-2019_18_LEFT and nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT were perfectly complement to each other by their 10-nt sequence at the 3'-end (Fig 1) . From this .

Indeed, we observed many NGS reads derived from the predicted dimer in raw FASTQ data (data not shown).\n\nThen, we replaced one of those 'unlucky' primer pair, nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT, in the pool_2 to a newly designed nCoV-2019_76_RIGHTv2 (Table 1 ) which locates at 48-nt downstream to nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT. in read depths at the regions covered by the amplicons 18 and 76 (Fig 2A and Fig S1, highlighted by green strips). There was no notable adverse effect observed in other PCR products by this replacement of a primer.

Given this observation, we detected additional six primer dimers (Fig 3) from raw NGS read data. The primers involved in these dimers were all included in the pool 1. Interestingly, the eight amplicons related to those primers (7, 9, 15, 21, 29, 45 , 73 and 89) consistently showed relative low depth (Fig 2A and Fig 2A) is shown in Fig 2B. Although using 35 PCR cycles resulted in better balanced yield of PCR product among samples with various viral loads compared to that with 30 cycles (Fig 4) , which eases multiplexing in NGS library construction, this increase in number of PCR cycles enlarged coverage bias overall regardless when original or new primer sets was used (Fig 2AB and Fig S1) . Nevertheless, improvement of coverages in the eight amplicons were seen with modified primer set ( Fig 2B and Fig S1, highlighted by red strips). . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

This modification entangled interference among batch of primers which involved in as many as eight PCR targets. With this modified primer set, one could recover more genomic region particularly from samples with low viral loads (>30) with smaller sequencing effort.\n\nThe result of these experiments clearly indicates that primer dimer formation is one critical cause of coverage bias in ARTIC protocol. Importantly, some of those problems can be fixed easily by observing primer dimers in raw NGS sequence reads and replacing them with alternatives as shown in this study.\n\nRNA extracted from clinical specimens (pharyngeal swabs) are reverse transcribed as The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.985150 doi: bioRxiv preprint described in protocol published by ARTIC Network (Quick, 2020) but scaled downed to 1/4.\n\nThe Ct values in clinical qPCR test for those samples ranged from 25 to 30. The cDNA was diluted to 10-fold by H2O, and 1 \u03bcl of the diluted cDNA was used for 10 \u03bcl reaction Q5 Hot START DNA Polymerase (NEB) (2 \u03bcl of 5x buffer, 0.8 \u03bcl of 2.5 mM dNTPs, 0.1 \u03bcl of polymerase and 0.29 \u03bcl of 50 \u03bcM primer mix volumed-up by milli-Q water). It should be noted that this amount of cDNA template per PCR reaction was 4-fold less than that in our usual protocol because we were intended to save those clinical samples. The thermal program was identical to the original ARTIC protocol, and the numbers of CPR cycles were 30 for experiment in Fig 2 and 35 for experiment in Fig 4. The PCR products in pool_1 and pool_2 reactions for same clinical samples were combined and purified by 1x concentration of AmpureXP. The purified PCR product was subjected to illumina library prep using QIAseq FX library kit (Qiagen) in 1/4 scale and using 6 min fragmentation time. After the ligation of barcoded adaptor, libraries were heated to 65 \u00baC for 20 min to inactivate ligase, and then, all libraries were pooled in a 1.5 ml tube without balancing DNA concentrations. The pooled library was first purified by AmpureXP at x0.8 concentration, and then again at x1.2 concentration. The purified library was sequenced for 151 cycles at both paired-ends in Illumina iSeq100 along with other samples which were not involved in this study.\n\nObtained reads were mapped to the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 MN908947.3 (Wu et al., 2020) by using bwa mem (Li and Durbin, 2009 ). To estimate the coverage of each PCR products, we counted depth of genomic parts only specific to each PCR product (Fig 4) using samtools depth function (Li and Handsaker et al., 2009) with '-a' option. The depth counts were summarized and visualized using the python3.6 and matplotlib library (Hunter 2007 ).\n\nFig S1 Depth plots on the SARS-CoV2 genome for mapped NGS reads obtained from ARTIC protocol for all eight clinical samples. Both results with the original or alternative pool_2 primer set or with the original or alternative pool_1 and pool_2 primer sets are shown. It should be noted that the experiment was conducted for 4-fold diluted cDNA sample than our usual protocol. The green and red vertical strips highlight regions of amplicons potentially affected by dimer formation among primers in pool_1 or pool_2, respectively."}
