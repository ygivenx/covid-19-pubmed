{"title": "A Systematic Review of therapeutic agents for the treatment of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)", "body": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012 and since then the disease has attracted an increasing international interest to resolve issues related to the epidemiology, clinical features, and therapy. This interest is further enhanced by the fact that MERS-CoV infection resulted in 2428 cases in 27 countries around the world as of June 23, 2019 [1] and most of the cases are linked to the Middle East [2] . So far there have been three patterns of the transmission of MERS-CoV virus mainly: sporadic cases [3] , intra-familial transmissions [4] [5] [6] and healthcare-associated transmission [3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . The disease carries a high case fatality rate of 34.5% [1] and so far there has been no proven effective therapy and no approved therapies for MERS-CoV infection by international or national societies. Few therapeutic agents were reported in the literature but all were based on retrospective analysis. In this study, we review available literature on the current therapeutic options for the disease including in vitro, animal studies, and studies in human. #1: \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus\" OR \"MERS virus\" OR \"MERS Viruses\" OR \"MERS-CoV\" OR \"Novel Coronavirus\" AND #2: \"Drug effect\" OR \"Drug Therapy\" OR \"Combination drug therapy\" OR \"Drug Ther*\" OR \"Combination drug ther*\"\n\nIn addition, we reviewed the references of retrieved articles in order to identify additional studies or reports not retrieved by the initial search. The included studies were arranged as: in vitro studies, animal studies and human studies. We included studies conducted in the vitro, animal, or humans that measured the impact of drug therapy against MERS-CoV. We excluded studies that examined the impact of drug therapy against Coronaviruses other than MERS-CoV, any study that focused on drug synthesis and extractions, review articles, studies of supplemental therapy, and articles focused on the mechanism of action of medications.\n\nInitial search identified 62 articles: 52 articles were from Medline, 6 articles from Embase, and 4 articles from Science Direct. Of those, 32 studies were excluded: review studies (n = 16), drug synthesis and extraction (n = 3), supplemental therapy (n = 1), drug therapy in Coronavirus in general (n = 4), and site of action of different drugs modalities (n = 8). Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, only 30 articles were included in the final review: 13 studies were conducted in vitro, 8 studies were done in animal models, 8 studies were done in humans, and one study included both in vitro and animal model (Fig. 1 ).\n\nThere were many in vitro studies evaluating various agents against MERS-CoV such as: interferon (INF), ribavirin, and HIV protease inhibitors (nelfinavir, ritonavir and lopinavir) as summarized in Table 1 .\n\nIn vitro studies showed that IFN-\u03b2 has a lower 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) for MERS-CoV compared with IFN-a2b [28] . In addition, IFN-\u03b2 has a superior anti-MERS-CoV activity in the magnitude of 16-, 41-, 83-and 117-fold higher compared to IFN-\u03b12b, IFN-\u03b3, IFNuniversal type 1 and IFN-\u03b12a, respectively [28] . Pegylated Interferon-\u03b1 (PEG-IFN-\u03b1) inhibited the effect of MERS-CoV at a dose of 1 ng/ml with complete inhibition of cytopathic effect (CPE) at doses of 3-1000 ng/ml in MERS-CoV infected Vero cells [29] .\n\nRibavirin, a nucleoside analog requiring activation by host kinases to a nucleotide, required high in vitro doses to inhibit MERS-CoV replications and these doses are too high to be achieved in vivo [30, 31] . The combination of interferon-alfa 2b (INF-\u03b12b) and ribavirin in Vero cells resulted in a an 8-fold reduction of the IFN-\u03b12b dose and a 16-fold reduction in ribavirin dose [30] .\n\nThe HIV protease inhibitors, Nelfinavir and lopinavir, were thoughts to inhibit MERS-CoV based on results from SARS [32] . Nelfinavir mesylate hydrate and lopinavir showed suboptimal 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) in the initial CPE inhibition assay and were not evaluated further [31] . In another study, the mean EC 50 of lopinavir using Vero E6 and Huh7 cells was 8.0 \u03bcM [33] .\n\nMERS-CoV requires fusion to the host cells to replicate, thus MERS-CoV fusion inhibitors such as camostat and the Heptad Repeat 2 Peptide (HR2P) were evaluated in vitro [34, 35] . Camostat inhibited viral entry into human bronchial submucosal gland-derived Calu-3 cells but not immature lung tissue [34] . HR2P was shown to inhibit MERS-CoV replication and the spike protein-mediated cell-cell fusion [35] . Camostat was effective in reducing viral entry by 15-folds in the Vero-TMPRSS2 cells infected with MERS-CoV [36] .\n\nNitazoxanide, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, and teicoplanin, an inhibitor of Cathepsin L in the Late Endosome/Lysosome cycle and a blocker of the entry of MERS-CoV, showed inhibitory effects of MERS-CoV in vitro [37, 38] . The ability of recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD-Fd) to inhibit MERS-CoV has been studied in DPP-4 expressing Huh-7 infected cells. The 50% inhibition dose (ID 50 ) for RBD-Fd was 1.5 \u03bcg/ml compared with no inhibitory activity in untreated cells even at highest dose [39] .\n\nCyclosporin affects the function of many cyclophilins that act as chaperones and facilitate protein folding [29, 40] . In vitro, cyclosporine inhibited MERS-CoV replication [29, 40] . Three days post infection, cytopathic effects (CPE) of MERS-CoV was inhibited by Cyclosporine Vero cells and mock-infected Huh7 cells [29] .\n\nToremifene, Chlorpromazine, and Chloroquine were evaluated using Vero cells, human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and immature dendritic cells (MDDCs) [41] . These drugs were transferred to cells 1 h prior to infection with MERS-CoV. After 48 h, viral replication was inhibited by Toremifene with 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 12.9 \u03bcM) but the MDMs dose was too low to have a calculated EC50. Chlorpromazine inhibited MERS-CoV in Vero cells with an EC50 of 9.5 \u03bcM and no cytotoxicity. In MDMs cells, the EC50 was 13.58 \u03bcM with high 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC 50 ) of 25.64 \u03bcM. Chloroquine showed no antiviral activity in the MDMs. Toremifene reduced virus by 1-1.5 log10 at a dose more than 20 \u03bcM. Chlorpromazine reduced MERS-CoV by 2 log10 and had a narrow therapeutic window and a high toxicity [41] . Chloroquine, Chloropromazine, and loperamide were tested on Huh7 cells [43] . The cells were treated 1-h prior to infection. Antiviral activity of chloroquine was dose-dependent. Chlorpomazine showed activity against MERS-CoV with EC50 of 4.9 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcM and CC50 of 21.3 \u00b1 1.0 \u03bcM. Loperamide, an antidiarrheal drug, inhibited MERS-CoV and induced CPE. Two kinase signaling (ABL1) pathway inhibitors (Imatinib mesylate and Dasatinib) were active against MERS-CoV in vitro [42] . In Vero E6 and MRC5 cells imatinib had a dose dependent killing [43] .\n\nSaracatinib has a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against different strain of MERS-CoV. After 72 h of infection of Huh-7 cells, Saracatinib exhibited an EC50 of 2.9 \u03bcM and CC50 of more than 50 \u03bcM [44] . Whereas, gemcitabine was shown to be effective against MERS-CoV infected Huh-7 cells with an EC50 of 1.2 \u03bcM and a complete viral depletion at a dose of \u22651 \u03bcM [44] . Inhibitory effect of resveratrol against MERS-CoV was tested using infected Vero E6 cells. After 48 h, cell death was significantly reduced in the treatment group with resveratrol. The study showed that resveratrol inhibited MERS-CoV after entry in the cells and when resveratrol was added at same time of MERS-CoV, there was no difference in cell proliferations and viral titers compared with cells treated after infections [45] .\n\nThe antiviral activity of GS-441524 and its pro-drug GS-5734 (Remdesivir) were tested on MERS-CoV infected human airway epithelial cell (HAE) [46] . GS-441524 has a mean EC50 of 0.86 \u03bcM and GS-5734 has a mean EC50 of 0.074 \u03bcM with more reduction in viral titer if the drug was added 24-72 h post infection [46] .\n\nUtilizing HAE cells infected with MERS-CoV, there was a significant reduction in viral replication and dsRNA level when cells were treated with K22 compound [47] . A novel peptide (P9) showed an in vitro activity against MERS-CoV at an IC50 of 5 \u03bcg/ml and more than 95% infection reduction at concentration higher than 25 \u03bcg/ml [48] . The two neurotransmitter antagonists (Chlorpromazine hydrochloride and triflupromazine hydrochloride) inhibit MERS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells [42] . The DNA synthesis and repair inhibitor, Gemcitabine Hydrochloride, and an Estrogen receptor I antagonist, Toremifene citrate, had antiviral activity against MERS-CoV [42] . An Estrogen receptor I antagonist, Toremifene citrate, had activity against MERS-CoV [42] . In addition, MERS-CoV is inactivated by amotosalen and ultraviolet light in fresh frozen plasma [49] .\n\nMonoclonal antibodies against MERS-CoV had been tested in animal models of MERS-CoV infection ( Table 2 ). The monoclonal antibodies, 3B11-N and 4E10-N, were compared with no treatment in Rhesus Monkey model [50] . Antibodies, 3B11-N, were administered as a prophylaxis one-day prior to animal inoculation and showed significant reduction in lung disease radiographically. However, there was no significant difference when 3B11-N and 4E10-N were compared in term of lung pathology (P = 0.1122) [50] .\n\nInterferon alfa-2a in conjunction with ribavirin were tested in rhesus macaques model of MERS-CoV infection. The animals were randomly assigned to either treatment or control groups and therapy was started 8 h post-infection. Necropsy showed a normal appearance of the lung in the treatment group compared with the control group. Virus replication was significantly reduced in the lung of treated animal. Serum interferon alfa was 37 times the level in untreated group by day 2. In addition, the treated group showed reduced systemic and local levels of pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukin-2, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, interleukin-2 receptor antagonist, interleukin-6, interleukin-15, and interferon-gamma [51] .\n\nAnother study was conducted utilizing 12 healthy common marmosets inoculated with MERS-Cov and then assigned to four groups (control group; Mycophenolate mofetil intraperitoneally 8 h after inoculation; Lopinavir with Ritonavir at 6, 30, and 54 h after inoculation; or Interferon-Beta-1b subcutaneous at 8-and 56-h post inoculation) [52] . Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Interferon-beta-1b treated groups had better clinical scores, less weight reduction, less pulmonary infiltrate, and lower viral load than the untreated group. The Mycophenolate group had a higher viral load with severe disease compared with the control group. The fatality rate was higher in untreated, and Mycophenolate treated groups (67%) than Lopinavir/Ritonavir treated and Interferon-Beta-1 b treated groups (0-33%) after 36 h of inoculation [52] .\n\nThe human dipeptyl peptidase-4 (hDPP4) is a receptor for cell binding and entry of MERS-CoV. A transgenic mouse model with hDPP4 was utilized to test the effects of humanized mAb (hMS-1). In the model, a single dose of hMS-1 protected the transgenic mouse from MERS-CoV infection and all control mice died ten days post-infection [53] .\n\nThe Humanized antibodies mAb 4C2h are mouse-derived neutralizing spike receptor-binding domain of MERS-CoV (MERS-RBD) that were further humanized [54] . A single intravenous dose was injected one day pre and post MERS-CoV inoculation and showed that h-mAb-4C2h significantly decreased viral titer in the lungs in the mouse model (p < 0.05) [54] .\n\nAnother study was done on adenoviruses expressing hDPP4 in mouse lungs (Ad5-hDPP4-Transduced mice) utilizing intranasal peptide derived from the heptad repeat (HR) 2 domain in S2 subunit known as HR2P analogue (HR2P-M2) [55] . The animals were either given intranasal HR2P-M2 6 h before infections or a control group with no treatment. The treated group showed decreased in the viral titer compared with the control group. The combination of HR2P-M2 with interferon \u03b2 showed further reduction of infection [55] .\n\nThe human-Fc-fused version of neutralizing nanobody (NbMS10-Fc) was tested using hDPP-4 transgenic mice model of MERS-CoV infection. The mice were injected with a single dose NbMS10-FC or Trastuzumab (control group) before a lethal dose of MESR-CoV. The treatment group had a 100% survival rate compared with 0% survival rate in the control group [56] .\n\nThe impact of a trans-chromosomic (Tc) bovine, fully human polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were tested on Ad5-hDPP4-transduced mice five days after transduction and 12 h before inoculated MERS-CoV. Animals received either intraperitoneal SAB-301 or control or Tc hIgG group. Viral load was lower in mice treated with SAB-301 at day 1 and 2 post-infection [57] .\n\nA recombinant trimeric receptor-binding protein (RBD-Fd) was tested on hDPP4 transgenic mice infected with MERS-CoV. The animals received RBD-Fd subcutaneously and were boosted at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months. RBD-Fd induced S1-specific IgG antibodies against MERS-CoV and was maintained for at least 6 months. The survival rate in RBD-Fd immunized mice was 83% [39] .\n\nA summary of the use of different therapeutic agents in human is shown in Table 3 . The first use of antiviral agents to treat MERS-CoV infection was observed in 5 patients in 2013 in Saudi Arabia [58] . All patients received ribavirin orally and subcutaneous interferon alfa-2b. Unfortunately, all patients died at 1-2 months due to respiratory and multi-organ failure and four patients experienced adverse drug reaction such as thrombocytopenia, anemia and pancreatitis [58] .\n\nIn 2015, two patients with MERS-Cov infection in Kuwait were treated with pegylated interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously and oral ribavirin [59] . One patient was discharged home after 42 days of starting antiviral therapy and ribavirin was stopped after one week of therapy due to anemia. The second patient recovered from MERS-CoV and he subsequently died two months later with multidrug-resistant organism [59] .\n\nA large retrospective cohort study included 44 adult patients. Of those patients, 24 patients (control group) did not receive antiviral treatment, and 20 patients received subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a and oral ribavirin [60] per previously developed protocol [61] . The survival rate after 14 days from the date of diagnosis was statistically higher in the treatment group compared with the control group (70% versus 29%; P = 0.004). However, the survival rate did not differ in the two groups at 28 days (30% versus 17%; P = 0.054) [60] . In 2014, a retrospective cohort study was conducted on 24 confirmed MERS cases in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and were started on day one of MERS-CoV confirmation [62] . Of those patients, 13 received interferon \u03b1-2a subcutaneous per week and 11 patients received interferon \u03b2-1a subcutaneous three times weekly. Both groups also received ribavirin orally. The case fatality rate was 85% in INF-\u03b1-2a versus 64% in INF-\u03b2-1a (p = 0.24). The fatality rate in patients using INF with positive MERS-CoV RT-PCR was 90% versus 44% in those with negative MERS-CoV RT-PCR test [62] .\n\nIn 2015, pegylated interferon-\u03b1-2b and ribavirin was given to two confirmed cases in Riyadh. One patient was treated PEG-INF-\u03b1-2b and ribavirin and start to improve day 6 and had complete recovery at day 18. The second case was not a confirmed case and was started on these medication as a prophylaxis. On the fourth day, the patient started to improve and was discharged home after two weeks [63] . The combination therapy was also used in other case reports (Table 3) , [64, 65] .\n\nIn a large cohort study of 51 patients, various combinations of interferon and ribavirin were used with different outcomes (Table 3 ) [66] . Another small study utilized ribavirin and interferon-alfa 2b in three patients who received therapy within 1-2 days of admission and were compared to three other patients who received therapy 12-19 days after admission [67] . The first group survived and the latter group died [67] . The use of interferon beta, interferon alpha, and ribavirin was associated with survival rates of 78.3%, 75%, and 68.4%, respectively [66] .\n\nOral lopinavir and ritonavir were used for the treatment of a 64 years old Korean male with confirmed MERS-CoV infection. These medications were started on the fourth day of admission and the patient achieved full recovery after nine days of treatment [63] . One patient was treated with pegylated interferon, ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir and viremia was detected for two days following therapy with triple therapy [64] . In a case series, eight patients received mycophenolate mofetil and all survived [66] .\n\nA phase 1 randomized placebo-controlled study utilized a fully human polyclonal IgG antibody (SAB-301) and evaluated the safety and tolerability of this agent in 28 adults compared with 10 adults who received placebo [68] . The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02788188. SAB-301 was well tolerated and the most reported adverse events were headache, elevated creatinine kinase, and albuminuria [68] . \n\nSince the emergence of MERS-CoV infection there was a large interest in the development of an effective therapy for this disease. In this review, we summarized the available literature on possible therapeutic options including in vitro, animal and human studies. In vitro studies showed superiority of IFN-\u03b2 compared to IFN-\u03b12b, IFN-\u03b3, IFN-universal type 1 and IFN-\u03b12a [28] and PEG-IFN-\u03b1 had excellent CPE inhibition [29] . Moreover, the combination of INF-\u03b12b and ribavirin in Vero cells showed augmentation of action and facilitates the reduction of the doses of IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin to lower concentrations suggesting possible utility in clinical use [30] . Saracatinib with Gemcitabine had no difference in cytotoxicity compared with Saracatinib alone but was less cytotoxic compared with gemcitabine alone [44] . There were many drugs that were used in vitro and showed effectiveness, however, translating the findings from these studies into clinical trial remains of particular importance especially taking into consideration availability, pharmacokinetic properties, pharmacodynamic characteristics and possible side effects [69] .\n\nAvaialble clincial experience regarding the therapy for MERS-CoV relies on limited case reports and observational case-series. The most widely used combination is ribavirin and IFN and experience comes from limited case reports and a number of observational studies. These studies are non-homogeneous in nature and thus a common conclusion could not be obtained to make firm recommendations for the use of this combination in routine clinical practice outside of prospective clinical studies [69] .\n\nThe combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta-1b was used in common marmosets [52] and was used in two patients with good outcome [63] [64] [65] . This combination is being considered in a randomized control trial in Saudi Arabia. The enrollment for the study began in November 2016 and the results are not available yet [70] . The study was registered on 27 July 2016 at ClinicalTrials.gov, with an ID: NCT02845843. And this is the only currently ongoing clinical therapeutic trial for MERS-CoV therapy.\n\nIn conclusion, despite multiple studies in humans there is no consensus on the optimal therapy for MERS-CoV. Randomized clinical trials are needed and potential therapies should be evaluated only in such clinical trials. Thus, any such therapy should be used in conjunction with clinical trials. An interesting strategy is repurposing old drugs against MERS-CoV and this deserves further consideration and use in clinical setting.\n\nNone.\n\nNone."}
