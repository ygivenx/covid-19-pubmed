Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); endoglycosidase H (endo H) from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); N-hexanoylsphingosine (C6Cer), lipid standards, and PDMP were from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA); [3H]palmitate (50 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont-NEN (Wilmington, DE); Pro-Mix (>1,000 mCi/mmol [35S]methionine) was from Amersham Intl. (Arlington Heights, IL); DME, tissue culture\u2013grade trypsin, and penicillin-streptomycin were from GIBCO BRL (Gaithersburg, MD); all other reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).\n\nAntibodies were obtained as follows: monoclonal anti-Bip, Stressgen (Victoria, BC, Canada); monoclonal anti-giantin and monoclonal anti-ERGIC-53, Hans-Peter Hauri (Basel, Switzerland); polyclonal anti\u2013\u03b2-COP, Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD); polyclonal \u03b1-mannosidase II, Marilyn Farquhar (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA) and Kelley Moreman (University of Georgia, Athens, GA); polyclonal antibodies to IBV M and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were prepared as described (Machamer and Rose, 1987; Weisz et al., 1993, respectively); Texas red\u2013 and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies, Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA).\n\nTissue culture cells were grown in DME supplemented with 5% (BHK-21) or 10% (Vero) FCS. Cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.\n\nPulse\u2013chase experiments were performed as previously described (Rosenwald et al., 1992; Weisz et al., 1993). Briefly, cells were plated in 35-mm dishes the night before the experiment to be 90% confluent the next day. VSV (San Juan strain, Indiana serotype) was adsorbed for 30 min in 0.5 ml of serum-free DME. At 4 h after infection, the cells were starved for methionine for 15 min. Cells were then pulsed for 5 min with 50 \u03bcCi 35S-Pro-mix and chased for the indicated amount of time in the presence or absence of the indicated drugs. The isopropanol carrier alone had no effect on the rate of transport of VSV G protein. After the chase, cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed in detergent. VSV G protein was then immunoprecipitated, treated with endo H as described (Rosenwald et al., 1992), separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography. Endo H\u2013sensitive and -resistant forms of the VSV G protein were quantitated by densitometry.\n\nThese experiments were performed as previously described (Swift and Machamer, 1991). Briefly, cells were infected for 30 min with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding IBV M, and the indicated treatments were begun 4 h after infection. For experiments using exogenous ceramides, the soluble short-chain analogues of ceramide were added to cells as a complex with 0.34 mg/ml defatted BSA as described (Pagano and Martin, 1988). After treatment, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with the appropriate antibody. Images were acquired using a microscope (Axioskop; Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with epifluorescence and a CCD camera (Photometrics Sensys, Tucson, AZ) using IP Lab software (Signal Analytics Corp., Vienna, VA). All images shown are the raw data collected at 1\u00d71 binning with a gain of 1.\n\nCells were seeded onto 6-cm plastic dishes 2 d before the experiment so that they were 90% confluent the day of the experiment. Cells were incubated in DME supplemented with 50 \u03bcg/ml cycloheximide, and half of the dishes were also incubated with 5 mM \u03b2CA. 1 h later, fresh medium containing cycloheximide and [3H]palmitate (100 \u03bcCi/ dish) was added, along with either 1% isopropanol (control and \u03b2CA) or 100 \u03bcM PDMP and 5 mM \u03b2CA if indicated. 1 h later, cells were trypsinized and washed off the plate in 0.8 ml cold PBS. To normalize lipid levels, 50 \u03bcl were removed for a protein assay by the method of Bradford (1976). Lipids were then extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (1959). Labeled samples were doped with 10 \u03bcg cold ceramide to allow for visualization. Samples were run on 10 \u00d7 10 cm high performance thin-layer chromatography plates with a mobile phase of chloroform/glacial acetic acid (9:1; Abe et al., 1992). Plates were sprayed with water to visualize the ceramide bands that were scraped and counted after the addition of scintillation fluid. Alternatively, plates were dipped in 10% 4,5-diphenyloxazole in chloroform for visualization by fluorography (Henderson and Tocher, 1992).\n\nTo test whether ongoing sphingolipid synthesis was necessary for the correct localization of the IBV M protein, we used three inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis: \u03b2-chloroalanine (\u03b2CA; Medlock and Merrill, 1988), fumonisin B1 (FB1; Wang et al., 1991), and PDMP (Vunnam and Radin, 1980; Inokuchi and Radin, 1987). The biosynthetic pathway for sphingolipids with the sites of inhibition of these drugs is shown in Fig. 1. Both \u03b2CA (5 mM) and FB1 (100 \u03bcM) inhibited the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors into sphingolipids in BHK-21 cells by >90% (data not shown). Consistent with previous results (Rosenwald et al., 1992), we found that PDMP (100 \u03bcM) inhibited GlcCer synthesis by \u223c90% and SM synthesis by \u223c50% in BHK-21 cells (data not shown). \n\nTo express the IBV M protein, BHK-21 cells were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding IBV M (Machamer and Rose, 1987). 4 h after infection the cells were treated with cycloheximide for 1 h to chase newly synthesized M protein out of the ER. Sphingolipid synthesis inhibitors were then added and the cells incubated for another 1 h before processing for immunofluorescence (Fig. 2). In control cells, IBV M exhibited a tight, juxtanuclear staining pattern that colocalized with Golgi markers. The Golgi localization pattern of IBV M was unchanged by treatment with either \u03b2CA or FB1, suggesting that ongoing sphingolipid synthesis is not required for proper localization of IBV M. In contrast, PDMP-treated cells showed a marked change in the staining pattern of the IBV M protein after 1 h. The localization of IBV M in the presence of PDMP changed from Golgi to ER based on the absence of strong juxtanuclear staining and the presence of nuclear rim staining and a tubulo-reticular staining pattern that colocalized with ER markers. Treatment of infected cells with lower concentrations of PDMP had no effect on IBV M localization and very little effect on SM synthesis (data not shown). We next tested the kinetics of PDMP-induced mislocalization of IBV M. Cells were infected as before and treated for 1 h with cycloheximide. Then cells were treated with PDMP for varying lengths of time up to 1 h (Fig. 3). Redistribution was first observed at 15 min and became maximal at 60 min. This redistribution was rapidly reversible, such that 30 min after washing out PDMP, IBV M had moved back to the Golgi region. \n\nWe next asked if PDMP mislocalized other Golgi markers. Cells were infected and treated as described above and then stained with antibodies to two integral membrane proteins of the Golgi stack, giantin (Linstedt and Hauri, 1993) and mannosidase II (Man II; Moremen and Robbins, 1991; Velasco et al., 1993). Treatment of cells with 100 \u03bcM PDMP for 1 h had no effect on the localization of either protein (Fig. 4), suggesting that the morphology of the Golgi was not greatly altered. We also examined the localization of \u03b2-COP, a peripheral membrane protein of the stack and CGN involved in vesicular traffic (Oprins et al., 1993). As seen in Fig. 4, the distribution of \u03b2-COP appeared unaffected in treated cells. \n\nWe then looked at a protein which cycles through the cis-Golgi. As we did not have access to antibodies that crossreact with known markers in BHK-21 cells, we examined ERGIC-53 in Vero cells. IBV M localizes to the CGN in these cells and is also redistributed to the ER by PDMP (data not shown). ERGIC-53 is an IC protein that cycles between the ER, IC, and Golgi stack (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990; Schindler et al., 1993). Vero cells were treated with cycloheximide for 1 h and then with or without 100 \u03bcM PDMP for an additional hour before being fixed and prepared for immunofluorescence (Fig. 5). Similar to the effects on IBV M, PDMP treatment shifted the steady-state distribution of ERGIC-53 to the ER. In addition, neither \u03b2CA nor FB1 had any effect on the localization of ERGIC-53 (data not shown). \n\nThe above immunofluorescence results suggested that PDMP might generally alter the distribution of proteins that have a dynamic localization mechanism. Interestingly, it has been shown that PDMP slows the rate of both anterograde vesicular traffic (Rosenwald et al., 1992) and endocytosis (Chen et al., 1995) in CHO cells. We tested whether PDMP also slowed anterograde traffic in BHK-21 cells. We used a plasma membrane protein, the well-characterized G protein from VSV. A pulse\u2013chase experiment was performed either in the presence or absence of PDMP, \u03b2CA, or FB1. The rate of accumulation of endo H\u2013resistant VSV G was used as an assay for the rate of arrival at the medial-Golgi. Neither \u03b2CA nor FB1 had any effect on the rate of anterograde traffic. However, PDMP increased the half-time for transport by \u223c2.5-fold from 18 to 44 min (Fig. 6). \n\nFig. 6 shows that neither \u03b2CA nor FB1 had any effect on the transit rate of VSV G, suggesting that the decreased rate with PDMP was not due to a block in the ongoing synthesis of sphingolipids. PDMP inhibits the conversion of ceramide into glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin. One possible explanation for the effects observed with PDMP was an accumulation of the precursor ceramide. \u03b2CA and FB1 act upstream of PDMP (Fig. 1), and the intermediates in sphingolipid synthesis between these steps and ceramide production are thought to be short lived (Merrill and Wang, 1986; Medlock and Merril, 1988). To ask if ceramide accumulation might mediate the PDMP-induced slowing of anterograde traffic, cells were treated with \u03b2CA or FB1 before PDMP. We performed a pulse\u2013chase labeling experiment with cells pretreated with either \u03b2CA or FB1 for 1 h before being chased in the presence or absence of \u03b2CA or FB1 and PDMP (Fig. 6). Pretreatment with the earlier inhibitors reduced the PDMP-induced slowing of anterograde traffic by about half, suggesting that accumulation of newly synthesized ceramide at least partially mediates this effect.\n\nTo test whether ceramide was likely to mediate the PDMP-induced mislocalization of IBV M, indirect immunofluorescence was performed as above with cells pretreated with either \u03b2CA or FB1 for 1 h before the addition of PDMP. To simplify the quantification, the localization of IBV M was classified into one of three staining patterns. Class 1 was the most commonly seen pattern in untreated cells, i.e., tight juxta-nuclear staining that colocalized with Golgi markers. Class 3 was the most commonly seen pattern in PDMP-treated cells, i.e., diffuse staining with prominent nuclear envelope staining that colocalized with ER markers. Class 2 was intermediate between the class 1 and class 3. Whether this pattern represents an overlap of ER and Golgi staining patterns or an increase in IC staining is not clear. For these experiments, coded samples were quantified by counting at least 100 cells for each sample. The experiment was performed five times, with one representative experiment shown (Fig. 7). Interestingly, when cells were quantified in this way, we observed that both \u03b2CA and FB1 caused a slight shift from class 1 to class 2. The significance of this observation is not clear. PDMP dramatically shifted the distribution of IBV M from mainly class 1 in the control cells to mainly class 3. Pretreatment with either \u03b2CA or FB1 significantly reduced this shift in the staining pattern of IBV M, suggesting that accumulation of newly synthesized ceramide mediates the effects of PDMP on localization of IBV M. \n\nThe pretreatment experiments suggested that increased levels of ceramide mediate the PDMP-induced effects on IBV M localization. Ceramide can act as a second messenger (for review see Hannun, 1994) and has been suggested to be the mediator of some of the effects of PDMP in CHO cells (Rosenwald and Pagano, 1993). Furthermore, in several systems, cellular levels of ceramide increased upon treatment with PDMP or one of its more soluble analogues (for example see Rani et al., 1995; Posse de Chaves et al., 1997). We measured the levels of ceramide after various treatments by pulse\u2013labeling with [3H]palmitate. After labeling and treatment, cellular lipids were extracted and run on chromatography plates. The appropriate spots corresponding to ceramide were scraped and counted. Consistent with our hypothesis, Fig. 8\nA shows that PDMP treatment increased the levels of ceramide 2.5-fold over control levels. Pretreatment with \u03b2CA reduced PDMP- induced ceramide accumulation to roughly half of control levels, but this level was still threefold higher than cells treated with \u03b2CA alone. Fig. 8\nB is a representative fluorograph showing the ceramide region that was quantified in Fig. 8\nA. Interestingly, we noticed the appearance of a lower migrating ceramide band in PDMP-treated cells. \n\nThe pretreatment experiments as well as lipid analysis implicated ceramide as the mediator of PDMP effects. If this were true, addition of a soluble, short-chain analogue of ceramide might mimic the effects of PDMP. Indeed, one such cell-permeable analogue of ceramide, N-hexanoylsphingosine (C6Cer), reproduces the effects of PDMP on anterograde traffic of VSV G in CHO cells (Rosenwald and Pagano, 1993). We first asked whether C6Cer slowed anterograde traffic in BHK-21 cells. A pulse\u2013chase labeling experiment with VSV-infected cells was performed, with cells chased in the absence or presence of 25 \u03bcM C6Cer. C6Cer slowed the rate of anterograde traffic in BHK-21 cells \u223c2.5-fold (data not shown). We went on to use C6Cer in our indirect immunofluorescence assay. As expected, C6Cer had no effect on the localization of either Man II or \u03b2-COP (Fig. 9). However, contrary to our expectation, C6Cer did not alter the localization of either IBV M or ERGIC-53. This suggests that exogenously added C6Cer and ceramide generated by treatment with PDMP do not have the same effects. Two other soluble analogues of ceramide, C2Cer and C8Cer, were also tested and found to have no effect on the localization of IBV M (data not shown). \n\nThere are two possible mechanisms to maintain the steady-state localization of proteins to specific sites along the secretory pathway: (a) retention in the particular compartment, and (b) retrieval from other compartments (Machamer, 1993; Nilsson and Warren, 1994). The redistribution of IBV M induced by PDMP was surprising, as we expected that if we disrupted its localization, it would move with \u201cbulk flow\u201d to the plasma membrane. That IBV M was redistributed to the ER suggests that it has specific targeting information for retrieval to the ER. Coupled with earlier work in our laboratory on the role of oligomerization of IBV M chimeras in CGN targeting (Weisz et al., 1993), our findings suggest that IBV M maintains its steady-state distribution by both retention and retrieval (Fig. 10\nA). We propose two models to explain the redistribution of IBV M protein induced by PDMP. The simplest model (Fig. 10\nB, left arrow) is that the M protein normally cycles between the ER and the Golgi at a significant rate, as has been shown for ERGIC-53 (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990; Schindler et al., 1993). The slowing of anterograde traffic would cause the protein to shift its steady-state distribution to the ER, assuming that retrograde traffic is unaffected or perhaps increased by PDMP. A second possibility is that PDMP disrupts retention of the M protein, which then cycles back to the ER by normal retrieval mechanisms (Fig. 10\nB, right arrow). These two models are not mutually exclusive, and both effects of PDMP may be necessary to redistribute IBV M to the extent observed. \n\nImplicit in both models is the idea that IBV M contains retrieval information. PDMP-induced ER redistribution was also observed for ERGIC-53, a dilysine-containing IC marker known to cycle through the ER (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990; Schindler et al., 1993). Double-label immunoelectron microscopy in HeLa cells showed that the distribution of ERGIC-53 and IBV M overlapped significantly, though not completely (Sodeik et al., 1993). This suggests that IBV M may in part use the same, as yet unknown, cellular machinery used by IC proteins to maintain its steady- state localization. Using deletion mutants and chimeric molecules, dissection of IBV M retention and retrieval information should be possible using PDMP as a tool. The pathway followed by IBV M during retrieval will also be important to decipher. Experiments in nontreated cells suggest that the protein may move through later Golgi compartments even though its steady-state distribution is the CGN, because its oligosaccharides are slowly processed (Machamer et al., 1990).\n\nInterestingly, we did not observe redistribution of two Golgi stack markers (Man II and giantin) to the ER with PDMP treatment. Golgi membrane proteins were recently suggested to be highly mobile (Cole et al., 1996b\n) and to cycle through the ER (Cole et al., 1996a\n). Our results with PDMP suggest that cycling of these proteins does not occur during the time scale of our experiments, and/or that its predominant effect on IBV M is a loss of retention.\n\nInterestingly, it has been shown that myriocin, an inhibitor of sphingolipid synthesis thought to inhibit the same step as \u03b2CA, reduces the rate of transport of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein but not other proteins out of the ER in yeast (Horvath et al., 1994). It would be interesting to test whether inhibition of ceramide synthesis in mammalian cells also slows the rate of transport of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins in mammalian cells. However, neither \u03b2CA nor FB1 had an effect on the rate of anterograde traffic of VSV G or the localization of IC, CGN, or Golgi stack proteins. When we quantified the effects of these two inhibitors on the immunofluorescence staining pattern of IBV M, we did detect a slight shift toward the intermediate staining pattern (Fig. 7). Whether this represents an altered distribution pattern or subtle effects on Golgi structure caused by these inhibitors is unclear. From these results we conclude that ongoing sphingolipid synthesis is not required for either normal rates of anterograde traffic or proper localization of Golgi proteins. However, the glucosylceramide analogue PDMP, at a concentration that inhibits both GlcCer and SM synthases, causes a redistribution of IBV M to the ER and a slowing of anterograde traffic in BHK-21 cells. Why does PDMP have these effects while \u03b2CA and FB1 do not? It is likely that PDMP exerts its effects by causing the accumulation of ceramide. Other groups have found that the various effects of PDMP and its active analogues were concomitant with (Uemura et al., 1990; Shayman et al.; 1991; Rani et al., 1995) or actually caused by increases in ceramide concentrations (Abe et al., 1996; Posse de Chaves et al., 1997). In BHK-21 cells treated with 100 \u03bcM PDMP for 1 h we measured an increase in newly synthesized ceramide (Fig. 8\nA), showing at least a correlation between levels of newly synthesized ceramide and the effects of PDMP on protein traffic and localization. The fact that pretreatment with either \u03b2CA or FB1, both of which block the synthesis of ceramide, can ameliorate the effects of PDMP demonstrates that ceramide is at least in part the mediator of these effects. However, the effects of PDMP are not completely abolished by pretreatment, even though \u03b2CA pretreatment reduced the level of newly synthesized ceramide by 50% compared to control. One explanation is that ceramide accumulation is only one of the ways that PDMP exerts its effects. Another possibility is that ceramide is being generated by the degradation of preexisting sphingolipids, e.g., at the cell surface or in lysosomes. This ceramide cannot be made back into sphingolipids because the enzymes SM and GlcCer synthases are inhibited in the presence of PDMP. Interestingly, the fluorograph of the ceramide bands generated after the various treatments (Fig. 8\nB) shows different relative amounts of ceramide species. We suspect that these ceramides differ in acyl chain lengths (Abe et al., 1992) and that this may be an indication of different sources of ceramide, i.e., de novo synthesis or sphingolipid degradation. We are currently investigating this possibility.\n\nBased on the pretreatment results, we expected that soluble analogues of ceramide would mimic the effects of PDMP. Rosenwald and Pagano (1993) showed that like 100 \u03bcM PDMP, 25 \u03bcM C6Cer decreased the rate of transit of an itinerant protein to the medial-Golgi in CHO cells. Consistent with these results, 25 \u03bcM C6Cer also slowed anterograde traffic in BHK-21 cells. However, 25 \u03bcM C6Cer had no effect on the localization of either the M protein or ERGIC-53. Other short-chain ceramide analogues (C2- and C8-ceramide) also had no effect on IBV M localization. How does this fit with our model that ceramide mediates PDMP effects? One explanation is that the effect on protein localization is independent of the effect on anterograde traffic rates. In this case, it may be that C6Cer and endogenous ceramide have similar ability to bind and affect proteins that regulate anterograde traffic, but C6Cer is unable to bind or affect proteins that regulate protein localization. It has been shown that some short chain analogues of ceramide do not have the same effects as endogenous ceramide (e.g., Wolff et al., 1994). A second possibility is that effects of ceramide are limited to the bilayers in which its concentration increases, and the difference seen between endogenous ceramide and exogenous C6Cer is due to the different intracellular distribution of these molecules. C6Cer would be unlikely to accumulate in compartments where IBV M and ERGIC 53 reside, because it is rapidly converted to sphingolipids there (Rosenwald et al., 1992). Effects on membrane traffic might be more dramatic in compartments where C6Cer accumulates, possibly the trans-Golgi and TGN (Pagano et al., 1989). Consistent with this idea, the rate of movement of VSV G through the late Golgi (measured by sialylation) was slowed to a much greater extent by C6Cer than by PDMP (Rosenwald and Pagano, 1993).\n\nIt is not yet clear how ceramide induces the changes in anterograde traffic and protein localization. Recent studies have shown that ceramide (Hannun, 1994) and its metabolites (Hakomori, 1990) play a major role as second messengers. Preliminary experiments with both the ceramidase inhibitor N-oleoylethanolamine and exogenously added sphingosine suggest that the ceramide breakdown product sphingosine does not play a role in the localization of IBV M (Maceyka, M., and C. Machamer, unpublished observations). Ceramide activates a cytosolic protein phosphatase (Dobrowsky and Hannun, 1992; Wolff et al., 1994) that can be inhibited by okadaic acid. Preliminary experiments suggest that okadaic acid does not block the PDMP-induced changes (Maceyka, M., and C. Machamer, unpublished observations). Ceramide could be activating a protein kinase (Mathias et al., 1991), but this kinase has not been fully characterized. Another possibility is that increased ceramide within the lipid bilayer directly affects the localization of IBV M. Earlier work from our laboratory showed that the first transmembrane domain of IBV M can target chimeras to the CGN (Swift and Machamer, 1991; Machamer et al., 1993). It is possible that CGN bilayers have distinct lipid domains, and that these domains contain different sets of proteins, analogous to glycosphingolipid rafts. Segregation of membrane proteins involved in vesicular traffic, such as SNAREs, would lead to mobile and immobile domains. We hypothesize that under normal conditions, IBV M would be targeted to an immobile domain and escaped molecules would be cycled back through the ER. Elevated levels of ceramide could disrupt these immobile lipid domains, inducing IBV M to cycle. Alternatively, perhaps ceramide binds to IBV M transmembrane domains, preventing an interaction with immobile lipid domains."}
