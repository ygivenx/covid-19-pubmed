[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The pandemic traces its early beginnings to the report of a cluster of 27 unexplained pneumonia cases in late December 2019 originating from a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. [8] [9] [10] [11] From the outset, the causative agent was thought to be viral, with most patients reporting fever or dyspnea. 9, 11 With unprecedented numbers of individuals under travel restrictions or quarantine, worldwide spread, and no known cure or vaccine yet available, COVID-19 has proven a formidable adversary. 12, [13] [14] [15] J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2020, the greatest number of new cases are now being reported in Italy, Spain, Germany, and the United States (U.S.) (Figures 3 and 4) . [24] [25] [26] Based on what is known about other coronaviruses, experts believe COVID-19 primarily spreads from person-to-person through close contact (approximately 6 feet) by respiratory droplets. 4, 8, 14, 23, 27 Transmission of the virus through contaminated surfaces or fomites with subsequent contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth may also occur. 14, 23, 27 Patients are felt to be at highest risk of spreading the illness when they are most symptomatic. 23, 27 Limited data support viral shedding in asymptomatic patients while increased levels of viral shedding may be more pronounced in those critically ill. [28] [29] [30] Current epidemiologic patterns of COVID- 19 in China indicate that it is highly contagious with sustained spread; the extent of person-to-person transmission within the U.S. was initially limited and continues to evolve daily. 23 The current R 0 or basic reproduction number is estimated to be greater than 2.2; for every case of identified in the population, more than 2 additional cases are possible in the absence of adequate isolation. 20, [31] [32] [33] In an early epidemiologic analysis of 425 COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China, the median patient age was 59 years, and 56% were male. 20 In the largest study to date of COVID-19, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f comprising over 72,000 patient records (up to from China, 86.6% of patients were 30-79 years of age. 34 While 80.9% of these cases were reported to be mild, the overall case fatality rate was 2.3%. 34 Few pediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported, with patients aged 0-19 years representing just 2.1% of all cases. 34, 35 Approximately 3.8% of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 occurred in healthcare personnel, and 14.6% of these cases were either severe or critical. 34 To be classified as severe, the following characteristics were required: PaO2/FiO2 <300, oxygen saturation \u226493%, presence of >50% lung infiltrates within 24-48 hours, respirations \u2265 30 breaths/minute, or dyspnea. 34 Critical patients, defined as those with septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction/failure, and/or respiratory failure, accounted for approximately 5% of the study population with a case fatality rate of 49.0%. 34, 24 The highest case fatality rate was observed in those older than 80 years (14.8%). 34 Patients without comorbidities had a case fatality rate of just 0.9%, in contrast to those with comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease (10.5%). 34 Caution should be exercised in interpreting early findings, as underreporting and variable testing practices have been a concern with COVID-19. 36, 37 Case fatality rates in Hubei Province have been reported to be 18% (95% confidence interval [CI] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , while those outside mainland China range from 1.2-5.1%. 38 Mortality rates have been calculated to be as high as 11-15%. 39, 40 When compared to other recent epidemics such as SARS (9.56) or EVD (39.53), the average case fatality rate (4.2%) for COVID-19 is much lower (Table   1) . 41, 42 In comparison, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and 2017 influenza season were responsible for approximately 220 times more cases. 41, 42 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Based on what is known about similar coronaviruses, the longest potential incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to be 14 days from initial exposure. 4, 6 The mean incubation period is 5.2 days (95% CI 4.1-7.0) but can range from 2 to 14 days. 4, 20, 43 Coinfections occur in 22-33% of patients and may be higher in critical patients. 44, 45 \n\nRisk factors for severe COVID-19 disease include advanced age, chronic medical conditions, immunocompromise, and cancer. 46 Data regarding pregnancy and COVID-19 are limited. 47 Pregnant women and fetuses may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection compared to the general population. 48 There are case reports of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 complicated by adverse outcomes including preterm birth. 47 Historically, infants born to mothers with other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV have been small for gestational age or preterm. 47 Newborn infants are also an at-risk population. 48 Occupational exposure to pathogens is an inherent risk of working in healthcare settings. 49 During the 2003 SARS outbreak, 9% of healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Toronto, Canada participating in endotracheal intubation of infected patients became infected themselves. 50 In another study, 77% of SARS patients in Toronto had ties to the hospital setting, and 51% of cases were HCPs. 51 During the H1N1 influenza pandemic, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f HCPs were significantly more likely to develop infection (odds ratio [OR] 2.08, 95% CI 1.73-2.51) with a pooled prevalence of 6.3%. 52 As COVID-19 has disproportionately affected HCPs, emergency physicians must be vigilant about potential exposure risks and adhere to appropriate infection prevention precautions. 53, 54 In Italy, anywhere from 8-30%\n\nof HCPs have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. 55, 56 \n\nThe symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses and include fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea. 6, 8, 43 The differential diagnosis for COVID-19\n\nshould be tailored to the patient and their presenting symptoms and comorbidities.\n\nInfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), other viral illnesses, and bacterial pneumonia should be considered, as well as other pulmonary diseases (ie, pulmonary embolism). Completing a thorough yet focused history and physical examination and obtaining collateral history from family members are vital. Aside from pulmonary symptoms, patients with COVID-19 may initially present with more vague complaints including diarrhea, lethargy, myalgias, and nausea. 40, 57 Patients may also experience headache, confusion, vomiting, pleurisy, sore throat, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. 40, 58 A case series of 41 patients (median age 49.0 years) with COVID-19 from Wuhan, China found the most commonly reported symptoms were cough (76%), fever (98%), or dyspnea (55%). 39 In the same case series, patients also reported myalgias/fatigue (44%), productive cough (28%), headache (8%), hemoptysis (5%), and diarrhea (3%). 39 In a nationwide study of COVID-19 cases from across China, the most common presenting symptoms included cough (68%), fever (44%), fatigue (38%), J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f sputum production (34%), and shortness of breath (19%). 59 Fever was not a predominant symptom at the time of initial presentation. In patients with more severe disease, dyspnea may be present in 37% of patients and progress to acute lung injury in 15% of patients. 60 One study of 204 patients with confirmed COVID-19 suggests 48.5% of patients have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. 61 These symptoms may include anorexia (83.8%), diarrhea (29.3%), vomiting (0.8%), and abdominal pain (0.4%). Seven of the 204 patients had only GI symptoms with no respiratory symptoms. 61 Atypical presentations of infection in general may be more likely in the elderly and immunocompromised, who may not mount a febrile response. 62, 63 To increase sensitivity and identify potential COVID-19 patients sooner, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using a temperature cutoff of 100.0 F o . 64 Patients older than 60 years of age and those with comorbidities may also present with more severe disease compared to other populations. 58 Three major trajectories for COVID-19 have been described: mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) necessitating aggressive resuscitative measures. 65 Anywhere from 17-29% of patients may develop ARDS. 39, 40 Other complications of COVID-19 include secondary bacterial infection, acute kidney injury, septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and cardiac injury. 39, 40 Initial Approach to COVID-19 in the Emergency Department (Table 2 ). Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have had a subjective or confirmed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). 66 In concert with clinician judgment regarding patient presentations compatible with COVID-19, CDC guidelines prioritize patients from defined populations for further evaluation and testing as persons under investigation (PUI) ( Table 3 ). These criteria are not exhaustive, and patients with an unestablished etiology or equivocal history of exposure may be considered for further testing on an individual basis. 67 Confirmed local COVID-19 cases in the setting of known community transmission should reduce the threshold for further COVID-19 evaluation in the ED. Collaboration with local and state public health departments is strongly recommended. 62,67 A PUI should be asked to wear a facemask to reduce risk of transmission to others in the immediate vicinity. Figure 4 details CDC recommendations for identifying and assessing suspected COVID-19. \n\nEmergency medical services (EMS) directors and public health authorities working in conjunction with the CDC will need to modify emergency preparedness strategies to address COVID-19. 68 Emergency medical dispatchers should consider whether callers describing risk factors and symptoms concerning for COVID-19 should be identified as a potential PUI. 30, 68 If so, EMS personnel arriving on-scene as well as HCP at the receiving hospital should be notified immediately to ensure proper personal protective equipment (PPE) use and confirm that appropriate isolation facilities are available. 30, 68 Once contact is made with the patient, initial triage and assessment should be done at least 6 feet away and minimized until the PUI dons a facemask. 68 In addition to limiting the number of EMS personnel in the patient compartment, personnel providing any direct patient care should follow standard, droplet (surgical mask), and contact precautions (gown and gloves) while wearing eye protection (face shield or goggles). 68 Airborne precautions (N95 respirator) should be employed if the patient is critically ill and/or if an aerosolgenerating procedure is anticipated during transport. Ideally, transport vehicles with isolated compartments or high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration should be used and if coordinated with the receiving healthcare facility, transportation of the patient directly into an isolation room. 68 After the patient has been transported and EMS documentation is being completed, patient compartment doors should be left open to allow proper ventilation. 68 When cleaning the vehicle, disposable gown, gloves, surgical mask, and face shield should be worn. 68 Routine cleaning should be followed by application of a hospital- Personnel cleaning empty PUI rooms should follow droplet, contact, and standard precautions with eye protection as infectious particles may be present. 63 It is unclear how long SARS-CoV-2 remains in the air, but drawing parallels from other airborne disease such as tuberculosis can be helpful, particularly if an aerosol-generating procedure has been performed. 63 Frequently used surfaces should be cleaned at least twice daily with implementation of standard institutional cleaning procedures. 71\n\nIntubation is a high-risk procedure due to the aerosolization of respiratory droplets. 30, 72 Rescue intubations should be avoided whenever possible as complete adherence to PPE respirator and placement of the patient in an AIIR. 70 Based on prior cases of HCPs infected with SARS-CoV while using N95 respirators, some experts recommend using a PAPR. 72 The most experienced provider should intubate. 70, 72 To reduce inadvertent contamination by touching one's face or hair, a full face shield and head cover is recommended if a PAPR is not used. 30, 72 Wrist exposure can be minimized by using longer-sleeved gloves or vertically taping gloves to the gown. 30 Applying tape circumferentially makes removing PPE more difficult and does not have added benefit. 30 Shoe covers should be avoided, as they can lead to accidental self-contamination. Instead, impermeable shoes that can be appropriately decontaminated should be worn. 30 If available, coveralls with or without a hood may be used, but processes and training in safe doffing should be established beforehand as HCPs may be less experienced in using these PPE ensembles. 30 HCPs may consider double gloving and positioning waste and other transport receptacles close by to limit droplet and/or contact transmission when securing contaminated equipment for disposal or reprocessing. 72 Preoxygenation should be optimized with nonaerosol generating strategies including head of bed elevation, jaw thrust, and use of positive end expiratory pressure valves. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy should be avoided unless absolutely necessary as atomization of anesthetic will cause the virus to become aerosolized. 72 Similarly, to minimize potential aerosolization from manual ventilation, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f preoxygenation for at least 5 minutes with 100% oxygen before performing rapid sequence intubation (RSI) may be used with nasal cannula, though this may increase the risk of contamination. 30, 72 To reduce this risk, a surgical mask can be placed on the patient over the device. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may increase risk of aerosolization and is not recommended for preoxygenation. 30, 72 A high efficiency hydrophobic filter should be used between the facemask and the rest of the respiratory circuit. 72 Video laryngoscopy is preferred to direct laryngoscopy to increase distance between the intubator and the patient. 30 ,70 A closed system should be utilized for suctioning. Once the intubation is complete, the emergency physician should immediately place the laryngoscope in their outer glove along with all other equipment used for intubation in a double zip-locked plastic bag. 72 The presence of a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter should be verified in the expiratory limb of the mechanical ventilator prior to patient use.\n\nThe CDC has developed a real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory specimens obtained from COVID-19 PUIs. 73 74 A nasopharyngeal swab specimen should be collected for testing. 75 For lower respiratory tract specimens, sputum can be obtained from patients with productive cough, otherwise bronchoalveolar lavage or tracheal aspirate can be substituted. 75 Serum samples are not necessary. 75, 76 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Data regarding sensitivity and specificity for the test have not been published, but false negatives may be seen in asymptomatic individuals or those early in the course of their disease who may not have high viral burden. 27 Patients who test negative for COVID-19\n\nusing a sample taken while they were symptomatic likely do not have the disease. 6 However, the sensitivity of RT-PCR has been reported to range from 66% to 80%. 77 Anemia, lymphopenia, hypoxemia, abnormal kidney and liver function, elevated creatine kinase and D-dimer, thrombocytopenia, and increased lactate dehydrogenase can be present. 39, 40, 58 Lymphocytopenia can occur in up to 80% of patients. 60 Interestingly, one study found procalcitonin was elevated in just 6% of patients, while other inflammatory markers like serum ferritin and C-reactive protein were elevated. 40 Troponin and brain natriuretic peptide may be elevated in those with cardiac involvement and should be obtained in patients with suspected myocardial infarction or heart failure. 78 Advanced imaging such as computed tomography (CT) is not required for diagnosis and Patients may also have radiographic ground-glass opacities. 58 Another study of 99 COVID-19 patients found 75% of patients had bilateral pneumonia, 25% had unilateral pneumonia, and 14% had mottling and ground-glass opacities on chest x-ray and CT imaging. 40 Ultrasound can be utilized as well, as it is repeatable and reliable, has no radiation, and is Patients presenting with respiratory insufficiency in the setting of potential COVID-19\n\ninfection should be given supplementary oxygen to maintain an oxygenation saturation \u226590% but no higher than 96%. 62, 70 Up to 76% of patients require oxygen therapy. 40 Over-resuscitation with intravenous fluids should be avoided, which can potentially worsen oxygenation. 62 Even when COVID-19 is suspected as the cause of the patient's symptoms, the WHO recommends administering empiric antibiotics and a neuraminidase inhibitor within 1 hour of identifying sepsis. 62 Early recognition of septic shock is critical, with management of sepsis focusing on intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotics. 62 A conservative fluid strategy with buffered/balanced crystalloids is recommended for those in shock, and hypotonic crystalloids should be avoided. 62 Remdesivir has demonstrated activity against MERS-CoV and SARS-Cov in vitro and animal models. 82, 83 An in vitro study found that remdesivir and chloroquine inhibit viral infection, but further study is required. 84, 85 Results from a single study of over 100 COVID-19 patients found chloroquine was superior to control in reducing pneumonia exacerbation, improving imaging findings and virus-negative conversion, and shortening the course of the disease. 86 A study evaluating lopinavir-ritonavir found no improvement in patient survival or differences in detectable viral RNA. 87 Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are also under study. 88 In a single prospective, observational study of 36 patients with COVID-19, those receiving hydroxychloroquine demonstrated higher rates of viral load reduction/disappearance, though no patient centered outcomes were assessed. 88 Other medications under study include tocilizumab and favipiravir. 89 and no significant comorbidities without concern for deterioration of clinical condition may be candidates for discharge, self-quarantine for two weeks, and home monitoring. 93 These patients must have the ability to be safely isolated at home to prevent transmission to others and be carefully monitored. 22 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Table 2 .
