{"title": "Pharmacological targets in the ubiquitin system offer new ways of treating\n          cancer, neurodegenerative disorders and infectious diseases", "body": "Protein degradation by the proteasome, a multicatalytic proteinase complex, is at the\n        centre of the UPS pathway (Fig. 1), and its\n        pharmacological inhibition was originally considered lethal for all cell types. It was\n        therefore rather surprising that bortezomib (Velcade) was approved as treatment for multiple\n        myeloma in 2003 (Ref. 16). Since then, bortezomib\n        has also been approved for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (Ref. 17). More recently, other derivatives have been developed that are at\n        various stages of clinical trials, such as carfizomib (Phase III against relapsed multiple\n        myeloma), MLN9708 (Phase I), CEP18770 (Phase I) and the natural product NPI-0052 (Phase I)\n        (Ref. 3) (Fig.\n        1). Ubistatins were also discovered to inhibit proteasomal proteolysis by interfering\n        with the recognition of polyubiquitin chains by the proteasome (Ref. 18). In addition to NPI-0052, further natural products with potential\n        anticancer properties have been characterised to interfere with proteasomal proteolysis\n        (reviewed in Ref. 19), such as celastrol (Ref.\n          20), catechin(\u2212), the component of\n        green tea (Ref. 21), disulfiram in combination with\n        copper (Ref. 22), a triterpenoid inhibitor (Ref.\n          23), curcumin (Ref. 24) and JBIR-22, which inhibits homodimer formation of proteasome\n        assembly factor 3 (Ref. 25). Many of these natural\n        products have intrinsic antitumour properties, although it is not clear whether this is\n        solely attributable to their proteasome inhibitory capacities. For instance, statins have\n        pleiotropic effects and are used to treat a variety of different diseases, including\n        prevention of cardiovascular events, although it is not entirely clear whether this is due\n        to direct or indirect interference with proteasomal proteolysis (Ref. 26). As expected, proteasome inhibition causes side effects such as\n        peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression, nausea, hypersensibility and increased\n        susceptibility to infection (Ref. 27). One problem\n        with proteasome inhibitors is the emergence of resistance; however, the combination of\n        several proteasome inhibitors that exert complementary specificities appears to overcome the\n        problem of resistance and might have the added benefit of enabling reduced dosing of the\n        individual drugs (Refs 28, 29). An alternative way of circumventing the general toxicity of these\n        compounds is to develop inhibitors selective for immunoproteasomes (Refs 30, 31).\n        Immunoproteasomes are predominantly expressed in B-cells, T-cells, macrophages, dendritic\n        cells and other cell types of the haematopoietic lineage, and can be induced by cell\n        exposure to interferon-\u03b3 and tumour necrosis factor -\u03b1. This leads to an\n        exchange of the catalytic \u03b2-subunits, thereby enhancing antigen presentation and\n        preserving cell viability during inflammation-induced oxidative stress (Refs 32, 33). Based\n        on the observation that the immunoproteasome promotes enhanced antigen processing and\n        presentation, it is predicted that immunoproteasome inhibitors may have immunomodulatory\n        effects, such as attenuating autoimmune-related pathologies. Indeed, a selective\n        immunoproteasome inhibitor PR957 was shown to prevent experimental colitis (Ref. 34) and interfere with arthritis in a mouse model (Ref.\n          35). This strategy appears to be less toxic and\n        particularly promising for treating autoimmune disorders, and might be extended to targeting\n        the thymoproteasome, a subform expressed in the thymus (Ref. 36).\n\nUSP7, also known as Herpes virus associated USP (HAUSP), is critical in cancer\n          progression because of its destabilising effect on the tumour suppressor p53 (Refs 8, 42, 43). USP7 preferentially deubiquitylates the E3\n          ligase HDM2 and its binding partner HDMX, resulting in the destabilisation of p53 and the\n          repression of p53 transactivation activity (Refs 43, 44, 45). Additional substrates of USP7 include claspin, FOXO4 and PTEN (Refs 40, 46,\n            47). Thus USP7 exerts both p53-dependent and\n          p53-independent effects on the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis, making USP7 an\n          attractive target for pharmaceutical intervention (Refs 48, 49). Recently, a high-throughput\n          screen identified the small-molecule compound HBX 41,108 as an uncompetitive and\n          reversible inhibitor of USP7 (Figs 1 and 2). HBX 41,108 (Fig.\n            2, compound 1) is a functionalised cyano-indenopyrazine derivative\n          that inhibits several DUBs, including USP7, and stabilises p53 in a nongenotoxic manner,\n          resulting in the induction of apoptosis (Refs 5,\n            50). An independent screen recently identified\n          compound P005091 and analogues such as P045204 and P022077 (Fig. 2, compound 2) as USP7 inhibitors in vitro and in living cells\n          (Refs 51, 59). Proof of concept in cells was demonstrated by the stabilisation of p53 and\n          the induction of p21 by a representative compound from the P005091 series (Ref. 49). \n\nAs a function of its key role in the regulation of receptor endocytosis and trafficking,\n          USP8 (UBPY) interacts with a number of clinically relevant cancer targets, including the\n          epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Ref. 60). Knockdown of USP8 results in the accumulation of ubiquitylated EGFR in\n          endosomes (Ref. 61). Hybrigenics reported the\n          identification of the USP8 inhibitor HBX 90,397 (Fig.\n          2, compound 3). However, the clinical usefulness of USP8 inhibitors is\n          questionable following the report that conditional knockout of USP8 in adult mice resulted\n          in liver failure, probably as a result of pronounced decreases in receptor tyrosine\n          kinases such as EGFR (Refs 62, 63).\n\nProstaglandins are also reported to have inhibitory activity against DUBs in cellular\n          assays. This family of compounds form a group of lipid derivatives that serve as\n          signalling molecules that affect diverse protein functions, depending on their\n          localisation and physiological context. Prostaglandins have been characterised as\n          important messengers in inflammation (Ref. 64)\n          and immune responses (Refs 65, 66), with emerging roles in cancer. The J-series\n          prostaglandins are known to promote apoptosis in a p53-independent fashion (Refs 67, 68).\n          D12-prostaglandin J2 was shown to inhibit ubiquitin isopeptidase activity in cell lysates,\n          owing to the presence of the cross-conjugated \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones in\n          their structure (Fig. 1). Similarly, compounds\n          unrelated to prostaglandins, but also containing cross-conjugated\n          \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones and accessible \u03b2-carbons, also inhibit\n          isopeptidase activity. By contrast, the A-series prostaglandins, which contain a single\n          \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone, are less efficacious as ubiquitin isopeptidase\n          inhibitors (Refs 68, 69). Hence, the mechanism of inhibition by J-series prostaglandins is\n          most likely based on the nucleophilic addition of a DUB thiol to the endocyclic\n          \u03b2-carbon of a compound and the electrophilic accessibility of prostaglandin\n          resulting from olefin\u2013ketone conjugation. The inhibitory effect of\n          prostaglandins is exemplified by 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2)\n            (Fig. 2, compound 4), which\n          inhibits the activities of UCHL-3 (Ref. 54) and\n          UCH-L1 (Refs 56, 57) (Fig. 1). 15d-PGJ2 has a\n          detrimental effect on UCH-L1 structure and therefore perturbs its activity, offering\n          possibilities of interfering with progression of Parkinson disease associated with UCH-L1\n          mutations (Ref. 57).\n\nPunaglandins are cyclopentadienone and cyclopentenone prostaglandins chlorinated at the\n          endocyclic \u03b1-carbon position. These compounds, originally isolated from\n            Telesto riisei coral, exhibit anti-inflammatory and antitumour\n          activities (Ref. 70), with higher cytotoxic\n          effects on cells than the J-series prostaglandins. Interestingly, their effect on\n          apoptosis is independent of p53 (Ref. 71).\n          Consistent with this, punaglandins, such as punaglandin 4, are also more potent inhibitors\n          of cellular DUB activity than the J-series prostaglandins. The proposed mechanism for this\n          enhanced inhibitor activity is the presence of an electronegative Cl substituent at the\n          \u03b1-position of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyls that increases the\n          reactivity towards the nucleophilic addition of the DUB catalytic cysteine thiol group.\n          These chlorinated lipids could therefore represent a new class of cancer therapeutics\n          (Ref. 71).\n\nInhibitors based on other molecular scaffolds with preferential specificity towards UCHs\n          have also been reported. For instance, Stein and colleagues have reported the discovery of\n          isatin O-acyl oximes (Fig. 2,\n          compounds 5 and 6) with inhibitory activity against UCH-L1 and\n          UCH-L3 (Ref. 55). More recently, the same group\n          reported a second series of UCH-L1 inhibitors based on a pyridone scaffold (Ref. 72). The authors speculate that these compounds might\n          have potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions.\n\nIn HTS, the small-molecule compound IU1 was found to be a selective inhibitor of USP14.\n          USP14 is a DUB associated with the proteasome that blocks the degradation of ubiquitylated\n          substrates. Cellular data confirmed the hypothesis that IU1-mediated inhibition of USP14\n          indirectly accelerates proteasomal degradation of proteins, such as tau and ataxin-3, both\n          of which are involved in neurodegenerative diseases (Ref. 53). Because many neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson\n          disease and Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease are associated with the accumulation of\n          misfolded proteins, IU1 (Fig. 2, compound\n          7) or other USP14-directed small-molecule inhibitors could potentially be\n          used to eliminate these toxic proteins and improve the prognosis in neurodegenerative\n          diseases. In support of this, USP14 has been previously linked to neurodegenerative\n          disease, and loss of USP14 leads to an ataxic neurological phenotype in mice (Refs 73, 74).\n\nWP1130 (degrasyn) is a derivative of AG490, a small-molecule compound that blocks\n          Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) activity. In cells, WP1130 treatment induces accumulation\n          of polyubiquitylated conjugates. This phenomenon has been attributed to the inhibitory\n          activity of WP1130 towards several DUBs, including USP9x, USP5, USP14 and UCH-L5 (Ref.\n            75). WP1130 might be of therapeutic value, and\n          its proapoptotic properties have been recently described (Ref. 76). In support of this, treatment of cells with WP1130 results in\n          the modulation of anti- and proapoptotic proteins, such as MCL-1 and p53 (Ref. 75). Further work suggests that WP1130 could be\n          administered with bortezomib because the combination resulted in synergistic inhibition of\n          tumour cells, regulation of apoptosis and prolonged survival of the animals (Ref. 77).\n\nRecently, an additional broad-specificity DUB inhibitor, PR-619 (Fig. 2, compound 8), was discovered using\n          ubiquitin\u2013CHOP reporter technology (Refs 51, 78). Given its broad specificity, the\n          utility of PR-619 probably lies in its role as a tool for recovering ubiquitylated\n          proteins from both cell-free and cellular experimental systems.\n\nViruses also encode DUBs, and these can be targeted to block viral infection. Papain-like\n          protease (PLpro) is a DUB encoded by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\n          (SARS-CoV) (Refs 12, 79, 80). PLpro blocks\n          IRF3-dependent antiviral responses, indicating its relevance to key infectious processes\n          and viral evasion of host innate immune responses. GRL0617 is a noncovalent inhibitor of\n          PLpro (Fig. 2, compound 9), which\n          blocks SARS-CoV viral replication without measurable cytotoxic effects and hence is a\n          promising antiviral drug candidate. GRL0617 induces a conformational change in PLpro,\n          which effectively inactivates this DUB. Profiling of DUB activity in cells exposed to\n          GRL0617 using ubiquitin-specific active-site probes demonstrated that this inhibitor is\n          selective for PLpro, which might explain its low cytotoxicity (Ref. 58).\n\nIn summary, these studies illustrate the potential of many DUBs as suitable drug targets.\n          Several challenges remain, but more recent developments in novel discovery platforms and\n          enzyme substrates such as multi-ubiquitin chains of different type and length, CHOP\n          reporter technology and other isopeptide-bond-based assays are now being used to identify\n          novel DUB inhibitors with greater specificity and sensitivity, providing the framework for\n          optimisation of more suitable drugs.\n\nNutlin-3a (Fig. 3, compound 10)\n          belongs to a class of tetrasubstituted imidazolines and is a potent nonpeptide HDM2\n          antagonist. It acts as a competitive inhibitor, blocking the interaction of p53 with HDM2\n          (Ref. 88). Consequently, Nutlin-3a stabilises p53\n          and its substrates p21 and Noxa, contributing to increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest\n          in the G1 phase. Its antitumour properties have been demonstrated for cancer cells\n          expressing wild-type p53 (Refs 97, 98). Nutlin-3a efficiently eliminates tumour\n          xenografts in mice, causing no measurable abnormalities in animals (Ref. 88). In other preclinical studies, the combination of\n          Nutlin-3a and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib induced additive cytotoxicity in\n          malignant multiple myeloma cells. These synergistic antitumour activities might extend the\n          clinical applications of bortezomib to neoplasias exhibiting reduced sensitivity to this\n          proteasome inhibitor (Ref. 99). R7112, an\n          analogue of Nutlin-3a, is currently in Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of solid\n          tumours and haematological malignancies. \n\nThe proof-of-concept data provided by the discovery of the nutlins spurred additional\n          research in this area, including the identification of the HLI98 family of compounds\n          (7-nitro-5-deazaflavin) and RITA (Fig. 3, compound\n            11) that also target the ubiquitin-ligase activity of HDM2, resulting in\n          the activation of p53-dependent apoptosis (Refs 100, 101). In addition, the\n          spiro-oxindoles exemplified by MI-63 and MI-219 (Fig.\n          3, compound 12) and the chromenotriazolopyrimidines were also reported\n          to be effective nonpeptidomimetic small-molecule inhibitors of the HDM2\u2013p53\n          interaction (Refs 102, 103, 104).\n\nAnother mode of inhibition of HDM2 is by blocking its association with the proteasome.\n          JNJ-26854165 (Fig. 3, compound 13) is\n          one of the first compounds found to induce p53 levels in tumour cell lines and activate\n          p53 transcriptional activity (Ref. 89).\n          JNJ-26854165 is currently being investigated as an oral agent for the treatment of\n          refractory solid tumours in clinical trials.\n\nNatural products are also an important source of novel E3 ligase inhibitors. For example,\n          53 000 microbial extracts derived from fermented microorganisms, such as\n          actinomycete bacteria and fungi, were screened to discover new compounds that antagonise\n          the HDM2\u2013p53 interaction. Among these, chlorofusin (Fig. 3, compound 14), a fungal metabolite isolated from\n            Fusarium sp., was found to have the highest inhibitory activity towards\n          HDM2 (Ref. 90). Chlorofusin has a nine-residue\n          cyclic peptide containing an l-ornithine side chain linked to a highly\n          functionalised tricyclic chromophore. Further studies established that neither the cyclic\n          peptide, the chromophore of chlorofusin alone or simple derivatives thereof account for\n          inhibition of the HDM2\u2013p53 interaction, but that the whole structure of\n          chlorofusin is required (Ref. 105).\n\nThe second example of a natural product that exhibits inhibition of the\n          p53\u2013HDM2 interaction is the (\u2212) enantiomer of hexylitaconic acid\n          isolated from a culture of marine-sponge-derived fungus Arthrinium sp.\n          (Ref. 91). The (\u2212) hexylitaconic acid\n          impairs p53\u2013HDM2 interactions in a dose-dependent manner, but its derivatives,\n          including a monomethyl ester, a dihydro derivative and a dihydro derivative monomethyl\n          ester, showed no inhibitory activity.\n\nChalcones are aromatic ketones previously characterised as potential antitumourigenic\n          therapeutics in ovarian cancer (Ref. 92), gastric\n          cancer and other tumours (Ref. 106). Chalcone\n          derivatives interfere with p53\u2013HDM2 interactions by binding near the\n          tryptophan-binding pocket of the HDM2 hydrophobic cleft (Ref. 93). Molecular modelling studies indicate that boronic acid binds to\n          lysine residues Lys51 and Lys94 of HDM2 (Ref. 107). The detailed mechanism of the cytotoxic activity of chalcones remains to be\n          determined. In some cases, the enhanced apoptosis is related to inhibition of the 20S\n          proteasome and thus stabilisation of p53, as exemplified by boronic chalcone derivative\n          AM114 (Fig. 3, compound 15) (Ref.\n            108). Regardless, it seems likely that\n          chalcone-mediated inhibition of the p53\u2013HDM2 interaction is a contributory\n          mechanism to their reported antitumour properties (Ref. 93).\n\nHDM2 is not the only ubiquitin E3 ligase that constitutes a potential therapeutic target.\n            SCFSkp2 is an SCF (S-phase kinase-associated protein\n          1\u2013cullin\u2013F-box) ubiquitin E3 ligase containing Skp2, an F-box protein\n          that determines substrate specificity. Upregulation of SCFSkp2 is associated\n          with decreased p27Kip1 levels and is negatively correlated with a good prognosis in cancer\n          (Ref. 109); therefore, compounds directly\n          targeting SCFSkp2 represent potential drugs for cancer therapy. Using HTS, Chen\n          and colleagues identified compound A (CpdA) as a promising SCFSkp2 inhibitor\n          that prevents incorporation of Skp2 F-box protein into the SCFSkp2 ligase\n          complex. CpdA thus leads to ubiquitin-dependent accumulation of substrates for\n            SCFSkp2 E3 ligase activity, such as p27, and consequently induces\n          G1\u2013S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Notably, CpdA works synergistically with\n          the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Ref. 110),\n          probably by interfering with Cul1 neddylation.\n\nRecently, two additional examples of E3 inhibitors were reported. First, using a\n          fluorescence polarisation screen, the biplanar dicarboxylic acid compound SCF-I2 was shown\n          to be an allosteric inhibitor of substrate recognition by the yeast F-box protein\n            SCFCdc4. SCFCdc4 degrades many substrates, such as SIC1, in a\n          phosphorylation-dependent manner, and the SCF-I2 inhibitor perturbs the phosphodegron\n          binding pocket of SCFCdc4 (Ref. 111).\n          A second group used a yeast-based chemical genetics screen to identify modulators of\n            SCFMet30 activity (Ref. 112).\n          Biochemical studies confirmed that SMER3 specifically inhibits\n          SCFMet30-dependent ubiquitylation of the transcription factor Met4 by reducing\n          the binding of Met30 to Skp1, which is probably due to its direct binding to Met30.\n\nCereblon (CRBN), damaged DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1) and Cul4A form an E3 ligase complex\n          that is important for embryonic development. This complex is targeted by thalidomide\n            (Fig. 3, compound 16), a clinically\n          approved drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma, leprosy and inflammatory bowel\n          disease (Crohn disease) (Ref. 113). One of the\n          enantiomers of thalidomide was found to have teratogenic side effects. Binding of\n          thalidomide to the CRBN complex and inhibition of CRBN E3 ligase activity appear to be the\n          underlying molecular mechanisms for thalidomide-induced teratogenicity by the perturbation\n          of embryonic development (Ref. 94).\n\nMuRF1 is a key effector enzyme of muscular atrophy, an area of unmet medical need for\n          several different pathologies (Ref. 114). Using\n          an ELISA-based HTS platform, Progenra identified a novel modulator of the E3 ubiquitin\n          ligase, P013222, which inhibited MuRF1 autoubiquitylation and myosin heavy-chain\n          ubiquitylation and protected myotubes from dexamethasone-induced muscle wasting (Ref.\n            115).\n\nAs outlined above, most of the identified E3 ligase inhibitors are directed towards\n          protein\u2013protein interactions, and their \u2018druggability\u2019 is\n          therefore challenging. The complexity of this enzyme family, the lack of details on their\n          precise molecular mechanism and the fact that most E3s rely on protein\u2013protein\n          interactions to mediate their activity makes the design of E3 ligase inhibitors difficult\n          (Ref. 4), but potentially offers the framework for\n          translational applications by interfering with many different biological processes in a\n          highly specific manner. Recent reports of the identification of specific SCF inhibitors\n          increase our confidence that it will be possible to develop inhibitors of this emerging\n          class of important drug targets.\n\nUbiquitin conjugation requires initial activation of ubiquitin by E1 enzyme, which\n        adenylates the C-terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin, forming a high-energy ubiquitin\n        adenylate intermediate, followed by the formation of a thiol ester between the carboxyl\n        group of Gly76 of ubiquitin and a thiol group of E1. This series of reactions activates the\n        C-terminus of ubiquitin for a subsequent nucleophilic attack (Ref. 116). Blocking this reaction could therefore be used to inhibit\n        ubiquitin conjugation. In vitro studies suggest that knockdown of E1 ligase results in lower\n        levels of protein ubiquitylation and eventually induces cell death in malignant cells (Ref.\n          117). To identify novel E1 inhibitors, Yang and\n        colleagues screened a library of small compounds and identified\n        4[4-(5-nitro-furan-2-ylmethylene)-3,5-dioxo-pyrazolidin-1-yl]-benzoic acid ethyl ester\n        (PYR-41) as the first cell-permeable E1 inhibitor. PYR-41 efficiently reduces bulk protein\n        ubiquitylation and sumoylation, and prevents degradation of p53, contributing to enhanced\n        apoptosis. PYR-41 also attenuates cytokine-mediated nuclear factor-\u03baB\n        (NF-\u03baB) activation by regulating proteasomal degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1,\n        an inhibitory subunit of NF-\u03baB. Functionally, PYR-41 probably binds irreversibly to\n        the active-site cysteine in E1 ligase, therefore preventing ubiquitin transfer (Ref. 95). However, this compound also targets several DUBs,\n        including USP5, and crosslinks to kinases and has antitumour activity in animals (Ref. 118). PYZD-4409 (Fig.\n          3, compound 17), another small-molecule inhibitor, has been shown to\n        interfere with the activity of E1 ligase, preferentially inducing tumour cell death in\n        primary acute myeloid leukaemia cells. The effects of PYZD-4409 have also been studied in a\n        mouse model of leukaemia, where it reduced tumour weight and volume. This study underlines\n        the importance of E1 as a potential drug target in leukaemia and possibly other cancers,\n        especially in cases where neoplastic cells are resistant to treatment with proteasome\n        inhibitors such as bortezomib (Ref. 117).\n        Furthermore, two natural products have been identified to inhibit E1, panepophenanthrin\n        isolated from the mushroom Panus rudis (Refs 119, 120) and himeic acid A\n        derived from the fungus Aspergillus sp. (Ref. 121), both of which inhibit the E1-catalysed ubiquitin activation in\n        vitro, but with unknown mechanisms.\n\nRecently, small-molecule inhibitors of E2 enzymes were also discovered. Leucettamol A, a\n        compound isolated from a marine sponge Leucetta aff. Microrhaphis, was\n        identified as a novel inhibitor of the Ubc13\u2013Uev1A interaction, thereby blocking\n        the formation of the E1\u2013E2 complex (Ref. 122). Also, an allosteric inhibitor of the human Cdc34 E2 ligase, CC0651, was found\n        through a small-molecule screen for inhibitors of SCFSkp2-dependent\n        ubiquitylation of p27Kip1, and was shown to interfere with the proliferation of human cancer\n        cell lines (Ref. 123).\n\nGenerally, when targeting E1\u2013E2 conjugating enzymes, several pathways that are\n        dependent on ubiquitylation, such as DNA repair or endocytosis, are inhibited at the same\n        time, potentially contributing to increased nonspecific cytotoxicity. Therefore, from the\n        therapeutic standpoint, the use of ubiquitin E1 (or E2)-specific inhibitors is currently\n        awaiting additional preclinical validation before advancing to clinical studies.\n\nNeural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated-8 (NEDD8) is a ubiquitin-like\n        protein with the highest homology to ubiquitin. Its conjugation to substrates (neddylation)\n        requires activation by the E1 APPBP1-UBA3 and transfer by the E2 UBC12 (Ref. 124). NEDD8 primarily functions in the regulation of\n        E3 ubiquitin ligases, modifying most members of the cullin family. Cullins are scaffold\n        components of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases that control the proteasomal degradation of\n        proteins involved in the cell cycle, transcriptional regulation or signal transduction (Refs\n          124, 125). Neddylation of cullins results in increased ubiquitylation of the SCF\n        substrate proteins and their subsequent proteasomal degradation. SCF E3 ligases promote the\n        ubiquitylation of proteins involved in inflammation and tumourigenesis (Ref. 126), such as HIF-\u03b1 and\n        I\u03baB\u03b1 (Refs 127, 96); therefore, specific inhibition of NEDD8-activating\n        enzymes (E1) and other components of the neddylation pathway represents an alternative\n        approach to targeting the UPS for cancer treatment. MLN4924 (Fig. 3, compound 18) is a small-molecule inhibitor of the\n        NEDD8-activating enzyme and is presently being evaluated in Phase I clinical trials. MLN4924\n        increases the apoptosis of several tumour cell lines and murine tumour xenografts and is\n        considered a promising drug candidate for myeloid leukaemia (Refs 96, 128, 129). In contrast to the proteasome inhibitor\n        bortezomib, MLN4924 is more specific because it does not inhibit bulk proteasomal\n        degradation (Ref. 96). The functional mechanism of\n        MLN4924 involves formation of the MLN4924\u2013NEDD8 covalent adduct, which is similar\n        to the first intermediate of the reaction catalysed by the NEDD8-activating enzyme, thus\n        efficiently inhibiting the NEDD8 E1 enzyme (Ref. 130).\n\nGiven that SCF E3 ligases represent several hundred of all known E3 ubiquitin ligases,\n        there is concern that inhibition of ~300 E3 ligases might lead to serious side effects in a\n        clinical setting. However, the impact of side effects must be taken in the context of\n        proteasome inhibitors, which have been shown to exhibit acceptable clinical profiles for the\n        treatment of cancer, yet modulate the stability of many more proteins (relative to SCF E3s).\n        Ultimately, the evaluation of MLN4924 and any successor compounds in a clinical setting will\n        determine whether this strategy is a therapeutically acceptable approach.\n\nThe ubiquitin system or \u2018ubiquitome\u2019 has been compared with the\n        well-characterised \u2018kinome\u2019 and has spurred an entire array of novel\n        inhibitors against molecular targets that manipulate ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules.\n        Similarly to the kinase field, functional redundancy, the structural similarities of active\n        sites (DUBs) and the diversity of protein\u2013protein interaction domains (conjugating\n        enzymes) render the discovery of specific inhibitors challenging. Several novel compounds\n        are promising results in clinical trials, such as the proteasome inhibitors carfizomib\n        (Phase III), MLN2238 (Phase I) and NPI-0052 (Phase I) or the NAE inhibitor MLN4924 (Phase I\n        against AML and solid tumours). Thalidomide, which has been in clinical use for many years,\n        has been recently identified as an E3 ligase inhibitor. Also, several E1 and E3 ligase\n        inhibitors such as PYR-41, Nutlin-3a, Compound A, P013222 and SCF-I2 have proved successful\n        in the preclinical stage. Generally, it remains to be determined whether small molecules are\n        required to specifically target only one molecule to be clinically useful or whether, in a\n        manner similar to medically relevant kinase inhibitors, molecules with broader specificities\n        against subfamilies of enzymes might exhibit clinical efficacy. Clearly, the emergence of\n        new inhibitors directed against UPS components supplements the activities of kinase\n        inhibitors, cytotoxic agents and other compounds, and it is predicted that ultimately the\n        combinatorial use of these drugs holds the greatest promise for future therapies against\n        cancer, neurodegenerative disorders and infectious disease. These disease pathologies are\n        highly complex, and substantial differences can occur between individuals. A broadened\n        arsenal of small-molecule compounds, including drugs targeting components of the UPS, might\n        provide the framework for individualised drug regimens as part of a trend towards\n        personalised medicine.\n\n\nGenerate further understanding of the precise role of E1/E2/E3 ligases and DUBs and\n              other components in the UPS in disease processes, to establish correlations between\n              their dysfunction and properties of disease pathology.Develop promising lead compounds into more effective inhibitors with greater\n            potency.Whereas many small-molecule compounds show antiproliferative activities in tumour\n              cell lines, it is less clear how this can be translated into inhibiting tumour growth\n              in vivo without affecting normal cells. Distinguishing between these two scenarios\n              should drive the selection and development of more effective compounds in the\n            future.Is it really necessary to chemically target one enzyme for optimal interference with\n              disease progression? Many diseases, in particular cancer, exert aberrations in several\n              biochemical pathways. The discovery and pharmacological targeting of all abnormally\n              functioning networks will be necessary for better treatments in the future.\n"}
