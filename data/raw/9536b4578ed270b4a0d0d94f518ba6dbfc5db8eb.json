This model scenario is associated with explanation I3. For partitioned \u03c1, we assume \u03c1 18 is increased after new strain invasion as:\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the time delay and T 0 is the starting time instant when new JEV strain joined the Table S2 .\n\nThe estimate of R pp is 0.026 (95% C.I.: [0.00,0.30]) under this scenario (see Fig S3) . \n\nwhere T 0 is the starting time instant when new JEV strain joined the system. The situation 28 with no invasion of new strains can be regarded as the special case that k 1 = k 2 .\n\nThe fitting results of the new JEV strain invasion scenario with variable force of infection and C p0 is assumed to be equal for simplicity. Here is the justification. The average period of 39 staying in E p , I p or C p is (1.5 + 3.0 + 2.5)/3 = 7/3 days (see Table 1 for the parameter values).\n\nThen, if a pig is assumed to be infected during its living period and we randomly select one day, 41 q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q the probability of \"the pig is in E p , I p or C p on the selected day\" is p 1 = (7/3)/234 = 0.01\n\n(where 234 days are the average pigs' lifespan). According to References, we have R p0 = 43 25% 55% (see Table 1 ), this implies there is 55%-25%=30%, as a maximum, of locally-reared as the initial proportions of E p0 , I p0 and C p0 are believed to be very small, slightly changes 52 of these three parameters will not affect our main results. q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q the effect of term \u03b8 vp on R 0 is equivalent to the terms \u221a bc in the R hv expression at the end of 84 Gao et al. [1] (please note that we do not have term \u03bb pv from pig to mosquito in our current 85 model, but as for compensations, our term \u03bb vp covers the effect of the potential term \u03bb pv ).\n\nTherefore, the percentage change on term \u03b8 vp equals to percentage change in \u03bb vp , and the 87 roughly equals to the percentage change in R 0 (by ignore the effect of pig-to-pig transmission, 88 i.e., R pp , because it is estimated to be very small). According to our estimation in scenario (by using Eqn. (10)), which is much less than current local pig population (roughly 60, 000).\n\nThis is likely to explain the mechanism of JEV resurgence in 2011."}
