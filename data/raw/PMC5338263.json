{"title": "GS-5734 and its parent nucleoside analog inhibit Filo-, Pneumo-, and Paramyxoviruses", "body": "GS-5734 and Nuc were synthesized at Gilead Sciences, Inc., and chemical identity and sample purity were established using NMR, HRMS, and HPLC analysis4. To determine concentration response curves against each virus, we used either a 7-point or a 10-point 3-fold dilution series, with each compound concentration tested in quadruplicate.\n\nHeLa (ATCC CCL-2) and Huh7 (Apath, LLC) cells were cultivated in Dulbecco\u2019s Minimal Essential Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), non-essential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293T/17 (ATCC CRL-11286), Vero (ATCC CCL-81), NCI-H358 (ATCC CRL-5807), and A549 (ATCC CCL-185) cells were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) cells (Lonza CC-2527) were cultivated using EGM-2 MV BulletKit (Lonza CC-3202). Human peripheral blood macrophages (Stemcell Technologies) were cultivated in Macrophage-SFM (Gibco). All cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2.\n\nNipah virus (NiV-M, Malaysian genotype; NiV-B, Bangladesh genotype; NiV-Luc2AM recombinant Malaysia genotype expressing Renilla luciferase; NiV-GFP2AM, recombinant Malaysian genotype expressing ZsGreen fluorescent protein)5, Hendra virus (HeV), Measles virus (MV-EZ, Edmonston-Zagreb vaccine strain; rMVEZEGFP(3), recombinant Measles Edmonston-Zagreb strain expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein)10, Mumps virus (MuV, Iowa 2006), Ebola virus (EBOV, Makona variant; EBOV-GFP, recombinant Mayinga variant expressing green-fluorescent protein; EBOV-GLuc, recombinant Mayinga variant expressing Gaussia luciferase)621; Marburg virus (MARV-GFP, recombinant Bat 371 variant expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein; MARV-Gluc, recombinant Bat 371 variant expressing Gaussia luciferase)821, Lassa virus (LASV, Josiah), Andes virus (ANDV, Chile 9717869), Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV-GFP, ZH501)22, Alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever virus (AHFV, 20030001), Omsk Hemorrhagic Fever virus (OHFV, Bogoluvovska), Kyasanur Forest Disease virus (KFDV, P9605), Tick-borne Encephalitis virus (TBEV, Hypr), and Vesicular Stomatitis virus (VSV, New Jersey) were propagated in either Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586) or Vero (ATCC CCL-81) cells, and were quantitated by 50% tissue culture infections dose (TCID50) assay using the Reed and Muench method23.

Assay plates were transferred to the BSL-4 suite (where appropriate), and infected with 0.25 TCID50 per cell of the respective virus, and were read between 48 and 144 hours post-infection (hpi) for fluorescence or luminescence, using the respectively appropriate reagents (Renilla-Glo reagent (Promega); Biolux Gaussia luciferase stabilized reagent (New England Biolabs)) depending on the virus used.\n\nLevels of viral replication was measured by either a fluorescence or chemiluminescence-based immuno-staining method using antibodies against the corresponding viral antigen(s)2425. Fluorescence or luminescence was measured using an HD1 Synergy plate reader (Biotek). Untreated infected cell control values (after subtraction of reference values) were set at 100% viral antigen.

Values were normalized to uninfected cell controls according to % viability as follows: % viability = [(specific value - reference value)/(DMSO control value - reference value)] \u00d7 100. Reference values were derived from control wells without cells. Uninfected cell control values (after subtraction of reference values) were set at 100% inhibition of CPE. EC50 values were calculated using four-parameter variable slope non-linear regression fitting of values. NiV-M, NiV-B, HeV, and VSV assays were performed in HeLa cells and H358 cells (NiV-B). AHFV, KFDV, TBEV, and OHFV assays were performed in A549 cells. Cells were seeded at 10,000\u201320,000 cells per well in white opaque 96-well plates, and compounds were added to the assay plates.

Values were normalized to DMSO controls according to % viability as follows: % viability = [(specific value - reference value)/(DMSO control value - reference value)] \u00d7 100. Reference values were derived from control wells without cells. DMSO control values (after subtraction of reference values) were set at 100% viability. 50% viability/cytotoxicity (CC50) was calculated using four-parameter variable slope non-linear regression fitting of values.\n\nA Nanoluciferase-based NiV minigenome assay was adapted from a previously developed NiV minigenome assay30. Briefly, a bacteriophage T7 polymerase-based NiV minigenome was synthesized (Genscript) expressing a reporter fusion construct of Nanoluciferase (Promega) and mNeonGreen fluorescent protein31. The open reading frame encoding the reporter fusion protein was flanked by a T7 promoter, hammerhead ribozyme, and NiV leader with N gene untranslated region at the 3\u2032 end, and the L gene untranslated region, NiV trailer, and Hepatitis delta ribozyme at the 5\u2032 end. HeLa cells (5,000 per well) were seeded in 96-well plates, and transfected with appropriate amounts of NiV support plasmids (N (50 ng/well), P (32 ng) and L (50 ng)), HeV minigenome (120 ng) and T7 polymerase (80 ng) prepared in RNase-free TE buffer, mixed with 0.8 \u03bcL/well LT-1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) and 10 \u03bcL Opti-MEM/well. Complexes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before adding to cells. Compounds were added directly to the cells 4 h post-transfection. For negative controls, the L plasmid was substituted with an equivalent amount of pcDNA 3.1 plasmid expressing the red fluorescent protein mCherry (Clontech). 48 h post-transfection of minigenome plasmids, 50 \u03bcL of Nanoluciferase assay buffer solution (Promega) was added directly to each well. Well contents were transferred to opaque white plates, and after three minutes, luminescence was read on a plate reader (HT-Synergy, Biotek). CellTiter-Glo 2.0 reagent (Promega) was added immediately following reporter minigenome luminescence reading to measure cell viability according to manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. The average raw luminescence value for untreated non-transfected cells was set as 100% cell viability. Percent (%) cell viability for individual wells were calculated by dividing their respective raw luminescence values by the average raw luminescence value for non-transfected cells. Reporter Nanoluciferase activity for each well was then normalized by dividing the nanoluciferase luminescence value by its respective % cell viability as determined above.\n\nA Gaussia luciferase-based EBOV minigenome assay was used21. Huh7 cells (10,000 per well) were seeded and transfected with appropriate amounts of EBOV support plasmids (NP (50 ng/well), VP35 (5 ng/well), VP30 (5 ng/well), L (50 ng/well)), EBOV minigenome (150 ng), and T7 polymerase (80 ng) prepared in RNase-free TE buffer mixed with 0.9 \u03bcL/well LT-1 transfection reagent (MirusBio) and 10 \u03bcL Opti-MEM/well. Complexes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before adding to cells. Compounds were added directly to the cells 4 h post-transfection. For negative controls, the L plasmid was substituted with an equivalent inactive L plasmid. 48 h post-transfection, 25 \u03bcL of supernatant from each well was transferred to opaque white plates, and was combined with 50 \u03bcL of Renilla luciferase assay reagent (Promega) via injector and read for bioluminescence in a Biotek HD1 Synergy plate reader following a 0.2 s delay. CellTiter-Glo 2.0 reagent (Promega) was added to the transfected cells, and transferred to a white opaque 96-well plate to measure cell viability according to manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. The average raw luminescence value for untreated non-transfected cells was set as 100% cell viability. Percent (%) cell viability for individual wells were calculated by dividing their respective raw luminescence values by the average raw luminescence value for non-transfected cells. Reporter Gaussia luciferase activity for each well was then normalized by dividing the Gaussia luciferase luminescence value by its respective % cell viability as determined above.\n\n10,000 Huh7 cells or primary macrophages were infected with 0.25 TCID50 per cell or 5 TCID50 per cell, respectively for 1 h. Virus inoculum was then removed, cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline, and replaced with culture medium containing compound in a 10-point 3-fold dilution series. At 72 hpi, supernatants were harvested, serially diluted (10-fold) and mixed with 10,000 Vero cells per well in 96 well plates. At day 5 post-infection, plates were fixed with 10% formalin supplemented with 0.2% Triton-X detergent, and stained with primary rabbit anti-EBOV serum, and after several washes the corresponding anti-rabbit Dylight 488 conjugated secondary antibody was added. Plates were assayed for focus forming units, and quantitated by TCID50 assay using the Reed and Muench method23.\n\n10,000 HeLa cells or 5,000 primary HMVEC-L cells were infected with 0.25 TCID50 NiV per cell and 1 TCID50 per cell, respectively for 1 h. Virus inoculum was then removed, cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline, and replaced with culture medium containing compound in a 10-point 3-fold dilution series. At 48 hpi supernatants were harvested, serially diluted, and mixed with 10,000 Vero cells per well in 96-well plates. At day 5 post-infection, plates assayed for CPE, and then viral titers were quantitated by TCID50 assay using the Reed and Muench method23.\n\n10,000 HeLa cells were infected with 0.25 TCID50 virus per cell. Virus inoculum was left in the growth medium containing compound in a 7-point 3-fold dilution series. At 24 hpi supernatants were harvested, serially diluted, and mixed with 10,000 Vero cells per well in 96-well plates. At day 5 post-infection, plates assayed for CPE, and then viral titers were quantitated by TCID50 assay using the Reed and Muench method23.\n\nEC50 values for all infectious virus yield reduction assays were calculated using four-parameter variable slope non-linear regression fitting of mean values derived from quadruplicate or triplicate samples.\n\nTo estimate virus polymerase similarity, we took a hybrid approach that used both structural homology and primary protein sequence information. Distinct ssRNA virus families do not necessarily share a common ancestor in the traditional phylogenetic sense, thus the primary sequence and structure of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) can be quite divergent. We therefore examined all available viral RdRP crystal structures and utilized secondary structure to align the nucleotide binding domains in iterative fashion by removing non-homologous regions. This resulted in a compelling structural alignment for the nucleotide binding domains (Supplementary Figure 12), although the overall structures of RdRPs were quite divergent. This allowed us to determine functionally homologous nucleotide binding residues (motifs A and B)181920. We extracted the primary amino acid sequences (10 residues each) and aligned them by homology to viral RdRPs without known crystal structures using the global-local pairwise alignment in the Biostrings package in R. Grouping of these sequences was determined by calculating a distance matrix followed by hierarchical linkage clustering. The distance matrix was estimated by taking the negative values of Smith-Waterman alignments (gap open penalty of \u22125, extension penalty of \u22121, and match/mismatch values derived from BLOSUM62). Clustering was performed using hclust in R. Results were comparable to those derived from multiple sequence alignments on the extracted regions using MUSCLE32 using default parameters.\n\nCrystal structures examined included the following PDB entries:\n\n4WTA (HCV)\n\n5HMZ (Dengue)\n\n2HCN (West Nile)\n\n5A22 (VSV)\n\n4QPX (Norovirus)\n\n1XR5 (Rhinovirus 14)\n\n1XR6 (Rhinovirus 1B)\n\n1TP7 (Rhinovirus 16)\n\n4K4Y (Coxsackie)\n\n3N6M (EV71)\n\n4K4S (Polio)\n\n1RTD (HIV).\n\nHow to cite this article: Lo, M.
