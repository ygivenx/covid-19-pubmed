{"title": "", "body": "Viruses are obligatory intracel-CHAPTER2 lular parasites and cannot replicate in any cell-free medium, no matter how complex. Some vi-\n\nruses are fastidious about the\n\nfor instance, some known hu-I man viruses have not yet been cultivated under laboratory conditions. Fortunately, however, most viruses can be grown in cultured cells, embryonated eggs, or laboratory animals; indeed, the cultivation of viruses in experimental animals, or better still in cultured cells, is an essential prerequisite for their detailed study.\n\nIn this chapter we shall describe in general terms the ways in which animal viruses are isolated and grown in the laboratory, how they are assayed, how they are purified and, finally, some of the methods used for their biochemical analysis. For technical details about these procedures the reader is referred to several excellent recent textbooks on methodology: Maramorosch and Koprow-. ski (1967) (1968) (1969) (1970) (1971) , Habel and Salzman (1969) , and Lennette and Schmidt (1969) .\n\nAs a preliminary step it will be necessary to describe the ways in which animal cells are cultured, since the major differences between the laboratory procedures used in bacterial, animal, and plant virology depend upon the characteristics of the cells in which the viruses can be grown.\n\nMore than half a century has elapsed since human and animal cells were first grown in vitro. However, it is only since the advent of antibiotics that cell culture has become a routine procedure. Aseptic precautions are still essential, but the problems of contamination with bacteria, mycoplasmas, fungi, and yeasts are no longer insurmountable, and many kinds of animal cells can be cultivated in vitro for at least a few generations (Rose, 1970) . Since 1949, when Enders, Weller, and Robbins reported that poliovirus could be grown in cultured nonneural cells with the production of recognizable histological changes, a large number of animal viruses have been grown in cultured cells, and hundreds of previously unknown viruses have been isolated and identified. The discovery of the adenoviruses, echoviruses, and rhinoviruses, for example, is directly attributable to the use of cultured cells, as is the revolution in the diagnosis of PLATE \n\nsatisfactory for the investigations being conducted, and to make up batches of cells for experimental use from such seed cultures.\n\nSome continuous cell lines have been adapted to grow in suspension culture, i.e., as a suspension of single cells continuously stirred by a spinning magnet. Such \"spinner cultures\" are particularly useful for biochemical studies of viral multiplication and for the commercial production of some vaccines.\n\nFor the molecular biologist, continuous cell lines are obviously preferred for the study of macromolecular processes. Suspension cultures are often used, since they provide a large and uniform population of cells that can be synchronously infected with virus and from which samples can be rapidly processed. The use of large-scale \"roller cultures,\" in which cells are attached as a monolayer in cylindrical bottles which are slowly rotated in a horizontal position, has improved the logistics of growing large quantities of cells that will grow only as monolayers or of viruses that prefer to grow in monolayer cultures.\n\nOf paramount importance is the selection of cell lines that will support the optimal growth of the virus under study. Some viruses will multiply in almost any cell line; some cell lines are favorable for supporting the replication of many different types of viruses. On the other hand, many viruses are quite restricted in the kinds of cell in which they will multiply, although repeated blind passage may lead to adaptation.\n\nCultured cells can serve three main purposes : (a) primary isolation, in which emphasis is placed on high sensitivity and readily recognized cytopathic effects (CPE), (b) vaccine production, where the emphasis is placed on yield, and (c) basic biochemical research for which continuous cell lines, preferably growing as suspension cultures, are usually chosen. The same cells may be used in monolayer cultures for infectivity assays, or sometimes a primary culture will be used for this purpose. Information on the cells used for the cultivation of human pathogens is given in Lennette and Schmidt (1969) , and for all animal viruses in Andrewes and Pereira (1972) . Many research workers have particular cell lines that they favor for the viruses that they are studying; Table 2 -1 lists some of the kinds of cultured cells commonly used for biochemical experiments and plaque assay of model viruses of various genera.\n\nThe growth of many viruses in cell culture can be monitored by a number of biochemical procedures indicative of the intracellular increase in viral macromolecules and virions, as described below (Chapters 5 and 6). In addition, there are cruder methods that are commonly used for diagnostic work, some of which also have an important place in research laboratories.\n\nMany but by no means all viruses kill the cells in which they multiply, so that infected cell monolayers gradually develop histological evidence of cell damage, as newly formed virions spread to involve more and more cells in the culture. These changes are known as cytopathic effects (CPE); the responsible virus is said to be cytopathogenic. Most CPE can be readily observed in unfixed, unstained cell cultures, under low power of the light microscope, with the condenser racked down and the iris diaphragm partly closed to obtain the contrast required in looking at translucent cells. A trained observer can distinguish several types of CPE in living cultures (Plate 2-2 and Table 2 -2), but fixation and staining of the cell monolayer is necessary in order to see details such as inclusion bodies and syncytia. Fluorescent antibody staining, described below, is widely used to recognize viral antigens in such cultured cells.\n\nObservation of CPE is an important tool for the diagnostic virologist, who is concerned with isolating viruses from infected animals or human patients. Some viruses multiply readily in cell culture on primary isolation; the time at which cytopathic changes first become detectable depends to some extent on the number of virions that the specimen contained, but, far more important, on the growth rate of the virus in question. Enteroviruses and herpes simplex virus, for example, which have a short latent period and a high yield, often show detectable CPE after 24 to 48 hours, destroying the monolayer completely within about 3 days. On the other hand, cytomegaloviruses, rubella, and some of the more slowly growing adenoviruses may not produce detectable CPE for several weeks. Since the cell cultures may have undergone nonspecific degeneration during this period it may be necessary to subinoculate the cells and supernatant fluid from the infected culture on to fresh monolayers. CPE often appears soon after such \"blind passage,\" either because this enhances the titer or selects variants adapted to grow better in the cultured cells. PLATE (Shelokov et ah, 1958) , is due to the incorporation into the plasma membrane of newly synthesized viral protein that has an affinity for red blood cells (Plate 2-2D). Hemadsorption can be used to recognize infection with noncytopathogenic viruses, as well as the early stages of infection with cytocidal viruses.\n\nInterference. The multiplication of one virus in a cell often inhibits the multiplication of another virus entering subsequently (Chapter 8). Rubella virus was first discovered by showing that infected monkey kidney cell cultures, showing no CPE, were nevertheless resistant to challenge with an unrelated echovirus (Parkman et ai., 1962) . The phenomenon was also exploited for a time for the isolation of rhinoviruses. Although it is no longer used for either of these viruses, because cell lines have become available in which they produce CPE, interference is a useful technique when searching for new noncytopathogenic viruses and for the assay of nontransforming avian leukosis viruses (see Chapter 14). \n\nPrior to the 1950's, w h e n cell culture really began to make an impact on virology, the standard host for the cultivation of m a n y viruses was the embryonated hen's egg (developing chick embryo). The technique was devised by Goodpasture (Goodpasture et al., 1932) and extensively developed by Burnet over the ensuing years (Beveridge and Burnet, 1946) . Nearly all of the viruses that were k n o w n at that time can be grown in the cells of one or another of the embryonic membranes, namely the amnion, allantois, chorion, or yolk sac ( Fig. 2-1 Davis et al., 1967.) Eggs are inoculated 5-14 days after fertilization, depending on the state of development of the membrane it is proposed to infect. A hole is drilled in the shell, and virus is injected into the fluid bathing the appropriate membrane. Following incubation for a further 2 -5 days, viral growth can be recognized by one or more of the criteria listed in Table 2 Embryonated eggs are rarely employed now for viral isolation, but the allantois produces such high yields of certain viruses, like the influenza viruses and avian adenoviruses, that this system is used both by research laboratories and for vaccine production.\n\nLike embryonated eggs, laboratory animals have almost disappeared now from diagnostic laboratories, since cell cultures are so much simpler to handle and much more versatile, although suckling mice are still used in the isolation of some coxsackieviruses and in many arbovirus laboratories.\n\nHowever, laboratory animals are still essential for many kinds of virological research. Primates are used to study a few human viruses, like the kuru agent and hepatitis viruses, that will not grow in other laboratory animals or in cultured cells. Hamsters are widely used in tumor virology, because they are highly susceptible to tumor production by oncogenic viruses and then yield valuable antisera. Experiments on pathogenic mechanisms and the role of the immune response can only be carried out with suitable laboratory animals, usually primates, hamsters, rabbits or mice. Finally, since serology looms large in much virological research, laboratory animals, usually rabbits, are extensively used for producing antisera. BlaSkovic and Styk (1967) have reviewed methods employed for studying viruses in laboratory animals.\n\nAll scientific research depends upon reliable methods of measurement, and with viruses the property we are most obviously concerned with measuring is infectivity. The content of infectious viruses in a given suspension can be \"titrated\" by infecting cell cultures, chick embryos, or laboratory animals with dilutions of viral suspensions and then watching over the next few days for evidence of viral multiplication. Two types of infectivity assay should be distinguished: quantitative and quantal.\n\nA familiar example of this type of assay is the bacterial colony count on an agar plate. Each viable organism multiplies to produce a discrete clone; the colony count therefore represents a direct estimate of the number of organisms originally plated. The parallel systems in virology are the counting of pocks on the chorion of the chick embryo or plaques on monolayers of cultured cells.\n\nPlaque Assays. Dulbecco (1952; Dulbecco and Vogt, 1954) introduced to animal virology a modification of the bacteriophage plaque assay that is now used very widely for the quantitation of animal viruses. A viral suspension is added to a monolayer of cultured cells for an hour or so to allow the virions to attach to the cells, then the liquid medium is replaced with a solid gel, which ensures that the spread of progeny particles is restricted to the immediate vicinity of the originally infected cell. Hence, each infective particle gives rise to a localized focus of infected cells that becomes, after a few days, large enough to see with the naked eye (Plate 2-3). (From Kilbourne, 1969; courtesy Or. E.D. Kilbourne.) Various materials have been used to form the gel with which the cell monolayer is overlaid shortly after inoculation. They include agar, methylcellulose, tragacanth, and starch gel. Agar has been most commonly employed, but suffers from the disadvantage that it contains sulfated polysaccharides that inhibit the growth of some viruses; however, this inhibitory substance can be neutralized by the addition of DEAE-dextran to the agar. Of course, the gel must also incorporate the usual nutrient medium required to maintain the cells in a viable condition.\n\nAfter an incubation period of 2 days to 4 weeks, depending on the virus under study, the cell monolayers are stained with a vital dye, such as neutral red or tetrazolium. The living cells absorb the stain and the plaques appear as clear areas against a red background. Noncytocidal viruses can be titrated in a similar fashion, plaques being recognized by such techniques as hemadsorption, interference, or fluorescent antibody staining. Some viruses, e.g., herpesviruses and poxviruses, will produce plaques even in cell monolayers grown in liquid medium, because most of the newly formed virus remains cell-associated, so that plaques form by direct spread to adjacent cells through intercellular bridges.\n\nThere are a number of technical variations of Dulbecco's plaquing method (Cooper, 1967) . For instance, virus may be allowed to attach to cells in suspension. The cells can then be permitted either to adhere to the glass and be overlaid with agar medium, or, alternatively, the cell suspension with virus attached may be embedded in agar medium directly. The latter method is suited only to viruses small enough to diffuse from cell to cell through the agar; the plaque that eventually results is then spherical.\n\nOrdinarily, infection with a single virus particle is sufficient to form a plaque (Dulbecco and Vogt, 1954) , so that the infectivity titer of the original viral suspension can be expressed in terms of \"plaque-forming units\" (pfu) per milliliter. The error will be minimal if the titer is determined from plates inoculated with a dilution of virus producing about 20 to 100 plaques per plate, depending on plaque size-enough to minimize errors attributable to the Poisson distribution (which governs the distribution of very small numbers of discrete particles), while avoiding overlap of adjacent plaques.\n\nAssays. An important modification of the plaque assay is the infectious center count. Suspensions of cells that have been infected with virus are plated on a preformed cell monolayer during the latent period, before new virions are produced, and the monolayer is overlaid carefully with agar. The number of plaques that appear is a measure of the number of cells originally infected, so that it is a matter of simple calculation to determine the proportion of infected cells in the culture being assayed. The number of infected cells in a suspension or monolayer culture can also be assayed a few hours after inoculation of the culture by counting microscopically the cells that are positive for immunofluorescence, or in suitable cases, for hemadsorption (White et ah, 1962) .\n\nTransformation Assays. Methods other than the plaque assay have been devised to quantitate the infectivity of those viruses that do not cause cell death. We have already referred to the use of hemadsorption or interference to assay some noncytocidal viruses; in addition, there are some oncogenic viruses that interact with some cultured cells in a cytocidal fashion, but \"transform\" other types of cell. Such cells are not killed, but their social behavior is changed so that they take on many of the properties of malignant cells. Compared with non-in an unrestrained fashion to produce a heaped-up \"microtumor\" that stands out conspicuously against the background of normal cells in the monolayer (review, Stoker and Macpherson, 1967) . Like malignant cells excised from a tumor, the transformed cells also assume the ability to grow in sloppy suspension of agar or methocel (review by Macpherson, 1969) . For certain oncogenic viruses like Rous sarcoma virus, transformation is the basic method for assaying viral infectivity (see review by Vogt, 1969a) ; for others, such as, the DNA tumor viruses, transformation is a relatively inefficient process and these viruses are usually assayed by conventional procedures.\n\nPock Assays. A much older assay, still occasionally used for the poxviruses, is the titration of viruses on the chorion of the chick embryo. Newly synthesized virus escaping from infected cells spreads mainly to adjacent cells, so that each infecting particle eventually gives rise to a localized lesion, known as a \"pock/' The nature of the pock is often highly characteristic of a particular group of viruses or even a particular mutant (Gemmell and Fenner, 1960) .\n\nThe second type of infectivity assay is not quantitative but quantal, i.e., it does not register the number of infectious virus particles in the inoculum, but only whether there are any at all. Being an all-or-none assay, it is not nearly as precise as a quantitative assay; accordingly, it is only used for viruses that do not form plaques. Serial dilutions of virus are inoculated into several replicate cell cultures, eggs, or animals. Adequate time is allowed for virus to multiply and spread to destroy the whole cell culture, or kill the animal, as the case may be. Hence, each host yields only a single piece of information, namely, whether or not it was infected by that particular dilution of virus. A more economical procedure can be used with viruses such as vaccinia that produce localized skin lesions in an animal like the rabbit. Twenty or thirty skin sites can be separately inoculated, each giving an all-or-none answer equivalent to the death or survival of a cell culture or a mouse. A good example of an accurate quantal assay is the titration of influenza viral infectivity in squares of allantois-on-shell maintained in vitro in plastic trays, the test being read by hemagglutination (Fazekas de St. Groth and White, 1958) .\n\nConsiderations. Isaacs (1957) reviewed the results of infectivity titrations of a number of animal viruses, compared with particle counts carried out with the electron microscope. With most viruses one particle is sufficient to initiate infection (\"one-hit kinetics\"). The evidence for this is the Poissonian distribution of \"takes\" (infected mice or eggs, lesions in rabbit skin, etc.) when closely spaced dilutions near the end point are tested, or more conveniently the linear relationship between dose and plaque count (review: Dougherty, 1964) . However, a number of situations have now been recognized in which the infectivity assay (usually a plaque count) follows two-hit rather than one-hit kinetics indicating that two different types of virus particle must \n\n10 \"4 5 10 ~5\n\n\u03b9\u03bf-1 0 -6 Boey\u00e9 et al., 1966.) infect a single cell in order that one of them (or occasionally both) may replicate. The adenovirus-associated viruses, some of the SV40-adenovirus hybrids, and the murine sarcoma viruses (Hartley and Rowe, 1966) cannot multiply except in cells coinfected with a \" h e l p e r \" virus (review b y Rowe, 1967). Assays of such defective viruses provide examples of two-hit kinetics .\n\nThe results of typical quantal and quantitative infectivity titrations are given in Table 2 -4 . It will be seen that at high dilutions of the inoculum all the hosts C 50, 42, 54, 59, 45 5, 7 , 3, 6, 4 0, 0, 1, 0, 1 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 QUANTAL ASSAY (CPE) + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + -+ + + + + + + -+ + -+ -+ -+ _ \u03bc _ remained uninfected, because they failed to receive even a single infectious unit. The \"endpoint\" of a quantal titration is taken to be that dilution of virus which infects 50% of the inoculated hosts; the infectivity titer of the original virus suspension is then expressed in terms of \"50% infectious doses\" (ID 5 o) per milliliter. At first sight, it may be thought that Table 2 -4 shows some anomalous results, in that some hosts have become infected following inoculation with higher dilutions of virus than those that failed to infect others. This sort of finding is quite normal and explicable in terms of the Poisson distribution. At any given multiplicity (m) of virus there is a finite probability (e~m) that a given aliquot of the inoculum will contain no virus particle. In the example shown, each 0.1 ml sample of the 1 0 -5 dilution contained an average of one ID50, i.e., 0.5 of an infectious unit. Hence, each 0.1 ml sample of the 10~6 dilution contained an average of 0.05 infectious units, i.e., about one host in twenty received one infectious particle; whereas, each 0.1 ml sample of the 10~4 dilution contained an average of five infectious units, i.e., e~5 (about one in a hundred) of these hosts failed to receive an infectious particle at all. In practice, quantal assays rarely produce such a nicely balanced result as the example presented in Table 2 -4, and statistical procedures must be used to calculate the endpoint of the titration.\n\nEfficiency of Plating. In their pioneering quantitative studies of the multiplication of bacterial viruses, Ellis and Delbriick (1939) introduced the term efficiency of plating (EOP) to give a numerical value to the plaque count obtained with the same phage preparation using different susceptible bacteria as host organisms. The absolute EOP is defined as the plaque count relative to the total number of viral particles in the sample. Luria et al. (1951) , using electron microscopic counts, showed that the absolute EOP of the T-even phages could approach unity. In animal virus systems, the absolute EOP is always low and often very low, ranging from 1 0 -1 to 1 0 -6 . In other words, depending on the virus-cell combination under study, the proportion of virus particles in the suspension that score as infectious ranges from an upper limit of about 10 to as low as 0.0001%. This constitutes a major difference between bacteriophage and animal virus systems and has been a major cause of difficulty in animal virus genetics. Several factors contribute to the low plating efficiency of animal viruses. A certain proportion of the virions in any given suspension are noninfectious; most of these were once infectious but have been inactivated during growth or preparation, others are genetically defective in that they lack a complete genome or are completely \"empty\" (see Chapter 3). However, the major contribution to low EOP comes from the low susceptibility (i.e., high resistance) of the assay systems available, and a great deal of effort has been devoted to improving the efficiency of certain model systems so that genetic and biochemical studies can be performed.\n\nA further complication is that at least some of the noninfectious particles can contribute to the yield, when they occur in cells in which an infectious particle is also multiplying. In experiments with two serotypes of poliovirus, for example, Ledinko and Hirst (1961) found that the number of doubly neutralizable poliovirions produced, the number of doubly infected cells, and the number of cells producing phenotypically mixed virus all exceeded theoretical expectations based on the infective virus input. Similarly, using phenotypic mixing of Newcastle disease virus as an index of mixedly infected cells, Granoff (1961) obtained evidence which suggested that the majority of virions that were nonplaque producers contributed something to the yield from doubly infected cells, which yielded phenotypically mixed virus and both parental genotypes.\n\nInfectious nucleic acids can be extracted from a number of different viruses ( Table 2 -5; review, Pagano, 1970) . Positive results are regularly obtained only with viruses whose genomes consist of a single molecule of nucleic acid and whose virions do not contain a transcriptase. Infectious DNA. Most work on infectious viral DNA has been carried out with polyoma virus, which on extraction yields three different forms of DNA molecule (see Chapter 3). These are a closed circle double-stranded supercoiled form (sedimentation coefficient in neutral conditions, 20 S), a relaxed form (sedimentation coefficient, 16 S) resulting from at least one scission in one of the strands, and linear double-stranded molecules of varying length, which may result from double-stranded breakage of the viral nucleic acid or may be cellular DNA from pseudovirions (Winocour, 1969) . Both the 20 and 16 S molecules are infectious. In some cases, extracted DNA can elicit other biological effects such as cell transformation, tumor formation in animals, or induction of new antigens. For example, Bourgaux et ai. (1965) demonstrated transforming activity with polyoma virus DNA, the supercoiled double-helical form being at least ten times more efficient in transforming capacity than any other form.\n\nFor isolated viral DNA to be infectious, it is clear that one or other of the cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (see Chapter 4) is able to transcribe the incoming viral DNA. It is not known why it has proved so difficult to demonstrate infectious DNA from human herpesviruses and adenoviruses. Possible explanations include the following: (a) difficulty in preparing nonfragmented DNA, an unlikely explanation with adenoviruses, (b) a topological requirement-uncoating may have to occur at a specific cellular site, (c) an internal viral protein associated with the DNA may perhaps serve to modify transcriptional patterns, and (d) these viruses may contain undetected polymerases. An unusual example of what is apparently an infectious DNA has been reported with an avian leukovirus. Certain strains of Rous sarcoma virus transform hamster cells but yield no virions, whereas transformed chick cells yield infectious particles (see Chapter 14). Hill and Hillova (1972) used a genetically marked mutant (temperature-sensitive and of unusual antigenicity) to transform hamster cells. DNA extracted from these, in turn, transformed chick cells which produced infectious particles having the same phenotype as the mutant of Rous sarcoma virus originally used.\n\nFor isolated viral RNA to be infectious the essential requirements seem to be that the genome is a single piece of nucleic acid and that the viral RNA can itself act as messenger RNA. These conditions are fulfilled by viruses of two large families, Picornaviridae and Togaviridae.\n\nExtensive investigations on the optimum conditions for the assay of infectious RNA have been carried out with poliovirus RNA, which is a linear molecule with a molecular weight of 2.6 million daltons. In one effective assay system (Koch and Bishop, 1968) , suspended cells are exposed to the viral nucleic acid and then plated on a monolayer of indicator cells for an infectious center assay. The suspended cells may be sensitized by exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide or polycations such as DEAE-dextran, which may augment infectivity as much as 10,000-fold (Vaheri and Pagano, 1965) . Both the single and double-stranded forms (see Chapter 6) of poliovirus RNA are infectious. Indeed, in the presence of polycations, the double-stranded RNA has a higher specific infectivity than single-stranded viral RNA, probably because it is resistant to cellular ribonucleases.\n\nInefficient as are assays for infectivity of poliovirus, the infectivity levels obtained with free viral RNA are usually several orders of magnitude lower, even though most of the infecting RNA seems to enter the cells, as judged by conversion from an RNase-sensitive to a RNase-resistant state after adsorption.\n\nSignificance of Infectious Viral Nucleic Acids. The demonstration that some viral nucleic acids are infectious is of considerable theoretical and practical importance. More clearly than any other observation, it showed that the viral genome was the repository of all viral genetic information. In the laboratory, it has extended the host range of viruses; for example, poliovirus RNA will infect many cells and animals that are resistant to infection with poliovirions due to the absence of cellular receptors for the viral capsid (see Chapters 6 and 11). This demonstrates clearly that such \"resistant\" cells are in fact capable of supporting viral growth if a mechanism can be found for facilitating the entry of undegraded viral RNA into the cell. With a few viruses, notably SV40, the use of infectious DNA has been of great assistance in dissection of the functions of the genome. Persistent failure to demonstrate infectivity of the nucleic acids of some viruses led to the successful search for polymerases in their virions. Finally, infectious viral nucleic acids provide a convenient model for studying the more general problem of introducing functional nucleic acids into vertebrate cells. Although early attempts at mammalian gene transfer by isolated DNA (Szybalska and Szybalski, 1962) have not been repeated, the range of such possibilities was dramatically broadened by the claim that a metabolic lesion in a mammalian cell could be repaired by introducing the necessary gene via the DNA of a transducing bacteriophage (Merril et ah, 1971) .\n\nMany viruses contain in their outer coat virus-coded proteins capable of binding to erythrocytes ( Table 2 -6; reviews, Rosen, 1964 reviews, Rosen, , 1969 . Such viruses can, therefore, bridge red blood cells to form a lattice. The phenomenon, known as hemagglutination, was first described by Hirst (1941) , who then went on to analyze the mechanism of hemagglutination by influenza virus. In this case, the hemagglutinating protein (hemagglutinin) on the virion is a glycoprotein, which occurs in the form of many short projections (see Plate 3-15). The virus will attach to any species of erythrocyte carrying complementary receptors, which are glycoproteins of a different sort. Hemagglutination by influenza and the paramyxoviruses, but not other viruses, is complicated by the fact that the virion also carries an enzyme, neuraminidase, which destroys the glycoprotein receptors on the erythrocyte surface and allows the virus to elute, unless the test is carried out at a temperature too low for the enzyme to act (4\u00b0C). About 10 7 influenza virions are required to cause macroscopic agglutination of a convenient number of chick erythrocytes (conventionally 0.25 ml of a 1% suspension of red cells). Thus hemagglutination is not a sensitive indicator of the presence of small numbers of virions, but because of its simplicity it provides a very convenient assay if large amounts of virus are available. The viral suspension is diluted serially (usually in twofold steps) in a plastic tray using a calibrated wire loop, and erythrocytes are added to each well. Unclumped red blood cells settle to form a \"button/ 7 whereas agglutinated cells form a \"shield\" (Plate 2-4).\n\nNegative staining is such a simple technique that with many viruses the number of particles in relatively crude suspensions can be counted directly in PLATE antibody, the second injection provided a useful booster response. (Courtesy I. lack.) the electron microscope. The virus can be mixed with a known concentration of latex particles to provide an easily recognizable marker (Luria et a\\. f 1951) . Alternatively, the virions contained in a known volume can be sedimented in an ultracentrifuge directly onto an electron microscope grid (Sharp, 1965) .\n\nIf a given preparation of virus particles were to be assayed by all of the methods described above, the \"titer\" would be different in every case. For example, an influenza virus suspension may provide the following data (tabulated below) : There are clearly great differences in the sensitivity of different methods of assay. Relative to an absolute standard (1), the EOPs are 1 0 _ 1 (2), 10~2 (3), and 10\" 7 (4).\n\nThe expansion of our knowledge of the biology of animal viruses has occurred largely as a consequence of three new found technical skills: first, the ability to grow many types of animal cells in vitro has enabled us to produce in turn large quantities of many animal viruses; second, the development of physical methods of separation of macromolecules has given us the skill to purify to homogeneity large quantities of many sorts of viruses and their various constituent molecules; third, the availability of radioactive precursor compounds of high specific activity has allowed us to follow in detail many of the biochemical events that occur both in uninfected and in virus-infected cells. It is the marriage of these three disparate advances that has made many of the techniques, which were esoteric or impossible a few years ago, no more than matters of routine manipulation today.\n\nA few animal viruses can be purified by taking advantage of certain characteristic properties of their virions. For example, influenza viruses can be concentrated and purified by adsorbing the virus on to red blood cells at 4\u00b0C. The cells are then washed free of impurities and the temperature is raised to 37\u00b0C. The enzyme neuraminidase, which is an integral part of the virions, begins to act and destroys the viral receptors on the red blood cells so that the viral particles are released. The red cells are then removed by low-speed centrifugation (Ada and Perry, 1954). However, for most animal viruses no such convenient short cuts are available, and purified suspensions are obtained by the sequential application of different fractionation techniques. Because the customary starting materials are large volumes of medium, infected cells or body fluids, containing small numbers of virions, the first step of purification often involves concentrating the viral particles by salting out with ammonium sulfate, precipitation with polyethylene glycol or ethanol, or adsorption onto, and elution from, ionexchange resins. The host components that are different in size from the particular virus under study are usually separated by differential centrifugation; low-speed centrifugation deposits large pieces of cell debris and subsequently high-speed centrifugation is used to pellet the virus.\n\nFurther purification is usually achieved by rate zonal centrifugation through preformed density gradients ( Fig. 2-3 ; review by Mazzone, 1967) . The solutes most commonly used in such gradients are buffered sucrose and glycerol, although for those viruses that are unaffected by solutions of high ionic strength, salts such as potassium bromide and tartrate are also satisfactory. The gradients are formed directly in the centrifuge tubes by mixing together solutions of different solute concentrations in such a way that there is a continuous linear gradation of density from the top to the bottom of the final column of liquid. The sample of virus is layered onto the gradient and during centrifugation sediments as a band through the gradient at a rate (sedimentation coefficient, S) which is determined by the size and weight of the viral particles, and which can be predicted by classic centrifugation theory. The centrifugation is usually stopped when the band of virus has traveled onehalf to two-thirds the length of the gradient, and samples are collected by piercing a hole through the bottom of the centrifuge tubes, or pumping a dense solute through the bottom of the tube and monitoring the effluent as it passes from the top. The viral band is located optically (with a spectrophotometer) or by radioactivity. virions are suspended in solutions, usually of alkali metal chlorides such as cesium chloride, which have high density and low viscosity. During high-speed centrifugation, the metal ions form a stable density gradient whose steepness is a reflection of the balance that is established between the tendency of the heavy metal ions to sediment through the solvent and their back-diffusion rate from more to less concentrated areas. Once the gradient is established the viral particles migrate to a position in the centrifuge tube where their density and that of the supporting medium are equal. When equilibrium is reached, the centrifuge is stopped, the bands of virus are collected, and the solute removed by dialysis or by passage through Sephadex columns.\n\nThere are no absolute criteria of purity for viral preparations. Minimally one would require that the particles are homogeneous by electron microscopic examination, that further purification steps fail to remove any more components from the preparation without reducing the infectivity of the particles, and that when radioactively labeled uninfected cells are subjected to the same purification procedure no host components are found which will copurify with the viral particles. Although these criteria have been fulfilled for many types of viruses (e.g., polyoma viruses, adenoviruses, picornaviruses), there are others (e.g., RNA tumor viruses and coronaviruses) which have the same size and density as components of uninfected cells (Anderson et ed., 1966) . Despite many attempts these viruses have not been purified successfully and further progress on their chemistry will require the development of new purification techniques or the refinement of those already in existence.\n\nMost of our knowledge of the biosynthetic events produced by infection has to be gained by using radioactive tracers. Radioactively labeled molecules enter all the intracellular pools and are used metabolically in exactly the same way as unlabeled molecules, but because they are radioactive their pathways and fates within the cell can be followed very easily. However, it should be borne in mind that we still know little about the intracellular compartmentalization of pools of metabolites.\n\nThe radioisotopes that are most commonly used in animal virology are 3 H, 14 C, 32 P, 35 S, and 125 I or 131 I, and they are usually monitored by scintillation spectroscopy. For most experimental purposes isotopes are not added to cells as free atoms but rather in precursor compounds that are used in the synthesis of specific cellular components. For example, labeled amino acids are used to follow protein synthesis, uridine for RNA, thymidine for DNA, glucosamine for glycoprotein, and choline for lipid synthesis. By using a mixture of precursors labeled with, for instance, 3 H and 14 C, it is possible to follow two metabolic pathways at once (double-labeling experiments).\n\nThe choice of precursor and its specific activity depends on the purpose of the experiment. When isotopic uridine is used as an RNA precursor, it is largely incorporated into RNA. However, it may also be converted to dUMP and dCMP and thus appear in DNA. To avoid this, [5-3 H] uridine should be employed since the conversion from dUMP to dTMP by reductive methylation at the 5 position eliminates the tritium. Thymidine is a specific precursor of DNA and by blocking the endogenous synthesis of dTMP with fluorodeoxyuridine (see Fig. 4-4) , exogenous thymidine is incorporated into the DNA of most cells at an enhanced rate.\n\nIn general, care should be taken that changes in the rate of precursor uptake or incorporation are not merely a reflection of a change in the intracellular pool size rather than a change in the rate of macromolecular synthesis. Further, the level and activity of the exogenous isotope should not be rate limiting. With high specific activities of some precursors, in particular tritiated thymidine, cell functions may be damaged by irradiation effects. Provided attention is paid to these points, radioactive isotopes are very powerful tools which allow precise analysis of the effects of animal viruses on cells. They also allow us to prepare radioactive virus, a fact which has not only made possible much of the detailed analysis of the composition and architecture of the particles which is described in Chapter 3, but by allowing the application of microtechniques has relieved many scientists of much drudgery.\n\nSeveral different electron microscopic techniques are routinely used to study the morphology of virus particles and their multiplication in infected cells. Negative staining, introduced into virology by Brenner and Home (1959) , has proved a very powerful method for revealing details of viral architecture (review, Home, 1967) . At neutral pH, phosphotungstic acid does not combine readily with proteins or nucleic acids, but after drying it forms a relatively uniform electron-opaque background in which small objects such as virions stand out in detail. Because the phosphotungstate enters interstices between adjacent macromolecules, this method, when used at high magnification, reveals fine details of viral structure (see Chapter 3).\n\nThin sectioning of viral pellets or more commonly of infected cells also reveals important information about viral structure and morphogenesis (review, Morgan and Rose, 1967) . In order to locate specific viral proteins either within particles or in infected cells, auxiliary techniques are used, such as autoradiography (review by Granboulan, 1967) , treatment of the thin sections with ferritin-labeled antibody (review, Breese and Hsu, 1971) , or antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase (review, Kurstak, 1971) .\n\nFinally Kleinschmidt's method (Kleinschmidt, 1968) of spreading nucleic acids and photographing the extended molecules after metal shadowing or better by dark field illumination is used increasingly for the study of viral nucleic acids. With double-stranded DNA molecules, a length of 1 ^m corresponds to a molecular weight of about 2 million. A more recent extension of this technique is the direct visualization of DNA heteroduplexes to determine the degree of homology between the nucleic acids of related viruses (review by Davis et al, 1971) .\n\nNucleic acid hybridization (reannealing) is the interaction of single-stranded polynucleotide chains with complementary base sequences to form doublestranded structures. Depending on the initial reagents, the products of the reaction can be RNA:RNA, RNA:DNA, or DNA:DNA duplexes, each of which can be measured by a variety of methods. There are several excellent reviews of the most commonly used experimental techniques (Raskas and Green, 1971; B0vre et a\\., 1971; Gillespie, 1968; Kohne and Britten, 1971 ) and this short section will do nothing more than describe two basic methods and examples of their use in animal virology.\n\nPreparations of double-stranded nucleic acid are denatured by heating or alkali treatment and incubated under conditions which promote reannealing of the polynucleotide strands (neutral pH, 25\u00b0C below the T m ). Because reassociation of the polynucleotide strands is a bimolecular reaction, the kinetics of reannealing are second order, and the rate of the reaction depends on the concentration of the nucleic acid, its size, its complexity, and the salt concentration in the solution (Wetmur and Davidson, 1968; Britten and Kohne, 1968) . The formation of native nucleic acid can be assayed by hydroxylapatite chromatography or by the use of nucleases which differentiate single-and double-stranded nucleic acids. A good example of the use of liquid hybridization in animal virology is the determination of the number of copies of viral DNA in transformed cells (see review by Gelb and Martin, 1971) . Small amounts of highly radioactive viral DNA are allowed to reanneal in the presence of large amounts of DNA either from virus-transformed or from control cells. Because the rate of reannealing of the radioactive viral DNA is proportional to its concentration in the solution, hybridization occurs faster in the presence of DNA from transformed cells than in the presence of control cell DNA's. By following the kinetics of the annealing of the radioactive DNA it is possible to determine directly the number of viral copies in DNA extracted from transformed cells (see Chapter 13).\n\nDNA is first denatured and immobilized on nitro-cellulose filters, which are immersed in solutions of radioactive nucleic acid under conditions which favor hybridization. If the solution contains any labeled nucleic acid sequences which are complementary in base sequence to the DNA immobilized on the filter, then reannealing will occur. The extent of the reaction can be determined by measuring the amount of radioactivity specifically absorbed to the filters. This basic method has been used to detect the synthesis of virus-specific RNA in infected cells. However, many other uses have been described and many variations of the technique are available, for example, competition hybridization, in which filters containing immobilized DNA are reacted first with an excess of unlabeled RNA and then with smaller amounts of radioactive RNA. If the unlabeled RNA contains sequences which completely overlap those of the radioactive RNA then no label will adsorb to the filter because all the available sites on the DNA will have been saturated. If the sequences of the two RNA's are different then hybridization of the labeled RNA will occur. By using experiments of this sort it has been possible to determine which particular segments of viral genomes are transcribed into RNA at different times after infection. Clearly hybridization of nucleic acids is a powerful technique, and because of its simplicity and sensitivity, it has become an essential tool for the study of nucleic acid metabolism in virus-infected and transformed cells.\n\nSuppose that we have isolated a new virus and have managed to produce a suspension of purified particles. How can we classify the virus, and how do we find out about its chemical composition? A lead may be provided by its past history-the species of animal from which it was isolated and whether or not it was related to a disease. This information, in conjunction with that obtained by electron microscopic examination of stained, unstained, and sectioned particles, might be enough for us to make a preliminary identification. However, we may want to know more about the physical and chemical properties of the virus, as well as the nature and size of its genome. In most cases, this information can be obtained quite easily by applying tests of the following types.\n\nThe most commonly used method for measuring the size of virus particles is electron microscopy, using catalase crystals as calibration standards. The method is extremely rapid and simple and tells us not only about the size of the virions but also something of their shape and symmetry, with the minor reservation that the virus particles may undergo distortion during the fixation and staining processes. Independent methods for determining the diameter of the virion include filtration through membranes of known pore size, determination of sedimentation, and/or diffusion coefficients or light scattering.\n\nWhether the virus contains DNA or RNA as its genetic material can best be determined by performing direct sugar analysis on the isolated nucleic acid, which is extracted from the virus with hot or cold phenol. However, several other tests are almost as good and much simpler, and are more sensitive when only small quantities of virus are available. For instance, if the virus is grown in the presence of [ 14 C]thymidine and [ 3 H]uridine, the isolated nucleic acid will contain only 14 C counts if it is DNA and only 3 H counts if it is RNA.\n\nWhether the nucleic acid is single-or double-stranded can be determined by several physicochemical techniques, such as determination of the buoyant density, base analysis, and melting characteristics. However, the easiest method is probably by treatment of the nucleic acid with nucleases that are known to be specific for different types of nucleic acids. A serious caveat is that certain types of virus are known to exist (e.g., adenovirus-associated viruses) whose particles contain single strands of DNA but some of the particles contain one strand of DNA and others its complement. During extraction the isolated strands reanneal to form a double-stranded DNA duplex. With the adenovirus-associated viruses the state of the nucleic acid within the particles was determined by examining in the fluorescence microscope unfixed particles stained with acridine orange (see Chapter 3). Acridine orange binds to the nucleic acid within the particles and, when exposed to UV light, fluoresces green if the nucleic acid is double-stranded and orange if it is single-stranded.\n\nFinally, an unreliable method that was used widely in the past was to determine whether 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) depressed the yield of virus from infected cells. BUdR is a base analog of thymidine and, when it is incorporated into DNA in the place of the normal base, causes the DNA to be inactive. Hence, it was argued that if growth in BUdR depressed the yield of a virus, then the virus must contain DNA as its genetic material. It is now known that some types of RNA viruses (notably the RNA tumor viruses) require DNA synthesis soon after infection if they are to replicate, so that by the BUdR test these viruses score as DNA viruses.\n\nThe size of the molecule (s) of nucleic acid that makes up the viral genome can be determined in a number of ways. If the virus contains single-or doublestranded DNA, centrifugation methods are useful (reviews by Bauer and Vinograd, 1971; Szybalski and Szybalska, 1971 ), but the method of choice at present is to examine the nucleic acid directly in the electron microscope by Kleinschmidt's technique (review, Kleinschmidt, 1968) . For double-stranded DNA, a length of 1 /xm is equivalent to approximately 2 million daltons of nucleic acid. This method also tells us something about the topology of the DNA, for example, whether it is circular or linear, and if circular, whether it is superhelical or not.\n\nFor viruses containing RNA, the problem is rather more difficult. In many RNA preparations, there are severe problems of aggregation of molecules, on the one hand, and degradation due to nuclease action on the other; and there are no reliable methods of determining the length of RNA molecules by electron microscopy. However, there are excellent techniques for determination of molecular weights of RNA by electrophoresis through sieves of polyacrylamide or agarose (reviews by Adesnik, 1971; Dingman and Peacock, 1971) or by sedimentation in denaturing solvents such as 99% dimethyl sulfoxide (Strauss et al., 1968b) . As long as adequate numbers of calibration markers are used, these methods are very accurate and reliable.\n\nOnce the molecular weight of the nucleic acid molecules extracted from the virus has been determined, it is necessary to decide how many of each class are present in each virus particle. Enough chemical data have accumulated to show that each virus particle of adenoviruses, polyoma viruses, poxviruses, herpesviruses, and picornaviruses contains only one molecule of nucleic acid, but with some of the RNA viruses, it is more difficult to be so certain. For instance, the genomes of reoviruses, leukoviruses, and influenza virus contain more than one piece of RNA (Chapter 3). However, we cannot say with assurance exactly how many pieces of RNA constitute the genome. In the absence of complete genetic maps, the only way to determine the composition of the genome of these particles is to try to fit together different combinations of RNA so that they add up to the amount of RNA that is found by chemical analyses of purified particles. In many cases this remains more a matter of guesswork than science.\n\nInformation about the size and subunit composition of the proteins that are present in viruses is most commonly determined by electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gels (review, Maizel, 1971) . In this method, acrylamide is polymerized to form cylinders or slabs, and the mixture of proteins under investigation is added to the top of the gel. When an electric current is applied across the ends of the gel, the proteins in the mixture migrate through it as bands at speeds which are governed, on the one hand, by the net charge of the protein molecules in the buffer conditions used, and, on the other hand, by the pore size of the gel. The smaller protein molecules pass through the pores formed by the polyacrylamide cross-links more easily than the larger proteins, and so they migrate faster. By adjusting the acrylamide concentrations within the range 5-15%, gels with pore sizes suitable for the separation of protein molecules with a wide spectrum of molecular weights can easily be generated. The position of the protein bands is determined either by staining the fixed gel with dyes like Coomassie Brilliant Blue, or by autoradiography, or by cutting it into small segments and counting the amount of radioactivity in each fraction.\n\nTwo sets of conditions can be used for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (a) Denaturing conditions. Before being placed on the gel the proteins are dissociated into their constituent polypeptide chains. The most commonly used conditions are heating to 80\u00b0C for a few minutes in the presence of reducing agents such as dithiothreitol or \u00df-mercaptoethanol, and the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The detergent binds to the separated polypeptide chains and gives all of them an overall net negative charge. The polypeptides separate in the gel entirely on the basis of their size; all charge differences are eliminated. Given that certain precautions are taken, the method gives a catalog of all the polypeptides present in a particular viral preparation, and as long as the polypeptides are not derived from glycoproteins, which behave anomalously in the system, the method gives extremely accurate estimates of the molecular weights of the polypeptides under study, (b) Nondenaturing conditions. These are sometimes used in order to keep the proteins in a native state, so that the separation in the gels is not of constituent polypeptides but rather of entire proteins. Since the migration of proteins without bound SDS is a function not only of their size but also of their overall charge, the buffers are tailored to match the characteristics of the particular protein under study.\n\nIn several cases, it has been possible to assign particular viral polypeptides to morphological subunits of viral particles. The details of the methods used vary from virus to virus, but the principle remains the same-the viral particles are gently disrupted into their morphological subunits, usually by treatment with detergents or dilute alkali, and the subunits are then separated from one another by immunoprecipitation, sedimentation velocity or isopycnic gradient centrifugation. It is then a simple matter to dissociate the subunits into their constituent polypeptide chains by heating in sodium dodecyl sulfate and \u00df-mercaptoethanol, and to determine by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the precise composition of the morphological subunit in terms of the number of each species of constituent polypeptide and how they are bound together. The method cannot be applied universally, since it depends on successful disruption and separation of morphologically identifiable subunits, but at its best [see, for example, Rueckert's (1971) work with EMC (Chapter 3)] the technique provides an elegant and satisfying correlation between chemical and morphological subunits.\n\nIn those viruses where assignment of polypeptides to subunits is incomplete or impossible, the position of individual polypeptides in the particles can often be mapped by techniques such as radioactive labeling of the external proteins of the virion by iodination with 125 I and lactoperoxidase (Stanley and Haslam, 1971) or with ferritin or horse radish peroxidase antibody labeling and autoradiography.\n\nAll viruses contain nucleic acid and protein and many contain nothing else, except for the ribose or deoxyribose associated with their nucleic acid. Others also contain lipids and carbohydrate. Except for the poxviruses, which are in an exceptional position, this lipid and carbohydrate is located in a viral envelope (see Chapters 1 and 3) that surrounds the genome and its associated proteinssuch viruses are said to be enveloped. Whether or not a virus is enveloped is most easily and unambiguously determined by electron microscopic examination. Less direct methods that have been used in the past include determination of the sensitivity of the virus to lipid solvents such as ether or sodium deoxycholate and radioactive labeling with sugars such as fucose or glucosamine which are incorporated preferentially into membrane glycoproteins.\n\nNeuraminidase was recognized as an integral component of the envelope of myxoviruses many years ago (review, Drzeniek, 1972 ). An even more important discovery was the demonstration that many viruses contain nucleic acid polymerases (review, Baltimore, 1971b). Three types of polymerases have been found associated with viruses of different groups: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. All of them can be readily assayed by mixing viral particles with suitable labeled precursors and following conversion into nucleic acid. In a few cases, whole viral particles can be assayed directly, but usually it is necessary to open up the virions by removing their envelopes or protein shells with detergents or proteolytic enzymes.\n\nSeveral other enzymes have been described as being associated with the virions of the more complex viruses (see Chapter 3). It is important to distinguish enzymes that may be absorbed on the outside of the particle from those that are part of the virion. If they are truly virion-associated it is important to determine their location-are they in the envelope, within the outer part of the capsid, or within the viral core (see Kang and McAuslan, 1972) ?\n\nSerological surveys of populations of vertebrates are widely used in epidemiological studies, and provide information about the distribution and spread of viruses in time and space. In diagnostic virology, antibodies of known specificity are used to identify unknown viruses that may be recovered from diseased or healthy individuals, by the use of one or several of the techniques set out below. Frequently, viral isolation is unsuccessful, but observation of a rising antibody titer to a particular virus between acute phase and convalescent specimens of serum is taken as presumptive evidence that the virus being tested was involved in the disease episode.\n\nIn laboratory research, serological methods provide the potential for recognizing different antigenic components of a virus both in infected cells and during purification procedures, and for measuring the concentration of such antigens. For this purpose, antisera against viral antigens are produced in suitable laboratory animals, usually rabbits (review, Horwitz and Scharff, 1969a) . Further, the antibody response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of viral diseases (see Chapter 10), and methods for measuring different kinds of antibodies in various parts of the body are essential for the proper understanding of disease processes in intact animals.\n\nMany different serological techniques are available (Table 2 -7), each appropriate for particular purposes (see Casals, 1967; Lennette and Schmidt, 1969) . TCID50. The mixtures are allowed to stand for a time, e.g., 60 minutes at ambient temperature, and then assayed for residual infectivity by inoculation into cultured cells, embryonated eggs, or laboratory animals. The endpoint of the titration is taken as the highest dilution of antiserum that inhibits the development of CPE in cultured cells (Plate 2-5), or the multiplication of virus in the animal used.\n\nThe interaction of virions and antibodies is to some extent reversible, so that the apparent titer of antiserum will be influenced by factors such as the time and temperature of incubation of the virus-antiserum mixture, the volume of fluid in which the test is conducted, the susceptibility of the cell type used, and the time at which the CPE is read (review, Fazekas de St Groth, 1962) . Since all these factors may affect the final equilibrium between bound and free antibodies, strict comparisons of titers are only valid within a laboratory where a particular protocol has become standard. For example, all tests should be terminated when the \"virus only\" controls (no antiserum) first show complete CPE; otherwise, the apparent neutralizing titer of the serum drops the later the test is read, as the virus \"breaks through\" the higher dilutions of antiserum. There are many other ways of carrying out virus neutralization tests. The most important of these is the plaque reduction test, which measures the reduction in the num-\n\nber of plaques produced by a given viral suspension in the presence of graded dilutions of antibody.\n\nThe virus neutralization test is the most sensitive and the most specific serological procedure available. Only antibodies directed against surface antigens of the virion, particularly those involved in adsorption to the host cell, will register in this test. These superficial antigens are those that have been most subject to the selective pressures of evolution (e.g., by antigenic drift, see Chapter 17), and they are therefore specific to the viral type or strain. Hence, neutralizing antibodies against a given serotype usually show little or no cross-reaction with other viruses within the same group.\n\nAntibody can inhibit virus-mediated hemagglutination (HA) by blocking the particular antigens on the surface of the virion that are responsible for this phenomenon. The hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test is conducted as follows (Rosen, 1969) . The serum being tested is first treated to destroy nonspecific inhibitors of HA. For example, inhibitors of influenza virus HA are of two varieties: serum glycoproteins, which can be destroyed by periodate, trypsin, or the receptor-destroying enzyme of Vibrio cholerae; and heat-labile inhibitors, destroyed by heating at 56 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. The treated sera are then diluted serially in a plastic tray using a calibrated wire loop. About four or five \"agglutinating doses\" of the virus being tested are added to each cup from a calibrated dropping pipette, and erythrocytes of the appropriate species are added in the same way. The tray is allowed to stand at a suitable temperature and pH for enough time for the erythrocytes to settle (about 45 minutes). The HI titer is taken as the highest dilution of serum inhibiting hemagglutination (Plate 2-4).\n\nThe HI test is highly sensitive and, except in the case of the togaviruses, highly specific. It measures only those antibodies that bind directly to viral hemagglutinin (i.e., to the projecting tip of the peplomers of most enveloped viruses), and possibly also those capable of attaching to other antigens so closely adjacent to the hemagglutinin that HA is inhibited by steric hindrance. Such superficial antigens are usually type specific. Moreover, the HI test is simple, inexpensive, and rapid. It is the serological procedure of choice for assaying antibodies to any virus that causes hemagglutination.\n\nAntigen-antibody interactions can be detected by observing precipitation reactions in semisolid gels (reviews by Ouchterlony, 1964; Barron, 1971) . Antigen and antibody are placed in adjacent wells cut in a thin layer of agar on a glass slide or Petri dish. The reactants diffuse through the agar at a rate inversely related to their molecular weights. Where antigen and antibody meet in \"optimal proportions\" a sharp line of precipitate forms in the agar. If several antigens and their corresponding antibodies are present, as in the case of most unpurified preparations of virus and of unabsorbed antiviral sera, each antigenantibody complex forms a discrete line. If two qualitatively identical pr\u00e9para-rial. Furthermore, it is capable of providing a definitive answer overnight or sometimes within a few hours. On the other hand, the method does not lend itself readily to quantitation, i.e., it gives no accurate idea of the \"titer\" of the unknown antibody or antigen. Moreover, rather high concentrations of both reagents are necessary to ensure the formation of a visible line. It should be appreciated that as a rule purified viruses cannot be used as antigen in gel diffusion, because most virions are too large to diffuse through the agar at a satisfactory rate; crude preparations, on the other hand, usually contain most of the antigens of the virion in \"soluble\" or small particulate form, although some antibodies will react only with assembled virions and not with isolated coat proteins. This can present something of a technical problem, because if a particular antigen is present in particles of different size, several precipitin lines may result. Many of these drawbacks are overcome by an important new development whereby gel diffusion is rendered much more sensitive and can be quantitated (Schild et al., 1972) . Antigen, which can be whole virions but is preferably \"soluble,\" is incorporated throughout the agar; the lower the antigen concentration the higher the sensitivity of the test. Antisera placed in wells diffuses out and forms a precipitate with the antigen. The test is quantitated by measuring the diameter of the circle of precipitate. Sensitivity is increased by staining with thiazine red after washing out unprecipitated antigen (if \"soluble\"). Even greater sensitivity can be achieved if the antigen is radioactively labeled with 125 I, by autoradiography, or by counting a punched out circle of agar in a scintillation spectrometer.\n\nAntigen-antibody complexes will \"fix\" complement, and virus-antibody complexes are no exception to the rule (Schmidt, 1969b) . Indeed, following attachment of antibody to enveloped viruses, the phospholipase that comprises an integral component of the complement system may actually puncture the viral envelope.\n\nFor the complement fixation (CF) test the acute and convalescent sera are heated (56\u00b0C, 30 minutes) to inactivate complement, then serially diluted. Usually small plastic trays are used, in order to conserve reagents. Two units of antigen (e.g., a crude preparation of live or inactivated virus) are then added to each serum dilution together with two units of complement, derived from guinea pig serum. The reagents are allowed to interact at 4\u00b0C overnight (or at ambient temperature for a shorter interval) to allow complement to become \"fixed.\" Sheep erythrocytes, \"sensitized\" by the addition of rabbit antiserum against them (\"hemolysin\"), are then added and the trays are incubated at 37\u00b0C for about 45 minutes. In those cups where complement has been fixed by the virusantibody complex, the hemolysin agglutinates the RBC but cannot lyse them; where complement is still available, the RBC are lysed (Plate 2-7).\n\nTo ensure that the test is working properly, controls must be set up to exclude the following :\n\n1. The serum may be \"anticomplementary,\" i.e., it may fix complement even in the absence of viral antigen. This is most commonly due to hemolysis or bac-\n\nterial contamination in serum that has been improperly collected or stored, or to the high lipid content of serum taken too soon after a fatty meal. The anticomplementary activity can sometimes be removed by heating, by absorption with kaolin, or by absorption with excess complement followed b y heating.\n\n2. The viral antigen preparation may be anticomplementary, i.e., it fixes complement even in the absence of antiviral serum. This does not commonly occur, except with mouse brain extracts (togaviruses). The offending lipids can be removed with acetone or fluorocarbon.\n\n3. The viral antigen preparation may fix complement \"nonspecifically\" as a result of interaction between cellular antigens and anticellular antibodies in the serum. Such problems can be avoided by proper care in the selection of host species for the growth of virus and the preparation of antisera, respectively.\n\n4. O n the other hand, anticomplementary activity of serum may indicate the presence of immune complexes in the circulation, which may bind complement in vivo. Since such antigen-antibody complexes may play an important role in pathogenesis (see Chapter 10) it is necessary to differentiate their presence from nonspecific anticomplementary activity of the types just mentioned.\n\nThe crude preparations of virus (e.g., cell culture supernatants) employed as antigen in most CF tests contain besides virions, \"soluble\" antigens, corresponding to unassembled components of the virion and also virus-coded nonvirion proteins. Antibodies to all these antigens may be present in convalescent sera and will register by CF. Accordingly, the CF test, as usually performed, will demonstrate substantial \"crossing\" between serotypes with a given group of viruses if those serotypes share common group (\"family\") antigens (e.g., adenoviruses). In this sense, it is not a highly specific test, since it does not always allow one to discriminate between antibodies to different serotypes. It is also not a particularly sensitive test, in that antibody titers determined by CF are lower than those obtained in neutralization or HI tests on the same serum. Yet, this is the test of choice for the preliminary screening of a serum for antibody, when one has little idea of even the group to which the causative virus belongs. For example, a single CF test using any adenovirus serotype as antigen will detect serum antibodies provoked by any other adenovirus serotype. Once \"groupspecific\" antibodies have been determined in this way, the neutralization or HI test can be invoked to identify \"type-specific\" antibodies, should that information be required.\n\nOver 30 years ago, Coons (Coons et al., 1941) brought to virology a technique that has been of great benefit to research, and is now being extensively used as a diagnostic aid. \"Fluorescent antibody\" is specific immunoglobulin which has been \"tagged\" with a dye such as fluorescein or rhodamine that fluoresces on exposure to ultraviolet or blue light. The chemical process of conjugation can be accomplished as a simple laboratory routine or fluoresceinconjugated immunoglobulins are commercially available. There are three main variants of this technique (reviews, Fraser, 1969; Vogt, 1969b) .\n\nDirect Immunofluorescence (A-af). Viral antigen (A) (e.g., in the form of an acetone-fixed, virus-infected cell monolayer on a cover slip) is exposed to fluorescein-tagged antiviral serum (af). Excess af is washed away and the cells are inspected microscopically using a powerful light source (xenon or mercury vapor lamp) from which all but the light of short wavelength has been filtered out. Additional filters in the eyepieces, in turn, absorb all the blue and ultraviolet light, so that the specimen appears black except for those areas from which fluorescein is emitting greenish-yellow light (Plate 2-8).\n\nThis system, sometimes known as the \"sandwich\" technique, differs in that the antiviral antibody (a) is untagged, but fills the role of the \"meat in the sandwich.\" It binds to antigen (A) and also to a fluorescein-conjugated antigammaglobulin (g/), which is subsequently added. For example, if the antiviral serum were a human convalescent serum, then it would be appropriate for g to be antibody globulin made in a goat or a rabbit by injecting normal human globulin. The indirect technique has the advantages of greater sensitivity, and more important, in diagnostic virology, of requiring PLATE 2-8. Indirect immunofluorescence test used for determining the site of assembly of components of influenza virus. Antibody against the NP (nucleocapsid) antigen shows nuclear accumulation at 4 hours after infection of chick cells. Guinea pig antiserum to NP antigen; fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG. (Courtesy Dr. N. Dimmock.) only a single tagged reagent, e.g., fluorescein-conjugated goat antihuman gammaglobulin, with which to test the interaction between any antigen and the corresponding human antibody.\n\nHere complement is bound to the antigen-antibody complex, then fluorescein-conjugated anticomplement immunoglobulin is added. The system is not without its difficulties, and is not used as extensively as the other two methods.\n\nImmunofluorescence has two great advantages over other serological techniques. For the research worker, it has provided a method for determining which cells in an organ contain virus, and at another level, the location of particular viral antigens in the infected cell. Although problems of nonspecific fluorescence have delayed its widespread acceptance in the diagnostic laboratory, immunofluorescence has great potential for speeding up viral identification, whether it is used directly on biopsy or autopsy material, or after the growth of viruses in cell culture.\n\nThe availability of carrier-free preparations of radioisotopes, especially of iodine ( 125 I or 131 I), which can be readily coupled to the tyrosine residues of proteins, has led to the development of radioimmunoassays for analyzing either antigens or antibodies. These procedures are very sensitive, e.g., the technique of radioautography of cells labeled with radioactive 125 I antigen or antibody is over a thousand times more sensitive than is the use of fluorescent antigen or antibody. Radioimmunoassays are also very accurate and simple to perform. One of the two major reagents, either antigen or antibody, is labeled with isotope so that it can be followed by standard procedures, such as radioautography or counting in a scintillation spectrometer. There are three major requirements: (a) One of the reagents, antigen or antibody, should be available in pure form. (b) The extent of substitution of the protein with iodide should be kept low (less than two atoms of iodide per protein molecule of about 40,000 daltons), otherwise the serological properties of the protein may be modified, (c) The process of iodination should not change the serological properties.\n\nTwo principal methods for iodinating proteins are available. In the first, iodide added to the protein is oxidized by adding an oxidant, usually chloramine-T (Greenwood et al., 1963) . This is efficient but suffers from the disadvantage that sometimes methionine residues in proteins are readily oxidized and this may change the serological properties of the protein. In the second method, iodide added to the protein is oxidized by incorporating an enzyme, lactoperoxidase, into the reaction mixture (Marchalonis, 1969) . This technique is more specific and less damaging to the antigen but not quite as efficient at causing substitution of the protein by iodide.\n\nTwo commonly used types of radioimmunoassay are radioimmunoelectrophoresis and radioimmunodiffusion (Salzman and Moss, 1969; Yagi, 1971). In both procedures, use is made of the knowledge that globulins with antibody activity may react with antigen even after their precipitation by antisera previously prepared against the globulin. For example, if one wishes to know what class of antibody molecules which specifically react with a given antigen are present in serum, the following approach could be used. A sample of the serum is subjected in the normal way to immunoelectrophoresis in agar gels on glass slides. Antiglobulin serum is then diffused into the gel so that arcs of precipitation occur, corresponding to the different classes of antibody. The slides containing the agar and reagents are thoroughly washed and the radiolabeled antigen is diffused into the gel. The slides are again thoroughly washed, stained, and subjected to radioautography. Identification of radioactive arcs (and hence specific antibody) is made by superimposing the film bearing the autoradiograph over the stained slide.\n\nWhile useful, this procedure does not readily allow a quantitative estimate of the amount of specific antibody (or antigen). This may be achieved in several ways (Horwitz and Scharff, 1969b), one of which is as follows (Wistar, 1968) . Aliquots of 125 I-labeled antigen (or antibody) are mixed with serial dilutions of the antiserum (or antigen). An appropriate amount of antiglobulin antibody is added, the mixture incubated for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C, and allowed to stand for 16 hours at 4\u00b0C. The mixtures are then centrifuged so that complexes of antigen, antibody, and antiglobulin antibody, but not free antigen or antibody, are sedimented. The radioactivity in the washed sediments is then estimated in the scintillation spectrometer."}
