{"title": "Immunological characterizations of the nucleocapsid protein based SARS vaccine candidates", "body": "A newly emerging infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS CoV) had significant economic impacts in countries affected by the disease outbreak in [2003] [2004] . The lack of efficient treatments and prevention means the possibility exists for SARS to return in the future. In addition, high-risk populations such as laboratory and hospital workers need effective 0264 SARS vaccines for protection. Unfortunately, recent reports have shown that inactivated coronavirus vaccines in a cat model might worsen the disease rather than prevent it [1] . Furthermore, the SARS virus may cause mild liver inflammation in ferrets, and the damage was much more serious if animals were first given a candidate SARS vaccine based on the vaccinia virus [2] . Yang et al. [3] also found that antibodies against SARS CoV S protein enhanced the entry of virus in in vitro cell culture studies. Therefore, in order to generate safe and effective SARS vaccines, we urgently need greater understanding of the immunological responses of vaccine candidates in different animal models.\n\nThe N protein of the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) has been used as subunit vaccines to induce protective immunity and to prevent the progression of diseases in a cat model [4] . The literature indicates that immunization of DNA plasmids that encode the N protein of the Ebola virus and influenza virus elicits protective antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses [5] [6] [7] . In avian coronaviruses, N protein-specific T-cell responses were shown to generate protective immunity [8] . These results indicate that a good N protein vaccine candidate should elicit strong cellular immune responses. The N protein of SARS CoV is 422 amino acids long and highly conserved (99%) within different isolates, but it shares only 20-30% amino acid homology with the N proteins of other coronaviruses [9] . In fact, the DNA vaccine candidate encoding the N protein of the SARS CoV fused with calreticulin (CRT) was shown to induce potent humoral and cellular immune responses in a mouse model, and inhibited replication of the recombinant vaccinia virus that expressed the N protein in vivo [10] . We therefore focused on the N protein of the SARS CoV as the target antigen for subunit vaccine development.\n\nWith an eye toward clinical applications, we selected two potential adjuvants in clinical used that have been shown to be strong cellular immune response inducers: Montanide ISA-51 and the immune-stimulating oligonucleotide, CpG [11] . ISA-51 and CpG were used to emulsify the rN protein as vaccine candidates for mouse and macaque immunogenicity studies. In the present study, we report that (1) ISA-51/CpGformulated rN protein was dramatically biased toward the Th1 immune response; (2) the immunodominant B-and T-cell epitopes of the N protein were present in both BALB/c mice and macaques; (3) conserved immunodominant B-cell epitopes were identified in mice, macaques, and SARS patients; (4) N protein-specific CD8 + cells could be induced by ISA-51/CpG formulated with either the rN protein or synthetic peptides containing the H-2K d CTL epitope motif.\n\nRecombinant SARS CoV N protein (rN) containing a N-terminal His tag gene was cloned into the pRSETA vec-tor (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for protein expression. The plasmid was transformed into an Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)Gold (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX, USA) host strain and incubated at 32 \u2022 C overnight. The expression of rN was induced with 0.5 mM of isopropyl \u2424-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) for 3 h, then cells were harvested by centrifugation (8000 \u00d7 g for 20 min), and cell pellets were re-suspended in 100 ml of homogenate buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mM sucrose, and 10 mM imidazole). After disruption using a French Press (Constant Systems, Daventry, UK) at 186 Mpa, cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (80,000 \u00d7 g for 60 min). Most of the target protein was extracted from the pellet with 8 M urea in homogenate buffer and loaded into 1 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, San Diego, CA, USA). The resin was washed with the same buffer, and the target protein was purified by changing the pH value. After further washing with pH 6.3 and 5.9 homogenate buffers and 8 M urea, the rN was eluted from the resin using pH 4.5 homogenate buffer and 8 M urea, then the purified rN was refolded by dialyzation against phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). The purified rN was stored at \u221220 \u2022 C in PBS with 10% glycerol for further studies.\n\nWhen analyzing samples by SDS-PAGE, 10 l of samples were mixed with an equal volume of the sample buffer (63 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.002% bromophenol blue) and heated in boiling water for 3 min. The samples (5-50 g protein per lane) were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, then electrophoretically transferred from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) at 392 mA for 40 min. The membrane was blocked overnight with 5% non-fat milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) at 4 \u2022 C. After washing with PBST, the blot was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a mouse anti-His antibody (1:1500 dilution, Amersham Biosciences, New Territories, HK). After extensive washing with PBST then incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000, Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA), the blot was developed with 0.2 mM DAB (3,3 -diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). After development for 2-3 min, the blot was washed with distilled water to stop the reaction.\n\nSix-to eight-week old female BALB/c mice were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal Breeding and Research Center (Taipei, Taiwan). All mice were housed at the Animal Technology Institute Taiwan (ATIT, Miaoli, Taiwan) animal facility. Monkeys (Formosan macaques, Macaca cyclopis) were maintained in accordance with institutional animal care protocols of the Center of Disease Control, Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nAll of the animal studies were approved by the Animal Committee of the National Health Research Institutes, Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nPeptides derived from the SARS CoV N protein sequence were synthesized as 15-mer fragments with 10-amino-acid overlap that covered the entire N protein sequence of the Urbani strain (Kelowna, Taipei, Taiwan); peptides were dissolved in 5% DMSO at 2 mg/ml. Two CTL epitopes, QFKD-NVILL and VWVATEGAL, produced from the N protein with the BABL/c (H-2K d ) mice class I binding motif, were predicted by a computer-based program on the web site of the BioInformatics and Molecular Analysis Section (Bethesda, MD, USA) [12] .\n\nMice were immunized subcutaneously with 50 g of rN protein emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) or Montanide ISA-51 (Seppic, Paris, France) with 50 g of the CpG oligonucleotide (TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT GTC GTT TTG TCG TT). Mice received two booster doses of the immunogen, one each at 2 and 4 weeks later. Blood samples were collected every 2 weeks post-immunization. For T-cell analysis, mice were sacrificed at 7 days after the final immunization. In the pooled peptides groups, all peptides (Table 2) containing H-2K d -restricted epitopes were emulsified in IFA or ISA-51 with the CpG oligonucleotide (ISA/CpG), and immunized subcutaneously. For the monkey experiments, the 200 g of rN was emulsified in 0.5 ml of ISA/CpG, and multiple injections were given muscularly at 0, 4, and 8 weeks. Sera were collected at specified time points. Sera were obtained from clotted blood samples by centrifugation and were heatinactivated at 56 \u2022 C for 30 min.\n\nSera from five convalescent-phase humans were obtained from the Center of Disease Control, Taipei, Taiwan. Sera were collected 30-60 days after recovery from the disease based on the clinical diagnosis. All sera were inactivated following government guidelines before transfer to our laboratory.\n\nThe presence of N protein-or peptide-specific antibodies in the sera was determined by ELISA. In briefly, 50 l (10 g/ml) of purified rN or peptides were coated in 96well microtiter plates with 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) by overnight incubation at 4 \u2022 C. Coated plates were washed twice with PBST and then blocked with 5% non-fat milk in PBS at room temperature for 2 h. Diluted sera from immunized animals were applied to wells at room temperature for 2 h. Followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or HRP-conjugated goat anti-monkey IgG (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), the assay was developed with 3,3 ,5,5tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), and the reaction was stopped by adding 100 l of 1 M H 2 SO 4 per well. Plates were read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). For antibody isotype analysis, biotinconjugated rat anti-mouse IgG1 and IgG2a (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) were added to the wells for sera binding, then HRP-conjugated streptavidin was added and developed with the TMB substrate. The antibody titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that produced an OD450-nm value of two-fold higher than the pre-immune sera.\n\nOn day 7 after the final immunization, mice were sacrificed to harvest their spleens. Erythrocyte-depleted splenocytes (1.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/well) in 96-well plates were cultured in vitro with 5 g/ml of pooled peptide or individual peptide that covered all of the N protein amino acid plates for 5 h. IFN-\u2425-secreting cells were detected with a Mouse IFN-\u2425 Secretion Assay Detection Kit (Miltenyi Biotec., Gladbach, Germany). In brief, 1 \u00d7 10 6 splenocytes were harvested, and labeled with an IFN-\u2425 capture antibody for 5 min at 4 \u2022 C. Afterwards, cells were transferred into 37 \u2022 C warm medium for 45 min, then washed twice, and stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated IFN-\u2425 detection reagent, and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD8 or anti-CD4 antibodies. After washing, cells were collected and analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument with CellQuest software. Dead cells were gated by 1 g/ml propidium iodide.\n\nT-cell epitope mapping was performed in mice and monkeys immunized with purified rN (50 and 200 g, respectively) emulsified in ISA-51 plus 50 g of the CpG oligonucleotide. Seven days after the second boost, splenocytes from mice or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from monkeys (4 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO, San Diego, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 g/ml of streptomycin, and 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol with 5 g/ml of pooled or individual peptides at 37 \u2022 C for 5 days. Concanavalin A (Con A) or medium alone served as the positive and background controls, respectively. The supernatant was harvested and assayed for cytokine production. Mouse IFN-\u2425 was quantitated by ELISA using the matching anti-IFN-\u2425 antibody set (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's directions. Monkey IFN-\u2425 was measured using an ELISA kit from Biosource International (Camarillo, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nData were evaluated using Student's t-test analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the statistical significance of differences between samples. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nThe ability of certain individuals to overcome infection without treatment led to the hypothesis that administration of vaccines against SARS may provide effective protection against the disease. Like other viruses with spike proteins on the viral surface, coronaviruses have been shown to elicit enhancement of disease through non-neutralizing spike protein-specific antibodies [3] , so vaccines that elicit T-cell immunity against SARS proteins are likely to receive more-favorable clinical attention. In animal coronavirus vaccine development, the N protein has been widely tested as an immunogen for protection against coronavirus infections. Inoculation of chickens with plasmid DNA encoding the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) carboxyl terminus of the N protein led to the induction of a specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte population capable of recognizing two distinct IBV strains. In addition, the adoptive transfer of T cells from animals inoculated with IBV to na\u00efve chicks provided CD8 + \u2423\u2424 specific protection [13] . A Th1 T-cell line resistant to the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) showed marked increases in IFN-\u2425 expression with a decrease in IL-4 production when incubated with MHV-infected cells [14] . Infusion of this resistant cell line into susceptible mice led to complete protection against MHV infection. The immunity against MHV was demonstrated to be a process dependent upon CD8 + , perforin, and IFN-\u2425 in the absence of CD4 + T cells [15] . The generation of IgG2a antibodies following DNA immunization of N protein suggested that there was a significant Th1-type response [16] . With the strong potential protective immunity of N protein-based vaccines, we hypothesized that the SARS CoV N protein would elicit effective immune responses against SARS diseases.\n\nTo aid the downstream purification process, the C-terminal end of the N protein-coding region was tagged with six histidine residues. Expression of rN protein could be induced by adding 1 mM of isopropyl \u2424-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) into the E. coli cell culture, and the level of expression was observed using an SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1A, lanes 1  and 2) . The electrophoretic position of the rN protein corresponded to the predicted size of 46 kDa. rN proteins were collected as pellets from cell lysates using centrifugation. rN proteins were purified using an IMAC (immobilized metal affinity chromatography) column and by a pH stepwise gradient containing 8 M urea (Fig. 1A, lanes 3-9) . Purified rN proteins were refolded by dialysis against PBS and could be detected by blotting with an anti-His antibody (Fig. 1B) . We obtained 4-5 mg of purified rN protein from 1 L of cell culture, and it represented a 20% overall yield.\n\nAs mentioned above, a strong adjuvant that elicits strong cellular immune responses is necessary for the N protein to be effective as a vaccine candidate. Different adjuvant formulations induced different immune responses in immunized animals. To assess the immune responses elicited by the rN protein in our BALB/c mouse model, rN protein was formulated with either incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), a potent adjuvant complex, ISA/CpG, or PBS alone. After three immunizations (50 g of rN protein per dose), the N proteinspecific antibody responses were measured using ELISA, and results are shown in Fig. 2A . The antibody titers were found to be 8 \u00d7 10 \u22128 , 5 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , and 5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 in the ISA/CpG, IFA, and PBS groups, respectively. To test whether the strong immune response elicited by the rN protein formulated with ISA/CpG was useful in clinical application, we analyzed the subtypes of reactive antibodies from all groups. The isotypes generated in different groups are shown in Fig. 2B ; most of the antibodies were IgG1 found in the PBS group (1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ), with less IgG2a (1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ). There were similar IgG1 titers found in both the IFA and ISA/CpG groups (3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ). Not surprisingly, the ISA/CpG group generated strong and dominant IgG2a antibodies (1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ). But the IFA group produced less IgG2a (6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ). This result indicated that ISA/CpG could drive the immune response toward Th1, and is consistent with previous results which showed that the synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide CpG motif could skew the host's immune response toward Th1 [17] and the combination of CpG and ISA-51 also showed the ability to enhance the protective efficacy of a subunit malaria vaccine candidate [11] .\n\nIdentification of the immunodominant B cell epitopes could be useful for future immunological investigation. To identify B-cell epitopes of the N protein, mice were immunized with rN protein formulated with either IFA or ISA/CpG. To systemically analyze the B-cell epitopes, each of the peptide pools (NP1-NP8), consisting of 10 consecutive 15-mer overlapping peptides of the N protein, was used to screen against anti-N antisera (see Table 1 ). In this peptide-ELISA assay, we used the rN protein as the positive control and internal standard to normalize the reactivity. Since we desired to determine the immunodominant epitopes, mouse sera were diluted to 1:5000 for epitope screening. When mouse antisera were generated from the group immunized with rN protein formulated with IFA, we found two major reactive peptides pools to be NP1 and NP8. Further individual peptide reac-tivity analysis showed that peptides no. 8, 72, 73, 78, and 80 contained immunodominant epitopes (Fig. 3A) . In the ISA/CpG-immunized mouse group, NP4 and NP8 were the two major reactive peptide pools. With further individual peptide screening, we found the major reactive peptides to be The eighty 15-mer overlapping peptides that cover the entire sequence of the SARS CoV N protein were used in an ELISA to measure the immunodominant linear B-cell epitopes. The \"relative reactivity\" of each peptide with the tested sera was calculated using the mean OD of each peptide divided by the mean OD of peptide no. 1. Samples with \u22655 times the \"relative reactivity\" were considered to be positive. nos. 34, 72, 73, 78, and 80 (Fig. 3A) . Regardless of which adjuvants were used, the results showed that BALB/c mouse immunodominant B-cell epitopes were located at the Cterminal regions (peptides no. 72, 73, 78, and 80). However, sera from BALB/c mice immunized with \u2424-propiolactoneinactivated SARS virus recognized the N-terminal region (residues 76-101) of the N protein [18] . These different results could have been due to the nature of the antigens (refolded rN protein versus the inactivated SARS virus) and adjuvants used.\n\nSince the rN protein formulated in ISA/CpG provided the best immune responses in the mouse model, we selected this adjuvant for the macaque immunogenicity studies. Sera from two immunized macaques both had about a 10 \u22126 reactivity titer against the rN protein according to ELISA (data not shown). For immunodominant B-cell epitope identification, macaque sera were diluted 1:200 to screen the reactive peptide pools. Serum from monkey no. 1 recognized the peptide pools NP4, NP6, and NP8. Serum from monkey no. 2 reacted with peptide pools NP6 and NP8. To further identify the reactive peptides, we found that peptides no. 54 and 58 contained the immunodominant B-cell epitopes in peptide pool NP6, since they were recognized by the antisera from both macaques. Also peptides no. 72, 73, and 80 in NP8 were found to contain macaque immunodominant B-cell epitopes. Peptides no. 32-34 and 36 in peptide pool NP4 were shown to be most reactive with serum from monkey no. 1 (Fig. 3B ). From the results described above, the conserved immunodominant B-cell epitopes in mice and monkeys were located within peptides no. 34 (residues 166-180), 72 (residues 351-365), 73 (residues 356-370), and 80 (residues 396-410).\n\nWe further studied the B-cell epitopes of the N protein which recognized SARS patients' sera. When patients' sera were diluted at 1:500 and used to screen the reactivity with the peptide pools, we found that only two patients' sera reacted with peptide pool NP4 and purified NP (data not shown) out of five randomly selected patients' sera. With further individual peptide screening, the major reactive peptides were found to be peptides no. 32 and 33 that corresponded to residues 156-175 (Fig. 3C) . These results were consistent with previous reports by Shichijo et al. [19] , He et al. [18] , and Guo et al. [20] who also found that the region around residues 156-175 reacted with sera from more than 50% of SARS patients.\n\nWe summarized all these data in Fig. 4 , which shows that immunodominant B-cell epitopes corresponding to residues 356-375 and 396-410 were conserved in mice and macaques. Interestingly, the region corresponding to residues 156-175 was found to contain B-cell epitopes in all three species. This region (residues 156-175) will be useful for diagnostic kit development and as a biomarker for vaccine development as well.\n\nMurine T-cell epitopes were identified using the in vitro stimulatory effects of overlapping peptides on T cells derived from splenocytes of BALB/c mice immunized with the rN protein formulated with either IFA or ISA/CpG adjuvants. The amounts of secreted IFN-\u2425 in culture supernatants were determined by IFN-\u2425-specific ELISA kits. No IFN-\u2425 was detected in PBS, which served as the control group (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5A , IFN-\u2425 production was observed in both IFA-and ISA/CpG-immunized groups, and several different peptides were found to be capable of stimulating IFN-\u2425 secretion. The potential T-cell epitopes were found in the IFA group to correspond to residues 11-30, 36-60, 81-100, and 361-375. In the ISA/CpG group, the T-cell- reactive regions were identified to be residues 1-30, 86-110, 306-320, and 351-365. Only peptides no. 4 (residues 16-40) and 18 (residues 86-100) were found to stimulate IFN-\u2425 production in both immunized groups. Although we could not determine the H-2K d -restricted CTL epitope from natural SARS CoV infections, it seemed likely that residues 81-95 can be used as an indicator to study the T-cell response of N protein subunit vaccines. Interestingly, peptide no. 18 contains a potential BALB/c mouse CTL epitope, YYRRATRRV, identified by epitope prediction algorithms.\n\nMacaque immunodominant T-cell epitope mapping was also performed with PBMCs isolated from two macaques (M1 and M2) vaccinated twice with the rN protein formulated in ISA/CpG. We found IFN-\u2425 production only in the T-cell culture derived from the PBMCs of M1 (Fig. 5B) . In further studies, we observed that only peptide no. 68 (residues 336-350, GAIKLDDKDPQFKDN) was capable of stimulating IFN-\u2425 production in T-cell culture derived from PBMCs of monkey M1. This result could be important information for further SARS vaccine evaluation, especially in a macaque infection model. In our human immunodominant T-cell epitope identification studies (Des et al. published elsewhere), we also found that peptide no. 68 elicited responses from CD4-and CD8-positive cells derived from PBMCs of two SARS patients with the HLA-A11 class I haplotype. Our findings suggest that the rN protein formulated in ISA/CpG adjuvant can elicit T-cell immune responses, which may be important in the protective immunity against SARS diseases.\n\nIn addition to the B-cell and Th1-cell responses, the CTL may play an important role in virus-infected cell clearance. A computer-based program, BIMAS HLA Peptide Binding Prediction program [12] , was used to predict candidate CTL peptides of N protein. Two 9-mer peptides (QFKDNVILL and VWVATEGAL) were identified and synthesized based on the highest score values (Table 2 ). These two peptides were mixed and formulated in ISA/CpG adjuvant with six other 15-mer peptides of N protein that were identified to consist of H2-K d CTL-binding epitopes. At 7 days after the third immunizations, splenocytes of BALB/c mice were harvested, and various peptides were added to the splenocyte cultures for in vitro stimulation. After 5 days, cytokine secretions of IL-4 and IFN-\u2425 were measured using a cytokine-specific ELISA. Only peptide no. 17 (PDDQIGYYRRATRRV) was observed to be capable of stimulating IFN-\u2425 production (73 pg/ml) (Fig. 6A) . This result and the T-cell epitope mapping described above confirmed that YYRRATRRV is a very potent functional T-cell epitope.\n\nIn order to analyze the reactive T-cell subsets, we restimulated splenocytes with peptide no. 17 in the presence of 50 U/ml recombinant IL-2. After 5 h, two-color flow cytometric analysis of T-cell subsets and IFN-\u2425 staining revealed that the T-cell population was only reactive to peptide no. The isolated splenocytes at 1 \u00d7 10 6 in 24-well plates were stimulated with 5 g/ml of each peptide. The numbers 9-1 and 9-2 represent the top two ranking nonamer peptides, respectively (see Table 2 ); the peptide order was based on the predicted score. (B) Positive wells cultured with corresponding peptides (2.5 g/ml) at 37 \u2022 C for 7 days in the presence of 50 U/ml IL-2. Cultured cells were re-stimulated with the corresponding peptide at 37 \u2022 C for 4 h. IFN-\u2425-secreting CD4 + and CD8 + cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. 17 . Concentrations of CD4 + /IFN-\u2425 + and CD8 + /IFN-\u2425 + cells were found to be 1.35 and 0.22%, respectively (Fig. 6B) . The lower CD8 + /IFN-\u2425 + cell population was perhaps due to peptide 17 being a 15-mer peptide that might not have the best match to the MHC class I preferred peptide length (8-10-mer peptides).\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated in mouse and macaque models that the rN protein formulated with potential clinically useful adjuvants, ISA-5 and CpG, elicited strong Th1 immune responses and may be excellent SARS vaccine candidates. Some of human B-and T-cell immunodominant epitopes of the N protein were also found in mice and macaques immunized with the rN protein formulated in ISA/CpG adjuvants. The conserved immunodominant epitopes identified in these three species provide very important information for further vaccine design."}
