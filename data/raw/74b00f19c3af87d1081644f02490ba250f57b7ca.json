{"title": "Original Article", "body": "However, COVID-19 differs from other previous strains in having several critical residues at 2019-nCoV receptor-binding motif (particularly Gln493) which provide advantageous interactions with human ACE2 [15] . This difference in affinity possibly explains why the novel coronavirus is more contagious than those other viruses.\n\nAt present, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for humans, but Chinese traditional medicine, such ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be possible treatments for COVID-19. However, there are no clinical trials approving the safety and efficacy for these drugs [22] .\n\nThe main concept within all the immunizations is the ability of the vaccine to initiate an immune response in a faster mode than the pathogen itself. Although traditional vaccines, which depend on biochemical trials, induced potent neutralizing and protective responses in the immunized animals but they can be costly, allergenic, time consuming and require in vitro culture of pathogenic viruses leading to serious concern of safety [23, 24]. Thus the need for safe and efficacious vaccines is highly recommended.\n\nPeptide-based vaccines do not need in vitro culture making them biologically safe, and their selectivity allows accurate activation of immune responses [25, 26] . The core mechanism of the peptide vaccines is built on the chemical method to synthesize the recognized B-cell and T-cell epitopes that are immunodominant and can induce specific immune responses. B-cell epitope of a target molecule can be linked with a T-cell epitope to make it immunogenic. The T-cell epitopes are short peptide fragments (8-20 amino acids), whereas the B-cell epitopes can be proteins [27, 28] . Therefore, in this study, we aimed to design a peptide-based vaccine to predict epitopes from corona envelope (E) protein using immunoinformatics analysis [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . While rapid further studies are recommended to prove the efficiency of the predicted epitopes as a peptide vaccine against this emerging infection.\n\nWorkflow summarizing the procedures for the epitope-based peptide vaccine prediction is shown in Fig. 1 Figure 1: Descriptive workflow for the epitope-based peptide vaccine prediction.\n\nFull genebank files of the complete genomes and annotation of COVID-19(NC_04551) SARS-CoV(FJ211859), MESA-CoV(NC_019843), HCoV-HKU1(AY884001), (HCoV-OC43 (KF923903), HCoV-NL63 (NC_005831) and HCoV-229E (KY983587) were retrieved from the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI); while The FASTA format of envelope (E) protein (YP_009724392.1) , spike (S)protein (YP_009724390.1), nucleocapsid (N) protein (YP_009724397.2) and membrane (M) protein (YP_009724393.1) of 2019-nCoV and the envelope (E) protein of two Chinese and two American sequences (YP009724392.1, QHQ71975.1, QHO60596.1 and QHN73797.1) were obtained from the NCBI. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)\n\nACT is an in silico analysis software for visualization of comparisons between complete genome sequences and associated annotations [35] . It is also applied to identify regions of similarity, rearrangements and insertions at any level from base-pair differences to the whole genome. (https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/artemis-comparison-tool-act).\n\nIt is the first server for alignment-independent prediction of protective antigens. It allows antigen classification solely based on the physicochemical properties of proteins without recourse to sequence alignment. It predicts the probability of the antigenicity one or multiple of protein based on auto cross covariance (ACC) transformation of protein sequence. Structural CoV-2019 protein (N,S,E and M) was analyzed by VaxiJen with threshold of 0.4 [36] . (http://www.ddgpharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html)\n\nIt is a software package proposed to stream a distinct program that can run nearly any sequence operation as well as a few basic alignment investigations. The sequences of E protein were retrieved from UniProt were run in BioEdit to determine the conserved sites through ClustalW in the application settings [37] .\n\nMEGA (version 10.1.6) is software for the comparative analysis of molecular sequences. It is used for pairwise and multiple sequences alignment alongside construction and analysis of phylogenetic trees and evolutionary relationships. The gap penalty was 15 for opening and 6.66 for extending the gap for both pairwise and multiple sequences alignment. Bootstrapping of 300 was used in construction of maximum like hood phylogenetic tree [38, 39] . (https://www.megasoftware.net).\n\nIEDB tools were used to predict the conserved sequences (10-mersequence) from HLA class I and class II T-cell epitopes by using artificial neural network (ANN) approach [40] [41] [42] . Artificial Neural Network (ANN) version 2.2 was chosen as Prediction method as it depends on the median inhibitory concentration (IC50) [40, [43] [44] [45] . For the binding analysis, all the alleles were carefully chosen, and the length was set at 10 before prediction was done. Analysis of epitopes binding to MHC class I and II molecules was assessed by the IEDB MHC prediction server at (http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/) and (http://tools.iedb.org/mhcii/), respectively. All conserved immunodominant peptides binding to MHC I and II molecules at score equal or less than 100 median inhibitory concentrations (IC50) and 1000, respectively were selected for further analysis while epitopes with IC50 greater than 100 were eliminated [46] .\n\nPopulation coverage for each epitope was carefully determined by the IEDB population coverage calculation tool. Due to the diverse binding sites of epitopes with different HLA allele, the most promising epitope candidates were calculated for population coverage against the whole world, China and Europe population to get and ensure a universal vaccine [47, 48] . (http://tools.iedb.org/population/)\n\nThe reference sequence of E protein that has been retrieved from gene bank was used as an input in RaptorX to predict the 3D structure of E protein [49, 50] , the visualization of the obtained 3D protein structure was performed in UCSF Chimera (version1.8) [51] .\n\nIn silico Molecular Docking:\n\nIn order to estimate the binding affinities between the epitopes and molecular structure of MHC I and MHC II, in silico molecular docking were used. Sequences of proposed epitopes were selected from COVID-19 reference sequence using UCSF Chimera 1.10 and saved as a PDB file.\n\nThe obtained files were then optimized and energy minimized. The HLA-A*02:01 was selected as the macromolecule for docking. Its crystal structure (4UQ3) was downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do), which was in a complex with an azobenzene-containing peptide [52] .\n\nAll water molecules and heteroatoms in the retrieved target file 4UQ3 were then removed.\n\nTarget structure was further optimized and energy minimized using Swiss PDB viewer V.4.1.0 software [53] .\n\nMolecular docking was performed using Autodock 4.0 software, based on Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm; which combines energy evaluation through grids of affinity potential to find the suitable binding position for a ligand on a given protein [54, 55] Polar hydrogen atoms were added to the protein targets and Kollman united atomic charges were computed. The target's grid map was calculated and set to 60\u00d760\u00d760 points with grid spacing of 0.375 \u01fa . The grid box was then allocated properly in the target to include the active residue in the center. The genetic algorithm and its run were set to 100.The docking algorithms were set to default.

In the last few decades, biotechnology has advanced rapidly; alongside with the understanding of immunology which assisted the rise of new approaches towards rational vaccines design [60] . Peptide-based vaccines are designed to elicit immunity particular pathogens by selectively stimulating antigen specific for B and T cells [61] .Applying the advanced bioinformatics tools and databases, various peptide-based vaccines could be designed where the peptides act as ligands [62] [63] [64] . This approach has been used frequently in Saint Louis encephalitis virus [65] , dengue virus [66] , chikungunya virus [67] proposing promising peptides for designing vaccines.\n\nThe COVID-19 is an RNA virus which tends to mutate more commonly than the DNA viruses [68] . These mutations lied on the surface of the protein, which make COVID-19 more superior than other previous strains by inducing its sustainability leaving the immune system in blind spot [69] .\n\nIn our present work, different peptides were proposed for the designing of vaccine against COVID-19 (Fig. 1) . In the beginning, the whole genome of COVID-19 was analyzed by comparative genomic approach to determine the potential antigenic target [70] . Artemis Comparative Tool (ACT) was used to analyze human Coronavirus (HCov-HKU1) reference sequence vs. Wuhan-Hu-1 COVID-19. Results obtained (Fig.2) revealed extensive mutation among the tested genomes. New genes; ORF8 and ORF6; were found inserted in COVID-19 which were absent in HCov-HKU1 that might be acquired by the horizontal gene transmission [71] . High rate of mutation between the two genomes were observed in the region from 20000 bp to the end of the sequence. This region encodes the four major structural proteins in coronavirus which are envelope (E) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and spike (S) protein, all of which are required to produce a structurally complete virus [72, 73] .\n\nThese conserved antigenic sites were revealed in previous studies through sequence alignment between MERS-CoV and Bat-coronavirus [74] and analyzed in SARS-CoV [75] .\n\nThe four proteins were then analyzed by Vaxigen software to test the probability of antigenic proteins. Protein E was found to be the most antigenic gene with the highest probability as shown in Table 1 . Literature survey confirmed this result in which protein E was investigated in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and, more recently, Middle-East respiratory 1 8 syndrome (MERS) [72] . Furthermore, the conservation of this protein against the seven strains was tested and confirmed through the use of BioEdit package tool (Fig. 3) .\n\nAs phylogenetic analysis is very powerful tool for determining the evolutionary relationship between strains. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed using ClustalW for the seven strains of coronavirus, which are COVID-19(NC_04551), SARS-CoV (FJ211859), MESA-CoV (NC_019843), HCoV-HKU1 (AY884001), HCoV-OC43 (KF923903), HCoV-NL63 (NC_005831) and HCoV-229E (KY983587). The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree revealed that COVID-19 is found in the same clade of SARS-CoV, thus the two strains are highly related to each other (Fig. 4) .\n\nThe immune response of T cell is considered as a long lasting response compared to B cell, where the antigen can easily escape the antibody memory response [76] . Vaccines that effectively generate cell-mediated response are needed to provide protection against the invading pathogen. Moreover the CD8+ T and CD4+ T cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity [77] . Thus designing vaccine against T cell is much more important.\n\nChoosing protein E as the antigenic site, the binding affinity to MHC molecules was then evaluated. The protein reference sequence was submitted to IEDB MHC predication tool. 21 peptides were found to bind MHC class I with different affinities (Table 1) , from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population percentage ( Table 2 ; Fig. 5 ).Analysis in IEDB MHC II binding prediction tool resulted in prediction of 61 peptides (Table 2) , from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population percentage (Table 3 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.934232 doi: bioRxiv preprint groove with MHC residues with least binding energy -13.2 kcal/mol, -11 kcal/mol and -11.3 kcal/mol, respectively (Fig.6C, D and E) .\n\nAlthough both flu and anti-HIV drugs are used currently in China for treatment of COVID-19, and chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, has recently found to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against 79] ; nevertheless more studies are required to standardize these therapies. In addition, there has been some success in the development of mouse models of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection, and candidate vaccines where the envelope (E) protein is mutated or deleted have been described [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] . To best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify certain peptides in envelope (E) protein as candidates for COVID-19. Accordingly, these epitopes were strongly recommended as promising epitopes vaccine candidate against T cell.\n\nExtensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered in COVID-19 strain using the comparative sequencing. In addition, a number of MHC class I and II related peptides were found promising candidates. Among which the peptides YVYSRVKNL, SLVKPSFYV and LAILTALRL show high potentiality for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage. T cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using envelope protein as an immunogenic target; nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically ensuring its safety and immunogenic profile to help on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.\n\nThe authors acknowledge the Deanship of Scientific Research at University of Bahri for the supportive cooperation.\n\nAll data underlying the results are available as part of the article, and no additional source data are required.
