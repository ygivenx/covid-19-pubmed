{"title": "A Serological Survey for Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus and Newcastle Disease Virus Antibodies in Backyard (Free- range) Village Chickens in Mexico", "body": "The two viruses that were the subject of this survey are extremely important pathogens of poultry responsible for diseases resulting in severe production and economic losses.\n\nInfectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of the Coronavirus genus of the family Coronaviridae and is distributed worldwide (Cavanagh and Naqi, 1997) . The \u00a2rst isolates were closely related to the Massachusetts strain, but subsequently several di\u00a1erent types were recognized in the United States, Europe and other parts of the world (McMartin, 1993) .\n\nOutbreaks of IB have been reported to occur in vaccinated \u00a3ocks, and virus strains isolated from these outbreaks are often found to be a type distinct from the vaccine type (Cavanagh and Naqi, 1997) .\n\nAmong respiratory diseases, IBV infections are known to be a frequent problem in every country that has a system of intensive poultry production. If IBV is not considered to be signi\u00a2cant in a particular country, this is generally because other diseases, such as Newcastle disease, pose a greater threat (Cook, 1995b) .\n\nAvian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) or Newcastle disease (NDV) is also distributed worldwide and is one of the major disease problems where it occurs. NDV is placed in the order Mononegavirales, family Paramyxoviridae, sub-family Paramyxovirinae, in the genus Rubulavirus (Rima et al., 1995) .\n\nBoth diseases have been diagnosed in Mexico and, in the case of IBV, this is despite vaccination of commercial birds, showing its great economic importance (Quiroz et al., 1993) .\n\nThe state of Yucatan, in the south-east of Mexico, has a unique geographical position. Being part of the peninsula with the same name, it is an important feeding stop for migratory birds, including waterfowl, travelling between North America and Central and South America. Yucatan was o\u00a4cially declared free of NDV in its velogenic viscerotropic form in 1995 and it has so far mantained this status. Very little evidence of the presence of this virus has been found in backyard chickens, by isolation or serology, although a proper study has not been carried out. Despite the absence of virulent virus, it would seem likely that village chickens become infected with ND viruses of low virulence for chickens, since such viruses are thought to be enzootic in wild birds (Alexander et al., 1997) , which are in constant contact with free-range chickens. On the other hand, antibodies to IBV were found in a large proportion (80%) of samples obtained from backyard chickens from two Yucatecan communities and processed at the Immunology Department of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, Autonomous University of Yucatan (FMVZ-UADY). One IBV isolate of unknown pathogenicity, but antigenically di\u00a1erent from 12 reference strains, was obtained from backyard chickens in Yucatan that were experiencing respiratory disease (Gutierrez-Ruiz et al., 1998) . Respiratory signs and egg-shell defects are commonly observed in backyard birds, suggesting active IBV infection.\n\nThe objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and distribution of antibodies against IBV and NDV in backyard chickens in the state of Yucatan, Mexico.\n\nThe approach followed to determine the sample size and design for the study was the cluster sampling method (Bennett et al., 1991; Thrus\u00a2eld, 1995; Cook, 1995a; Otte and Gumm, 1997) , because the individual sampling frame was not known.\n\nOwing to the characteristics of the backyard system, it is reasonable to consider all the backyard poultry in a village as one \u00a3ock, with very little within-cluster variation, so a village was considered as a cluster.\n\nIB and ND are very contagious diseases so, to obtain similar accuracy to that with random sampling (246 using 80% expected prevalence, 5% accuracy and 95% con\u00a2dence), the sample size had to be increased four times, to 984 samples (Martin et al., 1987) .\n\nThe number of clusters (villages) to be sampled was mostly controlled by the resources available (petrol, materials, time, etc.) . Thirty clusters were included in the present study. The aim was to sample 40 birds per village, resulting in 1200 samples, allowing around 20% more samples than required as backup.\n\nWith this information, the estimated design e\u00a1ect (D) and precision of the study were determined. For IBV the rate of homogeneity (roh) used for calculations was 0.20, as suggested by Otte and Gumm (1997) . The design e\u00a1ect was calculated from the formula (Bennett et al., 1991) \n\nwhere b is the average number of serum samples in each cluster.\n\nThe standard error (S) was calculated from the formula (Bennett et al., 1991) S p p1 \u00c0 pDan where p is the prevalence and n is the total number of samples to be obtained. The expected prevalence was 80%, as suggested by the preliminary study. S was determined as 3%, indicating that with this design there is a 95% certainty that the true proportion (prevalence) of chickens with antibodies to IBV will be within+6% (+2S) of the estimate. For NDV, the rate of homogeneity or intracluster correlation coe\u00a4cient was calculated in a previous study as 0.18 (Otte and Gumm, 1997) . Using the same formulae as for IBV, the design e\u00a1ect and precision (S) were calculated as D = 8.02, and S = 4%, using an expected prevalence of 50% to be on the safe side (Bennett et al., 1991) . With this design there is a 95% certainty that the true proportion of chickens with antibodies to NDV will be within+8% (+2S) of the estimate.\n\nA total of 1122 sera were obtained between December 1997 and June 1998. For NDV, only 970 samples were tested owing to the limited amount of serum obtained in some cases.\n\nThe prevalences were determined by dividing the total number of positive samples by the total number of samples (Bennett et al., 1991; Thrus\u00a2eld, 1995) . The con\u00a2dence intervals (p+2S) were calculated from the formula (Bennett et al., 1991) \n\nwhere c is the total number of clusters, X i is the number of samples from each cluster and Y i is the number of positive samples from each cluster.\n\nThe design e\u00a1ect and roh were estimated using the formulae given by Bennett and colleagues (1991) .\n\nThe clusters were selected randomly, using a random number table (Thrus\u00a2eld, 1995) and picking the selected numbers from a numbered list of communities with over 50 inhabitants obtained from the most recent Mexican national census (INEGI, 1991) . The state of Yucatan was divided into four regions (central, east, south-east and south) and clusters were selected in each region, using proportional strati\u00a2cation, taking a percentage of the samples according to the percentage of villages contained in each zone. Accordingly, 14 (46.6%) communities were sampled in the central zone, 6 (20%) communities were sampled in the east zone, and 5 (16.7%) in each of the south-east and south zones. The communities sampled in each zone are listed in Table I .\n\nTo select the samples within a village, two transects were chosen at random through the main square of the village, forming a cross. Although it was planned to select eight backyards per village, it usually took more than this to obtain the required number of samples, and, even so, 40 samples were not always obtained. In some cases, the nearest village to the one selected had to be sampled as well, considering both villages as one cluster. Taking the main square of the village as the reference, around 10 samples were collected from each of four directions. To achieve this, a predetermined number household (every Xth) was chosen for sampling. In cases (around 40%) where the selected household did not keep chickens or the owners did not wish to collaborate, the nearest household to it was approached. Usually 5 birds were sampled within each selected back yard.\n\nSampling procedure Between 0.5 and 2 ml of blood was obtained from the brachial vein of chickens over 12 weeks of age, using a 3 ml syringe and a 23 gauge needle. The blood was deposited in a 5 ml sterile glass tube, left horizontally for approximately 2^4 h in a cool box with coolant, and then placed vertically at 48C overnight. To obtain the maximum amount of serum, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 1000g. The serum was then collected and aliquoted into labelled 0.5 ml plastic vials.\n\nThe HI tests were done following the procedures described for IBV (Alexander et al., 1983) and for NDV (Council Directive 92/66/EEC, 1997), from a dilution of 1:2 to a dilution of 1:256, in the virology laboratory of the FMVZ-UADY. The antigens were diluted to contain four haemagglutination units (HAU). The titres were expressed as log 2 of the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum giving 100% inhibition of 4 HAU.\n\nIBV titres equal to or higher than 5 log 2 (1/32) and NDV titres equal to or higher than 4 log 2 (1/16) were considered positive.\n\nThe antigens were produced at the VLA, Weybridge, UK, by inoculation of seed viruses (IBV-M41 and NDV-Ulster strains) into the allantoic cavity of 9-to 11-day-old speci\u00a2c pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated hens' eggs (EHEs). The EHEs were incubated for 36^48 h (IBV) or 48^72 h (NDV) and the live embryos were then chilled at 48C for at least 6 h before the amnio-allantoic \u00a3uids (AAF) were aseptically harvested. The \u00a3uids were clari\u00a2ed by being centrifuged for 10 min at 5600g in a bench centrifuge (MSE, Mistral 1000). For IBV, the virus was pelleted by centrifuging the supernatant for 60 min at 48C and 32 000g in an ultracentrifuge (MSE, HI SPIN 21) with an 8650 ml rotor (Model 43114-143). The supernatants were discarded and the pellets were resuspended in a \u00a2ltrate of Clostridium perfringens type A toxin to 1/100 of the original volume; the suspensions were then incubated for 2 h at 378C. NDV was inactivated by adding formalin to the clari\u00a2ed AAF to give a \u00a2nal concentration of 0.1%, followed by incubation for 18^24 h at 378C, with constant stirring.\n\nAll 30 communities sampled had chickens that were positive for antibodies against IBV by the HIT. The design e\u00a1ect (D) was 4.9 and the roh was 0.1. The prevalences in each community are presented in Table I .\n\nNine (30%) of the 30 communities sampled had chickens that were positive for antibodies against NDV by the HIT. D was 3.5 and roh was 0.08. The prevalences in each community are presented in Table I .\n\nDespite the great importance of backyard chickens to a large proportion of the rural population in Mexico and many other developing countries, very little has been done to determine the health problems of these animals. As all the communities sampled in this study were positive for antibodies to IBV, and minimal vaccination is practised, it appears that IBV may be responsible for a considerable percentage of the respiratory disease that occurs in these birds, especially when combined with secondary bacterial pathogens, such as Escherichia coli or Mycoplasma (Honhold et al., 1993; Rivera-Ortega, 1997) . The seroprevalence for IBV (56.5% 95% CI 50^63%) found in this study may be an under estimate, since only one serotype was used as antigen, although the M41 serotype usually gives more cross-reactions than other serotypes (Alexander et al., 1976) . In a survey performed on free-range chickens in California, 46.7% of 30 \u00a3ocks examined and 21.8% of birds tested were positive for IBV antibodies by an ELISA test (McBride et al., 1991) . The seroprevalences were lower than in Yucatan, but the study conditions were di\u00a1erent and biosecurity measures in California are much stricter than in the backyards in Yucatan.\n\nThe IBV seroprevalences observed in individual communities in Yucatan were very variable (28.2^97.6%); this could have several explanations. It might be expected that chickens located in towns around which commercial farms are situated would have higher prevalences owing to more frequent contact with vaccine strains used in commercial enterprises, but the results with naive backyard chickens indicate that this was not the case. All the commercial farms are located in the central zone of the state of Yucatan, but only small di\u00a1erences in seroprevalence were observed in the four zones into which the state is divided. A more likely explanation for the variation in seroprevalence is that, although active vaccination is not practised in villages against any disease, it is known that local governments every now and then introduce into their communities packages consisting of 6^10 chickens of commercial lines (broilers or laying types) whose origins are di\u00a4cult to trace but which may be from the surplus at commercial hatcheries, where live IBV vaccines are usually applied to 1-day-old chicks. Another explanation could be that di\u00a1erent IBV variants of di\u00a1ering pathogenicity are distributed in Yucatan, some of which have higher transmission rates than others. Also, the sampling design used in this study, although adequate to determine the overall seroprevalence in the state, is not necessarily the best to determine the actual seroprevalence in the individual communities; a much larger sampling number would be needed to achieve this. Any or all of these factors may have been involved in producing the observed di\u00a1erences in prevalence.\n\nVery little is known about diseases in backyard chickens but, in a preliminary study carried out in Uganda, researchers found seroprevalences of 50^90% for IBV infections in village chickens from three di\u00a1erent areas of the country (Mukiibi-Muka and Olaho-Mukani, 1998) . This agrees with the \u00a2ndings of the present study in that IBV was widely distributed, not only where commercial chickens are present but also in free-range village chickens.\n\nDespite the wide distribution of IBV, it does not follow that highly pathogenic types are present in village chickens in Yucatan; serology is unable to demonstrate which types of IBV are present in an area, although this knowledge is indispensable in determining which vaccines, if any, should be used. Seven isolates of IBV were obtained during the survey and they will be characterized in order to determine their importance in backyard poultry in Yucatan, Mexico.\n\nThe low seroprevalence (2.2%) (95% CI 0.5^3.9%) of NDV in backyard chickens in the state of Yucatan supports the status of the state as being free from the velogenic viscerotropic form of NDV.\n\nEleven of the 21 positive sera had ND HI titres of only 4 log 2 (1/16), with 5 of 9 towns having only one reactor. This suggests that these may have been false positive results or perhaps that the birds were derived from those distributed by the government and vaccinated with live attenuated vaccines as day-old chicks. Three towns had chickens with titres of log 2 57, and, although the owners of these birds stated that they had not been vaccinated against NDV, there is a possibility that some of them had been vaccinated with more than one dose of vaccine before being introduced into the towns by the respective local governments. Another possible explanation of the results is that a slow circulation of \u00a2eld virus was occurring at the time of sampling, although no isolations were made. The low prevalence or absence in the HI test of detectable antibodies to NDV in the 30 communities sampled indicates that the backyard chickens in those communities would be highly susceptible to pathogenic NDV infections (Allan and Gough, 1974) . In their serological study in Uganda, Mukiibi-Muka and Olaho-Mukani (1998) found that the birds from one village out of the three sampled did not have antibodies to NDV, which indicates that, even in enzootic areas, some villages can remain fully susceptible to infection with virulent NDV. A seroprevalence of 4% was found in free-range chickens in California using an ELISA test (McBride et al., 1991) . Conditions were di\u00a1erent from those in Mexico but, despite there being no con\u00a2rmation of transmission between commercial and backyard \u00a3ocks, these researchers pointed out that the disease status could change at any time owing to lack of immunity and that therefore biosecurity measures should be reinforced (McBride et al., 1991) .\n\nIt is popular knowledge, as described by some researchers (Honhold et al., 1993) , that every now and then in many communities in the state of Yucatan there is a syndrome known as mortandad, whereby most birds in an entire village die in a short period of time, sometimes without signs of disease, although often respiratory and enteric signs are observed. The cause or causes of this syndrome have not yet been identi\u00a2ed, but highly virulent NDV may be one of the agents responsible; certainly the serological evidence and the constant contact between backyard chickens and wild birds makes this a viable possibility.\n\nRivera-Ortega, J.T., 1997.

Un estudio de sero-prevalencia en 30 pueblos usando las pruebas de inhibicion para la hemaglutinacion para el virus de la bronquitis infecciosa (VBI) y VEN se llevo a cabo de diciembre de 1997 a junio de 1998. Las sero-prevalencias fueron 56,5% (IC 95%, 50^63%) para VBI y 2,2% (IC 95%, 0,53 ,8%) para VEN. Todos los poblados tuvieron pollos positivos a anticuerpos contra VBI y 9 de 30 poblados tuvieron pollos positivos a anticuerpos contra VEN. Lo anterior sugiere que el VBI pudiera ser responsable de una alta proporcion de las enfermedades respiratorias observadas en pollos de traspatio en Yucatan, Mexico. Se discuten las implicaciones de estos hallazgos incluyendo la alta susceptibilidad de los pollos de traspatio en Yucatan al VEN y la posibilidad de que este virus sea una de las causas del sindrome conocido como`mortandad' por la gente local."}
