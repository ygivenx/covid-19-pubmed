{"title": "Flagging and Docking: dual roles for N-glycans in protein quality control and cellular proteostasis NIH Public Access Author Manuscript N-glycans on ER-resident proteins: regulating ERAD and ERAD tuning", "body": "vesicles, or select terminally misfolded proteins for ERAD, has been widely covered in recent reviews [3] [4] [5] [6] . By contrast, the focus of this Opinion is the discussion of a newly discovered role of N-glycans in cellular proteostasis: the involvement of oligosaccharides that are displayed on ER-resident members of quality control and ERAD machineries in promoting assembly of supramolecular complexes. These complexes play crucial roles in inspecting the content of the ER lumen to aid in the clearance of defective gene products, orphan subunits of oligomeric complexes, and metabolically-regulated proteins. The intraluminal level of misfolded polypeptides might modulate their formation and stability in a substrate-dependent feedback mechanism that eventually determines cellular ERAD activity.\n\nN-glycans on cargo proteins: maturation, quality control and sorting signals Cycles of glucose removal and re-addition, which begin shortly after the glycan is transferred to the nascent chain, or the delayed trimming of mannose residues, determine whether the associated polypeptides will be retained by the folding machinery or selected for ERAD, respectively.\n\nThe A-branch or glucose-containing arm of N-linked glycans ( Figure 1 ) recruits molecular chaperones that assist in the efficient folding of glycoproteins 2, 7 . The terminal glucose residue n of the transferred triglucosylated glycan is rapidly removed by \u03b1-glucosidase I, which is associated with the translocon complex. Malectin, a Glc 2 -binding protein, might then intervene to retain immature and/or misfolded polypeptides in the ER 8, 9 . Removal of the glucose m by the \u03b1-glucosidase II, a luminal heterodimeric enzyme, supports co-or post-translational association of folding polypeptides with the ER lectins calnexin and calreticulin 2, 7 . The oxidoreductase ERp57 and the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase cyclophilin B are associated with calnexin and calreticulin, and they catalyze rate-limiting folding reactions to facilitate attainment of the native structure 10, 11 . Removal of the innermost glucose residue l by \u03b1-glucosidase II dissociates the polypeptide from the calnexin/ calreticulin chaperone system. At this stage, UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 (UGT1) inspects the structure of the released proteins. Non-native polypeptides are reglucosylated by UGT1, initiating rebinding to the lectin chaperones and their associated folding factors. Native polypeptides are not recognized by UGT1 and are secreted 12 . Depending on the glycoprotein substrate, one or more bind-and-release events might be required to attain the correct conformation [13] [14] [15] .\n\nStudies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that the Mns1p (mannosidase 1) removes mannose residue i from the B-branch of protein-linked oligosaccharides (Figure 1) 5 . For properly folded secretory proteins, this allows the binding of cargo lectin sorting receptors, which regulate the export of native conformers from the ER 16 . For folding-defective polypeptides, removal of mannose i is followed by the removal of at least one additional \u03b11,2-linked mannose residue (mannose k, branch C) by Htm1p, which forms a functional complex with the oxidoreductase Pdi1p 17 . This trimming event exposes the \u03b11,6-linked mannose j, which is recognized by the mannose-6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH) domain of the ERAD lectin Yos9p [17] [18] [19] .\n\nIn mammalian cells, de-mannosylation of folding-defective polypeptides might be more extensive, with removal of up to 4 \u03b11,2-linked mannose residues. As in budding yeast, the ER mannosidase I (Mns1p orthologue) catalyses removal of the mannose residue i. If misfolding persists, N-linked glycans are further processed by EDEM1 and EDEM3 (ERdegradation enhancing mannosidase-like proteins and Htm1p/Htm2p orthologues) or by another resident \u03b11,2 mannosidase ( Figure 2 , steps 1 and 2, respectively). Demonstration of mannosidase activity with purified EDEM1 and EDEM3 is still lacking, and the role of a third EDEM variant, EDEM2, in ERAD is even less characterized [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . It should therefore be considered that proteins of the EDEM family could operate as mannose-binding lectins associating with de-mannosylated oligosaccharides generated by extensive processing in a sub-region of the ER that is populated with high ER mannosidase I concentrations (i.e. the ER quality control compartment or ERQC, discussed in 3, 5 ).\n\nIn the mannose timer model of glycoprotein quality control 26 , the extensive substrate demannosylation provides two signals that flag misfolded proteins for disposal. Removal of mannose g, the acceptor for the reglucosylating activity of UGT1 (which is absent in budding yeast), irreversibly extracts the folding-defective polypeptide from the calnexin/ calreticulin cycle to mark the end of the folding phase for maturing nascent chains 22 ( Figure  2 , step 2, note that mannose f can also eventually be removed). Removal of mannose k exposes the \u03b11,6-linked mannose j, thereby recruiting the ERAD MRH-containing lectins OS-9 and XTP3-B, which are expressed in several splice variants in the mammalian ER [27] [28] [29] [30] (Figure 2 , steps 2-6).\n\nAccumulating evidence reveals that de-mannosylating and mannose-binding ERAD factors reside in complexes with other luminal ER-resident proteins. For example, EDEM1 associates with BiP (immunoglobulin binding protein), which possibly contributes to the recognition of non-native polypeptides, and with ERdj5, which might facilitate ERAD by reducing inter-and intramolecular disulfides of ERAD candidates 31 ( Figure 2 ). Interactions between OS-9 or XTP3-B with BiP or GRP94, respectively, have also been reported 27, 32 . Participation in such multi-protein complexes might explain the findings that EDEM proteins and OS-9 and XTP3-B variants also associate or regulate ER retention and disposal of non-glycosylated folding-defective polypeptides 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 33 .\n\nEDEM1, EDEM3, OS-9 and XTP3-B also interact with the type I membrane glycoprotein SEL1L (Hrd3p in yeast) 24, 27, [34] [35] [36] [37] . SEL1L nucleates interactions between these luminal ERAD components and a supramolecular membrane complex containing the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1 that regulates dislocation across the ER membrane and polyubiquitylation of ERAD substrates 24, 27, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] (Figure 2 , steps 3, 6, 8 and 10). In the next section, we explain how the glycan-mediated interactions between EDEM1/EDEM3/OS-9/XTP3-B and SEL1 regulate cellular proteostasis in metazoans by modulating clearance of misfolded polypeptides (ERAD) and removal of ERAD factors from the ER lumen (ERAD tuning).\n\nAlthough the proteins that act early in the secretory pathway tend to be non-glycosylated (e.g. the nascent chain interacting proteins Sec61\u03b1, BiP, PDI, malectin, calnexin and ERp57), several factors that function post-translationally for quality control and ERAD (e.g. EDEM proteins, OS-9, XTP3-B and SEL1L) are glycosylated. Whether glycosylation plays a role in the segregation or organization of ER factors into specialized complexes or subregions within the ER is unknown. With the exception of EDEM1, for which N-glycans mediate the transient association with calnexin that is required for efficient maturation 39 , the role of the N-linked oligosaccharides in the biogenesis of ER-resident chaperones has not been studied. By contrast, several recent studies have revealed the crucial role of oligosaccharides that are displayed on ER-resident quality control factors in the formation of functional supramolecular complexes 24, 27, [34] [35] [36] [37] .\n\nAffinity-tagged ERAD factors have been used as baits to characterize interacting components of multimeric ERAD complexes 38, 40 . Christianson et al. used this approach to confirm that a prominent interactor of the type I membrane protein SEL1L is the membraneembedded E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1 27 . These studies also revealed an association of SEL1L with the luminal MRH-containing proteins OS-9 and XTP3-B. Additional studies have discovered that the mannosidase-like domain-containing proteins EDEM1 and EDEM3 also interact with SEL1L 24, 35, 37 . Disruption of the EDEM1, EDEM3, OS-9 or XTP3-B oligosaccharide-binding motifs, or cell treatment with kifunensine (an inhibitor of demannosylation of protein bound oligosaccharides), decreases the association of these ERAD factors with the penta-glycosylated protein SEL1L 24, 27, 29, 30, 34, 35, 41, 42 . Altogether, these data reveal that EDEM1, EDEM3, OS-9 and XTP3-B activity is not restricted to oligosaccharides displayed on folding-defective polypeptides as described in the mannose timer model of glycoprotein quality control (Figure 2, routes A and B) . Rather, these luminal ERAD factors might also engage SEL1L oligosaccharides to dock at the HRD1 dislocation complex (Figure 2 , routes C and D; docking model). This facilitates delivery of ERAD substrates to dislocation sites and their transport across the ER membrane for their eventual proteasomal degradation. Several reports also reveal oligosaccharide-independent association of EDEM proteins, OS-9 and XTP3-B with misfolded proteins 22, 24, 25, 27-29, 33, 43, 44 (Figure 2 , routes C and D) or with SEL1L 36 (Figure 2 , routes A and B). This shows that the mode of binding of these ER lectins might be affected by the presence of associated partners such as BiP or GRP94.\n\nThe control of the luminal concentration and activity of ERAD factors is important for maintenance of cellular proteostasis. Misregulated ERAD might select on-pathway folding intermediates for degradation before they are given a sufficient opportunity to reach their native structure ( 45 and references therein). For example, aberrantly high levels of the ER E3 ligases HRD1 and gp78 cause the inappropriate degradation of individual gene products and are associated with rheumatoid arthritis and highly metastatic sarcoma, respectively 46, 47 . The concept of ERAD tuning 45 is based on emerging evidences showing that a growing number of ERAD factors, including ER mannosidase I, HERP, gp78, JAMP, EDEM1, OS-9, and SEL1L, are constitutively removed from the unstressed ER 37, 48-54 . Luminal expression of misfolded proteins might inactivate the constitutive removal of select ERAD factors from the ER and stabilize complexes between ERAD regulatory components. This might enhance ERAD in the absence of unfolded protein response (UPR) activation. This implies the existence of ERAD substrate-dependent feedback mechanisms that rapidly adapt ERAD activity to the misfolded protein load 37 .\n\nThe association of EDEM1 and OS-9 with SEL1L regulates delivery of ERAD substrates to the HRD1 dislocon ( Figure 2 ). However, in the absence of ERAD substrates, the ERAD tuning pathways are activated. SEL1L is disengaged from inactive dislocons. Under these circumstances, the cytosolic tail of SEL1L (or a SEL1L-associated protein) recruits the ubiquitin-like protein LC3-I to build a membrane-bound receptor that regulates the selective and constitutive clearance of SEL1L-associated OS-9 and EDEM1 from the unstressed ER (Figure 3) 37 . These receptor:ligand complexes enter so called ERAD tuning vesicles, which lack a coatomer coat and are larger than the COPII vesicles that ferry cargo proteins from the ER to the Golgi 37, 48, 49, 55 . ERAD tuning vesicles contain up to 80% of the cellular EDEM1 in unstressed cells 33, 48, 55 , but much less in cells expressing ERAD substrates, which substantially inhibit the removal of ERAD factors from the ER 37 . They eventually deliver OS-9, EDEM1, the short-living ER mannosidase I, and possibly other SEL1Linteracting ERAD factors such as XTP3-B and EDEM3 to an ill-defined endo-lysosomal degradative organelle. In summary, the presence or absence of misfolded polypeptides might determine whether the lectin-glycan association with SEL1L drives ERAD substrate progression downstream through the ERAD pathway or directs the removal of ERAD lectins from the ER.\n\nThe role of oligosaccharides as folding and quality control tags that regulate protein biogenesis in the ER of eukaryotic cells has been studied extensively over the past two decades. The glycosidases and glycosyltransferases that process protein-bound oligosaccharides, the lectins engaged by the different oligosaccharide structures, and the role of each trimming intermediate in protein quality control have been characterized. In this Opinion, we propose a new unified model for the role of glycans in protein quality control that combines components of the mannose timer and docking models. The mannose timer model shows how N-linked glycans can act as flags that signal terminally misfolded polypeptides to be degraded by recruiting ERAD lectins. N-linked glycans can also support lectin-oligosaccharides interactions between components of the ERAD machinery as demonstrated in the docking model 24, 27, [34] [35] [36] [37] . These associations drive progression of substrates along the ERAD pathway or promote removal of ERAD factors from the ER lumen for ERAD tuning in the absence of misfolded polypeptides. Upon accumulation of terminally misfolded polypeptides and under stress conditions where the UPR is activated, the formation and the stability of active dislocation machineries would be favored to ensure the rapid turnover of aberrant cargo. This implies a model of Nglycoprotein processing in the ER that includes the regulatory tuning of ERAD components by a substrate-dependent feedback mechanism. A substrate-dependent feedback mechanism has been proposed in yeast, where the activity of the EDEM1 orthologue Htm1p is enhanced upon misfolded polypeptide-induced formation of a functional complex between the mannosidase and Pdi1p 17 .\n\nA unified carbohydrate quality control model explains the recognition of oligosaccharides as flags and docking sites by the ERAD lectins. With the exception of XTP3-B (which has two separate MRH domains), all other ERAD lectins or lectin-like proteins have only one oligosaccharide-binding domain and therefore cannot simultaneously recognize the flag that indicates the folding state of cargo and the glycosylated docking site on a protein such as SEL1L. It will be important to determine the quaternary structure of the ERAD lectin complexes. If organized in oligomers, the presence of multiple glycan binding sites would support the recognition of oligosaccharide flags on misfolded polypeptides and of docking oligosaccharides on the dislocation machinery at the ER membrane by individual ERAD lectin complexes. The resolution of this issue and other open questions (Box 1) might aid in the design of approaches that will support the intervention in protein misfolding diseases or help optimize the production of ectopic proteins used in clinics or industry.\n\n\u2022 Are the processes of protein folding, quality control and degradation segregated into separate domains within the ER? If so, how are folding, quality control and ERAD factors segregated and retained in sub-compartments (e.g. the ER quality control compartment (ERQC))? How are cargo proteins delivered to functionally distinct regions within the ER?\n\n\u2022 How are non-native on-pathway folding intermediates that should be retained in the folding environment distinguished from terminally misfolded proteins that should be degraded?\n\n\u2022 How many different ERAD pathways exist and what are the misfolded determinants of cargo proteins that elicit intervention of components of specific ERAD pathways?\n\n\u2022 How are misfolded proteins delivered to and dislocated across the ER membrane? For example, is unfolding of the ERAD substrates (e.g. reduction of disulfides, or cis to trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds) required? What is the nature of the dislocation channel?\n\n\u2022 Do the EDEM family of proteins act as mannosidases or lectins? How do they recognize substrates?\n\n\u2022 Are EDEM2 and EDEM3 also found in complexes with chaperones?\n\n\u2022 What are the compositions of the individual glycans of the ERAD factors such as SEL1L/Hrd3p, EDEMs, OS-9/Yos9p and XTP3-B? Are their glycan compositions regulated?\n\n\u2022 How are ERAD tuning pathways regulated at the molecular level?\n\n\u2022 How are ERAD tuning pathways hijacked by pathogens?\n\n\u2022 What is the complete composition of the ERAD tuning vesicles?\n\n\u2022 Is there crosstalk between ERAD and autophagy, the two major cellular degradative pathways?\n\nER-degradation enhancing mannosidase-like proteins. Their intraluminal concentration is regulated by ERAD tuning and by UPR. They determine the rate of glycoproteins disposal.

OS-9 recognizes proteins possessing oligosaccharides that expose a terminal \u03b11,6-mannose residue 19, 29 . The intraluminal concentration of OS-9 is regulated by ERAD tuning, and it can be substantially increased upon UPR activation 37 \n\nA mammalian ERAD lectin containing two MRH domains, which is expressed as two spliced variants 41\n\nThe Asn-linked glycan is composed of three glucoses (orange triangles), nine mannoses (blue circles) and two N-acetylglucosamines (green squares). The types of linkages between sugars are denoted and each residue is assigned a letter.\n\nVarious models for the delivery of ERAD substrates to an ER membrane ERAD complex are depicted. The letters A-D designate the different routes for a misfolded substrate. The glycan attached to an ERAD substrate (black sinuous line) is trimmed of a mannose residue by ER mannosidase I (ER Man I, step 1). This is followed by EDEM1 recognition. EDEM1 is present in a complex with ERdj5 and BiP. In the mannose timer model, EDEM1 acts as a mannosidase to trim additional mannose residues (step 2). (A) ERAD substrates are directly recognized by SEL1L (step 3). OS-9/XTP3-B associate with SEL1L to act as ERAD gatekeepers by querying the ERAD substrate for exposed \u03b11,6-linked mannose residues. If the protein possesses the proper glycans, it is passed along the ERAD pathway (step 4). (B) Alternatively, trimmed ERAD substrates are recognized by OS-9/XTP3-B (step 5) and delivered to the ERAD membrane complex (step 6). (C) and (D) depict glycan docking models for OS-9/XTP3-B and EDEM1, respectively. For C, OS-9/XTP3-B recognize the misfolded substrates through protein-protein interactions (step 7). This can involve associated co-factors such as GRP94. OS-9-XTP3-B then deliver the ERAD substrate to the ER membrane ERAD complex by binding to the glycans on the adapter SEL1L (step 8) or on a glycosylated SEL1L associated protein. For D, the EDEM1 complex associates with ERAD substrates (step 9). EDEM1 employs its mannosidase-like domain to deliver the The receptor-mediated removal of EDEM1 and OS-9 from the ER lumen is shown. In the absence of misfolded proteins, SEL1L is disengaged from the HRD1 dislocation machinery. The penta-glycosylated ectodomain of SEL1L associates with EDEM1 and OS-9 (step 1). The cytosolic tail of SEL1L or a SEL1L-associated protein binds the cytosolic ubiquitin-like protein LC3-I. The complex is released from the ER in vesicles (steps 3 and 4) that may eventually fuse with an ill-defined degradative compartment. ERAD tuning vesicles are coopted by coronaviruses as replication and transcription platform vesicles."}
