{"title": "Infection control in paediatric office settings", "body": "Infection control programs are designed to reduce the risk of transmission so that it is at an acceptable level. The consequences of transmission in terms of infection severity and outcome must be weighed against the consequences of preventive measures taken. Practices must be tailored to the level of care being provided and the patient population served (1).\n\nPrevention of transmission of infection and maintaining a child-friendly office may be opposing goals. Physicians must decide whether the benefits of an office in which children are free to play with each other, share toys, and generally have fun and practice their social skills, outweigh the risks of the infections that may be acquired there.\n\nMost reported infections acquired in ambulatory care have been the result of procedures performed there \u2013 abscesses after injection of contaminated vaccines or medications, viral conjunctivitis from contaminated ophthalmic equipment, transmission of blood-borne viruses from inadequately sterilized equipment, infections complicating out-patient surgery, and infections related to inadequate decontamination of endoscopes (7,8). Hepatitis B and C viruses have been transmitted by contamination of multi-dose vials or due to the use of the same physical space to prepare, dismantle and dispose of injection equipment (9).\n\nMeasles has been transmitted in paediatricians\u2019 offices. In the 1980s, a large proportion of all cases of measles in the United States were acquired in ambulatory care settings (7,8). Transmission by contaminated air alone was documented in two paediatric office outbreaks (10,11). There are reports of transmission of tuberculosis from physicians to patients in paediatricians\u2019 offices (12,13).\n\nTransmission of infections common in the community, such as varicella, pertussis, and viral respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, almost certainly occur in physicians\u2019 offices but has not been reported, perhaps because of the difficulty in distinguishing between office and community exposures. Young children have four to 10 respiratory infections and up to four episodes of gastroenteritis per year (14,15). They may acquire infection in day care, school, crowded shopping malls or recreational centres, or from siblings, parents, other family contacts, friends or caregivers. Only one published study has assessed risk of infection after a visit to a paediatric office. Rates of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in healthy children younger than three years of age who had visited the office over the preceding week were compared with infection rates in control children from the same paediatric practice who had not visited the office over the preceding week. There was no increased risk of infection; 30% of those who had visited the office and 32% of those who had not visited, developed an infection (16). A pilot study (17) at the Montreal Children\u2019s Hospital (Montreal, Quebec) did not find a significant difference in rates of new infections between children who had visited the emergency room over the previous week (17.5%) and those who had not (22.1%).\n\nYoung children and others who are unable to appropriately handle their respiratory secretions, children with diarrhea who are in diapers or incontinent, and those with infected open wounds or skin lesions are likely to be sources of infection (18).\n\nOrganisms that can survive on patient care equipment, environmental surfaces or toys are likely to be passed between patients. Heavy environmental contamination enhances transmission potential, as does a low infective dose. Respiratory viruses and rotavirus have low infective doses and persist for prolonged periods on inanimate objects (19\u201324). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (25) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (26) survive on stethoscope diaphragms. Transmission of RSV from the inanimate environment has been demonstrated (27). Contaminated electronic thermometer bases and blood pressure cuffs have been implicated in the transmission of Clostridium difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) (28\u201330).\n\nChildren who lack immunity to the infecting agent and those who are ill, debilitated or immunocompromised are at increased risk for disease.\n\nThe risk of transmission between patients may be less in an office than on a hospital ward. In offices, the duration of contact between individuals is shorter, patients are generally in better health and fewer invasive procedures are performed. However, patients may remain in crowded common waiting areas for prolonged periods of time; it may not be immediately recognized that a patient has a contagious illness and the need for short turnaround time for examination rooms may hamper cleaning (4). Some practices have chosen to eliminate waiting rooms and place patients directly into examination rooms on arrival (31).\n\nThe current guidelines for the prevention of transmission of infection are based on the following principles:\n\nContact transmission is the most frequent route and includes direct contact (physical contact between infected and susceptible patients) and indirect contact (via contaminated intermediate surfaces such as hands, equipment and toys). Appropriate routine patient care practices should prevent most transmission by this route. Additional Contact Precautions (wearing gloves and gowns, and disinfection of equipment and surfaces) are warranted for infectious agents of low infective doses (eg, rotavirus) and for situations in which extensive contamination of the patient\u2019s environment is expected (eg, watery diarrhea which cannot be contained within a diaper, or a young child with respiratory infection and copious respiratory tract secretions).\n\nDroplet transmission refers to transmission by large droplets that are expelled from the respiratory tract during coughing and sneezing, and inhaled by or deposited onto the respiratory mucous membranes of persons close to the infected child. Special ventilation is not required because the large droplets do not stay suspended in the air, but settle on surfaces close to the source patient. Surgical or procedure masks are recommended for those within 1 m of the patient. Some organisms transmitted by this route (eg, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis and Bordetella pertussis) are very fragile and do not survive in the environment or on hands.\n\nOther organisms such as RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, adenovirus and SARS coronavirus survive long enough on surfaces to be picked up on hands of patients or personnel. For these, droplet and contact transmission occurs. Thus, respiratory viruses may be transmitted by inhalation, by deposition of large droplets onto mucous membranes or by inoculation of nasal mucosa or conjunctiva by contaminated hands. Surgical or procedure masks protect personnel from acquisition by deposition of droplets, and may also help to keep the hands away from the nose and mouth. Eye shields give added protection against infection via the conjunctiva. Face shields or goggles have been shown to prevent RSV infection in health care personnel (34,35). RSV transmission to personnel was also reduced by the use of gloves in the absence of masks and eye protection, probably because personnel were less likely to touch their noses or eyes with gloved hands, suggesting that for RSV, contact transmission may be more important than droplet transmission (36,37).\n\nAirborne transmission occurs when infectious particles survive in aerosols of small desiccated droplets from the respiratory tract or from skin squames which remain suspended in the air and are dispersed over large distances by air currents. Control requires a negative-pressure room with air exhausted outside the building or passed through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter before recirculation. Special tight-fitting masks with built in filters that remove particles down to 1 \u03bc diameter at a 95% efficacy (N95) are recommended for susceptible persons who must enter the room. Airborne transmission is uncommon but important because varicella, measles, tuberculosis and smallpox are spread by this route. Although evidence suggests that SARS coronavirus is transmitted by large droplet and contact spread, it is thought that small particle aerosols may be generated during certain procedures such as intubation or bronchoscopy (4,38).\n\nN95 masks are rarely needed in paediatricians\u2019 offices. Personnel should be immune to varicella and measles; tuberculosis in children is rarely contagious (2). Tuberculosis should be considered contagious in those with untreated cavitary pulmonary disease, laryngeal disease, smear-positive sputum, extensive lung involvement or disseminated congenital infection (39). In the event of an outbreak of a new pathogen such as SARS, or a re-emergence of smallpox, N95 masks may be indicated.\n\nPrevention of acquisition of infection from the inanimate environment involves appropriate disinfection and sterilization of equipment and other items, cleaning of surfaces and maintenance of ventilation and plumbing.\n\nFor purposes of processing, medical equipment is classified into three groups. Items that are introduced into sterile body spaces (critical) must be sterile. Items in contact with mucous membranes or nonintact skin or through which inspired air flows (semicritical) require high-level disinfection designed to inactivate all microorganisms except bacterial spores. Items that are only in contact with intact skin (noncritical) require low-level disinfection designed to remove most microrganisms and bring contamination to an acceptable level (2\u20135,40,41).\n\nMost examination equipment in an office setting is in contact with only the intact skin of the patient. Some experts have suggested that cleaning with detergent and water is sufficient for noncritical equipment (6,40,42). A disinfectant should be used if the equipment is contaminated with blood or body fluid. Ideally, all such equipment should be cleaned between patients (1,2,6). If this is not feasible, daily cleaning may suffice, but equipment must be cleaned before reuse if it is contaminated with patient secretions or excretions or if visibly soiled (1\u20133). Equipment that does not have direct patient contact should be cleaned on a routine basis and if soiled.\n\nEnvironmental surfaces should be cleaned on a routine basis, with a low-level disinfectant or detergent (2,3,5,40,41). Frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned daily (2,3). Cleaning with detergent and water may suffice, unless surfaces are contaminated with blood or body fluids (2,40,41) (Table 2).\n\nPlaying together and sharing of toys contribute to the child\u2019s development of social skills. Toys may be considered as part of the equipment of a paediatrician\u2019s office, but sharing of toys poses a potential health risk. Microbial contamination of toys has been documented in hospitals, physician\u2019s offices and day care centres (43\u201345). Fecal coliforms and rotavirus have been found on toys in day care centres and in hospital (46,47).\n\nIn one study (48) in doctors\u2019 offices, toys in waiting rooms were tested at least one week after the last cleaning. Coliforms were found on 90% of soft toys and 13.5% of hard toys. Hard toys that had been cleaned regularly every one to two weeks had lower counts than those from offices with no routine cleaning, while soft toys cleaned every one to two weeks had similar counts to those not cleaned. Hard toys were effectively decontaminated by cleaning and soaking for 1 h in a bleach solution. Soft toys washed in a washing machine remained contaminated, but soaking in bleach for 30 min before washing was effective. By one week of use, soft toys were again contaminated with coliforms, whereas hard toys were not. The authors concluded that soft toys were unsuitable for doctors\u2019 waiting rooms (48).\n\nIn the guidelines published in 2000 (42), the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended cleaning of toys in offices. In response to these recommendations, some paediatricians eliminated toys from their waiting rooms, finding the cleaning and monitoring of toy use too arduous (49). Physicians must consider the needs of children when weighing the risks and benefits of having toys in their offices.\n\nToy manufacturers have incorporated antiseptics into plastic toys. There is no evidence that this practice has an impact on contamination of toys with microorganisms or on transmission of infection, nor is there any theoretical basis to support such effects (2,41).\n\nHand hygiene is a crucial element in infection control. Traditionally this has been performed with soap and water. Alcohol-based hand rinses and gels have been shown to be more effective than soap and water for removing micro-organisms from hands, and they also save time (1,2,50). Small containers which may be carried in the pocket or clipped to the clothing are readily available for use when needed.\n\nTriage should be performed by telephone at the time the appointment is made or as soon as possible after arrival (2\u20136).\n\nRespiratory Etiquette refers to measures designed to minimize the transmission of respiratory pathogens via the droplet route in health care settings, using source containment beginning at the point of initial patient encounter (2,4,5,54). These measures include:"}
