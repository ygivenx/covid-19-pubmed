{"title": "COVID-19 infection induces readily detectable morphological and inflammation-related phenotypic changes in peripheral blood monocytes, the severity of which correlate with patient outcome", "body": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is a new coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which frequently induces fatal inflammatory responses and acute lung injury. 1, 2 As of March 20 2020 a total of 245,484 confirmed cases have been reported worldwide, with an estimated mortality of 4% (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).\n\nPatients experience a spectrum of disease from a mild illness, through varying severity of pneumonia all the way to ARDS and sepsis with multi-organ failure and death. Initial clinical features at disease onset are fever (77-98%), dry cough (46-82%), myalgia or fatigue (11-52%) and dyspnea (3-31%) . 3 The majority of patients develop pneumonia, which can proceed in up to 20-30% of cases to respiratory failure requiring intubation and ventilatory support. In those COVID-19 patients who go on to develop pneumonia, dyspnea develops a median of 8 days after onset of illness. Radiographic abnormalities (CT or chest x-ray) consisting of ground-glass opacities and focal consolidation are seen in patients with pneumonia. Major causes of death include respiratory failure and myocardial damage due to myocarditis. Acute kidney injury, secondary infection and coagulopathy are each seen in approximately 50% of non-survivors. Mortality increases with age and in patients with underlying co-morbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, chronic lung disease, and cancer. According to a recent retrospective report from Wuhan, clinical predictors of increased mortality on multivariate analysis included advanced age, progressive organ failure and elevated D-Dimers on admission. 4 Other factors significantly associated with poor outcome on univariate analysis included elevated levels of serum ferritin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), Alanine amino transferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and highly sensitive cardiac Troponin I, as well as reduced levels of lymphocytes, Hemoglobin (Hb), Platelets and serum albumin.\n\nThe best recognized hematologic abnormality is lymphopenia, which is seen in up to 85% of severe cases with the severity of lymphopenia linked to outcome. 5 Since regulatory T cells play an important role in dampening the immune response, excessive elimination of these cells could result in an unchecked innate immune responses, leading to an uncontrolled inflammatory response. 5 Indeed, there is growing evidence implicating excessive monocyte/macrophage activation and associated cytokine storm with the pathophysiology of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease related complications. 6 Despite this, there are few reports to date relating to abnormalities of monocytes in patients with COVID-19. Herein we describe novel observations in relation to changes in monocyte morphology and activation status, which correlate with the prognosis and severity of COVID-19 infection and which can be readily quantified by flow cytometry with the concurrent measurement of forward scatter (FSC) and (SSC), which measure cell size and complexity, respectively. Specifically, we have identified the presence of a population of monocytes with higher FSC than normal (FSC-high) not typically seen in other types of viral infection.\n\nFurther analysis reveals that these FSC-high monocytes express CD14, CD11b, as well as CD16 along with markers associated with both M1 and M2 polarization, and secrete IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha.\n\nIn this study, 28 cases of COVID-19 were from Xi'an No.8 Hospital (Shaanxi Provincial Infectious Disease Hospital) and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, which are the designated hospital for COVID-19 by the local government (Shaanxi province, China).

Survival curves were obtained for both groups and log-rank test was implemented to examine the statistical significance of the difference in survival curves for the two groups. Similar analysis was also conducted for FSC-low/FSC-high monocytes. In addition, Cox models were also fitted to adjust the potential effects of age and gender.\n\nStatistics values are presented as means \u00b1 SD. Data were analyzed by using GraphPad Prism version 6.04 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical significance was calculated by Student's unpaired t-test, where differences at P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nTo better understand the impact on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, we originally sought to investigate changes of immune cells in the peripheral blood in COVID-19 patients using flow cytometry. Unexpectedly, in all tested COVID-19 patients, we found the presence of a specific population right next to the population of monocytes (FSC-high), when using the FSC and SSC parameters ( Figure 1A ). In contrast, this population is virtually absent in healthy donors, ( Figure 1B -C).\n\nTo validate the nature of the FSC-high population, we further performed Wright-Giemsa staining on blood smears. As shown in Figure 1D , we confirmed the presence of an increased number of larger, atypical, vacuolated monocytes, not normally seen in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals. Table   1 , shows that while the total number of monocytes/macrophages in the peripheral did not differ between patients and a healthy donor, there was an increased proportion of activated monocytes/macrophages in patients with COVID-19.\n\nNext, we analyzed the expression of the phenotypic markers on the FSC-high population using flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 2A -B, these cells are strongly positive for CD14 and CD16, suggesting that they belong to the monocyte lineage. More importantly, macrophage markers CD11b, CD68, CD80, CD163, CD206 are all expressed in this population. Since CD80 is considered a marker typical of M1 polarization, and CD163 and CD206 are considered to be typical of M2 polarization, it suggests that the FSC-high population contains both M1 and M2 macrophages. To further confirm this suspicion, we performed intracellular staining to validate the expression of M1/M2-specific cytokines in the FSC-high cells. As shown in Figure 2C -D, M1-specific cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were found to be secreted, while on the other hand, the M2-specific cytokine IL-10 was also expressed by cells in the FSC-high population. Collectively, these findings strongly support that the FSC-high population in COVID-19 are composed of macrophages that have a mixed M1 and M2 polarization. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042655 doi: medRxiv preprint 6 nonclassical monocytes increased. This suggests that the monocytes in COVID-19 patients are different from those in healthy donors.\n\nACE2 has been shown to be the entry receptor for both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. [7] [8] [9] [10] Speculating that direct viral infection could trigger the observed changes in monocytes, we further investigated whether monocytes express ACE2 and therefore could be infected by the SARS-CoV-2. By performing flow cytometry staining ACE2 on human monocytic cell lines THP-1 and U939, as well as murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7, we demonstrated that all these monocyte/macrophage cells are ACE2 positive ( Figure 4A ). Moreover, we confirmed that the monocytes in the peripheral blood of the healthy donors and COVID-19 patients are positive ( Figure 4B-D) . More importantly, we found that the expression level of ACE2 on the monocytes/macrophages in COVID-19 patients is significantly lower than healthy donors ( Figure 4E ).\n\nSignificant differences in time to discharge from hospital were identified between COVID-19 patients with low and high levels of FSC-low monocytes% (\u03c7 2 =8.68, P=0.0016, Figure 5A ) and FSC-low/FSC-high monocytes% (\u03c7 2 =10.00, P=0.0032, Figure 5B ). The differences were still significant after being adjusted for age and gender by the Cox models for FSC-low monocytes% (Z=-2.82, P=0.0051) and FSC-low/FSC-high monocytes% (Z=-2.80, P= 0.0048).\n\nOf the 28 COVID-19 patients included in this study, three were admitted to the ICU. Focusing on the total number of monocytes and the percentage of FSC-low and FSC-high, we observed an obvious difference from the non-ICU patients. As shown in Figure 5C , all three patients have lower number of monocytes, but a significantly higher percentage of FSC-high than FSC-low population. Moreover, the length of hospitalization of the three ICU patients is more than 45 days, significantly longer that the average 16.24 \u00b1 2.39 days of the non-ICU patients.\n\nTo further confirm that FSC-high population is a specific marker for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we investigated whether there is FSC-high population in other infectious diseases. As shown in Figure 6 , in 4 cases of HIV, 1 case of HIV with concurrent TB (tuberculosis), 1 case of influenza A virus subtype H1N1, 1 case of Hantaan orthohantavirus (HTNV), and 1 case of Malaria, there was no evidence of a smiliar FSC-high population in these viral and non-viral infections.\n\nHere we report our findings in 28 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection with varying degrees of severity. We identified a distinct change in the morphology and function of monocytes/macrophages that was predictive of severity of disease, likelihood of ICU admission, length of hospital stay and full recovery. These monocytes were characterized by a shift in forward scatter on flow cytometry as well as a relative increase in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. These FSC-high monocytes are CD14 + CD16 + and express macrophage markers CD68 + CD80 + CD163 + CD206 + , which represent an inflammatory monocyte subset not typically seen in healthy controls. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 24.20042655 doi: medRxiv preprint responses and monocyte/macrophage and neutrophil accumulation. 11 They highlighted that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV encode multiple proteins that antagonize IFN responses and that an early antagonism of the IFN response might delay or evade the innate immune response. 11,12 They concluded that delayed IFN signaling could further orchestrate inflammatory monocyte/macrophage responses and sensitize T cells to apoptosis resulting in a further dysregulated inflammatory response. 12 These inflammatory macrophages accumulate in the lungs and are the likely source of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with fatal disease induced by human coronavirus infections, such as SARS and COVID-19. Autopsy findings from patients with COVID-19 mirror these findings. 13 Interestingly, as we confirmed, monocytes in infected patients are ACE2 positive. Since ACE2 is the receptor used by COVID-19 to gain entry to cells, this suggests the possibility that monocytes in patients with COVID-19 may be directly infected by COVID-19, leading to abortive replication and a delayed type I IFN response in these cells. 12 Indeed, the SARS-CoV virus has been found to infect monocytes, though replication was poor. 14 Infection of monocytes by SARS-CoV was associated with inflammatory activation and alterations in immune function-related gene expression. 15, 16 Inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b1, GM-CSF, IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1 can also stimulate the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages.\n\nWe have found that treatment high doses of IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1 are capable of inducing macrophage differentiation in normal peripheral blood samples within 2 days, whereas GM-CSF plus IFN-\u03b1 requires 5-7 days (data not shown).\n\nSimilar to our findings, Zhou and colleagues recently reported on the presence of a significantly higher percentage of CD14 + CD16 + inflammatory monocytes in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients compared to normal healthy controls. 17, 18 They also reported that the percentage of CD14 + CD16 + monocytes was much higher in severe pulmonary syndrome patients from ICU. They also showed that these monocytes had the capability of secreting GM-CSF and similar to our findings could also secrete IL-6, which was higher in ICU patients, in association with cytokine storm. They described a model whereby an abnormal TH1 response triggers GM-CSF induced monocyte/macrophage activation leading to an increase in IL-6 producing CD14 + CD16 + monocytes, which migrate to the lungs and induce subsequent lung damage along with an inflammatory cytokine storm. This is also supported by recent data relating to single cell RNA sequencing of immune cells from bronchoalveolar lavage samples of patients with COVID-19, which provide important insights into the immune microenvironment of COVID-19 infected lungs. 19 These data show that Ficolin 1 expressing monocyte-derived macrophages, supplant fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4) expressing alveolar macrophages as the predominant macrophage subset in the lungs of patients with ARDS. These cells are highly inflammatory and enormous chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. Based on these data, a pilot trial of Tociluzumab, an IL-6 receptor antibody approved for treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis as well as CAR-T associated cytokine release syndrome was recently conducted in a small number of severe COVID-19 patients with promising results. [20] [21] [22] Other treatments for cytokine storm, such as the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist Anakinra and the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors may also prove to be useful, though to date there is little or no clinical experience with these agents in treating COVID-19. [23] [24] [25] Given the central role that monocytes appear to play in COVID-19 infection it is important to recognise the limited information provided by most routine automated blood analyzers. Indeed, the contribution of monocytes to the patient's pathology may be overlooked as patients with severe disease can be monocytopenic. 5 This may well reflect migration of the inflammatory monocyte/macrophages All rights reserved.

While morphological examination of peripheral blood films revealed somewhat larger, atypical, vacuolated monocytes, these findings are not very specific. We have shown that simple assessment of FSC by flow cytometry in the context of COVID-19 infection can rapidly identify those patients with an increasing proportion of large, activated, IL-6 and TNF secreting monocytes, who have severe disease and are at greatest risk of ICU admission. In contrast, patients with a high proportion of normal monocytes have better prognosis with earlier recovery and discharge from hospital. These findings appear to be relatively specific for COVID-19 as we have not seen a similar pattern in patients with other viral illnesses, such as H1N1 influenza, HIV, or Hantaanvirus.\n\nIn conclusion, in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, monocyte activation and the associated inflammatory response is associated with characteristic changes that can be rapidly identified by a simple blood-based flow cytometry-based assay, and serially monitored. While we acknowledge the limitations of our study, given the small sample size, we feel nevertheless that our findings could be of great help in guiding prognostication and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and merit further evaluation and confirmation in future studies.\n\nFunding: This study was supported by a Special Fund for COVID-19 from Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, and the Key Project of Science and Technology of Shaanxi (Grant No. 2018ZDXM-SF-039).\n\nThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.
