{"title": "Association of Common Comorbidities with Osteonecrosis: A Nationwide Population!based Case!control Study", "body": "Ethics approval As this study did not involve any contact with patients or any intervention, according to Danish law it was not necessary to obtain permission from the Danish Scientific Ethical Committee.\n\nData sharing statement There are no additional unpublished data from this study.\n\nFunding No specific grant from any public agency, commercial or not*for*profit sectors was received for the presented research. \n\n\u25ba Large size study within the setting of a healthcare registry system that grants complete and uniform data collecting.\n\n\u25ba Case*control design (10 subjects for each case randomly selected on the index date); matched by sex, age, ethnicity, and geographical region diminishing the risk of selection bias.\n\n\u25ba ICD*10 codes do not properly capture the jaw osteonecrosis. However, only a minority of jaw osteonecrosis appears to be clasified with similar codes.\n\n\u25ba Information on important confounders were lacking (lifestyle factors or medication).\n\nNonetheless, we were able to mutually adjust as surrogate measure using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. while other authors indicated more than 15 ON cases per 100,000 inhabitants when evaluating total joint arthroplasties 1 . From Asia, a non*traumatic femoral ON incidence of 2.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants has been reported in the Fukuoka Prefecture of Japan 6 .\n\nAmong patients with cancer 7,8 , pulmonary diseases 5,9*11 , immunological conditions 8, 11, 12 , renal diseases 13 , or organ transplantation 8,14,15 corticosteroid therapy has been associated with increased risk of ON. Further, important lifestyle factors, including tobacco use 16, 17 and high alcohol consumption 16*18 may increase ON risk.\n\nA few specific comorbid medical conditions have been associated with increased risk of ON 4,19*21 . The clinical implications of these findings may be limited, since many of the reported diseases, like sickle cell hemoglobinopathy, Gaucher disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, or caisson disease are relatively rare 19, 21 .\n\nIn contrast, data are scarce about the impact of frequently occurring diseases in middle*aged and elderly populations on the risk of ON which may be of greater clinical and public health importance.\n\nIn order to fill the gap in current knowledge, we investigated recent time trends in the incidence of ON in Denmark, and examined the association between a number of common comorbidities included in the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the risk of incident ON. \n\nThe study population consisted of all patients (cases) with a first ON diagnosis identified in the DNRP from 1995 through 2012. We used the following ICD*10 codes: idiopathic aseptic \n\nThe Danish Civil Registry System was used to randomly select 10 population control subjects for each case on the date of first ON diagnosis (index date for controls). All control subjects were matched by age, sex, ethnicity (native vs. immigrants), and residency (same county). To be eligible for this study, subjects in the control group must also not have had a hospitalization with an ON diagnosis before the admission date for the corresponding ON case. In the present study, comorbidities were defined according to the CCI (see Appendix). Using ICD*10 codes as previously reported 23 , data on all comorbidities up to a 5*year period prior to the index date in cases and controls were obtained from the DNRP. The predictive positive value of these CCI comorbidities is documented high in the DNRP 23 . We also defined several severity levels of comorbidity, CCI low (with CCI score 0, thus having no recorded comorbidities), CCI mild (if CCI score 1), CCI moderate (if CCI score 2), or CCI severe (CCI score 3+).\n\nWe estimated annual incidence rates of ON per 100,000 inhabitants as the number of new diagnosed ON cases occurring in entire Denmark per year divided by the number of residents January 1 st in the year of interest. Denominator data was available from Statistics Denmark 24 .\n\nWe tabulated baseline characteristics of cases with first ON diagnosis and matched population control subjects. We then computed odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each comorbidity to proximate the relative risk of ON occurrence.\n\nAdjusted odds ratios (aORs) were computed using multivariable logistic regression models, mutually adjusting for all other comorbidities than the one of interest. Due to the matched case*control design, all ORs were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and place of residence too.\n\nAll analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).\n\nThe overall mean annual incidence of ON in Denmark was 4.2 per 100,000 inhabitants for the period 1995*2012 (ranging between 3.3 and 5.9 per 100,000 inhabitants).\n\nAs presented in Fig 1, 2.7%, respectively). The prevalence of all CCI diseases is listed in Table 2 . Table 2 summarizes also the association between each CCI disease category and the risk of ON. In matched unadjusted analyses, the moderate*severe liver disease ( 9.7, CI: 5.7 -16.5), lymphoma (OR = 7.3, CI: 5.6 -9.7), and leukemia (OR = 6.2, CI: 4.1 -9.6) categories were associated with the highest relative risk of incident ON. After mutually controlling for other than exposure comorbidities, the strength of these and most other associations decreased.\n\nSolid cancer, the most common comorbidity in ON, was associated with an aOR of 2.0 (CI: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Previous studies found an estimated relative risk for ON development of 3.2 for occasional alcohol drinking 17 , 7.8 -13.1 for regular drinkers 16,17 and 17.9 in current drinkers with intake of greater than 1000 ml of alcohol weekly 16 . However, other factors than alcohol intake may play a role for increased ON risk in liver diseases 35 . ON occurrence seems to be lower in patients that present an immediate increase of cytolysis liver enzymes under steroid therapy, than in those without this quick response 36 . Furthermore, alcohol*related ON seems to be stronger associated with alcoholic liver disease than with alcoholic pancreatic disease 37 .\n\nAlso, other pathologies associated with bone impairment, including thrombocytopenia 8 , Our study has also several strengths, including its large size and a case*controlled design within the setting of a healthcare registry system that grants complete and uniform data collecting throughout entire Denmark. In order to control for confounding, we could match ON cases and controls by sex, age, ethnicity, and geographical region. Control patients were randomly selected from the Central Population Registry among the study base giving rise to ON cases, diminishing risk of selection bias. There is no recall bias in our case*control study because the data on comorbidity is based on information already prospective collected independently of our study goals. The comorbidities analyzed were coded prior the index date so it is less like to be ON sequels.\n\nIn conclusion, this large population*based study provided evidence that the incidence of ON has increased over the last decade in Denmark. Common chronic conditions including cancer, chronic pulmonary disease, liver and renal disease, and diabetes are all associated with substantially increased risk of ON, and increases in the prevalence of these diseases in the population may also underlie the increasing ON trend observed.

In contrast, data are scarce about the impact of frequently occurring diseases in middle*aged and elderly populations on the risk of ON which may be of greater clinical and public health importance. In order to fill the gap in our current knowledge, we investigated recent time trends in the incidence of ON in Denmark, and examined the association between a number of common comorbidities included in the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the risk of incident ON. \n\nThe study population consisted of all patients (cases) with a first ON diagnosis identified in the DNRP from 1995 through 2012. We used the following ICD*10 codes: idiopathic aseptic \n\nThe Danish Civil Registry System was used to randomly select 10 population control subjects for each case on the date of first ON diagnosis (index date for controls). All control subjects were matched by age, sex, ethnicity (native vs. immigrants), and residency (same county). To be eligible for this study, subjects in the control group were not allowed to have a hospitalization with an ON diagnosis before the admission date for the corresponding ON case. \n\nIn the present study, comorbidities were defined according to the CCI (see Appendix). Using ICD*10 codes as previously reported 23 , data on all comorbidities up to a 5*year period prior to the index date in cases and controls were obtained from the DNRP. The predictive positive value of these CCI comorbidities is documented high in the DNRP 23 . We also defined several severity levels of comorbidity, categorized as none (CCI score 0, thus having no recorded hospital*diagnosed comorbidities), mild comorbidity (CCI score 1 or 2), moderate comorbidity (CCI score 3 or 4), and severe comorbidity (CCI score 5+).\n\nWe estimated annual incidence rates of ON per 100,000 inhabitants as the number of new diagnosed ON cases occurring in entire Denmark per year divided by the number of residents January 1 st in the year of interest. Denominator data was available from Statistics Denmark 24 .\n\nWe tabulated baseline characteristics of cases with first ON diagnosis and matched population control subjects. We then computed odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each comorbidity to proximate the relative risk of ON occurrence.\n\nAdjusted odds ratios (aORs) were computed using multivariable logistic regression models, mutually adjusting for all other comorbidities than the one of interest. Due to the matched case*control design, all ORs were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and place of residence too.\n\nAll analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).\n\nThe overall mean annual incidence of ON in Denmark was 4.2 per 100,000 inhabitants for the period 1995*2012 (ranging between 3.3 and 5.9 per 100,000 inhabitants). \n\nWe identified 4,107 patients with a first time ON*related hospitalization ( 2.7%, respectively). The prevalence of all CCI diseases is listed in Table 2 . Table 2 shows associations between each CCI disease category and the risk of ON. In matched unadjusted analyses, the moderate*to*severe liver disease ( 9.7, CI: 5.7 -16.5), lymphoma (OR = 7.3, CI: 5.6 -9.7), and leukemia (OR = 6.2, CI: 4.1 -9.6) categories were associated with the highest relative risk of incident ON. After mutually controlling for other than exposure comorbidities, the strength of these and most other associations decreased.\n\nSolid cancer, the most common comorbidity in ON, was associated with an aOR of 2.0 (CI: 1.7 -2.2). For advanced metastatic cancers, leukemia, and lymphoma, aORs of ON were 3.4\n\n(CI: 2.5 -4.5), 4.3 (CI: 2.7 -7.0), and 5.8 (CI: 4.3 -7.8), respectively. In addition, aORs were 2.8 (CI: 1.9 -4.1) and 4.5 (CI: 2.5 -8.2) for mild and moderate*to*severe liver disease, respectively, and also substantially increased at 4.2 (CI: 3.4 -5.2) for renal disease. Adjusted ON risk estimates were lowest for cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction (aOR = 0.8, CI: 0.7 -1.1), congestive heart failure (aOR = 1.3, CI: 1.1 -1.6), peripheral vascular disease (aOR = 1.6, CI: 1.3 -1.9), and cerebrovascular disease (aOR = 1.2, CI: 1.0 -1.4), while the aOR for diabetes was 1.6 (CI: 1.4 -2.0).\n\nThis large population*based study showed that the incidence of ON in Denmark was 4.2 per 100,000 during 1995*2012. ON incidence increased by 40% over 18 years, corroborating increasing time trends observed in other studies 2,25 .\n\nFour out of ten patients with ON were burdened with major comorbid conditions before ON diagnosis, with malignancies, liver disease, and renal disease showing the strongest association with ON.\n\nThe highest ON incidence was seen in 2011, at 5.9 per 100,000 inhabitants. The rising ON incidence over time may be related to an increasing use of corticosteroid therapy in the Danish population, although available data on overall corticosteroid use are scarce 26 , or may be related to the general longevity and increase in comorbidity burden observed in the general population 27 . Alternatively, the observed trends may reflect the use of more sensitive diagnostic tools, especially magnetic resonance imaging 2 .\n\nSeveral factors, like radiotherapy and/ or chemotherapy may be involved in a causal relationship of malignancies with incident ON 7 . Bisphosphonates used e.g. in the management of multiple myeloma 28 and bone metastases 29 have been related to ON of the jaw 30 . For hematological cancers, hyperviscosity*induced leukostasis and leukemic infiltration have been suspected as underlying mechanisms 31 . Moreover, bone marrow transplantation is reportedly accompanied by a cumulative ON incidence after ten years of Our study also has several strengths, including its large size and a case*control design within the setting of a universally covering healthcare system that grants complete and uniform data collecting throughout entire Denmark. In order to control for confounding, we could match ON cases and controls by sex, age, ethnicity, and geographical region. Control subjects were randomly selected from the Central Population Registry among the study base giving rise to ON cases, diminishing risk of selection bias. There is no recall bias in our case* control study because the data on comorbidity is based on information already prospectively collected, independently of our study goals. The comorbidities analyzed were coded prior the index date and are thus unlikely to be ON sequels.\n\nIn conclusion, this large population*based study provided evidence that the incidence of ON has increased over the last decade in Denmark. Common chronic conditions including cancer, chronic pulmonary disease, liver and renal disease, and diabetes are all associated with substantially increased risk of ON, and increases in the prevalence of these diseases in the population may also underlie the increasing ON trend observed. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 "}
