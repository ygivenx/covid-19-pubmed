{"title": "Disparities in Age-Specific Morbidity and Mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in China and the Republic of Korea", "body": "There are many uncertainties regarding the clinical epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is currently spreading worldwide in a global pandemic whose ultimate impacts are still uncertain, but which appears based on observed impacts to have the potential to overwhelm the medical surveillance and medical treatment infrastructure of even the world's most affluent countries. There is a need to gain greater understanding of the highest risk populations for infection and serious disease from the SARS-CoV-2 virus to support the development and implementation of effective public health surveillance and mitigation efforts, and minimize the adverse effects of the current COVID-19 Pandemic in countries worldwide [1] .\n\n.

The sexspecific morbidity ratio among confirmed cases was near parity, with a slight male bias (male 51%; female 49%). There was a high degree of difference in sex-specific case fatality rates, with fatality rates much higher among males (2.8% CFR) than females (1.7% CFR).\n\nData from ROK (n = 7,755 as of 11 March 2020) exhibited a skewed bimodal distribution with the highest rate of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among individuals in the 20-29 year age cohort (30%), and a second peak in the 50-59 year age cohort (19%) ( Figure 1 ). There is a high degree of difference in the sex-specific rates of infection from SARS-CoV-2 in the ROK, with female cases (62%) outnumbering males by a factor of nearly 2:1 ratio (females: 62%; males: 38%). The data on fatalities from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in the ROK exhibit a reversed bias ratio to that among cases, with the case fatality rate among males more than twice as high as that among females (CFR: males 1.19%; females 0.52%).\n\n.

While many patients developed influenzalike illness that progresses to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting in hospitalization and/or death, a large spectrum of clinical presentations have been documented including a growing number of reported cases with mild symptoms and asymptomatic infections [8] .\n\nAsymptomatic infection has been reported from adults and children, but the proportion of truly asymptomatic infections remains uncertain, and may be higher than documented from currently available data [9] [10] . A recent report documented RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples from an asymptomatic child, which persisted for 26 days following the estimated date of exposure [11] .\n\nThe most commonly reported symptoms in order of relative frequency include fever and dry cough (>70%) and fatigue (>35%), dyspnea (<20%), sore throat (<15%), headache (<15%), myalgia or arthralgia (<15%), chills (<15%), nausea or vomiting (5%), nasal congestion (<5%), diarrhea (<4%), and .

The most striking anomaly in the ROK data appears to be the relatively high proportion of cases among the 20-29 year age group (29% of all cases), which may be attributable in part to lower rates of compliance among individuals in this age group with social distancing and self-quarantine recommendations issued by Korean health authorities. year age cohorts in the ROK data.\n\nThe reported data on confirmed cases and fatalities from SARS-CoV-2 indicates highly significant differences in the age-specific and sex-specific rates of morbidity and mortality from the COVID-19\n\nPandemic in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and China. Closer study of the factors underlying the initiation and early proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in China and the ROK may provide valuable insights .

The available epidemiological and observational data from the ROK suggests that reduced rates of compliance with social distancing and self-quarantine recommendations among different sectors of the population -especially the younger adult and juvenile age cohorts --may have a significant impact on the age-specific rates of morbidity and mortality within the population as a whole.\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest\n\nIan M.
