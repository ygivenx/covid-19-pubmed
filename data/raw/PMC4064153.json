{"title": "Molecular Epidemiology of Paramyxoviruses in Frugivorous\nEidolon helvum Bats in Zambia", "body": "In the past 10 years, a lot of attention has been given to bats as reservoirs of emerging\nzoonotic viruses. This has been as a result of the high detection rate of previously unknown\nviral sequences in bats coupled with the emergence of pathogens, such as Hendra, Nipah, Severe\nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Corona, Ebola and Marburg viruses, all of which are highly\nvirulent and pose a great zoonotic risk [2, 3, 8, 9, 17]. Bats, being\nthe only flying mammals with ancient evolutionary origins and long life span, are capable of\ncovering great distances during migrations, rendering them suitable hosts and reservoirs for\nvarious viruses. Paramyxoviruses from the family Paramyxoviridae have been\nimplicated in several human epidemics and mortalities [6, 10, 19]. Several studies have indicated bats as potential natural reservoirs of\nParamyxoviruses, such as Henipavirus-, Respirovirus- and Morbillivirus-related viruses [1, 4]. This\nundoubtedly presents a threat to the health of the human population in areas where human\nbeings live in close proximity to fruit bat species [7].\nIn Zambia, straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) annually converge in\nKasanka National Park (KNP).\n\nIn this study, we investigated the presence of paramyxoviruses in the Eidolon\nhelvum bats captured over a period of 4 years (2008\u20132011) from KNP (S15:34.688\nE28:16.513). During that period, a total of 312 spleen samples were collected from the same\nnumber of bats (Table 1). Appropriate research permits and hunting licenses were obtained from the\nZambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA).\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from spleen tissues using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,\nU.S.A.) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A semi-nested broad spectrum RT-PCR\ntargeting the paramyxovirus polymerase (L) gene was used to screen total RNA\nsamples (n=312) for paramyxoviruses using PAR-F1, PAR-F2 and PAR-R primers and PCR conditions\ndescribed by Tong et al. [16]. A total\nof 25 samples out of 312 bat spleens (8%) were positive for paramyxoviruses on semi-nested\nPCR. The positive products (584 bp) were then purified using the monofas purification kit (GL\nsciences, Tokyo, Japan), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The purified PCR\nproducts were then subjected to Cycle sequencing reactions using the Big Dye Terminator v3.1\nsystem (Life Technologies) and the PAR-F2 and PAR-R inner primers. Ethanol precipitation was\nused to remove the labeled dNTPs from cycle sequence products and subjected to electrophoresis\nin the ABI 3130 genetic analyzer (Life Technologies). Phylogenetic analysis was performed\nusing reference sequences and positive samples by aligning all sequences using ClustalW1.6\nfollowed by the creation of a MEGA file format created using MEGA ver.5.2 [14]. The neighbor joining method was used to generate the\nphylograms [12] with a 1,000 bootstrap replicate\nconfidence level [5]. To compute the evolutionary\ndistances, the Maximum Composite Likelihood method was used with the number of base\nsubstitutions per site as units [15].\n\nSamples AB853101, AB853102, AB853104, AB853105 and AB853094 showed a nucleotide homology of\n73% with the Nipah virus (AF212302), while AB853106 and AB853096 had a nucleotide homology of\n74% with the unclassified Bat paramyxovirus (Bat PV) (JN648087) from Ghana. The relatively low\nnucleotide homology might indicate that these sequences originate from novel paramyxoviruses.\nThe samples from Zambia formed clusters with the Henipavirus-related viruses and with the\nunclassified Bat paramyxoviruses (Fig. 1). Within the Henipavirus-related virus cluster, two groups (A and B) were observed.\nGroup A comprised novel Zambian strains closely related to the Nipah (NC002728, FN86955 and\nAF212302) and Hendra (AF017149 and NC001906) viral sequences, while Group B comprised a\ncluster of Zambian strains, in close relationship with an unclassified Bat PV from Ghana\n(JN648085) and Cedar virus (JQ001776) (Fig. 1). The\nremaining Zambian strains, including the novel AB853106 sequence, formed a cluster with the\nunclassified Bat PV sequences from Ghana (JN648078, JN648081, JN648087 and JN648089) and Congo\nBrazzaville (HE647835 and HE647837) (Fig. 1). The\nclose relatedness of the viral sequence from Ghana and Congo Brazzaville strains with those\nfrom Zambia might imply the ability of bats to harbor and transmit similar viruses over long\nand diverse geographical distances. This is facilitated by their ability to migrate, covering\nthousands of kilometers to their hibernation and feeding sites [11]. Along their migratory path, they interact directly or indirectly with\nseveral terrestrial mammalian species in different geographical locations, thus enhancing the\ninterspecies transmission of viruses [11]. Humans can\nbecome exposed to these viruses through environmental contamination with urine and feces from\nbats. Although paramyxovirus infections derived from bats have been reported in humans in\nBangladesh [13], none have been reported in Africa. The\nabsence of cases might be as a result of under-reporting. As such continued surveillance and\nassessment of the zoonotic risk posed by these viruses still remains important.\n\nIn order to isolate the detected viruses, spleens from PCR positive bats were homogenized in\nminimum essential media (MEM) followed by centrifugation at 1,000 \u00d7 g for 3\nmin. The supernatant was then applied to Vero E6 cell with 70\u201380% growth confluence. The Vero\nE6 cells were cultured in MEM with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2% antibiotic-antimycotic\n(Life Technologies). The inoculated Vero E6 cell cultures were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 21\ndays, coupled with cell passage and microscopic examination. However, after several passages,\ncytopathic effects were not observed. We also performed semi-nested RT-PCR to detect\nparamyxovirus RNA in the supernatants of the inoculated cells. However, no positive signals\nwere detected. Isolation of paramyxoviruses using Vero E6 cells has successfully been reported\n[18], implying that Vero E6 cell lines might be\nsuitable for isolation of paramyxoviruses. In this study, the small amount of virus in the\nsupernatant or the failure to successfully remove the virus from infected cells using the\nfreeze and thaw technique might be responsible for the absence of cytopathic effects in the\ncell culture. In a study by Wilkinson [18], out of 8\npositive samples, virus isolation was only successfully carried out in two samples.\nFurthermore, serological examination of bat sera may provide important information about their\nexposure to specific infections. Unfortunately, however, our study did not carry out any\nserological test.\n\nIn conclusion, we report the identification of novel Henipavirus-related (n=5) and unrelated\n(n=2) viruses in fruit bats from the KNP using RT-PCR. The viruses identified in this study\nwere shown to originate from wide geographical areas, and their presence in fruit bat species\nmight pose a public health risk and as such, continued surveillance of these viruses in fruit\nbats in essential."}
