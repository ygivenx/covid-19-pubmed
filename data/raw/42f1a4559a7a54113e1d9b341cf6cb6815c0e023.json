{"title": "Isolation of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus during Outbreaks in", "body": "In this study, a new set of specific primers was designed on the basis of the reference strain of USA/Colorado/2013, KF272920 to amplify complete S and N genes of PEDV.\n\nTechnical Appendix Table 1 shows the sequences of primers and the annealing temperature of PCR.\n\nThe specific PCR bands, which were purified by using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany), were used for cloning with the TA cloning kit (Topcloner TA kit, Enzynomics, Daejeon, South Korea) and subsequently transformed into competent Escherichia coli cells (DH5\u03b1). The purified DNAs were sequenced by using Macrogen sequencer (Seoul, South Korea) in both directions to verify the accuracy of the sequence (3). "}
