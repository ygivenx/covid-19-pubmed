{"title": "Replication and plaque formation of swine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (67N) in swine cell line, SK-K culture", "body": "Swine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) is a coronavirus which causes vomiting and wasting syndrome of young piglets (Roe and Alexander, 1958; Siddell et al., 1983) . The growth of HEV has been reported in primary and secondary cell cultures of swine kidney (Greig and Girard, 1963; Mengeling et al., 1972) and thyroid (Mengeling, 1973) , and in suckling mouse brain (Kaye et al., 1977) .\n\nIn established cell lines, however, only Sato et al. (1983) reported replication and plaque formation of 67N strain of HEV (Mengeling et al., 1972) in ESK cells derived from embryonic swine kidney with incorporation of diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-dextran in maintenance medium and agar overlay medium, whereas no cytopathic changes and no plaque formation were observed without DEAE-dextran. However, CPE and plaques on ESK cells produced by the virus were not so clear that consistent work with HEV still remain difficult. It is essential for studying HEV infection to find the susceptible cell lines showing clear CPE and plaques with the virus growth.\n\nRecently, we found that HEV 67N strain replicated readily in SK-K cells, an established cell line from swine kidney (Yamagishi et al., 1981) , with marked cytopathic effect and produced very clear plaques under simple overlay medium without DEAE-dextran. The present paper discusses the successful replication and plaque formation of the virus in the SK-K cell cultures.\n\nThe HEV 67N strain adapted to suckling mouse brain (Yagami et al., 1987) was passaged in brains of suckling ICR mice, which were obtained from a commercial breeding colony free from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection. The infected brains were stocked at -70\u00b0C until use. The brains were homogenized in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant as virus material.\n\nSeven cell lines susceptible to different coronavirus were used. They were SK-K, CPK (swine kidney), STR (swine thyroid), PK15 (swine kidney), BEK-1 (bovine embryonic kidney) , DBT (delayed brain tumor of CDFl mouse) (Hirano et al., 1974) and LBC (mammary tumor of Lewis rat) . The SK-K, CPK and STR cells were kindly supphed by Dr Yamagishi, Research Center for Veterinary Science, Kitasato Institute, Kashiwa, Japan. These cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 10% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) and 0.06 mg/ml kanamycin.\n\nThe indirect immunofluorescence was carried out in the same manner as described previously (Yagami et al., 1987) . The infected cell cultures grown on coverslips, washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) were fixed with cold acetone, and then treated with anti-67N rabbit serum diluted 1:20 in PBS at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. After washing 3 times with cold PBS, the cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG goat serum (Miles Biochemicals, U.S.A.) diluted 1:lO in PBS at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. Non-infected cell cultures were treated in the same manner as the controls.\n\nThe following method of plaque assay was established on the basis of the results obtained in this study. Monolayer cultures were prepared in 60-mm plastic Petri dishes (Terumo, Japan) by seeding with 1 x 106 cells suspended in 5 ml of growth medium and by incubating at 37\u00b0C for 2 days in an atmosphere of 5% CO, in air. Confluent cell monolayer in dishes were washed 3 times with MEM and inoculated with 0.2 ml of virus dilutions in MEM. After virus adsorption at 37\u00b0C for 90 min, the inoculated cultures were overlaid with 5 ml of agar overlay medium which consisted of 0.8% Agar Noble (Difco, U.S.A.) in MEM containing 10% TPB and kanamycin (0.06 mg/ml). The inoculated cultures were incubated in a CO, incubator at 37\u00b0C for 3 days, and stained by incubating at 37\u00b0C for 6 to 8 h under a second overlay medium containing 0.01% neutral red. The infectious titre was expressed in plaque-forming units (PFU).\n\nFour-week-old male ICR mice were obtained from a commercial breeder free from MHV infection. Animals were inoculated intracerebrally (i.c.) with 0.02 ml of virus material and observed for 7 days.\n\nFour-week-old ICR mice were inoculated intraperitoneally twice with 0.2 ml of each virus material at an interval of 2 weeks. At 1 week after the last inoculation mice were killed to collect the blood. The antiserum was heated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min for serological tests.\n\nHA and HI tests were carried out by the microtitre method using 0.5% chicken red blood cells as described by Hirai et al. (1974) .\n\nThe cell cultures of SK-K, CPK, STR, PK15, BEK-1, DBT and LBC cells grown in 50 ml culture bottles were washed 3 times with MEM and inoculated with 0.2 ml of the virus material prepared from infected mouse brains. After virus adsorption at 37\u00b0C for 60 min, the inoculated cultures were fed maintenance medium consisting of MEM and 10% TPB and incubated at 37\u00b0C. Cytopathic changes were observed only in SK-K cell monolayers in 72 h p.i. and were characterized with round cells, syncytium formation and cell detachment from glass surface. Round cells and fused cells were scattered over the cell sheet and eventually detached from glass surface, on which a few cells remained at 96 h p.i. No visible changes were found in other 6 cell cultures at 7 days p.i. and also in the blindly passaged cell cultures. Further passages of the virus in SK-K cell cultures were readily accomplished with undiluted culture fluid at intervals of 3 days. After a few passages, the CPE began to appear within 24 h p.i. and was complete within 48 h p.i. (Fig. 1 ).\n\nThe SK-K cell monolayers grown on coverslips were inoculated with the virus passaged 6 times in SK-K cells for detection of virus specific antigen and incubated at 37\u00b0C in maintenance medium after virus adsorption at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. The infected cell cultures were examined for virus antigen by an indirect method using anti-HEV 67 rabbit serum. Specific viral antigen was first observed at 6 h p.i. as perinuclear, fluorescent granules in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2) , and the positive cells to viral antigen increased in number with the progress of incubation and reached 100% at 24 h p.i. The viral antigen was not detected in non-infected cells.\n\nThe SK-K-passaged virus as well as the original mouse-passaged virus formed plaques on SK-K cell monolayers prepared in plastic dishes by agar overlay method. The cell cultures inoculated with 0.2 ml of infectious material were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 90 min for virus adsorption, and then overlaid with 5 ml of MEM containing 0.8% Agar Noble and 10% TPB. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 48 h, small plaques became visible without staining. At 72 h p.i., the inoculated cultures were overlaid with agar medium containing neutral red. The clear plaques were produced by both viruses. Various factors influencing plaque formation were examined in order to establish a routine assay for 67N virus.\n\nEffect of adsorption medium on plaque formation was tested by diluting the virus with the following media; MEM, PBS and LE (Earle's solution containing 0.5% lactalbumin hydrolysate). Infectious culture fluid was diluted lOOO-fold with the diluent indicated described above. No significant difference in plaque count was found between MEM, PBS and LE. From these results, MEM was selected for following tests as the adsorption medium.\n\nIn order to determine experimental conditions for routine assay, the kinetics of virus adsorption onto SK-K cell monolayers in MEM were investigated. SK-K cell monolayers were inoculated with the diluted virus, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30,60,90 and 120 min for virus adsorption and overlaid with agar medium immediately after virus adsorption or after washing 3 times with MEM. The number of plaques in unwashed cultures was about 3fold higher than the washed ones, and showed a maximum both at 90 min of incubation in both unwashed and washed ones. For the routine procedure, the inoculated cultures are incubated at 37\u00b0C for 90 min, and overlaid with agar medium without washing.\n\nAs shown in Table 1, the effect of composition of the agar overlay medium on plaque formation was tested. Addition of 10% TPB to the agar medium exerted a marked effect on plaque formation. However, overlay medium supplemented with 5% FCS produced a small number of ill-defined plaques whether or not the media contained TPB. As agar overlay medium, MEM containing 0.8% Agar Noble and 10% TPB was selected.\n\nReadily countable, clear plaques with a well-defined circular margin, 0.5 to 0.7 mm across, were obtained after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 48 h before staining by second overlay with neutral red, whereas no plaques were formed after incubation for 24 h. Incubation for 72 h increased the plaque size and number. The plaque size was 2.G2.5 mm in diameter (Fig. 3) . Further incubation resulted in the degeneration of the uninfected cell monolayers and decrease of plaque count. Incubation for 72 h was therefore adopted as a standard procedure. Table 2 , the addition of DEAE-dextran (50 @ml) to the virus adsorption medium and overlay medium increased the plaque count by 50% but the condition of the SK-K cell cultures became worse in comparison to the control cultures without DEAE-dextran. When trypsin was added, no significant difference in the size and number of plaques was found between added and control cultures, but the cells were damaged by trypsin. The addition of both DEAEdextran and trypsin enhanced damage of the cells. Based on these results, the standard technique of plaque assay was established as described in Materials and Methods. Using this technique, the plaque count was shown to be directly proportional to virus concentration. In the serial passages of the virus in SK-K cells described above, the virus yield in the fluid phase ranged from 106.' to 1o6.3 PFlJO.2 ml after 2 days of incubation, although the titers in the early passages were lower. \"Virus material was incubated with an equal volume of either MEM or rabbit antiserum against mousepassaged virus (HI titer 1:128) at room temperature for 30 min, and then 0.02 ml of the mixture was inoculated intracerebrally into 4-week-old ICR mice. bNumber of mice dead/number of mice tested; mean death time in days was shown in parenthesis.\n\nSince the 67N virus was neuropathogenic for mice (Yagami et al., 1987) , the SK-K-passaged virus at the 9th passage level was examined for pathogenicity for 4-week-old ICR mice by intracerebral inoculation, The mice, inoculated with the virus of 10 to lo4 PFU/0.02 ml, died within 7 days with severe symptoms in the central nervous systems. Preincubation of the virus with rabbit antiserum against mouse-passaged virus prevented fatal infection in mice (Table 3) .\n\nHA activity was demonstrated in the infected culture fluid by microtiter method. When the SK-K cell cultures developed confluent CPE at 48 h after inoculation with the 10th passaged virus, the cultures were frozen and thawed 3 times. The supernatant of whole cultures showed HA activity 153 to 1:16 in titer. Cross-HI tests were carried out between SK-K-and mouse-passaged viruses and antisera against both viruses in order to identify the SK-K-passaged virus as 67N virus. As shown in Table 4 , no antigenic discrepancy existed between both viruses. \n\nThe final identification of the SK-K-passaged virus was established by cross-neutralization test using hyperimmune mouse sera against the mouse-passaged and SK-K-passaged viruses. The tests were carried out by 50% plaque reduction method. Virus sample (200 PIWO.2 ml) was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with respective antiserum of varying concentrations. There was no antigenic discrepancy between both viruses, identifying the SK-K-passaged virus as HEV 67N (Table 4).\n\nIn the present study, SK-K cells, a stable cell line derived from a swine kidney was shown to be more sensitive to HEV 67N and found satisfactory for viral production and plaque formation of the virus.\n\nCompared with the tissue culture methods described previously for replication and infectivity assay of HEV 67N (Greig and Girard, 1962; Mengeling et al., 1972; Mengeling, 1973; Sato et al., 1983) , the SK-K cell cultures have several advantages. The cells can be grown and handled easily. There is no risk of contamination with HEV and other porcine viruses, which may occur with the use of primary cultures of porcine tissues. After inoculation of 67N virus into the SK-K cell cultures, CPE developed earlier and more clearly than in other cell cultures reported previously (Greig and Girard, 1963; Mengeling et al., 1972; Mengeling, 1973; Sato et al., 1983) . Indirect immunofluorescence using rabbit antiserum against mousepassaged virus demonstrated viral specific antigen in the cytoplasm of fused SK-K cells, the same as reported on 67N infection of cell cultures of embryonic porcine kidney (Mengeling et al., 1982; Mengeling, 1983) .\n\nThe standard technique of plaque assay, as described in Materials and Methods was developed on the basis of the findings presented in this paper and fits the requirement that a routine procedure should be as simple as possible. On plaque formation of HEV in established cell line, Sato et al. (1983) first demonstrated plaque formation in ESK cell cultures under the agar overlay medium containing DEAE-dextran. In the SK-K cell system, DEAE-dextran did not show the significant enhancing effect on plaque formation, and plaques developed earlier and clearer than in ESK cell system. FCS is known to inhibit adsorption of coronaviruses onto cell membrane (Gerna et al., 1980) . In this study, the same effect was observed with plaque formation by the 67N virus because the addition of FCS to the agar medium reduced the number of plaques.\n\nThe SK-K-passaged virus caused fatal infection in mice, as observed with the mouse-passaged virus. Preincubation with rabbit antiserum against mouse-passaged virus prevented fatal infection in mice. The final identification of the SK-Kpassaged virus as HEV 67N was established by cross-HI and cross-neutralization tests, using hyperimmune sera both against the mouse-passaged virus and the SK-K-passaged virus.\n\nThus, SK-K cells provide a satisfactory source of the virus, and a sensitive, practical, reproducible plaque assay method for viral infectivity and neutralizing antibody in HEV infection. Further investigation of other HEV strains as well as wild strains would be of interest."}
