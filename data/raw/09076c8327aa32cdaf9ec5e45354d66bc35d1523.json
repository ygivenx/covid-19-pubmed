{"title": "Background K 2P Channels KCNK3/9/15 Limit the Budding of Cell Membrane-derived Vesicles", "body": "Vesicle secretion is an essential step for many physiological and pathophysiological processes. By releasing specific, submicron-sized vesicles, cells communicate or cross-talk with other cells and the surrounding microenvironment/systems. These cell-derived exovesicles are generated from intracellular compartments or the plasma membrane through a series of fusion and fission events. Although the origins/functions of these cell-derived exovesicles are various, their fundamental biophysical properties (e.g. fusogenicity) are similar. Most exovesicles have the capability to fuse with target cells in order to deliver cargo and transmit information. For example, the exovesicles secreted by mature dendritic cells (DCs), a type of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), bear antigen-loaded MHC molecules. When these exovesicles fuse with immature DCs, the antigens are transferred from mature to immature DCs [1] . This process could increase the number of APCs and amplify the immune responses. Besides information transmission mediated by fusion, the surface of a secreted vesicle can also serve as an antigen/biomarker-loaded presentation platform for various purposes [2] . This is best illustrated with the many types of tumor cell-derived microvesicles and exosomes. The tumor antigen-loaded exovesicles usually function to suppress a wide spectrum of immune responses, but some of them secreted under stress could also counterintuitively activate the immunity [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In recent years, our understanding for the compositions and functions of cell-secreted vesicles has grown exponentially [2, 8, 9] . This report explores a lesser known aspect about the physical mechanism of vesicle biogenesis.\n\nA universal, key regulator for membrane fusion/fission is the Ca 2? transient [10] . Ca 2? fluxes affect many factors in the exocytic machinery, such as small GTPases [9] . Another universal regulator is membrane potential stability, which is largely contributed by background K ? channels [11, 12] . Many background K ? channels, known as two-pore K ? (K 2P ) channels, share a unique two-pore (P) and four-transmembrane (2P/4TM) configuration per channel subunit. The K 2P (KCNK) channel family is extensively distributed in eukaryotes, and can be further divided into six subfamilies (TWIK, TREK/TRAAK, TASK, THIK, TALK, and TRESK) based on their primary sequence homology and channel properties [11] . Compared to other potassium channel families, K 2P channels play fundamental physiological functions, such as maintenance of membrane potential stability and regulation of cellular excitability, and are thus considered to have evolved earlier than the other K ? channel families [11] .\n\nIn particular, KCNK3 channels have been shown to reduce HIV-1 virus release [13] . We previously found that KCNK3 (also known as TASK-1) can interact destructively with HIV-1 Vpu, which is a channel-like protein [14, 15] and is capable of enhancing virus secretion [13, [16] [17] [18] . Ion channels or channel-like proteins encoded by viruses are collectively called viroporins [14] . The functions of viroporins by and large remain unclear [14, 15] . Interestingly, besides HIV-1 Vpu, murine hepatitis virus E protein and SARS coronavirus 3a protein are also viroporins capable of accelerating virus release [19] [20] [21] . However, the mechanistic links between their viroporin activities and their abilities to promote viral egress are not clear, either.\n\nHIV-1 Vpu bears a single transmembrane domain, and may form homo-oligomers [22] and/or hetero-oligomers with host channel subunits like KCNK3 [13] . Vpu has a tremendous ability to interact with a wide range of host proteins [13, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , including KCNK3 (also known as TASK-1), and to modify or destroy their normal physiological functions [13, 30, 31] . In mammalian heterologous expression systems, KCNK3 channel activities are diminished upon Vpu co-expression, whereas Vpu-mediated viral release is suppressed by KCNK3 channel activities [13] . When Vpu is expressed alone in primary T cells, it could behave like KCNK3/9/15 siRNA that reduces endogenous KCNK3/9/15 expression and depolarizes the cell membrane potential (Dw) [16] . Notably, the efficiency of Vpu-assisted HIV-1 release is directly correlated with the degree of membrane potential depolarization [16] .\n\nIndeed, membrane potential stability contributed by KCNK3 channels is detrimental to Vpu-mediated virus release [16] .\n\nThe mechanism of Vpu-mediated virus release and the cellular mechanism of depolarization-stimulated exocytosis are similar in the aspect that they both modulate the stability of cell membrane potential. As a proof of concept, the first aim of this study was to identify the role of KCNK3/9/15 (TASK1/3/5) channels during the exocytosis process. We previously demonstrated that depolarization by KCNK3/9/15 knockdown could accelerate HIV-1 viral release [16] . Here we found that membrane depolarization by KCNK3/9/15 siRNA or by Vpu also promoted the release of cell-derived, nonviral vesicles. Some of these cell-derived exovesicles were exosomes, enriched with the lipid second messenger-ceramide. To further dissect the nature of depolarization-stimulated secretion in vivo, we measured intracellular K ? (K in ? ) in Vpu? cells, and found it to be depleted to a pathologically low level. Reduction of intracellular K ? drives membrane potential depolarization. In contrast, heterologous expression of KCNK3 channels in primary T cells maintained K in ? , thereby reinforcing membrane polarization and suppressing depolarization-stimulated exocytosis. Our results identify the Dw-modulatory function of KCNK3/9/15 channels and Vpu viroporin in the exocytosis process.\n\nThe plasmids for GFP (pCGI) and Vpu (pCCI-Vpu) were described previously [13] . CGI (GFPIRS) and CCI are bicistronic vectors carrying reporter genes-GFP and CFP, respectively [32, 33] . To depolarize the cell membrane potentials, endogenous K 2P channels were knocked down by the KCNK3/9/15 siRNA described previously [16] . The knockdown efficiency of this KCNK3/9/15 siRNA was validated using siRNA-transfected HEK-293 cells by RT-PCR. The KCNK3-specific forward and reverse primers for PCR are 5 0 -CATCGGCTACGGGCACGCGGCAC-3 0 (KCNK3T407f) and 5 0 -GATGACCGTGAGGCCCG TAAGGATGTAG-3 0 (KCNK3T833r).\n\nHeLa cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 1X non-essential amino acids, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillinstreptomycin. HEK-293 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing the same FBS and antibiotics. Jurkat and K562 cells were maintained in RPMI media containing the same FBS and antibiotics. For primary cells, PBMC were obtained from healthy donors and maintained in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), followed by 2-3 days of phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2 activation and CD4? cell isolation by negative selection [34] . In the secretion experiments, cells were cultured in exosome-free media. The exosomes in FBS or FCS were removed by overnight ultracentrifugation at 100,0009g, 4\u00b0C, followed by 0.22-lm filtration. For membrane potential depolarization, KCNK3/9/15 or the control siRNA, each with pCGI (a GFP-reporter plasmid), was transfected into cultured cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and into primary T cells using AMAXA transfection reagents (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA).\n\nThe reticulocyte fraction was obtained from whole blood fractionation, and then transferred to a 0.4 lm-porous insert fitted in a 6-well plate. Fresh culture media were supplemented in the space between the insert and the well. After cell culture overnight, exosomes/microvesicles secreted by the reticulocytes could be found outside the culture insert in a well. These vesicles were extracted with sucrose gradients [35] . Briefly, the culture media outside a porous insert were resuspended and diluted in PBS, and then gently layered onto a sucrose cushion, followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,0009g for 75 min at 4\u00b0C. After ultracentrifugation, the sucrose cushion contained exosomes was collected with a 5-mL syringe fitted with an 18-G needle. To wash and concentrate these vesicles, this sucrose fraction was centrifuged again at 100,0009g for 75 min at 4\u00b0C, and then resuspended in 50-100 lL of PBS [36] .\n\nCD4? T cells were isolated from the buffy coat of a healthy donor using Dynabeads MyPure CD4 kit (Invitrogen), followed by 2-3 days of activation. The activated CD4? T cells were then transferred to a culture insert of 0.4-lm-porous membrane. After overnight culture, the media outside the insert were collected and subjected to vesicle isolation.\n\nThe purified exosomes/microvesicles from reticulocytes or T lymphocytes were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and then deposited 5-10 lL onto Formvar-carbon-coated EM grids. The grids loaded with the membranous particles were briefly washed with PBS and then immersed in 1% glutaraldehyde for 5 min. The grids were then extensively washed, followed by treatments of uranyl acetate for EM contrast [36] [37] [38] .\n\nTo visualize the effects of membrane potential depolarization on budding, human CD4? T cells were added with an equal volume of a high K ? balanced buffer and incubated for 45 min. The control cells were incubated with an equal volume of Hank's Balanced Saline Buffer (HBSS containing 137.9 mM NaCl, 5.33 mM KCl, 0.441 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 4.17 mM NaHCO 3 , 0.338 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 5.56 mM glucose, and 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)). The composition of the high K ? balanced buffer was modified based on the composition of HBSS to contain 140 mM K ? instead of Na ? . This high K ? balanced buffer has similar osmolarity as HBSS. After high K ? treatment, the cells were fixed with an equal volume of 5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and then with 1% OsO 4 . The cells were washed again with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and then subjected to gradual dehydration by increasing ethanol concentrations. For co-polymerization, the dehydrated cells were pelleted and gradually embedded in Spurrs' resin. The resin blocks containing cell pellets were thin-sectioned onto grids, and the sections were further stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for EM contrast. Electron microscopy for T cells and vesicles was performed by JEOL JEM-1200EXII.\n\nCultured cells or primary cells were plated on cell culture inserts of 0.4-lm-porous membrane (6-well format) for at least a day. For some experiments, 1 day after plating, the cells were transfected with siRNA and/or plasmids on the inserts, and incubated for 24-30 h to allow gene expression. At t 0 on the day of experimentation, the inserts, each layered with at least 10 6 cells, were transferred to a new 6-well culture plate containing 2 ml of HBSS or a high K ? balanced buffer. The compositions of high K ? balanced solutions were modified based on HBSS to keep the sum of [K ? ] and [Na ? ] constant. At each time point following t 0 (every 15 or 30 min), 125 lL of the buffer outside the insert in a well was retrieved and transferred to a Fluo-roNunc 96-well plate. The samples collected at each time point were stained with 5 lM of fluorescent lipid dye trimethylammonio-diphenylhexatriene (TMA-DPH, Invitrogen). TMA-DPH was excited at 350 nm and its fluorescence emission spectra were collected by SpectraMAX Gemini XS (Molecular Devices). TMA-DPH emission at each time point was subtracted with its background value obtained at t 0 , and was normalized with respect to the emission values of the control cells (set 100%). Fig. 1a ). These exovesicles were not morphologically very different from those originated from the cells incubated in 5 mM K ? . But it was not possible to accurately determine whether there were more exovesicles released from the depolarized cells by TEM. We quantified exovesicle release by fluorescence labeling of these exovesicles with a fluorescent lipid probe-TMA-DPH. TMA-DPH primarily anchors onto the positively-charged polar head groups of phospholipids [42] . Upon binding to lipid, TMA-DPH emits fluorescence; this probe does not fluoresce in aqueous solutions [43] . Because TMA-DPH fast and readily partitions between lipid and water, it has been used for labeling of exocytosed membrane [44, 45] . We validated this TMA-DPH-based, quantitative method with Jurkat cells (a cell line of T lymphocytes), and found an excellent linear correlation between the amount of TMA-DPH labeling and the quantities of cells or cell membrane (Fig. 1b) .\n\nTo distinguish exovesicles from large cell debris or shed membrane fragments, we cultured cells on 0.4-lm-porous inserts. These inserts were fitted onto culture wells, and functioned as ''sieves'' that only allowed particles with diameters smaller than 0.4 lm to pass through. A substantial portion of cell debris and membrane fragments remained inside the inserts because of their generally larger sizes or buoyancy. At the beginning of a vesicle quantitation experiment (t 0 ), the culture medium or balanced buffer outside the insert was replaced with a fresh one. For every 15 or 30 min, an aliquot (usually 1/20) of the buffer outside the insert was retrieved for TMA-DPH labeling. We observed that the fluorescence emission of TMA-DPH was significantly higher at t 30min than at t 0 (Fig. 1c) , indicating that some exovesicles/lipids had diffused from inside to outside the culture insert within the 30-min interval. To quantify vesicle release induced by depolarization, HeLa cells were transferred to a well filled with a high K ? balanced buffer at t 0 . Compared to the negative-control set immersed in 5 mM K ? , high K ? -induced depolarization enhanced vesicle release by *2 folds (Fig. 1d) . Similar depolarization-stimulated release has also been observed in HEK-293 cells and in activated human CD4? T cells.\n\nWe also tested whether depolarization triggered by knocking down major background K 2P channels could promote vesicle release. The endogenous background K 2P channels were knocked down with KCNK3/9/15 siRNA. This siRNA was previously designed to effectively reduce the expression of KCNK3 channels, and has been shown to substantially depolarize the resting membrane potentials of primary T cells, HEK-293 and HeLa cells [16] . Because this siRNA sequence also matches homologous KCNK9 (89%) and KCNK15 (95%), it is named KCNK3/9/15 siRNA. From RT-PCR experiments, the KCNK3/9/15 siRNA reduced *90% of KCNK3 at the transcription level in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 2a) . The knockdown efficiencies for KCNK9 or KCNK15 have not been evaluated, because KCNK9 or KCNK15 mRNA was not found in the cell lines we commonly used (e.g. HEK-293 cells).\n\nTo determine the function of KCNK3 during secretion, at t 0 of a TMA-DPH experiment (usually between the 24th and the 30th hour post-transfection of the control or KCNK3 siRNA), cells on porous inserts were transferred to a new 6-well plate filled with HBSS. An aliquot of HBSS outside the insert was retrieved for TMA-DPH labeling every 15 min. We found that the cells depolarized by KCNK3/9/15 siRNA indeed secreted more vesicles than the control, non-depolarized cells (Fig. 3b) . Both means of Dw reduction ((1) high K out ? and (2) KCNK3/9/15 siRNA) enhanced vesicle secretion (Figs. 1, 2) . We observed *50% more TMA-DPH-labeled membranes due to the expression of depolarizing Vpu (Fig. 3) . The differences between Vpu? and GFP? groups were significant (*P \\ 0.05 from 5 independent experiments), albeit that the increase of secretion by Vpu (*50% in Fig. 3 ) was smaller than that by KCNK3/9/15 siRNA or by high K out ? (*2 folds in Figs. 1, 2) . Because TMA-DPH also stains lipids and membranous debris, we also checked the content of secretion at the end of a typical TMA-DPH experiment (as in Fig. 3) using another TEM technique. The exocytosed particles outside the insert were isolated and concentrated by ultracentrifugation (up to 100,0009g). Under a TEM, the 0.4-lmsieved, exocytosed vesicles looked like ''half-deflated balloons'' (Fig. 4a) . Others have pointed out that these variations in EM preparation could make these submicronsized vesicles look ''cup-shaped'' [8] . For confirmation and comparison, we also isolated exosomes released from human reticulocytes. The reticulocyte-derived exosomes also exhibited irregular or cup shapes (Fig. 4b) , similar to those vesicles secreted from the depolarized T cells (Fig. 4a) .\n\nThe sizes of these secreted vesicles were less than 200 nm in diameter and somewhat heterogeneous (Fig. 4a, b) . Thus, the secretion pools probably included various types of vesicles, such as exosomes (40-100 nm in diameter) [36] , exosome-like vesicles (20-50 nm) [46] , membrane particles (50-80 nm) [2, 47] , and few microvesicles (100-1,000 nm) [48] . Despite that these exovesicles might have originated from various intracellular compartments and/or the plasma membrane, minimization of membrane potential polarization could induce their secretion. Thus, membrane depolarization is likely a general mechanism for vesicle biogenesis/ release. We further attempted to characterize these depolarization-induced exovesicles with biomarkers. In particular, we were interested in the fraction of exosomes in the secretion pool, since exosomes are biologically important and have been well characterized. We first confirmed that human reticulocyte-derived exosomes were enriched with transferrin receptor (TrnR). For convenience, we then used K562 cultured cells (of an erythroleukemic type) to generate sufficient quantities of exovesicles for this study. K562 cells were transiently transfected with GFP or GFP/Vpu, and the exovesicles secreted from these cells were concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Some of the exovesicles secreted from K562 cells also expressed transferrin receptors (TrnR), suggesting that they might be exosomes. On the other hand, not many exovesicles secreted from K562 cells or human reticulocytes expressed CD81, a tetraspanin protein and an exosome marker specific for antigen-presenting cells (data not shown). Since exosome markers are cell type-dependent, and both K562 cells and reticulocytes are not antigen-presenting cells, their exovesicles should indeed contain very little CD81. Because membrane potential depolarization should be a universal, physical mechanism for stimulation of secretion, we chose a more generalized biomarker-ceramide, to characterize these exovesicles. Ceramide is a marker for the Golgi apparatus, exosomes, and the secretory pathway for exosomes [35, 49] . We established a flow cytometrybased quantitative method for ceramide. Since the cellderived exovesicles were too small (\\200 nm in diameters) for flow cytometry, they were first labeled with BODIPY Fig. 4 The depolarization-stimulated exovesicle pool contained exosomes. Many vesicles induced by depolarization from IL-2-activated CD4? T cells (a) exhibited similar morphology as the exosomes released from human reticulocytes (b). Depolarization was induced by knockdown of endogenous KCNK3/9/15 (a, left) or by Vpu expression (a, right). Human T cells or reticulocytes were cultured on cell culture inserts of 0.4-lm-porous membrane in a 6-well plate overnight. The culture media outside the inserts were collected to extract the secreted exosomes/vesicles. The isolated and concentrated vesicles were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and deposited onto Formvar-carbon coated EM grids. The sample-loaded grids were further washed, fixed, and stained with uranyl acetate. These membranous particles were visualized by JEOL JEM-1200EXII. Bar = 200 nm. c A significant portion of the exovesicles were exosomes. The fluorescent probe, BODIPY TR C 5 -ceramide, was used to label exosomes for flow cytometric analyses. The vesicle-coated beads were found monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric in a FSC/SSC dot plot, as gated (left). BODIPY TR C 5 -ceramide labeling could be detected by the FL-2 channel for red fluorescence. BODIPY TR C 5 -ceramide-stained exovesicles were gated in the upper-right quadrant of the dot plot. For each experimental set, the control group (unstained exovesicles) was also shown, and gated in the lower-right quadrant. Over 90% of the reticulocyte-derived exosomes were positively labeled by BODIPY TR C 5 -ceramide. About half of the exovesicle population from the GFP/Vpu-transfected cells was exosomes Cell Biochem Biophys (2011) 61:585-594 591 TR C 5 -ceramide, and then coated onto aldehyde/sulfatetreated latex beads. We found that most reticulocytederived exosomes were loaded with ceramide (91.1%, Fig. 4c ). The ceramide levels were significant in *42.7% of the exovesicles originated from GFP? cells, and in *50.1% of the exovesicles from GFP/Vpu? cells (Fig. 4c ). There were also populations of non-exosome vesicles in the secretion. Interestingly, Vpu expression might be able to promote exosome secretion, as it slightly increased the proportion of exosomes in the exovesicle pools.\n\nDepolarization In Vivo Associated With Depletion of Intracellular K ?\n\nThe concentration of free K ? ions in human plasma is *5 mM, and the intracellular K ? content is generally much higher [50] . We directly measured [K ? ] in by labeling intracellular K ? ions with a K ? -specific fluorescent indicator-PBFI. As shown in Fig. 5a , increasing the extracellular K ? concentration forced [K ? ] in to increase in a non-linear fashion. Noticeably, heterologous expression of Vpu alone in the activated CD4? T cells rendered the cells to be significantly less sensitive to [K ? ] out changes, indicating a lack of K ? channel expression on their plasma membrane (Fig. 5a) . Importantly, the intracellular K ? content was significantly lower in Vpu? cells (Fig. 5a) . Because Vpu could form viroporins by itself or oligomerize with host channel subunits [16, 51] , its disruption of normal cell electrophysiology conceivably could result in a constitutive leak of intracellular K ? (Fig. 5) . From the Nernst equation, the changes of intracellular and extracellular K ? concentrations directly affect the cell membrane potential. With a decrease in [K ? ] in and insensitivity to [K ? ] out , the differences between [K ? ] in and [K ? ] out for Vpu? cells were minimized, and consequently their membrane potentials were more depolarized (Fig. 5b) . In contrast, KCNK3? cells showed higher [K ? ] in than the control cells throughout most [K ? ] out tested (Fig. 5a) , and thus their cell membrane potentials were more polarized (Fig. 5b) .\n\nThe resting membrane potentials for most cell types range from -40 to -95 mV [52] , and the electric field across a biomembrane is in the order of 10 5 V/cm [53] . This stored energy in a biomembrane is undoubtedly a significant energy constraint for any structural transition of the membrane. A relatively small reduction of Dw (such as the induced depolarization presented here) could accelerate the rate of membrane fusion/fission and increase secretion.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrated that depolarization by manipulating K ? gradients across the cell membrane could independently promote the release of membranous particles from common cultured cell lines (i.e. HEK-293 and HeLa cells) and from activated human CD4? T cells (Figs. 1, 2) . Depolarization by heterologous expression of Vpu also stimulated the release of nonviral vesicles in primary T cells (Fig. 3) . Since depolarization could lower the electrostatic repulsion on a vesicle-budding membrane [16, 53] , our results suggest that the electric field across a cell membrane is an important energy barrier for vesicle biogenesis/secretion. We identified K in ? depletion as a major cause of depolarization in vivo (Fig. 5 ). An intracellular milieu of low ? , Vpu? cells were in average 13.2 mV more depolarized than GFP? cells, whereas KCNK3? cells were 15.5 mV more hyperpolarized than GFP? cells. For comparison, if the intracellular K ? concentration were set to be 145 mM throughout all [K ? ] out , the corresponding potentials (cross symbols) in theory would be more negative than the experimental data here K ? is favored by apoptosis [54] . Notably, Vpu can independently facilitate apoptosis [55] , so Vpu-mediated apoptosis might conceivably require the viroporin activity to disrupt intracellular K ? homeostasis and Dw. In comparison, heterologous expression of KCNK3 in human CD4? T cells prevented pathological leak of K in ? (Fig. 5a ) and stabilized the cells at polarized potentials (Fig. 5b) . Could KCNK3, an antagonist of Vpu, exert protection against apoptosis during HIV-1 infection? Liu et al. [56] have shown that membrane hyperpolarization driven by various K 2P channels, including KCNK3, inhibits activation of apoptosis during cell stress in cultured rat hippocampal slices. On the other hand, Lauritzen et al. [57] have shown that KCNK9 channels could result in K in ? depletion and activation of apoptosis instead. Conceivably, the differences in KCNK channel activities, Dw stability, and cellular regulation of KCNK expression could all influence K in ? homeostasis directly, resulting in inhibition or activation of apoptosis.\n\nDuring HIV-1 infection, the main retroviral structural component-Gag is required for Vpu-mediated budding of viral and pseudoviral particles [58] . However, in the absence of Gag, Vpu expression alone still contributed *50% increase of nonviral vesicle release (Fig. 3) . These data again support the depolarization model [16] that Vpu expression directly affects the physical property of a biomembrane to promote secretion."}
