{"title": "Nonproliferative and Proliferative Lesions of the Gastrointestinal Tract, Pancreas and Salivary Glands of the Rat and Mouse", "body": "The digestive tract is the entry site into the body for orally administered test articles.\nAn irritant test article may lead to local acute lesions at this first site of contact to\nthe body and the digestive tract has been identified as the organ most commonly affected in\nBritish patients admitted to hospital with adverse drug reactions (Pirmohamed et al. 2004).\n\nOn the other hand, orally administered test articles may be highly toxic to other organs\nyet having little or no noticeable effect on the digestive tract.\n\nA distinctive feature of the digestive tract is the high proliferative rate of the\nepithelium, making it particularly sensitive to agents interfering with cell division, but\nresulting also in a high regenerative capacity. The villi enhance the surface of the\nintestine to 400\u2013500 m\u00b2 in humans. Because of the large surface area of these tissues,\naccurate assessment of potential treatment effects is almost entirely dependent on a\nthorough gross examination and sampling of focal lesions.\n\nStandardized nomenclature and diagnostic criteria are essential to harmonize the\nclassification and reporting of non-proliferative as well as proliferative histopathological\nlesions. They should facilitate communication between different research groups and\nregulatory authorities. In this way they should reduce time and efforts in the review of\nhistopathology data by regulators and minimize clarifying questions to the sponsor.\nFurthermore, standardized diagnostic criteria are a prerequisite for the generation of any\nhistorical control database of histopathological lesions. Discussions about the future need\nof concurrent control groups highlight the importance of these standards.\n\nThe INHAND Project (International\nHarmonization of Nomenclature and\nDiagnostic Criteria for Lesions in Rats and Mice) is a joint\ninitiative of the societies of toxicologic pathology from Europe (European Society of\nToxicologic Pathology - ESTP), UK (British Society of Toxicological Pathologists - BSTP),\nJapan (Japanese Society of Toxicologic Pathology - JSTP), and North America (Society of\nToxicologic Pathology - STP) to unify, update and complete the existing WHO/IARC and\nSTP/SSNDC nomenclature systems. The INHAND nomenclature and the related diagnostic criteria\nshould represent the future international standard in toxicologic pathology. They represent\na consensus of senior toxicologic pathologists and were reviewed by the INHAND-GESC\n(INHAND-Global Editorial and Steering Committee) for compliance with INHAND principles. All\nmembers of the Societies of Toxicologic Pathology involved in the INHAND process had the\nopportunity to comment to the draft version during a 6-week period.\n\nHowever, these recommendations for diagnostic criteria and preferred terminology may not be\napplicable in all situations. Purposes of specific experiments or the specific context of a\ngiven study may require deviation from this standardized nomenclature and diagnostic\ncriteria. The appropriate diagnoses are ultimately based upon on the discretion of the\nsenior toxicologic study pathologist.\n\nThe present publication provides a set of standardized terms, diagnostic criteria and\nexample images for the upper and lower digestive tract as well as for the salivary glands\nand the pancreas. The nomenclature of liver lesions has been published separately (Thoolen et al. 2010) and that of tooth\nlesions is in preparation. Like all other INHAND publications, the nomenclature and\ndiagnostic criteria for the digestive tract are also available online (website.goreni.org/).\nThe online version contains additional images and useful links to differential diagnoses\ncharacterizing it as a practical tool for diagnostic work.\n\nThe recommended nomenclature is generally descriptive rather than diagnostic. The\ndiagnostic criteria used require standard hematoxylin and eosin stained paraffin sections\nonly. Histochemical or immunohistochemical staining characteristics may be addressed in the\ncomments section of the respective lesion. Such special techniques may be required in some\nsituations, but a comprehensive discussion of these methods is outside the scope of this\npublication. Lesions of disseminated organs like blood vessels, soft tissues or peripheral\nnerves are generally described in separate publications (Kaufmann et al. 2012, Greaves et al. 2013). They are described here only in\ncases where the digestive tract is a major site of manifestation, e.g. leiomyoma of the\nintestine.\n\nLesions included in this nomenclature system may be further specified by modifiers.\nCriteria are given for modifiers that are considered to be of particular relevance. These\nmodifiers should be consistently applied. It is upon the discretion of the pathologist to\nuse additional modifiers not suggested in this nomenclature system. Such modifiers may\ndescribe the location, tissue type or duration among others. Further principles of the\nINHAND nomenclature have been published separately (Mann et al. 2012).\n\nFindings that can reliably be diagnosed grossly are also not covered by this monograph.\nThis applies in particular to some congenital malformations like intestinal duplication\n(Elangbam et al. 1998; Tamai et al. 1999).\n\nThis nomenclature system describes lesions that occur in conventional (wildtype) strains of\nrats and mice. Previous rodent nomenclatures for the digestive tract have been published by\nour societies and international WHO and other collaborative committees (Betton et al. 2001; Deschl et al. 1997; Deschl et al. 2001; Frantz et al. 1991; Leininger and Jokinen 1994; Takahashi and Hasegawa 1990; Whiteley et al. 1996). Lesions occurring\nin specific genetically engineered mouse models only are not covered in this document. For\nmore information on these specific lesions the reader should refer to relevant publications\nof workshops on genetically engineered mouse models (e.g. Boivin et al. 2003; Hruban et al. 2006).\n\nThe oral cavity/pharynx, tongue, and esophagus are components of the upper alimentary\ntract, and each has a mucosa lined by a stratified squamous epithelium with a keratinized\nsurface. Incidental nonproliferative or proliferative microscopic findings may occur in\nthese tissues as well as microscopic findings that are associated with effects of the test\narticle (systemic or direct contact exposure) or, rarely, changes related to injury from\nthe dosing (gavage) procedure.\n\nThe borders of the oral cavity are defined by several general landmarks, including the\nhard and soft palate/pharynx dorsally; the gingiva, teeth, and mucosal surfaces of the\nlips/cheeks laterally; and the floor of the mouth/tongue ventrally. Oral cavity/pharynx is\ntypically not a protocol-required tissue for microscopic evaluation, but portions may be\nsampled for examination due to a clinical sign or gross finding at necropsy. The oral\ncavity/pharynx tissue samples may include minor salivary glands (palatine, buccal),\nadjacent muscle, bone, teeth, or haired skin, in addition to the vascular and connective\ntissue of the keratinized, squamous epithelium of the mucosal surface.\n\nThe tongue is comprised of the interlacing bundles of striated muscle interspersed with\nadipocytes, scant to numerous mast cells, nerves, and vascular tissue lined with a\nsquamous mucosal surface. In the tongue of aged rats, the amount of adipose tissue has\nbeen reported to be decreased with a relative increase in its fibrous connective tissue as\ncompared to that in younger animals (Brown and Leininger 1994). The squamous mucosa of the dorsal tongue surface\ncontains numerous papillae and a large circumvallated papilla, while the lateral/ventral\nsurface is a simple stratified squamous mucosa (Hebel and Stromberg 1976; Brown and Hardisty 1990). The thin, compact lamina\npropria of the mucosa of the tongue is less dense on the ventral surface nearer the root\nattachment (frenulum) to the oral cavity surface. In the more caudal, ventral area, there\nare large lymphatic vessels, veins, and ducts from the minor salivary glands in the\nadjacent oral mucosa.\n\nThe esophagus consists of a muscle (tunica muscularis) layer with longitudinal and\ncircular-oriented striated muscle fibers and a squamous mucosa with a keratinized surface\nthat typically has small aggregates of bacterial coccoid organisms within the superficial\nlayers of keratin.\n\nThe physiology of the oral cavity, tongue, and esophagus is related primarily to their\nfunction as a conduit for food. Effects on function with the development of megaesophagus\nhave been reported in mice with abnormal myogenic plexus (Randelia and Lalitha 1988; Randelia et al. 1990), and esophageal obstruction,\nsecondary to effects of scopolamine on salivary secretion and the swallowing reflex, had\nbeen described for rats (NTP TR 445 1997).\n\nThe routine necropsy includes gross examination of the oral cavity (oropharynx), tongue,\nand esophagus. Although sampling and histologic examination of the oral cavity/pharynx are\ngenerally limited to necropsy observations, portions of these tissues may be included with\nroutine nasal or tooth sections required for possible histopathology examination. In those\ncircumstances when oral cavity structures may be considered as potential targets sites for\nnonneoplastic or neoplastic changes, whole-head fixation (calvarium and brain removed),\nmay be the better approach for consistent examination of required tissues. With whole-head\nfixation, sectioning of the nasal/oral cavities, mandible, and associated tissues can be\nperformed at various levels and result in consistent orientation for sectioning of desired\ntissue sites in these special circumstances.\n\nUnlike the oral cavity/pharynx, routine histologic sections of the tongue and esophagus\nare usually protocol-required for microscopic evaluation in all animals from toxicity and\ncarcinogenicity studies. For microscopic evaluation, the tongue may be prepared as a\nlongitudinal histologic section (see RITA trimming guide Ruehl-Fehlert et al. 2003,\nwebsite//reni.item.fraunhofer.de/reni/trimming) that provides for examination of lingual\nglands; it often may prepared as a transverse section that permits evaluation of the\ndorsal, lateral, and ventral mucosal surfaces. Depending on the cross-section level\n(midanterior versus midcaudal) of tongue taken for routine evaluation, the serous and\nmucin acini of the lingual glands and their ducts may also be present. The esophagus is\ntypically prepared as a cross-section at approximately the location of the thyroid gland;\nadjacent trachea is also included with this section. In studies where the\nthyroid/parathyroid is not required for organ weight determination, these glands may be\nleft in situ and included with the routine esophagus/trachea section (see\nRITA trimming guide Ruehl-Fehlert et\nal. 2003, website//reni.item.fraunhofer.de/reni/trimming).\n\nCongenital/developmental lesions in the oral cavity/pharynx, tongue, and esophagus\nhave been rarely reported in mice and rats from toxicity and carcinogenicity studies.\nThis is most likely due to their uncommon occurrence, exclusion of animals with these\nfindings prior to study initiation, and minimal routine sampling of this location in\nthe absence of a gross observation. In developmental and reproductive studies,\ncongenital/developmental lesions are more commonly observed.\n\n\nMay appear grossly as white nodule or cyst in the gingival mucosa.Most commonly observed in gingival mucosa of upper incisors.Consists of normal sebaceous gland acini with ducts opening to mucosal\nsurface.Presence of cysts (dilated ducts) with or without inflammation may be components\nof these ectopic glands.\n\n\n\nSebaceous gland adenoma: absence of common duct/lumen and presence of mitotic\nfigures; adenoma of ectopic sebaceous gland in the gingiva of rats has not been\nreported.\n\n\nComment: This finding is more likely observed in routine nasal cavity sections that\nmay include teeth and gingival tissue. With the exception of its correlation to a\ngross observation when a cyst/inflammation has developed, this finding is of little\nor no apparent pathologic significance.\n\n\nMidline space defect in oral mucosa and hard palate.Visible grossly or microscopically.No evidence of trauma.\n\n\n\nTrauma: Evidence of necrosis, fracture, or inflammatory response.\n\n\nComment: Cleft palate is a longitudinal defect in bone and mucosa of the midline of\nthe hard palate resulting from failure of fusion of the lateral palatine shelves\nfrom the maxillary processes (Jones et\nal. 1997).Cleft palate in mice and rats has been attributed to maternal\ntreatment with high doses of vitamin A (Kalter and Warkany 1961) and recently been\nreported as a genetic mutation in the mouse (Stottmann et al. 2010). This condition has also\nbeen produced in mice (Era et al.\n2009) and rats with in utero chemical exposure or as an effect from\npuncture of the amniotic sac (Ferguson\n1981; Schuepbach\nand Schroeder 1984). Diagnosis is based primarily on the gross\nobservation.\n\n\nThinning of the muscle and mucosal layers as result of distention of the\nesophagus with food/bedding material.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: This condition is typically related to a grossly distended esophagus\ncontaining food/bedding material and has also been diagnosed as impaction because of\nthe gross appearance. This has been described as a spontaneous or idiopathic change\n(Harkness and Ferguson\n1979; Ruben et al.\n1983) in rats and also attributed to feeding a powdered food diet (Brown and Hardisty 1990).\nEsophageal dilation associated with obstruction occurred in rats administered\nscopolamine (National Toxicology Program\n1997a) and as a background finding in several mouse strains (Haines et al. 2001; Mahler et al. 2000), in particular\nin mice with an abnormal myogenic plexus (Randelia and Lalitha 1988; Randelia et al. 1990).\nEsophageal dilation, described as megaesophagus, has also been reported as an\ninduced finding in mice with intrauterine exposure to diethylnitrosamine (Ghaisas et al. 1989) and in rats\nsecondary to effects of scopolamine on salivary secretion and the swallowing reflex\n(National Toxicology Program 1997b).\n\n\nIrregular cyst-like extension of the mucosal lumen into or through the muscularis\nlayer in the esophagus.Lumen of diverticulum that opens to mucosal surface.Focal.\n\n\n\nCyst: Isolated from mucosal surface.\n\n\nComment: Diverticulum of the esophageal mucosa has been reported in rats (Brown and Hardisty 1990).\n\n\nGross observation of congenital/developmental structural alterations.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\n\nDilated gland/ducts lined by simple squamous epithelium.Lumen of cyst may contain sebaceous secretion or keratin debris.Inflammation associated with larger or ruptured cysts.\n\n\n\nEsophageal diverticulum: Lumen opens into the esophagus lumen, epithelial\nconnection to the surface mucosa of the esophagus.\n\n\n\nDecreased thickness of mucosal epithelial layer.Focally extensive or diffuse lesion.\n\n\n\nErosion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive absence of superficial or, in severe\ncases, of all epithelial layers with extension of the alteration into the\nmuscularis. Unlike atrophy, this finding is typically associated with surface\ncellular debris and an inflammatory cell infiltrate in mucosa or as a surface\nexudate.\n\n\n\nFocal or focally extensive loss of surface epithelium in the oral cavity/pharynx,\ntongue, or esophagus.Basal lamina may remain intact (erosion) or in more severe lesions the defect in\nthe mucosa may extend into the muscularis (ulcer).Intraepithelial inflammatory cell infiltrate frequently associated with more\nsevere lesions.\n\n\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma: may present with erosion/ulcer appearance on the mucosal\nsurface. The presence of this neoplasm would preclude diagnosis of an associated\nerosion/ulcer.Atrophy, epithelial: Reduced thickness of all layers of the squamous epithelium\nor, in severe cases, absence of basal germinative layers; usually no inflammatory\ncell infiltrate.\n\n\nComment: Although there are specific morphologic criteria to differentiate the more\nsuperficial lesion (erosion; confined to the epithelial surface) from the deeper\nulcer (extension of the epithelial defect through basal cell layer/basal lamina),\nthe plane of section through smaller, focal lesions often impacts on the appearance\n(depth of the epithelial loss) of this finding. In most instances it is not\npractical to separate these changes and they are typically diagnosed under the\nsingle, combined term of erosion/ulcer with an appropriate severity grade.\n\nErosion/ulcer usually is the result of epithelial necrosis. Because of its unique\ntopography adjacent to the lumen and often involving multiple organ layers, which\nuniquely affects the progression and resolution of the lesion (e.g. margin\nhyperplasia, granulomatous tissue, inflammation), it is useful to record\nerosion/ulcer separately from epithelial necrosis.\n\nA deep ulcer of the esophagus may be perforating if it destroys all layers of the\nesophagus wall, and may be designated as such by a free text entry. However, a\nperforation resulting from a physical insult, e.g. gavage-related, typically is a\nmacroscopic lesion and generally not recorded on the light microscopic level.\n\n\nSingle cells or small clusters of cells.Cell shrinkage.Hypereosinophilic cytoplasm.Nuclear shrinkage, pyknosis, karyorrhexis.Intact cell membrane.Apoptotic bodies.Cytoplasm retained in apoptotic bodies.Phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies tissue macrophages or other adjacent cells.No inflammation.\n\n\n\nNecrosis, epithelium: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with\nnecrotic diagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.).Apoptosis/necrosis, epithelium: Both types of cell death are present and there is\nno requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for\nstatistical reasons. The term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be\ndetermined unequivocally.Erosion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive absence of superficial or, in severe\ncases, of all epithelial layers with extension of the alteration into the\nmuscularis.\n\n\nComment: The approach for the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of cell death\napplied here is based on a draft recommendation of the INHAND Cell Death\nNomenclature Working Group.\n\nApoptosis is not synonymous with necrosis. The main morphological differences\nbetween these two types of cell death are cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation\nand tingible body macrophages in apoptosis versus cell swelling, rupture and\ninflammation in necrosis; however, other morphologies (e.g. nucelar pyknosis and\nkaryorrhexis) overlap. In routine H&E sections where the morphology clearly\nrepresents apoptosis or single cell necrosis, or whereby special procedures (e.g.\nTEM or IHC for caspases) prove one or the other, individual diagnoses may be used.\nHowever, because of the overlapping morphologies, necrosis and apoptosis are not\nalways readily distinguishable via routine examination, and the two processes may\noccur sequentially and/or simultaneously depending on intensity and duration of the\nnoxious agent (Zeiss 2003). This often\nmakes it difficult and impractical to differentiate between both during routine\nlight microscopic examination. Therefore, the complex term apoptosis/necrosis may be\nused in routine toxicity studies.\n\nA differentiation between apoptosis and single cell necrosis may be required in the\ncontext of a given study, in particular if it aims for mechanistic investigations.\nTransmission electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to\nconfirm apoptosis. Other confirmatory techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to\nperform but insensitive), TUNEL (false positives from necrotic cells) or\nimmunohistochemistry for caspases, in particular caspase 3. These techniques are\nreviewed in detail by Elmore (Elmore\n2007). Some of these confirmatory techniques detect early phases of\napoptosis, in contrast to the evaluation of H&E stained sections, which detects\nlate phases only; overall interpretation of findings should take into account these\npotential differences. Thus, low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by\nevaluation of H&E stained slides only.\n\nCertain studies may require the consideration of forms of programmed cell death\nother than apoptosis which requires specific confirmatory techniques (Galluzzi et al. 2012).\n\n\nCells swollen with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm.Loss of nuclear basophilia, pyknosis and/or karyorrhexis that affects aggregates\nof cells.In more severe cases, there may be clefting and detachment of the epithelium from\nthe submucosa.Typically, the presence of degenerative cells is a component of necrosis.Minimal or slight inflammatory cell infiltrates may be present as a feature of\nnecrosis.\n\n\nSingle cell\n\n\nOnly single cells affected.\n\n\n\nApoptosis, epithelium: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with\napoptosis (cell and nucleus shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear pyknosis\netc.) and/or special techniques demonstrate apoptosis.Apoptosis/necrosis: Both types of cell death are present and there is no\nrequirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for\nstatistical reasons. The term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be\ndetermined unequivocally. Atrophy, epithelium: Reduced thickness of all layers of\nthe squamous epithelium or, in severe cases, absence of basal germinative layers;\nusually no cellular degeneration or necrosis.Erosion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive absence of superficial or, in severe\ncases, of all epithelial layers with distention of alteration into the\nmuscularis.\n\n\nComments: Epithelial necrosis usually develops into erosion/ulcer and in the past\nhas frequently been recorded as such. A separate recording of necrosis as the\ninitial event in this process is recommended when the structure of the mucosa is\nstill intact.\n\n\nBoth types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them\nseparately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons.The type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally.\n\n\n\nApoptosis, epithelium: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with\napoptosis (cell and nucleus shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear pyknosis\netc.) and/or special techniques demonstrate apoptosis and there is a requirement for\nrecording apoptosis and necrosis separately.Necrosis, epithelium: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with\nnecrotic diagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.) and\nthere is a requirement for recording apoptosis and necrosis separately.Erosion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive absence of superficial or, in severe\ncases, of all epithelial layers with distention of alteration into the\nmuscularis.\n\n\nComments: Necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine\nexamination, and the two processes may occur sequentially and/or simultaneously\ndepending on intensity and duration of the noxious agent (Zeiss 2003). This often makes it difficult and impractical\nto differentiate between both during routine light microscopic examination. In these\ncases, the combined term apoptosis/necrosis may be used. It is recommended to\nexplain in detail the use of this combined term in the narrative part of the\npathology report.\n\n\nMyocyte degeneration/necrosis of muscle fibers characterized typically by the\npresence of both swollen or contracted hyperchromatic or pale eosinophilic\ndegenerative fibers and necrotic fibers with coagulative necrosis and nuclear\npyknosis or lysis.Usually a focal change of minimal severity.Amphophilic muscle fibers consistent with a regenerative response may be present\nand a primary feature of this finding.\n\n\n\nDegeneration/necrosis or regeneration of muscular layer in conjunction with\ninflammation, edema and/or hemorrhage associated with gavage-related injury\n(discussed below under inflammation, mixed cell, gavage-related).\n\n\nComment: This change can occur as a focal lesion in the esophagus that also\nvariably includes the presence of several degenerative and/or regenerative muscle\nfibers. While potentially a test article-related or incidental finding, it may be\nrelated to very minor physical effects from the gavage procedure. Morphologic\nfeatures more conclusive of gavage-related injury such as perforation and\ninflammation are not present. In the absence of such clear, gavage-related\ninflammatory changes, degeneration/necrosis is the preferred diagnosis for this\nesophagus finding. Degeneration/necrosis of muscle fibers in the tongue may be\nrelated to test article administration (Greaves 2012).\n\n\nAffects medium or larger vessels (arterioles) of the tongue.Accumulates as a thin layer of homogenous and pale eosinophilic amyloid material\nin basal lamina of mucosa in the tongue and esophagus.Green birefringence using polarized light with Congo red stain.\n\n\n\nFibrinoid change (necrosis) in vessel walls: Deeply eosinophilic homogenous or\ncoagulative appearance of the vascular media.\n\n\nComment: Amyloid deposition occurs in the tongue and esophagus of mice, although\nmuch less frequently at these locations as compared to other locations (e.g. kidney,\nintestine).\n\nThe characteristic morphologic appearance and location of amyloid in H&E\nsections that is usually adequate to make this diagnosis. Confirmation of the\ndeposits as amyloid can be accomplished with light microscopy using special stains\nsuch as Congo red. Amyloid appears apple green under polarized light with this\nstain.\n\nThe term \u201chyaline\u201d should be used in case of uncertainties about the nature of\nextracellular deposits of hyaline material in H&E sections and the\nunavailability of a Congo red stain. Hyaline is also the appropriate term for\nhomogenously eosinophilic extracellular deposits that react negative with Congo\nred.\n\n\nBasophilic granular deposits in the wall of arteries as well as within individual\nmuscle fibers.Mineral deposits usually easily identified in routine sections but can be further\ncharacterized by special stains (Alizarin red, von Kossa).\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\n\nYellow/brown pigment (lipofuscin) in muscle fibers of the tongue.Brown/black pigment (melanin) within oral mucosa.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: Pigment (increased pigmentation) is not a common finding in the oral\ncavity/pharynx, tongue, and esophagus. When this is present, histochemistry,\nimmunohistochemistry, ultrastructural, or other laboratory methods may be required\nto characterize this material.\n\n\nIncrease in keratin on the surface of the mucosa.Focal or diffuse.Often accompanied by hyperplasia of squamous epithelium.\n\n\nOrthokeratotic\n\n\nThickened keratin layer with non-nucleated keratinized cells.\n\n\nParakeratotic\n\n\nThickened keratin layer with nucleated keratinized cells.\n\n\n\nNormal: Keratin layer that is normally less than the thickness of the mucosal\nsquamous epithelium.\n\n\nHyperplasia, squamous cell: Proliferation and thickening of the stratum\nspinosum.\n\nComment: Parakeratosis of the esophagus has been described in zinc-deficient rats\n(Barney et al. 1968). It may\nalso be induced by vitamin imbalances or hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase\ninhibitors (Sigler et al.\n1992).\n\n\nFocal, multifocal or diffuse cellular infiltrate in mucosa/muscle layers.Presence of mononuclear or polymorphonuclear leucocytes but no other histological\ncriteria of inflammation.Lesion may be associated with overlying ulceration, distended/ruptured cyst,\nself-induced traumatic lesions or dysplasia/neoplasia of the teeth in the oral\ncavity/pharynx.\n\n\n\nInflammation: In addition to the infiltrate, other morphologic features of\ninflammation such as edema, hemorrhage, necrosis and/or fibroplasia will be\npresent.Granulocytic leukemia: Infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal\nneutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils; infiltration of\nsimilar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs.Lymphoma: Infiltration of monomorphic population of lymphocytes (often with\natypical, increased and/or abnormal mitoses); infiltration of similar neoplastic\ncells is likely present in other organs.\n\n\nComment: Other examples of infiltrates based on cell type include: Infiltrate,\nmononuclear cell (representing lymphocytes and macrophages); Infiltrate, lymphocyte,\nInfiltrate, macrophage; Infiltrate, mixed (lymphocytes, neutrophils, and/or\nmacrophages).\n\n(Figures 19, 20, 21 and 22)\n\nSynonyms: Stomatitis; glossitis; pharyngitis; esophagitis - dependent on\nlocalization\n\nModifiers: Type of inflammatory cell that represents the predominant cell type in the\ninflammation\n\n\nInflammatory cell infiltrate comprised primarily of lymphocytes and\nmacrophages.Presence of other histological criteria of inflammation e.g. fibroplasia or\nfibrosis.Fibrosis may be a prominent component in a more chronic inflammatory change.May be associated with overlying ulcer, distended/ruptured cyst, or self-induced\ntraumatic lesions. In the oral cavity/pharynx, the process may be associated with\ndysplasia/neoplasia of the teeth.\n\n\n\nInfiltrate, lymphocytes OR Infiltrate mononuclear cell: Other morphological\nfeatures of inflammation such as edema, hemorrhage, necrosis and/or fibroplasia will\nbe absent.Lymphoma: Infiltration of monomorphic population of lymphocytes (often with\natypical, increased and/or abnormal mitoses); infiltration of similar neoplastic\ncells is likely present in other organs.\n\n\nComment: When a mononuclear cell infiltrate is considered to represent an\ninflammatory process (inflammation, mononuclear cell) and other morphologic features\n(fibrosis, mineralization) associated with the infiltrate suggest an\nongoing/continuing inflammatory process, the modifier \u2018chronic\u2019 may be included in\nthe diagnosis (i.e. inflammation, mononuclear cell, chronic) to better characterize\nthe finding.\n\n\nMixed inflammatory cell infiltrate consisting of variable numbers of neutrophils,\nlymphocytes or macrophages without predominance of one cell type.Edema, congestion/hemorrhage, and/or cell debris are components of the mixed cell\ninfiltrates more consistent with an inflammatory process.May be associated with overlying ulcer, distended/ruptured cyst, self-induced\ntraumatic lesions or dysplasia/neoplasia of the teeth in the oral\ncavity/pharynx.In the oral cavity/pharynx, the inflammatory process may be associated with\ndysplasia/neoplasia of the teeth. Reactive/regenerative hyperplasia of the overlying\nmucosal epithelium may also be a feature of this inflammatory response.\n\n\n\nInfiltrate, neutrophils: Other morphological features of inflammation such as\nedema, hemorrhage, necrosis and/or fibroplasia will be absent.\n\n\nComment: When a mixed cell infiltrate is considered to represent an inflammatory\nprocess (inflammation, mixed cell) with the presence of other morphologic features\n(fibrosis; granulomatous inflammation, granulation tissue and a prominence of\nneutrophils), the modifier \u2018chronic\u2019 may be included in the diagnosis (inflammation,\nmixed cell, chronic) to better characterize the finding.\n\nInflammation, mixed cell is commonly observed with gavage-related injury (Figures 21 and 22). It may have variable\nhistopathological appearance, dependent on extent of damage and duration/onset of\nthe lesion to include: perforation (typically seen macroscopically), bacterial\norganisms, or foreign material in the pharyngeal / esophageal or peripharyngeal /\nperiesophageal tissue with the variable presence of degeneration/necrosis and/or\nregeneration of muscular layer in conjunction with inflammation, edema or\nhemorrhage. If the lesion is interpreted to be secondary to gavage-related injury,\nthis may be addressed in the pathology narrative, or alternatively may be diagnosed\nas inflammation, mixed cell, gavage-related to distinguish from spontaneous and/or\ntest article-related findings.\n\n\nFocal inflammatory lesion, most often seen in mucosa, ducts of minor salivary\nglands or muscle layers of the tongue.Mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate (macrophage/multinucleated giant cell,\nlymphocyte, neutrophil) sometimes associated with an imbedded hairshaft fragment or\nother ingested foreign material (food/bedding material).\n\n\n\nAbscess: Circumscribed and grossly visible globular process with characteristic\nzonation of inner cell debris, neutrophils, and outer capsule of\nfibrosis/fibroplasias with numerous capillaries (granulation tissue).Inflammation, mixed cell: The inflammatory process lacks foreign material and/or\nmultinucleated giant cells.\n\n\n\nTypically affects muscular wall of arteries in tongue.Variable mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate within and around vessel.Possible presence of fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall.Proliferation of endothelium and thickening (fibrosis) of vessel wall.\n\n\n\nInfiltrate, inflammatory cell: May occur perivascular, but the vessel wall itself\nis unaffected.\n\n\nComment: More information and differential diagnoses are given in the INHAND\npublication of nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of the cardiovascular system\n(Berridge B et al. in\npreparation).\n\n\nIncreased eosinophilic fluid (interstitial fluid) within interstitium.\n\n\n\nInflammation, neutrophils: Usually associated with tissue and vascular damage\nresulting in exudative edema and inflammatory cell infiltrate.\n\n\nComment: Edema accompanying an inflammatory process should be recorded separately\nif it is a predominant lesion.\n\n\nPresence of erythrocytes in tissues or lumina of the upper digestive tract.\n\n\n\nAngiectasis: Blood present within dilated vascular lumina.Artifact: Erythrocytes on the surface of tissues or within lumina as a result of\nnecropsy procedures.\n\n\nComment: Hemorrhage of the tongue is a frequent finding in studies with blood\nsampling from lingual veins.\n\n\nThickening of well-differentiated squamous epithelium.Focal, multifocal, or diffuse.Growth pattern may be plaque-like, with blunt papillary projections or\nendophytic.Papillary projections not or only minimally branched and without fibrovascular\nstroma.Broad-based hyperplastic foci may have multiple straight or minimally branched\nprojections.Endophytic growth with cyst-like structures in the mucosa may occur. Cysts lined\nby well-differentiated squamous epithelium and filled with keratin; may extend into\nthe submucosa, but basement membrane is intact.Rete peg formation may be exaggerated, i.e. papillary body may show undulation\ndue to enlarged germinal layers.Often accompanied by hyperkeratosis.\n\n\nAtypical\n\n\nThickening of squamous epithelium with presence of irregular shaped or nodular\nfoci of basal or undifferentiated epithelial cells within squamous mucosa.Increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio.Abnormal cell shape/size/nuclear morphology.Keratinization of cells within deeper layers of mucosa.\n\n\n\nPapilloma, squamous cell: Generally larger with a prominent stromal fibrovascular\nstalk.Carcinoma, squamous cell: Invasion with loss of basement membrane integrity.Hyperplasia, basal cell: Downgrowth of basal cells is the predominant component;\nno cellular or nuclear atypia.Hyperplasia, squamous cell, atypical: Presence of nuclear or cellular atypia.\n\n\n\nProliferation of the basal cell layer, basophilic staining increased.Focal or diffuse.Endophytic growth pattern.No alteration of basement membrane integrity.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia, squamous cell: Thickening of the epithelium with all normally\nexisting layers.Carcinoma, squamous cell: Evidence for lost basement membrane integrity, spinous\ncells and keratinized cells proliferate, cellular atypia.\n\n\nComment: Basal cell hyperplasia and squamous cell hyperplasia may occur\nconcurrently.\n\nIsolated nests of basal cells may occur in the lamina propria, dependent on the\nplane of section through the rete peg structures. However, their discrete border\nindicates an intact basement membrane.\n\n\nCentral fibrovascular stalk with multiple finger/frond-like projections covered\nwith variably thick squamous epithelium.Squamous epithelium often heavily keratinized.Cells show orderly maturation.When occurring on the tongue, are generally dorsally located.\n\n\n\n Hyperplasia, squamous cell: Generally smaller, well-differentiated cells, absence\nof a prominent stromal component, particularly stalk.Carcinoma, squamous cell: Invasion with lost basement membrane integrity.\n\n\nComment: Clusters of epithelial cells may occur in the stalks as a result of\ntangential sectioning but are not indicative of malignant change.\n\n\nInvasion with destruction of basement membrane, often in adjacent tissue.Keratin masses on the surface and in crypts between foldings of malignant\nsquamous epithelium.Strands of malignant cells may form keratin pearls.Many mitotic figures.Cellular and nuclear pleomorphism.Spindle shaped or ovoid cells and multinucleated cells occur in poorly\ndifferentiated tumors.Individual cells often loose polarity.\n\n\n\nPapilloma, squamous cell: Generally smaller, well-differentiated cells, presence\nof a prominent stromal component, particularly as a component of a stalk, no\ndestruction and/or invasion of basement membrane.Hyperplasia, (atypical), squamous cell: Generally smaller, well-differentiated\ncells, no destruction and/or invasion of basement membrane.\n\n\n\nConsists of a solid, irregularly rounded, micronodular proliferation in the\nmuscle layer of the tongue.Minimal compression of surrounding musculature but striated muscle fibers may be\npresent in the periphery of the tumor.Relatively homogeneous population of polygonal cells with central to eccentric,\nround to oval-shaped nuclei with finely dispersed chromatin pattern. A prominent\nnucleolus may be present. Tumor cells are usually closely associated with minimal\nseparation by a delicate fibrovascular stroma. The cytoplasm is typically finely\nstippled with abundant eosinophilic granules based on H&E staining.Some tumor cells may be elongated with irregular nuclei and/or small and rounded\nwith sparsely granular cytoplasm and chromatin-dense nuclei.Mitotic figures are generally absent in this benign neoplasm.\n\n\n\nAggregates, granular cell (although there are no reports this has been observed\nin the tongue, this likely could occur early in the process, as described in the\nINHAND CNS/PNS and Female Reproductive systems): Few scattered cells to small\naggregates with minimal disturbance of normal tissue architecture and no compression\nof adjacent tissue.Tumor, granular cell malignant (although there are no reports this has been\nobserved in the tongue, there is the potential for this lesion to progress to\nmalignancy, as described in the INHAND CNS/PNS and Female Reproductive systems):\nProminent pleomorphism and/or invasion of surrounding tissue.\n\n\nComment: Benign granular cell tumor (GCT) of the tongue is rare and has not been\npreviously reported in rodents. We are currently aware of several cases of granular\ncell tumors in the tongue of Wistar rats (4 females and one male) and one case in a\nSprague Dawley rat (male) but are unaware of this neoplasm occurring in the tongue\nof mice. GCTs have been reported in the tongue as well as other sites in the dog,\ncat, horse, and a bird (Patnaik\n1993). Although uncommon, GCTs most frequently occur in the head and neck\nregion (often in the tongue) of humans with a slight predominance in females (Becelli et al. 2001; van de Loo et al., 2015). GCTs\nin the meninges of rats (Kaufmann\net al., 2012) and the reproductive tract (uterus/cervix/vagina) of rats and\nmice have also been described (Dixon\net al, 2014) but their relationship to the GCT observed in the tongue of\nrats is unknown.\n\nThe glandular stomach of rodents has histological and functional similarities to that of\nother mammals with both corpus and antral regions. It anatomically differs from other\nnon-rodent laboratory animal species and humans by the lack of a notable cardiac region in\nthe glandular mucosa and the absence of the dorsal/anterior pouch in the glandular region\nknown as the fundus. In rodents, the analogous dorsal/anterior pouch is nonglandular\nalthough the term glandular fundus is frequently used for the corpus. The term \u201cfundic\ngland\u201d has been generically applied to the human stomach to denote glands containing\nparietal (oxyntic) and/or chief (zymogenic) cells, regardless of anatomic site. Rodents do\nnot have glands in their fundus; however, the ubiquitous use of the term in medical\npathology has led to its frequent use in rodent studies. Similarly, pylorus is sometimes\nused to denote the antrum; however, its use should be limited to designating the portion\nof the antrum adjoining the gastroduodenal junction.\n\nThe surface epithelium of the glandular mucosa is a simple columnar mucous epithelium\nthat extends into the gastric pits; the depth of the gastric pit varies based on location\nin the corpus or antrum, being most shallow close to the limiting ridge and becoming\ndeeper approaching the antrum. Accordingly, the proportion of fundic glands\n(Synonym: oxyntic glands) contributing to the thickness of the corpus\nmucosa is greatest near the limiting ridge on the greater curvature and progressively\ndiminishes toward the corpus/antral junction.\n\nThe fundic glands are continuous with the gastric pit and have a simple tubular structure\nwith isthmus, neck and base regions. There are 4 cell types in the corpus: mucous neck\ncells which produce mucus; parietal or oxyntic cells which produce hydrochloric acid and\nintrinsic factor; chief or zymogenic cells which produce pepsinogen; and argentaffin or\nneuroendocrine cells that produce a variety of endocrine and paracrine hormones. The\nisthmus region serves as the site of proliferation with mucous neck cells acting as\nprogenitor cells that differentiate luminally to become mucous epithelium and basally to\nbecome the specialized cells of the fundic glands (Karam, 1999). This is reflected in differences of the turnover rate, which is at\naround 3 days in mucous cells compared to 194 day in oxyntic and 54 day in parietal cells\n(Karam, 1999). In the antrum, the glands\nare lined by mucous cells and neuroendocrine cells including those that produce gastrin.\nThe turnover rate of mucus cells is much faster at around 3 days than oxyntic or parietal\ncells (about 194 and 54, respectively) (Karam,\n1999).\n\nThe mucus phenotype of gastric epithelium and glandular cells can be identified by\nhistochemical methods, e.g. the combination Alcian blue pH 2.5 followed by PAS stain\n(Table 1).\n\nThe mucosa is supported by the connective tissue of the lamina propria and the continuous\nmuscle layer of the muscularis mucosa. Beneath the muscularis mucosa is the relatively\nloose connective tissue of the submucosa, which contains larger blood vessels, lymphatics\nand nerves, and the tunica muscularis. The external surface is covered by the serosal\nmembrane.\n\nThe esophagus enters into the nonglandular region of the rodent stomach. Functionally,\nthe nonglandular stomach serves as a temporary storage organ and, due to prolonged\nexposure, is potentially a major site for interaction with test articles entering the body\nvia oral ingestion. As a result of this storage function, the presence of irritants in the\ndiet may quickly lead to damage and inflammation in this area. The lower pH in the\nnonglandular stomach when compared to the esophagus may be of major importance, as it may\ninfluence the diffusion of test articles into the lipophilic squamous epithelium.\n\nIn the stomach, food undergoes mechanical and chemical breakdown to form chyme which then\npasses into the duodenum for further digestion. Mechanical breakdown is achieved through\nthe churning action of the tunica muscularis and chemical breakdown results from the\naction of digestive juices secreted from the glandular mucosa. The glandular mucosa\nproduces an acidic watery secretion containing pepsinogen. Pepsinogen is converted into\nactive pepsin in the acid environment which then hydrolyses proteins into polypeptide\nfragments. Self digestion of the stomach mucosa is prevented by a layer of surface mucous\nwhich has a higher pH than the gastric juice due to secretion of bicarbonate ions by the\nsurface mucous cells. Changes in, or loss of, the mucous layer by test articles may\nquickly lead to erosion and ulceration of the glandular epithelium. On the other hand\ncomplete inhibition of acid secretion by test articles will lead to hypergastrinemia\nwhich, if maintained, leads to proliferation of the enterochromaffin-like cells.\n\nAttention should be paid to the amount and nature of the stomach contents at necropsy. A\nstomach abnormally distended with food, particularly in a rodent fasted overnight, may\nindicate that the test article and/or vehicle is inhibiting gastric function, and this may\nhave lead to reflux of stomach contents and entry of gastric contents into the respiratory\ntract (Damsch et al. 2011).\nConversely, a stomach grossly distended with gas is often an indication in a rodent that\nthere has been a blockage in the upper respiratory tract resulting in dyspnoea, mouth\nbreathing and aerophagia.\n\nIn its natural configuration, the non-distended stomach has an irregularly folded mucosa\nand submucosa. Consistent opening and positioning during fixation and trimming are\nnecessary to obtain standardized sections of both glandular corpus and antrum and\nnonglandular stomach with correct orientation of the muscularis, submucosa and mucosa.\n\nAt necropsy, the stomach should be opened along its greater curvature to the proximal\npart of the duodenum, any ingesta washed off with isotonic saline and then pinned to a\nrigid surface (e.g. cork). The stomach should be gently but sufficiently stretched to\nproduce a flattened surface of both nonglandular and glandular regions but excessive\nstretching should be avoided. Alternatively, the pylorus may be ligated and the stomach\ninflated with fixative for a short period, before opening and flattening between filter\npaper prior to further fixation (Mahler et\nal. 2000) However, an excessive volume must not be used to avoid excessive\nstretching.\n\nTrimming of stomach should be undertaken as specified in the goRENI trimming guide\n(website.reni.item.fraunhofer.de/reni/trimming) so that standardized sections of\nnonglandular epithelium, corpus, antrum and pyloric-duodenal junction are obtained. The\nratios of parietal and chief cells in the fundic glands and the height of the mucosa vary\nbetween lesser and greater curvature so inter-animal variation in trimming needs to be\navoided and a sensitivity to topography maintained. Furthermore it is important to\nrecognize that the glandular corpus mucosa may be minimal or absent along the lesser\ncurvature with the antral mucosa extending to the limiting ridge.\n\nIn the following sections, lesions that may affect the nonglandular and glandular regions\nin a similar manner are described only once.\n\n\nMost commonly seen in nonglandular stomach or near the limiting ridge in\nglandular mucosa.Keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.Mucous cells occasionally present.May extend into submucosa/tunica muscularis.Lumen frequently contains keratinized material which may be mineralized.May be surrounded by chronic inflammation.\n\n\n\nCarcinoma, squamous cell: Epithelial atypia and invasive growth patterns with\npenetration of basement membrane by single cells or nests of neoplastic cells.\n\n\nComment: While squamous cysts are most likely to be of congenital origin they may\npotentially form during life secondary to derangement of the epithelium e.g. in an\ninflammatory process. If post-inflammatory extension is the suspected pathogenesis,\nthe pathologist may choose to interpret the focal change as a diverticulum, rather\nthan a congenital cyst.\n\n\nNormally formed pancreatic acini in mucosa or submucosa. Islets of Langerhans may\nalso be present.Normally formed hepatocytes present in cords or nests in mucosa or submucosa;\nbinucleate cells may be present.\n\n\n\nAdenocarcinoma: Formation of hepatocyte-like cells has been reported in human\ngastric adenocarcinoma.\n\n\nComment: Ectopic pancreatic acini or hepatocytes are rare incidental findings in\nrats and mice (Maekawa et al.\n1996; Brown and\nHardisty 1990), but ectopic differentiation may be a feature of some\nengineered mice (Fukuda et al.\n2006). In one publication, hepatocytes accompanied fundic gland\nabnormalities in the mouse and it was not clear whether they represented metaplasia\nor congenital heterotopia (Leininger et al. 1990); the same conundrum may apply to ectopic pancreatic\nfoci. Metaplasia to a pancreatic cell type was reported as part of a hypertrophic\ngastropathy in a strain of rat (WTC-dfk) which has a deletion of the potassium\nchannel Kcnq1 gene (Kuwamura et al.\n2008). Ectopic pancreatic tissue also may occur rarely in the pyloric\nsubmucosa of mice (Maekawa et al.\n1996).\n\n\nFocally extensive or diffuse lesion.Decreased thickness of mucosal epithelial layer.\n\n\n\nErosion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive absence of superficial or, in severe\ncases (ulcer) of all epithelial layers.Artifact: Excessive stretching due to food contents or stretching stomach at\nnecropsy leads to decreased thickness of all layers of the gastric wall.\n\n\n\nCells of squamous epithelium have a pale staining, vacuolated appearance.May be accompanied by edema in the submucosa and vacuolation of the\nmuscularis.\n\n\n\nArtifacts.\n\n\nComment: Epithelial vacuolation and vesiculation along with submucosal edema was\ndescribed in rats after administration of ethyl acrylate as a forerunner to necrosis\nand erosion/ulcer (Ghanayem et al.\n1985).\n\nCertain compounds may specifically cause vacuolation of the squamous epithelium\nadjacent to the limiting ridge.\n\n\nSingle cells or small clusters of cells.Cell shrinkage.Hypereosinophilic cytoplasm.Nuclear shrinkage, pyknosis, karyorrhexis.Intact cell membrane.Apoptotic bodies.Cytoplasm retained in apoptotic bodies.Phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies tissue macrophages or other adjacent cells.No inflammation.\n\n\n\nNecrosis, epithelium: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with\nnecrotic diagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.).Apoptosis/necrosis, epithelium: Both types of cell death are present and there is\nno requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for\nstatistical reasons. The term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be\ndetermined unequivocally.Erosion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive absence of superficial or, in severe\ncases, of all epithelial layers with extension of the alteration into the\nmuscularis.\n\n\nComment: The approach for the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of cell death\napplied here is based on a draft recommendation of the INHAND Cell Death\nNomenclature Working Group.\n\nApoptosis is not synonymous with necrosis. The main morphological differences\nbetween these two types of cell death are cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation\nand tingible body macrophages in apoptosis versus cell swelling, rupture and\ninflammation in necrosis; however, other morphologies (e.g. nucelar pyknosis and\nkaryorrhexis) overlap. In routine H&E sections where the morphology clearly\nrepresents apoptosis or single cell necrosis, or whereby special procedures (e.g.\nTEM or IHC for caspases) prove one or the other, individual diagnoses may be used.\nHowever, because of the overlapping morphologies, necrosis and apoptosis are not\nalways readily distinguishable via routine examination, and the two processes may\noccur sequentially and/or simultaneously depending on intensity and duration of the\nnoxious agent (Zeiss 2003). This often\nmakes it difficult and impractical to differentiate between both during routine\nlight microscopic examination. Therefore, the complex term apoptosis/necrosis may be\nused in routine toxicity studies.\n\nA differentiation between apoptosis and single cell necrosis may be required in the\ncontext of a given study, in particular if it aims for mechanistic investigations.\nTransmission electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to\nconfirm apoptosis. Other confirmatory techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to\nperform but insensitive), TUNEL (false positives from necrotic cells) or\nimmunohistochemistry for caspases, in particular caspase 3. These techniques are\nreviewed in detail by Elmore (Elmore\n2007). Some of these confirmatory techniques detect early phases of\napoptosis, in contrast to the evaluation of H&E stained sections, which detects\nlate phases only; overall interpretation of findings should take into account these\npotential differences. Thus, low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by\nevaluation of H&E stained slides only.\n\nCertain studies may require the consideration of forms of programmed cell death\nother than apoptosis which requires specific confirmatory techniques (Galluzzi et al. 2012).\n\n\nCells swollen with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm.Loss of nuclear basophilia, pyknosis and/or karyorrhexis that affects aggregates\nof cells.In more severe cases, there may be detachment of the epithelium from the\nsubmucosa.Typically, the presence of degenerative cells is a component of necrosis.Minimal or slight inflammatory cell infiltrates may be present as a feature of\nnecrosis.\n\n\nSingle cell\n\n\nOnly single cells affected.\n\n\n\nApoptosis, squamous epithelium: The morphologic features of cell death clearly\nfit with apoptosis (cell and nucleus shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear\npyknosis etc.) and/or special techniques demonstrate apoptosis.Apoptosis/necrosis, squamous epithelium: Both types of cell death are present and\nthere is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred\nfor statistical reasons. The term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be\ndetermined unequivocally.Atrophy, squamous epithelium: Reduced thickness of all layers of the squamous\nepithelium or, in severe cases, absence of basal germinative layers; usually no\ncellular degeneration or necrosis.Erosion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive absence of superficial or, in severe\ncases, of all epithelial layers with distention of alteration into the\nmuscularis.\n\n\nComments: Epithelial necrosis usually develops into erosion/ulcer and in the past\nhas frequently been recorded as such. A separate recording of necrosis as the\ninitial event in this process is recommended when the structure of the mucosa is\nstill intact.\n\n\nBoth types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them\nseparately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons.The type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally.\n\n\n\nApoptosis, squamous epithelium: The morphologic features of cell death clearly\nfit with apoptosis (cell and nucleus shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear\npyknosis etc.) and/or special techniques demonstrate apoptosis and there is a\nrequirement for recording apoptosis and necrosis separately.Necrosis, squamous epithelium: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit\nwith necrotic diagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.)\nand there is a requirement for recording apoptosis and necrosis separately.Erosion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive absence of superficial or, in severe\ncases, of all epithelial layers with distention of alteration into the\nmuscularis.\n\n\nComments: Necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine\nexamination, and the two processes may occur sequentially and/or simultaneously\ndepending on intensity and duration of the noxious agent (Zeiss 2003). This often makes it difficult and impractical\nto differentiate between both during routine light microscopic examination. In these\ncases, the combined term apoptosis/necrosis may be used. It is recommended to\nexplain in detail the use of this combined term in the narrative part of the\npathology report.\n\n\nFocal or multifocal.Ulcers will be associated with acute/chronic inflammatory cell infiltration in\nsubmucosa.Basal lamina may remain intact (erosion) or in the more severe cases defect in\nthe mucosa and inflammation will extend to the tunica muscularis and serosa\n(ulcer).Hyperplasia is often present in the surrounding epithelium.Hemorrhage may be seen with larger ulcers.\n\n\n\nCarcinoma, squamous cell: May show secondary ulceration, but always penetration\nof basement membrane by single cells or nests of neoplastic cells.Necrosis, squamous epithelial: No superficial or deep loss of epithelial\ncells.Artifacts: Mucosal loss due to manual or processing artifact \u2013 inflammation will\nbe absent.\n\n\nComment: Ulcers in the nonglandular epithelium are often seen macroscopically as\nmultiple small dark depressed areas surrounded by raised areas of whitened\nepithelium(Maekawa 1994). Whilst\nulcers have been induced by a wide range of irritant agents, the cause of ulceration\nin control animals is often unclear, although advanced age, parasitism, infection,\ndiet, feeding regimen, generalized debility and stress can play a role (Maekawa 1994; Maekawa et al. 1996; Greaves 2012). Protein restriction and starvation have\nalso been shown to produce ulcers (Boyd\net al. 1970).\n\nAlthough there are specific morphologic criteria to differentiate the more\nsuperficial lesion (erosion; confined to the epithelial surface) from the deeper\nulcer (full penetration of the mucosa to the muscularis mucosa), the plane of\nsection through smaller, focal lesions often impacts on the appearance (depth of the\nepithelial loss) of this finding. In most instances it is not practical to separate\nthese changes and they are typically diagnosed under the single, combined term of\nerosion/ulcer with an appropriate severity grade.\n\nErosion/ulcer usually is the result of epithelial necrosis. Because of its unique\ntopography adjacent to the lumen and often involving multiple organ layers, which\nuniquely affects the progression and resolution of the lesion (e.g. margin\nhyperplasia, granulomatous tissue, inflammation), it is useful to record\nerosion/ulcer separately from epithelial necrosis.\n\nA deep ulcer may be perforating if it destroys all layers of the gastric wall, and\nmay be designated as such by a free text entry. However, a perforation resulting\nfrom a physical insult, e.g. gavage-related, typically is a macroscopic lesion and\ngenerally not recorded on the light microscopic level.\n\n\nIncrease in the thickness of the keratin layer on the luminal epithelial\nsurface.\n\n\nOrthokeratotic\n\n\nThickened keratin layer with non-nucleated keratinized cells.\n\n\nParakeratotic\n\n\nThickened keratin layer with nucleated keratinized cells.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia, squamous cell: Proliferation and thickening of the stratum\nspinosum.\n\n\nComments: Hyperkeratosis occurs often in association with hyperplasia of underlying\nepithelium. Alternatively, it may be observed in the absence of hyperplasia under\ncircumstances suggesting anorexia and a presumptive lack of mechanical abrasion.\n\nHyperkeratosis can be a frequent observation attributable to local irritation of\norally administered test articles in toxicity studies (Til et al. 1988). The local irritant effect is\npresumably potentiated by increased duration of exposure associated with\nintragastric storage and increased contact, if test article precipitates in the\ngastric compartment.\n\n\nLined by well-differentiated cuboidal to flattened epithelial cells; no\natypia.Lumen may contain mucus.Usually multifocal.\n\n\n\nCysts, glandular: Marked dilatation of glands lined by flattened epithelial\ncells.Diverticulum, cystic OR atypical, cystic: extension of dilated glands through\nmuscularis mucosae, into submucosa and further in some cases.Atrophy, mucosa: Dilated glands may be present as part of the atrophic\nchanges.\n\n\nComment: Dilatation, glands is a common observation in the rat stomach and usually\nnot reported by toxicological pathologists unless it shows a treatment-related\ntrend\n\n\nMarked dilatation of glands.Lined by well-differentiated flattened epithelial cells. No atypia.Lumen may contain mucus.Luminal contents may be mineralized.May be surrounded by chronic inflammation.Very occasionally squamous metaplasia is present in cysts.\n\n\n\nDiverticulum, cystic OR atypical, cystic: Extension of glands through muscularis\nmucosae, into submucosa and further in some cases.Hyperplasia, atypical: Focal hyperchromatic lesion with cellular atypia and\npleomorphism.Adenocarcinoma: Multiple layers of lining epithelium with varying degrees of\ndysplasia. True infiltrative growth with loss of basement membrane integrity and\noften with a scirrhous stromal reaction.Atrophy, mucosa: Cysts may be present as part of the atrophic changes.\n\n\nComment: Glandular cysts may be congenital but most are acquired as their incidence\nincreases with age in both rats and mice (Brown and Hardisty 1990; Maekawa et al. 1996). In the\nFischer rat they are more common in the antrum than in the fundus (Brown and Hardisty 1990).\nWhen cysts extend through the muscularis mucosae, the diagnostic term \u201cdiverticulum,\ncystic\u201d or \u201cdiverticulum, atypical, cystic\u201d should be used.\n\n\nDecreased numbers of a one or more cell types. Remaining cells may be small\nand/or poorly differentiated.Reduced mucosal thickness in advanced cases, although compensatory hyperplasia of\nless differentiated epithelial cells can mask this.Dilatation of atrophic glands.Focal areas of atrophy may be seen with aging.\n\n\n\nArtifact: Over stretched stomach during \u2018pinning\u2019 at necropsy leading to a\nreduction in thickness of all layers of the gastric wall.Secretory depletion, mucus: Reduction of mucous cell size due to reduced amounts\nof mucus but no loss of cells.\n\n\nComment: At least two different types of atrophy can be distinguished. In one type,\natrophy broadly affects all mucosal cell types resulting in an overall reduction in\nmucosal height with maintenance of relatively normal cellular composition. Under\nother circumstances a specific cell type may be atrophic with the loss of specific\nfunctionality.\n\nAtrophy affecting all cell types of the gastric mucosa can be produced by\nstarvation, antrectomy or deletion of the gastrin gene which removes the trophic\nstimulation of gastrin (Greaves\n2012). Analogous changes may be produced by test articles that block the\nsecretion or activity of gastrin (Dethloff et al. 1997). In contrast, chronic inflammation and some\nxenobiotics can cause loss of specific cell types (Greaves 2012). In addition, in the lesions associated\nwith helicobacter infections in mice it has been noted that chief cells are lost\nbefore parietal cells (Rogers\nand Houghton 2009; Rogers\n2012). Focal or diffuse atrophy of the mucosa can occur with age in rodents\nwhere there is partial replacement of the glands by fibrous connective tissue (Brown and Hardisty 1990).\n\n\nCytoplasmic vacuolation, swelling.Occasional Apoptosis/single cell necrosis may also be present.\n\n\n\nAutolysis: Destruction and loss of cell types but often occurs preferentially at\nthe luminal surface.Depletion, mucus: Only mucous cells affected, no other cytological changes.\n\n\nComment: Vacuolation with no or minimal evidence of cell loss can be induced by\nagents that inhibit gastric acid secretion (Dethloff et al. 1997; Karam and Alexander 2001). In addition,\ndegeneration is observed with anticancer cytotoxic agents, ulcerogenic agents and\nagents that decrease mucosal blood supply, or test articles that sequester in\nparietal cells (Ito et al. 2000;\nBertram et al. 2013; Greaves 2012). Depending on the nature\nand severity of the insult, degeneration will be followed by necrosis, erosion/ulcer\nof the epithelium, inflammation and/or hemorrhage.\n\n\nIntact epithelial layer.Replacement of normal clear cytoplasm with more basophilic cytoplasm containing\nlittle or no mucus.\n\n\n\nDegeneration, epithelial: Additional cytological features apart from reduction in\nmucus.Atrophy, mucous cell: Reduced number of mucus cells in addition to mucus\ndepletion.\n\n\nComment: Mucus depletion may develop secondary to spontaneous inflammatory lesions\nand drug-induced lesions (Greaves\n2012). Qualitative changes in mucus composition may accompany depletion as\ndescribed following administration of aspirin, anti-inflammatory agents and\nadrenocortical steroids (Ishihara\net al. 1984; Bertram et al.\n2013; Greaves 2012). These\nsubstances may also alter the phospholipids present in the mucus layer thereby\nreducing the protective hydrophobic barrier properties and a loss of functional\nintegrity. Administration of histamine H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump\ninhibitors that reduce gastric acid secretion have also been shown to reduce total\nand sulphated glycoproteins along with reduction in mucus (Yoshimura et al. 1996).\n\n\nIntensely pink-red cytoplasmic droplets and/or crystals in surface/mucous cells,\nmost often adjacent to the limiting ridge.May extend into and/or replace fundic glands in advanced cases.Cells are usually hypertrophic.Can be single or multiple (focal or multifocal).Crystals if present may be intracellular or extracellular.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: Mucous epithelial cells distended with bright, hyaline eosinophilic\ncytoplasm occur infrequently in rodents either as a spontaneous change or associated\nwith another lesion e.g. inflammation (especially eosinophilic) or lymphoma\ninfiltration (Bertram et al.\n1996). They are usually observed in mucus neck cells of the glandular\nmucosa near the limiting ridge and occasionally may be accompanied by hyaline\neosinophilic crystals. Eosinophilic globules may be considered a precursor of these\ncrystals. Formation of these cells is also associated with the administration of\ngastric antisecretory agents although the incidence is not proportional to the\nneuroendocrine cell hyperplasia which also occurs with these agents (Betton et al. 1988). The\neosinophilic granules are similar to those seen in other epithelia e.g. upper and\nlower respiratory tract or pancreas (Leininger et al. 1999; Renne et al. 2009). Once thought to be accumulation\nof mucosubstances or pepsinogen, they have been shown to be composed of a Ym1/Ym2 a\nchitinase-like protein that may be produced in response to mucosal irritation (Ward et al. 2001; Rogers and Houghton 2009).\nThe use of the term hyalinosis for this lesion will potentially cause confusion in\nsafety assessment as the same term may also be used for a distinctly different\nclinical disorder in humans and can be used to describe vascular and renal\nglomerular changes.\n\n\nSingle cells or small clusters of cells.Cell shrinkage.Hypereosinophilic cytoplasm.Nuclear shrinkage, pyknosis, karyorrhexis. Intact cell membrane.Apoptotic bodies.Cytoplasm retained in apoptotic bodies.Phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies tissue macrophages or other adjacent cells.No inflammation.\n\n\n\nNecrosis, mucosa: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with\nnecrotic diagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.).Apoptosis/necrosis, mucosa: Both types of cell death are present and there is no\nrequirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for\nstatistical reasons. The term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be\ndetermined unequivocally.Erosion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive penetration of the mucosa, either\npartial (erosion) or full to the muscularis mucosa (ulcer).\n\n\nComment: The approach for the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of cell death\napplied here is based on a draft recommendation of the INHAND Cell Death\nNomenclature Working Group.\n\nApoptosis is not synonymous with necrosis. The main morphological differences\nbetween these two types of cell death are cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation\nand tingible body macrophages in apoptosis versus cell swelling, rupture and\ninflammation in necrosis; however, other morphologies (e.g. nucelar pyknosis and\nkaryorrhexis) overlap. In routine H&E sections where the morphology clearly\nrepresents apoptosis or single cell necrosis, or whereby special procedures (e.g.\nTEM or IHC for caspases) prove one or the other, individual diagnoses may be used.\nHowever, because of the overlapping morphologies, necrosis and apoptosis are not\nalways readily distinguishable via routine examination, and the two processes may\noccur sequentially and/or simultaneously depending on intensity and duration of the\nnoxious agent (Zeiss 2003). This often\nmakes it difficult and impractical to differentiate between both during routine\nlight microscopic examination. Therefore, the complex term apoptosis/necrosis may be\nused in routine toxicity studies.\n\nA differentiation between apoptosis and single cell necrosis may be required in the\ncontext of a given study, in particular if it aims for mechanistic investigations.\nTransmission electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to\nconfirm apoptosis. Other confirmatory techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to\nperform but insensitive), TUNEL (false positives from necrotic cells) or\nimmunohistochemistry for caspases, in particular caspase 3. These techniques are\nreviewed in detail by Elmore (Elmore\n2007). Some of these confirmatory techniques detect early phases of\napoptosis, in contrast to the evaluation of H&E stained sections, which detects\nlate phases only; overall interpretation of findings should take into account these\npotential differences. Thus, low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by\nevaluation of H&E stained slides only.\n\nCertain studies may require the consideration of forms of programmed cell death\nother than apoptosis which requires specific confirmatory techniques (Galluzzi et al. 2012).\n\n\nCells swollen with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm.Loss of nuclear basophilia, pyknosis and/or karyorrhexis that affects aggregates\nof cells.In more severe cases, there may be detachment of the epithelium from the\nsubmucosa.Typically, the presence of degenerative cells is a component of necrosis.Minimal or slight inflammatory cell infiltrates may be present as a feature of\nnecrosis.\n\n\nSingle cell\n\n\nOnly single cells affected.\n\n\n\nApoptosis, mucosa: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with\napoptosis (cell and nucleus shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear pyknosis\netc.) and/or special techniques demonstrate apoptosis.Apoptosis/necrosis, mucosa: Both types of cell death are present and there is no\nrequirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for\nstatistical reasons. The term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be\ndetermined unequivocally.Atrophy: Reduced thickness of all layers of the squamous epithelium or, in severe\ncases, absence of basal germinative layers; usually no cellular degeneration or\nnecrosis.Erosion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive penetration of the mucosa, either\npartial (erosion) or full to the muscularis mucosa (ulcer).\n\n\nComments: Epithelial necrosis usually develops into erosion/ulcer and in the past\nhas frequently been recorded as such. A separate recording of necrosis as the\ninitial event in this process is recommended when the structure of the mucosa is\nstill intact.\n\n\nBoth types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them\nseparately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons.The type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally.\n\n\n\nApoptosis: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis\n(cell and nucleus shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear pyknosis etc.)\nand/or special techniques demonstrate apoptosis and there is a requirement for\nrecording apoptosis and necrosis separately. Necrosis, mucosa: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with\nnecrotic diagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.) and\nthere is a requirement for recording apoptosis and necrosis separately.Erosion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive penetration of the mucosa, either\npartial (erosion) or full to the muscularis mucosa (ulcer).\n\n\nComments: Necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine\nexamination, and the two processes may occur sequentially and/or simultaneously\ndepending on intensity and duration of the noxious agent (Zeiss 2003). This often makes it difficult and impractical\nto differentiate between both during routine light microscopic examination. In these\ncases, the combined term apoptosis/necrosis may be used. It is recommended to\nexplain in detail the use of this combined term in the narrative part of the\npathology report.\n\n\nFocal or multifocal.Epithelial cells are absent but muscolaris mucosa is intact (erosion).Epithelial cells are absent and muscularis mucosa has been destroyed (ulcer).Ulceration will be associated with acute/chronic inflammatory cell infiltration\nin submucosa.In the more severe cases ulceration and/or inflammation will extend into the\ntunica muscularis and serosa.Hyperplasia is often present in the surrounding epithelium.May be associated with foreign bodies (plant fibers) in submucosa.Hemorrhage may be seen with larger ulcers.\n\n\n\nAdenocarcinoma: May show secondary ulceration, but penetration of basement\nmembrane by single cells or nests of neoplastic cells always present.Artifacts: Mechanical loss of mucosa during necropsy; plane of section due to\norientation of tissue in block.Autolysis: All tissues in stomach affected but there is often preferential\ndestruction and loss of cells at the luminal surface.\n\n\nComment: Erosions and ulcers develop in rodents following stress, bile reflux,\nchanges in acid secretion and hypoxia (Bertram et al. 2013; Greaves 2012; Haschek et al. 2010). Certain types of\nxenobiotics e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and ethyl alcohol are well\nknown ulcerogenic agents but ulcers have also been induced by innocuous substances\ne.g. saline glucose when given as hyperosmolar solutions (Puurunen et al. 1980). Ulcers can also reflect\nsystemic disease e.g. associated with uremia. Small focal erosions can occur in the\nglandular corpus of both rats and mice following overnight fasting.\n\nAlthough there are specific morphologic criteria to differentiate the more\nsuperficial lesion (erosion; confined to the epithelial surface) from the deeper\nulcer (full penetration of the mucosa to the muscularis mucosa), the plane of\nsection through smaller, focal lesions often impacts on the appearance (depth of the\nepithelial loss) of this finding. In most instances it is not practical to separate\nthese changes and they are typically diagnosed under the single, combined term of\nerosion/ulcer with an appropriate severity grade.\n\nErosion/ulcer usually is the result of epithelial necrosis. Because of its unique\ntopography adjacent to the lumen and often involving multiple organ layers, which\nuniquely affects the progression and resolution of the lesion (e.g. margin\nhyperplasia, granulomatous tissue, inflammation), it is useful to record\nerosion/ulcer separately from epithelial necrosis.\n\nA deep ulcer may be perforating if it destroys all layers of the gastric wall, and\nmay be designated as such by a free text entry. However, a perforation resulting\nfrom a physical insult, e.g. gavage-related, typically is a macroscopic lesion and\ngenerally not recorded on the light microscopic level.\n\n\nParietal and/or chief cells in corpus mucosa replaced by round, foamy, lightly\nbasophilic cells resembling duodenal Brunner\u2019s gland cells. Concurrent loss of\noxyntic glandular cells implicates an effect on the differentiation of the glandular\nepithelium.Increased numbers of such cells may be present (hyperplasia).Histochemical staining with Alcian blue/PAS pH 2.5 shows that cells express\nincreased gastric-type neutral mucins (red) as well as antral gland and\nintestinal-type acid mucins (blue).\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: Evaluation in H&E sections limits the characterization of this mucosal\nchange to hypertrophy, hyperplasia and/or vacuolation. This may occur spontaneously\nor in response to chronic injury. Histochemical stains and immunochemical markers\nfacilitate further characterization of the change as a metaplastic shift in the\nmucous secretory phenotype of the cells. Several classes of metaplasia have been\nidentified based on these additional techniques, which may have relevance for\nmodeling human gastric pathogenesis. True intestinal metaplasia (metaplasia with\ndevelopment of a genuine intestinal phenotype) is very rare in rodents but has been\ninduced by PCBs in mice (Morgan et\nal. 1981). \u201cPseudopyloric\u201d metaplasia where the cells resemble antral cells\nmorphologically and histochemically is much more common. Authentic intestinal\nmetaplasia is best confirmed by immunohistochemistry for the intestinal-specific\nnuclear protein Cdx2 (Fox et al.\n2007). Pseudopyloric/intestinal metaplasia occurs in the rodent stomach as\na change associated with some experimentally induced cancers (e.g. following\nadministration of polychlorinated biphenyls), localized ionizing radiation,\ninjection of xenogenic stomach antigens and the non carcinogen, iodoacetamide (Greaves 2012), as well as infectious\nmodels in mice such as H. felis and H. pylori (Leininger et al. 1999; Rogers and Fox 2004).\n\n\nDeposition of pale amorphous, homogenous eosinophilic material.Location is extracellular in connective tissue and/or blood vessel walls.Green birefringence with Congo red stain when viewed under polarized light.\n\n\n\nHyaline connective tissue: Congo red negative.Fibrinoid necrosis of blood vessels: Other evidence of tissue damage in\nsection.\n\n\nComment: Amyloid deposition may occur in the stomach mucosa as part of systemic\namyloidosis but it is not one of the predilection sites. Amyloidosis is extremely\nrare in rats but common in some strains of mice. In susceptible strains a number of\nfactors including gender, diet, housing conditions, stress, endocrine status and\nmicrobiological status can influence the occurrence of amyloidosis (Lipman et al. 1993). For as yet\nunidentified reasons the previously susceptible CD-1 strain in Europe now rarely\ndevelops amyloidosis.\n\nThe characteristic morphologic appearance and location of amyloid in H&E\nsections that is usually adequate to make this diagnosis. Confirmation of the\ndeposits as amyloid can be accomplished with light microscopy using special stains\nsuch as Congo red. Amyloid appears apple green under polarized light with this\nstain.\n\nThe term \u201chyaline\u201d should be used in case of uncertainties about the nature of\nextracellular deposits of hyaline material in H&E sections and the\nunavailability of a Congo red stain. Hyaline is also the appropriate term for\nhomogenously eosinophilic extracellular deposits that react negative with Congo\nred.\n\n\nMineral may be found in the muscle layers, blood vessels, basement membranes\nand/or in the interstitium of mucosa and submucosa.Interstitial mineral occurs predominantly in a band paralleling the parietal\ncell-rich region of the corpus mucosa.Acellular basophilic material.Mucosal mineralization can be limited to small focal deposits.Diffuse mineralization of the corpus mucosa may be accompanied by degenerative\nchanges or mucous cell hyperplasia in neighboring glands.\n\n\n\nArtifact: Hematoxylin stain precipitate.Bacteria: Colonies of bacteria may be confused with mineral due to their\nbasophilic staining. Ante mortem bacterial invasion will be accompanied by necrosis\nand usually inflammation; postmortem bacterial invasion will be accompanied by\nautolysis.Osseous metaplasia: Osteoid present.\n\n\nComment: Presence of mineral can be confirmed with von Kossa or Alizarin red stains\nbut these are rarely needed to make a diagnosis. Multifocal or diffuse\nmineralization occurs secondary to chronic renal disease in rodents (Leininger et al. 1999; Brown and Hardisty 1990) and\nin situations where serum calcium and/or phosphate balances are perturbed e.g.\nfollowing intravenous administration of salts of rare earth metals such as\ngadolinium chloride (Rees et al.\n1997). Mineralization can sometimes be observed in combination with\ninflammation and neoplasia.\n\n\nFocal, multifocal or diffuse infiltration of cells in the lamina propria and/or\nsubmucosa.Presence of mononuclear or polymorphonuclear leucocytes but no other histological\ncriteria of inflammation.\n\n\n\nInflammation: Other histological features of inflammation such as edema,\nhemorrhage, necrosis and/or fibroplasia will be present.Granulocytic leukemia: Infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal\nneutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils; infiltration of\nsimilar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs.Lymphoma: Infiltration of monomorphic population of lymphocytes (often with\natypical, increased and/or abnormal mitoses); infiltration of similar neoplastic\ncells is likely present in other organs.\n\n\nComment: A minimal/mild infiltration of eosinophilic leucocytes is common in the\nsubmucosa of the corpus of rats and the infiltrate may also extend into the\nnon-glandular region near the limiting ridge (McInnes 2012). The stimulus for this infiltration is\nunknown.\n\n\nFocal, multifocal or diffuse infiltration of cells in lamina propria and/or\nsubmucosa.Presence of other histological criteria of inflammation e.g. hemorrhage, edema,\nfibroplasia.\n\n\n\nInfiltrate, inflammatory cell: Other morphologic features of inflammation such as\nedema, hemorrhage, necrosis and/or fibroplasia will be absent.Granulocytic leukemia: Infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal\nneutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils; infiltration of\nsimilar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs.Lymphoma: Infiltration of monomorphic population of lymphocytes (often with\natypical, increased and/or abnormal mitoses); infiltration of similar neoplastic\ncells is likely present in other organs.\n\n\nComment: Inflammation in the both glandular and nonglandular stomach is most often\nseen in combination with erosion or ulceration.\n\n\nSpiral shaped bacteria in the glands primarily usually near border of antrum and\ncorpus.Infection by H. felis and H. pylori in some strains of mice results in\ninflammatory, dysplastic and eventually neoplastic changes.Proliferation of gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), resembling human MALT\nlymphoma, may occur in certain strains of mice (e.g. BALB/c).\n\n\n\n Inflammation: Non-helicobacter opportunists may colonize the achlorhydric rodent\nstomach (e.g. gastrin-deficient mice) and invoke a similar chronic inflammatory\ndisease.\n\n\nComment: The progression from infection by H. pylori and H. felis to the formation\nof gastric adenocarcinoma in various mouse strains has been well described (Rogers and Fox, 2004; Rogers and Houghton 2009).\nHost immunity plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of gastric\nhelicobacter infection. Mouse strains such as C57BL/6 that mount a strong Th1\nresponses to helicobacter infection demonstrate lower colonization but increased\ninflammation and hyperplasia/dysplasia compared to strains such as BALB/C with Th2\npredominant responses (Rogers\nand Houghton 2009). Silver stains e.g. Wartin-Starry can be used to confirm\nthe presence of helicobacter in tissues section.\n\n\nPresence of a layer of round yeast-like structures along the glandular stomach\nepithelial surface lining and in the gastric contents.Maybe be large numbers of yeasts or few.Budding maybe seen.Associated inflammation is usually not observed but may be seen.Stains with Giemsa stain.\n\n\n\nBacteria: Do not show budding.Cryptosporidia: Are more within or intergrated with the surface epithelium.\n\n\nComments: This infection appears to be rare histologically but may be more commonly\nfound by culture (Mackinnon 1959,\nSavage and Dubos 1967). A\nvariety of similar organisms have been reported in many species (Kurtzman et al. 2005). These\norganisms usually are not pathogenic but may be under specific conditions such as\nimmunodeficiency.\n\nEdema and hemorrhage of the stomach are similar to those described for the upper\ndigestive tract. Other vascular lesions in the stomach and mesentery are dealt with in\nthe INHAND monograph on the cardiovascular system.\n\n\nProliferation and thickening of the stratum spinosum, often in association with a\nthickened keratin layer (parakeratotic or hyperkeratotic).Focal, multifocal or diffuse.Exophytic (papillary hyperplasia) or endophytic growth pattern.Papillary projections not or only minimally branched and without fibrovascular\nstroma.Broad-based hyperplastic foci might have multiple straight or minimally branched\nprojections.Polarity of differentiation to keratinocytes is orderly and complete.Rete peg formation may be exaggerated, i.e. papillary body may show undulation\ndue to enlarged germinal layers.Endophytic growth with cyst-like structures may occur; cysts lined by\nwell-differentiated squamous epithelium and filled with keratin; may extend into the\nsubmucosa, but basement membrane is intact.Mitotic activity may be increased.Dysplasia of spinous and basal cells may occur.Reactive as a descriptive term: Evidence for a primary irritating process, e.g.\nulcer, irritating chemical, foreign material.\n\n\n\nPapilloma, squamous cell: Papillary projection with a single and complex\nbranching fibrovascular connective tissue core.Hyperplasia, basal cell: Endophytic proliferation of basal cells; cytoplasm of\nproliferative cells is basophilic.Carcinoma, squamous cell: True invasion, i.e. lost basement membrane integrity;\nin the poorly differentiated type: Lost polarity of differentiation to\nkeratinocytes.\n\n\nComments: There may be a morphologic continuum from hyperplasia to papilloma and\nthe distinction between severe hyperplasia and papilloma may in these cases be\nsubjective.\n\nThe squamous epithelium at the border of nonglandular and glandular stomach\n(limiting ridge) is generally thickened relative to the adjacent squamous mucosa.\nThis area may be folded and, thus, cut tangentially or obliquely, if the stomach was\nnot properly stretched prior to fixation.\n\nHyperkeratosis or parakeratosis alone should be distinguished from squamous\nhyperplasia. Acanthosis is a synonym for hyperplasia of the squamous cell epithelium\nof the skin and should not be used in this organ. Diffuse squamous cell hyperplasia\nis relatively common in oral gavage studies when the test article has an irritating\npotential.\n\nThe modifier \u201creactive\u201d should be used if proliferation of stratified squamous\nepithelium is associated with or secondary to local erosion, ulcer or inflammation.\nThe absence of an ulcer or erosion in the plane of section does not preclude the\npresence of such in adjacent unexamined tissue.\n\nFlorid hyperplasia of the nonglandular stomach epithelium without evidence of\ncellular atypia can be completely reversible following the withdrawal of an inciting\nstimulus. Nonglandular stomach carcinogens may induce dysplasia of spinous and basal\ncells, especially if the hyperplasia is a precursor to a papilloma or squamous cell\ncarcinoma. Squamous cell hyperplasia and basal cell hyperplasia may occur\nconcurrently. This change has been observed in association with test article\nexposure (e.g. butylated hydroxyanisole) or chronic vitamin A deficiency (Klein-Szanto et al.\n1982).\n\n\nProliferation of the basal cell layer, basophilic staining increased.Focal or diffuse.Endophytic growth pattern.No alteration of basement membrane integrity.Papillary body shows marked undulation but rete peg structure still present.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia, squamous cell: Thickening of the epithelium with all normally\nexisting layers.Carcinoma, squamous cell: Evidence for lost basement membrane integrity, spinous\ncells and keratinized cells proliferate, cellular atypia.Tumor, basal cell, benign: Circumscribed proliferation of basal cells with loss\nof rete peg structure and leading to compression of surrounding tissue or prominent\nelevation of overlying epithelial layers.Tumor, basal cell, malignant: Basal cells predominate, keratinization is absent,\nevidence for lost basement membrane integrity.\n\n\nComment: Basal cell hyperplasia and squamous cell hyperplasia may occur\nconcurrently.\n\nIsolated nests of basal cells may occur in the lamina propria, dependent on the\nplane of section through the rete peg structures. However, their discrete border\nindicates an intact basement membrane.\n\nBasal cell hyperplasia and dysplasia are more frequently associated with chemicals\n(e.g., butylated hydroxyanisole) that result in neoplasms of the nonglandular\nmucosa.\n\nDysplasia of basal cells, characterized by keratinization within the basal layer,\nmay be observed.\n\nFoci of basal cell hyperplasia may be found in the mucosa of the glandular stomach\nin the vicinity to the limiting ridge (Figure 49b\nand c). Due to their similarity to basal cell hyperplasia of the\nnonglandular stomach and their specific location they are considered to originate\nfrom the nonglandular stomach. Such lesions should be recorded under \u201cnonglandular\nstomach, hyperplasia, basal cell\u201d.\n\n\nSolitary or multiple.Exophytic or endophytic (usually exophytic).Formation of a single complex branching fibrovascular core by exophytic tumors;\nthe stroma typically forms secondary branches or finger-like projections which blend\nwith the underlying lamina propria.Well-differentiated squamous cell layer (orderly maturation of the epithelium),\noften with prominent hyperkeratosis or parakeratosis.Penetration of muscularis mucosae is possible (papillomas extend into the\nsubmucosa), but no evidence for lost basement membrane integrity.Lack of cellular atypia.Mitotic figures are rare.Local inflammatory reactions are common (lymphocytic infiltrations in the stromal\nstalk).\n\n\n\nHyperplasia, squamous cell: Papillary projections are minimally branched at the\nmost and lack a fibrovascular stromal stalk.Carcinoma, squamous cell: Evidence for lost basement membrane integrity is\nobligatory; invading tumor cells generally with varying degrees of structural and\ncellular atypia.\n\n\nComment: There is a morphologic continuum from hyperplasia to papilloma and the\ndistinction between severe hyperplasia and papilloma is sometimes subjective.\n\nAlso comparative diagnosis and distinction of well differentiated squamous cell\ncarcinomas from papillomas may be difficult: The tumor tissue of papillomas may\nextend into the submucosa; a growth pattern suggestive of intact basement membranes\nand the lack of cellular and structural atypia distinguishes it from squamous cell\ncarcinomas.\n\nInvasive squamous cell carcinomas may have papillary lesions on their luminal\nsurface. In carcinomas arising within papillomas, invasion of the fibrovascular\nconnective tissue stalk is present.\n\nThe spontaneous papilloma in the nonglandular stomach is a rare event in rats, but\nmore common in mice and in some lines of genetically-engineered mice (Sundberg et al. 1992).\nPapillomas occur more often in gavage studies than with other routes of\nexposure.\n\n\nExophytic and/or endophytic growth pattern.Penetration of basal membrane by single cells or nests of neoplastic cells.Loss of cellular differentiation, anaplasia.Submucosa, muscle layer and serosa can be infiltrated.Well-differentiated type: nearly normal squamous epithelium with\nirregular structure of the papillary body, frequently showing foci with central\nhyperkeratinization (keratin pearls); in areas of invasion, predominance of\npolygonal and pleomorphic cells with varying degrees of keratinization. Poorly\ndifferentiated type (anaplastic): solid sheets or strands of spindle cells\nleading to varying degrees of desmoplastic appearance; keratinization may be\ndifficult to detect.Cells show varying size (frequently larger than normal) and shape; nuclei are\nhyperchromatic, enlarged and have prominent nucleoli.Mitotic figures may be numerous.Superficial ulceration and inflammation or fibroplasia of the lamina propria or\nsubmucosa are common features.May metastasize to the abdominal cavity, regional lymph nodes, or the lung.\n\n\n\nPapilloma, squamous cell: No evidence of lost basement membrane integrity or\ninvasion and no cellular atypia.Tumor, basal cell, benign OR tumor, basal cell, malignant: Exclusively endophytic\ngrowth pattern and a typical arrangement of the small basophilic basal cells in\ngarlands or rows; poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas can have a\nprominent basal cell component but this is often associated with extensive invasion\nand a scirrhous response.Hyperplasia, squamous cell: No evidence of lost basement membrane integrity or of\ninvasive growth although muscularis mucosae may be displaced; no evidence of\ncellular atypia.Hyperplasia, basal cell: Can form round or oval clusters which extend into the\nunderlying lamina propria; these clusters usually have discrete borders (suggestive\nof maintained basement membrane integrity) and no cellular atypia.\n\n\nComment: Depending on the plane of section, it can be difficult to distinguish a\nwell-differentiated carcinomas from a papilloma. Papillomas may also extend into the\nsubmucosa and thereby displace the muscularis mucosa. The presence of carcinomatous\nfoci in an otherwise benign appearing papilloma is indicative of malignancy (Fukushima and Ito, 1985; Tsukamoto et al. 2007). In\ngeneral, the lack of cellular atypia allows a distinction to be made. Many squamous\ncell carcinomas in the nonglandular stomach are exophytic which can result in\npartial or total occlusion of the lumen. The exophytic portion can be papillary\nresembling papilloma.\n\nChemically-induced (e.g. butylated hydroxyanisole, 1,2-dibromo-ethane) squamous\ncell carcinomas may contain mostly basal or spindle cells with little squamous\ndifferentiation. These tumors are considered a morphological variant of the more\ntypical squamous cell carcinoma. Ultrastructurally, squamous cell carcinomas contain\ntypical desmosomes and bundles of electron-dense tonofilaments. Some chemicals\nespecially when given by gavage cause highly malignant squamous cells carcinomas in\nrats which metastasize to the peritoneal cavity and lungs (Olson et al. 1973).\n\n\nEndophytic growth pattern.Closely packed small or oval cells from the stratum germinativum forming garlands\nor nests with peripherally palisade-like cells.Loss of rete peg structure.Growth pattern suggests that basement membrane is intact.Compression of surrounding tissue or elevation of overlying epithelium which\nitself does not show neoplastic alteration.No keratinization.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia, basal cell: Proliferation of basal cells with preservation of rete\npeg structure; no or only slight compression of surrounding tissue or elevation of\noverlying epithelial layers.Carcinoma, basal cell: Growth pattern suggests that basement membrane integrity\nis lost.Carcinoma, squamous cell: Growth pattern suggests that basement membrane\nintegrity is lost, spinous cells and keratinized cells proliferate.\n\n\nComment: The absence of differentiation and therefore the predominant proliferation\nof the basal cell is a criterion for the basal cell tumor diagnosis. This tumor type\nis very rare, and no images were available at point of publication.\n\n\nEndophytic growth pattern.Superficial layers almost normal, but sometimes ulcerated, while neoplastic basal\ncells infiltrate into the lamina propria of the mucosa and submucosa.Round to oval closely packed nonspinous cells with dark nuclei and little\ncytoplasm, often forming palisade-like garlands or chains.Keratinization generally absent.Growth pattern suggests that basement membrane integrity is lost.Frequent mitotic figures.\n\n\n\nCarcinoma, squamous cell: Well differentiated squamous cell carcinomas with\nprominent keratinization; poorly differentiated variants can have a prominent basal\ncell component but this is generally associated with extensive invasion and a\nscirrhous response.Hyperplasia, basal cell: Proliferation of basal cells with preservation of rete\npeg structure; no or only slight compression of surrounding tissue or elevation of\noverlying epithelial layers; growth pattern indicates that basement membrane\nintegrity is maintained.Tumor, basal cell, benign: Growth pattern indicates that basement membrane\nintegrity is maintained.\n\n\nComment: The absence of differentiation and therefore the predominant proliferation\nof the basal cell is a criterion for the basal cell tumor diagnosis. This tumor type\nis very rare, and no images were available at point of publication.\n\n\nExtension of glands through muscularis mucosae, into submucosa and further in\nsome cases.Morphology of epithelial lining is variable, ranging from single layer cuboidal\nor columnar cells to complete mucosa.Epithelium may show features of regeneration like increased basophilia, increased\nnucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio and gradual loss of polarity, but atypia is minimal at\nthe most.Basement membrane integrity is always maintained.More often seen in the antrum of mice.Often accompanied by inflammation and regenerative / reparative processes.May contain ingesta, hair, or other foreign material.\n\n\nCystic:\n\n\nRounded cystic structures in lamina propria or deeper layers.Compression of surrounding tissue, some degree of compression atrophy of the\nepithelium lining the cyst.May contain mucus.\n\n\nAtypical:\n\n\nExtension of atypical/dysplastic mucosal glands into or through muscularis\nmucosa, submucosa, and deeper in some cases.Hyperplastic atypical (dysplastic) epithelial cells forming cystic glands that\nmay appear to be \u201cinvading\u201d into deeper layers of the stomach.Atypical change often focal in an otherwise normal appearing epithelium.\n\n\n\nAdenoma: Polypoid or papillary growth into gastric lumen obligatory, but\npseudo-invasion into stalk may be seen.Adenocarcinoma: Multiple layers of lining epithelium with varying degrees of\ndysplasia. True infiltrative growth with loss of basement membrane integrity and\noften with a scirrhous stromal reaction.\n\n\nComment: Glandular diverticula of the stomach, frequently observed in mice\n(especially in genetically-engineered mice and in mice with chronic experimental\ngastric infections), may be associated with local mucosal defects (e.g.\npost-ulcerative repair), suggesting opportunistic expansion, but these have also\nbeen observed within submucosal veins in the absence of mucosal defects, suggesting\nthere may be a vascular route of penetration from the mucosa.\n\nThese structures are typically lined by a simple cuboidal mucus epithelium, which\nmay have an antral or intestinal mucus phenotype that can be characterized by\nhistochemical stains (e.g. Alcian blue). These focal gastric lesions do not resemble\ndiverticulosis in human colon which may be focal, multifocal or diffuse. They do not\nappear to be neoplastic, although they do create an increased risk of rupture and\nseptic peritonitis.\n\nIt is not recommended to record \u201cdiverticulum\u201d (plus modifier) as a separate\nfinding, if it occurs in association with another proliferative process (e.g.\nhyperplasia, adenoma).\n\nSmall glandular diverticula lined by a single layer of cuboidal or columnar\nepithelium resemble \u201ccrypt herniation\u201d of human gastrointestinal pathology (e.g.\nRex et al. 2012). Such\nherniation of crypts through the muscularis mucosae is interpreted as\n\u201cpseudoinvasive\u201d or \u201cinverted\u201d growth pattern. Although the process-related term\n\u201ccrypt herniation\u201d is common in literature (e.g. Betton et al. 2001), the term \u201cdiverticulum\u201d is\nconsidered to better fit to the INHAND principle to use descriptive terms and to\navoid process-related ones (Mann et al.\n2012). Also the misnomer \u201cadenomatous diverticulum\u201d has been used to\ndescribe these structures and the prefix \u201cadenomatous\u201d should be avoided.\n\nAtypical diverticula must be distinguished from genuine neoplastic invasion (e.g.\nloss of basement membrane and other signs of malignancy in the latter). They are\nassociated with preexisting mucosal atypical hyperplasia/dysplasia as seen under\nspecific experimental conditions, tumor-associated gastric toxins,\ngenetically-engineered mice and chronic Helicobacter pylori infection (Andersson et al. 2005; Boivin et al. 1996; Boivin et al. 2003; Fernandez-Salguero et al.\n1997; Miyoshi et al.\n2002; Rogers and\nHoughton 2009). Whereas they often do not progress to unequivocal\nadenocarcinoma, atypical glandular and cellular features are consistent with\nneoplastic potential.\n\nAtypical diverticula may be associated with atypical hyperplasia and adenoma, but\nusually not with adenocarcinoma. As noted above for the simple diverticula, they\nshould not be recorded as a separate diagnostic entity when associated with another\nproliferative process.\n\n\nFocal or multifocal due to underlying injury (e.g. ulcer); mucosal defects/injury\nand inflammation may be observed in tandem with proliferative changes.Confined to the gastric mucosa.No significant compression of adjacent tissue.Proliferation may be manifested as an increase in mucosal thickness or\npenetration of glands through the muscularis mucosae to the submucosa, tunica\nmuscularis, or serosa forming cystic or glandular diverticula. These structures are\ntypically lined by a simple cuboidal mucus epithelium.With the exception of diverticula, no distortion of regular mucosal structure by\nthe proliferative process itself.May be associated with a reduction of parietal cells.Eosinophilic globules may be present in the epithelial cell cytoplasm.Mitoses may be increased.\n\n\nAtypical:\n\n\nAbnormal structure of gastric glands.Focal penetration by glandular diverticula into lamina propria or deeper layers\nbut basement membrane is always intact.Hyperchromatic foci with cellular atypia and pleomorphism.Loss of epithelial polarity.\n\n\n\nAdenoma: Typically arise as singular foci in the distal antral/pyloric region,\noften with polypoid architecture. Nodular (polypoid, papillary) lesions growing into\nthe lumen of the stomach; distortion of glandular architecture and in case of\nnon-papillary adenomas also compression of surrounding tissue.Adenocarcinoma: Invasion of nests and cords of neoplastic cells into lamina\npropria or deeper layers, indicating loss of basement membrane integrity; cellular\natypia.\n\n\nComment: Focal hyperplasia may be accompanied by metaplasia of the mucus\nepithelium, characterized by a shift from a neutral mucin phenotype of the surface\nepithelium to an acidic antral or intestinal mucin phenotype. This may be associated\nwith a reduction in parietal cells (atrophy) and a presumptive shift in local pH.\nDistinct patterns of hyperplastic changes may arise in the glandular stomach because\nof the cellular complexity, regional differences in architecture, and selectivity of\nstimuli.\n\nFocal atypical hyperplasia represents an altered proliferation of mucosal\nepithelium. It may be associated with chronic inflammation. An example is the\nHelicobacter pylori mouse model. The lesion may progress into an adenoma or\nadenocarcinoma. Although frequently considered as preneoplastic by nature, this\nneeds to be proven in a given case in order to be classified as such. Focal\nintra-epithelial atypical proliferations resembling morphologically an invasive\nadenocarcinoma have been found in specific genetically modified mouse lines and\nafter chemical induction. They have been termed Gastric Intraepithelial Neoplasia\n(GIN). Other terms occasionally used but not preferred as synonyms are microadenoma,\ncarcinoma in situ, and intra-epithelial carcinoma.\n\n\nMay be diffuse within a specific regional zone (corpus, antrum, pylorus).Mitotic activity may be increased.Within a region of mucosa, thickening of the mucosa may affect the full thickness\nor may be compartmentalized within discrete glandular zones or cell types.With increasing severity, basophilia, decreased epithelial differentiation, and\nstructural disorganization may be observed.Metaplasia of the mucus epithelium may arise, characterized by a shift from a\nneutral mucin phenotype to an intestinal mucin phenotype. This may be associated\nwith a reduction in parietal cells and a presumptive shift in local pH.A cause may be evident (irritating substance, gavage material).\n\n\n\nAdenoma: Nodular lesions growing exophytic (polypoid, papillary).\n\n\nComment: Diffuse hyperplasia may be induced by chemicals (e.g. Misprostal) or by\nlarval (Taenia taeniaeformis) infestation in the liver. The latter results in\nhypergastrinemia and diffuse glandular mucosal hyperplasia.\n\nThe incidence of mitotic figures at the base of the gastric pit and the ratio of\nthe lengths of the foveolus (gastric pit) to the deeper oxyntic region can be\nindices of proliferative activity; however, the latter will normally increase moving\ndistally from the squamocolumnar junction.\n\nDiffuse fundic hyperplasia is a common finding in aged mice, where it is often\naccompanied by degenerative changes like glandular cysts or diverticula.\n\n\nFocal: aggregates of neuroendocrine cells no greater than 3 glands in\ndiameter.Diffuse: increased number of individual or small clusters of neuroendocrine cells\nscattered in the mucosa.Cytoplasm is pale and abundant, nuclei are small and monomorphic.Neuroendocrine cells are argyrophilic (e.g. Grimelius, Servier-Munger stains) and\nimmunohistochemically positive for neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin A,\nhistidine decarboxylase, and histamine. Secretory granules can be observed by\nelectron microscopy.\n\n\n\nTumor, neuroendocrine cell, benign/malignant: Discrete neoplastic foci are\ngreater than 3 gastric glands in diameter. Larger neoplasms may form sheets or\ndemonstrate atypical architecture (e.g. acini). Greater cellular pleomorphism,\neosinophilic cytoplasm, increased nuclear size and mitotic figures. Diminished\ndifferentiation may influence the degree of immunohistochemical staining.\n\n\nComment: Proton pump-inhibitors may induce neuroendocrine hyperplasia. Small\nnumbers of normal neuroendocrine cells can occasionally be observed in the submucosa\nand should not be categorized as neoplasia.\n\n\nTypically arise in the antral or pyloric mucosa.Mucosal architecture distorted.Growth pattern often polypoid, sessile, or papillary with or without a\nfibrovascular stalk; in polypoid adenomas of the antral mucosa, gland architecture\nmay be retained.Focal penetration by glandular diverticula into lamina propria or deeper layers\nmay be present but basement membrane is always intact.Cells are a basophilic, less differentiated glandular epithelium, but with little\natypia; polarity is maintained.Epithelial nuclei are unilayered or organized with varying degree of\nstratification.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia, focal (mucosal): Linear mucosal orientation without polypoid or\npapillary architecture.Adenocarcinoma: Infiltration as evidenced by penetration into lamina propria or\ndeeper layers with a growth pattern indicative of lost basement membrane integrity;\nscirrhous stromal reaction.Tumor, neuroendocrine cell, benign: Discrete intramucosal foci, which typically\narise in hyperplastic areas in the oxyntic mucosa (i.e. corpus region). Closely\norganized clusters of neuroendocrine cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, separated by\nthin fibrovascular stroma. Argyrophilic and characteristic immunohistochemical\nphenotype.\n\n\nComment: Well-differentiated, hyperplastic glands may be entrapped in the adjoining\nlamina propria or submucosa, Such structures originate from herniation of glands,\nare well demarcated, lack a scirrhotic stromal response and should not be\ninterpreted as neoplastic infiltration.\n\nAdenomas, as well as atypical hyperplasia, may exhibit some degree of dysplasia and\ndistortion of pre-existing architecture. Macroscopic visibility has been suggested\nas a differential diagnostic criterion by some authors. This criterion is not used\nin the context of this description of histologic criteria. Any lesion exhibiting a\npapillary or polypoid growth pattern is an adenoma, irrespective whether it was\ngrossly visible or not. An intra-epithelial small focus with cytological\ncharacteristics seen in adenomas should NOT be diagnosed as an adenoma but as\natypical hyperplasia. An adenoma must possess a polypoid, sessile or papillary\ngrowth pattern, whether grossly visible or not.\n\nGastric adenomas are an uncommon observation in untreated rodents, but may be\nfrequent in some genetically modified mouse strains (Takaku et al. 1999; Miyoshi et al. 2002). They are associated with\nspecific mutations, which may be similar to those of humans with gastric polyps.\n\n\nPredominantly found in the antrum.Regular mucosal structure is lost.Growth exophytic or endophytic.Major morphologic types include tubular, papillary, cystic, solid, scirrhous,\nmucinous, and signet ring.Invasion of nests and cords of neoplastic cells into lamina propria or deeper\nlayers, loss of basement membrane integrity.Varying degrees of cytologic and nuclear atypia, anaplasia, hyperchromatism,\nbasophilic or clear cytoplasm, and increased mitotic figures.Mucin secretion may be present even if poorly differentiated and, if strong, may\nresult in signet ring morphology; such tumors usually grow locally highly\ninfiltrative but tumor cells may be deceivingly inconspicuous, in which case\ncytokeratin stains are most helpful for both diagnosis and assessment of tumor\nextent.Invasive growth may elicit fibrous/scirrhous reaction and inflammation, i.e.\nareas of infiltration are surrounded by loose stroma.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia focal (mucosal): Proliferation with maintained mucosal structure,\nexcept of glandular diverticula; no atypia in simple hyperplasia; in case of\nglandular diverticula, localized and discrete penetration into lamina propria or\ndeeper layers with maintained basement membrane integrity and surrounded by\npre-existing mature tissues lacking a scirrhotic stromal response.Hyperplasia focal (mucosal) atypical: Limited to the mucosal lining, no\ninfiltrative growth; focal penetration by glandular diverticula into lamina propria\nor deeper layers may be present but basement membrane always intact.Diverticulum: Localized and discrete penetration into lamina propria or deeper\nlayers with maintained basement membrane integrity and surrounded by pre-existing\nmature tissues lacking a scirrhotic stromal response.Adenoma: No infiltrative growth; focal penetration by glandular diverticula into\nlamina propria or deeper layers may be present but basement membrane always\nintact.Tumor, neuroendocrine cell, malignant: Typically arise in hyperplastic areas in\nthe oxyntic mucosa (i.e., corpus region); closely organized clusters of\nneuroendocrine cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, separated by thin fibrovascular\nstroma; argyrophilic and characteristic immunohistochemical phenotype.\n\n\nComment: Gastric adenocarcinomas are uncommon spontaneous tumors in rodents, except\nof some genetically modified mouse strains. Chemically-induced tumors in routine\nmouse/rat strains are not common except for induction by specific chemicals, e.g.\nN-methyl-N\u2019-nitrosoguanidine, NMU, MNNG in rats, while mice are more resistant\n(Tsukamoto et al. 2007).\nThe morphologic type may depend on the etiology / carcinogen.\n\n\nDiscrete, well-demarcated aggregates of neuroendocrine cells, which may arise\nfrom hyperplastic areas in the oxyntic mucosa (i.e. corpus region).Size of the aggregates exceeds 3 gastric glands in diameter.Restricted to intramucosal involvement.Compression or necrosis of adjoining mucosa glands may be observed.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia, neuroendocrine cell: Scattered distribution of individual or small\nclusters of well-differentiated cells; discrete foci no more than 3 gastric glands\nin diameter.Tumor, neuroendocrine cell, malignant: Infiltration through muscularis mucosae by\nneoplastic, often less differentiated cells arranged in cords or nodules OR serosal\ndeposits OR distant metastases.Ectopic hepatocytes: Absence of neoplastic behavior or cytologic alteration.\nAbsence of characteristic markers for neuroendocrine cells (e.g. argyrophilia,\nimmunohistochemical profile).\n\n\nComment: Neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and neoplasia may be seen in response to\nhypergastrinemia following anti-secretory drug treatment (Spencer et al. 1989). Fundic mucosal hyperplasia\nis usually also evident. Small numbers of normal neuroendocrine cells can be\nobserved in the submucosa and should not be categorized as neoplasia.\n\n\nAggregates of neuroendocrine cells, which may arise from hyperplastic areas in\nthe oxyntic mucosa (i.e., corpus region).Growth is intramucosal as nodules of pale staining or eosinophilic cells,\nsometimes with larger submucosal nodules.Infiltration through muscularis mucosae by neoplastic, often less-differentiated,\ncells arranged in cords or nodules.Metastasis to regional lymph nodes or liver may be present.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia, neuroendocrine cell: Scattered distribution of individual or small\nclusters of well-differentiated cells. Discrete foci are less than 3 gastric glands\nin diameter.Ectopic hepatocytes: Absence of neoplastic behavior or cytologic alteration.\nAbsence of characteristic markers for neuroendocrine cells (e.g. argyrophilia,\nimmunohistochemical profile).\n\n\nComment: Neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and neoplasia may be seen in response to\nhypergastrinemia following anti-secretory drug treatment (Spencer et al. 1989). Fundic mucosal hyperplasia\nis usually also evident. Small numbers of normal neuroendocrine cells can be\nobserved in the submucosa and should not be categorized as neoplasia.\n\n\nIntramural involvement.Interlacing bundles and whorls of uniform spindle cells arranged in criss-cross\npatterns of bundles.Nuclei typically blunt-ended or cigar shaped.Eosinophilic cytoplasm contains longitudinal myofilaments and perinuclear clear\nspace and show immunoreactivity for desmin.\n\n\n\nLeiomyosarcoma: Shows mitotic activity and cellular pleomorphism. Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST): Differentiation from other soft tissue\ntumors need only be made in cases of intergroup difference in the incidence of soft\ntissue tumors in a given study; unequivocal differentiation from other soft tissue\ntumors possible only by immunohistochemistry: typically CD117 positive (cytokine\nreceptor encoded by c-kit). Spindle, epithelioid, or pleomorphic cell morphology.\nIndistinct cell borders and fibrillary cytoplasm; cells may be arranged in bundles\nwith storiform architecture; spindle- or irregular-shaped nuclei.Schwannoma: CD117 negative, S-100 positive; indistinct cell borders, elongate\ncells with eosinophilic cytoplasm; nuclei sometime arranged in palisades (i.e.,\nAntoni A pattern).Fibroma/sarcoma: CD 117 and S-100 negative; interlacing bundles of spindle cells;\nMasson\u2019s trichrome-blue collagen.Histiocytic sarcoma: Positive for histiocytic markers (ED-1 for rats, Factor 4/80\nin mice), CD 117 and S-100 negative; infiltrative pattern, pleomorphic\nmorphology.\n\n\nComment: Similar to those observed in other sites (see also INHAND-publication of\nsoft tissue tumors, Greaves et al.\n2013).\n\n\nIntramural involvement.Similar to leiomyoma, but more pleomorphic and with mitotic activity.Necrosis, cystic change and mineralization are common features.Distant metastases.\n\n\n\nLeiomyoma: Shows little or no cellular pleomorphism or mitotic activity.Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST): Differentiation from other soft tissue\ntumors need only be made in cases of intergroup difference in the incidence of soft\ntissue tumors in a given study; unequivocal differentiation from other soft tissue\ntumors is possible only by immunohistochemistry: typically CD117 positive (cytokine\nreceptor encoded by c-kit).

Indistinct cell borders and\nfibrillary cytoplasm.Spindle- or irregular-shaped nuclei.Typically CD117 positive (cytokine receptor encoded by c-kit).\n\n\n\nGastrointestinal stromal tumor, malignant: Infiltrative growth; distant\nmetastases may be present.Leiomyoma: CD117 negative, desmin positive; interlacing bundles and whorls of\nuniform spindle cells arranged in criss-cross pattern; blunt-ended, fusiform nuclei,\nminimal nuclear pleomorphism; phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin positive\nmyofibrils.Leiomyoscarcoma: CD117 negative, desmin positive; interlacing bundles and whorls\nof uniform spindle cells arranged in criss-cross pattern; blunt-ended, fusiform\nnuclei with hyperchromasia, pleomorphism, and high mitotic index; phosphotungstic\nacid-hematoxylin positive myofibrils.Schwannoma: CD117 negative, S-100 positive; indistinct cell borders, elongate\ncells with eosinophilic cytoplasm; nuclei sometime arranged in palisades (i.e.,\nAntoni A pattern).\n\n\nComment: GIST will generally not be easily differentiated from leiomyomas /\nleiomyosarcomas or other soft tissue tumors. However, immunohistochemical\ndifferentiation of the different tumor types, including GIST, needs to be performed\nin case of imbalances in the incidence of smooth muscle tumors in a given study.\n\nExperimentally-induced GIST in the glandular stomach of rats and a spontaneous GIST\nin rat nonglandular stomach have been reported (Fujimoto et al. 2006; Mukaisho et al. 2006). Cecal GIST have been\nidentified in GEM mice over-expressing a mutant KIT (Nakai et al. 2008). The question arises whether\nsome conventionally diagnosed rodent stromal tumors (e.g., leiomyoma) were actually\nGIST.\n\n\nLocally infiltrative growth pattern.Cells may be arranged in bundles with storiform architecture, myxoid areas may be\npresent.Spindle, epithelioid, or pleomorphic cell morphology.

However, immunohistochemical\ndifferentiation of the different tumor types, including GIST, needs to be performed\nin case of imbalances in the incidence of smooth muscle tumors in a given study.\n\nExperimentally-induced GIST in the glandular stomach of rats and a spontaneous GIST\nin rat nonglandular stomach have been reported (Fujimoto et al. 2006; Mukaisho et al. 2006). Cecal GIST have been\nidentified in GEM mice over-expressing a mutant KIT (Nakai et al. 2008). The question arises whether\nsome conventionally diagnosed rodent stromal tumors (e.g. leiomyoma) were actually\nGIST.\n\nThe small intestine in rodents, as in other mammals, is subdivided into duodenum, jejunum\nand ileum and is designed for the digestion and absorption of ingested products (Treuting and Dintzis, 2012). The\nlarge intestine is composed of cecum, colon and rectum. The cecum is a large blind end sac\nwith considerable fermentation potential. The colon has an ascending section, a short\ntransverse section and a descending section leading to the rectum which terminates at the\nanus. All parts, except the terminal rectum, are connected to the body wall by the\nmesentery which functions as a conduit for vascular, lymphatic and nervous supply. The\nterminal rectum lies outside the pelvic cavity and consequently lacks a surrounding\nserosal membrane.\n\nVery rarely, congenital developmental abnormalities can occur, e.g. intestinal\nduplication (Elangbam et al.\n1998). Such pathologic conditions that can be reliably diagnosed grossly are not\ncovered by this monograph.\n\nHistologically, the mucosa of the small intestine is composed of basal crypts (also known\nas crypts of Lieberkuhn) and villi which extend into the lumen. The base of the crypt is\nlined by stem cells; the remainder of the crypt is composed of proliferating epithelial\ncells which either migrate up the villi as they differentiate into absorptive cells with\nmicrovilli or goblet cells, with a turnover time of about 3 days, or remain in the crypt\nand differentiate into Paneth cells. The villous epithelium is composed of tall columnar\ncells with surface microvilli (the main absorptive cells), goblet cells containing mucus\nand scattered neuroendocrine cells covering a lamina propria composed of connective tissue\nwith a rich vascular and lymphatic network. The lamina propria contains variable numbers\nof lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, eosinophils and/or mast cells whilst occasional\nintraepithelial lymphocytes can also be observed. Paneth cells, which have an exocrine\nserous morphology and produce antimicrobial peptides, are present in higher numbers in the\ncrypts of jejunum and ileum compared to the duodenum. Brunner\u2019s glands, which produce a\nbicarbonate rich secretion, are present in the submucosa immediately following the\npyloric-duodenal junction. Villi in the duodenum are taller than those in jejunum and\nileum. Jejunum and ileum can be hard to differentiate in cross section except that the\nterminal ileum has two serosal attachments (mesentery and ligamentum ileocecale) compared\nto the single mesenteric attachment of the jejunum. With age, the duodenal villi tend to\nbecome shorter and thicker due to increased amounts of fibrous connective tissue in the\ncore, whilst those in the ileum become longer probably related to reduced absorption in\nthe proximal intestine resulting in greater amounts of nutrients passing into the distal\nintestine (Shackelford and Elwell\n1999).\n\nIn the jejunum and ileum there are well defined aggregations of lymphoid tissue (Peyer\u2019s\npatches) located opposite the mesenteric attachment; these may show formation of germinal\ncenters. Similar aggregations are present in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract and\nare collectively referred to as gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n\nVilli are absent from the large intestine and instead the mucosa is thrown into\ntransverse or longitudinal folds. In mice and rats the folds of the proximal colon have a\ndistinctive spiral orientation. The mucosa is lined by a single layer of three cell types:\nabsorptive cells, goblet (mucous) cells and neuroendocrine cells. There is a zone of\nproliferation in each gland and cells either migrate outwards and differentiate into\nabsorptive or goblet cells or remain in the basal part of the gland as secretory cells.\nThe turnover time of the absorptive and outer goblet cells is 4.6 days, that of the deep\ncrypt secretory cells 14 to 21 days (Karam\n1999). Aggregates of lymphoid cells may be found in the mucosa and submucosa of\nall parts of the large intestine, but these are not limited to the antimesenteric aspect\nas in the small intestine.\n\nThe mucosa in both small and large intestines is supported by the connective tissue of\nthe lamina propria and the continuous muscle layer of the muscularis mucosa. Beneath the\nmuscularis mucosa is the relatively loose connective tissue of the submucosa which\ncontains larger blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves and the tunica muscularis (also known\nas muscularis propria or muscularis externa). The external surface, except for the\nterminal rectum, is covered by the serosal membrane. The rectum also is enclosed by a\nnotably thicker tunica muscularis. The enteric nervous system in the intestine is in the\nform of the submucosal and myenteric plexi, the latter being located between the\nlongitudinal and circular layers of the tunica muscularis.\n\nThe primary function of the small intestine is to complete the chemical digestion of food\nby pancreatic enzymes and bile salts and allow for efficient absorption of the products of\ndigestion. The primary functions of the large intestine are to allow for further digestion\nby fermentation in the cecum, absorption of water, and temporary storage of waste material\nin the rectum before defecation. Disease processes or test articles that interfere with\nthese processes will often produce diarrhea. Less commonly muscle function is compromised\nleading to impaction of rectum and colon and clinical constipation. The mucosa of the\nsmall intestine is a site of high enzyme activity and conjugation reactions and\nconsequently orally administered test articles may be metabolized, activated or\ndeactivated in the intestine. The GALT plays a primary role in the defense of the body\nagainst invasion by micro-organisms in the food and those normally resident in the\nlumen.\n\nThe small intestine is the primary site for absorption of test articles given orally so\nit must be carefully evaluated in safety evaluation studies. Due to variations in\nmorphology along the length of both small and large intestine it is important there is\nconsistent sampling at necropsy and consistent orientation on the slide. The GoRENI\ntrimming guide (website.reni.item.fraunhofer.de/reni/trimming) specifies the following\nsites for routine examination: 1) Duodenum: 1 cm distal to the pyloric sphincter; 2)\nJejunum: central section; 3) Ileum: 1 cm proximal to cecum; 4) Cecum; 5) Colon: central\nsection; and 6) Rectum: 2 cm proximal to the anus. For investigative studies involving\ninduction of intestinal tumors, the entire intestine can be opened, lesion location and\nsize recorded and individual tumors may be fixed for sectioning in additional to the 6\nstandard sections. Alternatively the whole length of the intestine can be fixed using the\nSwiss roll method. However, opening the intestine and washing away contents with normal\nsaline brings the risk of damaging the delicate mucosa which degenerates quickly due to\npost mortem autolysis; tissue orientation may be less reliable during subsequent tissue\ntrimming and blocking using this method. In addition, it is important to note the amount\nand quality of ingesta/digesta present in the segments of intestine sampled for\nhistological examination as this may affect the height of the mucosa.\n\nAttempts should be made at necropsy to sample Peyer\u2019s patches (which are visible\nmacroscopically) from the jejunum or ileum so that microscopic evaluation of GALT can be\nundertaken on the routine section of small intestines. Toxicological evaluation of the\nintestine should also include examination of the tunica muscularis and the submucosal and\nmyenteric nerve plexi which occasionally show changes related to test article\nadministration.\n\n\nNormally formed pancreatic acini in mucosa or submucosa. Islets of Langerhans may\nalso be present.Present near the site of mesenteric attachment.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: Presence of ductular (biliary or pancreatic) tissue in the duodenal wall\nis a normal finding in the anterior duodenum (Shackelford and Elwell 1999).\n\n\nCyst lined by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.Lumen frequently contains keratinized material.\n\n\n\nDiverticulum, simple, cystic OR diverticulum, atypical, cystic: Lined by\nglandular epithelium; no keratin formation.\n\n\nComment: While squamous cysts are most likely to be of congenital origin they may\npotentially form secondary to derangement of the epithelium e.g. in an inflammatory\nprocess. Squamous cysts been observed very occasionally in the muscularis of the\ncolon and rectum of B6C3F1 mice (Shackelford and Elwell 1999). They are\nthought to be associated with focal weakness or discontinuity of the muscularis\nresulting in herniation through the submucosa and mucosa to the serosa. If\npost-inflammatory extension is the suspected pathogenesis, the pathologist may\nchoose to interpret the focal change as a diverticulum, rather than a congential\ncyst.\n\n\nReduction in size and number of the acini that comprise the Brunner\u2019s glands.May be accompanied by an inflammatory reaction.May be accompanied by fibrosis.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\n\nVilli show reduced height but increased width.Reduced depth of crypts in small intestine and mucous glands in large\nintestine.Reduced mitotic rate and/or increased cell loss through apoptosis or\nnecrosis.Epithelium loses normal regular arrangement and may be flattened, cuboidal or\nvacuolated in appearance.\n\n\n\nDilatation: Dilatation of the intestine by fluid or gas will reduce villous\nheight and thickness of the large intestinal mucosa by mechanical means.Autolysis: Preferential destruction and loss of cells at the tips of villi; no\ninflammatory reaction.Normal topography: Villi overlying Brunner\u2019s glands may be smaller/fewer than in\nneighboring areas of the duodenum.\n\n\nComment: Villous atrophy can be induced by withdrawal of food, administration of\nantimitotic cytotoxic agents, secondary to chronic inflammation or following\nrotavirus infection (Maekawa 1994;\nShackelford and Elwell\n1999; Percy and\nBarthold 2007; Kramer et al.\n2010; Haschek et al.\n2010). In addition, villous atrophy can be induced experimentally by\nhypophysectomy, thyroidectomy and in segments of surgically bypassed intestine\n(Greaves 2012). Villous atrophy\nmay be accompanied by other degenerative changes e.g. lipidosis (Murgatroyd 1980). Villous and mucosal\natrophy without damage to the underlying lamina propria or to the proliferative cell\npopulation is reversible. However, if there is a sustained effect on proliferation\ne.g. with cytotoxic agents, the atrophy will be followed by erosion/ulceration,\nhemorrhage and secondary infection. Mucosal atrophy induced by agents that interfere\nwith the spindle apparatus may also show nuclear abnormalities including\nkaryomegaly.\n\n\nIncreased length of villi in the small intestine.Increased mucosal thickness in the large intestine.Increased mitotic activity may be observed.\n\n\n\nArtifacts: Villi are longer in the duodenum compared to jejunum and ileum, so\ninconsistency of sampling at necropsy could lead to an erroneous diagnosis.\n\n\nComment: Increased mucosal thickness or villous length reflects hyperplasia of all\ncellular elements. Villous hypertrophy has been induced by test articles (e.g.\nalloxan, polychlorinated aromatics, thyroid mimetic test articles), and by hormonal\nchanges e.g. lactation and hyperthyroid states (Bertram et al. 1996; Greaves 2012). Villous length can also be influenced by\nnutritional factors e.g. amount of dietary fiber (Burkhardt et al. 1998).\n\n\nReduced numbers of granules in Paneth cells and/or loss of Paneth cells.\n\n\n\nNone; however, it is necessary to verify the location of the intestinal specimen\nbecause Paneth cell density varies based on topography with considerably fewer cells\npresent in the duodenum.\n\n\nComment: Recent literature identifies Paneth cells as particularly sensitive\ntargets of endoplasmic reticulum stress responses and disruption of their function\nis a risk factor in inflammatory bowel disease (Ouellette 2010). Reduction in Paneth cells is observed\nin norovirus infection in certain transgenic mice strains (Cadwell et al. 2010).\n\n\nHypertrophic Paneth cells.May accompany villous atrophy.Paneth cell hyperplasia may also be present.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the Paneth cells, accompanying villous\natrophy, were induced experimentally by surgical isolation of ileal loops (Keren et al. 1975).\n\n\nPresence of Paneth cells in the large intestinal mucosa.Accompanies chronic inflammatory lesions.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: In colitis induced by the administration of dextran sodium sulphate and\n1,2-dimethylhyadrazine, Paneth cell metaplasia occurred 4 weeks after induction of\ninflammatory lesions (Imai et al.\n2007) Paneth cells showed increased expression of \u00df-catenin (Imai et al. 2007). Paneth cell\ndifferentiation is also seen in tumors that develop in this model.\n\n\nVacuoles in epithelial cells of the villi, particularly duodenum and jejunum.Vacuoles are usually observed in the apical part of the epithelial cells in the\nupper third of the villi.Vacuoles may also be observed in macrophages in the lamina propria and the\nmesenteric lymph nodes. Subsequent to rupture of macrophages, lipid droplets may be\nfound free in the lamina propria. Occasional foreign body giant cells may be present\nin the lamina propria.\n\n\nFoamy\n\n\nHypertrophy of cells with foamy cytoplasm\n\n\n\nHypertrophy or hyperplasia, mucous cell: Presence of mucins can be confirmed by\nadditional stains (PAS and alcian blue).Necrosis: Cells swollen with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm; loss of nuclear\nbasophilia, pyknosis and/or karyorrhexis that affects aggregates of cells.\n\n\nComment: The nature of the vacuolation can be further characterized by special\ntechniques:\n\nVacuoles that contain neutral lipids stain positive with Oil Red O and Sudan\nBlack.\n\nAccumulation of intracytoplasmic lipid in villous epithelial cells has been\nreported with several xenobiotics, including glucose transport inhibitors,\npuromycin, ethionine and vanadium compounds which alter lipid synthesis or transport\n(Murgatroyd 1980; Greaves 2012; Imura et al. 2013). In addition, lipid droplets\nwere described where an ester of erythromycin was administered and the compound\nappeared to be absorbed unhydrolysed and converted to chylomicron-like droplets\nwhich accumulated in macrophages (Visscher et al. 1980).\n\nA fine cytoplasmic vacuolation, resulting in foamy appearance, may give the\nsuspicion of phospholipidosis. In such cases, the modifier \u201cfoamy\u201d should be used.\nIf the change reflects phospholipidosis, increases in size and number of lysosomes\ncan be identified by histochemistry (for alkaline phosphatase), immunostains (for\nlysosomal membrane proteins, e.g. LAMP-2) or by transmission electron microscopy.\nWith the later technique, concentric multilaminated structures (myeloid\nbodies/lamellar bodies) are observed in the lysosomes. The term phospholipidosis\nshould only be used when confirmation by one of these techniques has been\nachieved.\n\nIn the intestines, changes due to phospholipidosis are most commonly observed in\nmacrophages, but epithelial cells, myocytes and neuronal ganglia can also be\naffected depending on the particular cellular distribution of the test article\n(Reasor et al. 2006).\nAffected cells will probably be present in other organs and tissues of the body, but\nthe intestines are likely to be one of the more severely affected sites following\noral administration of a phospholipidosis-inducing test article (Mazue et al. 1984). The intestines\ncan also be affected following intravenous administration of such test articles\ndepending on the tissue distribution of the test article in the body. The classical\ndefinitive diagnostic feature is the identification of lysosomal lamellar bodies by\nelectron microscopy, but immunohistochemical staining for lysosomal membrane\nproteins can clearly distinguish lysosomes from neutral fat vacuole membranes\nstained immunohistochemically for adipophilin (Obert et al. 2007).\n\n\nDegeneration and necrosis of epithelial cells.Disorganisation of gland acini with disruption of basement membranes.Glands may be dilated and lined with flattened, atrophic epithelial cells.Accompanied by an inflammatory reaction.May be accompanied by reactive hyperplasia of the duodenal epithelium.\n\n\n\nAtrophy, Brunner\u2019s glands: Reduction in size and number of cells is present but\nnecrosis and inflammation are absent.\n\n\nComment: Degeneration/necrosis of Brunner\u2019s glands in rats has been described\nfollowing administration of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors directed\nagainst vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Inomata et al. 2014). Degeneration and necrosis\nof the glands is followed by disruption of the basement membrane leading to dilation\nof the glands and a neutrophilic inflammatory reaction. In the most severe lesions,\ninflammation extends into the surrounding mucosa and muscle layers. With more\nprolonged administration, dilated Brunner\u2019s glands lined with flattened atrophic\nepithelium are observed and these may form cystic spaces which can extend into the\nmuscle layers. A mixed neutrophilic and lymphocytic inflammatory reaction with\nfibrosis and reactive hyperplasia of neighbouring duodenal epithelium accompanies\nthese Brunner\u2019s gland changes after prolonged administration.\n\n\nDilated lacteals are present in the villi.Subcapsular sinuses of the mesenteric lymph node may also be dilated.May be accompanied by minimal vacuolation of epithelial cells and/or macrophages\nin the lamina propria.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: Lymphangiectasis may be primary, due to a metabolic alteration affecting\nthe formation of chylomicrons or transit of lipid in the lacteals, or secondary to\nblockage or inflammatory conditions e.g. neoplasia, fibrosis, granulomatous\ninfections. Lymphangiectasis in the small intestine due to the accumulation of large\nlipid droplets was described in rats administered indole-3-carbinol, possibly due to\nan impairment of lipid transport in the lacteals (Boyle et al. 2012). Although there were vacuolated\nmacrophages and giant cells in the lamina propria, the epithelial cells were\nunaffected (Boyle et al.\n2012).\n\n\nFormation of enterocyte syncytia (balloon cells occasionally containing\neosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions).Villous atrophy and mucosal necrosis also present, particularly in young\nmice.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: Epithelial syncytia are common in MHV infection and MHV infection should\nbe considered as an etiological agent when epithelial syncytia are observed.\n\nWith enterotropic MHV strains lesions are limited to the intestines and are\ngenerally located in ileum, cecum and proximal colon (Percy and Barthold 2007; Shackelford and Elwell\n1999). Lesions are most severe in young mice and are limited to syncytia in\nadult mice. Compensatory hyperplasia of the intestinal epithelium develops in mice\nthat survive the infection. With respiratory strains, enteric lesions are rare with\ninfection largely restricted to GALT.\n\n\nSingle cells or small clusters of cells.Cell shrinkage.Hypereosinophilic cytoplasm.Nuclear shrinkage, pyknosis, karyorrhexis. Intact cell membrane.Apoptotic bodies.Cytoplasm retained in apoptotic bodies.Phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies tissue macrophages or other adjacent cells.No inflammation.\n\n\n\nNecrosis, mucosa: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with\nnecrotic diagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.).Apoptosis/necrosis, mucosa: Both types of cell death are present and there is no\nrequirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for\nstatistical reasons. The term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be\ndetermined unequivocally.Erosion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive penetration of the mucosa, either\npartial (erosion) or full to the muscularis mucosa (ulcer).\n\n\nComment: The approach for the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of cell death\napplied here is based on a draft recommendation of the INHAND Cell Death\nNomenclature Working Group.\n\nApoptosis is not synonymous with necrosis. The main morphological differences\nbetween these two types of cell death are cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation\nand tingible body macrophages in apoptosis versus cell swelling, rupture and\ninflammation in necrosis; however, other morphologies (e.g. nucelar pyknosis and\nkaryorrhexis) overlap. In routine H&E sections where the morphology clearly\nrepresents apoptosis or single cell necrosis, or whereby special procedures (e.g.\nTEM or IHC for caspases) prove one or the other, individual diagnoses may be used.\nHowever, because of the overlapping morphologies, necrosis and apoptosis are not\nalways readily distinguishable via routine examination, and the two processes may\noccur sequentially and/or simultaneously depending on intensity and duration of the\nnoxious agent (Zeiss 2003). This often\nmakes it difficult and impractical to differentiate between both during routine\nlight microscopic examination. Therefore, the complex term apoptosis/necrosis may be\nused in routine toxicity studies.\n\nA differentiation between apoptosis and single cell necrosis may be required in the\ncontext of a given study, in particular if it aims for mechanistic investigations.\nTransmission electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to\nconfirm apoptosis. Other confirmatory techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to\nperform but insensitive), TUNEL (false positives from necrotic cells) or\nimmunohistochemistry for caspases, in particular caspase 3. These techniques are\nreviewed in detail by Elmore (2007).\nSome of these confirmatory techniques detect early phases of apoptosis, in contrast\nto the evaluation of H&E stained sections, which detects late phases only;\noverall interpretation of findings should take into account these potential\ndifferences. Thus, low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by evaluation of\nH&E stained slides only.\n\nCertain studies may require the consideration of forms of programmed cell death\nother than apoptosis which requires specific confirmatory techniques (Galluzzi et al. 2012).\n\n\nCells swollen with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm.Loss of nuclear basophilia, pyknosis and/or karyorrhexis that affects aggregates\nof cells.In more severe cases, there may be detachment of the epithelium from the\nsubmucosa.Typically, the presence of degenerative cells is a component of necrosis.Minimal or slight inflammatory cell infiltrates may be present as a feature of\nnecrosis.\n\n\nSingle cell\n\n\nOnly single cells affected.\n\n\n\nApoptosis: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis\n(cell and nucleus shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear pyknosis etc.)\nand/or special techniques demonstrate apoptosis.Apoptosis/necrosis, mucosa: Both types of cell death are present and there is no\nrequirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for\nstatistical reasons. The term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be\ndetermined unequivocally.Atrophy, mucosa: Reduced thickness of all layers of the squamous epithelium or,\nin severe cases, absence of basal germinative layers; usually no cellular\ndegeneration or necrosis.Erosion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive penetration of the mucosa, either\npartial (erosion) or full to the muscularis mucosa (ulcer).\n\n\nComments: Epithelial necrosis usually develops into erosion/ulcer and in the past\nhas frequently been recorded as such. A separate recording of necrosis as the\ninitial event in this process is recommended when the structure of the mucosa is\nstill intact.\n\n\nBoth types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them\nseparately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons.The type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally.\n\n\n\nApoptosis: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis\n(cell and nucleus shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear pyknosis etc.)\nand/or special techniques demonstrate apoptosis and there is a requirement for\nrecording apoptosis and necrosis separately.Necrosis, mucosa: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with\nnecrotic diagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.) and\nthere is a requirement for recording apoptosis and necrosis separately.Erosion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive penetration of the mucosa, either\npartial (erosion) or full to the muscularis mucosa (ulcer).\n\n\nComments: Necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine\nexamination, and the two processes may occur sequentially and/or simultaneously\ndepending on intensity and duration of the noxious agent (Zeiss 2003). This often makes it difficult and impractical\nto differentiate between both during routine light microscopic examination. In these\ncases, the combined term apoptosis/necrosis may be used. It is recommended to\nexplain in detail the use of this combined term in the narrative part of the\npathology report.\n\n\nEpithelial cells are necrotic or absent but muscularis mucosa is intact\n(erosion).Epithelial cell are necrotic or absent and muscularis mucosa has been destroyed\n(ulcer).Submucosal edema may be present, particularly with ulceration.Hemorrhage and hemosiderin may be present, particularly with ulcers.Epithelial cells adjacent to an erosion or ulcer may be necrotic, cuboidal to\nflat or basophilic.Inflammatory cell infiltration is present, except in recently formed lesions.Chronic lesions will show chronic inflammatory cell infiltration, granulation\ntissue, fibrosis and regenerative epithelial hyperplasia which results in irregular,\ncystic glands in the mucosa and submucosa.\n\n\n\nArtifact: Mechanical loss of mucosa during necropsy; plane of section related to\npresentation of tissue in block.Autolysis: Preferential destruction and loss of cells at the luminal surface; no\ninflammatory reaction.\n\n\nComment: The most likely cause of erosions and ulcers in immunocompetent barrier\nmaintained rodents is the administration of xenobiotics (Greaves 2012). Acute erosion and ulceration of the\ndistal small intestine has been described following administration of non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory agents, the newer inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and\ncytotoxic anticancer drugs, whereas ionizing radiation produces acute lesions\nfollowed by fibrosis and arteriolar sclerosis (Langberg and Hauer-Jensen 1996; Haschek et al. 2010). A variety\nof agents e.g. cysteamine, proprionitrile and\n1-methy-4-pheny-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) are capable of producing chronic\nulcers in the duodenum possibly by altering gastric acid secretion, bicarbonate\nproduction and its delivery to the duodenum, changes in duodenal motility and/or\ndopamine inhibition (Szabo and Cho\n1988). Some viral and bacterial infections may induce erosion and\nulceration, particularly in immunodeficient mice or rats (Haines et al. 1998).\n\nErosion/ulcer usually is the result of epithelial necrosis. Because of its unique\ntopography adjacent to the lumen and often involving multiple organ layers, which\nuniquely affects the progression and resolution of the lesion (e.g. margin\nhyperplasia, granulomatous tissue, inflammation), it is useful to record\nerosion/ulcer separately from epithelial necrosis.\n\n\nDeposition of pale amorphous, homogenous eosinophilic material.Extracellular location in connective tissue and/or blood vessel walls.Green birefringence with Congo red stain when viewed under polarized light.\n\n\n\nHyaline connective tissue: Congo red negative.Fibrinoid necrosis of blood vessels: Other evidence of tissue damage in\nsection.\n\n\nComment: Amyloidosis is extremely rare in rats but common in some strains of mice\nin which the lamina propria of the intestinal villi is a common site for deposition\nof amyloid. In susceptible strains of mice a number of factors including sex, diet,\nhousing conditions, stress, endocrine status and microbiological status can\ninfluence the occurrence of amyloidosis (Korenaga et al. 2004; Lipman et al. 1993). For as yet unidentified\nreasons the previously susceptible CD-1 strain in Europe now rarely develops\namyloidosis.\n\nThe characteristic morphologic appearance and location of amyloid in H&E\nsections that is usually adequate to make this diagnosis. Confirmation of the\ndeposits as amyloid can be accomplished with light microscopy using special stains\nsuch as Congo red. Amyloid appears apple green under polarized light with this\nstain.\n\nThe term \u201chyaline\u201d should be used in case of uncertainties about the nature of\nextracellular deposits hyaline material in H&E sections and the unavailability\nof a Congo red stain. Hyaline is also the appropriate term for homogenously\neosinophilic extracellular deposits that react negative with Congo red.\n\n\nMineral may be found in muscle layers, blood vessels, basement membranes and/or\nin the interstitium of mucosa and submucosa.Amorphous basophilic material.Mucosal mineralization can be limited to small focal deposits.\n\n\n\nArtifact: Hematoxylin stain precipitate.Bacteria: Colonies of bacteria may be confused with mineral due to their\nbasophilic staining. Ante mortem bacterial invasion will be accompanied by necrosis\nand usually inflammation; postmortem bacterial invasion will be accompanied by\nautolysis.Osseous metaplasia: Osteoid present.\n\n\nComment: Presence of mineral can be confirmed with von Kossa or Alizarin red stains\nbut these are rarely needed to make a diagnosis. Diffuse superficial mineralization\nof the colonic and rectal mucosa has been observed following administration of\nxenobiotics that decrease peristalsis and cause fecal retention (Gopinathet al. 1987). Multifocal\nor diffuse mineralization occurs secondary to chronic renal disease in rodents and\nin situations where serum calcium and/or phosphate balance are perturbed, but the\nintestines are not as susceptible as the glandular mucosa of the stomach.\n\n\nPresence of mineralized or non-mineralized bone matrix.\n\n\n\nMineralization: Osteoid absent.Sarcomas: Osseous metaplasia may be present in stroma of sarcomas.\n\n\nComment: Osseous metaplasia has been described in the submucosa and lamina propria\nof old rats in association with chronic inflammation, ulceration or regenerative\nhyperplasia (Elwell and\nMcConnell 1990;Maekawa\n1994; Bertram et al.\n1996).\n\n\nDilatation of the lumen is observable macroscopically.Mucosa, submucosa and muscularis are thin due to stretching.Degeneration of muscle fibers and ganglia cells in the nerve plexus may be\npresent.\n\n\n\nMeteorism: Dilatation of the lumen due to the accumulation of air occurs as the\nresult of mouth breathing and consequent aerophagia follows obstruction of nasal\nturbinates and/or nasopharynx in rodents as they are obligate nose breathers; the\nstomach will be more severely affected than the intestines.Obstruction: Dilatation of the lumen due to simple mechanical obstruction e.g.\nproximal to a tumor.\n\n\nComment: Megaileus with inflammation (megaileitis) is often present in rats with\nTyzzer\u2019s disease (infection with Clostridium piliforme); the lesions are\ncharacterized by a necrotizing transmural ileitis with necrosis of the mucosa and\nmuscularis, edema and infiltration primarily of mononuclear cells (Percy and Barthold 2007).\nCecomegaly is observed following administration of some antibiotics, starches,\npolyols, lactose, fibers and vehicles which have an osmotic effect (Newberne et al. 1988). Megacolon\nas a result of constipation was induced in rats by a calcium channel antagonist;\nsecondary mucosal necrosis, hemorrhage and inflammation were present in some rats\n(Nyska et al. 1994).\nTribromoethanol (Avertin) administered intraperitoneally as an anesthetic has been\nassociated with ileus in rodents (King and Russell 2006).\n\n\nObservable macroscopically.Invagination of a portion of intestine into its immediate distal section.Intestinal lumen proximal to the site of intussusception may be dilated whilst\ndistally the lumen may be contracted and devoid of contents.Histologically ischemic necrosis, inflammation, congestion and hemorrhage will\noften be present in the involved segments; the degree of such changes will depend on\nthe length of time that the intussusception has been formed.Adhesions may develop between the invaginating intussusceptum and the receiving\nintussuscipiens.Associated with intestinal tumors, especially polyps.\n\n\n\nArtifacts, post mortem invagination of the intestine: No reactive changes\npresent.\n\n\nComment: Intussusceptions are very rare in barrier maintained rodents but may occur\nin animals with intestinal tumors and rarely with high nematode infestations (Percy and Barthold 2007).\nVery occasionally an intussusception may be induced by a test article (Gopinath et al. 1987).\n\nAlthough intussusception is primarily a gross pathological term, it is recommended\nto use it also microscopically, as an unequivocal macroscopic diagnosis is not\nalways possible.\n\n\nObservable macroscopically.Eversion of rectum through the anus.Microscopic lesions of mucosal necrosis, hemorrhage, edema and inflammation.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: Rectal prolapses are rare in barrier maintained rodents but may occur\nsecondarily to inflammatory conditions in the colon and rectum such as occur with\nCitrobacter and Helicobacter infection in mice, weakening of anal sphincter and with\na high nematode load (Ward et al.\n1996; Percy and\nBarthold 2007; McInnes\n2012; Miller et al.\n2014).\n\nThe diagnosis of prolape is usually possible by gross pathological examination.\nNevertheless it is recommended to confirm the gross observation\nhistopathologically.\n\n\nFocal, multifocal or diffuse infiltration of cells in the lamina propria and/or\nsubmucosa.Presence of mononuclear or polymorphonuclear inflammatory cells but no other\nhistological criteria of inflammation.\n\n\n\nInflammation: Other morphologic features of inflammation such as edema,\nhemorrhage, necrosis and/or fibroplasia will be present.Granulocytic leukemia: Infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal\nneutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils; infiltration of\nsimilar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs.Lymphoma: Infiltration of monomorphic population of lymphocytes (often with\natypical, increased and/or abnormal mitoses); infiltration of similar neoplastic\ncells is likely present in other organs.\n\n\nComment: The number of mononuclear cells is the lamina propria of the large\nintestine (particularly cecum) is variable in healthy animals and care must be taken\nnot to \u2018over diagnose\u2019 infiltration of inflammatory cells.\n\n\nFocal, multifocal or diffuse infiltration of cells in the lamina propria and/or\nsubmucosa.Presence of other histological criteria of inflammation e.g. hemorrhage, edema,\nfibroplasia.\n\n\n\nInfiltrate, inflammatory cell: Other morphologic features of inflammation such as\nedema, hemorrhage, necrosis and/or fibroplasia will be absent.Granulocytic leukemia: Infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal\nneutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils; infiltration of\nsimilar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs.Lymphoma: Infiltration of monomorphic population of lymphocytes (often with\natypical, increased and/or abnormal mitoses); infiltration of similar neoplastic\ncells is likely present in other organs.\n\n\nComment: The most likely cause for inflammatory lesions in barrier maintained\nrodents is the administration of test articles, the best known examples being\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and anti-mitotic anticancer agents (Greaves 2012; Haschek et al. 2010). Hypersensitivity reactions\nmay play a role in test article induced inflammatory reactions, for example\ntrinitobenezensulfonic acid acts as hapten and induces a severe granulomatous\nreaction in the distal colon (Haschek et al. 2010). Because of the presence of numerous commensal\nbacteria in the intestine, there is the potential for secondary invasion of sites of\nmucosal injury and an exacerbation of any tissue injury and induction of an\ninflammatory response. Inflammatory lesions can be induced by pathogenic bacteria\ne.g. salmonella, Citrobacter freundii, Helicobacter spp or viruses (norovirus, mouse\nhepatitis virus) if there has been a barrier breakdown or in immunodeficient animals\n(Maggio-Price et al.\n2005; Percy and\nBarthold 2007). Eaton et al. recently described a grading procedure for\ninflammation in the large intestine (Eaton et al. 2011).\n\nProtozoa\n\n\nPresence of cross sections of protozoa in large intestinal lumen; morphology will\ndepend on whether ameboid, ciliate or flagellates are present.Inflammatory cell infiltration and/or edema may be present in lamina propria.\n\n\nNematodes\n\n\nPresence of cross sections of parasites in large intestinal lumen.Rarely submucosal granulomata may be present.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: It is now uncommon for intestinal parasites to be present in\nbarrier-reared and maintained rodents. Protozoa that have been reported in\nlaboratory rodents include Spironucleus muris, Giadia muris and Cryptosporidia\nmuris, but infections are often subclinical especially in adults of immunocompetent\nstrains (Percy and Barthold\n2007). The reader is referred to standard texts for a full list of\nintestinal protozoan that may be present in non-barrier maintained or wild rodents\n(Percy and Barthold\n2007; Baker 2007).\n\nThe most likely nematodes to be seen in the event of a barrier break down in a\nrodent unit are the pinworms Syphacia muris, Syphacia obvelata and/or Aspicularis\ntetrapertera which inhabit the large intestine (Percy and Barthold 2007). The reader is\nreferred to standard texts for a full list of intestinal parasites that may be\npresent in non-barrier maintained or wild rodents (Percy and Barthold 2007; Baker 2007).\n\n\nDegenerative changes (hyaline, vacuolar) in neurons.Intracytoplasmic inclusions (often hyaline) in neurons.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: The degenerative changes and inclusions have only been seen with\nflaviviral infections (Ward, personal observation). Viral antigen is abundant in\nthese ganglion cells.\n\nEdema and hemorrhage of the intestine are similar to those described for the upper\ndigestive tract. Other vascular lesions in the intestine and mesentery are dealt with in\nthe INHAND monograph on the cardiovascular system.\n\n\nExtension of crypts through muscularis mucosa, into submucosa and further in some\ncases.Morphology of epithelial lining is variable, ranging from single layer cuboidal\nor columnar cells to complete mucosa.Epithelium may show features of regeneration like increased basophilia, increased\nnucleus to cytoplasm ratio and gradual loss of polarity.Basement membrane integrity always maintained.Often accompanied by inflammation and regenerative / reparative processes.May contain ingesta, hair, or other foreign material.\n\n\nCystic:\n\n\nRounded cystic structures in lamina propria or deeper layers.Compression of surrounding structures, some degree of compression atrophy of the\nepithelium lining the cyst.May contain mucus.\n\n\nAtypical\n\n\nExtension of atypical/dysplastic mucosal glands into or through muscularis\nmucosa, submucosa, and deeper in some cases.Hyperplastic atypical (dysplastic) epithelial cells forming cystic glands that\nmay appear to be \u201cinvading\u201d into deeper layers of the intestine.Basement membrane always intact.\n\n\n\nAdenoma: Proliferation beyond the confinements of the intestinal mucosa.Adenocarcinoma: True infiltrative growth with loss of basement membrane integrity\nand often with a scirrhous stromal reaction.\n\n\nComment: These focal intestinal lesions are primarily formed by extensions of\nmucosal epithelium and do not involve evaginations of the other mural layers; as\nsuch they do not resemble diverticulosis in human colon, which may be focal,\nmultifocal or diffuse. Diverticula do not appear to be neoplastic, although they do\ncreate an increased risk of rupture and septic peritonitis. These structures are\ntypically lined by a simple cuboidal mucus epithelium.\n\nIt is not recommended to record \u201cdiverticulum\u201d and its modifier as a separate\nfinding, if it occurs in association with another proliferative process (e.g.\nhyperplasia, adenoma).\n\nSmall glandular diverticula lined by a single layer of cuboidal or columnar\nepithelium resemble \u201ccrypt herniation\u201d of human gastrointestinal pathology (e.g.\nRex et al. 2012). Such\nherniation of crypts through the muscularis mucosa is interpreted as\n\u201cpseudoinvasive\u201d or \u201cinverted\u201d growth pattern. Although the process-related term\n\u201ccrypt herniation\u201d is common in literature (e.g. Betton et al. 2001), the term \u201cdiverticulum\u201d is\nconsidered to better fit to the INHAND principle to use descriptive terms and to\navoid process-related terms (Mann et\nal. 2012).\n\nSpontaneous and induced intestinal diverticula occur more frequently in mice than\nin rats. They have been reported in the colon of Cdx-2 knockout mice due to a\ndevelopmental defect (Tamai et al.\n1999). In this model they appeared as polyps with herniation and due to the\ncongenital etiology the authors termed it hamatoma.\n\nAtypical diverticula must be distinguished from genuine neoplastic invasion (e.g.\nloss of basement membrane and other signs of malignancy in the latter). They are\nassociated with preexisting mucosal atypical hyperplasia/dysplasia as seen in\nspecific experimental conditions, tumor-associated intestinal toxins and\ngenetically-engineered mice. Whereas they often do not progress to unequivocal\nadenocarcinoma, atypical glandular and cellular features are consistent with\nneoplastic potential.\n\nAtypical diverticula may be associated with atypical hyperplasia and adenoma, but\nusually not with adenocarcinoma. As noted above for the simple diverticula, they\nshould not be recorded as a separate diagnostic entity when associated with another\nproliferative process.\n\n\nFocal or diffuse process accompanying epithelial damage; no evidence of\ncompression.Villous and glandular architecture is not altered by the proliferative process\nitself but in regenerative hyperplasia may have been altered by the initiating event\n(degeneration and necrosis).Focal penetration by glandular diverticula into lamina propria or deeper layers\nmay be present but basement membrane is always intact.No cellular or nuclear atypia.\n\n\nAvillous:\n\n\nFocal lesion of the duodenum in aging mice.Smooth luminal surface lacking intestinal villi.Hyperplastic crypts may often be interspersed between hyperplastic Brunner\u2019s\nglands.Goblet cells may be reduced or increased.Crypt dilatation and diverticula may be present in larger lesions.Frequently accompanied by submucosal edema and inflammatory cell\ninfiltration.\n\n\nAtypical:\n\n\nStructure of the intestinal villi and crypts often abnormal.Focal penetration by glandular diverticula into lamina propria or deeper layers\nmay be present but basement membrane is always intact.Cellular atypia and pleomorphism as evidenced by hyperchromatism with increased\ncytoplasmic basophilia and lost polarity, nuclear pleomorphism, increased N/C ratio,\nhyperchromasia, increased mitotic activity.\n\n\nGoblet cell:\n\n\nIncreased proportion of goblet cells, predominantly in crypts; crypts exhibit\nnormal length or are enlaged.\n\n\n\nAdenoma: Exophytic or endophytic growth pattern extending beyond the confinement\nof the mucosa; compression of adjacent tissue if growth pattern is not exclusively\npolypoid.\n\n\nComment: Reactive or reparative (regenerative) hyperplasias often follow injury due\nto chemicals, infectious agents and irradiation. Focal or diffuse reactive\nhyperplasia is seen in the cecum, colon and rectum of immuno-compromised mice\nfollowing Helicobacter infection. Diffuse reactive hyperplasia is observed in the\ndistal colon of mice infected with the gram negative bacterium Citrobacter freundii\n(transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia). Occasionally the transverse and\nascending colon and the cecum are affected. In such cases of hyperplasia the surface\nepithelium is covered by myriads of cocobacillary bacteria. The lamina propria shows\ndiffuse leukocytic infiltration.\n\nDiffuse non-reactive hyperplasia of the mucosa with increased height of the villi\nand depth of the crypts is synonymous with hypertrophy, mucosa. Hypertrophy is the\nrecommended term for such lesions.\n\nAn increased proportion of goblet cells has been reported in the literature as both\ngoblet cell hyperplasia or metaplasia. We recommend the term hyperplasia, as goblet\ncells are normal constituents of the intestinal mucosa. Hyperplasia of goblet cells\nhas been induced in the small and large intestine of rats by treatment with a gamma\nsecretase inhibitor (Aguirre et al.\n2014).\n\nFocal hyperplasia of the proximal duodenum, adjacent to the pylorus, occurs in aged\nmice has been referred to in the literature as avillous hyperplasia (Facinni, et al. 1990; McInnes 2012). It may be visible\nmacroscopically as a thickened plaque and is characterised by hyperplasia of all\ncells in the epithelium including Brunner\u2019s glands, but with loss of villi. The\nepithelium can show erosion/ulcer formation with associated inflammation. In the\nmore severe cases dilated mucosal glands can extend towards the submucosa and be\ninterspersed with dilated Brunner\u2019s glands.\n\nFocal atypical hyperplasia is a frequent finding in mice treated with test articles\nwhich affect the intestinal mucosa or in genetically-engineered mice. Under such\nconditions they often occur in multiple foci. It has not been described in untreated\nwild type animals so far. The term GIN or dysplasia has been used in\ngenetically-engineered mice. Other terms occasionally used but not preferred as\nsynonyms are microadenoma, carcinoma in situ, intra-epithelial carcinoma. Dysplasia\nis often used for similar lesions in human colon (Bosman et al. 2010).\n\nColon crypts exhibiting focal atypia (\u201caberrant crypt foci\u201d) can be demonstrated by\nthe examination of methylene blue stained colon whole mounts with a dissecting\nmicroscope (Raju 2008). They are\nusually not seen grossly until 1 mm in size.\n\nAtypical hyperplasia may be low-grade to high-grade, but this grading is usually\nnot included in the diagnosis.\n\nUnder conditions of experimental intestinal carcinogenesis, focal atypical\nhyperplasia is considered as a preneoplastic lesion that may progress to an adenoma\nor adenocarcinoma.\n\nRectal prolapse often due to Helicobacter sp or Citrobacter sp infection, often\nshows severe degrees of simple hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia and the appearance\nof a invasive-like growth pattern. These cases should be recorded as rectal\nprolapse.\n\n\nBrunner\u2019s glands cells are often hypertrophic with more extensive cytoplasm,\nlarger nuclei, or both.Glands are more branched and coiled, compared with normal glandular\nstructure.Brunner\u2019s glands cells and underlying stroma may form pedunculated structures\nwithin the spaces of cystic glands.Cellular polarity is maintained.Cells are tall columnar, with extensive, poorly-stained, or somewhat\neosinophilic-stained cytoplasm with dense, basally-located nuclei.Glands may expand into the underlying circular muscle layer, but basement\nmembrane integrity always maintained.\n\n\n\nDiverticulum: Localized and discrete penetration of intestinal crypts into lamina\npropria or deeper layers with maintained basement membrane integrity and surrounded\nby pre-existing mature tissues lacking a desmoplastic stromal response.Carcinoma, Brunner\u2019s glands: Effacement of Brunner\u2019s glands structures, prominent\ndesmoplasia; invasive growth.\n\n\nComment: Brunner\u2019s glands hyperplasia has been observed in transgenic mice\n(hemizygous rasH2) after dosing for one month with a receptor tyrosine kinase\ninhibitor that targets multiple cellular kinase receptors, including those of\nvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF),\nstem cell factor receptor (KIT), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3) and glial cell\nline-derived neurotrophic factor rearranged during transfection (RET). Progression\nfrom preneoplastic hyperplasia to carcinoma/adenocarcinoma can occur.\n\nTo appropriately capture the area of interest in the rodent, it is important to\nretain the gastroduodenal junction in a manner that allows a comprehensive\nevaluation of the area of interest and prevents folding of the stomach and\ngastroduodenal region that can obscure Brunner\u2019s glands. This can be accomplished by\nopening the stomach along the greater curvature, leaving the duodenum attached, and\npinning the tissue flat for fixation.\n\n\nFocal, multifocal or diffuseReplacement of normal epithelium with squamous epithelium.Frequently associated with chronic inflammation.\n\n\n\nCarcinoma, squamous cell: Invasion, areas with moderate to poor differentiation\nor anaplasia, ususally prominent mitoses.Extension of anal mucosa into rectum: Usually in proximity to the anus and\nwithout concomitant inflammatory reaction.\n\n\nComment: Squamous metaplasia is often seen in chronic colitis models in mice,\nusually in the dextran sulfate model. Squamous cell carcinomas have not been\nreported to arise in the lesions (Seamons et al. 2013).\n\n\nPolypoid, sessile or papillary tumor projecting into intestinal lumen.Sessile tumors have no stalk.Compression of adjacent tissue if growth pattern is not exclusively polypoid.Branching villi or tubular crypt proliferation can be present.Squamous metaplasia and focal mineralization may be present.May be associated with glandular or cystic diverticula, but basement membrane\nalways intact.One cell type is predominant and goblet cells are absent or reduced in\nnumber.The epithelium may contain foci of varying degrees of dysplasia.Signs of cellular atypia / dysplasia include cellular basophilia, loss of\ncellular polarity, hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei, and nuclear\nstratification.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia, atypical: Circumscribed proliferation with varying degree of atypia,\nbut limited to the confinements of the intestinal mucosa.Diverticulum: Extension of crypts through muscularis mucosa, into submucosa and\nfurther in some cases. Morphology of epithelial lining is variable, ranging from\nsingle layer cuboidal to columnar cells to complete mucosa. Epithelium may show\nfeatures of regeneration like increased basophilia, increased nucleus to cytoplasm\nratio and gradual loss of polarity. Often accompanied by inflammation and\nregenerative / reparative processes.Adenocarcinoma: True invasion by individual, groups or areas of tumor cells, with\nor without a stromal response.\n\n\nComment: The term \u201cpolyp\u201d was avoided, because of implied uncertainty about the\nneoplastic nature of this proliferative lesion. Benign neoplasms may develop\ndysplastic foci and evolve into malignant neoplasms. Chemicals causing benign\nintestinal tumors often also cause intestinal adenocarcinomas (Chandra et al. 2010; Pandiri et al. 2011; Ward 1974).\n\nAdenomas, as well as atypical hyperplasia, exhibit some degree of dysplasia and\ndistortion of pre-existing architecture. Macroscopic visibility has been suggested\nas a differential diagnostic criterion by some authors. This criterion is not used\nin the context of this description of histologic criteria. Any lesion exhibiting a\npapillary or polypoid growth pattern is an adenoma, irrespective whether it was\ngrossly visible or not. An intra-epithelial small focus (compatible with atypical\nhyperplasia) with cytological characteristics seen in adenomas should NOT be\ndiagnosed as an adenoma.\n\nThe frequency of spontaneous intestinal adenomas varies with the intestinal\nsegment. Incidences up to 51% are reported for the duodenum and anterior part of the\njejunum (Hare and Stewart\n1956). In the other intestinal segments the incidence of adenomas is below\n5%. However, the detection frequency is highly dependent on the mode of macroscopic\nexamination of the intestines, e.g. random blocks, naked eye inspection of mucosal\nsurface, transillumination or Swiss roll technique.\n\nThe determination of the malignancy status of a papillary or polypoid intestinal\ntumor requires a good fixation and trimming protocol, to obtain an optimal section\nthrough the middle of the tumor with its connecting area to the normal intestine. If\nthere is no connection to the intestine, it is impossible to determine if invasion\nis present. The cytology of a non-invasive adenoma may include high grade dysplasia.\nIn most rat and mouse chemically-induced or genetically-engineered tumor models,\ntrue invasion of the stalk is unusual but may occur commonly in other models.\n\n\nMucosal architecture is distorted.Growth patterns include tubular, papillary, tubulopapillary, mucinous, signet\nring, cystic, scirrhous and combinations of all types; different etiologies may\nresult in different growth patterns.Mucus-producing cells may be interspersed between absorptive cells.Mucus may be present intracellularly or extracellularly.Signet ring cell type: intracellular accumulation of mucus, leading to the\ncharacteristic appearance of these cells; high invasive growth; therefore, single\ntumor cells and groups of cells are interspersed between pre-existing tissues.Squamous metaplasia and focal mineralization are not present.Varying degrees of cellular atypia.Many mitotic figures.Invasion through muscularis mucosa or deeper layers of the intestinal wall, stalk\nof an adenoma, or adjacent organs.Often scirrhous response in areas of invasion.\n\n\n\nDiverticulum: Localized and discrete penetration into lamina propria or deeper\nlayers with maintained basement membrane integrity and surrounded by pre-existing\nmature tissues lacking a scirrhotic stromal response.Hyperplasia atypical and adenoma: May be associated with glandular or cystic\ndiverticula, but basement membrane always intact.Rectal prolapse (mice): Associated with Helicobacter sp or Citrobacter sp\ninfection in mice; hyperplastic epithelium extending as diverticula through\nmuscularis mucosa and into submucosa, with associated inflammation.\n\n\nComment: An intestinal adenocarcinoma may arise de novo from normal epithelium, but\nmore commonly from a preneoplastic lesion such as atypical hyperplasia or from an\nadenoma. The histogenesis, morphology and biology of tumor progression often depend\non the etiology, i.e. the chemical carcinogen or the kind of genetic change in a GEM\nmodel.\n\nIn contrast to humans, spontaneous rodent adenocarcinomas show a predilection for\nthe small intestine, especially the jejunum and ileum, rather than the large\nintestine. The descriptions available indicate that the morphology of spontaneous\nlesions does obviously differ from the induced ones and that the etiology may\ndetermine the morphologic phenotype. In addition, induced adenocarcinomas have their\npreferred localization in the distal colon and show high invasiveness combined with\na low tendency to metastasize. Helicobacter sp has been shown to be a colon\nco-carcinogen in some experimental mouse models involving GEM or immunodeficient\nmice (Erdman and Poutahidis\n2010). Inflammatory mouse models of colon adenocarcinoma are often\nscirrhous and mucinous (Erdman and Poutahidis 2010; Kosa et al. 2012).\n\nMetastases are often associated with a specific method of tumor induction. In rats,\nthe mucinous adenocarcinoma induced by some carcinogens commonly metastasizes,\npredominantly to the lung. Mucinous intestinal adenocarcinomas are often the most\nmalignant type of intestinal tumor in rats and mice (Ward et al. 1973).\n\n\nThere is effacement of Brunner\u2019s glandular structures and the gastroduodenal\njunction.Desmoplasia is prominent and can be the most dominant feature.Glandular structure is diminished or completely lost.The mitotic index is usually low.There is moderate pleomorphism of Brunner\u2019s glandular cells.Cells have well-stained cytoplasm that may be eosinophilic, amphophilic or\nbasophilic.Attenuated glandular cells may line cystic areas that contain mucus.Invasion through the muscularis mucosa and/or through the circular and\nlongitudinal muscles, as well as the serosa, can be extensive. The basement membrane\nof the glands is breached or not evident.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia, Brunner\u2019s glands: Glandular architecture may be slightly altered,\nbut still recognizable; cell polarity maintained; glands may penetrate into the\nunderlying circular muscle layer, but basement membrane maintained.Diverticulum: Localized and discrete penetration of intestinal crypts into lamina\npropria or deeper layers with maintained basement membrane integrity and surrounded\nby pre-existing mature tissues lacking a desmoplastic stromal response.\n\n\nComment: Brunner\u2019s glands carcinoma is a rare tumor, although a high occurrence can\nbe induced with certain test articles. Brunner\u2019s glands carcinoma has been observed\nin transgenic mice (CB6/F1/Jic Tg rasH2 hemizygous) and Sprague-Dawley rats after\ndosing for 6 and 24 months, respectively, with a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor\nthat targets multiple cellular kinase receptors (see Brunner\u2019s glands hyperplasia;\nComment). The investigations in the transgenic model indicated that the rapid\noccurrence and high incidence of Brunner\u2019s glands carcinoma is more consistent with\naltered transcriptional regulation rather than a genotoxic mechanism.\n\nKnowledge of the site of the incipient lesion or the use of immunohistochemical\nmethods are often required to diagnose the origin of the change because invasion of\na gastric glandular cell or duodenal enterocyte carcinoma can have similar\nmorphologic features to those of a malignant neoplasm of Brunner\u2019s glands that has\nprogressed extensively.\n\n\nIntramural involvement.Interlacing bundles and whorls of uniform spindle cells arranged in criss-cross\npatterns of bundles.Nuclei typically blunt-ended or cigar shaped.Eosinophilic cytoplasm contains longitudinal myofilaments and perinuclear clear\nspace and show immunoreactivity for desmin.\n\n\n\nLeiomyosarcoma: Shows mitotic activity and cellular pleomorphism.Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST): Differentiation from other soft tissue\ntumors need only be made in cases of intergroup difference in the incidence of soft\ntissue tumors in a given study; unequivocal differentiation from other soft tissue\ntumors possible only by immunohistochemistry: Typically CD117 positive (cytokine\nreceptor encoded by c-kit); spindle, epithelioid, or pleomorphic cell morphology.\nIndistinct cell borders and fibrillary cytoplasm; cells may be arranged in bundles\nwith storiform architecture; spindle- or irregular-shaped nuclei.Schwannoma: CD117 negative, S-100 positive; indistinct cell borders, elongate\ncells with eosinophilic cytoplasm; nuclei sometime arranged in palisades (i.e.,\nAntoni A pattern).Fibroma/sarcoma: CD 117 and S-100 negative; interlacing bundles of spindle cells;\nMasson\u2019s trichrome-blue collagen.Histiocytic sarcoma: Positive for histiocytic markers (ED-1 for rats, Factor 4/80\nin mice), CD 117 and S-100 negative; infiltrative pattern, pleomorphic\nmorphology.\n\n\nComment: Similar to those observed in other sites [see also INHAND-publication of\nsoft tissue tumors (Greaves et al.\n2013)].\n\n\nIntramural involvement.Similar to leiomyoma, but more pleomorphic and with mitotic activity.Necrosis, cystic change and mineralization are common features.Distant metastases.\n\n\n\nLeiomyoma: Shows little or no cellular pleomorphism or mitotic activity.Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST): Differentiation from other soft tissue\ntumors need only be made in cases of intergroup difference in the incidence of soft\ntissue tumors in a given study; unequivocal differentiation from other soft tissue\ntumors possible only by immunohistochemistry: Typically CD117 positive (cytokine\nreceptor encoded by c-kit); spindle, epithelioid, or pleomorphic cell morphology.\nIndistinct cell borders and fibrillary cytoplasm; cells may be arranged in bundles\nwith storiform architecture; spindle- or irregular-shaped nuclei.Schwannoma: CD117 negative, S-100 positive; indistinct cell borders, elongate\ncells with eosinophilic cytoplasm; nuclei sometime arranged in palisades (i.e.,\nAntoni A pattern).Fibroma/sarcoma: CD 117 and S-100 negative; interlacing bundles of spindle cells;\nMasson\u2019s trichrome-blue collagen.Histiocytic sarcoma: Positive for histiocytic markers (ED-1 for rats, Factor 4/80\nin mice), CD 117 and S-100 negative; infiltrative pattern, pleomorphic\nmorphology.\n\n\nComment: Similar to those observed in other sites [see also INHAND-publication of\nsoft tissue tumors (Greaves et al.\n2013)].\n\nGastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), benign (Figures 152, 153 and 154)\n\nSynonyms: Interstitial Cajal cell tumor, benign; gastrointestinal pacemaker cell\ntumor, benign\n\nHistogenesis: Specialized smooth muscle cells (i.e., interstitial cells of Cajal)\nin the tunica muscularis or myenteric plexus.\n\n\n Well demarcated tumor, expansive growth.Cells may be arranged in bundles with storiform architecture, myxoid areas may be\npresent.Spindle, epithelioid, or pleomorphic cell morphology.

The question\narises whether conventionally classified stromal tumors (e.g., leiomyoma) previously\nwere actually GIST.\n\nThe salivary glands consist of major and minor glands and develop from the endodermal\nlining of the embryonal gut. The major salivary glands are grossly apparent and include\nthe parotid, sublingual and submandibular glands. The minor salivary glands are\nmicroscopic and are distributed throughout the oral cavity encompassing the lingual (von\nEbner\u2019s glands around the vallate and foliate papillae, Weber\u2019s glands at base of the\ntongue), sublingual, buccal, palatine, laryngeal and pharyngeal tissues. The submandibular\ngland matures with age and progress from rudimentary lobules of mesenchyme with ductular\nstructures at birth to acinar development and complete maturation by about 30 days\npostnatally in rats (Proctor and\nCarpenter, 2007). The sublingual salivary glands are mature at birth unlike the\nparotid and submandibular salivary glands.\n\nThe major salivary glands are located on the ventral and lateral areas of the cervical\nregion and extend to the base of the ear and are closely associated with the extraorbital\nlachrymal gland and mandibular lymph nodes. The largest of the three major salivary\nglands, the submandibular (mandibular or submaxillary) salivary gland is a tan,\nmultilobular gland that is located in the ventral cervical region. It extends rostrally to\nthe mandibular lymph nodes, caudally to the thoracic inlet, and is bordered bilaterally by\nthe parotid glands. The sublingual glands consist of tan-brown bilateral single lobes\nlocated on the rostro-lateral surface of each of the submandibular glands and directly\nbelow the mandibular lymph nodes. The parotid glands are bilateral and consist of pink to\noff white, multiple flattened lobes extending from the submandibular gland ventrally, to\nthe base of the ear dorsally, to the extraorbital lacrimal gland rostrally, and to the\nclavicle caudally. The parotid glands drain into the parotid duct while the submandibular\nand sublingual glands drain into the oral cavity via Wharton\u2019s duct that terminates in\nsmall papillae near the incisors.\n\nThe submandibular gland is a seromucinous (mixed) compound\ntubuloacinar gland. In the mouse it is predominantly seromucinous, where as, in\nthe rat it is mostly mucinous with a small serous component (Gresik, 1994; Ozono et al. 1991; Tucker,\n2007)). The submandibular gland is comprised of several adenomeres with\nlarge pyramidal mucous cells that are flanked basally by variable\nnumbers of cresentric serous demilunes. The large pyramidal mucous cells\nhave abundant vesicular basophilic cytoplasm and basally located nuclei and the cresentric\nserous demilunes have scant eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic\nnuclei. The acinar secretions from the adenomeres empty into intercalated\nducts lined by low cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells. Few\noncocytes are interspersed between the cuboidal epithelial cells of the\nintercalated ducts of aged rats. These cells are characterized by abundant granular\neosinophilic cytoplasm (abundant mitochondria) and a central hyperchromatic nucleus. Thin\nfusiform myoepithelial cells are located between the basal lamina and\nepithelial cells of acini and intercalated ducts (Bogart, 10970; Sashima, 1986).\nOnly in the submandibular gland, the intercalated ducts continue into granular\n(convoluted) ducts. The granular ducts are lined by tall columnar epithelial\ncells with abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm. The granulation of these ducts is\nmuch more prominent in sexually mature males when compared to females (Figures 156 and 157). These ducts continue into striated (intralobular) ducts that are\nlined by a single layer of tall columnar epithelial cells with marked basal infoldings\n(hence, striated cells) and central to apically located nuclei. Several of the striated\n(intralobular) ducts merge into interlobular excretory ducts that are\nlined by tall columnar epithelial cells with more apically located nuclei and prominent\ncytoplasmic striations. Several interlobular excretory ducts continue into one\nmain excretory duct that expands into a diverticulum lined by simple\ncolumnar epithelium and end as squamous epithelium at the oral surface.\n\nThe sublingual gland is predominantly mucous secreting and has the largest\nacini. They are comprised of large pyramidal mucus cells with basally located nuclei and\nare infrequently capped by serous demilunes. The acinar secretions empty into\nintercalated ducts that in turn empty into striated\n(intralobular) ducts. The multiple striated ducts empty into the main excretory\nduct. The microscopic anatomy of the ducts is similar to their counterparts within the\nsubmandibular gland.\n\nThe parotid gland contains serous acini, which are morphologically very\nsimilar to the exocrine pancreatic acini (Wolff et al. 2002). The acinar cells are pyramidal with broad basophilic base\nand tapered apices. The eosinophilic granular cytoplasm contains zymogen granules, the\nnuclei are basally located. The duct system of the parotid gland is similar to the\nsubmandibular gland.\n\nThe minor salivary glands lack a true connective tissue capsules and are\nusually located within the submucosa or are interspaced between connective tissue stroma\nor muscle fibers. The glands are morphologically diverse and are organized into distinct\nserous (von Ebner\u2019s glands), mucous (anterior and posterior buccal glands and minor\nsublingual glands) or mucous glands with serous demilunes (glossopalatal, palatal, and\nWeber\u2019s glands, Figure 155) glands (Redman 2011). The acini are organized into\nlobule-like structures and collections of secretory end pieces and ducts open onto the\nmucosal surface.\n\nThe salivary glands secrete a hypotonic sero-mucinous saliva containing electrolytes and\nenzymes that aid in lubrication and partial digestion of food. The serous secretions\ncontain water, electrolytes (rich in K+ and HCO3\u2013 and poor in\nNa+ and Cl\u2013 compared to plasma), IgA and enzymes (ptyalin\n(amylase), lysozyme, lipase) and the mucinous secretions contain water, and glycoproteins.\nThe minor salivary glands contribute about 14% protein and 1% amylase of the total\nsalivary secretions, as determined by pilocarpine stimulation (Blazsek and Varga 1999).\n\nThe salivary secretions are tightly regulated by the sympathetic (adrenergic) and\nparasympathetic (cholinergic) nervous system (Garrett 1987). Most cell types within the submaxillary and parotid glands have\nboth sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations while the sublingual glands have scant\nsympathetic innervation limited to striated ducts and blood vessels (Garrett et al. 1991). The parasympathetic system and\nthe \u03b1-adrenergic sympathetic system regulate the water and inorganic ion phase of the\nprimary secretory fluid, whereas the \u03b2-adrenergic sympathetic system effects primarily the\nmacromolecular (enzymes) phase. Parasympathetic stimulation is mainly responsible for\nstimulation of the salivary acini resulting in copious secretion of saliva, however, the\nsympathetic stimulation does not inhibit salivary secretion but it modulates the saliva\ncomposition and causes salivary secretion to a lesser extent (Proctor and Carpenter 2007). The sympathetic and\nparasympathetic stimulation of the myoepithelial cells surrounding the acini results in\ncontraction of acini and directing the saliva into the ducts (Tucker 2007). Surprisingly, it is the sympathetic stimulation\nbut not parasympathetic stimulation that results in morphologically obvious depletion of\nstorage granules within the acini (Garrett\net al. 1991). \u03b2-adrenergic sympathomimetic agonists such as isoprenaline (Selye et al. 1961) and terbutaline (Sodicoff et al. 1980) first cause\nrapid depletion of secretory granules and later promotes re-synthesis of secretory\nmaterial leading to acinar cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia. On the other hand,\n\u03b2-adrenergic antagonists like propranolol suppress salivary secretions and eventually\ncause acinar atrophy (Fukuda 1968).\n\nThe sexual dimorphism of the submandibular gland salivary glands is dependent on\ntestosterone levels (Harvey 1952). The\nincreased granularity in males (Figure 156) is\naccompanied by an about 10 times higher aminotransferase activity compared to females that\nhave very little if any ductal secretory granules (Figure 156) (Hosoi et al.\n1978).\n\nA typical approach for toxicological examination includes all the three grossly visible\nmajor salivary glands, i.e., submandibular, sublingual, and parotid gland. At necropsy,\nall three major salivary glands are removed in one piece, usually together with the\nmandibular lymph nodes. Trimming of the salivary glands is then undertaken as specified in\nthe RITA trimming guide (website//reni.item.fraunhofer.de/reni/trimming): The salivary\nglands are trimmed longitudinally and through the largest surface. All three salivary\nglands should be present in the section.\n\nThe typical approach may be varied according to study protocol requirements, e.g.\ndetermination of organ weights and tissues required for pathology examination.\n\nThe microscopic minor lingual glands are routinely examined if the entire tongue,\nincluding its base, is removed at necropsy and trimmed longitudinally. The other minor\nsalivary glands located within the oral cavity and pharynx are examined only occasionally\nduring microscopic evaluation of these tissues.\n\n\nFocal.Circumscribed normal parotid, submandibular or sublingual gland acini within a\nheterotopic salivary gland.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: Care should be taken to differentiate sectioning artifacts (\u201cfloaters\u201d)\nfrom the ectopic parotid gland in the sublingual glands.\n\n\nDistribution may be focal or multifocal and involve several lobules or a diffuse\nchange involving all the lobes.Cells may be swollen with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and have intracytoplasmic\nvacuoles with variably margins.The size of vacuoles may vary from small (microvesicular) to large when multiple\nsmall vacuoles coalesce together (macrovesicular) often resulting in nuclear\ndisplacement.Variable loss of zymogen granules or mucinous secretions within the affected\ncellsLobular architecture of gland is retained.\n\n\nFoamy\n\n\nHypertrophic cells with foamy cytoplasm characterized by clear vesicles with\neosinophilic fine granules\n\n\n\nArtifact: Medium-sized clear vesicles within the cytoplasm of acinar cells,\nespecially at the periphery. No positive staining by fat stains.\n\n\nComments: Based solely on light microscopic evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin\nstained tissue sections, it is not possible to conclusively characterize the nature\nof the intracytoplasmic vacuoles. Hence, vacuolation, cytoplasmic is the preferred\nterminology of the lesion that was previously diagnosed as fatty change, hydropic\ndegeneration, cloudy swelling etc. Any chemical/factor affecting the integrity of\nthe cell membranes can potentially cause poorly defined intracytoplasmic vacuoles\nthat was previously diagnosed as hydropic degeneration (Sela et al. 1977; Simson, 1972). Care should be taken to discriminate\nartifactual vacuolation induced by processing from the lesion induced by\ntreatment.\n\nSome metabolic insults cause disruption of normal lipid transport and metabolism\nand subsequently cause accumulation of lipid within the cytoplasm. In the\nstreptozotocin-diabetes rat model, the parotid is the major salivary gland most\nsusceptible to cytoplasmic vacuolation (Anderson 1998). Cytoplasmic vacuolation within the parotid was observed in\ndoxylamine treated F344 rats (Jackson and Blackwell 1988). Cytoplasmic vacuolation within the parotid\nbut not submandibular glands was noted in aged Wistar rats (Andrew 1949). Oil Red O and Sudan Black stains on frozen\nsections help to identify the neutral lipids within the micro/macro vesicles and to\ndifferentiate fatty change from vacuoles of different nature, in particular hydropic\ndegeneration.\n\nA fine cytoplasmic vacuolation, resulting from foamy appearance, may give the\nsuspicion of phospholipidosis. In such cases, the modifier \u201cfoamy\u201d should be used.\nIf the change reflects phospholipidosis, increases in size and number of lysosomes\ncan be identified by histochemistry (for alkaline phosphatase), immunostains (for\nlysosomal membrane proteins, e.g. LAMP-2) or by transmission electron microscopy.\nWith the later technique, multilamellated structures (myeloid bodies/lamellar\nbodies) are observed in the lysosomes. The term phospholipidosis should only be used\nwhen confirmation by one of these techniques has been achieved.\n\n\nMultifocal to coalescing accumulations of adipocytes within the interstitium.Compression of the adjacent acini, ducts and lobes.Moderate replacement (loss) of acini in rare cases.Disruption of lobular structure.\n\n\n\nVacuolation due to storage of lipids: Moderate to abundant intracytoplasmic lipid\nvacuoles; acinar and ductular architecture is retained.Atrophy: Reduction in the number/size of acini is the predominant finding.\n\n\nComment: The accumulation of adipocytes within salivary glands is an uncommon\nlesion and it may be an age related change. It occurs predominantly in parotid and\nless commonly in submandibular and sublingual salivary glands (Andrew 1949).\n\n\nSingle cells or small clusters of cells.Cell shrinkage.Hypereosinophilic cytoplasm.Nuclear shrinkage, pyknosis, karyorrhexis. Intact cell membrane.Apoptotic bodies.Cytoplasm retained in apoptotic bodies.Phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies tissue macrophages or other adjacent cells.No inflammation.\n\n\n\nNecrosis: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic\ndiagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.).Apoptosis/necrosis: Both types of cell death are present and there is no\nrequirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for\nstatistical reasons. The term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be\ndetermined unequivocally.\n\n\nComment: The approach for the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of cell death\napplied here is based on a draft recommendation of the INHAND Cell Death\nNomenclature Working Group.\n\nApoptosis is not synonymous with necrosis. The main morphological differences\nbetween these two types of cell death are cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation\nand tingible body macrophages in apoptosis versus cell swelling, rupture and\ninflammation in necrosis; however, other morphologies (e.g. nucelar pyknosis and\nkaryorrhexis) overlap. In routine H&E sections where the morphology clearly\nrepresents apoptosis or single cell necrosis, or whereby special procedures (e.g.\nTEM or IHC for caspases) prove one or the other, individual diagnoses may be used.\nHowever, because of the overlapping morphologies, necrosis and apoptosis are not\nalways readily distinguishable via routine examination, and the two processes may\noccur sequentially and/or simultaneously depending on intensity and duration of the\nnoxious agent (Zeiss 2003). This often\nmakes it difficult and impractical to differentiate between both during routine\nlight microscopic examination. Therefore, the complex term apoptosis/necrosis may be\nused in routine toxicity studies.\n\nA differentiation between apoptosis and single cell necrosis may be required in the\ncontext of a given study, in particular if it aims for mechanistic investigations.\nTransmission electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to\nconfirm apoptosis. Other confirmatory techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to\nperform but insensitive), TUNEL (false positives from necrotic cells) or\nimmunohistochemistry for caspases, in particular caspase 3. These techniques are\nreviewed in detail by Elmore (Elmore\n2007). Some of these confirmatory techniques detect early phases of\napoptosis, in contrast to the evaluation of H&E stained sections, which detects\nlate phases only; overall interpretation of findings should take into account these\npotential differences. Thus, low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by\nevaluation of H&E stained slides only.\n\nCertain studies may require the consideration of forms of programmed cell death\nother than apoptosis which requires specific confirmatory techniques (Galluzzi et al. 2012).\n\n\nFocal affecting cell groups, lobular, diffuse.Cells swollen with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm.Loss of nuclear basophilia, pyknosis and/or karyorrhexis that affects aggregates\nof cells.In more severe cases, there may be detachment of the epithelium from the\nsubmucosa.Typically, the presence of degenerative cells is a component of necrosis.Minimal or slight inflammatory cell infiltrates, edema and fibrin may be present\nas a feature of necrosis.\n\n\nSingle cell\n\n\nOnly single cells affected.\n\n\n\nApoptosis: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis\n(cell and nucleus shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear pyknosis etc.)\nand/or special techniques demonstrate apoptosis.Apoptosis/necrosis: Both types of cell death are present and there is no\nrequirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for\nstatistical reasons. The term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be\ndetermined unequivocally.Inflammation, acute: Infiltrates of inflammatory cells, edema, and fibrin\npredominate; necrosis may be present, but is a minor component.\n\n\nComments: Necrosis is usually accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltrate and is\nusually a significant component of acute inflammation (Levin et al. 1999). Necrosis of salivary glands may\nbe due to chemical toxicity or emboli.\n\n\nBoth types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them\nseparately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons.The type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally.\n\n\n\nApoptosis: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis\n(cell and nucleus shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear pyknosis etc.)\nand/or special techniques demonstrate apoptosis and there is a requirement for\nrecording apoptosis and necrosis separately.Necrosis: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic\ndiagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.) and there is a\nrequirement for recording apoptosis and necrosis separately.\n\n\nComments: Necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine\nexamination, and the two processes may occur sequentially and/or simultaneously\ndepending on intensity and duration of the noxious agent (Zeiss 2003). This often makes it difficult and impractical\nto differentiate between both during routine light microscopic examination. In these\ncases, the combined term apoptosis/necrosis may be used. It is recommended to\nexplain in detail the use of this combined term in the narrative part of the\npathology report.\n\n\nFocal, lobular or diffuse.Reduced acinar diameter.Partial or complete loss of acinar cell zymogen granules or mucin leading to a\nreduced cell size and increased basophilia.Lack of fibrosis or adipocyte infiltration.\n\n\n\nAtrophy, acinar cell: Complete degranulation of acini may be accompanied by\nfibrosis, mononuclear cell infiltrates, prominent intra- and inter-lobular\nducts.\n\n\nComment: The morphology of the acini may be altered due to several physiological\nconditions, such as anorexia/inanition. Degranulation of the acini may also be noted\nin rodents treated with sympathomimetic agents like isoprenaline (Selye et al. 1961) and terbutaline\n(Sodicoff et al.\n1980).\n\nSecretory depletion, granular duct (submandibular gland) (Figure 166)\n\nSynonym: Feminization of the granular duct; degranulation granular duct\n\nPathogenesis: Decrease of granulated duct cell serous granules leading to shrunken\ngranulated duct cells.\n\n\nMay be focal or multifocal, but usually diffuse.Affects males, not females.Partial or complete loss of serous granules leading to a reduced cell size.Reduced cell diameter of the granulated duct cell.Lack of fibrosis or adipocyte infiltration.May be accompanied by degranulation of the acinar cells.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: The morphology of the granular ducts is androgen dependent. Secretory\ndepletion and subsequent atrophy of granular ducts may be observed in male rats and\nmice with decreased androgen levels. It is also observed in the\nstreptozotocin-induced chronic diabetes rat model. The acinar cells are less\nsusceptible compared to the granular ducts. The atrophy of the granular ducts in\nchronic diabetic rats may be due to the hypogonadal effect of diabetes. In cases of\nsympathetic but not parasympathetic nerve stimulation, extensive degranulation may\nbe observed in both acinar (beta-adrenergic) and granular duct (alpha-adrenergic)\ncells.\n\nGranules increased, granular duct (submandibular gland) (Figure 167)\n\nSynonym: Masculinization of the granular duct\n\nPathogenesis: Increased androgenic stimulus in females.\n\n\nDiffuse, limited to the submandibular gland of females.Prominent large granular ducts with increased eosinophilic granules within female\nanimals.Increased granularity of the granular duct.Increased diameter of the granular cells.Except for the change in the granular duct, rest of the histomorphology is\nnormal.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: The submandibular salivary gland is sexually dimorphic and shows increased\ngranularity of the convoluted (granular) ducts in males compared to females. When\nfemale rats or mice are treated with androgenic test articles (e.g. androstenedione\nor oxymetholone) or have increased endogenous androgen levels, their granular ducts\nof the submandibular glands acquires male morphology.\n\n\nFocal, lobular or diffuse.Variable reduction in the number and/or size of acini to total loss of acini.Degranulation (parotid), reduced mucin (submandibular and sublingual).Relatively more numerous, prominent, occasionally dilated, intra- and\ninter-lobular ducts lined by cuboidal or flattened epithelial cells.Pyknotic and karyorrhectic nuclei, apoptotic bodies may be present,.Variable degree of interstitial fibrosis with/without lymphocytes and plasma\ncells.Scattered to coalescing adipocytes may be present within the interstitium.May be accompanied by mineralization of luminal contents, salivary calculus,\nductular foreign bodies.\n\n\n\nSecretory depletion, acinar cell: Variable loss of serous or mucinous granules\nresulting in reduced cellular size, lack of fibrosis or adipocyte infiltration, or\nlack of chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate.Accumulation, adipocytes: Accumulation of adipocytes is the predominant\nfinding.\n\n\nComment: Atrophy more commonly affects the submandibular and parotid glands than\nthe sublingual gland. It may be an age related lesion or may be induced\nexperimentally, usually as a secondary response after obstruction of excretory ducts\nor after alteration of trophic factors. Examples for obstruction of excretory ducts\ninclude ligation (Bhaskar et al.\n1956; Standish and\nShafer 1957), sialoliths and foreign bodies. Testosterone,\nadrenocorticoids, and sympathetic stimulation are important trophic factors for the\nsalivary glands. Any experimental condition that acts on their homeostasis may\npotentially induce diffuse salivary gland atrophy. This has been shown for\nhypophysectomy (Koerker 1967),\nadrenalectomy, denervation and \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists. Also decreased food\nconsumption, and protein starvation lead to salivary gland atrophy. Atrophy of\nsalivary glands due to liquid diet affects parotid and submandibular glands but the\nsublingual glands are apparently spared (Hall and Schneyer 1964; Scott and Gunn 1991). Also, the sublingual glands\nlack sympathetic innervation and thus are spared in situations where the chemicals\nact on the sympathetic nervous system. Salivary gland atrophy was noted in F344 rats\ntreated with sodium dichromate dihydrate (NTP,\n2008). Often, salivary atrophy is accompanied by mild chronic inflammation\nand mild interstitial fibrosis.\n\n\nFocal, lobular, diffuse.Affected structures are ducts and arteries (metastatic mineralization) or areas\nof degeneration / necrosis (dystrophic mineralization).Dark basophilic granular material (on H&E) replacing acini, ducts or\ninterstitium.\n\n\n\nArtifacts: Hematoxylin stain deposits (distribution unrelated to tissue\nstructures), acid hematin (birefringent in polarized light).Pigment: Lipofusin and porphyrin stain brown to golden brown on H&E and may\nfurther be differentiated from mineralization by special stains.Calculi (concretions, sialoliths): Localization in the lumen of ductules or\nducts.\n\n\nComment: Dystrophic calcification occurs in necrotic/injured tissue even in animals\nwith reference range serum calcium levels, whereas metastatic calcification occurs\nthroughout the body, in hypercalcemic animals, especially within interstitial\ntissues and blood vessel walls. Special stains like Alizarin red S and von Kossa can\nhelp identify calcium salts within tissue sections.\n\n\n Focal, lobular or diffuse.Yellow to brown pigmentation within the interstitium, acini and ducts.\n\n\n\nMineralization: Dark basophilic appearance in hematoxylin & eosin stained\nsections; Special stains like Alizarin red S and von Kossa can help identify calcium\nsalts.Artifacts: Hematoxylin stain deposits (distribution unrelated to tissue\nstructures), acid hematin (birefringent in polarized light).\n\n\nComment: The distribution of the pigment will differ dependent on its nature. For\nexample, lipofuscin may be found mainly within epithelial cells of the intralobular\nducts (Buchner and David\n1978); hemosiderin may be found within the interstitium and macrophages and\nacid hematin may be present diffusely within the section. The type of pigment can be\nidentified by special stains like Schmorl\u2019s (late lipofuscin, melanin),\nFontana-Masson (melanin), and Perl\u2019s (ferric iron-hemosiderin). Formalin-heme\npigment (acid-hematin) is observed in tissues fixed in unbuffered formalin.\nPolarization can help differentiate some pigments like lipofuscin (strong orange\nautofluorescence on unstained FFPE sections) and acid-hematin (birefringence on\nH&E sections).\n\n\nLight eosinophilic amorphous extracellular material within the tunica media of\nblood vessels, within the interstitium and basement membrane.Variable degree of atrophy and loss of intervening acini and ducts may occur, if\namyloid deposition is prominent.Green birefringence using polarized light with Congo red stain.\n\n\n\nNecrosis: loss of cellular detail, but without extracellular Congo red positive\nmaterial.Fibrinoid change (necrosis) in vessel walls: Deep eosinophilic homogenization of\nvascular media.\n\n\nComment: Amyloid and amyloid-like material has been observed in various tissues,\nincluding salivary glands of aged rodents, especially mice. Rats are much more\nresistant to develop amyloidosis than mice.\n\nThe characteristic morphologic appearance and location of amyloid in H&E\nsections that is usually adequate to make this diagnosis. Confirmation of the\ndeposits as amyloid can be accomplished with light microscopy using special stains\nsuch as Congo red. Amyloid appears apple green under polarized light with this\nstain.\n\nThe term \u201chyaline\u201d should be used in case of uncertainties about the nature of\nextracellular deposits hyaline material in H&E sections and the unavailability\nof a Congo red stain. Hyaline is also the appropriate term for homogenously\neosinophilic extracellular deposits that react negative with Congo red.\n\n\nFocal, multifocal or diffuse.Presence of mononuclear or polymorphonuclear leukocytes but without other\nhistological features of inflammation like edema, congestion or necrosis.Mild atrophy of surrounding cells may be present.Usually no acinar cell degranulation or mucus depletion.\n\n\n\nInflammation: An inflammatory cell infiltrate associated with additional\nmorphologic features of inflammation such as edema, hemorrhage, necrosis, and/or\nfibroplasia.Granulocytic leukemia: Infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal\nneutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils; infiltration of\nsimilar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs.Lymphoma: Infiltration of monomorphic population of lymphocytes (often with\natypical, increased and/or abnormal mitoses); infiltration of similar neoplastic\ncells is likely present in other organs.\n\n\nComment: In toxicity studies, inflammatory cell infiltrates are encountered more\ncommonly than inflammation (sialadenitis). The term inflammation (or sialadenitis)\nshould not be confused with or used in lieu of inflammatory cell infiltrate. The\nterm inflammatory cell infiltrate should be used rather than sialadenitis (or\ninflammation) when there is no tissue injury/reaction associated with the\ninflammatory cell infiltrate. Also, these inflammatory cell infiltrates should be\nqualified with the type of inflammatory cells that are predominant, such as\nmononuclear, lymphocyte, neutrophil, etc. The use of terminology summarizing the\nnature of the infiltrates as acute or suppurative (in lieu of neutrophilic),\ngranulomatous (in lieu of histiocytic), and chronic (in lieu of lymphocytic,\nplasmacytic, mononuclear, etc.) is not recommended since these terms may imply\ninflammation. The term inflammation (or sialadenitis) should be reserved for lesions\nwhere the inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with obvious tissue\ninjury/reaction associated with inflammation such as edema, congestion, acinar\n(parotid) cell degranulation, hemorrhage or necrosis.\n\n\nFocal, multifocal, or diffuse.Infiltrate of mononuclear or polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the gland\nparenchyma.Presence of other histological criteria of inflammation, e.g. hemorrhage, edema,\nfibroplasia\n\n\n\nInfiltrate predominantly neutrophilic; frequently accompanied by edema and\ncongestion, parotid acinar cell degranulation, acinar and ductular degeneration and\nnecrosis.\n\n\n\nInfiltrate predominantly mononuclear cell; frequently accompanied by acinar cell\natrophy and mild acinar cell degeneration, ductal proliferation, interstitial\nfibrosis; mineralization or nonkeratinizing squamous metaplasia of acini and ducts\nmay be present.\n\n\n\nInfiltrate, inflammatory cell: Other morphologic features associated with\ninflammation such as edema, hemorrhage, necrosis, and/or fibroplasias will be\nabsent.Granulocytic leukemia: Infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal\nneutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils; infiltration of\nsimilar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs.Lymphoma: Infiltration of monomorphic population of lymphocytes (often with\natypical, increased and/or abnormal mitoses); infiltration of similar neoplastic\ncells is likely present in other organs.\n\n\nComment: When a mononuclear or mixed cell infiltrate is considered to represent an\ninflammatory process (inflammation, mononuclear cell or inflammation, mixed) and\nother morphologic features (fibrosis, mineralization) associated with the infiltrate\nsuggest an ongoing/continuing inflammatory process, the modifier \u2018chronic\u2019 may be\nincluded in the diagnosis (i.e. inflammation, mononuclear cell, chronic) to better\ncharacterize the finding.\n\nInflammation, neutrophilic of the salivary glands is uncommon in toxicological\nevaluation of tissues. Infection with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and\nsialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) were once common causes of acute\nsialodacryoadenitis in mice and rats (Jacoby et al. 1975), respectively, but are now rare in barrier bred and\nmaintained colonies. MCMV predominantly affects the submandibular glands and in rare\ncases the parotid glands. SDAV has a tropism for tubuloalveolar glandular tissue of\nserous (parotid) or mucous/serous (submandibular) glands. The sublingual gland is\nspared in SDAV infections in rats. Sialadenitis may be differentiated by their\nrespective pathognomonic clinical signs and lesions. Bacterial infections due to\nKlebsiella aerogenes and Staphylococcus aureus may also cause severe acute\nnecrotizing sialadenitis as well as abscesses.\n\nSpontaneous autoimmune sialadenitis is seen in several strains of mice (NOD,\nNZB/NZW, SL/Ni, BDF females) and rats (Percy and Barthold 2007). The infiltrating\nlymphocytic population is predominantly CD4+ T cells and less than 10% cells are C8+\nT cells. Variable degree of chronic inflammation of the salivary glands may be seen\noccasionally in aged animals of other strains. Chronic infections of MCMV and SDAV\nor regenerative lesions from acute MCMV and SDAV infections may appear\nmorphologically similar to chronic inflammatory lesions (Ohyama et al. 2006). Rats treated with\nsympathomimetics like isoproterenol present with mild chronic inflammation in the\nsubmandibular salivary gland (Cohen et\nal. 1992).\n\n\nDiffuse.Increased clear spaces between acini and interstitium.Increase in total lobe volume.Rare inflammatory cell infiltrate secondary to diapedesis may be present.\n\n\n\nInflammation, neutrophil: Tissue and capillary damage accompanied by exudative\nedema, granulocytic infiltration, fibrin, congestion and hemorrhage.\n\n\nComment: Edema within the salivary glands is very uncommon. It may be exudative\n(inflammatory edema due to capillary injury secondary to leakage of enzymes) or\ntransudative (hydrodynamic derangement secondary to increased hydrostatic osmotic\npressure and decreased oncotic pressure). The diagnosis of edema should be reserved\nfor a transudative type of edema since exudative edema is usually accompanied by\nabundant inflammatory cell infiltrate and possibly tissue injury. Hence, the primary\ndiagnosis in cases of exudative edema should be inflammation, neutrophil. Chemical\ninduced salivary gland edema has been noted in mice treated with P-Nitrophenol and\nrats administered D & C Yellow No. 11 in US-NTP studies.\n\n\nPresence of erythrocytes in parenchymal or interstitial tissue or lumina of\nductules and ducts.\n\n\n\nAngiectasis: Blood present within dilated vascular lumina.Artifact: Erythrocytes on the surface of tissues as a result of necropsy\nprocedures.\n\n\n\nBasophilic or eosinophilic inspissated material within the ductular lumen.Ductular epithelium may be low to flattened cuboidal epithelium.May be accompanied by mild periductular mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate.\n\n\n\nEctasia, duct: Salivary calculi are absent.Foreign body: Foreign body within the duct is usually associated with some tissue\ndamage and elicits an inflammatory response.\n\n\nComment: A diagnosis of ductular ectasia should not be used in the presence of the\nductular calculi, even though they share other morphologic features.\n\n\nSolitary or multiple tortuous irregularly enlarged lumina that may or may not\ncontain gland-specific secretory material.Lined by flat cuboidal epithelial cells.May be accompanied by mild interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma\ncells.\n\n\n\nCalculus, ductular: Salivary calculi are present.\n\n\nComment: Usually ectasia results from blockage of inter- and intra-lobular ducts\neither proximally or distally due to rare inspissated secretory material\n(sialolithiasis), sialodacryoadenitis tumors, or foreign bodies. However, a\ndiagnosis of ectasia is used only in the absence of the calculi or the foreign body\nwithin the histologic section.\n\n\nFocal, lobular, or diffuse.Increase in the interstitial tissue due to collagen deposition and fibroblast\ncell proliferation.\n\n\n\nAmyloid: There is abundant extracellular eosinophilic amorphous ground substance\nthat exhibits apple green birefringence in Congo red stained sections under\npolarized light and there is an absence of fibroblast cell proliferation.Inflammation, mixed cell, chronic: Fibrosis associated with inflammatory cell\ninfiltrates and degenerative parenchymal changes.\n\n\nComment: Fibrosis may be minimal to marked depending on the severity and duration\nof insult. It is usually a significant component of chronic inflammation and may be\na component of healing after acute toxic insults. Mature collagen in H&E\nsections is birefringent under polarized light.\n\n\nFocal, multifocal or diffuse.Acinar structure not altered, no encapsulation, no compression.Enlarged cells with abundant cytoplasm of normal staining pattern.Large nuclei with euchromatin and prominent nucleoli.Relative reduction in the number of secretory ducts due to separation by enlarged\nacini.\n\n\n\nBasophilic hypertrophic focus (parotid gland): Discrete non-compressing foci of\nhypertrophic cells with increased basophilia within discrete non-compressing\nfoci.Hyperplasia, non-regenerative: May be associated with hypertrophy, but always\nincrease in cell number; minimal compression or distortion of architecture may be\npresent.Hyperplasia, regenerative: May be associated with hypertrophy, but always\nincrease in cell number and cytoplasmic basophilia; minimal compression or\ndistortion of architecture may be present.\n\n\nComment: Acinar hyperplasia is often associated with hypertrophy. In these cases,\nit is recommended to record hyperplasia, but not hypertrophy.\n\nHypertrophy (and hyperplasia) of the parotid and submandibular glands has been\nobserved after administration of certain drugs such as isoproterenol (Selye et al. 1961, Brenner and Stanton, 1970),\nmethoxamine and pilocarpine (Inanaga\net al. 1988), terbutaline (Sodicoff et al. 1980), methacholine, epinephrine, phenylephrine,\nreserpine, furosemide (Scarlett et\nal. 1988), alloxan (Sagstrom et al. 1987), thyroxine, and dexamethasone (Sagulin and Roomans 1989). Single or\nrepeated mandibular incisor tooth amputation also resulted in enlargement of\nsubmandibular glands, presumably due to neural regulation (Wells 1963). This enlargement was due to abundant\nintracytoplasmic accumulation of mucus along with calcium, amylase and other\nprotein.\n\nFocus, hypertrophic, basophilic (parotid gland) (Figures 182 and 183)\n\nSynonyms: Focus, basophilic; basophilic focus; basophilic hypertrophic focus;\nfocus, basophilic, hypertrophic; focus of cellular alteration;\n\nPathogenesis/cell of origin: Unknown.\n\n\nFocal, multifocal or diffuse.Discrete unencapsulated, noncompressing foci involving one or multiple acini.Enlarged cells with increased cytoplasm and occasionally enlarged nuclei.Apical regions of the acinar cells have an eosinophilic granular or fine\nvesicular cytoplasm on H&E stain.Basal regions of the acinar cells have intensely basophilic cytoplasm with large\nhyperchromatic nuclei.The enlarged cells can be diffusely basophilic in extreme cases where most of the\nparotid is affected.Pyknotic nuclei or mitoses may be observed.In diffusely affected cases, the acinar enlargement is not as prominent as seen\nin smaller focal basophilic foci.Relative reduction in the number of secretory ducts due to separation by enlarged\nacini.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia, non-regenerative OR Hyperplasia, regenerative: Increase in cell\nnumber that may or may not be associated with hypertrophy; minimal compression or\ndistortion of architecture may be present.Hypertrophy, acinar cell: Cells in single or multiple acini (foci) enlarged\nwithout increased cytoplasmic basophilia.\n\n\nComment: In untreated animals, basophilic hypertrophic foci are more common in rats\nthan in mice (Chiu and Chen\n1986). The incidence of basophilic hypertrophic foci slightly increases\nwith age. In addition, several chemicals such as doxylamine (Jackson and Blackwell 1993), triprolidine\n(Greenman et al. 1995),\nglyphosate (NTP, 1992a), methyleugenol\n(NTP, 2000), and diethanolamine (NTP, 1992b) induce basophilic hypertrophic foci\nin rodents. These foci are considered adaptive hypertrophic lesions rather than\nprecursors of neoplasia.\n\n\nFocal to multifocal scattered distribution.Usually accompanied by prior tissue injury.Presence of fully differentiated epithelial cells that are not native to the\ntissue, e.g. presence of parotid gland epithelial cells within the submandibular\ngland.\n\n\nEctopic tissue: Usually focal, circumscribed and not associated with prior tissue\ninjury.\n\nComment: Documenting prior injury and the corresponding chronic inflammation as\nwell as the multifocal nature of the lesion supports the diagnosis of metaplasia\ninstead of ectopic tissue.\n\n\nCuboidal ductular epithelium replaced by squamous epithelium.Squamous epithelial cells may be uni- or multilayered.Keratinization may be present.May be accompanied by duct hyperplasia.\n\n\n\nCarcinoma, squamous cell: Local invasion of adjacent tissue, distant metastasis,\nor marked cellular atypia.Hyperplasia: Hyperplastic cells cuboidal to columnar in shape and unilayered.Hyperplasia, atypical: Multiple layers of cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells\nwith lost polarity and increased basophilia; no horizontal flattening as in squamous\nmetaplasia.\n\n\nComment: Ductal squamous cell metaplasia is usually seen as a part of the\nregenerative response following necrosis of the ductal epithelium. In rats, a common\ncause of this lesion in parotid and submandibular glands is due to\nsialodacryoadenitis viral (SDAV) infection. The sublingual glands are reportedly\nspared from pathologic changes in SDAV infections (Jacoby 1985). However, the sublingual excretory ducts may\nhave ductal squamous metaplasia in the absence of SDAV infections. Vitamin A\ndeficient diet induced squamous metaplasia in the ducts of parotid, submandibular\nand sublingual glands in Sprague-Dawley rats (Horn et al. 1996). Squamous cell metaplasia in the\nsubmandibular gland was described in mice after treatment with DMBA and was proven\nto be of ductal segment origin by the presence of keratin proteins (Takai et al. 1986).\n\nLight and electron microscopy studies have demonstrated that the principal portion\nof salivary gland tissue undergoing squamous metaplasia is the acinar-intercalated\nduct cell complex (Dardick et al.\n1985). Though, squamous cell metaplasia of the ductular epithelium has been\nconsidered as a preneoplastic condition progressing to neoplasia (Neuenschwander and Elwell\n1990), the potential for progression of hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia\nof the ductular epithelium is unclear. These changes in the sublingual gland of\nWistar rats, often associated with inflammation/fibrosis, were not associated with\nneoplasia at that site (Van Esch et\nal. 1986). In addition, treatment-related squamous cell metaplasia of the\nsalivary gland in a chronic F344 rat study with iodinated glycerol was not\nassociated with neoplastic findings in the salivary gland after two years (NTP, 1990). Squamous cell metaplasia was induced\nwith chlorodibromomethane in F344 rats but not in B6C3F1 mice after 13-week\ntreatment, but no tumor progression was noted after 2 years treatment (Dunnick et al. 1985). On the\nother hand, transition of squamous metaplasia into squamous cell carcinoma in the\nsubmandibular gland via a non-genotoxic, proliferation-dependent mechanism was\npostulated after 2-year treatment with potassium iodide in F344 rats (Takegawa et al. 1998). In\naddition, in experiments with implanted sponge pellets containing DMBA inducing\nsquamous cell carcinomas in Sprague-Dawley rats, the authors concluded that ductal\nsegments undergoing squamous cell metaplasia may have participated in the genesis of\nneoplasia during experimental carcinogenesis (Cao et al. 2000, Sumitomo et al. 1996).\n\n\nFocal, multifocal or diffuse.Glandular architecture is preserved or only minimally altered.Minimal compression of the surrounding tissue may be present.Often rounded circumference, but maintenance of normal acinar or ductal\narchitecture.No capsule.\n\n\nAcinar:\n\n\nAcinar cells with atypia may occur.\n\n\nDuctal:\n\n\nDucts may show dilated lumina lined by flattened epithelium.\n\n\nReactive:\n\n\nAcinar or ductular proliferation with cytoplasmic basophilia; evidence of an\nunderlying process, e.g. inflammation, fibroplasias, ductal obstruction or foreign\nmaterial.\n\n\nAtypical:\n\n\nFocal or multifocal, not diffuse.Multiple layers of acinar / ductular epithelial cells.Gradual loss of cellular polarity and differentiation, cytoplasm may be\namphophilic, increased nucleus to cytoplasm ratio.\n\n\n\n Adenoma: Loss or distortion of the normal acinar/ductular structure;\nwell-demarcated and distinct compression of the surrounding tissue. Ectopic parotid gland: Foci of serous acini between mucous acini of the\nsublingual gland.Hypertrophy: Enlarged acinar cells without increase in cell number; no\ncompression, no alteration of glandular architecture.Focus, hypertrophic, basophilic: Enlarged acinar structures with increased\nbasophilia; no compression.\n\n\nComment: Hyperplastic or preneoplastic changes associated with spontaneously\noccurring neoplasms have not been identified in F344 rats (Neuenschwander and Elwell. 1990).\nSpontaneous hyperplastic and metaplastic duct epithelium was described in the\nsublingual glands of Wistar rats (Van Esch et al. 1986). Hyperplasia of the salivary ducts is a common\nfeature of many inflammatory and reactive conditions in the salivary glands of\nrodents (Greaves 2012). Multifocal\nductal cell hyperplasia was induced in the intercalated duct cells of the\nsubmandibular salivary glands of Wistar rats after chronic treatment with a\nsteroidal test article comprising prostagenic and estrogenic properties (De Rijk et al. 2003).\n\nSpontaneous hyperplastic changes of the salivary gland have not been observed in\nB6C3F1 mice (Botts et al.\n1999). Transgenic mice models were reported to show hyperplasia of the\nsubmandibular glands in serous acinar cells expressing a retinoid acid receptor\n(B\u00e9rard et al. 1994) and\nductular cells expressing simian virus 40 T antigen (Ewald et al. 1996), respectively.\n\n\nWell demarcated.Compression of the adjacent parenchyma or connective tissue.Alteration of normal acinar or ductular architecture.May be surrounded partially or completely by a thin capsule.Nuclei are hyperchromatic and basally oriented when cytoplasmic mucus\npresent.Mitotic figures are rare.Growth pattern may be acinar, tubular, papillary, solid, or mixed.\n\n\nAcinar:\n\n\nShow some signs of secretory activity. Minor areas with solid growth pattern may\nbe present; excretory ducts are usually absent.\n\n\nTubular:\n\n\nConsists of lobules or aggregates of tubules lined by squamous to cuboidal or\ncolumnar epithelium, separated by a variable amount of fibrous stroma. Some ducts\nmay have dilated lumina.\n\n\nPapillary:\n\n\nPapillary projections dominate and cystic dilatation may be present.\n\n\nSolid:\n\n\nDiffuse sheet of epithelial cells without acinar or ductular structure.\n\n\nMixed acinar/tubular:\n\n\nA mixture of acinar and tubular forms is not infrequent.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia: Acinar structure preserved or only minimally altered; no or only\nminimal compression, no capsule; in case of reactive hyperplasia evidence of an\nunderlying process, e.g. inflammation, fibroplasia, ductal obstruction or foreign\nmaterial.Hyperplasia, atypical: Focal proliferation of acinar or tubular epithelium with\nno or only minimal compression, with multiple epithelial layers and cellular atypia;\nno capsule.Adenocarcinoma: Cellular pleomorphism and cytoplasmic amphophilia; numerous\nmitotic figures, invasive growth.Tumor, mixed, benign: Consists of two proliferative cell types, one myoepithelium\nand the other glandular acinar epithelium.Adenoma of the mammary gland (anterior part): Glandular structure is not as\ncompact; staining characteristics of epithelium different.\n\n\nComment: In mice, only acinar adenomas of the salivary glands have been described,\nwhile rats may develop the different growth patterns listed as Modifiers.\n\nMultinodular acinar adenomas may be difficult to distinguish from\nwell-differentiated adenocarcinomas. Salivary gland adenomas in rats may arise from\neither acinar or ductular components (Neuenschwander and Elwell 1990). Few\nadenomas have been observed in mice and it is unclear if they arise from ducts or\nacini (Botts et al. 1999).\nTherefore it is recommended to use the modifiers acinar and tubular not in the sense\nof histogenesis but as a description of the predominant growth pattern.\n\nMice transgenic for the pleomorphic adenoma gene (PLAG1 or PLAG2) developed a high\nincidence of submandibular gland adenomas. These tumors developed pleomorphic\ncharacteristics, similar to human pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary glands. They\nwere composed of epithelial and myoepithelial structures. The epithelial component\nshowed various growth patterns, including keratinization. The spindle-shaped\nmyoepithelial cells were embedded in a myxoid stroma (Declercq et al. 2005).\n\n\nGrows in whorls or spindle pattern.Necrosis frequently present.Areas of squamous differentiation may be present.Cells are large, pleomorphic and polyhedral with amphophilic cytoplasm.Nucleus to cytoplasm ratio high.Nuclei are large vesicular and have multiple nucleoli.Mitotic figures numerous.Invasion of the surrounding tissue present.Metastasis to the lung may be present.Growth pattern may be acinar, tubular, papillary, solid, or mixed.\n\n\nAcinar:\n\n\nShow some signs of secretory activity.Minor areas with solid growth pattern may be present, excretory ducts are usually\nabsent.\n\n\nTubular:\n\n\nDifferentiation pattern variable, ranging from well-formed tubular structures to\npoorly formed tubules or nodular masses of anaplastic epithelial cells.Some ducts may have dilated lumina.\n\n\nSolid:\n\n\nDiffuse sheet of epithelial cells without acinar or ductular structure.\n\n\nMixed acinar/tubular/solid:\n\n\nMay have different patterns in one tumor: acinar, tubular and solid.\n\n\nPapillary:\n\n\nPapillary projections dominate and cystic dilatation may be present.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia: No evidence of invasion, glandular structure preserved or only\nslightly altered (acinar hyperplasia; in case of reactive hyperplasia evidence of an\nunderlying process like inflammation, fibroplasia, ductal obstruction or foreign\nmaterial.Hyperplasia, atypical: Focal proliferation of acinar or tubular epithelium with\nmultiple layers and cellular atypia; no invasion of surrounding tissue.Adenoma: Minimal cellular pleomorphism; acinar cells well differentiated with\nsecretory granules; no or only minimal pleomorphism; non-invasive; Mitotic figures\nrare.Adenocarcinoma of the mammary gland: Cytoplasmic staining differences and lipid\nvacuolation may be present.\n\n\nComment: Multinodular acinar adenomas may be difficult to distinguish from\nwell-differentiated adenocarcinomas. Spontaneous tumors of the major salivary glands\nare rare in the rat (Elwell\nand Leininger 1990; Glucksmann and Cherry 1973). Poorly differentiated carcinomas of the\nparotid gland of young Sprague-Dawley rats (Tsunenari, et al. 1997; Nishikawa et al. 2010) and papillary\ncystadenocarcinoma in the parotid gland of a F344 rat (Hosokawa et al. 2000) were reported. Induction\nof adenocarcinomas in the submandibular gland was reported after intraglandular\ninjection of DMBA in female Wistar rats (Zaman et al. 1996) and female mice (Yura et al. 1995).\n\nAdenocarcinomas have rarely been reported in mice (Botts et al. 1999). A naturally occurring\nmucoepidermoid carcinoma in the salivary gland associated with both myoepithelium\nand duct epithelium was described in two mice (Ishikawa et al. 1998).\n\nSubmandibular gland adenocarcinomas of intercalated duct origin were induced in\nSmgb-TAG mice (Dardick et al.\n2000). In these mice the oncogene SV40 T antigen is expressed from the\nneonatal submandibular gland secretory protein b (Smgb) gene promoter. Development\nof pleomorphic adenoma with malignant characteristics and lung metastasis was\ndescribed in the submandibular gland of transgenic mice with PLAG1 proto-oncogene\nover expression (Declercq et al.\n2005). Transgenic mice expressing a human Ha-ras oncogene developed\nadenosquamous carcinomas arising from the serous areas from the submandibular gland\n(Nielsen et al. 1991). In\nwap-ras transgenic mice adenocarcinomas arising from the submandibular gland were\nreported to develop spontaneously by one year of age (Nielsen et al.1995).\n\n\nWell-differentiated islands and cords with keratin formation. Variable mitotic activity.Invasion of adjacent tissues or metastasis.High grades of anaplasia may occur.Tumors may be extensively keratinized.\n\n\n\nAdenocarcinoma: Consisting of acinar, tubular, mixed, solid or papillary\ncomponents; squamous differentiation may occur, but is not predominant.Carcinoma, squamous cell (Zymbal\u2019s gland): Squamous cell carcinomas (often with a\nsebaceous component) located at the base of ear pinna should be ascribed to the\nZymbal\u2019s gland, if origin from other sites (mammary, salivary glands) is not\nevident.Adenosquamous carcinoma (mammary gland): With adenomatous component.Metaplasia, squamous cell: Lack of invasion, well differentiated with retention\nof the ductular structure.Myoepithelioma, malignant: Tumor cells with epithelioid differentiation or\npalisading around blood vessels; areas of densely packed elongated to spindeloid\ntumor cells, separated by a delicate and inactive tumor stroma.\n\n\nComment: Spontaneous squamous cell carcinomas in rodents are rare, but have been\ninduced with chemicals in rats (Neuenschwander and Elwell 1990; Sumitomo et al. 1996; Cao et al. 1999) and mice (Botts et al. 1999; Takegawa et al.1998; Takai et al. 1986), and occur\nspontaneously in mice with the v-Ha-ras oncogene (Cardiff et al. 1993). Transgenic mice expressing\na human Ha-ras oncogene developed adenosquamous carcinomas arising from the serous\nareas of the submandibular gland (Nielsen et al.1991). Also adenosquamous carcinomas of the mammary gland,\nwhich are not uncommon in mice, need to be considered as a differential diagnosis.\nSquamous cell carcinomas of the salivary glands should be distinguished from\ninvasive Zymbal\u2019s gland carcinomas with squamous differentiation by their location\nin situ (Neuenschwander\nand Elwell 1990).\n\n\nWell circumscribed.Features of both a benign mesenchymal tumor and an adenoma are present.Neoplastic epithelial structures often intermixed with neoplastic\nmyxomatous/fibrous tissue.Cellular pleomorphism is not present.No evidence of invasion.\n\n\n\nTumor, mixed, malignant: Features of both a sarcoma and a carcinoma present;\ncellular pleomorphism present.Adenoma: Lack of a neoplastic mesenchymal component.Fibroma: Lack of a neoplastic epithelial component.Fibroadenoma of the anterior mammary glands: Epithelial component with\ncytoplasmic staining characteristics of mammary gland fibroadenomas; according to\nwell-established diagnostic criteria, \u201cfibroadenomas\u201d are separately classified,\nalthough they are benign mixed tumors.\n\n\nComment: Mouse polyoma virus causes salivary gland tumors including a mixed\nepithelial-mesenchymal type (Botts et\nal. 1999; Frith and Heath\n1994; Dawe 1979).\n\n\nFeatures of both a sarcoma and a carcinoma are present.Cellular and nuclear pleomorphism.Invasion is present.\n\n\n\nTumor, mixed, benign: Features of both a benign mesenchymal tumor and an adenoma;\nno cellular pleomorphism, no local invasion.Myoepithelioma, malignant: Tumor cells with epithelioid differentiation or\npalisading around blood vessels; areas of densely packed elongated to spindeloid\ntumor cells, separated by a delicate and inactive tumor stroma.Sarcoma, not otherwise specified: Lack malignant epithelial component.Schwannoma, malignant: Lack malignant epithelial component.Adenocarcinoma, OR carcinoma, squamous cell: Lack malignant mesenchymal\ncomponent.\n\n\nComment: Mouse polyoma virus causes salivary gland tumors including a mixed\nepithelial-mesenchymal type (Botts et\nal. 1999; Frith and Heath\n1994).\n\nThe differentiation between the mixed malignant tumor and the malignant\nmyoepithelioma with epithelioid and spindeloid growth pattern may be difficult based\non hematoxylin and eosin stained slides. Confirmatory immunohistochemistry may be\nrequired which in case of the mixed tumor would demonstrate two different tissue\ncompartments that show either epithelial or mesenchymal immunophenotype, but usually\nnot a mixed one. In contrast, mixed epithelial and mesenchymal antigenic expression\nwould be demonstrated in case of the myoepithelioma.\n\n\nUnencapsulated tumor; may show invasive cords of solid tissue extending into\nadjacent structures.In larger tumors, central degeneration and necrosis may form pseudo-cysts, which\nmay be filled by brown, mucoid material or cell debris.Tumor parenchyma solid without acinar or tubular architecture.Mixed tumor morphology with confluent regions of basal, stratified squamous, and\nspindle cell patterns. May contain tubular structures. Adjacent to blood vessels,\ntumor cells may show palisading basal cell pattern or align in epithelioid\nfashion.Squamous appearance without keratinization or pearl formation may occur in some\nareas.Invasion into surrounding tissue or vessels may be present; large tumors may\nmetastasize to the lung.Infiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cells are not present (unlike polyoma virus\nneoplasms).\n\n\n\nCarcinoma, squamous cell: True epithelial differentiation without vascular\norientation; spindle shaped tumor cells in case of scirrhous or anaplastic growth\npattern only; keratinization in well differentiated tumors.Tumor mixed, malignant: Presence of true epithelial and true mesenchymal tumor\ncells.\n\n\nComment: Myoepitheliomas of the salivary glands have not been described in rats.\nThey are rare in most strains of mice but occur more often in the BALB/c, A/J, and\nC58 strains (mainly females). The most frequent locations are the parotid and\nsubmandibular glands (Frith and Ward\n1988), but they are not limited to salivary glands or the cervical region.\nNeoplastic myoepithelial cells have been reported to stain positive for cytokeratin\nand for keratins K5 and K14 and vimentin. Also PTAH staining will aid in\nconfirmation of the intracytoplasmic fibrils within the myoepithelial cells (Botts et al. 1999; Sundberg et al. 1991). They are\nnegative for smooth muscle cell alpha-actin immunohistochemistry, in contrast to\nnormal myoepithelial cells; furthermore, Sundberg et al. has suggested that the\nneoplasms arise from a subset of extraglandular ductal myoepithelial cells that are\nnegative for smooth muscle cell alpha-actin (Sundberg et al. 1991). Such confirmatory stains\nmay be required for differentiation of myoepitheliomas from scirrhous/anaplastic\nsquamous cell carcinomas or mixed malignant tumors.\n\nMyoepitheliomas in mice preferably occur in the ventral neck region (Sundberg et al. 1991). Although\nmost of these tumors have been ascribed to the salivary glands, it needs to be taken\ninto account that they may occur from any other glandular tissue, e.g. the mammary\ngland or extraorbital lacrimal gland. The frequent poor encapsulation, pleomorphic\nmorphology, and central necrosis are compatible with a malignant interpretation;\nhowever, Sundberg et al. suggested few are malignant based on stringent criteria of\nmetastasis to the lung or infiltration of underlying bone (Sundberg et al. 1991). The morphology of tumors\nwith confirmed metastases is not unique, as compared to those without, and the\nclinical appearance of the neoplasms may lead to culling prior to development of\nreadily defined metastases, so it is recommended that they should be regarded as\npotentially malignant.\n\nDuring embryonic development the pancreas is formed by fusion of its dorsal and ventral\nbuds derived from the septum transversum at the embryonic foregut/midgut junction. The\npancreas consists of both exocrine and endocrine components. The exocrine pancreas forms\nthe bulk of the pancreas and produces numerous enzymes (in proenzyme form) that aid in\ndigestion.\n\nThe pancreas of rat and mouse is classified as mesenteric type (versus compact type)\nsince discrete pancreatic tissues are diffusely distributed in the mesentery of the\nduodenal loop, transverse colon, and greater omentum adjacent to stomach and spleen. The\nlarge interlobular ducts open into a common hepatic (biliary)/pancreatic duct that enters\nthe duodenum. In addition, there are some ducts that open directly into the duodenum\n(Eustis et al. 1990; Boorman and Sills 1999).\n\nThe exocrine pancreas is classified as a compound tubuloalveolar or compound acinar\ngland. The pancreatic acinus consists of a single layer of pyramidal acinar cells arranged\nconcentrically around a lumen. The apex of the pyramidal cells facing the lumen contains\neosinophilic zymogen granules and the base of the pyramidal cells is basophilic due to\nabundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and also contains the nucleus. Each pancreatic acinus\nis surrounded by a thin basal lamina, scant reticular stroma, and pancreatic stellate\ncells (akin to the hepatic stellate cells). Located centrally within the acinus, the\ncentroacinar cells form an interface between the acinus and the intercalated duct. The\nintercalated duct continues into intralobular ducts formed by the ductular cells. The\nintralobular ducts fuse to form the interlobular ducts that finally open into the\npancreato-hepatic (biliary) duct (Eustis et\nal. 1990; Boorman and Sills\n1999).\n\nThe exocrine pancreas is physiologically and morphologically compartmentalized into peri-\nand tele-insular regions. The peri-insular acinar cells are in the immediate proximity of\nthe islets of Langerhans and are larger due to more abundant cytoplasm, larger zymogen\ngranules and larger nuclei than the tele-insular acinar cells that are farther from the\nislets. Due to differences in sizes of the peri- and tele-insular acinar cells, at lower\nmagnification, the islets of Langerhans appear to be surrounded by \u201chalos\u201d (peri-insular\nhalos) (Greaves 2012).\n\nThe histologic constituents of the pancreatic tissue such as the exocrine acini,\ncentro-acinar cells, ductal cells and the endocrine cells within the islets have a unique\nability to de-differentiate and transdifferentiate into other pancreatic histologic cell\ntypes based on the severity and type of injury, distinct transcriptional and protein\nalterations and epigenetic factors (Stanger and Hebrok 2013). As a result, tissue injury in exocrine pancreas may\nresolve by forming a histologic constituent that may be similar or different from the\ndamaged tissue type. After certain types of pancreatic tissue injury, the exocrine acini\nundergo de-differentiation and may attain a ductular morphology and in some cases even\nattain an endocrine phenotype. Notch, Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways play important\nroles in these de-differentiation and transdifferentiation pathways (Stanger and Hebrok 2013).\n\nThe pancreas is a dual function gland with both exocrine (acini) and endocrine (islets of\nLangerhans) functions.\n\nThe acinar cells store the digestive enzymes in heterogeneously composed vacuoles and the\nrelease of these enzymes occurs in a cyclic and secretagogue-specific fashion. The\nexocrine acinar secretions collect within the acinar lumen and then accumulate within the\ninterlobular ducts that subsequently drain into the duodenum via the pancreato-biliary\nduct. Hormones like gastrin (from G-cells in the stomach) and cholecystokinin (from\nI-cells in the duodenum) stimulate the exocrine pancreas to secrete inactive proenzymes\n(zymogens like trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase and carboxypeptidase) as well as\nactive enzymes such as lipase, amylase and nuclease. In addition, the duodenal hormone\nsecretin stimulates the centroacinar cells (in addition to the Brunner\u2019s glands) to\nsecrete bicarbonate ions that aid in neutralizing acidic chyme from the stomach and\nstabilizing the enzymes. The intestinal enteropeptidases activate the trypsinogen to\ntrypsin that in turn cleaves the rest of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen to their active\nforms resulting in protein digestion. Lipase and amylase aid in the digestion of lipids\nand carbohydrates, respectively (Greaves\n2012).\n\nThe exocrine pancreas has great reserve capacity and no clinical evidence of exocrine\npancreatic insufficiency is noted with up to 90% destruction of exocrine pancreas.\nExocrine pancreatic function deficits > 90% results in improper digestion of food and\nmalabsorption of nutrients (Hotz et al.\n1973).\n\nAt necropsy, the whole left lobe of the pancreas (located in the omentum close to the\nspleen) is removed for trimming. For microscopic evaluation, a large part of the left lobe\nis cut in longitudinally in the horizontal plane, making the cut surface as large as\npossible. The right lobe is removed together with the adjacent small intestine (Ruehl-Fehlert et al. 2003).\n\n\nUsually focal distribution.Fully differentiated non-pancreatic tissue in the pancreas.Usually circumscribed and not wholly integrated into the \u2018host\u2019 tissue.No evidence of dysplasia or history of tissue injury.\n\n\n\nMetaplasia: The metaplastic tissue is usually integrated into the histological\npattern of the host tissue and is usually a result of tissue reaction and\nadaptation.\n\n\nComment: Ectopic tissues are usually a rare finding in toxicity studies and care\nshould be taken to properly interpret them and not be confused with metaplasia or\nneoplasia.\n\n\nFocal, multifocal or diffuse.Moderate to total loss of zymogen granules within the affected pyramidal acinar\ncells.The cells may be swollen with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and have\nintracytoplasmic vacuoles with variably margins.The size of vacuoles may vary from small (microvesicular) to large when multiple\nsmall vacuoles coalesce together (macrovesicular) often resulting in nuclear\ndisplacement.Retained lobular architecture.Islets of Langerhans usually unaffected.\n\n\nFoamy\n\n\nHypertrophy of cells with foamy cytoplasm characterized by clear vesicles with\neosinophilic fine granules.\n\n\n\nArtifact: Medium sized clear vesicles within the cytoplasm of acinar cells,\nespecially at the periphery. No positive staining by fat stains.\n\n\nComments: Based solely on light microscopic evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin\nstained tissue sections, it is not possible to conclusively characterize the nature\nof the intracytoplasmic vacuoles. Hence, vacuolation is the preferred terminology of\nthe lesion that was previously diagnosed as fatty change, hydropic degeneration,\ncloudy swelling etc. Acinar cell vacuolation is a reversible change and is usually a\nreflection of hypoxia and metabolic insults resulting in damage to mitochondria,\nendoplasmic reticulum, protein machinery, and plasma membrane. Oil Red O and Sudan\nBlack stains on frozen sections help to identify the neutral lipids within the\nmicro/macro vesicles. It is useful to differentiate from cytoplasmic vacuoles due to\nwater accumulation (hydropic change) resulting from cell injury due to hypoxia.\nMarked vacuolation of the exocrine pancreatic acini has been documented in female\nSprague-Dawley rats exposed to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds (Yoshizawa et al. 2005).\n\nA fine cytoplasmic vacuolation, resulting from foamy appearance, may give the\nsuspicion of phospholipidosis. In such cases, the modifier \u201cfoamy\u201d should be used.\nIf the change reflects phospholipidosis, increases in size and number of lysosomes\ncan be identified by histochemistry (for alkaline phosphatase), immunostains (for\nlysosomal membrane proteins, e.g. LAMP-2) or by transmission electron microscopy.\nWith the later technique, multilamellated structures (myeloid bodies/lamellar\nbodies) are observed in the lysosomes. The term phospholipidosis should only be used\nwhen confirmation by one of these techniques has been achieved.\n\n\nMultifocal to coalescing adipocytes within the interstitium.Compression of the adjacent exocrine tissue only occasionally.Multifocal to diffuse atrophy of exocrine acini and replacement by adipose\ntissue.Islets of Langerhans unaffected.\n\n\n\nVacuolation, acinar cell: Moderate to abundant intracytoplasmic vesicles with a\nmultifocal to diffuse distribution. The exocrine acinar architecture is\nretained.\n\n\nComments: Fatty infiltration of exocrine pancreas is an uncommon lesion which may\nbe age related. The pathogenesis is not usually apparent but may be secondary to\natrophy or is the cause of atrophy.\n\n\nFocal or multifocal.Intensely pink-red cytoplasmic droplets and/or crystals in ductal cells.Cells are usually hypertrophic.Crystals, if present, may be intracellular or extracellular.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComments: Aged mice of the C57BL/6, 129 and B6,129 strains develop a high incidence\nof eosinophilic globules in various epithelia, including glandular stomach,\nrespiratory tract, bile duct, gall bladder and pancreatic duct (Ward et al. 2001). The protein\nisolated from the characteristic eosinophilic lesions has been identified as Ym1/Ym2\na member of the chitinase family that may be produced in response to mucosal\nirritation (Ward et al. 2001;\nRogers and Houghton\n2009). The use of the term hyalinosis for this lesion will potentially\ncause confusion in safety assessment as the same term may also be used for a\ndistinctly different clinical disorder in humans and can be used to describe\nvascular and renal glomerular changes.\n\n\nMultifocal.Retained lobular architecture.Intracytoplasmic hypereosinophilic to basophilic globules surrounded by a thin\nclear halo.\n\n\n\nApoptosis: Apoptotic bodies also have a hypereosinophilic cytoplasm and are\nsurrounded by a clear halo but they always contain basophilic condensed nuclear\nfragments. Apoptosis may be differentiated from autophagy by using TUNEL staining\nthat marks the nuclear fragments (Zhang et al. 2014).Vacuolation, acinar cell: Swollen cells with intracytoplasmic vacuoles with no\nintraluminal contentsArtifact: Medium sized clear vesicles within the cytoplasm of acinar cells,\nespecially at the periphery. No positive staining by fat stains.Foam cells (Phospholipidosis): The cells have foamy cytoplasm characterized by\nclear vesicles with eosinophilic fine granules. Ultrastructurally, it consists of\nlarge lysosomal inclusions composed of densely packed concentric membranes with a\nfingerprint pattern.\n\n\nComments: Autophagy is a homeostatic mechanism that plays a major role in the\ncatabolism by lysosomal digestion of organelles and/or aged cytoplasmic contents.\nAutophagy occurs at basal levels in all tissues to maintain cellular homeostasis.\nHowever, it is rapidly increased during energy depletion, hypoxia, endoplasmic\nreticulum stress, high temperature, hormonal stimulation, or cellular remodeling to\ncombat oxidative stress. Alterations in autophagy may lead to disruption of cellular\nhomeostasis and can result in pancreatitis and cell death (Helin et al. 1980; Gukovskaya and Gukovsky 2012). Increased\nautophagic vacuoles in a treated group should always be considered in the context of\nthe control group.\n\nAutophagy and apoptosis are not necessarily mutually exclusive entities. There is\nevidence that apoptosis can occur simultaneously with autophagy (Maiuri et al. 2007).\n\nThe exocrine acini are very sensitive to agents affecting autophagic flux such as\nvinblastine (enhances autophagic segregation) or cycloheximide (regression of the\nautophagic compartment). Autophagy may be detected by electron microscopy, by the\nfluorescent localization pattern of LC3 puncta (intracytoplasmic granular\nfluorescent material) or by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against LC3-II\n(processed LC3). The autophagosomes within the cytoplasm, under light microscopy,\nappear as discrete vacuoles with some dark eosinophilic or amphophilic contents and\nunder electron microscopy, remnants of mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum may be\nobserved. It is important to note that accumulation of autophagosomes is not always\nindicative of autophagy induction since it could be the result of blockage of\nautophagosomal maturation or increased generation of autophagosomes. Autophagic flux\nassays may measure LC3 turnover, levels of autophagic substrates, mRFP-GFP-LC3 color\nchange, free GFP generated from GFP-LC3, and lysosome-dependent long-lived protein\ndegradation (Iovanna and\nVaccaro 2010).\n\n\nSingle cells or small clusters of cells.Cell shrinkage.Hypereosinophilic cytoplasm.Nuclear shrinkage, pyknosis, karyorrhexis. Intact cell membrane.Apoptotic bodies.Cytoplasm retained in apoptotic bodies.Phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies tissue macrophages or other adjacent cells.No inflammation.\n\n\n\nNecrosis: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic\ndiagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.).Apoptosis/necrosis: Both types of cell death are present and there is no\nrequirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for\nstatistical reasons. The term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be\ndetermined unequivocally.\n\n\nComment: The approach for the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of cell death\napplied here is based on a draft recommendation of the INHAND Cell Death\nNomenclature Working Group.\n\nApoptosis is not synonymous with necrosis. The main morphological differences\nbetween these two types of cell death are cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation\nand tingible body macrophages in apoptosis versus cell swelling, rupture and\ninflammation in necrosis; however, other morphologies (e.g. nucelar pyknosis and\nkaryorrhexis) overlap. In routine H&E sections where the morphology clearly\nrepresents apoptosis or single cell necrosis, or whereby special procedures (e.g.\nTEM or IHC for caspases) prove one or the other, individual diagnoses may be used.\nHowever, because of the overlapping morphologies, necrosis and apoptosis are not\nalways readily distinguishable via routine examination, and the two processes may\noccur sequentially and/or simultaneously depending on intensity and duration of the\nnoxious agent (Zeiss 2003). This often\nmakes it difficult and impractical to differentiate between both during routine\nlight microscopic examination. Therefore, the complex term apoptosis/necrosis may be\nused in routine toxicity studies.\n\nA differentiation between apoptosis and single cell necrosis may be required in the\ncontext of a given study, in particular if it aims for mechanistic investigations.\nTransmission electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to\nconfirm apoptosis. Other confirmatory techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to\nperform but insensitive), TUNEL (false positives from necrotic cells) or\nimmunohistochemistry for caspases, in particular caspase 3. These techniques are\nreviewed in detail by Elmore (Elmore\n2007). Some of these confirmatory techniques detect early phases of\napoptosis, in contrast to the evaluation of H&E stained sections, which detects\nlate phases only; overall interpretation of findings should take into account these\npotential differences. Thus, low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by\nevaluation of H&E stained slides only.\n\nCertain studies may require the consideration of forms of programmed cell death\nother than apoptosis which requires specific confirmatory techniques (Galluzzi et al. 2012).\n\nAcinar cell apoptosis is classically manifested in many cases of xenobiotic-induced\ninjury. It is considered a \u201cpreferred\u201d response to injury, as it does not lead to\nsubsequent inflammation. An inverse relationship between apoptosis and necrosis in\nacinar cell injury has been described for various experimental models. Stimulation\nof apoptosis seems to protect against acute necrotizing reactions, while inhibition\nof apoptosis leads to necrosis and acute inflammation (Wallig and Sullivan 2013).\n\nExocrine pancreatic acinar apoptosis is observed in rodents treated with synthetic\ncholecystokinin analog caerulein (Reid and Walker 1999), ethionine (Fitzgerald and Alvizouri 1952; Walker et al. 1993), physical\nblockage of the pancreas by ductal ligation (Abe and Watanabe 1995; Doi et al. 1997), duct obstruction involution\nfollowing soy flour-induced hyperplasia (Oates et al. 1986) and zinc toxicants (Kazacos and van Vleet\n1989), copper-deficient diet supplemented with a copper-chelating agent\n(Rao et al. 1993), Azaserine\n(Woutersen 1996),\nlipopolysaccharide (Laine et al.\n1996) and pan CDK inhibitor (Ramiro-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al. 2005). In addition,\nexocrine pancreatic apoptosis is also observed in some genetically modified mice\nsuch as Serpini2-deficient mouse model for pancreatic insufficiency (Loftus et al. 2005). Non-treatment\nassociated sporadic apoptosis may be noted in pancreas from rodents and this is part\nof the normal tissue homeostasis and is considered as a background change. Acinar\ncell apoptosis may be increased in fasted or chronically anorectic animals. The\ndegree of apoptosis is in these cases lower than that of acute pancreatic\ninjury.\n\n\nFocal affecting cell groups, lobular, diffuse.Cells swollen with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm.Loss of nuclear basophilia, pyknosis and/or karyorrhexis that affects aggregates\nof cells.In more severe cases, there may be detachment of the epithelium from the\nsubmucosa.Typically, the presence of degenerative cells is a component of necrosis.Minimal or slight inflammatory cell infiltrates, edema and fibrin may be present\nas a feature of necrosis.\n\n\nSingle cell\n\n\nOnly single cells affected.\n\n\n\nApoptosis: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis\n(cell and nucleus shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear pyknosis etc.)\nand/or special techniques demonstrate apoptosis.Apoptosis/necrosis: Both types of cell death are present and there is no\nrequirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for\nstatistical reasons. The term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be\ndetermined unequivocally.Inflammation, acute: Infiltrates of inflammatory cells, edema, and fibrin\npredominate; necrosis may be present, but is a minor component.\n\n\nComments: Necrosis is usually accompanied by an inflammatory cell infiltrate and\nmay be a significant component of acute inflammation. Usually, either necrosis or\nacute inflammation will be recorded. However, in the context of a specific study it\nmay be more appropriate to record both processes separately.\n\nIn the pancreas, dead cells quickly pass through the stage of coagulation necrosis\nto liquefaction because of the high content of hydrolytic enzymes activated and\nreleased into the interstitial tissue. Necrosis of acinar tissue develops very\nrapidly and is best recognized within 12\u201348 hours after the insult (Wallig and Sullivan\n2013).\n\n\nBoth types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them\nseparately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons ORThe type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally.\n\n\n\nApoptosis: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis\n(cell and nucleus shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear pyknosis etc.)\nand/or special techniques demonstrate apoptosis and there is a requirement for\nrecording apoptosis and necrosis separately.Necrosis: The morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic\ndiagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.) and there is a\nrequirement for recording apoptosis and necrosis separately.\n\n\nComments: Necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine\nexamination, and the two processes may occur sequentially and/or simultaneously\ndepending on intensity and duration of the noxious agent (Zeiss 2003). This often makes it difficult and impractical\nto differentiate between both during routine light microscopic examination. In these\ncases, the combined term apoptosis/necrosis may be used. It is recommended to\nexplain in detail the use of this combined term in the narrative part of the\npathology report.\n\n\nFocal, lobular, or diffuse lesion.Reduced acinar diameter.Partial or complete loss of acinar cell zymogen granules leading to a reduced\ncell size and increased basophilia.Nuclei of acinar cells inactiveLack of fibrosis or adipocyte infiltration.Islets of Langerhans are unaffected.\n\n\n\nAtrophy, acinar cell: Loss of acinar cell basophilia and decreased zymogen\ngranules resulting in small acini lined by small columnar cells almost completely\ndevoid of cytoplasm and with a small and inactive nucleus; may be accompanied by\nfibrosis and minimal mononuclear cell infiltrates.Focus, basophilic: Basophilic cells of normal size and commonly slightly\nenlarged; nulcei slightly enlarged and with prominent nucleoli.Peri-insular halos: Tele-insular acinar cells have relatively less zymogen\ngranules when compared to peri-insular acinar cells.\n\n\nComment: The morphology of the exocrine pancreatic acini may be altered due to\nseveral physiological conditions, such as anorexia/inanition. The volume of the\nzymogen granules and RER is reciprocally related. During protein synthesis, RER is\nincreased with a proportionate decrease in zymogen granules. In moribund and/or\nanorexic animals with protein deficiency, the zymogen granules are decreased and the\ncells are shrunken with apparently increased basophilia due to relative predominance\nof the basally located basophilic cytoplasm (Longnecker and Wilson 2002).\n\n\nFocal, lobular, or diffuse.Reduction in the number and/or size of acini.Loss of acinar cell basophilia and decreased zymogen granules resulting in small\nacini lined by small columnar cells almost completely devoid of cytoplasm and with a\nsmall and inactive nucleus.Relatively prominent intra and inter-lobular ducts.Pyknotic and karyorrhectic nuclei, apoptotic bodies, and mitotic figures may be\npresent.Scattered to coalescing adipocytes within the interstitium.Variable degree of interstitial fibrosis.Variably dilated cyst-like or duct-like acini and/or ducts lined by cuboidal or\nflattened epithelial cells.Transitional structures containing mixtures of normal acinar cells, atrophic\nacinar cells, and cuboidal ductal cells.May be accompanied by minimal to mild infiltration of lymphocytes or\nmacrophages.Islets of Langerhans are unaffected.\n\n\n\nDegranulation, Acinar cell: Diffuse reduction of zymogen granules but maintenance\nof the basophilic basal cytoplasm; no fibrosis or adipocyte infiltration.Peri-insular halos: Tele-insular acinar cells have relatively less zymogen\ngranules and more RER when compared to peri-insular acinar cells. In certain planes\nof section, areas with more tele-insular regions may give a false impression of\natrophy.Inflammation, chronic: Infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells and\ninterstitial fibrosis are frequently accompanied by acinar cell atrophy of variable\ndegree.\n\n\nComment: Exocrine acinar atrophy is the most common spontaneous degenerative change\nin pancreas of both rats and mice. Acinar atrophy may range from focal atrophic\nexocrine acini with no inflammation or fibrosis to diffuse atrophy of exocrine acini\nwith replacement by adipose tissue and residual ducts, vasculature and islets of\nLangerhans. Acinar atrophy frequently represents the sequel of chronic inflammation\nand, as such, is often accompanied by infiltrates of mononuclear cells and fibrosis.\nIt is recommended to record in standard toxicity studies for such lesions either\natrophy or chronic inflammation, but not both. Inflammation, chronic, should be\nrecorded only, if the inflammatory changes are the predominant component. In rats,\nthe acinar atrophy increases with age and the incidence varies with sex (males >\nfemales) and strain (BN/Bi/WAG/Rij(F1) > Crl:CD(SD)BR = BN/Bi > Slc:Wistar\n> Hap:(SD) > F344 > Osborne-Mendel). In B6C3F1 mice, the incidence of\nspontaneous exocrine pancreatic atrophy is 1\u20132% in 2-year studies (Boorman and Sills 1999). In\nrats, chronic protein or essential amino acid deficiency, copper deficiency, zinc\ndeficiency, ethionine, hypophysectomy or high doses of glucagon induce loss of\nzymogen granules and pancreatic atrophy (Svoboda et al. 1966; Kitagawa and Ono 1986; Rao et al. 1987; Koo and Turk 1977). Malonaldehyde caused atrophy of\nexocrine pancreas in both male and female mice (NTP, 1988). Acinar atrophy has also been induced by pancreatic duct\nligation (Watanabe et al.\n1995; Eustis et al.\n1990).\n\n\nFocal, lobular, or diffuse.Deposits of dark basophilic granular material (on H&E) within exocrine acini,\nducts or interstitium.\n\n\n\nArtifacts: Hematoxylin stain deposits (distribution unrelated to tissue\nstructures), acid hematin (use of unbuffered formalin; dark brown to black, tropism\nfor erythrocytes).Pigment: Lipofuscin and porphyrin appear brown to golden brown in H&E slides\nand may further be differentiated from mineralization by special stains.\n\n\nComment: Dystrophic calcification occurs in necrotic/injured tissue even in animals\nwith reference range serum calcium levels, whereas metastatic calcification occurs\nin hypercalcemic animals throughout the body, especially within interstitial tissues\nand blood vessel walls. The two commonly used stains for detecting calcium are\nAlizarin red and von Kossa.\n\n\nLight eosinophilic homogenous amorphous extracellular material within the tunica\nmedia of blood vessels, within the interstitium and along basement membranes.Variable degree of atrophy and loss of intervening acini and ducts may occur, if\namyloid deposition is prominent.Green birefringence using polarized light with Congo red stain.\n\n\n\nNecrosis: Loss of cellular detail and no extracellular material deposits, Congo\nred negative.Fibrinoid change (necrosis) in vessel walls: Deep eosinophilic homogenization of\nvascular media.\n\n\nComment: Amyloid and amyloid-like material have been observed in various tissues of\naged rodents, especially mice. Rats are much more resistant to develop amyloidosis\nthan mice.\n\nThe characteristic morphologic appearance and location of amyloid in H&E\nsections that is usually adequate to make this diagnosis. Confirmation of the\ndeposits as amyloid can be accomplished with light microscopy using special stains\nsuch as Congo red. Amyloid appears apple green under polarized light with this\nstain.\n\nThe term \u201chyaline\u201d should be used in case of uncertainties about the nature of\nextracellular deposits hyaline material in H&E sections and the unavailability\nof a Congo red stain. Hyaline is also the appropriate term for homogenously\neosinophilic extracellular deposits that react negative with Congo red.\n\n\nFocal, lobular, diffuse.Yellow to brown pigmentation within the interstitium, acini and ducts.\n\n\n\nMineralization: Dark basophilic appearance in H&E stained sections; special\nstains like Alizarin red S and von Kossa can help identify calcium salts.Artifacts: Hematoxylin stain deposits (distribution unrelated to tissue\nstructures), acid hematin (use of unbuffered formalin; dark brown to black, tropism\nfor erythrocytes).\n\n\nComment: In the rat, hemosiderin may be seen in neighboring islets of Langerhans\nwhere hemorrhage may have occurred previously (Imaoka et al. 2007).\n\nThe type of pigment can be identified by special stains, such as Schmorl\u2019s (mature\nlipofuscin, melanin, bile), Fontana-Masson\u2019s (melanin), Perl\u2019s (Ferric\nIron-hemosiderin) and Hall\u2019s (bilirubin) stains. Formalin-heme pigment\n(acid-hematin) is observed in tissues fixed in unbuffered formalin. Polarization can\nhelp differentiate some pigments like lipofuscin (strong orange autofluorescence on\nunstained FFPE sections), porphyrin (bright red with a centrally located dark\nMaltese cross) and acid-hematin (birefringence on H&E sections).\n\n\nFocal, multifocal or diffuse.Presence of mononuclear or polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no other histological\ncriteria of inflammation like edema, congestion or necrosis.Usually no acinar cell degranulation.\n\n\n\nInflammation: The inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with additional\nmorphological features of inflammation such as edema, hemorrhage, necrosis, and/or\nfibroplasia.Granulocytic leukemia: Infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal\nneutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils; infiltration of\nsimilar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs.Lymphoma: Infiltration of monomorphic population of lymphocytes (often with\natypical, increased and/or abnormal mitoses); infiltration of similar neoplastic\ncells is likely present in other organs.\n\n\nComment: In toxicity studies, inflammatory cell infiltrates are encountered more\ncommonly than inflammation (pancreatitis). The term pancreatitis (or inflammation)\nshould not be confused with or used in lieu of infiltrate (plus cell type). The term\ninfiltrate (plus cell type) should be used instead of inflammation (or pancreatitis)\nwhen there is no tissue injury/reaction associated with the inflammatory cell\ninfiltrate. Also, the inflammatory cell infiltrate should be qualified with the type\n(name) of the cells that are predominant, such as lymphocytic, neutrophilic, etc.\nThe use of terminology summarizing the nature of the infiltrates as suppurative (in\nlieu of neutrophilic), granulomatous (in lieu of macrophage), and chronic (in lieu\nof lymphocytic, plasmacytic, mononuclear) is not recommended since these terms imply\ninflammation. The term inflammation (pancreatitis) should be reserved for lesions\nwhere the inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with tissue injury/reaction\nsuch as edema, congestion, acinar cell degranulation, necrosis, vascular fibrinoid\nnecrosis, hemorrhage, fat necrosis or saponification (Mann et al. 2012).\n\n\nFocally extensive or diffuse, involving predominantly the interstitium, but also\nacinar cells and intra- or inter-lobular ducts.Infiltrate of mononuclear or polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the gland\nparenchyma.Presence of other histological criteria of inflammation, e.g. hemorrhage, edema,\nfibroplasias.Islets of Langerhans may be entrapped within the inflammation.\n\n\n\nInfiltrate predominantly neutrophilic; frequently accompanied by edema and\ncongestion; acinar cell degranulation and necrosis, fibrinoid necrosis of small\nvessels and hemorrhage as well as fat necrosis and saponification may be\npresent.\n\n\n\nInfiltrate predominantly mononuclear cell; frequently accompanied by acinar cell\natrophy and mild acinar cell degeneration, ductal proliferation, interstitial\nfibrosis; mineralization of acini may be present.\n\n\n\nInfiltrate, inflammatory cell: Other histologic features of inflammation such as\nedema, hemorrhage, necrosis, and/or fibroplasias will be absent.Granulocytic leukemia: Infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal\nneutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils; infiltration of\nsimilar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs.Lymphoma: Infiltration of monomorphic population of lymphocytes (often with\natypical, increased and/or abnormal mitoses); infiltration of similar neoplastic\ncells is likely present in other organs.Postmortem autolysis: uniform and often diffuse change in acinar cells starting\nwith loss of basophilia, gradual loss of definition and final lysis; no inflammatory\ncell infiltration, congestion or edema.Atrophic, acinar cell: Minimal to mild infiltrates of mononuclear cells and\nfibrosis, but atrophy is the predominant component.\n\n\nComment: When a mononuclear cell or mixed infiltrate is considered to represent an\ninflammatory process (inflammation, mononuclear cell or inflammation, mixed) and\nother morphologic features (acinar cell atrophy and mild acinar cell degeneration,\nductal proliferation, interstitial fibrosis; mineralization of acini) associated\nwith the infiltrate suggest an ongoing/continuing inflammatory process, the modifier\n\u2018chronic\u2019 may be included in the diagnosis (i.e. inflammation, mononuclear cell,\nchronic) to better characterize the finding.\n\nSpontaneous inflammation, neutrophilic or mixed of the pancreas is very uncommon in\ncontrol mice and rats. The severity of inflammation within pancreas can range from\nmild edematous inflammation to severe necrotizing inflammation. Acute inflammation\nis observed in humans and some rodents treated with several classes of drugs\nbelonging to antimicrobials, estrogens, corticosteroids, diuretics, antibiotics,\nanalgesics/anti-inflammatory agents, statins, ACE inhibitors, and Highly Active\nAntiretroviral Therapy (HAART) drugs (Badalov et al. 2007). Several animal models are\nused for studying pancreatitis such as choline-deficient ethionine supplemented\ndiet; intraperitoneal injection of arginine; intraperitoneal or intravenous\nadministration of secretogogues such as cholecystokinin analogue (caerulein),\nmuscarinic receptor agonist (carbachol), anticholinesterases (organophosphate);\nsepsis (LPS); vascular compromise (hypovolemic shock, occlusion of pancreatoduodenal\nartery, occlusion of splenic and/or gastroduodenal vein occlusion); closed duodenal\nloop procedure; and obstruction of pancreatic duct or common biliopancreatic duct\n(Chan and Leung 2007).\nAcute pancreatitis and necrosis are also seen in cases of zinc toxicity, copper\ndeficiency and extension of inflammation from other lesions such as gastritis\nsecondary to oral gavage of irritating chemicals (Boorman and Sills 1999; Greaves 2012).\n\nSpontaneous chronic inflammation is sporadically found in aged rats and mice.\nChronic inflammation occurs more commonly in diabetic (BB) Wistar rats than their\nnon-diabetic counterparts (Wright et\nal. 1983). Chronic exposure to manganese causes chronic pancreatitis,\nfibrosis and acinar atrophy in rats (Scheuhammer 1983). In many cases, chronic inflammation progresses into\npancreatic atrophy and subsequent multifocal to diffuse fatty infiltration. Acinar\natrophy frequently represents the sequel of chronic inflammation and, as such, is\noften accompanied by infiltrates of mononuclear cells and fibrosis. It is\nrecommended to record in standard toxicity studies for such lesions the predominant\nmorphology, either atrophy or chronic inflammation, not both. Inflammation, chronic,\nshould be recorded only, if the inflammatory changes are the predominant\ncomponent.\n\n\nTypically affects muscular wall of small to medium sized arteries or veins.Variable mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate within and around vessel.Possible presence of fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall.Proliferation of endothelium and thickening (fibrosis) of vessel wall.\n\n\n\nInflammation, acute: Inflammatory processes predominantly within the parenchyma;\nvascular involvement only secondary and representing a minor proportion of the\ninflammatory process.Infiltrate, inflammatory cell: Lack of vascular orientation, no other features of\ninflammation such as hemorrhage or fibrinoid necrosis.\n\n\nComment: Inflammation of the vasculature, if present, is frequently noted in\nhistological sections of pancreas due to the prominent pancreato-duodenal artery and\nother small caliber interlobular pancreatic arteries, and mesenteric vessels in the\nvicinity. Arteritis lesions may be due to immune-mediated etiology as seen in\n(NZBXNZW)F1 hybrid, and MRL/Mp mice or due to hypertension as seen in spontaneously\nhypertensive rat (SHR) strains. Arteritis due to drug/chemical treatment is\noccasionally observed and may depend on the species, strain and sex. Examples\ninclude vasoactive agents like angiotensin, norepinephrine, dopamine agonists (like\nfenoldopam mesylate) and xanthine compounds which cause focal to diffuse medial\nnecrosis and hemorrhage especially within the small and medium-caliber mesenteric,\npancreatic and renal arteries; and non-vasoactive compounds like\n2-amino-5-nitrophenol, nitrofurantoin, or phenacetin.\n\n\nFocally extensive or diffuse.Distension of the interstitial tissue forming clear spaces or spaces filled with\nlightly eosinophilic material.Minimal inflammatory cell infiltrate may be present in some cases.Increase in total pancreatic volume and weight.\n\n\n\nInflammation, acute: Usually associated with tissue and vascular damage resulting\nin exudative edema and inflammatory cell infiltrate.\n\n\nComment: Edema within the exocrine pancreas may be exudative (inflammatory edema\ndue to capillary injury secondary to leakage of pancreatic enzymes) or transudative\n(hydrodynamic derangement secondary to increased hydrostatic osmotic pressure and\ndecreased oncotic pressure). The exudative edema is usually accompanied by\ninflammatory cell infiltrate and tissue injury. Examples of chemical induced\npancreatic edema have been documented in mice treated with p-nitrophenol and rats\ntreated with D & C Yellow No. 11 and PCB mixtures in US-NTP studies.\n\n\nPresence of erythrocytes in interstitial tissue, acini, ductules, or ducts.\n\n\n\nAngiectasis: Blood present within dilated vascular lumina.Artifact: Erythrocytes on the surface of the pancreas sample or infiltrating from\nthe surface into interstitial tissue; a result of necropsy procedure.\n\n\nComment: Islet hemorrhage has been described as a spontaneous finding in\nSprague-Dawley rats (Imaoka et. al.\n2007). If prominent, this may involve peri-insular exocrine tissue.\n\n\nUsually diffuse distribution.Enlarged acinar cells with more abundant cytoplasmic volume and more numerous\nzymogen granules.No increase in the number of cells per acinus.Larger nuclei with prominent nucleoli.Increase in pancreas to body weight ratios.\n\n\n\nHalos, peri-insular, increased: characteristic distribution pattern; exocrine\nacini (peri-insular) surrounding the islets of Langerhans have more zymogen granules\nand slightly larger nuclei than their distal (tele-insular) counterparts.Hyperplasia, acinar cell: Increased number of cells per acinus.\n\n\nComment: Exocrine pancreatic acinar hypertrophy results from dietary and trophic\nfactors. Feeding rats with raw but not heat-treated soy flour (lack trypsin\ninhibitors) caused acinar hypertrophy initially. However, with continued feeding,\nthe hypertrophic change progressed to hyperplasia with marked increase in DNA\ncontent. This hypertrophic change is attributed to the presence of trypsin\ninhibitors within the raw soy flour and its ability to stimulate the secretion of\ncholecystokinin by feed back mechanism (Crass and Morgan 1982; Folsch et al. 1978). Similarly, administration of\ngastrin (but not secretin analogues) like pentagastrin, pancreozymin, and peptavlon\nalso caused pancreatic acinar cell hypertrophy (Rothman, and Wells 1967). Administration of\nisoprenaline (isoproterenol) also cased an increase in pancreatic weight due to\nacinar cell hypertrophy and increase in zymogen granules (Sturgess and Reid 1973). However, pancreas\nweight and pancreas to body weight ratios are not commonly recorded or calculated in\ntoxicity studies.\n\n\nHypertrophy of exocrine pancreatic acini surrounding the islets of\nLangerhans.Acinar cells with more abundant cytoplasmic volume with larger zymogen granules\nthan tele-insular acinar cells (located distantly from the islets).Larger nuclei with more nucleoli than tele-insular acinar cells.\n\n\n\nHypertrophy, acinar cell: No local association with islets, usually multifocal to\ndiffuse distribution.\n\n\nComment: The difference in the size of peri- and tele-insular acinar cells is\ngreater in mice than in rats, resulting in more prominent peri-insular halos in\nmice. The peri-insular acinar cells are more resistant (3 hours) to\npilocarpine-induced degranulation than the tele-insular acinar cells (1 hour). The\nsize of peri-insular halos is markedly reduced in alloxan-induced diabetic pancreata\ncompared to control non-diabetic rats. These features of the peri-insular halos are\ndue to the hormones (mainly ghrelin and insulin) secreted by the beta-cells in\nislets of Langerhans that are locally enriched due to the insulo-acinar capillary\nanastomoses or due to diffusion. The peri-insular halos are not recorded in routine\ntoxicity studies but recording any alterations within these halos may provide\nimportant information about chemicals affecting islet cells such as alloxan or about\nchemicals directly affecting the exocrine pancreas like pilocarpine.\n\n\nDecreased zymogen granules within exocrine pancreatic acini surrounding the\nislets of Langerhans.Loss of size distinction between the peri-insular acini located adjacent to the\nislets of Langerhans (usually larger) and the tele-insular acini located distantly\nfrom the islets (usually smaller than peri-insular acini)\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\nComment: The difference in the size of peri- and tele-insular acinar cells is\ngreater in mice than in rats, resulting in more prominent peri-insular halos in\nmice. The peri-insular acinar cells are more resistant (3 hours) to\npilocarpine-induced degranulation than the tele-insular acinar cells (1 hour). The\nsize of peri-insular halos is markedly reduced in alloxan-induced diabetic pancreata\ncompared to control non-diabetic rats. These features of the peri-insular halos are\ndue to the hormones (mainly insulin) secreted by the \u03b2-cells in islets of Langerhans\nthat are locally enriched due to the insulo-acinar capillary anastomoses or due to\ndiffusion. The peri-insular halos are not recorded in routine toxicity studies but\nrecording any alterations within these halos may provide important information about\nchemicals affecting islet cells such as alloxan or about chemicals directly\naffecting the exocrine pancreas like pilocarpine.\n\n\nTinctorially distinct focus with decreased zymogen granules and increased\nbasophilia due to abundance of RER.Affects single or multiple contiguous acini with oval to irregular shape without\nencapsulation and with retained angular shape of the pancreatic lobe.No compression or displacement of adjacent pancreatic aciniCellular hypertrophy is commonly seen.Slightly enlarged basal to parabasal nuclei with prominent nucleoli.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia, acinar cell, focal: Increased number of cells per acinus, usually no\nincrease of cytoplasmic basophilia.Zymogen granules decreased, acinar cell: Reduced cell size due to loss of zymogen\ngranules, nuclei inactive,\n\n\nComment: The incidence of basophilic foci is 6.6% in control and 5.4% in corn oil\ngavage historical control male F344 rats in the NTP database (Eustis et al. 1990). Basophilic foci occur also in\nmice, but at a much lower incidence than in rats (Roebuck et al. 1980). There is an increase in the\nincidence of basophilic foci in rats treated with 4-hydroxyaminoquinoline-1-oxide\n(4HAQO), 7,12-dimethyl-benzanthracene (DMBA),\nN5-(N-methyl-N-nitrosocarbamoyl)-L-ornithine (MNCO), raw soy bean flour, plant\ntrypsin inhibitors, and azaserine. The proliferative ability of exocrine acinar\ncytological alterations as measured by tritiated thymidine autoradiography and\nmitotic index indicated that basophilic foci have similar proliferative ability as\nthe surrounding normal exocrine acini (Rao et al. 1989). Thus, unlike focal hyperplasia, the basophilic foci\nshould not be considered as preneoplastic (Scarpelli et al. 1984). The cytologic\nappearance of acinar cells within the basophilic foci may indicate an altered\ncapacity for, or a defect in, the synthesis of secretory proteins. Basophilic foci\nstained positively with gamma-glutamyltranspetidase (GGT) while eosinophilic foci\nstained negatively. A microscopic morphological entity described as spontaneous\npancreatic acinar hypertrophic foci in rats by Chiu (Chiu 1983) may indeed be basophilic foci because they share\nseveral features such as increased incidence with age, and they are non-hyperplastic\nand non-neoplastic.\n\n\nPolygonal cells with central nuclei and abundant finely granular eosinophilic\ncytoplasm (morphologically identical to hepatocytes).Located adjacent to ducts and islets of Langerhans.Usually well integrated into surrounding tissue.Hepatocytes have well developed bile canaliculi\n\n\n\nHypertrophy, acinar cell: Pancreatic exocrine acini; focal to lobar\ndistribution.Halos, peri-insular: pancreatic exocrine acini; almost always surrounding\nislets.Ectopic liver tissue: Usually circumscribed and not wholly integrated into the\n\u2018host\u2019 tissue; no evidence of dysplasia or history of tissue injury.\n\n\nComment: The incidence of metaplastic hepatic foci is less than 1% in control rats\nand mice. These lesions are occasionally observed in the rat pancreas and less\nfrequently in the mouse pancreas. The pathogenesis of these sporadic lesions is not\nknown. Experimentally, these metaplastic hepatic foci within the rat exocrine\npancreas may be induced by several protocols such as copper depletion followed by\ncopper repletion (s), ciprofibrate feed model (Reddy et al. 1984), and multiple subcutaneous\ninjections of cadmium chloride (Konishi et al. 1990). Metaplastic hepatic foci in the pancreas were also\ninduced in a transgenic mouse model where KGF (FGF7) was over-expressed in the\npancreas under the control of the rat insulin promoter (Krakowski et al. 1999). An increase in\nmetaplastic hepatic foci in toxicological studies may also be due to the result of\ntest article-induced pancreatic atrophy and subsequent hepatic\ntransdifferentiation.\n\n\nFocal, circumscribed lesions surrounded by normal exocrine acini.Variable caliber ductules lined by flat cuboidal epithelial cells.Located in the acinar compartment rather than in the native ducts.Intermixed with pale atrophic exocrine acini.Islets not usually involved.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia, Ductular: do not have intermixed pale exocrine acini.Atrophy, acinar cell: ductular metaplasia may a component in some cases of\natrophy and is considered a reparative process.\n\n\nComment: Exocrine acinar ductular metaplasia is usually secondary to chronic\npancreatitis and atrophy and is considered a reparative process. The diagnosis of\nductular metaplasia is not commonly used in toxicologic studies since it is one of\nthe features of atrophy. In DMBA implantation studies in rats that resulted in\npancreatic ductular adenocarcinoma, these lesions were considered preneoplastic;\nhowever, in the majority of cases these lesions do not progress to neoplasia and are\nof reparative or adaptive nature. The diagnosis of ductular metaplasia may be\nconsidered in those studies where a progression to ductular hyperplasia and\nneoplasia is noted.\n\n\nSolitary or multiple tortuous irregular enlarged lumina.Lined by flattened cuboidal epithelial cells.May be accompanied by mild interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma\ncells.Inspissated secretions may be present.\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nComment: Duct ectasia is the most common age-associated ductal change in Albino and\nGray Norway, August hooded, Fisher 344, Hap:(SD), and Crl:COBS CD (SD) rats (Denda et al. 1994). The lesions of\nduct ectasia or interlobular cystic ducts are uncommon and the incidence is usually\nless than 1% in rats and mice. These lesions usually result from blockage of inter-\nand intra-lobular ducts either proximally or distally due to chronic pancreatitis or\nrare inspissated secretory material.\n\n\nFocal, lobular, or diffuse.Increase in the interstitial connective tissue due to pancreatic stellate cell\nproliferation and collagen deposition.May be accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltrates.\n\n\n\nAmyloid: Abundant extracellular eosinophilic amorphous ground substance that\nexhibits apple green birefringence in Congo red stained sections under polarized\nlight and absence of fibroblast cell proliferation.\n\n\nComment: Collagen may be identified by its birefringence under polarized light and\ncan be stained histochemically using Masson\u2019s trichrome, and van Gieson protocols.\nIn some adult control rats, there may be some peri-insular interstitial fibrosis\nthat extends for short distance into exocrine pancreas. This should be distinguished\nfrom fibrosis resulting from tissue insults based on the severity, distribution and\nthe accompanying chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates.\n\nThe lesions described here cover the currently known spectrum of proliferative findings\nin conventional strains of (wildtype) rats and mice. The majority of proliferative\nlesions in transgenic mouse models of human pancreatic cancer resemble the lesions of\nwildtype animals. Lesions that occur only in specific transgenic mouse models, like\nmucinous cystadenomas with ovarian-like stroma, are not described here (Hruban et al. 2006).\n\nHyperplasias and tumors of the exocrine pancreas are rare and age-related conditions in\ncontrol rats and mice (Longnecker\nand Millar 1990; Boorman and\nSills 1999). The separation of acinar hyperplasia and adenoma can be difficult\nand in the end may be arbitrary as these lesions seem to represent a continuum.\nHyperplasia of ducts in circumscribed fibrous areas is often found in aged rats.\nDuct-like structures do not indicate an origin from pancreatic ducts as is the case in\nhumans. Although hyperplasia of ducts may be seen in aged rats, it is still questionable\nif true ductular neoplasia occurs in rats such as humans (cystadenoma,\ncystadenocarcinoma) (Greaves and\nFaccini 1992). In mice, no spontaneous ductal cell hyperplasia or neoplasia has\nbeen described. Animal models with carcinogens revealed that rats develop acinar cell\ncarcinomas whereas hamsters develop ductal carcinomas with the same carcinogen. This\nsuggests that the species is a major determinant of the phenotype in carcinomas of the\npancreas (Longnecker 1986; Longnecker 1994). Mice are relatively\ninsensitive to the induction of pancreatic tumors with chemicals that are known to be\ntumorigens in rats (Boorman and Sills\n1999).\n\n\nFocal lesions usually larger than an average, unchanged islet.Increased number of cells per acinus.May exhibit tinctorial variation from surrounding tissue.Merge usually imperceptibly with adjacent tissue; no or only minimal compression\nor displacement of adjacent acinar tissue.Usually non-encapsulated.Acinar architecture usually maintained or slightly altered at the most.Low to high mitotic index, nuclear polymorphism and nuclear crowding\npossible.\n\n\n\nAdenoma, acinar cell: Distinct demarcation from the surrounding tissue with\ncompression and sometimes encapsulation; altered architecture.Focus, basophilic: Enlarged acinar structures with increased basophilia due to\nabundance of RER; number of cells per acinus not increased; no compression, acinar\nstructure not altered.Hypertrophy, acinar cell: Enlarged acinar cells with increased zymogen granules;\nnumber of cells per acinus not increased; usually diffuse distribution.\n\n\nComment: The separation of acinar hyperplasia and adenoma can be difficult and in\nthe end may be arbitrary as these seem to be a continuum. Some foci of hyperplasia\nmay be just at the edge of an adenoma and thus categorized as such due to plane of\nsection. The grade of alteration of acinar structure and compression of adjacent\ntissue are the most important differential diagnostic criteria.\n\nA sub-category of focal acinar hyperplasia with cell enlargement due to an increase\nof zymogen granules has been termed \u201cfocus, eosinophilic\u201d. Eosinophilic foci are\nthought to be part of a continuum of lesions that subsequently progress into\nadenomas and adenocarcinoma (Rao et al.\n1989; Scarpelli et al.\n1984). In contrast to basophilic foci, these foci are positive for ATPase\nand glutathione-S-transferase \u00b5 histochemical stains. The incidence of eosinophilic\nfoci is 2.6% in male F344 rats (Eustis and Boorman 1985). Eosinophilic foci occur also in mice, but at a\nmuch lower incidence than in rats (Roebuck et al. 1980).\n\nDue to the difficulties to differentiate eosinophilic foci from focal hyperplasia\nin H&E stained sections, it is recommended to diagnose eosinophilic foci not\nseparately but to collect them under focal hyperplasia in this nomenclature\nsystem.\n\nAcinar hyperplasias have a low spontaneous incidence in rats and mice that increase\nwith age (Longnecker and\nMillar 1990; Boorman and\nSills 1999).\n\n\nMultiple cross section profiles of tortuous hyperchromatic ductular cells within\nthe acinar parenchyma.Ducts with increased number of lining epithelial cells often forming\npapillae.Protruding papillae may cause partial obliteration of the lumen.Varying levels of cellular pleomorphism and atypia may be present.Dilated tubules lined by flattened epithelium may occur.Mucus metaplasia in hyperplastic duct epithelium may occur in transgenic mouse\nmodels of pancreatic neoplasia.\n\n\n\nAdenoma, ductal cell: Complex of ductular structures; focal acinar atrophy\nleading to increased numbers of ducts/unit area.\n\n\nComment: Hyperplasia ductal cell is more frequently noted within the\nintrapancreatic ducts than in the extrapancreatic ducts. Hyperplasia of ducts in\ncircumscribed fibrous areas is often found in aged rats.\n\nIn mice, no spontaneous ductal cell hyperplasia or neoplasia has been\ndescribed.\n\nDuctal phenotype may occur under experimental conditions after administration of\nDMBA (Wendt et al. 2007),\ninfection with reovirus 3 (Greaves\n2012), feeding a Western-style diet (Xue et al. 1996), and in transgenic mice (Kras\noncogene) (Grippo et al.\n2003).\n\nTransgenic mouse models for human pancreatic cancer may develop atypical ductal\nhyperplasia with mucin accumulation within tall columnar cells lining the ducts\n(Figure 231) (Hingorani et al. 2003; Aguirre et al. 2003). Following human pathology,\nthese preneoplastic lesions are termed murine pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia\n(mPanINs) (Hruban et al.\n2006). Morphologically they range from ducts lined with an increased number\nof monomorphic tall columnar mucinous cells to multilayered lesions with cribriform\ngrowth and loss of cell polarity (Figure\n232). A grading scheme of PanIN has been introduced (Hruban et al. 2006).\n\n\nCompression of adjacent tissue often present.Encapsulation may occur but is often not present.Sharp demarcation from surrounding normal pancreatic tissue.Architecture is increasingly altered with increasing size.Cells usually well-differentiated.Exhibit variable degree of mitotic index, and nuclear polymorphism.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia, acinar cell: No encapsulation or sharp demarcation, no or only\nslight alteration of acinar structure.Adenocarcinoma, acinar cell: Local invasion or metastases.\n\n\nComment The separation of acinar hyperplasia and adenoma can be difficult and in\nthe end may be arbitrary as these seem to be a continuum. Some foci of hyperplasia\nmay be just at the edge of an adenoma and thus categorized as such due to plane of\nsection.\n\n\nComplex of ductular structures lined by a high cuboidal epithelium resembling\nthat of normal ductules.\n\n\n\nHyperplasia, ductal cell: Ducts with hyperplastic cells, only partly obliterating\nthe lumen, found within focal fibrous areas.\n\n\nComment: Duct-like structures do not indicate an origin from pancreatic ducts such\nas occurs in humans. Although hyperplasia of ducts may be seen in aged rats, it is\nstill questionable if true ductular neoplasia occurs in rats as it does in humans\n(cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma) (Greaves and Faccini 1992). In mice, no\nspontaneous ductal cell hyperplasia or neoplasia have been described. Pancreatic\nneoplasm with ductal phenotype may occur under experimental conditions after\nadministration with DMBA (Wendt et al.\n2007), infection with reo-virus 3 (Greaves 2012), feeding a Western-style diet (Xue et al. 1996), and in transgenic mice (Kras\noncogene) (Grippo et al.\n2003).\n\n\nGlandular, trabecular or solid growth pattern.Loss of acinar architecture.Cellular pleomorphism and anaplasia.Local invasion or distant metastases.May be associated with scirrhous reactions.\n\n\n\nAdenoma, acinar cell: No local invasion or metastases.\n\n\nComment: Animal models of chemical carcinogenesis revealed that rats develop acinar\ncell carcinomas whereas hamsters develop ductal carcinomas with the same carcinogen.\nThis suggests that the species is a major determinant of the phenotype in carcinomas\nof the pancreas (Longnecker 1986;\nLongnecker 1994).\n\nAzaserine is an effective pancreatic carcinogen in rats which initiates a sequence\nof focal proliferative changes in acinar cells that develop into carcinomas. The\nacinar phenotype is mostly retained but focal development of duct-like structures\nhas been noted in a few carcinomas (Longnecker et al. 1992).\n\nMice are relatively insensitive to the induction of pancreatic tumors with\nchemicals that are known to be tumorigenic in rats (Boorman and Sills 1999). Squamous cell\ncarcinoma of the exocrine pancreas has been experimentally induced in mice and has\nmorphologic features of squamous cell carcinoma that occurs at other sites (Dixon and Maronpot 1994).\n\nThe transgenic mouse model bearing the elastase promoter-SV40-early antigen\nconstruct (Ela-1-SV40 T) develop focal acinar cell proliferation that progresses\ninto acinar cell carcinomas while mostly retaining acinar differentiation, although\nin some cases they can develop into undifferentiated tumors (Glasner et al. 1992). A consensus report and\nrecommendations for a standardized nomenclature with definitions and associated\nimages was developed for the pathology of genetically-engineered mouse models of\npancreatic exocrine neoplasia (Hruban\net al. 2006).\n\n\nMalignant features, invasive growth.Cell atypia.Duct-like structures often accompanied by a dense fibrous stroma.\n\n\n\nAdenocarcinoma, acinar cell: Normally no ductular structure.\n\n\nComment: Duct-like structures do not indicate an origin from pancreatic ducts such\nas occurs in humans. Although hyperplasia of ducts may be seen in aged rats, it is\nstill questionable if true ductular neoplasia occurs in rats as it does in humans\n(cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma) (Greaves and Faccini 1992).\n\nPancreatic adenocarcinomas induced by DMBA implantation in rats showed strong\nkeratin, cytokeratin 19 and cytokeratin 20 expression by immunohistochemistry,\nconsistent with a ductal phenotype (Jimenez et al. 1999). Implantation of DMBA in rats induced\ntransdifferentiation of acinar cells to ductal cells and provided precursor lesions\n(tubular complexes) for the development of ductal adenocarcinoma (Bockman et al. 2003).\n\nIn mice, no spontaneous ductal cell hyperplasia or neoplasia has been\ndescribed.\n\nPancreatic intraepithelial precursor lesions in small caliber pancreatic ducts and\nductal adenocarcinoma were induced by DMBA implantation in mice (Wendt et al. 2007). Aggressive\npancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas may occur in transgenic mice (Kras oncogene) after\nblockage of TGF-\u03b2 signalling (Ijichi\net al. 2006). A consensus report and recommendations for a standardized\nnomenclature with definitions and associated images was developed for the pathology\nof genetically-engineered mouse models of pancreatic exocrine neoplasia (Hruban et al. 2006). In\ngenetically-engineered mice, PanIN has been described as a preneoplastic lesion for\nadenocarcinomas, but conclusive histopathogenesis has not been shown."}
