{"title": "Severe virus influenza A H1N1 related pneumonia and community-acquired\npneumonia: differences in the evolution", "body": "Traditionally, viral pneumonia is considered less severe than bacterial\ncommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, with the influenza A H1N1 (H1N1) outbreak\nin 2009, this assertion underwent a significant change because most of the infected\nindividuals progressed to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and, in many cases,\ndeath.(1)\n\n\nCAP is the leading cause of death from infectious diseases. The mortality rates are\napproximately 1% for outpatients and as high as 14% for hospitalized patients; mortality\nrates are even higher for those who require hospitalization in intensive care units\n(ICU).(2,3)\n\n\nThe 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic had significant morbidity,(4) and the first reports suggested high mortality even in\nyoung patients and in previously healthy middle-aged patients.(5) The hospitalization rates in countries\nin the southern hemisphere ranged from 23.6 to 30.6% for individuals with influenza A\nH1N1 2009; among these, 11.7 to 18.5% (3.6 to 4.4% of the total number of cases) were\nadmitted to ICUs.(6) The mortality\nrates among those admitted to the ICU were 16(7) to 41%(1), and\nmost of those patients required ventilatory support.(8)\n\n\nConsidering the severely ill patients, there was a high incidence of ARDS, the most\ncommon cause of death. Its lethality seems to be similar to that of seasonal\ninfluenza,(1) but it is greater\nthan that reported for the respiratory coronavirus registered during the 2003\noutbreak.(9) A study conducted\nin 11 ICUs from six cities in the state of Paran\u00e1 (Brazil) included 63 suspected and 37\nconfirmed H1N1 cases and reported that most of the patients were young and that the\nmortality rate was 39.7%.(10)\n\n\nThe investigation of diagnostic and severity markers related to the nature of the\ninfectious agent (bacterial versus viral) that caused the community-acquired pneumonia\nand those markers' association with the clinical outcomes will allow that prediction of\nan unfavorable evolution, if present, and can guide earlier interventions and treatment.\nThe present study aimed to determine the clinical, epidemiological and laboratory\ndifferences between critically ill individuals with community-acquired pneumonia and\nthose with severe pneumonia caused by the influenza A H1N1 virus.\n\nThe results were expressed as the mean and standard deviation or median and\n25th -75th percentiles. The statistical analysis used\nStudent's t test to compare two groups of normally distributed continuous variables,\nand the Mann-Whitney test was used for non-normal distributions. Descriptive\nstatistics were calculated for the quantitative variables, and they were analyzed\nusing Fisher's test. P values <0.05 were considered significant.\n\nThe data of 45 patients were evaluated. Fifteen of those patients were admitted with\nH1N1 and 30 were admitted with CAP. The patients with H1N1 were younger (34.3\u00b110.9 years\nversus 55.9\u00b116.4 years in patients with CAP; p<0.001; Table 1). The proportion of patients requiring mechanical\nventilation (86.7% versus 13.3%; p<0.05) and the mortality rate were higher in the\nH1N1 group than in the CAP group (53% versus 20%, respectively; p=0.056).\n\nIn patients with H1N1, the most frequent comorbidities were obesity, 53%; cardiovascular\ndisease, 20%; and diabetes, 20%. In the CAP group, the most frequent comorbidities were\ncardiovascular diseases, 40%; tobacco smoking, 30%; and diabetes, 27% (Table 1). Obesity was significantly more prevalent\nin the H1N1 group (53%) than in the CAP group (6.6%), with p=0.02 (Table 1).\n\nCompared with survivors, nonsurvivors of H1N1 were significantly older (40.2\u00b19.2 versus\n27.6\u00b18.7 years; p=0.018), had higher serum lactate levels on admission (4.35\u00b13.61 versus\n1.53 \u00b1 0.85 mEq/L; p=0.06) and had longer hospitalizations (not significant; Table 1).\n\nCompared with patients from the control group, patients from the H1N1 group had\nsignificantly lower leukocyte counts (Day 1: 6,728\u00b14,070 versus 16,038\u00b17,863 and Day 2:\n7,957\u00b15,981 versus 14,130\u00b16,514; p<0.05 for both) and significantly lower serum PCR\nlevels (Day 2: 15.1\u00b18.1 versus 22.1\u00b110.9 mg/dL, p<0.05; Table 2). H1N1 nonsurvivors had significantly higher CRP levels\ncompared with survivors (Day 1: 21.9\u00b12.9 versus 6.9\u00b14.8 mg/dL; Day 2: 20.5\u00b13.5 versus\n10.6\u00b18.2 mg/dL; Day 3: 20.3\u00b14.1 versus 8.1\u00b19.3 mg/dL; Day 4, 16.1\u00b15.5 versus 5.6\u00b16.8\nmg/dL; p<0.05 for all; Table 2).\n\nThe PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower during the first week\nfor patients with H1N1 (Table 3). Nonsurvivors\nhad lower PaO2/FiO2 values (Day 2: 54\u00b143 versus 165\u00b194) and higher\nplasma creatinine levels (Day 3: 1.72\u00b10.59 versus 1.06\u00b10.27 mg/dL; p<0.05) compared\nwith survivors (Table 3). The platelet count\nvalues are described in table 3. Figure 1 shows the mean CRP (mg/dL) and\nPaO2/FiO2 for the H1N1 and CAP groups.\n\nIn the present study, we observed that, compared with patients who were admitted with\nbacterial CAP, the H1N1 group had younger patients and a higher prevalence of obesity.\nSignificant differences were observed in the leukocyte count, CRP and oxygenation\nprofiles, and higher mortality was observed in the H1N1 group.\n\nPatients with diabetes mellitus, cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory\nand autoimmune diseases and pregnant women (especially those in the second and third\ntrimesters of pregnancy) also showed increased susceptibility to more severe\ndisease.(10) In a Brazilian\nstudy, 27% of the patients with H1N1 were obese.(10) Obesity has been reported as a risk factor for severity and\nmortality among patients with swine flu.(8) A probable reason for this fact is the decrease in the functional\nresidual capacity, which likely has an important impact during the evolution of\nH1N1.(10)\n\n\nCRP is an acute-phase protein released immediately after the start of the inflammatory\nor tissue injury process. CRP serum concentration is determined by its synthesis rate,\nwhich depends on the intensity of the inflammatory stimulus. Studies have demonstrated\nthe utility of serial CRP measurements as a tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of the\nresponse to CAP and nosocomial pneumonia treatment.(13-15) A high CRP serum level\non admission to the emergency room was a predictor of ICU admission and need for\nmechanical ventilation.(16) However,\nthe kinetics of serum CRP levels in patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia remain unknown\nto date.\n\nCompared with patients from the CAP group, patients from the H1N1 group had\nsignificantly lower serum CRP levels and leukocyte counts, which suggest a lower\ninflammatory response compared with acute bacterial conditions and a possible viral\ninfection. However, patients with H1N1 who did not survive had CRP levels that were\nhigher than those of survivors and were similar to those found in the bacterial process.\nThese data suggest that the patients who died had a stronger inflammatory response or a\nsecondary bacterial infection.\n\nA secondary bacterial infection was implicated in the increased morbidity and mortality\nof patients with influenza A H1N1 2009.(17,18) The most commonly\nidentified agents were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus,\nHaemophilus influenzae and gram-negative bacilli. In fatal cases of H1N1\nvirus infection, the most evident histopathological findings were different degrees of\nalveolar injury with the presence of hyaline membrane and septal edema, necrotizing\ntracheitis and bronchiolitis, pulmonary vascular congestion, alveolar hemorrhage,\npulmonary thromboembolism and bacterial coinfection in 26 to 38%.(19) A recent study reported that among\npatients with H1N1 infection, CRP serum levels were significantly higher in those who\ndeveloped pneumonia compared with patients who did not develop pneumonia.(20)\n\n\nPaO2/FiO2 values were significantly lower in patients with H1N1\nthan in patients with severe CAP who received mechanical ventilatory support. The main\ncause of death in patients with H1N1 is respiratory failure refractory to the usual\nmechanical ventilation.(21) Currently,\nthe use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these patients seems to be one of the\nmost effective measures for reducing mortality.(21) The presence of severe hypoxemia in patients who died suggests\nthat the medical centers that receive these patients should be prepared to offer this\ntype of advanced life support to patients with severe hypoxemia.\n\nThe mortality rate in this series was 53% for patients with H1N1. Among ICU patients,\nthe mortality rate is 16(7) to\n41%(1) in different series, and\nmost of the patients required prolonged ventilatory support.(8)\n\n\nThe major limitations of this study are its observational nature, the small sample size\nand the pairing performed by consecutive sample. Thus, other more adequate selection\nmethods (such as the propensity score or by severity criteria) were not possible, which\nrepresent a potential selection bias). Other limitations were the inability to assess\nother markers of severity, such as procalcitonin and interleukin-6, and the fact that\nthe study was conducted in a single center. However, the inclusion of a homogeneous\npopulation with severe forms of pneumonia supports the findings of the present\nstudy.\n\nUsual laboratory tests may contribute to the differential diagnosis of severe\ncommunity-acquired pneumonia and severe influenza A H1N1 pneumonia."}
