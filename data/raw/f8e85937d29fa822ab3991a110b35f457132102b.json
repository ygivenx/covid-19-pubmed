{"title": "Journal Pre-proof", "body": "In late December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market in Wuhan city, China. The causative pathogen was subsequently identified as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) [1] . Over the course of the current pandemic, it became apparent that some patients can present with abdominal symptoms without fever or respiratory manifestations, and could be overlooked by health care providers.\n\nWe present a case series of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection whose initial symptoms were gastrointestinal. . [2] .\n\nAll patients received chest CTs and had throat-swab specimens obtained and maintained in viral-transport media . RT-PCR detection reagents were provided by the center for disease control and prevention(CDC), Wuhan, Hubei province. Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was done both in our hospital and the CDC laboratory of Hubei province. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection were defined as those with a positive test result from either laboratory [3] .\n\nOf 1141 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 183 (16%) presented with gastrointestinal symptoms only, and their clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . Men slightly outnumbered women, and the most common GI symptom was loss of appetite, followed by nausea and vomiting which occurred in about two thirds of cases.\n\nDiarrhea and abdominal pain were the presenting symptom in 37% and 25% of patients, respectively.\n\nLaboratory testing showed that mean leukocyte (2.7 \u00b1 0.2 X 10 9 /L,) and lymphocyte(0.53\u00b10.014, X 10 9 /L ) counts were below normal , and C-reactive protein levels were elevated (18.7 \u00b1 6.8 mg/L). Mild elevations in serum transaminases were noted (AST,65.8\u00b112.7 U/L; ALT, 66.4\u00b113.2 U/L), but renal function generally was intact.\n\nAt the onset of their illness, 175 of 183 (96%) of patients had lung lesions on chest CT , which were unilateral in 61% of cases. The most common CT findings were abnormal lung texture (83%), ground-glass densities (73%), consolidation (27%), and pleural effusion (11%).\n\nThe mean time elapsed for confirmation of COVID-2019 was 3.5 days from the onset of symptoms. Of the 183 patients, 7 died due to progressive respiratory failure, and 176 recovered.\n\nPatients with COVID-19 typically present with fever or a respiratory syndrome. Our case series shows that some patients can present with gastrointestinal symptoms, with paucity of other manifestations. Such patients could be overlooked, leading to potentially serious consequences to them and their contacts. It is important that clinicians are aware that COVID-19 can present with predominantly GI symptoms, and maintain appropriate vigilance and high index of suspicion.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 can enter angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)-expressing cells.\n\nACE2 is not only expressed in lung AT2 cells, but also can be found in the upper esophagus, and in stratified epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes in the ileum and colon [4] . The enteric symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with invaded ACE2-expressing enterocytes [5] . These findings suggest that the digestive system, along with the respiratory tract, may be a potential route for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and could explain why some patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\nMuch still needs to be learned about this zoonotic coronavirus which has crossed species to infect human populations [6] , and its spectrum of disease."}
