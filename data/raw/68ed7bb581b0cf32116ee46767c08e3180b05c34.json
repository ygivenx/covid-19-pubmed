{"title": "Clinical characteristics of 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China", "body": "Although the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused over 2200 deaths in China, there was no study about death yet. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19.\n\nFor this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020 . This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation.\n\nWe included 36 patients who died from COVID- 19 author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the \n\nLots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were common, and need to be monitored in the routine treatment.\n\nThere is no any funder involved in this study.\n\nThe outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) happened since December 2020 in Wuhan 1 . 2 SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading in China as well as in other countries [3] [4] [5] [6] . The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020. According to the situation report from WHO, as of 21 February 2020, SARS-Cov-2 infection has caused 76769 confirmed cases in 27 countries and 2247 deaths globally 7 .\n\nSeverity of COVID-19 varied from mild to severe. 8 Mortality rate of COVID-19 can be reduced, by timely identifying those who are at higher risk of developing into critically ill patients, closely monitoring changes of their disease course, and applying intensive care treatment to these patients. However, reports about dead cases of COVID-19 were limited but warranted, considering the large amount of confirmed cases, which is still increasing. In this single-centered study, we retrospectively analysed specific clinical information of 36 non-survivors infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nFor this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan.

This study was approved by the ethics commissions of hospital, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation.\n\nCOVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR using the same protocol described previously 9 .\n\nAdditionally, all patients were given chest computed tomography (CT). We obtained epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment and outcome data from patients' medical records. Clinical outcomes were followed up to Feb 14, 2020.\n\nWe analysed epidemiological, demographics, exposure history, smoking history, chronic medical illness, signs and symptoms on admission, comorbidity, chest CT findings, laboratory findings and treatment measures.\n\nCategorical variables were described as count (%). Continuous variables were described using mean (SD) if they are normally distributed, median (IQR) if they are not.

One (2.78%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). Twenty-five (69.44%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56%) female. Four (11.11%) patients have smoking history. Twenty-six (72.22%) patients had chronic diseases. The most common chronic diseases were hypertension (21, 58.33%), cardiovascular (8, 22 .22%) and diabetes (7, 19.44%) ( Table 1 ).\n\nOn admission, most patients had fever, cough and more than half of them had shortness of breath (Table 2 ). Other symptoms included fatigue, dyspnea, sputum production, disturbance of consciousness, diarrhea, hemoptysis and myalgia. (Table 2) According to chest CT scan, 31 (96.88%, N=32) patients showed bilateral pneumonia (75%). On admission, leucocytes were below the normal range in 5 (14.71%) patients and above the normal range in 11 (32.35%) patients (Table 3 ). Neutrophils showed above the normal range in 16 (47.06%) patients. Lymphocytes and hemoglobin were below the normal range in many patients (Table 3) . Twelve (35.39%) patients' platelets were below the normal range. 22 patients had varying degrees of liver function abnormality, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) rose above the normal range ( Table 3) . Elevation of lactate dehydrogenase were showed in 26 (100%, N=26) patients. About 30% of these patients had different degrees of renal function damage, with elevated blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine. All rights reserved.

All patients were given antibiotic treatment ( Table 2) Table   2 ). The median time from onset to death was 17 days (Figure 1 ).\n\nWe reported on 36 patients who died from SARS-CoV-2 infection in a single hospital of Wuhan.\n\nAll these patients had ARDS and 28 (77.78%) patients needed mechanical ventilation. Bilateral pneumonia was detected in most patients on admission. Previous studies have shown that elder patients and males who were confirmed with coronavirus infection are at higher risk of ARDS, 10 All rights reserved.

Antibiotic treatment was used to prevent secondary infections since these patients were critically ill. Antiviral regimes were also used in most patients which we hoped may have roles but still need more data. However, there were no specific remedies for SARS-CoV-2 yet 11, 12 . Therefore, most patients were treated with supportive treatment and intensive care. Unfortunately, due to restrictions of hospital's conditions and the heavy burden of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, neither were we able to provide patients in need with advanced life support systems like Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), nor were able to transport all serious patients to superior hospital for better medical treatments in time. The median survival time of the patients in our study was only 2 weeks approximately, which was shorter compared to previous reports 13 will decrease as the clinical capacity improves.\n\nAll rights reserved.

In our study, we found that the majority of coronavirus non-survivors were male patients, elder patients and patients with chronic diseases, which indicated that these patients might be also at increased risk of becoming critically ill or death. Cerebrovascular diseases were the most common comorbidities. Twentytwo (61.11%) non-survivors had cerebrovascular diseases in our report, and the percentage of cerebrovascular diseases among non-survivors was higher than that reported by Yang et al 13 .\n\nBesides, there were 4 (11.11%) non-survivors who had smoking history and 4 (11.11%) had preexisting COPD. According to previous studies on middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), smokers and COPD patients might be susceptible to MERS. Further, compared to non-smokers, smokers and COPD patients had a higher dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) expression, which was inversely correlated with lung function and diffusing capacity parameters 16 . Although the relationship between smoking history and susceptibility as well as worse outcomes in COVID-19 remains unclear, we cautioned that the prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with smoking history might be more severe.\n\nIn our cohort, lymphocytopenia occurred in more than 70% of patients at admission, which is a main laboratory feature in COVID-19 patients 15, 17 . Lymphocytopenia have been identified in the critically ill patients with SARS-CoV and MERS infection 18, 19 . As mentioned in previous studies, the severity of lymphocytopenia might indicate the severity of COVID-19, under the assumption of SARS-CoV-2 viral could attack and destroy the lymphocyte targetedly 2 . Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings. Increased levels of serum CRP, PCT, IL-6 were also found.\n\nIt indicated the obvious inflammatory response among these patients.

Therefore, intravenous glucocorticoids therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and interferon-alpha (\u03b1-IFN) aerosol inhalation were also used to restore homeostasis, without solid evidence. To our knowledge, there is still no specific medicine for COVID-19 till now. Clinical trials on promising regimens for COVID-19, such as remdesivir, lopinavir, and chloroquine phosphate are ongoing, which shed light on conquering the COVID-19 epidemic 12 .\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, only 36 dead cases were included. However, this is the largest cohort about the non-survivors of COVID-19 up to now. Second, some specific clinical information was insufficient, such as mechanical ventilation settings, oxygen concentration, and detailed medication history. Third, this is a retrospective, single-centered study. It may be limited to the hospital critical care resources. Further studies are still needed.\n\nIn conclusion, most non-survivors are older men with comorbidities (especially cardiovascular diseases). They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days.\n\nThe mean survival time in our cohort of COVID-19 non-survivors was about 2 weeks. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were found in these patients, and need to be monitored in the routine treatment. Early detection and intervention of patients are especially important which can delay the development from mild to severe cases.\n\nAll rights reserved.
