{"title": "Transmission dynamics and risk factors for pandemic H1N1\u2010related illness: outbreak investigation in a rural community of British Columbia, Canada", "body": "During the last week of April 2009, a laboratory\u2010confirmed outbreak of pandemic A/H1N1 [A(H1N1)pdm09] influenza was reported in an elementary school in a rural community of British Columbia (BC), Canada. The school includes students of Aboriginal and non\u2010Aboriginal backgrounds drawn from the local town and surrounding First Nations reserves. Because A(H1N1)pdm09 had recently emerged in mid\u2010April as a novel virus and in order to characterize its transmission, clinical profile, risk factors, and impact, an outbreak investigation was organized by public health authorities through household telephone survey between May 15 and June 5, 2009.\n\nInitial findings from this investigation have previously been published.\n1\n Of note, this outbreak investigation provided first detection of an association between prior 2008\u20132009 trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) receipt and A(H1N1)pdm09 risk that was subsequently confirmed in at least four other studies conducted during the summer, 2009 in Canada.\n2\n In this paper, we report additional epidemiologic features of influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) experience during this outbreak including characteristics such as medical care, risk factors, and duration of illness both on\u2010 and off\u2010reserve. As a further main objective, we evaluate transmission patterns such as the household secondary attack rate (SAR) and serial interval (SI: interval between the index and secondary case), both of which are relevant in planning for and responding to novel influenza virus emergence.\n\nAs previously described,\n1\n an elementary school (school A) in a rural BC community identified a >10% absenteeism rate owing to respiratory illness among students. Local health authorities were notified on April 28, 2009, and nasopharyngeal specimens confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 as the cause on May 3, 2009. The school was closed on May 1, 2009 and re\u2010opened May 11, 2009.\n\nTo characterize clinical and epidemiologic features of A(H1N1)pdm09 illness and spread in the community, a telephone survey of households with at least one child enrolled in any of the community schools was conducted May 15 through June 5, 2009. Among consenting households, an adult respondent provided information about household characteristics and illness among all household members. Household information included the number of household members and sleeping rooms, self\u2010identification as Aboriginal/non\u2010Aboriginal, and among Aboriginal participants residency on\u2010/off\u2010reserve. Individual\u2010level information included age, flu\u2010like symptoms and related dates of onset, days spent in bed, health care visits, comorbidity (corresponding to high\u2010risk categories specified by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization), and receipt of 2008\u20132009 and/or 2007\u20132008 TIV.\n3\n\n\n\nTo validate clinical case definitions, households with at least one member reporting ILI (fever and cough plus \u22651 of headache, general aches, sore throat, and/or prostration since April 1, 2009) were subsequently invited to provide blood specimens from both symptomatic and asymptomatic household members. Antibody response to A(H1N1)pdm09 was measured by the hemagglutination inhibition and micro\u2010neutralization assays according to procedures described earlier.\n1\n As previously described,\n1\n serology and RT\u2010PCR testing indicated that the outbreak was mainly confined to households of the initially affected school A and among Aboriginal people who lived on\u2010reserve in the surrounding community. Thus, analysis of A(H1N1)pdm09 clinical and epidemiologic features was restricted to elementary school and on\u2010reserve participants.\n1\n\n\n\nDescriptive features including the proportion with ILI and medically attended ILI (MAILI) as well as the distribution by age, comorbidity, Aboriginality, household density, and vaccination status for school A, on\u2010reserve participants, and both combined were derived. The SAR was defined as the proportion of household members who developed symptoms after the index case within a household. We present SAR by age, Aboriginality, and 2008\u20132009 TIV receipt. Among those with ILI, the duration of illness was estimated using information on the date of symptom onset and resolution as reported by participants. Individuals who still had symptoms at the time of interview were treated as right censored, that is, illness had not ended yet.\n\nWe fit non\u2010parametric Kaplan\u2013Meier distribution to the data to estimate median duration. For comparison, we also fit log\u2010logistic distribution. Based on the information collected during interviews, we used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) for binary outcomes to compute risk factors for transmission while accounting for within household clustering and adjusting for other covariates.\n\nThe SI is the duration between onset of symptoms in an index and a secondary case.\n4\n, \n5\n SI was estimated using data from infector/infectee pairs in the households where a single infector could be identified and date of onset was known for both. For these analyses, we considered two scenarios where both index and secondary case had ILI (no. of pairs = 15) and where index case was laboratory\u2010confirmed and the secondary case had ILI (no. of pairs = 6). We assumed that transmission was possible only if the delay between symptom onset of the index case (infector) and of the secondary case (infectee) in the household was \u22651 day. Thus, according to this assumption, it is not possible for both the index and secondary case to start symptoms on the same day. We fit Weibull, gamma, log\u2010normal, and log\u2010logistic parametric models to the number of days, and the Weibull model achieved the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) of these distributions. From the Weibull distribution, we computed median serial interval and its 95% confidence interval (CI).\n\nThis survey was conducted as a public health authorized outbreak investigation, and research ethics board review was not required. However, ethics review and approval were obtained prior to blood collection.\n\nOutbreak details, including predominant involvement of school A and Aboriginal on\u2010reserve residents and related epidemic curves of ILI, are available in prior publication.\n1\n\n\n\nThe overall analysis of epidemiologic characteristics based on the telephone survey included 408 participants, 253 from school A and 191 participants who lived on\u2010 reserve including 36 who were also part of the school A population.\n\nOverall, characteristics of the school A and on\u2010reserve participants were similar with some exceptions. The school A\u2010associated participants were slightly younger than the on\u2010reserve participants (median age 13 versus 18 years, respectively). A higher proportion of on\u2010reserve versus school A participants had an underlying chronic condition (14% versus 5%) and received 2008\u20132009 TIV (38% versus 21%) as is recognized from other community surveys comparing Aboriginal to non\u2010Aboriginal populations.\n6\n, \n7\n There was suggestion of greater crowding among on\u2010reserve households. The proportion of participants living in households in the fourth quartile of density was greater among those living on\u2010reserve (39%) compared to school A participants overall (25%) (Table 1). Mean and median household size for the school A population were 4\u00b71 and 4\u00b70 (range: 1\u201310), whereas for the on\u2010reserve population, it was 4\u00b77 and 5 (range: 1\u20138), respectively. Mean (SD) and median number of people per room were 1\u00b738 (0\u00b737) and 1\u00b733 for school A and 1\u00b747 (0\u00b766) and 1\u00b733 for on\u2010reserve participants.\n\nThe overall ILI rate was comparable among school A versus on\u2010reserve participants (26% versus 23%); however, more on\u2010reserve participants sought care for their illness (25/66 = 38% versus 25/44 = 57%) (Table 1). The ILI rate decreased with age: higher in children 1\u20138 years of age (yoa) among school A (48%), on\u2010reserve (38%), and overall (39%) participants and falling to \u223c10% in working\u2010age adults in school A. There were few elderly participants (n = 8). Those with chronic conditions also had higher frequency of ILI overall (35% versus 21%) and in school A (31% versus 26%) and among on\u2010reserve participants (37% versus 21%). The rate of MAILI was also higher among those with comorbidity (18% versus 8%). Those in the 4th quartile of household density also had higher ILI and MAILI overall and in both groups. Among school A participants, those living on\u2010reserve had higher ILI (50% versus 11%, 24%) and MAILI (39% versus 6%, 4%) than those off\u2010reserve or non\u2010Aboriginal participants. Those who received 2008\u20132009 TIV also had higher ILI (32% versus 20%) and MAILI (20% versus 6%) rates overall evident in both school A and on\u2010reserve participants.\n\nThe median interval between onset of symptoms and seeking medical care for ILI was 5\u00b70 days (95% CI: 4\u00b70 \u20138\u00b70). This interval was significantly longer for on\u2010reserve compared to school A participants (8\u00b70, 95% CI: 8\u00b70\u20139\u00b70 versus 4\u00b75, 95% CI: 3\u00b70\u20136\u00b70 days). A comparable but small proportion sought care within 48 hours of onset of symptom onset [3/15 (20%) versus 3/16 (19%)]. None was prescribed antivirals and none was hospitalized.\n\nMedian duration of illness was 9 days (95% CI: 6\u201310) (Figure 1). Of 92 individuals with ILI, 34 (37%) reported mild, 40 (43%) moderate, and 18 (20%) severe illness. Median duration of illness varied by self\u2010reported severity of illness: mild 4 days (95% CI: 3\u20137), moderate 8 days (5\u201314), and severe 14 days (9\u2010 not estimated owing to censoring); P = 0\u00b7001. Median duration of illness among the age group 9\u201319 years [6 days (3\u20138)] was significantly shorter than among those >19 years (10 days (9\u2010 unestimated, P = 0\u00b701), but not significantly different from those <9 years [7 days (5\u201314), P = 0\u00b73]. Those with comorbidity also had longer duration of illness [21 days (4\u2010 unestimated)] than those without [9 days (6\u201310) (P = 0\u00b705)]. On\u2010reserve participants also had slightly longer duration of illness compared to non\u2010Aboriginal people [9 days (7\u201314) versus 7 days (4\u201312)]; P = 0\u00b718.\n\nIn multivariable GLMM analysis among school A and on\u2010reserve households combined, younger age (1\u20138 yoa: OR = 5\u00b72, 95% CI: 2\u00b761\u201310\u00b736; 9\u201319 yoa: OR = 1\u00b787, 95% CI: 0\u00b795\u20133\u00b769 compared to \u226520 yoa), presence of comorbidity (OR = 2\u00b765, 95% CI: 1\u00b716\u20136\u00b705), and receipt of 2008\u20132009 TIV (OR = 2\u00b738, 95% CI: 1\u00b726\u20134\u00b75) were associated with increased risk of A(H1N1)pdm09\u2010related illness (Table 2). Sample size did not support estimates by specific comorbidity.\n\nAmong school A participants, younger age (1\u20138 yoa: OR = 9\u00b733, 95% CI: 3\u00b782\u201322\u00b782; 9\u201319 yoa: OR = 2\u00b776 95% CI: 1\u00b714\u20136\u00b717 compared to \u226520 yoa) and having received 2008\u20132009 TIV (OR = 4\u00b753, 95% CI: 1\u00b786\u201310\u00b799) were each independently associated with A(H1N1)pdm09\u2010related illness (Table S1). Among on\u2010reserve participants, younger age (1\u20138 yoa: OR = 4\u00b763, 95% CI: 1\u00b763\u201313\u00b718; 9\u201319 yoa: OR = 1\u00b784, 95% CI: 0\u00b765\u20135\u00b723 compared to \u226520 yoa), presence of comorbidity (OR = 3\u00b740, 95% CI: 1\u00b712\u201310\u00b730), and receipt of 2008\u20132009 TIV (OR = 2\u00b778, 95% CI: 1\u00b790\u20136\u00b741) were each associated with A(H1N1)pdm09\u2010related illness (Table S2).\n\nOverall, the SAR was 49/339 (22%). The SAR among school A households was 32/119 (27%); excluding on\u2010reserve households, this was 19/94 (20%). The SAR among on\u2010reserve households was 23/94 (24%). The SAR among school A households that were also on\u2010reserve was 13/25 (52%). The SAR was higher overall among younger age groups: <1 yoa: 38%, 1\u20134 yoa 50%, 5\u20139 yoa: 20%, 10\u201319 yoa: 13%, 20\u201349 yoa: 20%, and 50\u201364 yoa (0%) (Table 3). Among school A participants, respective proportions were 53%, 57%, 26%, 12%, 0%, and 0%, and for school A, excluding on\u2010reserve participants were 46%, 40%, 15%, 12%, 0%, 0%.\n\nThe estimated median SI using both index and secondary case pairs with ILI was 3\u00b74 days (95% CI: 2\u00b71\u20135\u00b713) (Figure 2). When we used a laboratory\u2010confirmed index case, the median SI was 4\u00b721 days (1\u00b76\u20139\u00b778). The maximum interval between onset dates of primary and secondary cases was 10 days; in further sensitivity analysis based only on primary\u2013secondary case intervals of \u22647 days, the SI was estimated at 2\u00b78 days.\n\nIn this paper, we report findings from one of the earliest outbreak investigations in Canada to characterize A(H1N1)pdm09\u2010related illness during the first weeks of the first pandemic wave. We capitalized on a discrete, intense but community\u2010wide outbreak involving households associated with a first affected school and on\u2010reserve Aboriginal people to estimate epidemiologic characteristics uniquely across age groups and among on\u2010 and off\u2010reserve participants. Overall, we identified illness that was mostly mild and self\u2010limited with no hospitalizations or antiviral prescriptions. Young children, those with chronic diseases, and those who previously received the 2008\u20132009 seasonal influenza vaccine were more likely overall to report A(H1N1)pdm09\u2010related illness. Participants on\u2010reserve were more likely to report comorbidity and greater household crowding; they also reported higher ILI, MAILI, and SARs. Overall, the median interval between symptom onset and care seeking was about 5 days, and median time to recovery was 9 days, both also longer among on\u2010reserve participants. A similarly low proportion (20%) of on\u2010/off\u2010reserve participants sought care within 48 hours; access to health care services in the region is generally considered comparable both on\u2010/off\u2010reserve. We identified a very short median SI of about 3 days, suggesting a brief period to intervene in prevention and control.\n\nMost of the individuals in this community had self\u2010limited febrile respiratory illness. The median duration of self\u2010reported illness of 9 days was slightly longer but within the range of estimates from other studies in the United States (5 and 6 days from New York School outbreak)\n8\n, \n9\n 6 days in the US Air Force Academy outbreak,\n10\n Canada (7 days from Ontario)\n11\n, and Germany (9 days in a household transmission study).\n12\n These estimates of illness duration are also comparable to previous estimates for seasonal influenza: Ng et al.\n\n13\n reported a median duration for seasonal influenza in 2007 and 2008 of 9 days among those who received oseltamivir and 11 days among those who did not, although others have reported no difference in duration of illness by antiviral use.\n9\n, \n12\n In our study population, antivirals were not prescribed to any patient who sought care. Other studies based on surveillance data may have underestimated the actual duration owing to right censoring and a mix of patients who used antivirals and those who did not.\n10\n, \n11\n\n\n\nAs in our investigation, the preponderance of epidemiological and immunological data support an age\u2010related pattern of A(H1N1)pdm09 risk.\n9\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n People with comorbidities were more likely to report ILI in our study but whether this reflects a greater tendency to recognize and declare illness (reporting bias) versus a greater risk of acquiring infection is uncertain; comorbidity has also been reported to be associated with higher risk of more severe disease.\n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n Overall, the targeting of prevention and control measures to people with comorbidities likely has implications for reducing A(H1N1)pdm09\u2010related morbidity and mortality.\n\nThe SAR is an important indicator for influenza transmission, assessing the impact of interventions and planning for future pandemics. In our study, the overall SAR was 22%, higher in those age <1 year (38%) and 1\u20134 years (50%). There is a wide variation in report of SAR from various settings, which is not unexpected. Our estimates are similar to household transmission studies in Germany (26%),\n12\n Kenya (26%),\n20\n and the United States (18%).\n8\n These estimates were slightly lower than other studies in Canada (Sikora C et al: 30%; Papenburg J et al: any ILI: 29%, laboratory\u2010confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 ILI: 26%, and laboratory\u2010confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 including asymptomatic infections: 45%)\n15\n, \n21\n and the United States (27\u00b73%).\n22\n Conversely, our estimates are higher than others reported from Japan (7\u00b76%),\n23\n UK (17%),\n24\n and United States (4\u201313%; 11%; 14\u00b73%).\n9\n, \n16\n, \n25\n Many factors affect transmission and hence SAR within households including age, antiviral use, and ascertainment of index and secondary cases or contacts, as well as socio\u2010environmental factors such as climate, crowding, and control behaviors such as the use of masks and hand washing. The initiation of treatment for the index case upon illness onset or the following day was associated with a 42% reduction in secondary infections in households in a Japanese study.\n26\n In the study by Morgan et al.\n\n16\n (SAR: 4\u201313%), most of the index cases (72%) had received treatment. In the New York school household transmission study (SAR: 11%), about one quarter (26%) of index cases took antiviral treatment and 71% started within 2 days of illness onset.\n9\n About 7% of the household contacts also received antiviral prophylaxis. In the Suess et al.\n\n12\n study, SAR among those who did not receive prophylaxis was 26%, very close to our own measured rate. Reduced virus shedding with antiviral treatment for seasonal and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses has been reported.\n13\n, \n27\n, \n28\n Thus, differences in SAR may also in part be attributed to variation in antiviral use. The pattern we found of higher SAR among children than adults (highest in 0\u20134 and lowest in \u226550 years) is also consistent with other studies.\n9\n, \n15\n, \n16\n A higher SAR among children may be explained by differences in cross\u2010protective innate or acquired immunity as well as contact and hygiene patterns.\n22\n, \n29\n\n\n\nThe spread of an infection is determined by the average number of secondary cases generated by an infectious case. This number is called the basic reproductive number (R\n0\n) when the population is completely susceptible and the effective reproductive number (R) when the population is partially immune. The serial interval is an important parameter as it affects the estimation of R\n0.\n30\n It also determines the rate of growth of an epidemic (R/serial interval): for a given reproductive number (R), an epidemic will grow faster with a shorter serial interval.\n31\n These two parameters together are also useful in evaluating the impact of interventions employed to control the outbreak. Thus, estimating the serial interval is important in responding to a novel pathogen such as A(H1N1)pdm09 and convergence of estimates from several sources and settings lends credibility to the measure overall.\n\nOur estimate of the A(H1N1)pdm09 serial interval (3\u00b74 days) is comparable to that reported by others using similar methods and laboratory\u2010confirmed index cases from various countries and settings including United States (2\u00b77\u20134 days),\n8\n, \n9\n, \n16\n, \n25\n, \n32\n Canada (4\u20135 days\n11\n and 3\u00b74 days\n15\n), Mexico (3\u00b72 days),\n22\n Hong Kong (3\u00b72 days),\n33\n Australia (2\u00b79 days),\n34\n and Germany (3 days).\n12\n These estimates of serial interval are also similar to those of seasonal influenza estimated previously (mean: 3\u00b76 days) and concurrently with A(H1N1)pdm09 activity (3\u00b74 days for H3N2).\n5\n, \n33\n\n\n\nAs discussed in previous publication,\n1\n there are several limitations warranting cautious interpretation of our results. The study relied upon a non\u2010specific clinical outcome (ILI) for defining A(H1N1)pdm09\u2010related illness. There are many causes of ILI as evidenced by other contributing viruses identified through passive surveillance during the study period (see prior publication).\n1\n Other respiratory viruses detected from the local community during that period included coronavirus and rhinovirus/enterovirus. We thus attempted to validate the ILI case definition based on A(H1N1)pdm09 sero\u2010positive status and used that to define the study population, but participation in the sero\u2010survey was self\u2010selected and sample size was small. Secondly, we relied on report by one adult for all household members. ILI experience, duration of illness, and TIV history may have been less well known for other household members. Thirdly, sample size was small with large confidence intervals especially for stratified analyses. In comparing school A and on\u2010reserve households, we identified some overlap including 36 of 191 on\u2010reserve participants who also attended school A. To address this, we separately presented estimates for school A participants with and without on\u2010reserve residency but this further reduced sample size, introducing variability.\n\nIn summary, during a rural community outbreak of pandemic H1N1\u2010related illness, we identified substantial clinical ILI attack rates >20% with secondary household attack rates as high as 50% in young children on\u2010reserve. Young children and those with comorbidities were at higher risk of illness and those living on\u2010reserve tended also to have higher ILI, MAILI, and SAR. The reasons for this warrant better understanding. Like others, we identified a short serial interval suggesting a narrow period to prevent transmission. These early features of the first wave of the 2009 pandemic should also be considered in preparing for emergence of the next novel influenza virus.\n\nNaveed Z.
