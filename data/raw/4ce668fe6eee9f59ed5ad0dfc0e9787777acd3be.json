{"title": "Anti-microbial immunity is impaired in COPD patients with frequent exacerbations", "body": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory airway disorder in which acute exacerbations represent a major complication. Acute exacerbations are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality [1] [2] [3] and preventing exacerbations remains a major unmet need. There has been increasing interest in a recently identified sub-group of patients with COPD who are at risk of exacerbations, defined as the 'frequent exacerbator phenotype'. 4 Patients with frequent exacerbations have worse clinical outcomes including increased morbidity 1 , accelerated lung function decline 2 and greater mortality 5 , suggesting that this group requires special consideration. To date, the underlying mechanisms that predispose such patients to more frequent exacerbations have not been elucidated. It is plausible that abnormalities in host immunity could underlie an increased propensity to exacerbations.\n\nViruses are a major aetiological trigger for exacerbations 6, 7 and data exists to suggest that COPD may be associated with deficient anti-viral immunity 8, 9 . However, not all studies have shown this abnormality 10, 11 , suggesting that it may vary according to disease phenotype. Frequent exacerbators could represent one sub-group in whom defective anti-viral immunity is more prominent. Both experimental and naturally-occurring exacerbation studies also confirm that an initial virus infection can precipitate secondary bacterial infection in COPD 12, 13 with neutrophil elastase-induced cleavage of anti-microbial peptides believed to be important mechanistically 12 . Although bacterial colonisation at stable state has been shown to be associated with increased exacerbation frequency 14 , antimicrobial peptide responses and propensity to develop secondary bacterial infection during virusinfections in frequent versus infrequent exacerbators has not previously been studied.\n\nWe hypothesised that patients with COPD who have a history of frequent exacerbations would have impaired anti-viral and/or anti-bacterial immunity compared to infrequent exacerbators. Using analysis of sputum samples from a cohort of patients monitored prospectively in the community, in combination with in vitro experiments in BECs sampled from patients with COPD and differentiated at the air-liquid interface (ALI), we show that lung innate anti-microbial immunity is impaired in frequent exacerbators. These mechanisms may underlie the increased propensity to exacerbation observed in some patients. author/funder. All rights reserved.

The study protocol was approved by the East London Research Ethics Committee (study number 11/LO/0229) and all subjects gave informed written consent. The subjects all had a clinical diagnosis of COPD that was confirmed with spirometry. All subjects had an initial visit at baseline when clinically stable for clinical assessment, spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ), forced vital capacity (FVC) and peak expiratory flow (PEF)) and clinical sample collection including spontaneous or induced sputum, taken and processed as previously described 8, 15 . At the baseline visit, all subjects were asked about the number of exacerbations experienced in the previous year and were grouped into two groups -frequent exacerbators (\u22652 exacerbations in preceding year) and infrequent exacerbators (0 -1 exacerbations in the previous year), as previously described 16 .\n\nSubjects then had repeat visits at three monthly intervals when clinically stable and were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Subjects reported to the study team when they developed symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection or an increase in any of the symptoms of dyspnoea, cough, sputum volume or purulence. Exacerbation was defined using the East London cohort criteria. 2 Subjects were seen within 48 hours of onset of their symptoms for collection of samples and repeat visits was carried out a two weeks after the initial exacerbation visit. Samples from this cohort have been used in a previous study investigating the role of airway glucose in COPD 17\n\nFor baseline analyses of sputum soluble mediators, in addition to samples taken from the naturally occurring exacerbation study, we also included baseline (pre-infection) samples from 14 COPD subjects recruited to experimental challenge COPD studies 8, 18 . All subjects in these studies gave informed written consent and the protocol was approved by St Mary's NHS Trust Research Ethics Committee (study numbers 00/BA/459E and 07/H0712/138). These subjects were characterised as frequent or infrequent exacerbators using the same definition as described above. Sputum samples were processed using exactly the same methodology as described in the naturally occurring exacerbation study. author/funder. All rights reserved.

All subjects included gave informed written consent and the study protocol was approved by the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee (05/08/10/3.09). Primary cells were grown in complete bronchial epithelial cell growth medium (BEGM)(Lonza) with growth factor supplements in submerged monolayer culture and then seeded at 2 x 10 5 cells/mL in transwells until confluent. RV-A1 infection (MOI 0.1) was applied to the apical surface for 2 hours in 250\u03bcl bronchial epithelial basal medium (BEBM) minimal at 35 o C. Following this, infection media was replaced with 500\u03bcl fresh BEBM minimal for the remainder of the experiment. Samples were collected at 72 hours post-infection with apical media removed and stored for protein expression analyses. Type III IFN proteins were measured using a custom-designed LEGENDplex kit (BioLegend). IFN-\u03b2 was measured using the Verikine ELISA (PBL).\n\nHalf of the transwell membrane was also carefully cut from the inserts and collected into RLT buffer (Qiagen) containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for downstream molecular analyses by RT-qPCR. The remaining transwell membrane was fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 24 hours for histological cross-sections to confirm differentiation.\n\nProtein levels in cell-free sputum samples of CXCL10/IP-10 and CCL5/RANTES were measured using duoset ELISA kits (R&D Systems), according to manufacturer's instructions. Protein levels of all antimicrobial peptides were assayed using commercial ELISA assay kits, as previously described 12, 22 . The sources of the individual ELISAs were as follows: Elafin (R&D Systems), Mannose binding lectin (MBL)-2 (R&D Systems) and SLPI (R&D Systems).\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from sputum cell pellets or bronchial epithelial cell lysates stored in RLT buffer (RNeasy kit, Qiagen) and 2\u00b5g was used for cDNA synthesis (Omniscript RT kit). Quantitative PCR was carried out using previously described specific primers and probes for each gene of interest 23 , and normalized to 18S rRNA. Reactions were analysed using ABI 7500 Fast Realtime PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). author/funder. All rights reserved.

Bead-beating was performed for two cycles of 30 seconds at 6800 rpm (Precellys, Bertin Technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France). Total 16S bacterial loads were measured using quantitative PCR, as previously described 24 . Viruses were detected as described previously 12 .\n\nComparisons of sputum mRNA expression and protein concentrations between frequent and infrequent exacerbators were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test. For in vitro experiments, baseline versus RV-induced expression was analysed using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Mann Whitney U test was used to compare RV induction of mRNA or proteins between frequent and infrequent exacerbators. Correlations between datasets were examined using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 software.

For baseline analyses of sputum cell mRNA (interferons (IFNs) and interferon-stimualated genes (ISGs)), 36 patients had sufficient sample for evaluation and, of these, 13 patients (36.1%) were classified as frequent exacerbators (clinical characteristics are shown in table 1). For baseline analyses of sputum soluble mediators (CXCL10/IP10, MBL, SLPI and elafin proteins), samples from a total of 50 COPD patients (combined from the community cohort and from subjects recruited to experimental infection studies) were available, with 15 patients (30%) classified as frequent exacerbators (clinical characteristics are also shown in table   1 ).\n\nSince viruses are a major cause of exacerbations and deficient anti-viral immunity has been observed in some but not all studies of COPD [8] [9] [10] [11] , we hypothesised that frequent exacerbators would have Table   3 .\n\nGreater heterogeneity with trend for increased viral load was observed in BECs from frequent exacerbators ( Supplementary Fig 1) . Significant induction of IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb1 and IFN\u03bb2/3 mRNAs from baseline was observed in both frequent and infrequent exacerbators at 72 hours post-infection ( Figure   3a ). RV induction of IFN\u03bb1 mRNA was significantly lower in frequent versus infrequent exacerbators with a similar trend (P=0.29) observed for IFN\u03b2 mRNA but no significance difference observed for IFN\u03bb2/3 (Fig 3a) . RV induction of the ISGs 2'-5'OAS and Viperin mRNA was also significantly lower in frequent versus exacerbators with no significant difference observed for PKR (Figure 3b ). Collectively, these data supported our in vivo findings from exacerbating patients that anti-viral responses are reduced in frequent exacerbators and extended these observations by identifying a dysregulated innate immune response in BECs defined by impaired expression of IFN and ISGs author/funder.

Having observed that anti-viral immunity is reduced in frequent exacerbators both in vivo and primary BECs from patients with COPD in vitro, we next examined whether sputum bacterial loads at stable state and during exacerbation differed according to exacerbation frequency.\n\nThere were no differences in sputum 16S bacterial loads between frequent and infrequent exacerbators at baseline or exacerbation onset (Fig 4a&b) . However, frequent exacerbators had a significant increase (~1 log) in bacterial loads at 2 weeks post exacerbation onset (Fig 4c) , suggesting that this COPD subgroup may have increased likelihood of secondary bacterial infection during virusinduced exacerbation.\n\nWe have previously reported that rhinovirus-induced secondary bacterial infection occurs through neutrophil elastase-mediated cleavage and reduction of the anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) SLPI and elafin, a process that occurs in COPD but not healthy subjects and may be further accentuated by inhaled corticosteroid use 21 . Given our observation of increased bacterial loads in frequent exacerbators, we next examined whether this sub-group of COPD patients have concurrently reduced SLPI and elafin levels. There were no differences in sputum SLPI or elafin levels between frequent and infrequent exacerbators either at baseline ( Supplementary Fig 2a-b) or during exacerbation ( Supplementary Fig 1c-d) . This suggested that differential expression of these AMPs does not underlie increased secondary bacterial infection in frequent exacerbators.\n\nWe next focused on other another AMP that could be important in driving secondary bacterial infection in COPD. A previous study reported that mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-2 polymorphisms with associated MBL-2 deficiency in serum is associated with recurrence of infective exacerbations in COPD 25 . Consistent with this report, we also found that MBL-2 concentrations in sputum were significantly reduced in frequent versus infrequent exacerbators at stable state ( Figure 5a ) and also at 2 weeks post exacerbation onset (Figure 5b) , the same timepoint at which bacterial loads were increased.\n\nauthor/funder.

We show here, for the first time, that patients with COPD who have a history of frequent exacerbations have reduced airway anti-microbial immunity when assessed at clinical stability and during subsequent virus-associated exacerbation with an associated increase in bacterial loads. We additionally confirm that COPD frequent exacerbators have reduced ex vivo immune responses to RV infection in primary airway epithelial cells, indicating an innate anti-viral deficiency. This is the first study to show that frequent exacerbators have impaired airway antimicrobial responses and provides an important mechanistic advance in our understanding of this clinically important COPD sub-group. These abnormalities could predispose such patients to greater risk of acquisition of pathogenic viruses and bacteria and/or promote a greater likelihood of developing an exacerbation following infection.\n\nand to influenza infection in BECs are impaired in COPD 8, 9 . Patients with COPD also have increased virus loads and enhanced exacerbation severity when experimentally infected with rhinovirus 8, 18 .\n\nHowever, defects in anti-viral immunity have not been shown universally with other studies reporting the opposite effect of augmented ex vivo anti-viral responses in COPD 10, 11 . The discrepancy between these COPD studies suggests that defective immunity may not be present in all patients with a number of confounding competing factors such as disease severity and medications likely to have an influence.\n\nIt is plausible that patients with frequent exacerbations might represent one sub-group with impaired anti-viral immunity. We report here that expression of both type I and type III IFNs, IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb2/3 mRNAs is reduced in frequent exacerbators at stable state, suggesting that these patients might have a reduced potential to generate protective responses to virus infection. In support of this hypothesis, we also observed that anti-viral responses including IFN\u03b2, IFN\u03bb1 and IFN\u03bb2/3 and the ISGs 2'-5'OAS author/funder. All rights reserved.

This mechanism is supported by a clinical study which reported that COPD patients who are frequent exacerbators experience significantly more coryzal episodes than infrequent exacerbators 26 . Given that inhaled IFN-\u03b2 therapy has been shown to confer clinical benefit in a subgroup of severe asthmatic patients who develop a cold 27 , our data raises suggestion that such innate immune-boosting therapies could be effective when used in a targeted manner in patients with COPD with evidence of frequent exacerbations and a less effective innate immune response.\n\nDespite observing impaired ex vivo RV-induction of IFN and ISG mRNA in frequent exacerbator BECs at 72 hours post-infection, we did not observe corresponding differences in protein production of type I and III IFNs by these cells at the same timepoint. Our studies were limited by sample availability only allowing evaluation at a single timepoint. We have previously reported that protein production of IFN persists at least up to 96 hours in this cell type 21 and it is feasible that evaluation at later timepoints may be required to observe significant differences in translated IFN proteins. Despite a lack of difference in absolute levels of IFN protein, the reduced ISG expression observed in frequent exacerbators supports a less effective IFN-induced response in these subjects Bacterial infection is also associated with exacerbation in COPD with increased PCR-based bacterial detection at exacerbation versus stable state suggesting a causative role 28, 29 . Additionally, virusinduced secondary bacterial infection has been reported in both experimental and naturally occurring exacerbations 12, 13 . We have previously reported that experimental RV challenge in patients with COPD is associated with increased frequency of secondary bacterial infection compared to healthy subjects 12,30 via a mechanism of neutrophil elastase-mediated cleavage of anti-microbial peptides SLPI and elafin 12 . Here, we extend these findings to reveal that frequent exacerbators have higher bacterial loads at 2 weeks following onset of virus-associated exacerbation, suggesting that this subgroup of COPD patients might be at greatest risk of developing secondary bacterial infection following initial virus infection. Although we found no difference in levels of SLPI and elafin according to exacerbation frequency, we did identify that expression of another AMP MBL-2 was reduced in frequent author/funder.

The potential importance of MBL-2 during virus-associated exacerbation was further demonstrated by our finding that its expression correlated negatively with bacterial loads during exacerbation. MBL is a key component of innate immunity that activates the lectin complement pathway and is involved in the process of bacterial phagocytosis 31 . MBL deficiency is associated with susceptibility to respiratory tract infections and pneumonia in healthy individuals 32, 33 and to increased risk of sepsis in animal models 34 . MBL can bind to various pathogens of relevance to COPD exacerbations including both viruses and bacteria 35 .\n\nGenetic MBL deficiency has been previously shown to be associated with both increased 25, 36 and reduced 37 exacerbation frequency in COPD. Although serum MBL concentrations have been shown to not differ between frequent and infrequent exacerbators 36 , a previous study reported reduced bronchoalveolar lavage MBL concentrations in COPD versus healthy subjects 38 . Our data extends these observations by demonstrating that deficient airway MBL-2 at baseline and during subsequent exacerbation might predispose frequent exacerbators to increased secondary bacterial infection. A previous study reported that the presence of rhinovirus is associated with increased S.pneumoniae colonization in children with MBL gene polymorphisms, further suggesting a role for MBL in virusinduced secondary bacterial infection 39 . Given that nebulised plasma-derived MBL has been shown to restore phagocytic function in smoke-exposed mice 40 , our data raise speculation that administration of MBL could additionally be considered as an effective preventative and/or therapeutic strategy for COPD exacerbations. Further studies are needed to evaluate this.\n\nIt is important to note that causation cannot be inferred from the results of our study. Although we found reduced anti-microbial responses in patients with a history of frequent exacerbations, we cannot reliable conclude that these abnormalities directly lead to inherent increased exacerbation risk per se. There are likely to be a number of additional factors that may be contributing to the observed differences and, notably, in stable state analyses, frequent exacerbators showed trends towards greater ICS use and less current smoking. These confounders could contribute directly or indirectly to the differences observed, as previously reported 21, 41, 42 . We therefore consider our study to be hypothesis generating and emphasise the importance of future larger in vivo studies to more carefully dissect the influence of various factors and definitely answer the question of whether deficient antimicrobial immunity underlies propensity to exacerbation frequency in COPD. Previous studies have also indicated that exacerbation risk in COPD is dynamic and may change from year to year 4, 43 . A longer-term study with repeated airway sampling would be need to determine whether baseline antimicrobial responses are similarly dynamic in nature. author/funder. All rights reserved.

These immune defects may underlie the increased propensity to exacerbations observed in this sub-group and provides evidence to support therapeutic approaches that boost innate immunity in COPD author/funder.
