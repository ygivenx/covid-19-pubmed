{"title": "Structural proteins of bovine coronavirus strain L 9: effects of the host cell and trypsin treatment", "body": "Proteolytic cleavage of inactive precursor polypeptides of assembled virions into an active form is necessary for inducing the infectivity of a number of viruses. Notably, orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses require cleavage of envelope proteins for the viruses to become infectious. Processing of the viral proteins is accomplished either by cellular proteases or by exogenous proteases such as trypsin [2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11, 18, 19] . Such findings are emerging for coronaviruses as well. Frana et al. [6] found that processing of the 180kd glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus strain A 59 (MHV-A 59) was host celldependent and affected the functional capacity of the virus. Those cells which fully cleaved the 180 kd protein to its 90 kd subunits activated rapid cell fusion. Cells which cleaved the protein incompletely required trypsin to activate rapid cell fusion.\n\nTrypsin enhances the replication and cytopathic expression of bovine coronaviruses. We demonstrated trypsin-dependent cell fusion of bovine fetal spleen cells infected with BCV-L9 [20] . Storz and coworkers [21] reported enhanced cell fusion of BCV-L9 infected bovine fetal brain and bovine fetal thyroid cells in the presence of trypsin. The protein responsible for cell fusion has not been determined. BCV virions with shortened surface projections were produced in trypsin-treated bovine fetal thyroid celt cultures [21] . Williams [31] detected two phenotypes of virus when BCV-L9 was purified from human rectal tumour-18 (HRT-18) cells by isopycnic cetrifugation in sucrose or CsC1 gradients. The dense and light forms of the virus had densities of 1.255 and 1.233 g/cm 3, respectively. The two virus forms had distinct polypeptide profiles, and the light form was converted to the dense form by in vitro trypsin treatment.\n\nOne objective of this study was to assess putative cell-dependent differences in the protein composition of BCV-Lg. The virus was propagated in HRT-18 parent cells, four different HRT-18 clones [St. Cyr-Coats et al., submitted], and bovine fetal spleen cells (D 2BFS). These cells display different cythopathic effects when infected with the virus. A second objective was to compare the protein profiles in vitro trypsin-treated or untreated BCV-L 9 propagated in HRT-18 and D2BFS cells. The profiles were examined under reducing and non-reducing conditions to reveal the effect of the enzyme on the viral polypeptides. D 2BFS cells infected with BCV require trypsin to activate cell fusion, which provided conditions to identify the viral protein(s) responsible for cell fusion.\n\nThe human adenocarcinoma cell line (HRT-18) and four HRT-18 clones, 3 F3, D2, 3 E 3, and 4 B 3, established by limRing dilution, were grown in 850 cm 2 Coming roller bottles or in 150 cm 2 flasks. When seeded in roller bottles, 25 mM HEPES and 12 mM NaHCO3 were supplemented to stabilize pH in Dulbecco's Modified Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM) (Gibco). After 1 day incubation at 37 \u00b0 C, this medium was replaced with DMEM containing 44raM NaHCO3, penicillin (100units/ml), streptomycin (100gg/ml), and 5 % fetal calf serum. D2BFS cells are a heterogenous subpopulation derived from bovine fetal spleen cells which overcame precrisis to multiply past the 30th passage. These cells were grown in Eagles Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) containing 25ram HEPES, penicillin and streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf s e r u m .\n\nBCV-L9 is a bovine coronavirus strain adapted to cell culture by Mebus et al. [15] . This virus was plaque purified twice before use in these investigations.\n\nHRT-18 cells were infected with BCV-L 9 at an MOI of 0.01-0.1 PFU/cell. Following adsorption for 1 h at 37 \u00b0 C, excess inoculum was removed and cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's PBS. Medium was added, and cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0 C. When CPE affected approximately 80% of the monolayer, cells were frozen at -7 0 \u00b0C. Bottles were thawed; the infected material was pooled into 250 ml centrifuge bottles, sonicated, and refrozen.\n\nVirus was purified from thawed cell lysate by isopycnic centrifugation in linear sucrose gradients according to the procedure described by Wege et al. [22] . Gradient fractions were collected by puncturing the bottom of the centrifuge tubes. Viruscontaining fractions were identified by hemagglutinating activity (HA). Fractions containing the highest HA titers were pooled and concentrated by sedimentation through a 5 ml 20% sucrose cushion for 2 h at 90 000 x g. Virus was resuspended in TNE buffer (0.01 M tris-HCL, 0.01 M NaC1, 0.001 M EDTA), pH7.4. This virus preparation was considered partially purified. For further purification the virus suspension was layered onto a preformed CsC1-TNE gradient (1.0606-1.2886g/cm 3) and centrifuged at 55,000 x g for 20 h. Bands were collected as described above, concentrated, and resuspended in TNE buffer.\n\nTo minimize loss of virus, BCV-L 9 was directly concentrated from D2BFS cells, which produce low yields of virus in the absence of trypsin. D2BFS cells in 150 cm 2 flasks were infected with BCV-L 9 at an MOI of approximately 0.1 PFU/cell. After absorption, cells were washed 3 times to remove unadsorbed virus. MEM was added to one set of flasks, and MEM with 5 ~tg/ml trypsin (Difco; 1 : 250) was added to the other set. Flasks were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 3 days, then frozen at -70\u00b0C, thawed, and the cell lysate was pooled. Fluid was clarified at 10,000 x g for 20 rain to remove cell material, then concentrated as described.\n\nWashed cells in 1 5 0 c m 2 flasks were frozen at -70\u00b0C, thawed, and cell lysate was collected in centrifuge tubes. Cell lysate was sonicated for 1 min, then the suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min to settle nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 90,000 x g for 2 h, and the pellet was resuspended in TNE buffer.\n\nAliquots of partially purified virus preparations were treated with 1 gg/ml trypsin (Sigma, TPCK treated) in Dulbecco's PBS at 37\u00b0C for 30 rain. The action of trypsin was stopped by the addition of 1 gg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) and incubation at 4\u00b0C for 30min. The virus suspension was centrifuged through a 2ml 20% sucrose-TNE cushion at 90,000 \u00d7 g for 2 h. Pellets were resuspended to original volume in TNE buffer.\n\nSodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of virus samples was done using the Laemmli buffer system [14] in the presence or absence of the reducing agent, 13-mercaptoethanol. Gels containing 10 or 12% bis-acrylamide were prepared in 1 mm thickness, and run at a constant power of 4 watts/gel (approximately 25 mA/gel) for 3-4 h. BioRad low and high molecular weight standards ranging from 14,400 to 200,000 daltons were used. Proteins were visualized using the BioRad silver stain kit developed according to the procedure of Merrill et al. [16] or by Western blotting.\n\nWestern blots were done according to a modification of the procedure of Burnette [1] . Briefly, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using Tris-glycine transfer buffer (20mM Tris base, 150mM glycine), pH 8.3. Electrophoretic transfer was carried out for 18 to 20h at 35volts at 10 to 15\u00b0C. Transferred proteins were stained with Ponceau S [17] , and molecular weight markers were cut off and saved for use in determining molecular weights of viral proteins. Transferred viral proteins were localized by incubating bovine anticoronavirus serum with blotted nitrocellulose membranes for 16 to 18h. Goat antibovine IgG (H + L chain) peroxidase conjugate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) was used. Membranes were developed by reacting with substrate consisting of 15mg 4-chloro 1naphthol dissolved in 5 ml methanol, followed by addition of 25 ml 0.05 M Tris pH 6.8, and 12 gl H202.\n\nThe polypeptide profiles of BCV-L 9, partially purified from HRT-18 clones D2, 3E3, 3F3, and 4B3 were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1) . We observed cell-dependent differences in virus structure. Under non-reducing conditions viral proteins of 185, 160, 140, 125, 110, 100, 52, 46, 37, 31-34, and 26-28 kd were detected from clones 3E3 and 3F3. However, the 46 kd protein was absent in BCV purified from clone 4 B 3. Doublet bands of 110 and 100 kd were found with BCV obtained from clones 3F3, 3E3, and 4B3, but only a single 100 kd band was present in virus from clone D2. To illustrate this finding, the profiles of BCV propagated in clones D2 and 3F3 are compared in Fig. 2 . The viral structural proteins thus follow the characteristic pattern of high, intermediate and low molecular weight of coronaviruses.\n\n] shared common proteins of 185, 160, 140, 100, 52, 37, and 31-34kd (Fig. 3) . Notable structural differences included the following: A > 200 kd protein was found in D2BFS-produced virus, but not in virus obtained from HRT-18 cells. The 185kd protein was present a high concentration in BCV(D2BFS), but in proportion to the other proteins comprising the profile, it was present at low concentration in BCV(HRT-18).\n\nSilver staining was the technique employed for discerning reduced proteins because we observed diminished binding of antibody to reduced viral proteins (Fig. 1 ). Viral proteins of 140 and 100 kd, consistently present under non-reducing conditions, were seen as 95 and 65 kd proteins under reducing conditions. Three distinct bands of 23, 20, and 18 kd were converted to a cluster of bands ranging from 20-23 kd following reduction (Fig. 4) . We confidently identified reduced proteins of 190 and 65kd by Western blot (Fig. 1) .\n\nPurified, HRT-18-cell-propagated BCV was treated in vitro with trypsin. The profiles of untreated and trypsin-treated BCV were examined under non-reducing and reducing conditions (Fig. 4) . In the absence of reducing agent, the profiles were identical. Detectable bands had molecular weights of 140, 100, 52, 27, 23, 20, and 18kd. Differences in the electrophoretic migration of trypsin-treated and untreated viral proteins were evident only under reducing conditions. A 95 kd protein was found in non-trypsinized virions, while a 90 kd protein was found in trypsin-treated virions. Additionally, a cluster of 20-23 kd proteins was found in untreated virions, but this cluster changed in trypsin-treated virions to 19-23 kd with the emergence of an additional 17 kd protein.\n\nBCV-L 9, propagated in D2BFS cells in the presence and absence of trypsin, was analyzed under non-reducing conditions by Western blotting (Fig. 5) . Virus propagated without trypsin had the following profile: > 200, 185, 140, 100, 52, 46, 37, and a 31-34 kd cluster. In the presence of trypsin, the 185kd protein was significantly diminished in concentration with a concommitant increase of the 100 kd protein. An additional difference between the profiles was the absence of the 31-34 kd cluster in trypsin-treated virus. \n\nWe identified host cell-dependent differences in the polypeptide profile of BCV-L9. Notably, the 185kd protein was present in high concentration in virus propagated in D2BFS cells, but it was present in low concentration in virus obtained from HRT-18 parent cells and clones. These findings are in agreement with those of Deregt et al. [5] who reported that gp 190 was present in low concentration in the Quebec BCV isolate propagated in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells. A 100-110 kd doublet band was detected in BCV propagated in clones 3F3, 3E3, and 4B3, but only the 100 kd species was evident in BCV from clone D2. This difference may reflect a variation in processing or in glycosylation of the protein. Other investigators reported that HRT-18-propagated BCV (Mebus strain) contains predominantly 120 and 100kd proteins which are cleaved forms of gp 190 [8, 12] . Our demonstration of a doublet band of 100l l0kd concurs with the results of Deregt et al. [5] . These scientists reported that cleavage of gp 190 yields two comigrating gp 100 species. Glycoprotein staining of these blots using concanavalin A and peroxidase [4] indicated that the 100 kd protein was glycosylated. A 46 kd protein reacting with antibody was evident in virus raised in all cell lines except clone 4B3 and D2BFS. It was not detected in Western blots of uninfected cells. Silver-stained gels revealed that the 140 and 100 kd proteins, present under non-reducing conditions, disappeared under reducing conditions. At the same time, proteins of 95 kd and 65 kd appeared in the presence of a reducing agent. Similar findings were reported by Deregt et al. [5] . Hogue and coworkers [-7] found that the 140 kd species consists of disulfide-linked subunits of 65 kd, but they did not observe a change in the electrophoretic migration of the 100kd species under reducing conditions. The 18, 20, and 23 kd group of proteins was converted to a 20-23 kd cluster by reduction. Western blotting also revealed a change in the electrophoretic mobility of the 185 kd to a 190 kd protein under reducing conditions. Rather than consisting of disulfide-linked subunits, the 185 and 100 kd molecules and the 18-23 kd group of proteins possibly contain intrachain disulfide bonding. Reduction could alter the migration pattern of the proteins by breaking the intrachain bonds under this assumption.\n\nSilver staining was a superior method to Western blotting for the detection of reduced viral proteins. Due to a change in antibody binding affinity of reduced proteins, an extended reaction time in the substrate was required to visualize reduced proteins. This condition led to a high background, making it difficult to discern the viral protein bands.\n\nThe native form of the BCV is the disease-causing agent in natural infections of calves. Consequently, it was considered more important to focus on the nonreduced profile of BCV. The use of antiserum obtained from a BCV-infected calf in Western blot identified the antigenically active components of the virus.\n\nWe observed differences in the number of detectable viral proteins and their relative migration patterns between preparations that were silver stained or Western blotted. These differences emphasize the relevance of the techniques chosen for detection of viral proteins. The use of different detection methods may explain discrepancies in the reported profiles of this virus [5, 8, 12, 13, 23] .\n\nWe demonstrated that trypsin has an enhancing effect on the cytopathic expression and infectivity of BCV in cultures of HRT-18 and D2BFS cells [20; St. Cyr-Coats et al., submitted]. Therefore, we examined the effect of the enzyme on the structure of this virus. Interestingly, the action of trypsin on the virus structure was evident by silver stain only under reducing conditions. This finding indicates that trypsin-cleaved peptides were held intact by disulfide bonds. When reduced by 13-mercaptoethanol, cleavage products were separable. Trypsin-dependent bands of 90 kd and 17 kd were detected in HRT-18 cell-propagated virus and the 20-23 kd cluster found in untreated virions was converted to a 19-23 kd cluster by trypsin.\n\nWe examined the polypeptide structure of BCV-L 9 propagated in D2BFS cells with and without trypsin because these infected cells fuse only in the presence of trypsin [20] . This system provided a potential model for determining the viral protein(s) responsible for cell fusion. We found that the 185 kd protein was present in high concentration in the absence of trypsin, but only a faint band was present in virus produced with trypsin. Concommitantly, the concentration of the 100kd species was much higher in the presence of trypsin. These results agree with those reported by Deregt et al. [5] who demonstrated that gp 100 is a proteolytic cleavage product ofgp 190. We conclude that cleavage of the 185 kd protein to the 100 kd form is required for activation of cell fusion. Trypsin was required to cleave this protein in D2BFS cells, but our data indicate that cellular enzymes cleave the 185 kd species in HRT-18 parent cells and the four HRT-18 clones. This finding is analogous to those reported by Frana et al. [6] who found that cleavage of the 180 kd protein of MHV-A 59 by a cellular protease or by trypsin activates the fusing capacity of that virus."}
