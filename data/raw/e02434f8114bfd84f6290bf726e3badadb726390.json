{"title": "Antibiotics", "body": "After 60 years of availability of antibiotics, surprisingly little is known about their role in obstructive airway diseases. A review of antibiotic therapy will necessarily involve a discussion of the role of bacterial infection in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This chapter presents an appraisal of the bacterial pathogens causing infective exacerbations, trials of antimicrobial therapy, individual antimicrobial agents and guidelines for their judicious use both in asthma and COPD.\n\nA causal relationship between respiratory tract infection, especially viral infection and exacerbations of bronchial asthma is well established in the medical literature. 1 In early prospective studies by McIntosh et al., 2 the relationship between exacerbations of wheezing and infection in hospitalized, previously diagnosed asthmatic children was investigated. A significant fraction (42%) was associated with viral respiratory infections, but not with pathogenic bacteria. Prospective studies on acute exacerbations of asthma in the adult population have suggested that approximately 10-20% of acute exacerbations may be attributable to acute viral infection. Berman and coworkers 3 convincingly failed to show an association between bacterial respiratory infection and asthma. Transtracheal aspirates from 27 adult asthmatic patients with acute exacerbations showed no correlation between bacterial isolates and asthma symptoms. This suggested that overt bacterial infection of the lower respiratory tract does not contribute to the exacerbation of asthma. However, studies of older children and young adults have shown that infection with atypical bacteria e.g. Mycoplasma and Chlamydia may be responsible for exacerbations. In these studies, rhinovirus was the most important pathogen, followed by influenza A virus, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia. [4] [5] [6] Several other studies have suggested a relationship between respiratory infections in infancy and development of asthma, although this hypothesis awaits more definite proof.\n\nMycoplasma pneumoniae infection is commonly seen in children and young adults, although it may occur in all age groups. 7, 8 Seggev et al. 9 showed that 21% of adults hospitalized with asthma exacerbation had evidence of a recent infection with mycoplasma. The illness may start with nonrespiratory symptoms such as headache and myalgias, and there is frequently pharyngitis and low-grade fever. A nonproductive cough, which tends to be prolonged and severe, is most characteristic. The diagnosis is made based on clinical history and chest radiograph, which shows patchy segmental pulmonary infiltrates. The definitive diagnosis is made by serological studies, particularly a doubling titer in convalescence. Antibiotic therapy is most effective if given within a few days of onset. Erythromycin or tetracycline are equally effective, and treatment is continued for 2-3 weeks. As well as causing exacerbations of asthma, M. pneumoniae pneumonia in nonasthmatics may well induce bronchial hyperresponsiveness which may be transient or persistent. 10 \n\nThe TWAR strain of Chlamydia (Chlamydia pneumoniae) has been shown to be a common cause of atypical pneumonia and is next in frequency to Mycoplasma. 11, 12 This is an infection primarily of adolescents and adults. The clinical manifestations are similar to those caused by M. pneumoniae. The severity of illness can be quite variable. The diagnosis is difficult to make, as commercial serological tests are generally not available. Chest radiograph shows findings similar to M. pneumoniae infection. Several studies have suggested that C. pneumoniae infection may precipitate acute bronchospasm and, in addition, may also be a risk factor for the development of chronic bronchospasm. The treatment of C. pneumoniae infection requires further study, but erythromycin or tetracycline may be beneficial if given for 10 days or more.\n\n\u2022 Childhood respiratory infections can predispose to the development of COPD in later life. 15 19, 20 The major bronchi and smaller conducting airways in normal humans are relatively sterile. In a study of 25 normal subjects, samples from multiple sites in the lower respiratory tract were obtained with a protected brush specimen. Most cultures contained bacteria (38 out of 52 specimens, or 73%) similar to those found in the nasopharynx, but the colony counts were often so low (none to five colonies per culture plate) that the cultures probably indicated upper respiratory tract contamination rather than true lower respiratory tract colonization. 21 The nasopharyngeal bacteria may be transiently aerosolized or aspirated into the lower respiratory tract but are removed by mucociliary clearance or cough. Pathogenic aerobic Gram-negative rods do not inhabit the upper airways mucosa in normal persons, but may do with alterations in health status such as alcoholism, diabetes, residing in a health-care facility. 22 Subconscious aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions allows these microbes to enter the lower airways and alveoli and become a nidus for subsequent infection.\n\nPathogenic bacteria can be cultured from bronchial washings of some 82% of chronic bronchitics compared with normal bronchi which are nearly always sterile. 23 Routine sputum cultures obtained from patients with chronic bronchitis commonly contain nonencapsulated H. influenzae and Strep. pneumoniae. In most clinical series, one or both of these species have been recovered from approximately 30 to 50% of sputum specimens in patients with chronic bronchitis, and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 17% of transtracheal aspirate specimens. 24 Airway colonization with H. influenzae and Strep. pneumoniae is of uncertain significance. These bacteria tend to be present in sputum during quiescent intervals although the frequency of their recovery is increased during acute infectious episodes. Development of purulent sputum is not specifically correlated with the presence of one or the other of these bacteria in quantitative cultures.\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECB). AECB is basically a clinical diagnosis. A descriptive definition could be: \"an acute, episodic deterioration superimposed on stable COPD with increased dyspnea, reduced daily performance, with or without changes in sputum volume and color, coughing, or body temperature; and/or alterations in mental status\". 17, 18 The three cardinal symptoms ( These features should be present without an objectively documented cause such as pneumonia, congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia, upper respiratory tract infection, recurrent aspiration and pulmonary embolism. These conditions may resemble an acute exacerbation and need to be excluded.\n\nMicrobiological data may play a role in diagnosis and management but must be interpreted with caution. One problem 574 Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is that pathogenic bacteria can be cultured from respiratory secretions in as many as 80% of patients with stable chronic bronchitis, therefore, bacterial colonization complicates the laboratory diagnosis of bacterial infection.\n\nThe sputum Gram stain has been advocated as a means of objectively demonstrating an increase in bacterial flora and bronchial inflammation. In one study, Baigelman et al. 26 compared more than 1000 sputum Gram stains from patients with chronic bronchitis during stable states, acute bacterial infections, acute allergic exacerbations, and recovery from acute bacterial exacerbations. The results showed that fewer than two bacteria per oil-immersion field were found in stable patients, while during exacerbations the sputum revealed 12 organisms per oil-immersion field resembling H. influenzae, eight organisms resembling Strep. pneumonia or 18 organisms resembling M. catarrhalis. Over 99% of patients with chronic bronchitis without clinical evidence of infection fell below these thresholds.These findings suggest that an upper limit may be set for the numbers of micro-organisms seen on a Gram stain of sputum from patients with COPD in the absence of a bacterial infection. Some clinical trials have incorporated the Gram stain as a means of distinguishing bacterial from nonbacterial causes of acute exacerbation. Despite its potential, sputum Gram stain does not alter therapy and is not currently recommended as a routine test.\n\nThe routine sputum culture is less useful than the Gram stain and is often misleading. Studies examining sputum cultures before, during, and after bacterial exacerbations have correlated poorly with clinical parameters and Gram stain results. 26, 27 Gram-negative bacilli have often been recovered in sputum culture even when they are absent on Gram stain, and clinical recovery has occurred even without specific Gram-negative antibiotic therapy. In one study, more than 50% of sputum cultures remained positive long after clinical recovery. 28 The sputum culture may be contributory and should be considered when there is:\n\n\u2022 failure of initial antibiotic therapy, \u2022 patients with chronic bronchial sepsis requiring more than four courses of antibiotic therapy per year, \u2022 severe illness or suspected pneumonia.\n\nViruses apparently do not play an important role in causing acute exacerbations. Therefore, virological stains, cultures and antibody assays are not routinely recommended in the management of chronic bronchitis because of the expense and relatively low yield. Rapid antigen detection has lowered the turnaround time for identifying respiratory viruses, but the value of these tests in AECB has not been established. Recently chemotherapeutic agents for influenza have become available. The guidelines for use of anti-influenza agents recommend early use of these agents based on clinical suspicion and not laboratory confirmation, and COPD patients should probably be treated in the same manner.\n\nChest radiograph Chest X-rays are not routinely recommended in mild to moderate exacerbations, as there is usually no change from baseline. Chest radiography should be performed if the patient has high fever, new abnormalities on auscultation, or is severely ill as characterized by worsening hypoxia, hypercapnia or right heart failure.\n\nCOPD is characterized by periodic exacerbations, and acute respiratory infection was the most common cause of death in a prospective study of patients with COPD. 29 The role of infection in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis is, however, somewhat controversial. Antibiotics are frequently prescribed to these patients but efficacy of this treatment was questioned by Tager and Speizer. 30 Several investigators have found increased numbers of bacteria and neutrophils in the sputum during exacerbations. [31] [32] [33] In some studies 34 M. pneumoniae has been isolated in 1 to 10% of patients with acute infections. Bacteria may be the primary cause of the exacerbations; alternatively, they may act as secondary invaders after acute viral or mycoplasma infection. However, evaluating the role of bacterial infection in exacerbations has been a difficult task for a variety of reasons. As the upper airways of many patients with COPD are colonized by H. influenzae, Strep. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis, the expectorated sputum during exacerbations may be inconclusive.\n\nA causal relationship between bacterial infection and acute exacerbation can be inferred by the appearance of an acute antibody response in serum to these bacteria. Documenting a serological response to an organism may demonstrate existence of infection with that organism, but these studies have shown conflicting results. Some have shown no difference between patients with chronic bronchitis and control subjects, other studies have revealed higher titers of antibody to H. influenzae, 35 in the serum of patients with chronic bronchitis. However, there was no relationship of titers to exacerbations. 36 Such studies generally used the whole organism preparations of unrelated strains as the antigen for serologic studies, and therefore measured a mixture of antibodies to a mixture of antigens. Future studies may utilize antibody response to more specific surface antigens of bacteria to establish the importance of bacterial infection in COPD.\n\nAnother approach to assessing the role of bacterial infection in exacerbations of COPD is to consider the effect of antibiotics on the clinical response (Figs 54.1 and 54.2) . A positive response to a specific antibiotic prescribed for an exacerbation by a specific organism would provide evidence of a pathogenic role for the bacteria. In a landmark study, Anthonisen and co-workers 25 demonstrated, for the first time, that patients could be stratified according to the symptoms to predict a response to antimicrobial therapy. In patients with at least two of the three cardinal symptoms of acute exacerbation (increased sputum purulence, increased sputum volume and increased dyspnea), broad-spectrum antibiotics (amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline) led to improved clinical outcomes, fewer therapeutic failures and a more rapid rate of lung function recovery than did placebo. Overall, the length of illness was 2 days shorter for the antibiotic-treated group as compared with the placebo group. A meta-analysis by Saint et al. 37 showed that there were benefits from antibiotic therapy for exacerbations as compared with placebo ( Fig. 54.3) . In nine prospective randomized trials conducted from 1957 to 1992, the overall effect size (defined as the standard deviation of benefit with therapy versus placebo for the effect measured) favored antibiotics (0.22), and seven of the nine trials showed a benefit for antibiotics. A beneficial effect of antibiotics was demonstrated in studies that included the greatest number of patients and the patients with more severe disease. The demonstration of therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics in exacerbations provides evidence of a pathogenic role for bacteria in exacerbations. Design flaws in the earlier studies, such as small numbers of study patients, unclear selection criteria, uncertain microbiology, nonstandard evaluation criteria and lack of stratification of patients, may account for the discrepancy of outcomes in these studies. 38 Although antibiotics provide benefit compared with placebo, further studies are required to assess different classes of antibiotics in specific clinical situations. Several studies have suggested that patients with different severities of chronic lung disease have exacerbations with different organisms. Eller et al. 39 found that if patients with better lung function were compared with those with worse lung function (based on FEV 1 ), the bacteriology shifted from pneumococcus and H. influenzae to more complex organisms such as Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species. Similarly, Miravitlles et al. 40 found that H. influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more common in patients with FEV 1 values of less than 50% of predicted.The patients with worse lung function suffered from more frequent exacerbations and were given repeated antibiotic therapy which likely led to alteration of airway microbial flora.\n\nAsthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease \n\nAcute exacerbations of COPD are most often caused by infections although other factors may also cause increased dyspnea. Common infectious etiological organisms will be briefly discussed (Table 54. 2).\n\nStudies of longitudinal cohorts of COPD patients have examined the role of viruses in acute exacerbations with serial serology and viral cultures of upper and lower respiratory tract secretions. A four-fold increase in titer or a positive viral culture was seen in association with one trial of exacerbations. 41, 42 The specific viruses and proportion of exacerbations caused by each of these are detailed in \n\nAs these organisms are difficult to culture, serological testing has been used to investigate the role of Chlamydia and Mycoplasma species in acute exacerbations of COPD.\n\nMycoplasma infection has been seen only rarely in this setting. C. pneumoniae infection is associated with 5 to 10% of exacerbations. In the study presented by Soler and associates 43 of severe exacerbations requiring intensive care, C. pneumoniae infection was present in seven (18%) of 38 cases, although a concomitant bacterial pathogen was present in two of these patients.\n\nSputum cultures are positive for aerobic bacteria in about half of the exacerbations of COPD. 44 The predominant pathogens and their relative frequency are listed in 43 demonstrated that 21 of 50 (42%) patients had positive cultures on bronchoscopic samples during an acute exacerbation. In their study, there was a remarkably high incidence of P. aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacilli, these were isolated in 28% (14/50) of patients.\n\nBased on the remarkably consistent results of these studies, one can conclude that bacteria are recovered in the distal airways in exacerbations of COPD in 50% of the cases and may be responsible for the clinical symptoms observed (Table 54.3) .\n\nA considerable body of evidence in the medical literature highlights the importance of bacterial infection and the usefulness of antimicrobial therapy. Cole and Wilson used this evidence to construct the vicious circle hypothesis (Fig.  54.4) . 54 According to this hypothesis, initiating factors such as cigarette smoke lead to impaired mucociliary clearance in the airways. This is followed by bacterial colonization and release of bacterial products such as lipooligosaccharides, causing direct damage to airway epithelium and inhibiting mucociliary activity.The neutrophils are attracted by chemotactic bacterial factors released by resident phagocytes, complement components, and directly by chemotactic bacterial products. A destructive, cytokine-mediated inflammatory host response is triggered, which enhances the elastolytic activity in the lung, ultimately causing further airway damage. The impairment of the host defense mechanisms predispose to further bacterial infection, thereby establishing the self-perpetuating vicious circle of host and bacterialmediated respiratory tract damage. Previous studies could not demonstrate a role for respiratory infections in the progression of airways obstruction. [55] [56] [57] However, Kanner et al. 58 have recently demonstrated that more rapid decline in lung function occurred with more frequent respiratory tract infections. They found that smokers with mild to moderate COPD suffered from increased numbers of lower respiratory infections as compared with quitters. In addition, one infection per year was associated with an increase in decline of FEV 1 of about 7 mL per year. 59 Recently, Seemungal et al. 60 prospectively followed a cohort of 101 patients with moderate to severe COPD over a 2 year period. In 7.1% of exacerbations, recovery of lung function (PEFR) had not occurred in 91 days. 60 Although this model of pathogenesis is popular, more clinical studies and applications of newer techniques are required to study these proposed mechanisms of \"Vicious Circle Hypothesis\".\n\nAsthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease \n\nAnnual influenza vaccine reduces morbidity and mortality due to influenza in the elderly by 50% 53 and should be given to patients with COPD.The beneficial effect is thought to be the result of prevention of airway epithelial damage predisposing the patient to subsequent bacterial infection. 61 The beneficial effect of pneumococcal vaccine in patients with chronic bronchitis has not been firmly established. However, the current recommendations are that patients with COPD receive pneumococcal vaccine at least once in their life and should have one repeat at 5 years. 62 It is a prudent policy to follow because of the low cost and few side-effects of the vaccine.\n\nOnly a limited number of studies have examined the role of prophylactic antibiotics in COPD. 63, 64 In one study of patients with moderate COPD no benefit from prophylactic antibiotics was found with respect to the frequency of exacerbations or to the rate of decline of FEV 1 over 4 or 5 years. 65 In another large study, no benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis during the winter months was observed. 66 The prophylactic use of antibiotics in chronic bronchitis is not supported by clinical trials and is not indicated. Such therapy runs the risk of increasing antimicrobial resistance in the bacterial pathogens responsible for infections. 65, 66 \n\nThere are a large number of antibiotics available to cover the spectrum of bacteria causing COPD exacerbations. It is useful to classify them as first-and second-line agents ( [70] [71] [72] A substantial proportion of bacterial exacerbations of COPD may be caused by pathogens resistant to the traditional antibiotics such as amoxicillin, co-trimoxazole, and tetracycline. Therefore, local patterns of antimicrobial resistance should be considered in choosing empiric therapy for this common mucosal infection.\n\nThere are profound differences in the penetration of different antibiotics into the tissues and secretions of the respiratory tract, and the implications of these factors for the treatment of exacerbations of chronic bronchitis deserve consideration. Outcome of antimicrobial therapy may depend to a certain extent on the sputum and bronchial mucosal concentration of these agents. 73 In general, \u03b2lactams attain only 5 to 25% of the serum concentration in 74, 75 Azithromycin is concentrated 50-to 100-fold in sputum as well as bronchial secretions. 76 However, the clinical significance of good penetration into sputum and bronchial tissue has not been demonstrated in AECB.\n\nMany of the original trials of antibiotic therapy utilized tetracyclines. Studies performed in the 1960s and 1970s demonstrated that tetracycline therapy was more effective than placebo in milder infections, while derivatives were no more effective than tetracycline itself. Tetracyclines can be used in AECB because they are active against H. influenzae and atypical pathogens, but there have been reports of increasing resistance against pneumococci. 77 Oral penicillins and cephalosporins Although early placebo-controlled studies did not show a definite advantage for therapy with ampicillin, amoxicillin has been a widely used agent for management of AECB. 78 Oral penicillins and cephalosporins are the drugs of choice in patients with mild to moderate exacerbations in countries where resistance among H. influenzae and pneumococci remains at low levels. Despite their relatively poor activity and suboptimal respiratory pharmacokinetics, cephalexin and cefaclor have been extensively used for the management of AECB. The newer cephalosporins, cefprozil, and cefixime may have some advantages such as activity against resistant pneumococci, but have not been proven to be superior to amoxicillin, 79,80 when organisms were fully sensitive to both agents.\n\nThe addition of clavulanic acid makes the combination resistant to bacterial beta-lactamases, an important concern in patients with AECB. Although most studies of patients with lower respiratory tract infection have shown it to be equivalent to standard comparable agents. 81 An overview of the data from clinical trials demonstrates this to be a valuable agent for infections caused by H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis even though the degree of penetration of bronchial mucosa is variable. 82 Comparison with cefixime and ciprofloxacin showed greater clinical success but no significant difference in eradication rates. 83 Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole Although very popular in the 1970s and 1980s trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) potential for resistance and the increasing availability of safer agents have resulted in the decline of the use of this antibiotic. In older studies, comparisons with oral cephalosporins generally showed equivalent efficacy. 84 Recent studies have shown increased resistance of common respiratory pathogens to TMP-SMX in Europe and the United States, making this antibiotic less useful in the treatment of AECB. Penicillinresistant pneumococci have an 80 to 90% likelihood of being resistant to TMP-SMX. 85 Newer macrolides and azalides Erythromycin has poor activity against H. influenzae (MIC 4 to 8 mg/L) and cannot be considered one of the drugs of choice for AECB. Azithromycin and clarithromycin have improved pharmacokinetics and antibacterial activity. 86 A 3-day regimen of azithromycin is clinically and microbiologically equivalent to a 10-day course of coamoxiclav. 87 The significant advantages of azithromycin are enhanced potency against H. influenzae, once daily administration, an abbreviated 4-day course, and perhaps a reduced frequency of relapse during extended followup. 88, 89 Clarithromycin has only intermediate activity against H. influenzae but synergy with a metabolite reduces the overall MIC to around 1 mg/L so thus in the therapeutic range. 90 Clinical studies of clarithromycin involving 7-to 14-day regimens in patients with mild to moderate infections have shown equivalence with ampicillin. 81 A direct comparison with azithromycin and clarithromycin showed no difference in response rates or adverse reactions. 91\n\nThese agents penetrate well into the respiratory secretions and bronchial mucosa, but clinical relevance is uncertain. Fluoroquinolones are highly active against \u03b2-lactamase producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, and therefore are effective in AECB. Despite a relatively high inhibitory concentration against Strep. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin demonstrated clinical efficacy similar to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and cefuroxime. 92 A variety of newer fluoroquinolones with longer half-lives has become recently available. The newer agents have enhanced activity against pneumococci compared with ciprofloxacin, thus making them an effective therapy in the management of moderate to severe exacerbations.\n\nNewer antimicrobial agents have been studied to show equivalence with regimens that have already been approved. Consequently, there are few data showing that one agent is better than the other, because trials have not been designed with this goal in mind. However, there are several theoretical characteristics that would be desirable in selecting an antibiotic:\n\n\u2022 activity against the most common and most likely etiological pathogens; \u2022 resistance to destruction by \u03b2-lactamase; \u2022 good penetration into the sputum and bronchial mucosa; \u2022 a mechanism of action that does not add to inflammatory events in the airway; \u2022 easy to take, with few side-effects; \u2022 cost effective.\n\nPatients with COPD who have poor ventilatory reserve may develop acute respiratory failure as a consequence of an exacerbation. For this reason, it is prudent to identify this high-risk population for whom an aggressive approach can be applied to prevent deterioration. Mechanical ventilation is required in 20 to 60% of these patients and hospital mortality of 10 to 30% has been reported. 93 Factors reported to be associated with increased hospital mortality include age greater than 65 years, comorbid respiratory and nonrespiratory organ dysfunction, and admission to an intensive care unit. 94 The other factors linked to poor survival are severity of airways obstruction, performance status, and use of oral corticosteriods. 95 Following antibiotic therapy for AECB, factors predicting failure of initial therapy (returning to the physician for more treatment), or the need for hospitalization include co-existent cardiopulmonary disease and the number of previous exacerbations. The presence of cardiovascular comorbidity combined with more than four exacerbations in the previous year has a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 37% in predicting treatment failure. 96 Therefore, advanced age, significant impairment of lung function, poor performance status, comorbid conditions, and history of previous frequent exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids characterize a high-risk group. Because the cost of failure is high, an aggressive approach to treatment of this high-risk group may improve outcome. Therapy with first-line antibiotics fails in 13% to 25% of exacerbations. 97 Therapeutic failure increases cost of care due to extra physician visits, further diagnostic tests and repeated courses of antibiotics, more hospitalizations, and absence from work. Stratification of patients into risk categories may allow physicians to select appropriate antimicrobial therapy to prevent these consequences in an era of increasing resistance to standard therapy.\n\nSeveral stratification schemes have been proposed to improve initial microbial selection. In 1991, Lode 98 proposed that patients be divided into three groups:\n\n\u2022 First-degree patients have a relatively short duration of chronic bronchitis with a normal lung function and are infected with the usual pathogens H. influenzae and Strep. pneumoniae. These patients could be treated with oral amoxicillin, doxycycline, co-trimoxazole or a macrolide. \u2022 Second-degree patients have a longer history of COPD, several exacerbations each year and impaired lung function. Use of oral cephalosporins, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, or quinolones was proposed. \u2022 The third-degree patients were described as hospitalized patients with significant comorbidity, prolonged history of COPD and severe functional impairment. These patients have frequent infections with Gram-negative pathogens or resistant H. influenzae and Strep. pneumoniae. In hospitalized patients, therapy with intravenous cephalosporins or quinolones is suggested, followed by oral therapy with cephalosporins, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, or quinolones.\n\nIn 1994, Balter et al. 99 suggested that patients should be categorized into five groups.\n\n\u2022 Group 1: acute simple bronchitis likely viral induced with no previous respiratory problems. Antibiotic therapy was not recommended for this group unless symptoms persisted for more than 1 week. \u2022 Group 2: simple chronic bronchitis with minimal or no impairment of pulmonary function and without any risk factors. Treatment was recommended for patients who have type 1 and type 2 exacerbations. Any antibiotic from the list of first-line agents was suggested as consequences of treatment failure would be few ( \n\nThe authors propose a simpler risk stratification scheme modified from the publications of Wilson, 100 catarrhalis continue to be the predominant organisms. However, since initial treatment failure has major implications, treatment with medications directed towards resistant organisms should be used. The second-line agents such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, second-or third-generation cephalosporins, the second-generation macrolides or fluoroquinolones are recommended. \u2022 Occasional patients with chronic bronchial sepsis are characterized by repeated exacerbations and often require multiple hospitalizations with respiratory failure. They have poor lung function, are at risk for Pseudomonas infection, and have a poor prognosis. Therefore an aggressive therapeutic approach can be justified. Empirical therapy using a quinolone with anti-pseudomonal activity and the use of sputum culture in this group of patients to identify possible resistant organisms may be employed.\n\nAll the proposed classification systems although not prospectively tested in clinical trials, place emphasis on identifying high-risk populations so that they can be treated from onset, with antibiotics targeted to the potential resistant organisms in order to reduce the risk of treatment failure (Fig. 54.5) .\n\nCost-effectiveness in the treatment of COPD exacerbations is of utmost significance in the modern-day practice of medicine. Pharmaco-economic analysis involves determining the extra costs required to achieve an additional unit of clinical benefit. In AECB, therapeutic failure is associated with much higher costs, thus identification of subgroups of patients likely to fail low-cost therapy is important. Various techniques including modeling studies, retrospective analysis of data bases, and prospective randomized pharmacoeconomic clinical trials have been developed to examine these issues. A retrospective study by Destache and colleagues 582 Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease showed that the use of newer antibiotics (cephalosporins, macrolides and fluoroquinolones) when compared with first-line agents, reduced overall costs of treating patients despite higher initial acquisition costs. 103 The Canadian Ciprofloxacin Health Economic Study Group 104 randomized patients with more than three exacerbations to receive either ciprofloxacin or any nonquinolone-based therapy.The study measured clinical endpoints (days of illness, hospitalizations, time to next exacerbation) blended with quality of life measurements and total respiratory costs. The use of ciprofloxacin in patients with a history of moderate to severe bronchitis and at least four AECB in the previous year offered substantial clinical and economic benefits. Additional future prospective studies are required to determine if the newer antimicrobial agents offer advantages in terms of costs, quality of life and clinical efficacy.\n\nFurther research is required to find new ways to distinguish between colonization and infective exacerbations of COPD in order to gain a better understanding of the role of infection in the disease.With advances in molecular biology, antigenic structures of bacteria and evaluation of the antibody response to these antigens may become the basis for identifying an AECB. Future therapies may also be directed towards the inflammatory process within the airways that damages the airway mucosa and that leads to greater colonization by pathogenic bacteria. Specific anti-inflammatory mediators directed against various cytokines may interrupt the progressive deterioration of lung function. 105 Most clinical trials of antibiotics were performed for licensing, and patients with pathogens resistant to different antimicrobials were excluded. Further comparative trials showed clinical equivalence and not superiority. Future studies of new antimicrobials should examine clinical efficacy more stringently based on a classification system that would help select patients most likely to benefit from an antibiotic such as those falling in the last two categories in Table 54 .5, and should only include patients with Winnipeg type I criteria.\n\nThese studies should also include well-defined prospective economic analyses and quality of life assessment to ascertain the cost utility of the antibiotic in question."}
