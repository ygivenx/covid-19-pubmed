As of March 5, 2020 , there are more than 95 thousand reported cases of COVID-19, and greater then 3000 deaths wordwide. 2 Given the race against time, identifying drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical to adequately respond to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. 3 The \"one drug, multiple viruses\" paradigm came with the discovery of broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs), small-molecules that inhibit a wide range of human viruses 1 is even more pertinent today with outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, Dengue, influenza and other viral infections, especially the 2019-nCoV. Since 2019-nCoV is 75 to 80% identical to the SARS-CoV and even more closely related to several bat coronaviruses 4 , molecules such as Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Remdesivir, fusion peptide (EK1), abidol, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as TDF, 3TC), IFN-alpha, Chinese traditional medicine, such ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen capsule, are potential treatment options against this emerging virus. However, the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 2019-nCoV require confirmation by clinical experiments. 3 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is frequently encountered in the general population and is a risk for increased viral morbidity. Approximately 15% of US adults (37 million people) are estimated to have CKD [https://www.cdc.gov/kidneydisease/publications-resources/2019-national-facts.html]. During the first 2 months of the current outbreak in China, CKD was reported in 4.3% of the 2019-nCov Chinese infected-patients with severe presentation. 5 End-stage kidney disease patients are a highly susceptible group with an infection rate of 16%, which exceeds that observed in other populations [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201v2].\n\nIn the context of the epidemic or pandemic of 2019-nCoV, these drugs will be prescribed to CKD and/or ESKD patients. Clinicians should thus be aware of the potential dosage adjustments and renal adverse events of those drugs in this patient group (table 1) . \n\nPhase IV Not available* AKI.
