{"title": "Chest Computed Tomography Abnormalities and Their Relationship to the Clinical Manifestation of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in a Genetically Confirmed Outbreak", "body": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is well known as a virus causing lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants and immunocompromised adults (1) (2) (3) . Bronchopneumonia patterns are common findings of RSV-induced LRTI (RSV-LRTI); however, RSV-LRTI often shows variable findings on chest imaging (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Although some factors, such as the virulence of RSV and host immune status, might affect the chest computed tomography (CT) findings of RSV-LRTI (12, 13) , the detailed mechanisms remain unknown.\n\nFrom this perspective, an RSV outbreak due to genetically identical RSV is an ideal setting for investigating the chest images of RSV-LRTI. Thus far, however, there has only been one report showing the chest images of RSV-LRTI in the outbreak setting (11) . In addition, reports inves-tigating the correlation between the clinical manifestations and abnormal findings on chest CT remain rare (14) .\n\nIn 2014, a genetically identical RSV outbreak occurred in the hemato-oncology ward of the University of the Ryukyus Hospital (15) , and a subset of RSV-infected patients underwent both chest X-ray and CT during the outbreak. We herein report our analysis of the radiological findings and the clinical manifestations in the outbreak. +37days underwent both chest X-ray and CT during the outbreak.\n\nThe clinical information and chest X-ray findings were retrospectively reviewed from patient medical records within one week of the chest CT scan.\n\nThe medical records and radiological images of the collected cases were retrospectively reviewed, with identifying information removed. This study was reviewed and approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of University of the Ryukyus.\n\nThe patients' background characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory data, and findings from chest imaging are shown in Table. Seven cases (88%) received various immunosuppressive treatment, and none had airway diseases, such as bronchial asthma. Five cases (63%) had newly appearing abnormal findings on chest CT; however, no abnormal findings were detected by chest X-ray in 3 of those 5 patients (60%). Most cases had upper respiratory symptoms, including rhinitis and sore throat. However, lower respiratory symptoms, such as wheeze, sputum, and hypoxemia, were only seen in patients with newly appearing findings on chest CT. Bacterial culture for respiratory specimens was performed in six cases, and bacteria were detected in three cases; however, no patient was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia or treated with targeted antibiotics against these detected bacteria. In addition, no cases received antiviral therapy against RSV.\n\nChest CT findings for the five patients are shown in Figs. 1-5. The most common finding among these patients was bronchial wall thickenings; seen in 4 of 5 patients (80%). In terms of the findings in the parenchymal lesion, the patterns and distributions were varied and inconsistent. Two cases showed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) along the bronchi; however, the distribution differed, as one was a localized GGO and the other a multilobar GGO. One case showed ground-glass nodules with a tree-in-bud pattern. The remaining case showed diffuse GGOs with centrilobular septal thickening, also known as the \"crazy-paving\" pattern. Three cases underwent two or more CT scans during the course of their disease, and the abnormal findings on chest CT disappeared (Fig. 1, 2, 5 ).\n\nIn the present study, all patients who had lower respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, sputum, and hypoxemia, had abnormal findings on chest CT. Indeed, sputum and hypoxemia are included as criteria for LRTI disease according to the guideline for respiratory virus infection in leukemia patients (16) . In addition, all cases receiving chemotherapy for hematological malignancy also had abnormal findings on chest CT. This is probably associated with bone marrow suppression by cytotoxic anticancer drugs. Of note, lymphocytopenia and neutropenia are considered as risk factors for LRTI in RSV-infected cases (16) . Therefore, it might be advised to perform chest CT in order to examine the existence of LRTI for RSV-infected hematological malignancy patients with both a history of anticancer chemotherapy and lower respiratory symptoms.\n\nIn RSV-LRTI, CT is more sensitive for detecting pulmonary findings than chest X-ray (6), as a bronchopneumonia pattern is more common in RSV-LRTI than an alveolar pattern (5, 7, 11) , and chest X-ray rarely detects the findings of a bronchopneumonia pattern. The present study showed that a bronchopneumonia pattern was indeed the most common (case 2 and 3), and chest X-ray missed these abnormal findings in most cases. Therefore, chest CT, rather than X-ray, should be performed to confirm LRTI in RSV-infected patients with lower respiratory symptoms. However, chest Xray is appropriate for evaluating pulmonary overexpansion due to bronchiolitis in infants (17) . Although bronchiolitis caused by RSV is relatively common in infants (18), it is not common in adults (11, 19) . In fact, overexpansion due to bronchiolitis was not observed in any of our eight cases. This study shows no trends for abnormal chest findings, even in the outbreak setting, which is consistent with a pre- +20days vious report by Mayer et al. (11) . Several reasons may explain this. First, although the pathophysiology remains unknown, the host's immunological status might affect CT findings. Immune responses by lymphocytes and neutrophils are correlated with disease severity, which may affect the patterns of abnormal CT findings (13) . Indeed, the patients in our study had different primary diseases and received varying immunosuppressive therapies, as shown in the Table. Second, bacterial co-infection might affect the radiological findings. However, bronchioalveolar lavage fluid was collected from only one patient, and most specimens for bacterial culture were sputum; therefore, the possibility of contamination by oral bacteria could not be excluded. In addition, the bacteria detected in our study were uncommon pathogens for causing pneumonia. Indeed, no patient was treated with antibiotics targeting these detected bacteria. Although the influence of these bacteria on CT findings is unknown, it is possible that these pathogens were colonized, rather than co-infection, so their impact on CT might be limited.\n\nAlthough various findings are seen in patients with RSV-LRTI (9), many reports have shown that nodules and tree-inbud patterns are relatively common (5-8, 10). Kim et al. compared the CT findings among RSV, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus, demonstrating the frequent observation of bronchial wall thickening while consolidation and GGOs were rarely seen in RSV-LRTI compared to the other two viruses (4). Miller et al. reported that an airway-centric pattern, consisting of tree-in-bud opacities and bronchial wall thickening, was characteristic of RSV-LRTI compared to other respiratory viruses (9) . It has also been reported that nodules and tree-in-bud patterns were seen during the early phase of RSV pneumonia (9, 11) . Thus, although the findings and distributions for chest CT in cases 2, 3, and 4 varied, they were categorized as airway-centric patterns, and differences may exist due to the progression of disease. Case 4, which had tree-in-bud nodular opacities, progressed to respiratory failure after the CT scan, suggesting that these findings had been observed in the early phase of RSV pneumonia. Case 5 was initially diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary alveolar hemorrhaging due to the hemoptysis and crazy-paving pattern on chest CT. The crazy-paving pattern is uncommon for RSV-LRTI; however, a previous case report showed that RSV infection can present as a crazypaving pattern in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (20) .\n\nChest CT showed variable findings for RSV infection, even during an outbreak setting. In most cases, chest X-ray failed to detect abnormalities. In RSV-infected hematological malignancy patients receiving anticancer chemotherapy, lower respiratory symptoms may predict the existence of CT abnormalities due to RSV-LRTI."}
