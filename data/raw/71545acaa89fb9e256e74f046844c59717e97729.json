A25-\u03bclreaction was 116 set up containing 5 \u03bc l of RNA, 19 \u03bc l of reaction buffer provided with the one step RT-PCR 117 system and 1\u00b5l enzyme mix. Thermal cycling was performed at 45\u00b0C for 10 min for reverse 118 transcription followed by 95\u00b0C for 3 min and then 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 sec, 58 \u00b0C for 30 sec 119 in SLAN 96P real time PCR system. 120\n\nAnalysis of the dPCR data was performed with analysis software GeneCount V1.60b0318 122 (RainSure Scientific). Concentrations of the target RNA sequences, along with their Poisson-123 based 95% confidence intervals were also provided by the software. Fluorescence channels of 124 FAM, HEX and Cy5 were scanned to detect ORF1ab gene, N gene and RPP30 gene respectively. 125\n\nThe positive populations for each target gene were identified using positive and negative controls 126 with single primer-probe sets for each fluorescence channel. The concentration reported by 127 GeneCount has the unit of copies of template per microliter of the final 1\u00d7 dPCR reaction, which 128 was also reported and used in all the subsequent analysis. 129\n\n3.1. Comparison of the lower limit of detection between dPCR and the standard RT-PCR 131 L ower limit of detection (LLoD) of RT-PCR and dPCR was compared using serial dilution of clinical 132 specimen. The starting clinical specimen showed Ct value of 35 in RT-PCR. The specimen was diluted 133 using virus storage solution. Each dilution was 5 fold. A total of 7 dilutions (8 samples S1-S8 134 including the starting stock) were tested by both RT-PCR and dPCR assays. As shown in Figure 1 and 135 Table 2 RT-PCR failed to detect S3, while dPCR was able to detect S3 and S4. dPCR showed 136 negative results for S5 through S8. dPCR assay showed at least 10 times lower LLoD than RT-PCR 137 assay. However. LLoQ (lower limit of quantification) was estimated to be larger than the viral 138 concentration in S3. 139 All rights reserved.

When assessed with RT-PCR method, the result showed  142 reasonable consistency between different targets (Table 3) . 143\n\nResults from dPCR targeting ORF1ab gene were also consistent with that from RT-PCR result (Table  144 4). In particular, 4 positive samples from 3 patients based on dPCR assay were not detected by PCR. The computerized tomography (CT) results of the 3 patients showed 1 patient's lung texture 146 thickening, no pneumonia imaging characteristics; 1 patient had two lungs infections,; and 1 patient 147 showed inflammation of the right lung and lower lobe. But RT-PCR assay failed to detect these 4 148 samples, and generated negative results. 149\n\nDigital PCR targeting N gene exhibited higher sensitivity than that targeting ORF1ab gene. As shown 150 in to be positive based on other factors. One was a suspected case. One of them were of unknown clinical 153 classification. In particular, one was actually discharged based on RT-PCR assay result, although a 154 retrospective dPCR test detected the virus. In contrast, as long as a sample is deemed positive by 155\n\nORF1ab gene, all but one were positive by N gene. 156\n\nDigital PCR also provides a window to monitor the progression and treatment of disease more 158 consistently than RT-PCR. We analyzed positive samples from 3 patients based on dPCR assay that 159 were not consistently detected by Patient 33 was first identified as SAR-CoV-2 positive by RT-PCR from pharyngeal swab with 161\n\nORF1ab gene Ct of 32.3 and N gene Ct of 33.2 ( Table 6) . dPCR showed ORF1ab concentration of 162 28.3 copies/\u00b5l, N gene concentration of 35.2 copies/\u00b5l and internal reference gene concentration of 163 32.8 copies/\u00b5l on January 27, 2020 (Figure 2 and Table 6 ).

However, pharyngeal swabs were negative by 14 th to Feb. 25 th for all 6 RT-PCR tests performed. CT results showed infection of both lungs. 193 However, due to the negative RT-PCR results, the patient was categorized as a suspected case despite 194 her positive CT results and symptoms. Although dPCR showed negative result on Feb. 14 th , the day 195 after the patient intake, low SARS-CoV-2 viral load (ORF1ab gene concentration of 0.34 copies/\u00b5l and 196 N gene of 0.43 copies/\u00b5l) was reported for the sample from Feb. 18 th . The negative results of February 197 14 th were most likely due to insufficient sample loading. The concentration of internal reference gene 198 was only 1.892 copies/\u03bcl, indicating low RNA load in the test. One Feb. 18 th , dPCR test result was 199 positive with the internal reference gene concentration at 20.8 copies/\u03bcl. It also suggested that the Feb. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042689 doi: medRxiv preprint using RT-PCR and dPCR targeting ORF1ab genes, but dPCR targeting N gene reported 2 positive 217 results. From dPCR results, it clearly indicates viral load in patients is throat > stool > blood. 218\n\nThe samples with ORF1ab positive detected in throat for dPCR is 6 more than . 219\n\nThe samples with ORF 1ab positive detected in blood and sputum for dPCR is 1 more than RT-PCR (1 220 vs 0). While the samples with ORF1ab positive detected in stool for dPCR is 2 less than RT-PCR (2 vs 221 4). Therefore, dPCR showed less sensitivity than RT-PCR in specimens from stool, higher sensitivity 222 than RT-PCR in specimens from throat, blood and sputum. Different detection sensitivity of dPCR 223 assay for different sample types may require further experiments to draw a conclusion. 224\n\nStool specimen from patient 4 on Feb. 24 th was tested as negative by both However, the internal reference gene result by dPCR is 0 suggesting no RNA was loaded in either tests 227 or the PCR reactions were inhibited. The samples need to be re-collected to re-run the tests. The 228 internal reference gene of dPCR assay serves as a quality control to ensures no PCR inhibition 229 happened and RNA extraction was successful. Without such a control in RT-PCR assay, the patient 230 could have been discharged prematurely, putting those in close contact at risk of being infected. 231 232\n\nWe first demonstrated that the LOD of dPCR assay is at least 10 times better than that of RT-PCR 234 assay using serial dilution of the same clinical sample. Higher sensitivity, along with more reliable 235 quantification of viral load, provides valuable information to help clinicians choose the appropriate 236 treatment plan 16 . To demonstrate its application in clinical settings, we performed head-to-head 237 comparison of RT-PCR and dPCR assays using a cohort of 39 patients totaling 109 samples obtained 238 at different stage of the treatment and from different locations.. 239\n\nWe observed that the result of dPCR targeting ORF1ab gene is consistent with RT-PCR targeting the 240 same. In particular, dPCR assay detected 4 positive samples that were determined to be negative by 241 RT-PCR assay.

It may be explained by the higher copy number of RNA for N gene arising from the replication 249 process of the virus 17,18 . Interestingly, RT-PCR assay didn't exhibit significance difference between the 250 two targets. Further study is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanism. It is well recognized 251 that dPCR assays are less susceptible to the existence of PCR inhibitors, and the results are thus more 252 reliable in general 11, 19 . 253\n\nWith dPCR assay, we were able to track the progress of the treatment by monitoring the viral load 254 from samples obtained on different dates. RT-PCR suffered from sporadic appearance of positive 255 result which puzzled clinicians. dPCR results, in contrast, faithfully reflected the onset and healing of 256 the disease, when examined together with relevant radiological evidence and treatment history. dPCR 257 showed evidences of higher sensitivity to detect low virus load in patients who showed mild symptoms 258 or have been treated for COVID-19 than We were also able to compare the viral load in different organs thanks to higher sensitivity of dPCR 260 assay. The dPCR assay provides quantitative information on the viral load of specimens collected from 261 different locations of the same patient. In all but one cases, the viral load is the highest in pharyngeal 262 samples, lower in stool samples and the lowest in serum. Interestingly, a considerable amount of virus 263 was found in the phlegm of one of the patients whose pharyngeal sample was negative. These 264 observations may provide valuable insight into the pathology of this emerging disease 20 . 265\n\nDigital PCR shows improved lower limit of detection, sensitivity and accuracy, enabling COVID-19 267 All rights reserved.
