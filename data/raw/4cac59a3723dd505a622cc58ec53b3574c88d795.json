{"title": "The first report of the prevalence of COVID-19 in Chronic myelogenous leukemia patients in the core epidemic area of China: multicentre, cross-sectional survey", "body": "Since late December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, that began in Wuhan, has become endemic in China and more than 100 countries and regions in the world. So far, there is rare data on the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We aimed to describe the clinical course, outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 and prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients.\n\nIn this multicentre, cross-sectional survey, the clinical data of CML patients with COVID-19 in each center were collected. Simultaneously, an online survey was conducted for information about the CML patients under the management at each center by asking the CML patients to complete a questionnaire,from February 15, 2020 to February 21, 2020. The questionnaire includes demographic data, place of residence, smoking status, CML diagnosis and treatment, comorbidities, combined medications, epidemiological history, symptoms(fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc) during the epidemic. Additional clinical data was collected on respondents suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. We described and analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, and focus on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Data were compared between the CML patients with optimal response and those with non-optimal response. The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, as of Feb 21, 2020. Secondary outcomes included the history of epidemiology of CML patients, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 .\n\nOf 392 respondents, 223( 56.9%) were males, and 240( 61.2%) were 50 years or younger.\n\nOnly 10 patients took drugs irregularly due to the influence of the epidemic because of traffic control, pharmacies unable to operate normally, etc. In the history of epidemiology, there were 4 patients with definite contact with COVID-19, of which 3 were remote contact and 1 was close contact. 12 respondents had fever, cough or shortness of breath during the epidemic, 1 case\n\nSince late December 2019, the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease in Wuhan, China, has been endemic in China and more than 100 countries and regions in the world. 1-7 By March 1, 2020, China had reported a total of 80,026 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease, with 2,912 deaths.

Simultaneously, an online survey was conducted for information about the CML patients under the management at each center by asking the CML patients to complete a questionnaire. A total of 413 questionnaires were collected, of which 392 were valid, but 21 of these were excluded because the respondents did not live in Hubei province during the outbreak. The questionnaire asked about general demographic characteristics, place of residence, smoking status, CML diagnosis and treatment, comorbidities, combined medications, epidemiological history, and symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc.\n\nduring the epidemic. Additional clinical data was collected on respondents suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. Any missing or uncertain records were collected and clarified through direct communication with involved health-care providers and their families.\n\nThe primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, as of Feb 21, 2020.\n\nSecondary outcomes included the history of epidemiology of CML patients, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19.\n\nThe aim of this study is to report prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients. COVID-19 infection in CML patients with different efficacy was compared. We also report the clinical courses and clinical outcomes of the COVID-19 patients. There were, therefore, no formal hypotheses being implemented to drive the sample size calculation and we included the maximum number of patients who met the inclusion criteria.\n\nA total of 413 questionnaires were collected, of which 392 were valid. Among them, 21 questionnaires were excluded because the respondents did not live in Hubei province during the outbreak. The following is the general situation of the respondents. There were 223 males, accounting for 56.9%, and 61.2% of the respondents were 50 years or younger. The age distribution chart is shown in .

Three people went to the hospital for treatment. After chest CT scan and SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR testing, one of these three patients was confirmed to she did not take imatinib regularly due to side effects and the efficacy evaluation was failure.\n\nAfter 2015, regular dose reduction of imatinib (200mg per day) was started. The latest BCR-ABL fusion gene was quantified at 0.37% in December 2019. In early February 2020, after initially having a cough, she quickly developed dyspnea that was not relieved with oxygen therapy at home. She was admitted to the emergency department where she was found to have extreme lymphocytopenia, respiratory failure, renal insufficiency, and myocardial damage. Her condition rapidly deteriorated and she succumbed after three days of hospitalization. This is consistent with previous reports that elderly patients with comorbidities have a poor prognosis and high mortality [20] [21] [22] , and the degree of lymphopenia is related to the severity of the disease. Although he obtained an optimal response, he was not taking TKIs during the outbreak due to side effects. In mid-february 2020, he presented with cough and fever and was found to be .

Nevertheless, our findings suggest that standardized management to obtain the best clinical response reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and improves the prognosis of those who are infected. CML is a chronic hematologic tumor, and comprehensive measures should be taken to delay and reduce the risk of infection by restricting patient exposure to situations with possible transmission. During the epidemic, special attention should be focused on those CML patients who are older, have co-morbidities and whose response to CML treatment is non-optimal.\n\nOptimal response(299 persons) Warnings or failure(50 persons)\n\nForgotten to take medicine in the past 2 weeks 63 6\n\nContact with infected person 4 0\n\nHave Comorbidities 82 13\n\nDiagnosed COVID-19 1 1 Table 5 ( Data were compared between the CML patients with optimal response and those with non-optimal response)"}
