{"title": "Influence of Population Immunosuppression and Past Vaccination on Smallpox Reemergence Technical Appendix Estimation of Immunosuppressed Population", "body": "(9) and 7.84% (10) of the population, respectively. Persons living with autoimmune diseases and dialysis were estimated to be 7.37% (11) and 0.14% (12) , respectively. We distributed dialysis treatment prevalence by age (6) and autoimmune diseases by rheumatoid arthritis age-specific incidence.\n\nAt any point in time, a fraction of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy will be severely immunosuppressed; we estimated this fraction to be 6.7% of persons with cancer (1).\n\nWe classified this fraction as severely immunosuppressed and the remaining 93.3% as mild.\n\nWe considered 30% of the persons in Sydney and 40% of the persons in New York living with HIV, 100% of persons living with organ transplant, and 33% of the population effected by autoimmune diseases to be severely immunocompromised (Technical Appendix Table 1 ). The mildly immunocompromised compartment comprised the rest of the population living with HIV (70%-60%), autoimmune diseases (67%), cancer (97.3%), and renal dialysis (100%). Use of inhaled corticosteroids is immunosuppressive to the respiratory tract and associated with a higher incidence of pneumonia. We divided the population affected by COPD and asthma into the severe (12.3%) and mildly immunocompromised (39.2%) and considered the rest (48.5%) not immunosuppressed.\n\nPersons infected with hemorrhagic and flat smallpox have the highest basic reproduction number estimated from different historical outbreaks (R0 = 10) (13); however, we used an R0 of 5 to account for the isolation of severely ill patients (Technical Appendix Table 2 ). For ordinary smallpox, we assumed an R0 of 7.96, estimated from a detailed study of an outbreak in Nigeria in a unvaccinated community (14) , and for modified smallpox, we assumed an R0 of 5.3 (2/3 of the R0 estimated for the ordinary type). Because of milder symptoms, we accounted for isolation and halved R0 from the third and fourth day for ordinary and modified smallpox, respectively. Data collected from historical outbreaks (15) shows that persons infected with hemorrhagic, flat, and vaccine-modified smallpox have 100%, 90%, and 0% case fatality ratios (CFRs), respectively, while for ordinary smallpox, infection is age-specific (15) . Another study showed the CFR for hemorrhagic type being 95% (16) . In our study, due to better outbreak response and more developed care centers, we assumed the same CFR for ordinary and vaccine-modified smallpox, but a slightly lower CFR for hemorrhagic and flat cases, being 90% and 75%, respectively.\n\nAll the parameters used in the SEIR model are listed in Technical Appendix Table 2 .\n\nWe used age-specific rates for hemorrhagic, flat, and ordinary smallpox as estimated by Rao (15) . To get age-specific rates for all age groups up to the >85-year age group, we linearly interpolated the values for the age group available from data collected. The age-specific rates used in the model for each age group of the healthy unvaccinated population are shown in Technical Appendix Table 3 .\n\nFor the mildly immunosuppressed population, we doubled the age-specific rates of severe smallpox types (Technical Appendix Table 2 ), while for the severely immunosuppressed population, we set at 100% because only the hemorrhagic type develops. Regarding the vaccinated subgroup of the population, an estimated 25.3% of vaccinated persons get vaccinemodified smallpox (15) . We applied a waning immunity function over time at a rate of 1.41%\n\nper year after vaccination (17). We applied the same waning for the susceptibility as well, starting with a 100%-effective vaccination. Age-specific rates for this subgroup are shown in Technical Appendix Table 4 "}
