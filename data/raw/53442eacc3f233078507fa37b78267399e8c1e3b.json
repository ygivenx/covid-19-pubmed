{"title": "Dysregulation of Long Non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Genes and Predicted lncRNA-protein Interactions during Zika Virus Infection", "body": "The human mosquito-borne pathogen, Zika Virus (ZIKV), is strongly associated with fetal developmental abnormalities, such as microcephaly and eye defects, as well as poor pregnancy outcomes [1] [2] [3] . The teratogenic ZIKV belongs to Flaviviridae family and the viral genome comprises of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA molecule that encodes a large polyprotein.\n\nThis polyprotein is proteolytically cleaved into 11 functional peptides of viral structural and nonstructural components. ZIKV was first isolated from a Rhesus monkey in 1947 [4, 5] . The recent adaptation of ZIKV to a human host resulted in several epidemics across the globe [6, 7] . The virus is transmitted by mosquitos and through sexual contact. The major concern is the increasing geographical distribution of mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti, and Aedes albopictus, which is responsible for ZIKV transmission in humans. Understanding the interaction of ZIKV with its human host is crucial for developing effective vaccines and therapeutic measures.\n\nThe main focus of this study is to discern the effect of Zika viral infection on the expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes. The presence of lncRNAs has been frequently determined with high confidence from transcriptomes and microarray technologies [8] . The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project Consortium (GENCODE release 24) estimates that the human genome incorporates around 62% of 25,823 ncRNA genes as lncRNA genes that encode 28,031 well-defined lncRNA transcripts (http://www.gencodegenes.org). The minority of the non-coding transcripts are small, whereas, the majority of them exceed 200 nucleotides in length, and they are consequently cataloged as lncRNAs [9] . While this practical definition is fairly arbitrary, the size cutoff clearly differentiates lncRNAs from small regulatory RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) that participate in RNA interference (RNAi), and Piwi-associated RNAs (piRNAs). It is noted that the classical ncRNAs are ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), ribozymes, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and telomere-associated RNAs (TERC, TERRA) [10] . The majority of the lncRNA transcripts are expressed from intergenic regions and, to a lesser extent, in the protein-coding gene regions as sense or antisense transcripts.\n\nPrevious studies have provided an unbiased finding of non-coding transcripts across many cell types and tissues [11, 12] and made the conclusion that a vast majority of the genome was transcribed [13] . Interestingly, lncRNAs are playing a critical role in the developmental processes and etiology of a wide range of diseases. The expression patterns of many lncRNAs .

However, the function of the majority of lncRNAs remains unknown [10] . Even though lncRNAs exert a spectrum of regulatory mechanisms across different cellular pathways, a broad theme is emerging in which lncRNAs are driving the assembly of RNA-protein complexes that can facilitate the regulation of gene expression. Knowing that there is an interaction between lncRNAs and protein coding genes in both normal and disease states is essential to uncover the key functional roles of lncRNAs in cellular and developmental processes [18, 19] . Thus, we carried out transcriptome analysis to determine expression patterns of lncRNAs in the ZIKV infected Vero cells that serve as a mammalian cell model. This study provides new insight into the interaction between ZIKV and its host.\n\nThe Vero cell line (ATCC, USA) (kidney cells from an African green monkey) was cultured using complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Fisher Scientific, USA). DMEM was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), 10 mM Hepes, and 2 mM L-glutamine (Fisher Scientific, USA). The cells were cultured at 37 o C with 5% CO 2 conditions and passaged every second or third day for experimental assays or when the cells reached over 80% confluency.\n\nA ZIKV clinical isolate, PRVABC59 (GenBank accession number KU501215), belonging to an Asian genotype was used in this study [20] . Early passage virus was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Viral stocks were generated in Vero cells. Viral titer was estimated by a plaque assay, as reported previously [21] .\n\nVero cells were seeded in a 12-well plate at a density of 1 x 10 5 cells per well. [23] . Each gene was fitted into a negative binomial generalized linear model. The Wald test was applied to assess the differential expressions between two sample groups by DESeq2. The\n\nBenjamini and Hochberg procedure [24] was applied to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing and differential expressed gene candidates were selected with a false discovery rate of less than 0.10. For visualization of coordinated gene expression in the samples, a hierarchical clustering with the Pearson correlation distance matrix was performed with differential expressed gene candidates using the Bioconductor gplots package (version 2.14.2) in R.\n\nSignificantly expressed genes were assessed for pathway enrichment using DAVID release 6.7\n\n(https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (http://www.ingenuity.com/products/ipa) (QIAGEN, Redwood City). The significantly enriched canonical pathways were defined as having a q-value of <.01.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from uninfected and ZIKV-infected cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). cDNA was synthesized using 3\u03bcg of total RNA and SuperScript III Reverse The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. \n\nTo identify the high confident lncRNA-protein interaction network for NEAT1 and MALAT1, we \n\nError bars in the graph reflect the standard deviation. P-values were determined by the two- \n\nWe utilized a Vero cell-based in vitro infectious culture system to investigate the ZIKV effect on the expression of lncRNAs. Vero cells supported robust lytic infection by the Asian ZIKV genotype (Fig. 1A) . The viral-mediated cytopathic effects (CPEs), consisting of cell rounding and lysis, were observed at 48 hpi. The Zika viral genome replication was quantified by RT-qPCR, as described in the Methods section. At 48 hpi, several log increases in the ZIKV genome replication was observed (Fig. 1B) . The virus infection in the Vero cells was also confirmed by detecting viral envelope proteins in the cytoplasm by Immunofluorescence Assay (Fig. 1C) . Table 2 ). A heat map of these differentially expressed lncRNAs is given in Figure 2 .\n\nFor validation, ZIKV infection experiment was repeated in Vero cells. Total RNA isolated at 48\n\nhpi was subjected to RT-qPCR analysis to verify the lncRNAs. We confirmed the following up- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

HUCL (Hepatocellular Carcinoma Up-Regulated Long Non-Coding RNA) lncRNA was included as a control, which did not show changes during ZIKV infection. Since most of the lncRNAs are functionally uncharacterized, we focused on the previously known NEAT1 and MALAT1 for downstream studies.\n\nIdentifying an interaction network of lncRNAs and protein coding genes, which are differentially regulated in ZIKV infected cells relative to the uninfected control, is essential to uncover the key biological functions of lncRNAs in cell injury processes. Hence, we focused on identifying the factors that can interact with lncRNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 using RAIN and STRING. Initial seed interaction networks for NEAT1 and MALAT1 predicted a maximum of 20 interacting factors ( Supplementary Figures 1 and 2 ). There were 20 and 19 high confidence nodes that involved in 31 and 32 interactions for NEAT1 and MALAT1 networks, respectively. Almost, all the interactions in these two independent networks were supported by text-mining. Afterwards, the factors interacted with each of the two lncRNAs and were combined to find the common interacting factors (Figure 4 ). We identified two lncRNAs namely MIAT and TUG1 as common Comprehensive lncRNA-Protein interaction network. Proteins collectively contribute to a shared and specific function. For instance, if a single edge appears with different lines/colors between two nodes, this clearly indicates that the interaction between two given genes/nodes is supported by more than one verification [25] .

With the evidence from the interacting network, we identified known co-expressing genes that are differentially regulated during ZIKV infection from our genome-wide gene expression data sets. We extended our analysis using the 11 interacting factors defined in our previous analysis for further comprehensive interacting network analysis in order to identify more high confidence co- Table 3 ). It is possible that 5 lncRNAs having interactions with 24 proteins may form post-transcriptional regulatory networks [27] [28] [29] , and control fundamental cellular and developmental processes. We also observed that apart from the text-mining, the majority of the lncRNA-protein interactions were supported by experimental evidence. progression. We found that the cell cycle pathways and various cell cycle genes including CDK1, Cyclin B, E2F, and p21 were deregulated in ZIKV infected cells (Supplementary Fig. 3 ).\n\nOur data suggests that the lncRNAs MALAT1 and NEAT1 can play important roles in the pathogenesis of Zika virus-mediated developmental diseases.\n\nHere, we have provided the first comprehensive analysis of the effect of ZIKV infection on cellular lncRNA gene expression. We utilized an unbiased RNA sequencing approach to profile differentially regulated genes during ZIKV infection of mammalian cells. We identified a total of 121 lncRNA genes that were differentially regulated during infection. Though over 25,000\n\nlncRNAs are catalogued in the human genome, the functions of only a few hundred of them are known [32] . We identified that MALAT1 and NEAT1, two lncRNAs with known functions, were down-regulated upon ZIKV infection.\n\nMALAT1 is localized at nuclear speckles. These sub-nuclear structures are involved in RNA polymerase II transcription, splicing of pre-mRNA and export of processed mRNA ( [33, 34] ).\n\nNEAT1 is present in the nuclear paraspeckle structures [35, 36] . Both of these lncRNAs have been shown to be upregulated in cancer cells and to be involved in cell proliferation [31, 33, [37] [38] [39] [40] . Depletion of these lncRNAs can cause loss of cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest. ZIKV has been shown to cause cell cycle inhibition and neuronal cell death [41] . These observations allow us to formulate a hypothesis that ZIKV may regulate MALAT1 and NEAT1 for cell cycle control towards completing virus replication. This investigation was carried out in a ZIKV proteins and other biomolecules [42, 43] . The RNA-protein interactions, which are known to facilitate post-transcriptional regulatory networks, are beginning to be understood [27] [28] [29] .\n\nThrough detailed bioinformatics analysis of our differentially expressed gene database, we have Although recent studies have found evidence of many RNA binding proteins and RPIs in cells [44] [45] [46] , huge numbers of lncRNAs and proteins that participate in RPIs need to be characterized. Apart from regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, RPIs can control many fundamental biological processes including, but not limited to, DNA replication, transcription, pathogen resistance and viral replication [47] [48] [49] [50] .
