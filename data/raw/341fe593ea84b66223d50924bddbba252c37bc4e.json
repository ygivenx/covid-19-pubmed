The R 0 is the expected number 29 of infections by one infectious person during the course of his/her infectious 30 period, and is a key measure of an epidemic.

Even for those exceptional provinces, the recent trend is largely de-144 clining. The non-monotone pattern for non-Hubei provinces were largely due 145 to relative small number of infected cases and waves of introduced infections. Table 1 provides the reproduction number R D 0 at the three durations 166 on February 10th. It shows that 5 provinces and 4 Hubei cities' R 14 0 were 167 significantly above 1 (at 5% significance level). There are 17 provinces and 168 8 Hubei cities' R 14 0 were significantly below 1, which were 4 and 6 more 169 than those a day earlier on February 9th, and 9 and 8 more than those on 170 February 8th, respectively. If we use the shorter D = 10.5, 27 provinces 171 and 11 Hubei cities have been significantly below 1 for 1-7 consecutive days.\n\nThese indicate that the reproduction number R 0 has showed signs of crossing 173 below the critical threshold 1 in increasing number of provinces and cities 174 in Hubei around February 8-10.

Apply the same 294 filtering on the recovered process R(t) and obtainR(t). To simply the nota-295 tion, we denote the filtered data\u012a(t) andR(t) as I(t) and R(t) respectively, 296 wherever there is no confusion.\n\nLet \u2206 \u03b4 R t = R t+\u03b4 \u2212 R t for t = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T \u2212 \u03b4. From the third equation in (1), we estimate \u03b3 by least square fitting of \u2206 \u03b4 R t on I(t) without intercept. We estimate \u03b2(t) \u2212 \u03b3 by a local linear regression on log{I(t)}. Let\u03b3 and \u03b2(t) \u2212 \u03b3 be the estimators, and Var(\u03b3) and Var(\u03b2(t) \u2212 \u03b3) be their estimated variances. Their close form expressions are provided in Section S.1 in SI. Then,\u03b2(t) = \u03b2(t) \u2212 \u03b3 +\u03b3 is the estimate for the varying coefficient \u03b2(t) in (1). The standard error of\u03b2(t) can be obtained as SE \u03b2 (t) = { Var(\u03b2(t) \u2212 \u03b3) + Var(\u03b3)} 1/2 . The 95% confidence interval for \u03b2(t) can be constructed as (\u03b2(t) \u2212 1.96SE \u03b2 (t),\u03b2(t) + 1.96SE \u03b2 (t)).\n\n(2)\n\nIn the implementation, we chose \u03b4 = 2 and w = 5. Figure S1 in SI shows \n\nAs R D 0 (t) = \u03b2(t) \u00d7 D, predicting \u03b2(t) is equivalent to predicting R D 0 (t). From Figure 1 and Figure S2 in SI, we see that the overall trends of \u03b2(t) is decreasing. But the rate of deceasing gets smaller as time travels. To model such trend, we consider the reciprocal regression\n\n.
