Eligible Increases evidence for the clinical use of CLD granules to treat seasonal influenza. 61 Take a robust 21-day patient follow-up. the study flowchart is shown in Fig. 1 .\n\nIn the follow-up period, specific items will be collected (see online supplementary appendix 1). 155 During the remedial period, participants will be required to register a daily record of symptoms. The To ensure the safety of patients, blinding of the study design, data quality and adherence to the 186 study protocol, personnel who participate directly in this study will be adequately trained and 187 follow guidelines for good clinical practice (GCP). Table 2 . 197 If the participants meet rejection criteria, they will be removed, and the data will not be included 198 in the final statistical analysis. However, termination standards relate to enrolled patients that may 199 be terminated during the remedial period and data from these patients will be included in the final 200 statistical analysis. The rejection criteria and termination standards are detailed in Table 3 . Table 4 and 207 are based on the detailed symptoms shown in Table 1 . Patients will be divided into two types 208 according to two TCM practitioners 23 . sufficient time (in their own opinion) to fully consider trial entry and to ask questions of 215 investigators. The written informed consent from will be signed by the patient who is willing to 216 participate this clinical trial. Research doctors will obtain written consent from patients willing to 217 participate in the trial. Additional biological samples will be obtained to be stored for use in future 218 studies. A materials consent will be obtained to specifically address the collection such as serum 219 and plasma specimens. 231 Patients in this group will be administered four bags of CLD granules (3g/per bag) half an hour 232 after a meal, three times daily, for 5 days, taken with an analogous oseltamivir capsule, twice daily, 233 for 5 days. test, all drugs, within the trial period, will be packed by Pan-long-yun-hai Pharmaceutical Company. 246 The drugs will be counted and sorted by a third party (Chinese Evidenced-based Medicine Center, 247 West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China.) . All drugs were within the expiration dates. 248 Other treatments may be taken if the participants have the following symptoms: axillary 249 temperature \u226538.5\u2103 that lasts for 4 h and does not reduce with physical cooling; body 250 temperature >39\u2103; or headache or myalgia scores of \u22653 points. 251 Symptomatic treatment measures are as follows. A. Fever: acetaminophen; B. severe cough 252 with white phlegm: Bisolvon; C. mild asthmatic symptoms: long-acting theophylline. No other 253 drugs may be used. Detailed information on drug use will be registered in the CRF. 254 The investigator will instruct the participants to record the actual dose in their patient's diary. 255 Based on this diary, the investigator will evaluate the subject's adherence to the interventions to the 256 following four levels, and record the results on the case report form at each follow-up: 1) Take 257 prescribed medications; 2) Basically prescribed medication (80% to 120% of the dose of the Data entry and management is the responsibility of the assigned data manager who will 270 establish the database and the verification procedure. Then, two specialised trained keyboard 271 operators will input and confirm the data. After checking the CRF, identified entry errors will be 272 corrected until the input data is exactly as the same as the CRF. Any queries on the CRF will be 273 communicated to the researchers through the data query form. These data query forms must be processed, signed and dated timely by the researcher. Resolved data questions must be returned to 275 the data manager, who revises and verifies the data according to the feedback, and correspondingly 276 updates the database, then the necessary data question form can be queried again. The database will be locked after confirming the accuracy of the established database by blind 279 review. Locked data cannot be changed. If any data revision is needed after locking, an official 280 statement jointly signed by the sponsor, main researcher, experimental project managers, 281 statisticians and data manager must be provided. Additionally, revisions will be performed in the 282 statistical analysis. After data have been reviewed, all cases will be assessed to confirm the intent-to-treat 285 population (ITTP), modified intent-to-treatment population (MITTP), per-protocol population (PPP) 286 and the safety analysis population (SAP). The decision will be approved by the data manager, study 287 promoter, and researchers, and will end with unblinding after locking the database. Primary outcome 295 The primary outcome is the time to alleviate influenza-like symptoms: fever; stuffy nose; 296 running nose; sore throat; cough; myalgia; fatigue; headaches; chills and sweating, which will be 297 measured in hours. Alleviation means that the influenza-like symptoms score is \u22641 (mild) and the 298 state is stable for more than 24h 26 . 299 300 Secondary outcomes 301 The secondary endpoints consist of seven aspects: ii. The area under the curve (AUC) analysis of nine influenza-like symptom scores, provide 306 indications of disease severity. The AUC is calculated as the product of the daily symptom scores 307 multiplied by the duration of the illness. 308 iii. The treatment efficacy for different TCM syndromes is assessed by the TCM syndrome scores. The indices of vital signs, cardiopulmonary signs, electrocardiography and clinical laboratory 322 tests (biochemistry, haematology and urine examination) will be compared before and after the 323 treatment to assess for safety. Additionally, research interviewers will keep in touch with each 324 participant to monitor safety. 325 Any adverse events in the vital signs, symptoms and disease or laboratory parameters of the 326 patients that occur after entering clinical trials will be recorded. The occurrence of adverse events is 327 not necessarily related to the study drugs. Adverse events are divided into three levels: mild; Committee. Any cause-and-effect relationship between adverse events and the study drugs will be 333 determined by the classifications shown in Table 5 . If the patient has a serious adverse event, it is necessary to know the specific situation of the 335 medication\uff0cunblinding is permissible only after obtaining the consent of the main investigator. 336 Once the emergency letter is read, the case is treated as shedding. Organization for influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) were used as the basis for influenza surveillance. If a 343 patient presents with an acute cough and fever, clinicians must be highly vigilant to test for 344 infections caused by the influenza virus. In general, the rate of ILI cases that lead to a clinical 345 diagnosis of influenza infection is approximately 18 to 80%, which is higher than other clinical 346 diagnoses, for example, acute infections of the upper respiratory tract 20,27 . We selected adult ILI 347 patients for inclusion into the study. 348 Furthermore, this trial is a confirmatory study on the treatment of influenza by CLD Granules. 349 The patients will be randomly assigned in three groups: positive group, test group and placebo 350 group. In this trial, the number of sample cases was estimated based on the test hypothesis that the 351 test group was superior to the placebo group and the test group was not inferior to the positive 352 control group. 353 The main index of treatment effectiveness is the period of time until subsidence of symptoms 354 (hours). It has been reported that the average period of time for remission of these symptoms in the 355 placebo group was about 5 days (120 hours) 26 . This trial requires that the average time for 356 symptomatic remission of the test group should be at least 12 hours shorter than the placebo group, 357 it means the Permissible Error (\u03b4) of the superiority trial is 12 hours. In order to be considered 358 clinically significant, the mean time for symptomatic remission in the positive group must less than 359 12 hours compared with the placebo group, which means the Permissible Error (\u03b4) of the superiority 360 trial is within 12 hours. The calculation data is as follows: through local advertising. And each participant will receive financial compensation after they 371 finishing the entire treatment. For patients who drop out, payments will be pro-rated for the length 372 of time they stayed in the study, but payment will not be made until the study would have been 373 completed.\n\nStatistical analysis 375 The clinical data will be managed and analysed by a third party (Chinese Evidenced-based ii. Modified intent-to-treatment population (MITTP) 383 After randomisation, the study drug was used at least once and after intervention the effective 384 outcome was recorded at least once.\n\niii. Per-protocol population (PPP) 386 The PPP is all cases includes those cases that meet the inclusion criteria, are in full accordance iv. Safety analysis population (SAP) 391 After randomisation, the study drug is taken at least once and after intervention, effective 392 safety evaluation data has been recorded at least once. 393 In this experiment, the baseline data and efficacy analysis will be analysed by the MITTP. 394 Simultaneously, the primary efficacy endpoint will have PPP analysis, but the conclusions will be 395 mainly based on MITT analysis. If the results of the MITTP analysis and PPP analysis are 396 consistent, the credibility of the conclusions is increased. If there are missing data, the last 397 observation carry-forward (LOCF) method will be used to extrapolate the data.\n\nSAP will be used to examine the laboratory data, adverse events and adverse reactions. The 399 rate of adverse reactions will employ the SAP as the denominator. i. SPSS17.0 or SAS9.2 statistical software will be used. 402 ii. All the statistical inferences will use two-sided tests. Statistically significant means P<0.05. The 403 confidence interval of the parameters will be estimated using a 95% confidence interval. 404 iii. Efficacy analyses of the LOCF will be used to compensate for the cases in which not all 405 information from the patients is recorded during treatment; the last observation data will transfer to 406 the final test results. The safety analysis will not estimate any missing data. 407 iv. A comparison between the dropout rate and dropout rate caused by adverse events will be 408 undertaken using the Pearson's \u03c7 2 test. 409 v. Measurement data are given as mean, standard deviation and confidence intervals, and if 410 necessary, minimum, maximum, P25, median and P75 will be provided; paired measurement data 411 will also be used to demonstrate the difference between the mean and standard deviation; and with 412 non-parametric methods, the median and mean rank will be provided. Count data are the frequency 413 distribution and the corresponding percentage. Level data will be given as the frequency distribution 414 and the corresponding percentage, as well as the median and mean rank. Qualitative information 415 will show the positive rate, the number of positive cases and the denominator. 416 vi. Baseline data analyses (two sets) will involve demographic indicators, the general situation and 417 primary and secondary indicators before the intervention. Measurement data will be analysed using 418 the t test or t\u00b2 test (when the variance is not homogeneous); count data will be analysed using the Pearson's \u03c7 2 test. Rating data will be analysed using the two sample Wilcoxon rank sum test. 420 vii. For the efficacy analyses of quantitative variables, comparisons between groups will use 421 repetitive measure analysis of variance and covariance analysis. For qualitative variables, 422 comparisons between groups will use the Pearson's \u03c7 2 test and centre effect analysis will use the 423 CMH test. For rating variables, group comparisons will be tested by the Kruskal-Wallis test and the 424 central effect analysis will be tested by the CMH test or grade logistic regression. 425 viii. For centre effect analysis, the CLM and CMH methods will be used for quantitative and 426 qualitative indicators, respectively. A logistic regression model will be performed for the evaluation 427 and correction of rating variables. 428 ix. With the subgroup analysis, it will be difficult to prevent the specific circumstances of the data 429 affecting the outcome. 430 x. For the safety analysis, the Pearson's \u03c7 2 test will be used for comparing the prevalence of adverse 431 events (two sets) and the adverse events occurring in the trial will be listed and described. A 432 description of the laboratory test results of normal/abnormal changes before and after the 433 experiment, as well as the relationship between abnormal changes and the test drugs will be 434 recorded. These changes will also be listed and described. 435 Adverse events refer to any adverse medical events occurring from the time when patients 436 signed the informed consent form and were selected for the trial to the time of the last follow-up.\n\nWhether there is a causal relationship between incidences of adverse events and study drugs, 438 adverse event types, degree, time, treatment measures and treatment processes should be recorded 439 in the CRF. The relationship between adverse events and study drugs is based on a comprehensive 440 consideration of comorbidities and medication.\n\nThe physician will decide whether to suspend observation of the patients. A follow-up survey 442 will carried out in the cases where the patient is withdrawn because of adverse events and the 443 results will be recorded in detail. At an appropriate time, the incidence of adverse events and 444 treatments will be reviewed and comprehensively analysed to determine whether the adverse events 445 were related to the study drug.\n\nAdverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment or serious adverse events will be 447 summarised. In addition, the 95% confidence interval of adverse events using the Fisher's exact test 448 will be calculated and the Fisher's exact test will be used to compare the prevalence of adverse 449 events between the CLD granules, oseltamivir and placebo 21 . The trial will be publicised at regional and national conferences. The final results will be 487 presented at scientific meetings and published in a peer-reviewed journal (authorship will be 488 according to the journal's guidelines). In addition, a lay summary of the study results will be 489 circulated to potentially interested parties. Since there is lack of clinical trials of traditional Chinese herbal medicines (TCHM), not only 502 the effectiveness, but also the safety of TCHM will be investigated in this study 22 . To evaluate the 503 safety, changes in liver and kidney function after treatment will be monitored.\n\nIn this study, we will divide the patients into cold and heat TCM syndromes to study whether 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\nParticipants will be terminated if they meet one of the termination standards:\n\nThe patient's illness becomes severe, and the severity meets one of the following criteria: (i) persistent high fever for >3 days (\u226539\u00b0C); (ii) severe cough, purulent sputum, bloody sputum or There is no other plausible cause owing to disease or other explanations.\n\nUse of the experimental drug has a reasonable relationship with time.\n\nSimilar pharmacologic effects of the drug or experimental drug are well known.\n\nIt is difficult to identify a cause owing to disease or other explanations.\n\nUse of the experimental drug has a reasonable relationship with time.\n\nThe adverse event may be caused by disease or other explanations.\n\nThere is a connection between time and test drug.\n\nIt is easy to explain through disease or the main symptoms of a disease.\n\nThere is no connection between time and the test drug. \n\nComplete this checklist by entering the page numbers from your manuscript where readers will find each of the items listed below.\n\nYour article may not currently address all the items on the checklist.

Eligible subjects 28 (n = 318) will be allocated after satisfying the criteria (Western medicine). Subjects will be randomised 29 to receive CLD granules, oseltamivir, or a placebo for 5 days of treatment and with follow-up after Western medical methods to evaluate the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicines, which is not suit, 126 because of a lack of a mature-traditional Chinese medicine evaluation system. To develop CLD into a 127 targeted drug with less side effects that can be widely used in the prevention and treatment of influenza, 128 an in-depth study needs to be conducted. In this study, a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-simulation approach will be used. 130 It is hoped that the clinical efficacy of CLD for the treatment of influenza will be fully verified at the 131 highest level of clinical trials.\n\nObjectives 134 There is empirical evidence that treatment with CLD has positive outcomes against influenza virus 135 infection. Yet, few evidence-based clinical trials have been conducted. We seek to gain an in-depth 136 understanding of the efficacy and safety of CLD use in influenza infections in an evidence-based 137 medicine clinical study. 138 In addition, we will investigate whether CLD granules have different therapeutic effects on 139 different TCM syndrome differentiation by comparing the symptoms before and after treatment. In the follow-up period, specific items will be collected (see online supplementary appendix 1). 154 During the remedial period, participants will be required to register a daily record of symptoms. will be referred to the inclusion and exclusion criteria (shown below). Patients will be enrolled if they 164 meet all inclusion criteria and will not be enrolled if they have any one of the exclusion criteria. 165 Patients will be removed from the trial if they meet one of the rejection criteria or termination 166 standards. The enrolled participants will be required to provide written informed consent, to cooperate 167 with the doctor's treatment, to cooperate with the follow-up and provide information that is not beyond 168 the remit of the ethical approval. Patients that do not comply will be removed from the study. In this 169 period, pharyngeal/throat swabs and blood samples will be collected from participants. The participants 170 will also be distinguished according to TCM syndrome differentiation criteria (described below). 171 The study is designed to enrol 318 patients in six units. and (iv) Have signed a written informed consent from. Exclusion criteria are detailed in Table 2 . 193 If the participants meet rejection criteria, they will be removed, and the data will not be included in 194 the final statistical analysis. However, termination standards relate to enrolled patients that may be 195 terminated during the remedial period and data from these patients will be included in the final 196 statistical analysis. The rejection criteria and termination standards are detailed in Table 3 . Table 4 and are 203 based on the detailed symptoms shown in Table 1 . Patients will be divided into two types according to A doctor will confirm if the patient satisfy the participate criteria after consent being given. 208 Subsequently, it will be discussed with the patient by a medical officer of the trial team. Patients will be 209 given sufficient time (in their own opinion) to fully consider trial entry and to ask questions of 210 investigators. The written informed consent form will be signed by the patient who is willing to 211 participate this clinical trial. If the patient is under the age of 18, his/her parents will be also informed 212 of the details of the trial. Only after both of the child and his/her parent sign the informed consent, the 213 child may participate the trial. 214 A materials consent will be obtained to specifically address the collection of biological samples 215 for future use such as serum and plasma specimens. Blinding 227\n\nThe randomisation system will be implemented and managed by the Chinese Evidenced-based to terminate the experiment. The cost will be provided by the research team. 280 The investigator will instruct the participants to record the actual dose in their patient's diary. 281 Based on this diary, the investigator will evaluate the subject's adherence to the interventions to the 282 following four levels, and record the results on the case report form at each follow-up: 1) Take 283 prescribed medications; 2) Basically prescribed medication (80% to 120% of the dose of the program); Data entry and management is the responsibility of the assigned data manager who will establish 294 the database and the verification procedure. Then, two specialised trained keyboard operators will input 295 and confirm the data. After checking the CRF, identified entry errors will be corrected until the input 296 data is exactly as the same as the CRF. Any queries on the CRF will be communicated to the 297 researchers through the data query form. These data query forms must be processed, signed and dated 298 timely by the researcher. Resolved data questions must be returned to the data manager, who revises 299 and verifies the data according to the feedback, and correspondingly updates the database, then the 300 necessary data question form can be queried again. The database will be locked after confirming the accuracy of the established database by blind 303 review. Locked data cannot be changed. If any data revision is needed after locking, an official 304 statement jointly signed by the sponsor, main researcher, experimental project managers, statisticians 305 and data manager must be provided. Additionally, revisions will be performed in the statistical 306 analysis. Primary outcome 318 The primary outcome is the time to alleviate influenza-like symptoms: fever; stuffy nose; running 319 nose; sore throat; cough; myalgia; fatigue; headaches; chills and sweating, which will be measured in 320 hours. Alleviation means that the influenza-like symptoms score is \u22641 (mild) and the state is stable 321 for more than 24h 32 . 322 323 Secondary outcomes 324 The secondary endpoints consist of seven aspects: superior to the placebo group and the test group was not inferior to the positive control group. 374 The main index of treatment effectiveness is the period of time until subsidence of symptoms 375 (hours). It has been reported that the average period of time for remission of these symptoms in the 376 placebo group was about 5 days (120 hours) 32 . This trial requires that the average time for 377 symptomatic remission of the test group should be at least 12 hours shorter than the placebo group, it 378 means the Permissible Error (\uf064) of the superiority trial is 12 hours. In order to be considered clinically 379 significant, the mean time for symptomatic remission in the positive group must less than 12 hours 380 compared with the placebo group, which means the Permissible Error (\uf064) of the superiority trial is 381 within 12 hours. (Table 6) 382 Based on the above data, the SAS Software was used to estimate the sample size required for 383 \"One-way ANOVA\". The calculation result is designed for 3 parallel groups. (Table 7) 384 For achieving adequate participant enrolment, atients are recruited for clinical trials mainly through 385 local advertising. And each participant will receive financial compensation after they finishing the 386 entire treatment. For patients who drop out, payments will be pro-rated for the length of time they 387 stayed in the study, but payment will not be made until the study would have been completed. iii. Per-protocol population (PPP) 400 The PPP is all cases includes those cases that meet the inclusion criteria, are in full accordance 401 with the test program (or violate the protocol only slightly), complete the trial and complete the CRF. 402 The PP is used to analyse the main indicators for evaluating efficacy and to examine the consistency of 403 the results from the MITT. 404 iv. Safety analysis population (SAP) 405 After randomisation, the study drug is taken at least once and after intervention, effective safety 406 evaluation data has been recorded at least once. 407 In this experiment, the baseline data and efficacy analysis will be analysed by the MITTP. 408 Simultaneously, the primary efficacy endpoint will have PPP analysis, but the conclusions will be ii. All the statistical inferences will use two-sided tests. Statistically significant means P<0.05. The 417 confidence interval of the parameters will be estimated using a 95% confidence interval. 418 iii. Efficacy analyses of the LOCF will be used to compensate for the cases in which not all information 419 from the patients is recorded during treatment; the last observation data will transfer to the final test 420 results. The safety analysis will not estimate any missing data. minimum, maximum, P25, median and P75 will be provided; paired measurement data will also be 425 used to demonstrate the difference between the mean and standard deviation; and with non-parametric 426 methods, the median and mean rank will be provided. Count data are the frequency distribution and the 427 corresponding percentage. Level data will be given as the frequency distribution and the corresponding 428 percentage, as well as the median and mean rank. Qualitative information will show the positive rate, 429 the number of positive cases and the denominator. 430 vi. Baseline data analyses (two sets) will involve demographic indicators, the general situation and 431 primary and secondary indicators before the intervention. Measurement data will be analysed using the 432 t test or t\u00b2 test (when the variance is not homogeneous); count data will be analysed using the Pearson's 433 \u03c7 2 test. Rating data will be analysed using the two sample Wilcoxon rank sum test. x. For the safety analysis, the Pearson's \u03c7 2 test will be used for comparing the prevalence of adverse 445 events (two sets) and the adverse events occurring in the trial will be listed and described. A description of the laboratory test results of normal/abnormal changes before and after the experiment, as well as the 447 relationship between abnormal changes and the test drugs will be recorded. These changes will also be 448 listed and described. The physician will decide whether to suspend observation of the patients. A follow-up survey will 456 carried out in the cases where the patient is withdrawn because of adverse events and the results will be 457 recorded in detail. At an appropriate time, the incidence of adverse events and treatments will be 458 reviewed and comprehensively analysed to determine whether the adverse events were related to the 459 study drug. 460 Adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment or serious adverse events will be 461 summarised. In addition, the 95% confidence interval of adverse events using the Fisher's exact test 462 will be calculated and the Fisher's exact test will be used to compare the prevalence of adverse events 463 between the CLD granules, oseltamivir and placebo 28 . All study-related information will be stored securely at the study site. All participant information 489 will be stored in locked file cabinets in areas with limited access. All laboratory specimens, reports, 490 data collection, process, and administrative forms will be identified by a coded ID(identification) 491 number only to maintain participant confidentiality. All records that contain names or other personal 492 identifiers, such as locator forms and informed consent forms, will be stored separately from study 493 records identified by code number. All local databases will be secured with password-protected access 494 systems. Forms, lists, logbooks, appointment books, and any other listings that link participant ID The trial will be publicised at regional and national conferences. The final results will be presented 501 at scientific meetings and published in a peer-reviewed journal (authorship will be according to the 502 journal's guidelines). In addition, a lay summary of the study results will be circulated to potentially 503 interested parties. There had been no direct patient involvement in the design of this protocol. Since there is lack of clinical trials of traditional Chinese herbal medicines (TCHM), not only the 530 effectiveness, but also the safety of TCHM will be investigated in this study 29 . To evaluate the safety, 531 changes in liver and kidney function after treatment will be monitored. 532 In this study, we will divide the patients into cold and heat TCM syndromes to study whether Competing interests 566 The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Eligible 29 subjects (n = 318) will be allocated after satisfying the criteria (Western medicine). Subjects will be 30 randomised to receive CLD granules, oseltamivir, or a placebo for 5 days of treatment and with and type of pulse, will be recorded as determined by doctors of both Western and Chinese medicine.\n\nParticipants will be instructed to comply with the protocol and to keep a daily record of symptoms.\n\nThe primary and secondary outcomes and safety indicators will be used to evaluate the efficacy and The clinical medicines used for the treatment and prevention of influenza are mainly M2 ion 77 channel blockers (for example, amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors 78 (for example, oseltamivir and zanamivir) 6,7 . Amantadine, however, is prone to drug resistance and 79 is only effective against the influenza A virus 8 . In addition, the treatment efficiency of amantadine is lower than that of the NA inhibitors. Therefore, amantadine is not recommended routinely for the antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and clearing heat-toxicity effects. The root, or the whole plant, has 110 been widely been used to treat colds, sore throat, bronchitis, malaria and other diseases 18 . system. To develop CLD into a targeted drug with less side effects that can be widely used in the 130 prevention and treatment of influenza, an in-depth study needs to be conducted.\n\nIn this study, a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-simulation approach will be 132 used. It is hoped that the clinical efficacy of CLD for the treatment of influenza will be fully 133 verified at the highest level of clinical trials. \n\nIn addition, we will investigate whether CLD granules have different therapeutic effects on 141 different TCM syndrome differentiation by comparing the symptoms before and after treatment. prescription Lianhuaqingwen capsule 25 in treating influenza. participants in each group will receive 153 treatment for 5 days and observation for 21 days, and will be followed-up by research interviewers 154 on days 1,3,5,7 and 21 after treatment 26 ; the study flowchart is shown in Fig. 1 .\n\nIn the follow-up period, specific items will be collected (see online supplementary appendix 1).\n\nDuring the remedial period, participants will be required to register a daily record of symptoms. The 157 symptoms based on Western medicine (Case report form (CRF) tables) and TCM syndrome 158 differentiation based on traditional Chinese medicine (Table 1 ) will be recorded. Pharyngeal/throat 159 swabs from the upper respiratory tract will be used for RT-PCR and cultivated the influenza virus, 160 and blood samples will be used to test for influenza virus antibodies 27 . information that is not beyond the remit of the ethical approval. Patients that do not comply will be 171 removed from the study. In this period, pharyngeal/throat swabs and blood samples will be 172 collected from participants. The participants will also be distinguished according to TCM syndrome 173 differentiation criteria (described below).\n\nThe study is designed to enrol 318 patients in six units. The six units include the main central \n\nTo ensure the safety of patients, blinding of the study design, data quality and adherence to the 187 study protocol, personnel who participate directly in this study will be adequately trained and 188 follow guidelines for good clinical practice (GCP). Exclusion criteria are detailed in Table 2 .\n\nIf the participants meet rejection criteria, they will be removed, and the data will not be included 199 in the final statistical analysis. However, termination standards relate to enrolled patients that may 200 be terminated during the remedial period and data from these patients will be included in the final 201 statistical analysis. The rejection criteria and termination standards are detailed in Table 3 . Table 4 and are based on the detailed symptoms shown in Table 1 . Patients will be divided into two 209 types according to two TCM practitioners 30 .\n\nInformed consent 212 A doctor will confirm if the patient satisfy the participate criteria after consent being given.\n\nSubsequently, it will be discussed with the patient by a medical officer of the trial team. Patients \n\nA materials consent will be obtained to specifically address the collection of biological 220 samples for future use such as serum and plasma specimens. Blinding 233\n\nThe randomisation system will be implemented and managed by the Chinese Evidenced-based 234 Medicine Center. The randomisation codes will be maintained by a specifically appointed 235 independent custodian. Researchers, participants, inspectors, and data entrants will all be blinded.\n\nThe drugs were randomly coded according to the randomization protocol, and the code number will 237 be the unique identification code for the participants. According to the order of the patients visits, 238 they will be randomly divided into different groups. The test drugs, the control drugs and the 239 placebo are in the same dosage form and the same dose, so the double-blind method can be used.\n\nPreparation of the drug requires uniform packaging for each group and uses the same drug label.\n\nData lock will be performed after CRF data review, duplicate data entry verification, outlier 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 tolerate, such as severe headache or myalgia, the attending doctor will treat the patient according to 300 the actual situation and decide whether to terminate the experiment. The cost will be provided by 301 the research team.\n\nThe investigator will instruct the participants to record the actual dose in their patient's diary.\n\nBased on this diary, the investigator will evaluate the subject's adherence to the interventions to the Data entry and management is the responsibility of the assigned data manager who will 318 establish the database and the verification procedure. Then, two specialised trained keyboard 319 operators will input and confirm the data. After checking the CRF, identified entry errors will be 320 corrected until the input data is exactly as the same as the CRF. Any queries on the CRF will be 321 communicated to the researchers through the data query form. These data query forms must be 322 processed, signed and dated timely by the researcher. Resolved data questions must be returned to 323 the data manager, who revises and verifies the data according to the feedback, and correspondingly 324 updates the database, then the necessary data question form can be queried again. statisticians and data manager must be provided. Additionally, revisions will be performed in the 330 statistical analysis. Primary outcome 343 The primary outcome is the time to alleviate influenza-like symptoms: fever; stuffy nose; 344 running nose; sore throat; cough; myalgia; fatigue; headaches; chills and sweating, which will be 345 measured in hours. Alleviation means that the influenza-like symptoms score is \u22641 (mild) and the 346 state is stable for more than 24h Error! Reference source not found..\n\nSecondary outcomes 349 The secondary endpoints consist of seven aspects: Committee. Any cause-and-effect relationship between adverse events and the study drugs will be 383 determined by the classifications shown in Table 5 .\n\nIf the patient has a serious adverse event, it is necessary to know the specific situation of the 385 medication \uff0c unblinding is permissible only after obtaining the consent of the main investigator.\n\nOnce the emergency letter is read, the case is treated as shedding. Furthermore, this trial is a confirmatory study on the treatment of influenza by CLD Granules.\n\nThe patients will be randomly assigned in three groups: positive group, test group and placebo 398 group. In this trial, the number of sample cases was estimated based on the test hypothesis that the 399 test group was superior to the placebo group and the test group was not inferior to the positive 400 control group.\n\nThe main index of treatment effectiveness is the period of time until subsidence of symptoms 402 (hours). It has been reported that the average period of time for remission of these symptoms in the be considered clinically significant, the mean time for symptomatic remission in the positive group 407 must less than 12 hours compared with the placebo group, which means the Permissible Error (\uf064) of 408 the superiority trial is within 12 hours. (Table 6) 409 Based on the above data, the SAS Software was used to estimate the sample size required for 410 \"One-way ANOVA\". The calculation result is designed for 3 parallel groups. (Table 7) 411\n\nFor achieving adequate participant enrolment, atients are recruited for clinical trials mainly 412 through local advertising. And each participant will receive financial compensation after they 413 finishing the entire treatment. For patients who drop out, payments will be pro-rated for the length 414 of time they stayed in the study, but payment will not be made until the study would have been 415 completed.\n\nStatistical analysis 417 The clinical data will be managed and analysed by a third party (Chinese Evidenced-based ii. Modified intent-to-treatment population (MITTP) 425 After randomisation, the study drug was used at least once and after intervention the effective 426 outcome was recorded at least once.\n\niii.

Safety analysis population (SAP) 433 After randomisation, the study drug is taken at least once and after intervention, effective 434 safety evaluation data has been recorded at least once.\n\nIn this experiment, the baseline data and efficacy analysis will be analysed by the MITTP.\n\nSimultaneously, the primary efficacy endpoint will have PPP analysis, but the conclusions will be ii. All the statistical inferences will use two-sided tests. Statistically significant means P<0.05. The 445 confidence interval of the parameters will be estimated using a 95% confidence interval.\n\niii. Efficacy analyses of the LOCF will be used to compensate for the cases in which not all 447 information from the patients is recorded during treatment; the last observation data will transfer to 448 the final test results. The safety analysis will not estimate any missing data. 449 iv. A comparison between the dropout rate and dropout rate caused by adverse events will be 450 undertaken using the Pearson's \u03c7 2 test.\n\nv. Measurement data are given as mean, standard deviation and confidence intervals, and if 452 necessary, minimum, maximum, P25, median and P75 will be provided; paired measurement data 453 will also be used to demonstrate the difference between the mean and standard deviation; and with non-parametric methods, the median and mean rank will be provided. Count data are the frequency 455 distribution and the corresponding percentage. Level data will be given as the frequency distribution 456 and the corresponding percentage, as well as the median and mean rank. Qualitative information 457 will show the positive rate, the number of positive cases and the denominator.\n\nvi. Baseline data analyses (two sets) will involve demographic indicators, the general situation and 459 primary and secondary indicators before the intervention. Measurement data will be analysed using 460 the t test or t\u00b2 test (when the variance is not homogeneous); count data will be analysed using the 461 Pearson's \u03c7 2 test. Rating data will be analysed using the two sample Wilcoxon rank sum test. x. For the safety analysis, the Pearson's \u03c7 2 test will be used for comparing the prevalence of adverse 473 events (two sets) and the adverse events occurring in the trial will be listed and described. A 474 description of the laboratory test results of normal/abnormal changes before and after the 475 experiment, as well as the relationship between abnormal changes and the test drugs will be 476 recorded. These changes will also be listed and described.\n\nAdverse events refer to any adverse medical events occurring from the time when patients 478 signed the informed consent form and were selected for the trial to the time of the last follow-up.\n\nWhether there is a causal relationship between incidences of adverse events and study drugs, The physician will decide whether to suspend observation of the patients. A follow-up survey 484 will carried out in the cases where the patient is withdrawn because of adverse events and the 485 results will be recorded in detail. At an appropriate time, the incidence of adverse events and 486 treatments will be reviewed and comprehensively analysed to determine whether the adverse events 487 were related to the study drug.\n\nAdverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment or serious adverse events will be 489 summarised. In addition, the 95% confidence interval of adverse events using the Fisher's exact test 490 will be calculated and the Fisher's exact test will be used to compare the prevalence of adverse 491 events between the CLD granules, oseltamivir and placebo 28 . informed consents will be obtained from all participants before entry into the study; voluntary 502 participation will be ensured and utmost confidentiality of the information tendered during the 503 interview will be required. The trial will be monitored by the Ethics Committee. treatment during rehabilitation, the placebo control group will be provided with basic drugs.\n\nDuring the trial, the clinical unit must comply with GCP and the protocol of the clinical trial.\n\nPharmaceutical supervisory and administrative departments will occasionally conduct audits and 511 inspections and will cooperate with the sponsor to send medical examiners. Any moderate or 512 serious adverse events will be reported to the Ethics Committee. Patients who develop adverse 513 reactions during the trial will receive free medical treatment.\n\nConfidentiality 516\n\nAll study-related information will be stored securely at the study site. All participant 517 information will be stored in locked file cabinets in areas with limited access. All laboratory 518 specimens, reports, data collection, process, and administrative forms will be identified by a coded 519 ID(identification) number only to maintain participant confidentiality. All records that contain 520 names or other personal identifiers, such as locator forms and informed consent forms, will be 521 stored separately from study records identified by code number. All local databases will be secured The trial will be publicised at regional and national conferences. The final results will be 529 presented at scientific meetings and published in a peer-reviewed journal (authorship will be 530 according to the journal's guidelines). In addition, a lay summary of the study results will be 531 circulated to potentially interested parties. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 public involvement group included a mixture of research experienced and inexperienced people. We 538 will try to work with patient advocacy groups to ensure that plain language summaries of study 539 findings are shared to both participating service users and wider patient groups. And through the 540 communication of participants and researchers, the burden of the intervention will be assessed in a 541 comprehensive and rational way.\n\nTrial participants will not be informed of the trial results directly. However, the final results 543 will be published. However, each patient will be informed of their own influenza virus test results 544 during follow-up visits.\n\nThere had been no direct patient involvement in the design of this protocol. Since there is lack of clinical trials of traditional Chinese herbal medicines (TCHM), not only 558 the effectiveness, but also the safety of TCHM will be investigated in this study 29 . To evaluate the 559 safety, changes in liver and kidney function after treatment will be monitored. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 This study is mainly based on the evidence-based medicine, so each indicator used in the 568 criteria can be quantified in modern medicine. As the syndrome differentiation of TCM is still 569 controversial, it is not included in the selection criteria in this study, but as the object of 570 observation. The data of syndrome differentiation is used to explore the feasibility of quantifying 571 TCM symptoms.\n\nAccording to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, CLD may has a better effect on the 573 wind-heat type cold, but it was lack of evidence. So we also hope to find out whether there are herbal medicine would be more comprehensively.\n\nThe Chou-ling-dan granules have been approved as OTC drugs for many years and the drug 585 meet the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015) 37 . So the dosage determination in this study is according to 586 the instruction manual.

However, after considering the limitations, we narrowed down the age range to 14-65.\n\nIn summary, there is limited clinical research into the suing a combination of Western and 607 traditional Chinese medicine evaluation systems to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment of 608 TCHM for influenza. This study will be a combination of a traditional medicine evaluation and a 609 modern pharmacological study and should become an important reference for future research.\n\nThe most prominent feature of this study is the use of evidence-based medicine to better 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 There is no other plausible cause owing to disease or other explanations.\n\nUse of the experimental drug has a reasonable relationship with time.\n\nSimilar pharmacologic effects of the drug or experimental drug are well known.\n\nIt is difficult to identify a cause owing to disease or other explanations.\n\nUse of the experimental drug has a reasonable relationship with time.\n\nThe adverse event may be caused by disease or other explanations.\n\nThere is a connection between time and test drug.\n\nIt is easy to explain through disease or the main symptoms of a disease.\n\nThere is no connection between time and the test drug.
