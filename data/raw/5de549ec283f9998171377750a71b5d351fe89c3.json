{"title": "", "body": "> 98% identical in DNA sequence, the viruses can be readily distinguished by antigenic typing with monoclonal antibodies (Parrish and Carmichael, 1983) , by their characteristic pH and temperature dependence of haemagglutination (Carmichael et al, 1980; Senda et al, 1988) , and by host range in cultured cells or animals. The host range differences between the viruses are complex, and in experimental infection studies it was shown that CPV type-2 (see below) replicates in both canine and feline cells in culture, as well as in dogs, but it cannot replicate in cats after at least parenteral inoculation (Truyen and Parrish, 1992) . In contrast, FPV replicates in feline but not canine cells in culture and in cats, and it also replicates in certain canine tissues after inoculation of animals, including thymus and bone marrow cells (Truyen and Parrish, 1992; Truyen et al, 1994) . The natural animal host range of CPV includes dogs and close relatives such as wolves, coyotes, South American dogs, and Asiatic raccoon dogs. FPV and the FPV-like viruses infect both large and small cats, as well as mink, raccoons, and possibly foxes (reviewed by Parrish (1990) ).\n\nThe emergence and evolution of CPV is interesting, as the virus appears to have been present initially in Europe, and then to have spread around the world during a period of about 6 months in 1978. The original strain of virus (called CPV type-2) was replaced between 1979 and 1981 by a genetically and antigenically distinct virus (CPV type-2a), which has itself subsequently also been largely replaced by a further antigenic variant, designated CPV type-2b (Parrish et al, , 1988b . The origin of CPV is not known, although it most likely derived from FPV or from one of the closely related viruses of other carnivores--mink, raccoons, Asiatic raccoon dogs, or foxes. Derivation from an FPV vaccine strain in tissue culture has been suggested (Siegl, 1984) , but there is currently no evidence to prove that hypothesis, and variation of a virus in nature is an equally likely source of CPV.\n\nThis review considers the pathogenesis of FPV in cats, the very similar MEV in mink, and CPV in dogs. The pathogeneses of these infections are very similar, although small differences in the host species, its age, and the type of virus infecting it all affect the outcome of the infection.\n\nThe pathogenesis of parvovirus infections is influenced primarily by the requirement of DNA replication of these autonomous parvoviruses for mitotic cells (Tennant et al, 1969) , which determines many of the differences in the outcome of infections in fetal, neonatal or older animals. However, it is likely that not all the dividing cells in an animal are permissive for virus replication, and while the dividing lymphoid and intestinal epithelial cells are primary targets for virus replication by FPV, MEV and CPV (see below), developmentally regulated properties of some differentiated dividing cell populations may restrict parvovirus replication at the cellular level and determine the specific outcome of infection (reviewed by Cotmore and Tattersall, (1987) ). The precise relationship between the presence of dividing cells in tissues and their susceptibility to parvovirus infection in dogs, mink or cats has not been defined.\n\nThe pathogenesis of infections by FPV in cats or CPV in dogs are very similar. Both viruses are considered together below, with differences between the infections being noted where those have been defined. The site of entry and initial virus infection has not been defined in detail, but it most likely occurs through cells of the nasopharynx, the tonsils or other lymphoid tissues (Reynolds, 1970; Csiza et al, 1971a; Appel et al, 1979; Carman and Povey, 1982; Pollock 1982; Macartney et al, 1984a) . Animals also can be infected by most parenteral routes. Virus is isolated between 1 and 3 days after infection from the tonsil, retropharyngeal lymph nodes, thymus, and mesenteric lymph nodes, and after approximately 3 days virus is also recovered from the intestinal-associated lymphoid tissues and Peyer's patches (Csiza et al, 1971a; Carlson and Scott, 1977; Carlson et al, 1978; Macartney et al, 1984b; Carman and Povey, 1985a; Meunier et al, 1985a) . Virus spreads systemically through a plasma viraemia, resulting in widespread infection of the lymphoid tissues including the thymus and all lymph nodes.\n\nThe incidence of leukopenia or lymphopenia varies between the different viruses. Effects on erythrocyte levels are not seen after infection, possibly because of the long life span of the erythrocytes compared to the course of the disease.\n\nPanleukopenia is a striking feature of many FPV infections of cats ( Figure  1) , where the total white cell counts may fall to 1000-2000 mm -3 or less, and neutrophil counts decrease to less than 200ram -3. Lymphocyte numbers decline, although to a lesser degree, but there is little effect on eosinophil, basophil, monocyte, or red cell numbers (Lawrence and Syverton, 1938; Hammon and Enders, 1939a,b; Lawrence et al, 1940; Rohovsky and Griesemer, 1967; Reynolds, 1969; Ichijo et al, 1976; Larsen et al, 1976; Carlson and Scott, 1977; Hosokawa et al, 1987) .\n\nPanleukopenia is very uncommon in CPV infections, although a relative lymphopenia is often observed (Figure 2 ). Dogs infected with CPV develop relative lymphopenia, and some animals develop neutropenia, but total leukocyte counts are generally not markedly affected (Robinson et al, 1980a; Carmichael et al, 1981; Pollock, 1982; Macartney et al, 1984a; Carman and Povey, 1985a) .\n\nIn FPV and CPV infections of cats and dogs the bone marrow may be severely affected, with a marked decrease in cellularity. Most animals show decreased numbers of myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocytic cells ( Figure 3 ) (Hammon and Enders, 1939a,b; Lawrence et al, 1940; Robinson et al, 1980a; Boosinger et al, 1982; Macartney et al, 1984a; Carman and Povey, 1985a) . Individual animals differ in both the extent of the depletion and the effects on individual cell types. DNA by fluorescent antibody staining or by in situ hybridization (Kurtzman et al, 1989) . At high doses of FPV there were reductions in both erythroid and myeloid colony formation, but at lower virus doses there was a greater suppression of the myeloid (CFU-GM) colony formation compared with the erythroid (BFU-E-and CFU-E-derived) colonies ( Figure 4 ). The precise differentiated stages of the FPV-susceptible cell populations were not defined although they were presumed be early progenitors. They proposed that virus infection of the myeloid precursors would rapidly lead to reduced circulating neutrophil levels due to the rapid turnover of those cells (Kurtzman et al, 1989) .\n\nNo effect of CPV on the regeneration of erythrocytes was observed when haemolytic anaemia was induced in dogs with phenylhydrazine before CPV infection, indicating that at least for CPV in dogs the virus does not greatly depress erythroid cell production (Brock et al, 1989) . Although CPV infects canine bone marrow cells (Macartney et al, 1984b; O'Sullivan et a1,1984; Meunier et al, 1985a; Truyen and Parrish, 1992) this does not result in a panleukopenia, suggesting that CPV and FPV infect different target cells in the bone marrow and probably other tissues of their respective hosts. \n\nThe infection of the lymphoid tissues results in lymphocytolysis, cellular depletion and, subsequently, tissue regeneration in surviving animals. Virus replication and ceil destruction in lymphoid tissues occurs mostly in areas of dividing ceils, including germinal centres of lymph nodes and in the thymus cortex ( Figure 5 ) (Hammon and Enders, 1939a,b ; Lawrence e t a | , 1940; Krunajevic, 1970; Reynolds, 1970; Carlson et al, 1977; Cooper et al, 1979; Robinson et al, 1980a; Macartney et al, 1984a,b; Carman and Povey, 1985a,b; Uttenthal et al, 1990) . It is not known whether the loss of lymphocytes is due entirely to lysis of virus infected cells, but it is likely that at least some of the marked effects seen on cell numbers in the different lymphoid tissues arc due to indirect effects such as binding to the cells by the high levels of virus in the infected tissues. The role(s) of cytokines in the pathogenesis of the infection have not been examined. \n\nIntestinal infections appear very similar for all the carnivore parvoviruses. FPV or CPV infect the rapidly dividing epithelial cells in the crypts of the intestinal villi of the ileum and jejunum between 3 and 5 days after inoculation, and virus is found throughout the epithelium of those portions of the intestine 4-8 days after infection ( Figure 6 ) (Carlson and Scott, 1977; Carlson et al, 1977; Carman and Povey, 1985a; Meunier et al, 1985a; Uttenthal et al, 1990) . T h e degree and the severity of the infection are in part determined by the rate of turnover of the intestinal epithelial cells. Germfree cats showed reduced F P V replication in the small intestine ( R o h o v s k y and Griesemer, 1967; Carlson and Scott, 1977) , while treating cats with mild HCI enemas resulted in increased cell replication and virus infection of the colonic epithelium (Schindel et al, 1978) . Griesemer, 1967; Larsen et al, 1976 ; O k a n i w a et Landsverk and Nordstoga, 1978; C o o p e r et al, 1979; Yasoshima et al, 1982; Macartney et al, 1984c) . Animals may become d e h y d r a t e d and pyretic, possibly because of endotoxin uptake from the gut. Intestinal parasites or coinfection with other agents such as coronavirus or bacteria are suggested to increase the severity of the disease. During the intestinal phase of the infection virus is excreted in large amounts in the faeces--with up to 107 and 109 infectious units being shed per gram (Carmichael et al, 1981; Carman and Povey, 1985b; Meunier et al, 1985a,b) .\n\nThe clinical disease probably results from the extent of damage by virus caused to the small intestine. There is variation in the response of individual animals to virus infection, and serological studies indicate that infections by CPV in dogs (and probably by FPV in cats) are often mild or subclinical (Meunier et al, 1980; Parrish et al, 1982) . A correlation was observed between the viral titres in serum and faeces and the severity of the disease observed in dogs inoculated with CPV (Meunier et al, 1985b) .\n\nA number of attenuated strains of CPV and FPV have been isolated by repeated passage of the viruses in cells in tissue culture (Carmichael et al, 1981; Bass et al. 1982; Burtonboy et al, 1991) . The attenuating mutations in those viruses were not known, but the viruses were shed at lower titres in the faeces, suggesting that decreased replication in the intestine resulted in decreased enteritis.\n\nInfection of neonates results in different disease from that seen in older animals, and is characterized by infection of the developing cerebellum in kittens or of the heart in puppies. Enteritis is not observed in very young animals.\n\nInfection of kittens either in utero or shortly after birth can result in viral replication in the cells of the external germinal epithelium of the cerebellum, resulting in cerebella hypoplasia (Csiza et al, 1971a; Kilham et al, 1971) . Most viable kittens subsequently suffered from ataxia (Kilham et al, 1967; Csiza et at, 1971a,b) .\n\nCPV infection of neonatal puppies can result in death from myocarditis, generally between 3 and 8 weeks of age, but sometimes up to 16 weeks of age at death (Jesyk et al, 1979; Robinson et al, 1979 Robinson et al, , 1980b . Mortality in litters varied between 20 and 100%, and disease onset was rapid, and characterized by cardiac arrhythmia, dyspnoea and pulmonary oedema, followed by death (Jesyk et al, 1979; Robinson et al, 1979 Robinson et al, , 1980b Parrish et al, 1982; Meunier et al, 1984) . Affected pups suffer a variety of subclinical abnormalities with progressive multifocal necrosis of the myocardium, often with a mononuclear cell infiltrate. Myocardial cells often contained intranuclear inclu-sion bodies. Lungs may be oedematous, most likely secondary to the heart failure (Jesyk et al, 1979; Robinson et al, 1980b) . The age dependence of the myocardial infection is probably due to the active cell division of the myocardial cells in pups only under 15 days of age (Bishop, 1972) .\n\nMore rarely, neonatal infections can give a generalized infection with lesions in many different tissues (Lenghaus and Studdert, 1982; Johnson and Castro, 1984) . In utero infections of cats by FPV or Arctic foxes by BFPV may result in fetal death and resorption, abortion or neonatal death (Kilham et al, 1967 (Kilham et al, , 1971 Veijalainen and Smeds, 1988) .\n\nThe course of infection is rapid, with little virus being recovered from tissues or faeces by 10-14 days post-infection (Csiza et al, 1971a; Macartney et al, 1984b) . The functional immunity against these viruses which acts both for recovery and to protect against infection appears to be mediated through serum antibody. T-cell epitopes in the CPV sequences recognized by dog lymphocytes have been defined within the capsid protein gene (Rimmelzwaan et al, 1990 ). Colostrum-derived maternal immunity protects against parvovirus infection until serum antibody titres decline to very low levels (Parrish et al, 1982; Pollock and Carmichael, 1982; Ishibashi et al, 1983; Macartney et al, 1988) . The role of local immunity in the gut is not known, although levels and classes of antibody in the jejunum collected by cannulation after CPV infection or vaccination suggested that the-antibody was being specifically secreted (Nara et al, 1983) . However, parenteral administration of anti-CPV antibodies both protect dogs against oral challenge and prevent virus replication in the intestine (Ishibashi et al, 1983; Meunier et al, 1985a ).\n\nThese virus infections are interesting models where the emergence of new viruses apparently occurred through the acquisition of host range differences in the capsid protein gene, leading to infection of a new host family. The pathogenesis of CPV and FPV infection has been well defined, and is largely dependent on the requirement of the virus for dividing cells for replication, making the diseases age dependent. However, poorly defined differences in the susceptibility of cell populations in the bone marrow, the heart or the cerebellum of the cat and dog also give rise to distinct outcomes of various virus and host combinations.\n\nFeline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and canine parvovirus (CPV) are autonomous parvoviruses which infect cats or dogs, respectively. Both viruses cause an acute disease, with virus replicating for less than seven days before being cleared by the developing immune responses. The viruses have a broad tropism for mitotically active cells. In neonatal animals the viruses replicate in a large number of tissues, and FPV infection of the germinal epithelium of the cerebellum leads to cerebellar hypoplasia, while CPV may infect the hearts of neonatal pups, causing myocarditis. In older animals the virus replicates systemically, primarily in the primary and secondary lymphoid tissues, and also in the rapidly replicating cells of the small intestinal epithelial crypts. A transient panleukopenia or relative lymphopenia is often observed after FPV or CPV infection, respectively. Whether the reduction in cell numbers in vivo is due to virus replicating in and killing cells, or due to other indirect effects, is not known. However, FPV kills both erythroid and myeloid colony progenitors in in vitro bone marow cultures, and it has been suggested that virus replication in the myeloid cells in vivo could lead to the reduced neutrophil levels seen after FPV infection of cats."}
