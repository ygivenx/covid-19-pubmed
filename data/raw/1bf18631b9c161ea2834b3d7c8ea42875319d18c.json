{"title": "Supporting Information", "body": "Cell Lines. Vero cells (ATCC CCL81) and Calu-3 cells (ATCC HTB-55) were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS with 1% penicillin and streptomycin and with 1% sodium pyruvate. Caco-2 cells (originally from ATCC-HTB-37) were kindly provided by Christian Drosten, University of Bonn, Bonn and were cultured as above with the additional supplement of 1% nonessential amino acids. Trypsin was used for detachment of cells during subculture, but Accutase (PAA Laboratories/GE) was used for the subculture of Caco-2 cells. Cell lines were routinely tested to exclude mycoplasma contamination. Cell lines from ATCC were authenticated by ATCC and were not validated further in our laboratory.\n\nMERS-CoV Virus Isolation. Vero and Caco-2 cells were used to attempt virus isolation from selected specimens with high viral load (4) . Two hundred fifty microliters of each selected specimen in virus transport medium were inoculated onto cells seeded in 24well tissue-culture plates (TPP Techno Plastic Products). These were incubated for 1 h in a 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 humidified incubator, and then 750 \u03bcL of DMEM with 2% FCS was added. Next day, the inoculum was replaced with 1 mL fresh DMEM with 2% FCS. If a cytopathic effect (CPE) developed, the cells and supernatant were harvested together and passaged onto fresh cells, and aliquots were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further use. To optimize conditions for primary virus isolation, parallel cultures were set up in the presence of DMEM without FCS with L-(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)treated trypsin for both Vero (0.3 \u03bcg/mL trypsin) and Caco-2 (0.2 \u03bcg/mL trypsin) cells.\n\nPhylogenetic Analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV was carried out using the maximum-likelihood method (PhyML) (5) . The time-resolved phylogeny tree was based on a full-genome alignment of all of the coding regions of the virus and was reconstructed using the BEAST software package (6) by using an independent general time reversible (GTR) substitution model and gamma rate heterogeneity model for each codon position, an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock (7), and a Bayesian Skygrid tree prior (8) . The output of the model parameters was examined for adequate effective sample size (ESS) values.\n\nClonality Classification of Loci Observed in MERS-CoV Genomes. A maximum-likelihood phylogeny of 291 complete or nearly complete MERS-CoV genomes was recovered with PhyML (5) under a HKY+\u0393 (9, 10) model of nucleotide substitution. ClonalFrameML (11) was used to reconstruct ancestral sequences on nodes in the PhyML phylogeny and to map substitutions onto individual branches. Each substitution was classified as apparently occurring once in the phylogeny (likely to have arisen via mutation), more than once (likely to be part of a recombined tract), or a reversion from a substitution occurring ancestrally (even more likely to be part of a recombined tract).\n\nAssembly and Modification of a Full-Length BAC cDNA Clone to Rescue Wild-Type and Mutant Recombinant MERS-CoV. A MERS-CoV infectious cDNA clone was constructed based on an isolate of MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012 provided to C.D. by R. Fouchier (Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam). It was assembled from three cDNA subclones in a BAC using a stepwise cloning strategy with rescue of infectious virus from in vitro-transcribed RNA as described in ref. 12 . Cell cultureadaptive mutations were corrected during construction of the cDNA clone so that the original MERS-CoV EMC/2012 sequence (GenBank accession no. JX869059) was recovered. To delete ORF4b, we used a two-step markerless Red recombination technique as in ref. 13 . In a first step, a kanamycinresistance gene was amplified by overhang-extension PCR from the pEP-KanS vector (kindly provided by K. Osterrieder, Freie Universitat Berlin) with primers containing homologous MERS-CoV recombination sites, the desired mutation, and an I-SceI restriction site (MERS-\u0394-ABC-Kana-F: ATTCGCGCAAAGC-GAGGAAGAGGAGCCATTCTCCAACTAATGATGTTG-TCTCCATACGGTCTTTAGGGATAACAGGGTAATCGA-TTT and MERS-\u0394-BCD-Kana-R: TTGTTTATTACCCT-GATTGGAAGACCGTATGGAGACAACATCATTAGTT-GGAGAATGGCTCCTGCCAGTGTTACAACCAATTAACC). Escherichia coli GS1783 cells (kindly provided by K. Osterrieder) containing the MERS-CoV cDNA clone were transfected with the PCR product to induce recombination of the transfer construct into the MERS-CoV backbone. In a second step the kanamycin-selection marker was excised by an inducible in vivo I-SceI cleavage. Rescue of the resulting full-length cDNA construct was done as for wild type.\n\nPhenotypic Characterization of Viruses. Experiments to compare viral replication kinetics of different viruses in Calu-3 cells were carried out in 24-well tissue-culture plates. We measured virus replication kinetics by TCID 50 titrations in Vero cells as previously described (14) . RNA was collected for analysis of gene expression and quantification of viral RNA as previously described (14) . Quantification of viral RNA and cytokine and chemokine mRNA gene expression and cytokine protein assays in Calu-3 cells was carried out as previously described (14) .\n\nFor the virus replication in ex vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung, we infected bronchial and lung tissues with each MERS-CoV virus by incubating in 1 mL with EMC, AH13, or BF785 virus at a titer of 10 6 TCID 50 /mL at 37\u00b0C. Tissues incubated with DMEM served as controls. Culture supernatants were titrated in parallel for infectious virus using the TCID 50 assay. At 24 and 48 h postinfection, the ex vivo tissue fragments were fixed in 10% formalin and processed for immunohistochemistry to detect MERS-CoV antigen expression (14) . Tissues from three donors were used for biological replicate experiments.\n\nSensitivity of Different MERS-CoV to IFN-\u03b2. The sensitivity of different MERS-CoV to IFN-\u03b2 was compared as follows (15) . Vero cells were plated in 96-well plates 24 h before IFN treatment. AVONEX IFN-\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2-1a liquid-formulated drug product; Biogen) was diluted in Eagles's minimal essential medium (MEM) medium supplemented with 2% FBS to final concentrations of 0.11-100 ng/mL and was added to the cells, and plates were incubated for 18 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and infected with the respective coronavirus at an MOI of 0.01. Viral titers in the culture supernatants were determined by a TCID 50 assay.\n\nMicroneutralization Test. The sera were heat inactivated for 30 min at 56\u00b0C before the serology tests were carried out as previously described (16) . Twofold dilutions of sera were incubated with an equal volume of 200 tissue-culture infectious doses (TCID 50 ) of MERS-CoV. After 1 h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the virus serum mixture was added in quadruplicate to preformed Vero cell monolayers in 96-well microtiter plates (TPP Techno Plastic Products). CPE was observed at 3 d post infection. The highest serum dilution that completely protected the cells from CPE in two or more of the four wells was taken as the neutralizing titer. Virus back titrations were carried out in each assay to confirm that the virus challenge dose was within the expected range.\n\nExperimental Infection of Mice. The procedure for transducing mice with an adenovirus vector expressing human DPP4 has been previously described (17) . Seven-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were transduced with adenovirus 5 vector carrying the human DPP4 gene. Mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and transduced intranasally with 2.5 \u00d7 10 8 pfu of Ad5-hDPP4 in 75 \u03bcL of DMEM. Five days later they were infected intranasally with 1 \u00d7 10 4 pfu (volume of 50 \u03bcL) of MERS-CoV strain EMC, AH13, or BF785. Three mice were used for each time point and for each virus. Three mice per group were killed at 3 and 5 d post infection, the lungs were removed and homogenized, and infectivity was titrated in as pfu in Vero cells. Seven days after infection, animals were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by zinc formalin; lungs were removed, fixed in zinc formalin, and paraffin embedded. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological analysis. All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee at the University of Iowa.\n\nStatistical Analysis. The statistical analyses for viral replication, quantitative cytokine and chemokine mRNAs, and viral RNA expression levels were performed using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's corrections. Normality and other assumptions for statistical were met. Where necessary (viral titers, viral UpE gene copy numbers, and ISG15 and MX1 mRNA expression levels), log 10 transformation was carried out to achieve normal distribution. All datasets passed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and had similar variances by using Brown-Forsythe test.\n\nWe also assessed the extent of the overall viral replication using AUC analysis (Fig. S5 A and B) using the trapezoid rule (14, 18) . We used the area calculated from 24 to 48 h postinfection above the limit of detection of infectious virus titer for the analysis, and the results were compared with one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's correction.\n\nStatistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. Statistical analyses were done with GraphPad Prism version 7.0. No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size. No samples were excluded from the analysis. Quantifications of viral titers (TCID 50 ), viral RNA, and cytokine or chemokine mRNA levels were carried out by a technician blinded to the group allocations. Fig. S1 . Time-resolved phylogenetic tree of MERS-CoV. The tree shown is the maximum clade credibility tree of 9,000 post-burnin trees sampled from a run of 10 million states. Bayesian posterior probabilities of the major clade are shown along with 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals for node times denoted by bars. Sample collection dates are given in the labels (yyyy/mm/dd), and GenBank accession numbers are given in brackets. . Deletions with lengths of 11, 7, and 5 nt are out of frame, and the others are in-frame deletions. Deletions and insertions were also observed at the 3\u2032 end of ORF3 from type i/ii virus from Nigeria (Nig004, Nig1405, \u2212Nig2040) and five type i/iii viruses from Burkina Faso (BF697, BF698, BF748, BF750, and BF764), resulting in the truncation of the 103-aa (AmA) ORF3 polypeptide to 98 and 84 aa, respectively. These two types of viruses with indels are monophyletic in our genome phylogenetic analysis, although the changes are at different sites and may have been acquired separately. One of the deletions found in type i/iii viruses overlaps and extends the deletion found in type i/ii virus. Fig. 2 ).

The magnification of the main panels and the insets are 200\u00d7 and 600\u00d7, respectively. Statistical significance was determined by a one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's correction (A, B, and D) or a two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's correction (C), and is indicated as follows: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 compared with EMC; ##, P < 0.01; ###, P < 0.001 compared with AH13; ++, P < 0.01 compared with BF785. Camels were immunized with an EMC vaccinia-vectored vaccine. C7 is a postimmunization dromedary camel immune serum. C140 and c145 are field-collected MERS-CoV immune sera from naturally infected dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.\n\nDataset S1 (XLSX) Dataset S2 (XLSX) Fig. S8 . Comparison of innate immune responses in Calu-3 cells infected with reverse-genetically engineered MERS-CoV rgEMC-WT and rgEMC\u03944b. Calu-3 cells were infected at an MOI of 2 with MERS-CoVs rgEMC-WT and rgEMC\u03944b; mock-infected cells served as negative controls (as shown in Fig. 4) . Cell lysates were collected at 6, 24, and 48 h postinfection, and mRNA expression of the IFN-inducible genes IP-10, ISG15, and MX1 and the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 is shown as the mean and SEM of three biological replicates. The detection limit of each gene was 20 copies. The experiment was repeated once, and a representative experiment is shown. Statistical significance was determined by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's comparisons: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001."}
