{"title": "Archives of Virology Determination of Different Antigenic Sites on the Adenovirus Hexon Using Monoclonal Antibodies", "body": "Monoclonal antibodies have proven to be useful tools in determining the important antigenic regions of structural virus proteins. The introduction of the MAbs into the antigenic analysis of adenovirus hexon protein resulted the recognition that the capsomer has more complicated antigenic structure as was known earlier (5, 12, 13, 14, 18) . Using a panel of MAbs produced against crystallized AV 1 hexon for the examination of purified heterologous hexons it was demonstrated that on the surface of the hexon a large number of epitopes do exist, some of which are overlapping and characterized as interspeeies speeifieities (2) .\n\nIn the present paper, we report on the delineation of different antigenic sites and epitopes (epitopes clusters) of the adenovirus hexon by means of competitive binding ELISA.\n\nHuman adenovirus types 1, 2, 5, and 6 (subgenus C), 8, 9, 10 , and 13 (subgenus D), 12 (subgenus A), 7 and 35 (subgenus B) were used in the experiments for determining the cross-reactivity of the MAbs. All these strains were propagated on HEp-2 cells, and the soluble hexon proteins of all virus types were separated and purified as described earlier (9, 11).\n\nSpleen cells of Balb/c mice immunized with crystallized AV 1 hexon were fused with Sp 2/0 myeloma cells. Hybrid cells producing specific MAbs were inoculated i.p. into mice, and the developed ascites was sucked from the abdomen. The reactivity patterns of the MAbs were determined with ll different hexon types using indirect ELISA (2).\n\nSaturated ammonium sulphate was added to the ascitic fluids to a final concentration of 40 per cent. After centrifugation at 2000 \u00d7 g for 20 minutes, the pellet was resuspended in 40 per cent saturated ammonium sulphate. After three times repeated centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in distilled water and dialysed against PBS pH 7.2, at 4 \u00b0 C, overnight.\n\nMAbs were diMysed against 0.15 M NaC1 and labelled with horseradish peroxidase (I~EANAL, Budapest) according to the technique of AVnEMEAS and TER~YNCK (1). Briefly, 10 mg peroxidase were dissolved in 0.2 ml phosphate buffer pH 6.8 containing 1 per cent glutaraldehyde, incubated at room temperature for 18 hours, and passed through a Sephadex G-25 column. Brown-eoloured fractions were eollected and added to 5 mg of MAbs. The mixture was stored at 4 \u00b0 C for 24 hours, and dialysed extensively against PBS. Before competitive-binding assays, each conjugate was titrated by direct ELISA, and used in the competition experiments in predetermined dilutions with a resulting absorbance of approx. 1.4, measured at 492 nm.\n\nPolystyrene plates (Novogen) were coated with purified AV 1 hexon (250 ng in 50 ~1/ well) in PBS pH 7.2, overnight. Nonspecific binding was reduced to a minimum by the addition of PBS-Tween 20 containing 0.5 per cent BSA (Serva, Heidelberg) for i hour. Dilutions of untabelled competitor MAbs causing 100 per cent inhibition of the own labelled probe were the starting dilutions (dilution factor 1), and serial two-fold dilutions of compctiter MAbs were added, followed immediately by the predetermined dilution of the labelled MAbs. The plates were incubated for 90 minutes at 37 \u00b0 C, then washed and the bound peroxidase-lahelled MAbs were detected by adding 50 ~1 of ortho-phenylenediamine (OPD). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 ~l of 4 M H~S04 per well. Optical density was determined at 492 nm with a Titertek Multiskan photometer. Since the nonspecific binding of individual conjugates varied considerably, binding to control antigen (BSA) was taken to represent background, and binding of each conjugate to viral antigen as maximum binding. This difference was taken to represent 100 per cent binding, and the relative inhibition by the competing first antibody was normalized to this scale in each individual test. Results were expressed as a percentage of competition, and rated as complete inhibition if the first three dilutions caused more than 70 per cent reduction of absorbanee, partial inhibition if the reduction was between 60 to 40 per cent and results were considered negative if the reduction of absorbance was not more than \u00a20 per cent (17) .\n\nOn the other hand, competitive-binding ELISA was performed with a mixture of labelled MAbs (designated 1A 3, 2 A I, 2 A 6, and 2 B 2) and different concentrations of purified hexon types preineubated at 37 \u00b0 C for 2 hours (6). The wells were coated with AV 1 hexon (5 ~g/ml) and the inhibiting ability of different hexon types was calculated as mentioned above.\n\nEighteen MAbs were used in unlabelled and peroxid~se-labelled form to differentiate topographically distinct antigenic sites on AV 1 hexon. The terminology of YEWDELL ~nd GERHARD (19) WaS used to define the epitopes and antigenic sites, i.e., an antigenic site consists of a cluster of epitopes, and the epitope is the combining site of a single MAb.\n\nThree different antigenic sites could be separated on the basis of reciprocal competition experiments (Table 1) . Epitope(s) of antigenic site I recognized by two NLa~bs is completely different from antigenic sites II and III, i.e., MAbs 1A3 and 2 C2 cause complete inhibition of each other Ill  II  I I I I  III  I  I  I   II  I I I I  III  I  I  I  I I I T.\n\nx recognizing probably the same epitope on the antigenic site I and these MAbs could not inhibit the binding of the labelled MAbs specific for antigenic sites II and III (Fig. 1) . MAbs specific for antigenic site II did not inhibit the binding of the peroxidase labelled MAbs specific for antigenic site I, but could cause complete and partial inhibition of the binding of the MAbs specific for different epitope clusters of antigenic site II (Table 1) . MAb H 12 could not inhibit the binding of the MAbs of antigenic site I (Fig. 1) . This MAb partially inhibited the binding of the MAbs specific for antigenic site II, showing only a one-way blocking pattern (unidireetionM blocking) (Fig. 2) . As only reciprocal (bidirectional) complete blocking was taken to indicate identical antigenic sites, MAb H 12 probably recognizes a separate, third antigenic site (Table 1) .\n\nEpitopes on the antigenic site II could be clustered into seven groups based on complete and partial reciprocal inhibition ( Table 1) . MAbs of epitope cluster II/1 completely inhibit the binding of the MAbs II/2 to II/4, and partially inhibit the binding of MAbs specific for epitope clusters II/5 to II/7 (Fig. 3) . This kind of competition patterns could characterize two larger groups of closely related epitopes. One of them could be the epitopes clustered as II/1 to II/4, and the other characterized as epitopes II/5 to II/ 7. The differentiation of epitope cluster II/2 to II/4 is based on the different partial reciproeaI inhibition of the MAbs grouped into these clusters. MAbs of epitope cluster II/2 completely inhibit the binding of MAbs specific for epitopes ofII/1, II/3 and II/4 in reciprocal fashion, but they can inhibit each l~vA ~D\u00a3M et at.: (Table 1) . MAb specific for epitope cluster II/1 completely inhibits the binding of the representatives of epitope clusters II/2 to II/4, and partially inhibits the binding of the MAbs specific for epitope clusters II/5 to II/7. \u2022 2 C 3/I D 2; O 2 C 3/2 C 6;\n\n\u2022 2C3/1A6; Y 2 C 3 / 2 D 6 ; \u00d7 2C3/2A1; 1~2C3/2A6 other partially (Fig. 4) . MAbs of epitope cluster I I / 3 show a n o t h e r form of reciprocal competition, i.e., one of the MAbs (2 C 4) partially-inhibits the binding of three other MAbs (2 C 6, 1 B 2 and 2 A 5), and the latter three MAbs completely inhibit each other (Fig. 5 ). MAbs specific for epitope cluster I I / 4 show similar inhibition p a t t e r n s as those of epitope cluster 1I/3. It means, t h a t one Mbkb of this group (2 B 5) could partially inhibit the binding of two other MAbs (1 A 6 and 2 C 1) showing reciprocal partial inhibition patterns, but the two latter MAbs completely inhibit the binding of each \n\nFor the determination of the presence of different AV 1 hexon related epitopes on the heterologous hexon types, four of the labelled MAbs (1 A 3, 2 A t, 2 A 6, and 2 B 2) were mixed with serial dilutions (5 to 40 ~g/ml) of different hexon types. After preincubation at 37 \u00b0 C 50 ~l of each mixture was added to AV 1 hexon coated wells and the absorbanees were determined both in the presence and in the absence of heterologous hexon types. types of the same subgenus (types 2, 5, and 6). As can be seen, in the case of the MAbs 1 A 3, 2 A 1, and 2 A 6, each hexon types mixed with the MAbs causes nearly 100 per cent inhibition. The results with types 1, 2, and 6 were similar, when mixed MAb 2 B 2, while type 5 could not compete the binding of this MAb. The curves representing the competition with heterologous types of subgenus D (Fig. 8 a-c) only in the case of MAb 1 A 3 are similar to the types of subgenus C, and in high concentration of type 9 with MAbs 2 A 1, 2 A 6, and 2 B 2. Hexon types 8 and 10 could not cause complete inhibition even in high concentration.\n\nEighteen MAbs were used in unlabelled and peroxidase-tabelled form in reciprocal competitive binding ELISA to map the antigenic structure of the hexon. Each MAb was compared with all other MAbs and the inhibition patterns were characterized as complete or partial, bidireetionM (reciprocM) or undireetional (one-way) inhibition (4).\n\nAt least three antigenic sites (I to III) were determined on the base of the results, and seven epitope clusters (epitopes) could be separated on the antigenie site II. The two MAbs (1A 3 and 2 C 2) specific for antigenic site I recognize the same epitope, i.e., the genus specific one. These MAbs have broad reactivity patterns, because they reacted with. the hexons of all human AV types studied by ELISA and HA (2) , and with bovine AV type 3 in gel precipitation experiment (3) . Their specificity to sterically independent epitopes comparing to MAbs H 12, 2 A 1, and 1 B 2 were also demonstrated by gel diffusion experiments. MAb H 12, however reacted with all human AV types tested, failed to react with bovine AV type 3 both in ELISA and I~ (unpublished data), as well as in gel diffusion experiments (3). This MAb did not inhibit the binding of the two MAbs specific for antigenic site I and showed only unidirectional complete blocking of the MAbs specific for the antigenic site II. These findings suggest that the epitope recognized by MAb H 12 should be considered as a sterieMly distinct antigenic determinant (site III).\n\nOn the other hand, competition-binding ELISA showed that a large number of cross-reacting epitopes are present on the adenovirus hexon. At least seven epitope dusters on the antigenic site II determined by fifteen MAbs show some similarity to each other on the basis of different, kinds of complete or mutuM unidirectional inhibition patterns. The cause of the nonreciprocal (unidirectional or one-way) inhibition could be a static change of the epitope due to the attached MAb, which than prevents partiMly the binding of the labelled MAbs. Neighbouring epitopes may be located in a groove on the surface of the antigenic site, therefore the binding of the competing MAb could sterieMty block the access of the labelled l~L~b specific for a different epitope in the groove (7, 8, 10, 15) . A further explanation could be the differences due to a n t i b o d y avidities (16) .\n\nThe analysis of the antigenic structure of the adenovirus hexon leads to two m a j o r conclusions. On the one hand, the nine epitopes (epitope clusters) identified b y eighteen MAbs can be located on three distinct p r e s u m a b l y n o n o v e r l a p p i n g antigenic sites. On the other hand, the d a t a suggest t h a t seven epitope clusters identified b y fifteen MAbs on the antigenic site II contain partially o v e r l a p p i n g epitopes and m a y be a p a r t of a large single i m m u n o d o m i n a n t region on the AV 1 hexon as well as on the heterologous h e x o n types, as s u g g e s t e d by the e x p e r i m e n t s with heterologous hexons."}
