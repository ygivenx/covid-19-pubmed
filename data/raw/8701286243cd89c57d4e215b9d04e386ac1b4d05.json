This question is of particular importance, because (1) defenestration of hepatic sinusoids has been evoked as a cause of hyperlipoproteinemia14; (2) several authors have speculated about an eventual role of viruses in atherogenesis, s\n\nIn this study we demonstrate that mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3), which infects EC, 43'44 produces a considerable reduction in the number of their fenestrae, thus leading to a drastic diminution in the porosity of the cells.\n\nThe role of the endothelial cells (EC) of the hepatic sinusoid as a sieving barrier between the sinusoid and the space of Disse has been evoked by several authors. 1-11 We demonstrated that the damage to the sinusoidal lining allows viruses that are normally nonhepatotropic to infect hepatocytes. 12'13 Although the experimental evidence is still limited, there are some arguments to support the view that EC may control the entry of chylomicrons into the space of Disse ~3 and thus play a role in the lipoprotein metabolism of the liver. 6-s Moreover, it appears that the filtering capacity Mice. A/J and BALB/c mice (20 to 25 g body weight) were obtained from the Centre de S~lection et d'Elevage d'Animaux de Laboratoire (Orl4ans, France) and IFFA CREDO (L'Arbresle, France), respectively, and kept under conventional conditions. Care of animals followed the appropriate guidelines. Six-to 8-week-old animals were infected intraperitoneally with 2 \u00d7 103 pfu (plaque-forming units) of MHV3 for 24 (5 animals) and 48 (5 animals) hours.\n\nImmunization. A nonpathogen temperature-sensitive mutant of MHV3, D22245 was injected three times intraperitoneally at 2-week intervals into BALB/c mice (103 pfu/injection).\n\nChemicals. Collagenase CLS from Clostridium histolyticure was purchased from Worthington (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). CB, obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St Louis, MO), was dissolved with dimethylsulfoxide (2.5 mg/mL) and then diluted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium to obtain a final concentration of 10 #g/mL. Liver Perfusion In Situ. Mice were anesthetized with ether and their livers perfused in situ through the portal vein with oxygenated Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with or without 10 #g/mL CB, at a flow rate of 2 mL/min for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. The livers were then fixed by perfusion for electron microscopy. 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.075 mol/L cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 4.5% sucrose, 1 mmol/L MgC12 and 1 mmol/L CaC12. The livers were fixed by perfusion through the portal vein with the same fixative. For transmission electron microscopy, the cells and small liver blocks were postfixed with 1% phosphate-buffered OSO4, dehydrated with ethanol, and embedded in Lx 112 (Ladd, Burlington, VT). For scanning electron microscopy, the cells and the liver samples were dehydrated with ethanol, dried with hexamethyldisilazane, 4s and coated with gold.\n\nFor freeze-fracture, small blocks of livers were immersed in 30% glycerol in cacodylate buffer for at least 1 hour at 4\u00b0C then cut to fit in the specimen holder and frozen in subcooled nitrogen. Freeze-fracture replicas obtained in a Reichert-Jung 190 Cryofract freeze-fracture device (Cambridge Instruments, Villepinte, France) were cleaned with sodium hypochloride, washed in three changes of distilled water, and mounted on hexagonal 700-mesh gold grids. The samples were observed either in a Philips EM 410 or in a Philips SEM 501 B (Eindhoven, The Netherlands) electron microscope, respectively.\n\nMorphometry. The measurements of the different parameters were performed on scanning electron microscopy photographs with a Kontron semiautomatic MOP videoplan analyzer (Eching-Munich, Germany). To determine the diameter and the porosity (which is the percentage of the cell surface opened by fenestrae), approximately 1,000 #m 2 was measured at a magnification of )<20,000.\n\ninfection, most of the liver tissue of BALB/c mice is well preserved: there are no necrotic foci, no obvious cellular alterations, and a few Kupffer cells and EC appear to be infected by the virus u n d e r electron microscopy (results not shown). However, as compared with EC from a control mouse, which exhibit typical sieve plates (Fig. 1A) , all the EC of infected mice a p p e a r r a t h e r devoid of pores in the whole liver after 48 hours (Fig. 1B ). This reduction in the n u m b e r of fenestrae was restricted to the periportal area 24 hours after infection. MHV3 particles on the way to, or t h a t have already been released by, the cell could also be observed (Fig. 1C ). The cellular surface displays an irregular aspect because of the presence of n u m e r o u s small bulging craters (Fig. 1C) , which m a y r e p r e s e n t the stage preceding the disappearance of the fenestrae.\n\nMorphometric examinations have d e m o n s t r a t e d a drop in the porosity of the endothelial lining from 10.0 _+ 3% in controls, to 1.0 _+ 0.2% in 48-hour-infected mice, the d i a m e t e r of the fenestrae being 100 _+ 16 n m and 73 _+ 13 nm, respectively. The decrease in the porosity of the endothelial lining was also observed in cryofracture preparations. In control animals, clusters of rounded structures containing ice and therefore representing fenestrae were disseminated all over the surface of the sinusoid ( Fig. 2A) . In contrast, the surface of sinusoids of infected mice displayed a reduced number of fenestrae (Fig. 2B) . It m u s t be noticed t h a t besides this lack of pores, the m e m b r a n e of the EC seemed normal, as far as the n u m b e r and a p p e a r a n c e of the i n t r a m e m b r a n e particles are concerned. The reduction in the n u m b e r of pores was also confirmed by the observation of thin sections from 48-hourinfected mice livers. At the same time, n u m e r o u s virus particles have been produced and m a y be found either in the EC (Fig. 3A) or in the space of Disse on the MHV3, in which the replication of the virus is restricted. BALB/c mice were immunized with a thermosensitive mutant of MHV3 conferring protection against a lethal challenge with the wild strain. When immunized animals were infected with MHV3, neither viral antigens nor necrotic foci could be detected. Examination under scanning electron microscopy of liver specimens of animals infected for 48 hours showed well-preserved fenestrae (Fig. 4A) with a porosity similar to controls of around 10%.\n\nIn A/J mice, viral replication in the liver is restricted. Forty-eight hours after infection, only a few inflammatory foci may be found. At the same time, the fenestration pattern of the EC appears similar to that of uninfected animals (Fig. 4B) , with a porosity of approximately 10%. way to infect the hepatocytes (Fig. 3B ). MHV3 antigens shown by immunofluorescence were frequently associated with the endothelial lining at that time of infection (results not shown). \n\nTwenty-four-hour cultures of EC isolated from BALB/c mice were infected with MHV3 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 and fixed 24 hours later. As may be seen in Fig. 5A , the fenestrae in uninfected cells are well preserved and arranged in sieve plates. In the syncytia resulting from the infection (Fig. 5B ) the fenestrae have almost completely disappeared (Fig. 5C) , and numerous newly formed virus particles may be observed at the cell surface ( Fig. 5C and 5D ). It should also be noted that single cells whose infection with MHV3 was not obvious were also devoid of fenestrae (results not shown).\n\nIn a recent study we reported that the treatment of EC with CB (10 #g/mL) induces a 3 to 4 times increase in the number of fenestrae. 35 In the current work we wondered if infected EC were still responsive to that drug. Therefore, livers of mice infected with MHV3 for 48 hours were perfused with CB during 1 hour, but no fenestrae could be induced (Fig. 6A ) as compared with livers of uninfected mice treated in the same way (Fig.  6B) . The porosity of these CB-perfused livers reached less than 1% in infected mice versus about 20% in controls. The same experiment done with cultured EC led to similar conclusions. If a 2-hour treatment of control cells resulted in a striking increase in the number of fenestrae (Fig. 6C) , infected EC demonstrated only a few enlarged pores (Fig. 6D) .\n\nThe first target for MHV3 infection in the liver is Kupffer and endothelial cells in which the virus multiplies before being released into the space of Disse, from where it may infect the hepatocytes. 44 We have already stressed the role of the sinusoidal cells in the pathogenesis of MHV3 by demonstrating that genetically resistant mice become susceptible to the virus if their sinusoidal lining is damaged. 13 Levy et al found more viral antigen in \"reticuloendothelial cells\" of susceptible BALB/c mice than in those of resistant A/J mice. 49 The decrease in the number of fenestrae seems to be the first visible alteration of hepatic EC infected with MHV3. This change affects the EC in the liver of infected animals as well as EC infected in vitro. The decrease in the number of fenestrae starts in the vicinity of the periportal area as early as 24 hours after infection and affects the whole sinusoid after 48 hours as demonstrated by a decrease in the porosity. Levy et al, who studied the perturbations in the microcirctflation during MHV3 infection, found that microthrombi in the sinusoids, which we observed also in our study, after 24 hours of infection were most frequently localized in the periportal zone. 49 The fact that MHV3 does not induce a modification in the pattern of the fenestration in immunized BALB/c mice or in genetically resistant A/J mice demonstrates that viral multiplication is necessary for this phenomenon to occur. Moreover, the defenestration is due to the direct action of the virus and not to a mediator because it may be produced in cultured infected cells. In cells infected in vitro with MHV3, the fenestrae disappear not only in multinucleated cells but also in single cells, and there is direct relationship between the amount of viral particles or viral antigen and the intensity of defenestration. This argues for an early step of the viral cycle to be involved. Two factors may be responsible for the change in the fenestration pattern: (1) a fusion process of the cellular membrane, because MHV3 is a fusion-inducing virus; (2) an alteration of the cytoskeleton. High amounts of MHV3 may lead to the fusion of cells within 45 minutes, when glycoprotein E2, the fusion protein, is cleaved in two 90 K fragments. 5\u00b0'51 One may thus speculate that disappearance of fenestrae by membrane fusion may occur as early as MHV3 released from lyzed KC enters in contact with the membrane of the EC. Conversely, fusion of cellular membrane occurs in the course of the infection: newly synthesized virus-specific proteins that mediate the appearance of the typical syncytia are \n\nwith the cytoskeleton is only poorly documented. Mallucci and Edwards 53 have shown that there is a relationship between cell fusion and the actin myosin system. An alteration of the cytoskeleton may already occur in MHV3 infection during the first stages when the viral particles penetrate into the cells by fusion, which may lead to changes in the permeability of the membrane, allowing small ions to destabilize the cytoskeleton.\n\nWe are studying the interactions between primary cultures of human liver sinusoidal cells with human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1. 54 This retrovirus known to induce also cellular fusions leads to no obvious modifications of the fenestration pattern in the liver of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients. Moreover, in vitro, fenestrae are still present in virusproducing human liver EC. 54 We observed the same phenomenon in cat liver endothelial cells infected with FIV, the feline immunodeficiency virus (manuscript in preparation). It must be stressed that in the EC infected with these two retroviruses we could not detect any alterations of the microfilaments (Unpublished results).\n\nA decrease in the number of fenestrae has been reported in diverse pathological situations like tumor invasion of the liver 19'23'34 and ethanol absorption. ~7'2\u00b0'2~'27 A loss of sieve plates was also observed in chronic active hepatitis 55 but, because the liver biopsy specimens were fixed by immersion, caution must be exerted to interpret these results. One may wonder what the consequences of the defenestration in vivo may be. It has been postulated that the decreased porosity of the liver sieve hinders the passage of cholesterol-rich chylomicron remnants from the blood to the hepatocytes and induces perturbation of the lipoprotein metabolism, thus favoring accumulation of fat in the hepatocytes, which could be a factor in atherogenesis, s The steatosis characterized by an increased amount of neutral lipids described in the livers of MHV3-infected mice by others in our laboratory ~ has also been observed in the current study, but the relationship between the decrease in the porosity and steatosis could not be established until now. Moreover, the infection of mice with a thermosensitive mutant of MHV3, which does not change the porosity of the EC, nevertheless produces an acute steatosisF"}
