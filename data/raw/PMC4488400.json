{"title": "Molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic analysis of diverse bovine\nastroviruses associated with diarrhea in cattle and water buffalo calves in\nChina", "body": "Samples: A total of 211 rectal swabs were collected from calves, aged 0\u20136\nmonths, with mild to severe diarrhea from five industrial farms (3 dairy and 2 water\nbuffalo) in Guangxi province, China. All samples were collected in sterile tubes containing\n10 ml of 1/100 antibiotic 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline and transported\non ice to our laboratory within 24 hr. Samples were homogenized by vortexing for 5 min at\nroom temperature and centrifuged at 3,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, and then, the supernatant\nwas aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until assayed.\n\nNucleic acid extraction and cDNA bank synthesis: RNA was extracted from\n300 \u00b5l of the supernatant obtained from each rectal swab using the RNAiso\nPLUS kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Dalian, China) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nExtracted RNA was eluted in 35 \u00b5l of RNase-free H2O (Takara Bio,\nInc.) and used for first strand cDNA bank synthesis with the PrimeScript II 1st strand cDNA\nSynthesis kit (Takara Bio, Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nDetection of bovine astrovirus and genome cloning and sequencing: Bovine\nastrovirus was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis\nusing the degenerate primer pair (forward) DPF 5\u2032-GAYTGGACBCGHTWTGATGG-3\u2032 and (reverse) DPR\n5\u2032-KYTTRACCCACATNCCAA-3\u2032 to target a 418-bp fragment of the RdRp region common to\nastroviruses, as described previously [21] with some\nmodifications. Some of the RT-PCR-positive samples were sequenced and primarily analyzed by\ncomparison of nucleotide sequences using the online Basic Local Alignment Search Tool\n(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to confirm the detection of astroviruses.\nSubsequently, we amplified the 3\u2032-end of ORF2 and the ORF1b/ORF2 regions, which have been\nconfirmed by subgenomic RNA analysis for characterization of astroviruses. Since the direct\namplification with gene specific primers (GSPs) failed, the Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends\n(RACE) method was implemented to amplify the 3\u2032-end of the ORF1b/ORF2 region. The 3\u2032-end\nRACE amplification was performed as described previously [16] with the following modifications to the primer pair: QT 5\u2032-CCAGTGAGC\nAGAGTGACGAGGACTCGAGCTCAAGCT (T)16-3\u2032 and QO 5\u2032-CCAGTGAGCAGAGTGACG-3\u2032. The RACE\nproducts were reused as templates in a nested PCR performed to amplify desired sequences\nusing GSPs designed in this study based on the B76-2/HK sequence available in the GenBank\ndatabase (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) under the accession number HQ916317.1.The\nGSPs were designed using OLIGO 7 software (Molecular Biology Insights, Inc., Colorado\nSprings, CO, U.S.A.). The nucleotide sequences of the primer pairs used to amplify the\npartial 3\u2032-end of ORF2 were as follows: (forward, B1205F and B1350F)\n5\u2032-CAGGTCACCCCAGGCAACAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ATCATACAGGCGGGCACGAGT-3\u2032, respectively, and (reverse,\nB1205R) 5\u2032-CCCTTCACCTATGCTAATCAAATC-3\u2032 (expected products length, 1,200 and 1,426 bp,\nrespectively). The two primer pairs used to amplify the ORF1b/ORF2 region were as follows:\n(1) (forward, B-GSP2-2F) 5\u2032-AACAGC ACAGGGAGAGGTATAAGCA-3\u2032 and (reverse, B5130R)\n5\u2032-TGGCACGTGTTTCATAGGTCT-3\u2032 (expected product length, 1,850 bp); and (2) (forward, B1350F)\n5\u2032-ATCATA CAGGCGGGCACGAGT-3\u2032 and (reverse, B1205R) 5\u2032- CCCTTCACCTATGCTAATCAAATC-3\u2032 (expected\nproduct length, 1,426 bp). For PCR, the final reaction volume of 25 \u00b5l\nconsisted of 2.5 \u00b5l of 10x L.A Taq Polymerase buffer, 4.0\n\u00b5l of dNTP mixture (2.5 mM each), 0.25 \u00b5l of LA\nTaq Polymerase (Takara Bio, Inc.), 0.5 \u00b5l forward (DPF)\nand reverse (DPF) primers each, 2.5 \u00b5l of cDNA template, and 14.75\n\u00b5l of ddH2O. The PCR cycling conditions consisted of 95\u00b0C for 5 min\nfollowed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 52\u00b0C for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 1 min and a final\nextension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min in an automated thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories,\nInc., Hercules, CA, U.S.A.). 3\u2032-RACE PCR and amplification of the ORF1b/ORF2 region were\nperformed under the same conditions as for the PCR analysis described above with cycling set\nat 58\u00b0C as the annealing temperature for 3\u2032RACE and 56\u00b0C as the annealing temperature for\namplification of the ORF1b/ORF2 region and an elongation step at 72\u00b0C for 1 min for each 1\nkb.\n\nThe PCR products of expected sizes were purified and then cloned into pMD18-T plasmid\nvectors (Takara Bio, Inc.), which were then used to transform competent Escherichia\ncoli Top 10 cells. The recombinant plasmids were submitted in duplicate for DNA\nsequencing to Invitrogen Biotech (Beijing, China). Editing and assembly of nucleotide\nsequences were performed using the SeqMan program included in the Lasergene 7 Genomics Suite\n(DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI, U.S.A.).\n\nAssessment of the co-infection status of BAstV with other bovine gastrointestinal\nviruses: The status of a combination of astrovirus with other gastrointestinal\nviruses was assessed by RT-PCR.\n\nPhylogenetic and genome analysis: Phylogenetic trees were constructed\nbased on the nucleotide sequences of both partial and full-length ORF2 sequences using the\nBootstrap Test Phylogeny algorithm with the neighbor-joining method included in the MEGA 4.1\nsoftware package (http://www.megasoftware.net/). Sequences were compared with those of other\nmammalian astroviruses. Pair distances of nucleotide sequences between bovine and water\nbuffalo astroviruses, as well as the ORF1b/ORF2 junction, were analyzed using DNAstar\nsoftware (Lasergene 7; MegAlign Program with the ClustalW sequence\nalignment algorithm).\n\nScreening and detection of BAstV in cattle and water buffalo: Of the 211\nrectal swabs tested, 92 (43.6%) were positive for bovine astrovirus (cattle: 46.10%, 71/154;\nwater buffalo: 36.84%, 21/57) (Table\n1). These results indicate that astroviruses are widely distributed among cattle\nand water buffalo populations in Guangxi province, China.\n\nThe status of co-infection of BAstV with other bovine gastrointestinal\nviruses: To assess the status of co-infection with BAstV and other bovine\ngastrointestinal viruses, 32 samples randomly selected from our study stock were subjected\nto RT-PCR analysis. Six viruses: bovine astrovirus (BAstV), bovine enterovirus (BEV), bovine\nviral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine rotavirus (BRV) and bovine\ntorovirus (BToV) were analyzed in accordance with the results of previous studies [7, 8, 11, 20, 27]. The primer sequences used for detection of\ngastrointestinal viruses other than astrovirus are shown in Table 2. As shown in Table 3\n, our results clearly demonstrated BAstV co-infections with one or more\ngastrointestinal viruses in 87.5% (28/32) of cases. Interestingly, 4 (12.5%) of 32 samples\nwere only positive for BAstV and negative for the all other gastrointestinal viruses tested\nin this study. Thus, the co-infection status was as follows: BEV, 53.1% (17/32); BAstV,\n46.9% (15/32); BVDV, 18.7% (6/32); BCoV, 15.6% (5/32); BRV, 6.25% (2/32); and BToV, 0%\n(0/32).\n\nGene cloning and sequencing: We attempted to amplify the genomes of the 92\nBAstV-positive samples. However, sequencing proved difficult due to the limited volume of\nthe clinical samples and to the fact that virus cultivation was unsuccessful. We only\nsuccessfully amplified and cloned 18 partial nucleotide sequences of approximately\n1,200\u20131,426 bp in length in most 3\u2032-ends of ORF2 (of the18 sequences, 12 were derived from\ncattle and six from water buffalo). Besides, seven fragments of approximately 3,000 bp in\nlength (five derived from cattle and two from water buffalo) partially covering ORF1b and\nthe full length of ORF2 were successfully amplified. In all, 25 sequences were obtained and\nsubmitted to the NCBI GenBank under the accession numbers KJ476832\u2013KJ476856.\n\nPhylogenetic and genomic analysis: To identify strains of astroviruses\ncirculating among cattle and water buffalo populations in Guangxi province, phylogenetic\ntree analysis was performed based on both partial and full-length ORF2 sequences (1).\nPhylogenetic analysis of partial ORF2 sequences showed that three isolates (BAstGX S7-7,\nBAstGX S12-7 and BAstGX S17-7) from Dairy Farm A clustered together with one isolate (BAstGX\nJ25) from Dairy Farm B forming a subgroup, which had a high similarity with BAstV-B76-2/HK\nand BAstV-B18/ HK isolated from cattle in Hong Kong. Five of six isolates from water buffalo\n(BufAstGX M52, BufAstGX M53, BufAstGX M54, BufAstGX M541 and BufAstGX M552) clustered\ntogether appeared to form a new independent subgroup. However, one water buffalo isolate\n(BufAstGX 141) formed a new subgroup and appeared to be very closely related to the\nCcAstV-1/DNK/2010 isolate from a roe deer in Europe [17], suggesting that the Guangxi isolates from water buffalo could be classified\ninto two subgroups. Seven of eight isolates (BAstGX J7, BAstGX J8, BAstGX J22, BAstGX J23,\nBAstGX J27, BAstGX J251 and BAstGX 252) from Dairy Farm B formed a new subgroup, while one\nisolate (BAstGX G1) from Dairy Farm C formed a new subgroup on its own from other cattle\nisolates. Regardless of origin, the isolates from cattle were divided into three subgroups,\nwhile those from water buffalo were divided into two subgroups. However, five subgroups of\nthe Guangxi cattle and water buffalo astrovirus isolates belonged to one genogroup\npreviously composed of bovine and roe deer astroviruses (BAstv-B76-2/HK, BAstV-B18/HK,\nCcAstV-1/DNK/2010 and CcAstV-2/DNK/2010) in the genus Mamastrovirus,\ngenotype MAstV33 (Fig. 1a). To confirm this classification, we next constructed another phylogenetic tree based\non the seven predicted full-length ORF2 sequences deduced from amino acid sequences (five\nfrom cattle and two from water buffalo) obtained in this study together with other\nfull-length ORF2 sequences of other mammalian astroviruses retrieved from the GenBank\ndatabase. The phylogenetic relationships within the complete ORF2 sequences of different\nmammalian astroviruses were addressed in reference to the taxonomic proposals for astrovirus\nclassification criteria as described by the Astroviridae Study Group in\n2010, and each genotype was represented at least by one prototype strain. The obtained\nresults confirmed the classification under the genus Mamastrovirus,\ngenotype MAstV33, which, thus far, includes only cattle and roe deer\nastroviruses (Fig. 1b). Both the partial and full\nlength ORF2 sequences of water buffalo isolates constituted new subgroups in the clade of\nthe genotype MAstV33. The above results classified water buffalo as new\nhost species of the genus Mamastrovirus, genotype MAstV33\n(Fig. 1a and 1b).\n\nAnalysis of the ORF1b/ORF2 junction identified a highly conserved 17-nt sequence motif\n(5\u2032-cgctccttgcctaaaat- 3\u2032) upstream of ORF2 within the ORF1b/ORF2 region (Fig. 2a). The ORF1b/ORF2 overlapping region contained 56 nt that overlapped between the ORF2\nstart codon and the ORF1b stop codon, with the exception of BAstV NeuroS1 (a divergent\nbovine astrovirus). The most 3\u2032-end of ORF2 of the bovine-related astroviruses was highly\nconserved by 42 nt (Fig. 2b), while this region\nhas been reported as conserved by only 19 nt in human astroviruses [12].\n\nHere, we detected a high prevalence of bovine astrovirus by RT-PCR from rectal swabs\ncollected from young calves of cattle and water buffalo with diarrhea. However, more studies\nare needed to determine whether the persistent diarrhea observed in these calves was mainly\nassociated with the high prevalence of astroviruses, as previous studies reported that\nbovine astroviruses were not directly associated with severe diarrhea in calves under\nnatural conditions [4, 24]. However, other reports [14, 26] indicated that bovine astrovirus may evolve to severe\ndiarrhea in co-infections with other gastrointestinal viruses, as in the case of BAstV\nco-infection with BRV or BToV (Breda virus) [26].\nNonetheless, the epidemiology of bovine astrovirus remains unclear, especially considering\nthe limited number of studies of cattle and water buffalo. While excretion of BAstV may\noccur in up to 60\u2013100% of calves on farms [4], only 5\n(2.4%) of 209 rectal swabs collected from asymptomatic adult cattle were positive for BAstV\n[21]. In the present study, sampling at different\ntime points demonstrated a high prevalence of up to 56.52% among calves with diarrhea.\nMoreover, in our complementary study, astrovirus was detected alongside other\ngastrointestinal viruses, including BEV, BCoV, BRV and BVDV, in 87.5% of cases.\nSurprisingly, 12.5% of these cases were positive for bovine astrovirus, but yet negative for\nother tested gastrointestinal viruses. In contrast, titers of BRV and BToV, which have been\npreviously reported as principal gastrointestinal co-infecting viruses with bovine\nastrovirus, were minimal or undetectable in this study. From these results, it is clear that\nastrovirus may be directly associated with diarrhea or possibly linked to other factors,\nsuch as poor hygienic conditions or associated with other non-viral pathogens, such as\nbacteria or parasites, which are known causative agents of diarrhea in calves. Similar\nresults were reported in Korea, where co-infection of bovine astrovirus with\ngastrointestinal viruses, other than BRV and BToV, was associated with clinical symptoms of\ndiarrhea in 20- and 14-day-old calves [14].\n\nOur phylogenetic analysis showed that all isolates in this study were closely related to\nBAstV-B76-2/HK, BAstV-B18/HK, CcAstV-1/DNK/2010 and CcAstV-2/DNK/2010, but highly divergent\nfrom a BAstV NeuroS1 isolate previously associated with neurologic disease in cattle in the\nU.S.A. [10]. Nonetheless, our results support that\nproposal [21] that BAstV and CcAstV may be different\nstrains of the same virus, and water buffalo may be a new host of the BAstV variant of this\nvirus. Moreover, most sequences derived from one farm belonged to one subgroup, although\nsequence analysis clearly demonstrated origins from different strains. In addition, no\nsignificant genetic differences were observed between the bovine and water buffalo\nastrovirus strains investigated in this study (Table\n4). These results further support previous evidence that one farm could serve as\na reservoir of different bovine astrovirus strains, suggesting possible outbreaks of novel\nastroviruses due to mutation or recombination events. Notably, considering the history of\nastroviruses, recombination events have been described in cattle, swine, humans and poultry\n[19, 21,\n22], and co-infection of two different astroviruses\nin one head of cattle has been previously reported as well [21]. Consequently, it is important to screen for and control astrovirus infection\nin order to prevent eventual outbreaks of highly pathogenic astroviruses resulting in\nmutation or recombination events on farms. Furthermore, the astrovirus isolates from cattle\nand water buffalo isolated in this study displayed relatively close relationships,\nindicating that these animals were infected with diverse astroviruses, which probably\nevolved from the same viral ancestor. Consequently, given these close relationships,\nevidence exists of possible cross-infection between the two hosts; therefore, control\nmeasures against bovine astrovirus should also be taken into consideration when screening of\nviruses in water buffalo populations.\n\nAppreciation of the genetic diversity and evolution of astroviruses among wild and domestic\nanimal populations is important to fully understand this challenging gastrointestinal virus\n[21]. However, the organization of the BAstV genome\nhas not yet been fully described. In this study, a sequence motif upstream of ORF2 was\npredicted to be the signal of the putative promoter for subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) synthesis in\nbovine astrovirus as well as that for the ORF1b/ORF2 overlap sequence and the most 3\u2032-end of\nORF2. It has been suggested that in astroviruses [13,\n23], a conserved sequence acts as a putative\npromoter for sgRNA synthesis upstream of ORF2. In human astroviruses, the ORF1b/ORF2 overlap\nis 8 nt in length, while in duck astroviruses, the ORF1b/ORF2 junctions are not overlapped\n[6, 13, 23]. In contrast, the overlap in the ORF1b/ ORF2 junction\nof bovine astroviruses may be longer (56 nt) than that of the other known astroviruses.\nMoreover, compared with a previous report [12], the\n3\u2032-end of ORF2 of bovine astroviruses was highly conserved, although our results suggested\nfurther studies and analysis of more sequences from several novel bovine astroviruses to\nfully characterize ORF2 of bovine astrovirus.\n\nIn summary, this study is of interest at both the epidemiological and genetic levels. These\nresults will certainly contribute to the understanding of the evolution and pathology of\nbovine astrovirus in cattle and water buffalo, as not only did we provide useful reference\nmaterial for further studies, but also isolated bovine astrovirus in water buffalo for the\nfirst time. The present study is thus far among the largest epidemiological investigations\nof bovine astrovirus conducted at the farm level in the dairy industry in China."}
