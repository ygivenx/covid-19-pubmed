{"title": "Testing the hypothesis of a recombinant origin of the SARS-associated coronavirus", "body": "SARS, a new disease characterized by high fever, malaise, rigor, headache and non-productive cough, has spread to over 30 countries with around 8% of mortality rate on average. Sequence analysis of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [17, 25] showed that it is a novel coronavirus [12] . Anand et al. [1] reported a three-dimensional model of SARS-CoV main proteinase and suggested that \n\nThere are a number of methods and software packages that have been developed for detection of recombination events in DNA sequences. The performance of these methods has been extensively evaluated and compared on simulated and real data [23, 24] . In the present study we applied these methods to RNA viruses. SARS-CoV and other 6 coronavirus genomes (SARS-CoV, IBV, BCoV, HCoV, MHV, PEDV, TGEV) were first aligned using CLUSTALW [33] . Sites with gaps were removed and a 25077-nt alignment was generated. Subsequently, seven methods were employed to detect the occurrence of recombination (see corresponding reference in parenthesis for details of each method): BOOTSCAN [26] , GENECONV [28] , DSS (Difference of Sums of Squares) [20] , HMM (Hidden Markov Model) [8] , MAXCHI (Maximum Chi-Square method) [19] , PDM (Probabilistic Divergence Measures) [9] , RDP (Recombination Detection Program) [18] . BOOTSCAN, MAXCHI and RDP are implemented in RDP software package, http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/microbiology/microdescription.htm. GENECONV is implemented in the program, http://www.math.wustl.edu/\u223csawyer/geneconv/. DSS, HMM and PDM are implemented in TOPALi software package, http://www.bioss.sari.ac.uk/software.html.\n\nBasically default parameter settings were used in all the programs, except the following values: gscale = 1 (GENECONV), internal and external references (RDP), window size = 300 and step = 10 (DSS, HMM and PDM).\n\nAfter potential recombination events were identified by at least 3 methods above, separate neighbor joining trees were constructed for each putative recombination region to better evaluate the evidence for conflicting evolutionary histories of different sequence regions. All trees were produced with TOPALi mentioned above. Table 2 summarizes the results of BOOTSCAN analysis with 100% bootstrap support and significant P-value (<0.05 for uncorrected and MC corrected Pvalue). Two regions (13151-13299 and 16051-16449, position in alignment) are identified as putative recombination regions and all 6 coronaviruses are potential parents with SARS-CoV as potential daughter.\n\nGENECONV detected 9 putative recombination events occurred in a wide range of positions 5941-24997 (in alignment) at a significant level p < 0.05 for two P-values: simulated P-value (based on 10,000 permutations) and BLASTlike BC KA P-value (Table 3 ). All 6 coronaviruses are potential parents with SARS-CoV as potential daughter.\n\nMAXCHI identified 15 putative recombination events (Table 4 , possible misidentification events are not retained). Most of the breakpoints are significant at about 0.001 level; the position located in alignment spans from 3534 to 22840, but some beginning or ending breakpoints are not determined. Similarly, 6 coronaviruses are potential parents with SARS-CoV as potential daughter.\n\nRDP revealed that 6 putative recombination events occur in the domain of alignment 5910-13334 (Table 5) , with the uncorrected and MC corrected pvalue at less than 0.002 and 0.05 respectively. In this case, 4 coronaviruses (IBV, BCoV, MHV and PEDV) are potential parents with SARS-CoV as potential daughter. Figure 1 shows the DSS profiles of putative breakpoints between SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses (Dotted line indicates the 95 percentile under the null hypothesis of no recombination): SARS-CoV, IBV, BCoV and MHV (Fig. 1a) , SARS-CoV, MHV, PEDV and TGEV (Fig. 1b) , SARS-CoV, IBV, HCoV and TGEV (Fig. 1c ). There are about 6 different breakpoints (significant peaks): 13614 and 16085 (Fig. 1a) , 11008 and 12850 (Fig. 1b) , 12805, 13614 and 16444 (Fig. 1c) .\n\nHMM plots for SARS-CoV, IBV, BCoV and HCoV (Fig. 2 ) revealed that the putative breakpoints are at about position 5500 and 19000. There is a clear transition from state 1 (SARS-CoV grouped with IBV) (Fig. 2a) into state 3 (SARS-CoV grouped with HCoV) (Fig. 2c) . The region between 5500 and 19000 is noisy, and at this moment no information can be provided by HMM. Figure 3 shows the results of PDM analysis performed on SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses (dotted line indicates the 95% critical region for the null (Fig. 3c, d) , 1393, 6111, 16624, 19859 and 20802 (Fig. 3e, f) . Posada [23] suggested that one should not rely too much on a single method for recombination detection. Here we consider the regions identified by at least 3 methods as putative recombination regions. The results are summarized in Table 6 . Seven putative recombination regions span a range of positions in SARS-CoV \n\nPhylogenetic trees constructed by using putative recombination regions and nonrecombination regions identified by above techniques are shown in Figure 4 . The left panels stand for non-recombination regions and the right panels for recombination regions. We compared each row of figures and found that the phylogenetic tree in the left panel (non-recombination region) had very different topology when compared to the phylogenetic tree in the right panel (recombination region), which indicates that recombination has occurred. For example, in Fig. 4a , 7 coronaviruses are divided into 4 groups: group 1 for TGEV, HCoV and PEDV, group 2 for BCoV and MHV, group 3 for IBV, and group 4 for SARS-CoV, consistent with Marra et al. [17] ; while in Fig. 4b, 7 coronaviruses are divided and SARS-CoV, suggests that SARS-CoV is most closely related to BCoV and MHV, which is consistent with a recent report [29] . At the same time, SARS-CoV is also most closely related to TGEV (Fig. 4d) and IBV (Fig. 4f) . Thus, phylogenetic analysis substantiates the presence of recombination events in the history that led to the SARS-CoV genome.\n\nIn this study, seven recombination detection methods and phylogenetic analyses were performed on SARS-CoV and the six coronaviruses identified by BLAST (IBV, BCoV, HCoV, MHV, PEDV and TGEV). These techniques successfully identified recombination events in bacteria and viruses [2, 3, 6, 21, 26, 39] . Our analysis concurred to suggest the occurrence of recombination events between ancestors of SARS-CoV and these 6 coronaviruses. Indeed, pairwise alignment showed that many segments of high homology with IBV, BCoV, HCoV, MHV, PEDV and TGEV do exist in SARS-CoV genome, Table 7 exhibits the segments with length >20 nt and identiy >80%, and Fig. 5 shows the mosaic structure of the region 14930-15908 in SARS-CoV genome based on the segments with length >50 and identity >80%. Of course, the other coronaviruses used in the analysis are also mosaic structures, for more sequence similarities exist among them than with SARS-CoV. It is noted that all the sequence comparisons in this study are based on nucleotide sequences. While the protein sequences in SARS-CoV are largely different from those in the known three groups of coronavirus [17] , such as, for S protein, the identity is: 25.9% for SARS-CoV and BCoV, 21.7% for SARS-CoV and HCoV, 21.5% for SARS-CoV and IBV, 25.6% for SARS-CoV and MHV, 20.6% for SARS-CoV and PEDV, 19.4% for SARS-CoV and TGEV. Although SARS-CoV is close to BCoV, MHV, TGEV and IBV, the corresponding protein, replicase 1a, is still different: with identity 27.4% for SARS-CoV and BCoV, 24.8% for SARS-CoV and IBV, 32.2% for SARS-CoV and MHV, 25.0% for SARS-CoV and TGEV.\n\nNaturally, we should take into account the role of convergent evolution, which would bear its mark on the viral genome. The recombination events that we witnessed in SARS-CoV are present in six different viruses, suggesting sequential horizontal transfers and progressive adaptation to new hosts cells or animals. Indeed because viruses need both receptors to permeate host cells and resist the immune response of the host, their outer layer proteins are submitted to an extremely strong selection pressure that may restrict considerably the possible variations of the corresponding proteins (and accordingly of the corresponding genome pieces of sequences). It is nevertheless remarkable that, despite the inclusion of all possible types of viruses in our sample set (as well as shuffled genomes from the viruses we have identified as relevant) we find a more or less single category of viruses as similar to SARS-CoV. This suggests that even if the contribution of convergent evolution is important, this happened on a more or less common phylogenetic background, suggesting several steps of recombination followed by fine adaptation. In this context, we would like to suggest that ancestors of PEDV, MHV or both are the most plausible origin of SARS-CoV. Guan et al. [7] Based on phylogenetic techniques and BOOTSCAN recombination analysis Stavrinides and Guttman [32] indicated that the replicase of SARS-CoV was a mammalian-like origin, the M and N proteins have an avian-like origin, and the S protein has a mammalian-avian mosaic origin. While in the present study we used phylogenetic analysis and 7 recombination detection methods, including the powerful methods of MAXCHI and GENECONV among 14 methods studied (SIMPLOT (BOOTSCAN), GENECONV, HOMOPLASY TEST, PIST,  MAXCHI, CHIMAERA, PHYPRO, PLATO, RDP, RECPARS, RETICULATE,  RUNS TEST, SNEATH TEST, TRIPLE) [23, 24] , to conduct whole genomewide recombination analysis. We identified seven putative recombination regions, which encompass, in terms of proteins involved, replicase 1A, replicase 1B and the spike glycoprotein. Stavrinides and Guttman [32] primarily inferred the occurrence of recombination qualitatively, but did not identify the precise recombination region in the protein involved (the S protein is an exception, they identified a recombination region in S protein, located between nucleotides 2472 and 2694 of the S protein, i.e. between nucleotides 23963 and 24185 of the SARS-CoV genome, basically covered by the last recombination region for S protein (Table 6) ). Most importantly, each of our recombination regions is identified by at least 3 methods, because one should not rely too much on a single method, as suggested in [23] . In general, we believe two studies lead to the overall conclusion: the evolution of SARS-CoV has involved recombination.\n\nThe recombination event in the replicase is related to the fact that the RNA polymerase of coronaviruses utilize a discontinuous transcription mechanism to synthesize mRNAs. The viral polymerase must jump between different RNA templates regularly during positive-or negative-strand RNA synthesis and depending on the rejoining sites, the resultant RNA recombination will be either homologous or nonhomologous. This is the copy-choice model of recombination in RNA viruses [13, 27, 31, 34] . The recombination event in S protein is certainly important since this allows the virus to alter surface antigenicity and escape immunesurveillance in the animals, thus adapting to a human host.\n\nThe existence of SARS-CoV-like viruses (99.8% homology to human SARS-CoV) in several wild animals in a live animal market in Guangdong [7] indicated that interspecies transmission among the human and animal SARS-CoV-like viruses had occurred. The mutation analysis of sequence variations among these isolates will help identify the genetic signature of SARS virus strains when a sufficient amount of sequence data is available.\n\nThe very fact that several species of animals are affected does not allow one to trace directly the origin of the virus as endemic in one of these species, but, rather, might be indicative that animals and men might have been contaminated by a virus from a common origin, presumably located in animal food present in local markets in the Guangdong province. Investigating a wide variety of animal coronaviruses, especially in relation to rodents, birds, snakes and farm animals, would be interesting with regard to the origin of the SARS-CoV that caused disease in humans.\n\nFinally, a challenging question arises. What is the molecular basis of recombination in SARS-CoV? Many requirements are needed for recombination to occur: (1) Two coronaviruses can infect a host simultaneously and continue to replicate without interference with each other; (2) Sufficient nucleotide identity between these genomes is essential for genome-switching to occur during RNA replication; (3) The proteins arising from recombination must be functional; (4) The recombinant virus must have some selective advantage for its survival. That is, the recombination that creates a successful \"new\" coronavirus is probably a rare event. So, we must stress that the potential recombination events in SARS-CoV, identified in the present study, are most likely \"old\" events, which may represent the events that occurred thousands of years ago. Although the recent findings indicated that SARS-CoV did exist in a number of wild animals [7] , we have not yet determined where these SARS-CoV-like virus strains come from."}
