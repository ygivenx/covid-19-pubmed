{"title": "Rapid detection of three rabbit pathogens by use of the Luminex x-TAG assay", "body": "Domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), especially New Zealand white rabbit, has attracted more and more attention in biomedical, immunological and pharmaceutical research, because of its intermediate size and phylogenetic proximity to primates [1]. It played an important role in production of antibodies, eye research as well as cardiovascular disease [2, 3]. Rabbit is one of the most commonly used experimental animals and must be free of some important pathogens.\n\nThe first outbreak of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) caused by the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) occurred in 1984 in Jiangsu Province, China and spread all around the world rapidly [4]. It\u2019s an acute and mostly fatal contagion in both domestic and wild rabbits, characterized by acute necrotizing hepatitis and hemorrhage [5]. Actually there are three different clinical features, the pre-acute, acute and sub-acute forms [6]. Among which the sub-acute form causes no clinical symptoms and rabbits will recover within 2~ 3 days [7]. Rabbit rotavirus (RRV) infection was the major cause of mild to severe diarrhea in rabbits [8]. The rotavirus isolated from infected rabbits belongs to Group A rotaviruses (RVAs), which also infect humans and other animals. It\u2019s a highly contagious mild virus and disseminated by fecal-oral route [9\u201311]. Although the infection rate of RRV is high, most infections are subclinical. However, co-infection with other bacteria or viruses may cause severe enteritis and the excretion by the infected rabbits will become the contaminate source and cause new infection. Sendai virus (SV), also known as a murine parainfluenza virus type 1, belongs to Respirovirus, Paramyxoviridae family. It causes transmitted respiratory tract infections in a variety of animals [12]. Unlike rodents, rabbits are not sensitive to SV, and the infection will only cause fever but not respiratory tract contagious in rabbits.\n\nDespite the asymptomatic infection and low mortality of rotavirus and Sendai virus infection, the existence of these two viruses will affect the quality of experimental animals and severely interfere with the results of animal experiments on them [13]. To improve the quality of rabbits and ensure the accuracy of animal experiments, RHDV, SV and RRV are the required inspection items ruled by the national quality standard of China.\n\nThe traditional methods for pathogen identification include etiology diagnosis, serological diagnosis as well as molecular diagnosis [14, 15]. According to the laboratory animal microbiological quality control standards of China, the recommended test methods for these viruses mainly are the etiology and serological diagnosis. Both of them are time-consuming and laborious, compared with molecular diagnostic techniques. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with high sensitivity and specificity is widely used in pathogeny identification [16, 17]. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) assays had been developed for monitoring of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, Sendai virus as well as rabbit rotavirus [18\u201320]. However, the restricted throughput limited the application of PCR, even the multiplex real-time quantitative PCR could not detect more than five pathogens in one reaction. The development of rapid and sensitive multiplex diagnostic method was extremely important for rabbit health monitoring. Compared with conventional PCR methods, the Luminex technology was a high-throughput, rapid, sensitive and labor-saving multiplex assay [21]. Conjugation of microbeads with different fluorescent dyes could differentiate as much as 100 targets in a single reaction. This technology offered a variety of applications in pathologic diagnosis [22\u201324].\n\nIn this study, we developed a multiplex PCR-based MagPlex-TAG assay for simultaneous detection of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, rabbit rotavirus and Sendai virus.\n\nThe combined rabbit viral hemorrhagic disease and Pasteurrella multocida vaccine and rabies vaccine were purchased from the animal epidemic prevention and control center in Tianhe district (Guangzhou, China). The nucleic acid of classical RHDV strain was kindly offered by Shanghai Veterinary Research Institute. The Sendai virus, Salmonella typhimurium, Helicobacter bilis (H.b), Helicobacter rodent (H.r), Escherichia coli (E.coli) and the nucleic acid of rabbit rotavirus, rabbit adenovirus as well as rabbit coronavirus were preserved by our laboratory.\n\nAll the clinical samples, including 24 fecal samples, 10 tissue samples and 6 nose swabs, were provided by a rabbit farm from Qingdao (Shandong Province, China) and preserved at \u2212 80 \u00b0C. The nucleic acid extraction was performed by the automatic nucleic acid extraction instrument (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China) according to the manufacture\u2019s instruction. All the nucleic acid were stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C before used.\n\nSpecific primers of the three viruses were designed based on the conserved VP60 gene, N gene and VP4 gene of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, Sendai virus and rabbit rotavirus respectively (Table 1). Each forward primer was modified with a unique oligonucleotide \u201cTAG\u201d sequence at the 5\u2032 terminus, which was used to couple with the magnetic fluorescent microsphere. All the reverse primers were biotinylated at the 5\u2032 terminus for fluorescent detection with streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin (SAPE). The forward primers and oligonucleotides were best match by the Tag-It Oligo Design Software v.3.00 (7B052). All the primers were synthesized and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Sangong, Guangzhou, China).\n\nThree sets of primers were confirmed by the simplex PCR reactions before the multiplex PCR (mPCR) amplification. The mPCR was performed using the one-step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA; Cat.no.210212) with a total volume of 50 \u03bcl containing 100 ng of template DNA/RNA. The mPCR amplification conditions were as follows: 50 \u00b0C, 30 min for reverse transcription, followed by activation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min. Then, DNA amplification was carried out by 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, followed by final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. All the samples were tested in triplicate and the assays were run with negative control.\n\nThe PCR products were conjugated with MagPlex-TAG microspheres, which were pre-coupled with \u201canti-TAG\u201d sequence. The working mixture containing 2500 of each target microspheres was diluted with 1\u00d7 Tm Hybridization Buffer (0.2 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris, 0.08% Triton X-100, Ph 8.0, filter sterilized). For each reaction, 5 \u03bcl of amplified product or distilled water, 75 \u03bcl of SAPE solution and 20 \u03bcl of the working MagPlex-TAG microsphere mixture were well mixed together before incubated in a thermocycler for 30 min at 45 \u00b0C. The Luminex 200 analyzer was applied to analyze the products after the hybridization reaction.\n\nThe data analyzed by the Luminex xPONENT software were reported as median fluorescence intensity (MFI). For background calculation, negative controls contained all the hybridization components except target DNA, were set in each experiment. The cutoff value of the three target pathogens were obtained from all the negative PCR controls. Specifically, the cutoff value was defined, for each bead set as the mean of the MFI values of negative controls + 3 SD (Standard deviation).\n\nTo evaluate the specificity of the x-TAG assay, the Pasteurella (Pas.), Salmonella typhimurium (S.ty), Helicobacter bilis (H.b), Helicobacter rodent (H.r), Escherichia coli (E.coli), rabbit coronavirus (RCoV), rabbit adenovirus (RAV) and rabies virus (RV) nucleic acids were tested with previously indicated primers. Positive and negative controls were simultaneously tested. All the products were further analyzed on the Luminex 200 analyzer after hybridization.\n\nThe PCR products of RHDV (161 bp), RRV (251 bp) and SV (148 bp) were cloned into the pGEM T easy vector (Promega, Madison, USA). The plasmids were in vitro transcribed (IVT) by RiboMax\u2122 Large Scale RNA production system T7 (Promega, Madison,USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 40 units RNase-free DNase\u2122 (Promega, Madison, USA) enzyme was used to remove plasmid DNA. Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used for RNA isolation according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The RNA concentrations were estimated by spectrophotometry. Serial ten-fold dilutions of RNA standard were performed as templates to determine the sensitivity of the x-TAG assay, and the results were confirmed in triplicate.\n\nA total number of 40 clinical samples including nose swabs, faeces and tissues were tested by both Luminex x-TAG assay and conventional PCR assay.\n\nThe specificity of the three primer pairs was confirmed using the unrelated nucleic acid as PCR templates. There was no cross-amplification during the test and the fluorescence signals were observed only in the corresponding positive controls (Fig.1).\n\nThe sensitivity of the Luminex x-TAG assay was examined by testing serial ten-fold dilutions of RNA standard, and distilled water was used as negative control. The results showed that the detection limits of the three viruses were 102copies/\u03bcl (Fig. 2). The MFI value and the corresponding concentration were detailed in Table 2.\n\nTo further assess the Luminex x-TAG assay, three parallel reactions were carried out with standard RNA at concentrations of 1 \u00d7 105 and 1 \u00d7 108 copies/\u03bcl. The coefficient of variation of the intra-assay and inter-assay were displayed in Table 3.\n\nThe Luminex x-TAG assay was applied for clinical sample detection, and confirmed by both the conventional PCR and sequencing analysis. The assay detected genetic material of RHDV (n = 3), SV (n = 15) and RRV (n = 10) in the clinical samples. Among which, the co-infection of RHDV +SV (n = 2), RHDV+RRV (n = 3), SV + RRV (n = 7) was observed. Only 2 samples were detected with triple infection (Table 4). All the samples were detected by conventional PCR method and the results were in accord with the Luminex x-TAG assay.\n\nAlthough conventional PCR had been used for RHDV, SV and RRV identification, there is no multiplex-assay for simultaneous discrimination of these viruses. Multiplex-PCR assays allow for detection of different targets in one reaction. The interpretation of the mPCR results is based on the sizes of amplicons. It limits the multiplicity in the single reaction and fails to meet the requirements of hig- throughput detection.The Luminex x-TAG assay based on PCR products coupled with fluorescent encoding microsphere is a high-throughput, accuracy technique, which is widely used in pathogenic diagnosis [25]. However, there is a lack of studies that apply and investigate x-TAG assay in the veterinary field.\n\nIn this study, we described the development and validation of the Luminex x-TAG assay for monitoring of RHDV, SV, and RRV. The new method showed good specificity, no cross-reaction with other tested pathogens. The detect limit of the three viruses was 102 copies/\u03bcl. 40 specimens were tested using both Luminex x-TAG assay and conventional RT-PCR, and the results of different methods are consistent with each other. These findings suggest that the developed x-TAG assay based on multiplex PCR for screening three pathogens is applicable.\n\nTo further optimize the assay, we performed it on different hybridization conditions.The results indicated that 45 \u00b0C was the optimal hybridization temperature and the addition of 1% BSA in the 1\u00d7 Tm Hybridization Buffer could remarkably reduce the background MFI values.\n\nA large scale of negative samples mainly SPF samples should be tested to determine the cut-off value of each viruses. To guarantee the accuracy of the test and avoid false positive/negative results, MFI values of specimen that is close to the threshold should be double-checked by monoplex PCR or sequencing.\n\nThe multiplex assay is an efficient alternative to monoplex RT-PCR and greatly reduces the number of reactions required. In this report, the establishment of this effective system will allow precise detection and identification of RHDV,SV and RRV. This approach might be the promising rabbit quality control methods. Besides, more target pathogens could be integrated into the established assay for better utilization."}
