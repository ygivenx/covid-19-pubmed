{"title": "Physica A The global dynamics for a stochastic SIS epidemic model with isolation", "body": "In this paper, we investigate the dynamical behavior for a stochastic SIS epidemic model with isolation which is as an important strategy for the elimination of infectious diseases. It is assumed that the stochastic effects manifest themselves mainly as fluctuation in the transmission coefficient, the death rate and the proportional coefficient of the isolation of infective. It is shown that the extinction and persistence in the mean of the model are determined by a threshold value R S 0 . That is, if R S 0 < 1, then disease dies out with probability one, and if R S 0 > 1, then the disease is stochastic persistent in the means with probability one. Furthermore, the existence of a unique stationary distribution is discussed, and the sufficient conditions are established by using the Lyapunov function method. Finally, some numerical examples are carried out to confirm the analytical results.\n\nAs is well-known, in the theory of epidemiology the quarantine/isolation is an important strategy for the control and elimination of infectious diseases. Such as, in order to control SARS, the Chinese government is the first to use isolation. The various types of classical epidemic models with quarantine/isolation have been investigated in many articles. See, for example [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and the references cited therein.\n\nParticularly, in [1] , Herbert et al. studied the following SIS epidemic model with isolation \u23a7 \u23a8 \u23a9 S \u2032 (t) = A \u2212 \u03b2IS \u2212 \u00b5S + \u03b3 I + \u03be Q , I \u2032 (t) = \u03b2IS \u2212 (\u00b5 + \u03b3 + \u03b4 + \u03b1)I, Q \u2032 (t) = \u03b4I \u2212 (\u00b5 + \u03be + \u03b1)Q . (1.1) where S(t) denotes the number of individuals who are susceptible to an infection, I(t) denotes the number of individuals who are infectious but not isolated, Q (t) is the number of individuals who are isolated. A is the recruitment rate of S(t), \u03b2 is the transmission rate coefficient between compartment S(t) and I(t), \u00b5 is natural death rate of S(t), I(t) and Q (t), \u03b1 is the disease-related death rate of I(t), \u03b4 is the proportional coefficient of isolated for the infection, \u03b3 and \u03be are the rates where individuals recover and return to S(t) from I(t) and Q (t), respectively. All parameters are usually assumed to be nonnegative. In addition, we see that the quarantine/isolation strategies also are introduced and investigated in many practical epidemic model, such as the emerging infectious disease, two-strain avian influenza, childhood diseases, the Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola epidemics, Dengue epidemic, H1N1 flu epidemic, Hepatitis B and C, Tuberculosis, etc. See, for example [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] and the references cited therein.\n\nAs a matter of fact, epidemic systems are inevitably subjected to environmental white noise. Therefore, the studies for the stochastic epidemic models have more practical significance. In recent years, the stochastic epidemic models with the quarantine and isolation have been investigated in articles [29] [30] [31] [32] . Particularly, in [29] Zhang et al. investigated the dynamics of the deterministic and stochastic SIQS epidemic model with an isolation and nonlinear incidence. The sufficient conditions on the extinction almost surely of the disease and the existence of stationary distribution of the model are established. Zhang et al. in [30] discussed the threshold of a stochastic SIQS epidemic model. The criteria on the extinction and permanence in the mean of global positive solutions with probability one are established. Besides, we also see that the stochastic persistence and the existence of stationary distribution for the various stochastic epidemic models and population models have been widely investigated. Some important recent works can been found in [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] and the references cited therein.\n\nMotivated by the works [1, 2, 4, 5, [29] [30] [31] [32] , in this paper as an extension of model (1.1) we firstly assume that the diseaserelated death rates of isolation and no-isolation are different, respectively, denote by \u03b1 2 and \u03b1 3 . Then, we further define \u00b5 1 = \u00b5, \u00b5 2 = \u00b5+\u03b1 2 and \u00b5 3 = \u00b5+\u03b1 3 for the convenience. It is clear that \u00b5 1 \u2264 min{\u00b5 2 , \u00b5 3 }. Next, we introduce randomness into model (1.1), by replacing the parameters \u03b2, \u00b5 i (i = 1, 2, 3) and 2, 3, 4, 5) are independent standard Brownian motion defined on some probability space ( , F , P) and parameter \u03c3 i > 0 represents the intensity of W i (t). Thus, we establish the following stochastic SIS epidemic model with multi-parameters white noises perturbations and the isolation of infection.\n\n(1.2)\n\nOur purpose in this paper is to study the stochastic extinction and persistence, and the stationary distribution of model (1.2). We will establish a series of sufficient conditions to assure the extinction and persistence in the mean of the model with probability one, and the existence of unique stationary distribution for model (1.2) by using the theory of stochastic processes, the Ito's formula and the Liapunov function method. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the preliminaries and some useful lemmas. In Section 3, the criteria on the extinction and persistence in the mean with probability one for model (1.2) are stated and proved. In Section 4, the criteria on the existence of a unique stationary distribution for model (1.2) are stated and proved. In Section 5, the numerical examples are carried out to illustrate the main theoretical results.\n\nWe denote R 3\n\nAs the preliminaries, we give the following lemmas. (1) If R 0 < 1, then model (1.1) has only a disease-free equilibrium E 0 ( A \u00b5 , 0, 0), which is globally asymptotically stable. (2) If R 0 > 1, then model (1.1) also has an endemic equilibrium E * (S * , I * , Q * ), which is globally asymptotically stable,\n\nThe proof of Lemma 2.1 can be found in [1] . We hence omit it here. That is, solution (S(t), I(t), Q (t)) is defined for all t \u2265 0 and remains in R 3 + with probability one. Lemma 2.2 can be proved by using the similar method given in [29] . Lemma 2.3. Let (S(t), I(t), Q (t)) be the solution of model (1.2) with initial value (S(0), I(0), Q (0)) \u2208 R 3 + , then lim sup t\u2192\u221e (S(t) + I(t) + Q (t)) < \u221e a.s.\n\nwhere \u03b1 2 = \u00b5 2 \u2212 \u00b5 1 \u2265 0 and \u03b1 3 = \u00b5 3 \u2212 \u00b5 1 \u2265 0. Solving this equation, we further obtain that\n\nClearly, M(t) is a continuous local martingale with M(0) = 0. Define\n\nwhere\n\n(1 \u2212 e \u2212\u00b5 1 t ) and U(t) = (S(0) + I(0) + Q (0))(1 \u2212 e \u2212\u00b5 1 t ). By (2.4) we have S(t) + I(t) + Q (t) \u2264 X (t) a.s. for all t \u2265 0. It is clear that A(t) and U(t) are continuous adapted increasing processes on t \u2265 0 with A(0) = U(0) = 0. By Theorem 3.9 in [44] , we obtain that lim t\u2192\u221e X (t) < \u221e a.s. Thus, conclusion (2.1) is true.\n\nSince the quadratic variations\n\nby the large number theorem for martingales (See [44, 45] ), we have Similarly, we also have\n\n) , by (2.5) and (2.6), we obtain lim t\u2192\u221e \u27e8M(t)\u27e9 = 0.

Using Ito's formula, by (2.3) we have dN 2 (t) = LN 2 (t)dt + 2N(t)(\u03c3 2 IdW 2 (t) + \u03c3 3 Q dW 3 (t) + \u03c3 5 SdW 5 (t)), (2.11) where\n\nIntegrating (2.11) from 0 to t, we further obtain\n\n(2.12)\n\nThen, dividing t on both sides (2.12), it follows that\n\nwhere C (t) is given in (2.9).

Thus, we finally obtain (2.7). This completes the proof. \u25a1 Lemma 2.5. Assume that functions Y \u2208 C (R + \u00d7 , R + ) and Z \u2208 C (R + \u00d7 , R + ) satisfies lim t\u2192\u221e\n\nLemma 2.5 can be found in Liu et al.

This completes the proof. \u25a1 Remark 3.1. It is unfortunate that in Theorem 3.1 \u03c3 5 = 0 is assumed. From the proof of Theorem 3.1 we see that this assumption only is used to deal with the term \u27e8S 2 (t)\u27e9 in (3.3) . Therefore, an interesting open problem is to establish a similar result like Theorem 3.1 for model (1.2) in \u03c3 5 > 0.\n\nIn Theorem 3.1 we only obtain the persistence in the mean of model (1.2). However, as a consequence of Theorem 3.1 we have the following result on the permanence in the mean for the disease in model (1.2).\n\n0 > 1, and \u03c3 1 = 0 or \u03c3 2 = 0 and \u03c3 3 = 0, then the disease I(t) is permanent in the mean with probability one.\n\nIn fact, when \u03c3 1 = 0 or \u03c3 2 = 0 and \u03c3 3 = 0, from (3.11) we have B = \u03b2( \u00b5 2 \u00b5 1 + \u03b4\u00b5 3 \u00b5 1 (\u00b5 3 +\u03be ) ), which is independent for L. Therefore, by Theorem 3.1, we obtain from (3.10) that\n\nwhich implies that the disease I(t) is permanent in the mean with probability one.\n\nRemark 3.2. From the above Corollary 3.1, we can propose an important open problem. That is, when R S 0 > 1, \u03c3 1 > 0 and \u03c3 2 > 0 or \u03c3 3 > 0, whether we can establish the permanence in the mean of the disease I for model (1.2) . An example will be given in Section 5 to show that the result can hold.\n\nProof.

Therefore, by Lemma 2.5 we finally can obtain that\n\nFurthermore, from (2.14) we can obtain\n\nand from (2.7) we further obtain\n\nThis completes the proof. \u25a1 Remark 3.3. Particularly, when \u03c3 i = 0 (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and \u00b5 2 = \u00b5 3 = \u00b5 1 +\u03b1, then the stochastic model (1.2) degenerates into the deterministic model (1.1). We also have R S 0 = R 0 = \u03b2A \u00b5 1 (\u03b4+\u03b3 +\u00b5 1 +\u03b1) . From Theorem 3.2, when R 0 > 1 we can obtain that for any solution (S(t), I(t), Q (t)) of model (1.1) with initial value (S(0), + . Suppose that one of the following two conditions holds:\n\nand lim sup \n\nBy the large number theorem for martingales, Lemmas 2.3 and 2.4, we have lim t\u2192\u221e (t) = 0 a.s. Therefore, we finally obtain lim sup\n\nln\n\nThus, we also have lim sup\n\nFrom (3.14) and (3.15), there is a constant m > 0 such that for almost all \u03c9 \u2208 there exists a T 0 = T 0 (\u03c9) > 0, when t \u2265 T 0 one has I(t, \u03c9) \u2264 e \u2212mt . Without loss of generality, we assume that I(t, \u03c9) \u2264 e \u2212mt for all t \u2265 0. It follows that from\n\nHence,\n\nwhere\n\nIt is clear that\n\nConsider H 3 (t), choose the constants \u03b7 0 > 0 and \u03b5 0 > 0 such that\n\nSince lim t\u2192\u221e W 3 (t) t = 0, without loss of generality, we assume |W 3 (t)| \u2264 \u03b5 0 t for all t \u2265 0. Let H * 3 (t) = e \u03b7t H 3 (t), then we have \u27e8H *\n\nBy the large number theorem for martingales, we have lim t\u2192\u221e H * 3 (t) t = 0. For any small enough \u03b5 > 0, we can obtain\n\nHence, lim t\u2192\u221e\n\nBy Lemma 2.3, the large number theorem of martingales, lim t\u2192\u221e I(t) = 0 a.s. and lim t\u2192\u221e Q (t) = 0 a.s., we have lim t\u2192\u221e \u27e8SI\u27e9 = 0, lim t\u2192\u221e \u27e8I\u27e9 = 0, lim t\u2192\u221e \u27e8Q \u27e9 = 0, lim t\u2192\u221e \u2212 (\u00b5 2 + \u03b4 + \u03b3 + 1 2 \u03c3 2 2 + 1 2 \u03c3 2 4 ) > 0 and \u03b2 < A \u00b5 1 \u03c3 2 1 , whether we also can obtain the extinction of the disease I with probability one for model (1.2 ). An example is given in Section 5 to show that the result can hold. \n\nTherefore, as a consequence of Theorem 3.3, we have the following corollary. , I(t) and Q (t) almost surely exponentially converge to zero.\n\nIn this section, we study the existence of unique stationary distribution of model (1.2) . Before giving the main results, we introduce the following lemma.\n\nLet x(t) be a regular temporally homogeneous Markov process in R d described by the stochastic differential equation\n\n. . , \u03c3 d r (x)) and B r (t) (r = 1, 2, . . . , k)) are independent standard Brownian motions defined on some probability space ( , F , P). The diffusion matrix for Eq. (4.1) is defined as \n\nwhere f (x) is a function integrable with respect to the measure \u00b5 1 . [47, 48] ). To validate condition (ii), it is sufficient to show that there is a nonnegative C 2 -function V (x) and a bounded domain U \u2282 R d with regular boundary such that for some constant k > 0 one has LV (x) < \u2212k for all x \u2208 R d \\ U (See [49] ). When in model (1.2) there is not any stochastic perturbation, that is \u03c3 i = 0 (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), then model (1.2) degenerates into the following deterministic model LetR 0 = \u03b2A \u00b5 1 (\u03b4+\u03b3 +\u00b5 2 ) . We can prove that whenR 0 > 1 then model (4.2) has a unique endemic equilibrium (S * , I * , R * ), where\n\nDefine the constants\n\nNow, on the existence and uniqueness of stationary distribution for model (1.2) we have the following result.

In model (1.2) we take the parameters A = 2.5, \u03b2 = 0.08, \u00b5 1 = 0.1, \u03c3 1 = 0.06, \u03c3 2 = 0.7, \u03c3 3 = 0.2, \u03c3 4 = 0.6, \u03c3 5 = 0.1, \u03b3 = 0.16, \u03be = 0.1, \u00b5 2 = 0.2, \u00b5 3 = 0.2 and \u03b4 = 0.1. We obtain by computing R S 0 = 0.9783 < 1, \u03b2 = 0.08 < A \u00b5 1 \u03c3 2 1 = 0.09, \u03b2 2 2\u03c3 2 1 \u2212 (\u00b5 2 + \u03b4 + \u03b3 + 1 2 (\u03c3 2 2 + \u03c3 2 4 )) = 0.0039 > 0. Therefore, Theorem 3.3 is not applicable.\n\nHowever, from the numerical simulations given in Fig. 1 , we can see that the infective I(t) and isolation Q (t) in model (1.2) are extinct with probability one, and the susceptible S(t) in model (1.2) is permanent in the mean with probability one. Example 5.2. In model (1.2), we take the parameters A = 2, \u03b2 = 0.1, \u00b5 1 = 0.1, \u03c3 1 = 0.01, \u03c3 2 = 0.12, \u03c3 3 = 0.001, \u03c3 4 = 0.14, \u03c3 5 = 0.01, \u03b3 = 0.1, \u03be = 0.05, \u00b5 2 = 0.11, \u00b5 3 = 0.22 and \u03b4 = 0.11. We obtain R S 0 = 6.1344 > 1. From the numerical simulations given in Fig. 2 , we can see that the infective I(t), isolation Q (t) and susceptible S(t) in model (1.2) are not only persistent in the mean with probability one, but also permanent in the mean with probability one. shows that Theorem 4.1 is not applicable. But, from the numerical simulations given in Fig. 3 , we can see that the solution (S(t), I(t), Q (t)) of model (1.2) still has a unique stationary distribution.\n\nExample 5.4. In model (1.2), we take the parameters A = 0.9, \u03b2 = 0.1, \u00b5 1 = 0.1, \u00b5 2 = 0.12, \u03b1 3 = 0.11 \u03c3 1 = 0.01, \u03c3 2 = 0.12, \u03c3 3 = 0.001, \u03c3 3 = 0.14, \u03c3 4 = 0.001, \u03c3 5 = 0.7 \u03b3 = 0.1, \u03be = 0.05, and \u03b4 = 0.11. We obtain R S 0 = 2.6932 > 1, R 0 = 0.7736 < 1. This shows that Theorem 4.2 is not applicable. But, from the numerical simulations given in Fig. 4 , we can see that the solutions of model (1.2) (S(t), I(t), Q (t)) may not exist the stationary distribution.\n\nIn this paper, we have investigated the global dynamics for a stochastic SIS epidemic model with isolation of the infection. The stochastic effects are assumed as the fluctuations in the transmission coefficient, disease-related rate and the proportional coefficient of isolated of infection. The research given in this paper shows that the extinction and persistence in the mean of the model are determined by a threshold value R S 0 . Concretely, we have proved that if R S 0 < 1 then disease dies out with probability one (Theorem 3.3), if R S 0 > 1, then the model is stochastic persistent or permanent in the means with probability one (Theorems 3.1 and 3.2). Furthermore, we also established the sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique stationary distribution (Theorems 4.1 and 4.2) by constructing the new suitable Lyapunov function. Particularly, we also see that the researches given in this paper extend the results on the global stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria for the corresponding deterministic model given in Lemma 2.1. We see that, in order to deal with the isolation term for the stochastic SIS epidemic model, some novel interesting research techniques are proposed. They are presented in Lemma 2.4 and the proofs of Theorems 3.1-3.3 and 4.2. In addition, we also see that there are still many problems for the considered model. These problems have been shown in Remarks 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5 and 4.3, which are interesting and valuable to be further investigated in the future."}
