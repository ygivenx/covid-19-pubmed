{"title": "Glycopeptide Antibiotics Potently Inhibit Cathepsin L in the Late\nEndosome/Lysosome and Block the Entry of Ebola Virus, Middle East Respiratory\nSyndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\nCoronavirus (SARS-CoV)*", "body": "Ebola virus (EBOV)3 is a\nfilamentous-enveloped, single-stranded, and negative-sense RNA virus, which is\ntaxonomically classified to the Filoviridae (1). To date, five species in the Ebolavirus genus have been\nidentified, including Zaire, Sudan,\nReston, Tai Forest, and Bundibugyo\nebolavirus (2\u20136). Ebola virus infection leads to severe viral hemorrhagic fever in\nhumans and non-human primates. In March 2014, outbreaks of Ebola viruses began in\nGuinea and caused over 28,000 cases of infection and over 11,000 deaths, which posed\na severe threat to public health worldwide.\n\nThe Ebola virus genome contains seven genes that encode the NP, VP35, VP40,\nglycoprotein (GP), VP30, VP24, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) virus proteins.\nTo infect host cells, the GPs of Ebola viruses first bind to attachment molecules\nsuch as \u03b21 integrins, DC-SIGNs, L-SIGNs, lectins, TIM-1s, Tyro3 family\nproteins, heparan sulfates, or folate receptor-\u03b1 (7\u201313). Ebola viruses are\nthen internalized by macropinocytosis and subsequently transported through the early\nand late endosomes and the endo/lysosomes (14\u201316), where the Ebola virus GPs are cleaved by cathepsin L and\nsubsequently cathepsin B to expose the receptor-binding domains (17). After binding the specific receptor NPC1,\nEbola viruses release their genomes into the cytoplasm of the host cells (16, 18).\n\nAnti-EBOV vaccines and drugs are under extensive development. Two promising vaccines,\nrVSV\u0394G-EBOV-GP and cAd3-EBOV, have been shown to render non-human primates\nresistant to Ebola virus infections and are currently in clinical trials (19, 20).\nIn addition, the anti-EBOV monoclonal antibody Zmapp, siRNAs, and other compounds\nthat can inhibit Ebola virus infections have been developed (21\u201324). Furthermore, several clinically approved\ndrugs were also reported to inhibit Ebola virus infections (25, 26). However,\nbecause the IC50 values of those drugs were relatively high, more\nanti-EBOV drugs with potent inhibitory activity are urgently needed. To facilitate\ntheir identification, the method of high throughput screening of clinically approved\ndrugs, which could be applied immediately in the clinic, is a reasonable approach.\nIn this study, we identified teicoplanin and several other glycopeptide antibiotics\nas Ebola virus entry inhibitors with high efficiency and low cytotoxicity, providing\na promising means to effect the prophylaxis and treatment of Ebola virus\ninfection.\n\nHEK293T, A549, HeLa, Huh7.5.1, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cell lines\nwere maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) with 10%\nfetal calf serum (Gibco), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml\nstreptomycin (Gibco) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. THP-1 cell\nlines were maintained in RPMI1640 medium (Gibco) with 10% fetal calf\nserum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin at 37\n\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial\ncells were maintained in human endothelial-SFM (Gibco) with 30 ng/ml\nendothelial cell growth supplement (Merck Millipore), 20 ng/ml\nrecombinant human FGF basic (146 amino acids) protein (R&D Systems),\n20% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml\nstreptomycin at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.\n\nGP sequence of Zaire EBOV-2014 was chemically synthesized and inserted\ninto pcDNA3.1 plasmid. The pHIV-luciferase and pCMV-VSV-G plasmids were\nobtained from Addgene, and the pCMV-\u0394R8.2 plasmid was kindly\nprovided by Dr. Trono (27). The\np4cis plasmid that encodes a Renilla luciferase\nreporter, VP40, GP and VP24, the pCAGGS-NP, pCAGGS-VP35, pCAGGS-VP30,\npCAGGS-L, pCAGGS-T7, and pCAGGS-Tim1 plasmids were produced as described\npreviously (28).\n\nPseudotyped viruses were produced by the co-transfection of\npHIV-luciferase, pCMV-\u0394R8.2, and different envelope plasmids into\nHEK293T cells that were 90% confluent in a 10-cm plate with\nLipofectamine 2000 by following the manufacturer's instructions\n(Invitrogen). The amounts of plasmids were listed as follows:\nHIV-luc/Zaire EBOV-GP(2014) pseudotyped viruses: 4.5 \u03bcg of\npHIV-luciferase, 4.5 \u03bcg of pCMV-\u0394R8.2, and 7.65 \u03bcg of\npcDNA3.1-Zaire EBOV-GP(2014); HIV-luc/VSV-G pseudotyped viruses: 4.5\n\u03bcg of pHIV-luciferase, 4.5 \u03bcg of pCMV-\u0394R8.2, and 2.7\n\u03bcg of pCMV-VSV-G; HIV-luc/SARS-CoV-S pseudotyped viruses: 6.5\n\u03bcg of pHIV-luciferase, 8 \u03bcg of pCMV-\u0394R8.2, and 20\n\u03bcg of pcDNA3.1-SARS-CoV-S; and HIV-luc/MERS-CoV-S pseudotyped\nviruses: 4.5 \u03bcg of pHIV-luciferase, 4.5 \u03bcg of\npCMV-\u0394R8.2, and 10 \u03bcg of pcDNA3.1-MERS-CoV-S. After 48 h,\nthe supernatants that contain the pseudotyped viruses were collected and\nfiltered through a 0.45-\u03bcm pore-size filter (Pall) and then stored\nat \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Ebola transcription- and\nreplication-competent virus-like particles (trVLPs) were produced by the\nco-transfection of 250 ng of p4cis plasmids that encode a\nRenilla luciferase reporter gene, VP40, GP, and\nVP24, 250 ng of pCAGGS-T7, 125 ng of pCAGGS-NP, 125 ng of pCAGGS-VP35,\n75 ng of pCAGGS-VP30, and 1000 ng of pCAGGS-L plasmids into HEK293T\ncells that were 50% confluent in a 6-well plate with Lipofectamine 2000\n(Invitrogen). After 24 h, the medium was discarded, and the cells were\nincubated with fresh medium for 48 h. Then the supernatants that contain\nEbola transcription- and replication-competent virus-like particles were\ncollected and filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm pore-size filter (Pall)\nand stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.\n\nHigh throughput screening of FDA-approved drug library (Topscience) was\nconducted in 96-well plates with 50 \u03bcm compounds per\nwell. HEK293T cells were incubated with compounds at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h\nand then infected with 100 \u03bcl of p24-normalized (5 ng)\nHIV-luc/Zaire EBOV-GP (2014) pseudotyped viruses containing 10\n\u03bcg/ml Polybrene. After 12 h, the medium was discarded, and the\ncells were washed briefly with PBS and incubated with fresh medium for\n48 h. The intracellular luciferase activity was examined with\nGloMax\u00ae 96 Microplate luminometer (Promega), and the compounds that\nhave the effects of more than 50% inhibition on the luciferase activity\nwere selected for the secondary screening, which was executed with both\nHIV-luc/Zaire EBOV-GP (2014) and HIV-luc/VSV-G pseudotyped viruses in a\nsimilar procedure.\n\nHEK293T cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (2 \u00d7 104 per\nwell). After 24 h, the cells were incubated with teicoplanin at\ndifferent concentrations at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h. The cell viability then\nwas determined by the CellTiter\u00ae 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell\nProliferation Assay (Promega).\n\nHEK293T cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (2 \u00d7 104 per\nwell). Twenty four hours later, the cells were infected with\nHIV-luc/Zaire EBOV-GP (2014) pseudotyped viruses and incubated with 50\n\u03bcm teicoplanin at 0, 2, 4, or 8 h post-infection.\nAfter 12 h, the medium was discarded, and the cells were washed briefly\nwith PBS and incubated with fresh medium for 48 h. Then the\nintracellular luciferase activity was determined. The HIV-luc/VSV-G\npseudotyped viruses were used as the controls for specificity.\n\nHEK293T cells were seeded in a 6-well plate (2 \u00d7 105 per\nwell). After 24 h, the cells were incubated with teicoplanin at various\nconcentrations at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h and then infected with\np24-normalized (100 ng) HIV-luc/Zaire EBOV-GP (2014) or HIV-luc/VSV-G\npseudotyped viruses per well. For virion entry assay, after 6 h, the\ncells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 0.25% trypsin at 37\n\u00b0C for 2 min to remove the viruses that adhered to the cell\nsurfaces. The cells were then collected and lysed, and the intracellular\namount of HIV-1 p24 was then measured by ELISA. For virion uptake assay,\nafter 0.5, 1, or 2 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated\nwith 0.25% trypsin at 37 \u00b0C for 2 min to remove the viruses that\nadhered to the cell surfaces. The cells were then collected and lysed,\nand the intracellular amount of HIV-1 p24 was then measured by\nELISA.\n\nPrimary human umbilical vein endothelial cells, A549 cells, and HeLa\ncells were seeded in a 96-well plate (2 \u00d7 104 per well).\nAfter 24 h, the cells were incubated with teicoplanin at various\nconcentrations at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The cells were then infected with\nHIV-luc/Zaire EBOV-GP (2014) pseudotyped viruses. After 12 h, the medium\nwas discarded, and the cells were washed briefly with PBS and incubated\nwith fresh medium for 48 h. Then the intracellular luciferase activity\nwas measured. The THP-1 cells were plated in a 48-well format (1.25\n\u00d7 105 per well) and incubated with teicoplanin at\nvarious concentrations at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The cells were then\ninfected with HIV-luc/Zaire EBOV-GP (2014) pseudotyped viruses. After 12\nh, the supernatants were removed by centrifugation at 300 \u00d7\ng for 10 min, and the cells were suspended and\ncultured with RPMI 1640 medium at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h. The intracellular\nluciferase activity was determined. HEK293T cells were seeded in a\n96-well plate (2 \u00d7 104 per well). After 24 h, the cells\nwere incubated with teicoplanin at gradient concentrations at 37 \u00b0C\nfor 1 h. The cells were then infected with HIV-luc/SARS-CoV-S or\nHIV-luc/MERS-CoV-S pseudotyped viruses. After 12 h, the medium was\ndiscarded, and the cells were washed briefly with PBS and incubated with\nfresh medium for 48 h. The intracellular luciferase activity was then\nmeasured. For the Ebola trVLPs entry inhibition assay, HEK293T cells\nwere seeded in a 96-well plate (2 \u00d7 104 per well). After\n24 h, in the pre-transfection experiment, the cells were pre-transfected\nwith 12.5 ng of pCAGGS-NP, 12.5 ng of pCAGGS-VP35, 7.5 ng of\npCAGGS-VP30, 100 ng of pCAGGS-L, 25 ng of pCAGGS-T7, and 25 ng of\npCAGGS-Tim1 plasmids with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the supplier's\nprotocol (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the medium was discarded, and the\ncells were incubated with teicoplanin with the gradient concentrations\nat 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. In the non-pre-transfection experiment, HEK293T\ncells were directly incubated with teicoplanin with the gradient\nconcentrations at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h without the pre-transfections of\nthe above plasmids. The cells were then infected with Ebola trVLPs.\nAfter 12 h, the medium was discarded, and the cells were washed briefly\nwith PBS and incubated with fresh medium for 48 h. Then the\nintracellular luciferase activity was measured.\n\np24-normalized (50 ng) HIV-luc/Zaire EBOV-GP (2014) pseudotyped viruses\nwere incubated with 50 \u03bcm teicoplanin in a 96-well plate\nat 37 \u00b0C for 12 h. Then the compound/virus mixtures were\ntransferred into a Microcon 30-kDa centrifugal filter device (Millipore)\nand centrifuged (7000 \u00d7 g) at 4 \u00b0C for 15\nmin. Afterward the fresh medium was twice added onto the filter device\nto wash the compound/virus mixtures. Then 0.5 ml of DMEM was used to\nsuspend the compound/virus mixtures, and the filter device was\ncentrifuged in reverse (500 \u00d7 g) at 4 \u00b0C for\n5 min, and the solution was collected and used to infect HEK293T cells\nafter HIV-1 p24 normalization. After 48 h, the intracellular luciferase\nactivity was measured. For compound/cell pre-treatment assays, HEK293T\ncells were seeded in a 96-well plate (2 \u00d7 104 per well).\nAfter 24 h, the cells were incubated with teicoplanin at various\nconcentrations at 37 \u00b0C for 12 h. The medium was discarded, and the\ncells were twice washed with PBS and incubated with fresh medium.\nAfterward the cells were infected with HIV-luc/Zaire EBOV-GP (2014)\npseudotyped viruses. Twelve hours later, the medium was discarded, and\nthe cells were washed briefly with PBS and incubated with fresh medium\nfor 48 h. The intracellular luciferase activity was then measured.\n\nHEK293T cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (1 \u00d7 104 per\nwell). After 24 h, the cells were transfected with siRNAs at a final\nconcentration of 200 nm via Lipofectamine\u00ae RNAiMAX\naccording to the supplier's protocol (Invitrogen). Forty eight hours\nlater, the cells were lysed by TRIzol\u00ae reagent (Invitrogen), and\nthe isolation of total RNAs was conducted according to the supplier's\nprotocol (Invitrogen). The RNAs were reverse-transcripted by PrimeScript\nRT reagent kit (TaKaRa), and the quantitative RT-PCRs were conducted on\na Bio-Rad CFX96 real time-PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) with SYBR\nPremix Ex Taq (TaKaRa). After the initial denaturation of cDNA was\nperformed at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, 40 cycles of the procedures (10 s of\ndenaturation at 95 \u00b0C, 30 s of annealing at 60 \u00b0C, and 30 s of\nextension at 72 \u00b0C) were performed with the primers for human\nGAPDH, ACTB, and a variety of\ntarget genes. The smart pools of siRNAs were obtained from RIBOBIO.\n\nThe procedures previously described were followed with minor\nmodifications (29). Briefly,\nHEK293T cells were incubated with 50 \u03bcm teicoplanin for\n12 h. Then the cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml dextran-Alexa Fluor 568\n(Mr 10,000) (Thermo Fisher Scientific)\nfor 2 h in 1% serum-containing DMEM. The cells were washed twice with\nPBS and incubated with 4% polyformaldehyde at room temperature for 10\nmin. The cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 0.1% Triton\nX-100 at room temperature for 10 min, followed by incubation with PBS\ncontaining 5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h.\nAfterward the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with rabbit\nanti-LAMP1 antibodies (Proteintech) at room temperature for 1 h. The\ncells were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 three times and\nincubated with DyLight\u00ae488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Abcam)\nat room temperature for 45 min, followed by washing with PBS containing\n0.1% Tween 20 three times, and incubated with 5 \u03bcg/ml DAPI at room\ntemperature for 5 min. The cells were then washed again with PBS\ncontaining 0.1% Tween 20 three times. Images were obtained by Zeiss\nLSM780 confocal microscopy using Zeiss ZFN software, and the\nco-localization of dextran and LAMP1 was analyzed from 20 fields\n(\u22655 cells per field) per independent experiment.\n\nTwo protocols previously described were followed with minor modifications\n(30, 31). Briefly, HEK293T cells were seeded in a black\n96-well plate. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with teicoplanin or\nZ-Phe-Tyr(t-Bu)-diazomethyl ketones, cathepsin L\ninhibitor III (Millipore) at various concentrations at 37 \u00b0C for 4\nh. Then the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 100 \u03bcl\nof PBS containing 50 \u03bcm (Z-Phe-Arg)2-R110 per\nwell at 37 \u00b0C for 90 min. Afterward the fluorescence was tested by\na fluorometer with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 510 nm. For\nin vitro enzymatic assay, 20 \u03bcl of 2\n\u03bcm recombinant human cathepsin L (rhCTSL) (Sino\nBiological Inc) and 60 \u03bcl of buffer (400 mm NaOAc, 4\nmm EDTA, pH 5.5) containing teicoplanin or\nZ-Phe-Tyr(t-Bu)-diazomethyl ketones were incubated\nat 37 \u00b0C for 4 h. Then the rhCTSL/compound mixtures were incubated\nfurther with 20 \u03bcl of 50 \u03bcm\n(Z-Phe-Arg)2-R110. After 4 h, the fluorescence was tested by\na fluorometer with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 510 nm.\n\nWe initiated our screening procedure by generating HIV-luc/Zaire EBOV-GP\n(2014) pseudotyped viruses. The viruses were allowed to infect HEK293T\ncells in the presence of a 1600-member FDA-approved drug library.\nCompounds that inhibited virus luciferase activity were identified as\nthe initial hits. As shown in Table\n1, we identified 133 hits that could inhibit the entry of\nHIV-luc/Zaire EBOV-GP (2014) pseudotyped viruses. To exclude the hits\nthat only inhibited early events of the HIV-1 life cycle and to identify\nEBOV-GP-specific drugs, HIV-luc/VSV-G pseudotyped viruses bearing\nvesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoproteins were used for secondary\nscreening of the initial hit compounds. Finally, two drugs that act\nspecifically as Ebola virus entry inhibitors were identified,\nteicoplanin and amiodarone (Fig.\n1A).\n\nTeicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that includes five major\ncomponents based on different side chains (Fig. 1B). It demonstrated an\nIC50 of 0.34 \u03bcm for its inhibitory effect\non HIV-luc/Zaire EBOV-GP (2014) pseudotyped viruses (Fig. 1C). The\ncytotoxicity of teicoplanin was also determined using a cell viability\nassay, and its CC50 was greater than 500\n\u03bcm (Fig.\n1D). To further confirm whether teicoplanin\nacts as an Ebola virus entry inhibitor, a time-of-addition assay was\nconducted. The data showed that teicoplanin represses the entry of Ebola\nviruses at the early stage of Ebola virus infection (Fig. 1E). In\naddition, a virion entry assay also demonstrated that teicoplanin\ninhibits the entry of HIV-luc/Zaire EBOV-GP (2014) pseudotyped viruses\nin a dose-dependent manner. However, teicoplanin does not repress the\nentry of HIV-luc/VSV-G pseudotyped viruses (Fig. 1F).\n\nEbola viruses can infect a wide range of host cells, including vascular\nendothelial cells, epithelial cells, and monocytes, which account for\nthe pathogenesis observed in Ebola-infected patients (32, 33). Thus, it was important to examine whether teicoplanin\ncould repress the entry of Ebola viruses into different types of cells.\nThe data showed that teicoplanin effectively represses virus entry into\nprimary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Fig. 2A), human epithelial cell\nlines such as A549 (Fig.\n2B) and HeLa cells (Fig. 2C), and the human acute\nmonocytic leukemia THP-1 cell line (Fig.\n2D).\n\nTo elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the anti-Ebola virus activity of\nteicoplanin, it is necessary to determine whether the target of\nteicoplanin is located directly on the virus itself. The compound virus\npre-incubation assay demonstrated that when teicoplanin was\npre-incubated with Ebola/HIV pseudotyped viruses and then filtered and\nwashed away, the inhibitory effect of the antibiotic on Ebola virus\nentry did not occur (Fig.\n3A). However, the compound cell\npre-treatment assay showed that when the host cells were pre-treated\nwith teicoplanin and subsequently washed to remove the drug, its\ninhibitory effect on Ebola/HIV pseudotyped viruses remained (Fig. 3B). Together,\nthese data indicated that the target of teicoplanin is located on the\nhost cells.\n\nTo clarify the molecular mechanism of teicoplanin action, we tested\nwhether teicoplanin inhibits the entry of other viruses able to utilize\nsimilar intracellular transport routes as those employed by Ebola\nviruses. It has been reported that both Ebola viruses and SARS\ncoronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) need to be transported to the endo/lysosomes\nto release their genomes (Fig.\n4A) (18). Therefore, HIV-luc/SARS-CoV-S pseudotyped viruses that\nbear the S proteins of SARS-CoVs were generated and used to test whether\ntheir entry could be repressed by teicoplanin. The data indicated that\nteicoplanin also inhibits the entry of SARS-CoVs (Fig. 4B). Given that Niemann-Pick\nC1 (NPC1) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) represent the cell\nreceptors of Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs, respectively (16, 34, 35), and that\nteicoplanin inhibits both of these viruses, it is necessary to clarify\nwhether Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs share cell receptor affinity.\nFollowing depletion of the expression of NPC1 and ACE2 in HEK293T cells\nusing siRNAs, the cells were infected with Ebola or SARS-CoV pseudotyped\nviruses. The results demonstrated that the knockdown of NPC1 affected\nthe infectivity of Ebola but not that of SARS-CoV pseudotyped viruses,\nwhereas the converse was observed following ACE2 knockdown (Fig. 4C). This\nindicates that these two viruses are each associated with specific\nreceptors and also excludes the possibility that teicoplanin inhibits\nthe interaction between the viruses and their cell receptors or the\nevents following receptor binding. Taken together, these data led us to\nhypothesize that the target of teicoplanin would be the host factor(s)\nwhich is (are) required for both Ebola and SARS-CoV infection.\nConsidering that interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs)\nrepresent the first line of anti-viral defense of the cells, we first\nexamined the effect of teicoplanin on the expression of IFITMs. However,\nthe data showed that teicoplanin did not induce the expression of IFITMs\n(data not shown).\n\nWe further examined the host factors that are required for both Ebola\nviruses and SARS-CoVs but not VSVs using siRNAs. Through genome-wide\nhaploid genetic screening, several host factors essential for Ebola\nviral infection have been identified (16). Accordingly, we infected cells with Ebola-, SARS-CoV-,\nor VSV-pseudotyped HIV-1 viruses after siRNA-mediated knockdown of the\nexpression of 13 individual host factors. We found that cathepsin L\n(CTSL), VPS11, VPS18, VPS33A, VPS39, and VPS41 are required for both\nEbola and SARS-CoV infection (Fig.\n5B) rather than VSV infection. These results\nimply that the host factors might be the targets of teicoplanin. VPS11,\nVPS18, VPS33A, VPS39, and VPS41 are components of HOPS complexes, which\nmediate the homotypic fusion between late endosomes and the heterotypic\nfusion between late endosomes and lysosomes (29, 36,\n37). To investigate whether\nteicoplanin affects the transport of Ebola viruses by inhibiting HOPS\ncomplex function and subsequently disturbing endosome maturation and\nfusion between the late endosomes and the lysosomes, a dextran uptake\nassay was conducted (Fig.\n5C). We found that within 2 h of uptake, the\ndextran-Alexa Fluor 568 could be transported into lysosome-associated\nmembrane protein 1 (LAMP1)-positive lysosomes. The co-localization\ncoefficient of dextran and LAMP1 was influenced by siRNA knockdown of\nVPS39 and VPS41, whereas teicoplanin did not exert any effect (Fig. 5D). These data\nindicated that teicoplanin does not inhibit the transport of\ndextran-Alexa Fluor 568. Therefore, it is unlikely that teicoplanin\ninhibits the entry of Ebola viruses by affecting HOPS complexes. In\naddition, we conducted virion uptake assays to demonstrate that\nteicoplanin does not inhibit both Ebola- and VSV-pseudotyped virion\nuptake at 0.5, 1, and 2 h post-infection (Fig. 5, E and F). These\ndata indicated that teicoplanin did not affect the endocytosis of Ebola-\nand VSV-pseudotyped virions, at least the early phase. In addition,\nthese data also indicated that, except HOPS complexes, teicoplanin has\nno effect on the other host factors that are involved in the process of\nvirion uptake.\n\nAfter excluding the possibility that the machinery for vesicle transport\nis involved in the inhibitory effect of teicoplanin, we assumed that the\nenzymes in the late endosome/lysosome could be the target of\nteicoplanin. The proteolysis of glycoprotein by cathepsin L has been\nreported to be required for the membrane fusion of both Ebola viruses\nand SARS-CoVs (31). In contract,\ncathepsin B is required for Ebola virus infection but not SARS-CoV\ninfection (17, 31). As such, we hypothesized that\ncathepsin L rather than cathepsin B could be the target for teicoplanin.\nTo this end, we examined whether teicoplanin can inhibit the enzymatic\nactivity of cathepsin L (Fig.\n6A). Two assays to measure the cathepsin L\nenzymatic activity were performed (30, 31). We showed\nthat teicoplanin potently inhibits the activity of cathepsin L in a\ndose-dependent manner (Fig. 6,\nB and E). Considering that the\ninhibitory dose of teicoplanin on the activity of cathepsin L is higher\nthan that required for Ebola virus infection inhibition, a cell\nviability assay was performed to confirm that the inhibitory effect is\nnot due to cytotoxicity (Fig.\n6C). In addition, a comparative analysis of\nthe inhibitory dose of teicoplanin and that of previously reported\ncathepsin L inhibitors, Z-Phe-Tyr(t-Bu)-diazomethyl\nketones, on Ebola virus infection was conducted. We demonstrated that\nboth compounds can inhibit Ebola virus infection at low doses. The\nIC50 dose of teicoplanin required to inhibit the Ebola\nentry is approximately four times more than that of\nZ-Phe-Tyr(t-Bu)-diazomethyl ketones (Fig. 6D and Table 2). Similarly, the\nIC50 dose of teicoplanin required to inhibit the\nenzymatic activity of cathepsin L was also approximately four times\ngreater (Fig. 6, B\nand E, and Table\n2). These data indicated that the high doses of teicoplanin\ndetermined to be required for the inhibition of cathepsin L enzymatic\nactivity could be due to the relatively low sensitivity of the cathepsin\nL activity assay. These data clearly demonstrate the consistency between\nthe inhibition of virus entry and the inhibition of cathepsin L activity\nand further support our conclusion that the target molecule of\nteicoplanin is cathepsin L.\n\nAn Ebola trVLP system (28), which\ncan simulate the life cycle of wild-type Ebola viruses to a large\nextent, was applied to investigate whether teicoplanin and its\nglycopeptide antibiotic homologs dalbavancin, oritavancin, telavancin,\nand vancomycin can also inhibit the entry of Ebola trVLPs. Accordingly,\nthe p4cis plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase, VP40,\nGP, and VP24 was transfected into HEK293T cells along with plasmids\nexpressing T7 RNA polymerase, NP, VP35, VP30, and L viral proteins to\nproduce Ebola trVLPs (Fig.\n7A). When the target cells were also\npre-transfected with NP, VP35, VP30, L, T7, and Tim1 plasmids, the\ntranscription and replication of the Ebola virus minigenome were\nactively stimulated to produce infectious Ebola trVLPs. The\nIC50 value of teicoplanin on Ebola trVLP entry was\n\u223c390 nm under these conditions (Fig. 7B). Additionally, when the\ntarget cells were not pre-transfected with the above plasmids, the Ebola\nviral minigenomes were only weakly transcribed and replicated with\nminimal production of infectious trVLPs. The IC50 of\nteicoplanin on the entry of Ebola trVLPs was \u223c330 nm\nunder the non-pre-transfection conditions (Fig. 7C). In addition, we also examined\nwhether the homologs of teicoplanin can inhibit Ebola trVLP entry. The\ndata demonstrated that the IC50 values of dalbavancin,\noritavancin, and telavancin on Ebola trVLP entry were \u223c1.61,\n1.73, and 1.89 \u03bcm, respectively, under pre-transfection\nconditions (Fig. 7, D,\nF, and H) and \u223c2.77, 2.13, and 2.30\n\u03bcm, respectively, under non-pre-transfection\nconditions (Fig. 7, E,\nG, and I). However, we found that\nvancomycin did not inhibit Ebola trVLP entry under either condition\n(Fig. 7, J and\nK). The CC50 values of\ndalbavancin, oritavancin, telavancin, and vancomycin were also\ndetermined (data not shown). These data indicated that these homologs\nmight share similar structures that are indispensable for the inhibitory\neffects on Ebola trVLP entry. However, vancomycin would not be expected\nto have similar structures (Fig.\n9).\n\nBecause our data demonstrated that teicoplanin inhibits cathepsin L\nenzymatic activity and that cathepsin L is also essential for MERS-CoV\nand SARS-CoV entry (31, 38), we therefore hypothesized that\nteicoplanin and its homologs could also inhibit the entry of MERS-CoVs\nand SARS-CoVs. The data illustrated that the IC50 values of\nteicoplanin, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin on MERS-CoV entry\nwere \u223c0.63, 2.99, 2.12, and 3.24 \u03bcm respectively\n(Fig. 8,\nA\u2013D). However, vancomycin did not inhibit\nthe MERS-CoV entry (Fig.\n8I). Additionally, the IC50\nvalues of teicoplanin, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin on the\nentry of SARS-CoVs were \u223c3.76, 9.64, 4.96, and 3.45\n\u03bcm, respectively (Fig.\n8, E\u2013H). However, vancomycin did not\ninhibit the entry of SARS-CoVs (Fig.\n8J). These data indicated that glycopeptide\nantibiotics with the exception of vancomycin exhibit broad antiviral\nactivity because of their inhibitory effects on cathepsin L.\n\nIn our study, we performed high throughput screening of a clinically approved drug\nlibrary and identified that teicoplanin not only inhibits the entry of Ebola/HIV-1\npseudotyped viruses but also of transcription- and replication-competent trVLPs. The\nIC50 value of teicoplanin on the entry of Ebola trVLPs is as low as\n330 nm, whereas the CC50 of teicoplanin is over\n500 \u03bcm. In addition, teicoplanin inhibits the entry of Ebola viruses\ninto different types of host cells, including primary human umbilical vein\nendothelial cells, A549 cells, HeLa cells, and THP-1 cells. It also inhibits the\nentry of MERS-CoV/HIV-1 and SARS-CoV/HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses.\n\nTeicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic isolated from Actinoplanes\nteichomyceticus. Teicoplanin contains five major components (39, 40)\nthat can form complexes with the C-terminal\nl-Lys\u2013d-Ala\u2013d-Ala subunits of lipid II\npeptidoglycan precursors. Teicoplanin binding of lipid II inhibits their\ntransglycosylation and transpeptidation, leading to disturbed cell wall synthesis in\nGram-positive bacteria (41). Recently,\nteicoplanin was reported to inhibit Ebola pseudovirus infection in cell culture,\nwhich is consistent with our observations. Teicoplanin was also demonstrated to have\nan effect on a common component used by both enveloped Ebola viruses and human\nrespiratory syncytial viruses but not by non-enveloped viruses (26). However, the mechanism by which\nteicoplanin inhibits the entry of Ebola remained unresolved. To elucidate the\nmolecular mechanisms underlying this process, we compared the entry of Ebola viruses\nand SARS-CoVs and the effect of teicoplanin thereon. Teicoplanin represses the entry\nof both Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs, which require transport to the endo/lysosomes\nto deliver their genomes. Because several host factors have been reported to be\nessential for Ebola and SARS-CoV virus infection, the identification of the common\nhost factors that are required for the entry of both Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs\nwould likely be helpful to clarify the target of teicoplanin. Our data demonstrated\nthat CTSL, VPS11, VPS18, VPS33A, VPS39, and VPS41 are all indispensable for the\nentry of both Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs (Fig.\n5B). The elucidation via a dextran uptake assay that\nteicoplanin does not affect the functions of HOPS complexes suggested that the\ntarget of teicoplanin was cathepsin L. In support of this, the results of two\ncathepsin L enzymatic activity assays indicated that teicoplanin indeed inhibits the\nactivity of cathepsin L, which can explain why teicoplanin inhibited both the entry\nof Ebola viruses and human respiratory syncytial viruses as shown in a previous\nstudy (26) because cathepsin L is required\nfor the infection mechanism of both (17,\n42). Considering that cathepsin L is also\nrequired for the entry of MERS-CoVs, teicoplanin thus represents a broad virus entry\ninhibitor. In addition, the inhibitory effects of teicoplanin and its derivatives on\nHIV-1, HCV, influenza viruses, flaviviruses, FIPV, and SARS-CoVs have also been\nreported (43\u201349), further supporting that the antiviral target for glycopeptide\nantibiotics is a common host factor.\n\nAs teicoplanin can bind lipid IIs, we hypothesized that it might interact with the\nenzymatic domains of cathepsin L and block their functions similar to the reported\ninhibitory effect of antimicrobial peptide LL-37 on cathepsin L (50). The specific binding sites of teicoplanin\non cathepsin L need to be further investigated by molecular docking, amino acid\nmutation, and surface plasmon resonance to confirm this hypothesis. We also examined\nthe effects of the teicoplanin homologs dalbavancin, oritavancin, telavancin, and\nvancomycin on the entry of Ebola trVLPs, MERS-CoV/HIV-1, and SARS-CoV/HIV-1\npseudotyped viruses. The data demonstrated that dalbavancin, oritavancin, and\ntelavancin also inhibit the entryof MERS-CoV/HIV-1 and SARS-CoV/HIV-1 pseudotyped\nviruses. However, vancomycin did not repress their infection. By comparing the\nstructures of these compounds, we found that all the glycopeptide antibiotics that\ninhibit Ebola trVLP, MERS-CoV/HIV-1, and SARS-CoV/HIV-1 pseudotyped virus entry\ncontain hydrophobic groups at the amidogen domains of their aminosaccharides. These\ngroups might play an important role in the interactions between the glycopeptide\nantibiotics and cathepsin L. In contrast, vancomycin lacks the hydrophobic groups,\nwhich might be the reason why it does not inhibit these viral infections (Fig. 9).\n\nFor the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections in the clinic, teicoplanin\ncan be administered intravenously or intramuscularly once daily following an initial\nloading dose, which is convenient for outpatient therapy (51). Compared with vancomycin, which was the first discovered\nglycopeptide antibiotic, teicoplanin is better tolerated with lower nephrotoxicity\n(52). The Summary of Product\nCharacteristics for teicoplanin in 2014 shows that, after the completion of the\nloading dose regimens for most Gram-positive bacterial infections, the serum\nconcentrations of teicoplanin are at least 15 mg/liter (8.78 \u03bcm),\nwhich is \u223c27, 14, and 2 times higher than the IC50 values of\nteicoplanin against the entry of Ebola viruses, MERS-CoV/HIV-1, and SARS-CoV/HIV-1\npseudotyped viruses, respectively. As the toxicity of glycopeptide antibiotics is\nquite low, we propose that glycopeptide antibiotics might be used in the clinic for\nEbola/MERS-CoV/SARS-CoV infection, especially in the case of emergency requirements\nduring outbreaks of these severe viral infections.\n\nAll listed authors contributed to this work and reviewed the manuscript.
