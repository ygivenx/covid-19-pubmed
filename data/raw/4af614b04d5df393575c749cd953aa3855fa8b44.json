Although this research was conducted by independent researchers, it has included a selected group of participants, whose perspectives may or may not differ from the broader population. Moreover, staff perspectives may have been influenced by the time duration since the outbreak was curtailed. Finally, decision-makers, who are very well informed about the outbreak management, have shared in the interviews, and we cannot rule out a possible conflict of interest. Effort was made to eliminate these limitations through strong methodological rigors. The lessons learned from this work can be summarized as:\n\n\u2022 Inadequate facility readiness to implement infection prevention control guidelines may lead to an outbreak situation. Strict implementation is mandatory regardless of the volume of work.\n\n\u2022 Boarding of patients in the emergency department should follow internationally accepted figures regardless of the number boarded.\n\n\u2022 Collective leadership is the management method of choice when dealing with a multidimensional leadership crisis.\n\n\u2022 A national-level crisis management media center and pre-existing media disaster plan are needed to reduce the anxiety of health care workers and improve trust.\n\n\u2022 Mental health support for health care workers is an important factor in increasing resilience and cooperation within the workforce. How can decision-makers in health care organizations manage crises better? Rapid and widespread pandemics pose high risks to mortality, health systems, and economies, locally, nationally and globally. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), caused by the newly described coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is one such major emerging health concern. Death occurs in around 65% of all patients, who contract MERS-CoV, resulting from severe acute respiratory infection and multi-organ failure. 1 MERS-CoV outbreaks have occurred in 26 countries across the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America, 3 ,4 yet successful management of MERS-CoV outbreaks is very challenging because, not only does infection most commonly occur in health care workers (HCW) 2 , knowledge of both the causes of the virus and its treatment is preliminary. 3, 4, 5, 6 Most outbreaks to date are attributed to low-adherence to infection control (IC) practices, crowded emergency departments (ED), and slow responsiveness to outbreaks. 7 Consequently, to assist organizational preparedness 8 , more knowledge is needed to guide management of MERS-CoV infection outbreaks. This is especially important given the wide breadth of response needed, which can encompass improving IC practices to providing psychological support to HCWs. 9 A major new outbreak of the MERS-CoV occurred at the King Abdulaziz Medical City-Riyadh (KAMC-R) 10 ; a large teaching hospital and university center in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in June 2015. 11 The outbreak resulted in 130 cases of infection (53% mortality rate), directly or indirectly involved 9000 HCWs at the site, and affected all major departments at the institution (table 1) .\n\nLittle research on MERS-CoV exists to guide management of this major infection outbreak.\n\nWhile HCW's perceptions of risk 12 and psychological reactions, 13 to similarly serious respiratory viruses have been explored, this is the first study of stakeholder perspectives of \n\nQualitative case study using process evaluation 14, 15 was used to identify key stakeholder perceptions of the processes, lessons and insights arising from the successful management of the MERS-CoV outbreak. 15 \n\nTwenty-eight participants took part in the study. Semi-structured individual key informant qualitative interviews were undertaken with nine senior leaders/decision-makers; each responsible for one or more facets of the major management decisions during the outbreak, and nineteen frontline HCWs (ten nurses and nine physicians) who were each in direct patient care contact with MERS-CoV patients during the outbreak.\n\nExcluding the top nine decision-makers who were invited directly to participate, recruitment was undertaken via volunteer quota sampling of staff from across the hospital. Interviews were carried out in the clinical institution by independent researchers with no direct involvement with the site. Data collection schedules were developed from past literature, approaches to were audio-recorded via a digital device with data transcribed immediately after data collection. Interviews continued till we reached data saturation. Each interview/group lasted between 45-100 minutes; transcripts included non-verbal behavior. To supplement these data, written documentation (Appendix 1) was also analyzed to direct the questions posed during the qualitative data collection.\n\nProcess evaluation is an appropriate qualitative method to generate insights from key stakeholders on contributions to, and factors affecting key outcomes or processes, in organizations or interventions. 14, 15 Within this method, a case study approach with embedded units was used to identify the influence of the various associated attributes on strategic decisionmaking and collective leadership practices within the organization. Collective leadership was defined as \"a dynamic leadership process in which defined leaders, or set of leaders, selectively utilize skills and expertise within a network, effectively distributing elements of the leadership role as the situation or problem at hand requires\". 16 Interview transcripts were analyzed using a manual iteration process to determine common themes -once common initial key aspects of the outbreak management had been identified via a preliminary analysis. For each interview, codes, sub-themes, and themes were then identified and subsequently tested and refined in a cyclical process by two of the investigators. We moved back and forth between the interviews to ensure the finalized analysis was completed.\n\nRigor was maintained via a variety of techniques appropriate to qualitative methods. Member checking enhanced credibility and transferability: the results were presented to thirteen of the participants to ensure the findings were comprehensible. Participants concurred with the proposed results with minor comments on the language, rather than the content. Peer debriefing \n\nData analysis has revealed five themes and fifteen sub-themes. These themes are 1) Stress of the outbreak, 2) Factors perceived to contribute to outbreak occurrence, 3) Factors perceived to contribute to success of outbreak control, 4) Factors inhibiting outbreak control, and 5) Longterm institutional gains in response to the outbreak management ( Table 2 ). In the results, themes are presented in bold and sub-themes (codes) are presented in italic bold typing.\n\nAcross all participants, data indicated that the MERS outbreak was perceived to constitute an episode of the most pressing and serious significance to the organization. Variously, it was described as a\" serious and straining situation\" and a \"situation that carries national and international significance\". Frontline HCWs and senior decision-makers alike not only perceived this high gravity, but also the high demands the outbreak placed on them personally.\n\nThroughout the interviews, participants described the outbreak as being a period of severe and sustained \"tension\", \"doubts\", \"challenges\", \"fear\", and \"anger\". Although visits, communications and collaborations from external regulatory agencies (such as the Saudi Ministry of Health, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention \"CDC\" and the World Health Organization \"WHO\"), were perceived to be useful, these also added additional stresses and responsibilities amidst the pressurized situation. As an extremely \"High-demand situation\", hospital decision-makers had to implement immediate major operational decisions to control the outbreak. The implemented steps were escalated to near-closure of this large institution. The serious impact of the crisis on patient care and on the organization's reputation encouraged all HCWs and decision-makers to exert their maximum effort and experience to assist in its management. The high level of stress experienced by HCWs was exacerbated by the \"hard and uncertain progress\" to whether and how the situation would improve. \"Teamwork and collaborative management\" were encouraged, and despite the stressful situation, institution decision-makers and frontline HCWs showed a strong sense of reliability and responsibility.\n\nStrong consensus existed among participants that the organization's \"growing reliance on ED boarding\" was a main contributor to the outbreak. While some lamented that this build up was permitted by senior decision-makers to occur over the long-term, others saw the contributing factors as being more upstream. These factors are related to the high trust patients had for the NGHA, the relative lack of primary care services and problems associated with patient flows at the level of the city, communication and teamwork between the city hospitals, and the lack of a national plan that allows hospitals across different sectors to share the burden of the growing patient population. Another leading factor to the outbreak was the \"inadequate implementation of IPC guidelines\" within the extremely busy ED and the suboptimal recognition of the importance of IPC principles across the organization. empowering HCWs to work collaboratively to address the outbreak, involving staff in outbreak control and stimulating staff resilience and teamwork. The culture was one of \"collective leadership practice\" (table 1) with leaders being seen to have practiced high levels of availability, visibility, empowerment of middle management and strong links with frontline staff.\n\nKey factors consolidating the collaborative culture were a clear shared vision, high meeting frequency (twice daily) of key decision-makers involved in the outbreak, rapid and efficient decision-making, involvement of all the right units and decision-makers, and a high level of accountability. The CCC committee was seen widely as being a delicate mix of openness, with high accountability, strategic utilization of team diversities, and strong mutual support. The leadership practiced during the outbreak served to \"improve mutual trust between front liners and top management\". This was perceived to contribute to a renewed sense of confidence in both decision-makers and frontline HCWs. The success in controlling the outbreak in a relatively short time fostered a widespread sense of pride among those working in the organization.\n\nFactors that were perceived to challenge the outbreak management were mostly related to historical management practices and context. The organization was perceived to be acutely and chronically slow in responding to the outbreak. The main factors perceived to limit the capacity of handling the outbreak adequately were related to:\n\n1. Initial logistic barriers to promptly implement the escalation process outlined in the institution's Infectious Disease Epidemic Plan (IDEP) ( Anxiety increased among health professionals, due to the \"lack of appropriate staff counseling and mental health support\". The psychological demands on frontline health professionals escalated, not only by undertaking tasks associated with the IDEP implementation, but also due to a range of coalescing factors; most notably the need to manage the outbreak simultaneously with the closure of most of the institution's units, combined with the negative media commentary. Almost all frontline participants have repeatedly expressed the need for a center that provides counseling and mental health support to employees in such stressful situations.\n\nWhile the outbreak led to challenges in the short term, over the longer term, participants discerned that there had been long-term benefits, including:\n\n1-Improvement in the facility to be more compatible with IC guidelines. KAMC-R to work collaboratively to address long-standing issues around IPC, ED boarding and nursing standards.\n\nLearning from crises helps identify gaps, expedites system improvements and aids in effective management. 17 However, learning from rare events is challenging because each event is comparably rare and occurs in different contexts. As these events are also complex, 18 qualitative rather than quantitative research can be especially useful in generating insights and lessons to inform future outbreak control. 18 Useful lessons gleaned from this study of MERS crisis management (table 3) concur with other research. It is not just the actions of staff, leaders and decision-makers that contribute to successful management, but also the mutual trust that accrues via the delegation of responsibilities, team management, coordination, tasks distribution, role clarification, and communication. 19, 20 As with other studies, this research showed that a number of different strands of management contributed to success, including: the knowledge exchange that occurred during the CCC meetings, where senior decision-makers, frontline HCWs, and different participants with a shared purpose, provided the working group a useful means to exchange learning experiences 21, 22 from different parts of the organization. 23 Inspirational influencing tactics by senior decision-makers impacted their followers' willingness to engage in leadership roles. 24 The participation of multiple decision-makers and their shared purpose brought unique skills and expertise to the table. 25 The implementation of a collaborative decentralized management as the crisis progressed 23 Weaknesses in media management during the outbreak adversely affected staff morale and contributed to their anxiety. 26 Such challenges are not unusual. 27 Large health institutions should have a media center or representative capable of implementing a well-designed, coordinated media crisis plan.\n\nMental health support to frontline HCWs was a major missing element in managing the MERS outbreak. Support and counseling for staff during an emergency situation is recommended. [28] [29] [30] In\n\nSingapore for example, the Ministry of Health funded a \"comprehensive crisis response management system\". 28 Such initiatives may be more effective in supporting staff than support from other health professionals. 29 Support can be targeted to those in most need via screening of employees. 29, 30 Research limitations and strengths: This research served to increase learning from an unusual and particularly serious infection outbreak. Inevitably, the research was conducted among a select group of participants, and their perspectives may or may not differ from the broader population of staff at the KAMC-R. While independent researchers undertook the interviews, responses may have been influenced by the \"official\" links between the project and the organization. Staff perspectives may have also been influenced by the time duration since the outbreak was curtailed (around eight months). Moreover, decision-makers who are very well informed about the outbreak management have shared in the interviews. We addressed these limitations through different data collection sources, member checking and data triangulation.\n\nManagement of the MERS outbreak at KAMC-R is an example of collective leadership practice  F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 In addition to the IDEP plan, which was established in 2013 with the detailed MERS flowcharts, a more strict and explicit triage process was established to ensure early identification of suspected MERS cases. This was added as the first layer of the patient triage process and implemented in the newly established drive-through system to the ER, and at the entrances of the ACC. Once a patient has entered the main ER, a second screening would take place to identify any possible cases that may have been missed by the first process. CMT, a medical team managing all admitted patients with respiratory illness and CPRT, an outreach team responsible to ensure proper location, testing, transfer, discharge and consultation for suspected and confirmed MERS cases.\n\nA two phase program aimed to train, assess and audit infection control practices of HCWs was implemented. Phase one was launched on September 28 th , 2015, and designed to ensure competence in basic IPC knowledge and practice. The second phase was designed to address sustainability of HCWs' certification and to ensure accountability. Full-time IPC observer(s) and trained DCNs were assigned for program monitoring.\n\nThe committee was activated as part of the IDEP phase 2 process, and is chaired by the Executive Director, Medical Services. Members include: CEO, CMO, ED Infection Control department, and heads of most concerned medical, media, security, logistics and nursing departments. The committee charges have allowed the meeting team to take major decisions and implement them immediately bypassing the usual routine hierarchy process. ED and patient triaging transformation ED staff and the military police have controlled all ED entrances, and access was restricted to ED employees. The MERS plan was implemented aiming to avoid any future occurrences of any infectious diseases. Major changes in the ED workflow were implemented. A drive-through was established at the entrance of the ED with 3 lanes and 4 windows per lane, manned by trained unit assistants to implement the initial triage process. Second, was the establishment of an 18 respiratory-isolation room facility for which patients with a suspected respiratory illness would be isolated and evaluated. Third, was a reducation in patient boarding time.\n\nIM Department and the Bed Coordination Unit have facilitated patient admissions. The Bed Coordination unit was turned into a department chaired by a senior IM physician. A new IM division was established and staffed to manage all general IM cases and shorten patient boarding time in the ED.\n\nEstablished in response to almost complete closure of the institution, this center has served to respond to calls from patients and their families, reschedule/direct patients' appointments at the ACC, reschedule/direct surgeries and admissions in all clinical departments. In national level crisis management, media center and a pre-existing media disaster plan are mandatory to reduce HCW anxiety and improve trust in the institution and its staff.\n\nHCW mental health care and anxiety relief are important factors to increase resilience and cooperation within the workforce. \n\nA checklist of items that should be included in reports of qualitative research.

City-Riyadh (KAMC-R) in June 2015 10 ; a large teaching hospital and university center in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 11 The outbreak resulted in 130 cases of infection (53% mortality rate) and directly or indirectly involved 9000 HCWs at the site, and affected all major departments at the institution (Table 1) . A comprehensive objective analysis of this outbreak 10 identified that one third of cases were in health care workers, with half of cases occurring in ED staff (overall mean age: 37 years; 77% female). 10 Infected patients who were not health care workers had a median age of 66 years and 65% were male. 10 No deaths occurred among health care workers. 10 Symptom onset in the last infected patient was August 28, 2015; the end perceptions of risk 12 and psychological reactions, 13 to similar respiratory viruses have been explored, to our knowledge, this is the first study of stakeholder perspectives of the factors promoting and inhibiting effective emergency management of MERS-CoV.

Peer debriefing involved a second researcher analyzing a random selection of interviews to ensure themes were comprehensible.\n\nHealth Affairs (NGHA) approved the research proposal. All participants provided written \n\nData analysis identified five themes and fifteen sub-themes. These themes are 1) The high stress of the outbreak, 2) Factors perceived to contribute to outbreak occurrence, 3) Factors perceived to contribute to success of outbreak control, 4) Factors inhibiting outbreak control, and 5) Longterm institutional gains in response to the outbreak management (Table 2 ). In the results, themes are presented in bold and sub-themes (codes) are presented in italic bold typing.\n\nThe high stress of the outbreak:\n\nAll participants reported that the MERS-CoV outbreak was seen to constitute an episode of the most pressing and serious significance to the organization and country. Consistently across interviews, it was described in such terms as a \"serious and straining situation\" and a \"situation that carries national and international significance\".\n\nFrontline HCWs and senior decision-makers alike not only perceived this high gravity, but also the high and diverse demands the outbreak placed on them personally (\"A very demanding situation\"). Throughout the interviews, participants described the outbreak as being a period of severe and sustained \"tension\", \"doubts\", \"challenges\", \"fear\", and \"anger\". Frequent visits, communications and collaborations from external regulatory agencies (such as the Saudi\n\nMinistry of Health, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention \"CDC\" and the World Health Organization \"WHO\"), were perceived to be useful but also served to add stresses and responsibilities amidst the pressurized situation which led to near-closure of this large institution.\n\nThe perceived seriousness of the crisis was reported to motivate staff to expend maximum effort to assist in its management. However, the high levels of stress were exacerbated by a pervading sense that controlling the outbreak involved \"hard and uncertain progress\" because whether and how the situation would improve was seen to be very unclear.\n\nStrong consensus existed among participants that the organization's \"growing reliance on Emergency Department (ED) boarding\" was the main contributor to the outbreak. While some lamented that this build up was permitted by senior decision-makers to occur over the long-term, other participants saw other upstream factors as also being involved, notably \"inadequate\n\nrecognition of the importance of IPC principles across the organization was perceived to be compounded by the high demands placed on the ED by the large patient population. Other factors seen to contribute to the outbreak included: high trust patients had for the NGHA, the relative lack of primary care services and problems associated with patient flow across the city, poor communication and teamwork between the city hospitals, and a lack of pre-emptive national planning to allows hospitals across different sectors to share the burden of the growing city population.\n\nThroughout this challenging situation, \"Teamwork and collaborative management\" were seen to be pivotal. There was a sense of close alignment between both decision-makers and frontline\n\nHCWs in management priorities. The approach of senior management to the situation was perceived by participants as being open, without blame or \"finger-pointing\". Indeed, managers were seen to have focused on empowering HCWs to work collaboratively to address the outbreak, involving staff in outbreak control and stimulating staff resilience and teamwork. In this way, the dominant culture was perceived by staff to one of \"collective leadership practice\" \n\nFactors perceived to inhibit management of the outbreak were mostly related to initial poor management practices and the negative and compounding effects of media reporting and high stress. The organization was perceived to be acutely and chronically slow in responding to the outbreak. For example, organizational responses from management to the outbreak was perceived to be relatively slow compared to the rapid speed with which the infection spread.\n\nMoreover, despite references to high management transparency, some staff cited that \"poor staff orientation and management ambiguity\" contributed to staff being isolated and unclear about the decisions and measures being adopted by senior management to promote infection control.\n\nThis perceived poor communication created additional confusion that led to low coordination of IC instructions from both infection control and the nursing teams. Consequently, some health 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Learning from crises helps manage these better in future via identifying gaps and fostering comprehensive system improvements and effective management. 17 However, learning from major events is challenging because each event is comparably rare and occurs in different contexts. As these events are also complex, 18 qualitative as well as quantitative research 10 is useful for generating insights and lessons to inform future outbreak control. 18 Useful lessons gleaned from this study of MERS-CoV crisis management (Table 3) concur with other research. It is not just the actions of staff, leaders and decision-makers that contributed to successful management, but also the mutual trust that accrues via the delegation of responsibilities, team management, coordination, tasks distribution, role clarification, and communication. 19, 20 This reflects the practice of collective leadership -defined as \"a dynamic leadership process in which defined leaders, or set of leaders, selectively utilize skills and expertise within a network, effectively distributing elements of the leadership role as the situation or problem at hand requires. 21 This research corroborates others work which identifies that a number of different strands of management contribute to success, particularly, the benefits of centralized yet inclusive meetings during which senior decision-makers and frontline HCWs share knowledge and learning 22 from different parts of the organization. 23 24 25 Other key lessons for crisis management arising from this study arose from the weaknesses around the media management during the outbreak which adversely affected reported staff morale and anxiety. 26 Such challenges are not unusual. 27 Large health institutions managing major crises should have a dedicated media center or representative capable of implementing a well-designed and coordinated media crisis plan to aid communication, address questions and proactively act to protect the reputation of the organization and its staff.\n\nFinally, mental health support to frontline HCWs was a major missing element in managing the MERS-CoV outbreak. Indeed, psychological and personal support and counseling for staff during emergency situations is recommended. [28] [29] [30] In Singapore for example, the Ministry of Health funds a \"comprehensive crisis response management system\" for health professionals. 28 Such initiatives may be more effective in supporting staff than support from other health professionals 29 and can be targeted to those in most need via screening. 29, 30 Research limitations and strengths: This research served to document learning from an unusual, burdensome and serious infection outbreak. While participants included in the study were very well placed to provide insights into the outbreak inevitably, the research was conducted retrospectively, included subjective data, and involved a select group of participants whose perspectives may differ from the broader population of staff at the KAMC-R. While independent researchers undertook the interviews, responses may have been influenced by the \"official\" links between the project and the organization.

Semi-structured individual key informant qualitative interviews were undertaken with 9 senior leaders/decision: each 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Interviews were audio-recorded via a digital device with data transcribed immediately after data collection. Each interview/group lasted between 45-100 minutes; transcripts included non-verbal behavior. Prior to the interviews, institute revenant written documentation such as memorandums and committee meetings minutes was analyzed to direct the questions posed during the qualitative data collection (Table 1 , Appendix 1).\n\nQualitative data using process evaluation generates insights from key stakeholders on contributions to, and factors affecting key outcomes or processes, in organizations or interventions. 14, 15 Interview transcripts were analyzed manually to determine common themes using recognized principles of qualitative research. 16 For each interview, codes, sub-themes, and themes were then identified and subsequently refined to avoid redundancy and guarantee accuracy via a cyclical analytical process by two of the investigators. 16 The analysis moved back and forth between the interviews to ensure the finalized analysis was completed.\n\nRigor was maintained via a variety of recognized techniques. 16 Member checking of the qualitative data enhanced credibility and transferability: the results were presented to thirteen of the participants to ensure the findings were comprehensible and had resonance.

The major themes were 1) the high stress of the outbreak, 2) factors perceived to contribute to outbreak occurrence, 3) factors perceived to contribute to success of outbreak control, 4) factors inhibiting outbreak control, and 5) long-term institutional gains in response to the outbreak management (Table 2 ). In the results, themes are presented in bold and sub-themes are presented in italic bold typing.\n\nAll participants reported that the MERS-CoV outbreak was seen to constitute an episode of the most pressing and serious clinical significance to the organization and country. Consistently across interviews, it was described in such terms as a \"serious and straining situation\" and a \"situation that carries national and international significance\". 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   10 Frontline HCWs and senior decision-makers alike not only perceived this high gravity, but also experienced extremely high and diverse demands personally (\"A very demanding situation\"). Throughout the interviews, participants described the outbreak as being a sustained period of severe and sustained \"tension\", \"doubts\", \"challenges\", \"fear\", and \"anger\". Frequent visits, communications and collaborations from external regulatory agencies (such as the Saudi Ministry of Health, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention \"CDC\" and the World Health Organization \"WHO\"), were perceived to be useful but also compounded these stresses.\n\nThe perceived seriousness of the outbreak was reported to motivate staff to expend maximum effort to assist in its management. However, the high levels of stress were exacerbated by a pervading sense that controlling the outbreak involved \"hard and uncertain progress\". In the midst of the outbreak, both how it would progress and the future were seen to be very unclear.\n\nStrong consensus existed among participants that the organization's \"growing reliance on Emergency Department (ED) boarding\" was the main contributor to the outbreak. While some participants lamented that this build up was 'permitted' by senior decision-makers to occur over the long-term, other participants saw other upstream factors as also being influential, notably\n\npoor recognition of the importance of IPC principles across the organization was perceived to be compounded by the high demands placed on the ED by the large patient population. Other more upstream factors seen to contribute to the outbreak included: high trust patients had for the NGHA, the relative lack of primary care services, problems associated with patient flow across 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   11 the city, poor communication and teamwork between the city hospitals, and a lack of preemptive national planning to allow hospitals across different sectors to share the burden of the growing city population.\n\nThroughout this challenging situation, \"Teamwork and collaborative management\" were seen to be pivotal. There was a sense of close alignment between both decision-makers and frontline HCWs in management priorities. The approach of senior management to the situation was perceived by participants as being open, without blame or \"finger-pointing\". Indeed, managers were seen to have focused on empowering HCWs to work collaboratively to address the outbreak, involving staff in outbreak control and stimulating staff resilience and teamwork. In this way, the dominant culture was perceived by staff to be one of \"collective leadership practice\" (Table 1) 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\nFactors perceived to inhibit management of the outbreak were mostly related to initial poor management practices and the negative and compounding effects of media reporting and high stress. The organization was perceived to be acutely and chronically slow in responding to the outbreak. For example, organizational responses from management to the outbreak was perceived to be relatively slow compared to the rapid speed with which the infection spread.\n\nMoreover, despite references to high management transparency, some staff cited that \"poor staff orientation and management ambiguity\" contributed to staff being isolated and unclear about the decisions and measures being adopted by senior management to promote infection control.\n\nThis perceived poor communication created additional confusion that led to low coordination of IC instructions from both infection control and the nursing teams. Consequently, some health professionals, and other administrative and military staff, did not even appreciate the severity of the outbreak. Their consequent lack of attention to reducing the number of new patients and visitors entering the institution was seen to further elevate infection risk.\n\nAll participants referred to consistent and pervasive \"negative media commentary\" on the MERS-CoV outbreak occurring at the KAMC-R. This negative coverage contributed to significantly negative public perceptions of the Ministry, KAMC-R, its senior decision-makers, and the frontline HCWs. These negative commentaries were evident across local mass media (television, radio, and newspapers) and social media -particularly Twitter. The negative media reporting was cited as negatively impacting staff morale and affecting workers socially, psychologically, and mentally. During this challenging period, this compounded the negative Staff capacity to handle this challenging situation was further reduced given the perceived wide prevalence of high anxiety in staff due to the \"lack of appropriate staff counseling and mental health support\". The psychological demands on frontline health professionals escalated due to a range of coalescing factors; most notably the need to manage the outbreak simultaneously with the closure of most of the institution's units, combined with the negative media commentary. Almost all frontline participants strongly and repeatedly expressed the need for counseling and mental health support of employees.\n\nLearning from crises helps foster systems improvements. 17 However, learning from major events is challenging because each event is comparably rare and occurs in a distinctive context. As these events are also complex, 18 qualitative as well as quantitative research 10 is useful for generating insights and lessons to inform future outbreak control. 18 Useful lessons gleaned from this study of MERS-CoV crisis management (Table 3) concur with other research. It is not just the actions of HCWs and decision-makers that contributed to successful management, but also the mutual trust that accrues via the delegation of responsibilities, team management, coordination, tasks distribution, role clarification, and communication. 19, 20 This reflects the practice of collective leadership -defined as \"a dynamic leadership process in which defined leaders, or set of leaders, selectively utilize skills and expertise within a network, effectively distributing elements of the leadership role as the situation 21 This research corroborates other work identifying that a number of different strands of management contribute to success, particularly, the benefits of centralized yet inclusive meetings during which senior decision-makers and frontline HCWs share knowledge and learning 22 from different parts of the organization. 23 24 25 Other key lessons arising from this study arose from the weaknesses around the media management during the outbreak which in turn adversely affected reported staff morale and anxiety. 26 Such challenges are not unusual. 27 Large health institutions managing major crises should have a dedicated media center or representative capable of implementing a well-designed and coordinated media crisis plan to aid communication, address questions and proactively act to protect the reputation of the organization and its staff.\n\nMental health support to frontline HCWs was a major missing element in managing the MERS-CoV outbreak. Indeed, psychological and personal support and counseling for staff during emergency situations is recommended. [28] [29] [30] In Singapore for example, the Ministry of Health funds a \"comprehensive crisis response management system\" for health professionals. 28 Such initiatives may be more effective in supporting staff than support from other health professionals 29 and can be targeted to those in most need via screening. 29, 30 While the themes presented are not uncommon in organization studies of infection outbreaks, 31,32 these reflected our data and, as studies and systematic reviews indicate, concur with other accounts of major outbreaks such as ebola. [31] [32] [33] As such, our findings reiterate the imperative of addressing these transcending aspects across different types of infection outbreaks.\n\nThis research documented learning from an unusual, burdensome and serious infection outbreak and used methods recognized to be well suited to Unlike this previous work, the rigor of this study was increased via comprehensive details of the sample, participants, and context. 32 As with other studies, 32 participants included in the study were very well placed to provide insights into the outbreak but inevitably then the research was also conducted retrospectively, was based on subjective data, and involved a select group of participants whose perspectives may differ from the broader population. As with other studies, 32 while independent researchers undertook the interviews, responses may have been influenced by perceived \"official\" links between the project and the organization. Staff perspectives may have also been influenced by the time duration since the outbreak was curtailed (around eight months). We addressed these limitations through different data collection sources, member checking and data triangulation.\n\nManagement of the MERS-CoV outbreak at KAMC-R was widely recognized by staff as a serious outbreak of local and national significance. While the outbreak was controlled successfully in 6 weeks, progress in management was inhibited by a lack of institutional readiness to implement infection control measures and reduce patient flow, low staff morale and high anxiety. Effective management was promoted by greater involvement of all staff in sharing learning and knowledge of the outbreak, developing trust and team work, and fostering collective leadership. Future major infection control crises could be improved via measures to strengthen these areas, as well as better coordination of media management and pro-active staff counseling 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   18  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   19  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 In addition to the IDEP plan, which was established in 2013 with the detailed MERS-CoV flowcharts, a more strict and explicit triage process was established to ensure early identification of suspected MERS-CoV cases. This was added as the first layer of the patient triage process and implemented in the newly established drive-through system to the ER, and at the entrances of the ACC. Once a patient has entered the main ER, a second screening would take place to identify any possible cases that may have been missed by the first process. Two new teams were formed: CMT, a medical team managing all admitted patients with respiratory illness and CPRT, an outreach team responsible to ensure proper location, testing, transfer, discharge and consultation for suspected and confirmed MERS cases.\n\n\uf0b7 Two teams were formulated \uf0b7 Extensive IPC training program A two phase program aimed to train, assess and audit infection control practices of HCWs was implemented. Phase one was launched on September 28 th , 2015, and designed to ensure competence in basic IPC knowledge and practice. The second phase was designed to address sustainability of HCWs' certification and to ensure accountability. Full-time IPC observer(s) and trained DCNs were assigned for program monitoring.\n\nThis central committee was activated as part of the IDEP phase 2 process, and is chaired by the Executive Director, Medical Services. Members include: CEO, CMO, ED Infection Control department, and heads of most concerned medical, media, security, logistics and nursing departments. The committee charges have allowed the meeting team to take major decisions and implement them immediately bypassing the usual routine hierarchy process. ED and patient triaging transformation ED staff and the military police have controlled all ED entrances, and access was restricted to ED employees. The MERS-CoV plan was implemented aiming to avoid any future occurrences of any infectious diseases. Major changes in the ED workflow were implemented. A drive-through was established at the entrance of the ED with 3 lanes and 4 windows per lane, manned by trained unit assistants to implement the initial triage process. Second, was the establishment of an 18 respiratoryisolation room facility for which patients with a suspected respiratory illness would be isolated and evaluated. Third, was a reducation in patient boarding time.\n\nIM Department and the Bed Coordination Unit have facilitated patient admissions. The Bed Coordination unit was turned into a department chaired by a senior IM physician. A new IM division was established and staffed to manage all general IM cases and shorten patient boarding time in the ED.\n\nEstablished in response to almost complete closure of the institution, this center has served to respond to calls from patients and their families, reschedule/direct patients' appointments at the ACC, reschedule/direct surgeries and admissions in all clinical departments. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47 o n l y 23 \"When we start to see the CEO doing round in the ED, almost every day\u2026.and so we can contact him. So you can talk with him. So you can address the problem directly. So he is doing his rounds almost on a daily basis\u2026And he meets with us or the heads of the units and ask, \"so, how can I help you in this unit?\" \"There was leadership\u2026the commitment came out. That is the first time that we saw each other twice daily. We were spending time together more than we spend with our families. So every day, I will see Doctor ___ [Leader] , every day I will see Doctor ____ [Leader] . So we were always there\u2026.. So there was -there was a lot of collegiality that -that was really built. Ah, storming led to performing. Meaning that: okay, yes, we had differences of opinions, but at the end of the day, we had to come up with decisions .\u2026.. \" \"There was flatness (to) the decision tree -it did not really need a committee to approve it. It used to be one meeting, to two meetings -we agree on something and it goes. Or we disagree and somebody makes the call. And so, so the decision-making process was -was quick.\" Inadequate facility readiness to implement IPC guidelines, and poor IC practices may lead to an outbreak situation. Strict implementation and monitoring are mandatory regardless of the volume of work.\n\n2\n\nPatient boarding in ED should follow the internationally accepted figures regardless of the number boarded.\n\n3\n\nCollective leadership is the management method of choice when dealing with a multidimensional leadership crisis.\n\nIn national level crisis management, media center and a pre-existing media disaster plan are mandatory to reduce HCW anxiety and improve trust in the institution and its staff.\n\nHCW mental health care and anxiety relief are important factors to increase resilience and cooperation within the workforce. \n\nA checklist of items that should be included in reports of qualitative research.
