An IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay was performed as follows. A 96-well plate containing Immobilon-P membrane (MSIPS4510; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was incubated with monoclonal antimonkey IFN-\u03b3 (CT610-10; U-Cytech, Utrecht, the Netherlands) at 4\u00b0C overnight and blocked with RPMI medium 1640 (no. 11875-093; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 0.05 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 2 mmol/L Lglutamine, 10 mmol/L HEPES, and 10% fetal bovine serum (no. SH30070; HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h.\n\nPBMCs were plated at a density of 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well. Recombinant MERS-CoV spike protein (no. 40069-V08B; Sino Biologic Inc., North Wales, PA, USA) and SARS-CoV spike S1 subunit (no. 40150-V08B1; Sino Biologic Inc.) were added to the wells at a final concentration of 10 \uf06dg/mL to stimulate PBMCs. Phosphatebuffered saline was used for mock stimulation. At 24-h poststimulation, IFN-\u03b3 was detected by using biotinylated anti-monkey IFN-\u03b3 (CT610-10; U-Cytech), and color was developed by using nitro-blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3'indolyphosphate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Spots were counted by using an ELISPOT reader (Bioreader 4000; BIOSYS, Germany), and the results were reported as number of spot-forming cells/million PBMCs.\n\nSerum samples were heat-inactivated (56\u00b0C for 30 min) and mixed with equal volumes of two hundred 50% tissue cultures infectious doses of MERS-CoV. After 1 luciferase activity was measured by using a Microbeta Luminometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The highest serum dilution giving 90% reduction of luciferase activity was used as the antibody titer (2).\n\nA commercially available (EUROIMMUN AG, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) MERS CoV S1 ELISA was used. In brief, serum dilutions, a calibrator, and controls were added to MERS CoV-coated plates and incubated for 30 min. Plates were washed 3 times and peroxidase labeled anti-human IgG was added and incubated for 30 min.\n\nSubstrate solution was added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature.\n\nReactions were stopped, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a reference wave length of 650 nm. The ratio between the extinction values of control/sample and calibrator was calculated. A ratio >0.8 was considered a positive result (3).\n\nEqual volumes of each serum dilution and 40-60 PFU of MERS CoV/24-well plate were mixed and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. After incubation, virus/serum mixture was added to Vero cell monolayers in a 24-well format in duplicate. Plates were incubated for 1 h to enable absorption before overlaying with agarose. After 3 days, cells were fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde and stained. Titers are expressed as serum dilutions resulting in plaque inhibition >90%. "}
