{"title": "", "body": "We selected a sample taken from a Michigan exhibition pig with clinical respiratory disease typical for this outbreak and negative for IAV and PRRSV for de novo sequencing to identify potential pathogens within the specimen. We prepared an RNA library using Ion Total RNA-Seq Kit version 2 (ThermoFisher) according to manufacturer instructions. We amplified We calculated risk ratio (RR) for individual samples and individual fairs, and constructed 95% CIs. We calculated p values using Fischer's exact probability test (2) .\n\nWe selected 1 sample per fair where PHEV was detected for sequencing on the basis of the lowest PHEV rRT-PCR cycle threshold value at each fair (n = 14). We applied a sequenceindependent, single-primer amplification method to amplify the genome of PHEV from extracted RNA. We used the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) to prepare a next-generation sequencing library followed by sequencing on MiSeq. We used both Ray and SPAdes softwares for de novo assemble of 9 PHEV strains. We closed small sequencing gaps by using a Sanger sequencing method, and reamplified 2 strains (15SW0331 and 15SW0582) with a relatively smaller percentage of genome coverage (54% and 80%, respectively) by using 21 pairs of PHEV-specific primers followed by sequencing on MiSeq. We aligned and compared sequences using MUSCLE (MEGA Software version 6.06; www.megasoftware.net). We confirmed all insertions and deletions by Sanger sequencing. We performed phylogenetic comparison of the sequenced PHEV strains to reference coronavirus Page 3 of 10 sequences obtained from GenBank by complete sequence, nonstructural 2 (NS2) gene, spike gene, and NS4.9 gene. We constructed dendrograms using the neighbor-joining method with the MEGA software package. We performed bootstrap resampling (1,000 replications), and bootstrap values are indicated for each node.\n\nOur initial screening results determined that all samples were negative for IAV. All sequence gaps were closed with specific primers.\n\nWe deposited sequence data for complete and partial genomes in GenBank; previously, only 1 complete genome (PHEV-VW572) had been available in the database (Technical Appendix Figure 1 ). Sequence mapping analysis of raw reads showed that over 50% genome Four strains (15SW0331, 15SW0582, 15SW1362, and 15SW1765) form genotype 1, 5 strains (15SW1209, 15SW1582, 15SW1655, 15SW1727, and 15SW1785) form genotype 2, and 1 strain (15SW25049) alone or together with VW572 or IAF-404 form genotype 3. The strain 15SW25049 (genotype 3) is more closely related to genotype 1 in the phylogenetic trees of the complete genome and NS2 gene, whereas it is more closely related to genotype 2 in the spike gene and NS4.9 gene trees. All 10 strains are distantly related to VW572, except in the NS2 gene tree, where VW572 is closely related to 15SW25049.\n\nOverall, genomic and phylogenetic characterization demonstrated that the 10 PHEV strains are novel PHEV variants. Although deletions in the NS2 and NS4.9 genes was previously Page 5 of 10 reported in VW572, all 10 US PHEV strains reported here possess novel deletion patterns in both these genes; we also observed new deletions in ORF1b, spike gene, and 3\u2032 UTR."}
