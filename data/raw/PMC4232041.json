{"title": "Identification of novel multitargeted PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 pan agonists by core hopping of rosiglitazone", "body": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear ligand-activated transcription factors and include three subtypes, namely PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, and PPAR\u03b4.1\u20133 The drugs targeting PPARs mainly include: 1) PPAR\u03b3 agonists4 such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, which are used as antidiabetic drugs and also possess anti-inflammatory or antineoplastic activities,5,6 and 2) PPAR\u03b1 agonists such as fenofibrate and bezafibrate, which are used as antilipemic drugs (Figure 1).7,8 Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone have shown side effects in clinical use, such as liver function abnormity, edema, and weight gain.9 Especially in 2007, Nissen and Wolski10 reported the cardiac safety of rosiglitazone, which showed that singly selective agonism of PPAR\u03b3 not only enhanced insulin sensitivity and the therapeutic effect of insulin metabolism but also caused edema, weight gain, and the potential risk of heart failure.\n\nIn recent years, some novel PPARs concepts appeared in the antidiabetic drug research area, such as multitargeted cooperative PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 dual agonists and PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 pan agonists. These multitargeted agonists could cooperatively improve glucose and lipid metabolism. They could not only effectively control blood sugar but also reduce the content of triglyceride, free fatty acid, and low-density lipoprotein, as well as increase high-density lipoprotein concentration, thus having a preventive effect on cardiovascular complications of type 2 diabetes patients. Some of these multitargeted PPARs agonists have entered clinical trials and represent promising PPARs drug research.11\u201313\n\nThe pharmacophore of PPARs agonists consists of the polar head, linker, and hydrophobic tail. The polar head of PPARs agonists could form a hydrogen bond with Tyr residue at the AF-2 region, producing a transactivation effect. The hydrophobic tail of PPARs agonists could bind to the residues at the active site entrance, affecting subtype selectivity. This indicates that by modification of the polar head and hydrophobic tail, various pharmacological effects can be produced, such as PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 dual agonistic activity and PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 pan agonistic activity.\n\nIn our previous research, using GW409544 as the starting point, by means of \u201ccore hopping\u201d and \u201cglide docking\u201d techniques, a novel class of PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 dual agonists was discovered.14 In this paper, starting from rosiglitazone as the lead compound, using a core hopping approach, the polar head, linker, and hydrophobic tail of rosiglitazone were modified to produce various compounds. These compounds were then screened by docking and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) prediction to discover some excellent PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 pan agonists. Molecular dynamics simulations of the representative Cpd#1 with PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 were also done to study the binding details (Figure 2).\n\nThe crystal structures of PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, and PPAR\u03b4 receptors were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with PDB identification numbers 1I7G, 2PRG, and 2ZNP, respectively.15\u201317 The preparation of these receptors was performed on the Protein Preparation Wizard embedded in Schrodinger 2009. The process of preparing receptors included assigning bond orders, adding hydrogen, treating metals, treating disulfides, deleting waters, alleviating potential steric clashes, adjusting formal charges, minimizing proteins with the OPLS (Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulation) 2005 force field,18 and refining the protein by limiting value of root mean square deviation (RMSD) to 0.50 \u00c5 as the constraint. Then, the original ligand was centered and redocked into the binding site to generate a docking box for molecular docking.\n\nThe Core Hopping module in Schrodinger 2009 software was used to modify the polar head, linker, and hydrophobic tail of rosiglitazone (Figure 2).19 Core hopping is a docking algorithm that has the functions of fragment-based replacing and molecular docking.20\u201322 The first step of core hopping was to define the points at which the cores were attached to the scaffold. It was performed in the Define Combinations Step from the Combinatorial Screening panel. The second step was to define \u201cthe receptor grid file\u201d, which was done in the Receptor Preparation panel. The third step was to prepare the cores attached to the scaffold using fragment database derived from ZINC.23,24 The fourth step was to align and dock the entire molecular structure built up by the core and scaffold. The cores were sorted and filtered by goodness of alignment and then redocked into the receptor after attaching the scaffold, followed by using the docking scores to sort the final molecules.25\u201327 The original ligand AZ242, rosiglitazone, and TIPP204 were used as positive control compounds.\n\nThe ADMET module of Discovery Studio 3.1 was used to predict pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the compounds (Figure 2). Taking rosiglitazone as control, the compounds as a mol2 file were imported into the ADMET Descriptors module and the Toxicity Prediction Extensible and Toxicity Prediction TOPKAT modules, respectively, obtaining pharmacokinetics and toxicity parameters.\n\nIn order to study the binding stability of compounds with PPARs active site, the 10ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the open GROMACS 4.0 package for Linux (Figure 2).28 Before the simulations, the coordinate file and topology file were prepared29 and the water box was constructed and filled with simple point charge water solution, which was then neutralized by sodium ions or chloride ions.30,31 The 1,000-step energy minimization of the system was performed using the steepest descending method. The NVT (constant number, volume and temperature) ensembles were used with temperature being maintained at 300 K. The cutoff radius of van der Waals interaction was 1.4 nm, and particle mesh Ewald algorithm was used for the electrostatic interaction.32,33 The Linear Constraint Solver algorithm was used for all of the bond restriction.34\u201336\n\nThe X-ray crystallography studies showed that the ligand binding domain of the PPARs was composed of 12\u03b1-helix and 4 antiparalleled \u03b2-sheet. The three subtypes of PPARs were 60%\u201370% sequence similarities with RMSD between C\u03b1 atoms <1 \u00c5. In addition, the ligand binding domain of the PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 formed a Y-shaped hydrophobic pocket with a volume of about 1,300 \u00c53. The AF-2 region of H12 helix played an important role in the process of the activation of PPARs. As for PPAR\u03b4, the AF-2 region was significantly narrower, which was not suitable for binding ligands with a larger polar head.37\n\nA total of 42,000 compounds were obtained by core hopping of rosiglitazone. These compounds were docked into PPAR\u03b1 (pdb 1I7G), PPAR\u03b3 (pdb 2PRG), and PPAR\u03b4 (pdb 2ZNP), respectively, screening out 23 compounds with higher docking scores and better binding poses than the original ligands. Further ADMET prediction studies produced the top eight compounds (Table 1). The docking scores of these compounds with PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 were higher than the original ligand AZ242 and rosiglitazone, respectively. The docking scores of these compounds with PPAR\u03b4 were somewhat lower than the original ligand TIPP204. In addition, the hydrogen bond distances between compounds and PPARs were <3.20 \u00c5,38,39 and the values were equal to the original ligand.\n\nThe docking mode of the representative Cpd#1 with the active site of PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 receptors is shown in Figure 3. The carboxyl acidic head of Cpd#1 formed hydrogen bonds with the key residues of PPAR\u03b1 (Ser280, Tyr314, Tyr464, and His440), PPAR\u03b3 (Ser289, His323, Tyr473, and His449), and PPAR\u03b4 (His323, His449, and Tyr473) receptors, respectively. The aromatic hydrophobic tail and the linker of Cpd#1 bound to PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 with similar conformations to the original ligand AZ242, rosiglitazone, and TIPP204, respectively.\n\nThe development of the PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 dual agonist muraglitazar has been discontinued during clinical trials because of danger and mortality rate of cardiovascular events.40 Thus, the prediction of drug ADME/Tox was crucial and could reduce the risk of the drug development. The pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the top eight compounds were predicted using the ADMET module of Discovery Studio 3.1. The molecular weight (MW), octanol\u2013water partition coefficient (AlogP98), polar surface area (PSA-2D), aqueous solubility (QplogS), number of hydrogen bond acceptors (nON), number of hydrogen bond donors (nOHNH), and mutagenicity of rosiglitazone analogues are listed in Table 2, respectively. These compounds accorded with Lipinski\u2019s rule of five (Mol_MW<500, 0.4<AlogP98<5.6, nOHNH<5, nON<10, 7<PSA-2D<200, 0.5<QplogS<6.5),41,42 and the values were equal to the positive control AZ242, rosiglitazone, and TIPP204. The probabilities of mutagenicity of these compounds were also lower than for rosiglitazone.\n\nIn order to study the dynamics behaviors and the binding stability of the PPARs\u2013Cpd#1 complex, the 10ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed on PPARs\u2013apo, PPARs\u2013original ligand complex, and PPARs\u2013Cpd#1 complex.\n\nThe RMSD versus the simulation time was considered as a significant criterion to evaluate the stability of dynamic behavior. The final RMSD values for all the simulation systems were <0.8 nm (Figure 4). After 3ns, the RMSD values for Cpd#1\u2013PPARs system (red) was the lowest one among these three simulation trajectories.\n\nIn order to study the dynamic details of key residues interacted with the ligand, the root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of all the side chain residues were obtained. The RMSF curve of PPARs\u2013Cpd#1 complex was similar to that of PPARs\u2013original ligand complex (Figure 4). At the key residues of PPAR\u03b1 such as Ser280 (the pink area), Tyr314 (the conch area), Tyr464 (the cyan area), and His440 (the coral area), the RMSF values of the PPAR\u03b1\u2013Cpd#1 complex were somewhat lower than those of the PPAR\u03b1\u2013original ligand complex and PPAR\u03b1\u2013apo form. As for PPAR\u03b3/\u03b4, similar circumstances existed just as with PPAR\u03b1. These molecular dynamics simulation trajectories indicated that PPARs became more stable after binding Cpd#1.\n\nIn this study, rosiglitazone was modified by core hopping strategy to produce various analogues. Using docking and ADMET prediction technique, eight novel compounds were identified as multitargeted PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 pan agonists with excellent pharmacokinetic properties. Molecular dynamics simulations of the representative Cpd#1 showed that Cpd#1 bound steadily to PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 active site and restricted the target movement. These compounds have not been reported in the literature and could act as novel PPARs multitargeted agonists for antidiabetic drug research."}
