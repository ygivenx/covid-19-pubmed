{"title": "Supporting Information", "body": "from 0.1 to 20 \u03bcM. All reactions were performed in triplicate and in parallel. The change in FP was measured in the linear range over a period of 0-7 min, with readings recorded every 5 s. The FP measurements were plotted over time, and initial velocities of ISG15-TAMRA cleavage were determined. Michaelis-Menten parameters were calculated using Prism 6 GraphPad Software.\n\nproISG15 Cleavage Assays. The proforms of ISG15 full-length or the CTD (79-165) were used in all cleavage assays. The concentration of proISG15 was held constant at 10 \u03bcM and incubated at 37\u00b0C in all cleavage assays. Reactions were quenched through the addition of lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer at the indicated time points. Samples were resolved on 10-20% Tricine gels (Invitrogen) and stained with Instant Blue SafeStain (Expedeon).\n\nIntact MS. Cleavage assays were performed similarly to the proISG15 cleavage assays described above. In ubiquitin (1-76 amino acids), NEDD8 (1-76 amino acids), and SUMO1 (1-97 amino acids) cleavage assays, the concentration of Lb pro was increased to 1 \u03bcM to promote cleavage of these nonpreferred substrates. Unless stated otherwise, reactions were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and quenched with 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Substrates were diluted to 1 pmol/\u03bcL before intact MS analysis. Samples were injected at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcL/min and ionized using a heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) source before being analyzed by an Orbitrap mass analyzer (Q Exactive). Ionization, data collection, and deconvolution of raw files were performed according to ref. 8 .\n\nISG15 Suicide Probe Assays. ISG15 probe assays were performed with 20 or 40 \u03bcM ISG15 probes with 10 \u03bcM Lb pro or vOTU at 37\u00b0C in probe assay buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM DTT). The reactions were quenched in LDS sample buffer at the specified time points and resolved on a 4-12% Bis-Tris gel before being visualized with Instant Blue SafeStain (Expedeon).\n\nPreparation of Lb pro ISG15 Complex for Crystallization. For crystallography, 45 \u03bcM Lb pro was mixed with 175 \u03bcM CTD-ISG15-\u0394C probe in a total volume of 1 mL. The reaction was incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. Immediately afterward, the reaction was placed on ice. The resulting complex was purified by strong anion chromatography (Resource Q) at pH 8.0 using a linear salt gradient (0-500 mM NaCl). The reacted complex was pooled and dialyzed into 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol. After dialysis, the complex was concentrated to 4 mg/mL using a Vivaspin 500 3K MWCO concentrator and used for crystallization screening. The purity of the complex was assessed by a Coomassie-stained SDS/PAGE gel and estimated to be >95% pure.\n\nCrystallization. Initial hits were obtained from a commercial screen (Hampton Research) in a sitting drop vapor diffusion format. Lb pro \u223cISG15-\u0394C complex was set up at a 1:1 protein:precipitant ratio. Crystals grew in 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M Na citrate pH 5.6, and 0.2 M K/Na tartrate. Crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor containing 25% glycerol.\n\nData Collection, Structural Determination, and Refinement. Data were collected at the Diamond Light Source beamline I-04 at a wavelength of 0.92819 \u00c5 with a PILATUS 6M-F detector. Integration of images was performed using MOSFLM (9) and scaled using Aimless (10) . The structure was solved by molecular replacement in Phaser (11) using the apo Lb pro [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 1qol (1)] and ISG15 CTD [PDB ID code 3phx (6)] structures. Model building and refinement were performed using COOT (12) and PHENIX (13) . Table S1 shows statistics. Structural figures were created using PyMol (https:// pymol.org/2/). The proorigami server (14) was used to build the topology diagram.\n\nIn Vitro Self-Processing Assays. Lb pro intramolecular cleavage was monitored by in vitro translation assays (15) . To this end, the PCITE-1d plasmid containing the sequence for the Lb pro VP4/ VP2 or Lb pro mutants (L92A, P99A, L102A) was linearized with SalI followed by in vitro transcription (16) . Template DNA was digested with DNase, and RNA was purified by phenolchloroform extraction. Then, rabbit reticulocyte lysates were programmed with in vitro-transcribed RNA of the precursor protein Lb pro VP4/VP2 in the presence of [ 35 S]methionine (16) , and aliquots were removed at the specified times. The reaction was stopped in stop solution [61% (vol/vol) 2\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer, 0.6 mM methionine-cysteine mix, 37% (vol/vol) dH2O]. Radiolabeled proteins were detected by analysis on a 17.5% SDS/PAGE gel followed by autoradiography. Gels were incubated twice with 20 mL enhancing solution containing 1 M sodium salicylate and 45% methanol for 15 min before being dried on Whatman paper using an SAVANT slab gel drier and exposed to a CL-X Posure film (Thermo Scientific) for 18 h at \u221280\u00b0C. Subsequently, the film was thawed and developed using an AGFA Curix660. Intermolecular cleavage of endogenous eIF4G was monitored by analyzing 10 \u03bcL of translation mix on a 6% SDS/PAGE gel and subsequent Western blotting with anti-eIF4GI antibody (a gift from Robert Rhoads, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA).\n\nCell Culture, Transfections, and Incubation with Lb pro . HeLa cells obtained from ATCC were grown to 80% confluency before transfection with the indicated plasmids as previously described (17) . Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 4 M urea, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM chloroacetamide, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mM sucrose, 5% glycerol). Cells were briefly sonicated to shear DNA and further supplement lysis. Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 21,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Unreacted chloroacetamide was quenched with 10 mM DTT to prevent alkylation of the Lb pro active site cysteine. Total protein was quantified using Bradford methods. Before incubation with Lb pro , the concentration of urea was diluted to 1 M; 100 \u03bcL of 5 mg/mL total protein was incubated with 2 \u03bcM Lb pro for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Reactions were quenched with LDS sample buffer at the indicated time points. Samples were resolved on a 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) before being transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by Western blotting. Anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich, M2), anti-ISG15 (Sigma-Aldrich, SAB1408653), antiubiquitin (Millipore, 07-375), and anti-GlyGly (Lucerna Inc., GX41) primary antibodies were used in Western blots. All Western blots, unless stated otherwise, were incubated for 16 h at a 1:1,000 primary antibody dilution in phosphate buffered saline with Tween 20 (PBS-T) + 5% BSA. The primary antibody dilution for anti-FLAG Western blots was 1:10,000. After primary antibody incubation, Western blots were incubated at a 1:5,000 secondary antibody dilution overnight in PBS-T + 5% milk prior to being visualized by chemiluminescence. All antibody incubation steps were performed at 4\u00b0C.\n\nRecombinant Mengovirus Infection Assays. HeLa-R19 cells were cultured in DMEM (Lonza) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FCS. Recombinant viruses were derived from the pM16.1-VFETQG-Zn infectious clone as described previously (18) . In short, genes of interest were inserted between the XhoI/NotI restriction sites of the pM16.1-VFETQG-Zn infectious clone. Viruses were recovered by transfection of runoff RNA transcripts into BHK-21 cells. On total cytopathic effect, cells were subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles, the cell debris was pelleted at 4,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min, and the virus was concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion at 140,000 \u00d7 g for 16 h in an SW32Ti rotor. HeLa R19 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes (2.0 \u00d7 10 6 cells per dish). On the next day, cells were infected (multiplicity of infection = 10) with the indicated viruses. At 2, 4, 6, or 8 h postinfection, cells were released using trypsin, washed once in PBS, and lysed in 100 \u03bcL lysis buffer [100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mix (Roche)]. Postnuclear lysate was obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. The amount of total protein in the lysates was determined using BCA assay (ThermoFisher).\n\nFMDV Infection Assays. BHK-21 cells grown to 90% confluency in 24-well plates were transfected with FLAG-ISG15 and the ISG15 machinery (UBE1L, UBE2L6, and HERC5) and grown overnight. Transfected cells were then infected with FMDV O1Kaufbeuren diluted in virus growth medium (BHK cell culture medium containing 1% FBS). After 1 h, the FMDV inoculum was removed, the cells were washed once with viral growth medium, and then, they were incubated in virus growth medium for the remainder of the infection. At 1-h intervals postinfection (up to 5 h), duplicate wells were washed once with PBS, and the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% IGEPAL, 120 mM NaCl). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and total protein was quantified using BCA assay (ThermoFisher). Equal quantities of the lysates (12 \u03bcg) were loaded onto 10% acrylamide gels and subjected to SDS/PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blotted with either FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich) or GlyGly (Lucerna Inc.) primary antibodies and mouse secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer (5% milk and 0.1% Tween in PBS). Blots were visualized by chemiluminescence. "}
