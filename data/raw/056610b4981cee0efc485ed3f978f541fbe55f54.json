{"title": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome", "body": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a form of noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, due to alveolar injury secondary to an infl ammatory process, that can be either pulmonary or systemic in origin. This syndrome presents as acute hypoxaemia with bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates on chest imaging, which are not wholly due to heart failure. As a syndrome, it is characterised by the presence of several criteria. Since the original description by Ashbaugh and colleagues in 1967, 1 four defi nitions have been used to determine the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (table) . [2] [3] [4] [5] The American European Consensus Conference defi nition, 3 which was published in 1994, was the fi rst agreed and widely used defi nition. However, it had numerous limitations across all four diagnostic criteria (panel), and, as a result, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine engaged in a consensus process to generate an improved defi nition for acute respiratory distress syndrome. The Berlin defi nition, 5 which was published in 2012, was validated in over 4000 patients' data: on the basis of hypoxaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome is classifi ed as mild (ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO 2 /FiO 2 ] of 200-\u2264300 mm Hg), moderate (PaO 2 /FiO 2 100-\u2264200 mm Hg), or severe (PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264100 mm Hg). The most important updates to the defi nition are the stipulation of a minimum positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H 2 O, (PEEP can increase oxygenation, which is a key criterion of the syndrome-this update was to establish a minimum standard for mechanical ventilation); the acknowledgment that acute respiratory distress syndrome can be diagnosed in the presence of cardiac failure; a requirement for new respiratory failure, or worsening of chronic respiratory disease, within 7 days; and the inclusion of chest CT as an alternative form of imaging for the demonstration of lung infi ltrates.\n\nThe landmark ARMA study, 28 which was published in 2000, demonstrated the benefi ts of a low-tidal-volume, low-airway-pressure ventilatory strategy in acute respiratory distress syndrome and marked the establishment of lung protective ventilation as the standard of care. Despite this advance, the syndrome remains highly prevalent, with, in the lung-protective era, estimated incidences per 100 000 patients per year of 34 in the USA 29 and approximately fi ve to seven in Europe. [30] [31] [32] Its epidemiology is probably under-reported in less developed health-care systems, in which, as a result of resource limitations, few patients meet the current defi nition for diagnosis, despite 4% of all hospital admissions having a clinical state similar to that of acute respiratory distress syndrome. 33 7% of patients in the intensive-care unit (ICU), and 16% of those receiving mechanical ventilation, have acute respiratory distress syndrome. 34 Based on control group survival in randomised controlled trials [35] [36] [37] [38] published in the past 3 years, 28 day mortality is approximately 20-40%. A further 15-20% of patients will die by 12 months, largely because of comorbidities rather than residual eff ects of acute respiratory distress syndrome. 39 The LUNGSAFE study 40 showed that the syndrome remains common and has a mortality of approximately 40%, and emphasised the global burden. Although, in general, ICU survivors have no reduction in health-related quality of life, full recovery is often limited in those who had acute respiratory distress syndrome. Many have muscle wasting, limiting weakness, and neuropsychiatric illness, including cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. [41] [42] [43] 6 years after ICU discharge, just over 50% have returned to work. 44 Despite these extrapulmonary defi cits, respiratory function returns close to normal. 42 \n\nThe development of acute respiratory distress syndrome has been described in the setting of numerous illnesses and injuries, which are broadly classed as being pulmonary or systemic in origin. Pneumonia is the most common risk factor for the development of the syndrome, and, along with aspiration, has the highest associated mortality; trauma-related illness has the lowest. 29 Inappropriately administered mechanical ventilation is an important contributor to both the development and worsening of acute respiratory distress syndrome. 28, 45 This ventilator-induced lung injury can occur by several mechanisms, including excessive lung stretch (volutrauma) 46 or pressure (barotrauma), repetitive alveolar opening and closing, which causes a shearing injury (atelectrauma), and potential oxygen toxicity. 47 These processes also drive excessive systemic infl ammation, with the ability to induce non-pulmonary organ failure (biotrauma). In a randomised controlled trial 45 of 150 critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, ventilation with 10 mL rather than 6 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight was associated with a fi ve-times increase in the odds of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. This fi nding has been substantiated in a further randomised controlled trial 48 in 400 patients at risk of pulmonary complications undergoing general anaesthesia for major abdominal surgery. A non-lungprotective ventilatory strategy of 10-12 mL/kg tidal volume ventilation with no PEEP was compared with lungprotective ventilation of 6-8 mL/kg tidal volume with PEEP of 6-8 cm H 2 O plus a recruitment manoeuvre every 30 min. The lung-protective group had fewer major complications (10\u00b75% vs 27\u00b75%; relative risk [RR] 0\u00b740, 95% CI 0\u00b724 to 0\u00b768; p=0\u00b7001), required less respiratory support by day 7 (5% vs 17%; 0\u00b729, 0\u00b714 to 0\u00b761; p=0\u00b7001), and had a shorter hospital stay (11 vs 13 days; diff erence -2\u00b745 days, -4\u00b717 to -0\u00b772; p=0\u00b7006).\n\nThe search for potential genes conferring susceptibility to the development of, or that alter the outcome from, acute respiratory distress syndrome is methodologically complex. Genotype, phenotype, race, environment, injury, and therapy interact in variable and uncertain ways to contribute to clinical outcomes. More than 40 candidate genes associated with the development or outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome have been identifi ed, although these investigations have either largely not been suffi ciently robust to provide clear answers, or have yet to be replicated. 49 Data in parentheses in the Murray column are scores; the total number of points scored is divided by the number of categories included, giving the Murray lung injury score. A score of 0 signifi es no lung injury is present, a score of 0\u00b71-2\u00b75 signifi es mild to moderate lung injury, and a score greater than 2\u00b75 signifi es severe lung injury. AECC=American European Consensus Conference. PaO 2 =partial pressure of arterial oxygen. FiO 2 =fraction of inspired oxygen. PEEP=positive end-expiratory pressure. 50 The search for a genetic susceptibility to either the onset, or worsening, of the syndrome might prove diffi cult until issues with the specifi city of the defi nition of acute respiratory distress syndrome and improved phenotyping of patients are addressed. However, a gene with a clearer association with acute respiratory distress syndrome is ACE. This association came to prominence during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, when the ACE2 protein, which contributes to the regulation of pulmonary vascular permeability, was identifi ed as the receptor for the novel coronavirus that caused SARS. 51\n\nAfter the onset of the primary illness, the infl ammatory alveolar injury occurring has been described in terms of three sequential phases (fi gure 1), which overlap substantially. 26 The process begins with the exudative phase and immune-cell-mediated destruction of the barriers of the alveolar epithelial-inter stitial-endothelial complex, allowing plasma, plasma proteins, and cellular content to successively fl ood the interstitium and airspace. Classically, acute respiratory distress syndrome is recognised to be a neutrophil-driven disease; however, experimental data have shown that alveolar neutrophilia can occur without increased alveolar permeability. 52 Additionally, the involvement of cells from the innate (including macrophages 53 and platelets 54 ) and adaptive immune systems in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome is increasingly recognised. 55 Further neutrophils and macrophages are recruited to this infl ammatory focus, propagating the initial insult. The infl ammatory exudate produced physically interacts with surfactant, initially causing dysfunction followed by, as the epithelial injury progresses, loss of surfactant production, which impedes alveolar patency. The loss of epithelial ion channels impairs the generation of osmotic forces required to return oedema fl uid to the interstitium. These injuries, plus the development of hyaline membranes and decreased pulmonary compliance, result in disrupted gaseous diff usion. Alveolar vascular damage also occurs, with increased permeability coexisting with altered vasomotor tone (both vaso con striction and vasodilation) and microthrombi. Pulmonary hypertension results, increasing right ventricular afterload. This right ventricular dysfunction can be further exacerbated by mechanical ventilation and fl uid overload. This combination of epithelial and endothelial damage results in worsening ventilationperfusion mismatch and loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasocon striction, which leads to refractory hypoxia. Acute lung injury term \u2022 AECC: inconsistency with the use of the term acute lung injury, which has been used to refer to either patients with mild hypoxaemia only (PaO 2 >200 mm Hg) or as an umbrella term for all those meeting the defi nition of acute respiratory distress syndrome, 5 including moderate and severe hypoxaemia\n\n\u2022 Both: many clinicians fail to recognise acute respiratory distress syndrome 6\n\nAECC=American European Consensus Conference. PEEP=positive end-expiratory pressure. PaO 2 =partial pressure of arterial oxygen. FiO 2 =fraction of inspired oxygen.\n\nThe proliferative phase marks attempts at recovery, with restoration of the type II alveolar cell population, and subsequent diff erentiation into type I alveolar cells. Regeneration of a functioning epithelial layer permits the clearance of exudative fl uid into the interstitium, and remaining debris is cleared by infl ammatory cells. Vasomotor tone begins to return to normal, microthrombi are cleared, and pulmonary hypertension lessens. As reparation continues, shunt reduces, leading to improved oxygenation that is followed, often more slowly, by recovering pulmonary compliance. The third fi brotic phase develops inconsistently, and comprises failure of removal of alveolar collagen, which is laid down early in the injury process, combined with the development of cystic changes, limiting functional recovery. Diff use alveolar damage is thought to be the pathognomonic pathological fi nding of acute respiratory distress syndrome, 5 is defi ned by the presence of hyaline membranes, and can be detected either by lung biopsy or at autopsy. However, it is not specifi c and can also occur in the absence of the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome. 14 Many patents who fulfi l the diagnostic criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome do not have diff use alveolar damage. 13 Clinical patterns have been recognised in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome-eg, those with a pulmonary cause have more consolidation and less alveolar collapse and interstitial oedema than do those with non-pulmonary causes. 56 Sub phenotypes have been described, and are classifi ed by clinical and biological characteristics with diff ering clinical outcomes and response to treatment. 57, 58 A hyperinfl ammatory phenotype is associated with worse metabolic acidosis, higher vasopressor requirements, increased mortality, and a better response to higher PEEP. Subphenotypes will provide further mechanistic insight to the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is likely to inform the development of personalised therapies.\n\nThe Berlin defi nition for acute respiratory distress syndrome is an evolution of the American European Consensus Conference defi nition (table), which was recognised to have numerous fl aws. The revised defi nition, although improved, still has limitations. Several investigational modalities are potentially helpful in monitoring the clinical course (fi gure 2). Sequential imaging via both chest radiography and CT (fi gure 3) provides qualitative measures of disease evolution, and CT also provides specifi c quantitative measures of oedema, aeration, and recruitability. Extravascular lung water, which refl ects the degree of pulmonary oedema, can be measured with a PiCCO [Pulse Contour Cardiac Output] monitor (Pulsion Medical Systems, Feldkirchen, Germany) and is associated with mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. 60, 61 Similarly, lung ultra sonography (fi gure 3) can be used to estimate extravascular lung water, 62, 63 and to allow diff erentiation of the syndrome from cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. 64 Pulmonary wedge 65 responsive ness and are unlikely to off er benefi t in routine management (neither off ers any benefi t over the other). 67 The PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio is a measure of oxygenation that is used to classify acute respiratory distress syndrome as mild, moderate, or severe (table) . Although easy to calculate, it is an imperfect measure, because of its variability with diff ering PEEP 16 and tidal volumes. 68 The oxygenation index-the product of mean airway pressure and FiO 2 , divided by PaO 2 -is an alternative to PaO 2 /FiO 2 and might be superior, because it includes mean airway pressure, which refl ects PEEP. 69 Respiratory system compliance helps with the monitoring of pulmonary mechanics, although it was not included in the Berlin defi nition because it lacked additional discriminatory value. 5 Pulmonary dead space fraction is associated with mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (odds ratio 1\u00b745, 95 % CI 1\u00b715-1\u00b783; p=0\u00b7002), but is technically challenging to measure and not frequently used. 70 Bronchoalveolar lavage permits sampling of the alveolar space and helps with the identifi cation of infectious causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome and with diagnosis of malignancy or haemorrhage.\n\nThe absence of a biomarker to defi ne the diagnosis, responsiveness to therapy, and prognosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome is problematic and limits progress in the fi eld. 71, 72 Diff ering pathologies damage lung tissue in diverse ways, producing inconsistent signals from numerous injured cell types. These signals are further confounded by age, comorbidities, and iatrogenic eff ects such as excessive fl uid administration and harmful ventilation. Many candidate biomarkers (fi gure 2) have been investigated, but a single, clear biomarker has proved diffi cult to fi nd. Biomarkers have been measured in both blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid, but are too inaccurate for clinical use. Combinations of biomarkers could be used to identify specifi c phenotypes of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome who might respond diff erentially to therapies, but further work is required to confi rm these initial fi ndings. 57 Open lung biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of diff use alveolar damage. Small, singlecentre observational studies of open lung biopsy in highly selected populations show low specifi city of the clinical diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome for the presence of diff use alveolar damage. 10-12,14 Most patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome undergoing this procedure have resulting alterations in management, 10-12,73,74 improved outcomes, 73 and little noteworthy morbidity. [10] [11] [12] 14, 73, 74 These studies are limited by their selective nature and their constrained ability to examine the entire lung. Open lung biopsy is usually reserved for exceptional cases in which there is a genuine diagnostic dilemma and poor response to therapy. \n\nManagement of acute respiratory distress syndrome can be classed as specifi c or supportive; addressing the underlying causative condition is also necessary (fi gure 4). Specifi c measures include both maintenance of gas exchange and manipulation of the underlying pathophysiology. Supportive therapies include sedation, mobilisation, nutrition, and prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism.\n\nFour randomised controlled trials [75] [76] [77] [78] published between 1998 and 1999 provided mixed results for the optimal tidal volume in acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the landmark ARMA study, 28 which was published in 2000 by the ARDSnet group, a traditional ventilatory strategy of 12 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight tidal volume in com bination with a plateau airway pressure \u2264 50 cm H 2 O was compared with a lower tidal volume of 6 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight in com bination with a plateau airway pressure of 30 cm H 2 O or less in 861 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The study was stopped early, because, despite initially worse oxygenation, low-tidal-volume ventilation was associated with an 8\u00b78% (95% CI 2\u00b74-15\u00b73) absolute reduction in mortality (39\u00b78% vs 31\u00b70%; p=0\u00b7007), and signifi cantly more ventilator-free days (10 [SD 11] vs 12 [11]; p=0\u00b7007). Importantly, less injurious ventilation was associated with more days free of non-pulmonary organ failure (12 [11] vs 15 [11]; p=0\u00b7006). Tidal volume was estimated from predicted bodyweight, which is dependent on height and sex, and calculated as 50 + 0\u00b791 \u00d7 (height in cm -152\u00b74) for men and 45\u00b75 + 0\u00b791 \u00d7 (height in cm -152\u00b74) for women. Lung-protective ventilation is associated with improved outcomes if used early in the course of acute respiratory distress syndrome, 79 and reduced mortality at 2 years. 80 Despite the adoption of a volume-limited and pressurelimited protective ventilatory strategy, critically ill mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome receiving a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg and a plateau pressure of 30 cm H 2 O or less can still be exposed to tidal hyperinfl ation, whereby the smaller-than-usual aerated section of the lung (so-called baby lung) 81 receives a larger-than-usual volume of gas, resulting in greater biotrauma and fewer ventilator-free days than those in patients without tidal hyperinfl ation. 82 Similarly, a post-hoc review 83 of the ARDSnet database did not demonstrate a safe upper limit for plateau pressures in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Volume-limited and pressure-limited ventilation can cause hypercapnic acidosis, and the overall clinical eff ect of protective ventilation and hypercapnia is uncertain. 84 Hypercapnic acidosis could provide protective eff ects in the setting of high-tidal-volume ventilation, but a benefi cial eff ect is not noted in patients receiving lung-protective ventilation. 85 PEEP prevents lung unit collapse at the end of the respiratory cycle. Benefi cial eff ects include the maintenance of functional residual capacity, improved compliance, and higher mean airway pressure, which result in decreased shunt with enhanced oxygenation, and reduced atelectasis and biotrauma. These advantages should be weighed against the eff ects of raised intrathoracic pressure-namely, decreased venous return and increased right ventricular afterload. 86 Numerous methods of setting the PEEP level have been described, including most recently oesophageal balloon manometry. 87 In the lung-protective era, four randomised controlled trials [87] [88] [89] [90] have been done to answer the question of whether higher or lower pressure is superior, with a suggestion that higher PEEP could be benefi cial. A metaanalysis 91 of three of these trials also showed a possible benefi t for a high PEEP setting in acute respiratory distress syndrome, which was associated with both lower in-hospital mortality (34\u00b71% vs 39\u00b71%; RR 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b781-1\u00b700; p=0\u00b7049) and less require ment for mechanical ventilation by day 28 (hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b716, 95% CI 1\u00b703-1\u00b730; p=0\u00b701). 91 The EPVent randomised controlled trial, 87 in which oesophageal-balloon manometry-guided PEEP was compared with use of the ARDSnet PEEP-FiO 2 table, showed that oesophageal-guided PEEP provided increased oxy genation and compliance, which translated into higher PEEP (18 cm vs 12 cm H 2 O on day one) and associated improved adjusted 28 day mortality (RR 0\u00b746, 95% CI 0\u00b719-1\u00b70; p=0\u00b7049). 87 A further meta-analysis that included this additional study showed non-signifi cant improvements in 28 day mortality with higher PEEP (pooled RR 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b779-1\u00b702), without a signifi cantly higher risk of barotrauma (1\u00b717, 0\u00b790-1\u00b752). 92 The driving pressure, which is defi ned as the diff erence between plateau and end-expiratory pressures, has been suggested as the mediator for the benefi cial eff ects of the three main components of lung-protective ventilationnamely, low tidal volume, low plateau pressure, and high PEEP. 93 On the basis of derivation and validation cohorts from 3562 patients recruited into nine randomised controlled trials, Amato and colleagues 93 reported that an increase in driving pressure of 7 cm H 2 O was associated with increased 60 day mortality (RR 1\u00b741, 95% CI 1\u00b731-1\u00b751; p<0\u00b7001). According to the statistical method of multilevel mediation analysis, none of the three main components of lung-protective ventilation was individually associated with reduced mortality, but they acted via a reduced driving pressure to exert their benefi cial eff ects.\n\nDriving pressure could help to calibrate the mechanical stress delivered by the ventilator to the functional aerated lung volume. Although 6 mL/kg tidal volume is recognised as low-tidal-volume ventilation, it is the normal tidal volume of most mammalian species. 94 As the available functional lung volume falls in acute respiratory distress syndrome as a result of collapse and consolidation, perhaps the delivered tidal volume should also decrease. Although evidence suggests that targeting of driving pressure is prudent, whether driving pressure relates causally to outcome remains to be established in a prospective, randomised controlled trial. This concept is being investigated in the setting of studies of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal to facilitate very-low-tidal-volume or ultra-protective ventilation. 95 Although these data for driving pressure are post hoc, observational in nature, and necessitate confi rmation in a prospective study, an upper limit for driving pressure of 15 cm H 2 O could be appropriate in the interim.\n\nAtelectatic areas of lung can be re-expanded by the application of brief periods of sustained high transpulmonary pressure-usually followed by the application of higher levels of PEEP to maintain and stabilise this newly reaerated region. Three commonly used such recruitment manoeuvres are sighs, sustained infl ations, and extended sighs. 96 Brief periods of raised intrathoracic pressure also impede venous return to the right atrium, predisposing to hypotension. Preclinical data have shown divergent eff ects of recruitment manoeuvres on alveolar epithelial and endothelial function. 97 A systematic review, 98 based on 40 studies, showed that recruitment manoeuvres increased oxygenation, but little information about the long-term eff ects of these interventions and no clear guidance on the usefulness of this procedure was available.\n\nThere are few robust randomised controlled trials to guide the choice of mode of mechanical ventilation. The authors of a 2015 Cochrane review, summarising three randomised controlled trials consisting of 1089 patients in total, concluded that evidence was insuffi cient to promote the use of either volume-controlled or pressurecontrolled ventilation over the other. 99 Airway-pressurerelease ventilation is used for its ability to maintain a high mean airway pressure-and thus maintain alveolar recruitment-while permitting spontaneous ventilation. Unfortunately, the evidence base is limited by suboptimum control groups in the studies done and concerns about possible high tidal volume and mean airway pressure. 100 Non-invasive ventilation can be tried in mild acute respiratory distress syndrome. A small study 101 of 40 patients showed reduced requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation and a non-signifi cant reduction in mortality with this approach. This result should be tempered by those of a much larger meta-analysis of 540 patients, documenting failure of non-invasive ventilation in almost 50% of patients. 102 The advent of high-fl ow nasal oxygen allows for simpler, more tolerable respiratory support. In an observational study, 18 (40%) of 45 patients with moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (mean PaO 2 /FiO 2 137 mm Hg) treated with high-fl ow nasal oxygen required invasive mechanical ventilation. 103 As with non-invasive ventilation, more severe illness was associated with an increasing likelihood of treatment failure.\n\nPlacing a patient prone while they receive invasive mechanical ventilation provides many physiological advantages for the management of refractory hypoxaemia, including redistribution of consolidation from dorsal to ventral areas of the lung, removal of the weight of the heart and mediastinum from the lung, improved alveolar ventilation, shunt reduction with increased oxygenation, and reduced pulmonary infl am matory cytokine production. 104 Several studies [105] [106] [107] [108] produced confl icting results about the effi cacy of prone positioning ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although prolonged prone positioning's association with physiological improvement was in creasingly recognised, 109 in these studies prone ventilation was of short duration. Additionally, sub sequent meta-analyses 110, 111 suggested benefi t specifi cally in the most hypoxaemic patients receiving lung-protective ven tilation. The PROSEVA study 112 was designed to address these shortcomings. 466 patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (which was defi ned as a PaO 2 of less than 150 mm Hg while being ventilated with an FiO 2 of 0\u00b76 or greater) who were receiving lung-protective ventilation were randomly assigned to either the supine position or daily prone position sessions lasting at least 16 h. Prone position ventilation was associated with reduced 28 day mortality compared with supine ventilation (32\u00b78% vs 16\u00b70%, p<0\u00b7001; HR 0\u00b744, 95% CI 0\u00b729-0\u00b767). There were no additional complications associated with prone positioning, although the centres involved were all experienced with this technique. This magnitude of eff ect, although large, was predicted by a previous meta-analysis. 111\n\nThe hypoxaemia of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome might necessitate excessive ventilatory support, risking the development of ventilator-induced lung injury. Paralysis removes endogenous eff ort, improving respiratory mechanics and lowering oxygen con sumption. In the ACCURSY study, 113 cisatracurium-besylate-induced paralysis was compared with placebo in 340 patients with early severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Neuromuscular blockade for 48 h resulted in-after adjustment for baseline PaO 2 /FiO 2 , plateau pressure, and Simplifi ed Acute Physiology II scores-a reduced adjusted HR for death at 90 days (0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b748-0\u00b798; p=0\u00b704). Importantly, the frequency of complications, including ICU-acquired weakness, did not diff er between groups. Although promising, additional large clinical trials are required to confi rm these fi ndings.\n\nBecause mechanical ventilation is reliant on a functional alveolus for gaseous diff usion, it is unable to provide lifesaving respiratory support when a critical volume of alveolar units has failed. In addition to replacing endogenous alveolar gaseous exchange, extracorporeal gas exchange-either extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal-allows reduction in ventilatory settings, reducing the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. At present, the evidence base for these interventions is sparse, consisting of case series, observational cohort studies, and one randomised controlled trial. In the CESAR study, 114 rather than directly assessing ECMO in refractory hypoxaemia, investigators compared management at a referring centre with management at a tertiary centre capable of providing ECMO in 180 patients. The cohort managed at the ECMO centre had a higher rate of survival without disability at 6 months than did those managed at referring centres (63% vs 47%; RR 0\u00b769, 95% CI 0\u00b705-0\u00b797; p=0\u00b703), although only 75% of the group received ECMO. Two observational studies, one from Australia and New Zealand 115 and one from the UK, 116 also showed high rates of survival with ECMO in patients with infl uenza A (H1N1) with refractory hypoxaemia on maximum ventilatory support. However, ECMO is a scarce and expensive resource that is often available only at specialist centres (fi gure 4) and associated with well recognised complications, including bleeding, vascular damage, and risks from interhospital transfer. Despite widespread and growing use worldwide, at present there is an absence of level one evidence for its effi cacy. In the UK, ECMO is a nationally commissioned service provided at few regional centres.\n\nHigh-frequency oscillatory ventilation is the provision of small tidal volumes (typically 2 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight) at high frequencies of up to 900 breaths per min, via several atypical mechanisms of gas transfer. This mode of ventilation also aff ords separation of oxygenation, which is dependent on FiO 2 and mean airway pressure, from carbon dioxide removal, which is an active process that depends on the pressure amplitude and frequency of oscillation. Two large randomised controlled trials, from Canada (OSCILLATE) 35 and the UK (OSCAR), 36 failed to show benefi t from this mode of ventilation. OSCILLATE showed harm associated with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, possibly due to the high mean airway pressure generated causing haemo dynamic compromise and requiring higher doses and duration of vasopressor, in addition to more sedation and paralysis.\n\nIn the past 5 years, statins and \u03b2 2 agonists have been investigated in large placebo-controlled, phase 3 randomised studies. In addition to their cholesterollowering eff ects, statins have pleotropic properties, making them an attractive potential therapy. In the Irish Critical Care Trials Group's HARP-2 study, 37 Preclinical data suggest that \u03b2 2 agonists could modify several pulmonary mechanisms. They increase alveolarfl uid clearance, are cytoprotective, and have antiinfl ammatory properties, which prompted investigation of salbutamol as a potential therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome. [117] [118] [119] In the UK BALTI-2 study, 120 intravenous salbutamol was given at a dose of 15 \u03bcg per kg of ideal bodyweight per h; the trial was terminated for safety reasons after recruiting 326 patients of a planned 1334. Salbutamol was associated with increased 28 day mortality compared with placebo (34% vs 23%, RR 1\u202247, 95% CI 1\u202203-2\u202208), and decreased ventilator-free and organ-failure-free days; its eff ects were possibly mediated through cardiac and metabolic toxicity, in the form of arrhythmias and lactic acidosis. The US ARDSnet ALTA study 121 of inhaled salbutamol (5 mg every 4 h for up to 10 days in 282 patients) was stopped for futility. There was no signifi cant diff erence between the active and placebo groups in the primary outcome of ventilator-free days (14\u00b74 vs 16\u00b76, 95% CI for diff erence -4\u00b77 to 0\u00b73; p=0\u00b7087) or the secondary outcome of in-hospital mortality (23\u00b70% vs 17\u00b77%, -4\u00b70 to 14\u00b77; p=0\u00b730), although patients with shock at baseline in the salbutamol group had fewer ICU-free days than did those in the placebo group.\n\nTwo other pharmacotherapies deserve mentioncorticosteroids and nitric oxide. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is an infl ammatory lung injury, and the use of corticosteroids would thus appear ideally suited to it, with their ability to dampen both infl ammation and fi brosis. Unfortunately, despite a plethora of trials, there is inadequate evidence to make a defi nitive recom mendation in favour of or against the use of corticosteroids, 122, 123 although the US ARDSnet steroid study suggested harm if corticosteroid therapy was started more than 14 days after the onset of the syndrome. 124 Nitric oxide is an inhaled pulmonary vaso dilator that improves ventilationperfusion matching, resulting in increased oxygenation. However, this increase in oxygenation does not translate into improved patient-centred outcomes. 125 Nitric oxide is associated with numerous complications, including renal failure and rebound pulmonary hypertension. 125 Various other anti-infl ammatory and pathophysiologically (fi gure 5) targeted drugs have been investigated, but have not demonstrated robust eff ectiveness. 126, 127 Fluid management Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a form of pulmonary oedema, and thus fl uid therapy is an essential aspect of management. Fluid excess is increasingly linked to detrimental outcomes across the spectrum of critical illnesses. 128 A general paradigm exists of early fl uid loading for resuscitation and organ rescue during Thrombosis Key the presentation stage of the illness, followed by fl uid unloading (deresuscitation)-either spontaneous or induced-after haemodynamic stability has been achieved. 129 Fluid-induced lung injury describes the development of lung injury after intravenous fl uid administration. The rapid administration of saline in healthy volunteers can cause pulmonary interstitial oedema; 130 patients with sepsis can experience decreased oxygenation and worsening lung injury scores as a result of fl uid bolus administration after initial resuscitation. 131 In a randomised controlled trial 132 in 1001 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome managed with lungprotective ventilation (FACTT), a detailed algorithm targeting cardiac fi lling pressures in the setting of haemodynamic stability was used for a comparison of liberal and conservative fl uid strategies. At 1 week, a conservative strategy was associated with a net neutral fl uid balance compared with a 7 L positive balance in the control arm, resulting in signifi cantly increased oxygenation, a better lung injury score, more ventilatorfree and ICU-free days, and fewer blood transfusions in the conservatively managed group. There was no diff erence between the conservative and liberal strategies in the primary outcome of death at 60 days (25\u00b75% [SD 1\u00b79] vs 28\u00b74% [2\u00b70]; 95% CI for diff erence -2\u00b76 to 8\u00b74, p=0\u00b730) or incidence of organ failures. A follow-up study at 2 years, however, showed an increased incidence of cognitive impairment in the deresuscitated group (adjusted odds ratio 3\u00b735 [95% CI 1\u00b716-9\u00b770] to 5\u00b746 [1\u00b792-15\u00b753]). 133 A small randomised controlled trial 134 of combined therapy with albumin and furosemide administration in 37 hypoproteinaemic patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome demonstrated improvements in oxygenation, fl uid balance, and haemodynamics. A further small follow-up study by the same group, in which furosemide administration with or without albumin supplementation was compared, suggested that the combination was superior to furosemide administration alone. However, in the large randomised controlled ALBIOS trial, 135 in which investigators examined a strategy of albumin administration to maintain plasma albumin concentrations higher than 30 g/L in patients with sepsis and septic shock, benefi cial eff ects on respiratory sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were not associated with higher plasma albumin concentrations, although a specifi ed subgroup analysis was not done for this outcome. Therefore whether albumin has a place in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome remains unclear. On the basis of available evidence, synthetic colloids do not have any role in the management of the critically ill. 136 \n\nInvestigators in the EDEN study explored the eff ect of low-volume trophic feeding for up to 6 days in 1000 non-malnourished patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome. 137 Despite separation of calorifi c delivery between groups (roughly 400 kcal per day vs full feeding of 1300 kcal per day), neither the primary outcome of ventilator-free days (14\u00b79 vs 15\u00b70; diff erence \u22120\u00b71, 95% CI \u22121\u00b74 to 1\u00b72; p=0\u00b789) nor the seco ndary outcomes of 60 day mortality (23\u00b72% vs 22\u00b72%; 1\u00b70, \u22124\u00b71 to 6\u00b73; p=0\u00b777) or infectious complications diff ered between groups. The full feed group, however, received more prokinetic agents, and spent more days with increased gastric residual volume, vomiting, and constipation. Additionally, there was no diff erence in physical or cognitive function in survivors at 1 year. 138 The ability to modulate the infl ammatory response via immunonutrition-ie, the delivery of immune-enhancing dietary agents such as fi sh oils, glutamine, selenium, vitamins, and other antioxidants-has long been a potential target. Early studies were suggestive of benefi t, especially when used in acute respiratory distress syndrome. 139 But randomised controlled trials have not shown effi cacy for a range of additives in either patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome 140 or those needing general critical care. [141] [142] [143] In the OMEGA study, 144 the twice daily use of the n-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, \u03b3-linolenic acid, and a mixture of antioxidants, was compared with use of an isocaloric control in 272 patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome who were also receiving enteral nutrition. Despite an eight-times increase in plasma n-3 fatty acid concentrations in the intervention group, there were clear signals of harm necessitating the termination of the study, including decreased ventilatorfree, non-pulmonary-organ-failure-free, and ICU-free days, and a non-signifi cant increase in mortality. A subsequent small phase 2 study of fi sh oils in 90 patients again failed to demonstrate benefi t in this population. 140 A meta-analysis 145 supported a lack of effi cacy associated with fi sh oil supplementation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, and a consensus paper summarising current nutritional evidence did not support the administration of pharma conutrients. 146\n\nThere are no direct comparative studies of the optimum choice of sedative or depth of sedation to be obtained in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, patients should be lightly sedated, with emphasis on analgesia, and benzodiazepines should be avoided when possible. 147 Early deep sedation in mechanically ventilated patients is associated with increased mortality; 148 by contrast, early mobilisation has been associated with improved outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure. 149\n\nDespite promising preclinical and early clinical data, most large phase 2 and 3 studies of therapeutic interventions in acute respiratory distress syndrome have failed to demonstrate effi cacy. There are many reasons for this failure, but arguably the most important is the limitation of the current defi nitions of acute respiratory distress syndrome in terms of the identifi cation of patients expressing the biological target under investigation. In approximately half of patients who meet diagnostic criteria and subsequently undergo post-mortem examination, the pathognomonic fi nding of diff use alveolar damage is not present. 6-9,13 These patients could have a mixture of coexisting conditions. In most positive trials so far, the improved outcome was a result of less injurious mechanical ventilation in the intervention group. All mechanically ventilated patients are at risk of ventilator-induced lung injury, and thus the limitation of recruiting a heterogeneous cohort based on the defi nition of acute respiratory distress syndrome is minimised. However, when a therapy aimed at a specifi c biological target is investigated, such heterogeneity assumes greater importance and reduces the ability to detect any possible eff ect.\n\nThis issue raises the question as to whether the unsuccessful therapeutic trials reported would have had the same results had it been possible to identify specifi c phenotypes responsive to the therapy under investigation. Constructing a trial in which 50% of the study population does not have the biological target under investigation is problematic and has clear implications for the evidence base for acute respiratory distress syndrome, which has been largely reliant on the American European Consensus Conference and Berlin defi nitions. In the era of personalised therapy, discovery of a biomarker or panel of biomarkers that can not only identify a specifi c population, but also, more importantly, defi ne the responsiveness to therapy is essential. 71, 72 Guidelines for the ventilatory management of acute respiratory distress syndrome have been issued by the Scandinavian Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine 150 and the Brazilian Association of Intensive Care Medicine and the Brazilian Thoracic Society. 151, 152 Guidelines from the American Thoracic Society on mechanical ventilation in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome and from the UK Intensive Care Society on management are in development."}
