{"title": "DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF RESPIRATORY VIRUSES BY USING REAL\nTIME RT-PCR METHODOLOGY", "body": "S\u00e3o Paulo, August 8, 2013\n\nDear Editor\n\nThe emergence of new respiratory viruses including: the Severe Acute Respiratory\nSyndrome; the coronavirus in 2003 (SARS-CoV); influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, in the human\npopulation in the past ten years; the emergence of a new coronavirus identified in a\npatient presenting severe acute respiratory syndrome who travelled to Saudi Arabia (June,\n2012), denominated as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV); and laboratory\nconfirmation of three human infections with an avian influenza A(H7N9) virus not previously\nreported in humans on March 29, 2013, has encouraged scientists to develop diagnostic tests\nto identify these viruses\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n. The Adolfo Lutz, a Public Health Institute, has been improving its methodology\ntools in order to provide a timely answer to public health authorities facing acute\nrespiratory disease outbreaks.\n\nTo apply the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Real Time RT-PCR\nas respiratory viruses' differential diagnosis in clinical specimens, a total of 252\nrespiratory secretions were collected from patients presenting influenza-like syndrome by\nthe three Brazilian National Influenza Surveillance Network - Sentinel Units: Hospital\nMenino Jesus; Hospital Vila Maria; Hospital Geral de Guarulhos; during influenza season\n2010. These samples presented negative results for influenza virus A(H1N1), A(H1N1)pdm09,\nA(H3N2) and B strains by CDC rRT-PCR ; and were also proven negative by differential\ndiagnosis by the use of respiratory monoclonal panel to investigate: influenza A and B\nviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus and parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 viruses by\nIndirect Immunofluorescence (IFI). The differential diagnosis in samples presenting\nnegative results, by both methodologies, was submitted to the CDC Real RT-PCR containing\nprimers and probes for adenovirus (ADV), rhinovirus (RVs), respiratory syncytial virus\n(RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV ), parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 4(PV1, PV2, PV3, PV4), kindly\nprovided by Dr. Dean Erdman. Of the 252 clinical specimens presenting negative results by\nusing differential monoclonal respiratory panel IFI, 60 (23.80%) were positive by Real Time\nRT-PCR, the following etiologic agents have been identified: RSV 20 (33.40%); PV1 3 (5%);\nPV2 7 (11.60%); PV3 9 (15%) RVs 10 (16.60%); ADV 11 (18.40%).\n\nThis study demonstrates the high sensitivity of Real Time RT-PCR in respiratory\ndifferential diagnosis, by the National Influenza Surveillance Network, sponsored by\nBrazilian Ministry of Health.\n\nIn addition, fast, accurate and sensitive detection of respiratory viruses in\nclinical specimens through the use of this methodology would also increase our\nunderstanding of the epidemiology of both new emerging viruses such as influenza A (H1N1)\npdm09, and conventional viruses such as the common cold viruses, including rhinovirus and\ncoronavirus.\n\nTaking into account the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, successful\nmeasures of prevention and control of the disease can be warranted as soon as the etiology\nof the disease is revealed.Supported by: Institute Adolfo Lutz/SES/SP, National Influenza\nSurveillance Network\nSponsored by: Ministry of Health of Brazil, Centers for Diseases Control\nand Prevention.\n"}
