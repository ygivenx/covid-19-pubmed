{"title": "Expression and cellular localisation of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus N and M proteins by recombinant vaccinia viruses", "body": "TGEV causes gastroenteritis in pigs resulting in a high mortality and morbidity in neonates and belongs to the family Coronaviridae, a group of enveloped viruses with a positive-stranded RNA genome. Coronavirus proteins are expressed from a 'nested' set of subgenomic mRNAs, which have common 3' termini but different 5' extensions. The 5'-terminal region of each mRNA is responsible for the expression of a viral protein. The v&ion contains three major structural polypeptides; a surface glycoprotein (spike or peplomer protein) with a monome~c M, 200,0~, a glycosylated integral membrane protein (M) observed as a series of polypeptides of M, 28,~-31,O~ and a nucleoprotein (N), a basic phospho~lated protein of M, 47,000 associated with the viral genomic RNA (Garwes and Pocock, 1975) . The genes encoding TGEV N and M have been cloned, sequenced and expressed in bacteria and yeast from a virulent British field isolate, FS772/70 (B&ton et al., 1988a, b) . We have now extended this work to a vaccinia virus (VV) expression system in order to analyse the structure and function of the N and M proteins in more detail.\n\nThe vaccinia virus (VV) expression system was chosen because it has the potential for transporting, processing and folding foreign eukaryotic gene products correctly (for reviews see Mackett and Smith, 1986; Moss and Flexner, 1987) . In this paper we describe the ~nst~ction of recombinant vaccinia viruses (Rw containing and expressing the TGEV N and M genes under the control of the vaccinia early/late P,,5K promoter. The antigenicity and cellular location of the W expressed TGEV proteins were compared with the native proteins produced in TGEV infected cells.\n\nWildtype W (WR strain) and RW were routinely grown on CV-1 cells or human 143 these kinase negative (HTK-) cells. R~ombinant vaccinia viruses were selected on HTK-cells in the presence of 25 pg/ml of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) (Sigma) as described by Mackett et al. (1985) . CV-1 cells and HTK-cells were both grown in medium containing EMEM (Flow Labs.) and 10% heat inactivated foetal calf serum. TGEV strain FS772/70 was grown on adult pig thyroid (APT/2) cell monolayers (Pocock and Garwes, 1975) for neutralisation assays. TGEV antigens were isolated from infected LLC-PKl cells as described by Garwes et al. (1984) .\n\nPartially purified re~mbin~t and wildtype W were prepared by pelleting stock virus through an equal volume of 36% w/v sucrose in 10 mM Tris-HCI, 1 mM 205 EDTA, pH 8.8, in a swing out 55.5 rotor (Kontron Instruments) at 25,000 X g for 80 min at 4\u00b0C. Pelleted virus was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mM potassium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2) for inoculation into mice.\n\nRecombinant DNA techniques used were as described by Maniatis et al. (1982) . DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels by freeze phenol elution (Silhavy et al., 1984) . Vector DNA was routinely treated with alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) prior to ligation.\n\nRecombinant insertion plasmids pGSN1 and pGSIM1 were constructed by removing the TGEV N gene from pBNP5 (B&ton et al., 1988a) and the M gene from pBIM3 (Britton et al., 1988b) by digestion with BamHI and ligating these gene cassettes into the BamHI site of pGS20 (Mackett et al., 1984) . The orientations of the TGEV genes were checked by restriction mapping and sequencing of the gene/promoter junction. Caesium chloride purified plasmid DNA was directly sequenced after alkali denaturation of double stranded plasmid DNA (Murphy and Kavanagh, 1988) . A specific synthetic oligonucleotide primer (5'-CACCCGCTTTT-TATAGTAAGTITTT-3') that binds 1OObp upstream from the BamHI cloning site of pGS20, was used for sequencing by the chain termination method with SequenaseTM (United States Biochemical Corporation) according to manufacturers instructions.\n\nRecombinant vaccinia viruses, were generated by transfection of W-infected CV-1 cells with calcium phosphate precipitates of plasmid vectors pGSN1 and pGSIM1, as described by Mackett et al. (1984) .\n\nDNA was extracted from wildtype and recombinant W infected CV-1 cells as described by Merchlinsky and Moss (1989) . Vaccinia virus DNA and insertion vector plasmid DNA was incubated with BamHI or Hind111 restriction enzymes in the presence of 0.3 mg . ml-' RNase A (Sigma) and DNA fragments separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. DNA was blotted onto a BiodyneTM A membrane (Pall, P/N BNNG3R 1.2 pm) and treated as described by Britton et al. (1988a) . TGEV N or M BamHI gene cassettes were labelled with [a-32P]dATP using a MultiprimeTM kit (Amersham International Plc) and incubated with the blots in prehybridisation buffer (Maniatis et al., 1982) for 16 h at 42\u00b0C. Blots were washed four times in 2 X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 25'C, twice in 1 X SSC, 0.1% SDS and twice in 0.1 X SSC, 0.1% SDS both at 68\" C, air dried and exposed to X-ray film.\n\nGlass coverslips with confluent monolayer cultures of HTK-or LLC-PKl cells were infected with wildtype or recombinant vaccinia viruses at an MO1 = 1. The infected cells were fixed in cold 80% acetone and probed with mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) DA3 (Garwes et al., 1988) The blots were probed using mAbs DA3 and 3B.B3 or TGEV hyperimmune serum.\n\nL-[ 35S]methionine labelled viral proteins were produced from TGEV (FS772/70) infected LLC-PKl cells according to the method of Garwes et al. (1987) . The infected cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1 mM methionine in PBS, pH 7.4). Precipitated proteins were separated on an 8% PAGE gel, treated with 0.8 M sodium salicylate and autoradiographed.\n\nInfected cell lysates were adjusted to a final concentration of 1% SDS and incubated for 6 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence or absence of 5mU of endoglycosidase H (Boehringer Mannheim).\n\nProteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. TGEV proteins were detected with TGEV hyperimmune antiserum and '251-labelled staphylococcal protein A.\n\nWild-type or two separate clones of each recombinant vaccinia virus, purified by sucrose density centrifugation, were inoculated intraperitoneally into groups of five 7-week-old female Balb/C mice (l-2 X 10' pfu/animal).\n\nAt 4 weeks post-vaccina-tion one mouse from each group was bled and the others were boosted with a second intraperitoneal inoculation with homologous viruses at the same titres and after 8 weeks all remaining mice were bled.\n\nThe TGEV nucleoprotein BamHI gene cassette (1585bp) containing the N gene (1149 bp) and the integral membrane protein BamHI gene cassette (830 bp) containing the M gene (789 bp) were inserted downstream and under the control of the vaccinia early/late P,.5K p romoter in the plasmid insertion vector pGS20 to produce plasmids pGSN1 and pGSIM1 (Fig. 1) . The initiation codons of both the TGEV N and M genes were 28 nucleotides from the BamHI cloning site in pGS20 (Fig. 1) . Restriction endonuclease analysis and nucleotide sequencing confirmed the orientation and promoter/gene junction for the insertion plasmids. Following transfection of plasmids pGSN1 and pGSIMI into vaccinia virus infected (X-1 cells, 20% and 1% of the resulting TIC viruses were found to express N or M protein gene products respectively, as determined by i~~odot-blot. Recombinant viruses expressing the TGEV antigens were plaque purified three times and the recombinant viruses vTN1, expressing the TGEV nucleoprotein gene, and vTM1, expressing the TGEV integral membrane protein gene, were used for subsequent experiments. (1) pGSN1, (2) vTN1, (3) pGSIM1, (4) vTM1 digested with BornHI or (5) vTNl and (6) vTMl digested with HindlII. The DNA fragments were hybridised with \"2P~labelled eDNA from the N and M BarnHi gene cassettes. 209 (Fig. 2) . Digestion of vTN1 with BamHI produced a 1.58 Kbp fragment (Fig. 2 , lane 2) that comigrated with the BamHI fragment of pGSN1 (Fig. 2, lane 1) . Digestion of vTN1 with Hind111 cleaved the N gene into two fragments, a 1.48 Kbp fragment containing the first 439 bp of the N gene and a 5.35 Kbp fragment containing the rest of the N gene (Fig. 2, lane 5) . Similarly, the M gene fragment was detected as a complete 830 bp BumHI fragment in pGSIM1 (Fig. 2, lane 3) and vTM1 (Fig. 2, lane 4) . Digestion of vTM1 DNA with Hind111 should produce a 5.00 Kbp fragment as well as a smaller 1.07 Kbp fragment containing TGEV cDNA. The 1.07 Kbp fragment was not observed because cleavage with Hind111 provides this fragment with only 30 bp of M gene sequence, insufficient for hybridisation with the probe. Only the 5.00 Kbp fragment was detected (Fig. 2, lane 6) because it contained 800 bp of M gene sequence. Results from the Hind111 digestion data and the TK-phenotype of the recombinant viruses confirms that the TGEV gene sequences are integrated into the vaccinia TK gene within the Hind111 J fragment.\n\nThe cellular localisation of the TGEV genes expressed by recombinant vaccinia viruses were determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Acetone fixed vTN1 infected cells probed with the anti-N mAb DA3 (Garwes et al., 1988) produced characteristic nucleoprotein staining in the cell cytoplasm (Fig. 3c) , like that seen for TGEV (Fig. 3a) . Nucleoprotein could not be detected in association with either the cell nucleus or on the cell surface of unfixed vTN1 infected cells (Fig. 3b) . Acetone fixed vTM1 infected HTK-cells probed with 3B.B3 showed M protein as having a polar cell distribution (Fig. 3g) . LLC-PKl cells infected with TGEV ( Fig. 3d ) or vTM1 (Fig. 3e) produced a more general cytoplasmic staining with foci of fluorescence throughout the cell cytoplasm. Integral membrane protein was not found on the cell surface of vTM1 infected or TGEV infected unfixed cells by indirect immunofluorescence, using either the mAb 3B.B3 or TGEV hyperimmune serum, implying that M protein for both viruses is retained on internal membranes. TGEV infected LLC-PKl cells treated with mouse anti-vTN1 or mouse anti-vTM1 serum produced similar fluorescent staining (not shown) as that obtained with mAbs.\n\nRW early and late gene expression for both N and M was investigated by incubating infected cells in the presence or absence of 40 pgm-' arabinosylcytosine (araC; Sigma), an inhibitor of W DNA synthesis and therefore late gene function (Co&ran et al., 1985) . Production of the TGEV antigens was assessed by titrating total cell lysates with TGEV hyperimmune serum. N gene expression was observed to be about 4-fold lower in the presence of araC (Fig. 4 ). This showed that N protein was still expressed by the early gene function of the P,.,, promoter. However, expression of M in the presence of araC was almost abolished when compared to early/late gene expression (Fig. 4) . This implied that M protein expression by vTM1 was by late gene function only or that early gene expression was very low.\n\nThe gene products were further characterised by immunoblot analysis. Sequence studies predict that the nucleoprotein gene product has a M, of 43,483 (Britton et a b Fig. 3 . Location of TGEV N and M proteins in RW infected HTK-or TGEV infected LLC-PKl cells. LLC-PKl cells (a, d, e) were infected with TGEV (a, d) for 10 h, or vTM1 (e) for 24 h. HTK-cells (b, c, f, g) were infected with vTN1 (b, c) or vTM1 (f, g) for 16 h. Cells (a, c. d, e, g) were either fixed or washed unfixed (b. f) and probed with mAbs DA3 (a, b, c) or 3B.B3 (d, e, f, g) and detected by indirect imm vfluorescence using a rabbit anti-mouse FITC conjugate.\n\nal., 1988a), but migrates as a protein of M, 47,000 by SDS/PAGE. The difference between predicted and observed molecular size may be due to phosphorylation on the serine residues (Garwes et al., 1984) which represent 11% of the ammo acids in the N protein. Nucleoprotein breakdown products have been observed in TGEV LLC-PKl cell lysates, notably a product of it4, 42,000 that is also phosphorylated (Garwes et al., 1984) . Smaller nucleoprotein breakdown products are only detected with polyclonal serum and not with the anti-nucleoprotein mAb DA3 (Fig. 5) material contains a range of smaller nucleoprotein species (M, 38,000-42,000) (Fig.  5, lane 1) . A major N breakdown product of M, 40,000 seen in TGEV cells also appears to occur in CV-1 cells infected with vTN1 (Fig. 5, lane 4) . This indicates that when nucleoprotein is expressed in large amounts the pattern of de~adation products appear to be characteristic of the cell type infected. The M protein is observed as a series of polypeptides, &l, 28~000-31,0~, in TGEV infected cells (Garwes and Pocock, 1975) . Such a series of M protein polypeptides was not observed for vTM1 infected monkey (CV-1) cells (Fig. 6 ) or in human (HTK-) and porcine (LLC-PKI) cells (not shown). Cells infected with vTMl contain a major pdypeptide species of i%f, 23,000 (Fig. 6) , identical in size to the most abundant M polypeptide species found in TGEV infected cells. Digestion of M polypeptides synthesised from vTM1 or TGEV infected cells, with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 6) , reduced the mature M protein to a molecule of i& 27,000, for both viruses.\n\nAntisera from mice. infected with two clones of each RVV, vTN1 or vTN2 and vTM1 or vTM2, were used to i~~opr~pitate antigens from L-[35S]methionine Label&xl TGEV infected LLC-PKl cell @sates (Fig. 7) . The mouse sera contained antibodies specific to the individual TGEV structural proteins but had very low TGEV neutralising activity as measured with an in vitro plaque reduction assay. Analysis of the mouse sera for W neutralising antibody levels demonstrated that all mice infected with wild-type or recombinant vaccinia viruses had seroconverted to similar titres.\n\nThe TGEV N and M protein genes from strain FS772/70 have been singularly inserted into the W TK locus and expressed from the vaccinia P,.5K promoter. Using mAbs previously raised against the TGEV proteins the RW expressed proteins were found to be of a similar size and antigenicity to their TGEV counterparts. The low levels of early M gene expression during vTM1 infection is probably due to the presence of a W early transcriptional termination signal sequence, TTTT-TAT (Rohrmamt et al., 1986) 190 bp downstream of the M gene initiation codon (Britton et al., 1988b) . Browne et al. (1986) demonstrated that the human papilloma virus type 16 Ll coding region was poorly expressed by the P7.5K promoter because it contained two W early transcriptional termination signals. The presence of the TTTTTAT sequence in the TGEV M gene probably explains the different levels of product synthesised between early and early/late gene expression for this protein.\n\nThe structural characteristics of the nucleoprotein from TGEV and RWs were compared by analysis with immunoblot and immunoprecipitation. Garwes et al. (1984) showed that TGEV, strain FS772/70, infected LLC-PKl cells contained a phosphorylated polypeptide of J4, 42,000 that appeared late in infection, was not incorporated into vii-ions and was derived from the nucleoprotein. The polypeptide of M, 42,000 was shown to be co-precipitated with full size N using the mAb, DA3, but could not be detected by immunoblot with the same mAb. Welch and Saif (1988) have also co-precipitated smaller products with an anti-N mAb including a product of M, 44,000 from TGEV strain P115 and a polypeptide of M, 46,000, from the M6 strain, along with the full size A4,48,000 molecule. Zhirnov and Bukrinskaya (1981) have shown that two forms of the influenza virus major nucleocapsid protein, NP,, (M, 56,~O) and NP,, (~~53,~), appear at late times of infection and in varying amounts depending on the cell type. Peptide mapping demonstrated that the NP,, was cleaved to form NP,, and virions preferentially contained the full length form. Cells infected with RWs expressing the TGEV N protein also produce breakdown products. It seems unlikely that these smaller N products are the translational consequence of deleted transcripts arising from TGEV defective interfering particles, as vTN1 infected LLC-PKl cells also synthesise these smaller molecules (Fig. 5, lane 2) . The presence of smaller nucleoprotein products could be due to the release of proteolytic enzymes in dying cells in the late stages of infection. Variations in the quantity of nucleoprotein breakdown products, in different cell types, could be explained by a variable resistance of host cells to viral-induced damage as has been implicated for influenza A nucleoprotein (Zhimov and Burkrinskaya, 1981) .\n\nCharacterisation of the r~ombinant M protein by immunoblot and immunoprecipitation studies have demonstrated that it is antigen&ally similar to TGEV M protein. Both the TGEV and vTM1 expressed forms of the M protein are endoglycosidase H sensitive, giving a polypeptide of M, 27,000, implying that it is glycosylated with N-linked glycans. The predicted molecular weight for the M protein is J4, 29,459 (B&ton et al., 1988b) as deduced from its gene sequence. Because the M protein in TGEV and vTM1 infected cells is glycosylated it is quite likely that the potential 16 amino acid N-terminal sequence of the M protein is cleaved. Laude et al. (1987) sequenced the N-terminus of the M protein from purified virions confirming that, for the Purdue strain, the M protein signal sequence is cleaved.\n\nIndirect i~unofluorescence has demonstrated that M protein was restricted to the cytoplasm of both vTM1 and TGEV infected cells. Coronavirus membrane proteins are transported and retained at the Golgi apparatus, where they associate with nucleoprotein in coronavirus assembly (Tooze et al., 1985) . The similar distribution of M protein in TGEV and vTM1 infected LLC-PKl cells, observed by indirect immunofluorescence, supports the theory for M protein transport to the Golgi apparatus of the cell. The distribution of M protein in HTK-cells, a human osteomyeloma cell line, was distinctly polar.\n\nMonospecific mouse serum to N and M proteins reacted with single TGEV polypeptides by i~~opr~ipi~tion demonstrating that the foreign gene products were antigenically similar. TGEV M protein mAbs can neutrahse TGEV in the presence of high con~ntrations of guinea pig complement (Woods et al., 1987) , but not with swine complement. Complement-mediate antibody neutralisation has not 216 been implicated as a natural protective mechanism in the pig gut and so the monospecific mouse polyclonal serum was heat treated to destroy any complement and titrated using a plaque reduction assay. Very little residual TGEV neutralising antibody was detected for these two proteins, but high neutralising antibody titres were obtained for antiserum raised to a RW expressing the FS772/70 spike gene (Pulford et al., 1990) ."}
