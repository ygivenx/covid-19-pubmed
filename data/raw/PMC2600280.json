{"title": "Validation of Syndromic Surveillance for Respiratory Pathogen Activity", "body": "We defined syndrome data as data in health-related registries that reflect infectious disease activity without identifying causative pathogen(s) or focusing on pathogen-specific symptoms (such as routine surveillance data for influenza-like illness [11] or surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis for polio [12]).\n\nRegistries for syndrome data were included if they met the following criteria: 1) registration on a daily basis;2) availability of postal code, age, and sex; 3) availability of retrospective data (>2 years); and 4) (potential) real-time data availability.\n\nSix registries were selected (Table 1) that collected data on work absenteeism, general practice (GP) consultations, prescription medications dispensed by pharmacies, diagnostic test requests (laboratory submissions) (13), hospital diagnoses, and deaths. In all registries, data were available for all or a substantial part of 1999\u20132004. For the GP, hospital, and mortality registry, definition of a general respiratory syndrome was guided by the case definitions and codes found in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), as selected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) (www.bt.cdc.gov/surveillance/syndromedef). For the laboratory submissions and the pharmacy syndrome, we selected all data that experts considered indicative of respiratory infectious disease (for detailed syndrome definitions, see Technical Appendix).\n\nAs a reference for the syndrome data, we included specific pathogen counts for 1999\u20132004 from the following sources: 1) Weekly Sentinel Surveillance System of the Dutch Working Group on Clinical Virology (which covers 38%\u201373% of the population of the Netherlands [14] for routine laboratory surveillance of respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], influenza A virus, influenza B virus, rhinovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, parainfluenza virus, enterovirus, and adenovirus); 2) 6 regional public health laboratories for respiratory disease\u2013related counts of Streptococcus pneumoniae (data in 2003\u20132004 were interpolated for 2 laboratories during short periods of missing data; total coverage 24%); and 3)national mandatory notifications of pertussis. The networks for respiratory pathogen counts are other networks than the earlier described laboratory submissions network for syndrome data.\n\nData were aggregated by week and analyzed by using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). For the GP, pharmacy, and laboratory submissions registries, we expressed the respiratory counts as a percentage of total weekly counts to adjust for the influence of holidays and, for laboratory submissions, changes in the number of included laboratories over time. By looking at the graphs, we explored the relationship between the time-series of respiratory pathogens and syndromes and calculated Pearson correlation coefficients.\n\nTo investigate whether the respiratory syndromes reflect patterns in respiratory pathogen counts, we constructed multiple linear regression models. These models estimated respiratory syndrome levels at a certain time with, as explanatory variables, the lagged (range of \u20135 to +5 weeks) pathogen counts as explanatory variables. We used linear regression of the untransformed syndrome to estimate the additive contributions of individual pathogens to the total estimated syndrome. We assumed a constant syndrome level attributable to factors other than the respiratory pathogens and constant scaling factors for each of the lagged pathogens. A forward stepwise regression approach was used, each step selecting the lagged pathogen that contributed most to Akaike\u2019s information criterion of model fit (15). Each pathogen entered the model only once and only if it contributed significantly (p<0.05). Negative associations (e.g., between enteroviruses, which peak in summer, vs. respiratory syndromes, which peak in winter) were excluded to avoid noncausal effects.\n\nTo discriminate between primary and secondary infections by S. pneumoniae (as a complication of respiratory virus infection) (16\u201319), we used the residuals from regressing S. pneumoniae counts on other pathogens as the variable for S. pneumoniae (instead of its counts) for all the earlier described models for respiratory syndromes.\n\nWe checked for autocorrelation in the residuals of the models with hierarchical time-series models (using SPLUS 6.2) (20,21). We calculated R2 values to estimate to what extent respiratory pathogen counts explain variations in syndromes. To explore to what extent seasonal variation could be a confounder, we also calculated R2 values of the models after adding seasonal variables (sine and cosine terms) and R2 values for seasonal terms alone. We also investigated the pathogen-specific effects in the models, by calculating the standardized parameter estimates before and after adding seasonal terms.\n\nThe models were used to estimate the expected syndrome level with 95% upper confidence limits (UCLs). We considered distinct syndrome elevations that exceeded the UCLs, as unexplained by the models (for model details, see Technical Appendix).\n\nWe investigated the timeliness of the registry syndromes in 2 ways: 1) as a measure of differences in timeliness between registries, we evaluated the time delays of the syndromes relative to each other by calculating for each of the syndromes the time lag that maximized Pearson correlation coefficient with the hospital registry (as a reference); 2) by estimating the time delays between each of the syndromes and the lagged pathogens included in its regression model.\n\nRespiratory syndrome time series were plotted for all registries (Figure 1). The Christmas and New Year holidays coincided with peaks and dips in the pharmacy and absenteeism syndromes (not shown). Because these results were probably artifacts, we smoothed these yearly peaks and dips and censored them in the analyses performed on the absenteeism registry, in which they had a strong influence on outcomes. For all registries, the respiratory syndromes demonstrated higher levels of activity in winter, which overlapped or coincided roughly with the seasonal peaks of influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and (albeit less pronounced) S. pneumoniae laboratory counts (Figure 1). Infections with parainfluenza virus, M. pneumoniae, adenovirus, and rhinovirus were detected slightly more frequently during winter (data not shown). Bordetella pertussis and enterovirus showed seasonal peaks only in summer (data not shown).\n\nThe seasonal peaks in laboratory counts of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV corresponded with peaks in the GP, pharmacy, and hospital syndromes. Other syndromes did have less obvious correspondence. Each year, around October, the respiratory syndrome showed a peak in the GP (2001\u20132004), pharmacy (2001\u20132003), and absenteeism (2002\u20132003) registries (Figure 1, panels A\u2013C) that was observed neither for the other registries nor in any of the laboratory pathogens.\n\nWe calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between the different unlagged time series of respiratory pathogens and syndromes (Table 2). Syndrome time series in all registries correlated strongly with S. pneumoniae (unadjusted total counts). The hospital, GP, pharmacy, and laboratory submissions data strongly correlated with RSV and influenza A counts (Table 2). Mortality data correlated strongly with influenza A (r = 0.65) and influenza B (r = 0.50) infections. The highest correlations between pathogen time series were between S. pneumoniae and the other pathogens (up to 0.51 with influenza A, Table 3).\n\nTable 4 presents, for each registry, the time lag (in weeks) that maximized the model fit of regressing syndrome on pathogens. For the GP, hospital, mortality, and pharmacy data, the respiratory pathogens explained the syndrome variation very well (78%\u201386%). Variations in the absenteeism syndrome could be explained for 68% by variations in the pathogen counts. Although the laboratory submissions syndrome had the lowest explained variance, still 61% of the variations in this syndrome were explained by variations in pathogen counts. Hierarchical time-series models did not show significant autocorrelation in the residuals of the models with pathogen counts as explanatory variables (20,21).\n\nWhen seasonal terms were added to the model, the variations in the mortality syndrome were just as well explained as by the model with only pathogen counts (Table 5; R2 remains 78%), while by the model with only seasonal terms, the explained variance was much lower (only 52%, Table 5). For the hospitalizations, laboratory submissions, and GP data, only slightly more syndrome variation was explained by adding seasonal terms. With only seasonal terms, the explained variance for these syndromes was clearly lower than with only pathogens in the models (8%\u201311% lower, Table 5). However, for the absenteeism and, to a lesser extent, the pharmacy data, the model with both pathogen and seasonal terms clearly explained more syndrome variations (Table 5, absenteeism 68% vs. 80%; pharmacy 80% vs. 87%). Furthermore, for the absenteeism data, the model with only seasonal terms had an even higher R2 than the model with only pathogens, whereas for the pharmacy data, the R2 with only seasonal terms was only slightly lower (3%, Table 5).\n\nTable 6 shows that for mortality, hospitalizations, laboratory submissions, and GP data, the pathogens with the highest effect clearly were RSV, influenza A, and influenza B, with no or only modest decline in standardized parameter estimates after adding seasonal terms. For the GP and hospital data, some pathogens became insignificant after seasonal terms were added (GP: rhinovirus and adenovirus; hospital: parainfluenza virus). For the pharmacy data, half of all pathogen variables became insignificant after seasonal terms were added, whereas for the absenteeism data, almost all pathogens became insignificant (Table 6).\n\nSeveral syndrome observations exceeded the 95% UCLs of the models (0\u201310/registry/year), which indicates that those syndrome observations deviated strongly from model predictions. The recurrent elevation in October of the absenteeism, GP, and pharmacy syndrome several times exceeded the UCLs (October 2001: pharmacy and GP; 2002: absenteeism; 2003: GP, absenteeism; not shown), which indicated that the model could not explain these elevations.\n\nIn Figure 2, for each registry, the difference in timeliness with the hospital registry is indicated by the lag that maximizes R2. The absenteeism syndrome (green line) preceded the hospital syndrome by 1 week, followed by the GP-based and prescription-based syndromes at +1 week and the syndrome based on mortality and laboratory submission data at +2 weeks after the hospital syndrome (projected on x-axis, Figure 2).\n\nThe differences in timeliness between the syndromes and the pathogen surveillance data were reflected by the regression models relating the syndromes to the (positive or negative) lagged pathogens (Table 4). Influenza A and influenza B had lags of 0\u20135 weeks, which suggests that the registry-syndromes were 0\u20135 weeks ahead of laboratory counts for these infections. Fluctuations in the time series of respiratory hospitalizations and the laboratory RSV counts seemed to appear in the same week (lag = 0). All other syndromes appeared to be 1\u20133 weeks later than the RSV counts, except absenteeism, which is 2 weeks earlier. Again, absenteeism seemed to be the earliest syndrome (2\u20135 weeks earlier than RSV, influenza A, and influenza B), followed by the hospital syndrome (0\u20132 weeks earlier), the GP-based and prescription-based syndromes (2 weeks earlier until 1 week later), the laboratory submission syndrome (1 week earlier until 2 weeks later), and the mortality syndrome (0\u20133 weeks later than RSV, influenza A, and influenza B).\n\nWe explored the potential of 6 Dutch medical registries for respiratory syndromic surveillance. Although several other studies also evaluated routine (medical) data for syndromic surveillance purposes (22\u201327), most evaluated only 1 syndrome and correlated this only to influenza data. An exception is Bourgeois et al. (24), who validated a respiratory syndrome in relation to diagnoses of several respiratory pathogens in a pediatric population, and Cooper et al. (27), who estimated the contribution of specific respiratory pathogens to variations in respiratory syndromes. Both studies concluded that RSV and influenza explain most of the variations in these syndromes, consistent with our findings.\n\nOur study shows that all syndrome data described in this study showed higher levels in winter, which corresponded to the seasonal patterns of RSV, S. pneumoniae, and influenza A and B viruses. Linear regression showed that the syndromes can be explained by lagged laboratory counts for respiratory pathogens (up to 86%, highest effect of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV), which indicates their potential usefulness for syndromic surveillance. Timeliness differed, with up to 5 weeks potential gain in early warning by syndromic data, compared with routine laboratory surveillance data.\n\nA limitation of our study is the short duration of our time series, especially for absenteeism and pharmacy data. Therefore, whether our observed associations between syndromes and pathogen counts can be generalized remains unclear.\n\nWe relied on laboratory pathogen counts as a proxy for their prevalence and the illness they cause. Changes in test volume over time would result in misclassification bias (as noncausative pathogens will be detected as well). However, such changes are presumably dwarfed by changes during \u201ctruly\u201d epidemic elevations of common respiratory pathogens. Additionally, laboratory diagnostics are mostly performed on hospitalized patients, and thus results inadequately reflect activity of pathogens that predominantly cause mild illness.\n\nBy adding seasonal terms, we observed that for the absenteeism and, to a lesser extent, the pharmacy registry, the associations between the respiratory syndromes and the pathogen counts might be biased to some extent. For the GP, hospital, laboratory submission, and mortality data, season is probably not an important confounder for the association between the syndromes and pathogens, because including seasonal terms in the models resulted in the same or only slightly higher explained syndrome variance (measured by R2). Models with seasonal terms alone mostly had lower explained variance than the pathogen models. For the GP and hospital data, some pathogens became insignificant after seasonal terms were added (Table 6) but not those pathogens with the largest effect estimates (RSV, influenza A and B). Therefore, we are confident in concluding that the GP, hospital, laboratory submission, and mortality syndromes do reflect pathogen activity sufficiently for use in syndromic surveillance.\n\nThe higher R2 value of the absenteeism model with seasonal terms alone suggests seasonality of absenteeism caused by several nonrespiratory conditions (28,29). To some extent, this also applies to the pharmacy syndrome, which includes medications that are not specific for respiratory infections (e.g., antimicrobial drugs). This could be validated in future studies by linking medications to illness. However, for both the absenteeism and pharmacy syndromes, the variation explained by seasonal terms is probably overestimated to some extent because data for only 2 and 3 years were used. Consequently, these time series contained less information on variation between different years than for the other registries, which benefits fitting of a model with several sine and cosine terms.\n\nTo our knowledge, laboratory submission data (test requests) have not been evaluated before as a data source for syndromic surveillance. The modest explained variance for the laboratory submissions syndrome could possibly reflect the limited use in our country of laboratory testing algorithms, which leads to substantial differences in diagnostic regimes for patients with similar clinical symptoms. In addition, occasional extra alertness by clinicians can make these data unreliable for surveillance. For instance, an unusual peak was observed in the laboratory submissions syndrome in 1999, after the official announcement of an outbreak of Legionnaires\u2019 disease (30).\n\nAn unexpected increase was also observed in the absenteeism, GP, and pharmacy syndromes, which occurred consistently each year around October (2001\u20132004). These peaks preceded the syndrome peaks concurring with peaks in influenza A, influenza B, and RSV counts and may be caused by rhinovirus activity\u2014and asthma exacerbations caused by rhinovirus\u2014which usually rises in the fall (31\u201333). Rhinovirus might go undetected because GP physicians rarely ask for diagnostics if they suspect a nonbacterial cause for relatively mild respiratory disease. Although specific asthma diagnoses were excluded from the respiratory syndrome definitions, exacerbations of asthma might affect other respiratory categories in the GP or pharmacy syndrome. This observation illustrates that additional diagnostics are needed for identifying the causes of unexplained respiratory disease elevations. Several novel respiratory pathogens for which diagnostics are not yet widely available have been discovered in recent years, underlining that it is quite possible that \u201chidden\u201d epidemics occur (34\u201336). The extra October peak and several other syndrome elevations above the 95% UCLs in our study may well reflect such hidden epidemics. The fact that these occur is supported by studies showing that many individual syndrome cases cannot be linked to known pathogens. For example, Cooper et al. (37), who investigated syndromic signals by using patient self-sampling (at home), could only obtain diagnostic results for 22% of these cases.\n\nFor early warning surveillance, timeliness is crucial. Absenteeism data seem to have the best timeliness, but their lack of medical detail complicates interpretation. Unexpectedly, the hospital data reflect respiratory pathogen activity earlier than the GP data. Although in the Netherlands patients are encouraged to consult their GP before going to the hospital, elderly persons, for whom respiratory infections are more likely to cause severe illness, may often go to a hospital directly. Therefore, hospital data may prove to be an earlier marker for respiratory disease than GP data, but this possibility needs further exploration.\n\nAn important concern when using syndromic surveillance is that it may generate nonspecific alerts, which, if they happen regularly, would lead to lack of confidence in a syndrome-based surveillance system. Here, we see a clear advantage of using data from multiple registries in parallel so that signal detection can be made more specific by focusing on signals that occur concurrently in >1 data source. To illustrate this we defined every exceeding of the UCLs of the regression models as a \u201csignal,\u201d i.e., a syndrome elevation unexplained by known pathogen activity and therefore possibly reflecting activity of underdiagnosed or emerging infectious disease. Over 2002\u20132003 (the period that all 6 registries were in the study), only 5 \u201cconcurrent\u201d signals occurred versus 34 \u201csingle\u201d signals over all registries. We did not evaluate whether the syndromes indeed detect outbreaks of infectious diseases earlier than clinical or laboratory pathogen surveillance. Such an evaluation is often performed by testing the ability to detect historical natural outbreaks or simulated outbreaks (10,38). However, historical natural outbreaks are rare and simulated outbreaks may be unrealistic. Nevertheless, further research into the outbreak detection performance of these syndromes would be worthwhile.\n\nThe results of this study suggest that it might be best to combine syndromic data and pathogen counts in a prospective surveillance system. Such surveillance can identify distinct syndrome elevations that cannot be explained by respiratory pathogen activity as indicated by routine laboratory pathogen surveillance.\n\nOverall, the GP, hospital, mortality and, to a lesser extent, laboratory submission syndromes reflect week-to-week fluctuations in the time-series of respiratory pathogens as detected in the laboratory. Registries monitoring trends of these syndromes will therefore most likely reflect illness caused by emerging or underdiagnosed respiratory pathogens as well and therefore are suited for syndromic surveillance. Further research would be required to assess to what extent absenteeism and pharmacy data reflect respiratory illness. Investigating the actual outbreak detection performance of the syndromes in this study would also be worthwhile.\n\nData from the registries in this study are not yet real-time available, although given modern information technology, this availability is clearly feasible. Our study can help prioritize which type of healthcare data to include in future syndromic real-time surveillance systems."}
