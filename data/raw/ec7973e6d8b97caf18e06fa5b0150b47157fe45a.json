Compound purity was assessed via analytical HPLC (Shimadzu) using a C18 column and a1%/min linear gradient of CH 3 CN/water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, from 30 to 50% CH 3 CN. NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian MR-400 instrument. High-resolution mass spectrometry was conducted by the University of Buffalo service facility.\n\nAnalytical HPLC trace of purified compound 3 (254 nm):\n\nHRMS ((M+2H)/2) 2+ Calculated: 662.8426; measured: 662.8418 FITR (neat, cm -1 ): 3280.92, 3039.81, 1666.50, 1643.35, 1537.27, 1433.11, 1199.72, 1184.29, 1130.29, 879.54, 837.54, 837.11, 798.53, 748.38, 721 93, 172.70, 172.63, 172.57, 171.29, 169.99, 142.98, 141.79, 137.70, 136.86, 135.61, 135.49, 132.59, 132.43, 128.94, 128.39, 128.22, 129.12, 128.08, 127.98, 127.87, 126.48, 126.36, 124.25, 123.65, 123.60, 121.03, 61.29, 60.35, 55.27, 55.08, 51.76, 49.02, 37.06, 36.63, 36.53, 35.56, 35.40, 29.18, 27.14, 24.62, 24.34, 12.90 2341.62, 1668.45, 1652.06, 1634.70, 1538.26, 1404.20, 1198.78, 1137.27, 1060.87, 879.56, 836.16, 798.54, 749.36, 717 172.71, 163.07, 160.45, 160.10, 137.67, 132.38, 129.15, 128.96, 128.86, 128.48, 128.05, 127.78, 127.37, 126.65, 126.35, 124.33, 62.66, 61.20, 55.15, 51.20, 36.59, 35.94, 35.52, 33.87, 33.38, 32.43, 29.18, 27.38, 27.25, 27.13, 24.38, 12.11 1667.49, 1633.74, 1538.26, 1441.81, 1414.81, 1198.78, 1177.56, 1129.34, 1056.04, 834.23, 798.54, 749.36, 720.34 168.57, 160.65, 160.25, 137.67, 137.09, 135.46, 135.14, 132.30, 129.15, 128.94, 128.47, 128.21, 128.10, 127.99, 127.76, 127.26, 127.06, 126.64, 126.46, 123.88, 123.58, 123.43, 63.35, 62.55, 60.70, 57.84, 55.97, 55.18, 51.94, 51.75, 51.57, 36.84, 36.60, 36.43, 35.82, 35.45, 35.26, 33.88, 33.49, 32.26, 29.21, 28.36, 27.98, 27.27, 27.19, 27.11, 24.79, 24.45, 24.33, 12.80, 12 .02 171.74, 170.77, 170.69, 168.11, 167.79, 137.67, 129.15, 128.87, 128.82, 128.49, 128.21, 128.16, 127.96, 127.80, 127.40, 126.65, 126.43, 123.57, 62.70, 57.89, 55.94, 54.98, 52.11, 36.94, 36.50, 36.01, 35.37, 33.86, 33.41, 32.54, 28.72, 28.66, 28.25, 27.99, 27.91, 27.37, 27.32,27.22, 24.74, 24.46, 16.08, 12.34, 12.16 Surface Plasmon Resonance SPR was conducted using a Biacore X (Biacore, Inc). . Streptavidin was immobilized to 7500 RU using EDC/NHS coupling to a CM5 chip (GE), then the surface was blocked with ethanolamine. 1100 RU of biotinylated RNA was immobilized Compounds were injected at a flow rate of 50 \u00b5L/min in 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl , with 0.005% tween for one minute. Each injection was repeated twice for consistency. Each trace was fit individually to a Langmuir model. \n\nWestern blots of cell lysates from virus-infected cells were separately probed with anti-p24 (top), anti-reverse transcriptase (RT, middle) and anti-GAPDH (bottom) antibodies.\n\nCompound ( \n\nCell lysates from compound-treated control cells were examined to confirm that compounds did not significantly affect GFP expression.
