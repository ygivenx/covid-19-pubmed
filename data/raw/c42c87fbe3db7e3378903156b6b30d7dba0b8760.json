{"title": "SEQUENCE AND ANALYSIS OF BOVINE ENTERITIC CORONAVIRUS (F15) GENOME I. --SEQUENCE OF THE GENE CODING FOR THE NUCLEOCAPSID PROTEIN; ANALYSIS OF THE PREDICTED PROTEIN", "body": "Bovine enteritic coronavirus (BECV) belongs to the monogeneric Coronaviridae family having the avian infectious bronchitis virus as type species. They are pleiomorphic, enveloped, surrounded by a fringe of <~ club-shaped >> spikes looking like a corona in the electron-microscope and giving the name to the family. The viral genome is a positive single-stranded RNA of approximately 18 to 20 kb, its 3'-end is polyadenylated [19, 22] . This genome codes for the viral proteins which are nucleocapsid (N), membrane (El), spikes (E2) and several non-structural proteins. They are translated from a 3'-end coterminal nested set of mRNA, each also having a common 5'-leader sequence [8] . Only the unique 5'-terminal sequence, not present in the next smaller RNA of the set, is translated.\n\nIt was recently established that, in fact, BECV contains 4 main structural proteins: the nucleoprotein N (50 Kd), the transmembrane E1 glycoprotein (28 Kd) and 3 peplomer glycoproteins E2, gpl05 and gp95. The haemagglutinin protein E2 (125 Kd) is cleaved by reducing agents into 2 subunits having molecular weights of 65 Kd; the main neutralizing epitopes of the viral particle are located on gpl05 (105 Kd) [9, 24, 6] ; the structure of gp95 (95 Kd) is not clearly established.\n\nThe BECV induces very severe, often fatal, diarrhoea in young calves. It was described for the first time in the United States of America [13] ; we have been able to isolate such a virus in the faeces of diarrhoeic calves in France and to experimentally reproduce the disease [4] . These 2 strains of BECV are distinguishable by using monoclonal antibodies [23] . BECV Vaccines produced from cell culture of attenuated or inactivated BECV are not totally protective and they necessitate production of large volumes of viral suspension because of the low infectious titre obtained in authorized cell lines. For these reasons, we have started cloning and sequencing the French F15 strain of BECV to try and produce cheaper and more efficient vaccines by genetic engineering or by oligopeptidic synthesis.\n\nHRT18 cells (human rectal tumour cell line) were grown in RPMI-1640 medium containing 15 ~ foetal calf serum (FCS) [10] except that tylosine (10 ~tg/ml) and lincomycine (200 ~tg/ml) were added to the medium instead of penicillin and streptomycin.\n\nBovine enteritic coronavirus F 15 strain (BECV-F15) was isolated from diarrhoeic calf faeces, then directly adapted on HRT18 cells [10] and plaque-purified. It was grown as previously described [4] . Infectious titres reached 5 x 105 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/ml.\n\nAfter freezing and thawing of infected cells together with supernatant and then clarification, the virus was purified by 2 ultracentrifugation steps (velocity then isopycnic) [9] .\n\nA 1-ml sample of purified virus suspension in distilled water was added to the same volume of 2-fold concentrated TNE buffer (20 mM pH 8 Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCI, 2 mM EDTA) containing 400 ~tg of proteinase K. After incubation for 30 min at 37~ then for 5 min at 50~ a same volume of the same buffer containing 2 ~ SDS was added and incubation carried on for 30 min at 25~ Genomic RNA was phenol/chloroform-extracted, then precipitated in 2.5 volumes of 0.25 M sodium acetate in ethanol. After one night at -20~ RNA suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 g, the pellet washed with 75 ~ ethanol, dried and dissolved in minimal volume of distilled water. One optical density (OD) unit at 260 nm corresponded to 40 t~g/ml of single-stranded RNA [12] .\n\ncDNA cloning.\n\nThe synthesis of cDNA complementary to the 3'-end of the BECV-FI5 genome was carried out in a volume of 52 ~tl: 10 [zg in 10 ~tl of BECV RNA, denatured at 65~ for 5 min and quickly chilled in an ice bath, were added to 42 ~zl of 100 mM pH 8.3 Tris-HCl at 42~ containing 100 mM KC1, 100 mM MgCI 2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 4 ~tg actinomycin D, 500 ~tM each of the 4 dNTP, 75 units RNasin, 140 units reverse transcriptase (P.H. Stehelin), and as primer, 10 tzg oligo-dT. Incubation was performed for 2 h at 42~ and the reaction was stopped by adding 2 tzl 500 mM EDTA. Reaction products were extracted with phenol/chloroform, chloroform and ethanol precipitation. Free RNA strands non-hybridized with cDNA were digested with endonuclease T 2 [25] ; these digests and free nucleotides were removed by gel filtration on a spun column of << Sephadex-G50>> medium (Pharmacia) [12] .\n\nThe RNA-cDNA heteroduplexes were then poly-dC tailed : 2 pmoles of 3' ends were dissolved in 20 ~L1 of 25 mM Tris-HC1 buffer pH 7 containing 100 mM Kcacodylate, 0.2 mM DTT, l mM CoCI 2, 0.2 mM dCTP, 50 ~Lg bovine serum albumin (B.R.L.), 13.5 units of terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase (B.R.L.) and 30 izCi ~-32p-dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmole). The reaction was carried out at 37~ for 3 min and stopped by adding 2 g.l 500 mM EDTA [16] . The product was phenol/ chloroform-extracted. An average of 20 dC/3'-end of heteroduplex was obtained.\n\nC-tailed heteroduplexes were annealed to dG-tailed PstI-linearized PBR322 plasmid (1 mole for 2 moles), in a volume where the plasmid was at a concentration of 5 ng/~l at 65~ for 10 min. Competent RR1 Escherichia coli cells were transfected with this material [5] . The total DNA concentration was 0.25 Ezg/ml.\n\nE. coli cells were grown overnight in a medium containing 12 ~g/ml tetracycline, then treated by alkaline lysis [12] . Plasmidic DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform treatment and ethanol-precipitated. DNA inserts were removed by PstI restriction enzyme : 1.2 Izl of 10-fold concentrated buffer (100 mM pH 7.5 Tris-HCl, 1 M NaC1, 100 mM MgC12, 1 mg/ml BSA) and 2 units of PstI enzyme (B.R.L.) were added to 10 ~tl of plasmidic DNA solution. Insert size was established by electrophoretic migration in 1% agarose gels in TBE buffer (89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA). Probes were prepared by nick-translation in a 20 ~tl volume containing 0.5 ~tg DNA, 2 ~tl of 10-fold concentrated buffer (500 mM pH 7.2 Tris-HCl, 100 mM MgSO4, 1 mM DTT, 500 ~tg/ml BSA), 20 ~tM each of the 4 dNTP, 2.5 ng pancreatic DNase I (Boehringer), 40 ~tCi a-32p-dCTP (800 Ci/mmole) and 0.8 unit DNA polymerase I. Mixture was incubated for 2 h at 16~ Reaction was stopped by adding 3 tzl 500 mM EDTA pH 8. Free nucleotides were removed by filtration through a spun column.\n\nNorthern and Southern blots were performed as described by Maniatis [12] . Probes were incubated for hybridization overnight at 42~ (Southern) or at 55~ (Northern); blots were then washed in low salt concentration solutions: three times for 15 min in 0.1% SDS, 2 \u2022 SSC and twice for 15 min in 0.1% SDS, \u2022 0.1 SSC at 52~\n\nM 13 dideoxy sequencing was carried out according to the Sanger technique [17] , using ~-3sS-dATP (New England Nuclear). In short, the main steps were the following :\n\nDNA replicative forms of mpl8 or mpl9 M13 phage were prepared [3] ; they possess polylinkers with single cleavage sites for EcoRI, SacI, KpnI, Sinai, BamHI, SalI, PstI, SphI and HindIII restriction enzymes. Viral cDNA inserts were extracted from PBR322 plasmid and treated by restriction enzymes having sites in the MI3 polylinker. DNA fragments ranging between 300 and 500 bases were purified by electrophoresis in low melting point agarose (Gibco-BRL) gel. M13 phage DNA was cleaved by the same enzymes and 5' end phosphates removed by alkaline phosphatase (Boehring) treatment [12] . DNA were then phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. After ligation of the insert in the vector, performed with 50 ng of insert in a molar ratio of 3/1 TG1, E. coli competent cells were transfected [5] . TG1 recombinant clones were selected in a IPTG-and X-gal-containing medium. White plaques were then checked by hybrization with insert radioactive probe.\n\nSequencing was then performed using a primer complementary to the 3'-end of the DNA strand to be transcribed. These primers were synthesized in an automated DNA synthesizer (Biosearch 8600).\n\nSequence data were analysed and assembled with the aid of the program of Queen and Korn [14] of the ~< Beckman Microgenie >> program (March 1985, version Beckman Instruments, Inc.) adapted to the <<IBM PC-XT>> microcomputer.\n\nStarting material for cDNA synthesis was 10 ~g of purified and temperaturedenatured viral RNA. When analysed by electrophoresis in alkaline agarose gels, the sizes of the cDNA obtained using oligo-dT as a primer ranged between 1.3 and 6.0 Kb. After binding of heteroduplexes to PBR322, this construction was transfected into E. coil-competent cells and we obtained 2 x 105 clones/~g of PBR322.\n\nSome 265 colonies containing 0.3-to 2.0-Kb inserts were studied. Inserts of a larger size than 0.5 Kb very often showed an internal PstI site (results not shown). Their viral specificity was checked, after nick-translation 32p_ labelling, by hybridization with purified genomic viral RNA or cellular RNA ( fig. 1 ). Viral-specific inserts were further used for characterization of other inserts.\n\nInsert orientation was established by hybridization with inserts having no PstI site and by restriction endonuclease mapping with enzymes having no or only one cleavage site in PBR322 plasmid.\n\nThe location of the insert along the viral genome was determined by Northern blot analysis: full length or purified products of insert restriction cleavage were hybridized with poly(A) \u00a7 RNA extracted from infected or non-infected cells. Before hybridization these RNA were electrophoresed in hydroxymethyl Hg-containing agarose gel. Under these experimental conditions, 8 viral-specific poly(A) + messenger RNA bands were resolved (J. Laporte and C. Cruciere; to be published). They form a specific RNA-nested set as established for other coronaviruses. All the inserts we obtained hybridized with the 8 viral RNA bands (results not shown); they were complementary to the 3' end of the viral genome. Figure 2 presents the schematic location of the inserts we have studied. The 1.6 insert has a 2,000-nucleotide size and the 5'-end of insert 2.56 is presumably 2,400 nucleotides from the 3'-end of the viral genome. As deduced from the sizes of N and E1 viral proteins, they should cover the whole length of the N gene (1,700 nucleotides) and the beginning of the E1 5'-adjacent gene (320 nucleotides). Radioactive probes were prepared from insert-containing PBR322 plasmid. These probes were hybridized on nitrocellulose sheets with dots of RNA extracted from non-infected (C) or BECV-F15-infected (V) HRT18 cells. Hybridization was checked by autoradiography. In the experiment shown, inserts 1.6, 1.22 and 2.56 were clearly virus-specific. cDNA sequencing.\n\nAs mentioned above, 400-bp fragments of the cDNA clones were subcloned in m p l 8 or m p l 9 M13 phage DNA. Their nucleotidic sequences were determined by sequencing both M13 DNA strands or by multiple sequencing of one strand. We have been able to establish a 1,710-nucleotide sequence from the 3'-end of the genome (fig. 3) the smaller one from nucleotide 135 to nucleotide 755 ( fig. 3) . The first has a coding capacity for a 448-amino-acid protein, the second for a 207-aminoacid protein ( fig. 4 ).\n\nWe have determined, by cDNA cloning of BECV-F15 genomic RNA using an oligo-dT primer, a sequence of 1,710 nucleotides.\n\nWe assume that this sequence comprises the nucleocapsid protein gene sequence.\n\nFor every coronavirus so far studied, the gene coding for the N protein is located at the 3'-end of the viral genome. The same conclusion arises from our studies on the BECV-F15 poly(A) + RNA (to be published).\n\nThe largest ORF has a 1,344-nucleotide length and encodes for a 448-aminoacid protein with a molecular weight of 49.4 Kd. Our previous results [4] had shown a 50-Kd molecular weight N protein.\n\nRecently [11] it was described for the US Mebus strain of the related bovine corona virus (BCV), that the N protein gene was at the 3'-end of the viral genome.\n\nMain ORF. ~ The distance between the first AUG following the initiation codon and this initiation codon is 693 nucleotides. When we compared the sequence around the initiation codon to homologous sequences of different strains of MHV we found the same CTAAAC sequence upstream of the initiation AUG.\n\nSecondary ORF. --The consensus sequence GUAAUGGC surrounding its initiation codon is one of optimal environment for starting mRNA translation [7] . Bunyaviruses and adenoviruses express 2 different proteins from only one gene by having 2 overlapping ORF [7] . So, we cannot exclude the translation of a protein from the secondary ORF. Its predicted molecular weight is 22.9 Kd for 207 amino acids. This protein has a rather high leucine content : 19.8 % compared to 5 070 for the N protein. Furthermore, its N-terminal end is hydrophobic and is a potential membrane anchor region. Genes presenting 2 different ORF are also described for other coronaviruses : mRNA5 of JHMvirus [20] , mRNAD of IBV [2] and N protein mRNA of the Mebus BCV strain [11] .\n\nThis part of the genome may play an important role during the genomic RNA trancription to the complementary minus RNA strand. Sequence homology between BECV-F15 and MHV for the last 100 nucleotides of the coding part is only 59 070, but homology increases to 75 ~ for the 3'-noncoding end. A 10-nucleotide sequence (GGGAAGAGCT) was found in common at the same place of this gene area for MHV and IBV viruses [2] (fig. 5 ). We find an identical sequence (except the last T) for BECV-F15 virus between nucleotides 1,631 and 1,640. When looking at the GETV genome se- . 6 ) and only 25.2 07o and 24.1 070, respectively, with TGE and IBV virus N proteins. These coronavirus N proteins are phosphorylated on their serine residues [18] . Our results show 43 serine residues in BECV-F15 nucleocapsid protein (9.6 070 of the total amino acids). For this virus and for JHM, TGE and IBV viruses we find 2 main areas where serine residues are clustered. For BECV-F15 and JHM viruses they are in homologous areas (nucleotides 9 to 19 and nucleotides 191 to 220) of low overall homology (58 070 and 53 070). One serine cluster is common to the 4 viruses. This fact is striking because of the low sequence homology between these viruses.\n\nIt was previously established [21, 1] that N protein genomic RNA binding sites are located in the basic portions of the protein. For the complete sequence there is an excess of 19 basic residues compared to acidic residues. There are 5 basic-rich regions which are found in homologous areas of MHV, TGE and IBV viruses. Concerning BECV-F15 and MHV, 4 of these areas have 90 07o homology. The fifth has only 60 % homology but is also serinerich and possesses a sequence in common with TGE and IBV viruses (amino acids 193 to 222). It may have a more specific function in protein/RNA recognition.\n\nWe also observed a strong sequence homology, not yet described, in the first part of the N-terminal end of the N proteins of BECV-F15, BCV, MHV, TGEV and IBV viruses: This sequence has no peculiar properties : 9 hydrophilic and 8 hydrophobic residues. The biological significance of these findings is not known.\n\nIn conclusion, we have noticed that there are only minor changes between BECV-F15 and BCV Mebus strain N proteins. Work is in progress to sequence the other virus genes and to find out how similar in fact these two last viruses are. Because of the antigenic differences established by monoclonal antibody screening, the specificities should be found on the gene coding for the spike gpl05 protein. \n\nSt~QUENCE ET ANALYSE DU Gt~NOME DU CORONAVIRUS ENTI~RITIQUE BOVIN (F15) I. --S6quence du g6ne codant pour la prot6ine nucl6ocapsidique;\n\nanalyse de la prot6ine d6duite\n\nNous avons clon6 I'ARN g6nomique du coronavirus ent6ritique bovin F15 (BECV-F15), dans le plasmide PBR322 apr~s avoir pr6par6 le cDNA correspondant ~ raide d'une amorce oligo-dT: 265 clones ont 6t6 &udi6s.
