{"title": "Sepsis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae associated with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in a splenectomized patient for spherocytosis", "body": "Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome that is characterized by an inappropriate hyper-inflammatory immune response \u2013 primary, as a consequence of a genetic defect of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes or \u2013 secondary, in the progression of infections, rheumatic or autoimmune diseases, malignancies or metabolic diseases. Among HLH-related infections, the most common are the viral infections: Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, other herpes viruses, the viruses of hepatitis B and C, etc., followed by bacterial, parasitic, or fungal infections. Association of secondary HLH to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in a patient splenectomized for spherocytosis has not been described so far.\n\nWe present the case of a male Caucasian patient, aged 37 years, splenectomized for spherocytosis since the age of 4, with no prophylaxis of meningococcal, and pneumococcal infections through vaccination, that was brought to the emergency room for fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash skin, myalgia, anuria, and marked alteration of his general condition. At the time of admission, on physical examination, the following changes were noticed: facial erythema, purpura on the legs (see Fig. 1), cyanosis of the extremities, jaundice, left basilar crackles, heart rate of 130 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/100 mm Hg, hepatomegaly, and anuria. The laboratory investigations that were performed revealed the following alterations (at admission and in evolution) that are presented in Table 1.\n\nPeripheral smear revealed normochromic normocytic red blood cells, as well as microspherocytes and spherocytes, frequent polychromatophilic macrocytes; erythrocytes with Howell\u2013Jolly bodies (splenectomy), rare dacryocytes (teardrop cells), and schistocytes. Polymorphonuclears with vacuolated cytoplasm are present (toxic appearance), diplo-, encapsulated, and intra- and extracellular gram-positive cocci. Bone marrow sample was harvest and on hematoxylin-eosin stain an increased number of activated macrophages with prominent hemophagocytosis of hematopoietic elements was revealed. Blood cultures and urine cultures were positive for S pneumoniae, resistant to benzylpenicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, cefotaxime, and intermediate resistance to ceftriaxone, imipenem, sensitive to ofloxacin, vancomycin, moxifloxacin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, levofloxacin, linezolid, rifampicin, sparfloxacin, pristinamycin, amoxicillin, and telithromycin. Viral, parasitic etiologies were excluded, as well as rheumatic diseases, malignant tumors, which may be involved in secondary HLH.\n\nA cardiac ultrasound was performed and revealed no suggestive images of infectious endocarditis or valvular heart disease. Initially, the chest radiography revealed no changes, but in evolution, it showed bilateral alveolar condensation and left pleural effusion.\n\nThe case was interpreted as sepsis due to a multidrug-resistant S pneumoniae associated with consumption coagulopathy (bleeding at venepuncture site and epistaxis), acute liver failure, acute renal failure by myoglobinuria, and HLH. In evolution, acute respiratory failure occurred, for which endotracheal intubation of the patient was performed.\n\nThe treatment was started with infusions of macromolecular solutions, hydro-electrolytic rebalancing, packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and antibiotics \u2013 initially, with ultrabroad-spectrum antibiotics, meropenem 2 g/day associated with linezolid 2 \u00d7 600 mg/day, thereafter treatment continued with linezolid associated with moxifloxacin 400 mg/day according to antibiogram results, dexamethasone, etoposides 150 mg/m2/day, 3 days, anidulafungin, intravenous immunoglobulin, and daily hemodialysis sessions throughout hospitalization. The evolution was unfavorable with coma, Glasgow Coma Scale of 3, and quadriplegia, the occurrence of bronchopneumonia required endotracheal intubation. During hospitalization, the patient was anuric. Patient death occurred on day 15 of hospitalization. Hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemically stainings of liver biopsies taken during the anatomopathological examination revealed the following changes: massive infiltration of portal tract and sinusoids by mononuclear cells. The CD68 stain shows numerous large, irregularly shaped CD68+ cells as being macrophages, cells that are localized both in the portal tract and sinusoids, and with an increased phagocytic activity on lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and polynuclear cells. On CD8 stain, numerous CD8+ lymphocytes were revealed. The conclusion was: the described aspect is in concordance with the diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosi. Autopsy examination also revealed bilateral renal papillae necrosis secondary to myoglobinuria, and the presence of hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, and lymph nodes Figs. 2\u20134.\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient's next of kin (from his father) for publication of this case report and any accompanying images. The study was accepted by the Ethics Committee of the hospital and they encouraged publishing the article. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal.\n\nThe association of sepsis due to S pneumoniae with secondary HLH in a splenectomized patient for spherocytosis should be taken into consideration in similar cases like ours. To our knowledge, no similar cases had been published in the literature, in which the secondary HLH was the consequence of an invasive pneumococcal infection in a splenectomized patient for spherocytosis, and the association of splenectomy with HLH is surprizing. Other similar observations are necessary in the future."}
