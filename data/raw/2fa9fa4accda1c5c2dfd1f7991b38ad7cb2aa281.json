{"title": "Tourism policy issues for today", "body": "Tourism in the twenty-first century is a major vehicle for fulfilling people's aspirations for a higher quality of life. Whether this happens at the local, state/provincial, regional, national or international level, the basic tenets remain consistent. One aim is to facilitate tourism interactions between individuals and, it is hoped, lay the groundwork for peace through authentic social relationships. Tourism is part of the growing international trade-in-service, travel-sector industries. As such, it has the potential to be an important stimulant for future improvement in the economic, political, sociocultural and ecological dimensions of people's lives. Combining the elements of creating economic income with the potential to foster greater international understanding and goodwill, tourism holds promise for serving as a vehicle for peace throughout the world. This supports the lofty view that the highest purpose of tourism policy can be to balance its benefits and costs for communities as tourism destinations and to improve the quality and sustainability of life for local citizens. Tourism as a policy for peace is presented in Chapter 5.\n\nToday's key tourism policy issues include tourism regulation and public policy, areas facilitating tourism such as information technologies, financial organizations and organizations related to tourists themselves as consumers of travel. This chapter provides an overview of such important issue areas with examples of their effects on tourism policy formation. In this context, tourism policy first is described in an ethical framework, its core components identified, and an issues-focused working definition proposed in order to provide an adequate framework for analysing and understanding the complex issues confronting the production and distribution of international tourism products and services in today's world.\n\nThe Global Code of Ethics for Tourism adopted 21 December 2001, by the 13th session of the General Assembly of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) outlines principles to guide tourism development. It also serves as a powerful frame of reference for the different stakeholders in the tourism sector 'with the objective of minimizing the negative impact of tourism on the environment and on cultural heritage while maximizing the benefits of tourism in promoting sustainable development and poverty alleviation as well as understanding among nations' (UNWTO, 2001 , A/RES/56/212, p. 1). The Code further states that 'provided a number of principles and a certain number of rules are observed' it should be possible to reconcile tourism in its increasingly prominent role in the services industry with contending issues in international trade such that all stakeholders in tourism development -'with different albeit interdependent responsibilities rights and duties' -will contribute collectively to this aim. This is envisioned through 'genuine' partnership and cooperation between public and private stakeholders in tourism development in an 'open and balanced way'.\n\nIn sum, the UNWTO calls upon all individuals involved in tourismrelated organizations -from local destinations to tourism generating and receiving economies and their negotiations in global trade organizationsto develop and adhere to 'a set of interdependent principles for the interpretation and application' of the Code of Ethics for Tourism. This provides a business ethics framework for examining the effect of international tourism policy issues as they apply to contemporary local, state/provincial, regional, national and international affairs.\n\nIn this light, following is a set of core tourism policy component issues (identified in spring 2005 by Master of Tourism Administration candidates in The George Washington University Tourism Policy Analysis course -TSTD 262.10 -taught by Dr Ginger Smith, co-author, and Juan Luna-Kelser):\n\n\u2022 Guidelines/set of rules/regulation for the common good/influence behaviour/education; \u2022 Framework -participatory process; \u2022 Codes of conduct;\n\n\u2022 Philosophy -vision to make tourism 'the sector'; \u2022 Dynamic change; \u2022 Collaboration/converging views = effective policy; \u2022 Consensus among key stakeholders;\n\n\u2022 Based on research -measurable.\n\nIn consideration of these elements, the co-authors developed their tourism policy definition as first framed in Chapter 1 to say tourism policy is 'a progressive course of actions, guidelines, directives, principles, and procedures set in an ethical framework that is issues-focused and best represents the intent of a community (or nation) to effectively meet its planning, development, product, service, marketing, and sustainability goals and objectives for the future growth of tourism'.\n\nTo understand key tourism policy issues in the largest possible context, it is especially important for students to identify in what stage of tourism policy development a particular project or case resides. Aligning the tourism policy analysis with the proper developmental phase of tourism is a critical first step in establishing a robust research design that is both supported by adequate and accessible data and able to be completed on funding deadlines or a timeline viable to the client (which includes semester-based course professors). In this regard, a brief overview of three tourism policy development segments is offered here, with greater emphasis on the third -the summative stage -as the most useful for contemporary tourism policy analysis and destination management research.\n\nThe formative phase in tourism policy development means exactly thisthat tourism-related issues have arisen requiring new tourism policy formulation. This can occur at any level of stakeholders in the desired outcome -from local citizens to relations between and among nations. A rapid rise in tourist visits to popular 'gateway' or entry communities, whether the US National Forests in Colorado or Arizona or to cultural heritage sites such as Machu Picchu, Peru (shown in Figure 3 .1), have fostered unplanned tourism development. This has led to unexpected needs for formative tourism policies to cope with increased road congestion and pollution, potable water over-consumption, public utility resources depletion and real estate price escalation resulting in a scarcity of affordable housing for local citizens employed in the new hotels, car rental agencies and other travel-related businesses. As a result, tourism development revenues are not equally distributed. Furthermore, these overly popular original destinations then become degraded, putting at risk their inherent environmental, sociocultural and heritage values important to both tourism and local level quality of life. Thus, a well-known, mature tourism destination such as Machu Picchu must, for the sake of its own future success as a world heritage destination, reformulate its tourism policies regarding the sustainability of its infrastructure and provision of quality tourism products and services.\n\nOther drivers for tourism policy analysis at the formative phase can be to evaluate a decision on the part of a tourism organization, destination or entire industry sector to participate in new technology. A powerful example of this at the tourism organization and destination management levels is provided by the 11 September 2001, terrorist airplane attacks in the United States on the New York City World Trade Center towers and the US Pentagon outside Washington, DC. Bill Hanbury, president of the Washington DC Convention and Visitors Corporation, was confronted by a 'new' and historic event in the United States that, at large, severely affected travel to and within the United States and the District of Columbia (DC). The US east coast suffered region-wide telephone outages on September 11 preventing President Hanbury's communication with his own employees as well as with DC public officials. Within days after September 11, he developed an unplanned, unanticipated formative tourism policy methodology for the creation of a reliable, networked alternative emergency information communication system encompassing the DC convention centre and US national capital region as a whole. The true value of this formative phase tourism policy for heightened communication preparedness fortunately to date has not been measurable in a comparable emergency situation (Hanbury, 2002) . This underscores the challenge in data collection in conducting formative phase tourism policy research.\n\nSimilarly, development phase tourism policy analysis is extremely important in many instances as it enables evaluation of policy implementation midstream. In 1999, for example, the Government of Belize established a new tourism policy placing high priority on tourism as a preferential development option with a focus on the cruise ship sector. In addition to international tourism promotion to Belize, the results also included a development phase tourism policy plan for environmental compliance for live-aboard passenger vessels, including cruise ships visiting Belize Harbour. It was premised on reassurances to Belize local tourism industry stakeholders that efforts would be made by the Department of the Environment in conjunction with the Fisheries Department and Belize Tourism Board to ensure the sustainability of the Belize tourism industry as a whole. New tourism policy rules and regulations were developed covering such issues as anchoring of cruise ships, waste disposal and passenger recreational activities onboard, such as requiring the purchase of seasonal fish and locally grown produce versus imported food. Onshore, tourism policy rules included requirements for the preservation of coral reefs during tourist diving and snorkeling activities, among others. As the cruise industry to Belize progresses, a monitoring system put in place now assists in a review and ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of the tourism development intentions of the tourism policy plan (Toy, 2004) .\n\nMany examples exist of summative phase tourism policy analysis which evaluates long-standing policy issues and accepted norms and doctrines for continued validity. This phase often provides the most available opportunities for semester-long student tourism policy case studies and/or research projects. For example, when the citizens of the US State of Colorado in 1994 voted to oppose the continuation of an existing state tax for state tourism marketing, Colorado fell in three years from the top five to 17th place in US state travel destinations (Sommars, 1997, pp. 16-21) . Only a short duration was required for summative evaluation of the adverse results of the tax policy eliminating funding for tourism marketing and promotion to Colorado. Summative phase tourism policy research requires that evaluation questions be matched with appropriate information gathering techniques, the data collected and analysed, and tourism policy information and advice provided to public and private sector officials and other interested parties.\n\nAnother example of summative phase tourism policy analysis would be to study tourism issues serving as indicators of improved relations among neighbouring economies. With an overarching goal to improve relations between Pakistan and India, the objective is to create international tourism between the two countries to gain greater mutual understanding among citizens and increased currency exchange. Tourism facilitation includes air rights policy to create air routes between the two countries and border crossing policy to speed visa approvals. Measurable tourism policy issues in the summative evaluation might include the number of flown routes and visa inquiries and permits issued (Figure 3 .2).\n\nIn conclusion of this section, one word about methodological approaches for the study of tourism policy, whatever the evaluations phase. Tourism policy provides a lively domain for contemporary quantitative and qualitative research -or a mixture of both. Comparative case study research, used in support of a larger tourism policy critical analysis framework, provides an especially rich laboratory. \n\nWhy are ongoing evaluations of tourism policy issues in all contexts important? It is because of tourism's integrative role in triggering growth -for better or worse in some cases -across multiple sectors of local, state/provincial, regional, national and international business commerce and services industries worldwide. Tourism's performance as an optimal growth multiplier in economic development for a large majority of modern economies matches up well against current given and future perceived needs. Not always, but often, tourism is viewed as fungible across the spectrum of economic, sociocultural and environmental aspects of development -a premier standing as well as a tall order for tourism policy issues.\n\nSustainable tourism, sex tourism, traveller safety and security and health and medical tourism, among others are examples of sub-factors involving regulation, planning and public policy related to tourism. As significant in the future as they are today, such issues are covered in greater depth in Chapter 10 'Tourism Policy Issues for Tomorrow'.\n\nEven within one tourism industry segment, multiple issues exist that require tourism policy and planning. For example, international airline industries carry cargo and passengers making air rights and safety issues consummate. Cargo is rarely checked for bombs whereas domestic travellers' luggage is thoroughly checked. Effecting change to include cargo inspection could lead to a $3.6 billion dollar cost to the industry (Frank, 2005, p. 01a). With aviation air rights, it is a function, in a sense, of who owns the air and what means are used to protect the citizens while allowing air traffic. Tourism policy in this arena collides with privacy rights and business profits versus traveller safety and security issues, as acutely experienced by both international leisure and business travellers since September 11.\n\nFurthermore, airlines often are seen as a major catalyst in conducting business. City managers for smaller cities see airlines as an integral part of attracting business (De Lollis and Hansen, 2002) . Colleges also see airlines as a key component to recruiting students (Brush and Straut, 2005, p.1p, 1c) . Hence, city managers must address both business and college needs as well as tourists.\n\nPolicy as created by elected officials can demonstrate which path to take on ethical issues in tourism. Currently, countries such as Thailand are experiencing an increase in tourism demand due to sex tourism (tourism activities which lead to sexual activity, particularly involving children). 'In 1998, the International Labour Organization reported its calculations that 2-14 per cent of the gross domestic product of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand derives from sex tourism. In addition, while Asian countries, including Thailand, India and the Philippines, have long been prime destinations for child sex tourists, in recent years, tourists have increasingly travelled to Mexico and Central America for their sexual exploits as well' (Nair, 2006) . Countries which are starved for hard foreign currency often look the other way as the cash flows in (Nair) . Western governments, including the United States, are now enacting laws which allow prosecution for sex tourism and the tourists despite the crimes taking place in foreign soil. Existing laws make it illegal to travel with the intent to have sex with a minor. Proposals for new laws that would make it illegal to have sex with a child in another country are now being pursued. Policy creation and implementation is complex and difficult to implement as the activities are international in scope, with victims and perpetuators coming from different countries. Further complicating this situation is the fact that each country, in many cases, has jurisdiction over only part of the criminal activity. To give more force to existing laws, a bill was introduced in the US Government on 28 April 2005, entitled the 'End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005.' The bill included a provision that would amend the language specifically to state that individuals engaging in sexual activity can be charged with a criminal offense as 'a purchaser of commercial sexual activities'. Passage of this amendment would clarify for federal prosecutors that enforcement of the law can and should be used to prosecute US-based sex tour operators (Equality Now, 2006) . Further efforts to eliminate child sex tourism are being pursued by the tourism industry itself.\n\nEuropean airlines are showing videos on their long-haul flights, which inform travellers of the laws against child sex tourism. The Untied Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) established a Child Prostitution and Tourism Watch Task Force, whose goals are to 'prevent, uncover, isolate and eradicate' the exploitation of children in the sex trade. The International Federation of Women's Travel Organizations (IFWTO) holds seminars across the United States and globally to educate their members about the problems of child sex tourism and what they can do to help.\n\nIn 1994, the Universal Federation of Travel Agents' Association (UFTAA) was the first tourism industry organization to adopt the Child and Travel Agents' Charter. In 1996, the members of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) unanimously passed a resolution condemning the commercial sexual exploitation of children.\n\n\u2022 A 'No Child Sex Tourism' logo has been adopted worldwide by industry organizations that are actively working to prevent and eliminate child prostitution. These sticker-logos can be obtained from the IFWTO. \u2022 In 1996, the International Hotel and Restaurant Association passed a resolution against the sexual exploitation of children and published a leaflet urging its members to help stop child sex tourism. \u2022 In Europe, tour operators have adopted codes of conduct for agents to combat sex tourism (ECPAT, 2006) .\n\nIn other words, various approaches to implementing tourism policy goals are being used to fight sex tourism. While these efforts do not use the force of law, the approaches do include moral persuasion for both the industry and the consumer. The question remains whether voluntary tourism policy compliance is enough in the face of this tragic human activity.\n\nAs the recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic demonstrated, health concerns are now a major factor in tourism. In some cases, the concerns for health are positive for the industry. For example, the rapid growth in the health spa industry has created an upscale niche in the travel-for-health market; however, other health concerns have a negative impact on the industry such as SARS, AIDS and other contagious diseases that are spread much more rapidly in part because of tourism and its related activities. Should one country be able to prohibit or strongly discourage travel to another nation and effectively cripple another country's economy? Policy decisions on limiting travel to countries with an epidemic may result in a significant downturn in travel overall and, in turn, affect the supporting travel and tourism infrastructure worldwide. The SARS epidemic affected travel to Asian nations with a ripple effect that resulted in lower Visa credit card use. The Asian market 'was significantly affected by the downturn in tourism prompted by the outbreak of SARS, but volume has been returning to normal there in recent weeks', Visa said (Lee, 2003, p. 20) .\n\nOften medical travel offers another set of competing policy needs. As medical practices improve worldwide, many countries offer tourism combined with plastic surgery. 'The Confederation of Indian Industries estimates that 150,000 foreign patients came to India for treatment in 2004. And McKinsey & Co., an international consulting firm, estimates that outsourced medical care could bring India $2.2 billion a year by 2012' (Landers, 2005) .\n\nIssues centre on insurance, monitoring medical practices and malpractice -both insurance for the doctors and prosecution for poor medical services provided during medical tourism. At what level should citizens who are used to high levels of government intervention in medical practices expect the same protections when travelling in other countries?\n\nAnd, to what level should the governments of these countries of origin for medical tourism intervene to protect its citizens while abroad? This concern for citizens' medical safety is not limited to exposure to germs and viruses from other countries; the continued growth of adventure travel has resulted in more mishaps needing attention. Rescue missions, field emergency medicine -the appropriateness of government resources being used to aid people who undertake risky travel behaviour -have all come to the forefront as tourists increasingly explore multiple environments and seek new travel experiences worldwide.\n\nAs a result of September 11 and the spate of terrorist bombings throughout the world, safety for groups is a leading policy issue for tourism and safety officials. Policy clashes between privacy and safety abound. There are personal privacy issues such as luggage checks, personal scans and body checks versus the need to ensure that the person and their belongings are weapon free. Information conflicts are common -access to tourism data routinely collected (name, address, credit card information, personal preferences) and who is allowed to access such information.\n\nTo what extent should governments be allowed to view and use the information gathered by various tourism entities (particularly airline computerized reservation and Personal Information Number/PIN data)? Ongoing debate centres on the legality of expanded use of the US Department of Homeland Security data-mining program called Automated Targeting System. Its expansion and redesign from cargo screening to create a vast database of terrorism risk assessments including name, date of birth, flight itineraries, credit card information and customs inspector's interview notes for every traveller who enters or leaves the country has triggered an information ownership and security contest between the government and airlines. Outcries from the US American Civil Liberties Union regarding privacy issues also include concerns regarding the unauthorized sale of such information for marketing purposes. How can this traveller information be used and by whom; and at what point should there be tourism policy interventions by private sectors and governments on controlling access to such information? Tourism brings clashing values to the forefront. Privacy versus security, freedom to move around versus safety are two such examples, and both issues then conflict with a locality or travel company's right to economic freedom. Policy formulation helps guide government officials attempting to weigh these factors in decision-making and planning.\n\nSpace tourism is one of hottest new tourism activities today. Issues arising from this present new, creative requirements in tourism policy and planning. One of the contending issues, logically, is overall investment costs of which the launch itself is a large part. It is believed that the only potential means for significant reduction of the recurrent launch cost, which results in a stimulation of human space colonization, is to make the launcher reusable, to increase its reliability and to make it suitable for new markets such as mass space tourism. Space projects that have long-range aspects are very difficult to finance as all interested parties, even politicians, expect to see a reasonable benefit during their period of involvement or term in office. They want to be able to explain this investment to the investing companies or to the taxpayers. Planners are then forced to use benefit models instead of intuitive judgment to convince skeptical decision makers to support new investments in space. Benefit models provide insights into complex relationships and compel a better definition of goals and expected benefits to be gained from a new space venture.\n\nOne main objective as to why humans should explore space is to 'improve the quality of life'; and this is important to different interest groups -the operator of a space transportation system, the passenger and the government for various reasons. For example, the operator is strongly interested in profit, the passenger's interest is in amusement, while the government is primarily interested in self-esteem, prestige and increased national security. Each perspective leads to different individual satisfaction levels. For example, on April 22, 2007, US billionaire Charles Simonyi, 58, a native of Hungary who helped design Microsoft Word and Excel, landed in the Kazakh steppe in a Russian space capsule after completing a two-week, $25 million, voyage of his childhood dreams to the international space station (Washington Post, April 22, 2007, A21) . And Simonyi is not the first and far from the last space tourist, following 'in the footsteps of Dennis Tito, Mark Shuttleworth, Gregory Olsen and Anousheh Ansari -all of whom have also traveled to the international space station aboard Russian rockets in trips brokered by US-based Space Adventures Ltd.' (A21). Combined, these interests contribute to optimization in the development process for reusable launch vehicles (American Institute of Physics in Goehlich, 2003) . Further discussion of this topic occurs in Chapter 10.\n\nThe significance of agriculture in social terms stems largely from a community's desire to retain agriculture's aesthetic and heritage values and their contribution to sense of place and charm. Consistent with the findings from US studies that indicate resident attitudes are influenced by 'amenity value' rather than production value, perceptions about agriculture find many individuals consider agriculture very important or of higher importance but they have little understanding regarding the actual situation of agriculture in terms of economic contribution, benefits to the region, land uses and the implications of changes in agricultural production in the future. The direct aims are to generate jobs and increase returns to farmers while the indirect aims are landscape conservation through retention of agriculture, attitudinal changes in the farming community to farming practices, marketing and diversification and sustainable development that links the farming community to other sectors of the economy (Figure 3.3) .\n\nWhat does a destination need to do to become an agritourism attraction? Guidelines vary from country to country, and regimes can be highly bureaucratic. In the Veneto region of Italy, farmers providing holidays are limited to hosting 30 overnight guests per night for a maximum of 160 days per year and must sell over 50 per cent of the food they produce to tourists. In Britain, Germany and elsewhere, there are stringent health and safety controls, including fire regulations and rules governing contact with farm animals (Gumbel, 2004) . All in all, agritourism is blooming worldwide and cultivating the need for tourism policy and planning in this emerging tourism sector. \n\nWhy are tourism issues more complex when introduced into the tourism policy domain? Understanding the interrelated nature of tourism industry sectors requires monitoring and evaluation when tourism policy issues are involved. Measurement and monitoring are essential to transportation systems that move people, products and services, which, in turn, make up a major component of the international tourism industry. Similarly, restaurants and entertainment organizations serve local residents and tourists alike and are involved in business activities (such as special events, conferences and meeting planning) that are demanded by both populations. This duality adds additional complexities to the planning process for simultaneous usage in areas accommodating both tourist and host community needs. Seasonal activities with peak period use, as in ski or beach resort locations, greatly benefit from tourism policy, planning, development and evaluation in understanding 'best use' growth and sustainability measures.\n\nPolicy uses tools such as zoning to aid tourism development while mitigating the potentially negative impacts of growth and development. Minas Gerais State in Brazil, for example, currently is experiencing minimal water contamination. This situation is expected to destabilize as water demands rise due to increases in tourism-related activities (increased influx of visitors accompanied by a growing residential workforce supporting the industry). Zoning to protect the natural resources, which in turn protects water quality, is being recommended. In Colorado, USA, zoning has been used in an effort to mediate the competing needs of the tourists and the local community. 'Over the past decade, county and city officials, tourism leaders and local ranchers in Routt County, Colorado, have worked together to preserve the remaining agricultural open space' (Parizzi et al., 2001, p. 57) . With a change in zoning laws, one county adopted regulations that encouraged clustering homes to preserve open space. Housing lot size requirements were reduced allowing developers to build more units using a smaller footprint overall. In exchange, the developers must set aside undeveloped land as open space. In other words, zoning concerns involve allocation of scarce land, public and private utility, and public support services and resources -what to put where and who to best undertake and accommodate tourism policy goals and objectives are important agenda items.\n\nA great majority of travel and tourism companies worldwide are small-to-medium-sized enterprises. Via the World Wide Web, strategically managed smaller companies now can compete with larger companies for international visibility and positioning. This combination of attributes places the tourism industry in an excellent position to achieve world leadership in the movement and management of capital and information embodied in global trade in service industries. For this reason, tourism services industries dominate supply and demand for travel-related reservation systems. The case study developed by Zachary Rozga included at the end of this chapter illustrates this synergy and access to power in terms of information distribution on the Websites of small family-run tourism hotel businesses throughout South Africa, now linked with the rest of the world via simply designed Web pages in a communication telecommunications network called the World Hotel Link.\n\nSince the late 1970s, growth of airline and car rental computerized reservations systems has occurred rapidly. The hotel industry lagged behind, starting later in the 1980s with the advent of THISCO (the hotel information system coalition), a hotel reservation system opening first-time Internet access to tourist hotel bookings online with later links to online airline reservations systems. The tremendous expansion and diversification over the last two decades of online tourism products and services (ticketing, car rentals, hotels rooms, transportation, tour operators, etc.) beyond basic travel services formerly provided by airline computer reservation systems, such as American Airlines' Sabre CRS, typify the high value now placed on the collection and (re)distribution of tourism consumer information and financial expenditures (much of it via credit cards).\n\nTourism and taxes have brought the industry to the forefront of travellers' concern. While seeking the benefits of the industry, travellers often do not want to support the infrastructure. As noted earlier, Colorado experienced a large decrease in tourism when the travel-marketing budget was reduced. Taxing residents to support the tourism industry is as unpopular as other taxes; therefore, city officials often tax the visitors. Councilor Bob Finsland from Superior, Wisconsin, USA, has gone on record as saying the extra revenue could go toward tourism facilities and events, such as hockey tournaments, thereby attracting organizations to host similar events in the city. 'I think there are a lot of ways to use that money wisely as far as tourism development goes', Finsland said. 'We don't want to raise the taxes on individual citizens of Superior. We don't want to raise the taxes to the individual motel owners. We want to raise the taxes for the people who stay at these hotels and pass through our city' (Reinke, 2006) .\n\nAnother example of this thought process emanates from the USA Commonwealth of Virginia -' the additional tax shall be designated and spent for the development and improvement of the Virginia Performing Arts Foundation's facilities in Richmond, for promoting the use of the Richmond Centre, and for promoting tourism, travel or business that generates tourism and travel in the Richmond metropolitan area' (Virginia Tax Code, \u00a758.1-3823). Other Virginian localities, such as Williamsburg, levy a flat $2.00 fee per occupied room night in lodging establishments for marketing the historic triangle of Williamsburg, James City County and Yorktown, which is shown in Figure 3 .4.\n\nInternationally, European finance ministers are leaning toward legislation taxing airline passengers to finance development aid for foreign countries. The EU airline industry is fighting this new tax saying it threatens jobs and tourism (Tardy, 2005, p. 3). Tax issues are divisive -on the one hand, they are necessary for generating revenue to finance the tourism industry. On the other hand, travellers are growing weary of the added expense to the trip. In some places, auto rental taxes can be as much as 40 per cent of the bill.\n\nFinance for tourism development often requires an international commitment. The World Bank is heavily involved with committing monetary resources to sustainable tourism projects. Through the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank grants long-term interest free loans and grants for the purpose of supporting economic growth, reducing poverty and improving living conditions. 'IDA's long-term nointerest loans pay for programs that build the policies, institutions, infrastructure and human capital needed for equitable and environmentally sustainable development. IDA's grants go to poor countries already vulnerable to debt or confronting the ravages of HIV/AIDS or natural disasters' (WorldBank.org).\n\nThree factors determine eligibility for assistance:\n\n\u2022 Relative poverty, defined as Gross National Product (income) per person below an established threshold, currently US $965 per year. \u2022 Lack of credit worthiness to borrow on market terms and therefore a need for concessional resources to finance the country's development program. \u2022 Good policy performance, defined as the implementation of economic and social policies that promote growth and poverty reduction (WorldBank.org).\n\nThe top 10 borrower countries in fiscal year 2005, according to the US World Bank, are shown in Table 3 .1. Two examples of World Bank/IDA supported projects are Mozambique's initiatives in conservation and tourism development. The first initiative resulted in support with an 'IDA credit of US $20 million to support the conservation of biodiversity and natural ecosystems as well as promote economic growth and development based on the sustainable use of natural resources by local communities in Mozambique' (M2 Presswire, 2005) . This demonstrates the interconnectedness of tourism and other municipal functions -and, therefore, requires policies that cross departmental boundaries. IDA has also supported a project emphasizing ecological and commercially sustainable solid waste collection and disposal services in Montenegro coastal municipalities, which are needed to maintain a clean, environmentally attractive coastal area for tourism development. It is hoped that the project also will help develop the sector's institutional policy and regulatory framework and benefit tourism prospects by eliminating solid waste collection and disposal problems negatively affecting coastal tourist areas.\n\nAlternative sources for financing include bank loans and bonds. Often poor nations turn to these sources when they have exhausted the IDA backing. Developing nations often turn to wealthy countries for support through direct loans -where the bank backs the money and bonds are floated, then used as collateral for the loans. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation has agreed on an IDA loan totalling 5.732bn yen (US $52.874m) with Egypt, for the Borg El Arab International Airport Modernization Project. The development consists of the construction of an air terminal with a capacity of one million passengers and 4000 tons of cargo annually, as well as improvements in related facilities at the airport, 40 km southwest of Alexandria (JBIC 2005).\n\nGuam, a US territory in the Pacific Ocean, can issue bonds that are exempt from federal, state and local income taxes. The island's growing tourism industry and a planned increase in US military personnel point to economic developments necessitating more spending on infrastructure. Infrastructure improvements, however, financed by military construction funds will not address all of Guam's critical infrastructure, essential services and economic development needs.\n\nProceeds from bonds sales would be reissued in the form of loans to finance reconstruction projects. Like the bond banks that already serve 12 US states, a US territory bond bank would use federal grant money as collateral to guarantee the loans. The concept of a bond bank was discussed in 19 April, 2006, at a meeting of the Interagency Group on Insular Areas, which coordinates federal policy toward Guam, American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands (McConnell, 2006) .\n\nGrants are a preferred method of obtaining money for tourism development because no repayment is required; however, one condition often set forth is that matching amounts of money must be raised to receive the grants. Other stipulations may include partnerships or other support mechanisms. A project in Mozambique, which received IDA money, also received grants. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) Board, which approved the credit was also financed by a US $10 million grant in accordance with the work program approved by the GEF Council in October 2005 as well as a US $3.7 million grant from the Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) Fund ( M2 Presswire, 2005) Weimer and Vining (2005) state that in its simplest definition 'policy analysis is client-oriented advice relevant to public decisions and informed by social values' (p. 24) and offer their conclusion that, '[t]he professions of planning and public administration have moved much closer to the policy analysis paradigm in recent years ' (p. 25) . In other words, anytime an action or activity related to tourism may have an effect on a group or location is what, when, and where tourism policy issues matter the most at the destination management level Tourism policy at its best provides direction for the management of destination organizations around a unified strategic plan without which people may inadvertently or intentionally enact conflicting laws or rules negating tourism policy planning attributes. Preservation of status quo versus environmental sustainability for tourism purposes will continue as a debate worldwide in the areas of tourist access to world monuments and cultural heritage sites. National park year-round recreational access via snowmobiles and other off-road vehicles versus limited off-season use in support of nature and wildlife preservation are permanent issues in tourism policy evaluation in most regions of the world. State-controlled forest fires versus unregulated wild fires also challenge tourism policy formation in management of recreation with preservation goals.\n\nOther significant issues related to zoning are exemplified in efforts by the Italian hotel industry working with municipal government to manage uncontrolled growth in hotel construction resulting in unsafe hotels built too close together marring historic views. Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, USA, for example, a major US battlefield, also provides both a long history and interesting future for tourism policy and planning regarding the impact of controlled growth as it relates to marketing and demand. Gettysburg deconstructed a privately built and owned look-out tower to 're-authenticate' the original battlefield landscape. Beach communities such as Ocean City, Maryland on the US Atlantic coast, too, must grapple with high tourist numbers during 'spring flings' or college fun tourism. The effect on local residents experiencing seasonally related tourism's 'bombardment' from the outside world requires coordination of tourism policy and planning efforts.\n\nThrough all the stages of tourism policy formation, development and implementation, one sees the conflicting needs that call for effective actions and evaluation. Tourism policy provides direction on what action is appropriate. In the formative stage, policy addresses new concerns such as disease or terrorism. At the development phase, policy addresses on-going issues. This is particularly relevant for developing countries and other regions of the world addressing economic, sociocultural and environmental sustainability issues, such as air and water pollution, crowding, degradation and depletion of tourism resources. Lastly, there is the summative stage where existing tourism policy results are reviewed for continued relevancy and efficacy. Tourism policy and planning evolve as the industry itself grows generating new requirements for areas such as commerce activity, telecommunications, sustainability and land use.\n\nWhy tourism policy issues point to -and will matter so dramatically in -the future is the way this chapter ends while ongoing evaluation of how contending issues central to today's tourism policy development and implementation affect future populations just begins. Adoption of tourism policy issues sustaining all of tourism's environments -natural and physical, human and man-made -would seem the greatest contribution still possible for tourism to make.\n\nZachary Rozga, The George Washington University Master of Tourism Administration Graduate, President of GeoSavvy Development, Cape Town, South Africa, www.geosavvydev.com, zachary.rozga@gmail. com. To access this and other GW web-based tourism policy case studies, please go to the following link to the GW/American University Trade and Environment (TED) Database (www.american.edu/ted).\n\nThe question this case study attempts to answer is, how have governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) used information and communication technology (ICT) to improve development of smallto-medium-sized tourism enterprises (SMTEs)?\n\nSMTEs have been targeted in a number of countries as a sector to be focused on for overall economic development of traditionally impoverished and undeveloped lands and peoples. Tourism has been one sector deemed most appropriate for rural developing nations because the point of sale in the commerce is generally in the rural area and provides an alternative form of income generation to traditional agrarian methods.\n\nThis case study focuses on a new online booking agent that was created specifically to attend to the needs of the developing world and support SMTEs -The World Hotel Link (WHL).\n\nThe Pro-Poor Tourism Partnership says, \"One of the critical issues for poor producers is often access to the market -access to the established industry and to tourists\". Most small hotels and guesthouses and local NGOs have little or no opportunity to market to tourists via the Internet, thus they gain little share of the dollars tourists spend. Most tourism dollars end up offshore. Typically, only US $10-20 of every US $100 spent by the tourist in developing countries remains in the country. According to United Nations Environment Program, of each US $100 spent on a package tour, only around US $5 actually stays in a developing country's economy.\n\nThe George Washington University's International Institute of Tourism Studies (GWU/IITS) commissioned a survey of worldwide tourism development practitioners, academics and stakeholders to assess what issues were concerned with donor-funded tourism development and what they perceived to be the most important issues facing tourism. The number one response from the survey in the \"poorest performance\" category was market access for tourism development projects (GWU/IITS, 2004) .\n\nIn the developed world, some innovative nations have grasped the importance of effective clustering and the use of networks to spread the economic impact of tourism through proper ICT usage. The Australian Federal Government has realized the impact that the Internet has on promotion of the tourism product, and they also understand the need to have a consistent tourism product. Tourism is a highly fragmented industry that is made up of numerous SMTE (95-98 per cent of all tourism companies fall into this category), and the success of the industry is based on the sum of the parts. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources created the policy of Australia dotcom to aid each and every SMTE to utilize the Internet.\n\nIn line with that thinking a small team of tourism, sustainability and technology specialists set out to find an ICT-driven solution to market access for developing world SMTE accommodation providers. The outcome, the World Hotel Link (WHL), offers a unique online platform to help small and mid-sized accommodation providers market sustainable tourism to the independent traveller. Launched as an IFC technical assistance project for hotels and guesthouses in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos in 2004, it is now a private company whose various sites in an everincreasing number of countries (30 plus in May 2006) attract about 5000 visitors a day.\n\nAlthough parallels to the WHL (www.worldhotel-link.com) model can be drawn with Expedia, Orbitz and Hostelworld, it is different in that it has been designed specifically for the developing world, seeking to:\n\n\u2022 bridge the digital divide \u2022 deliver pro-poor outcomes and \u2022 drive the uptake of sustainable tourism practices.\n\nEach destination is served by a local e-marketplace operator (MPO) who is responsible for collecting and managing content for the Websites, responding promptly to travellers on the booking system and interfacing with accommodation providers. The local MPO serves as an ICT intermediary for product owners who may not communicate in English, possess technical skills or have access to ICT facilities. Meanwhile, the global WHL acts as an intermediary for the local MPOs by undertaking central coordination; improving technology development/support; and undertaking Web marketing, data hosting and online payment gateways, and so on. WHL has been built from the ground up with technology specifically designed to make the franchise MPO model work even for accommodation providers who do not have ICTs including telephones, computers or other easy avenues of communication.\n\nThe following model is a representation of how WHL's initiatives are implemented into less developed areas and the how the \"Tourism Cluster\" by-product is created (Figure 3 .5). The model on the left shows the relationship in an environment without an ICT intermediary. The product and market have a major disconnection, and information flow between them is stopped. In the model on the right, the product is accessible to the market through the intermediary plus the market can provide tastes and demands to the product. As the cycle continues, the process should enhance the product, increasing adherence to the demand of the market, thus providing a better and more sustainable product responsive to market demand.\n\nIn addition to bringing SMTEs into the global marketplace, WHL is working with mainstream operators who are trying to make a difference in their destination. To demonstrate the power of ICT networks, WHL is pioneering a new \"Sustainable Tourism Ranking\" into the booking engine. WHL is leveraging the network of sites and clients -independent travellers booking via the sites -to apply an eBay-style supplier-buyer ratings system to get sustainable tourism on the radar screen.\n\nTo date, sustainable tourism has always remained a fringe niche market and not had the profound impact that experts say it does. Under the WHL approach, accommodation providers display their product in a way that helps travellers understand what they are doing whether from an environmental, social or cultural standpoint to care for the local destination. Displayed visually as a \"Caring for the Destination\" rating, there is an opportunity for travellers to provide feedback and inform other travellers about this product or activity. As demand grows, more suppliers will want to be listed with this rating.\n\nWHL sets up and supports local Internet portals that enable smaller hotels and guesthouses to be marketed on the Internet. WHL works as a franchise. Local partners with local knowledge own and operate the local WHL portals while being connected seamlessly to WHL's global network. WHL provides the technical platform, the web marketing and management support.\n\nThe hotels on WHL are usually three-star or less and often depend on walk-in guests, which means their income is unstable. This also means their employees face seasonal unemployment. Increased market access through the WHL allows these SMTEs to become less dependent on walk-ins and have a more regular income, which in turn benefits everyone -hotels have lower employee turnover and provide more stable jobs. It also means more secure income for people in the associated businesses that offer products and services linked to the tourism sector.\n\nIndependent travel is the fastest growing segment of the travel industry.\n\nA 2004 International Finance Corporation study on Eco-Lodges put the global independent traveller market at 50 per cent. Many travellers use guidebooks and the Internet to select destinations and accommodation and rarely use tour packages. Thus they spend and leave more money locally. By serving smaller accommodation providers, WHL is making it easier for independent travellers to find interesting travel experiences, which in turn translates into more bookings for local SMTEs.\n\nWHL operates as a global franchise network with local ownership of the booking service in each destination. This means the commissions and booking jobs remain in the country. While WHL charges a monthly service fee to franchise owners, it represents only a small portion of their revenue.\n\nSmall local accommodation providers have problems reaching the market.\n\nThere are large numbers of interesting and unique places to stay in guidebooks, but few are online. Some do not even have a phone number. Thus tourists book only with the hotels they can find on the Web. Because WHL franchisees are local people on the ground with local knowledge, they can actively coach and support the smallest guesthouses who otherwise would not be online or able to receive advance bookings. WHL provides access -a major obstacle for SMTEs -where others cannot.\n\nThrough its sustainability ratings and traveller feedback, WHL encourages local SMTEs to develop and manage interesting traveller experiences through connections with local NGOs and community groups that operate orphanages, schools or hospitals and eco-or cultural projects. Typically, these initiatives benefit the poorest and most vulnerable in the local community, as well as preserving the local culture and environment for future generations.\n\nThe approach taken in most regions of the world in driving the uptake of sustainable tourism practices has been driven largely by industry experts and government. It has involved a top-down approach with little effort to engage travellers and has resulted in the production of numerous codes, standards and certification or labelling schemes. The fact is, however, that despite significant expense in developing and promoting these approaches over the past 15 years, industry has largely ignored them, and the travelling public has almost no idea what they are. Even the jargon used extensively by industry players to describe the sector (e.g., terms such as sustainable tourism, responsible travel, eco-travel, geo-savvy, interactive travellers, etc.) remains unfamiliar to the majority of travellers.\n\nDespite this, there is growing evidence that travellers are sensitive to issues of environmental, social and cultural degradation and would prefer, all things being equal, to support those industry players who are doing a good job -economically, environmentally, socially and culturally. This is particularly true of independent travellers. Further, there is a shift occurring from \"things to see\" type of travel to \"things to experience\" as travellers seek to connect more closely with the local destination. These travellers are seeking a more genuine travel experience deriving from a closer interaction with the local communities and the natural environment.\n\nRecognizing the failure of the certification approach trying to encourage the industry to meet minimum \"standards\", Worldhotel-link.com Limited (WHL -an accommodation booking company) has developed a new approach with a strong bias toward engaging SMTE accommodation providers and travellers. In this model, SMTE accommodation providers undertaking any activities which preserve a sense of place or are in some way caring for or preserving the destination, socially and/or environmentally, are provided a free branding opportunity on the web (a chance to differentiate themselves), intended to appeal to the growing body of interested (i.e., geo-savvy, responsible, interactive) travellers. These travellers are then encouraged to provide feedback, which is published online, informing other travellers about the initiative (e.g., whether it is real or simply a \"green wash\"; whether the initiative \"moved\" them;\n\nwhether the accommodation management/staff \"walk the talk\", etc.). The traveller feedback, if positive, should encourage more like-minded travellers to select the accommodation provider, improving occupancy and returns. By showing SMTE accommodation providers that doing good is good business, this should over time encourage more SMTE accommodation providers to start incorporating initiatives which care for the destination.\n\nIn doing the work of collecting information about SMTE accommodation providers to put online, WHL identified many small SMTEs actively engaged in projects, which, in their own way, were positive steps toward improving sustainable outcomes for the destination. None of the initiatives were of themselves \"certifiable\", but they all were valid. They were meaningful to the SMTE involved and addressed specific local needs. Examples included employing and training orphan children, supporting local schools, running a turtle hatchery, restoring a damaged coral reef, teaching traditional building skills, supporting volunteer workers and restoring historical buildings.\n\nWHL then started to write up some of these initiatives as \"brand differentiators\" for the respective accommodation providers, highlighting for travellers what the accommodation providers were doing. Some initiatives were small, some large, but many offered the guests either a unique experience or, at least, an opportunity to feel that by staying with this accommodation provider they were doing some good. As a small SMTE, trying to differentiate yourself only on price, location and facilities is a slippery slope. Good service is a given, so what you have left as an option is really related to selling a unique experience, and it is this WHL is tapping. This then led to the idea of an \"eBay style\" bottom-up sustainable tourism marketing model. The SMTE accommodation provider (the supplier) markets their initiative(s) now a core part of their product, and the traveller (the buyer) after staying at the property gives them a rating and provides feedback online for other travellers to read and evaluate in making their buying decision.\n\nFirst, it is free for the SMTE accommodation provider to participate.\n\nSecond, it is up to the accommodation provider what they undertake. This means that programs are more likely to be addressing perceived local needs either at the enterprise level or the community level. This increases ownership. Third, WHL is providing a direct link to a commercial benefit. If travellers like what the accommodation provider is doing and provide positive feedback, more business results. Doing good becomes good business. Fourth, travellers are engaged. They can now feel good about where they are staying and provide positive feedback for others. A virtuous circle has been built.\n\nRegular traveller feedback on the authenticity of the initiatives and the commitment of the SMTEs will play a powerful role in keeping the checks and balances and in driving improvement. This approach also ensures that costs are kept low. Most of the traditional certification systems currently rely on external funding, and Font (2005) \n\nThe scheme is inclusive of all stakeholders. It does not detract from traditional top-down expert certification rather it complements it with a truly bottom-up traveller and industry driven component. The WHL vision is to get enough SMTEs involved in this approach at the destination level to start to shape the destination.\n\nThe developing world Tourism is a major economic sector worldwide and especially in developing countries. According to the World Bank's World Development Indicators Report 2002, more than 70 per cent of the world's poorest countries rely on tourism as a key engine of economic growth. Poorer countries have the most to gain from pro-poor tourism initiatives. But they are also the most vulnerable to the negative effects of mass tourism, in terms of social, environmental and cultural degradation.\n\nInternational -In the developing world, many individual private sector players, government employees and NGOs have come to understand the importance of the Internet and its effect in the tourism industry. However, many of these players have not understood the expanse and change of the Internet toward commercial ventures as opposed to purely informational. In tourism jargon, this has become known as \"booking versus looking\". Even when actors have grasped this concept, they have not understood the breadth of sites that exist on the web. Even subregional sites get lost in the myriad of tourism Websites that now exist.\n\nOn the other hand, the large well-established international booking agents (Expedia, Travelocity, Opodo, etc.) have not been able to figure out how to sell the developing world to its clientele, mainly due to the fact that there is a greater proliferation of individually owned SMTEs in the developing world that is not on any mainframe booking systems.\n\nWHL is the first booking agent that has understood both the importance of local presence (the MPO) and international branding and marketing.\n\nNational -In the developing world, at the national level, there is a real misunderstanding of tourism as a private sector activity. Many times the decision makers at this level have no real tourism experience and do not understand how to market or sell at the enterprise level. Therefore, it is much easier to ignore the situation and focus on the nation as destination and allow the private sector to sort itself out. This attitude has a tendency to isolate nations and allow large private sector (and typically foreign-owned) operators to dominate the value chain. This is the exact behaviour that leads to offshore booking agents dominating the sales and not taking place in the nation. Also, with this attitude, very little information about the destination is maintained locally, increasing reliance on a foreign operator to manage the trip for the traveller out of fear.\n\nRegional -Regions within nations not only do not cooperate to sell the product but battle for individual travellers. Many times adversarial campaigns are undertaken with little understanding of growing the whole market. WHL helps to mitigate concerns by forcing an identity of destination and then by not discriminating who can and who cannot be listed in the destination. WHL will work to ensure that appropriate products are given equal status and add value to the destination.\n\nLocal -This is where WHL is at its strongest. As described in the ICT intermediation, many operators have no voice at all in the global tourism value chain. These single \"mom and pop\" SMTEs are completely ostracized from the mainstream tourism economy, even though they provide the most authentic experience. WHL has specifically engineered the franchise system to allow for adequate coverage to support these SMTEs (Figure 3 .6). \n\nFor nations that are attempting to use tourism as a means of economic stimulus for their country, they must consider the means at which the intended audience will receive this information. The Internet is a powerful tool and must be looked at as a means to broadcast the message about product. Instituting computers, e-mail, software and the Internet to populations of people who do not even have clean running water is a daunting task, yet it is necessary. The governments of countries need to look for innovative means to implement ICT into the rural areas that they are promoting for tourism.\n\nIn order to understand the importance of these policy implications, one must consider the sustainability of these projects. At this point, the largest barrier to sustainability is market access. The model depicted in Figure 3 .6 is a visual representation of information flow in rural destinations. In areas where most of the inhabitants have never used a telephone, the likelihood of Internet implementation is quite low.\n\nThe World Hotel Link concept currently looks at the accommodation portion of a trip. Tours encompass a much wider span of activities and products. The WHL concept should be broadened to capture the spectrum of products such as transportation, handicrafts, eco-activities, adventure sports, safaris, festivals, artistry, and so on.\n\nGovernments can learn a great deal about how to manage their destination by looking at the holistic approach that WHL employs from the private sector and find their role in the development process and focus on those activities. Too often government tries to play too large a role in tourism development and disconnects with the market and in the end the traveller.\n\nAs a model, the WHL platform could quite nicely work in other industries that affect the economies of the developing world.\n\nThe idea behind the policy of community-based tourism promotion is to protect the cultural heritage and value of the local population that some culture focused routes take place in. Some examples of where this has been extremely successful in the developed world are The Camino de Santiago in Northern Spain and Southern France and Hadrian's Wall in Northern England. Both of these destinations were driven by government policies to enhance rural livelihood through the promotion of cultural preservation and tourism.\n\nIn both cases, on macro-level planning, importance was placed on creating defined strings of clusters that were displayed and defined geographically using GIS and Internet technologies. Without the economies of scale for multiplying the budgets and efforts of local municipalities, they would never have been able to raise the amount of private sector or donor support. As well, the necessary infrastructural demands would not have been met to create an effective globally competitive destination.\n\nTourism historically has been criticized as a major detriment to the environment. The World Hotel Link ICT model attempts to engage the traveler as well as the host destination in tourism development that is environmentally sustainable."}
