{"title": "", "body": "Please begin by providing some general information about your role and experience: Rank the most important topic area as 5, and the least important topic area as 1. Only one ranking is permitted per topic.\n\nFor those working in a regional role, answer in relation to all the countries you know well, or pick a specific country and answer all questions in relation to that country 1. Community engagement 2. Service delivery models (numbers and type of health workers) 3. Speciality services and integration of disease specific programs 4. Continuity of patient care 5. Partnerships with non-government service providers Topics scored 4 and 5 will automatically appear, and panel members asked to suggest at least 1 and up to 3 specific areas where additional evidence would be useful for each of these two 'most important' topic areas.\n\nEach of the following cross-cutting themes may impact the accessibility and acceptability of primary health care services. From your perspective, how relevant is it to incorporate each of these themes in the design of primary health care research in your country?\n\nRank the most relevant theme 5, and the least relevant theme 1. Only one ranking is permitted per theme.\n\nRound 2 eDelphi 1. The evidence gaps in the following three screens relate to the organisation and models of primary health care in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nPlease rank each of these research topics from 1 to 3.\n\nTier 1 should include those topics of highest priority, and Tier 3 should include those topics of least priority. Use the following definition of priority tiers to guide your ranking:\n\nTier 1: Includes research gaps of high potential leverage, in which more evidence is likely to have a significant impact on strengthening PHC performance. Tier 2: Includes research gaps of moderate potential leverage, in which more evidence is somewhat likely to have an impact on strengthening PHC performance. Tier 3: Includes research gaps for which more evidence is unlikely to have an impact on strengthening PHC performance.\n\nWhat package of primary health care services is the most effective and appropriate for the population? What is the optimum mix of health workers at primary health care level?\n\nWhat is the most effective and sustainable primary health care service delivery model for the management of chronic diseases in a resource-constrained setting? How can we integrate electronic health records into mobile primary health care services?\n\nHow can task-shifting (e.g. use of non-physician health workers) be used to support the delivery of primary health care? What incentives will ensure the long-term availability of doctors at the primary health care level?\n\nWhat are the support needs of doctors who are caring for rural and remote communities?\n\nWhat systems of quality control and improvement can be effectively and sustainably implemented at the primary health care level? What is the difference between the expected and actual workload of individual members of the primary health care team? ii. Patient management tools How can we apply mHealth/eHealth technology to provide supportive supervision for community health workers? How can we use mHealth technology at the village level to improve preventative and promotive services?\n\nWhat are the limits placed on use of mHealth/eHealth by coverage of mobile networks, ownership of mobile phones, and literacy of those receiving messages? What strategies will improve co-ordination and communication between providers, including between public and private providers, and between rural and urban settings? How can we address the different barriers to continuity of patient care in urban and rural/remote areas?\n\niii. Integration of disease specific programs What is the impact on the wellbeing, motivation and workload of community health workers when integrating a new primary health care program? What are sustainable models of disease integration that would a) make best use of existing vertical programs, and b) strengthen primary health care? How should payers work with providers to design funding models that better support integrated care? How can administrators engage donors to better support integration through their funding models?\n\nWhat approaches to treating communicable diseases can be effectively transferred to the management of chronic diseases? How can we best integrate primary, secondary and tertiary care across the health sector?"}
