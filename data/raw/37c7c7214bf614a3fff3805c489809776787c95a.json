{"title": "NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE ROLES OF METALLOPROTEINASES IN NEURODEGENERATION AND NEUROPROTECTION", "body": "Proteolytic enzymes constitute around 2% of the human genome and are involved in many stages of cell development from fertilization to death (apoptosis). The identification of many novel proteases from genome-sequencing programs has suggested them as potential new therapeutic targets. In addition, several wellcharacterized metallopeptidases were recently shown to possess new biological roles in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. As a result of these studies, metabolism of the neurotoxic and inflammatory amyloid peptide (A) is considered as a physiologically relevant process with several metallopeptidases being suggested for the role of amyloid-degrading enzymes. These include the neprilysin (NEP) family of metalloproteinases (including its homologue endothelinconverting enzyme), insulin-degrading enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme, plasmin, and, possibly, some other enzymes. NEP also has a role in metabolism of sensory and inflammatory neuropeptides such as tachykinins and neurokinins. The existence of natural enzymatic mechanisms for removal of amyloid peptides has extended the therapeutic avenues in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neurodegeneration. The proteolytic events underlying AD are highly compartmentalized in the cell and formation of amyloid peptide from its precursor molecule APP (amyloid precursor protein) takes place both within intracellular compartments and in the plasma membrane, especially in lipid raft domains. Degradation of amyloid peptide by metallopeptidases can also be both intra-and extracellular depending on the activity of membrane-bound enzymes and their soluble partners. Soluble forms of proteases can be secreted or released from the cell surface through the activity of ''sheddases''-another group of proteolytic enzymes involved in key cellular regulatory functions. The activity of proteases involved in amyloid metabolism depends on numerous factors (e.g., genetic, environmental, age), and some conditions (e.g., hypoxia and ischemia) shift the balance of amyloid metabolism toward accumulation of higher concentrations of A. In this regard, regulation of the activity of amyloid-degrading enzymes should be considered as a viable strategy in neuroprotection.\n\nProteolysis represents one of the key processes underlying biological events from fertilization through development to death. In the human genome there are more than 500 proteases and homologues (almost 2% of the genome), many of whose physiological roles are yet to be identified and which may provide potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of human disease. At present there are 70 known human hereditary diseases caused by mutations in protease-coding genes (http:// www.uniovi.es/degradome/). Abnormal functioning of these genes are implicated in such pathologies as inflammatory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegeneration. Understanding of the role of these enzymes and their evolutionary conservation is important for design of appropriate drugs and therapeutic strategies. Other eukaryotic species whose genomes have been deciphered to date also possess a very high number of protease and protease-like genes which in the case of Drosophila melanogaster and mouse are even higher than in human (Rawlings et al., 2006) . The number of species in which proteases have now been identified is approaching 3000 (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/). Cysteine-, serine-, and metallopeptidases represent the major classes of peptidases; among these three classes, the metallopeptidase class is more consistently represented with the number of genes varying from 183 in Drosophila to 198 in mice (in human, 186). Two other classes have much higher diversity with the range in the number of genes for cysteine proteases from 76 in Drosophila to 153 in mice (Puente et al., 2003) . For the serine peptidases this range is even more pronounced: from 100 in Caenorhabditis elegans to 309 in Drosophila. There are a smaller number of aspartic proteinases, although some are of key therapeutic importance. This more conservative representation of metallopeptidases in the genomes of various species may reflect roles of these enzymes in more generic cellular functions and their unique catalytic properties which required water and metal ions for activation of the proteolytic (hydrolytic) process, which were carefully preserved in the course of evolution.\n\nThe metallopeptidases can be divided into 12 clans according to the type and number of metal ions required for their activity (Rawlings and Barrett, 2004) . This chapter will focus on two distinct zinc metallopeptidase families belonging to one of these clans, namely MA, whose representatives require zinc for their activity and contain one or two histidine residues in the zinc binding motif. The first of these metallopeptidase families is the M13 family represented by neprilysin [or neutral endopeptidase (NEP)] and the second is the M2 family represented by angiotensin-converting enzyme [or peptidyl dipeptidase (ACE)]. Members of each of these families have served as important drug targets, particularly in cardiovascular disease and, more recently, have provided insight into mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, especially from the point of view of processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its products in Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n\nThe discovery of ACE2 in our laboratory (Tipnis et al., 2000) , as a result of genomics approaches to the identification of zinc metalloproteinases, together with its critical role in cardiac and lung development and function (Crackower et al., 2002; Donoghue et al., 2000) and as the cell surface receptor for the severeacute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus (Li et al., 2003) , emphasizes the validity of this strategy for identification of novel therapeutic targets. ACE2 was also suggested to play an important role in the brain renin-angiotensin system being widely expressed in various brain areas but restricted mostly to neuronal cells (Doobay et al., 2007) .\n\nNEP, or neprilysin as it is now known, is a cell surface membrane-bound glycoprotein and zinc peptidase also known as CD10 or common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA). It was originally identified as a major antigen of renal membranes over 30 years ago and, at that time, was implicated in the metabolism of insulin. However, as found later, NEP degrades only the insulin B chain in vitro and not the intact insulin dimer, which suggests that NEP does not have any physiological role in degradation of insulin. Moreover, another zinc metallopeptidase, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE; insulysin), was subsequently discovered which appeared to fulfill the physiologically relevant function of insulin degradation. Whereas the highest concentrations of NEP are in the renal microvillar membrane, the first clues to its physiological roles came from studies on the metabolism of neuropeptides [especially the enkephalins and substance P (SP)] in the central nervous system where NEP is several orders of magnitude less abundant (Malfroy et al., 1978; Matsas et al., 1984; Relton et al., 1983) . It is now accepted that NEP functions to turn oV neuropeptide signals METALLOPROTEINASES IN NEURODEGENERATION at the synapse in an analogous fashion to the hydrolysis of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase at cholinergic synapses (see Turner and Tanzawa, 1997 for review) . Evidence in vitro has clearly demonstrated that synaptic membranes eYciently degrade enkephalins and SP and that NEP was the primary enzyme responsible for these events . Combined with the data obtained in vivo in rodents using potent and selective NEP inhibitors, such as phosphoramidon and thiorphan (Roques et al., 1980) , key roles were established for NEP in the central nervous system. Subsequently, renal NEP was shown to be the principal enzyme inactivating the vasodilator, atrial natriuretic peptide (Kenny and Stephenson, 1988) , which has led to much investment in the development of NEP inhibitors, either alone or in combination with ACE inhibitors (vasopeptidase inhibitors), as drugs in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and renal disease (Bralet and Schwartz, 2001) , although concerns over their safety have been raised (Quaschning, 2005) .\n\nNEP also plays important roles in other peripheral tissues such as in chemoreception and in potentiation of the response of the carotid body to hypoxia via degradation of its preferred substrate, SP (Kumar et al., 1990 (Kumar et al., , 2000 . NEP was also detected in the liver, lungs, muscles, fat deposits, bones, the vertebrae, articular cartilages, and synoviae (Sales et al., 1991) . In the bones, NEP plays a role in regulation of osteoblast and osteoclast metabolism mediated by both hormones and local bone peptide factors (Howell et al., 1993; Ruchon et al., 2000) . In the skeletal muscles, NEP participates in regeneration of muscle fibers and there are data on its role associated with hereditary muscle disorders (Broccolini et al., 2006) .\n\nThe cloning of NEP also revealed its identity with the CALLA or CD10 and has implicated NEP in cancer mechanisms (Letarte et al., 1988; Tran-Paterson et al., 1989) . For example, in human prostate cancer, NEP is dramatically downregulated (Papandreou et al., 1998) allowing mitogenic peptides such as bombesin and endothelin to drive androgen-independent cell division in the prostate. The survey of the expression of NEP and the NEP homologue, endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE-1), in a range of prostate cancers demonstrated that there is a certain balance between the levels of expression of NEP and ECE-1 which determines the level of malignancy of the cells and that upregulation of ECE-1 expression in metastatic cells may be indicative of its role in metastatic progression (Usmani et al., 2002) . Later it was shown that NEP and ECE-1 act as mediators of prostate cancer invasion via a stromal-epithelial interaction (Dawson et al., 2004) . This and related observations have led to suggestions that the dysregulation of the balance of NEP and ECE can lead to the disease and selective reexpression of NEP in prostate cells may provide a novel approach to the treatment of prostate cancer. This is an excellent example where two homologous peptidases counterbalance each other's actions in physiology and pathology.\n\nNEP cleaves a wide range of substrates including SP and other tachykinin peptides, in particular neurokinin B (Fig. 1) , which makes it an important player 116 in the arena of inflammation (Hooper and Turner, 1985) . SP is released from sensory nerves inducing neurogenic inflammation and NEP, via SP degradation, limits its eVects and those of other proinflammatory peptides. There are several studies reporting the role of NEP in peripheral inflammation, for example in the skin (Scholzen and Luger, 2004; Scholzen et al., 2001) . Moreover, NEP but not ACE was shown to be the most important for CGRP degradation in human skin, and NEP inhibitors facilitated neurogenic inflammation in the skin (Kramer et al., 2005) . NEP levels were also found to be significantly decreased in the plasma and monocytes of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (Simonini et al., 2005) . In the mouse model of intestinal inflammation caused by nematode infection NEP was demonstrated to downregulate the early onset of inflammation (Barbara et al., 2003) . Inhibition of NEP was found to exacerbate both experimental pancreatitis and the associated lung injury (Day et al., 2005) , and pretreatment with recombinant human NEP ameliorated this injury in NEP \u00c0/\u00c0 transgenic mice (Lightner et al., 2002) . In this connection, upregulation of NEP is considered as a potential therapeutic approach for pancreatitis-associated lung injury, which can also be true in the case of other inflammatory diseases.\n\nAlthough the role of NEP in peripheral inflammation is well characterized, there are much less data on the role of NEP in inflammatory processes in the brain. However, the data on the localization and properties of NEP in the nervous system of insects provide evidence for an evolutionarily conserved role for NEP in the inactivation of tachykinin-related peptides in the brain (Isaac and Nassel, 2003; Isaac et al., 2002) .\n\nIt was demonstrated that NEP might play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD due to its capacity to cleave the neurotoxic and inflammatory amyloid-(A) peptide (Iwata et al., 2000) that is a primary trigger for the (Hardy and Higgins, 1992) . It is now well documented that A is formed from a large precursor molecule called APP via two consecutive cleavages (Fig. 2 ). The first of these cleavages occurs in the extracellular or lumenal domain and is mediated by a membrane-bound aspartic protease termed -secretase (BACE) (Vassar and Citron, 2000) . It releases a large soluble fragment of sAPP and the residual membrane-bound fragment. The latter is cleaved by a -secretase protease complex, at residues 40-42 (termed -site) or at residues 48-52 (termed \"-site) within the transmembrane domain. The presenilin-dependent -secretase and -site proteolytic activities are dependent on a multimeric complex of at least four diVerent membrane proteins, including presenilin-1 (PS1) or presenilin-2 (PS2), nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 (Francis et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2000) . In these complexes, the presenilins have been proposed as a novel type of transmembrane aspartic protease bearing the catalytic core of the -secretase (Wolfe et al., 1999) . Whereas the cleavage at the -site generates A, the subsequent cleavage at the \"-site generates a cytosolic fragment referred to as ICD (Passer et al., 2000) or AICD (APP IntraCellular Domain). The exact role of AICD remains unclear but it has been suggested to act as a functional transcriptional regulator (Cao and Sudhof, 2001) in combination with the regulatory proteins Fe65 and the chromatinassociated histone acetyltransferase, Tip60. There were reports that AICD and nicastrin regulate expression of NEP but this is controversial and still has to be Amyloidogenic processing of APP and formation of amyloid (A) peptide, fibrils, and plaques. Main avenues in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection. APP, amyloid precursor protein; sAPP, soluble product of -secretase cleavage; sAPP, soluble product of -secretase cleavage; AICD, C-terminal fragment of APP, product of -secretase cleavage.\n\nTURNER AND NALIVAEVA proved experimentally in animal models (Hass and Yankner, 2005; Hebert et al., 2006; Pardossi-Piquard et al., 2005 ). An additional component of the -secretase complex, termed TMP21, which is a member of the p24 cargo protein family, appears to diVerentially regulate -secretase cleavage without aVecting \" -secretase activity (Ch en et al., 2006) . The proteolytic events involved in processing of APP are highly compartmentalized in the cell taking place both within intracellular compartments and in the plasma membrane. The rate limiting reaction of APP cl ea va ge b y -secretase (BACE) was shown to take place especially in lipid raft domains enriched with cholesterol and glycosphingolipids and targeting BACE to lipid rafts increased production of A (Cordy et a l., 2003) . Depletion of cell cholesterol by lovastatin resulted in a decrease in both of sAPP an d A levels in the cell culture model. This explains the positive eVect of statins on the development of AD pathology observed in patients with statin treatment (Sparks et a l., 2006) .\n\nUnder normal cond itions, A occurs as a soluble fragm ent, the concen tration of w hich is norma lly tightly controll ed below the threshold for its self-ag gregation into sheet fibrils ( Burdick et al., 1992 ) . Until re cently, production of A in the brain and other tissues was thought to be an irreversi ble proces s, le ading in the case of their disru ption, to amyl oidogenic dise ases. H owever, in the last few years, nepril ysin and several other protea ses (IDE, ECE-1 and ECE-2, plasmin ) have been found to be capab le of degrad ing A in vitro and in vivo (for review see Carson and Turner, 2002 ; Turner et al., 2004 ) . The sites of A cleaved by kn own protein ases are shown in Fig. 3 . Patho logical downregu lation of these enzy mes and, in particular of NEP, could predi spo se to accum ulation of A and the devel opment of A D (Apelt et al. , 2003; Naliv aeva et al. , 2004) . In particular, in mice deficie nt in NEP or ECE -1, amyloid deposits are seen to deposit at significant levels in the brain (Ec kman et al. , 200 3; Hersh et al. , 2002 ) . Furthermo re , injection of amyl oid-peptid e into the bra ins of roden ts signifi cantly enh ances the concen trations of N EP m RNA and protein, sugg esting the opera tion of a regulatory feed back m echanism to protect neurons from toxic damag e (Mohaje ri et al. , 2002 ) . NEP le vels appea r to be reduced in high-pla que-bear ing areas of hum an brain in A D and in cerebra l amyl oid angio pathy (Carpent ier et al ., 2002; Yasojima et al. , 2001 ) but no associati on has been det ected to date between polym orphisms in the NEP gene and AD (Lilius et al. , 2003 ) . Clinical da ta suggest that isch emia and stroke predispo se to developmen t of AD (Snowd on et al. , 1997 ), and it was shown that hypoxia and ischemia lead to a decrea se of NEP and ECE exp ression Naliv aeva et al. , 2004 ) . Thus, a possible thera peutic approa ch for treatment of AD might be a chronic upregulation of these proteinases (Fig. 4) , either pharma cologica lly or through a gene thera py approa ch (Marr et al. , 2003; Saito et al., 2005; Turner et al., 2004) .\n\nMaintenance of cellular concentrations of NEP, which is rather widely distributed in the body, is critical to peptide homeostasis and its up-or downregulation can lead to a range of pathological conditions including those of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and tumorigenic origins. NEP was, for quite some years, a lone mammalian zinc peptidase apparently mechanistically similar to the bacterial enzyme, thermolysin, both enzymes being potently inhibited by phosphoramidon. The structural solution of the catalytic domain of human NEP 120 complexed with phosphoramidon (Oefner et al., 2000) reveals both similarities and diVerences with thermolysin, and the restricted access to the active site highlights why the enzyme acts exclusively as an oligopeptidase rather than a proteinase, unlike thermolysin.\n\nA homologue of NEP, namely neprilysin 2 (NEP2), was discovered and in the brain shown to be restricted mainly to developing and diVerentiated fields of the CNS. Unlike NEP and ECE-1, which are broadly expressed in the CNS and periphery, NEP2 was found to be almost exclusively expressed only in selected populations of neurons and in the spinal cord. The only peripheral areas where expression of NEP2 was detected were the pituitary and choroid plexuses. NEP2 was also found capable of degrading A and its distinct localization from NEP suggests that, together with ECE-1, it may be better poised to catabolize A as it is more abundantly expressed in the areas relevant to AD pathology (Facchinetti et al., 2003; Thomas et al., 2005) .\n\nThe human genome is now known to contain at least seven NEP-related enzymes (summarized in Turner et al., 2001) , of which the best characterized is ECE-1, which catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of the potent vasoconstrictor peptide, endothelin-1 (ET-1; Matsumura et al., 1990; Xu et al., 1994) . Several of the NEP-like enzymes are, as yet, orphan peptidases with no recognized peptide substrates. Novel strategies are urgently needed to allow the identification of physiologically relevant substrates for such newly identified proteases.\n\nIII. The NEP Homologue ECE-1 ECE-1 was first purified from rat lung (Takahashi et al., 1993) but then was also found in a variety of tissues. It is most abundant in endothelial cells but is also expressed by exocrine cells, smooth muscle cells, neurons, and glia in the brain (Barnes and Turner, 1999; Barnes et al., 1997; Takahashi et al., 1995) . To date, four isoforms of human ECE-1 diVering only in a part of their N-terminal cytoplasmic region but which cleave big ETs with similar eYciencies have been characterized: named ECE-1a, ECE-1b, ECE-1c, and ECE-1d (Schweizer et al., 1997; Valdenaire et al., 1999) . Although the relative levels of the isoform mRNA species vary between human tissues, ECE-1c mRNA is generally the predominant isoform message. There are distinct subcellular localizations for the four isoforms: whereas ECE-1a, ECE-1c, and ECE-1d proteins are localized mainly at the cell surface, ECE-1b was found to be intracellular and showed significant colocalization with a marker protein for the trans-Golgi network (Schweizer et al., 1997) . There are no significant diVerences in the catalytic properties between them, so it has been suggested that intracellular ECE-1 localized in Golgi and vesicles might be involved in processing of big ET whereas cell surface ECE-1 may metabolize other regulatory peptides (Turner et al., 1998) .\n\nECE-1 and its product ET-1 have been shown to be involved in such inflammatory conditions as asthma (Zhang et al., 2004) , chronic rhinitis with its expression in the nasal epithelium and mucosa being much higher in the case of rhinitis than in controls (Furukawa et al., 1996) , and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Saleh et al., 1997) . In the latter case, an increased release of ET-1 was accompanied by increased levels of ECE-1 mRNA. Using normal bronchial epithelial cell culture, these authors have demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-1) induced a significant increase in ET-1 release and mRNA expression, while TNF-stimulated expression of ECE-1 mRNA. In the model of acute gastric infection caused by administration of Helicobacter pylori lipopolysaccharide, it was also shown that the levels of ET-1 and expression of ECE-1 were significantly increased in the gastric mucosa of infected cells on day 4 but then significantly reduced (down to 60%) by day 10 following reduced gastric inflammation (Slomiany et al., 2000) . Developing this work further, the authors have discovered that ET-1 has also an eVect on leptin production in the gastric mucosa as a consequence of ET(A) receptor activation (Slomiany and Slomiany, 2005) .\n\nTogether with ET-1, ECE-1 is abundantly present in human arteries and is involved in chronic inflammation in human atherosclerosis. Upregulation of the ECE-1-ET-1 system was shown to be closely linked to the presence of chronic inflammation at the very early stages of plaque evolution and, thus, has been suggested as a target in atherosclerosis therapy (Ihling et al., 2001 (Ihling et al., , 2004 . Plasma levels of ECE-1 were also shown to reflect the severity of ischemic complications after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The higher levels of plasma ECE-1 resulted in reduced big ET-1 and increased ET-1/big ET-1 ratio in patients who experienced symptomatic delayed cerebral ischemia, compared with other patients ( Juvela, 2002) . However, the levels of ECE-1 expression in rat brain cortex hemispheres and hippocampus was found to be decreased after 15-min global ischemia and restored to control levels after reperfusion , which might reflect an adaptive reaction of the brain to increased blood supply to the aVected areas.\n\nAlthough ECE-1 has been regarded as a highly specific endopeptidase, it was demonstrated to be able to hydrolyze, apart from big ET-1, a number of other biologically active peptides, such as bradykinin, SP, neurotensin, angiotensin I, and insulin B chain; it is not yet clear whether any of these, or other peptides, are physiological substrates of ECE-1 (Hoang and Turner, 1997; Johnson et al., 1999) . It was demonstrated that ECE-1 can also degrade amyloid peptide A, which made it an important player in the arena of AD (Eckman et al., 2001) . Overexpression of ECE-1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells, lacking endogenous ECE activity, was found to reduce extracellular A concentration by up to 90% and this eVect was completely abolished by treatment with a metalloproteinase inhibitor phosphoramidon. Recombinant soluble ECE-1 was shown to hydrolyze synthetic A 40 and A 42 in vitro at multiple sites. Comparing ECE heterozygous 122 TURNER AND NALIVAEVA and knockout mice, Eckman et al. (2003) showed that the concentration of A peptides in the brain of these animals was elevated in comparison with control littermates in a gene-dependent manner.\n\nACE was originally identified 50 years ago as a ''hypertensin-converting enzyme'' (Skeggs et al., 1956 ) and its primary substrate was identified as angiotensin I, which it converts into the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. In parallel, it inactivates the vasodilator and inflammatory peptide bradykinin. Hence, inhibition of ACE has a powerful eVect in reduction of blood pressure and the enzyme has therefore been a major cardiovascular target for many years. The catalytic activity of ACE is primarily as a ''peptidyl dipeptidase,'' removing dipeptides from the C-terminus of a susceptible peptide substrate. In the hydrolysis of some peptides (e.g., SP, luliberin), ACE can act as an endopeptidase, although with much lower catalytic eYciency (Turner and Hooper, 2002) . Mammalian ACE exists as two distinct forms, arising from the use of alternative promoters. The simplest form is germinal or testicular ACE, which is essential for male fertility and which carries a single zinc-binding and catalytic domain. Elsewhere in the body, the somatic form of ACE is duplicated and carries two active sites. The analysis of ACE X-ray structures has revealed that ACE most closely resembles a neurotensin-degrading zinc endopeptidase known as neurolysin rather than NEP, or carboxypeptidase A, on whose structure the design of ACE inhibitors was originally based .\n\nWhile seeking novel expressed sequence tags encoding zinc metallopeptidases, we identified and cloned the first human homologue of ACE (ACEH), which is now more commonly referred to as ACE2 (Tipnis et al., 2000) . ACE2 is also a type I integral membrane peptidase showing 40% identity and 61% similarity with ACE and conserving the critical active site residues. It contains a single catalytic domain like testicular ACE, and it is most abundantly expressed in kidney, heart, and lung (Donoghue et al., 2000; Tipnis et al., 2000) . Physiologically, the principal role of ACE2 is thought to be the conversion of angiotensin 2 to angiotensin (1-7), which opposes the actions of ACE2. Hence ACE and ACE2 act as counterbalances in metabolism in the renin-angiotensin system. Clues to the roles of ACE2 have come from the development of mice deficient in the ACE2 gene (Crackower et al., 2002) . These mice have severe cardiac contractility defects, increased plasma angiotensin II levels, and an upregulation of cardiac hypoxia-related genes, implicating ACE2 as an essential regulator of heart function. Intriguingly, a double knockout in mice of both the ACE and ACE2 genes is able to rescue the cardiac defect seen with the ACE2-deficient mice (Crackower et al., 2002) . ACE2 mRNA and protein levels are substantially reduced in the kidney in diabetic rats, suggesting that the enzyme may have a role in the development of diabetic complications (Tikellis et al., 2004) . It has been shown that ACE2 is widely distributed throughout the brain but is mainly localized to the cytoplasm of neuronal cells in the brain and not present in glia. Moreover, ACE2 levels appear to be highly regulated by the renin-angiotensin system, suggesting its involvement in this system in the brain. ACE2 expression in the brain structures involved in the control of cardiovascular function suggests that it may have a role in the central regulation of blood pressure and hypertension (Doobay et al., 2007) .\n\nThe most remarkable discovery in relation to ACE2 biology has been the demonstration that the enzyme functions as the receptor for the SARS virus (Li et al., 2003) and numerous subsequent studies have confirmed and extended this observation. Thus, the structure of the SARS Coronavirus spike receptorbinding domain complexed with receptor has been determined (Li et al., 2005) and compounds blocking spike protein and ACE2 interaction discovered, for example emodin (Ho et al., 2007) . ACE2 also appears to play a critical role in protection against acute lung injury from SARS infection, or other causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (Imai et al., 2005) .\n\nOne feature that both ACE (Hooper et al., 1987) and ACE2 (Lambert et al., 2005) share is the ability to be shed from the plasma membrane by cleavage within the juxtamembrane region releasing the bulk of the protein, including the intact catalytic domain, into the extracellular medium. This process is common to a growing number of membrane proteins of diverse characteristics (see Hooper et al., 1997 for review) , an event which is generally receptor-regulated and sensitive to inhibition by a group of hydroxamate metalloproteinase inhibitors such as batimastat. This has led to the identification of members of the ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family of zinc proteinases, typified by tumor necrosis factor-converting enzyme (''TACE''; ADAM17) as candidate shedding enzymes (Allinson et al., 2004) . Our data suggest that NEP might be also shed from the cell surface by a similar mechanism (Fisk, L., Nalivaeva, N. N., and Turner, A. J., unpublished data) . However, the detailed molecular mechanism of this phenomenon has still to be elucidated.\n\nACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce development of diabetes, improve surrogate markers of inflammation, and reduce cardiovascular disease and renal disease (McFarlane et al., 2003) . Increasing evidence indicates that systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation are central features in cerebrovascular disease and that hypertension, through the vasoactive peptides angiotensin and ET-1, promotes and accelerates the atherosclerotic process via inflammatory mechanisms (Di Napoli and Papa, 2005) . It was demonstrated that in humans the product of ACE activity angiotensin II induces IL-6 production through a mineralocorticoid receptor-dependent mechanism (Luther et al., 2007) . This suggests that ACE inhibitors might also be considered as targets in neuroprotection.\n\nTURNER AND NALIVAEVA An ACE polym orphism was demon strated to be associa ted with A D in the Japan ese popula tion (Hu et al. , 1999 ) , and later it was found that ACE can indeed hydrolyze A in vitro and reduce accum ulation of A in cell cult ures (Hu et al. , 2001; Oba et al., 200 5) . How ever, Eckma n et al. (2 006) have demon strated that in vivo ACE does not have a physiolo gical role in clearing A and it i s cleav ed in the brain mostly by NEP and ECE -1 since ACE-d eficient m ice did not demonstrate accum ulation of A while deficit of NEP or ECE -1 activity resulted in additive increa ses in bra in A levels.\n\nIt is becoming mor e obvious tha t neu rodegen eration and developmen t of AD can be promoted by cardiova scular le sions, ischem ia and str oke (Hofman et al. , 1997; Kal aria, 2000 ) . Indeed, the analy sis of va rious autopsy series demon strates that 60-9 0% of AD case s exhib it variable cere brovascular patholog y. Hype rtension has also been sugg ested as a risk factor in dev elopment of AD (for review see Skoog and Gu stafson, 2006 ) . Taking into account that NEP and ECE-1 are involved in va scular functi ons and can contribut e to amyl oid m etabolism, we have analy zed levels of expr ession of ECE-1 in the brain cortex of rats after 15-min global ischemia and fou nd a signific ant decrea se of N EP and ECE -1 protein levels in bra in hemisphe res and both hippoca mpi which returned to norma l le vels after 2-h reperfusio n (N alivaeva et al., 2004 ) . We have also demonstrated that NEP and ECE-1 levels were lower in the cortex and striatum of rats subjected to prenatal hypoxia (7% O 2 , 3 h, 13th day of gestation) (Nalivaeva et a l., 2003) . Preconditioning to mild (15% O 2 ) hypoxia before the episodes of acute hypoxia had a protective eVect restoring the levels of NEP and ECE-1 in rat brain structures analyzed during the first month after birth. Using human neuroblastoma NB7 cells, we have also demonstrated that hypoxia (1.0-2.5% O 2 ) resulted in a decrease in expression of ECE-1 and also in expression of NEP both at the protein and mRNA levels at and NEP activity (Fisk et al ., 2007) . Moreover, both hypoxia and ischemia resulted in an increased production of sAPP and reduced amount of sAPP. These data allowed us to conclude that hypoxic and ischemic conditions in the brain might lead to a shift of amyloid metabolism toward formation of higher levels of A due to an increased rate of -secretase reaction and reduced activity of such amyloid-degrading enzymes as NEP and ECE-1 (Fig. 4) .\n\nAnalyzing the eVect of chronic hypoxia (1%, 24 h) on expression of NEP estimated by the method of real-time PCR in rat primary cortical neurons and astrocytes, we have found that NEP mRNA levels were downregulated (by 20%) under hypoxia in neurons and upregulated in astrocytes (Fig. 5) .\n\nPreviou sly, Apelt et al . (2003) reported NEP mRN A upregu lation in amy loid plaque -surroun ding re active astrocy tes in trans genic Tg2576 mice that prod uce human amyloid-pep tides from birth and develop amy loid-plaque s which may sugge st a role of plaque -media ted astroglios is in A degrad ation. In our exper iments, mRN A levels w ere also upregu lated in hy poxic astrocy tes, which might be an ad aptive reaction of astrocy tes to patholog ical condit ions (Fisk et al., 200 7) .\n\nIt is importa nt to note tha t expression of NEP with ageing w as fou nd to decrea se in the cortex and hip pocampu s of rats, while its le vels in the striatum (where amy loid dep osits have not been re ported in AD brains ) were as high as at the end of the first m onth after birt h . Decr eased levels of another A -degr ading enzy me, IDE, have also been report ed in the bra in of aged mice (Ca ccamo et al., 2005 ) and in rat brain str uctures (N alivaeva-Turn er et al. , 2006 ) . M oreover, our experimen ts demonst rated tha t in the bra in of rats with experim ental ty pe II dia betes IDE levels w ere lower than in control anima ls (Koch kina et al. , 2006 ) . These data suggest tha t age -related deficit of amy loiddegrad ing enzymes might be one of the fa ctors leadi ng to the developmen t of the sporad ic form of AD and upregu lation of NEP and other A -degr ading enzy mes become one of the pos sible therapeu tic targe ts in neur odegener ation and AD.\n\nSeveral ph ysiologica l an d pharma ceutical ways of upregu lation of the nepr ilysin gene have been sugg ested. One of the approaches , suggested by Sait o et al. (2003) , involves NEP sub strates as mol ecules activating expressio n of the NEP gene via a positive feedback mechanism and as yet unknown signaling pathways (Fig. 4) . Analyzing various NEP substrates in this experimental paradigm, these authors (Saito et al., 2005) were able to demonstrate that only somatostatin was capable to stimulate NEP activity in primary cortical neurons. Since somatostatin levels in the brain decrease with age these results indicate that age-related \n\nTURNER AND NALIVAEVA downregulation of somatostatin expression could be one of the triggers for A accumulation leading to late-onset sporadic AD. In our experiments using human neuroblastoma cells expressing NEP and ECE-1, we were not able to detect somatostatin-dependent upregulation of NEP mRNA or activity while ECE-1 was significantly upregulated by this peptide in a dose-dependent manner (Fisk, L., Nalivaeva, N. N., and Turner, A. J., unpublished data) .\n\nAnother physiological pathway of regulation of NEP gene has been suggested by Checler and colleagues who demonstrated that the C-terminal product of APP cleavage by -secretase (AICD) was able to transactivate the NEP gene promoter activating NEP expression and that presenilin molecules (PS1 and PS2) and the protein nicastrin in the -secretase complex were essential for this eVect (Pardossi-Piquard et al., 2005 .\n\nAmong chemical compounds that can upregulate NEP expression, green tea extract (EFLA85942) has been demonstrated as eVective in human neuroblastoma SK-N SH cells (Ayoub and Melzig, 2006; Melzig and Janka, 2003) . According to our observations, the active compound of the green tea extract, namely, polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate stimulates in a dose-dependent manner both NEP expression at protein level and its activity in human neuroblastoma NB7 cells (Fisk, L., Nalivaeva, N. N., and Turner, A. J., unpublished data) .\n\nIn this chapter, several examples have demonstrated the role of metalloproteinases in neurodegeneration, neuroprotection, and neuroinflammation. This was mostly shown for NEP, ECE-1, and ACE; however, there are other enzymes whose targeting might be beneficial for prevention of neurological disorders. Among them are the enzymes of amyloidogenic processing of APP by -secretase (and subsequently by -secretase) and nonamyloidogenic APP processing by -secretase (for review see Cordy et al., 2006; Neve, 2003) . Although bothand -secretases produce neurotrophic fragments of APP (sAPP and sAPP) and are believed to play a role in normal functioning of neuronal cells (Thornton et al., 2006; Turner et al., 2003) , the -secretase pathway prevents production of A and thus is regarded as neuroprotective. Downregulation of -secretase or upregulation of -secretase activity will lead to changes in the balance of production of A toward its accumulation and there are emerging experimental data that this might be the case in ischemic or hypoxic brain Wen et al., 2004) . There are also some data that the same compounds can activate both -secretase and NEP activity, for example green tea extracts (Levites et al., 2003; Melzig and Janka, 2003) , suggesting that neuroprotective therapies might target several points in pathogenic processes. However, there also might be situat ions when one compou nd upreg ulates one neuroprot ective pathwa y and down regulates another. Fo r examp le, the phorbol ester PMA was sh own to activate the -secret ase pathwa y (Zhu et al. , 2001 ) but inhibit expr ession of ECE -1 (Fisk et al. , 2 006) . Thi s obser vation im plies the neces sity of di Verentia l analysis of the e Vects of poten tially e Vective neuroprot ective drugs on va rious enzym es particip ating in amyloid m etabolism.\n\nMetallopro teina ses re present im portant therapeu tic targets not only in neurodeg eneration but also in cardiova scular dise ases and prosta te can cer, and unders tandin g their intr icate interrela tionship is still one of the most fascin ating areas of modern molecular and cell biology."}
