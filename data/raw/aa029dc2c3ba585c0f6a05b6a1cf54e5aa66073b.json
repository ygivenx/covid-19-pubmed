In such cases, the method is explicitly described.\n\nHigh-resolution mass spectra were recorded by the Mass Service of the Laboratory of Organic Chemistry at ETH Zurich on a Bruker maXis instrument (ESI-QTOF MS) equipped with an ESI source and a Qq-TOF detector or with a Bruker solariX instrument (MALDI FTMS) with a FT-ICR detector using 4-hydroxy-\u03b1-cyanocinnamic acid as the matrix. MALDI-MS data were obtained on a Bruker\n\nMicroflex MALTI-TOF spectrometer using 4-hydroxy-\u03b1-cyanocinnamic acid as the matrix.\n\nCircular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was carried out on an Aviv, Model 430 spectropolarimeter using a quartz cuvette with 1 mm path length.\n\nUV-vis absorption spectroscopy was carried out on an Agilent 8453 UV-Vis spectrophotometer with a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette.\n\nFluorecent microscopy was carried out with an epifluorescence DMI60000B microscope from Leica.\n\nNative sequence (without the initial signal peptide): NpecOpr-S2-ValKA 2 was synthesized on rink amide polystyrene resin (0.36 mmol/g, scale: 1.0 g, 0.36 mmol) using protected Val-KA with 0.25 mmol/g loading. After automated Fmoc SPPS, the Nterminal Fmoc was removed, and Npec-Opr-OH was manually coupled using HATU and NMM in DMF 4 h followed by washing with DMF and CH 2 Cl 2 . The dried resin was subjected to cleavage using (95:2.5:2.5) TFA:DODT:H 2 O, filtered and the filtrate was evaporated under vacuum. The peptide segment was precipitated with Et 2 O; centrifugation and drying afforded the crude peptide (980 mg).\n\nThe crude peptide was placed in a vial under N 2 atmosphere and could be kept for months at 4 \u00b0C.\n\nThe crude peptide was purified by HPLC using Shiseido Capcell pak C18 column (50 x 250 mm) with a gradient of 20 to 85% CH 3 CN (with 0.1% TFA) in 35 min at 60 \u00b0C to obtain 180 mg of PhotoOpr-S2-ValKA 2 in an overall yield of 14%. \n\nOpr-S3-ArgTAG 3 was synthesized on polystyrene resin (loading 0.32 mmol/g, scale: 1.0 g, 0.32 mmol). After Fmoc-Gly-OH followed by seven Fmoc-Arg(pbf)-OH were coupled via SPPS and Nterminal Fmoc-deprotection, 4-(hydroxymethyl)benzoic acid was manually coupled using HATU and NMM in DMF for 4 h. Fmoc-Gly-OH was attached to the resin via the symmetrical anhydride method using DIC in CH 2 Cl 2 /DMF for two times 2 h. The resin was subjected to the automated Fmoc SPPS using standard procedures as described in the General Methods. After the N-terminal deprotection of glycine 94, Fmoc-Opr-OH was manually coupled using HATU and NMM in DMF 4 h followed by washing with DMF, CH 2 Cl 2 and dried The dried resin was subjected to cleavage using (95:2.5:2.5) TFA:TIPS:H 2 O, filtered and the filtrate was evaporated under vacuum.

H 2 N-S1-ArgKA 1 (29.6 mg, 5.58 \u00b5mol, 1.50 equiv) and Opr-S2S3-OH 6 (34.2 mg, 3.72 \u00b5mol, 1.00 equiv) were mixed together and dissolved in 310 \u00b5L of NMP/H 2 O 95:5 and 0.1 M oxalic acid and 0.1 M TCEP. The resulting mixture was mixed by vortex until complete solubilization and then placed in a 60 \u00b0C shaker for 20 h.\n\nAfter completion, the reaction mixture was dissolved with 7.50 mL of NaHCO 3 pH 8.5 and vortexed until it became clear. The reaction was stirred for 8 h at rt and directly purified by RP-HPLC Phenomenex C4 column (20 x 250 mm) with a gradient of 40 to 98% CH 3 CN (with 0.1% TFA) at 60 \u00b0C in 30 min affording 8.1 mg of IFITM3 7 (15% yield).\n\nBecause of the lack of cleavable sites and particularly in the membrane regions, classical enzymatic digestion was unsuccessful. The acid digestion was performed by the Functional Genomic Center of the University of Zurich.\n\nThe grey bands correspond to the mass of the different peptides found and to which part of the amino acid sequence it corresponds to. When the intensity of the MS signal was strong enough, MS/MS analysis was performed and is displayed by the red marks. The MS sequence coverage was greater than 95%.\n\nExtra pure L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (10.0 mg, 13 mmols) was dissolved in in 1.00 mL of CH 3 Cl. 100 \u00b5L were of the resulting solution were placed in an eppendorf and a N 2 flow was applied for 15 min until complete evaporation of the CH 3 Cl. IFITM3 7 (0.10 mg, 6.9 nmols) was dissolved in 10.0 \u00b5L of TFE and added to the previously prepared eppendorf. a) Synthesis of phosphorylated arginine a-ketoacid segment 1 (Phosphorylated-S1-ArgKA, S1)\n\nPhosphorylated-S1-ArgKA S1 was synthesized by loading the cyanosulfurylide linker on rink amide polystyrene resin (loading 0.36 mmol/g, scale: 0.15 g, 0.05 mmol) using the protocol previously reported by our group. 3 Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH was coupled to the cyanosulfurylide using HATU and NMM in DMF for 4 h followed by several washings with DMF, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, DMF and CH 2 Cl 2 . After drying the loading was determined to be 0.3 mmol/g. with a gradient of 10 to 65% CH 3 CN (with 0.1% TFA) in 30 min to obtain 24 mg of Phosphorylated-S1-ArgKA S1 in an overall yield of 25%. 8 S1 S1 S1\n\nPhosphorylated-S1-ArgKA (10.0 mg, 1.86 \u00b5mol, 1.50 equiv) and Opr-S2S3-ArgTAG 4 (13.0 mg, a) Synthesis of fluorescent arginine a-ketoacid segment 1 (Fluorescent-S1-ArgKA, S2)\n\nFluorescent-S1-ArgKA S2 was synthesized by loading the cyanosulfurylide linker on Rink amide polystyrene resin (loading 0.36 mmol/g, scale: 0.15 g, 0.05 mmol) using the protocol previously reported by our group. 3 Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH was coupled to the cyanosulfurylide using HATU and NMM in DMF for 4 h followed by several washings with DMF, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, DMF and CH 2 Cl 2 . After drying the loading was determined to be 0.3 mmol/g.\n\nThe resin was subjected to automated Fmoc SPPS using standard procedures as described in the General Methods. After N-terminal deprotection the peptide sulfurylide was cleaved from the resin and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum. The peptide segment was precipitated with Et 2 O and after centrifugation and drying, afforded the crude peptide (214 mg). The crude peptide was placed in a vial under N 2 atmosphere and could be kept for months at 4 \u00b0C.\n\nThe crude peptide (100 mg) was dissolved in a glass vial with 4.0 mL of H 2 O/CH 3 CN (1:1) and 0.1% TFA. After complete dissolution, Oxone (541 mg, 0.88 mmols, 50 equiv) was added. The reaction mixture was placed on a shaker and gently agitated for 5 minutes. The reaction was quenched with 250 \u00b5L of DMS. The excess of DMS was evaporated using a N 2 flow and the resulting mixture was re-dissolved, centrifuged and purified by preparative HPLC using Shiseido Capcell pak C18 column (20 x 250 mm) with a gradient of 10 to 65% CH 3 CN (with 0.1% TFA) in 30 min to obtain 13 mg of Fluorescent-S1-ArgKA S2 in an overall yield of 14%.\n\n.

Vesicles assay 5 and fluorescence microscopy.\n\nTo a 50 mL round bottom flask was added 600 \u03bcL of a solution of egg phosphatidylcholine in CHCl 3 (10 mg/mL) and 400 \u03bcL of additional CHCl 3 . The solvent was evaporated on a rotary evaporator and the flask was placed under vacuum for overnight. The lipid film was hydrated with 1.0 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 8 and the flask was incubated at rt for 1 h.\n\nTo a 1.50 mL eppendorf tube was added 50.0 \u03bcL of a 100 \u03bcM the desired protein in 0.2% SDS, 0. The same procedure as in 5.2 was repeated using Fluorescent-IFITM3 9. After filtration the flow through was concentrated -using spin filters with a 3.5 kDa cut off -and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.\n\nEven though it could arise from the sample preparation, fluorescence microscopy shows labeled IFITM3 as compact and defined \"dots\" inside the lipid bilayer. This could indicate that IFITM3 localizes in lipid membranes as clusters or aggregates. "}
