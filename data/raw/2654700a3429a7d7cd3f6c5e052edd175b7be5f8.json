{"title": "Inhibition of SIRT1 by microRNA-9, the key point in process of LPS-induced severe inflammation", "body": "Inflammation is an adaptive process to the noxious stimuli [1, 2] . Organ-specific receptors are activated during severe inflammation and this systemic reaction is called the acute-phase response [3] . In case the initial stimulus cleared unsuccessfully, a system-wide inflammation, even a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) will be started, and finally lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [4] . MODS is defined as the progressive dysfunction of two or more organs and is responsible for the majority of the morbidity and mortality among patients in intensive care units [5, 6] . MODS unleashes complicated systemic reactions which is initiated simultaneously by host pattern recognition and endogenous signals. Then multiple signal pathways are activated which ultimately lead to over-expression of cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6 and affect cellular metabolism [7] [8] [9] . MODS involves disorders of endothelial system, immune system and coagulation system [10] . It is a much more complex situation than inflammation and SIRS [11] . It is critical to control inflammation in early stage and to avoid the progression into SIRS and MODS.\n\nNF-\u03baB pathway regulates the expression of a large number of genes, which are crucial for the regulation of apoptosis, virus replication, tumorigenesis, inflammation and various autoimmune diseases [11] [12] [13] [14] . Bacterial infection or LPS simulation activates NF-\u03baB pathway which promotes the production of inflammatory cytokines [15] . Once NF-\u03baB pathway activated, a great number of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-8 are over-expressed, which are symbols of MODS [16] .\n\nPlenty of endogenous signals including microRNAs (miRs) could activate NF-\u03baB pathway. MiRs are non-coding RNAs which can target to mRNAs and lead to translation repression. MiRs have shown the effects to regulate inflammatory cytokines through several kinds of pathways including NF-\u03baB [17] [18] [19] . Several miRs, such as miR-125b, miR-146a, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.12.016 Received 16 October 2018 ; Received in revised form 4 December 2018; Accepted 12 December 2018 miR-15a, and miR-16, could prevent NF-\u03baB activation and prevent the translocation of the subunits to the nucleus [20, 21] . It is reported that miR-9 is increased in pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) [22] [23] [24] [25] .\n\nHere we discuss the possible mechanism of microRNA-9 regulating severe inflammation.\n\n2.1. Cell culture and drug administration RAW 264.7 cells (murine macrophage cell line, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in endotoxin-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Excell Bio, China), 100IU/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and then maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For LPS stimulation, cells were stimulated by LPS with a concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml 6 h and 12 h after LPS stimulation, cells were harvested for PCR and western blot respectively. To inhibit SIRT1, EX527 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA) was used to stimulate macrophages at the concentration of 1 \u03bcM, cells were used for further experiments 24 h after disposal.\n\nThe miR-9 mimic, miR-9 inhibitor as well as their negative control (GeneCopoeia, China) were transfected into RAW264.7 macrophages using Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, transfected cells were used for further experiments.\n\nTotal RNAs of cultured cells were extracted using RNA-isolation kit (Takara, Japan). 500 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Prime Script\u2122 RT reagent Kit (Takara, Japan). The obtained cDNA was then amplified by the CFX Connect real-time system (BIO-RAD, US), using SYBR\u2122 Premix Ex Taq\u2122 Kit (Takara, Japan) with specific primers ( Table 1 ). The PCR conditions were 95\u00b0C for 30s, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30s, 60\u00b0C for 10s, and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 15s. The relative quantification of target gene was conducted using the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method, with GAPDH as an internal control. The method to quantify miR-9 was performed by stem-loop RT-PCR. MiR-9 and reverse primers were put at 65\u00b0C for 5 min to form highly target-specific stem-loop structure. Then reverse transcriptase, RNase inhibitor, dNTPs and buffer were added for reverse transcription. Primer oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit and TaqMan MicroRNA assay kits (Takara, Japan) were used for qRT-PCR determination of miR-9, performed on CFX96 Real Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). U6 snRNA was used as the internal control to normalize sample input. The primer sequences for each gene were listed in Table 1 .\n\nFor short, 50 \u03bcg of total protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk at room temperature for 3h, incubated with primary antibodies specific to SIRT1 (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), NF-\u03baB p65 (1:1000, CST, USA), acetyl-NF-\u03baB p65 (1:1000, CST, USA) and \u03b2-actin (1:1000, CST, USA) at 4\u00b0C overnight. On the next day, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted at 1:3000 (Boster, Wuhan, China) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Protein bands on the membrane were visualized with ECL Kit (Millipore, USA) using FluorChem FC system (Alpha Innotech). Results were presented as densitometric ratio between the protein of interest and the loading control (\u03b2-actin).\n\nHealthy male C57B6/L mice, myeloid specific sirt1 knockout mice (sirt1 \u2212/\u2212 mice) on C57B6/L background and littermate wild type mice (WT mice) weighing 20-25 g were included in this study. Mice about 6-8 weeks old were provided by Experimental Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical University. All mice were fed ad libitum a standard diet and water throughout the study. They were housed separately and kept under standard conditions at room temperature (22-24\u00b0C) under a 12:12 h light/dark cycle. All the protocols were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines in the ethical permit that were accordance with the principles of ARRIVE approved by the Ethics Committee of Xijing Hospital, affiliated to the Fourth Military Medical University. In summary, we tried our best to lessen the numbers of animals involved and made sure that experienced researchers did the invasive manipulation. And during this process, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane inhalation.\n\nAnaesthetized mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA; 10 mg/kg) to induce inflammation. MiR-9 antagomiR or negative control was injected through cauda vein in 3 consecutive days (12.1 \u03bcmol/kg/day). LPS was injected 24 h after the last injection. Half of the mice were anaesthetized and sacrificed 24 h after LPS stimulation for detection of serum and the other half were sacrificed at 72 h to get organs tissues.\n\nMice were divided into two groups, for blood and tissue samples collection respectively. All blood was acquired 24 h after LPS injection from left ventricle of mice. Tissues from liver, kidney, cardiac and lung were obtained 72 h after LPS injection for H&E staining and TUNEL staining.\n\nBlood samples were standing at room temperature for 30 min and then centrifuged for 15 min at 1000\u00d7g. Serum was collected to detect levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 using ELISA KIT (Nanjing Jiancheng, China).\n\nTissue specimens were fixed in 10% formalin, dehydrated in alcohol, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 \u03bcm thickness sections and mounted. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for the observation of pathological changes. Then degree of organ damage was evaluated by pathological expert according to scoring system. TUNEL staining was done according to the instruction of commercial TUNEL cell death detection kit (Roche, Switzerland). Stained slices Table 1 Primer sequences used for real-time-PCR analysis. mRNA forward primer reverse primer\n\nwere observed and photographed under microscope (All-in-one FSX100, Olympus, Japan). Five high-magnification files of every slice were randomly selected. Every positive spot in DAB staining was counted as a cell and the brown spot overlapped with that was counted as apoptotic cell. The results were scored semi-quantitatively by averaging the number of apoptotic cells per field at \u00d7 400 magnification. Five fields were evaluated per tissue sample, and the results were presented as means \u00b1 SD.\n\nThe 3\u2032 untranslation region (UTR) fragments of SIRT1 containing the miR binding sites were amplified by PCR using the cDNA template obtained from RNA sample of macrophages. The wide type 3\u2032 UTRs of SIRT1 as well as mutant 3\u2032 UTRs with nucleotide substitutions in the putative binding sites corresponding to the seed sequence of miR-9 was cloned downstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the pGL3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were co-transfected with miR-9 or a control miR. 48 h later, cells were washed in PBS and the luciferase activity was measured by a luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI), using dual luciferase reporter assay system.\n\nSingle blind method was used to generate data. The data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U tests using the SPSS 18.0 program and presented as mean \u00b1 SD. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nTo simulate inflammation environment in vitro, macrophages stimulated by 1 \u03bcg/ml LPS were used. As shown in Fig. 1 , the mRNA levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, CCL2 and IL-10 were significantly increased after LPS stimulation (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1a-b ). In addition, the level of miR-9 was also increased in LPS-stimulated macrophages (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1c) .\n\nMacrophages were cultured for 6 h in medium alone (Control group) or in the presence of 1 \u03bcg/ml LPS (LPS group). The levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, CCL2, IL-10 (a-b) and the level of miR-9 (c) were tested by RT-PCR. n = 4. **, p < 0.01.\n\nTo investigate the role of miR-9 in vitro, miR-9 inhibitor was transfected in macrophage. As shown in Fig. 2 , the level of miR-9 was significantly down-regulated after miR-9 inhibitor transfection (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2a) . The mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, CCL2 and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 were significantly increased after LPS stimulation (p < 0.01). After miR-9 suppression, the levels of those pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2b) , while the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, was significantly increased (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2c) .\n\nMacrophages were divided into four groups randomly: NC group (20 \u03bcM inhibitor NC), NC + LPS group (20 \u03bcM inhibitor NC + 1 \u03bcg/ml LPS), miR-9 in group (20 \u03bcM miR-9 inhibitor) and miR-9 in + LPS group (20 \u03bcM miR-9 inhibitor + 1 \u03bcg/ml LPS). The level of miR-9 was tested 6 h after LPS stimulation by RT-PCR (a). The levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, CCL2 and IL-10 were tested 6 h after LPS stimulation by RT-PCR (b-c). n = 4. ## , p < 0.01 compared with NC group. **, p < 0.01 compared with NC + LPS group.\n\nTo verify the role of miR-9 in vivo, LPS-induced inflammation mice model was used. LPS was intraperitoneally injected into mice pretreated with miR-9 antagomiR or antagomiR NC to stimulate the acute organic damage induced by inflammation. Serum and tissue specimens were harvested 24 h and 72 h after injection of LPS separately. As shown in Fig. 3 , inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 in blood were reduced by miR-9 inhibitor (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3a) . Down-regulation of miR-9 alleviated organ damage, since there was obviously reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells, alleviated edema and hemorrhage, and relatively complete structures seen in specimen after H&E staining (Fig. 3b) . What's more, TUNEL staining of organ tissues showed that the apoptosis of cells of mice in NC group were much more apparently than that of mice in miR-9 antagomiR group. The apoptotic ratio of heart, liver, lung and kidney in NC group were 21.7 \u00b1 0.5%, 19.5 \u00b1 0.3%, 27.0 \u00b1 0.2% and 17.1 \u00b1 0.3% separately. The data in miR-9 antagomiR group were 16.2 \u00b1 0.3%, 11.5 \u00b1 0.5%, 20.0 \u00b1 0.3% and 11.2 \u00b1 0.3% separately (n = 6) (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3c ).\n\nMice were divided into two groups randomly: NC + LPS group (12.1 \u03bcmol/kg/day antagomiR NC + 10 mg/kg LPS) and miR-9 antagomiR + LPS group (miR-9 in + LPS group) (12.1 \u03bcmol/kg/day miR-9 antagomiR + 10 mg/kg LPS). The level of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 in serum were tested 24 h after LPS injection by microplate reader (a). H& E staining of tissue from heart, liver, lung and kidney were performed 72 h after LPS injection to assess the extent of damage (b). The TUNEL assay was performed 72 h after LPS injection to evaluate the apoptosis in heart, liver, lung and kidney (c). Scale bar = 50 \u03bcm n = 6. **, p < 0.01.\n\nTo predict the potential targets of miR-9, databases of TargetScan, PicTar and miRanda were used. As shown in Fig. 4a , SIRT1 is a potential target of miR-9, for the 3'-UTR of SIRT1 mRNA could bind to miR-9 completely. Then luciferase reporter was used to confirm the binding of miR-9 and SIRT1. As shown in Fig. 4b , the luciferase reporter assay showed a 55% decrease in the relative luciferase activity of the wild-type SIRT1 3'-UTR vector after miR-9 mimics transfection in macrophages (p < 0.01). In contrast, the mutant construction completely abolished this effect, suggesting that miR-9 could directly bind to SIRT1 3'-UTR and inhibit SIRT1 expression. Furthermore, the level of SIRT1 increased after the administration of miR-9 inhibitor while decreased by miR-9 mimics (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4c-d) , which was consistent with bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay.\n\nBioinformatics analysis of SIRT1 and miR-9 (a). Luciferase reporter assay showed a 55% decrease in the relative luciferase activity of the wild-type SIRT1 3'-UTR vector after miR-9 mimics transfection while the mutant construct completely abolished this effect (b). Macrophages were divided into two groups randomly: in NC group (20 \u03bcM inhibitor NC) and miR-9 in group (20 \u03bcM miR-9 inhibitor), the level of SIRT1 was detected by RT-PCR and western blotting 6 h and 12 h respectively after LPS stimulation (c). Macrophages were divided into two groups randomly: mimics NC group (20 \u03bcM mimics NC) and miR-9 mimics group (20 \u03bcM miR-9 mimics), the level of SIRT1 was detected by RT-PCR and western blotting 6 h and 12 h respectively after LPS stimulation (d). n = 4. **, p < 0.01.\n\nTo see whether SIRT1 participates in the protective property induced by miR-9 inhibitor in LPS-induced macrophage, EX527 was used. As shown in Fig. 5 , The mRNA level (Fig. 5a) as well as protein level (Fig. 5b) of SIRT1 in NC group were much higher than those in NC + LPS group (p < 0.01), but much lower than those in miR-9 in + LPS group (p < 0.01). Furthermore, western blot showed that the acetylation of NF-\u03baB induced by LPS can be inhibited by miR-9 inhibitor (p < 0.01), while EX527 could partially impairment this effect (p < 0.01), indicated that the anti-inflammatory property of miR-9 inhibitor by deacetylation of acetyl-NF-\u03baB is SIRT1-depended (Fig. 5c) .\n\nMacrophages were divided into four groups randomly as Fig. 2 mentioned. The levels of SIRT1 in each group were detected by RT-PCR and western blotting 6 h and 12 h respectively after LPS stimulation. (ab). Macrophages were divided into six groups randomly: NC group (20 \u03bcM inhibitor NC), NC + LPS group (20 \u03bcM inhibitor NC + 1 \u03bcg/ml LPS), miR-9 in group (20 \u03bcM miR-9 inhibitor), miR-9 in + LPS group (20 \u03bcM miR-9 inhibitor + 1 \u03bcg/ml LPS), EX527 group (1 \u03bcM EX527) and EX527 + LPS group (1 \u03bcM EX527 + 1 \u03bcg/ml LPS). (c) The levels of acetyl-NF-\u03baB and NF-\u03baB in macrophages in each group were detected by western blotting. n = 4. ## , p < 0.01 compared with NC + LPS group. **, p < 0.01 compared with miR-9 in + LPS group.\n\n3.6. The myeloid specific sirt1 \u2212/\u2212 mice suffered from much severe inflammation and organ injury than WT mice after LPS injection\n\nTo further verify the possible mechanism in vivo, sirt1 \u2212/\u2212 mice and WT mice were used. Mice were given LPS and miR-9 antagomiR as described in mice model. Blood samples were collected to detect the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. The levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 increased significantly in sirt1 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 6a) (p < 0.01) . With the same dose of LPS injection, sirt1 \u2212/\u2212 mice suffered much more serious organ injuries compared with WT mice as is shown in H&E staining. In TUNEL staining, the ratios of apoptotic of myocardium, liver, lung and kidney were about 19.5 \u00b1 0.2%, 18.2 \u00b1 0.5%, 22.3 \u00b1 0.5% and 19.0 \u00b1 0.3% separately in WT mice. The ratios were 23.2 \u00b1 0.3%, 21.5 \u00b1 0.5%, 27.6 \u00b1 0.7% and 22.4 \u00b1 0.4% separately in sirt1 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 6c) (p < 0.01). Mice were pretreated with miR-9 antagomiR through cauda vein injection in 3 consecutive days (12.1 \u03bcmol/kg/day). LPS (10 mg/kg) was injected 24 h after the last injection. Half of the WT and sirt1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were anaesthetized and sacrificed 24 h after LPS stimulation for detection of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in serum by microplate reader (a). Tissues from heart, liver, lung and kidney were acquired from the other half anaesthetized and sacrificed mice at 72 h after LPS stimulation. H&E staining was used to assess organ damage (b). TUNEL staining of organ tissues was used to assess the extent of cell apoptosis (c). Scale bar = 50 \u03bcm n = 6. **, p < 0.01. \n\nSevere inflammation and MODS greatly threat patients' life. The increasing prevalence of drug resistant compels us to find new and effective approaches for the diagnosis and therapy of severe inflammation [26] . MicroRNAs such as miR-9 have been reported to be involved in inflammation and to play an important role in preventing inflammation developing to MODS, while the specific mechanism is still unclear [27] [28] [29] [30] . In this study, we explored the potential effects of miR-9 on multiple organs injury in inflammation and the mechanism involved. Macrophages participate in the regulation of inflammatory responses and protect organ function damage [31, 32] . We constructed an inflammation macrophages model and found the expression of pro-inflammation cytokines as well as anti-inflammatory cytokine increased significantly in LPS induced macrophages. MiR-9 also increased in this process, consistent with results drawn from previous study [27] . So we suspected that miR-9 might play a role in inflammation of LPS stimulated macrophages. To testify that, miR-9 inhibitor was used and the results showed that the suppression of miR-9 could inhibit inflammation and alleviate tissue damage induced by LPS.\n\nMiRs have emerged as key regulators of the posttranscriptional control of gene expression by recognizing the specific sites in the 3'UTR of target mRNAs. Both tumor suppressor and oncogenic roles of miR-9 have been deeply reported in tumors, by binding to corresponding genes, such as E-cadherin, SOCS5, HES1, CXCR4, TLN1, NF-\u03baB1 and so on [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Apart from tumor, miR-9 also plays an irreplaceable role in many kinds of inflammation. During viral infection, miR-9 was reported to act as a intermediary in NF-\u03baB activation induced by nucleocapsid protein of human coronavirus OC43 [38] . In human atherosclerosis inflammation cell models, miR-9 inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation through JAK1/STAT signaling pathway [24] . In knee osteoarthritis, down-regulated miR-9 facilitate proliferation and anti-apoptosis of chondrocytes by directly binding to NF-\u03baB1 [39] . During inflammatory response following cerebral ischemia, miR-9 is downregulated and up-regulated miR-9 relief inflammatory injury by inhibit the expression and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 [40] , While others demonstrate that MCPIP1 is the direct target of miR-9 in microglial and the LPS-induced miR-9 promote microglial activation by MCPIP1-NF-\u03baB pathway [25] . In addition, the impacts of miR-9 on macrophage polarization were also noticeable [41] [42] [43] . MiR-9, the only miRNA (out of the 365 tested) consistently induced by LPS in a MyD88and NF-\u03baB-dependent manner in both monocytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophils [27] , has been shown to promote M1 polarization by target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b4 (PPAR\u03b4) [23] . Furthermore, miR-9 mediated down-regulation of Dusp6 and enhanced ERK-mediated signal transduction was reported to involved in classical activation of CCL2 pre-treated macrophages [44] .\n\nAs declared above, the mechanisms of miR-9 involvement in multiple pathological processes have been studied in depth over the past years. However, understanding of connection between miR-9 and inflammation is far from enough. Numerous studies have implicated the involvement of NF-\u03baB signaling in sepsis and the direct interaction of miR-9 and the 3'UTR of NF-\u03baB1 is well illustrated, whether there is a intermediary between them attracts our interest. So TargetScan, PicTar and miRanda were used to explore the key gene in the downstream of miR-9 and found that SIRT1, a NAD + dependent deacetylase enzyme, which was broadly reported to be a crucial gene in inflammation [45, 46] , was the potential target of miR-9. We found that down-regulation of miR-9 could increase the level of SIRT1, and vice verse. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay verified that SIRT1 was the target of miR-9. All in all, we have enough evidence to accept that SIRT1 was the downstream gene of miR-9.\n\nAcetylation and deacetylation are important mechanism to regulate the activity of NF-\u03baB, and the imbalance of acetylation and deacetylation plays an important role in the occurrence and development of many diseases [47] [48] [49] . It is well demonstrated that activation of SIRT1 leads to deacetylation of Re1A/p65, thereby leading to transcriptional repression of various inflammation-related genes [50, 51] , consistent with our results in LPS induced macrophages. To further verify the miR-9-SIRT1-NF-\u03baB pathway in vivo, myeloid specific sirt1 knockout mice were used. It showed that the protective effects of miR-9 inhibitor were abolished because of the lack of SIRT1. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines increased and the pathological injury aggravated in sirt1 \u2212/\u2212 mice than those of WT mice.\n\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated that miR-9 plays an important role in severe inflammation and MODS. Inhibition of microRNA-9 could promote the deacetylation of Re1A/p65 and eventually alleviate inflammation and organ injuries by up-regulating the expression of SIRT1 (Fig. 7) . This is a potential target for the prevention and treatment of inflammation.\n\nLPS leads to the up-regulation of miR-9 and causes uncontrolled inflammation and MODS, ended with multiple organ failures and death. Inhibition of miR-9, which targets to SIRT1, could promote the deacetylation of NF-\u03baB and improve the organ injuries caused by inflammation.\n\nNone.\n\nWen Yin and Xiaozhi Bai conceived and designed the experiments; Mengyuan Cao, Lincheng Li and Mingchuan Liu performed the experiments; Junjie Li, Wanfu Zhang and Julei Zhang analyzed the data; Wanfu Zhang wrote the paper, Wen Yin and Xiaozhi Bai revised the paper."}
