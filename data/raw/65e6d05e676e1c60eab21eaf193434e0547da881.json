{"title": "", "body": "T2 and fl uid-attenuated inverse-recovery sequences of brain MRI revealed hyperintense lesions in the internal temporal lobes, lenticular nuclei, left internal capsule and pontine region. These lesions (especially the peri-vascular spaces) and the lateral ventricle walls were enhanced with gadolinium on T1 weighted images. Dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging (perfusion sequences) was normal ( fi gure 1 ). The EEG was normal.\n\nA laboratory blood panel revealed normocytic anaemia (10.6 g/dl), leucopenia (2.900/mm 3 ), neutropaenia (1.300/ mm 3 ), lymphopaenia (1.200/mm 3 ), polyclonal hyperglobulinaemia (16 g/l), hyperferritinaemia (1200 ng/ml) and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 45 mm/h. Lumbar puncture (LP) yielded clear cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) with 33 white blood cells/mm 3 (100% lymphocytes), a protein concentration of 167 mg/dl and a glucose concentration of 54 mg/dl. Intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis was absent in CSF, and IL6, IL10 levels were normal. The lymphocyte phenotype was polyclonal and displayed CD3+ reactive T lymphocytes. Interferon \u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) levels increased, with a value of 37 UI/ml (N<2 UI/ml). CSF cultures for bacteria and fungi were negative. PCR performed on CSF to detect bacteria or viruses were also negative ( Treatment with acyclovir was initiated after the fi rst LP and was stopped when a second LP was performed 8 days later: 15 white blood cells/mm 3 (70% lymphocytes), protein concentration of 97 mg/dl, glucose concentration of 57 mg/dl and IFN-\u03b1 level increased to 50 UI/ml.\n\nTests for antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody and anti-DNA were negative. The assessment for paraneoplasic syndrome using an antineuronal antibody was also negative.\n\nThe body CAT scan displayed mediastinal adenopathy (size <1 cm). The PET scan showed hypermetabolic mediastinal and cervical lymphadenopathies but no cerebral fi xation.\n\nA biopsy of one cervical lymphadenopathy was performed. Histological analysis showed eosinophilic necrotic areas with apoptosis that were associated with immunoblastic cells and histiocytes. Lymphoma and infection were excluded. These results led to the diagnosis of KFD.\n\nA month later, the disease spontaneously remitted. Neurological examination was normal. Brain MRI showed a decrease on T2 and gadolinium enhancement. Anaemia (10.6 g/dl) was observed with a neutrophil and platelet rates at 1.562/mm 3 and 166 000/mm 3 . The autoimmune assessment remained normal. Two months later, brain MRI, CSF INF-\u03b1 and blood tests were normal.\n\nWe report a case of encephalitis associated with KFD and describe a high level of IFN-\u03b1 in CSF.\n\nKFD is defi ned by histological criteria corresponding to histocytic necrotising lymphadenitis. 1 2 The adenitis is usually localised to the cervical region. Fever is frequently observed in association with other general symptoms such as asthenia, anorexia, weight loss and night sweats. Infl ammatory syndrome with increased ESR is present in 16% of cases, and leucopenia (including neutropaenia and lymphopaenia) occurs in 18% of cases. An increase of CD4/CD8 is often observed. Hypergamma and high level of ferritin are sometimes described. Evolution is spontaneously favourable, and recurrences are very rare. 3 -5 Neurological manifestations in KFD are not common. Aseptic lymphocytic meningitis was described in 9.8% of cases in Japan and can represent the fi rst sign of KFD (45% of those patients did not present Kerning's sign and neck stiffness).\n\nFive cases of encephalitis, sometimes limited to the cerebellum and brain stem, have been previously associated with meningitis. 6 7 Cerebellar ataxia, diplopia and slowing of ideation are commonly observed. 8 In one case, epileptic manifestations have been associated with confusion. 9 KFD can be confused with lymphoma, tuberculosis or lupus. These were screened for and excluded in our case. The internal temporal brain lesions led to rule out infection and limbic encephalitis. An exhaustive search for infectious agents was negative. The EEG did not show epileptic features, and the serum was negative for antineuronal antibodies.\n\nLittle information is available regarding MRI of KFD in the literature. Brain stem lesions and internal temporal lesions have been previously described. 9 10 This topography may therefore be of consideration as a feature of KFD brain lesions. In addition, we found an enhancement of the ventricular wall and perivascular space inside the parenchymal lesion, without abnormality of relative cerebral blood volume in the perfusion sequence.\n\nAn increase of IFN-\u03b1 level in the CSF was observed without viral infection. Neurological symptoms have been described in association with IFN-\u03b1 treatment used in hepatitis C and carcinoma, but the MRI lesions observed in these cases were different from those observed in KFD. 11 -13 An upregulation of the IFN-\u03b1 type I response has been hypothesised in KFD and could lead to an increase of IFN-\u03b1 level in the CSF.\n\nIn conclusion, we characterised brain lesions especially related to KFD. An increased level of IFN-\u03b1 in CSF without viral infection also seems to be an important feature of KFD. A diagnosis of KFD is important to consider because it often goes into spontaneous remission, although corticotherapy is sometimes necessary in more severe cases.\n\n\u25b6 Lesions of limbic and pontine regions were observed in KFD encephalitis. MRI perivascular enhancement was another aspect. "}
