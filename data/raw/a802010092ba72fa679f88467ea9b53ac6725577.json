AN APPLICATION OF THE DECOMPOSITION METHOD TO HONG KONG MORBIDITY DATA", "body": "Authority. [4] The public healthcare sector currently accounts for over 90% of total secondary and tertiary care, while its subsidy from the Government has reached 95%. The public only needs to pay HK$100 (US$13) per day to receive inpatient services, while the average operating cost is about HK$3,000 (US$350) a day. Healthcare expenditure has been increasing, accounting for 25% of Government expenditures. [5] With an ageing population of more than 13% aged 65 or over and an estimated increase to 28% by 2039, the whole sustainability of the public health system has been called into question and the Government has been actively trying to generate alternative resources to ensure the quality and survival of the public hospital system. 5 visit, is offsetting the corresponding increase in population size, patient population, and the number of visits per patient in a given year. In the present study, we use the decomposition method to examine the impact of the mean duration on the other two factors: total number of patients per 1,000 people of the general population, and the mean number of visits per year in assessing its impact on the total number of hospitalization days.\n\nIn order to investigate the factors contributing to the changes in the average number of hospitalized days per person between 2000 and 2010 in Hong Kong, data on total population and public hospital admissions for this period (Table 1) were collected from the Census and Statistics Department and Hospital Authority, respectively. The Census statistics include both sexes and ages, while the episode-based hospitalization data contains information on age, gender, hospital, date of birth, district of residence, date of admission and discharge, disease code, duration of stay for each visit, and discharge destination.\n\nHere we define the hospitalized days per person (HD) as the total number of hospitalized days in all public hospitals during the examining year (D) divided by the total population in the same year (P). The average population-based hospitalized days is expressed as: where E and I denote the total number of hospital admission episodes and the distinct number of hospitalized individuals, respectively. Equation (ii) contains three components: (1) the ratio (D/E) is the number of hospitalized days to the number of hospital admission episodes, which is the mean duration of stay in hospital; (2) the ratio (E/I) is the mean number of inpatients in episodes to that in individuals, which is the mean number of hospital admission per person; and (3) the ratio (I/P) is the number of individuals to the total population, which is the hospitalization rate in the community.\n\nIn order to measure change in the hospitalization days in the community during this period, we compute the ratio of average population-based admission days between year a and year b as follows:\n\nwhere Ratio MS is the ratio of the mean duration of stay in year a to year b; Ratio F is the ratio of the mean frequency of hospital admission in year a to year b; and Ratio HR is the ratio of hospitalization rate in year a to year b. Thus, the relative change of hospitalized days per person during the period a and b is calculated as: The relative contribution of each of the three factors to the discrepancy in average populationbased hospitalized days can be calculated as follows: (iv) where RC i is the relative contribution of the i-th factor to the difference. [6, 7] period. The hospitalization rate for females was about 1.04 to 1.15 times that for males, but this difference has narrowed in recent years.\n\nAlthough the above admission figures show growth, the average duration of stay decreased by 32.9% from 6.83 to 4.58 days per episode from 2000 to 2010 ( Figure 4 ). In particular, the reduction was reflected more in males (35.4%, 7.38 days to 4.77 days) than in females (30.3%, 6 .33 days to 4.41 days). However, we note that the number of hospital beds in Hospital Authority [9] Moreover, the total hospitalized days decreased by 17.1% (Table 1) . Table 1 and Table 2 give the relative contribution of the differences in mean length of stay, The decomposition is summarized in Table 2 . Applying equation (iv), the relative contributions of each factor are calculated as follows: \n\nThe total number of hospitalization days is the most crucial factor in determining financial funding and planning of the public hospital system. The decomposition method described in this paper provides empirical evidence that the mean duration of stay plays a very significant role in determining the number of hospitalization days. Despite that, the frequency of visits per patient has increased from 1.98 to 2.14, and the hospital admission rate increased from 87.43 to 94.51 (possibly due to the ageing of the population). We still observed a 21% reduction in the number of hospitalized days per person, which contributes to the reduction of the mean duration of stay from 6.83 to 4.58 days. Hence, even a shorter average stay per hospital visit, which could induce 11 an increase in the number of re-visits, still leads to a reduction in the total number of hospitalization days.\n\nWith an ageing population, the number of people suffering from chronic illness has increased by more than 4% each year, which is larger than the increase in funding and the GDP growth of Hong Kong. [10] With one of the longest life expectancies in the world (81 years for males and 86 for females), people are living longer, but not necessarily healthier. [2, 11] Hence, we are dealing with an acute situation of ever-increasing demand for medical and health services.\n\nFurthermore, due to improvements in medical services and patients' rights, more and more services have been demanded by the public and are being made available to patients, although some of the services require long waiting times (such as specialist out-patient clinics). A better management of the duration of stay in the hospital is an important element for controlling healthcare expenditures. Possible adverse patient satisfaction, arising from shorter stays, has not been included in the assessment; however, studies in the Netherlands suggest higher patient satisfaction scores for some specific items in hospital wards with shorter lengths of stay. [12] Additionally, the workload for the medical and health staff due to the shorter stays has not been properly measured and reflected in cost considerations. For example, arranging for surgery in the day, rather than admitting the patient overnight, implies that medical and health workers have less time to do the preparation and provide the necessary services for operation. These are important elements and are consistently neglected in assessing the \"cost-effectiveness\" of shorter stays in the hospital. 12 There are some limitations in applying the decomposition method as described in this study.\n\nFirst, it is a non-parametric method and can be used only as an exploratory method. Second, we assume the workload on the medical and health workers per hospitalized day for any patient is the same, which is unlikely to be true. It is has been reported that the implementation of day surgery arrangements-as opposed to admitting the patient a day earlier-has indeed caused excessive workload for medical and healthcare workers. A simple count of the number of hospitalized days might not properly reflect the additional work arising from the reduction of the mean duration of hospital stays. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\n1. It is the first paper of this kind to examine the three factors in decomposing the decline the hospitalization days during the period 2000-2010.\n\n2. The paper provides an empirical account of the effect of reduction of the mean duration of stay per visit to the reduction of number of hospitalization days in Hong Kong.\n\n3. The increase of the number of patients and the increase of the number of visit per patient can be offset by the reduction of the average duration of stay per visit.\n\n4. The reduction of the average duration of stay can vary among various diseases codes. However, there is quite a substantial proportion of missing information on the disease code in the data, no result was available. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   5   adults aged 65 or over in 2012 and increase to more than one third by 2041 and it would have significant impact on health and medical services. [8] [9] [10] [11] In this study we aim to investigate the factors on reduction of total hospitalization days which directly relates to healthcare costs. According to the latest report by the Hospital Authority, despite an increase in population size from 6.7 to 7.0 million and the number of patients (583,000 to 664,000) from 2000 to 2010, there has been a significant reduction in the total number of hospitalization days.\n\nWe examine the factors contributing to the reduction: total hospitalization days are made up of three factors: the number of inpatients per thousand people of the general population, the number of visits per patient, and the duration of the stay in the hospital per visit. Apparently. The increase in population size, patient population, and the number of visits per patient in a given\n\nyear has been offsetting by the improvement in the management of patients, in terms of the reduction of the mean duration of the number of days per visit, resulting in a 30% reduction of the hospitalization days. In the present study, we use the decomposition method to examine and quantify the impact of the mean duration on the other two factors: total number of patients per 1,000 people of the general population, and the mean number of visits per year in assessing its impact on the total number of hospitalization days.\n\nIn order to investigate the factors contributing to the changes in the average number of hospitalized days per person between 2000 and 2010 in Hong Kong, data on total population and 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 In order to measure change in the hospitalization days in the community during this period, we compute the ratio of average population-based admission days between year a and year b as follows:\n\nwhere Ratio MS is the ratio of the mean duration of stay in year a to year b; Ratio F is the ratio of the mean frequency of hospital admission in year a to year b; and Ratio HR is the ratio of hospitalization rate in year a to year b. Thus, the relative change of hospitalized days per person during the period a and b is calculated as:\n\nThe decomposition of hospital admission days per person in year a and year b can be expressed as a product of three factors: the relative discrepancy between mean duration of stay (MS), the relative difference of frequency of hospital admissions (F), and the relative change of hospitalization rate (HR).\n\nThe relative contribution of each of the three factors to the discrepancy in average populationbased hospitalized days can be calculated as follows: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   8   (iv) where RC i is the relative contribution of the i-th factor to the difference. [11, 12] \n\nFrom 2000 to 2010, more than 515,000 individuals (1 million episodes) were admitted into public hospitals in Hong Kong per year ( Figure 1 ). Figure 4 ). In particular, the reduction was reflected more in males (35.4%, from 7.38 days to 4.77 days) than in females (30.3%, from 6.33 days to 4.41 days). However, we note that the number of hospital beds in Hospital Authority hospitals during the period has been reduced by 8.1% . [14] Moreover, the total hospitalized days decreased by 17.1% between 2000 and 2010 ( Table 1) . Table 2 give the relative contribution of the differences in mean length of stay, frequency of admission, and hospitalization rate by the decomposition method from 2000 to 2010. Applying equation (iv), the relative contributions of each factor are calculated as follows:\n\nIn short, the reduction in hospitalized days per person from 2000 to 2010 of 200.6% is contributed to by the decrease of mean duration of stay, and it is offset by -51.1% due to the slight growth in the frequency of public hospital admissions and -49.4% by the difference of hospital admission rates (see Table 2 ). 11 The results of decomposition stratified by age and gender are presented in Table 3 and Table 4 . \n\nThe total number of hospitalization days is the most crucial factor in determining financial funding and planning of the public hospital system in Hong Kong. [1] Reducing hospital patient days has become one of the major health care policy and practice all over the world. [4, 15] Comparing with 26 OECD countries, the average length of stay for all diagnosis causes in Hong nature of relationship between length of stay and quality needs to be acknowledged.\" [5, 17] Our results confirmed that the mean duration of stay plays a very significant role in determining the number of hospitalization days. Despite that, the frequency of visits per patient has increased from 1.98 to 2.14, and the hospital admission rate increased from 87.43 to 94.51 (possibly due to the ageing of the population). We still observed a 21% reduction in the number of hospitalized days per person, which contributes to the reduction of the mean duration of stay from 6.83 to 4.58 days. Hence, even a shorter average stay per hospital visit, which could induce an increase in the number of re-visits, still leads to a reduction in the total number of hospitalization days.\n\nThe number of people suffering from chronic illness has increased by more than 4% each year, which is larger than the anticipated increase in funding for medical & health service and the GDP growth of Hong Kong.\n\n[8] With one of the longest life expectancies in the world (81 years for males and 86 for females), people are living longer, but not necessarily healthier. [10, 9] Hence, we are dealing with an acute situation of ever-increasing demand for medical and health services which is being realized in term of the increase in hospitalization. Furthermore, due to improvements in medical services and patients' rights, more and more services have been demanded by the public and are being made available to patients, although some of the services require long waiting times (such as specialist out-patient clinics). A better management of the duration of stay in the hospital is an important element for containing the increase in healthcare expenditures. Possible adverse patient satisfaction, arising from shorter stays, has not been included in the assessment; however, studies in the Netherlands suggest no correlation between shorter LOS and patient satisfaction.except in pulmonology .\n\n[20] Also, the patient satisfaction However, the workload for the medical and health staff due to the shorter stays has not been properly measured and reflected in cost considerations. For example, arranging for day surgery, rather than admitting the patient overnight, implies that medical and health workers would have less time to do the preparation and provide the necessary services for operation. A recent survey in Hong Kong public hospitals indicated a very high burnt-out rate and increasing workload was one major factor. [2] These are important elements and are consistently neglected in assessing the \"cost-effectiveness\" of shorter stays in the hospital.\n\nThere are some limitations in applying the decomposition method as described in this study.\n\nFirst, it is a non-parametric method and can be used only as an exploratory method.

A simple count of the number of hospitalized days might not properly reflect the additional work arising from the reduction of the mean duration of hospital stays. The change of the case mix of has not been incorporated in examining the change in hospitalization days, however, there is no significant change in morbidity and mortality pattern in Hong Kong during the period and the effect on the results is expected to be limited. Nevertheless, the complicated nature of the relationship between length codes. However, there is quite a substantial proportion of missing information on the disease code in the data, no result was available.\n\nArticle Focus:\n\n\u2022 Increase of health expenditure mainly arising from the hospitalization cost has become a serious concern in all developed countries. to balance and confront. Also disease patterns differ in different age groups. Thus it may be useful to study age differences in reduction of hospitalization.\n\nIn this study we aim to investigate the factors on reduction of total hospitalization days which directly relates to healthcare costs.

However, there are quite a significant proportion of the patient data with missing disease code and we will not examine the disease-code specific duration of stay in this analysis.\n\nHere we define the hospitalized days per person (HD) as the total number of hospitalized days in all public hospitals during the examining year (D) divided by the total population in the same year (P). The average population-based hospitalized days is expressed as: The relative contribution of each of the three factors to the discrepancy in average populationbased hospitalized days can be calculated as follows:\n\nwhere RC i is the relative contribution of the i-th factor to the difference.

Thus, while reducing length of stay, controlling health care expenditure and a good quality care or satisfaction of health care are the key challenges we have to balance and confront.\n\nBecause disease patterns differ for each age group, age differences in reduction of hospitalization should also be considered. [5] Hospitalization costs are a major component of healthcare expenditures in Hong Kong with a 7.0 million population. Healthcare expenditure has been increasing, accounting for 25% of Government expenditures which is relatively higher in comparing to other countries. [6] About 80% of inpatients come from public hospitals under the Hospital Authority. [7] The public healthcare sector currently accounts for over 90% of total secondary and tertiary care, while its subsidy from the Government has reached 95%. The public pays HK$100 (US$13) per day to receive inpatient services, while the average operating cost per hospital bed is about HK$3,300 (US$350) a day. Furthermore, Hong Kong is facing an acute ageing problem with a 14% of older In the present study, we use a decomposition method to examine and quantify the impact of the mean duration of stay on the other two factors: total number of patients per 1,000 people of the general population, and the mean number of visits per year in assessing its impact on the total number of hospitalization days. (Table 1) were collected from the Census and Statistics Department and Hospital Authority, respectively. The Census statistics include both sexes and ages for the whole population. The Hospital Authority provides the episode-based hospitalization data which contain information on age, gender, hospital, date of birth, district of residence, date of admission and discharge, disease code, duration of stay for each visit, and discharge destination. However, there are quite a significant proportion of the patient data with missing disease code and we will not examine the disease-code specific duration of stay in this analysis. Also, Although the capacity of the Hong Kong hospital system varies throughout the years and the overall occupancy rate is about 90% on average.. The hospital service model in Hong Kong remains relatively unchanged during the study period. It is assumed that mix of clinical services and patient case mix of the public hospital system has stayed constant over the 11-year period.\n\nHere we define the hospitalized days per person (HD) as the total number of hospitalized days in all public hospitals during the examining year (D) divided by the total population in the same year (P).

Reducing hospital patient days has become one of the major health care policy and practice all over the world. [5, 16] Comparing with 26 OECD countries, the average length of stay for all diagnosis causes in Hong Kong hospitals dropped the most (30.0%) from 2002 to 2010, whereas that in Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States reduced 23.1%, 15.0%, 18.7% and 2.0%, respectively. The actual number of days in Hong Kong (6.3 to 4.4) was longer than that of Mexico (4.2 to 3.9) and United States (4.9 to 4.8) but had a similar range like in Australia (6.5 to 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   13 5.0), Denmark (6.0 to 4.6), and Norway (5.7 to 4.5). However, does the significant drop of duration of stay in hospitals imply an improvement in health care services over time? A good quality of care is as essential as the efficiency of the health care system. Shortening in-hospital length of stay may be consistent with an orderly and systematic care pathway, but a longer length of stay might be regarded as appropriate for extended treatment. \"The problematic nature of relationship between length of stay and quality needs to be acknowledged.\" [17] Our results showed that the mean duration of stay plays a very significant role in determining the number of hospitalization days against an overall hospital occupancy of 90%. Despite that, the frequency of visits per patient has increased from 1.98 to 2.14, and the hospital admission rate However, the workload for the medical and health staff due to the shorter stays has not been properly measured and reflected in cost considerations. A recent survey in Hong Kong public hospitals indicated a very high burn-out rate and increasing workload was one major factor. [22] Certainly, additional investment in human resources and equipment as well as utilization of newer technologies are measures that can counteract the effect of patients volume on health care workers workload. These are important service quality considerations in assessing the \"cost-effectiveness\" of shorter stays in the hospital.\n\nThere are some limitations in applying the decomposition method as described in this study.\n\nFirst, it is a non-parametric method and can be used only as an exploratory method. Second, we assume the workload on the medical and health workers per hospitalized day for any patient is the same, which is unlikely to be true.

For example, arranging for day surgery, rather than admitting the patient overnight, implies that medical and health workers would have less time to do the preparation and provide the necessary services for operation as reflected by the frontline medical and health personnel to the authors. A recent survey in Hong Kong public hospitals indicated a very high burnt-out rate and increasing workload was one major factor.
