{"title": "", "body": "Cryptosporidiosis and the follicle-associated epithelium over the ileal Peyer's patch in calves . . Three calves were studied in stages of spontaneous cryptosporidial infection with particular reference to the relation of the cryptosporidia to the follicleassociated epithelium (FAE) over the ileal Pe~'er's patch (IPP) . In early infection scanning electron microscopy and streptavidin immunoperoxidase staining showed marked predilection of cryptosporidia for the FAt:. Cryptosporidial antigen was also found in subepithelial tissue. both in the domes over the II'P and in villi. apparently in macrophages. where the parasites seemed to be progressively degraded. The .'AE showed long tightly spaced microvilli. replacing normal low folds and protrusions. particularly in late infection. Endocytosis of indian ink was restricted to the cell periphery in late infection. contrasting the normal. more even distribution of endocytosis in the FAE apical cytoplasm. t'e\\\\ parasites were seen in the intestinal mucosa at this stage. At convalescence the FAE was normal. but all stages of infection were characterised by elongation of microvilli in absorptive cells.\n\nIN a previous study frequent lesions of the follicleassociated epithelium (FAE) over the ileal Peyer's patch (11'1') were associated with sponlaneous diarrhoea in calves where rotavirus and chlamydia seemed to be the major pathogenic agents (Landsverk 1981 b) . The present study concerns another frequent infection in calves. cryptosporidiosis (review, Angus 1983 ) with respect to changes in the FAE. Such studies have attracted particular interest after the demonstration that the 11'1' is responsible for the antigenindependent primary generation of B-lymphocytes in sheep (Reynolds and Morris 1984 , Gerber et al 1986 . Disturbances of the 11'1' function arising as a result of infections may thus have consequences for the individual's ability to develop immunity later in life. Since changes of the rAE often may be of an apparently persistent nature (Landsverk 1981 b) emphasis is given to examination of both early and late phases of the disease. Some attention is also given to the possibility that the FAE may function in antigen transfer to immunocompetent lymphoid tissue,\n\nThree Norwegian Red calves were examined (calves 1.2 and 3). two males and one female, aged 25, 20 and 30 days, respectively, on the day of killing. The calves had been raised conventionally, with colostrum immediately after birth and thereafter whole cow's milk, and later a milk replacer. Spontaneous diarrhoea occurred in all three calves. They were kept in neighbouring pens. Calf I was killed at the start of the diarrhoea. calf 2 in the late phase of the diarrhoea (II days after the start of diarrhoea) and calf 3 eight days after the cessation of diarrhoea. which. for this calf, lasted for 10 days. Faeces in calves 2 and 3 were mucinous, whitish yellow and sometimes contained small amounts of blood.\n\nIn the acute stage of the disease cryptosporidia were found in faecal smears stained with modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain (Henriksen and Pohlenz 1981) or the streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique (see below). Examination of faeces for other pathogenic parasities, bacteria and viruses was negative. The methods used in the bacteriological examinations have been described (Landsverk et al 1983) , Direct electron microscopy of faeces was done on\" faecal suspensions prepared as described by Flewett (1978) , placed on carbon-Formvar coated grids, dried and negatively stained in potassium phosphotungstate. Frozen sections examined for rotavirus and coronavirus were likewise negative; the methods for immunofluorescence have been described (Landsverk et al 1983) , Three healthy calves, 18, 20 and 26 days old, two females and one male, from the same farm, were used as controls,\n\nIntestinal specimens were obtained through a right flank laparotomy during anaesthesia with pentobarbital (20 mg kg I bodyweight). Before sampling. endocytic ability of the FAE over the 11'1' was tested by injecting a solution of 5 to 10\" per cent colloidal carbon (Pelican Cll/1431 A) in saline or phosphate buffered saline into a 10 cm tied loop at the ileal insertion of the ileocaecal fold. Various sites in the small and large intestine were sampled, including proximal and distal portions of the (PP. After 30 minutes the loops were removed and immersed in a fixative containing O' 7 per cent paraformaldehyde, 0'9 per cent glutaraldehyde, and 140 mmol litre-) sodium cacodylate, pH 7\u00b7 2. Specimens for morphometry were fixed in Carnoy's solution.\n\nAn adjacent portion of the IPP was frozen in monochloroditluoromethane (Prestogas) chilled with liquid nitrogen. Tissue was stored at -70\u00b0C until tested. Cryostat sections about 8 /Am were fixed in acetone for 10 minutes. Alternatively, sections were fixed in 4 per cent formaldehyde, 67 mmollitre-) calcium chloride, pH 7\u00b72 for five minutes and then treated with 3 per cent hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 minutes to block the endogenous peroxidase. Immunoperoxidase staining for cryptosporidia included human con- valescent serum as a source of primary antibody. Normal human serum was used as a control. The sera were obtained from Dr W. L. Current, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis and Dr R. Bergquist, Ulleval Hospital, Oslo. Biotinylated sheep anti-human Ig (Amersham, RPN 1003) was used as a secondary antibody. Streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (SHe) (Amersham, RPN 1051) was then added. Finally the sections were treated with a diaminobenzidine (DAH) hydrochloric acid solution (Sigma) containing 6 mg 10 ml-) DAB, 45 /AI 3 per cent hydrogen peroxide 10 ml-) of a 50 mmol litre -I imidazole solution (Boehringer Mannheim), pH 7'4. Dilution of sera and washing between each of the steps in the procedure was made with phosphate buffered saline.\n\nPieces of fixed tissue for light microscopy (LM) were 1981) . Morphometric examination of follicle size was performed as described elsewhere (Landsverk 1981 b) . Before processing of specimens for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) digital pressure fracturing (Miyai 1978) was performed on fixed tissue. The procedure frequently exposed the surface of the domes, otherwise often inaccessible with the conventional sectioning of tissue, The specimens were then washed in distilled water, dehydrated in acetone, critical-point dried, and sputter-coated with gold. The coated samples were examined in a Jeol 50 A scanning electron microscope (Jeol, Akishama, Tokyo), with an accelerating voltage of 10 to 15 kV. Photographs were recorded on a Polaroid type 52 film.\n\nSpecimens for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were post fixed in 2 per cent cacodylate buffered osmium tetroxide for two hours, dehydrated in acetone and embedded in Epon. The ultrathin sections were cut with diamond knives and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. calf I (early infection), affecting mainly the distal small intestine. Over the 11'1' cryptosporidia were more numerous in the FAE than in the adjacent absorbing epithelium. Villi showed partial atrophy and had a low irregular epithelium infiltrated with leucocytes. The crypts were elongated. Fusion of the FAE with absorbing epithelium was sometimes seen (Figs I and 2). Calf 2 (late infection) had only a few cryptosporidia in the brush border, whereas no cryptosporidia were seen in calf 3 (convalescent). Fusion of the FAE and absorbing epithelium was only rarely seen in calves 2 and 3.\n\nInjection of colloidal carbon into intestinal loops showed an abnormal pattern of carbon particle distribution for calf 2. Whereas particles were seen evenly distributed throughout the apical cytoplasm of the FAE in the controls, calf 2 had particles concentrated to the periphery of the epithelial cells. giving ring-shaped staining in tangential sections (Figs  3 and 4) .\n\nMorphometric estimation of follicle size did not reveal any significant differences between calves infected with cryptosporidia and controls.\n\nImmunoperoxidase staining with the SHe technique revealed numerous cryptosporidia in the luminal border of the FAE in calf 1 (Fig 5) . Cryptosporidial antigen was also found subepithelially in the dome, apparently within macrophages. Cryptosporidia were less numerous in villi and usually associated with villous tips. They were also smaller, probably being composed of younger stages. In formol-calcium fixed sections, where the endogenous peroxidase had been inhibited by hydrogen peroxide treatment, cryptosporidial antigen was seen in apparent macrophages in the lamina propria of the villi over the IPP as well as proximal to the IPP (Fig 6) . Sometimes the reacting material within the leucocytes had the appearance of the brush border cryptosporidia. More often, smaller particles were found, probably formed by degradation of larger particles. In the apparent final stages of degradation a faint granular staining was seen within the leucocytes. Faecal smears taken in the acute phase of diarrhoea and stained with the SBe technique or the modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain verified the presence of cryptosporidia at this stage also in calves 2 and 3. SEM confirmed the presence of cryptosporidia in calf I. More parasites were associated with the FAE than with the absorbing epithelium (Fig 7) . The organisms varied in size, apparently corresponding to developmental stages. The characteristic concentric ridges seen in the luminal membrane of the FAE in normal calves at this age (Fig 8) were mostly apparent, although often somewhat irregular (Fig 9) . In addition, many cells had a flattened surface without ridges or microvilli, interpreted as remodelled epithelial cells closing epithelial defects (Fig 7) . Ordinary villi were shortened, had an uneven surface, and microvilli of varying length.\n\nIn calf 2 occasional oocyst-like structures were seen at the mucosal surface; endogenous stages were rare. The FAE showed marked disappearance of surface ridges, the surface containing a central tuft of elongated tightly spaced microvilli and a peripheral flattened zone. Calf 3 had a normal FAE, and no parasites were found. Both calves 2 and 3 showed marked irregularities in the microvillous zone of the absorptive epithelium in the ileum and the colon, having the appearance of an unevenly cut lawn (Fig 10) . The apparent variation in microvillous length between adjacent populations of absorbing epithelial cells was not seen in any of the controls. TEM showed the various stages of parasite development in calf I, including trophozoites, gametocytes and schizonts. The parasites in the FAE were often found in stages of degeneration. Macrophages within and beneath the FAE often contained cryptosporidialike structures within phagosomes, although the structures could not be convincingly identified because of the lysosomal degradation. TEM confirmed the SEM changes of the FAE luminal membrane of calves I and 2. Microvilli tended to be longer than normal, particularly in calf 2. The elongated microvilli contained longitudinal filaments inserted deeply into the apical FAE cytoplasm (Figs II and 12) . In the central microvillous zone of FAE of calf 2 vesicles interpreted as endocytic were present, although rare. Most of the endocytosis, as judged from the uptake of colloidal carbon, appeared to take place in the periphery of luminal membrane of this calf. Cryptosporidia were rare in calf 2. Calf 3 had a normal FAE morphology and no parasites were seen. \n\nThe present study indicates a marked predilection of cryptosporidia for the FAE over the 11'1'. Previously, the same has been suggested for chlamydia (Landsverk 1981b) and astrovirus (Wood et al 1984) . There are studies in other mammalian species suggesting that the PI' is also susceptible to infections (Sprinz et al 1956 , La Brec and Formal 1961 , Carter and Collins 1974 , Hohmann et al 1978 , although the ruminant FAE over the 11'1' is of a type different from that so far described over the PI' in other mammals. The properties of FAE over the 11'1' that may contribute to a predilection by microorganisms are not known. Among the possible factors may be absence of goblet cells in the FAE, a modified cell surface and enzyme activity (Torres-Medina 198 I, Landsverk 1981 a) and a low frequency of antibody secreting plasma cells in the domes (T. Landsverk, unpublished) . Of interest is the recent demonstration that the FAE over the human PI' is deficient in secretory component, which suggests that this FAE lacks IgA transporting capacity (Brandtzaeg 1985) . No comparable studies have been made in ruminants, but such a condition if present, would render the epithelium more susceptible to infections.\n\nCryptosporidia did not cause extensive fusion of domes with adjacent mucosa in contrast to a combined chlamydia and rotavirus infection (Landsverk 198Ib) . The fact that follicle size was also unaffected suggests that no major decrease in the IPP lymphopoiesis occurs during cryptosporidiosis, The altered pattern of endocytosis of indian ink may likewise have had little consequence for the lymphopoiesis in the follicles, although subtle qualitative changes may not have been detected with the present technique.\n\nThe growth of microvilli in both the FAE and the absorbing epithelium suggests an influence of a s01uble factor and not a direct effect of the parasite. Elongation of the microvilli closely adjacent to the parasites has been reported (Pohlenz et al 1978) . However, in the present material the change was also found in cases where parasites were rare. Exotoxins have, so far, not been associated with cryptosporidia, and the cause of the change therefore remains obscure. The consequences of microvillous growth in the FAE seem to include a conformation of luminal membrane that is less compatible with an endocytic function. Endocytosis is apparently one of the main functions of the FAE, its normal lack of rigid cytoskeletal elements and special surface morphology rendering it well equipped for that purpose. The altered pattern of endocytosis of colloidal carbon demonstrated in the present study may thus be due to the growth of microvilli.\n\nA special role in antigen uptake and induction of mucosal immunity has been attributed to the dome over the PP (review, Brandtzaeg 1985) . The uptake of carbon particles in the FAE over the IPP demonstrated here confirms an earlier work in lambs (Reynolds and Morris 1983), and may be associated with such an antigen sampling function. Calf rotavirus has likewise been shown to be taken up through endocytosis by the FAE over the IPP (Torres-Medina 1984) . In cryptosporidiosis of man a high antibody titre develops (Campbell and Current 1983) , probably due to a transport of antigen to the subepithelial tissue allowing an encounter with immunocompetent cells. The cryptosporidia may otherwise be inaccessible to the immune system, hidden as they are in a pocket of th~apical epithelial cell membrane (Hampton and Rosario 1966) . It is quite possible that cryptosporidial antigen may be transported to the subepithelial tissue by phagocytosis of the FAE over the IPP. The FAE over the IPP has thus been shown to phagocytise Q. 6 lAm latex particles (T. Landsverk, unpublished) . However, the fact that cryptosporidial antigen was also found in the lamina propria of villi, even proximal to the IPP, suggests that the phagocytising capacity of the FAE was not indispensable to the transport of the antigen.\n\nThe mechanism by which cryptosporidial antigen actually was transported into the subepithelial tissue could not be definitely established on the basis of the present observations. Macrophages seemed to play an important role, and in Giardia murisinfection of mice macrophages were shown to be responsible for trapping of the protozoa in the epithelium (Owen et al 1981) . It may nevertheless be suggested that as far as the IPP and cryptosporidia are concerned, there seems to be no exclusive role in antigen uptake for the domes over the IPP."}
