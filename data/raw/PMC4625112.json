(Note: The MERS-CoV spike protein should be codon optimised) [3], [5].\n\nLentiviral vector plasmid expressing firefly luciferase: pCSFLW [8], [11].\n\nSecond-generation lentiviral packaging construct plasmid: p8.91 (expressing HIV-gag) [8], [12].\n\nTimeline: Transfection \u2013 24 h1.293T/17 cells should be subcultured into 100 mm Petri dishes at a ratio that will yield 70\u201390% confluence at the time of transfection. In our hands this protocol yields similar results regardless of Petri dish size when supernatant yield is equivalent.Timeline: Day of transfection2.DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S and Opti-MEM\u00ae should be pre-warmed to 37 \u00b0C using a water bath or similar.3.Prepare and label two sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes (tube 1 and tube 2) per transfection.4.Add the following plasmids (0.9:1:1.5 envelope:core:vector ratio) for transfection to tube 1:a.pCAGGS-MERS-CoV spike: 0.9 \u03bcg.b.p8.91-lentiviral vector: 1.0 \u03bcg.c.pCSFLW: 1.5 \u03bcg.5.Add 200 \u03bcl Opti-MEM\u00ae to the plasmid DNA mix (tube 1).6.Add 200 \u03bcl Opti-MEM\u00ae and 35 \u03bcl of 1 mg/ml PEI to tube 2.7.Incubation step. Mix both tubes by gently flicking and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (RT).8.After incubation, pipette the Opti-MEM\u00ae/PEI solution from tube 2 into the Opti-MEM\u00ae/DNA solution in tube 1.9.Incubation step. Gently flicking the tube to mix every 3\u20134 min, incubate the tube at RT for 20 min.10.While transfection mix is incubating, the culture media on the 293T/17 cells should be removed and 7 ml of fresh DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S added. It is important at this point to add media slowly to one side of the dish to avoid detaching adherent cells.11.After 20 min incubation, pipette the DNA/Opti-MEM\u00ae/PEI solution onto the 293T/17 cells by adding dropwise over the complete area of the plate. Swirl the plates gently to ensure even dispersal.12.Incubation step. Incubate the plate at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 overnight (o/n). In our hands incubation times of between 12 and 16 h result in equivalent final pseudotype production titres.Timeline: 12\u201316 h post transfection13.Post o/n incubation the media on the cells should be changed and 7 ml fresh DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S added. Add media slowly to one side of the plate to avoid cell detachment.14.Incubate the plates 37 \u00b0C 5% CO2 o/n for 32\u201336 h.Timeline: 44\u201352 h post transfection15.Supernatant containing the viral pseudotype particles are harvested using a 10 ml sterile syringe and then filtered into falcon tubes via a syringe driven Millex HA-0.45 \u03bcm filter.16.Store all filtered supernatant at \u221280 \u00b0C. It is recommended that supernatant is stored as aliquots to avoid multiple freeze thaw cycles. Note: Supernatant may be stored at 4 \u00b0C for up to one week with no detectable loss of titre.17.Optional step: Additional media may be added to cells to allow a second harvest 18\u201324 h later by adding further DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S. In this case extreme care must taken in initial pseudotype collection (step 15) to avoid damage to cell monolayer. We have observed that cells in poor health after first harvest yield significantly less viral particles upon second harvest.\n\nNote: A control pseudotype virus may be created by following the steps outlined above but leaving out the pCAGGS-MERS-CoV spike construct. This produces particles that do not express the viral surface glycoprotein and therefore should be unable to transduce target cells (\u0394-env control) [3].\n\nNote: Titration consists of transduction of reporter (in this case firefly luciferase) into target cells mediated by the viral glycoprotein expressed on the viral pseudotype. Controls for titrations are provided via the inclusion of \u201ccell only\u201d and \u201c\u0394-env\u201d columns.1.In a 96 well white plate add 50 \u03bcl of DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S to the entire column of \u201ccell only\u201d control (see Fig. 1 column 12).2.Add 50 \u03bcl of DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S from row B to H that are to contain pseudotyped virus or \u0394-env control.3.Add 100 \u03bcl of MERS pseudotype virus supernatant to each well of row A (excluding control columns) and add 100 \u03bcl of \u0394-env to column 11 (see Fig. 1).4.Remove 50 \u03bcl from row 1 virus-containing wells and perform 1:2 serial dilutions down all wells below.5.With each dilution step use pipette to mix 8 times up and down.6.After completing serial dilution the final 50 \u03bcl from the last well of each column should be discarded. Note: at this point each well should contain 50 \u03bcl of mixed DMEM and viral supernatant.7.Prepare a plate of susceptible target cells (Huh-7) (preferentially subcultured 1:4 48 h before):a.Remove media from plate.b.Wash the plate with 2 ml of trypsin and discard trypsin.c.Add additional 2 ml of trypsin to the plate to detach cells.d.After cells have detached add DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S to the plate to quench trypsin activity.e.Count cells using TC20\u2122 Automated Cell Counter or haemocytometer and add 1x104 cells in a total volume of 50 \u03bcl to each well.8.Centrifuge plate for 1 min at 500 rpm if there are droplets on the sides of the wells.9.Incubate the plate for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C 5% CO2.10.Read plate using Bright Glo\u2122 luciferase assay system or equivalent.\n\nFig. 2 displays data recorded from multiple transfections indicating consistency of results. Results are measured in Relative Luminescence Units (RLUs) as measured using a GloMax\u00ae 96 Microplate Luminometer and the Bright Glo\u2122 luciferase assay system. The pseudotype particles generated in the absence of viral envelope (Delta) show increased luciferase activity compared to cell only in part due to transformation method used to discern RLU per ml. The presence of some carry-over luciferase within viral particles is also likely to generate an increase in RLU values recorded (Table 1).\n\nFig. 3 shows percentage neutralisation of the MERS-CoV pseudotype with commercially produced anti-MERS spike antibody. Figure clearly indicates that as the dilution factor increases, so the percentage neutralisation decreases, 100% neutralisation indicates that RLU values at this concentration are equivalent to a delta envelope control.\n\nThe protocol outlined here provides a rapid and consistent method for the generation of high-titre viral pseudotype particles expressing the MERS-CoV spike protein suitable for further downstream applications [2], [4], [5], [7]. Efficient knock-down of pseudotype virus entry using a polyclonal antibody directed against the spike glycoprotein (Fig. 3) demonstrates potential utility for vaccine immunogenicity and Mab/antiviral screening [3]. The use of readily available reagents should facilitate increased reproducibility [1], [6], [9], [10], [11], [12]."}
