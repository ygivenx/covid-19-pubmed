{"title": "The 2 nd International Workshop on Pervasive and Ambient Applications, Systems and Technologies for Healthcare (PASTH 2012) HAIKU: A Semantic Framework for Surveillance of Healthcare-Associated Infections peer-review under responsibility of [name organizer]", "body": "Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) are a common complication of patient care, and are caused by exposure to various bacteria, fungi, or viruses in settings such as hospitals, long-term care facilities, rehabilitation centers, and community clinics [1] . Some of the most common HAI's are bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections (UTIs), surgical site infections (SSIs), pneumonia, tuberculosis, Clostridium difficile infections, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections (MRSA), severe acute respiratory syndrome, gastroenteritis, pertussis, and ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). HAIs impose tremendous direct (e.g. hospitalization, utilities, devices, medications, lab tests, etc.), indirect (e.g. mortality, lost/wages, etc.), and intangible (e.g. anxiety, disability, job loss, pain, etc.) costs [2] . In the United States, HAIs are estimated to result in \"direct annual costs of $35.7 -$45.0 billion for hospitals and healthcare facilities with combined medical costs of $20,549 -$25,903 per infection occurrence\" [2] . Many of the HAIs and related costs can be effectively prevented through proper surveillance and control plans. In most hospitals in Canada, infection control practitioners rely upon routine microbiology test results to flag patients with a possible HAI. Once a patient is flagged, staffs gather the patient's data from multiple sources to determine whether a HAI has occurred [3] . Automating this data gathering and integration is currently very challenging because the data in each of the source systems lack the contextual information necessary for automated integration and reasoning. Standardization and consistent integration of disparate biomedical data, however, would enable automated data integration and reasoning. This capacity could improve the decision-making process by allowing infection control staff to querying over several heterogeneous knowledge sources. In this context, a knowledge-based approach to surveillance of Healthcare-Associated Infections could advance data and knowledge integration, and thereby decrease the incidence of HAIs and facilitate effective resource allocation to improve patient care and enhance overall health systems performance.\n\nThe increasing success in the application of knowledge modeling to support automated data integration and reasoning has spurred an explosion in biomedical ontology development and a trend towards institutionalizing ontologies and standardizing representation language within information systems serving the biomedical sciences. Ontologies capture the domain knowledge by defining concepts, relationships, individuals, rules and axioms. Our research mainly focuses on the four most common HAIs (bloodstream infection, UTI's, SSIs, and pneumonia), often referred to as the \"Big Four\", due to the high morbidity and mortality rates.\n\nHAIs (more specifically, nosocomial infections) can be defined as one type of \"hospital adverse event\" as described in the Ontology of adverse event (OAE) [4] . It is also defined in the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) [5] as an infection \"resulting from a transmission process that unfolds in a hospital\". So as a first step, we have defined a set of properties to distinguish between HAIs and Community Acquired Infections (CAIs). In our early work [6] , we demonstrated the potential of the HAIKU framework ( Figure  1 ) in the domain of clinical intelligence for case detection, risk/causative factor identification/evaluation, and diagnostic factor identification/evaluation with a focus on surgical site infections (SSIs). We have also explored [7] the possibility of using SADI [8] Semantic Web services for semantic querying of clinical data and reported preliminary progress on prototyping a semantic querying infrastructure for the surveillance of, and research on hospital-acquired infections. The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we will describe our conceptual modelling method and ontology development approach. We represent the usability of our ontological framework in the domain in Section 3 through a set of semantic queries. The paper concludes a discussion of the implications of our study and possible future work directions. Fig. 1 . An abstract representation of the HAIKU framework, which assist physicians and infection control practitioners by providing recommendations used for case detection, risk stratification and diagnostic factor identification. The SADI semantic web services can populate the relevant HAI Ontology predicates based on the semantic mapping between the data warehouse schema and the ontology. Also the results of statistical inference from epidemiological and clinical data can be combined with the logical inference to enable inductive reasoning about formal knowledge in the ontological structure.\n\nThe HAIKU knowledge base has been developed using the W3C standard Web Ontology Language (OWL 2.0) 1 , which enables us to define complex concepts and the properties in the domain in a highly expressive manner. The HAI ontology represents general knowledge about HAI and should be reusable in multiple health care contexts. To adapt and customize the ontology for a specific use, however, concepts in the ontology must be mapped to data elements within information systems in a specific hospital. In this stage of our research project, we therefore aligned and mapped the concepts in the ontology to terms used in the local data warehouse (Figure 2 ) in the Ottawa Hospital (TOH). We used a subset of the data warehouse containing data for 715 cardiac surgery patients who had 6,132 encounters, received 12,275 diagnoses, and underwent 6,029 procedures [9] at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute between 2004-2007.\n\nOur conceptual model has been created based on the existing knowledge sources, textual resources and the relevant literature including the data provided by the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System [10] (from Jan 1992 -June 2004), the 2012 CDC/NHSN Surveillance definition of Healthcare-Associated Infections [11] , 2007 CDC Guideline for Isolation Precaution [12] , and several patient data from TOH. Also we have used several information resources (e.g., the databases containing information on hospital morbidity and discharge abstracts), existing bio-ontologies (e.g., SNOMED CT 2 , ICD-9 [13] , HL7 (http://www.hl7.org/), FMA [14] , CheBI [15] , Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO)). Fig. 2 . A partial view of the major entities in the Ottawa Hospital Data Warehouse data model. The three major components are Patient (represents patient level information), Encounter (captures encounter information), and Service (contains generic information regarding services received by patients during encounters). The services represented in the diagram may include radiology, pharmacy, transcription, laboratory services, etc.\n\nIn order to facilitate a broad semantic interoperability between the HAI Ontology and other related standards and ontologies we are aligning our ontology with SIO 3 , which offers an integrated upper level ontology (types, relations) for consistent knowledge representation across physical, processual and informational entities [16] . To support temporal knowledge management we have developed the Extra Simple Time Ontology (ESTO) 4 based on Allen's temporal logic [17] , which supports defining time instants, proper time intervals, and infinite time intervals. As an example, the following query can control if a specific time interval is subsumed by another interval.\n\nFor more information on ESTO we refer the readers to our recent paper [7] .\n\nIn existing surveillance approaches, the incidence of HAIs has been very difficult to document using statistical models alone, because statistics have been based upon different definitions. We combine the results of statistical inference from epidemiological and clinical data with formal knowledge to enables inductive reasoning about formal knowledge in the ontological structure. We also use these statistical data for enriching the background knowledge used for defining relationships (causal or associative), rules and other axioms within the HAIKU conceptual model. For example, admitted patients have different levels of susceptibility to acquiring an infection following exposure to a given infectious agent. Statistical models can be constructed to assist in the case detection process by estimating the probability that a patient is a suspect, probable or confirmed case, based on various criteria such as identification factors (e.g. readmission to hospital for therapy of SSI), risk factors (e.g. old age, or prolonged operative time) (Figure 3) and clinical findings (i.e. lab order, lab result, imaging, procedures, drug order, etc.) [9] . Fig. 3 . The general overview of the Trigger factors taxonomy (visualized using OntoGraph 5 ). The identification factors, which are usually identified after the development of HAI, can be used to identify confirmed cases, and risk factors can be used to infer the status of patients as a suspect or probable case. When infection control programs use risk factors, or identification factors, to trigger surveillance activities, they are referred to as trigger factors [9] .\n\nWe evaluate the ontology using OWL reasoners to check for consistency, satisfiability, expected or unexpected inferred relationships, and subsumption. To evaluate case detection methods, we rely on the results from the TOH's ongoing chart review process for HAI. We also assess the ontology based on its ability to meet the initial design requirements by defining different queries (simple or conjunctive) over the defined axioms. We use SADI services [7, 8] that populate the relevant HAI Ontology predicates based on the semantic mapping between the data warehouse schema and the ontology, using relevant data stored in the data warehouse. For querying purpose we use SPARQL 6 Query Language for RDF 7 \n\nHAIs place a major burden on patients and the healthcare system. Surveillance is critical for preventing HAI, but current surveillance efforts are limited by the need to manually integrate data, which lack uniform semantics and are scattered across disparate information systems. Knowledge modeling has been used successfully in many domains to add context to data and enable automated data integration and reasoning, especially in the form of query answering. Initial applications of knowledge modeling to surveillance have shown considerable promise, but they have been limited in the scope and the extent to which they have been used to drive knowledge-based surveillance systems within hospitals. In this paper we have described how our effort in knowledge modeling enabled us to address these limitations. Our proposed knowledge-based framework provides evidence on the ability of semantic technologies to support HAI surveillance. As future work we consider enriching the ontological structure to address more complex queries. We will also continue to explore the potential benefit of incorporating the results of the statistical inference into our logical framework. In particular, we intend to apply these enhancements to improving the accuracy of case detection."}
