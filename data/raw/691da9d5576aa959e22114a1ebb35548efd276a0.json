{"title": "", "body": "Infectious diseases occur frequently within last twenty years.\n\nThe The Eyring' rate process theory 8 and free volume concept [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] have been employed to solve many-body problems without involving complicated quantum mechanical calculations. The\n\nEyring's rate process theory, originated from quantum mechanics, argues that every physical or chemical phenomenon is a rate controlled process, such as chemical reactions, electron transfer, conductivity, viscous flows, diffusions, etc. Every process needs an activated energy to move from the initial state to the final state. Free volume theory, originated from molecular systems, is a most successful mean field theory in dealing with many-body problems.\n\nAll different kinds of interactions among entities are factored into a single term, the free volume available in a system. Since the free volume theory resolves how large freedom an entity may have and the Eyring's rate process theory describes how fast the process is, these two theories have been integrated together to describe many seemingly unrelated systems or phenomena like glass liquids 12 , colloids and polymers 14, 15 , granules [16] [17] [18] , electrical and proton conductivity 19, 20 , superconductivity 21 , and Hall Effect 22 with great success.\n\nIn this article, we will utilize the Eyring's rate process theory and free volume concept to describe infectious disease transmission process. The infectious disease transmission is considered as a sequential chemical reaction. We will follow the popular SIR (susceptible, inf ectious, and removed) and SEIR (susceptible, exposed, inf ectious, and removed) compartment categorization meth-ods proposed in the literature [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] to develop our theory. The difference between these two models can be found in literature 4 . SEIR model can give more information like latency period. Each category will be treated as a \"chemical reactant\". Its concentration or fraction expressed in the number of individuals in each segment divided by the total population in consideration will be estimated for unveiling disease transmission mechanisms and predicting peak time and peak infected population.\n\nConsidering that some of the recovered individuals may be infected again, we therefore add a backward reaction in the last step of the sequential chemical reaction. The whole infection process can be expressed as below:\n\nThe only difference between SIR and SEIR models is the initial step: SIR model assumes that the susceptible will directly transform into the infected, while SEIR model assumes that there is an intermediate state \"exposed\". For avoiding confusion with traditional SIR and SEIR models, we will call our modified versions as MSIR and MSEIR in this article. The key is how to theoretically determine chemical reaction rate constants like k 1 , k 2 , k 2 , k 3 , k 4 , k 5 , k 5 expressed in two chemical reactions shown above. Once these parameters are known, the fractions of S, E, I, R can be predicted. The first step in MSIR model and the second and third steps in MSEIR model are one way irreversible chemical reactions. The last step in both MSIR and MSEIR models are reversible. Note that both k 2 and k 5 should be very small and the initial fraction of the recovered should be small too, leading to a negligible contribution to the infected pool.\n\nFor the first step reaction, assume that susceptible individuals move randomly and become \"exposed\" first. The virus particles then transmit from one individual to another.\n\nThis individual thus becomes \"infected\". So in MSIR model, there should be two steps involved during the process from \"S\" to \"I\": the individual movement and virus particle movement. Human movement is a stochastic random process and should be similar to the movements of atoms, molecules, colloidal particles, and even granular powders, which have been studied extensively. Someone may argue that human movement is an athermal process, while atomic, molecular, and colloidal particle movements are thermal driven. For athermal granular powder under a tapping process, we theoretically found that they behave like thermal systems and follow the stretched exponential pattern in term of tap density changing with the number of taps 16 . Our approach is mainly based on Theodor F\u00f6rster's theory 23,24 that deals with the energy transfer from donors to random distributed acceptors.\n\nTheodor F\u00f6rster's theory involves a very complicated quantum mechanical treatment but its mathematical backbone was simplified and extracted by Blumen 25 and Klasfter 26 . Detailed information can be found in my previous article 16 . Furthermore, human collective motion and individual walking behaviors of animals were found to behave like thermal systems and follow Boltzmann distribution, though the temperature needs to be defined differently in these athermal systems 27, 28 . Utilizing the same approach to treat \"human movements\" in disease transmissions, we may write the reaction constant as 16 :\n\nwhere A and p are constant, \u03b2 is stretched exponential parameter of values between 0 and 1, E a is the energy barrier for a human to move around, and w is the basic energy that a person may need during a normal circumstance.\n\nAfter an individual is exposed, the transmission of virus particles from one person to another will make an \"exposed\" person become \"infected\". This process will be dependent on the free volume available for virus particles to travel and how fast these virus particles will travel. It should be similar to the viscosity or conductivity of an entity that has been addressed in many systems in my previous articles 12, 14, 19, 20, 29 . The free volume can be estimated with inter-particle spacing concept 14, 30 . For infectious diseases, more free volume for both human and virus particles means \"isolation\" and less transmission. High virus particle volume fractions mean higher transmissions, which is similar to viscosity of colloidal suspensions or granular powders. Therefore the chemical reaction rate should be proportional to the \"viscosity\" of this entity, then k 4 can be written as 29 :\n\nwhere V is the volume in consideration, r is the radius of virus particles, \u03c3 is the shear stress applied when virus particles transmit from one place to another,\u03b3 is the shear rate, N A is Avogadro number, m is the mass of a virus particle, k B is Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, \u03c6 is the volume fraction of virus particles in the volume V , \u03c6 m is the maximum packing fraction of virus particles, and E 0 is the energy barrier for virus particles.\n\nIn MSIR model, we assume that during the transmission process from the susceptible to the infected, both human movement and virus particle transmission are involved and the \"exposed\" is only an transient state. According to the transient state theory of chemical reaction 8 , we may easily obtain:\n\nEq.(1-3) indicate that infectious disease transmission is a complicated process, and is dependent on many factors like human movement energy barrier, the particle size and volume fraction of virus particles, the mass of a virus particle, temperature, and volume in consideration. Smaller volume leads to lower transmission constant, and isolation definitely is a good method to preventing virus from spreading.\n\nFor a sequential chemical reaction, the fraction of each reactant can be expressed with a series of differential equations 31 . For MSIR model, we may write:\n\nFor MSEIR model, we may write:\n\n5 All rights reserved.

Comparing these equations with our models expressed in Eq. 6 and Eq. 10, we may easily obtain R 0 as below:\n\nFor a reversible chemical reaction like the last step reaction between the infected and the removed, an equilibrium should be reached and the chemical reaction rate constant is \u03b3 = k 2 /k 2 for MSIR model and \u03b3 = k 5 /k 5 for MSEIR model. Clearly, R 0 actually is not a constant, dependent on temperature and virus particle volume fraction. So far we already know k 1 , k 3 , k 4 . The rate constants like k 2 , k 2 , k 5 , k 5 can be determined with the recovered data that are relatively easy to be counted during the initial period of virus outbreak. We then can predict the peak time, the peak infected, and the basic reproduction number, etc.\n\n7 All rights reserved.

The exposed and the infected peak at certain time and the recovered increases during the same time of period, which is consistent with observations and other models in the literature.\n\nSince k 1 and k 4 are functions of virus particle volume fraction and environment temperature, the fraction in each category should change with these two parameters, too. Besides virus particle volume fraction and temperature related terms in Eq. 2 and Eq. 3 , the remaining is related to virus particle radius and mass, and the spacial volume under consideration. Clearly, large virus particle size and mass lead to large rate constants. For clearly showing the relationship between rate constants and virus particle volume fraction and temperature, we may rearrange Eq. 2 and Eq. 3 as below:\n\nB and C are a constant for a specific virus and a spacial volume, when virus particles are under normal shear forces during a transmission. For simplification reason, we may assign a numeric value to both B and C, thus the impact of virus particle volume fraction and temperature on the fraction of the infected can be evaluated illustratively. The infected against virus particle volume fraction is plotted in Figure 2 . A much stronger dependence of virus particle volume fraction is predicted with MSIR model than MSEIR, possibly due to the buffering effect caused by the \"exposed\" category in the latter. For MSIR model, an explosive increase of the infection is predicted when virus particle volume reaches about 45%. It 8 All rights reserved.

The relationship between the infected and virus particle volume fraction seems to be reasonable, as intuitively more infection is expected if many virus particles are present in a system. Some researchers have already claimed that infectious disease transmissions are a percolation phenomenon in nature 36 and applied percolation theory to study epidemic spreading 36, 37 . Our prediction is in line with those research work. intentionally assign similar parameters for these two models for comparing epidemic difference.\n\nMSIR model predicts a earlier and higher infectious peak position than MSEIR model. S 0 is assumed to be 1.\n\nThe infected is not only dependent on virus particle volume fraction, but also dependent on the temperature, which is shown in Figure 3 . The energy barrier term E 0 of course determines how temperature may impact disease transmission rate thus the number of the infected. The infected in MSEIR model shows a much stronger temperature dependence and decreases rapidly with temperature changing from 0 to 60 \u2022 C, while the infected in MSIR model just decreases a little bit with temperature. Higher temperatures definitely can reduce 9 All rights reserved.

Unfortunately, these two groups of data provided by CCDC don't match each other and cannot be integrated into one model. If the same parameters like k 1 , k 2 , k 3 , k 4 , k 5 obtained from the infected data were used for the removed data regressions, the predicted with MSIR and MSEIR models were 8 and 13 times smaller than the reported, respectively, no matter that the recovered only or the addition of the recovered and the death is used. In average, there is almost 10 times difference between these two group of data. If the removed data are accurate, then the infected should be 10 times larger than the reported, which turns out that 724360 people should be infected by Feb. 17, 2020. Note that the regressions are relatively poor for the recovered and even worse for the recovered plus the death. The long latency period and lack of an effective drug to cure the disease may add complexity of claiming a patient to be fully recovered for this new kind of disease, which could contribute to the poor 12 All rights reserved.

Based on the data provided by CCDC, the peak time, the peak infected, the total infected based on the recovered data, and R 0 are estimated and shown in table I.

At each step, there is a chemical rate constant associated with and the fraction of each product/reactant can be easily calculated. Every step is a one-way reaction, except the last step from the infected to the removed, as some small amount of the removed could be infected again. The\n\nEyring's rate process theory and free volume concept continue to be used for defining rate constants.\n\nIn general, our model predicts that the fraction of the infected will peak at certain time, increase with the volume fraction of virus particles, and decrease with temperature. The energy barrier for human to move has played a critical role in disease transmissions. The isolation process with a huge energy barrier for human can change the chemical reaction rate constant dramatically. The basic reproduction number is not a constant and can be computed once the parameters in the models are determined.\n\nIn particular, we applied our models to treat coronavirus (Covid- 19) transmission. Based on the data provided by CCDC, we predict that the infected may peak at 158 days from Jan. 21, 2020 and may take a long time, more than a year, to drop to zero, though MSIR and MSEIR models give a slightly different estimation. The data of the infected don't match with the removed for both models: based on the infected data, the removed is predicted to be 8 and 13 times smaller than the actual reported according to MSIR and MSEIR models. If the removed data, either the recovered or the recovered plus the death, are reliable, the actual infected people is between 579488 and 941668 by Feb. 17, 2020. The basic reproduction number of coronavirus is computed to be about 1.5 based on MSIR model and 3.5 based on MSEIR model. All rights reserved.
