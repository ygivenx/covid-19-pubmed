Importantly, beside respiratory symptoms, consistent with other common respiratory virus infection when patients become viraemic, a significant number of COVID-19 patients also develop liver comorbidities.\n\nWe explored if specific target cell-type in the mammalian liver, could be implicated in disease pathophysiology other than the general deleterious response to cytokine storms. Here we employed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to survey the human liver and identified potentially implicated liver cell-type for viral ingress. We report the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a TROP2 + liver progenitor population.\n\nImportantly, we fail to detect the expression of ACE2 in hepatocyte or any other liver (immune and stromal) cell types. These results indicated that in COVID-19 associated liver dysfunction and cell death, viral infection of TROP2 + progenitors in liver may significantly impaired liver regeneration and could lead to pathology.\n\nKeywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, ACE2, TMPRSS2, TROP2, Liver, scRNA-seq Highlights:\n\n-EPCAM + Liver progenitors co-express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 -ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression is highest in TROP2 high progenitors -ACE2 and TMPRSS2 cells express cholangiocyte biased fate markers -ACE2 and TMPRSS2 positive cells are absent in human fetal liver\n\nSince December of 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has impacted millions of lives worldwide. As of 23 rd March 2020, more than 340,000 people are reported to be infected, with ~4-5% mortalities (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). The SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family of zoonotic viruses that infect mammals and birds (Andersen et al., 2020) . The novel SARS-CoV-2 was first isolated from lung airway epithelial cells of patient with pneumonia . Since then it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 employ receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into human cells and utilise Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for Spike (S) Protein priming (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 shares ~80% sequence similarity with SARS-CoV and ~50% with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), all of which cause severe respiratory symptoms (Hoffmann et al., 2020) .\n\nMoreover, in addition to respiratory disease, SARS and MERS are known to cause liver impairments (Alsaad et al., 2017; Chau et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2020) .\n\nImportantly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was discovered in stool sample of the first US patient, indicating gastrointestinal tract infection (Holshue et al., 2020) . A recent study reported 14-53% cases with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the liver of COVID-19 patients (Huang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . Moreover, these symptoms were elevated in intensive care unit (ICU) patients compared to patients who did not require ICU (Huang et al., 2020) . It remains to be investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 directly infect liver cells. In addition, concerns have been raised on effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pre-existing liver condition Mao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 and require TMPRSS2 for activation, we surveyed the human liver (from tumor and adjacent normal regions of hepatocellular carcinoma patients) by sc-RNA-seq to identify which cell type co-express these two genes.\n\nHere we report that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed in only one sub-population in human liver. Based on expression of cell type specific markers ALB (Albumin), KRT (Keratin), EPCAM and unique expression pattern of TROP2 (TACSTD2) and SOX9 (SRY-box 9), we annotated this population as liver progenitors. Our results suggest SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 is only expressed on TROP2 high cholangiocytebiased progenitors while serine protease TMPRSS2 is expressed by TROP2 high and TROP2 int population. These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection might preferentially infect the TROP2 high cholangiocyte-biased progenitor pool, thereby compromising the regenerative abilities of infected liver and/or contributing to liver pathology.\n\nWe performed scRNA-seq on human liver tissue obtained from tumor and adjacent normal tissue of hepatocellular carcinoma patients (Sharma et al., in revision) . In total, we analysed ~74,000 cells and employed Louvain algorithm for clustering of these cells. We identified 29 clusters based on the expression of cell type specific genes.\n\nThese clusters were further annotated into hepatocyte, epithelial progenitors, lymphoid and myeloid cells ( Figure 1A ) and observed specific enrichment of EPCAM + and SOX9 + epithelial progenitor cluster in normal liver ( Figure 1B) . We identified the specific markers for every cluster ( Figure 1C ) and observed the co-expression of KRT18 and KRT19 in epithelial progenitor cluster. Next, we investigated which cell types in the human liver co-express SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 and the priming enzyme TMPRSS2. Our analysis revealed the specific expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the epithelial progenitor cluster ( Figure 1D and 1E). This suggests that EPCAM + liver progenitors express machinery for both SARS-CoV-2 entry (ACE2) as well as priming (TMPRSS2) and might be susceptible for viral infection leading to liver dysfunction.\n\nA recent scRNA-seq study has suggested the heterogeneity in EPCAM + liver epithelial progenitors (Aizarani et al., 2019) . Therefore, we further sub-clustered the epithelial cells (hepatocytes and progenitors) to understand the nature of ACE2 expressing liver progenitors ( Figure 2A ). Sub-clustering also showed the predominant presence of normal liver cells in the progenitor cluster ( Figure 2B ). Further we detected the presence of these cells in adjacent normal region from multiple individuals ( Figure 2C ).\n\nInterestingly, lower abundance of these cells in human liver is in concordance with the .

Next, we analysed the expression of hepatocyte, cholangiocyte and bi-potent markers in these clusters. The progenitor cluster specifically expressed EPCAM (progenitor marker) as well as KRT19 and CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) which are known to be expressed in progenitors with a cholangiocyte fate bias ( Figure 2D ) (Cohn et al., 1993) . Importantly, we failed to detect expression of hepatocyte fate bias genes, ASGR1 (Asialoglycoprotein receptor 1) and ALB in this cluster. Since this progenitor cluster demonstrated bias for cholangiocyte fate we further investigated the expression of TROP2 gene. The TROP2 expression is known to mark the fate of liver epithelial progenitors where lower TROP2 expression is linked with hepatocyte fate and TROP2 high cells with cholangiocyte fate (Aizarani et al., 2019) .\n\nwhere TROP2 Int cells demonstrated highest organoid forming efficiency followed by TROP2 high cells, while TROP2 low cells failed to generate organoids (Aizarani et al., 2019) . Therefore, we investigated whether any of the epithelial clusters co-expressed ACE2, TMPRSS2, and TROP2. Notably, we observed that only the EPCAM + progenitor cluster expressed all three genes ( Figure 2E ). Next we sub-divided this cluster into TROP2 low, intermediate and high cells and investigated the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other cell fate markers. Remarkably, we observed that TROP2 high cells expressed the highest levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, followed by TROP2 Int and TROP2 low cells ( Figure 2F ). Our analysis revealed that TROP2 Int (bipotent) cells also express MUC6 and SOX9, whereas TROP2 high (cholangiocyte fate bias) cells express makers such as CFTR, CXCL8, HES1 and KRT19. Taken together, our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect TROP2 high cells via ACE2 and TMPRSS2, thereby contributing to liver dysfunction by compromising the ability of the human liver to regenerate cholangiocytes.\n\nAdditionally given the recent discussion on possible intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we also analysed human fetal liver scRNA-seq atlas at 16 and 21\n\nweek EGA. Our analysis indicated very low to negligible level of ACE2 and an absence of TMPRSS2 expression in EPCAM+ fetal liver cells ( Figure 3A -D). Our limited analysis suggest that fetal liver may not express the machinery required for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

SARS-CoV-2 can reach the liver either through the general circulation once patient has become viraemic or through transmigration through the GI tract. We surveyed human liver scRNA-seq data to understand the expression pattern of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene which are essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells. Our analysis reveals that in human liver only EPCAM + progenitors co-express genes for viral entry (ACE2) and S-protein priming (TMPRSS2). Further analyses revealed the specific expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in TROP2 high cells. These results indicate that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are specifically present in liver progenitors with a cholangiocyte fate bias, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 may be affecting cholangiocyte precursors, thereby potentially impeding the homeostasis of the cholangiocyte pool. Recent studies have reported the expression of ACE2 in cholangiocytes, however, did not reflect over the heterogeneity of ACE2 + population (Chai et al., 2020) . In this study we explored the heterogeneity of ACE2 + cells and systematically characterised ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression as hallmarks of TROP2 + epithelial progenitors.\n\nOur study reveals the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to infect TROP2 + progenitor like cells in human liver. It is important to note that TROP2 is expressed in multiple epithelial progenitors (Crowell et al., 2019; Okabe et al., 2009; Vallone et al., 2016) . In the future it will be important to survey other GI tract tissues at single-cell level for the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and their associated transcriptomes. Given the GI tract infection and multi-organ failure in COVID-19, it is important to understand whether other progenitor-like cells are also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, TROP2 expression has been associated with amplifying progenitor cells in partial hepatectomy mouse model (Okabe et al., 2009) indicating the important role of TROP2 + cells in liver regeneration. Taken together, our analysis suggests that adult human liver TROP2 + progenitors could be a prime target of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 3E ).\n\nGeneral hepatocyte cell damage from cytokine storms in ill patients with viraemia from respiratory viral infection is not uncommon.

Clinicians looking after patients with COVID-19 should be alerted to the possibility of progressive liver deterioration in patients with serious SARS-Cov-2 viraemia. This study demonstrates the power of single-cell RNA-seq to understand the pathobiology of COVID-19 and pave the way for similar studies to understand the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on different tissue and cell types.\n\n.

The samples were delivered in with MACS Tissue Storage Solution (Miltenyi, Cat#:130-100-008).\n\nThe donation of fetal liver tissues for research was approved by the Centralised trimester (16 and 21 weeks EGA) elective pregnancy terminations carried out for socio-psychological reasons. All fetuses were considered structurally normal on ultrasound examination prior to termination and by gross morphological examination following termination. In total 2 fetuses of 16 and 21 weeks EGA were used for this study.\n\nTissues were transferred immediately using the following procedure. Tissue was transferred to a sterile 10mm 2 tissue culture dish and cut into very small fragments.\n\nThe dissociation buffer consisted of 0.43mg/ml of Collagenase IV (Thermofisher, Cat#: The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.002832 doi: bioRxiv preprint with 10ml pipette followed by 18g needle. The 1% BSA PBS solution was added to the digested tissue and then the solution was passed through a 70um filter before centrifuging at 800g for 6 minutes at 4 o C. Cells were treated with 5ml of 1x RBC lysis buffer (Biolegend, Cat#: 420301) on ice for 10-15 minutes. 1% BSA PBS solution was then added and the cells were passed through 40um filter. Cells were dissolved in 1% BSA PBS solution prior to counting.\n\nSequenced fastq files are aligned, filtered, barcoded and UMI counted using Cell Ranger Chromium Single Cell RNA-seq version 2.0.2, by 10X Genomics with Cell Ranger, GRCh38 database (version 1.2.0) as the human genome reference. All 62 sectors are aggregated using cellranger aggr by normalizing all runs to the same sequencing depth.\n\nDownstream analysis was done using Scanpy, a scalable Python-based package (version 1.4) designed for single cell gene expression datasets. Scanpy implements numerous functions from preprocessing to visualization, clustering, differential gene expression, and trajectory inference analysis on Jupyter Notebooks. Parameters used in each function are manually curated to portray the best clustering of cells. In preprocessing, cells are filtered based on the criteria of expressing a minimum of 200 genes and a gene which is expressed by a minimum of 30 cells. Dying cells with a mitochondrial percentage of more than 5% are excluded. Cell count was normalized using scanpy.api.pp.normalize_per_cell with a scaling factor of 10,000 whereas gene expression was scaled to unit variance and mean value of 0 using scanpy.api.pp.scale. Dimension reduction starts with PCA using scanpy.api.tl.pca; the number of PCs used in each clustering exercise varies depending on the importance of embeddings to be included. In the interest of crisp clustering, we first calculated neighborhood graph (scanpy.api.pp.neighbors) of cells. Best matched k-Nearest Neighbor is automatically weighted by the algorithm to compute the best UMAP topology (scanpy.api.tl.umap, minimum distance between 0.3 to 0.5) which is consistently used throughout this paper. Louvain method (scanpy.api.tl.louvain) is then used to detect a community of similar cells. By default, Louvain's resolution parameter is set to the maximum value of 1.0, this in theory finds more and smaller . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

In our experiments, the value is set between 0.6 to 1. Genes are then ranked using scanpy.api.tl.rank_genes_groups (Benjamini Hochberg, t-test overestimated variance with adjusted p-value). Cell types was manually and iteratively assigned based on overlaps of literature curated and statistically ranked genes. To leverage the heterogeneity of this dataset, we used partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA, scanpy.api.tl.paga) to reconstruct lineage between cell types. This lineage trajectory provides a continuous cell type transition from the assigned discrete cell types. The thickness of the edges represents connectivity scores, an entropy-based measure provided by PAGA indicating relatedness between clusters; spurious connections are discarded while tuning thresholds.\n\n.
