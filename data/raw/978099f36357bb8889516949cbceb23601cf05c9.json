{"title": "", "body": "Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is an enveloped, RNA virus that belongs to the Lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae. It infects domestic and wild cats worldwide, as well as hyenas. 4 Like HIV, FIV establishes a chronic, persistent infection that, in some cats, ultimately culminates in immunodeficiency. Because of its similarities to HIV, FIV infection in cats has been used as a research model for HIV infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), 5 and relative to other viral infections of companion animals, much is known about its pathogenesis.\n\nKnowledge of retroviral structure and replication is required in order to understand diagnostic, treatment, and prevention strategies that target these viruses. Like other retroviruses, FIV has a three-layered structure that is composed of an innermost genome-nucleocapsid complex with helical symmetry, an icosahedral capsid, and an envelope with glycoprotein spikes ( Figure 21-1) . The FIV genome contains three major genes: gag, which encodes the virion core proteins (capsid [p24], nucleocapsid, and matrix); pol, which encodes the reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase enzymes; and env, which encodes surface (gp120) and transmembrane virion (gp41) envelope glycoproteins. Several other accessory and regulatory genes are also present. FIV invades cells via the primary receptor CD134, which is expressed on feline CD4+ T cells, B cells, and activated macrophages, 6, 7 and the secondary receptor CXCR4, which is normally a chemokine receptor. The viral envelope fuses with the cell membrane, and the capsid enters the cytoplasm, where reverse transcription occurs and a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) copy of the retroviral genome is made. Additional sequences, known as long terminal repeats (LTRs), are added to either end of the viral genome. The virus then passes into the nucleus where the dsDNA copy integrates into the host genome; at this point the integrated dsDNA becomes a provirus. Transcription of this DNA, which is controlled by the LTRs, leads to synthesis of new virion components, and virus assembly and budding occur at the cell surface ( Figure 21 -2). Depending on the cellular environment, proviral DNA may either be latent, whereby transcription does not occur, or be transcriptionally active. Latency is one mechanism by which retroviruses can evade the host immune system. Because the reverse transcriptase enzyme is prone to error, the mutation rate of retroviruses is high, and a diversity of viral variants continuously emerges from infected hosts. Integration of retroviral DNA into host cell DNA can disrupt genes that are responsible for cell growth and differentiation (proto-oncogenes). Alternatively, cellular oncogenes captured and carried by retroviruses develop mutations during retroviral replication, and are then re-inserted into host cell DNA. The end result is abnormal cell growth and differentiation, which results in tumor formation by some retroviruses.\n\nBased on sequence diversity of the env gene, there are six different subtypes of FIV, A through F. Subtypes A and B are distributed most widely, followed by subtype C 8-10 -although a recent study from the United States showed an equal distribution of subtypes A, B, and C (Table 21-1). In addition, a number of recombinant subtypes have been recognized, such as A/B, A/C, B/D, B/E, and A/B/C recombinants, and additional subtypes also likely exist. 9, 11 The heterogeneity of the virus complicates the design of molecular diagnostic tests and vaccines for FIV. Whether differences in the clinical manifestations of disease relate to infection by different subtypes requires further study. 9, 10, 31 Retroviruses survive only minutes outside the host and are very susceptible to disinfection. FIV is shed in high concentrations in saliva, and the major mode of transmission is through bites. Transplacental transmission, transmission during parturition, and through milk have been documented experimentally, but these modes appear to be uncommon in naturally infected cats, and kittens infected by this route may not sustain productive infection. 32, 33 Venereal transmission has not been demonstrated, but FIV can be recovered from semen, and experimental inoculation of FIV into the vaginas of queens results in transmission. 34, 35 Transmission also has the potential to occur through blood donation.\n\nSeropositivity to FIV (which is equivalent to infection because of viral persistence) is consistently associated with a history of bite wounds, older age, male sex, illness, and outdoor access (Table 21-2) . 12, [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] Being of mixed breed has also been a risk factor in some studies. The mean age at diagnosis is around 6 to 8 years, and 80% to 90% of cats are more than 2 years of age. Male cats are up to 4.7 times more likely to be seropositive than female cats. 40 Indoor housing decreases transmission but does not eliminate it. 42 Worldwide, the seroprevalence of FIV in domestic pet cats ranges from around 1% to 12%. 9, 40, 41 A study that included more than 18,000 North American cats estimated the overall prevalence of FeLV and FIV infections as around 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively. 5 Higher prevalences are found in feral and free-ranging cats and sick cats. In the North American study, the prevalence of FIV infection in sick, feral cats was 18.2%, whereas that in healthy indoor cats was only 0.7%. A study from France showed a seroprevalence of 21% in unowned cats, compared with 10% in owned cats. 43 In Japan, the overall seroprevalence is very high (23% in one study), and as many as one-third of male cats test positive. 12 Occasionally, co-infections with FeLV occur, and infection with one retrovirus is a risk factor for infection with the other. 36, 37 Clinical Features\n\nThe main cellular target for FIV is the CD4+ T cell. However, FIV also infects CD8+ T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, microglia, and astrocytes. The subsequent effects of the virus on the immune system are complex, incompletely understood, and seem to result in both immune suppression and immune activation.\n\nThree phases of disease have been delineated, acute (primary), subclinical, and terminal, although not all phases are recognized in many naturally infected cats. After inoculation, the virus replicates in lymphoid tissues, and high concentrations of virus are present in blood 2 weeks after infection. A peak of viremia occurs 8 to 12 weeks after infection (Figure 21-3 ). There is a decline in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood. This may be associated with transient illness, which lasts 3 to 6 months and is often unrecognized by cat owners. Some cats show lethargy, fever, anorexia, diarrhea, stomatitis, weight loss, and/or lymphadenopathy during the acute phase. Lymphadenopathy results from lymphoid hyperplasia, and can persist for weeks to months. Neutropenia can also occur, 44 possibly as a result of neutrophil apoptosis. CD4+/CD25+ T regulator (Treg) cells are infected and activated during the acute phase. These cells then inhibit the proliferation of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and cause them to undergo apoptosis. This may contribute to persistence of FIV and further immunosuppression. [45] [46] [47] Altered dendritic cell function may also occur. 48, 49 In general, impaired T cell function in acute infection is thought to result from cytokine dysregulation, immunologic anergy (failure to respond to specific antigens), and increased apoptosis. 45 Nevertheless, most cats survive this phase because of a rebound in CD8+ T cell numbers and a strong humoral immune response. An FIV virion is shown adjacent to the surface of a CD4+ T cell. Lentiviruses contain two identical strands of RNA (the viral genome) and associated enzymes, which include reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease, packaged into a core composed of the p24 capsid protein with a surrounding p17 protein matrix, all enclosed by a phospholipid membrane envelope that is derived from the host cell. Viral encoded membrane proteins (gp41 and gp120) are bound to the envelope. CD134 and CXCR4 (chemokine) receptors on the host cell surface function as the receptors for FIV.\n\nIn the subclinical (or asymptomatic) phase, CD4+ T cell numbers rebound, and the plasma virus load declines to very low levels. Cats remain subclinically infected, often for years or even for life. This is not latent infection, because virus production continues at low levels; a slow, progressive decline in CD4+ T cell numbers; reduction in the CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratio; and in some cats, hyperglobulinemia, which results from B cell hyperactivation. Some studies also describe a sustained increase in CD8+ T cell numbers. Although activated, paradoxically, T cells have a reduced ability to respond to antigenic stimulation. Altered lymphocyte expression of cell surface molecules (including CD4 and cytokine receptors, and MHC II antigens), and continued alteration of dendritic cell and neutrophil function also contribute to immunosuppression. Dysregulation of cytokine production occurs. For example, cats that are chronically infected with FIV fail to produce Il-2, Il-6, and Il-12 in response to Toxoplasma gondii infection and instead produce elevated levels of the antiinflammatory cytokine Il-10. 45, 50 There is a slow influx of immune cells into the brain, with gradual progression of central nervous system (CNS) disease. 51 The rate of progression of the subclinical phase depends on factors such as the virus strain, co-infections with other agents that activate virus transcription, and host immunity.\n\nIn some cats, these changes ultimately lead to the terminal phase, which is characterized by clinical signs of opportunistic infections, neoplastic disease, myelosuppression, and neurologic disease. This is the phase most commonly recognized in naturally infected cats (Table 21-3) . However, many infected cats never develop FIV-related clinical signs, even when CD4+ T cell counts are low, and instead die from other causes. The terminal phase of FIV infection is commonly associated with moderate to severe periodontal disease, lymphoplasmacytic stomatitis ( Figure 21-4) , gingivitis, and feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions, 52 which may result from opportunistic bacterial and viral infections. Other opportunistic infections include chronic bacterial skin and ear infections, persistent viral upper respiratory tract infections, dermatophytosis, mycobacterial infections, fungal infections such as cryptococcosis and sporotrichosis, hemoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, and/or parasitic infections such as demodecosis and severe flea burdens. With the exception of stomatitis, the relationship between many of these opportunistic infections and FIV infection is somewhat unclear, because the prevalence of many of these infections in cats with FIV infection is similar to that in cats without FIV infection. However, infections are often more severe and less responsive to treatment than the same infections in immunocompetent cats. The development of neoplasia in FIV-infected cats is thought to result primarily from immune suppression, although there is serologic evidence that cats may be infected with a gammaherpesvirus similar to Epstein-Barr virus that might be reactivated in cats infected with FIV. 53 Lymphomas are the most commonly reported FIV-associated tumor, especially B cell lymphomas, but also T cell and non-B, non-T cell lymphomas. 54 FIV-infected cats are 5 times more likely to develop lymphoma than cats not infected with FIV and are more likely to develop it an earlier age. Leukemia and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are also common tumors in cats with FIV, although the association with SCC may be confounded by outdoor exposure. Other tumors include mast cell tumors, fibrosarcomas, meningiomas, and metastatic carcinomas; some infected cats develop more than one type of neoplasia. Rarely, lymphoma may develop as a result of viral integration into the genome and disruption of proto-oncogenes. 54, 55 Immune dysregulation and increased circulating immune complexes in the terminal phase can lead to immune-mediated disorders, such as immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and uveitis. 56 Myelodysplasia develops in some cats, 57,58 which may be manifested by clinical signs of lethargy, inappetence, pallor, or evidence of bleeding tendencies such as petechial hemorrhages. . Plasma viremia then falls to very low levels and remains this way for many years (subclinical phase). Although this period is referred to here as \"clinical latency, \" the virus itself is not latent during this time, because there is ongoing production of virus and a steady decline in CD4+ T cell counts. In the terminal phase of infection, signs of immunodeficiency develop and plasma viremia increases. Some infected cats never reach this phase. Antibody production declines, and antibody tests may be negative in cats with advanced terminal-phase disease, but PCR assays are more likely to be positive.\n\nThe end result of infection by neurovirulent strains of FIV can be progressive behavioral changes such as increased aggression and cognitive disturbances, tremors, sleep disturbances, anisocoria, delayed reflexes, abnormal cranial nerve function, urinary and fecal incontinence, and seizures. Decreased nerve conduction velocities and abnormal electroencephalograms and brainstem evoked potentials have been documented. 59 The virus does not infect neurons, but neuronal cell death occurs through multiple incompletely defined mechanisms. 51 Inflammatory lesions can develop in a variety of organs in cats infected with FIV. An inflammatory myopathy has been described, 60 and terminally, severe muscle atrophy can occur. Infection is associated with gut inflammation and intestinal epithelial cell damage (also known as AIDS enteropathy), which may result in chronic diarrhea and failure to gain weight. 61 The extent to which chronic FIV infection contributes to inflammatory or degenerative changes in other organs, such as the myocardium and the kidneys, is not well understood, because the prevalence of cardiomyopathy and interstitial nephritis in geriatric cats not infected with FIV is high (see Table 21 -3).\n\nWhen transplacental transmission occurs in FIV-infected queens, only some kittens in a litter may be infected. In the first year of infection, the overall rate of such transmission is around 70%. 62 Rates of mother-to-kitten transmission are highest in queens that have a CD4+ count less than 200 cells/\u00b5L, those with signs of immunodeficiency, and those infected within the past 15 months. 63 In utero transmission can lead to arrested fetal development, abortion, stillbirth, low birth weights, and the birth of T cell deficient kittens. 62 When positive test results occur in sick cats, the role that FIV plays as a cause of the signs may be unclear, although it is reasonable to assume that FIV may be playing a role in cats with severe stomatitis, unusual infections with intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria, and lymphoma. With refinement and improved availability of test methodologies in the future, clinical assessment of CD4+ T cell counts, the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and plasma viral loads may facilitate interpretation of the relationship between disease manifestations and infection and provide prognostic information, as in human patients infected with HIV. 67 \n\nCommon abnormalities on the CBC in cats infected with FIV include mild anemia, lymphopenia, and neutropenia. Occasionally severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, monocytopenia, or leukocytosis occur. In one large European study, neutrophil counts of FIV-infected cats were lower than those of control cats, and lymphocyte counts were higher than those of control cats. 68 Leukopenia and neutropenia were more likely to be present in FIV-infected cats.\n\nThe most common and significant abnormality on the chemistry panel in cats infected with FIV is hyperproteinemia, which results from increased \u03b3-globulin concentrations and is a direct result of FIV infection (rather than the result of opportunistic infection). Total protein concentrations that ranged from 4.5 to 11 g/dL were reported in one study. 68 Other findings are variable and relate to the presence of concurrent disease, neoplasia, or opportunistic infections.\n\nUrinalysis may reveal proteinuria in cats with glomerulonephritis.\n\nCats infected with FIV can have mild prolongations in their APTT, thrombin time, and fibrinogen concentrations, although the PT and platelet function are generally normal. 69\n\nBone marrow cytologic evaluation in FIV-infected cats with cytopenias and nonregenerative anemias may show mild dysplasia (usually not as severe as in FeLV infections); erythroid hypoplasia; and/or myeloid hyperplasia despite peripheral leukopenia, sometimes with a left shift. The latter suggests ineffective hematopoiesis or maturation arrest.\n\nThe initial assay of choice for diagnosis of, and screening for, FIV infection is an ELISA assay that detects antibody to FIV. Provided there has not been a history of vaccination for FIV and the tested cat is less than 6 months of age, positive antibody test results equate with infection, because the virus establishes a lifelong, persistent infection. Point-of-care, lateral-flow ELISA assays and diagnostic laboratory-based ELISA assays are in widespread use and have rapid turnaround times and high sensitivities and specificities. 70 These assays usually detect antibodies to the FIV p24 core protein, and sometimes to the gp40 transmembrane protein. False positive test results occur rarely as a result of operator error or nonspecific reactivity against tissue culture components after vaccination. 71 used to screen healthy cats for infection, confirmation of positive results is recommended because of the low prevalence of infection in this population of cats and the higher possibility that false-positive test results may occur. Confirmation can be done using an assay from a different manufacturer or Western blotting. However, Western blotting is technically demanding, subject to interoperator variability in interpretation, and it may be less sensitive than ELISA assays when performed by some laboratories. 72 Positive ELISA assay results in the absence of FIV infection can occur in cats that have been vaccinated for FIV, or kittens less than 6 months of age that possess maternal antibody (because of infection or vaccination of the queen). No currently available serologic test, including Western immunoblotting, distinguishes between natural infection and vaccination or the presence of maternal antibody. Kittens that test positive should be retested after 6 months of age (the Advisory Bureau on Cat Diseases recommends retesting after 4 months of age). 66, 73 Nevertheless, kittens less than 6 months of age should still be tested, because the vast majority of negative kittens will be declared free of infection. Molecular testing could be considered to confirm infection in kittens that test positive at less than 6 months of age (see later discussion). Cats with a history of FIV vaccination may remain antibodypositive for more than 4 years. 66 Because infection can occur in the face of vaccination, positive test results in a vaccinated cat may represent infection and/or historical vaccination. Currently, molecular testing with PCR assays is required to identify infection in these cats, but some infected cats test PCR-negative. An ELISA assay has been developed that can distinguish naturally infected from vaccinated cats, but this assay is not commercially available. The assay was used to test blood samples from 73 uninfected, unvaccinated cats; 89 uninfected, FIV-vaccinated cats; and 102 FIV-infected cats, including 3 cats that had been vaccinated. 9 The assay had a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 100% for detection of FIV infection in these cats.\n\nFalse-negative ELISA assay results occur early in the course of illness, because cats may take up to 60 days to develop an antibody response. 66 Rarely, antibody production is delayed for 6 months or longer. Thus when recent exposure is possible, testing should be repeated a minimum of 2 months later. Falsenegative test results also occur in cats in the terminal phase of disease, as a result of impaired antibody production, or in kittens with rapidly progressive infections. These cats often have high plasma viral loads. Thus, if advanced FIV infection is suspected, negative test results should be followed by virus detection using PCR. When serology is used as a screening test, negative results are considered to be highly reliable because of the high sensitivity of the test and the low prevalence of infection in most populations of healthy cats. 66 Immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assays that detect antibodies to FIV have also been described. When performed by experience laboratory personnel, these have sensitivities and specificities that range from 95% to 100% when compared with Western immunoblotting. 71\n\nA variety of PCR assays have been developed for diagnosis of FIV infection. Assays may detect viral RNA (reverse transcriptase [RT]-PCR), proviral DNA, or both RNA and proviral DNA in peripheral blood. Because the FIV vaccine is inactivated and does not replicate or integrate into the host genome, PCR assays should not detect vaccine virus in cats that have been vaccinated for FIV. Compared with serology, PCR can be insensitive (sensitivity <80%), because viral loads in healthy cats are often extremely low, and some strains may not be detected because of variability in the sequence of the viral genome among FIV isolates. Sensitivity is likely to be higher in cats in the acute and terminal phases of disease when viral loads are higher, but this requires further study. False-positive test results have the potential to occur as a result of laboratory contamination; in some commercial laboratories, unacceptable sensitivities and specificities have been reported (as low as 41% and 44%, respectively). 74, 75 In advertising materials, IDEXX Laboratories report an assay sensitivity and specificity of 80.5% and 99.9%, respectively, among 36 FIV-infected cats, 96 uninfected vaccinated cats and 92 uninfected unvaccinated cats, with no difference in specificity in the latter two groups. 76 A FRET realtime PCR assay directed at the gag gene has been described that differentiates between FIV subtypes (see Chapter 5 for an explanation of FRET PCR assays). 11 The assay was positive in 60% of 101 cats with positive antibody tests for FIV. A history of vaccination with the FIV vaccine was present in 13 of the cats, and all these cats tested negative. The vaccination history of the remaining cats was unknown. Given their limitations, PCR assays should not be used for diagnosis of FIV infection in the absence of concurrent serologic testing, and the results of PCR assays should not be used to decide whether vaccination should be performed. Cats that are seronegative that test positive with PCR may be in the terminal phase of disease and unable to produce antibody, or the PCR assay result may be a false positive. Latently infected cats have rarely been described that test positive for proviral DNA but negative for antibody. 76 These cats lack any immunologic or clinical abnormalities that occur with active infection. 76 Whether these cats are likely to develop productive infection (as reported in humans with latent HIV infection) is unknown. 77\n\nFIV can be isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes in primary feline T cell cultures, but this is technically demanding and expensive and can take 2 to 3 weeks, so it is not used for routine diagnostic purposes.\n\nGross pathologic findings in cats with FIV infection include emaciation, stomatitis, lymphadenopathy, and evidence of secondary neoplasia or opportunistic infections. Evidence of disorders of aged cats, such as hyperthyroidism, cardiomyopathy, and interstitial nephritis, may also be present. Histopathologic changes in cats with FIV infection include follicular hyperplasia or, in the chronic phase, lymphoid depletion in the paracortical regions and plasma cell infiltration of lymph nodes (Figure 21-5) ; lymphoplasmacytic ulcerative stomatitis (see Figure 21-4, B) ; and bone marrow pathology as described previously in this chapter. Evidence of chronic interstitial nephritis, sometimes with membranous glomerulonephritis and glomerulosclerosis, may be present. Inflammatory changes may be seen within skeletal muscle and/or the gastrointestinal tract. Histopathology of the CNS in cats infected with neurovirulent FIV strains may show mild lymphoplasmacytic meningitis, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, diffuse gliosis, microglial nodules, and mild neuronal degeneration and apoptosis. 59, 78 Neuronal dysfunction may be more important than neuronal loss. 59\n\nCats in the terminal phase of FIV infection may require fluid therapy, nutritional support, regular dental prophylaxis, dilute chlorhexidine-based mouth washes or oral gels, and dental extractions and antimicrobial drugs with activity against anaerobes for severe stomatitis (Table 21-5) . Whole mouth extractions have been beneficial for some cats with severe stomatitis, but it is critical that all tooth roots be removed. Referral to a board-certified veterinary dentist should be considered. Topical glucocorticoids (e.g., 1% prednisolone acetate, every 4 to 12 hours depending on severity) and topical atropine are indicated for cats with anterior uveitis. Systemic glucocorticoids should only be used if absolutely necessary, because their use A B is associated with increased plasma viremia. Some cats with advanced neurologic signs show clinical improvement after treatment with glucocorticoids. Opportunistic infections may respond to appropriate antimicrobial treatment, but prolonged or lifelong treatment may be required. Griseofulvin should not be used to treat dermatophytosis, because it has been associated with bone marrow suppression in FIV-positive cats. 79 Recombinant human erythropoietin or darbepoetin may be useful for some cats with nonregenerative anemia and does not appear to increase viral load through activation of transcription of latent virus. 80 Although recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) can increase neutrophil counts in cats infected with FIV, antibodies can develop within a few weeks that cross-react with endogenous G-CSF. When recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was used, an increase in virus load occurred, so the use of these drugs is not recommended.\n\nTopical lactoferrin administration has been associated with clinical improvement in some FIV-infected cats with stomatitis (see Chapter 7). Cats with stomatitis or neurologic disease may benefit from oral or subcutaneous treatment with zidovudine (AZT), but AZT can cause bone marrow suppression, so the CBC must be monitored weekly for the first month and monthly thereafter. Treatment is not recommended for cats with myelosuppressive disease. 73 AZT should be discontinued if the hematocrit drops below 20%, after which anemia usually resolves in a few days. 73 AZT-resistant FIV mutants can develop as early as 6 months after the start of treatment. Fozivudine (45 mg/kg PO q12h) reduces viremia in cats with acute FIV infection and may be less likely to produce hematologic adverse effects. 81 Plerixafor (AMD3100), a selective antagonist of the CXCR4 receptor, is active against FIV in vitro. 82 When used in 40 naturally infected cats for 6 weeks in a placebo-controlled double-blind study, a decreased proviral load was reported without evidence of adverse effects, but there was no improvement in clinical or immunologic variables. 73, 83 Results of treatment with human recombinant IFN-\u03b1 have been mixed, but prolonged survival was reported in 24 FIVinfected cats after oral administration of a low dose of the drug when compared with 6 untreated control cats. 83 Clinical scores and laboratory parameters improved in some sick, naturally infected cats that were treated with recombinant feline IFN-\u03c9, despite no significant changes in viral load. 84\n\nCats that test positive for FIV should be housed indoors to prevent transmission to other cats, as well as to protect them from other infections. The latter is important even in subclinically infected cats, as other infections have the potential to activate viral transcription and accelerate disease progression. The feeding of raw foods and hunting behavior should be avoided. Cats should be neutered to reduce the chance of roaming and aggressive interactions with other cats. Minimally, FIV-positive cats should be rechecked every 6 months in order to monitor body weight, assess for periodontal disease, and discuss the need for routine laboratory testing and vaccination with core vaccines. A complete physical examination, CBC, serum biochemistry panel, and urinalysis are recommended on an annual basis. 66 At least during acute FIV infection, cats can mount an immune response to vaccines, 85, 86 but because vaccination with core vaccines may activate viral transcription, vaccination should be performed only for FIV-positive cats that are likely to be exposed to other cats. The use of inactivated vaccines is recommended, because of the potential for vaccine-induced disease in immunosuppressed cats. 73 could be considered for cats that undergo invasive surgery or dental treatments. 66, 73 Prognosis A limited number of studies have shown no significant difference in life span between FIV-infected cats and uninfected cats. 42, 87 In one study, the median survival times of these two groups after testing for FIV infection were 3.9 (39 cats) and 5.9 (22 cats) years, respectively. 87 In a larger study of more than 1000 FIV-infected cats and more than 8000 age-and sex-matched control cats, the median survival times of the two groups were 4.9 years and 6.0 years, respectively. 66 The progression and severity of disease is related to virus strain and host immunity. Infection of geriatric and neonatal cats is associated with more rapid progression and severity of disease than infection of young adult cats. 84, 88 For example, progression to terminal immunodeficiency can occur within 2 months in kittens. 89 \n\nThe FIV vaccine first became available in the United States in July 2002 (Fel-O-Vax FIV, Fort Dodge Animal Health) and is an inactivated, adjuvanted, whole-virus vaccine that contains FIV Petaluma (subtype A) and FIV Shizuoka (subtype D). The vaccine has been available in New Zealand and Australia since 2004. It is licensed for the vaccination of healthy cats that are 8 weeks of age or older as an aid in the prevention of FIV, and in experimental challenge studies, protected 60% to 80% of cats from infection. The introduction of the vaccine generated controversy, because (1) existing serologic assays cannot differentiate between natural infection and vaccination, (2) vaccination provides only partial protection from infection, and (3) PCR assay results cannot be relied upon in vaccinated cats. Although concerns exist that the vaccine may only protect against infection with strains from homologous subtypes, studies have shown moderate protection against infection with subtype B strains. 90, 91 In one study, 10 of 14 cats were protected from subtype B infection when challenged 1 year after vaccination compared with none of 5 control cats. 90 However, 13-week-old vaccinated cats were not protected from challenge with FIV subtype A strain Glasgow-8; all vaccinated and control cats were infected. 92 Because of diagnostic test interference, uncertain efficacy in the field, and the increased risk of sarcoma formation associated with adjuvanted vaccines, the FIV vaccine is considered a noncore vaccine that should only be used for cats at high risk of infection, such as outdoor cats that fight with other cats. The initial vaccine should only be given to cats that test negative with FIV ELISA assays. Cat owners should be informed that protection is incomplete and that identification of subsequent infection may be impossible in some cats with the available diagnostic tests. The initial vaccine dose is followed by two booster doses at 3-to 4-week intervals, followed by annual boosters so long as risk persists. An identification microchip should be placed that links FIV vaccination to the microchip number, so should the cat escape or be relinquished to a shelter, a positive antibody test result is not interpreted as FIV infection.\n\nTransmission of FIV is reduced when cats are housed indoors. When one positive cat is identified in a household, all other cats should be tested and no new cats should be introduced, as this may lead to conflict and increased fighting behavior. Isolation of positive cats in a household should be considered. In breeding catteries, infection can be prevented by screening all new introductions, preferably with a 2-month quarantine period for introductions followed by retesting, and removal of all infected queens and toms from the cattery. Transmission in shelters can be reduced by testing on intake or housing cats singly in cages, and testing at or shortly after adoption, together with education of adopters in regard to the need to retest for infection.\n\nSurgical needles, endotracheal tubes, breathing circuits, and instruments should never be shared between cats without proper cleaning and disinfection, and all cats used as blood donors should test negative for FIV antibodies with ELISA and, if possible, PCR assays offered by a diagnostic laboratory that has a high level of quality control. Fluid lines and multidose vials should not be shared between cats, because they can become contaminated with body fluids.\n\nDespite its similarities to HIV, no evidence of natural infection of humans with FIV exists.\n\nSignalment: \"Arthur\" an 11-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair from northern California History: Arthur was initially brought to his veterinarian for a 2-day history of lethargy and decreased appetite. Physical examination was unremarkable. Blood work showed a hematocrit of 28% (reference range, 29% to 38%), a white cell count of 6400 cells/\u00b5L with a normal differential, clumped platelets, mild hyperbilirubinemia (0.5 mg/dL), mild hypoalbuminemia (2.4 g/dL), and hyperglobulinemia (5.5 g/dL). He was treated with amoxicillin and mirtazapine, but lethargy and inappetence persisted. Serial hemograms performed over the subsequent 3 months showed progressive leukopenia due to a neutropenia and lymphopenia ( Lymph Nodes: All lymph nodes less than 1 cm in diameter.\n\nof blood and scattered clumps of hemosiderin. A mixed population of lymphocytes was admixed with variable numbers of hematopoietic precursor cells. Hematopoietic precursors were primarily granulocytic precursors, with many progranulocytes. A few erythroid precursors, including erythroblasts, were noted. Plasma cells were moderately increased in number, and both immature and mature forms were seen. Several binucleated and rare trinucleated plasma cells and scattered immature lymphocytes were noted. Vacuolated macrophages were increased in number and often contained phagocytized erythrocytes or blue-green pigment consistent with hemosiderin. Scattered mitotic figures were noted. Interpretation: Moderate plasmacytosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and histiocytic hyperplasia with erythrophagocytosis and increased iron. The large number of immature plasma cells raised the possibility of plasma cell neoplasia; however, reactive plasmacytosis could not be ruled out. Comments: The progression of FIV infection was apparent in this cat, which transitioned from a seropositive to a seronegative, PCR-positive state as a result of progressive decline in immune function and, ultimately, failure to produce antibodies. The cause of the hepatopathy was not identified. Blood cultures were negative, and spleen and liver aspiration cytology failed to reveal evidence of underlying neoplasia. Because of the plasmacytosis in the spleen, serum protein electrophoresis was performed to assist diagnosis of a plasma cell tumor (as supported by a monoclonal gammopathy), but this was not apparent. The cat was treated with clavulanic acid-amoxicillin without clinical improvement. Treatment with glucocorticoids was also offered because of the possibility of undiagnosed round cell neoplasia or immune-mediated neutropenia (in light of the myeloid hyperplasia combined with a positive antinuclear antibody test). The cat died at home 1 month later, and necropsy was not performed. "}
