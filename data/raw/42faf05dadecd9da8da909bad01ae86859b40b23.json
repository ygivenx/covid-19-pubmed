{"title": "Effects of free amino acids on cytokine secretion and proliferative activity of feline T cells in an in vitro study using the cell line MYA-1", "body": "Nutritional studies on the feline immune system remain scarce. Since in vivo measurement of immunological parameters implies considerable time and restraints in animal welfare, alternatives to animal trials are required and have also become an important objective in the European Legislation (''reduction, replacement and refinement''). Investigations with feline cell cultures may be particularly interesting as a screening method for immunological effects of dietary factors prior to the conduction of selected in vivo studies. This allows us to precisely adopt targeted measures and to reduce animal trials.\n\nCurrent research with feline cell lines has focused on infection trials, especially with viruses (Boenzli et al. 2011; Robert-Tissot et al. 2011; Alazawy et al. 2011) , or investigations with tumor cells (Shimada et al. 2006; Martin et al. 2011; Mochizuki et al. 2011) . However, cell cultures can also be used to focus on physiological immune responses, for example to assess the immunmodulatory effects of nutritional factors.\n\nSeveral dietetic factors are considered to have immunomodulating effects in humans and animals, for instance antioxidants like vitamin E, vitamin C or carotenoids (Chew 1993 (Chew , 1995 Mayne 1996; Webb and Villamor 2007) , n-3 fatty acids (Satyaraj 2011) , trace elements like copper (Percival 1998; Bonham et al. 2002; Klotz et al. 2003; Wintergerst et al. 2007) and zinc (Ibs and Rink 2003; Fraker and King 2004; Wintergerst et al. 2006) , phytogenic compounds (Ramesh et al. 2002) or pre-and probiotics (De Vrese and Schrezenmeir 2008) . In addition, recent data indicate that amino acids have a crucial role in immune responses. The modes of action include an activation of immune cells, an effect on lymphocyte proliferation, gene expression and the redox state in cells, and a regulation of the secretion of antibodies and bioactive substances such as cytokines (Li et al. 2007 ). Up to now, the relevance of amino acids on immune cells in cats has not been identified. The situation in cats could be unique, having a particular requirement for amino acids such as taurine, arginine and methionine.\n\nThe aim of the present in vitro study was to evaluate dose-dependent effects of the amino acids arginine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, glutamine, lysine, threonine and tryptophan on proliferative activity and cytokine secretion of feline T cells, using the well characterized commercial cell line MYA-1 (ATCC \u00d2 CRL-2417 TM ). T cells were chosen as important effectors of the adaptive immune system. Their functional activity can be detected both, by the production of bioactive substances (e.g. cytokines), and the proliferation rate (Sikalidis 2015) . Importantly, it has been assumed that amino acid availability can potentially affect T cell function (Li et al. 2007; Sikalidis 2015) , however, data in cats are missing.\n\nWith the exception of glutamine, all test amino acids of the present study are essential for cats (NRC 2006) , and dose-dependent effects on immune function are of physiological relevance. In addition, glutamine has been demonstrated to be an important immunomodulator (Roth 2008; Sikalidis 2015) and its effect on T cell function was also evaluated in the present study. It was hypothesized that specific amino acids can modulate the immune response of feline immune cells either by shifts in cytokine production or proliferation rate.\n\nFor the present investigation, the feline cell line MYA-1 (ATCC \u00d2 CRL-2417 TM ; LGC Standards GmbH, Wesel, Germany) was used. According to the provider, this cell line are T lymphoblasts isolated from peripheral blood of a 5 months old cat. These T lymphoblasts express the cluster of differentiation (CD) molecules feline CD3 and feline CD4 and are negative for feline CD8.\n\nThe cells were cultured in a complete growth medium (RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/L glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate; LGC Standards GmbH, Wesel, Germany; supplemented with 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Munich, Germany), 100 units/mL recombinant human IL-2 (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Munich, Germany), 10 % fetal bovine serum (Biochrom GmbH, Berlin, Germany) and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin (Biochrom GmbH, Berlin, Germany).\n\nIn order to evaluate dose-dependent effects of different amino acids on cytokine secretion and proliferative activity of the cells, a basic cell culture medium without amino acids was used (Genaxxon BioScience GmbH, Ulm, Germany). The basic cell culture medium had the same composition as the complete growth medium, but only without amino acids (Table 1) .\n\nWith the exception of one test amino acid, all other amino acids were added to the cell culture medium in the typical concentration of free amino acids present in cat blood (Heinze et al. 2009 ). We decided to use blood concentrations of amino acids as the effects of blood lymphocytes were evaluated and physiological conditions should be simulated best possible. Since the effects of eight test amino acids (arginine, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine, threonine, tryptophan, valine and lysine) and six doses of each amino acid (0 x blood concentration, 0.5 x blood concentration, 0.25 x blood concentration, 1 x blood concentration, 2 x blood concentration, 8 x blood concentration) were evaluated, 48 different cell culture media were prepared in total. This means that each cell culture medium contained all amino acids, but only the concentration of the respective test amino acid differed when compared to blood concentration (Table 2) . Cells were cultivated in these cell culture media for 2 days prior to the following measurements of cytokine secretion and for 3 days prior to the measurement of proliferative activity. Different cell culture batches were used for the cytokine measurements and measurements of the proliferative activity of the T cells as well as for the replicates. Cell density was 1.2 9 10 7 / 2 mL/treatment for cytokine measurements and 4 9 10 5 /200 lL/treatment for the measurement of the proliferative activity of the T cells.\n\nCytokine measurement T cell secretion of the cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon gamma (IFN-c), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1beta/interleukin-1F2 (IL-1b/IL-1F2) was measured using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays (all R&D Systems GmbH, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany). The tests were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For each assay, 2 wells per test amino acid concentration were considered on an ELISA plate, and cytokine secretion was measured in duplicate. Three replicates were considered for each assay, resulting in a sample size of n = 12/test amino acid concentration for each parameter.\n\nFor the measurement of the proliferative activity of the T cells, a commercial MTT test (Vybrant \u00d2 MTT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit, Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) was used. The test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with slight modification. When the cells was labeled with MTT, all but 100 lL of medium was removed from each well, and 200 lL DMSO (Carl Roth GmbH ? Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany) were added to each well, subsequently.\n\nFor each test amino acid concentration, 6 wells on a multiwell plate (Brand plates \u00d2 , Brand, Wertheim, Germany) were measured. The proliferative activity of the feline T cells was measured as optical density at a wavelength of 540 nm (OD540) (Infinite M200 Pro, Tecan, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland; software: i-control 1.7, Tecan, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland). 3 replicates were considered for the MTT assay, resulting in a sample size of n = 18/test amino acid concentration.\n\nFor statistical data analysis, SPSS 20 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used. Data were compared by one-factor analysis of variance (fixed factor: concentration of the test amino acid) and Scheff\u00e9 (variance equality) or Tamhane 2 (variance inequality) post hoc tests. As different cell culture batches were used for the replicates, data were treated as independent measures. Polynomial contrasts were calculated in order to identify linear or quadratic Except for the respective test amino acid, all other amino acids were added to this basic cell culture medium as present in cat blood (Heinze et al. 2009 ) Cytotechnology (2016 ) 68:1949 -1961 1951 effects of the test amino acid concentration in the cell culture medium on the test parameters. Data are presented in tables as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. The level of significance was a = 0.05.\n\nDose-dependent effects of specific amino acids on the cytokine secretion of feline T cells\n\nThe dose-dependent effects of arginine, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine, threonine, tryptophan, valine and lysine on the secretion of IL-4, IL-10, TNF-a, GM-CSF and IFN-c of the feline T cells are presented in Tables 3, 4 , 5, 6 and 7. T cell secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1b/IL-1F2, depending on varying concentrations of the test amino acids in the cell culture media, was low (all values were below the detection limit of 31.25 pg/mL), therefore no statistical data analysis was possible.\n\nIL-4 secretion was highest when threonine was added to the cell culture medium in a concentration that can be found in cat blood, while a reduced IL-4 secretion was observed when threonine concentration in the cell culture medium was lower or higher (quadratic effect: P \\ 0.001) ( Table 3) . Contrasting effects were observed for lysine, where the lowest IL-4 secretion was measured when lysine was added to the cell culture medium at a concentration present in cat blood or at half of the concentration in cat blood (quadratic effect: P = 0.015).\n\nThe cell culture medium without arginine led to a lower IL-4 secretion of the T cells when compared to arginine concentrations in the cell culture media which were twofold or eightfold higher than in cat blood (P \\ 0.05).\n\nOnly small group differences were observed for the IL-4 secretion of the T cells when glutamine, leucine and valine were added to the cell culture media at varying concentrations (P \\ 0.05).\n\nA linear effect of isoleucine (P = 0.039) and leucine (P = 0.008) concentrations in the cell culture media was detected for IL-10 secretion of the T cells (Table 4 ). Highest IL-10 secretion was observed when isoleucine and leucine were added to the media in concentrations which were twice as high as in cat blood, while lower IL-10 secretion was observed when isoleucine and leucine were present in the cell culture media at concentrations found in cat blood or below.\n\nA linear effect on IL-10 secretion of the T cells was also observed for lysine concentrations in the cell culture media, where an increase was detected when lysine concentration was 0 mg/L up to the eightfold blood concentration (P = 0.015).\n\nWith regard to arginine concentrations in the cell culture media, lowest IL-10 secretion was measured Only the dose of one test amino acid varied in each cell culture medium, while the other amino acids were added to the medium at blood concentration (Heinze et al. 2009 ). Therefore, 48 different cell media were prepared for the present study when arginine was added to the medium at a concentration which can be found at cat blood and in half blood concentration, while highest IL-10 secretion was measured when arginine concentration in the cell culture medium was twofold and eightfold higher than in cat blood (linear and quadratic contrasts:\n\nOnly small group differences were observed for the IL-10 secretion of the T cells when glutamine and threonine were added to the cell culture media at varying concentrations (P \\ 0.05).\n\nIL-10 secretion of the T cells was below the detection limit (125 pg/mL) for tryptophan (0 mg/L), valine (0 mg/L; blood concentration; 8 x blood concentration) and lysine (blood concentration), therefore post hoc tests were not performed.\n\nAn increase of TNF-a secretion was observed from 0 mg arginine/L up to an arginine concentration in the cell culture medium which was twice as high as in cat blood (linear contrast: P = 0.048) ( Table 5) .\n\nA quadratic effect of leucine concentrations in the cell culture media on TNF-a secretion of the T cells was detected. Highest TNF-a secretion was measured when leucine concentration was similar to blood concentration, while a reduced TNF-a secretion was observed when leucine concentrations in the media were higher or lower (P \\ 0.001).\n\nLowest TNF-a secretion was measured when threonine was added to the medium in a concentration which was half of the concentration found in cat blood, while higher TNF-a secretion was detected when threonine concentrations in the media were below or above this concentration (quadratic effect:\n\nContrary results were observed for valine, where TNF-a secretion of the T cells was highest when valine concentration was half of cat blood concentration, while a reduced TNF-a secretion was observed when valine concentrations in the media were higher or lower (quadratic effect: P = 0.038).\n\nA quadratic effect was observed for GM-CSF secretion of the T cells when glutamine was added to the cell culture media at varying concentrations, where highest GM-CSF secretion was measured when the same glutamine concentration was achieved as in cat blood (P = 0.015) ( Table 6 ). Comparable results were detected for arginine concentrations in the cell culture media (quadratic effect: P = 0.017), lysine (quadratic effect: P = 0.026) and tryptophan (quadratic contrast: P \\ 0.001). In contrast, GM-CSF secretion was lowest when threonine was added to the cell culture medium in a concentration that can be found in cat blood (quadratic effect: P = 0.004).\n\nHighest GM-CSF secretion of the T cells was measured when leucine concentration was eightfold higher than in cat blood (linear effect: P = 0.033).\n\nValine concentrations in the cell culture media also affected GM-CSF secretion of the T cells. The highest secretion was observed when valine concentration was a quarter of the blood concentration, while higher concentrations decreased GM-CSF secretion (linear and quadratic contrasts: P \\ 0.001).\n\nIFN-c secretion of the T cells was low when arginine, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine and lysine were added to the cell culture media in varying concentrations ( Table 7 ). The measured values were often below the detection limit (62.5 pg/mL), therefore post hoc tests were not performed.\n\nLowest IFN-c secretion of the T cells was observed when tryptophan was added to the medium at the concentration which can be found in cat blood, while an enhanced IFN-c secretion was measured when tryptophan was added to the media below or above blood concentration (quadratic effect: P = 0.024). Contrary results were detected for lysine, where highest IFN-c secretion of T cells was observed when lysine was added to the cell culture medium at the same concentration as lysine is present in cat blood or in half cat blood concentration (quadratic effect: P = 0.022).\n\nIFN-c secretion of T cells was highest when valine was added to the cell culture media at concentrations below cat blood concentration (linear contrast: P \\ 0.001; quadratic contrast: P = 0.034).\n\nDose-dependent effects of specific amino acids on the proliferative activity of feline T cells When arginine or tryptophan were added to the media, the highest proliferative activity of the T cells was (2016) 68:1949-1961 1957 measured when the arginine or tryptophan concentration was equivalent to blood concentration (quadratic effect: P \\ 0.001 and P = 0.035 for arginine and tryptophan, respectively) ( Table 8 ). Linear effects were observed when glutamine (P \\ 0.001), isoleucine (P = 0.021) and lysine (P = 0.001) were added to the cell culture media. The proliferative activity of the T cells was the highest when glutamine or lysine concentrations in the cell culture media increased or isoleucine concentrations decreased.\n\nThe present study was conducted in order to evaluate the effects of specific amino acids on feline T cells in vitro. To date, cell lines are predominantly used for infection trials and oncological research (Shimada et al. 2006; Alazawy et al. 2011; Boenzli et al. 2011; Martin et al. 2011; Mochizuki et al. 2011; Robert-Tissot et al. 2011 ). However, in vitro studies might also be interesting as screening method for immunonutritional effects in cats. In this study, the effects of eight different amino acids with six doses each were evaluated concerning stimulating or inhibiting effects on cytokine secretion and proliferative activity of feline T cells. The realization of a similar in vivo study would require 48 different experimental diets. Moreover, immunological responses to dietetic treatments might only be detectable when considering a sufficiently long feeding period. Thus, an in vitro study shows significant advantages to refine and reduce animal trials with regard to time and physical intervention.\n\nFeline cell lines are available to study physiological and pathological immune responses in vitro. In the present study, the commercially available T lymphoblastoid cell line MYA-1 (ATCC \u00d2 CRL-2417 TM ) was used. As an advantage, this cell line is well characterized (CD3 ? ; CD4 ? ; CD8 -), allowing the evaluation of nutritional effects on a selected immune cell population.\n\nSeveral amino acids and varying concentrations were considered for the present investigation, since amino acids have been demonstrated to play a significant role in immune function (Li et al. 2007 ). However, studies in cats remain scarce, and the results of the present in vitro study can generate new hypotheses for targeted in vivo studies.\n\nThe effects of the amino acids arginine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, glutamine, lysine, threonine and tryptophan on feline T cells were evaluated. Among these amino acids, most immunological effects were observed for arginine and lysine. High concentrations of arginine increased IL-4, IL-10 and TNF-a secretion of T cells, while highest GM-CSF secretion and proliferative activity of the cells were observed when arginine was added to the cell culture medium in a concentration which can be found in cat blood. Increasing concentrations of lysine increased IL-10 secretion and proliferative activity of the T cells, while highest GM-CSF and IFN-c, but lowest IL-4 secretion was observed when lysine concentrations in the media were similar to blood concentrations. Both IL-4 and IL-10 are mainly produced by T cells (Turner et al. 2014) . While IL-4 increases proliferative activity of cytotoxic T cells and B cells, and immunoglobulin (Ig) E and IgG production, IL-10 shows anti-inflammatory effects, decreases cytokine production and inhibits function of mononuclear cells (Turner et al. 2014 ). The observed increase in IL-10 secretion by increasing concentrations of arginine and lysine in the cell culture media may indicate beneficial effects of these amino acids in inflammatory disorders. However, differences in IL-10 levels were only small among the selected doses of arginine and lysine. The observed increase of IL-4 secretion with increasing arginine concentrations in the cell culture media was more pronounced and may have practical relevance in pathogen defense. In addition, higher concentrations of arginine also increased TNF-a secretion of the T cells. As arginine is metabolized by nitric oxide synthases (Raber et al. 2012) , an increased production of nitric acid might explain the enhanced TNF-a secretion of the feline T cells observed in the present study. Nitric acid has been demonstrated to regulate the secretion of several cytokines, including TNF (Bogdan 2001) . Since TNF-a particularly stimulates phagocytic activity of macrophages (Turner et al. 2014) , the observed effects of high doses of arginine may be interesting to strengthen immune function in disease. The results are supported by data of Rutherfurd- Markwick et al. (2013) who could demonstrate an enhanced phagocytic activity of blood leukocytes by dietary supplementation of arginine in healthy cats. In this study, 1.9 % arginine was added to a low-protein diet (22.7 % crude protein in dry matter), and fed for 5 weeks. Phagocytic activity of blood leukocytes was increased after dietary arginine supplementation when compared to feeding a low-(22.7 % crude protein) or high-protein diet (53.0 % crude protein) without additional arginine supplementation (P \\ 0.05). The results of the present study on cytokine secretion of T cells may help to explain the mechanism of the immunostimulating effect of arginine. Future studies should investigate its clinical relevance, particularly in diseased cats.\n\nConsidering the effects of lysine in the present investigation, further in vivo studies on its immunomodulating potential seem to be interesting. Dietary lysine supplementation has been recommended for cats infected with feline herpesvirus 1 for a long time, however, current data could not prove antiviral effects of lysine (Maggs et al. 2006; Rees and Lubinski 2008; Drazenovich et al. 2009; Bol and Bunnik 2015) . Stiles et al. (2002) could demonstrate some beneficial effects of dietary lysine supplementation in cats with feline herpesvirus conjunctivitis, whereas the study of Maggs et al. (2003) could not support this observation. Nevertheless, the observed increase in IL-10 secretion and proliferative activity of T cells by increasing levels of lysine in the cell culture media of the present investigation indicate an immunomodulating potential of lysine. Further studies may not focus on antiviral effects of this amino acid, but on its potential to support immune function in healthy and diseased cats.\n\nBesides arginine and lysine, tryptophan concentrations in the cell culture media also affected cytokine production and proliferative activity of the feline T cells. Interestingly, highest GM-CSF secretion and proliferative activity was observed when tryptophan was added to the medium in a concentration found in cat blood, indicating that dietary supplementation of tryptophan may not exert additional beneficial effects on immune function. On the other hand, IFN-c secretion was lowest at blood concentration of tryptophan. Since IFN-c is important for function of neutrophils and monocytes, expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules and can also have anti-viral effects (Turner et al. 2014) , dietary tryptophan supplementation may be interesting in specific diseases. Based on the present results, further investigations on the effects of tryptophan are necessary to proof its clinical relevance for immune modulation in cats.\n\nInteresting results were observed for increasing concentrations of leucine in the cell culture media, as GM-CSF and IL-10 secretion of the feline T cells was increased. GM-CSF can stimulate production of eosinophils, granulocytes and monocytes (Turner et al. 2014) , which might be relevant in infectious diseases. Concentrations of threonine in the cell culture media greater than blood concentration also increased GM-CSF and additionally TNF-a secretion of the T cells.\n\nGM-CSF and IFN-c secretion of the feline T cells were higher when valine concentrations in the cell culture media were below blood concentration. These results are in contrast to studies in humans and rodents demonstrating that deprivation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) depressed and supplementation of BCAA enhanced immune function (Li et al. 2007 ). The reason for these contradicting results remains unclear and require further investigations.\n\nThe effects of glutamine and isoleucine on T cell function were small and did not indicate beneficial effects for dietary supplementation in vivo.\n\nIn conclusion, the present study demonstrated that in vitro evaluation of feline T cell function can be used as an interesting screening method for targeted in vivo studies in immunonutrition. Varying concentrations of specific amino acids affected cytokine secretion and proliferative activity of feline T cells. In particular, the clinical relevance of the observed immunostimulating effects of high doses of arginine, lysine, leucine and threonine should be evaluated in future studies."}
