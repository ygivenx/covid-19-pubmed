{"title": "Sequential Emergence and Wide Spread of Neutralization Escape Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Mutants, South Korea, 2015 Appendix Materials and Methods Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Culture and Plaque Assay", "body": "spike gene (Sino Biological; https://www.sinobiological.com) was cloned into pcDNA3 after deleting an ER/Golgi retention motif and an endosomal recycling motif from the cytoplasmic tail (2) for transfection instead of pLP/VSV-G. A plasmid carrying the gene encoding the I529T or D510G mutation in spike protein was generated by using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene; http://go.strategene.org/genetic-analysis) based on the wild-type construct, and the point mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Viral supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection and normalized by p24 ELISA kit (Clontech) before infecting 293T cells expressing human CD26 (293T-CD26) (1) .\n\nTo assess the neutralizing activity by spike pseudoparticle neutralization assay (3), pseudoviruses (0.1 multiplicity of infection) were preincubated with serially diluted serum samples from mice immunized three times with wild-type spike antigen (Sino Biologic Inc.) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. Subsequently, the infected 293T-CD26 cells were lysed 48 h after infection, and the efficiency of viral entry was measured by comparing luciferase activity. The relative luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega; https://www.promega.com) and Infinite 200 PRO microplate reader (Tecan; https://lifesciences.tecan.com). Neutralization titers of collected serum samples against MERS-CoV were also determined by a plaque reduction neutralization titer assay. Each serum sample collected from convalescent-phase patient was serially diluted and incubated with wild-type MERS-CoV or I529T mutant MERS-CoV (0.004 multiplicity of infection) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. The viruses were then added to a 24-well plate containing a monolayer of Vero E6 cells in duplicate.\n\nAfter 1 h incubation at 37\u00b0C, viral supernatant was removed and cells were overlaid with 1 mL of 1% methylcellulose in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium including 10% fetal bovine serum. Viral plaques were visualized as described above. The percentage of plaque reduction was calculated as [(no. of plaques without antibody) -(no. of plaques with antibody)] / (no. of plaques without antibody) x 100. The 50% pseudoparticle neutralization assay nd 50% plaque reduction neutralization titers were calculated by a nonlinear regression analysis (log [inhibitor] versus normalized response method) embedded in GraphPad Prism Software v5.01 (GraphPad Software; https://www.graphpad.com).\n\nData were analyzed using GraphPad Prism Software. Statistical analysis was performed using a 2-tailed Student t-test or one-way analysis of variance, followed by the Newman-Keuls (4) . \u2021Spike sequences with mixed genotypes including wild type or indicated mutants were labeled as yellow-background or single genotype as graybackground in samples of targeted deep sequencing. Dominant amino acid sequences, occupying more than 50% in targeted deep sequencing were indicated.\n\nPage 6 of 7 \n\n2015 Jun 10 KT868870. 1  --------+  -----42  2015 May 30  KT182957.1  ----+  -+  -+  -----50  2015 Jun 11  KX034094.1  ---+  ----+  -----54  2015 Jun 9  KT868871.1  ----+  ---+  ---W/# \u2020  -66  2015 Jul 4  KX034095.1  ---+  ----+  -----77  2015 Jun 17  KX034096.1  ----+  ---+  -----80  2015 Jun 17  KX034097.1  -+  -+  ----+  -----82  2015 Jun 10  KT868872.1  ----+  --+  +  -----85  2015 Jun 10  KT868873.1  ----+  ---+  -----110  2015 Jun 11  KT868874.1  ----+  ---+  -----122  2015 Jun 10  KT868875.1  ---+  ----+  -----148  2015 Jun 11  KT868876.1  ----+  --+  +  -----162 2015 "}
