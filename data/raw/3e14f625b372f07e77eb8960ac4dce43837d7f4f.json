{"title": "", "body": "In ba k'ira, me ya ci gawai? This is a well-known question in the Hausa language in West Africa with allusion to blacksmithing: \"If nothing has been forged, then what happened to the charcoal?\" 1 This month, at the Mexico Summit of Ministers of Health, WHO will launch the World report on knowledge for better health, subtitled Strengthening health systems. 2 The report conveys the following eight key messages in 160 pages:\n\nq Health research has achieved much, but less than expected q Global health is characterised by persistent inequities q Links between health systems and health research are weak q Inequities in health need immediate attention q Health research should be ethical q Health research should build on existing knowledge and target global priority issues q Health research should be more accessible to decision makers q There should be more research on health systems While we doubt that anybody will disagree with these messages, we question the need for 160 pages to express the obvious.\n\nThe report warns against complacency, against the whiggish view that things can only get better; that older customary traditional practices must always give way to the new, modern, and progressive. Yet the report's language is far from a call to arms. Its buzzword slogans about \"more research for better health\" trade in mood rather than critical thinking. Colourful but indistinct, the use of \"mood\" is a way of engineering consent, of selling ideas; a method of getting the audience to feel rather than understand. Furthermore, \"mood\" is powerfully addictive; those who trade in the word find it irresistible that you never need to define what you mean. We believe that making health policy and systems more evidence-based requires more than mood.\n\nIts slow pace and repetitious prose lend the report a somniferous quality. Mercifully, we were kept awake by the inserted case-study text-boxes. We learned how Hong Kong used the police department's information system to control severe acute respiratory syndrome, how the Tanzania Essential Health Intervention Project influenced resource allocation at district level, how WHO's Health InterNetwork Access to Research Information initiative bridges the digital divide, how the Meningitis Vaccine Project aims to transfer technology to developing countries, and much more. Casestudy boxes are normally used to fill space. In this report, they are apposite and fascinating, bringing application of health research to life. Unfortunately, the report does not offer a convincing discussion on how these practical examples of links between research and health-systems develop-ment could be scaled up. The question remains: what happened to the charcoal?\n\nLet us pick one theme of the report: the impact of disease-specific or intervention-specific programmes on health systems. Over 25 years ago, the International Conference on Primary Health Care in Alma Ata recommended that \"single-purpose programmes should be integrated into primary health care activities as quickly and smoothly as possible.\" 3 This did not happen, of course, and the discussion of vertical versus horizontal programming has never stopped. 10 years ago, the World Bank published a ground-breaking but under-promoted book entitled Better health in Africa. 4 Couched in diplomatic language, the book summarised the significant shortcomings of vertical immunisation, nutrition, and diarrhoea-control programmes in several African countries.\n\nDespite the massive opportunity costs and disappointing long-term impact of vertical programmes, WHO, driven by political expediency and financial opportunism, continues to conceive, promote, and invest in ever-bigger diseasespecific initiatives. 5 World report on knowledge for better health 1 tells us of \"the need for broader, more comprehensive systems that are able to deal with the challenges of providing continuous care\" (p 44). It is now a \"major priority [to conduct] research on how to better integrate single-disease programmes within the broader health system\" (p 54). The chutzpah of this recommendation is astonishing. Why should we burden researchers in developing countries with finding ways to integrate vertical programmes, when we have 25 years of documented evidence about the devastating effect of these programmes on national health systems? No level of evidence appears to have cured the addiction of international agencies to silver bullets-just keep bringing the charcoal.\n\nIn a recent commentary on British alcohol legislation, 6 Michael Marmot noted that it is easy to write evidencebased policy: \"Review the scientific evidence of what would make a difference, formulate policies, and implement them.\" However, he continues, \"scientific findings do not www.thelancet.com Vol 364 November 13, 2004 fall on blank minds that get made up as a result. Science engages with busy minds that have strong views about how things are and ought to be . . . People's willingness to take action influences their view of the evidence, rather than evidence influencing their willingness to take action\". Health ministers are no exception. The triangle that moves a mountain is a compelling conceptualisation from Thailand on how policy is formulated (figure). 7 Its corners, in addition to creation of relevant knowledge, are social movement and political involvement. Of course, few triangles are equilaterally sided, and the weight of science in this model remains questionable.\n\nThe objective of the the World report on knowledge for better health 1 was not to move a mountain, merely reach a summit of Ministers of Health. We do not doubt that this action is essential, yet the report is missing some of the operational elements of the triangle. Let us put more charcoal on the fire and forge something better.\n\nwww.thelancet.com Vol 364 November 13, 2004\n\nOver the past 30 years, about 200 observational studies and 16 randomised trials have investigated the hypotheses that allogeneic blood transfusion increases the recurrence rate of resected cancer, the incidence of postoperative bacterial infections, and the risk of various other postoperative complications, including multiple-organ failure. 1 In 1998, van de Watering and colleagues 2 reported an association between allogeneic blood transfusions containing white blood cells and increased mortality in open-heart surgery.\n\nThe researchers compared patients transfused with unmodified red blood cells with patients transfused with red blood cells from which more than 99\u00b79% of white blood cells had been removed. In an effort to explain the origin of the association between transfusion and mortality, van de Watering and colleagues did two subsequent randomised trials, 3, 4 in which they investigated the hypothesis that allogeneic blood transfusions containing white cells could predispose patients to multiple-organ failure, which might in turn increase mortality. However, they could not show such an association in either trial. All previous studies of these adverse effects of allogeneic transfusion noted the effects of transfusion of red blood cells, and raised the possibility that transfusion of other blood components might have similar effects. Recently, Bruce Spiess and colleagues 5 focused on the effects of platelet transfusion in a re-analysis of patients who had coronary-artery-bypass grafting. The researchers reanalysed data from six randomised trials, done between 1990 and 1995, in which patients were allocated randomly to receive aprotinin or control. These trials were not designed to investigate the adverse effects of platelet transfusion, and the enrolled patients were not allocated randomly to receive platelet transfusion or control. In the re-analysis, the investigators found an association between platelet transfusion and adverse outcomes that included postoperative infection, stroke, and death. The frequency of such adverse outcomes was calculated for patients who had received platelets and for those who had not. Patients receiving (and, to a lesser extent, patients not receiving) platelets had often received red blood cells or plasma, or both, as well.\n\nSpiess and colleagues 5 noted that platelet recipients were sicker and thus more likely to experience adverse outcomes than patients who did not need platelets after coronaryartery-bypass grafting. For example, platelet recipients had longer hospital stays, longer operating time, more bleeding, and more frequent re-operation for bleeding. The investigators used multivariate statistical analysis to control for the effects of confounding factors associated with both platelet transfusion and the targeted outcomes. They acknowledged, however, that no observational study can completely adjust for the effects of all confounders, because not all confounders of a particular association are known or can be measured. 1 Spiess and co-workers' ability to adjust for the effects of confounders was further compromised because they could only enter variables into statistical models if data for those variables had been collected in previous randomised trials. Finally, they built their statistical models by the stepwise method, which does not ensure adjustment for the effects of all measured confounders. 1 For these reasons, Spiess and colleagues 5 appropriately concluded that platelet transfusion might have been a surrogate marker for illness severity. Alternatively, platelet transfusion could cause the adverse outcomes, and this *Josef Decosas, Simon Heap"}
