{"title": "", "body": "October to December ( Table 1) . The detailed information about the CDV positive dogs was shown in Supplemental Table 1 .\n\nThe CDV-positive rate in feces of diarrhoetic dogs has been reported to be 8.7% (9/104), 1.4% (110/7,829), 2.3% (12/526), 1.6% (46/2,855), 2.5% (7/674), 1.0% (5/486) in Brazil, the U.S.A., Australia, Canada, the U.K. and Japan by using real-time PCR [9] . The CDV-positive rate identified in our study was significantly higher than that of other countries. CPV-2, CCoV, CaKV and CBoV had been reported to be associated with severe enteritis in puppies [4, 5] . In our previous studies, the positivity rates of CPV-2, CCoV, CaKV and CBoV had been revealed to be 47.26% (95/201), 28.36% (57/201), 17.91% (36/201) and 7.46% (15/201), respectively, within the same 201 samples investigated in the current study [7, 11, 13, 16] . The CDV-positive rate (24.88%) within these samples is nearly equal to CCoV's positivity rate. These data demonstrate that there is a very high prevalence of CDV in diarrhoetic dogs in northeastern China, making it one of main enteric pathogens in this region. The detailed information of the reference strains as follows: To investigate the co-infection of CDV with other pathogens, the 50 CDV-positive samples were subjected to detection of canine enteric viruses and bacteria. For viruses, canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2), canine kobuvirus (CaKV), canine coronavirus (CCoV), and canine bocavirus (CBoV) were detected by either PCR or RT-PCR according to previously described protocols or reports [7, 10, 11, 16] . For bacteria, the main bacterial pathogens were detected by using the multiplex PCR panels described by [14] . The detailed information about co-infections of the CDV-positive dogs in northeast China was shown in Supplemental Table 1 .\n\nIn our study, 94% (47/50) of CDV-positive samples exhibited co-infection with at least one enteric pathogen ( Table 1 ). The co-infections of CDV with CPV-2, CCoV, CaKV, and CBoV accounted for 82% (41/50), in which 30% were positive for CPV-2, 14% were positive for CCoV, 6% were positive for CaKV, 2% were positive for CBoV, 8% were positive for CPV-2 and CCoV, 8% were positive for CaKV and CCoV and 10% were positive for CPV-2, CCoV and CaKV (Table 1) .\n\nCo-infections between CDV and enteric bacteria were observed in 72% of the cases (36/50) ( Table 1) . Of the co-infections, 38%\n\nwere positive for diarrheagenic E. coli (EIEC/EPEC/EHEC/typical EPEC), 32% were positive for V. cholerae, 18% were positive for Shigella spp., 12% were positive for Campylobacter spp., 2% were positive for S. enterica, 8% were positive for diarrheagenic E. coli and Shigella spp., 6% were positive for diarrheagenic E. coli and V. cholerae, 4% were positive for diarrheagenic E. coli, V. cholerae and Shigella spp., 4% were positive for diarrheagenic E. coli, V. cholerae and Campylobacter spp., 2% were positive for diarrheagenic E. coli, Shigella spp. and Campylobacter spp. (Table 1) . Mixed infections of canine enteric viruses and bacteria frequently occur in diarrheic dogs. Gizzi et al. (2014) reported that 68.3% were positive for at least one pathogen in 104 fecal samples of the diarrheic dogs; single infection and co-infection rates were 54.9 and 45.1%, respectively; 65.6% of the animals (21/32) had dual infections, 15.6% of the animals (5/32) had triple infections, and 18.8% of the animals (6/32) had quadruple infections [8] . In our study, the co-infection of CDV with least one other enteric pathogen was revealed to be 94%, of which 82% of co-infections had at least one enteric virus and 72% with at least one enteric bacteria. The most common single co-infection of CDV was with CPV-2 virus (30%), or with diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (38%). The co-infection of CDV with CPV-2, CaKV and CCoV reached 10%. The high co-infection rates of CDV positive samples with multiple pathogens are responsible for the high incidence of diarrhea in dogs. However, the effect of multiple pathogens on the disease outcomes remains unclear. Therefore, we suggest that further studies need to better explain the relationship between the high co-infection rates and the severity of clinical symptoms.\n\nTo trace evolution of the CDV strains identified in our study, we attempted to perform the sequencing of the complete H gene of the 50 identified CDV strains according to the protocol described by Budaszewski Rda et al. [3] . The first round of amplification was conducted by using primer pair RH3-F and RH4-R, and the nested PCR was performed by using inner primer pairs H1F/H1R, H2F/H2RB, CDVF10B/CDVR10 and H3FB/H3R generating overlapping fragments of 789, 700, 870 and 542 bp, respectively. The amplified PCR products for the complete H genes were directly subjected to Sanger sequencing. Sequence analysis was carried out by using the EditSeq program in the Lasergene DNASTAR\u2122 version 5.06 software). All nucleotide sequences generated in our study were submitted to GenBank. Furthermore, phylogenetic tree of the complete H genes was generated from the ClustalXgenerated alignments by MEGA6.06 software using the neighbor-joining method [15] . Result indicated that a total of six complete H genes were successfully amplified and sequenced in our study. The sequence comparison revealed that the six complete H genes showed nucleotide homologies of 96.7-99% and amino acids homologies of 96.1-99% (Table 1 ). The six complete H genes identified in our study exhibited a high nucleotide similarity (97.5-97.9%) with the CDV Asia 1 reference strain (Table 1) . Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis revealed that the six CDV strains were divided into the CDV Asia 1 group, forming three clades (Fig. 1) . At present, CDV strains include ten distinct lineages known as America-1, America-2, Arctic-like, Rockborn-like, Asia-1, Asia-2, Africa-1, European Wildlife, Europe/South America-1 and South America-2 [6] . In our study, only CDV Asia-1 strains were identified, which is in line with most reports from China [2, 12] . Although the type Asia-1 is the most predominant CDV group in China, the CDV Asia-1 strains identified in our study also exhibited genetic diversity (Fig. 1) . The genetic diversity of CDV Asia-1 strains may be attributed to the long-term immune pressure which induces the adaptive mutation of CDV strains to varying degrees.\n\nOur results reveal genetic diversity, complex co-infection and high prevalence of CDV Asia-1 strains in diarrhoetic dogs in northeastern China. Our findings suggest that CDV infection plays an important role in the onset diarrhea in dogs in northeastern China. These data increase understanding of the CDV Asia-1 strains as diarrhea-causing agents, and provide valuable etiological information of diarrhea in dog populations. However, further studies are needed to clarify the effect of the highly prevalent coinfections reported in this study on the severity of the clinical symptoms of the diarrhoetic dogs."}
