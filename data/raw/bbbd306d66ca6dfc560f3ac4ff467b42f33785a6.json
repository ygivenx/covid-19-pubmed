{"title": "Enhancing the Antiviral Efficacy of RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Inhibition by Combination with Modulators of Pyrimidine Metabolism", "body": "Significant progress in the development of antiviral drugs has come by targeting viral proteins with small molecules (Jordheim et al., 2013; Lou et al., 2014) . For examples, compounds like aciclovir and zidovudine block viral reverse transcriptase to treat herpes simplex virus and HIV infections, respectively, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors like dasabuvir and sofosbuvir are used to treat hepatitis C virus infections (Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., 2018) . More recently, the broadspectrum RdRp inhibitor remdesivir (Gordon et al., 2020) has entered clinical trials for coronavirus disease 2019 . Meanwhile, targeting host proteins required for viral propagation is emerging as an attractive alternative that may circumvent the emergence of resistance (Bekerman and Einav, 2015) . For example, maraviroc inhibits the human chemokine receptor CCR5, and is therefore used to treat multidrug-resistant HIV (Lieberman-Blum et al., 2008) . Additionally, pyrimidine biosynthesis has emerged as a potential host-targeting strategy for antivirals (Okesli et al., 2017) . Here, we focus on devising a host-targeting antiviral approach for the treatment of RNA viruses, which cause many serious diseases such as hepatitis, influenza, Ebola, dengue, and Covid-19.\n\nIn mammalian cells, pyrimidine biosynthesis is a tightly regulated metabolic process. Two complementary pathways -de novo biosynthesis and pyrimidine salvage -are responsible for producing UTP and CTP for host as well as viral RNA synthesis (Figure 1 ). De novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is a resource-intensive process. In contrast, salvage occurs via phosphorylation of UMP and CMP derived from intracellular RNA degradation or via facilitated transport and phosphorylation of extracellular uridine, whose plasma concentration is tightly controlled in the low micromolar range (Traut, 1994) . Recently we discovered that GSK983, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent first reported in 2009 (Harvey et al., 2009) , is a potent inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a ratelimiting step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis (Deans et al., 2016) . In the course of those unbiased genome-wide studies, we also found that knockdown of uridine/cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2) and cytidine monophosphate kinase 1 (CMPK1) in the pyrimidine salvage pathway strongly sensitized cells to growth inhibition by GSK983 (Deans et al., 2016) . This finding was consistent with the observation that GSK983 often lacks antiviral efficacy in vivo despite high potency in vitro presumably due to salvage metabolism of circulating uridine by virus-infected cells (Traut, 1994; Wang et al., 2011) .\n\nTo restore the antiviral efficacy of GSK983 in the presence of extracellular uridine, we therefore sought to inhibit pyrimidine salvage. Cyclopentenyl uridine (CPU) is a carbocyclic analogue of uridine that has been shown to inhibit human UCK2 (Lim et al., 1984) . To our surprise, we learned that the antiviral activity of CPU is due to its remarkable ability to deplete intracellular pyrimidine nucleotide pools via salvage biosynthesis pathways. Our findings led us to redirect our search for a fundamentally new type of combination chemotherapy for RNA viruses, as described below.\n\nsynthesis. GSK983 is a DHODH inhibitor. Genes that sensitize cells to GSK983 are highlighted in yellow boxes. Reactions shown with blue arrows comprise the de novo biosynthetic pathway, whereas those with red arrows comprise the salvage pathway.\n\nOur search for lead inhibitors of pyrimidine salvage was inspired by earlier reports on the biological activity of CPU and cyclopentenyl cytosine (CPC), which were shown to block uridine salvage in vitro and in vivo (Cysyk et al., 1995; Lim et al., 1984; Moyer et al., 1985; Schimmel et al., 2007) . In these and other reports, CPU was found to be remarkably well-tolerated, whereas CPC was considerably more cytotoxic (Blaney et al., 1992; Ford et al., 1991; Song et al., 2001) . This contrast is likely due to downstream inhibition of the CTP synthetase by CPC (Schimmel et al., 2007) .\n\nDue to the high toxicity of CPC, we undertook structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis of CPU wherein uracil nucleobase was maintained intact or only modified at the C5 position. Meanwhile, the C-5' substituent of CPU was modified, because this is the site of UCK2-catalyzed phosphorylation. In order to rapidly access both nucleobase and carbocyclic moiety analogs, we implemented a diversity-oriented synthetic approach featuring a Mitsunobu reaction as the strategic transformation (Choi et al., 2012) .\n\nWe first synthesized CPU analogs with nucleobase modifications (Figure 2A ). Mitsunobu reactions between the common cyclopentenyl moiety (1) (Choi et al., 2004) and the benzoyl protected uracil, C(5)-fluoro-uracil, C(5)-iodo-uracil or thymine (2a-2d) (Racine et al., 2014) furnished the carbon skeleton of C-5 analogs. Removal of acetal, benzoyl and TBDPS groups then delivered analogs 4a-4d.\n\nNext, we turned to synthesis of CPU analogs modified at the C5' position of the cyclopentenyl moiety ( Figure 2B ). Selective deprotection of TBDPS with TBAF revealed the primary hydroxyl group (Song et al., 2001) , which was then methylated in the presence of Ag2O (Cosme G. Francisco et al., 2001) to afford the protected 5'-methoxy-CPU. Alternatively, the alcohol could be converted to a terminal fluoride with diethylamino sulfurotrifluoride (DAST) , resulting in protected 5'-fluoro CPU. Mesylation or acetylation of 5, followed by NaN3 substitution (Schaudt and Blechert, 2003) or Pd(OH)2/C catalyzed hydrogenation (Bianco et al., 1989) afforded the protected 5'-azido-and 5'deoxy-CPU, respectively. The resulting protected intermediates were treated with methanolic ammonia and/or HCl to provide analogs 6,7, 9 and 11.

TBDPS=tert-Butyldiphenyl silyl; Bz=Benzoyl; TBAF=Tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride, DAST=Diethylaminosulfur trifluoride, Ms= Methanesulfonyl, Ac=acetyl.\n\nIn order to guide our SAR studies, we developed an enzymatic assay to evaluate the inhibitory effect of each CPU analog against recombinant human UCK2, which was expressed and purified in E. coli. A continuous assay system was optimized by coupling UCK2 activity to the pyruvate kinase (PK) reaction, which in turn was coupled to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Tomoike et al., 2017) . Overall reaction progress was continuously monitored by detecting the UV absorption change at 340 nm, which was correlated with the ATP consumption by UCK2.\n\nThe effect of 250 \u00b5M of each CPU analog on UCK2 activity was evaluated in the presence of 50 \u00b5M uridine. CPU and 5-F-CPU showed much higher ATP consumption compared to other analogs ( Figure 3A ), suggesting these two compounds were substrates of UCK2. We then individually measured the steady state kinetic parameters of UCK2 using uridine, CPU and 5-F-CPU as substrates. Their KM values were 86, 25, and 41 \u00b5M, and their kcat / KM values were 2.6\u00b410 5 , 1.5\u00b410 5 , and 7.3\u00b410 4 s -1 \u00d7M -1 ( Figure 3B ). As predicted by the relative magnitude of these kinetic parameters, addition of CPU or 5-F-CPU to an assay mixture containing UCK2, uridine and ATP resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the rate of UMP synthesis ( Figure 3C ).\n\nWhile CPU and 5-F-CPU were the only UCK2 substrates identified from our panel of carbocyclic nucleoside analogs, some of the other agents had measurable inhibitory activity against this enzyme ( Figure 3D ). The Ki values of the two most potent competitive inhibitors, 5'-F-CPU and 5'-deoxy-CPU, were 170 \u00b5M and 230 \u00b5M, respectively ( Figures 3E and 3F ).\n\nGiven that CPU and 5-F-CPU could be phosphorylated by UCK2, we sought to establish whether the corresponding monophosphates were substrates of human CMPK1. For this purpose, human CMPK1 was expressed in E. coli and purified. We then employed recombinant UCK2 to synthesize CMP, CPU-MP and 5-F-CPU-MP and confirmed their identities by LC-MS/MS ( Figure S1 ). The results shown in Figure 3G demonstrate that both CPU-MP and 5-F-CPU-MP are substrates of CMPK1, but that the former is a better substrate. Identities of their corresponding products, CPU-DP and 5-F-CPU-DP, were also confirmed by LC-MS/MS ( Figure S2 ).\n\nTo understand the metabolic implications of the above biochemical findings, we developed a LC-MS/MS based assay that facilitated measurement of the effects of CPU,5-F-CPU and 5'-F-CPU on intracellular pyrimidine nucleotide levels. To minimize the perturbative effects of sample quenching and analysis on the physiological concentrations of these metabolites, we adapted an earlier protocol for growing cells on glass cover slips to facilitate rapid washing ( Figure S3 ) (Martano et al., 2014) . LC-MS of nucleotides (Table S1 for MS/MS transitions of selected precursors) was performed using a dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM) method (Sartain et al, 2016) . Addition of micromolar concentrations of medronic acid into the mobile phase markedly increased the sensitivity for detecting di-and tri-nucleotides by this method (Hsiao et al., 2018) . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 With optimized sampling and analysis method in hand, pyrimidine nucleotide levels were measured in cells cultured with either CPU, 5-F-CPU or 5'-F-CPU in combination with 1 \u00b5M GSK983 and 5 \u00b5M uridine for 6 h ( Figure 4A ). Inclusion of CPU or 5-F-CPU led to large decreases in UTP and CTP levels compared to cells treated with GSK983 alone; these effects grew more pronounced at 12 h ( Figure S4 ).\n\nCPU depleted UTP and CTP concentrations more strongly than 5-F-CPU. Triphosphates of both CPU and 5-F-CPU could be detected by LC-MS ( Figure 4B ), suggesting that nucleoside diphosphate kinase, a mammalian enzyme known to have broad substrate scope (Lascu and Gonin, 2000) , could convert CPU-DP and 5-F-CPU-DP into their corresponding nucleoside triphosphate analogs. Inclusion of CPU or 5-F-CPU also led to moderate decreases in UMP, CMP, UDP, and CDP levels compared to cells treated with GSK983 alone at both 6 h and 12 h ( Figure S4 ).\n\nDespite its UCK2 inhibitory activity in vitro, 5'-F-CPU did not deplete intracellular nucleotide levels and even appeared to increase levels of some intracellular nucleotides ( Figure 4A and Figure S4 ). This contrast suggests that the activity of CPU and 5-F-CPU is derived primarily from their flux through pyrimidine metabolism pathways and not from their inhibition of UCK2. In all assays, the culture medium was supplemented with 5 \u00b5M uridine and 1 \u00b5M GSK983. Error bars represent \u00b1 S.D. of three biological replicates with statistical comparisons to the untreated control provided for UTP levels (blue) and CTP levels (red) as not significant (n.s), * (p <0.05), ** (p < 0.01), *** (p < 0.001) and **** (p < 0.0001) as calculated by one way ANOVA, Dunnett's test. (B) LC-MS detection of mono-, di-and triphosphates of CPU and 5-F-CPU in cells.\n\nFrom above enzymological and metabolic data, we hypothesized that the combination of CPU and GSK983 would be more effective at inhibiting dengue virus replication than any other combination. Using an infectious clone of dengue serotype 2 (DENV-2) strain 16681 engineered to express a luciferase reporter (Deans et al., 2016; Hierholzer and Killington, 1996; Marceau et al., 2016) , the efficacy and cytotoxicity of each combination treatment was tested in infected or uninfected cultures of the A549 lung carcinoma cell line ( Figure 5A ). In all assays, culture medium was supplemented with 20 \u00b5M uridine to mimic physiological plasma concentrations. In the presence of 20 \u00b5M exogenous uridine, 1 \u00b5M of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor GSK983 alone did not significantly inhibit viral infection or cellular viability ( Figure 5A ). In line with our original hypothesis, combination of GSK983 with either 500 \u00b5M CPU and 5-F-CPU caused significant reductions in viral infection unlike the other cyclopentenyl compounds tested ( Figure 5A ). However, only CPU appeared to have a workable therapeutic index at this concentration and time point. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 To further examine the efficacy and cytotoxicity of CPU, we conducted a more comprehensive checkerboard analysis of the CPU-GSK983 combination. While neither GSK983 nor CPU were effective as single agents in physiological uridine levels, the combination of both molecules successfully suppressed dengue virus infection ( Figure 5B ). For example, combining 0.2 \u00b5M GSK983 and 250 \u00b5M CPU inhibited ~ 50% of virus replication ( Figure 5B ). At a CPU dose of 1 mM, virus replication was suppressed almost completely. Notably, the combination treatment had much less effect on A549 cell growth, suggesting that combinations of GSK983 and CPU could be selective for inhibition of virus but not host replication.\n\nTo further demonstrate that intracellular nucleotide depletion is correlated with antiviral activity, we also tested the effects of combining GSK983 with a broad inhibitor of nucleoside transport, dipyridamole (DPY). This drug significantly suppressed intracellular nucleotide levels ( Figure S4 ) and consequently inhibited viral replication ( Figure S5 ).\n\nGiven that the CPU-GSK983 combination was able to selectively inhibit viral infection through modulation of intracellular nucleotide pools, we hypothesized that the combination should potentiate the effects of an RdRp inhibitor on viral genome replication. Among RdRp inhibitors, the nucleoside inhibitor (NI) class is the largest (Klumpp et al., 2006) and has progressed the furthest in studies against dengue virus (Lim et al., 2015) . Many NIs are nucleoside analogs that rely on intracellular phosphorylation to form triphosphate substrates that block RdRp (Sofia et al., 2012) . For example, the cytidine analogue 4'-azidocytidine (R1479) and its prodrug balapiravir (R1626) have been assessed for treating HCV, and later dengue virus infections (Chen et al., 2014; Klumpp et al., 2006) . However, balapiravir failed in clinical trials against dengue due to limited efficacy (Nguyen et al., 2013) .\n\nTo test whether a combination therapy approach could improve the efficacy of R1479, we treated cells with R1479 in combination with GSK983 and CPU. As expected, R1479 showed dosedependent inhibition of dengue virus replication with an EC50 ~32 \u00b5M ( Figure S6A ). Inhibition of either de novo or salvage pyrimidine biosynthesis alone did not potentiate the antiviral activity of R1479 or cause additional cytotoxicity ( Figure S6A ). In contrast, inhibition of both the de novo and salvage pathways markedly enhanced the potency of R1479 ( Figure 6A ). In the presence of 250 \u00b5M CPU, the EC50 of R1479 was lowered to ~12 \u00b5M. Notably, such a 3-component regimen had minimal impact on the cytotoxicity profile of R1479 ( Figure 6B ). Regarding other analogues, 5-F-CPU-GSK983 was able to slightly potentiate the antiviral activity of R1479 whereas 5'-F-CPU appeared to actually decrease antiviral efficacy of R1479 ( Figure S6B and S6C).\n\nAs robust intracellular phosphorylation is critical for both R1479 and CPU activity, we confirmed that competition between these two compounds for intracellular kinases at the rate-limiting monophosphorylation step (Ford et al., 1991; Klumpp et al., 2008) should be minimal. Despite its 2'-\u03b1-OH group, R1479 is known to be solely phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) (Klumpp et al., 2008) and was indeed not a UCK2 substrate in our hands ( Figure S7 ). Similarly, cyclopentenyl compounds are substrates of UCK2 and not dCK (Ford et al., 1991) .\n\n. CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder.

Such replicon systems include the coding region needed for viral RNA translation and replication, while lacking the structural genes necessary for the production of viral particles. Consequently, viral genome replication is examined independent of viral entry and particle assembly (Kato and Hishiki, 2016) . In this assay (Figure 7) , the EC50 of R1479 alone was ~90 \u00b5M. Inhibition of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis alone with GSK983 did not alter this value (~96 \u00b5M), whereas addition of 250 \u00b5M CPU shifted it to ~56 \u00b5M. Targeting both the de novo and salvage pathways with a combination of 1 \u00b5M GSK and 250 \u00b5M CPU lowered the EC50 of R1479 by over 4fold to ~19 \u00b5M. These results suggest that intracellular nucleotide depletion is the major driver of CPU's antiviral activity. Together, these findings highlight the potential of combining modulators of pyrimidine metabolism with inhibitors of viral genome replication.\n\nThe flaviviruses, including dengue virus, are an important class of clinically-relevant viral pathogens with limited treatment options (Boldescu et al., 2017) . In particular, dengue causes hundreds of millions of symptomatic infections annually yet lacks any antiviral treatment while the sole approved vaccine has limited use because of safety risks associated with vaccination of individuals not previously exposed to dengue (Lim et al., 2013; Sridhar et al., 2018) . A series of high-throughput phenotypic cell-based screens have recently identified DHODH inhibition as a potent, broadspectrum antiviral strategy in vitro (Hoffmann et al., 2011; Lucas-Hourani et al., 2013; Luthra et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2011) . Furthermore, a DHODH inhibitor was recently shown to suppress SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Xiong et al., 2020) . However, DHODH inhibitors often lose antiviral activity upon extracellular uridine addition due presumably to pyrimidine salvage (Deans et al., 2016) . \n\nCC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder.

Examining viral replication with combinations of RdRp inhibitor R1479 with CPU-GSK983 treatment (A). Luminescence of DENV replicon RNA expressing luciferase in A549 cells at 48 h. In all assays, the culture medium was supplemented with 20 \u00b5M uridine and 1 \u00b5M GSK983. Error bars represent \u00b1 S.D. of three replicates.\n\nWhile a prior study has explored combining a DHODH inhibitor with guanosine analogs ribavirin or INX-08189 in a non-uridine supplemented cell culture dengue model (Yeo et al., 2015) , the antiviral efficacy of a DHODH and a salvage inhibitor has not been previously reported despite interest (Luthra et al., 2018) . Herein, we found that a GSK983-CPU combination treatment effectively blocked dengue virus replication in the presence of physiological concentrations of extracellular uridine. At the same time, depletion of UTP and CTP led to a synergy between the CPU-GSK983 combination and RdRp inhibition.\n\nSynthesis and evaluation of a series of CPU analogs revealed that CPU and 5-F-CPU were substrates of UCK2, and the resulting monophosphates were substrates of CMPK1. In combination with GSK983, the flux of CPU and 5-F-CPU to their triphosphate forms depleted intracellular pools of pyrimidine NTPs ( Figure 4A ). As the non-substrate analogue 5'-F-CPU did not deplete intracellular pyrimidines despite in vitro UCK2 inhibitory activity, our results suggest that CPU's activity in host cells is driven by its ability to block multiple targets in pyrimidine salvage rather than solely UCK2 inhibition.\n\nThis distinctive antiviral activity of CPU could conceivably originate from both host-targeting modulation of pyrimidine metabolism as well as potential direct acting antiviral activity of its triphosphate on viral replication. Intracellular nucleotide depletion appears correlated with antiviral activity given that the structurally unrelated nucleoside transport inhibitor DPY also suppressed intracellular nucleotide levels and viral replication ( Figure S5 ). Additionally, while 250 \u00b5M CPU in the absence of GSK983 did slightly potentiate the effects of R1479 on viral replication (Figure 7) , this did not translate to decreased viral infection at the same time point ( Figure S6A ). Nevertheless, further investigation of inhibitory effects of CPU-TP on dengue RdRp is warranted. Indeed, as noted previously, NIs are the largest class of RdRp inhibitors (Klumpp et al., 2008) . Additionally, a multifactorial approach that incorporates information about interactions with multiple host and viral enzymes will likely be useful for future SAR around CPU as this compound remained the most efficacious in our panel.\n\nCPU is known to be safe in vitro (Blaney et al., 1992; Ford et al., 1991; Song et al., 2001) , and does The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.992230 doi: bioRxiv preprint not show appreciable toxicity in mice (Cysyk et al., 1995) or non-human primates (Blaney et al., 1990) . While the safety profile of GSK983 remains less clear, other DHODH inhibitors like teriflunomide and brequinar have been extensively studied in humans, and are generally welltolerated (Aly et al., 2017) . Meanwhile, many RdRp inhibitors have been evaluated in clinical trials against dengue. While a preliminary study combining CPU with a de novo synthesis inhibitor in vivo resulted in toxicity (Cysyk et al., 1995) , there is precedent for combining inhibitors of de novo pyrimidine synthesis with nucleoside transport inhibitors in humans (Casper et al., 1991) . With careful dose optimization, our results suggest that a combination strategy targeting both host pyrimidine biosynthesis and viral RdRp holds promise as a potential therapy against RNA viruses. In light of the growing interest in RdRp and DHODH inhibitors as antiviral agents, our findings shine light on a promising way to enhance their clinical utility by combining them with modulators of mammalian pyrimidine metabolism.\n\nThe authors wish to thank Roberto Mateo, David Constant and Khanh Nguyen for helpful discussions and technical advice.

Reaction mixtures were stirred using Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bars and monitored by thin layer silica gel chromatography (TLC) using 0.25 mm silica gel 60F plates with fluorescent indicator from Merck. Plates were visualized under UV or treated by KMnO4 stain with gentle heating. Products were purified on an AnaLogix IntelliFlash 280 Flash column chromatography system using the solvent gradients indicated. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone, and dimethyl sufoxide (DMSO) were obtained from Acros Organics. Diethyl ether (Et2O), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), hexanes, and methanol (MeOH) were from Fisher Scientific. DMSO used in bioassays and to prepare biological samples was from Fisher BioReagents. All other reagents were from commercial suppliers and were used as received without additional purification. Samples prepared for biological evaluation were purified via preparative HPLC in a water/acetonitrile (MeCN) gradient containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoracetic acid (TFA) using an Agilent 1260 Infinity system equipped with an Agilent Prep-C18 column (21.2 x 250 mm).\n\nNMR spectra were measured on a Varian INOVA 500 ( 1 H at 500 MHz, 13 C at 125 MHz), a Varian 400 ( 1 H at 400 MHz, 13 C at 100 MHz), or a Varian INOVA 600 MHz ( 1 H at 500 MHz, 13 C at 150 MHz) magnetic resonance spectrometer, as noted. 1 H chemical shifts were reported relative to the residual solvent peak (CDCl3= 7.26 ppm; MeOD = 3.31 ppm) as follows: chemical shift (\u03b4) [multiplicity (s = singlet, brs=broad singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, dd = doublet of doublet, m = multiplet), coupling constant(s) in Hz, integration]. 13 C chemical shifts were reported relative to the residual deuterated solvent 13 C signals (CDCl3 = 77.16 ppm, MeOD = 49.00 ppm) and rounded to one decimal places.

Progress was monitored in the linear region using a Biotek Synergy HT, and kinetic constants were determined using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software). Generation of CPU-DP and 5-F-CPU-DP was confirmed by LC-MS/MS ( Figure S2 ).\n\nA549 cells were plated overnight at 80,000 cells/well in 24-well plates in complete DMEM. The next day, cells were treated with dipyridamole or 250 \u00b5M or 500 \u00b5M CPU, 5-F-CPU or 5'-F-CPU in DMEM additionally supplemented with 1 \u00b5M GSK983 and 5 \u00b5M uridine. Six or twelve hours after drug addition, the cell culture medium was removed and the whole plate was rapidly rinsed twice by dipping vertically into a beaker containing 37 \u00baC Milli-Q water. The plate was then placed on dry ice, followed by the addition of 0.5 mL -20 \u00baC lysis buffer (MeCN:MeOH:H2O = 2:2:1) containing 0.5 M formic acid and 450 nM uridine 15 N2 monophosphate sodium salt (Sigma Aldrich). The solution was then sonicated for 3 \u00b4 5 minutes on ice for the metabolite extraction. Subsequently, the sample was frozen with liquid nitrogen, freeze-dried, re-suspended with 150 \u00b5L Milli-Q water, and finally filtered through a MultiScreen 96-well filter plate prior to LC-MS analysis.\n\nLC-MS/MS was performed on an Agilent 1290 infinity II LC system tandem with 6470 triple quad mass spectrometer using ion pairing chromatography. LC separation was performed at 40 \u00baC with a solvent flow rate of 0.25 mL/min on a Zorbax RRHD Extended-C18 column (2.1 \u00d7 150 mm, 1.8 \u00b5M). Buffer A contained 97% H2O, 3% MeOH, 5 mM tributylamine, 5.5 mM acetic acid and 1 \u00b5M medronic acid at pH=5.0;Buffer B contained ca. 100% MeOH, 5 mM tributylamine, 5.5 mM acetic acid and 10 \u00b5M medronic acid at pH=7.0 The initial mobile phase composition was 100% solvent A, and the gradient (%B) after sample injection was as follows: 0% at 2.5 min, 20% at 7.5 min, 45% at 14 min, 99% at 20 to 23 min, and 0% from 23.1 to 27.1 min. The autosampler temperature was set to 4 \u00b0C and 5 \u00b5L of sample was injected. Samples were measured in the negative ESI mode with capillary voltage at \u22123.5kV. Further source settings were as follows: gas temperature, 250 \u00b0C; gas flow, 13 L/min; nebulizer, 35 psi; sheath gas temperature, 325 \u00baC; sheath gas flow, 12 L/min; nozzle voltage, 500 V; and delta EMV, -200. Acquisition was performed in dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM) mode with fragmentation pattern and retention time setting as Table SI .\n\nA549 cells were plated overnight at 5,000 cells/well in 96-well plates in complete DMEM and incubated for 24h at 37\u00baC. Cells were then treated with pyrimidine de novo synthesis inhibitors, and/or salvage inhibitors, and/or R1479 in DMEM supplemented with 20 \u00b5M uridine. Four hours after drug addition, cells were infected with DENV-2 virus at a MOI = 0.1. After 48 h or 72 h, DENV-Luc replication was monitored by the production of Renilla luciferase, which was measured using the Renilla-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the specifications of the manufacturer.\n\nFor the accompanying cell viability assay, A549 cells were seeded at 5,000 cells/well in 96-well plates in complete DMEM and incubated for 24h at 37\u00baC. Cell were then treated with pyrimidine de novo synthesis inhibitors, and/or salvage inhibitors, and/or R1479 in DMEM supplemented with 20 \u00b5M uridine. Following 48 h or 72 h treatment, cell viability was monitored via ATP levels, which were measured using the CellTiter-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the specifications of the manufacturer.\n\nFor tests of the CPU-GSK983 combination ( Figure 5B ), A549 cells were plated overnight at 20,000 cells/well in 24-well plates in complete DMEM and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. Cell were then treated with pyrimidine de novo synthesis and/or salvage inhibitors in DMEM supplemented with 20 \u00b5M uridine.
