{"title": "Attenuation of Murine Coronavirus Infection by Ammonium Chloride", "body": "chloride at a concentration of 20 mM delayed by 4-5 hr the production of virus progeny in mouse L-2 cells infected at high multiplicity with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV).\n\nThis delay was seen in the production of both intracellular and extracellular virus. However, the final titers were similar to those produced by MHV-infected cells maintained in normal medium. (Dales, 1973; Fan The earliest events involved in virus and Sefton, 1978; infection of susceptible cells remain to be 1980; Simpson et cd, 1969) . In the case of fully characterized. While a seemingly the rhabdovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus limited number of viruses such as Sendai (Schlegel et aL, 1982) , and the togavirus, virus effect entry into the cell by a direct Semliki Forest virus  fusion process of viral envelope with host Marsh et al, 1983) , the endocytic process plasma membrane (Choppin and Compans, has been shown to involve uptake into 1975) , it now appears that most lipid-clathrin-coated pits similar to those imenveloped viruses are taken up by an plicated in the receptor-dependent uptake of hormones and other proteins (Dickson Sciences Centre, 3330 Hospital Drive NW, Calgary, endosome into the cytosol  addressed. Maeda et al, 1981; White et aL, 1981) .\n\nLysosomotropic agents such as ammonium chloride and a variety of amines have been demonstrated to inhibit the replication of viruses from the toga- (Helenius et d, 1982) , rhabdo- (Schlegel et cd., 1982) , orthomyxo- (Kato and Eggers, 1969) , retro- (Pazmino et aL, 1974) , and herpes- (Shimizu et al, 1972) virus families. A common characteristic of these agents is that they are weak bases and accumulate within acidic intracellular compartments, notably lysosomes, thereby elevating pH (Ohkuma and Poole, 1978) . Perturbation of the pH within lysosomes and related vesicles has been shown (Helenius et cd., 1980; Marsh et cd, 1983) to inhibit the fusion of the prelysosomal (or endosomal) membrane with the viral envelope of the togavirus, Semliki Forest virus. Such fusion inhibition thereby interferes with virion uncoating and liberation of viral genome into the cytosol.\n\nThe role of lysosomes and related acidic compartments in the replication of coronaviruses is not well understood. Coronavirus infection frequently involves the intracellular accumulation of virus-filled, electron-dense structures which have been interpreted to be lysosomes (David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965, Ducatelle and Hoorens, 1984) . Such structures are observed within 2-3 hr postinoculation and have, therefore, been suggested to be involved in virus uptake (David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965) . Further evidence for a lysosomal role in coronavirus replication was provided by studies in which lysosomotropic agents were found to inhibit production of virus progeny and cytopathic effect in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV; Mallucci, 1966; Krzystyniak and Dupuy, 1984) .\n\nBesides affecting early events, lysosomotropic agents including ammonium chloride have been reported to inhibit other stages in virus replication, such as protein glycosylation (Kousoulas et aL, 1982) and expression of cytopathic activity (Holland and Person, 1977) . In order to investigate more precisely the mode of action of ammonium chloride on the replication of MHV, we undertook a systematic examination of its effects on the normal se-quence of events occurring during the replication of MHV in a lytic, syncytiogenic infection of mouse L-2 cells.\n\nIqfection and culture umditions. L-2 cells (Rothfels et al, 1959) maintained as described previously (Lucas et cd, 1977) were inoculated with the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), adsorbed for 30 min at 4\", washed with minimum essential medium (MEM), and then incubated at 37' in MEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). Culture medium was made 20 mM with respect to ammonium chloride by the addition of a 200 mM stock solution.\n\nAssags of intracellular and extracellular MHV Cultures of L-2 cells, inoculated with MHV (see above) at a multiplicity of infection (m.0.i.) of 20 in 35-mm tissue culture plates were used. To determine levels of extracellular MHV, aliquots were removed from culture media for subsequent plaque assay (Lucas et cd., 1977) . To assay intracellular MHV levels, monolayers were thrice washed with MEM and harvested on ice in 2 ml MEM with 5% FCS by scraping with a Teflon policeman. Harvests were forced twice through a 21gauge needle fitted to a 3-ml plastic syringe and subjected to a single cycle of freezing (-70\") and rapid thawing. The thawed samples were finally forced through a 30-gauge needle and directly assayed for infectious virus by plaque assay (Lucas et cd., 1977) .\n\nAssay of virus internalization, Cultures of L-2 cells in 35-mm plates were adsorbed for 30 min with MHV at an m.o.i. of 5, washed to remove excess inoculum, then warmed to 37\" for varying intervals in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride. Cultures were subsequently treated with proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 45 min at 4O in order to remove external virus (Helenius et cd, 1980) . After terminating the protease treatment with 1 mM PMSF, 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, cells were transferred to a centrifuge tube, spun into pellets (1 min at 650 g), and washed twice with 0.2% BSA in PBS. The final cell pellets were assayed for internalized virus by infectious center assay on L-2 monolayers.\n\nAssay for ir&ctivity of internalized virus inoculum. Cultures of L-2 cells in 35mm plates were adsorbed for 30 min with MHV at an m.o.i. of 5, washed to remove excess inoculum, and subsequently incubated for 20 min at 37\" in medium either containing or lacking ammonium chloride. Cells were then treated with proteinase K (as above) to remove external virus, washed, and then returned to incubation at 37\" in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride. At various intervals, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice, and assayed for intracellular MHV as described above.\n\nInfectious center assays. Infected cell monolayers, cultured in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride, were washed, trypsinized, and assayed for infectious centers as previously described (Lucas et aL, 197'7) except that, in some cases, ammonium chloride (20 mM) was included in the assay medium.\n\nDot-blot hybridization assay of viral RNA synthesis. Culture dishes (35 mm) of L-2 cells inoculated with MHV at an m.o.i. of 20 were harvested at various times postinoculation (PI) and subjected to dot-blot hybridization analysis as previously described (Cheley and Anderson, 1984) using a =P-labeled cDNA prepared against MHV nucleocapsid-protein mRNA (Cheley et oL, 1981) . It should be noted that this cDNA detects sequences present in all (+)-sense, intracellular MHV RNAs .\n\nGel electrophoresis analysis of viral RNA. Cultures of L-2 cells, inoculated with MHV at an m.o.i. of 20 were incubated at 37' in MEM supplemented with 5% FCS. At 0, 1, 2, or 3 hr PI culture medium was changed to fresh MEM supplemented with 5% FCS and containing 20 mi U ammonium chloride. Cultures were supplemented with actinomycin D (2 pg/ ml) at 4 hr PI and subsequently radiolabeled at 5 hr PI with [5-3H]uridine (10 &i/ml).\n\nCultures were harvested at 6 hr PI as described (Cheley and Anderson, 1984) except that the RNA pellets were taken up in 1 ml 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 7M urea, 10 mM Tris, pH 5. Aliquots of 10 ~1 were applied to the wells of a l-mm-thick 1% agarose gel prepared in 50% DMSO, 7 M urea, 10 mM Tris, pH 5, and electrophoresed in a vertical gel apparatus for 5-6 hr at 15 mA. Following electrophoresis, the gel was treated with EN3HANCE\n\n(New England Nuclear), dried, and autoradiographed.\n\nAnalysis of viral protein synthesis. Cultures of L-2 cells in 35-mm plates, inoculated with MHV at an m.o.i. of 20, were incubated at 37\" in 2 ml MEM with 5% FCS with or without ammonium chloride. At various times PI culture medium was replaced with 0.5 ml of labeling medium ([35S]methionine (100 &i/ml) in methionine-free MEM, with or without ammonium chloride). After further incubation for 30 min at 37\", cultures were harvested and samples subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and fluorography as previously described . For in vitro translations, postmitochondrial (\"S-30\") extracts were prepared from infected cells at 5 hr PI, according to the procedure of Fischer and Moldave (1981 centration of 20 mM delayed the production of progeny MHV by roughly 4 hr in MHV-inoculated L-2 cells (Fig. 1) . As shown in Fig. lA , intracellular MHV progeny is first detectable under normal culture conditions at approx 4-5 hr PI. In contrast, intracellular MHV progeny does not appear until approx 8 hr PI in the presence of ammonium chloride. From the times of initial appearance of progeny virus, however, the replication profiles, either in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride, are very similar. Moreover, the final titers of MHV produced in either case differ only by a fraction of a log.\n\nA similar delaying effect of ammonium chloride was observed on the production of extracellular virus. Under normal conditions, MHV-infected L-2 cells first produce detectable extracellular virus at approx 5 hr PI (Fig. 1B) . In the presence of ammonium chloride, however, extracellular virus is not seen until approx 9-10 hr PI. Again, as in the case of intracellular kmmk-HOURS RI. virus, the subsequent replication curves and final virus titers are very similar, whether monitored from control or ammonium chloride-treated cultures. The above results suggest that the action of ammonium chloride is to attenuate a step in MHV replication, which once overcome, permits normal virus production. If this step is an early one, the normal chronology for the majority of the events associated with MHV replication will be displaced by a 4-to 5-hr time interval similar to that observed with virus replication.\n\nIn agreement with this prediction, the manifestation of cell-cell fusion, a hallmark of MHV infection of L-2 cells (Mizzen et al, 1983 ) was found to be delayed by ammonium chloride (Table 1) to an extent similar (approx 5 hr) to that observed with the production of virus progeny. The final levels of cell fusion in both ammonium chloride-treated and control cultures, were, nevertheless, similar, i.e., engulfing the total cell monolayer. There would, therefore, appear to be no specifically inhibitory effect of ammonium chloride on MHV-mediated cell fusion per se.\n\nIn order to confirm that the effect of ammonium chloride on MHV replication was one of attenuation rather than suppression, the number of productively infected L-2 cells was monitored by an infectious center assay. Cultures of MHVinoculated L-2 cells were incubated for 3 hr at 3'7\" in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride, then trypsinized and plated on uninfected L-2 cell monolayers in order to quantitatively screen for numbers of productively infected cells. As shown in Table 2 , ammonium chloridetreated cultures showed similar numbers of infected cells as untreated cultures. Moreover, little difference was observed even when ammonium chloride was included in the medium used for the infectious center assay ( Table 2 ). The size of the plaque produced by each infectious center, however, was considerably smaller in the case of the cells which were cultured in the presence of ammonium chloride. This result is entirely consistent with the idea that ammonium chloride attenuates or delays MHV replication, without imposing an absolute block.\n\nEflects of ammonium chloride on earlg stages of MHV ir&ection. In agreement with the studies by Krzystyniak and Dupuy (1984) , our preliminary experiments had shown that MHV adsorption to L cells was unaffected by the presence of ammonium chloride. Accordingly, all studies reported in the present paper were performed with the addition of ammonium chloride immediately following the adsorption period. The entry of MHV into the host cell appears to be one involving viropexis (David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965) in which virus inoculum is internalized within a cytoplasmic vesicle or endosome. In order to investigate whether ammonium chloride affected the process of virus internalization, MHV-adsorbed cells were warmed to 37\" for various intervals in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride, then stripped of external virus with proteinase K, and as-sayed for internalized virus by infectious center assay. The results shown in Fig.  2A demonstrate that virus internalization occurred with equal efficiency, whether or not ammonium chloride was present. In either case, uptake of MHV into the cell occurred rapidly upon exposure to 37\" and was essentially complete after 2 hr. Events subsequent to virus uptake, which result in the liberation of viral genome into the cytosol have not been characterized in coronavirus replication. One possibility, analogous to that observed with many enveloped viruses, is that the viral envelope undergoes fusion with the membrane of the surrounding vesicle (e.g., Marsh et c& 1983) . Since this latter fusion event is known to be inhibited by lysosomotropic amines in the case of infection with certain viruses, such as the enveloped togaviruses , we monitored the effect of ammonium chloride on the eclipse phase of MHV infection. Virus uncoating, as well as any other degradative processes occurring during the eclipse phase, can be monitored by following the decline in infectivity of internalized MHV inoculum. In order to allow a reasonable degree of virus internalization to occur MHV-adsorbed cells were warmed to 37' for 20 min in medium with and without ammonium chloride. Under these conditions, approximately 50% of cellbound virus is internalized ( Fig. 2A) . Cells were then treated with proteinase K to remove external virus, incubated at 37\" in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride, then subsequently lysed and assayed for infectivity of internalized inoculum. While this procedure does not permit analysis of events occurring during the first 20 min, it is evident from the results shown in Fig. 2B , that the eclipse phase in MHV infection is strikingly affected by the presence of ammonium chloride. At the first time point examined (20 min) virus eclipse was seen to occur more rapidly in the absence of ammonium chloride, as judged by an approx 17% decrease in relative infectivity of intracellular inoculum. The effect of ammonium chloride on virus eclipse became more pronounced with time. Thus, while in normal MHV infection, virus eclipse was complete by 3 hr PI, the process occurred with clearly less efficiency in the presence of ammonium chloride (Fig. 2B) , so that even as late as 5 hr PI considerable infectivity was associated with the internalized virus inoculum. We interpret these data on the eclipse stage of MHV infection as suggesting an inhibitory effect of ammonium chloride on one or more processes involved in the uncoating of MHV. It is not possible to say at present as to which proportion of the eclipsed virus represents legitimate endosomal uncoating as opposed to a possible \"dead-end\" pathway of lysosomal degradation. Indeed, in light of the infectious center data (Table 2) , it is apparent that, even in the presence of ammonium chloride, MHV must eventually uncoat to a similar degree as that attained in untreated cells. Given the evidence that ammonium chloride inhibits the activities of both lysosomes (Ohkuma and Poole, 1978) and endosomes (Maxfield, 1982) the results of Fig. 2B are best explained on the basis of combined inhibitory actions on lysosomal/endosomal processing of internalized MHV.\n\nEflects of ammonium chloride on MHV-RNA synthesis. If the eclipse phase is the primary site of action of ammonium chloride during MHV replication, then attenuation or delay of infection at this early stage would be expected to give rise to similar delays in subsequent virus-encoded functions. Since the first easily assayable function following eclipse is viral RNA synthesis, we examined levels of MHV RNA produced in infected cells maintained in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride. Radiolabeled RNA obtained at 6 hr PI from MHV-infected L-2 cells, maintained in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride, was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and autoradiographic analysis. The normal pattern of MHVencoded RNAs numbered according to the convention of Siddell et al. (1983) was obtained (Fig. 3 , lane C). When ammonium chloride was present immediately following adsorption, the level of radiolabeled MHV RNA was reduced (Fig. 3 , lane 0) to 8% of the control level, as determined by comparative densitometric scanning of lanes 0 and C. When the addition of ammonium chloride was delayed by 1, 2, or 3 hr following adsorption, thus permitting progressively in the absence (C) or in the presence of ammonium chloride, added either immediately after adsorption (0), 1 hr PI (l), 2 hr PI (2), or 3 hr PI (3). Viral RNA was radiolabeled by culturing the infected cells with [8Hjuridine in the presence of actinomycin D. Cultures were harvested at 6 hr PI, and the RNA was extracted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. An autoradiograph of the dried gel is shown. Numbering of the MHV-specific RNA bands follows the convention of Siddell et aL (1983) . more virus uncoating, the levels of radiolabeled MHV RNA were seen to increase (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 2, and 3) to 34, 52, and 85%, respectively, of that obtained in the normal MHV infection (lane C). Furthermore, the normal electrophoretic pattern of MHV RNA was obtained in the presence of ammonium chloride. In order to determine whether the effect of ammonium chloride on viral RNA synthesis was one of inhibition or attenuation, a quantitative time-course analysis of viral RNA levels was performed on MHVinfected cells maintained in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride. As shown in Figs. 4A and B, MHV-infected L-2 cells, maintained in normal medium, first showed detectable levels of viral RNA at 3 hr PI; this was delayed until approx 6 hr PI when ammonium chloride was present. Nevertheless, the ammonium chloride-treated culture eventually (at 12 hr PI) produced levels of viral RNA very similar to the maximum levels produced in the untreated culture. Although the kinetics of RNA synthesis were noticeably slower in the presence of ammonium chloride, this is likely due to a certain degree of desynchronization in the initiation of RNA transcription, as a consequence of the protracted eclipse (uncoating) stage (Fig. 2B) . Thus, it would appear that ammonium chloride does not inhibit viral RNA synthesis in a quantitative manner, but rather delays its onset.\n\nEflecti of ammonium chloride cm MHV protein synthesis. In a time-course manner analogous to that used for viral RNA quantitation, viral protein synthesis was monitored in infected L-2 cells maintained in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride. As shown in Figs. 4C and D, the intracellular synthesis of viral polypeptides is delayed by some 4-6 hr in the presence of ammonium chloride.\n\nNevertheless, all three structural polypeptide classes (Ez, N, and E,) are synthesized in normal proportions (Fig. 4C ) and in eventual levels (Fig. 4D ) similar to those seen in untreated cells.\n\nIn order to test whether ammonium chloride had a specific, inhibitory effect on translation of viral proteins from MHV-messenger RNA, cell-free translation was performed using an S-30 prepared from MHV-infected L-2 cells harvested at 5 hr PI. The S-30 was \"self-translated\" (i.e., using its endogenous mRNA) in the presence of 0, 10, or 20 mJ4 ammonium chloride.\n\nThe major viral translation products were the nucleocapsid (N) protein and the envelope membrane (El and its precursor PE1) proteins. The addition of ammonium chloride to the S-30 did not have an inhibitory effect on the synthesis of any of these viral proteins (data not shown).\n\nCertain compounds such as amines have been noted to enter cells and become sequestered within specific vesicular compartments, such as lysosomes (Wibo and Poole, 1974) , endosomes, or receptosomes Dickson et al, 1981) , and phagosomes (Young et &, 1981) . Within these normally acidic organelles, amines effectively raise the local pH (Ohkuma and Poole, 1981; Young et aL, 1981) , thereby affecting a number of pH-dependent activities. One such activity is the pH-de-pendent fusion step between the vesicular membrane and the lipid envelope of a variety of viruses, such as alphaviruses (Helenius et uL, 1980) , rhabdoviruses (Fan and Sefton, 1978) , and orthomyxoviruses .\n\nEarly steps in coronavirus replication have not been thoroughly characterized. Studies with both avian (Chasey and Alexander, 1976 ) and murine (David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965; Krzystyniak and Dupuy, 1984) coronaviruses have demonstrated that uptake of viral inoculum occurs predominantly by viropexis. As a result, virions are observed in cytoplasmic vesicles within 1 to 2 hr postinoculation (David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965) . There has to date, however, been no documentation, by electron microscopic or other means, of the uncoating process of intracellular coronaviruses. A role for lysosomal involvement in coronavirus replication was first suggested by Mallucci (1966) who noted that the lysosomotropic agent, chloroquine, reduced MHV yields from inoculated mouse peritoneal macrophages. In a recent study, Krzystyniak and Dupuy (1984) described an inhibitory effect of the lysosomotropic agent, ammonium chloride, on the replication of MHV. These authors noted that when the addition of ammonium chloride to MHVinfected cells was delayed until 3 hr PI, the inhibitory effect was largely abrogated, suggesting that an early event in the replication cycle was affected.\n\nThe results of the present study offer the novel finding that the inhibitory action of ammonium chloride on MHV replication can be explained largely on the basis of an inhibitory effect on the eclipse phase, particularly uncoating. All posteclipse parameters examined (progeny MHV production, cell fusion, viral protein synthesis, and viral RNA synthesis) were found to be chronologically displaced by about 4-7 hr when the infection was performed in the presence of ammonium chloride. These results demonstrate that ammonium chloride intervenes primarily at a stage prior to, or including, synthesis of viral RNA (positive-sense species) during the MHV replication cycle. This stage is likely that of uncoating as suggested by the protracted eclipse (Fig. 2) in the presence of ammonium chloride. Of interest in the present study is our finding that, in the presence of ammonium chloride, viral polypeptides appear to be synthesized with normal apparent molecular weights. In particular, there was no detectable change in the SDS-PAGE mobility of the major viral glycoprotein (Ez) which could be ascribed to altered glycosylation. Apparent alterations in glycosylation of viral glycoproteins have been observed in herpesvirus infections of human embryonic lung cells, when maintained in ammonium chloride at a concentration of 50 mM (Kousoulas et al, 1982 (Kousoulas et al, , 1983 but not at 20 mM (Holland and Person, 1977) . Concentrations of ammonium chloride higher than 20 mM were found in our preliminary experiments to be cytotoxic to the mouse L-2 cells used for MHV infection.\n\nAmmonium chloride (Holland and Person, 1977) as well as certain tertiary amines (Poste and Allison, 1973) have been reported to inhibit membrane fusion, presumably by direct action on membrane components or their immediate ionic environment.\n\nIn the present study, MHVinduced L-2 cell fusion is delayed in the presence of ammonium chloride. This delay, however, appears to be a consequence of inhibitory activity at an early stage, particularly uncoating, rather than a direct inhibitory action on membrane fusion.\n\nThe molecular events involved in pHdependent virus uncoating are best characterized in the case of influenza virus. Here, pH-dependent fusion with the endosomal membrane is accompanied by a conformational change in the hemagglutinin glycoprotein, resulting in exposure of a fusion-active, hydrophobic peptide (Skehel et aL, 1982) . In the case of the alphavirus, Sindbis, evidence has also been presented (Edwards et d, 1983) suggesting that one of the envelope glycoproteins (the E,) undergoes conformational rearrangement upon exposure to acidic conditions. It remains uncertain, however, as to whether the alphaviral E2 or another Ez glycoprotein, which has been shown to FISCHER, I., and MOLDAVE, K. (1981) . Preparation be responsible for manifestation of cell-and characterization of a cell-free system from cell fusion activity (Collins et cd, 1982) .\n\nChinese hamster ovary cells that translates natural messenger ribonucleic acid and analysis of intermediary reactions.
