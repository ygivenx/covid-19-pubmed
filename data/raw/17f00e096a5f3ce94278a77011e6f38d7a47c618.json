{"title": "Tumor-associated macrophages secrete CC-chemokine ligand 2 and induce tamoxifen resistance by activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR in breast cancer", "body": "Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in women. 1 Approximately 70% of breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive. 2 Although endocrine therapy remains the most effective treatment, its efficacy is limited by intrinsic or acquired endocrine resistance. [3] [4] [5] Tamoxifen, a selective ER modulator, is the most common endocrine therapy worldwide 6 ; hence, resistance to tamoxifen is a major clinical challenge.\n\nSolid tumors such as breast cancer usually contain heterogeneous populations of neoplastic cells, immune cells, and collections of tissue-specific resident and recruited stromal cell types, which together form the TME. 7, 8 The relevance of this tumor heterogeneity is linked to various hallmarks of cancer including drug resistance. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Macrophages are diverse cells that show distinct phenotypes depending on their anatomical location and activating stimuli. 15, 16 In breast cancer, macrophages can comprise up to 50% of the TME. 17 Among them, M2-type macrophages, commonly referred to as TAM, are associated with tumor malignancy. 18, 19 CD163, a scavenger receptor, is regarded as a highly specific monocyte/macrophage marker for M2 polarization. 20 Escamilla et al reported that TAM are involved in the resistance of patients with prostate cancer to androgen blockade therapy. 21 In our previous study, we found a correlation between TAM and tamoxifen resistance in patients with breast cancer, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. 22 Tumor-associated macrophages secrete a variety of chemokines into the TME including CCL2, which is secreted mainly by macrophages when cocultured with MCF7 cells. 23 CCL2 is also known as MCP-1 and small inducible cytokine A2. CCL2 belongs to the CC chemokine family that recruits monocytes, memory T cells, and dendritic cells to sites of inflammation. 24, 25 Several studies have reported that CCL2 and the inflammatory environment promote the malignant behavior of different tumors. [26] [27] [28] Xu et al found that CCL2 recruits monocytes to the TME and polarizes macrophages into the M2 type. 25 Secretion of CCL2 is also an important manifestation of TAM polarization in macrophages. 29 Ueno et al showed that a high level of CCL2 expression is a significant indicator of earlier relapse. 30 However, there have been only a few studies on the role of CCL2 in endocrine resistance of breast cancer.\n\nThe molecular mechanism underlying endocrine resistance of breast cancer is highly complicated and involves many molecules and pathways such as overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor and/or the HER-2/neu/ErbB2 oncogene, 31 mutations in ER or loss of ER-alpha expression, 32,33 activation of the MAPK 32 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways, 34 and overexpression of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. 35 Among these factors, the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is dominant.\n\nThota et al observed induction of endocrine resistance by tumor macrophages, although the intrinsic molecular mechanism remains unclear. 36 The aim of the present study was to explore the interaction between TAM and the endocrine-resistant phenotype in breast cancer.\n\nCM from tamoxifen-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cells was tested for its ability to induce macrophage M2 polarization. We then examined the role of TAM in promoting tamoxifen resistance. We also identified a specific cytokine, CCL2, secreted by TAM to promote endocrine resistance and investigated its underlying mechanism of action. CCL2 immunohistochemistry was carried out on pathological sections from patients with invasive ER-positive breast cancer to examine the correlation between CCL2 expression and disease prognosis. Our findings will further the understanding of how TAM promote tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells and may identify novel therapeutic targets for patients with endocrine-resistant breast cancer. \n\nCell proliferation was assessed using CCK-8 (Vazyme) assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well and incubated with 5 \u03bcmol/L tamoxifen for 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours. At the K E Y W O R D S breast cancer, CCL2, tamoxifen resistance, tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophage end of the respective incubation times, the cells were incubated in complete medium containing 10% CCK-8 reagent for 2 hours.\n\nSubsequently, absorbance of the sample was measured at 450 nm in a microplate reader (Tecan). The experiments were repeated three times.\n\nM\u03a6, MS, and MR human macrophages grown in small culture dishes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes, followed by washing with PBS thrice. Cells were blocked with 5% BSA for 30 minutes, and then incubated with the anti-CD163 antibody (diluted 1:1000) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Signal was detected using Alexa \n\nTotal RNA was extracted from M\u03a6, MS, and MR macrophages using Table S1 .\n\nCCL2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 present in culture supernatants from MCF7-S, MCF7-R, M\u03a6, MS, and MR macrophages were quantified using specific ELISA kits (Quantikine Human CCL2 Immunoassay and Quantikine Human TNF\u03b1 Immunoassay; R&D Systems) following the manufacturer's instructions. Concentration of the samples was estimated from the standard curve. CCL2 and TNF\u03b1 levels below the detection limit of the assay were recorded as zero. \n\nCells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Protein samples were sonicated followed by centrifugation at 17 153 g for 15 minutes. Supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad). Protein lysates were then subjected to 4%-20% Tris-glycine SDS PAGE, and then transferred onto PVDF membranes according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked in 5% milk-Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween (TBS-T) at 23\u00b0C for 1 hour, followed by incubation with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. On the following day, the membranes were washed with TBS-T thrice before incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling) at 23\u00b0C for 1 hour. Protein expression was visualized by ECL chemiluminescence (Promega) and quantified using Image J software (National Cancer Institute).\n\nMicroporous membrane (8-\u03bcm pore size) Transwell inserts (Costar) were used in the chemotaxis assay. Briefly, 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells in 200 \u03bcL RPMI-1640 were added to the upper chamber, and 500 \u03bcL CM from M\u03a6, MS, MR, and MR + Bindarit was added to the lower chamber.\n\nTHP-1 cells were allowed to migrate at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 /95% air, and then the inserts were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal staining solution. Non-migratory cells were removed before the membrane was mounted and migratory cells were observed and counted under a microscope.\n\nThe protocol for this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of positivity. CCL2 immunoreactivity was scored by staining intensity (negative, weak, moderate, or strong staining) and the percentage of positive tumor cells per core (\u226425%, >25%-50%, >50%-75%, and >75%). Tissues were considered positive for CCL2 expression with \u2265moderate staining intensity in >25% of the cells examined. Yellow granules indicated CD163 positivity. CD163 immunoreactivity was scored as the infiltration density of CD163+ macrophages ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (dense). A score equal to or greater than 1 was regarded as positive.\n\nData are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism software (version 6.0) and SPSS Statistics software (Version 19.0). Multiple comparisons were evaluated using the one-way ANOVA. Correlation between CD163 and CCL2 was determined using Spearman rank-order correlation.\n\nSurvival curves were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and curves were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate survival analysis using the Cox regression proportional hazards model was carried out to adjust for clinical variables that may have statistical significance for prognosis in a univariate analysis. Results with P values <.05 were considered to be statistically significant (*P < .05, **P < .01). To examine the differences in the macrophages, cellular CD163 immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analysis were carried out on the M\u03a6, MS, and MR. CD163 is considered a polarization maker for TAM and M2. We found that CM from breast cancer cell lines increased CD163 expression in M\u03a6, indicating M2 polarization.\n\nCD163 expression was higher and M2 polarization was more significant in MR than in MS ( Figure 1B,C) . These observations indicate that macrophages can be polarized to assume different phenotypes in different microenvironments. Figure 2B ). Thus, we conclude that CCL2 is associated with endocrine resistance promoted by TAM. Two hormone receptor-positive cell lines, MCF7 and T47D, were selected to test the effect of CCL2. We confirmed that CCR2, the receptor of CCL2, was expressed in both cell lines ( Figure S1 ). CCL2 (100 nm/mL) was added to the two cell lines and the cells were cultured for 24 hours. Subsequently, tamoxifen (5 \u03bcmol/L) was added to all four groups (MCF7, MCF7+CCL2, T47D, and T47D+CCL2) and the cells were cultured for 24 hours. Cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 assay ( Figure 2C,D) . The four groups were also analyzed by flow cytometry to detect apoptosis ( Figure 2E ,F). We found that CCL2 promotes endocrine resistance and reduces apoptotic proportion in the two hormone receptor-positive cell lines.\n\nWe have shown that CCL2 is associated with endocrine resistance in MCF7 and T47D cell lines. As the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is a classic pathway regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and endocrine resistance, we investigated the effect of CCL2 on the activation of this pathway. When MCF7 cells were treated with 100 nmol/L CCL2, phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR was significantly increased. Adding CM of MR to MCF7 cells also activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. When MR was treated with 300 nmol/L Bindarit (a CCL2 synthesis inhibitor), the ability of the CM (MR + Bindarit) to increase the levels of phosphorylated Akt and mTOR was weakened ( Figure 2G ). These results suggest that TAM promote endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells partly by secreting CCL2, which then activates the PI3K/Akt/ mTOR pathway.\n\nCCL2 secretion has been thought to be dependent on the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which is activated by TNF\u03b1 in TME. 44 We tested whether breast cancer cells and macrophages pro- expression independent of NF-\u03baB signaling by dephosphorylating the transcription factor FOXK1. 45 We tested the activation of the mTORC1-FOXK1 pathway in M\u03a6, MS, and MR and found that activation of the mTORC1-FOXK1 pathway was consistent with the secretion trend of CCL2 ( Figure 3C ). These results suggest that TNF\u03b1 and amino acid metabolism in CM activate the NF-\u03baB and mTORC1-FOXK1 pathways of TAM promoting the secretion of CCL2.\n\nAs a well-known chemokine abundantly present in macrophages, CCL2 is responsible for the recruitment of monocytes. [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] 46 The concentration of CCL2 is positively correlated with its chemotaxispromoting potential. We have already determined that the levels of CCL2 secreted by M\u03a6, MS, and MR are different. The next question is whether the chemotaxis of THP-1 cells induced by these three F I G U R E 2 CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) secreted by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to induce endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells. A, RT-PCR shows the transcription of seven cytokines in three macrophages, M\u03a6, TAM from a tamoxifen-sensitive tumor microenvironment (TME) (MS), and TAM from tamoxifen-resistant TME (MR). Only the change trend of CCL2 is consistent with the previous experiment results, and the difference was statistically significant. B, CCL2 levels in the conditioned medium (CM) of tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 breast cancer cells (MCF7-S), tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells (MCF7-R), M\u03a6, MS, and MR cells. CCL2 was mainly produced by macrophages rather than breast cancer cells. C, Relative viability of MCF7 and MCF7 + CCL2 (100 nm/mL) cells treated with 5 \u03bcmol/L tamoxifen. D, Relative viability of T47D and T47D + CCL2 (100 nm/mL) cells treated with 5 \u03bcmol/L tamoxifen. E, Apoptosis of MCF7 and MCF7 + CCL2 (100 nm/mL) cells was analyzed by flow cytometry at 24 h after adding 5 \u03bcmol/L tamoxifen. F, Apoptosis of T47D and T47D + CCL2 (100 nm/mL) cells was analyzed by flow cytometry at 24 h after adding 5 \u03bcmol/L tamoxifen. G, Western blot analysis of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. CCL2 and CM of MR could activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in MCF7 cells. When MR was treated with Bindarit for 24 h, activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by CM decreased. *P < .05, **P < .01, ***P < .001 F I G U R E 3 Tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 breast cancer cells (MCF7-S) and tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells (MCF7-R) secrete tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 and induce activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and mTORC1-FOXK1 pathways in tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). A, TNF\u03b1 levels in conditioned medium (CM) from MCF7-S, MCF7-R, M\u03a6, TAM from a tamoxifen-sensitive tumor microenvironment (TME) (MS), and TAM from tamoxifen-resistant TME (MR) cells. Level of TNF\u03b1 in the CM of TAM was higher, but the difference between MS and MR was not significant (NS). B, Western blot analysis of the NF-\u03baB pathway. CM of MCF7-S and MCF7-R could activate the NF-\u03baB pathway of TAM. C, Western blot analysis of the mTORC1-FOXK1 pathway. CM of MCF7-S and MCF7-R could activate the mTORC1-FOXK1 pathway of TAM. Dephosphorylation of MR was more obvious than that of MS. Therefore, CM of MCF7-R can promote activation of the mTORC1-FOXK1 pathway more than MCF7-S. *P < .05, **P < .01 macrophages coincides with the secretion of CCL2. Results of the chemotaxis assay confirmed that the chemotaxis-inducing effect of TAM toward THP-1 cells was stronger than that of macrophages, the chemotaxis-inducing effect of MR was stronger than that of MS, and Bindarit the inhibitor of CCL2 reverses the enhanced chemotaxis ability of MR ( Figure 4A ). To further validate this phenomenon in vitro, we analyzed tissue samples from 100 patients with ER-positive breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry of serial pathological sections showed that a high expression of CCL2 in the paraneoplastic stroma was correlated with infiltration of CD163+ macrophages (r = 0.548, P < .001) ( Figure 4B and Table S2 ). We propose that tumor cells stimulate M2 polarization of macrophages, which leads to increased secretion of CCL2, and a high concentration of CCL2 in turn promotes THP-1 aggregation to form more M2-like macrophages.\n\nTo determine the clinical relevance of CCL2 and endocrine resistance in the in vitro findings, we selected 100 patients with invasive ER-positive breast cancer who received regular endocrine therapy at the Tumor Hospital of Harbin Medical University from 2004 to 2014 F I G U R E 4 High concentration of CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) recruits monocytes and macrophages to facilitate an endocrine-resistant microenvironment in breast cancer. A, Representative photos of THP-1 cells recruited by the conditioned medium (CM) of M\u03a6, TAM from a tamoxifen-sensitive tumor microenvironment (TME) (MS), TAM from tamoxifen-resistant TME (MR), and MR + Bindarit after the chemotaxis assay. Quantitative results show that the chemotaxis ability of TAM to recruit THP-1 cells was enhanced, and TAM in the endocrine-resistant environment had stronger chemotaxis ability. Bindarit reverses the enhanced chemotaxis ability of CM (MR). B, Representative images of immunohistochemical staining for CCL2 and CD163 and HE staining in serial sections from human breast cancer samples. The related correlation analyses showed r = .548. *P < .05, **P < .01 F I G U R E 5 CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) expression in the stroma correlated with poor recurrence-free survival of patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. A, Different patterns of CCL2 immunohistochemical staining in the stroma of breast cancer cells. B, Kaplan-Meier recurrence-free survival curves of patients with hormone receptorpositive breast cancer with low (n = 71) and high (n = 29) CCL2 expression in the stroma (P = .029). C, Proposed model for TAM-secreted CCL2 activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to promote a malignant cycle of endocrine resistance and recruitment of monocytes (Table S3) Results showed that PFS of the CCL2 high-expression group was significantly shorter than that of the CCL2 low-expression group (P < .05). The prognostic value of each clinicopathological feature was assessed using Cox hazard regression analysis. CCL2 expression was found to be an independent risk factor for disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 2.323, P = .015) ( Table 1) . Taken together, these results indicate a crucial role of CCL2 in promoting endocrine resistance in breast cancer. We also found that TAM promote endocrine resistance by secreting CCL2, which activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, CCL2 plays an important role in this malignant feedback loop. In addition, CCL2 promotes the aggregation of monocytes and macrophages in the TME. 48 The transition from monocytes to TAM further promotes the formation of the endocrine-resistant microenvironment. Analysis of tissue samples from patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer confirmed a correlation between high expression of CCL2 in the paraneoplastic stroma and infiltration of CD163+ macrophages. Moreover, patients with high CCL2 expression in the stroma had a shorter PFS after endocrine therapy. This is consistent with the findings of our previous study that patients with high CD163+ macrophage infiltration tend to develop endocrine resistance. 22 The finding that CCL2 promotes the formation of the TME and the malignant cycle of cells in the TME may partly explain why patients with endocrine resistance in the past are more likely to be resistant to new endocrine therapy.\n\nTumor-associated macrophages can adjust their phenotype and function in response to local cues provided by the TME. 49 Crosstalk between TAM and cancer cells is complex and involves exosomes, cytokines, and metabolites. [50] [51] [52] In the present study, we focused on the cytokine CCL2 secreted by macrophages and TA B L E 1 Univariate and multivariate analyses of clinicopathological features associated with PFS of patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer examined its role in the endocrine resistance of breast cancer cells. We found that CCL2 activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which is a classical endocrine resistance pathway. However, the direct mechanism by which CCL2 activates this pathway was not determined. Another limitation of the present study was that due to the long culture time of drug-resistant cell lines, the effects of endocrine-resistant and -sensitive T47D cell lines on macrophages could not be repeated.\n\nCell components in the TME are complex. In addition to TAM, fibroblasts, dendritic cells, epithelial cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes can also be tamed by tumor cells and promote a tumor malignant environment. [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] It has been reported that dendritic cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells tamed by cancer cells secrete CCL2. 55 \n\nThis study was financially supported by the National Natural Science \n\nAuthors declare no conflicts of interest for this article.
