Viruses that replicate readily in culture and induce dramatic cytopathic effect (CPE), such as influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses responsible for common colds (229E and OC43) were identified and characterized by electron microscopy in the 1960s. However, these efficiently propagating viruses likely represent only a fraction of the viruses that cause significant clinical disease (Iwane et al., 2004; Jartti et al., 2004; Juven et al., 2000) . In recent years, viral respiratory pathogens such as human metapneumovirus (van den Hoogen et al., 2001) and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) (van der Hoek et al., 2004 ) that propagate slowly in standard cell lines have been identified using molecular approaches to amplify novel sequences from infected cell lines. However, the optimal propagation of a human respiratory virus and detection of virus-infected cells may still be a roadblock for identification of novel pathogens. A culture system which faithfully mimics human airways may alleviate some of these challenges. Therefore, human airway epithelial (HAE) cells were evaluated as a culture system for the initial propagation of a human respiratory virus, followed by visualization of the virus by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and use of a random amplification approach to detect viral sequences. HAE cultures are derived from primary bronchial epithelial cells isolated from the airways of human lung donors or patients undergoing lung transplantation, and have been used extensively to study the biology of respiratory epithelium (Fulcher et al., 2005) . Primary bronchial epithelial cells are harvested from the inner lining of airways and are cultured on porous supports, initially submerged in medium. After the cells grow to form a confluent monolayer, the medium is removed from the apical side, creating an air-liquid interface culture. The primary cells then replicate and differentiate to recapitulate the pseudostatified epithelial morphology found in the human airway. Mature differentiated HAE cultures can be maintained for up to two months and contain mucus-producing goblet cells and non-ciliated and ciliated epithelial cells, which have been shown to be ideal for propagation of a wide range of human respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus (Thompson et al., 2006) , parainfluenza viruses (Zhang et al., 2005) , respiratory syncytial virus (Zhang et al., 2002) , adenovirus (Zhang et al., 2002) , and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Sims et al., 2006) . Propagation of human viral pathogens in clinical specimens on HAE cultures may provide an optimal environment. Therefore, HAE cultures may be useful culturing technique for virus discovery research. To establish proof of principle for this concept, the replication of HCoV-NL63 in HAE cultures was studied.\n\nHCoV-NL63 was identified as a virus that propagated inefficiently in standard cell culture (van der Hoek et al., 2004) . Researchers noted that a clinical specimen obtained from a pediatric patient hospitalized with a respiratory tract infection induced a low level of CPE after 8 days of incubation in a monkey kidney cell line, LLCMK2 cells. Using a novel molecular amplification, van der Hoek and colleagues (2004) were able to amplify, sequence and identify a novel coronavirus, designated HCoV-NL63, as the infectious agent. Interestingly, this virus was also identified in respiratory secretions from children with respiratory symptoms by two additional independent research groups (Esper et al., 2005; Fouchier et al., 2004) . In addition to causing upper respiratory infection, HCoV-NL63 is responsible for croup in children , and is distributed worldwide (Arden et al., 2005; Bastien et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 2005; Vabret et al., 2005) . Identification of HCoV-NL63 has added to knowledge regarding human respiratory viruses, and will allow for development of a diagnostic test and study of potential therapies for this infection.\n\nSurveillance studies of children with respiratory illnesses indicate that in 22-39% of cases no specific etiologic agent is detected (Iwane et al., 2004; Jartti et al., 2004) . It is likely that many human respiratory viruses remain unidentified because they do not propagate efficiently using standard tissue culture cell lines (Allander et al., 2005) . Using HCoV-NL63 a novel variation of virus propagation in HAE cultures followed by visualization of the virus by TEM and identification of the viral genome in culture supernatants using a sequence-independent amplification technique is described.\n\nHCoV-NL63 and LLCMK2 cells were obtained from Dr. Lia van der Hoek (University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The virus was propagated in LLCMK2 cells as previously described (Chen et al., 2007) and cytopathic effect was evident after 5-6 days in culture. Supernatant collected from inoculated cells contained approximately 2-10 TCID 50 per ml.\n\nHuman airway epithelial (HAE) cultures were generated from primary human bronchial epithelial cells (IRB approval number LU#200155) following established procedures (Fulcher et al., 2005) . Cultures were inoculated with 0.2 TCID 50 of HCoV-NL63 and incubated at 33\u00b0C\n\n. Whole mount cultures were fixed for immunofluorescence or TEM studies at the times indicated.\n\nHCoV-NL63 anti-nsp3 antiserum (rabbit) was generated as previously described (Chen et al., 2007) . HAE cultures were infected with 100 uL of HCoV-NL63 virus stock. At 24, 48, and 72 hours post infection cultures were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with the indicated antibody. HAE culture supernatant was recovered in 200 uL of F12 media. Cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 8 minutes at room temperature, and subsequently washed in PBS. To block nonspecific binding, the fixed cells were incubated with histoblock [5% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% teleost gelatin in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20)] for a minimum of 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. HCoV-NL63 anti-nsp3 antisera was diluted 1:1000, and mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b2 tubulin IV (Sigma) was diluted 1:400 in diluent (1:3 dilution of histoblock in PBST), and incubated with fixed cells overnight at 4\u00b0C. Cells were washed three times with diluent at 4\u00b0C with agitation. Anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig heavy and light chain) Alexa Fluor-568 secondary antibody (Invitrogen), and anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig heavy and light chain) Alexa Fluor-488 secondary antibody (Invitrogen) were diluted 1:400 in diluent, and incubated with cells overnight at 4\u00b0C. To detect nuclear DNA cells were stained with DAPI (stock solution at 5 mg/mL) at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cultures were then washed three times with PBST and mounted with PermaFluor mounting medium (Thermo Scientific). Immunofluorescence staining was visualized using a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope at the Loyola University Medical Center Core Imaging Facility.\n\nHAE cultures were fixed at 72 hrs post-infection in 4.0 % glutaraldehyde (0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) overnight at 4\u00b0C and then postfixed with 1.0 % osmium tetroxide for 1 h. Following serial ethanol and propylene oxide dehydration, samples were embedded in EMbed-812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Sectioning and poststaining were performed using standard methods (Bozzola and Russell, 1998) . Samples were examined using a Zeiss EM10 transmission electron microscope operating at 60kv.\n\nApical washes from mock and HCoV-NL63 infected HAE cultures were collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,500 rpm to remove cell debris. The cell free supernatant was treated with 5 U of DNase I enzyme (Ambion) for 45 min at 37\u00b0C. The enzyme was heat inactivated by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mM and incubating the solution for 10 min at 75\u00b0C. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using TransPlex\u00ae Whole Transcriptome Amplification Kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was purified using Wizard\u00ae PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega), cloned into TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen), and transformed into TOP10 E. coli cells (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was isolated, digested with EcoRI (Fermentas), and digested DNA was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel to visualize the size of the inserts. Plasmid DNA positive for insert was sequenced by the University of Chicago Cancer Research Center DNA Sequencing Facility using version 3.0 BigDye GTP sequencing reaction kit (Applied Biosystems).\n\nPrevious studies have shown that HAE cultures can be used to efficiently propagate human respiratory viruses (Sims et al., 2006; Thompson et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2005) . However, it is unclear whether viruses that replicate less efficiently in standard cell culture, such as HCoV-NL63 (Schildgen et al., 2006) , would propagate efficiently in HAE cultures. Therefore, HAE cultures were inoculated with 0.2 TCID 50 of HCoV-NL63 and incubated the cultures at 33\u00b0C for 72 hours. Cultures were then fixed and stained with antiserum directed against replicase product expressed in HCoV-NL63-infected cells (Chen et al., 2007) . HCoV-NL63 replication was detected in the ciliated bronchial epithelial cells in the HAE cultures (Figure 1 ). Cilia were stained with anti-tubulin antibody (green), nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), and HCoV-NL63 was stained with antibodies directed against replicase product nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) (red). HCoV-NL63 replicase protein was detected exclusively in the cytoplasm, with punctate, perinuclear staining evident in discrete foci in the culture. Over a time course of five days, spread of infectious virus was detected by visualizing the broader distribution of the antigen positive cells and by passaging cell-free supernatant to fresh cultures and detecting HCoV-NL63 virus at low titer (10-100 TCID 50 / ml) 48-102 hours post-infection (data not shown). This is in stark contrast to SARS-CoV, which replicates to high titer (10 8 pfu/ml) in both VeroE6 cells and HAE cultures (Sims et al., 2005) . These results indicated that HCoV-NL63 infects productively ciliated cells. In addition, there was minimal apparent cytopathicity observed in the HCoV-NL63-infected HAE cultures. Similar immunofluorescence results were obtained in three independent experiments. Therefore, this HCoV-NL63 model system manifesting low levels of viral replication and virus particle production was ideal to test whether TEM coupled with random amplification of infected cell supernatant could identify a virus that was produced at only low titer in this system.\n\nTo determine if virus particles could be visualized in HCoV-NL63 infected HAE cells, mockinfected and HCoV-NL63-infected HAE cultures were analyzed using TEM. All HAE cultures contained a typical mixture of ciliated and non-ciliated bronchial cells, and mucus-producing goblet cells. The mock-infected HAE cultures did not contain HCoV-NL63 virus particles, and cell degeneration and necrosis was extremely rare (data not shown). In HCoV-NL63-infected cultures, virus particles were readily detected by careful examination of the ciliated cells (Figure 2A-C) . Viral morphogenesis occurred in the apical, supranuclear, Golgi/RER region of the cell cytoplasm. Virus particles, with club-shaped spikes, budded into smooth-walled vesicles ( Figure 3A-B) . The typical HCoV-NL63 spherical virion measured from 75 to 115 nm in size, with surface spikes projecting 10-20 nm from the viral envelope. This observed morphology is consistent with the average 100 nm diameter and 20 nm spikes of other viruses within the Coronaviridae (Lai et al., 2007) . The HCoV-NL63-infected cells ranged from being healthy to necrotic, with shedding of the dead and dying cells from the monolayer (Figure 4 ).\n\nIn the necrotic cells, virus was either free in the cytosol or present within vacuoles. Mature virions were seen \"trapped\" among the cilia in HAE cultures from 2 to 4 days after infection with HCoV-NL63. Collections of virions were seen at the bases of cilia, indicating that they likely had undergone exocytosis recently ( Figure 2C ). These results are consistent with TEM analysis of SARS-CoV replication in HAE cultures (Sims et al., 2005) .\n\nFor virus discovery efforts a random amplification approach was evaluated to determine whether viral nucleic acids could be detected from apical washes collected from infected cells. Apical washes from cells at 48 and 72 hrs post-infection were collected, cell debris was removed, and RNA was isolated from the medium. The RNA was subjected to reversetranscription and amplification using random primers tagged with amplicon sequences as described in Materials and Methods. This approach, termed whole transcriptome amplification (WTA), has been shown to generate an unbiased array of the sequences present in the sample, and has been used for amplification of quasispecies from unpurified influenza virus (Afonso 2007; Nagy et al., 2005) . WTA products generated from RNA isolated from the supernatants of mock-infected or HCoV-NL63-infected cells were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel ( Figure 5A ), which revealed that abundant amplification products were generated from the HCoV-NL63-infected sample. The WTA products were cloned into the TOPO-TA cloning vector, transformed into E. coli and plasmid DNA was isolated and subjected to restriction enzyme digestion to determine the size of inserted sequences. Inserts ranged in size from approximately 50-500 nucleotides ( Figure 5B ), and plasmid DNAs with inserted sequences were subjected to DNA sequencing and NCBI-BLAST analysis. Sequence analysis of randomly isolated clones revealed that 1 out of 63 (1.6%) was of viral origin ( Figure 5C ). Similar to results obtained with WTA, high throughput pyrosequencing of HCoV-NL63 inoculated HAE cultures revealed that approximately 1% of clones were HCoV-NL63 (data not shown). The remaining clones which were identified by BLASTN or TBLASTX analysis represented a variety of human DNA sequences. Subsequent studies indicate that DNase I treatment after RNA isolation reduced cloning of chromosomal DNA sequences although a background of human ribosomal RNA and mRNAs was still detected. Overall, WTA is an effective method for random amplification and detection of viral sequences from supernatant of HAE cultures experiencing low-level viral replication, in a background of cellular sequences.\n\nGiven the uncertainty in choosing an optimal cell line for propagating unknown viral agents, the use of HAE cultures provides an unrivaled environment for the culturing of human respiratory viruses. Furthermore, limitations such as the lack of antibody reagents and minimal cytopathic effect can be circumvented through the use of alternative methods such as transmission electron microscopy and whole transcriptome amplification to identify human respiratory viruses, as we have demonstrated using the model virus, HCoV-NL63. Establishing and validating this method will allow for future screening of acute clinical respiratory secretions from patients suffering from illnesses of unknown etiology. Although HAE cultures are labor intensive to establish, they are a valuable research tool for analysis of human respiratory pathogens. To evaluate clinical respiratory samples the respiratory secretions must be filtered to remove bacteria prior to inoculation of HAE cultures. Preliminary studies using application of filtered clinical samples to HAE cultures have not revealed detrimental effects to the HAE cultures.\n\nThe development of an accurate and rapid method to identify unknown respiratory pathogens is greatly needed, because previous studies have shown that up to 39% of respiratory tract infections have no identifiable causative agent (Iwane et al., 2004; Jartti et al., 2004) . This approach may be useful in investigating the etiology of Kawasaki disease, a potentially fatal childhood illness of unknown etiology that is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed nations. Epidemiologic, immunologic and pathologic data suggest that a pathogen replicating in the respiratory tract is likely responsible for Kawasaki disease (Rowley et al., 2008) . The methods described here may be useful for the identification of elusive human respiratory viruses.\n\nThis study represents a hybrid of cell-based and molecular approaches for human respiratory virus detection. HAE cultures were exploited for propagation of a human respiratory virus, HCoV-NL63, and viral replication was detected using an immunofluorescence assay, TEM analysis and a sequence-independent amplification approach. WTA analysis of HCoV-NL63 inoculated HAE cultures revealed that 1.6% of clones were HCoV-NL63 positive. In comparison, Palacios and colleagues identified viral sequences in 14 out of 103,623 (0.01%) randomly amplified cDNAs generated from a patient who succumbed to an unknown viral illness (Palacios et al., 2008) . Thus, the ability to amplify and isolate virus from supernatants has the advantage of reducing the background of human cellular sequences.\n\nThe successful use of HAE culture in this model system allowed for the first visualization of HCoV-NL63 by TEM, which revealed that HCoV-NL63 has the morphologic features of classic human and non-human coronaviruses: 75-110 nm spherical envelope, 10-20 nm clubshaped spikes, and virion assembly by budding into smooth-walled vesicles. TEM is a powerful tool for the rapid identification of unknown human respiratory viral pathogens as demonstrated by its use in the initial identification of SARS as a member of the Coronaviridae family (Ksiazek et al., 2003) . In summary, experimental demonstration of the use of HAE cultures for the propagation and TEM visualization of human respiratory virus pathogens and sequenceindependent amplification of nucleic acid isolated from the supernatant of the infected cultures to identify specific sequence of the virus has been demonstrated.
