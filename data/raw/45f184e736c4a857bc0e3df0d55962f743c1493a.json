{"title": "Similar ratios of introns to intergenic sequence across animal 1 genomes", "body": "Understanding why genomes vary greatly in size and how organisms make different use their genomes have 26 been central questions in biology for decades [1] . For many bacteria, the majority of the genome is composed 27 of relatively short genes, averaging around 1000bp, and coding for proteins. Indeed, the largest bacterial 28 genome (a myxobacterium) that has been sequenced is only 14 megabases, containing an estimated 11,500 29 genes [2]. However, for eukaryotic organisms, genomes can be over ten-thousand-fold larger than bacterial 30 genomes due to an increase in the number of genes (tens of thousands compared to a few thousand in most 31 bacteria), expansion of the genes themselves due to the addition of introns, and expansion of the sequence 32 between genes. accessions SRR922615 and SRR1024340, derived from whole adult animals. For the lamprey P. marinus, we were unable to find any annotation as GFF or GTF, so we generated including three model organisms (human, mouse, dog), opossum and platypus (for the non-eutherian clades, 217 marsupial and monotreme, respectively) and the chimp, to compare directly to the human annotation. In 218 general, parasites were excluded because they often have unusual biology, such as the single-celled eukaryote 219 T. brucei, which is known for its unusual RNA processing [79, 80] . Generally, we refer to small and large genomes as those below and above 500Mb, respectively. The small-222 est animal genome used in this study is that of the larvacean Oikopleura dioica (70Mb), while the largest is EST training, several different results are expected: some genes are split because internal exons are not require evidence from ESTs or transcriptome sequencing for accurate predictions, and this has implications 244 for our measurements of total exons in each genome. This means that even in a \"perfect\" genome where 245 all coding genes are correctly predicted by an annotation program (perhaps based on similarity to a related 246 species) that the precise positions and amount of UTR may still be unknown, resulting in an underestimation 247 of the amount of exonic sequence (Fig 1A and B) . Because of this, the reliance on coding genes is likely to 248 underestimate the usable fraction of the genome.\n\nTo illustrate this, one may consider a hypothetical eukaryotic genome of 60Mb with 10,000 genes and 251 equal fractions of exons, introns, and intergenic sequence, at 20Mb each. For simplicity, all exons are the 252 same size (in this example, 200bp), so an average gene (with ten-exons) may contain one exon for the 5'-253 UTR, and one for the 3'-UTR, and the remaining eight exons are coding. Based on the above annotation 254 scheme, 20% of the exonic fraction (those containing the 5' and 3'-UTRs) is missing in the final annotation. However, other systematic errors can result in an overestimation of the genic fraction. If we consider mul-261 tiple genes on the same strand, in a head-to-tail arrangement, and recall that UTRs are often not predicted, 262 then an exon containing the stop codon with a 3'-UTR may be omitted and the predicted gene may continue 263 into the next gene ( Fig 1C) . If it is assumed that the majority of coding exons are correctly predicted, then 264 if such predictions were made systematically one may expect that the measured amount of exons does not 265 deviate much from the true exonic fraction. However, because introns are defined as the removed sequence 266 between exons of the same gene, then the sequence between the two genes that should have been defined as 267 intergenic will instead be defined as intronic, thus raising the intron:intergenic ratio above 1. If there is antisense transcription, bases that are antisense to another gene's introns are infact exons themselves, as they are transcribed and not removed by splicing.\n\nUnlike real introns, these bases cannot change without changing the exon on the other strand and are constrained. The base pair must be defined as exon, rather than intron.\n\nThe sum of the regions therefore contains more exon than case A above.\n\nFor average exon length, there would be 6 exons in this example.\n\nIn an arbitrary hypothetical case where two genes on opposite strands are interleaved, that is, exons of one are in the introns of the other one. Almost all base pairs on this scaffold are therefore exons.\n\nFor average length, 10 exons are counted.\n\nGene 2 A w/ antisense ncRNA this \"intron\" is actually \"exon\" If individual exons (or potentially whole genes) were missing, then the measured total exons and introns would be smaller than the real values, and the ratio of intron:intergenic would decrease.\n\nIf neighboring genes were erroneously declared to be contiguous, the exonic fraction is mostly unchanged but the intron:intergenic ratio would increase.

Of the two main sources of problems, repeats [82] and het-271 erozygosity [26, 42, 63, 83] , repeats often result in breaks in the assembly that could split genes (Fig 2A) .\n\nGenes that are split at contig boundaries are likely to have exons missing (or on other scaffolds) and thus 273 the sequence that should be defined as introns would be instead defined as intergenic ( Fig 2B) .\n\nContig2 Contig3\n\nAb initio genes Sum of regions without scaffolding A B Exon Intron Intergenic\n\nAb initio gene\n\nSum of regions on scaffold Unique Figure 2 : Schematic of the effects of scaffolding and repeats on genic fraction analyses (A) For a hypothetical scaffold in a genome assembly, two identical repeats are found within introns. The gene is correctly predicted to span the two repeats and the regions are define below as in Fig 1. (B) For the case without scaffolding, or where the assembler breaks the assembly at repeats (or other high coverage regions), three contigs are generated. Note that the numbers are arbitrary, and in a real assembly they are unlikely to be in order. When annotated, all of the exons are correctly found, but the connections between them are missing for the single exon on Contig 2, resulting in a loss of intronic sequence. The final measured amount of exons is comparable, but the intron:intergenic ratio would decrease.\n\nFor normal diploid genomes (wild strains, not inbred lab strains), heterozygosity is not uniform across 276 the genome. Some regions are identical between the two haplotypes (hence are homozygous alleles or loci), 277 while others may vary by SNPs, short indels, or copy numbers of repeats, exons, or even genes. For sequences 278 that are identical between both haplotypes, the contigs are generally kept as is, while a more complex deci-279 sion must be made for the heterozygous loci. During normal genome assembly, the assembler evaluates the 280 coverage at each \"bubble\" (where the de Brujin graph has two paths out of a node, and both paths merge 281 again at the next node) and ultimately has to retain one of the paths at the exclusion of the other ( Fig 3A) \n\n(also see schematics in [83] and [84] ). This merging is the essential process that creates the reference genome, 283 even though that reference is an arbitrary merge of the two haplotypes. Therefore, it must be kept in mind\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/068627 doi: bioRxiv preprint that predicted genes or proteins in reference genomes may not be identical to either haplotype.\n\nRegions with relatively high heterozygosity may fail to be merged in this way, leaving contigs of both 287 haplotypes in the assembly (Fig 3C) . During subsequent scaffolding steps, contigs of separate haplotypes 288 can be fused head-to-tail if mate pairs are bridging the unique regions. Because this head-to-tail joining is 289 an artifact, no reads should map at the junction point, resulting in a region of zero coverage at the junction 290 and flanked by regions where coverage is half of the expected value ( Fig 3D) . One additional feature may 291 reveal this artifact: exons in the unmerged sections may be individually annotated but mapped ESTs or 292 de novo assembled transcripts may show a staggered exon pattern ( Fig 3E) because transcripts can only 293 map to one of the two possible exons (2a or 2b, 3a or 3b). This may increase the ratio of intron:intergenic 294 sequence ( Fig 3F) , but also falsely indicate that splice variation is more prevalent for this gene. Reference genomes are a mix of the maternal and paternal haplotypes, but not uniformly. Rather than being merged into a single sequence, highly heterozygous regions may be assembled as different contigs that get erroneously fused during scaffolding steps. Mate pairs that bridge the two purple unique regions will instead result in a head-to-tail joining of the two unmerged haplotype sequences. (D) Hypothetical plot of read coverage across the contig. The green arrow shows a region of normal coverage (1x) while the blue arrows show sites where coverage is reduced because reads for each haplotype map separately. At the fusion point between the two haplotypes (red arrow), no reads will map since the sequence is an artifact, or is represented by a gap. (E) Mapped transcripts (or ESTs) or transcripts derived from mapped RNAseq reads (such as by Cufflinks or StringTie) may only be mapped to one of the two haplotypes, thereby producing a staggered exon structure. A mapped transcript can only align to either exon 2a or 2b, but not both, likewise for 3a or 3b, yet all other exons are unique and would align correctly. Genes predicted ab initio may annotate both sets of exons (2a/3a and 2b/3b), which may result in a duplication in some part of the protein, or a premature stop codon if 3a and 2b are out of phase. (F) For this hypothetical case, the sum of the regions would appear to have increased total exon size and the total intron size compared to the same genomic locus where the haplotypes were correctly merged.\n\n.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/068627 doi: bioRxiv preprint Keeping in mind the above error sources, some of the genomes used in our study had obvious problems of 298 too much or too little genic content that would confound our analyses. For instance, the total amount of 299 exons in the JGI annotation of T. adherens (Triad1) was only 14Mb, over twofold lower than the related 300 species, the placozoan H. hongkongensis, and thus it was expected to contain many more or longer genes 301 than were present in the original Triad1 annotation. Because of this, we remade a gene annotation for 302 five of the species (see Methods) and used two additional publicly available annotations for N. vectensis 303 and A. queenslandica. For most species, the reannotation dramatically increased the total amount of exons 304 as well as the total bases of genes (Fig 4) . The only exception was B. floridae, where the original anno-305 tation had predicted 90% of the genome as genes, while the reannotation had annotated only 44.8% as genes. We then compared the ratio of intron:intergenic sequence across seven of the reannotated species (Fig 5) .\n\nAcross these species, reannotation significantly shifted the ratio of intron:intergenic sequence, approaching a 309 1:1 ratio (difference from 1:1 ratio, paired two-end t-test, p-value: 0.014).

A much weaker correlation is observed for exons (R-squared:0.3856, 317 p-value: 10 \u22128 ). Because the total amount of exons in the largest genomes can be several times greater than 318 the total size of the smallest genomes used in the study, a correlation is likely to be observed. Thus, the 319 total amount of exons is necessarily affected by total genome size, even if this is not strongly correlated. Average intron and exon length 322 The average length of introns linearly scales with the total genome size (Fig 7) , in agreement with another 323 study [18] . However, the average exon length is clearly constrained across animals relative to total genome 324 size, and this may be related to interactions with nucleosomes [85] . Most species have an average exon with total genome size (as seen in Fig 6) . However, there is a hyperbolic correlation of the relative fraction of 336 exons (megabases of exons divided by total megabases) compared to total genome size (Fig 8) . The smallest The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/068627 doi: bioRxiv preprint This implies a relatively fixed pool of exons or coding space that becomes spread over the genome as the total 339 size increases. The hyperbolic trend resembled the observed hyperbolic relationship between total genome 340 size and coding proportion [18] . As coding exons are a subset of total exons, measurements of total exons 341 may be a reasonable approximation of coding sequence, but not necessarily vice versa. \n\nBecause both intronic and intergenic fractions displayed a linear correlation to total genome size (Fig 6) , 345 we next examined the connection between the two fractions. While many species have a ratio of in- composed of sequence annotated as intergenic regions (Fig 9) . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Genomes of model organisms are significantly closer to the reference line 354 (two-tailed t-test, p-value: < 10 \u22127 for either absolute distance from 1:1 reference or absolute difference of 355 intron:intergenic ratio to 1), suggesting that the better annotations of model organisms predict a ratio of 356 1:1 of intron:intergenic sequence. Overall, the comparison of genomes of model to non-model organisms is 357 compatible with the hypothesis that the predicted amount of the genome that is transcribed varies more by 358 annotation quality than biological differences.\n\nWe then examined if there is a difference between genomes of vertebrates and invertebrates. No sig-361 nificance difference is observed between the two model invertebrates and five vertebrates (two-tailed t-test, Evolution of the genic fraction 381 The amount of the genome that is composed of genes was highly variable across the genomes in our study, 382 ranging from 12.5% up to 87.1% of the genome. Unlike the exonic fraction, the relationship of the fraction 383 of the genome that is genes to the total size is less obvious (Fig 11) , in part because this parameter is 384 most subject to gene annotation accuracy. The fraction of the genome that is exons (and perhaps coding) 385 appeared relatively fixed (Fig 8) , yet the intron size was linearly correlated to the total size (Fig 6) , therefore 386 the fraction that is genes (exons and introns combined) was expected to be a combination of the two trends.\n\nThree correlation models were tested: hyperbolic (double-log), exponential (single-log), and linear. Of these, 388 the hyperbolic model fit best (R-square: 0.3649, p-value: < 10 \u22128 ), and no correlation was found for the other 389 models. Restricting the linear model to only genomes larger than 500Mb found essentially no correlation 390 (R-squared: 2.5 * 10 \u22124 ), suggesting that the genic fraction is unrelated to total genome size in large genomes 391 but not in small genomes. p-value=0.0058; exponential R-squared=0.6709; linear R-squared=0.6835). Rather than simply having no 398 correlation to total size, these results suggest that the genic fraction is fixed at around 50% in large genomes. Figure 11 : Genic fraction compared to total genome size Relative fraction of the genome that is defined as genes compared as a function of total size. A number of correlative models (hyperbolic in purple, exponential in blue, linear in orange) were tested and coefficients are displayed. Linear correlation is expected to be zero if genic and intergenic fractions \"expand\" indifferently after a certain size, which appears to be around 500Mb. Linear correlation including only genomes larger than 500Mb is also displayed as the green line. Seven model organisms (as in Fig 8) are indicated by three-letter codes and yellow stars. The hyperbolic correlation model for the seven model organisms is shown in red. The formulae for the fitted models are displayed in red and purple, for model organisms and all organisms, respectively.\n\n.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/068627 doi: bioRxiv preprint Diagnostic relationship of introns to intergenic sequence 402 An increasing number of genomes of any non-model organisms are sequenced to answer evolutionary questions. For example, genomes of taxa from all four non-bilaterian groups were recently sequenced to under-of the genome is genic; exons comprise an almost negligible fraction of the genome, which is otherwise 502 composed of approximately equal fractions of introns and intergenic sequences. This might be explained by 503 changes in diversity of transposable elements, as the highest diversity was found in genomes ranging from 504 500Mb to 1.5Gb [17] . Larger genomes appeared to be flooded by transposable elements of a single type. 505 Thus, above 500Mb, it can be predicted that select transposable elements become prevalent and multiply 506 throughout the genome, but on average end up expanding introns and intergenic sequences equally.\n\nRelationship to phenotypic complexity 509 The size of the genome can vary greatly even for closely related organisms. This has been called the \"c-value 510 paradox\" [1, 99] , based on the observation that although the many organisms have larger genomes relative to 511 similar species (bigger \"c-value\"), this measurement does not equate with more or less complex organisms in 512 a straightforward way. A classic example of this is frog genus Xenopus, where the genome of the species X. 513 laevis is almost twice as large as the species X. tropicalis [100] , though the animal is not twice as \"complex\". Vertebrates and specifically mammals tend to splice transcripts more than invertebrates (meaning models 521 fruit fly and nematode) [103, 104] . One study reported a good correlation (R-squared of 0.80) of splicing to 522 organismic complexity measured by cell types [105] , but also reported that this trend effectively disappeared 523 when correcting for sequencing depth, using the number of ESTs available as a proxy for annotation quality. 524 The largest invertebrate genome used in that study was the deer tick I. scapularis, which did have a mea-525 sured number of cell types but unfortunately could not be analyzed further, leaving the bulk of the analysis 526 weighted heavily by mammals and small-genome insects. \n\nIn our reannotation we found only 6.4% of all loci have any type of splice variant. However, the majority 534 of predicted transcripts (75%) are single exon loci, and possibly many genes are fragmented across multiple 535 contigs (as in Figure 2 ). When restricted to loci with multiple exons (15% of total loci), 41% have more than 536 one variant. These data from O. bimaculoides suggested that overall patterns in splicing do not display a 537 reliable connection to organismic complexity when complexity is generalized across animal groups. However, 538 without proper measurements of cell types from the octopus, it cannot be assumed that the number of cell It is a challenge to separate these observations from biases in sequencing depth (of transcripts or ESTs) 545 and data availability. In our study, we could only make use of five invertebrates with relatively large genomes, 546 the cnidarian H. magnipapillata, the pearl oyster P. fucata, the horseshoe crab L. polyphemus, the deer tick 547 I. scapularis, and the octopus O. bimaculoides. On the other hand, NCBI has over 100 genomes of mammals 548 available for download. Alternatively, the repertoire of splice factors or the genes that are most spliced may 549 be of greater importance than just splicing in general. Our understanding is likely to be improved with more there may not be any \"large\" genomes in this phylum, and likewise for other invertebrate groups. Compared 562 to birds, however, where the smallest genome identified to date is from the black-chinned hummingbird 563 (estimated 910Mb) [109], perhaps no bird will be found that has a \"small\" genome. were all functional, then the genic fraction of the genome would be far above 50% for large genomes and 573 the ratio of intron:intergenic sequence would not be expected to be close to 1:1. Alternatively, if most of 574 these intergenic transcripts are non-functional \"noise\", then our results are supported as presented. There-575 fore, consideration of the importance or genic quality rests upon the distinction between functional RNAs 576 and noisy transcription. Existing data are not adequate to identify functions, but several experiments may 577 improve our understanding. Conceptually, the most straightforward approach is knocking out regions of 578 transcribed \"gene deserts\" in mouse or human cells, but on a larger scale than a previous study [113] . Ad-579 ditionally, better models of transcriptional noise or random transcription may inform whether or not the 580 observed transcriptional patterns from the ENCODE project are consistent with noise. We have shown that a set of animals from 12 phyla transcribe at least half of their genomes in a size-584 dependent fashion. For large genomes, the amount of exons is almost negligible, where introns account for 585 most of the genic sequence. In such cases, genic sequence is almost equal to the amount of intergenic sequence.\n\nWhereas for small genomes, exons can be a major fraction of the genome, resulting in the appearance of 587 gene-dense genomes. This parity between introns and intergenic sequence is likely a universal feature of 588 animal genomes, though this may be tested with addition of many more animal taxa from other phyla that 589 do not have sequenced members. Previous findings of genomic differences between animal groups are likely 590 to result from a sampling bias, rather than biological differences.
