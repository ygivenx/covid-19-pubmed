{"title": "Evaluation of a novel real-time RT-PCR using TOCE technology compared with culture and Seeplex RV15 for simultaneous detection of respiratory viruses", "body": "Respiratory viral infections are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. The rapid and accurate identification of viral etiology is critical in ruling out non-viral infections, initiating timely therapeutic interventions and limiting the spread of infections. [1] [2] [3] Diagnoses of viral respiratory tract infections have been made generally by culture-based methods using cell culture and/or detection of antigens. Although these methods are effective and often complementary, they do have some disadvantages. 4 Cell culture, which has been considered the \"gold standard\", takes time, and detection of antigens often lacks sensitivity or specificity. 5 Even when these methods are applied simultaneously, some samples are still found negative despite clinical evidence of a viral respiratory infection. 4 Molecular techniques offer quicker turn-around times, greater analytical sensitivity, and allow identification of strains that are difficult to culture using standard methods in clinical laboratories. 6 Especially, multiplexed RT-PCR enabled laboratorians to detect a panel of viruses simultaneously while maintaining excellent sensitivity and specificity. 3, 7, 8 Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of multiplex PCR including Seeplex \u00ae RV15 ACE detection [RV15] (Seegene, Seoul, Korea), which achieved approval from CE (2009), Health Canada (2011), and KFDA (2013), being sold in more than 20 countries in Europe, Canada and Asia. 6, [9] [10] [11] [12] Recently, Anyplex TM II RV16 [RV16] with Tagging Oligonucleotide Cleavage and Extension (TOCE) technology (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) has been developed. TOCE assay is a novel approach to real-time PCR, using the two components, 'pitcher' and 'catcher'. 13 Through target bound pitcher, TOCE assay moves the detection point from the target sequence to the catcher, enabling predictable analysis of melting temperature for catcher duplex and offering multiplex real-time PCR capability to RV16. 13 \n\nWe compared the new multiplex RT-PCR, RV16 with wellknown RV15 and culture by determining their sensitivity and specificity.\n\nFrom October 2011 to May 2012, 730 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples (each NPA from each patient) were consecutively collected from 730 patients with acute respiratory infection at the Korea University Anam Hospital, Seoul, Korea. All of our samples (flocked nasopharyngeal swabs) had been transported in 3 mL of UTM (COPAN, Murrieta, CA, USA) and were freshly used for virus culture, Seeplex \u00ae RV15 assay and Anyplex TM II RV16 assay (Seegene, Korea). This study was approved by the Research ethics board of the Korea University Anam Hospital for patients.\n\nFrozenFreshCell R-Mix Too cells (Diagnostic HYBRIDS, Athens, Ohio) were provided as cryovials shipped on dry ice. According to the manufacturer's instructions, the thawed cells were diluted in planting medium and delivered into 24 well plates. Then, two hundred microliters of specimen were then inoculated and the plates were centrifuged. After overnight incubation, cell monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with acetone, and stained with a respiratory virus fluorescent antibody pool, D3 DFA (Diagnostic HYBRIDS, Athens, Ohio). When virusspecific fluorescence was noted, virus identification was performed by using Diagnostics HYBRIDS' individual monoclonal antibodies. The presence of three or more cells per well with specific applegreen fluorescence was considered positive identification. When the initial screen was negative, the second vial was examined at day 3.\n\nNucleic acids were extracted from 500 l of NPA samples using a MICROLAB Nimbus IVD (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) with STARMag 96 Virus Kit (Seegene, Korea) and eluted in 100 l of elution buffer. cDNA synthesis was carried out with RevertAid TM Firtst Strand cDNA sysnthesis kit (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer's suggested methods. The samples are tested with Respiratory Virus Detection Kit-A, B, and C (Seeplex \u00ae RV15 ACE detection kit; Seegene, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To detect amplification products was coupled with capillary electrophoresis technology (Lab901Screen Tape system; Lab901 Ltd, Loanhead, UK).\n\nRNAs were extracted from 500 l of NPA samples with addition of 10 l of bacteriophage MS2 as an internal control (Anyplex TM II RV16 detection, Seegene) using a MICROLAB Nimbus IVD (Hamilton, USA) with STARMag 96 Virus Kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). Automated protocol for extraction, RT-PCR and PCR setup was implemented using Nimbus automated liquid handling workstation to maximize the workflow and accuracy.\n\nThe internal control added to each specimen works as an exogenous control to check the whole process from nucleic acid extraction to RT-PCR. cDNA synthesis was performed with cDNA synthesis Auto mix (Seegene, Korea) from extracted RNAs. Respiratory Virus Detection Kit-A and B (Anyplex TM II RV16 detection; Seegene, Korea) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, TOCE assay 13 was conducted in the final volume of 20 l using a real-time thermocycler CFX96 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). After reaction, Catcher Melting Temperature Analysis (CMTA) 15 was performed by cooling the reaction mixture to 55 \u2022 C, holding at 55 \u2022 C for 30 s, heating from 55 \u2022 C to 85 \u2022 C. The fluorescence was measured continuously during the temperature rise, while the melting peaks were derived from the initial fluorescence (F) versus temperature (T) curves.\n\nPerformance of each assay was determined against a composite reference standard. 12 As for uncultivable viruses, we compared RV16 and RV15. If the results between RV16 and RV15 were concordant, they were considered to be a true positive without sequencing. However, if the results between RV16 and RV15 were discrepant, singleplex PCR and sequencing with specific primers was performed as a confirmatory test. The main outcomes of this study were the sensitivity and specificity of culture and RV16 and RV15 assay. All analyses were performed using SPSS (version 20.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). (Table 1 ). In our study, RSV A and rhinoviruses were the viruses most commonly associated with multiple agent infection, followed by adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and coronavirus (Table 1 ). In our study, two (100%) of two quadruple viruses infected specimens were detected by RV16 assay only, while 9 (45%) of 20 triple viruses infected specimens were detected by RV16 alone. The results remained the same at repeated tests, singleplex PCR, and confirmatory sequencing analysis. Table 1 shows the overall distribution of respiratory viral pathogens, indicating the predominance of influenza viruses, RSV and HRV. It also shows that coronavirus, metapneumovirus and adenovirus accounted for about 13.1% (63/482), 10.4% (50/482) and 12.7% (61/482) respectively, followed by enterovirus and bocavirus at around 2.3% (11/482) and 4.4% (21/482). \n\nIn this study, we evaluated the performance of the novel RV16 assay with those of RV15 assay and viral culture. RV16 and RV15 assays offered good sensitivities (79.5-100%) for the detection of common respiratory viral agents (influenza A or B, PIV 1-3, RSVA or B), while viral culture showed low sensitivities (45.8-69.2%). As for adenovirus, the RV16 assay showed superior sensitivity to RV15 (98.4% vs. 52.4), while viral culture demonstrated low sensitivity (23.0%). In our study, twenty-eight ADV-positive specimens were detected by RV16 alone. A confirmatory sequencing demonstrated that nineteen, six, two and one specimens were adenovirus C, B, F (41) and D type, respectively. In a previous study, through evaluating the four commercial multiplex PCR assays, the performance for adenovirus was not as good as the other viruses, assuming due to various serologic types of adenovirus. 12 In addition, the molecular assays detected viral pathogens from culture negative 282 (39%) samples. The overall detection rate in our study was similar to those in the previous reports. As for RV15, a Chinese study based on 164 nasopharyngeal swab presented the detection rate of 78.7% for all target respiratory viruses, 9 while a Canadian study based on 750 nasopharyngeal swabs showed the detection rate of 66.9%. 12 As for Seegene RV12, a Korean study performed on 101 respiratory specimen from 92 patients showed the detection rate of 75.2% for all target respiratory viruses, 3 while other Canadian study using 231 nasopharyngeal specimen demonstrated 69.8%. 6 Viral culture has limited ability to detect some viruses. 16 Rhinovirus is difficult to detect by viral culture due to its diversity of serotypes. In our study, only RV16 and RV15 detected 125 rhinoviruses (24%) from 529 culture negative samples. Although MPV causes a lower respiratory disease similar to that caused by RSV, 17 it is difficult to detect MPV by cell culture due to its selective, 6, [10] [11] [12] Given that the coronavirus and human bocavirus are recently discovered, and detected worldwide and sometimes associated with severe respiratory illness, RV16 will be helpful to take care of the patients who have previously had the undefined or fatal respiratory illness. 16, [18] [19] [20] The advantage of the PCR-based assay was detecting coinfections which are usually missed by viral culture. 6 In the literature, the detection rate of multiple infections by multiplex PCR assay ranged from 5% to 40%. 3, 6, 9, 12, 16 Whereas, similar to our study results, Gharabaghi et al. using multiplex PCR reported two, three and four viruses-infected specimens as 15.3, 0.8 and 0.2% of total respiratory specimens, respectively. Although the role of multiple viral agents in affecting the clinical course of disease is at present unknown, multiple agents may be clinically significant, especially in immune compromised individuals. 12 RV16 assay would provide clinicians with better infectious status of patients than RV15 or culture, resulting in the more effective prevention of such multiple infections.\n\nRecently, Kim et al. compared the performance of RV16, RV15, and Xtag, 21 which showed similar sensitivities for RV16 and RV15 to ours for almost all target viruses. But they reported about 10% lower sensitivity of RV16 and RV15 for rhinovirus compared to ours. This might be caused by use of xTAG with good performance for rhinovirus as an arbitrator. As for influenza B, RV16 and RV15 sensitivity (97.1% and 97.1%, respectively) by Kim et al. were higher than those in our study (89.7% and 79.5%, respectively). 21 In our study, three cases of influenza B, which were culture positive and the molecular assays negative, were detected. These seem to make such difference in sensitivities of influenza B. A case of 2009 H1N1 influenza positive by culture and negative by the ProFlu+ assay (Gen-Probe Prodesse, Inc., Waukesha, WI) was reported. 22 Two site mismatches were found later between the probe used and target sequence. Such kind of mismatch might have happened in our influenza B cases.\n\nWhile the market price of RV16 is as same as that of RV15 in this country, RV16 compared with RV15, marked technical advancements was made with introduction of TOCE and CMTA. [13] [14] [15] TOCE bypassed the need to directly measure the target, employing an artificial template of defined and predictable T m , the Catcher. 13 Because the sequence of the Catcher is defined during assay design, the resulting Duplex Catcher will yield a distinct and predictable melting profile in melting temperature analysis, referred as CMTA. Thereby, TOCE and CMTA system can stably detect multiple targets in a single channel and furthermore increase the number of targets up to 8 in a single tube.\n\nA major challenge of several multiplex RT-PCR systems is the quantification of multiple viral targets in a reaction tube. 15 Very recently repeated melting temperature analysis, named cyclic-CMTA was introduced. 15 The upgraded version of RV16 with cyclic-CMTA comes to quantify multiple viral targets by repeating melting curve analysis at three preselected cycles. 15 A limitation to RV15 system is its internal control facility. The artificial targets included in each PCR mastermix allow validation only of the PCR step. 10 As for RV16, the addition of bacteriophage MS2 to each extraction allows the RT-PCR system to monitor both the RNA extraction and the reverse transcription step.\n\nIn conclusion, RV15 and the novel RV16 assay increased the sensitivity of detection of respiratory viruses by 38.1% over viral culture, while maintaining excellent specificity. The new multiplex PCR assay was superior to RV15 for detection of most of 16 viral targets, including multiple infections. In this era of emerging viral infections, RV16 assay will be beneficial in determining patient management and public health epidemiology."}
