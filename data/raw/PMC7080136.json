{"title": "Chapter 9. Educational process", "body": "The mortality of a pandemic due to a highly pathogenic influenza such as H1NI or H5N1 will ultimately be determined by the interaction of viral factors such as pathogenicity, infectivity and resistance to antivirals, patient factors such as age, immune status and genetic profile, and therapeutic factors such as the quality of health care services, the availability of intensive care units (ICUs), antivirals and, most importantly, vaccines. The quality of health services will depend upon appropriate preparation as well as the availability of a national protocol [1, 2] and an informed and committed staff complement both at an administrative and clinical level. Current ICU staff and critical care infrastructure will be inadequate for the expected influx of patients even in the best equipped hospitals. Calculations in the UK estimate that there will potentially be ten times as many patients requiring mechanical ventilation as the number of beds available, and the mortality and the need for specialized care will be that much greater in developing countries where resources are most constrained [3].\n\nStaff availability must be maximized. With proper prior education, more staff will be available. More will avoid falling ill, will feel more confident that everything possible had been done to ensure their safety and more will perceive that it is their ethical duty to remain at work. In addition, each hospital will have to formulate a triage plan prior to the onset of a disaster or pandemic that should take into account local resources in terms of staff, space and equipment, and this plan will have to be taught and communicated to the appropriate hospital staff (See Chap. 7, Critical care triage). Mass care facilities in close proximity to the triage area must be planned and staff trained as to where these will be and how these areas should be managed (see Chap. 2, Surge capacity and infrastructure considerations). Changing areas have to be provided external to the treatment area where appropriate protective gear can be donned and removed (see Chap. 6, Protection of patients and staff). All staff must be aware of the designated areas allocated for management of ICU patients and must be trained in procedures best designed to contain the infection by the use of a standard management guide. Relevant ethical issues must also be discussed and explored prior to a pandemic. These include issues such as triage, admission and discharge criteria and absenteeism, all of which should be addressed, written down and agreed to, so that each staff member understands in advance the choices that will have to be made. Decision makers and the public should engage in these discussions in order that ethical decisions reflect what most people will accept as fair and good for public health.\n\n\nTo identify specific areas requiring training and education in each hospital. These include:\nProcedures that are high risk for disease transmissionThe use of personal protective equipmentThe use of equipment by staff not usually involved in ICU practiceThe handling and management of specimensTransport of patients in and out of ICU\nTo identify the staff that require training in the performance of these proceduresTo ensure that a command structure is established that is aware of and trained in crisis management proceduresTo train all staff as to the nature of the command structure\n\n\nThe key elements of training and education preceding an influenza pandemic are the following:The disease and its implications for hospitals and staffOccupational health of staffPre-ICU triageProfessional responsibilities of currently available staff and of those delegated to assist ICU staff when redeployedTraining with regard to medical management of patientsEthical responsibilitiesCase reporting (for influenza pandemic surveillance and response purposes)Psychological support for patients and relativesVisiting restriction policies\n\n\n\nCurrent hospital capacity will be exceeded in terms of currently trained staff, equipment and space.There is a need to increase capacity appropriate to anticipated demand.Routine procedures and transport of patients out of the ICU can result in disease transmission.High-risk procedures will be limited to those that are absolutely necessary.Transport and movement of patients should be restricted according to developed protocols.Education and training will reduce disease transmission.\n\n\n\nHospital Emergency Executive Control Group (HEECG): A central hospital operations center with executive responsibility for the overall management of the crisis within the hospital.ICU Emergency Executive Control Group (ICUEECG): An ICU operations center with executive responsibility for the overall management of the crisis within the ICU. This group or its representatives should have direct access to the HEECG.Triage Officer: Senior intensivist chosen from the ICU staff who has demonstrated leadership and communication skills.Doctors: overall responsibility for ICU services should fall to the ICU director, other intensivists, intensive care trainees and doctors recruited to help care for the critically ill.Nurses: Overall responsibility should fall to the ICU charge nurse, and training in ICU procedures should fall to the nurse educator. Observation of ICU nurses by recruits prior to the event would be invaluable as an introduction to the basic duties of the ICU nurse.Training and education is the overall responsibility of the HEECG who should delegate this to those most knowledgeable in each specific sphere: infection control, medical management, triage, occupational health, etc.\n\n\nTraining should begin as soon as possible followed by supervised simulations to ensure optimal use of available facilities and to minimize infection [4]. PP techniques and reduction of environmental contamination should preferably be taught by infection control staff with assistance from ICU directors [5]. Interventions aimed at changing clinical practice show that outreach visits, posted reminders, interactive educational meetings and other multifaceted interventions are effective, but in the event of a pandemic, time constraints and potential lethality of the disease may be limiting factors [6]. Seminars, on-site demonstrations, problem-based learning and simulations are valuable when time is of the essence. In the SARS epidemic, use of a simulator allowed effective training of 275 workers in 2 weeks [7\u20139].\n\nTeleconferencing involving clinicians and representatives from public health, infection control, infectious diseases, hospital administration and government together with website dissemination of instructional materials is useful to update knowledge during a pandemic [10\u201312]. A curriculum is available from the European Network of Infectious Disease to use as a guide for staff training [13].\n\nKnowledge and compliance with PP protocols are poor, and consequently knowledge should be re-evaluated frequently [14]. Although an element of coercion is frequently necessary [15, 16], reasons for poor compliance should be addressed. These include availability of appropriate equipment, quality of leadership and an organizational culture that promotes safety [17]. These factors also reduce psychological stress by inspiring confidence [18].\n\nEducation must involve all current ICU staff: those selected to be recruited to the ICU or who will be performing critical care tasks outside of the ICU and those who are responsible for triage. Education should be planned to take place on an ongoing basis and involve all staff for certain activities and specific training sessions for specialized operations. Staff that are to be co-opted must be identified early and taught practices specific to their new roles. The administration should identify the staff to participate in training programs, verify that they have participated and evaluate their knowledge frequently.\n\n\nAdministrative Staff (ICU and Hospital Emergency Executive Control Groups): should be trained with regard to:\n\nThe disease and its implications for the hospital and staffThe development and dissemination of protocols for pre-ICU triageSourcing of guidelines for the management of a pandemicOccupational health issuesSourcing of and ensuring uninterrupted access to vaccines (seasonal and pandemic), antivirals, personal protective equipment (PPE), antibiotics, ventilators, etc.Identifying where additional staff may be sourced from and where and how they should be trained to fulfill their new dutiesProvision of areas in which patients will be managed and the training of staff to prepare these areas\nAll staff must be trained with regard to:\n\nThe disease and its implications for hospitals and staffInfection prevention and controlPre-ICU triageProfessional responsibilities of currently available staff and those delegated to assist ICU staffEthical responsibilities including responses to unjustified absenteeism\nEmergency department staff must be trained and educated in:\n\nTriage protocolsTreatment strategies for those deemed to be well enough for outpatient therapy and initial therapy for those that are admitted\nICU doctors and nurses:\nMust be aware of triage and treatment protocols (see Appendix)Admission and discharge policiesMedical managementVisiting policiesInfection control practices specific to the ICU\n\n\n\n\nStaff structure capable of expansionPharmaceutical servicesLaboratory servicesLinen and washing servicesInfection Control servicesInfrastructural supportEquipment suppliesTraining materials (trainers\u2019 guidelines and tools)\n\n\n\nTraining programs must be initiated as soon as possible and knowledge evaluated regularly.Education and training should be an ongoing process and ICUs should participate in unit-specific exercises to maintain competence in specific areas.SOP should be reviewed annually for revision and update by the ICU and Hospital Emergency Executive Control Groups.\n\n\n\nStaff must be taught: [19, 20].Correct personal hygiene (hand washing, avoid touching the face, eyes or masks, unprotected coughing and kissing on greeting)The use of N95 masks such that there is a proper facial seal [it is advisable that facial hair is removed. If staff cannot comply because of religious reasons they should be restricted from direct contact with infected patients unless appropriate full face high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtered masks are available]. These should be changed whenever exiting the treatment area.How to don and remove gowns, disposable gloves and protective glasses so that there is maximal protection and minimal exposureProper disposal of clothing and any other contaminated itemsMonitoring of staff health: temperature monitoring twice daily and what to do if a staff member becomes ill\n\n\n\nStaff must be trained in and protocols developed for:Drug treatment [22]: The use of anti-viral medications must be taught with reference to:\nThe medications availableDose and timing of treatment (unit-specific policies should be developed)Prophylaxis (whether prophylactic therapy will be provided and the type of therapy that will be available must be pre-determined by virologists and medical staff according to availability and practicality prior to the pandemic and these decisions must be communicated to all staff)The priorities for use of anti-viral medications\nVentilation [23]\nBasic respiratory supporti.Non-invasive ventilation,ii.Mechanical ventilation (see Appendix)\nRescue strategies\nVaccination [5, 24, 25]\n\n\nThere is frequently a reluctance to utilize both seasonal and pandemic vaccines. All staff must be educated regarding the necessity for vaccines to protect both themselves and those that they are in contact with. As many people as possible must be vaccinated as quickly as possible as soon as a vaccine is available. There are five initial target groups for vaccination efforts (pregnant women, persons who live with or provide care for infants aged <6 months, health care and emergency medical services personnel, children and young adults aged 6 months to 24 years and persons aged 25\u201364 years who have medical conditions that put them at higher risk for influenza-related complications). Subsets within the initial target groups in the event that initial vaccine availability is unable to meet demand must be identified along with guidance on the use of vaccine in other adult population groups as vaccine availability increases.

Management of laboratory specimens must be pre-planned in cooperation with the laboratory. Constant and ongoing communication with laboratory staff is vital, and channels of communication must be established early.\n\nIt is recommended that a list of specific signs indicating clinical deterioration be established and clearly displayed, indicating specific warning signs that necessitate transfer to a high-care area.\n\n\nNon-ICU staff must be allocated specific tasks that are within their capacity. Complete syllabi are available [10]. Tasks should be assigned and taught according to need. Ability to record blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, oxygenation, fluid intake and output, suctioning and attention to pressure sites are a minimum requirement. Palliative care and monitoring of noninvasive and mechanical ventilation should be considered.Recruits should also be trained to institute a nutritional program.Some staff should be able to care for patients receiving non-invasive and mechanical ventilation with particular attention to the FAST HUG (Feeding; Analgesia and Sedation; Head up; Ulcer prophylaxis; Glycemic control) [27] protocols plus suctioning and attention to pressure sites.\n\n\n\nIndividual liberty and autonomy: In a public health crisis, restrictions to individual liberties and autonomy may be necessary to protect the public from serious harm. This includes quarantines, duty hours, restricted access of staff to their families, visiting restrictions, etc.Duty to provide: Providers will have to weigh demands of their professional roles against other competing obligations to their own health and to family and friends. Moreover, health care workers will face significant challenges related to resource allocation, scope of practice, professional liability and workplace conditions. These codes or statements should cover such issues as:How much risk should health care workers be required to take;Their duty to care for the sick and to care for themselves so they can continue to provide care; andTheir duty not to harm others by transmitting disease.\nInstruction in triage procedures for allocating scarce resources (including treatment protocols, nonbeneficial treatment, allocation of vaccines and antiviral medicines, ventilators and intensive care) [29\u201331].\n\n\n\nStaff should understand and be taught to deal with stressors related to pandemic influenza:Signs of distress;Traumatic grief;Psychosocial aspects related to the management of mass fatalities;Stress management and coping strategies;Strategies for building and sustaining personal resilience;Behavioral and psychological support resources;Strategies for helping children and families in times of crisis; andCritical incident stress debriefings.\n\n\n\nProtocols to remove corpses rapidly must be developed and specific staff allocated to this task. This will require liaisoning with mortuary staff, and sufficient space must be provided for this purpose; otherwise this could represent an important bottleneck.\n\nPolicies must be in place such that staff is aware of how to manage visitors and what restrictions will be in place. This overlaps with ethical issues as in a high mortality pandemic it will be necessary to separate families and to restrict access to loved ones in the interests of staff safety and society as a whole.\n\nEducational materials to reduce community spread should be available for distribution to all that enter the hospital. Plentiful material is available on the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/H1N1FLU/) and WHO (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/en/) websites. The public should also be informed that usual treatments may be impossible to deliver and treatments may have to be triaged, but this should be communicated without creating unnecessary panic."}
