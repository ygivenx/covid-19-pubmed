{"title": "Antibody responses against SARS-coronavirus and its nucleocaspid in SARS patients", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first reported in Guangdong Province, China in November 2002 followed by spread to more than 30 countries worldwide (Lee et al., 2003) . A newly isolated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was found to be the etiological agent of SARS (Drosten et al., 2003) , and the genome of the virus was soon sequenced (Marra et al., 2003) . The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV have subsequently been pursued in several laboratories. It is of great importance to identify the characteristics of host antibodies against SARS virus and its components, to aid in vaccine development and diagnosis of the viral infection (Chen et al., 2004; Li et al., 2003) . * Corresponding author.

Serial serum samples were collected at 7-210 days after the onset of symptoms, and were subjected to antibody analysis. Anti-viral antibodies (IgG, IgM) were assayed by indirect fluorescence (IF) kits developed by Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology and approved by State Drugs Administration of China (Si et al., 2003) . 20 l diluted sera (1:20 or greater dilution) were added onto slides containing monolayers of SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells and non-infected Vero cells as a negative control. The slides were incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 30 min, washed three times with PBS (phosphate buffered saline), and then FITC-labeled anti-human IgG or FITC-labeled anti-human IgM were added for 30 min. The slides were washed as before, and fluorescence was detected with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope. The dilution for cut off is 1:20. Anti-nucleocaspid (N protein, NP) total Ig was assayed by an antigen-capturing ELISA (AC-ELISA) co-developed by Sina-American Biotechnology Co. Ltd. and Beijing Institute of Biotechnology (Shi et al., 2003) . For this assay, 100 l of serum samples were added to wells coated with recombinant N protein, the plate was incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 30 min, and then washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. 100 l HRP (Horse radish peroxidase)-conjugated N protein was added and the plate was incubated for another 30 min followed by washing as above. Then 100 l of TMB substrate solution (0.1 mg/ml tetramethylbenzidine hydrochloride, 0.01% H 2 O 2 in 0.1 M acetate buffer pH 5.8) was added and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 20 min, The reaction was terminated by adding 50 l 2 N sulfuric acid and the absorbance at 450 nm was determined. The maximum dilution of the serum at which a positive signal was obtained (IFA), or an absorbance at 450 nm wavelength greater than 0.15 (cutoff value) was given, was defined as antibody titer. The data were analyzed by SPSS11.0 software and the geometric means of seropositive samples were employed in all statistics.\n\nNeutralization antibody was assayed by the following protocol: 1 ml diluted serum was mixed with 1 ml DMEM medium containing 2 \u00d7 10 6 SARS-CoV (strain BJ-1) virus, and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h in a water-bath. Then the mixture was aliquotted to 8 wells (200 l each) of Vero E6 cell monolayers grown in 96-well microtiter plates. The plate was incubated at 37 \u2022 C, 5% CO 2 for 7 days. The highest dilution of the serum at which 50% of the wells were protected from viral cytopathic effect was considered to be the neutralizing titer.\n\nSeroconversion was observed in 13 of the 14 patients either by anti-viral IgG (FIA) or by antigen capturing anti-N protein assay by 14 days after the onset of the symptoms. In contrast, anti-viral IgM was detectable only in 10 patients by14 days, and in 13 patients by 30 days after the onset of the symptoms. By comparison, anti-viral IgG and anti-N protein antibodies were detected in all the patients from 30 to 210 days after the onset of the symptoms. Antiviral IgM was shown to be negative in 4, 8, 12 and all 14 patients by day 60,120,180 and 210 days post disease onset, respectively. These results may indicate that antiviral IgG may correlate better with viral neutralization. Also, the recombinant nucleocaspid protein based antigen-capturing ELISA was at least as sensitive as the anti-viral IgG(IFA) assay.\n\nAnti-viral IgG and anti-Nucleocaspid antibodies were detectable earlier than anti-viral IgM antibodies, and the highest antibody titer was reached at 120 days (anti-viral IgG) and 180 days (anti-N protein) after the onset of the symptoms. The titer decreased slowly after that time point, and high titers of antibodies were observed in all patients 210 days after the onset of symptoms. Geometric mean values of the antibodies were shown in Fig. 1 . In contrast, a significantly lower titer of anti-viral IgM antibody was found with a peak titer at 30 days. Moreover, anti-viral IgM could not be detected in any of the 14 patients 210 days after the onset of the symptoms.\n\nTo understand potential viral neutralization in convalescent patients against the infection by the virus, neutralizing antibodies were assayed in six convalescent patient's sera collected 20, 30, 60, 120, and 210 days after the onset of symptoms. It was found that, in all six patients, neutralizing antibodies were detected. The geometric means of the neutralization titers on day 20, 30, 60, 120 and 210 was 1:150, 1:475, 1:400, 1:200 and 1:200, respectively. These data indicate that viral neutralization is a feature of SARS infection, and the duration of the viral neutralization is greater than 7 months."}
