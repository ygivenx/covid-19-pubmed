{"title": "Title: An Augmented Aging Process in Brain White Matter in HIV", "body": "Advanced age is a major risk factor for cognitive decline and neurodegeneration, including deterioration of white matter (WM) throughout the brain 1, 2, 3 . Older adults with HIV infection are at increased risk for cognitive decline 4, 5 and WM neurodegeneration 6, 7, 8 . Importantly, the effects of age can be augmented by factors associated with severity of HIV infection and medical comorbidities which may influence the trajectory of HIV infection and cognitive and brain aging.\n\nNeuroimaging-based estimates of the deviance between an individual's chronological age and predicted brain age -termed brain age gap (BAG) -are sensitive to augmented and/or accelerated brain aging 9, 10 . While no current study has investigated BAG in WM microstructure using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), recently, using brain volume, Cole and colleagues 9 demonstrated that BAG in the volume of brain grey and white matter is greater in HIV-infected individuals than in HIV-controls.\n\nAlthough no significant relationships between BAG and nadir CD4+ or HIV disease duration were reported, the authors investigated white matter volume, rather than white matter microstructure (using DTI) and in a sample of HIV+ participants with undetectable viral loads. Thus, it is unclear to which degree findings of \"attenuated brain aging\" in HIV 9, 11,12 may be mediated by primary or secondary processes related to the infection. It is also unclear what effects these processes may have on WM microstructure. Therefore, this study sought to expand on previous findings by investigating the predicted-BAG in WM microstructure using DTI metrics of white matter patency. This project also sought to further elucidate the effect of HIV severity indices and non-HIV-related medical comorbidities on accentuated WM aging.\n\n.

A support vector machine model trained in a large and independent training-set of healthy controls was used to predict age in HIV+ and comparable HIV-individuals. We tested for group differences in BAG between HIV+ and HIV-, and for associations with cognitive function and HIV disease factors as well as medical comorbidities within the HIV+ group. We converted raw test scores into within-sample z scores and then averaged them to create neurocognitive domain z scores. We calculated the global neurocognition score by averaging the z scores from all of the neuropsychological test variables. Given that the relationship between age and neurocognitive performance in HIV is a primary aim of this study, within-sample z scores were computed instead of demographically-adjusted T scores. IMMUNE STATUS ASSESSMENT: In the testing dataset, HIV+ participants selfreported nadir CD4+ and lifetime highest viral load were used to assess past immune status. Participants also underwent venipuncture to test current CD4+ and HIV viral load. HIV duration was calculated as the number of years since the participant's selfreported HIV diagnosis. Next, participants were classified as either 'pre-HAART' (highly active antiretroviral therapy) or 'post-HAART' based on whether their initial HIV diagnosis was before or after 1996 24 . Further, a \"medical comorbidity burden' index score was computed from the medical history taken during the routine interview all participants completed during data collection. Participants were assigned a '1' if they endorsed a history of each of the following medical conditions: cerebrovascular risk factors including hypertension, heart failure, COPD, anemia, diabetes; endocrine dysfunction including thyroid disease, testosterone therapy, estrogen therapy; kidney disease. Participants were assigned a '0' for all medical conditions they did not endorse. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

This MR data was collected using a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Only the b=0 and b=1000 shells were used for DTI analysis in the present study. All DWI images were quality controlled and visually inspected prior to being preprocessed and analyzed.\n\nDWI scans from UCLA, UiO and Cam-CAN were processed simultaneously through the same pipeline to harmonize imaging methods across sites. All imaging data were processed using FMRIB software Library 25 (FSL, www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk.fsl).

Group differences in dichotomous factors (e.g. sex, ethnicity, urinalysis results) were assessed using chi-square analyses. We used p< .05 as our cutoff for statistical significance for these demographic analyses.\n\nAGE PREDICTION AND BRAIN AGE GAP: UiO and Cam-CAN data were used to train a support vector regression model (SVR) to predict participant age using FA, L1, RD and MD from atlas-derived ROIs (the exact same regions described above 29, 30, 31 ) as features. Similar methods have been employed using imaging data previously 9, 10, 32, including using DTI to assess participant age in a healthy cohort 33 . SVR was conducted in Matlab (https://mathworks.com/help/stats/fitrsvm.html) using the implementation \"fitrsvm\" with a linear kernel, automatic hyperparameter tuning and Sequential Minimal Optimization. Given that multiple MR scanners were used to collect the HIV and training data, scanner was used as a regressor on the features to control for interscanner variability. The model accuracy was validated using 10-fold cross-validation on the training set. After successful validation, the trained SVR was used to predict age of participants in the independent UCLA sample (HIV+ / HIV-). For each individual, BAG was computed by subtracting the participant's predicted brain age by their chronologic .

The HIV+ group had significantly higher medical comorbidity burden (i.e. greater number of medical comorbidities) than the HIV-control group (\u03c7 2 = 7.39, p = 0.007). None of the participants tested positive for barbiturates, cocaine, methamphetamine, phencyclidine, or MDMA. Significantly more HIV+ participants tested positive for prescribed benzodiazepines (\u03c7 2 = 5.93, p = 0.015) .

The HIV serostatus groups did not differ on current alcohol or substance abuse, past (i.e. self-reported lifetime) substance dependence, past substance abuse, past alcohol dependence or past alcohol abuse (all p's > 0.10).\n\nParticipants were not included in the study if they reported previous methamphetamine abuse or dependence.\n\nWithin the HIV+ group, participants diagnosed in the pre-HAART era were In the testing dataset, HIV+ individuals showed higher differences between their brain age and their chronological age than HIV-counterparts (F (1, 103) = 12.408, p = 0.001, partial \u03b7 2 = 0.21). As participant chronologic age increased, BAG also increased (F (39, 103) = 5.57, p = 0.010, partial \u03b7 2 = 0.37). There was no age*HIV interaction on BAG (p > 0.05).\n\nAll results reported below withstood FDR correction. \n\nThis study used machine learning along with a large training data set of normal WM aging to examine HIV-associated WM microstructural alterations and related this WM degeneration to cognitive impairment. Using an SVR trained with this healthy aging cohort to reliably predict participant age based on metrics of WM microstructure, we found that the brain WM age difference (BAG) was significantly higher in our HIV+ group than in the highly comparable HIV-group. Further, BAG widened with increasing age, suggesting that advancing age is a risk factor for neurodegeneration. Additionally, larger BAG was associated with worse cognitive performance, indicating that this .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint 15 Kuhn, T., Ph.D. 15 neurodegeneration may be related to deleterious changes in cognition. Although chronological age was not significantly correlated with prediction error, confirmatory analyses verified that these significant associations between BAG and cognitive performance remained after controlling for participant true age.\n\nImportantly, in our sample in which 11% of the HIV+ participants evidenced a detectable HIV RNA viral load, current CD4 and detectable viral load were not related to BAG. Conversely, highest lifetime HIV RNA viral load, which was not the current viral load for any participant, was related to BAG in the HIV+ group, even after controlling for factors such as HIV duration, pre-versus post-HAART diagnosis and medical comorbidities. Highest lifetime viral load also was not different between the younger and older HIV+ groups. Furthermore, older HIV+ participants who reported high plasma viral load had the greatest discrepancy between their estimated brain age and chronological age, suggesting that history of high viral burden contributes to accentuated brain aging.\n\nThese findings suggest that the impact of early disease burden, even among a sample comprised of 11% of participants with currently detectable HIV RNA viral load, has adverse effects on brain/cognition as HIV+ individuals age. This provides further support of previous findings 9, that demonstrated this augmented aging effect in a sample with no participants with detectable HIV RNA. The relationship of the past plasma viral load to current brain reservoirs of HIV are not known, and we can only speculate that persons with a higher plasma viral burden in blood may have also acquired more viral seeding in brain; this may be the stimulus for greater neuroinflammation and more neurodegeneration over years of exposure. Taken together, these findings may suggest . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint Kuhn, T., Ph.D. 16 that HIV is associated with an augmented aging process in WM which is itself associated with lower cognitive performance.\n\nThe mechanisms by which HIV and age result in augmented neurodegeneration are unclear. Holt and colleagues 6 suggest two potential explanations regarding the relationship between HIV infection and increased brain aging. First, the increased brain age (BAG) may be explained by premature WM aging resulting from the virus facilitating neurodegenerative processes 35 , such as axonal injury, loss of axonal density, reduced patency of axons. Alternatively, advanced age may increase the effects of the virus on the CNS, thereby creating a synergistic interaction effect between HIV and aging 6 . Our finding that lifetime highest HIV RNA viral load, particularly in the context of advanced chronological age, was related to augmented WM aging (i.e. BAG) supports the first hypothesis. In line with this hypothesis, HIV effects on the brain have been shown to occur via similar cellular mechanisms as normal aging 36 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint volume 9 . Similar to that reported by Cole et al., we did not find significant relationships between WM BAG and Nadir CD4 or HIV duration. Our findings expand upon these previous results by providing data suggesting the mechanism through which this augmented aging process deleteriously affects WM microstructure. Our results also further the literature in that we found a significant relationship between BAG and peak HIV RNA viral load as well as a significant age*peak viral load interactive effect on BAG, indicating that the effects of disease burden on brain integrity are more pronounced with advanced age.\n\nFurther, these findings indicate the significant advantages of using BAG to predict HIV-associated white matter aging over other methods. The BAG findings were much stronger than our conventional age-trajectory findings, indicating that the SVRbased brain age approach we used is a sensitive approach to reveal group differences beyond simple differences in mean DTI measures. Additionally, BAG outperformed each individual DTI metric in its ability to discriminate between HIV+ and HIVparticipants and demonstrate the effect of HIV infection on advancing brain white matter age. BAG also may be more useful than, or at the very least a meaningful compliment to, hyper/hypo-intense lesion volume and count which has been shown to relate to HIV infection and cognitive performance, but not to HIV clinical variables or HIV-associated aging 41, 42, 43 . Additionally, BAG is a relatively easy metric to understand and thus it circumvents the cumbersome and difficult to interpret multivariate score often used with DTI metrics which are inherently difficult to connect to clinical variables. In contrast, BAG was successfully and clearly connected to both HIV clinical variables (e.g. HIV RNA viral load) and neurocognitive performance.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint It is important to consider these findings also in the context of the psychosocial stressors and associated comorbidities associated with living with HIV. For example, the HIV+ sample evidenced greater rates of comorbidities, both medical (which were included in the model herein) and psychiatric (e.g. depression, which was not included in the model). It is unclear in the literature to what extent depression is a secondary reaction to living with HIV or is a neurologic symptom of the predominantly frontalsubcortical clinical profile of the disease. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the augmented aging findings are related directly and solely to the effects of the HIV virus on the brain or if they are also related to secondary effects of these HIV-associated increased comorbidities. This is particularly worthy of follow up investigation given that depressive disorders are the most prevalent mental health disorders associated with HIV 44 and studies have shown that depression can be associated with neurodegeneration and increased brain age 45 .\n\nThere are limitations of the current study worth noting. First, the cross-sectional nature of this study hinders our ability to make inferences about the rates of neuroanatomic changes in HIV. Importantly, this limited our ability to determine whether our findings relate to a more static, vestigial process which adds to or augments the aging process in HIV, or whether in fact these results are related to a dynamic, accelerated aging process. This is an important distinction and clinically meaningful question, particularly as the HIV+ population continues to age in the post-HAART era, and must be addressed using a longitudinal model. A recent longitudinal publication 45 demonstrated that HIV+ participants demonstrated greater predicted brain age than HIV-controls when analyzed at cross-section. However, when followed longitudinally, . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint the HIV+ and HIV-groups evidenced comparable rates of change in neuroimaging markers, suggesting that, when receiving successful treatment, people living with HIV are not at risk for accelerated brain aging over two years. Longer longitudinal studies will help clarify whether or not this pattern remains steady over time.\n\nNext, the SVR-modeling of the DTI data appeared to be less accurate (MAE = 7.39 years) than that using T1-MRI to measure brain volume (MAE = 5.01 years) 9 . This could be due to differences in the neuroimaging methodology used (e.g. size, variability and number of features of training sample set). However, it is also the case that we sought to test a different biological entity (DTI-based WM microstructure), and as such a direct comparison between SVR-derived brain ages may not be appropriate, as Cole et al sought to determine a best-predicted brain age based on grey/white matter volume and we sought to determine the best-predicted age of WM microstructure.. The fact that data was acquired at multiple sites using different MR scanner could be a factor and a limitation. However, scanner was included as a variable in the model and the data was homogenized using a single, uniform processing pipeline which has become an accepted standard of practice in the field and indeed has been used in similar machine learning papers 9, 10 where the training data and the disease-specific data were collected at separate sites using different scanners and non-identical scanning parameters. Therefore, this is a limitation of note but one whose impact on the findings was minimized to the best of our abilities. Additionally, although the TBSS method applied should limit the impact of atrophy on our findings, this study did not employ any specific control regarding possible WM lesions. Given that WM lesions have been reported in the brains of HIV+ patients, it is possible that our prediction of WM age could .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint 20 Kuhn, T., Ph.D. 20 be improved had we included WM lesions from any affected patient in the model.\n\nFurther, there are some inherent demographic differences (e.g. race/ethnicity) in the training datasets (from England and Norway) and the test dataset (from Los Angeles).\n\nWhile we attempted to control for these by comparing our UCLA HIV+ participants to UCLA HIV-participants who were highly matched on demographic variables and assessing the effect of race/ethnicity on the outcomes, it remains possible that such demographic or even genetic variables could contribute to our findings, though we believe this is less likely for several reasons including the SVR model fit statistics and similar findings from Cole et al. 9 Further, there are some limits to the generalizability of this study. These include the exclusion of participants with substance use disorders and Axis I diagnoses, the (although non-significant) fact that our sample included fewer HIV+ women, and the fact that the older HIV+ adults are long term survivors from the pre-HAART era and may not be representative of HIV+ adults reaching older age in the near future who were diagnosed in the post-HAART era. Importantly though, it is possible that comorbid substance abuse and/or psychiatric disorders may increase the risk of premature brain aging. Although the current CD4+ and viral load data used in this study were extracted from blood samples collected during the course of this study, nadir CD4+ and highest lifetime viral load were self-reported by participants.\n\nAdditionally, the DTI-based WM metrics were extracted from the entire white matter skeleton, rather than from individual WM tracts (e.g. uncinate fasciculus). This method limits the spatial resolution of our technique. Future examinations between specific tracts with respect to white matter aging are warranted.\n\n.

Importantly, neuroimagederived age predictors may indeed be biomarkers of normal and pathologic aging processes. Therefore, this technique may be generalizable to other disease processes which may affect the aging process, including neurodegenerative disorders (e.g.\n\nAlzheimer's disease) and other neuro-medical illnesses. This technique may also be useful in identifying patients at risk for cognitive decline, functional limitations, and early mortality 10 .\n\n.
