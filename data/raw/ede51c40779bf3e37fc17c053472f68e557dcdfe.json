{"title": "HEALTH CARE-ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS (HAIS)", "body": "T he emergence of life-threatening infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and viral hemorrhagic fevers (eg, Ebola and Marburg viral infections) highlight the urgent need for efficient infection control practices in health care.\n\nHealth care had its first infection prevention and control champion in Florence Nightingale. Although she did not possess the scientific knowledge of asepsis, she conducted research into hospital sanitation. The results of her research made her a believer in pure air, pure water, efficient drainage, cleanliness, and light. In her writings she often described the putrid conditions she found in hospitals. She once stated, \"It may seem a strange principle to enunciate as the very first requirement in a hospital that it should do the sick no harm.\" 1 Her beliefs in prevention led to a standard of structured cleanliness and sanitation in hospitals and the military. Florence Nightingale understood that failure to apply infection control measures favors the spread of pathogens and that health care settings can act as amplifiers of disease during outbreaks, with an impact on both hospital and community health.\n\nHealth care-associated infections (HAIs) are infections that patients acquire while they are receiving treatment for another condition in a health care setting. HAIs may be caused by any infectious agent, including bacteria, fungi,\n\nand viruses, as well as other less common types of pathogens. They are among the leading causes of preventable deaths in the United States and are associated with a substantial increase in health care costs each year. HAIs affect 5% to 10% of hospitalized patients in the US each year. HAIs lead to extended hospital stays, contribute to increased medical costs, and are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Approximately 1.7 million HAIs occur in US hospitals annually, resulting in 99,000 deaths and an estimated $20 billion in health care costs. 2 Healthy People 2020 established high-priority objectives specific to HAIs that address central line-associated bloodstream infections and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. 3 Nearly 3 out of every 4 HAIs in the acute care hospital setting are a result of 1 of the following 4 categories of infection, listed in order of prevalence: catheter-associated urinary tract infections; surgical site infections; bloodstream infections; and pneumonia. 3 In addition to these sources of HAIs, several other sources have been identified as major contributors to HAI-related illness and deaths.\n\nNumerous factors lead to HAIs, including the use and maintenance of medical devices, such as catheters and ventilators; complications after surgical procedures; transmission between patients and health care workers; contaminated air conditioning systems; a disproportionate nurse-to-patient ratio; and the physical layout of the health care facility. 4 Studies have shown that proper education and training of health care workers increases compliance with and adoption of best practices to prevent HAIs. 5 Hands are the most common way in which micro-organisms, particularly bacteria, might be transported and subsequently cause infections, especially in persons who are most vulnerable. Good hand hygiene is an important practice in reducing the transmission of infectious agents. Other important defenses against infectious diseases include proper use of vaccines, antibiotics, and screening and testing guidelines, along with scientific improvements in the diagnosis of infectious disease-related health concerns. 3 The goal of Healthy People 2020 is to prevent, reduce, and ultimately eliminate HAIs. As health care providers, we all have an important part to play in achieving this goal and helping to reduce the number of HAIs that are a major cause of illness, disability, and death each year in US hospitals.
