{"title": "Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Variants with High Pathogenicity, China", "body": "of 3 isolates were amplified by reverse transcription PCR with 2 pairs of primers (5) and sequenced to identify the genetic variation of the isolates.\n\nSequences for the S gene were submitted to GenBank (accession nos. for YS: JQ771753; SH: JQ771751; and ZB: JQ771752). The S gene nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences of the 3 new isolates were aligned with the sequences of published isolates by using MEGA 4.0 (www.megasoftware. net). S protein identity among the 3 new isolates was 99.4%-99.6% and shared 93.6%-93.7% identity with classical CV777 strain. We identified numerous sequence variations in S protein of the 3 isolates (online Technical Appendix Table, wwwnc. cdc.gov/EID/article/19/12/12-1088-Techapp1.pdf). Two separate insertions were discovered: a 1-aa (N) insertion at position 140 and a 4-aa (QGVN) insertion at positions 59-62. A 2-aa (NI) deletion was identified at positions 163-164. A total of 34 separate substitutions were identified, and the number(s) of replaced amino acids ranged from 1 through 5. These sequence variations were similar to those in CH/FJND-3/2011, CH1, CH8, and CHGD-01 isolates recently reported in China (6) .\n\nTo determine the virulence of the PEDV isolates, we experimentally infected fifteen 4-day-old Duroc crossbred piglets with the YS and ZB isolates. The piglets were randomly allotted to 3 groups, each group consisting of 5 pigs. These piglets were shown by serologic analysis to be negative for antibodies against PEDV, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and pseudorabies virus.\n\nIn the piglets inoculated orally with 1.5 mL of YS isolate (10 3.0 50% tissue culture infectious doses/mL), diarrhea was observed at 3-6 days postinfection (dpi). One piglet died at 5 dpi, and 4 piglets died at 6 dpi. The dead piglets showed hemorrhage and shedding in the gastric mucosa, swelling and congestion in the mesenteric lymph nodes, and hemorrhage in the intestinal wall ( Figure, panel A) . Histopathologic changes included epithelial cell shedding; intrinsic layer hemorrhage and excessive infiltration of lymphocytes in the stomach; and congestion, edema, and epithelial cell shedding in the intestinal mucosa (Figure, panel  B) . PEDV was recovered from the dead piglets, and the full-length S gene was amplified by reverse transcription PCR and sequenced. In the S genes of YS and ZB isolates, 3 and 2 single nucleotides were replaced, respectively, but no mutated amino acid was introduced between the inoculated and recovered viruses.\n\nFor the piglets orally infected with 1.5 mL of ZB isolate (10 3.1 50% tissue culture infectious doses/mL), diarrhea was observed at 3-5 dpi, and all 5 piglets died at 5 dpi. The dead piglets showed similar lesions to those of the piglets infected with YS isolate in the stomach, intestines, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Piglets in the control group orally inoculated with Dulbecco minimal essential medium remained healthy during the experiment, and no obvious pathologic changes were observed. Our investigation indicated that the recent diarrhea outbreaks were mainly caused by PEDV variants with novel genetic markers that distinguish them from classical strains. The YS and ZB isolates were highly virulent in piglets. Unlike CV777, the PEDV variants remained almost unchanged in the epitope at positions 499-638; however, a 2-aa deletion, a 1-aa insertion, and 18 separate substitutions were identified in the epitope at positions 83-276 (7, 8) . These variations of amino acid sequences probably changed the immunogenicity of S protein and led to immunization failure of current commercial vaccines made from classical PEDV strains. However, how PEDV has evolved and varies in pig herds are not clear. Further studies, including extensive genomic sequence analyses and serologic cross-neutralization tests, should be conducted. "}
