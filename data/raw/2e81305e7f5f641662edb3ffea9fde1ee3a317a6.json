{"title": "Serum cytokines and clinical features in patients with fever and thrombocytopenia syndrome", "body": "Fever and thrombocytopenia are frequent symptoms in patients with viral infection. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by a novel bunyavirus, was initially identified in 2009. SFTS produces a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations that range from acute self-limited febrile illness to severe disease, with a reported fatality rate varying between 12% and 30% [1] . Due to its poor prognosis and higher mortality, SFTS has quickly become an emerging infectious disease that has aroused extensive surveillance in public health. Currently, SFTS, together with meningitis syndrome and respiratory syndrome, are the primary three syndromes that are monitored in clinic. Unlike other inflammatory disease, the etiology of fever and thrombocytopenia is quite complicated; thrombocytopenia may arise due to a lack of platelet production, retention of platelets (PLTs) in the spleen, platelet destruction, or increased use and dilution of PLTs. In clinic, most thrombocytopenia patients are diagnosed as primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) that is defined as a peripheral blood platelet count < 100 \u00d7 10 9 /l in the absence of any obvious cause of thrombocytopenia [2] . Because the etiology of ITP is so complicated that physicians seldom relies on its etiology to formulate treatment plans, then, it is difficult to explain why some patients have poor therapeutic efficacy.\n\nFever is a common feature and consequence for ITP patients with viral infection. Evidence regarding the cross-reactivity of virus-specific antibodies with normal platelet antigens was firstly obtained in patients developing ITP after contracting human immune deficiency virus [3] and varicella-zoster virus infection [4] . Since then, it has been discovered that thrombocytopenia and viral infections occur in succession. Thrombocytopenia as a major clinical sign is found in some viral infectious diseases including Zika virus, HIV-1, hepatitis B/hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, Epstein-Barr virus, B19 virus, and novel bunyavirus [1, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . A previous study showed that patients with influenza virus A/B or parainfluenza virus 1 infections tend to have a lower PLT count than patients who did not have respiratory viral infection, while patients with human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 2, coronavirus 229, or adenovirus infections did not show significant changes in the PLT count [13] . In some patients, thrombocytopenia caused by viral infection was transient without serious bleeding and spontaneously resolved within a few weeks without treatment [14] ; however, other patients have a severe bleeding syndrome and worse prognosis. The mechanism remains to be elucidated.\n\nThrombocytopenia is also a common complication during or after bacterial infections. Direct interaction between platelets and bacteria may contribute to thrombocytopenia [15] . Helicobacter pylori (HP) has proven to be the most important bacterium causing ITP. Additionally, it was observed that salmonella survived and replicated in macrophages that spread to the lymphatic vessels, spleen, and bone marrow, and thrombocytopenia may be associated with hemophagocytic histiocytes in the bone marrow [16] . Fecal microbial transplantation may also lead to thrombocytopenia during inflammation [17] . Staphylococcus aureus activates platelets through several surface-expressed proteins, and binds to adhered platelets to cause platelet activation and aggregation, resulting in thrombocytopenia [18] . Unfortunately, the role of bacterial infection in thrombocytopenia is often clinically ignored.\n\nA viral/bacterial antigen may be recognized as a similar platelet antigen, a process termed molecular mimicry, which then gives rise to cross-reactive anti-platelet autoantibodies [19, 20] . Platelets with bound autoantibodies are subsequently recognized by phagocytes bearing Fc\u03b3 -receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs), which results in enhanced antibodymediated platelet phagocytosis and destruction primarily in the spleen [21] . In patients with ITP autoantibodies targeting platelet surface glycoproteins, primarily GPIIb-IIIa and GPIb-IX, lead to Fc-dependent clearance via macrophages [22] . Platelets express FccRIIA, an IgG receptor used to identify immune complexes (ICs). FccRIIA is involved in the initiation of strong effectors functions in leukocytes, including cytokine release, antibody-dependent cell-mediated pathogen killing, and ICs internalization, which is critical for immune and inflammatory responses. Virus or bacteria can activate platelets via FccRIIA that plays an important role in the interaction of platelet and pathogen infection, and the polymorphism of FccRIIA-131 directly affects the susceptibility and severity of infection [23] . However, the relationship among the platelet autoantibodies, cytokines, and other parameters associated infection is still not clear.\n\nMany questions regarding the pathophysiology, mechanism, diagnosis, natural history, and management of ITP remain to be resolved [24, 25] . The obscure etiology and mechanisms of thrombocytopenia greatly affect its therapeutic efficacy. First-line therapy for ITP consists of corticosteroids with or without intravenous immunoglobulin [2] , and some patients respond to this while others do not. Nowadays, there are no valuable biomarkers to predict the therapeutic efficacy. Etiologic diagnosis of thrombocytopenia may be beneficial for treatment, to some ITP caused by viral infections, accurate etiologic diagnosis can reduce the amount of antibiotics used. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of ITP is still based on exclusion [26] . The relationships among the etiology of fever and thrombocytopenia, the intrinsic immune mechanism, and therapeutic efficacy remain to be elucidated. To clarify the above issues, patients with unexplained fever and thrombocytopenia were enrolled in this study. The associations among the etiology, platelet autoantibody, cytokine expression, and therapeutic efficacy were investigated with the aim of determining valuable parameters that mirror the pathogenesis and predict therapeutic efficacy of thrombocytopenia.\n\nDuring the period of January 2016 to June 2017, patients with unexplained fever (body temperature > 37.6\u00b0C) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 \u00d7 10 9 /l) were enrolled in our study. Patients with solid tumors, leukemia, liver disease, or upper and lower gastrointestinal or other traumatic bleeding were excluded. Ten healthy volunteers were selected as the controls. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. All samples were collected at the onset of disease and before treatment.\n\nThe nucleic acid from the serum samples was extracted using a viral DNA/RNA magnetic bead extraction kit (TIANLONG, China) and NP968 nucleic acid extraction instrument (TIANLONG, China). A single-tube TaqMan\u00ae real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy (AgPath-ID\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR kit from Applied Biosystems, USA) was used to detect viruses. Bunyavirus was detected using the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) Bunyavirus Real Time RT-PCR Kit (Liferiver, China), and human parvovirus B19 was detected using the Human Parvovirus B19 Nucleic Acid Detection Kit (Daangene, China). PCR amplification was performed using a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nFor bacteria identification, the blood and sputum specimens of patients were cultured according to National Standard Protocols of China. Specimens were inoculated in blood agar, eosin methylene blue agar, and chocolate agar and incubated for 24-48 h at 37\u00b0C. Colony identification was undertaken using a VITEK 2 Compact system (Biom\u00e9rieux, France). Helicobacter pylori was detected using a commercial kit (Human Anti-Helicobacter Pylori Antibody (IgG) ELISA kit (Cusabio, China)).\n\nThe PA-IgG and six cytokines PAF, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-12/23P40, and IFN-\u03b3 in serum samples were detected using a Human platelet-associated IgG antibody (PA-IgG) ELISA kit (Shanghai Jingkang, China), Human Platelet Activating Factor ELISA Kit (Dakewe, China) and Human IL-6/IL-10/IL-17A/IL-12/23P40/IFN-\u03b3 precoated ELISA Kit (CUSABIO, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance values of six cytokines were measured using an Infinite M200 Pro microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland) and then converted to concentration values according to the reagent instructions. The sensitivity of PA-IgG, PAF, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-12/23P40, and IFN-\u03b3 detection was 0.1 \u03bcg/l, 1.17 ng/ml, 2 pg/ml, 5 pg/ml, 31.3 pg/ml, 15 pg/ml, and 5 pg/ml, respectively.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS 19.0 software. Continuous variables with normal distributions were used mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) to describe and compare using multiple variance of multiple samples. Medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were used to describe non-normal distribution, with comparisons based on the Mann-Whitney U test between any two groups. The correlations between serum cytokine and other parameters were obtained using the non-parametric rank-based Spearman's correlation coefficient. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to obtain the significant principal components that most accurately reflect the status of thrombocytopenia. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine and distinguish the usefulness of biomarkers. EFS was calculated from the date of complete recovery (platelet count return to normal range) until the first event (any cause of recurrence or death) or until the last follow-up. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival was compared using Mantel's log-rank test. Thrombocytopenia with or without improvement were analyzed using binary logistic regression. The level of statistical significance was set at 5%.\n\nIn Table 1 Table 1 ). The pathogens could not be measured in 20 cases (25.32%). Of these 79 patients, 52 patients treated with antimicrobials, and most used antibiotics were quinolones, followed by cephalosporins and beta-lactams. Few patients were treated with anti-viral drugs.\n\nWe then divided all patients into four groups according to the pathogens detected (shown in Table 2 ): single viral group (7 cases), single fungal/bacterial (f/b) group (37 cases), multiple pathogens group (15 cases), and unidentified pathogen group (20 cases). Males were more than females, and average age ranged from 54 to 60 years in each group.\n\nIn Table 2 , the improvement rate for the single f/b infectious group was 51.35% (19/37), the single viral group was 42.86% (3/7), the unidentified pathogen group was 40.00% (8/20) , and the multiple infectious group was 33.33% (5/15). In the comparison of laboratory parameters, the white blood cell (WBC) counts in the single f/b group and multiple infectious group were higher than those in the single viral and unidentified pathogen group, and the highest lymphocyte count was found in the unidentified pathogen group (P < .05). The mean PLT count of the four groups was < 76.0 \u00d7 10^9/l, and the mean PLT count of the multiple pathogens group was the lowest (52.27 \u00d7 10^9/l), which was significantly lower than that in the single virus group (P < .05). The mean platelet volume (MPV) count was the highest in the single f/b group (mean = 12.44 fl), which was higher than that in the other three groups. The mean C-reactive protein (CRP) in thrombocytopenia groups was higher than the normal value (CRP < 0.05 mg/ l), similarly, the median PCT in the four groups were higher than the clinical limit of detection (PCT < 0.1 ng/ml), with the median value of the multiple pathogens group being the highest (7.75) ( Table 2 ). The clinical parameters of patients with or without HP infection were also analyzed. The median LY (%) in HP-positive patients were lower than those in negative patients (P < .05). The median PAF concentration was 2.5 times higher in HP-positive patients than that in the negative group.\n\nAmong the six cytokines measured in this study, there were no significant differences for serum IL-12/23P40 and IL-17A among five groups (P > .05) (Fig. 1) . However, we found that serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b3, as well as PAF were significantly higher in all patient groups as compared to those in healthy controls (P < .01). Compared to the unidentified pathogen group, IL-6 was significantly higher in the single viral group with a mean concentration of 153.03 pg/ml (P < .05). The highest level of IL-10 was found in the unidentified pathogen group (501.67 pg/ml). The IFN-\u03b3 concentration (582.59 pg/ ml) was the highest in the single viral group among the five groups. The highest PAF value was found in the single f/b group (400.02 ng/ml). Similarly, the concentration of PA-IgG of healthy people was lower than those of fever and thrombocytopenia patients, and there was a significant difference when compared with three of patients' groups (healthy vs. single virus: P < .01; healthy vs. single f/b: P < .05; healthy vs. unidentified: P < .01) (Fig. 1) .\n\nInner associations were also analyzed between cytokines and the platelet parameters. In this study, the PLT quantity was associated with platelet distribution width (PDW) (r = 0.231, P < .05) and IL-10 (r = 0.331, P < .01). A correlation exists between IL-6 with IL-10 (r = 0.458, P < .01), with PAF (r = 0.370, P < .01), with CRP (r = 0.667, P < .01), and with PCT (r = 0.440, P < .01). The correlations were found between IL-10 with IL-12/23P40 (r = 0.298, P < .01), IFN-\u03b3 (r = 0.446, P < .01), PAF (r = 0.257, P < .05) and PCT (r = 0.379, P < .01). Additionally, IL-12/23P40 was correlated with IFN-\u03b3 (r = 0.447, P < .01), and PCT was correlated with CRP (r = 0.410, P < .01). No correlations were tested between IL-17A and other cytokines (Table 3) .\n\nPCA method was exploited to determine whether the parameters profile reflects disease status in patients with fever and thrombocytopenia. PCA extracted four important principal components with eigenvalues > 1 that explained 58.71% of the total variance of the data set. It can be seen from component 1 that IL . Therefore, to patients with fever and thrombocytopenia, the disease status evaluation would be more accurate if we combined the platelet parameters and inflammatory biomarkers.\n\nThe factors that significantly influenced the prognosis of patients were also analyzed, these were age, PLT quantities, PCT, and IL-17A. Among them, PLT quantities, PCT, and IL-17A were risk factors (OR > 1.0), and age was a protective factor (OR < 1.0) ( Table 5) . We then used Kaplan-Meier survival curves to further assess the suitability of six cytokines and PA-IgG as prognostic factors and to compare the prognosis of different types of pathogen infections. We conducted a follow-up of the patient from hospital admittance to discharge, and survival information was collected. The levels of cytokines and PA-IgG were considered as a stratification variable for survival time analysis. Our data showed that patients with single f/b infection have the highest event-free survival (EFS), and patients with single viral infection had the lowest. EFS in patients with lower levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN\u03b3 and PA-IgG tended to be longer than in patients with higher levels. However, EFS in patients with lower levels of IL-12/23P40 and PAF tended to be shorter when compared to higher-level patients. We observed no significant difference between the higher and lower groups, and the p-values of the K-M curves were all > 0.05, probably due to the small sample size (Fig. 2) .\n\nPlatelets participate in the interaction between pathogens and host defense [27] , but their function in host defense against infection has received much less attention [28] . Pathogenic microbiome may cause thrombocytopenia by autoimmunity mechanisms, mainly through molecules or epitopes that mimic autoantigens, the immunological recognition of previously unexposed auto-antigens, or via bystanders that activate their own responses to lymphocytes and super-antigen-mediated polyclonal T cell activation with exaggerated cytokine release [29] . Studies have shown that an imbalance of T helper cell (Th) and regulatory T cell (Treg) cytokines may mediate the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia, which is closely related to the expression of Th1 cytokines (i.e., IFN-\u03b3, IL-2), Th2 cytokines (i.e., IL-4, IL-10), Th17 cytokines (IL-17), and Treg cytokines (TGF-\u03b21) [30] . Consistent with previous studies, up-regulated cytokines were found in our patients with fever and thrombocytopenia, especially IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b3, indicating that cytokine disorders may be involved in the pathogenesis of newly diagnosed ITPs [31, 32] . Notably, IL-6 in thrombocytopenia patients was significantly higher as compared to healthy controls, and IL-6 in the viral group was the highest among all groups. Moreover, our results revealed that IL-6, together with CRP and PCT, has a strong positive loading in mirroring the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia. PAF is a potent and versatile mediator of pro-inflammation secreted by WBCs [33] , which triggers platelet aggregation and activation. Monocytes that encounter dengue virus begin to generate PAF [34] , and this leads to enhanced apoptosis of platelets and accelerates platelets clearance in secondary dengue infection [35] . The PAF concentration in our patients with fever and thrombocytopenia was significantly higher as compared to the healthy controls, revealing that PAF may involve in the platelet's apoptosis and clearance in infectious thrombocytopenia. The dose-dependent effect of PAF may induce the release of cytokines and affect the host immune response. A previous study showed that PAF can stimulate mononuclear cells of peripheral blood leading to the release of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in viral infection [36] . PAF itself or combined with LPS can promote platelet activation and recruitment and worsen endotoxin-induced injury [37, 38] . Therefore, PAF and cytokines potentiate each other's effects in vivo to modulate the immune response [39] . The strong associations were found between PAF and IL-6, between PAF and IL-10, between PAF and CRP, revealing the PAF, interacting with IL-6 and IL-10, are jointly responsible for thrombocytopenia [25] .\n\nBoth antibody-mediated and/or T cell-mediated platelet destruction are key processes of thrombocytopenia [40] . Through antibody-induced immune-mediated phagocytosis and complement activation, alloantibodies destroy platelets and eliminate them from the circulation [41] . In as many as 30% to 40% of the patients, no detectible antibodies can be found, however, studies have shown that antibodies can cause thrombocytopenia even if the platelet-associated antibody levels in humans are lower than the detection limits of conventional methods. Therefore, the detection of the relevant antibodies is the primary condition for diagnosis and treatment [42] as the presence of autoantibodies targeting GPIb-IX is an effective predictor for refractoriness to steroid or IVIG therapy [43] . In this study, only 2 patients were negative in the PA-IgG test in 79 selected patients, indicating that antibody-mediated clearance maybe the main reason for our patients with fever and thrombocytopenia.\n\nAlthough an informal connection between H. pylori infection and ITP has been suggested by various clinical studies, there are studies that have demonstrated that H. pylori is not associated with thrombocytopenia [44] . The curative effects of anti-H. pylori therapy on improved blood platelet quantity in chronic immune thrombocytopenia is inconsistent [45, 46] . In this study, H. pylori has caused the highest morbidity among bacteria inducing thrombocytopenia. There may be a cross-reaction between H. pylori cytotoxin-related gene (CagA) antibodies and platelet antigens, causing platelet-accelerated clearance. In H. pylori-positive patients, significantly higher levels of IL-6, IL-10, and PAF were found when compared with those in the H. pylori-negative group. Because of the involvement of cytokines, the pathogenesis of H. pylori-induced thrombocytopenia is more complex than initially believed. Unfortunately, the mechanism of H. pylori-induced thrombocytopenia is obscure. Revealing the interaction between H. pylori and thrombocytopenia will greatly expand the choices of therapeutic options.\n\nIn this study, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to further assesses the prognosis of infectious thrombocytopenia. Our data showed that best therapeutic efficacy occurred in the single f/b infectious group, and patients in this group had the highest EFS. The worst therapeutic efficacy was found in the multiple infectious group. Platelet-virus interaction can occur via a variety of receptors expressed on platelets, which are mainly mediated by toll like receptors (TLRs) [47] . Accordingly, different pathogens may interact with its special TLRs on platelets. It is postulated that pathogens recognized by TLRs increase platelet destruction, which is multiplied in the presence of anti-platelet antibodies due to the synergy with TLRs, and then increases R-Fc-mediated phagocytosis [48] . The TLRs activate different signaling pathways and affect cells producing inflammatory cytokines [49] . Therefore, the cytokine production may vary due to the different types of microbiomes. As cytokines involved in immune function adjustment and modulation of the anti-platelet antibody response by B Table 3 The spearman correlation coefficients of six cytokines in patients with fever and thrombocytopenia. IL-6 (pg/ml) IL-10 (pg/ml) IL-12/23P40 (pg/ml) The level of statistical significance (P) was set at 5%. \u204e and \u204e\u204e indicate the statistically significant spearman correlation at the 0.05 level and 0.01 level, respectively. Abbreviations: AUC, areas under curve. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] cells [50, 51] , they may closely related to the platelet destruction. Therefore, we used the levels of cytokines as a stratification variable for EFS, the results showed that cytokine play a significant role in EFS. Patients with lower levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, and IFN-\u03b3 tended to have longer EFS than in patients with higher levels of cytokines. Previous study revealed that IL-22 is elevated in active phases of disease, and decreases in patients responsive to dexamethasone [52] . These results indicate that cytokines could reflect the disease status and the therapeutic effect. The etiology of thrombocytopenia with a viral/bacterial infection may also be due to non-immunological mechanisms. The virus-induced pro-inflammatory environment itself often leads to further platelet activation in viremic patients [53] . Viruses can trigger a decrease in platelet production by infection of megakaryocytes and hematopoietic stem cells to decrease platelet formation; additionally, virus-infected platelets can expose P-selectin or phosphatidylserine, promoting their phagocytosis by macrophages [35] . Another viable mechanism is the formation of mixed platelet-leukocyte aggregates in adenovirus infection [54] that rapidly reduce platelet counts [55] .\n\nThe etiology, immunologic and clinical features of patients with fever and thrombocytopenia is quite complicated, and multiple factors including type of pathogens, cytokines and autoantibody participate in the platelet's clearance. Finding reliable biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis prediction are urgently needed for effective therapy."}
