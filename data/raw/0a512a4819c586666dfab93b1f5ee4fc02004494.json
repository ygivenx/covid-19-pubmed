{"title": "Development of a SYBR green-based real-time RT-PCR assay for rapid detection of the emerging swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus", "body": "Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), a new member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, contributed to a devastating swine disease outbreak in Guangdong province, China, which caused death to more than twenty thousand piglets across four farms and huge economic losses (Zhou et al., 2018b) . The piglets infected with SADS-CoV mainly exhibited the clinical manifestations of acute vomiting and diarrhea and death (Gong et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018b) . It was notable that the genome sequence of the causative agent of this large-scale outbreak shares remarkable homology with a bat coronavirus detected in a cave near the pig farm, implying SADS-CoV most likely originated from bats (Gong et al., 2017; Lau et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2018b) . Considering the high lethality of this new emerging virus and the clinical signs of the infected pigs that are similar to that caused by other porcine enteric coronaviruses, there is an urgent need to establish a sensitive and reliable diagnostic method that will be of help to early discovery and identification of SADS-CoV infection.\n\nCytopathic effect (CPE) could be observed only after serial passages of SADS-CoV in Vero cells, so isolation and detection of the virus by cell culture are time-consuming (Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018b) .\n\nImmunofluorescence (IF) staining has been used for the detection of SADS-CoV (Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018b) , however virus-specific antibody and fluorescently-labeled antibody are required to react with the SADS-CoV antigen, this procedure makes the IF method complex and time-consuming. Recently, a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification method (RT-LAMP) was established for the detection of SADS-CoV, however it couldn't be used for quantitative analysis of the viral copies in the samples . Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a powerful diagnostic method and has been widely used for detection and quantitation of pathogenic microorganism because of high sensitivity and reproducibility (Jensen et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2018a) . Recently, a study reported a probe-based real time RT-qPCR for the detection of SADS-CoV, with a detection limit of 30 DNA copies/\u03bcL (Zhou et al., 2018a) . Whereas, the SYBR green-based qPCR assay does not require an expensive probe, and is more cost-effective and easier to design than probe-based RT-qPCR. However, up to now, there is no report about SYBR green-based real-time RT-qPCR for the detection of SADS-CoV.\n\nIn this study, a SYBR green-based real-time RT-qPCR assay following the manufacturer's instruction. The viral RNA was transcribed and amplified by using PrimeScript\u2122 One Step RT-PCR Kit (Takara, China) with the primers SADS-F and SADS-R. The amplicon was subjected to gel electrophoresis and purified by using DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Beyotime, China). The purified amplicon was inserted into pGEM-T vector and transformed to Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 competent cells. The insert of positive clone was confirmed by sequencing and named as SADS-N. SADS-N plasmid was linearized by endonuclease digestion and transcribed in vitro by RiboMAX\u2122 Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega, USA) according to the instruction of the kit manual. The in vitro transcribed RNA was purified, quantified and converted into copy number as the previously reported method (Yuan et al., 2016) . Ten-fold serially diluted RNA ranged from 1 \u00d7 10 0 -1 \u00d7 10 7 copies/\u03bcL were prepared with DEPC-treated water and used as the molecular standards in the following assays.\n\nFor the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR, the forward primer (5\u2032-ATGT GGCTCCTATGGCCCTT-3\u2032) (covering nucleotides 24,943-24,962) and the reverse primer (5\u2032-ACGTTCGCGTTCTGCGATAA-3\u2032) (complementary to nucleotides 25,095-25,114) were used to optimize the performance of the assay. The SYBR green-based RT-qPCR was carried out using the one step SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Takara, China) following the kit manual. The RT-qPCR assay in a 20 \u03bcL reaction volume contained 10 \u03bcL of 2\u00d7one step SYBR RT-PCR Buffer, 0.4 \u03bcL of Fig. 1 . Sensitivity of SYBR green-based RT-qPCR.

Meanwhile, the detection limit of gel-based RT-PCR was also determined. As shown in Fig. 1A , RT-qPCR could detect as few as 10 copies RNA molecule, but standard sample containing one RNA molecule or distilled water only didn't generate positive signals. The dissociation curve analysis indicated the RNA dilutions range from 1 \u00d7 10 1 -1 \u00d7 10 7 copies/\u03bcL showed almost the same melting temperature (Tm) value (mean Tm values \u00b1 standard deviation: 81.57 \u00b1 0.15\u00b0C), meanwhile sample containing one RNA molecule and distilled water as a negative control didn't generate the similar dissociation curve (Fig. 1C) . The detection limit of the conventional RT-PCR in this study was 100 copies (Fig. 1D) , which was 10 times less sensitive than RT-qPCR. Fig. 1B shows the standard curve generated by plotting the RNA copy number against the cycle (Ct) values of the RNA dilutions tested by RT-qPCR in triplicate using Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad, USA). The Ct values displayed a strong linear correlation (R 2 = 0.9937) with the logarithm of the RNA copy numbers (Fig. 1B) , indicating robust amplification efficiency of the assay. RNA dilutions ranged from 1 \u00d7 10 7 -1 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcL were used to evaluate the reproducibility of the RT-qPCR assay. Intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated as the method previously described (Zhou et al., 2018a) . The intra-and inter-assay CVs of the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR ranged from 0.04% to 2.63% and 0.69% to 3.57% respectively, suggesting remarkable reproducibility and high reliability of the assay.\n\nTo assess the specificity of this RT-qPCR method, a panel of viruses including porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), Table 1 . Distilled water was used as the negative control. The viral genome was extracted by using TGuide virus DNA/RNA kit (TIANGEN, China) following the instruction. When these viruses were tested by the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR assay developed in present study, strong fluorescence signal was only observed for SADS-CoV. No amplification signal was observed throughout the experiment for most of the viruses. Although the fluorescence signal slightly increased after 35 cycles for the PCV2 and PRRSV ( Fig. 2A) , no specific melting peaks at about 81.57\u00b0C were observed (Fig. 2B) , further confirming the specificity of the assay.\n\nTo assess the clinical performance of the RT-qPCR for the detection of SADS-CoV, 84 tissue samples from 84 piglets with diarrheal symptoms were collected from a commercial farm in Guangdong, China, and analyzed by the assay. The SADS-CoV-positive status of the samples was determined by the combination of the amplification curve and the melting curve analysis. The samples were also evaluated by conventional RT-PCR and probe-based RT-qPCR which were reported before (Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018a) . Of 84 samples, 62 samples were SADS-CoV-positive confirmed by SYBR RT-qPCR. When these samples were tested by gel-based RT-PCR, only 45 samples were positive. The positive samples determined by conventional RT-PCR were all positive by SYBR RT-qPCR. Seventeen samples determined negative by conventional RT-PCR were identified as positive samples by SYBR RT-qPCR. When these samples were tested by probe-based RT-qPCR, the detection result was consistent with result by SYBR RT-qPCR. The detection results were summarized in Table 2. SADS-CoV is a recently discovered virus that has resulted in serious outbreaks and huge financial losses to pig farming industry in south China (Fu et al., 2018; Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018b) . Most of these studies applied the conventional RT-PCR to detection of SADS-CoV. However, RT-PCR is time-consuming and cannot determine the amounts of viral copies. A RT-qPCR assay is required for rapid and quantitative detection of SADS-CoV which has been epidemic in the south China.\n\nRecently Zhou et al. reported a probed-based RT-qPCR technique with a detection limit of 30 RNA copies/\u03bcL (Zhou et al., 2018a) . However the hydrolysis probe increased the experimental cost and the difficulty of assay design. Thus we established a cost-effective SYBR green-based RT-qPCR assay with high sensitivity and reliability for detection of SADS-CoV. This assay doesn't require a probe and is costeffective. The limit of detection of the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR is 10 RNA copies/\u03bcL, 10 times and 3 times more sensitive than that of the conventional RT-PCR and probed-based RT-qPCR, respectively (Zhou et al., 2018a) . The detection limit with 10 RNA copies in this study was theoretical analytical sensitivity, since that the sensitivity experiment was done by serial dilution of RNA standard in water, as the method described in a previous study (Zhou et al., 2018a) . To determine more realistic sensitivity of the assay, the sensitivity experiment would be done by spiked RNA from negative tissue homogenate in the future. The positive rate of the clinical samples determined by the SYBR greenbased RT-qPCR assay was 73.81%, whereas that of the conventional RT-PCR was merely 53.57%, further demonstrating the higher sensitivity of the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR assay. In the future, it is necessary to detect rectal swabs by the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR assay to evaluate the effect of bacteria in the samples on the detection capacity of the method. The sequences of the primers used in the SYBR RT-qPCR assay are 100% identity with all known SADS-CoV strains and a coronavirus isolated from the bat, suggesting the RT-qPCR assay not only can be used to detect the clinical samples from the swine, but also that from the bats.\n\nIn summary, a rapid, sensitive, reliable and cost-effective SYBR green-based RT-qPCR assay was established for the detection of SADS-CoV that poses a huge threat to pig industry. The RT-qPCR not only can be applied to the monitoring of SADS-CoV infection, but also the epidemiology study of the virus. In addition, this assay is of great use for the pathogenicity study of SADS-CoV in pigs. It will prompt the understanding of the tissue tropism of the virus and viral distribution in specific organs.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\nComparative results of clinical samples tested by conventional RT-PCR, SYBR green-based RT-qPCR and probe-based RT-qPCR for SADS-CoV detection.
