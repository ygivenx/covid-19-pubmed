{"title": "Winter Dysentery of Adult Cattle Virus", "body": "During the 1930s, the bacterium Vibrio jejuni (Campylobacter jejuni) was considered the etiological agent of winter dysentery in the USA (Jones and Little, 1931; Jones et al., 1931) . Recently, AI Mashat and Taylor (1980b) and Firehammer and Myers (1981) have shown that it can induce fever, diarrhea -sometimes with dysentery-and lesions similar to those described by Jones and Little. In addition, Garcia et al. (1983) suspect that C. jejuni is one of the many etiological agents of winter dysentery. However, C. jejuni was isolated also from the feces of normal calves (Allsup et al., 1972) , and in Great Britain Campylobacter fetus subspecies fetus was identified in cases of winter dysentery <(A1 Mashat and Taylor, 1980a) .\n\nIn view of the difficulties encountered during the microbiological study as well as the experimental reproduction of the condition, the participation of a virus was suggested after transmission of material from feces passed through a Seitz filter. However, a specific agent was not found to be associated with the illness (MacPherson, 1957) . Afterwards, the following viruses were eliminated: IBRV, BVDV-MDV, BAV-3 and BAV-7, reovirus type 3, PI3 virus, bovine rotavirus, enterovirus, syncytial virus, BPoV and Chlamydia psittaci (Scott et al., 1973; Takahashi et al., 1980; Espinasse et al., 1981 Espinasse et al., ,1982 . In Israel, Komarov et al. (1959) isolated a virus by inoculation of egg embryos and mouse brain. In France, Charton et al. (1963a,b) found that the disease was related to an enterovirus able to induce hemorrhagic diarrhea in two 12-13-month-old heifers following intravenous inoculation. Andersen and Scott (1976) found this virus to be different from the agent involved in New York state.\n\nBased on experiments by Horner et al. (1976) and Durham et al. (1979) in New Zealand and especially by Takahashi et al. (1980) and Akashi et al. (1980 Akashi et al. ( ,1981 in Japan, a virus with morphological, physical, chemical and antigenic properties similar to those of coronaviruses was identified in the feces of calves affected with diarrhea; it was associated specifically with winter dysentery. In France, our observations were similar (Espinasse et al., 1981 (Espinasse et al., ,1982 Fig. 117 ), as were those in Belgium (Broes et al., 1984) .\n\nThe Kalegawa strain isolated in Japan and grown in BEK-1 cells (Inaba et al., 1976) replicated in the presence of 5-iodo-2 , -deoxyuridine, indicating that its viral nucleic acid was RNA. It was highly sensitive to ether and chloroform and moderately sensitive to trypsin and heat. It was stabilized by cations to treat- ment at 50\u00b0C for l h . Its infectivity was slightly reduced at pH 3. The virus passed through a membrane filter of 200 nm pore size but not through 100-nm pores.\n\nThe peak of infectivity and hemagglutinating activity was found at a sucrose density of 1.182 g/ml, which is in agreement with results obtained with the USA strain of calf Coronavirus (Pensaert and Callebaut, 1978; Sharpee et al., 1976) and other coronaviruses (Mcintosh, 1974) . Neutralization and HI tests showed a close relationship between the Kalegawa and the USA strains of calf Coronavirus.\n\nThe Kalegawa strain could be propagated in suckling mice. Infected animals died with neurologic symptoms, and serial passage was readily accomplished by intracerebral inoculation with brain suspensions. The third-passage viral material from infected mice evoked the same disease in suckling mice, rats and hamsters inoculated by the intracerebral or by the subcutaneous route. Virus recovered from mice, rats and hamsters could be clearly differentiated from mouse hepatitis virus by neutralization test (Akashi et al., 1981) .\n\nVirus particles were observed by EM in and outside of the degenerating neurons. They had a core 70 nm in diameter and an envelope with spikes (Kubo et al., 1982) .\n\nThe disease has been reported in the USA, Canada, Great Britain, Sweden (Hedstrom and Isaksson, 1951) , Germany (Rolle et al., 1955) , France, Belgium, Israel, Japan, Australia (Hutchins et al., 1958) and New Zealand.\n\nFirst and most frequently, young mature (2-3 years old) dairy cattle are infected during the winter in crowded barns, especially during the postpartum period. The young calves (under 4 months) generally resist the disease or are affected with a milder form.\n\nThe disease has a distinct epizootic character within an area and generally prevails in winter. The disorders literally explode in susceptible herds and initially affect 10-20% of the population. The morbidity can reach 100% in 1 or 2 weeks, depending on the size of the herd. The death rate usually does not exceed 10%. MacPherson (1957) recorded a 1-2% death rate following secondary bacterial infection.\n\nThe economic consequences of winter dysentery mainly concern milk production. It is reduced by 25-95% (50% on average) for 1 or 2 weeks. Afterwards, lactation rarely regains the estimated performance; however, the general tendency is to overestimate the losses (Kahrs et al., 1973; Jactel et al., 1986) .\n\nThe feces of affected animals and probably those of healthy adult cattle (Crouch et al., 1985) are the source of contagion. Virus is transmitted from one animal to another by oral infection (contaminated food), from one farm to another within a small region by the equipment used by, for example, cattle dealers, breeders, technicians, inseminators and veterinarians, and perhaps by animal vehicles (dogs, wild birds).\n\nSusceptibility of the animals is an essential element in the emergence of disorders and their experimental reproduction. Besides the breed and age of the animals as well as their state of immunity, disease expression mainly seems to depend on external factors. The role of sudden temperature changes (cooling) and atmospheric pressure (fall) during the cold season appears to be a determining factor. Consumption of poor quality (moldy) food is usually considered destabilizing for the gastrointestinal ecosystem.\n\nThe disease can be transmitted by oral or oronasal administration of fresh feces within 3-5 days, or of material kept at -60\u00b0C with 10% dimethylsulfoxide within 7-11 days (Scott et al., 1973) .\n\nIn the absence of more precise data on the pathogenesis of winter dysentery, the following hypotheses may be formulated: -the Coronavirus isolated by the Japanese workers may be a single serotype which is capable of causing diarrhea in cattle regardless of their age; it acts on the apical cells of the villus (enterocytes ) of the small intestine and colon, inducing a malabsorption syndrome; -the campylobacter(s), in particular C. jejuni, act as opportunistic agents due to their invading property and colonize the crypts in the same regions; -lipopolysaccharides or endotoxins of the bacteria induce a phenomenon of localized and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation, the source of dysentery.\n\nThe incubation period is between 3 and 7 days. There is a sudden onset of symptoms in the herd after (in some cases) a brief period of hyperthermia (39.5-40.5\u00b0C), anorexia and apathy (24-48 h). Oculonasal discharge and coughing are also frequently noted. The cough has been variously characterized as dry, harsh, hacking and moist.\n\nIn affected animals, the feces are sometimes expelled as a spurt of diarrhea during a coughing fit. The color varies from dark green to black. The feces from 5-10% of the animals contain blood or blood clots. The consistency is liquid or slightly thicker, like that of a dilute vegetable soup. The diarrhea falls to the ground in unbroken lines and may contain large \"soap\" bubbles. The feces often have a characteristic odor. Descriptions range from fetid, to musty, to sweet-nasty. This dung attract dogs who avidly consume it.\n\nMilk production is reduced before, during and above all after the phase of diarrhea, especially in animals that have just calved. In an individual animal the diarrhea may resolve within several hours, but most often it lasts for several days (less than a week). In a herd, the diarrheic episode lasts for 3-4 weeks, 2 weeks on the average. Convalescence is shorter, with milder symptoms.\n\nDeath rarely occurs with winter dysentery and results from hemorrhagic anemia following intense asthenia or respiratory or intestinal complications (like peritonitis) (Campbell and Cookingham, 1978) .\n\nThe lesions are those of a catarrhal inflammation: injected serosal blood vessels, edematous intestinal walls and swollen, wrinkled and congested mucosa. Ecchymosis and petechiation are commonly found. The intestinal contents have been observed to be dark and fluid, sometimes mixed with mucus or blood (Fig. 118) .\n\nLesions of the respiratory mucosa can extend from the posterior nasal cavity down the trachea to the large bronchi; they appear as congestion, swelling, petechiation and serofibrinous exudation.\n\nIn general, immunity is found after a herd epizootic, protection ranging from 6 months to 2 or 3 years. It seems that the period of protection is directly correlated with the number of infected animals (Roberts, 1957) . MacPherson (1957) claims that greater susceptibility in young adults is due to the loss of colostral antibodies and increasing stress.\n\nThe diagnosis of winter dysentery is not based on laboratory methods. This is due to the lack of knowledge concerning the etiological agent(s); the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the illness are necessary to provide a positive diagnosis. For a differential diagnosis BVD-MD, rinderpest, salmonellosis, paratuberculosis, coccidiosis, gastrointestinal strongylosis, liver fluke and food poisoning should be considered.\n\nIn feces, Coronavirus can be found in conjunction with winter dysentery by EM, as demonstrated by the authors. Recently, Sato et al. (1984) have recommended reverse passive hemagglutination for the detection of bovine Coronavirus in feces (bovine Coronavirus antibodies raised in rabbits bound to sheep erythrocytes). This method seems to be specific and sensitive. The test detected bovine Coronavirus in 13 out of 22 fecal samples (59%) from natural cases of diarrhea, while the positive rates were 14% (3/22) and 22% (5/22) for IF staining (primary cultures of calf kidney cells infected with the specimens) and IEM, respectively. Coronavirus can be isolated from feces in bovine fetal kidney cells and identified by direct IF using a rabbit antiserum conjugated with fluorescein isothyocyanate (Takahashi et al., 1980) .\n\nThe test for seroconversion of bovine Coronavirus by SN or HI is another means of approaching the etiological diagnosis of winter dysentery (Takahashi et al., 1980) .\n\nNo vaccine has been developed due to the lack of knowledge concerning the source of winter dysentery. Moreover, a number of specific vaccines, e.g. against leptospirosis, IBR and BVD-MD (Kahrs et al., 1973) are not effective. American practitioners use inactivated vaccine preparations containing different bacteria (Pasteurella), with generally satisfactory results (Williams, 1980) . Prevention of the disease depends on the standard measures of isolation and disinfection used in all epizootics, in and around all centers of infection: immediate isolation of affected animals, traffic restriction, both human and animal, and disinfection of footwear and equipment; however, even when all precautions have been taken, disease outbreaks occur.\n\nTreatment of winter dysentery aims at controlling diarrhea and its consequences. Intestinal sulfonamides and astringents (clay) or a combination of both in pellet form probably only have symbolic value, as there tends to be spontaneous recovery. However, therapy is indicated in animals presenting the most pronounced symptoms, as it makes possible more rapid recovery and avoids complications. In subjects with severe signs of dehydration and/or anemia, oral and/or general fluid and electrolyte replacement and blood transfusions are recommended."}
