{"title": "", "body": "During the 1950's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism-dementia had a striking incidence among indigenous Chamorro Guamanians when compared to the world-wide incidence of these diseases. A research center established to study the phenomenon has written \"Our recent 25-year update of Prospective Case Control Registry, originally established in 1958, clearly demonstrates that although both ALS and PD are familial, offspring of index cases do not show an increased risk of developing disease. Thus, the pattern of inheritance does not appear to be Mendelian, and individuals born after 1920 are at much lower risk of developing disease.\" (1) . In Guam, a declining incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism-dementia was recognized before 1970, and has become more striking in the last decade of study. Nutritional deficiencies of calcium and magnesium have been postulated as a cause of the neurologic disturbance. The dramatic decline in the incidence was thought to be secondary to changes in dietary habits associated with acculturation and westernization (1). However, the high incidence and subsequent decline of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism-dementia could be explained by a neurovirulent influenza virus attacking an isolated and genetically vulnerable population during the great pandemic of 1918.\n\nIncreased prevalence of an unusual complication of a viral disease has been demonstrated in the cheetah (2) . Cheetahs have an extreme paucity of genetic variability thought to be caused by a population bottleneck in the recent past. In domestic cats, the coronavirus has a very low morbidity (about 1%). However, a healthy, productive colony of,cheetahs was decimated by a coronavirus. Genetic monomorphism of a major histocompatibilty complex was suggested to be the reason for the incidence of severe complications (2) . Postencephalitic Parkinson's disease, which was most likely a complication of a neurovirulent influenza virus (3), has been shown to have a linkage with a histocompatibilty antigen. Patients with postencephalitic Parkinson's disease have a significant increase in the incidence of tissue antigen HLA-B14 (4).\n\nIn 1963, cohort analysis of Parkinson's disease reviewed a group of patients that were between the ages 5 and 59 in 1920 (5) . Many of these patients were thought to be postencephalitic parkinsonians. It was correctly predicted, with the aging of this cohort, that the incidence of parkinsonism would peak in the 1950's and that a decline would start in the 1960's. Thus, Guamanian parkinsonism-dementia, Guamanian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and American postencephalitic parkinsonism have in common -1) a hereditary component, 2) a linkage to 1920, 3) a peak incidence in the 1950's, and 4) a significant decline in incidence starting in the 1960's. These observations suggest that Guamanian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism-dementia could have been the result of an unusual complication of a neurovirulent influenza virus in an isolated (? bottleneck) population that had a concentration of vulnerable individuals."}
