{"title": "Transshipment hub selection from a shipper's and freight forwarder's perspective", "body": "Thanks to economic globalization, products on the market are most likely coming from the other part of the world for improving profit margins and necessitating keen global logistics strategy ( Van Hassel, Meersman, de Voorde, & Vanelslander, 2013 ) . Global cargo logistics entails multiple logistics nodes and the cooperative planning of multiple logistics stakeholders ( Carlan, Sys, & Vanelslander, 2016 ) . The connectivity of these nodes, e.g., distribution centers, sea container ports, airports, and transshipment hubs, becomes crucial for effective shipment planning. In cases where global supply chains with high tonnage and volume, the selection of a transshipment hub over a cargo flow becomes increasingly important to cost control and service reliability in the daily operations of logistics stakeholders.\n\nCurrently the global logistics market has been witnessing the increasing use of transshipment transport ( Jiang, Lee, Chew, Han, & Tan, 2012 ). An increasing number of ports emerge as transship-value, and organizational driving forces ( Shi & Li, 2016 ) . Shippers could operationally select a transshipment hub to align the strategic requirement, when ports are choices in hubs with different governmental regulations and service quality and efficiency ( Steven & Corsi, 2012; Talley & Ng, 2013 ) . While from forwarders' perspective, the hub selection is the core to strategic route optimization, which could considerably affect on-time delivery, operational efficiency, and service quality in cargo handling and customs clearance ( Chu, 2014; Lirn, Thanopoulou, Beynon, & Beresford, 2004; Nugroho, Whiteing, & de Jong, 2016; Tran, 2011 ) .\n\nSecondly, both sea and air transports should be options to be considered concurrently. The primary concern is the varying aspects of cargo flow. Nowadays, it is a common practice for logistics service providers and airlines to transport cargo from Asia via ocean to the Middle Eastern freight hub and then transfer to an aircraft for the second leg of the journey to Europe or Latin America ( Kulisch, 2016 ) . In Northern Canada, it has been witnessed that water conditions impact shippers' route choice decisions and the overall performance of multimodal freight transport systems ( Du, Kim, & Zheng, 2017 ) . Here an intermodal operator (e.g. shipper, carrier, or terminal operator) typically designs her service products by following dynamic allocation policies of resources (e.g. air and sea resources), and make her route choice based on the intermodal transportation network ( Wang & Meng, 2017; Wang, Wang, & Zhang, 2017 ) . Both the real-world practices and the relevant academic studies endorse that when selecting a transshipment hub, the services related to both sea and air transports should not be assessed in isolation.\n\nThirdly, a company's country of origin could be a concern in the stakeholder's shipping strategy influencing the choice of a port simply. The effect of country of origin has been extensively studied in strategic management and organizational behavior ( Song, Calantone, & Anthony, 2002 ) . Country of origin, when associated with products, could be regarded as synonymous of high quality and original design, influencing the value perceived by the customers ( Insch & McBride, 2004 ) . It could also be a critical factor affecting particular strategic decision making, such as supply chain configuration of the firms ( Brun et al., 2008; Teng & Jaramillo, 2005 ) . Other literatures have suggested that companies with different country of origin could have significant different emphasis in strategic decision making ( Demirbag, Tatoglu, Glaister, & Zaim, 2010; Harzing & Sorge, 2003 ) . Similarly, in our study, a company's decision makers are likely to have deeper understanding of the ports in the region where their company originally established and more concrete knowledge of their country's unique competitive edge as a selling point in the market. The inherited know-how could influence decision makers' preference in choosing a transshipment hub.\n\nTo explore causation of the above concerns on transshipment hub selection, we select the case about Hong Kong and Taiwan from the population of ports in Asia. It is interesting to note that nine of out of the top ten container ports are in Asia and they are all competing for transshipment cargo. In this paper, Hong Kong and Taiwan's current role as a transshipment hub are examined in the greater China region where direct transportation link (DTL) policy has been implemented. As a transshipment hub, Hong Kong has enjoyed a steady increase in cargo flows since 2005. 1 Hong Kong's transshipment hub status is unwavering as there is a lack of transportation policies between Taiwan and the Mainland. However, the DTL policy opens direct cargo flow, by sea and air, across the Straits between Taiwan and the Mainland China. Without direct flights to Taiwan from the Mainland, many thousands of Taiwanese companies based in Guangdong and Fujian provinces have to hub their components and finished products in their export operation through Hong Kong. Now related logistics stakeholders in the region have to carefully frame the global transport network and select transshipment hub accordingly.\n\nIn the following sections, we first review relevant literatures and develop a research framework for this study. Having a number of group discussions with logistics practitioners, we formulate logistics stakeholders' decision model as an analytical hierarchy that is generic for transshipment hub selection. Using the specific case of Hong Kong and Taiwan provides a unique opportunity and focal point for discussions among participants. We can then determine the relative importance of the decision concerns. We also conduct a comprehensive comparison between the two hubs to further examine the diversity of logistics stakeholders' views. Discussion on managerial implications is provided to enhance the generalization of this study in the last section.\n\nIn the prior research, selection of a transshipment hub has been seldom studies. Instead, sea port selection problem has been extensively studied in the last decade, with respect to dominant sea freight regions, such as Greater China ( Lirn, Thanopoulou, & Beresford, 2003 ) , Southeast Asia ( Tongzon, 2009 ) , Western Asia ( Sayareh & Alizmini, 2014 ) , North American ( Guy & Urli, 2006; Steven & Corsi, 2012 ) , and European area ( Onut, Tuzkaya, & Torun, 2011 ) . These single transportation mode studies were conducted from the perspective of logistics stakeholders in the sea transport community. For instance, Nir, Lin, and Liang (2003) examined Taiwan shippers' behavior when making selection among the three local sea ports, while Lirn et al. (2004) studied the same set of ports from the perspective of global ocean container carriers. These studies provided an understanding of sea port selection in key global regions. More recently, Wang and Hong (2011a) argued, with respect to air freight transportation, Taiwan had taken on this endeavor to gain competitive advantages under Direct Transport Link policy. In our study, we are not looking at selection of a single-modal port among competitive ones in a region, but rather at the selection of a transshipment hub, where choices of different modals are presented, in the context of global cargo logistics.\n\nMoreover, methodologies used in most existing port selection studies were either economic models or statistical analysis, offering what is relevant, but did not provide us the understanding of strategic and operational concerns in transshipment hub selection. Malchow and Kanafani (2004) proposed a discrete choice model for selecting a US port for maritime shipments. Chou (2007) applied fuzzy multiple criteria decision making method (MCDM) in selecting a transshipment container port. Based on the Air Cargo Supply Chain Operations Reference (ACSCOR) model, Low, Yuan, and Tang (2008) conducted a statistical analysis to study competitive advantages of Hong Kong and Singapore ports. Alonso and Sanchez-Soriano (2009) analyzed actual inter-port traffic distribution using a discrete choice modeling approach, and investigated impacts of port location on port selection from the perspective of hinterland.\n\nOther studies made use of AHP approach to identify and assess critical factors in the port selection from a particular perspective of logistics stakeholders, with respect to single ports of different nature. Both AHP-based studies conducted by Lirn et al. (2003 Lirn et al. ( , 2004 found that, from a carrier's perspective, factors of port location and carrier cost were more important than factors of port management and port physical characteristics in the port selection. Song and Yeo (2004) conducted a competitive analysis of major Chinese container ports by using AHP approach. The study also identified port location is an important concern, while insufficient facility was more important than the lack of service in building up the competitiveness of Chinese container ports. Sanchez, Ng, and Garcia-Alonso (2011) investigated major attributes in port selection. From the port service provider's perspective, the empirical study indicated that time efficiency, cases of delays and accessibility of ports as the core factors affecting port attractiveness.\n\nFrom the perspective of shipping lines, the AHP study of Guy and Urli (2006) examined whether the existing four important concerns, i.e. port infrastructure, total transit cost, service , and geographical location , were suitable to account for the selection of New York and Montreal ports. Chang, Lee, and Tongzon (2008) performed exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in shipping lines' port selection with main haul services between East Asia and Europe. This study identified five important factors, including advancement/convenience of port, physical/operational ability of port, operational condition of shipping lines, marketability , and port charge. Recently, Wang, Jung, Yeo, and Chou (2014) studied the cruise lines' port selection using the fuzzy-AHP method. The study specified the most considerable factor, i.e. tourism attractions , which is problemspecific and two important concerns, i.e. connectivity and agility and terminal facilities , which are general in port selection. In the context of West Africa, the AHP study conducted by Gohomene, Yang, Bonsal, Maistralis, Wang, and Li (2016) has identified port infrastructure as the most crucial factor, along with other important concerns, including port draught, political stability, market size , and international networks . Onut et al. (2011) formulated a production firm's selection of container ports within the Marmara region as a fuzzy AHP model, which examines six major criteria, i.e. port location, hinterland economy, physical features of port, port efficiency, cost , and some others. Ahn, Lee, and Han (2014) examined port selection of import and export companies in metropolitan areas trading with China and they identified a set of relevant concerns, including port fee, ocean freight changes , and port information services . It is found that port location and cost were typically important factors in a variety of research contexts.\n\nIn our study, all of these factors mentioned above will be presented to different logistics stakeholders for consideration. The transshipment hub selection problem is based on intermodal freight transport practices, and views from-logistics service providers (e.g. freight forwarder) and cargo owners (e.g. shippers)have to be collected.\n\nIn practice, selecting a transshipment hub is a complex decision making process. Both tangible and intangible decision criteria are involved. A logistics stakeholder (e.g. a shipper or a freight forwarder) may simultaneously consider many criteria (factors) such as port location, delivery costs, service reliability, and custom regulations. A criterion often consists of multiple attributes (subfactors). The relationships among criteria and their attributes can be offered in a hierarchy for evaluation. Therefore, it is important to formulate and structure a comprehensive framework to better understand the selection of a transshipment hub from the perspectives of logistics stakeholders.\n\nThe Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is capable to combine both subjective and objective perceptions into a framework based on ration scale ( Ramanathan, 2013; Saaty, 1990; Yang, Hui, Leung, & Chen, 2010 ) . AHP is a flexible and powerful approach to measure both tangible and intangible criteria. With AHP, an expert develops multiple decision criteria with a hierarchy and assesses the relative importance of these criteria by comparing each pair of the criteria-that is, a pairwise comparison process. Pairwise comparison can be conducted by surveying either the whole population or a sample of qualified decision-makers ( Hughes, 2009 ; Lirn et al., 2003 ). With the relative importance of all the criteria, the overall ranking of the alternatives is then calculated. The rating is rather subjective and is based on the experience and expertise gained by the respondents. Therefore, AHP studies commonly take samples of experts or participants from top management teams (e.g. chief executive officer, general manager, or division director) of relevant organization(s) from professional industrial communities ( Di Gravio, Patriarca, Mancini, & Costantino, 2016 ) . Representative group judgments could be then obtained by aggregating individual weights through geometric mean ( Van Den Honert & Lootsma, 1997 ) .\n\nTraditionally, using AHP in solving a decision problem involve four steps: firstly, establishing an analytical hierarchy with identified factors and attributes; secondly, collecting input data by pairwise comparisons of the decision elements; thirdly, estimating the relative priorities of these elements in the hierarchy; and lastly, obtaining the overall ranking of the alternatives ( Johnson, 1980; Zahedi, 1986 ). Here we propose an AHP-based analytical framework, which consists of three steps to reveal the collective views of logistics stakeholders on selecting a transshipment hub in the business context ( Fig. 1 ). Note that this research framework is in line with the above traditional four-step approach.\n\nStep 1 and Step 2 of this study are in line with the traditional first and the second steps, respectively. In Step 3, we deduce the collective views of logistics stakeholders based on the individual relative weights and ratings. This step combines the computation works of both the traditional third and fourth steps.\n\nStep 1: Identify critical factors of transshipment hub selection through group brainstorming. The brainstorm sessions are conducted open-ended with industry experts and professors in domain knowledge.\n\nAHP suggests decomposing a decision problem into a hierarchy of associated elements. The decision hierarchy is constructed by indicating an ultimate goal of such a decision and/or assessment on the top level of the hierarchy, and specifying their attributes in the respective levels of the hierarchy. In our study, the ultimate goal is the preferences of decision makers on selecting a transshipment hub; the lower levels of the hierarchy contain decision criteria and their respective attributes which derived from collective views of industrial experts.\n\nWith brainstorm sessions, collective views of industry experts on the decision criteria are collected. The critical criteria can then be identified and the hierarchy can be developed. A comprehensive questionnaire for the AHP analysis can be subsequently developed based on the identified criteria.\n\nStep 2: Determine individual preference in choosing a transshipment hub based on face-to-face interview with experts. Interviews with individual experts are held to understand the correlation of the identified factors. Major concerns of selecting a transshipment hub by the individual stakeholders are identified.\n\nThe relative importance of the hierarchical elements is determined. Factors are compared pair-wisely so as to determine relative weights of each in contributing to the goal, i.e., the com-petitiveness of transshipment hub. The relatively important factors should have relatively higher weights, and been given more attention in making a decision.\n\nStep 3: Obtain the collective views of logistics stakeholders by aggregating AHP factor rankings of experts. The analysis is based on individual ratings and involves a consistence test. The computational procedure on \"weights\" as suggested by Saaty (1980) is followed. Here the eigen value method is used to estimate the relative weights of the criteria in determining the selection of a transshipment hub. Corresponding mathematical illustration is as follows.\n\nBased on the survey in Step 2, an expert's judgments can be represented as a n by n pairwise comparison matrix A , where n denotes the number of factors involved. In matrix A, a ij measures the relative importance of factor i against factor j . The relative importance varies from 1 to 9, where 1/1 indicates equal importance and 9/1 indicates extreme importance. According to the reciprocal property of A , a i j = 1 / a ji for all i = j , and a ii = 1 . Then,\n\nIn practice, inconsistency may occur, i.e., a ij a jk = a ik . According to Saaty (1990) , the weight w = ( w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w n ) can be approximated by solving Aw = \u03bb max w , where \u03bb max is the principal eigen value of A . Moreover, Saaty (1990) suggests that if A does not have any inconsistency, then \u03bb max = n ; otherwise \u03bb max > n . The more consistent of A , the closer \u03bb max is to n . Based on this property, the consistency index (CI) can be defined as:\n\nWe examine the CI for each interviewee to ensure the quality of the responses.\n\nOnce obtaining the weights for each interviewee, i.e., w k =\n\nwithin a group, we construct representative group judgments w G = 1997 ) . Then w G is normalized such that i w G i = 1 .\n\nIn this section, we formulate logistics stakeholders' decision model as an analytical hierarchy with identified factors and their respective attributes. To obtain a comprehensive view, we invite industry experts from both sea and air freight communities to prescribe their decision process and concerns. Through group discussion, we identify critical decision concerns based on their individual experiences using the case of Hong Kong and Taiwan as an example, in selecting a transshipment hub. These sessions facilitate the exchange of real-world practices and know-how in an effort to reach an articulation and understanding of explicit and implicit concerns, which are generic in the hub selection.\n\nStakeholders involved in cargo logistics from or to Mainland China are included. Both sea and air freights will be looked into for cargo flow which related to cross-strait transportation. Shippers are considered as service receivers, while third party freight forwarders (3PLs) are service providers who involve in designing cargo movement routes. Besides, concerns of sea freight and air freight forwarders could be different. For example, a sea freight forwarder may consider using Port A rather than Port B in terms of ocean connectivity to the world, while an air freight forwarder may consider Port B rather than Port A in terms of the cost incurred.\n\nThe country of origin of the company is used in this study instead of where the company is geographically located. A shipper owned by Taiwanese company, whose branch is located in Hong Kong, is considered as a Taiwanese shipper. It is believed that corporate executives have familiarity or knowledge of the port in the region where the company established. Here, shippers, 3PLssea and 3PLs-air are further classified by regions as \"Taiwan\" and \"Hong Kong\".\n\nTherefore, stakeholders are classified into 6 groups as follow: (1) Hong Kong shippers, (2) Hong Kong 3PLs-air, (3) Hong Kong 3PLs-sea, (4) Taiwan shippers, (5) Taiwan 3PLs-air, and (6) Taiwan 3PLs-sea. We invited 27 experts, all of them are senior executives with substantial experience (over 20 years) in trade, manufacturing or logistics business within/between Greater China and overseas. They are carefully selected with fair representations of air/sea mode of transportation, logistics/shipper as well as Hong Kong/Taiwan. The experienced participants with similar focus (i.e. being a certain business role) are then divided into groups of three to four each, so as not to disturb the discussion focus or dilute the difference among stakeholders. Note that here focus group sessions aim to explore opinions, attitudes, and decision concerns of certain stakeholders, rather than create innovative solutions to particular problems. While participants of a group vary in terms of gender, educational background, working experience, and management positions, the group could benefit from the synergy in generating opinions and highlighting decision concerns with respect to the certain business role. Table 1 shows the number of participants in each group.\n\nIn each group discussion, the experts brainstorm the important factors and the preferences in choosing a transshipment hub for around 45 min. Then, a preliminary AHP hierarchical structure is distributed to each expert to collect their comments on the design for 30 min. We initiate and coordinate each group discussion by defining factors and questioning the group members the issues and concerns in selecting a transshipment hub.\n\nComments are collected and recorded for review. Similar comments are aggregated and the frequency mentioned by experts is also calculated. A preliminary AHP questionnaire is reviewed with the aggregated opinions as attributes. The related attributes are then further grouped into a factor. The discussion has been conducted with the six individual groups, where the questionnaire is revised after each brainstorm session.\n\nThe experts' opinions are summarized and formulated to a finalized AHP hierarchical structure. As a result, 8 critical decision criteria (factors) with their corresponding attributes are identified. They are location, cost of route, facility, connectivity, port service, cargo information, customs regulations & government policies , and legal & financial service . These criteria consist of a total of 21 attributes (sub-factors). Table 2 shows the 8 criteria and the 21 subcriteria. A finalized AHP questionnaire is then constructed. \n\nSub-factors Explanation 1. Location 1.a Geographical location Physical position on earth, e.g., distance to transport facilities as well as to main navigation routes ( Chang et al., 2008; Gohomene et al., 2016; Guy & Urli, 2006; Lirn et al., 2003; Lirn et al., 2004; Onut et al., 2011; Sanchez et al., 2011; Song and Yeo, 2004; Tongzon, 2009 ; Wang, Hong, Chen, & Jiang, 2011b ) 1.b Natural factors Susceptibility to natural assurance or hazards such as water depth and severe weather ( Chang et al., 2008; Lirn et al., 2003 ) \n\nCoverage of industrial structure, and economy strength of nearby area where the hub is located ( Gohomene et al., 2016; Guy & Urli, 2006; Onut et al., 2011; Wang & Hong, 2011 a) 2. Cost of route 2.a Total costs Costs associated with transshipping through the hub, including transit cost, carrier loading/discharging cost, insurance, potential penalty on delayed delivery, etc. ( Lirn et al., 2003; Lirn et al., 2004; Guy & Urli, 2006; Tongzon, 2009; Onut et al., 2011; Ahn et al., 2014; Gohomene et al., 2016 ) \n\nAs to obtain the collective views of logistics stakeholders, we interview a number of experienced practitioners individually by using the questionnaire, and determine their preference for a transshipment hub. The individual judgments from these practitioners are then examined and aggregated.\n\nDetermining individual preferences. The experienced practitioners are identified from logistics organizations as Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding and Logistics Limited (HKAFF) and The Hong Kong Shippers' Council (HKSC). Some renowned stakeholders are also asked to recommend other experienced practitioners to fill out the questionnaire. Four to five respondents are invited from each identified group to provide a good breadth and depth of understanding from the industry. They are individually invited to assess the importance of the factors based on their views and experience. Only practitioners who are not involved in brainstorming sessions are invited to the interviews.\n\nIn each interview, 5-10 min are spent to introduce the project objectives, and the respondents complete the questionnaire usually within 45 min. Each practitioner conducts the pairwise comparison in a 9-point scale which indicates the relative importance of each factors as well as each attribute. As a result, a total of 33 industrial practitioners, including shippers, 3PLs-air, or 3PLs-sea from Hong Kong and Taiwan, are invited.\n\nThe practitioner's individual judgment on pairwise comparisons is examined in terms of the consistence. The consistence test is to detect the level of inconsistency of the answers (i.e. the relative importance among the factors). For example, a respondent may rate Factor A more important than Factor B, and rate Factor B more important over Factor C. Therefore, Factor A should be more important than Factor C from this respondent's perspective. However, in the pairwise comparison between Factor A and Factor C, the respondent may reflect that Factor C appears to be more important than Factor A. As such, inconsistency happens. Moreover, inconsistency may also happen due to the incorporation of 9-scale points in the survey. For example, if an respondent put an answer that Factor A is more important than Factor B at \"3\" (i.e. moderately important), and Factor B is more important than Factor C at \"9\" (i.e. extremely important), and Factor C is less important than Factor A at \"2\" (i.e. moderately important), then inconsistence happens again in terms of scale points. Table 3 shows the results of consistence tests of individual judgments. To deal with inconsistent adjustments, researchers could request interviewees to change their entry iteratively until interviewees' judgments are near consistent ( Saaty, 2003 ) . In our study, each interviewee has to complete 9 pairwise comparison matrixes. The current interview lasts for 50-55 min, with the first 5-10 min to introduce the project and the remaining 45 min to complete the questionnaire. If we perform to correct inconsistent weights, the iterative change would substantially extend the interview time. Moreover, it may create survey fatigue, i.e., interviewees may feel bored, tired or uninterested in the survey and begin to perform less honestly. Interviewees could \"become arbitrary and thus distort the validity of the derived priority vector in representing the underlying decision\" ( Saaty, 2003 , page 85) . Therefore, to make the interview manageable and to ensure the quality of the judgments, we exclude the practitioners whose individual responses fail in consistence tests (i.e., the consistence level is higher than 0.1) from our AHP analysis. As a result, 25 out of 33 respondents are included in this study. Representative group judgments. Representative group judgments are obtained by aggregating the individual judgments of respondents within the same group. Individual practitioners in a category typically have some similar concerns in selecting a transshipment hub. Aggregating individual judgments is generally a proper way to represent the common concerns of the identified group. Certain computation techniques are used, such as calculating the geometric average of respective pairwise comparison weights of all the respondents, in order to obtain the overall rating on each factor and attribute collected from each group.\n\nThe geometric mean of the respective weights collected from each group is calculated to determine its representative judgment. The relatively importance of the factors for each group is then determined as shown row-wise in Table 4 . Here the top three factors are identified as cost of route, customs regulations & government policies , and connectivity, which indicating these are most important for logistics stakeholders, while the other factors, such as location, port service , and legal & financial service , are considered as less important.\n\nIn fact, all stakeholders consider cost of route as one of the most important factors. This is understandable since transportation and logistics are considerably cost-driven. Besides, customs regulations & government policies is also consistently important for all respondents. Under the Direct Transportation Link policy, Hong Kong 3PLs and shippers often worry more about the documentation issues, while Taiwan 3PLs and shippers concerns about customs clearance procedures. Furthermore, connectivity is another concern, which indicates that choices of routes and connection between ports are also critical in selecting a transshipment hub.\n\nNext, we further investigate the sub-factors identified for the three factors. Table 5 shows the top 4 sub-factors that are the most important from the perspectives of each group of logistics stakeholder.\n\n(1) Sub-factors on cost of route . It is well observed that total costs are more important than variety of service offerings with costs to all stakeholders. Both logistics providers and shippers are concerned about the total costs that may incur but not the variety of service offerings that may offer.\n\n(2) Sub-factors on customs regulations & government policies. Further into the attributes of customs regulations and government policies, stakeholders are concerned more about the attributes on simplicity and transparency of customs procedures and stability of government policies instead of simplicity of free trade policies . As to the cargo logistics within Great China, customs procedures and government policies are not clearly defined and often with uncertainties to most stakeholders. Additional time and extra costs may be incurred as a result to 3PLs and shippers.\n\nWith well-developed government regulations and policies, Hong Kong stakeholders concern more about the documentation issues and supports in sea freight transportation. While Taiwan 3PLs and shippers bring forth customs clearance procedures concerns-the complexity of existing customs regulations and government policies hinders rather than facilitates efficient transport logistics. If Taiwan government could provide a more open and supportive regulatory infrastructure, Taiwan could gain much more competitiveness in operating a transshipment hub.\n\n(3) Sub-factors on connectivity . In terms of connectivity, most practitioners argue that the attribute frequency of calling vessels/flights is more important than connection to major ports. The reason is that the frequency and reliability of services are more crucial to stakeholders, while connections to major ports are rather fixed and the process to develop a new connection with other ports usually requires long negotiation.\n\nIn sum, the AHP analysis indicates the consensus and the diversity of the decisions made among the different groups on port selection. Different factors that may influence the selection of a transshipment hub are identified and investigated. The analysis shows that all stakeholders, who may be influenced by the imminent DTL, are considerably concerned about the three C's, i.e. cost of route, customs regulations & government policies , and connectivity .\n\nIn addition to the three C's, we attempt to reveal whether Hong Kong has sustained its competitive advantages in operating an international transshipment hub or if Taiwan has the potentials to overtake Hong Kong dominating position or simply replacing Hong Kong's role as a whole. We study the logistics stakeholders' preference on Hong Kong and Taiwan ports in general, and in effect The rankings of relative importance weights of the critical sub-factors of representative group judgments. The bold is just to highlight the result. to understand the competitiveness of these two ports. Comments from the stakeholders are also collected and investigated. We invite industrial practitioners to rate their preference in using Hong Kong and Taiwan ports based on their experience. The overall rating as well as the factors and attributes identified earlier are assessed on a scale of 0-10 (the higher rate, the better performance). After conducting the questionnaire, the geometric mean of the ratings is calculated to evaluate the preference of the two ports from the respective groups.\n\nAmongst all the stakeholders, Hong Kong port has the highest rating score as shown in Table 6 . It is interesting to find that the stakeholders from the respective region tend to rate higher on their corresponding ports. As to all the Hong Kong logistics stakeholders, the gap between Hong Kong port to Taiwan port is larger than 1.367. It is understandable that uncertainties may exist in a port that is unfamiliar to the practitioners. It is also observed that the competitive advantage of Hong Kong port over Taiwan port in sea freight forwarding is not as significant as that in air freight forwarding.\n\nWe further investigate the competitive advantage of the two ports with respect to the major factors three C's in the AHP analysis ( Table 7 ) . Customs regulations and government policies , and connectivity of Hong Kong port are rated higher than that of Taiwan ports, and the gap of these two criteria between Hong Kong port and Taiwan port is relatively large. Stakeholders are satisfied with the infrastructure and the connections in Hong Kong. Hong Kong still has the advantage due to frequent connections and a wider coverage; along with its well-developed customs regulations and government policies. While cost of route in Hong Kong is rated slightly higher than the one in Taiwan, most stakeholders are willing to pay more for the quality services. From these results, it is also interesting that sea freight forwarders in both Hong Kong and Taiwan are most concerned of the costs in the logistics practices as their profit margin is relatively low compared with other stakeholders.\n\nFrom the preliminary survey and interviews conducted among the sampled stakeholders, the most important factors which affect the stakeholders in selecting the transshipment hub have been identified: cost of route, customs regulations & government policies, connectivity . It has been recognized that the most obvious decisionmaking style among all the shippers and freight forwarders is costdriven.\n\nMoreover, in terms of customs regulations & government policies , many shippers and 3PLs are still adjusting themselves in the adoption of the policy. They find it difficult in execution which possibly due to natural factor or government policies including customs regulations. For instance, after the implementation of Direct Transportation Link policy, the stakeholder's key concerns are also driven by connectivity of ports and business relationships with cargo owners, with emphasis on further clarification of government policy across the Straits and further development on the link agreement in specific terms such as taxation.\n\nHowever, in terms of the other critical factors, stakeholders usually have different preferences, which mainly due to their different domain (sea/air transport) and country of origin of their company. Therefore, there is a need for decision makers to consider the options of sea/air transports and the country of origin issues during the port selection process. \n\nThe findings on how sea and air transports affect the selection are consistent with the critical decision factors and the relative sub-factors that identified in the brainstorm sessions. The issue of routes and connection has significant influence on the sea/air transport options. The frequency of calling vessels/flights and reliability of services are more crucial to stakeholders. For example, the DTL policy has brought sound benefits to the cross-strait transportation services, such as shortened traveling time due to direct flights and vessels. For air freight, travelling time from Taoyuan airport in Taiwan to Shanghai airport in Mainland China has been reduced from 6-7 h to 84 min while the average transport time has been decreased by 16-27 h for sea freight. The policy enables 3PLs to offer more choices on selecting ports and routes between the Mainland and Taiwan to their clients.\n\nMeanwhile, there are still barriers and difficulties that affect stakeholder's sea/air transport selection, such as government planning, operational policy & regulations, customs issues, and stakeholder's adoption of the policies, etc. Take DTL case as an example, Hong Kong government has been focusing on airport expansion, but paying less attention to that of seaports such as policy development with respect to DTL. As the seaports in Mainland China have been gradually developed with advanced technologies and facilities, the seaports in Hong Kong have yet to show similar driving force to maintain its leading role and competitiveness. Such lack of development progress would incur inconveniences and handicaps for 3PLs and shippers to make full use of the policy. Taiwan, on the other hand, ports have been unattractive possibly due to unstable climate especially in typhoon seasons, which could incur higher operation costs such as delays in cargo delivery. This could result in lower motivation for the 3PLs and shipping lines to use Taiwan ports. Indeed, comparatively inefficient facilities and less transparent cargo information lead to inconvenience to operators and 3PLs for cargo handling. The operators and 3PLs are reluctant to use Taiwan ports as they often are not responsive to operational and handling changes.\n\nIn this paper, the case study provides an insight into how the stakeholder's country of origin influences their preferences in port selection process. The survey result shows that stakeholders tend to choose their own country's port, given that they have concrete knowledge of their own country or region's competitive advantages and clear understanding of the policies and regulations.\n\nFor example, in the case study, Hong Kong logistics stakeholders have been recognized that they tend to choose Hong Kong as their sea/air transport, mainly due to their better understanding of the simple customs procedures and the free-trade gateway. They also have sufficient know-how to leverage Hong Kong port's undisputed advantages on high handling efficiency, close connection with major ports around the world, and well-established infrastructure with open legal and financial system, which provides a fair and transparent market to all business parties.\n\nMeanwhile Taiwanese shippers and 3PLs forwarders tend to choose Taiwan as their logistics ports, given that the natural geographical advantage of Taiwan Strait which could offer close connection with the coastal seaports in the Mainland. Besides, Taiwan has its own national carriers that offer more control in routing cargo between Taiwan port and major ports in Mainland China. However, in light of global logistics, the logistics stakeholders should take the initiative to learn and adopt new policies, and push development of transshipment hubs. On the other hand, in order to attract more business opportunities, governments should provide a fair and transparent market with open legal and financial sys-tem to enhance the competitive advantages of their logistics ports. Thus, all business parties will embrace the new business models and benefit from it.\n\nThis study has sought to identify critical factors in selecting a transshipment hub, highlighting the assessment from the perspectives of shippers and freight forwarders, with the options of both sea and air transports, and from the influence of logistics stakeholder's country of origin. Relative importance of the key factors in transshipment hub selection is assessed by applying an AHP method to a sample of logistic stakeholders. The Direct Transportation Link policy in China is studied and its implementation is used as a backdrop case of global logistics strategy involving the role of transshipment hub in reliability and profitability. The policy change creates a significant research opportunity to build an understanding of threats as a result that can be viewed, processed and aligned strategically if necessary.\n\nIn our research findings, the cost of route, customs regulations & government policies, and connectivity are significantly important in transshipment hub selection across logistics service providers and cargo owners. These service providers, of both sea and air, view effective control over route planning is sound business strategy to service their clients. Moreover, the findings suggest that the competitiveness of a transshipment hub may not diminish with the spawn of other nearby ports, even if these ports offer obvious shorter transport distance and are within closer proximity to cargo sources.\n\nIt is also noted that uncertainties manifested by other explicit advantageous ports could translate to barriers such as uncontrollable delays and/or additional new costs to move forward, effectively hindering on the building of client satisfaction. Last but not least, governments must heed in their effort to facilitate one-stop hub services that improvement to the existing infrastructure and simplification of related regulations are two important factors.\n\nLogistics stakeholders, especially local contributors of the economy, could benefit from our findings as they can evaluate the business opportunities of ports accordingly and properly align to corporate strategy within. In future, more cross-sectional studies are needed in terms of alternative benefits of intermodal freight transport across all logistics stakeholders over different competing regions. It is also worthwhile to perform longitudinal studies to investigate the change of noted factors over an extended period of time."}
