Until February 19 th 2020, the total reported 80 Therefore, whether the Shanghai model has an impact on the epidemics dynamics and 97 disease control is an important reference to the other metropolises around the world. In 98 our study, we aimed to retrospectively describe the impact of diseases control on epidemics 99 dynamics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Shanghai, and to provide 100 valuable experience for other metropolises around the world. 101\n\nThis is a retrospective, single-center cohort study, recruiting all patients admitted to 105\n\nShanghai Public Health Center (SHPHC) diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 106 (COVID 2019) according to WHO interim guidance before Feb 7 th , 2020. According to the 107 arrangement of government, almost all adult patients from whole Shanghai were admitted 108 to SHPHC once coronavirus disease 2019 was confirmed by real-time PCR. 109\n\nThe study was approved by SHPHC ethics committee and oral consent was obtained from 110 patients. 111 112 All patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center diagnosed with coronavirus disease 113 COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance were enrolled in this study [10] . Two cohorts 114 were generated in this study, mild-moderate cohort and severe-critically ill cohort. All 115 COVID-19 patients are classified as mild to critically ill cases at admission, according to 116\n\nPeople's Republic of China. The classifying criteria was as follows: 118\n\nMild: Presenting mild symptoms and normal radiology manifestation in both lungs. 119\n\nModerate (typical): Presenting typical symptoms (fever, cough and other respiratory 120 symptoms) and radiology manifestation suggesting pneumonia. 121\n\nSevere: Presenting any one of the followings: 122 1) Respiratory distress, respiratory rates \u226530 per minute; 123 2) Pulse oxygen saturation \u226493% on room air 124 3) Oxygenation Index (PaO2/FiO2) \u2264300mmHg 125\n\nCritically ill: Presenting any one of the followings 126 1) Respiratory failure where invasive ventilation is necessary 127 2) Signs of shock (circulatory failure) 128\n\n3) Failure of any other organ where ICU care is necessary 129 130\n\nThe cumulative numbers of confirmed and suspected cases were collected from Shanghai 132 CDC, which were updated daily and publicly accessible. We obtained epidemiological, 133 demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data from patients' medical records. The 134 data were reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Information recorded included 135 demographic data, medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory 136 findings at baseline and chest x-ray or computed tomographic (CT) scans. The date of 137 disease onset was defined as the day when the symptom was noticed. 138 139\n\nThe incubation period distribution (i.e., the time delay from suspected contact to illness 141 onset), and the onset-to-admission distribution was estimated by fitting a Weibull 142 distribution to data on suspected exposure and onset dates in a subset of cases with 143 detailed information available. Categorical variables were described as frequencies and 144 percentages, and compared by Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test between two cohorts. 145\n\nContinuous variables were described as median and interquartile range (IQR) values. 146\n\nMeans for continuous variables were compared using independent group t-tests when the 147 data were normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. For 148 comparisons, a 2-sided \u03b1 of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results 149 of laboratory tests were also standardized and arranged by unsupervised hierarchical 150 clustering to identify the similarities, differences and characteristics, with Euclidean 151 distance measure and average linkage between groups methods. Statistical analyses were \n\nAs of February, 19 th 2020, a total number of 72,531 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been 159 reported according to reports from 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and 160 the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in mainland China. However, the number 161 of newly increased cases, especially in regions outside Hubei provinces, has gradually 162 decreased since February 5 th with the peak value of 3887. The same decreased trend can 163 be seen in the newly increased cases in Shanghai, with continuous declined growth rate 164 observed since February 4 th . The total confirmed cases number of COVID-19 cases was 165 333 as of February 19 th 2020, of which the percentage of COVID-19 cases without travel 166 history to Hubei province gradually surpassed 50%, according to the official report ( Figure  167 1-A).

In our study, the earliest symptom onset of all confirmed 170 patients can be traced back to January 6 th 2020. The development of the epidemic followed 171 an exponential growth and a decline in newly reported cases (Figure 2) . 172\n\nThe study examined data on suspected exposures among all 265 laboratory-173 confirmed cases with detailed, 37 of whom had credible information on contacts to 174 calculate the incubation period distribution. The mean incubation period is 6.4 days (95% 175 CI 5.3 to 7.6) and the 5th and 95th percentile of the distribution was 0.97 and 13.10, 176 respectively ( Figure 3 -A). The mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% CI, 5.1 177 to 5.9, SD 3.5). The 5th and 95th percentile of the distribution was 1 and 11.99, respectively 178 ( Figure 3-B) . 179\n\nWe performed an extensive analysis to February 9 th 2020 using the previously 180 reported predictive parameterized transmission models in Shanghai and compared with 181 the actual reported confirmed cases [11] [12] . The previous predictive model was based on 182 the hypothesis that no particular effective measures had been taken around the world and 183 the transmission among population had not been controlled. Our result showed that the 184 transmission rate within Shanghai had all decreased more than 95% than previously 185 speculated, suggesting that the prevention and control interventions taken by Shanghai 186 are of great impact on the overall control of the diseases during the current disease stage 187 ( Figure 1-B) . 188 189\n\nAll rights reserved.

By February 11 th , the proportion of patients being mile, moderate, sever 237 and critically ill were 1.9%(5/265), 89.8%(238/265), 3.8%(10/265), 4.5%(12/265), 238 respectively; 47 (17.7%) people in our cohort were discharged, and 1 (0.38%) patient died. 239\n\nOne of the critically ill patients was complicated with sepsis, two were treated with 240 continuous renal replacement therapies, three patients were on extra-corporeal membrane 241 oxygenation, and one patient recovered from severe disease to moderate condition. 242\n\nDiscussion 244\n\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case in Shanghai was reported in January 20 th , and 245 epidemic of Shanghai has experienced an increasing trend, during which the amplification 246 of the newly diagnosed cases per day was increasing continuously.

In Hubei, newly diagnosed cases were still 249 increasing in Hubei and on Feb 12 th , because the clinical diagnosis was included in the 250 guideline, the daily number of diagnosed patients had reached a spike of more than 10,000, 251 allowing many suspected who haven't the chance to be laboratory-confirmed to be 252 admitted to the hospital for treatment.

The reason behind this is that during this 258 epidemic, Chinese and Shanghai government has issued very strong and strict measures 259 in restricting the transmission in local regions. The national transport department 260 announced a 45% and 70.6% decline in the passenger flow at the beginning and the end 261 of 2020 Spring Festival, respectively [13] [14] . What's more, Shanghai government 262 cancelled all gathering activities and through propaganda of the officials, media and 263 community, citizens were well-informed and well-educated of the importance of wearing 264 face masks and washing hands frequently. Previous studies have suggested that the 265 mobility reduction could not effectively lower the incidence rate while 50% transmissibility 266 reduction could easily prevent the epidemics from further spreading [12] . In the case of 267 Shanghai, the transmissibility was indeed greatly reduced, however, we believe the 268 mobility reduction also played an indirect role in lowering the transmissibility. This is 269 because that Chinese Spring Festival is characterized by hundreds of millions of people 270 transporting from one region to another, and this massive gathering at the airports, train 271 stations during transportation, if not controlled, would significantly increase the human to 272 human transmission. Therefore, during this special period, controlling both mobility and 273 transmissibility might be important. Other doubt lies in that previous studies have reported 274 that the ascertainment rate in Wuhan is 5.1% [11] , and suggested that other cities such as 275 Shanghai, Beijing have the similar ascertainment rate, which would lead to our local case 276 numbers fall below the true ones. However, in Shanghai for example, the suspected cases 277\n\nwere approximately 20 folds of the laboratory-confirmed cases. Thus we expected the 278 ascertainment rate outside Hubei province was closer to the actual epidemic size. But in 279 the end, the disease prevention and control of the regions outside Hubei province would 280 always heavily rely on the diminish of the epidemic in Hubei province, and the combination 281 of Hubei epidemic control and strong measures to prevent local clustered cases outside 282\n\nHubei will be the key to success. 283\n\nIn areas outside Hubei, the epidemics has transmitted from the first stage, in which 284 imported cases composed of the main laboratory-confirmed cases, to the second stage, 285\n\nwhere imported cases and local sporadic or even clustered cases were simultaneously 286 seen while imported cases from Hubei province gradually reduced due to the region shut 287 down. In fact, clusters of cases within China and around the world without Hubei travelling 288 history have been reported, indicating the shifting of the epidemic characteristics globally. 289\n\nIn our study, we found that local cases increased approximately 5 days after the first the 290 imported cases, possibly due to the incubation period after these local cases were infected. 291 Also, the proportion of patients with a travel history to Hubei has gradually decreased, and 292 the proportion of patients without a travel history to in Hubei has gradually increased. This 293 suggests that strengthening prevention of local sporadic or clustered cases in areas 294 outside Hubei in the future will be crucial for the second-stage epidemic control outside 295\n\nHubei province. 296\n\nIn our study, the incubation period is similar as other studies previously reported, but 297 the mean onset-admission interval was 5.478 days, shorter than 12.5 day initially reported 298\n\nin Wuhan [15] , suggesting the timely control and prevention of the diseases spreading. One 299 reason behind this is the improvement of the diagnostic ability of the disease, mainly the 300 All rights reserved.

Routine chest CT examinations at 303 admission revealed pneumonia in all of them. Therefore, these patients can only be 304 considered asymptomatic but not in incubation. Although there was a reported case of 305 incubation time up to 24 day [16], we believe that it is necessary to clarify whether an 306 imaging assessment was performed before the onset of symptoms in this patient. However, 307\n\nit is worth noting that, at the epidemiological level, these asymptomatic patients are almost 308 the same as those in the incubation period. A positive nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR for 309 COVID-19 in these patients suggests that they do have the potential to infect others. We 310 therefore believe that more active inspections and evaluations of close contacts should be 311\n\nThe proportion of severe and critically ill patients in Shanghai was significantly lower 313 than that in Wuhan. We consider the proportion of patients with severe illness to be a very 314 important indicator of the disease. First, regional mortality rate varies widely in the early 315 stages of the disease outbreak because it is affected by many factors, such as life support 316 equipment for critically ill patients and local medical conditions. In the absence of effective 317 antiviral drugs, the proportion of critically ill patients depicts the natural course of the 318 disease better than the mortality rate. Second, because the final clinical outcome of 319 majority of the reported cases is typically unknown during a growing epidemic, dividing the 320 cumulative reported deaths by reported cases will underestimate the mortality rate early in 321 an epidemic [17] . We believe that the proportion of severe illness in Wuhan is biased 322 towards detecting severe cases, partly because diagnostic capacity is limited at the start 323 of an epidemic. Because of Shanghai's active surveillance, especially for suspected cases 324 with recent travel history to the affected region and close contacts, demonstrating by 325 shorter onset-administration interval and 4% asymptomatic patients on admission, 326\n\nShanghai should have picked up clinically milder cases as well as the more severe cases 327 resulting a more reliable proportion of critically ill patients. To reduce the bias cause by mild 328 case in early stage, we calculated the proportion of critically ill patients among those with 329 an onset of 14 days or more, since more than 95% sever cases in Shanghai developed 330 before that time. That proportion of 9.6% is substantially lower than SARS or MERS. The 331 early clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients in Shanghai were similar to those 332 reported in Wuhan and elsewhere [7] [8] [9] . 333\n\nOur study showed relatively comprehensive laboratory test results in the published 334 studies. Assessed through this systematic inspection, we can find that sever COVID-19 335 cases had extensive systemic laboratory abnormalities which indicated multisystem 336 involvement had existed before significant respiratory abnormalities appeared. Previous 337 studies have found that most patients had reduced lymphocytes and abnormal levels of 338 many cytokines in critically ill patients [8, 16] . Lymphocyte classification in our study showed 339 that CD4 and CD8 cells both decreased in COVID-19 patients, and ~15% patients had 340 CD4 / CD8 <1. This may be related to a systemic inflammatory response caused by a 341 cytokine storm, which is similar to that of SARS patients. The severity classification of 342 COVID-19 patients in China mainly focuses on the respiratory system and oxygenation of 343 patients. We believe more attention should be paid to other organs function of the patient 344 in addition to the respiratory system. As follow-up continues, we can observe the outcome 345 of more and more patients, and it should be possible to identify early risk factors that 346 indicate a poor prognosis. 347\n\nOur study has several limitations. First, as the epidemics has not ended yet, the 348 effect of the control measures cannot be fully evaluated. Second, as most patients are 349 still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission, clinical outcome remains to be 350 seen. Third, we did not measure cytokines and viral loads, which may be related to 351 disease progression and severity. 352\n\nStrict measures on controlling disease transmissibility in a metropolis can quickly reduce 354 the spread of a new infectious diseases to polar levels and stop its exponential growth in 355 the short term. Controlling the local clusters is the key to prevent outbreaks due to imported 356 cases. Our studies showed that the incubation period for COVID-19 is 6.438 days and 9.6% 357 of COVID-19 cases were severe cases. The median time for COVID-19 progressing to 358 severe diseases was 8.5 days and multiple systemic laboratory abnormalities which 359 indicated multisystem involvement had been observed before significant respiratory 360 abnormalities appeared. 361 362 363\n\nOral consent was obtained was obtained from the patients.\n\nFunding 367\n\nThis study was not funded. 368 369\n\nWe acknowledge all health-care workers involved in the diagnosis and treatment of 374 patients and show the greatest appreciation to all health workers for their valuable input to 375 the control of diseases. 376 377 378 379 The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the symptom was noticed. 389 390 391 392 393 All rights reserved.
