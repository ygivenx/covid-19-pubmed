{"title": "The phylogeny of SARS coronavirus Brief Report", "body": "Summary. Different tree-building methods consistently place the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as a basal Group 2 coronavirus rather than as an ungrouped species as concluded by others. Detailed comparisons of the SARS-CoV genomic sequence with those of six other coronaviruses failed to find evidence of recombination or genomic rearrangement using computational methods designed for that purpose. * In their report of the SARS-CoV genomic sequence, Marra et al. [4] constructed unrooted phylogenetic trees by boot strapped distance methods using the encoded major protein sequences of SARS-CoV and representatives of the three coronavirus groups and reported that those encoded by SARS-CoV \"do not cluster more closely with any one group\", and concluded that SARS-CoV should \"be considered the first representative of \"Group 4\" coronaviruses\". Likewise Rota et al. [5] using the same methods reported that SARS-CoV \"is approximately equidistant from all previously characterized coronaviruses\" and \"forms a distinct group within the genus Coronavirus\". However neither of those studies had outgroup sequences in the analyses, and therefore it was not possible to be sure whether SARS-CoV showed consistent relationships with other coronaviruses.\n\nThe largest gene of the SARS-CoV genome is that which encodes the multifunctional polymerase and comprises 70.7% of the genome, and the next largest is the spike (peplomer) gene, a further 12.7%. We found the polymerase genes of the arteriviruses to be clearly homologous to those of coronaviruses as GenBank searches using BLASTX gave E values around 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124\u22125 between arterivirus and coronavirus sequences, and they therefore provide an appropriate outgroup to 622 A. J. Gibbs et al. coronavirus polymerases, however similar searches using BLASTN \u2212X and \u2212P failed to find outgroup sequences for the spike protein gene.\n\nThe complete polymerase genes of SARS-CoV, six other coronaviruses and two arteriviruses were aligned [3, 8] either as amino acids or as nucleotides, or as nucleotides grouped as codons. The resulting gapped nucleotide sequences had one or more sequences with gaps at over 50% of the homologous positions, so separate comparisons were made of the fully gapped sequences, the parts of the alignment present in all sequences, and also the gap-containing parts that had been removed when degapping. Trees obtained by the neighbor-joining method and, especially, using a maximum-likelihood algorithm [7] (Fig. 1) , placed \n\nThis topology is totally consistent with those of the trees reported in the first SARS-CoV sequence analyses [4, 5] if we assume that they have the same root, and it is also consistent with rootless trees calculated from the spike protein genes.\n\nThe taxonomy of the remaining 16.6% of the SARS-CoV genome is less certain. For example, whereas taxonomies place the nucleocapsid proteins in the same topology as the polymerase and spike genes, the nucleocapsid genes (4.3% of the SARS-CoV genome) place SARS-CoV as sister to IBV.\n\nThe SARS-CoV genomic sequence was also compared with those of the three most closely related coronaviruses, MHV, BCV and IBV, in pairwise dotplots [2, 6] using a window of 25 nucleotides. These comparisons showed that the SARS-CoV genome is co-linear with those of the other three coronaviruses, and is not significantly rearranged, and although, when the sequence was compared with itself, many regions of short repetitions were found, none were significantly different from those in the other three coronavirus genomes.\n\nGroup 2 coronaviruses differ from other coronaviruses in possessing a haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene between the polymerase and spike protein genes. This has presumably been acquired recently but is of unknown origin [10] . Differences in the enzymic specificity of the HE gene, and congruent gene sequence differences, place Group 2 coronaviruses into two sub-groups; the MHV-like (Group 2a) and BCV-like (Group 2b) viruses [10] . We therefore suggest that it will be most useful to consider SARS-CoV as a Group 2c coronavirus, and to represent the original Group 2 lineage from which the Group 2a and 2b lineages were derived after acquiring a progenitor HE gene rather than as the first species of a novel group, as an emphasis on taxonomic similarities, rather than differences, may generate more useful predictions.\n\nWe also examined the aligned sequences using the SiScan [1] and PhylPro [9] programs that are specifically designed to detect the phylogenetic anomalies resulting from recombination, and found no significant anomalies with subsequences as short as 100 nts, irrespective of whether all differences or just synonymous or non-synonymous differences were examined.\n\nA study that found the same phylogenetic placement of SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses using a different outgroup sequence and different algorithms has been reported by Snijder "}
