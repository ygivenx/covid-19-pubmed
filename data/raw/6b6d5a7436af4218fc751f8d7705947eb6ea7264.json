{"title": "Global site-specific analysis of glycoprotein N-glycan processing", "body": "Asparagine-linked-glycans (N-glycans) are among the most common and important post-translational modifications of proteins. They have critical roles in the folding, conformation and stability of the proteins themselves 1,2 , and participate as ligands in intraand intercellular recognition and host-pathogen interactions 3, 4 . Altered biosynthesis of N-glycans has been associated with many diseases, such as cancer 5, 6 , influenza [7] [8] [9] , and AIDS [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . For example, increased levels of underprocessed high-mannose-type glycans have been reported to occur during breast cancer progression in both mice and humans 6 . Some broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) of the highly glycosylated HIV envelope glycoprotein include underprocessed high-mannose glycans in their epitopes, whereas others require fully processed complex-type structures containing sialic acid 11, 15 . As the structures of N-glycans affect the activity and pharmacodynamics of glycoprotein biotherapeutics 16 , careful choice of cell lines used to express proteins 10 , growth conditions 17 , and purification methods [18] [19] [20] to control the consistency of N-glycosylation is needed.\n\nGiven the importance of N-glycans to the structure and functions of glycoproteins, there is increasing need for robust methods for analysis of N-linked glycosylation that can be integrated with state of the art proteomics. Complicating the analysis is the inherent diversity of N-glycan structures present on any glycoprotein, which is a consequence of the non-template-driven biosynthesis. It begins with the en bloc transfer of Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 from a lipid-linked glycosyl donor to the nascent polypeptide by an oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) to a sequence-defined glycosite, Asn-X-Thr/Ser (where X can be any amino acid residue except proline). Although none of the proteins analyzed in the present study contains an atypical glycosylation site (N-X-Cys/Val), these sites have been verified in previous studies by the presence of glycans on intact glycopeptides 21, 22 . As illustrated in Figure 1 , the glycan is then subjected to trimming by removal of the glucose residues to a high-mannose-type glycan, then further trimming to the conserved Man 3 GlcNAc 2 core, followed by addition of sugars by the sequential action of glycosyltransferases that produce a highly related set of complex-type structures (Fig. 1) . Moreover, for glycoproteins with more than one glycosite, processing at each site may differ based on the access of the glycans to the processing enzymes. Indeed, well documented examples of proteins that contain high-mannose-type glycans at one or more glycosites, and highly processed complex-type glycans at other sites are IgM 23, 24 , influenza hemagglutinin 8, 25, 26 , and the HIV envelope glycoprotein 10, [27] [28] [29] .\n\nMajor limitations of this approach are the relatively low abundance of glycopeptides in the protein digest mixture, as well as the inherent low ionization efficiency of glycopeptides during MS analysis 40, 41, 49, 50 . For these reasons, glycopeptides are typically enriched from peptide digests prior to MS analysis with different purification methods, such as hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) 29, 51, 52 and hydrazide chemistry 40 . Despite the use of different fragmentation methods, including collision-induced dissociation (CID), high-energy collision dissociation (HCD), and electron-transfer dissociation (ETD), the inherent heterogeneity of glycoforms at each glycosylation site, as well as difficulties in obtaining good peptide backbone fragmentations for peptides with large glycans, impedes comprehensive identification of intact glycopeptides 28, 30 . Annotation of LC-MS/MS data from such experiments is possible by using commercial algorithms such as Byonic (http://www.proteinmetrics.com/products/byonic/). However, quantitative assessment of the relative abundance of the glycan structures detected at each glycosite is still a substantial challenge due to unknown ionization efficiencies for peptides with each glycoform, especially for those with sialic acidcontaining structures 38 . Moreover, if the glycopeptides are enriched prior to analysis, peptides with no glycan are lost, and the degree of glycosite occupancy cannot be assessed.\n\nThe protocol described here arose from the need of the HIV vaccine effort for robust semiquantitative glycoproteomics methods that would: (i) establish the occupancy of N-glycans at each glycosite and (ii) assess the degree to which glycans were processed from high-mannose type to complex type. The need stems from the fact that the primary candidate for a vaccine is the HIV envelope glycoprotein trimer (Env) that contains 75-90 N-glycans, creating a glycan shield to protect against attack by the immune system 53, 54 . Despite the dense cover of N-glycans, bnAbs that bind to HIV Env do occur in 10-30% of HIV-1-infected patients 55, 56 . Importantly, some bnAbs show interactions with high-mannose glycans 57, 58 , whereas others show dependence on complex-type glycans 12, 15, 59, 60 . Thus, to support the rational design of an HIV Env vaccine, we developed a method that could assess the proportion of high-mannose-type and complex-type N-glycans at each glycosite on the HIV Env 10 . However, as demonstrated here, the method is broadly applicable to any glycoprotein.\n\nOne of the key aspects of our method is the sequential use of two endoglycosidase treatments to introduce unique mass signatures for glycosites that carry no glycan, high-mannose/hybridtype glycans, and complex-type glycans, as illustrated in Figure 2a . After protease digestion, endoglycosidase H (Endo H) is used to remove all high-mannose-and hybrid-type N-glycans that have at least 5 mannose residues (Fig. 1) . This enzyme leaves a GlcNAc-Asn residue that adds +203 to the peptide mass. Subsequently, the remaining complex N-glycans are removed with PNGase F in the presence of H 2 O 18 , which both removes the glycan and converts Asn to Asp, with a +3 addition to the peptide mass. Peptides carrying glycosites (Asn-X-Thr/Ser) with Asn (unoccupied), GlcNAc-Asn (Endo H-treated), or Asp (PNGase F-treated), display similar ionization efficiencies during MS analysis 10, 45 , allowing us to use ion intensity peak area to quantify the relative distribution of the three glycosylation states at each glycosite detected 10, 61 . Another distinguishing feature of the method is the use of multiple proteases, which can generate up to thousands of spectra hits for each glycosite, resulting in >95% sequence coverage. This simple strategy effectively converts the glycoproteomics analysis to a proteomics analysis, allowing the use of robust proteomics software to analyze data in a high-throughput manner. A major advantage of this method is that it provides a glimpse into the site occupancy and processing of N-glycans at each glycosylation site 10 . It provides a semiquantitative analysis of the three glycosylation states, and a complete analysis can be conducted on only 30 \u00b5g of protein, even for complex glycoproteins such as HIV Env, comprising up to 30 glycosites per monomer. It should be noted that hybrid structures, which can potentially contain sialic acid (see Fig. 1 ), are included in the high-mannose-type category because they are cleaved by Endo H. However, hybrid structures typically have low abundance 29, 48 .\n\nOne major limitation of the method is that glycan structures are removed before LC-MS/MS, and the class of the glycan is inferred by the specificities of the endoglycosidases. MS/MS methods based on analysis of intact glycopeptides provide more information on the spectra of glycans at individual glycosites [27] [28] [29] 62 , and are complementary to this protocol, which provides semiquantitative information on site occupancy and glycan processing. However, neither method provides the precise structure complete with glycosidic linkages between monosaccharides. Although this protocol is designed for site-specific glycosylation analysis of purified glycoproteins, it is, in principle, applicable to more-complex protein samples, such as membrane-enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV, influenza virus, coronavirus) that comprise only 10-12 proteins. However, as described in the 'Experimental design' section, modification of the protocol would be needed to survey glycosites in more complex samples such as cells or human serum.\n\nThe procedure for site-specific analysis of glycoprotein N-glycan processing is summarized in Figure 2b and consists of the following key stages.\n\nIn the first stage, buffer exchange for glycoproteins is needed if they are dissolved in the buffers that contain nonvolatile salts (Steps 1-12). Glycoproteins are then denatured and alkylated at pH 6 (Steps 13-17) to minimize non-enzymatic deamidation while retaining protein sequence coverage. Proteins are digested with several different protease treatments, including 'triple digestion' , chymotrypsin, and a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin, in order to maximize sequence coverage and increase the confidence of detecting each glycosite (Step 18).\n\nIn the second stage (Steps 19-25), proteases are denatured by heating to prevent incorporation of 18 O-water into the C termini of peptides during the subsequent PNGase F treatment.\n\nIn the third stage (Steps 26-36), sequential endoglycosidase treatment is employed to create unique mass signatures relative to the predicted amino acid sequence, for peptide glycosites that are not occupied (+0 Da) or that are occupied by highmannose/hybrid-(+203 Da) or complex-type glycans (+3 Da) (Fig. 2a) .\n\nThe resulting samples are subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis (Step 37). Data processing for identification and quantitation of peptides for the three glycosylation states is done using the Integrated Proteomics Pipeline (IP2) software package (stage 5, Steps 41-53). The MS1 and MS2 data are extracted from MS raw files with RawConverter and processed using multiple components from the IP2 software package (Steps 38-53).\n\nOver the past decade there has been substantial progress in sitespecific glycosylation analysis of purified glycoproteins 8,27-29, 45,48,62-64 . Exemplary, and perhaps the most relevant to this protocol, is the work on HIV-1 Env by the Desaire and Cripsin groups [27] [28] [29] 62 . The methods developed by the two groups focus on characterizing intact glycopeptides with or without enrichment of glycopeptides prior to MS analysis, and thus can provide complementary information about individual glycoforms at each glycosite. However, milligram quantities of material may be required for their methods, which is attributed in part to the relatively low ionization efficiencies of glycopeptides and in part to the fact that each glycopeptide is actually a mixture of many different glycoforms 28, 29 . Although the complexity is reduced by using only two proteases, chymotrypsin and trypsin, identification of all forms of a glycopeptide with multiple N-glycans is still a challenge, even when using a combination of CID and ETD for fragmentation 27, 28 . Quantitative measurements are also challenging, due to unknown ionization of glycopeptides with different N-glycan species during MS analysis. Moreover, there is limited information about site occupancy, due to markedly different ionization efficiencies between peptides and the corresponding glycopeptides, and/or enrichment of glycopeptides prior to MS analysis.\n\nOther methods that use endoglycosidases to identify glycosites have long been in use 40, 41, 44 by binding to hydrazide-activated beads, or are enriched using lectins. The peptides are then released using PNGase F, in which glycosylated asparagine is converted to aspartic acid (+1 Da mass shift), allowing indirect identification of glycosites in the released peptides 40, 41 . Alternatively, for a purified protein, PNGase F can be applied directly, and site occupancy of glycosylation sites can be determined by measuring the ratio of peptides with glycosites containing asparagine to aspartic acid during ESI-MS analysis 28 . By comparison with the protocol described here, addition of a second endoglycosidase, Endo H, provides additional information about the extent of glycan processing, in addition to the degree of site occupancy.\n\nProteolysis with a combination of proteases. Glycoproteins are denatured and alkylated at pH 6 instead of a mildly alkaline pH to minimize the non-enzymatic deamidation of Asn to Asp, which can complicate data analysis 65 . To maximize sequence coverage, a number of different protease digestions are used, including digestion by chymotrypsin, a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin, and combinations of Arg-C, trypsin, elastase and subtilisin ('triple digestion') 66 (Step 18) . Of note, a combination of all proteolytic digestions is essential for detecting all glycosites on heavily glycosylated proteins with large molecular weights, such as the HIV Env trimer and the spike glycoprotein of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV S-2P protein). Triple digestion alone is able to identify all glycosites in glycoproteins containing only a few glycosites, whereas for most glycoproteins, a combination of triple digestion and chymotrypsin is enough to generate detectable peptides that contain all the glycosylation sites 10 . Another benefit of the use of multiple proteases, including trypsin and nonspecific proteases, is that it produces a sequence ladder that contains a series of peptides with variable numbers of amino acid residues on both sides of glycosite, allowing for highly confident identification for a given glycosite (Supplementary Table 1 ). For single glycoproteins or simple mixtures (e.g., viruses), the use of multiple proteases allows for much higher confident detection and semiquantitative analysis of the three states of glycosylation for each glycosite. However, for more-complex mixtures (e.g., cells, plasma) use of specific proteases such as trypsin will result in reduced complexity and the identification of glycosites while retaining the ability to detect the three different glycosylation states.\n\nAnother key aspect of the protocol is that only volatile salts, such as ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium acetate, are used, so that no column purification is needed, resulting in high specificity of the protocol (requires ~30 \u00b5g of starting material).\n\nIn the next stage, PNGase F treatment is employed for deglycosylation of glycoproteins, resulting in conversion of Asn to Asp upon removal of the carbohydrate, and a mass change of +3 when carried out in O 18 -water (Steps [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Residual active trypsin and other proteases used for proteolysis can incorporate O 18 into the C termini of the peptides during the deglycosylation step 67 , resulting in a high false-positive identification of peptides that may have glycosites. To avoid this, we denature all proteases used in the protocol by heating to 100 \u00b0C prior to the deglycosylation steps.\n\nSequential endoglycosidase treatment. Sequential treatment of glycopeptides with Endo H followed by PNGase F is employed to generate different mass signatures for glycosites that contain no glycan (+0), high-mannose/hybrid-type glycan (+203), and complex-type glycan (+3) (Steps 26-36, Fig. 2a) . The endoglycosidase digestions are highly efficient and progress rapidly to completion, so the deglycosylation reactions are conducted for 1 h to minimize non-enzymatic deamidation that can occur during this step. Removal of N-glycans increases the ionization efficiencies of peptides and allows us to localize glycosylation sites on peptides with multiple modifications, which is challenging for analysis of intact glycopeptides (Supplementary Fig. 1 ).\n\nIn principle, the deglycosylated peptides can then be analyzed by any type of LC-MS/MS (Step 37). A high-resolution mass spectrometer, such as the Orbitrap Elite, provides satisfactory sequence coverage for most glycoproteins. An instrument with a higher scan speed, such as an Orbitrap Fusion or Orbitrap Lumos, is more sensitive and generates several times more MS/MS spectra for a given sample than an Orbitrap Elite. Thus, they are able to provide site-specific glycan-processing information for those sites that may be missed in the results generated by the Orbitrap Elite as a result of heavy glycosylation and the large molecular weights of the glycoproteins. Although single-dimension separation is sufficient for characterization of site-specific glycosylation of purified proteins, multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT), in which peptides are systematically separated based on the charge in the first dimension and hydrophobicity in the second, will accelerate measurement of site-specific N-glycan processing of glycoproteins in these complex protein samples 68 .\n\nIdeally, each glycoprotein is digested in at least two technical replicates and analyzed by the same MS instrument. Invertase produced by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein from bovine serum are known to be occupied by high-mannose-type and complex-type glycans, respectively, and can be used as controls to test completion of endoglycosidase treatment. As a check on the overall success of the protocol, non-enzymatic deamidation of Asn residues and/or O 18 -incorpation at the C terminus should be seen in <5% of the total peptides. 6| Pipette 100 \u00b5l of 100 mM ammonium acetate into the filter.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Urea (8\n\nCentrifuge the device at 8,000g for 50 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n\n8| Repeat Steps 6 through 7 at least two times. \ue06d crItIcal step To complete the buffer exchange, it is important to extensively wash the filter that contains glycoproteins (at least three times) with 100 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6). \ue06d crItIcal step To minimize non-enzymatic deamidation, the acidic buffer, 100 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6), should be used instead of mildly alkaline buffers during buffer exchange.\n\n9| Wash the filter membrane with 100 \u00b5l of 100 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6).\n\n10| Collect the solution and store it in a low-protein-binding microcentrifuge tube.\n\n11| Repeat Steps 9 and 10 at least four times and combine the fractions. \ue06d crItIcal step Wash the filter membrane with the buffer at least five times after buffer exchange in order to achieve maximum recovery of proteins. \ue06a pause poInt The solution can be stored up to 1 week at \u221280 \u00b0C or in liquid nitrogen.\n\n12| Lyophilize 500 \u00b5l of the solution at room temperature for at least 5 h. \ue06d crItIcal step If volatile salts such as ammonium acetate are added to the buffer, it is important to completely remove them with the lyophilizer.\n\nDissolve the glycoprotein in 100 \u00b5l of 8 M urea in 100 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6) and place the solution at room temperature for 1 h. \ue06d crItIcal step The acidic buffer, 100 mM ammonium acetate, should be used for sample preparation instead of mildly alkaline buffers, if possible, in order to keep non-enzymatic deamidation to a minimum.\n\n14| Add 2 \u00b5l of 500 mM DTT (to a final concentration of ~10 mM) and incubate the solution at 56 \u00b0C for 1 h. \ue06d crItIcal step Spin down (1,000g, 25 \u00b0C, 1 min) all the solution from the walls of microcentrifuge tube before adding DTT.\n\n15| Add 11 \u00b5l of freshly prepared 500 mM iodoacetamide (to a final concentration of ~50 mM) and incubate the solution in the dark at room temperature for 45 min. \ue06d crItIcal step To preserve activity of iodoacetamide, prepare iodoacetamide solution immediately before use, as it is unstable.

Of note, ~2 \u00b5m of purified glycoproteins are loaded onto the column in the present study. This value was empirically determined as optimal to distinguish information from spectral noise and will vary from instrument to instrument. A control experiment should be done by using well-characterized model glycoproteins such as invertase (occupied by high-mannose glycans) and \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein (occupied by complex-type glycans) before setting the peak area threshold. Peak area values will be dependent on the type of LC system and mass spectrometer used, and the appropriate threshold will need to be determined for other instrument types.\n\n? trouBlesHootInG 52| Combine the data derived from two or three technical replicates after analysis of each MS run separately. \n\nThis protocol is used to determine site-specific N-glycan processing of glycoproteins. In the most widely used strategy, glycoproteins are digested with specific proteases such as trypsin, resulting in (glyco)peptides that are suitable for LC-MS/MS analysis. Glycosylated peptides, however, have much lower ionization efficiency during MS analysis relative to peptides, and thus milligram quantities of materials are generally used for typical glycoproteomics methods 29, 61 . Characterization of glycopeptides with multiple glycosites by MS/MS is still challenging, even with combination of different types of fragmentation techniques 28 . Quantitative measurement of glycopeptides is complicated by the fact that ionization efficiencies of glycopeptides differ with variable glycoforms 38 . This protocol describes an alternative way to overcome these problems by the use of combination proteolytic digestion followed by sequential endoglycosidase treatment.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of this protocol is the use of sequential treatment of glycopeptides with endoglycosidases (Endo H followed by PNGase F) to create unique mass signatures for glycosites that have no N-glycan, high-mannose-type glycan, or complex-type glycan. This strategy converts the glycoproteomics analysis to a proteomics analysis, resulting in higher sensitivity of the protocol (only 30 \u00b5g of sample is needed for a complete analysis). The key to success is that the sequential endoglycosidase treatments proceed to completion, avoiding mis-assignment of N-glycan processing status.\n\nTo this end, we applied the protocol to assess site-specific N-glycan processing of two well-characterized model glycoproteins, invertase produced by the yeast S. cerevisiae and \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein from bovine serum 70 . Glycosites on invertase are occupied by underprocessed oligomannose, and those on \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein are fully processed complex-type glycosylation (Fig. 3) . All N-glycosites on both glycoproteins were identified with multiple MS/MS spectra ranging from 54 to >10,000 per site (supplementary tables 2 and 3) . Low percentages of spectra hits that contain non-enzymatic deamidation or 18 O-incorporation into the C termini of peptides were found among all spectra hits identified, which is attributed to the complete denaturation of proteases used (supplementary tables 4 and 5). As described in the procedure section, as well as the previous study 10 , a set of peptides with N+0, N+3, and N+203 modifications was considered only when at least one of the three had a peak area of at least 5 \u00d7 10 8 . As expected, the 14 N-glycosites of invertase were identified as entirely high-mannose-type glycosylation, and site occupancy was >90% for all glycosites except the sites N64 and N275 (Fig. 3a,b) . By contrast, the five N-glycosites of \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein were completely complex-type glycosylation, and site occupancy was >98% for all five sites (Fig. 3c,d) . These results indicated that sequential endoglycosidase treatment reached completion.\n\nAnother major assumption is that the endoglycosidase-treated peptide glycosites that are unoccupied or occupied by high-mannose glycans or complex-type glycans are detected equally during MS analysis. To test this assumption, the HIV-1 Env trimer BG505 SOSIP.664, expressed in the presence of kifunensine (high-mannose only), was selected as a model protein (hereafter referred to as Kif_BG505). N-glycans on Kif_BG505 were first removed by sequential endoglycosidase treatment, and as expected, glycosites comprised >95% high-mannose-type glycosylation (green bars), indicating that the kifunensine treatment was effective and Kif_BG505 had high-mannose glycans (Fig. 4a) . On the other hand, PNGase F treatment only was also applied to release N-glycans on Kif_BG505, resulting in peptides with homogeneous N+3 modification (>98% of purple bars, Fig. 4b) . The resulting two samples were then mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1 in order to assess MS detection of glycotypes (Fig. 4c) . Peptides with N+3 and N+203 modifications are both detectable for each glycosite, with a ratio of 1.0 to 1.2, suggesting slightly increased sensitivity for peptides with the N+3 modification. Synthetic peptides that carry asparagine (unoccupied), aspartic acid (PNGase F-treated), and N-acetylglucosamine-linked asparagine residues at the glycosylation site, display similar ionization efficiencies during ESI-MS analysis, further indicating that the protocol is able to semiquantitatively assess site-specific N-glycan processing for glycoproteins 61 . Although the protocol was initially developed for analysis of site-specific N-glycan processing of the HIV Env trimer 10 , it is applicable to analysis of site-specific N-glycan processing of recombinant glycoprotein therapeutics (Fig. 5a,b) , serum glycoproteins (Fig. 5c,d) , and soluble or membrane-bound envelope glycoproteins from viruses (Fig. 6) . It is also likely to be useful in characterization of glycoprotein processing in more complex systems such as whole cells due to its high sensitivity. Site-specific N-glycan processing of recombinantly produced therapeutic glycoproteins, including IgG and IgM, was determined ( Fig. 5a,b) . Human serum IgG, which contains IgG1-4 with IgG1 and IgG2 as the major isotypes, was found to be entirely complex-type glycosylation, consistent with previous studies (Fig. 5a) 32, 49, 52 . Of the five N-glycosites on IgM, which is the major antibody produced in the primary immune response, three sites were shown to be completely occupied by complex-type structures (N171, N332, and N395), whereas the other two sites, N402 and N563, were primarily highmannose-type glycosylation (Fig. 5b) . The glycosite N563 that is proximal to the CH4 domain and thus is a poor substrate for OST was found to be partially glycosylated, in agreement with previous studies 24,71 . Abnormal glycosylation of serum glycoproteins is a common feature in various human diseases, such as cancers and congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). In particular, serum transferrin was first used to diagnose abnormal glycosylation in CDG patients in the 1990s 72 . Normal transferrin has two N-glycosylation sites, each of which is fully occupied 73, 74 , whereas in type I CDGs, an increase of mono-glycosylated transferrin was found due to defects of oligosaccharide assembly and transfer to glycoproteins in those patients 75 . Analysis of site-specific N-glycan processing of commercially available human serum transferrin revealed that the two glycosites of this protein were entirely complex-type glycosylation (Fig. 5c) , in line with the previous studies 73, 74 . Another serum glycoprotein, fetuin, was also found to be entirely complex-type glycosylation, with full occupancy of two sites (N99 and N156) and partial glycosylation of the third glycosite (N176, 89% of site occupancy, Fig. 5d) .\n\nMembrane-bound envelope glycoproteins of various viruses, such as MERS-CoV S-2P protein and HIV Env trimer, are the target of neutralizing antibodies, and thus are the focus of vaccine development 55, 69 . N-linked glycans on those envelope glycoproteins serve as a shield to protect the underlying protein from immune surveillance and thus confound development of effective vaccines for those viruses 54 . Importantly, some neutralizing antibodies to those viruses have glycan-dependent epitopes 15, 57, 69 , suggesting that vaccine design efforts would benefit greatly from understanding the N-glycan processing status at each glycosylation site. MERS-CoV S-2P protein is a large trimer (~600 kDa) with ~25 N-linked glycans per monomer, each of which comprises two noncovalently associated subunits, S1 and S2 69 . Characterization of site-specific Nglycan processing of a prefusion-stabilized MERS-CoV S-2P protein ectodomain (MERS S-2P) revealed that all 23 glycosites on the protein were fully occupied, except for the N104 site (Fig. 6a) . High-mannose glycans were predominantly found in the S1-NTD (residues 18-353), whereas other regions of the S protein, including the RBD (367-588), the two subdomains (589-751), and S2 (752-1,291), contained glycosites occupied largely by complex-type glycans (Fig. 6a) . The glycan N1176, which is in the epitope for antibody G4 and was reported to mask antibody recognition 69 , was found to have a complex-type structure. Of note, we did not observe that the proteases used had biases on specific glycotypes . 2) . Of the 12 glycosites on the recombinant influenza haemagglutinin (HA) of A/ Victoria/361/2011, three were >85% high-mannose (N45, N165, and N285), four were fully complex-type glycosylation (N22, N38, N63, and N483), and the rest were occupied by a mixture of high-mannose and complex-type glycans (Fig. 6b) .\n\nIt is striking to observe that the site N122 was not occupied and another site N144 was only 32% occupied on this HA glycoprotein. We also applied the protocol to the benchmark HIV Env trimer BG505 SOSIP.664, resulting in identification of all 28 glycosites with up to 2,000 spectra hits per glycosite (Fig. 6c) . All 28 glycosites were >90% occupied, except the sites N185e, N197, N618, and N625. Of those that were largely occupied, 14 were >75% high-mannose, four were >75% complex-type glycosylation, and six other sites had a mixture of high-mannose and complex-type glycans. In particular, the glycosites, N295, N332, N339, N386, and N392, in the high-mannose patch region, were found to be occupied predominantly by underprocessed oligomannose, consistent with previous studies 14, 76 . The N160 glycan, which is critical for binding of the bnAbs PG9 and PG16 to HIV Env, was composed predominantly of high-mannose structures, confirming the glycan composition at this site described in previous structural studies 58, 77, 78 . Interestingly, the highmannose and complex-type glycans identified at each glycosylation site of BG505 SOSIP.664 matched the pathway of N-glycan processing, in which high-mannose structures are first trimmed from Man 9 to Man 5 before addition of the terminal monosaccharides that define complex-type/hybrid glycans, as compared to the results of the same protein obtained on intact glycopeptide level 29 . Thus, the sites were predominantly occupied by Man 9 if they were 100% high-mannose glycosylation, whereas other sites were occupied by mixtures of processed high-mannose structures (Man 8 to Man 5 ) and simple complex-type structures if they were occupied by a mixture of high-mannose and complex-type glycans 10 . We believe this protocol will be of wide interest to the proteomics and glycomics fields, and will be used by many outside those fields who want to gain high-level information about the glycoproteins they investigate.\n\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\nFurther information on experimental design is available in the life sciences reporting summary.
