{"title": "Illuminating pathogen\u2013host intimacy through optogenetics", "body": "Infectious diseases are a product of the complex interplay between a particular host and pathogen. In the case of intracellular pathogens, another layer of intricacy is added. The use of chemicals to control or monitor cellular pathways within pathogens or within sheltering host cells has an inadvertent effect on the other entity, which often complicates the data interpretation. Optogenetics holds the promise to resolve this enduring concern by expressing light-sensitive proteins to examine a pathway of interest in intertwined models. The method combines accuracy, efficiency, and speed with extremely high spatial and temporal resolution in altering or measuring the activity of a target pathway [1,2]. It offers other advantages as well when controlling cellular signals for studying infection processes: (a) a reversible and conditional switching; (b) circumvention of difficulties often faced with chemicals, i.e., poor diffusion, premature degradation, constant activation, and pleiotropic effects; (c) gene-encoded expression, thus inheritable to the progeny and uniform response in a clonal population. Not everything about this method is shining, though. Just as with any technology, there are credible issues varying from model to model. These include the general toxicity of light-responsive proteins, basal (dark) activity in regular cultures, and sensitivity of some organisms to a particular spectrum or intensity of light. The making of optogenetically modified cells (via plasmid transfection or viral vectors) expressing certain tools may cause a perturbation in cell behavior, but it can be minimized by standard optimization (i.e., promoter strength, tool screening, dark culture, inclusion of proper controls) and/or by using inducible expression systems. The advantages of optogenetics so far have far outweighed the stated concerns, as evident by its exceptional success.\n\nOriginally, optogenetics was comprised of light-activated proteins that can modify membrane potential or allow control of signal cascades, molecular interactions, and gene expression [2,3]. The ever-expanding field now, in its broadest sense, includes gene-encoded light-sensitive sensors, which can be deployed to gauge intracellular messengers or metabolites. Not least, the method has also embraced technological procedures to deliver light-regulated proteins, to control the illumination, and to measure the outcome [1\u20133].\n\nCurrently, more than 40 types of optogenetic actuators and around 30 biosensors are available according to Addgene repository (www.addgene.org). It is worth noting that many of them have been catered to address a wide range of hypotheses in neurobiology. While other research fields have begun adopting them to meet specific objectives, such as to study the stage differentiation in intracellular parasites [4] or to fine-tune the function of immune cells [5], applications of light-activated proteins remain extremely limited. We believe that the technique is now well primed to answer prevailing questions and shepherd new avenues in infection research.\n\nHerein, we outline comprehensive applications of optogenetics to study various paradigms embracing intracellular parasites, bacteria, and viruses of clinical as well as veterinary relevance (Table 1 and Fig 1). Specifically, Fig 1A shows selected opto-tools to modulate or sense secondary messengers (cyclic nucleotides) and physicochemical parameters (pH, reactive oxygen species [ROS], ions), whereas Fig 1B highlights the light-induced control of gene editing, protein expression, and lipidic signaling. A list of relevant references including Addgene construct numbers is included as supporting information (S1 Appendix). The text below explains how best we can deploy them to examine notable events during asexual reproduction of archetypical pathogens (Fig 2). Although we outline only designated pairs of optogenetic proteins and pathogens, in principle, most systems are equally applicable to all genetically tractable organisms. In fact, with the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9) and related genome engineering tools in common parasitic protists [6] and other microorganisms [7], it has become easier than ever to make desired optogenetic strains in \u201cmodel\u201d as well as \u201cnonmodel\u201d pathogens.\n\nParasites include an assorted group of eukaryotic pathogens taking advantage of the host, which itself is also a eukaryotic organism. The study of the complex relationship between parasites and host cells is often compromised because chemical modulators usually cannot distinguish between targets conserved in both entities. Likewise, a spatiotemporal detection of universal metabolites in intracellularly residing parasites is simply not possible via chemical methods. Besides troubleshooting these issues, making of optogenetic strains allows us to literally tell the pathogen (or host cell) when and where to modulate or monitor the cascade and for how long and how much. A pioneering study involving expression of a light-activated adenylate cyclase in the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii has already demonstrated the proof of principle for applying optogenetics in infection research [4]. Equally, expression of gene-encoded biosensors has enabled an otherwise challenging monitoring of subcellular calcium in T. gondii and Plasmodium falciparum enclosed within host cells [8,9]. These works have indeed paved a way to tap the vast potential of optogenetic actuators and biosensors. One can, for example, evaluate the roles of specific molecules during various parasitic stages, as epitomized by T. gondii and Trypanosoma cruzi (Fig 2A). Some of the most fascinating applications in parasites involve perturbation of ion homeostasis by light-gated channels, as well as photo-oscillation of calcium, cNMP (cyclic nucleotide monophosphate), and phosphoinositide signaling cascades. In essence, a rigorous experimental design can permit systematic dissection of signaling by studying optically induced changes in histone coding, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome.\n\nA repertoire of cation- and anion-specific channelrhodopsin variants is available to investigate inter- or intra-organelle ion homeostasis [10]. Evenly, genetically encoded calcium actuators (GECAs) [11,12] and light-induced cyclic nucleotide cyclases [13\u201316], along with corresponding phosphodiesterases [17,18], are perfectly poised to elucidate novel aspects of calcium and cNMP signaling, respectively. For instance, the parasite strains expressing a light-activated adenylate or guanylate cyclase in a PKA- (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) or PKG-deficient (cGMP-dependent protein kinase) mutant can be subjected to phosphoproteomic analysis to identify the core signaling mediators. On a different note, the method may even prove beneficial over ablation of native signaling proteins in certain cases because a sophisticated reversible control can be achieved as opposed to all or none effect in the gene-knockout mutants. This is well exemplified by applying optogenetics in T. gondii [4], in which induction of parasite-derived cytosolic cAMP can exert contrary effects depending on the duration and intensity of the stimulus. In this regard, it does make sense to couple optical regulation with a real-time detection using apposite sensors. A gamut of color-tuned biosensors, such as for calcium [19\u201321], cAMP [22], cGMP [23], c-di-GMP [24], DAG (diacylglycerol) [25], and IP3 [26], is available to quantify subcellular oscillations.\n\nConversely, the above tools can be expressed in host cells to study the influence of host milieu on parasites. One such example is to dissect the mechanism of action of antitrypanocidal drugs, which control the muscle function by apparent modulation of calcium homeostasis during chronic Chagas disease [27]. These drugs are also active against Leishmania [28], further advocating the utility of calcium releasers and sensors (Table 1). Other appealing optogenetic approaches involve engineering host cells or parasites to harbor reactive oxygen species generating proteins (RGPs) [29], as well as the biosensors of lipids [25,30,31], polar metabolites [32\u201334], nitric oxide [35], voltage [36], redox [37,38], and pH [39\u201341], each of them tailored to address specific paradigms and individual needs (Table 1).\n\nJust as with intracellular parasites, infection with prokaryotic pathogens can be examined from the side of the bacteria as well as from the host-cell side. Yet again, studying pathogen\u2013host interactions has so far not relied on the deployment of optogenetics. Table 1 lists some customary optogenetic tools, which are projected to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the uptake of bacteria, survival within host cells, or transcytosis for leading human pathogens including but not limited to Mycobacteria, Chlamydia, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus. As depicted in Fig 1A and Table 1, the standard tools when engineering prokaryotes may use proteins with a photo-active chromophore (LOV [light, oxygen, and voltage], FAD [flavin adenine dinucleotide], BLUF [blue light sensing using FAD]) that can activate downstream cascades by altering the secondary messengers, such as cAMP [13,14], cGMP [15,16], or c-di-GMP [42,43]. It is also possible to develop light-responsive expression systems using photocaged effectors, such as doxycycline [44] and IPTG (isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) [45] or proteins [46,47], which are released or activated upon illumination to control the gene expression or protein activity. Just recently, the LOV2-ODC-degron system has been reported, which targets the conjugated protein of interest to light-dependent proteasomal degradation, thereby controlling the protein stability [48] (Fig 1B). Even though most of these tools have been originally developed in eukaryotic cells, their tailored adoption in prokaryotes is quite plausible. Other comparable applications include modulation of protein\u2013protein interactions, which could in turn be used to regulate cell signaling, genome editing, endogenous transcription, and epigenetic states [49\u201353] (Fig 1B). Equally, gene-encoded sensors can be applied to monitor the pH, ions, membrane potential, redox states, temperature, pressure, and molecular crowding [54].\n\nSimilar approaches can be used to modify host cells and regulate gene expression, signaling, autophagy, and organelle functions\u2014processes that are considered important for interactions of host cells with bacterial pathogens, e.g., Chlamydia (Fig 2A). Optogenetics also enables the control of organelle transport and positioning [55], which might be useful when studying the importance of host organelle hijacking by microbes. It is even possible to induce and repress the mechanotransduction and cellular forces with spatiotemporal accuracy [56]. The underlying method involves controlling the subcellular activation of RhoA using the CRY2/CIBN light-gated dimerizer system [50]. In order to apply these methods, some hurdles need to be overcome, especially when manipulating mammalian host cells. The first one is the delivery of optogenetic proteins, which can be best solved by making stable transgenic lines using the established viral expression systems. Another issue is the compartmentalization, i.e., the targeting of a tool to the chosen organelle, such as nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. It can be resolved, though, by introducing organelle-specific signal sequences into the protein of interest. Parallel measurement of metabolites and ions in host cells harboring a pathogen is another bottleneck, which can be solved by coexpression of suitable biosensors. Once inducted, an effective commissioning of these tools is expected to shed light on numerous processes that have remained shadowy for a while.\n\nViruses are master modulators of signaling, immune response, and metabolism in the infected host [57\u201359]. In a way similar to eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens, most applications are also applicable to viruses (Table 1); although, optogenetic tools have to be targeted primarily to the host cell (Fig 2B). For example, opsin and GECA family proteins allow in-depth examination of the role of ions in promoting or demoting the viral lifecycle. One could envisage optogenetically eliciting a release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (naturally occurring via IP3R in HIV-1, HSV [herpes simplex virus], rotavirus), activation of PLC pathway (mediated via GPCRs in rotavirus), impairment of SERCA (sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase), and control of membrane permeability (via viroporin in HIV-1, HCV, influenza virus, coronavirus) through light-gated channels or pumps [60,61]. Phosphoinositide actuators [62] can be applied to control early steps of attachment or fusion to the host membrane in the case of Ebola virus, coronavirus, and HIV-1 [63\u201365]. Other potential usages include light-mediated regulation of immune response (e.g., activation of HIV-infected CD4 cells), killing of virus-infected host cells (e.g., IFN\u03a5 in CD8+ and NK cells), and photo-editing of viral genomes. Similarly, ROS-yielding proteins, physicochemical actuators, protein recruiters/oligomerizers, nucleotide cyclases, and lipid-derived mediators allow us to study other enigmatic aspects (Table 1).\n\nAs indicated above, viruses can also be used as vectors for delivering optogenetic tools into specific cell populations or tissues in mammalian cells. Addgene repository contains several lentiviral constructs for targeted delivery and integration into genomes. Additional popular models include adeno-associated virus [66] and rabies virus [67]. Not least, selected gene-encoded sensors that can facilitate optogenetic work in virology include GECIs (gene-encoded calcium indicators), cNMP biosensors, as well as fluorescent indicators for pH, lipids, and several other metabolites (Table 1). Among many, one assay would be to test the pH dependence of membrane fusion during the entry of influenza and stomatitis viruses, mediated by hemagglutinin and G glycoprotein, respectively [68,69]. Another conceivable application is to visualize lipid rafts as a predicted platform for the entry, assembly, and release of viral particles [70\u201372]. Finally, a fusion approach coutilizing optical actuators and sensors will certainly embolden existing toolboxes in virology.\n\nA modulation and monitoring of pathogen-specific pathways without affecting the sheltering host cell is nearly impossible with chemical modulators and fluorophores. Contrariwise, selective manipulation of the infected host is equally challenging. Although not common yet, optogenetics offers an imperative toolbox to modify and monitor subcellular processes both in the host as well as in the pathogen. The deployment of optogenetics shall overcome most, if not all, difficulties inherent to classic approaches in infection research. Just as with neurosciences, this will hopefully also lead to improvement of old tools and discovery of customized solutions catering pathogens in imminent future. Hence, building a bridge between the fields of optogenetics and infection biology remains more important than ever."}
