{"title": "A simple magnetic nanoparticles-based viral RNA extraction method for efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2", "body": "transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is identified as a standard and routinely used technique for the analysis and quantification of various pathogenic RNA in laboratories and clinical diagnosis. 2 For example, it has been successfully applied for the detection of SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and various other viral pathogens including Zika virus (ZIKV), Influenza A virus, Dengue virus (DENV). [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] After the outbreak of COVID-19, several methods and kits based on RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA have been reported. [9] [10] While RT-PCR-based methods have been widely used in COVID-19 diagnosis, their application in accurate diagnosis of viral infection and epidemic control is severely hampered by their laborious and time-consuming sample processing steps.\n\nQuantitative extraction of nucleic acids with high purity from complex samples are the prerequisite for efficient RT-PCR assays. Low extraction efficiency might give poor signals during exponential amplification and thus result in false negative results. [11] [12] Low extraction quality, on the other hand, may contain a variety of PCR inhibitors, which gives unreliable readouts during amplification. [13] [14] In the control and diagnosis towards SARS-CoV-2 currently, silica-based spin column RNA extraction methods are widely used, in which a silica membrane or glass fiber is applied to bind nucleic acids. In these traditional methods, the samples need pre-lysis in an appropriate buffer to release nucleic acids from viral particles before binding to the column membrane and multiple centrifugation steps are required to enable binding, washing and elution of extracted nucleic acids. Additionally, as various corrosive chaotropic salts and toxic organic solvents are involved in the lysis and binding steps, several sequential washing steps are required to eliminate possible PCR inhibitory effects in the eluted products. The whole process comprises multiple centrifuging and column-transferring steps, which is laborious, time-consuming, and vulnerable to contamination or column clogging. More importantly, spin column-based approaches are not suitable for a high-throughput, automated operation. In the monitoring and control of sudden outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-2, these traditional methods consume a large number of operators, but giving low diagnosis efficiency and high risk of cross infection. Thus, fast, convenient and automated nucleic acids extraction methods are highly desirable not just in the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, but also in the monitoring and prevention of other infectious diseases.\n\nAs an alternative, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs)-based extraction methods are centrifuge-free and has proven to be easy to operate and compatible to automation and author/funder.

[15] [16] [17] In conventional MNPs-based methods, nucleic acids in the lysed samples can be specifically absorbed on MNPs due to various surfacemodified functional groups. In the presence of magnetic fields, nucleic acids are rapidly separated from most impurities in the supernatant. After fast washing steps to eliminate trace impurities, purified nucleic acids can be further released from the surface of MNPs by elution buffer with altered ionic strength. Although much simpler and faster than spin column-based methods, most MNPs-based extraction strategies still contain multiple processing steps such as lysis, binding, washing and elution, which increases operational difficulties in real clinical diagnosis.\n\nHerein, a further simplified and updated MNPs-based viral RNA extraction method is described for highly sensitive extraction and RT-PCR detection of viral RNA using SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses as models. The MNPs is synthesized via a simple one-pot approach, and functionalized with polymers carrying multi-carboxyl groups by following one-step incubation. Due to the strong interaction between carboxyl groups and nucleic acids, the poly carboxyl-functionalized MNPs (pcMNPs) enables rapid and efficient absorption of RNA molecules. In RNA extraction, one lysis/binding step and one washing step are required for nucleic acids extraction and purification from complex samples. More importantly, extracted RNA can be directed introduced into subsequent RT-PCR together with MB without elution step, which dramatically reduce operating time and risk of contamination. The fast extraction method was verified by both manual operation and automated system. Due to its simplicity, satisfactory performances and robustness, this method provides a promising alternative to decrease the labour-intensity and reduce possibility of false-negative results in current RT-PCRbased SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.\n\nIron (III) chloride hexahydrate, Iron (II) chloride tetrahydrate, ammonium 1,4-butanediol diacrylate, 6-amino caproic acid, sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium iodide (NaI), tri(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris), ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid author/funder.

Specifically, 30 \u03bcL of reaction solution composed of 15 \u03bcL of TE buffer, 7.5 \u03bcL of 4 \u00d7 reaction buffer, 1.5 \u03bcL enzyme mixture, and optimal concentrations of primers (1 \u03bcM each) and probe (1 \u03bcM) was mixed with pcMNP-RNA complexes by brief vortexing, and directly transferred to the PCR tube for RT-PCR using the same procedure as abovementioned.\n\nA high throughput automated RNA extraction method was adapted using a commercial NP968-C automatic nucleic acid extraction system (TIANLONG, Xi'an, China), which could simultaneously process up to 32 parallel samples in 96-well sample plates.

Then the washing buffer and elution buffer was added separately into Column 2 or 4. Finally, the 96-well sample plate was plugged onto the matrix and RNA extraction was performed by following an optimized program (TableS1). Once the program was finished, the 96-well sample plate was removed and the 15 \u03bcL of the eluted product was analysed using the conventional RT-PCR protocol as described above.

As shown in Figure2A, more than 90% of RNA was absorbed by the pcMNPs within 10 min. In contrast, significant amount RNA molecules have been observed using a commercialized RNA extraction kit under similar conditions. More importantly, no aggregation has been observed when incubating pxMNPs in a high-salt solution (50 mM NaCl), further confirmed their excellent dispersity (Figure2B).\n\nScheme2 A schematic representation of the pcMNP-based viral RNA extraction method.\n\nBy following a simple lysis/binding-washing-elution protocol shown in Scheme2, 10 5 copies of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in 200 \u03bcL serum samples were extracted and subject to RT-PCR analysis. We first carried out a concentration optimization of the primer and probe to maximize the efficiency and sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection.\n\nThe results showed that the optimal concentrations were 1 \u03bcM and 1 \u03bcM for the primer\n\nauthor/funder.

In these experiments, the serum sample without pseudoviruses was used as a negative control, while the PCR reaction mixture directly spiked with 10 5 copies of pseudoviruses was regarded as a positive control.

This phenomenon suggests that one advantages of the pcMNPs-based Direct RT-PCR protocol is to reduce possible false negative results, since all extracted viral RNA has been directed to the subsequent amplification without potential lost in the elution and transfer steps. Additionally, there is no detectable differences between amplification efficiencies of the positive control and Direct RT-PCR (Figure3A red and purple lines) . This result suggests that our pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction protocol not only exhibits nearly 100% RNA extraction efficiency in serum samples, but also provides high-purity products without PCR inhibitors.\n\nAs previously described, one of the most serious disadvantages of traditional columnbased extraction approaches is the difficulties in automation. Because no centrifugation steps are required, MNPs-based methods allow fully automated nucleic acid purification, which is highly important in current SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Therefore, the feasibility of automating viral RNA extraction procedure based on our pcMNPs was subsequently evaluated. A commercialized magnetic rods-based nucleic acid purification system was used. An automated programme was set according to the manual protocol (Figure4A). During the extraction process, although the shaking pattern of magnetic rods was set at the most vigorous level, no breakage or leakage of pcMNPs were observed, since the eluted solution are colourless and transparent (FigureS4). As shown in Figure4B, the amplification curve of the automated sample is very close to that of the positive control and manually performed Direct RT-PCR samples, which suggests that our pcMNPs-based method is highly suitable for the automated high throughput viral RNA extraction. author/funder.

Meanwhile, the differences of Ct values between neighbouring curves are approximately 3 cycles, which is very close to the theoretical 3.3 cycles for a 10-fold dilution. These results indicated that the RT-PCR amplification is highly efficient both in the presence or absence of pcMNPs. However, it is also important to note that in both cases, the negative controls sometimes gave observable amplification signals. Although their Ct values are lagged too far behind 40 cycles to be regarded as a valid positive result, this phenomenon raise concerns about possible false-positive issues, in which further optimization of primer pairs and probe might be necessary.\n\nOverall, the updated MB-based extraction method had highly extraction efficiency and compatibility of PCR amplification in any of the patterns, which dramatically simplified laborious sample processing work and was ideally suitable for RT-PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 with a sensitivity of 10 copies at least. Efficient and robust nucleic acids extraction from complex clinical samples is the first and the most important step for subsequent molecular diagnosis, but currently it is still highly labour intensive and time-consuming.

In this study, a carboxyl polymer-coated MNPs, namely pcMNPs, was developed and a simple but efficient viral RNA extraction system was established for sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via RT-PCR. As compared with traditional column-based nucleic acids extraction methods, our pcMNPs-based method has several advantages ( Table 2) .\n\nFirstly, pcMNPs-based method combines the virus lysis and RNA binding steps into one, and the pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent RT-PCR reactions (Direct RT-PCR), which gives a dramatically simplified RNA extraction protocol. Secondly, pcMNPs have excellent viral RNA binding performances, which results in 10-copy sensitivity and the high linearity over 5 logs of gradient in SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection using RT-PCR. Thirdly, this method can be easily adopted in fully automated nucleic acid extraction systems without laborious optimization.\n\nFurthermore, the pcMNPs-RNA complexes obtained by this method is also compatible with various isothermal amplification methods, such as RPA and LAMP, and thus could be used in the development of POCT devices. In conclusion, due to its simplicity, robustness, and excellent performances, our pcMNPs-based method may provide a promising alternative to solve the laborious and time-consuming viral RNA extraction operations, and thus exhibits a great potential in the high throughput SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis. author/funder.
