IR spectra were taken from KBr pellets on a Varian 660 FTIR spectrometer.

Melting points were determined on a NAGEMA apparatus. The course of reactions and purity of synthesized compounds were monitored by TLC on Silufol UV-254 plates using C6H6\u2013Me2CO (10:1, 6:1).

MM 481.7.\n\n\nAntiviral activity of the synthesized compounds was studied in the framework of the international program \u201cAACF Antiviral Testing in Animals\u201d at the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, University of Utah, USA. In particular, all newly tested compounds were evaluated initially a) for inhibition of virus cytopathic effects (CPE assay) and b) for uptake of neutral red dye (NR Dye Uptake Assay) that stained undamaged virus cells. The color intensity was determined spectrophotometrically. The experimental results from a) were used to calculate the 50% inhibitory (cytotoxic) concentration CC50; from b), the 50% effective concentration EC50. Antiviral activity of each tested compounds was characterized by the selectivity index (SI50), which was the ratio of CC50 to EC50. As a rule, SI50 values of 10 or more indicated the presence of antiviral activity for the compound. The method was described in detail before [12].\n\n\nXSA. A single crystal of 2 for the XSA was obtained by slow evaporation of an appropriate solvent at room temperature. Unit-cell constants of the crystal of 2 were determined and refined on a CCDXcalibur Ruby diffractometer (Oxford Diffraction) using Cu K\u03b1-radiation (300 K, graphite monochromator) [13]. A three-dimensional dataset of reflections was obtained on the same diffractometer. Absorption corrections for the crystals were made semi-empirically using the SADABS program [14].\n\nTable 1 presents the main XSA and refinement parameters for the structure of 2.\n\nThe structure was solved by direct methods using the SHELXS-97 program suite and refined using the SHELXL-97 program [15]. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined by full-matrix anisotropic least-squares methods (over F2). Positions of H atoms were found geometrically and refined with fixed isotropic thermal factors Uiso = nUeq, where n = 1.5 for methyls and 1.2 for others and Ueq is the equivalent isotropic thermal factor of the corresponding C atom.\n\nResults from the XSA were deposited as a CIF-file in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC)."}
