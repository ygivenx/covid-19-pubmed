These reported methodologies produce good results in many instances. However, some of the synthetic strategies suffer from metal catalyst, expensive reagents, long reaction time, environmentally hazardous, harsh reaction condition, tedious work-up procedure, unsatisfactory yield and use of homogeneous catalyst which are difficult to separate from the reaction mixture and reuse.\n\nAqueous phase organic synthesis has attracted the attention of chemists as it overcomes the harmful effects associated with the organic solvents and is environmentally benign. These reactions become more sophisticated if they can be performed under supramolecular catalysis. In view of the above, the development of a generally applicable and environmentally benign methodology for the synthesis of 3-indolyl-3-hydroxy oxindoles and 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones derivatives is highly desirable. We report, herein, an aqueous phase synthesis of 3-indolyl-3-hydroxy oxindoles and 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones from isatins and indoles in the presence of sulfonated-b-cyclodextrin (b-CD-SO 3 H) ( Fig. 1 and Scheme 1). Supramolecular catalysis is a discipline in chemistry which involves intermolecular interactions where covalent bonds are not established between the interacting species which can be molecules, ions or radicals. 17 The most accessible b-cyclodextrin (b-CD) is a cyclic oligosaccharide consisting of seven glucose units. The cavity size and the inner hydrophobicity are suitable for encapsulating a variety of guests such as aromatic compounds. 18 The improvement of the reaction rate and selectivity with b-CD inclusion complexes has been reported in a number of organic reactions. 19 b-cyclodextrin mediated reactions in water are very useful tool for economic as well as environmental points of view. 20, 21 Sulfonated-b-cyclodextrin shows good results over bcyclodextrin in the synthesis of 2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)one 22 In continuation of our work on b-CD, 24 we envisioned b-CD-SO 3 H as a supramolecular catalyst and study its application on the synthesis of 3-substituted 3-hydroxyoxindoles and 3,3di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones to develop a simple and efficient method in aqueous media.\n\nInitially, the b-CD-SO 3 H was synthesized according to the method reported recently. 22, 23 The -SO 3 H content obtained was in agreement with the proposed method, the value was 0.52 mequiv g \u00c01 , and it matches with the literature report 22, 23 confirmed the sulfonation of b-CD. The catalytic role b-CD-SO 3 H for the synthesis of 3-substituted 3-hydroxyoxindoles and 3,3di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones has been compared with various reported catalysts and found fast conversion within 5 min with yield up to 96% (Tables 1 and 2) .\n\nIn order to optimize the reaction conditions and the performance of b-CD-SO 3 H as a catalyst for the synthesis of 3-substituted 3-hydroxyoxindoles, we studied 5-methoxy indole with isatin as a model reaction. The reaction proceeds in the absence of b-CD-SO 3 H to give lower yield (60%) with longer reaction time and in presence of 100 mol % b-CD and required 60 min to get 93% of yield. 15b The best result was obtained for 10 mol % of b-CD-SO 3 H affording 96% of within 5 min (Tables 3 and 4 ). Encouraged by the initial success, we applied the optimal protocol to a variety of isatins and indoles (Table 5) . Generally, the reactions were performed using 10 mol % of b-cyclodextrin-SO 3 H in H 2 O at reflux temperature for 5-15 min to give the desired products in good to excellent yields; 25 the results are summarized in Table 5 .\n\nIn order to optimize the reaction condition and the performance of b-CD-SO 3 H as a catalyst for this 3,3-di(1H-indol-3-yl)indolin-2one the reaction between simple isatin and 5-methoxy indole was selected as a model reaction by using different reaction parameters and various amounts of catalyst (Tables 3 and 4 ). The reaction proceeds in the absence of b-CD-SO 3 H to give less yield (60%). The best result was obtained for 10 mmol % of b-CD-SO 3 H (Table 6 , entry 4c), affording 96% of 3,3-bis(5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)indolin-2one within 5 min. A further increase in the amount of catalyst has no significant effect on the yield and reaction time (Table 4 , entries 4 and 5). The role of b-CD-SO 3 H as the catalyst has been confirmed when a similar reaction was carried out in the absence of catalyst (Table 4 , entry 1), giving only 60% yield with a longer reaction time 2 h. It indicates that b-CD-SO 3 H not only improves the yield of the product but also accelerates the rate of reaction. The significant presence of b-CD-SO 3 H has a great influence on the reaction time as well as the yield (Table 4 , entry 3). Temperature plays an important role, as at low temperature there is only a trace amount of product formed and required longer reaction time and as the temperature increases from 40\u00b0C to reflux the yields also increase with decrease in reaction time (Table 3) . A variety of structurally divergent isatins possessing different substituents were selected to understand the scope and generality of the b-CD-SO 3 H promoted reaction to form 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones. 26 The results obtained are summarized in Table 6 . For all the entries water was used as the solvent and the reaction was conducted under reflux condition. In all cases, the conversion was completed within 5-45 min with good to excellent yields except for 5-nitroindole (Table 6 entry 4e, 80% and entry 4i, 91%). A further increase in reaction time had no significant effect on the yields. In addition, the substituent on the aromatic indoles showed slightly different effects on the yields, reactions of aromatic indoles with electron-donating groups afforded little better yields of products than those with the electron-withdrawing groups ( Table 6 entry 4e, 80% and entry 4i, 91%).\n\nb-CD-SO 3 H was chosen as the catalyst since it is recyclable, environmentally benign, easily accessible and due to presence of the -SO 3 H group it possesses greater solubility than b-CD in water which enhances the rate of reaction greater than b-CD and shows good results over b-CD. The supramolecular b-CD have tendency to form inclusion complex with isatin which is reported by Rama Rao 15b similarly due to presence of the -SO 3 H group in b-CD-SO 3 H it possesses greater solubility than b-CD and also forms inclusion complex more effectively with isatin to enhance the rate of reaction.\n\nThe catalyst recovery and reusability 27 were studied by three cycles including the use of fresh catalyst for the synthesis of 3,3bis(5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)indolin-2-one (Table 6 , entry 4c). In every cycle, the catalyst was almost quantitatively recovered and after second and third use of catalyst decrease in yield is not much more significant which is shown in Figure 2 . The FTIR spectra . 3 ) of fresh and recovered b-CD-SO 3 H were also measured and no change was found in the functional group as well as in fingerprint region, indicating that no reaction occurs with b-CD-SO 3 H.\n\nIn conclusion, we report b-CD-SO 3 H as a highly efficient, reusable, environmentally benign catalyst for the synthesis of 3-substituted 3-hydroxyoxindoles and 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2- ones. The advantages of this catalyst are good to excellent yields of product, short reaction times, simple and clean work-up of the desired product without column chromatography, easy recovery and reuse of the catalyst.
