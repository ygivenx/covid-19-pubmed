{"title": "A sensitive retroviral pseudotype assay for influenza H5N1\u2010neutralizing antibodies", "body": "Human infections with avian influenza H5N1 virus were first observed during large\u2010scale poultry outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1997. Since its re\u2010emergence in Asia in 2003, 306 laboratory\u2010confirmed human H5N1 cases have been reported from Asia, Europe and Africa of whom 185 have died (World Health Organisation, WHO, May 16, 2007).\n\nThe influenza virus surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) is the most important antigenic determinant for virus\u2010neutralizing antibodies generated during natural infection or elicited by immunization. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays are employed for the detection of antibody in serum, and HI titers correlate with protection from influenza in humans. The WHO has called for research into improved assays for influenza given that HI tests, using turkey erythrocytes have been found to be relatively insensitive for measuring responses to avian H5N1 virus in humans.\n1\n Since this report was published, however, significant increases in sensitivity have been observed using horse erythrocytes.\n2\n Neutralization assays allow for more sensitive detection of H5 antibodies, but these are laborious and require Biosafety Level 3 laboratory facilities or higher which are not always available at the front line of an outbreak, especially in resource\u2010limited regions.\n\nTo make neutralization assays more widely applicable, there are two realistic options for rapid development; to use reverse genetics to engineer a safer, attenuated virus by deletion of the polybasic cleavage site in HA as is done for the development of inactivated vaccines for pandemic influenza,\n3\n, \n4\n or the construction of viral pseudotypes bearing the influenza HA glycoproteins as surrogate viruses for use in neutralization assays. The first option has its inherent problems, namely the issue of possible reversion to the wild\u2010type virus via genetic reassortment. The level of attenuation of such mutants may differ between strains/isolates and careful risk assessment is required.\n3\n With the pseudotype system, however, only the HA from influenza is required, with no possibility of recombination or virus escape. These particles undergo abortive replication and do not give rise to replication\u2010competent progeny. Retroviral and lentiviral pseudotypes have been used in lieu of replication\u2010competent virus to study neutralizing antibody responses to viral infection.\n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n These pseudotypes encode reporter genes and bear foreign viral envelopes of interest.\n8\n The transfer of marker genes to target cells depends on the function of the envelope protein; therefore, the titer of neutralizing antibodies against the envelope can be measured by a reduction in marker gene transfer.\n\nThe aim of this study was to establish a widely applicable safe assay, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity, and with adaptation to micro\u2010quantities of serum samples, compared with hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays and microneutralization (MN) tests for H5N1 influenza viruses. We have previously constructed murine leukaemia virus (MLV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pseudotypes that express the SARS coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) spike glycoprotein and used these to develop a safe in vitro neutralization assay that was shown to be both sensitive and specific for SARS\u2010CoV\u2010neutralizing antibodies.\n5\n We adopted a similar approach here for H5N1.\n\nThe ability of influenza HA to assemble on the envelopes of unrelated viruses was first reported for pseudotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus.\n9\n Retroviral vectors with H7 HA have been analyzed\n10\n and pseudotypes that bear H5N1 influenza virus HA glycoproteins have recently been described.\n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n We describe the construction of retroviral and lentiviral pseudotypes bearing the HA from an influenza H5N1 virus isolated from a Vietnamese patient (A/Viet Nam/1194/2004(H5N1).\n15\n) This HA has an intact polybasic cleavage site RERRRKKR as found in the HAs of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) which can be cleaved by ubiquitous host proteases resulting in lethal systemic infection.\n16\n Characteristic of an avian influenza virus, the HA has glutamine at position 226 and glycine at position 228 (human viruses have leucine at 226 and serine at 228), which form a narrow receptor binding pocket that preferentially binds to host cell receptors containing sialyloligosaccharides (SA) terminated by N\u2010acetyl sialic acid linked to galactose with an \u03b12,3 linkage (the major form in the avian trachea and intestine). Using this HA pseudotype as a surrogate virus, we have established a safe, sensitive and specific assay for neutralizing antibodies to H5N1.\n\nPlasmid pI.18/VN1194 HA was constructed at NIBSC. The full\u2010length HA ORF from A/Vietnam/1194/04 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the expression vector pI.18. This backbone plasmid is a pUC\u2010based plasmid incorporating promoter and Intron A elements from human cytomegalovirus. The MLV and HIV gag/pol constructs, and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter constructs have been described previously.\n17\n, \n18\n The luciferase (Luc) reporter construct MLV\u2010Luc has been described.\n19\n Vesicular stomatitis virus envelope protein (VSV\u2010G) expression vector pMDG has been described previously.\n20\n All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle medium (DMEM) with Glutamax and high glucose (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland, UK), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin, except for 293T cells (15% fetal calf serum).\n\nConfluent plates of 293T cells were split 1:4 the day before transfection. Each plate of 293T cells was transfected with 1 \u03bcg gag/pol construct, 1.5 \u03bcg of GFP or Luc reporter construct, and 1.5 \u03bcg HA\u2010 or VSV\u2010G\u2010expressing construct by using the Fugene\u20106 transfection reagent (Figure 1a). At 24 h post\u2010transfection, 1 U of exogenous neuraminidase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to induce the release of HA\u2010pseudotyped particles from the surface of the producer cells.\n21\n Supernatant was harvested 48 and 72 h post\u2010transfection, filtered through 0.45\u2010\u03bcm filters, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. MLV vector titers were measured on human 293T, quail QT6, canine MDCK, porcine PK15 and ST\u2010IOWA cells and are presented as infectious units (IU) per milliliter. HIV vector titers were measured on 293T, QT6 and MDCK cells. Briefly, cells were infected with vector, and GFP or Luc titers were determined 72 h later by flow cytometry or by Luc assay. Titers were expressed as IU/ml for GFP and RLU/ml for Luc.\n\nHyper\u2010immune sheep sera raised against recombinant HA from different influenza subtypes, H3N2 (S1: A/England/427/88 and S2: A/Sichuan/2/87), H5N1 (S3: A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 and S4: NIBRG\u201014), H7N1 (S5: A/Chick/Italy/13474/99) and H9N2 (S6: A/HK/1073/99) were prepared at NIBSC. Serum from ferrets infected with the influenza H5N1 viruses A/Hong Kong/489/97 (FA), A/Hong Kong/213/03 (FB), A/Viet Nam/1194/04 (F1\u2010F4) and NIBRG\u201014 (F5\u2010F6) were prepared at NIBSC. Serum from ferrets infected with the influenza B viruses B/Egypt/144/05 (F7A) and B/Florida/7/05 (F7B) were prepared at NIBSC.\n\nAvian sera raised against the H5 viruses, H5N1 (C1: A/Chicken/Scot/59(Wilson) and C2: A/TKY/Turkey/05), H5N2 (C3: A/Ost/Den/72420/96), H5N3 (C4: A/Tern/South Africa/61), H5N7 (C5: AV1356/03) and H5N9 (C6: A/TKY/ONT/7732/66) were prepared at the VLA. Antisera against these viruses were produced in specific pathogen\u2010free white leghorn chickens by intra\u2010muscular inoculation with viruses (inactivated by beta\u2010propiolactone if HPAI virus) grown in embryonated eggs and challenged 3 weeks later with the same virus. Two weeks post\u2010challenge, the birds were bled and homologous HI titers were determined (Table 3). From five patients who had recovered from influenza H5N1 during the 2004 and 2005 outbreaks in Viet Nam, heparine\u2010anticoagulated plasma was obtained 8\u201327 weeks after illness onset (median 11 weeks). Serum from a patient that had recovered from infection with influenza H5N1 during the 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong was kindly provided by JSM Peiris. Human sera with HI titers against A/Wyoming/3/2003(H3N2) and A/Panama/2007/1999(H3N2) ranging from <8 (negative) to 1024 (panel 1, Table 1), and control sera from healthy UK residents (panel 2, Table 1) were provided by the HPA.\n\nReactivity using MN and HI (horse) was tested against the A/Vietnam/1194/2004/NIBRG14 (H5N1) vaccine candidate reference strain. The NIBRG14 virus contains the HA (with the polybasic cleavage site removed) and NA of the wild\u2010type antigen donor strain and the internal genes of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) and was obtained from the stocks at NIBSC (Potters Bar, UK). The virus stock for all experiments was propagated in the allantoic cavity of 9\u2010 to 11\u2010day\u2010old embryonated hens\u2019 eggs at 35\u201337\u00b0C, harvested 3 days post\u2010inoculation and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nThe antigens for the HAI (turkey) on the age\u2010stratified panel (panel 1, Table 1) were A/Wyoming/3/2003(H3N2) and A/Panama/2007/1999(H3N2) using 8HAU.\n\nAlso used for HI (turkey): A/Hong Kong/489/1997(H5N1), A/Hong Kong/212/2003(H5N1) at NIBSC, and A/Vietnam/CL26/2004(H5N1) at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Vietnam.\n\nHemagglutination inhibition assays with horse erythrocytes were conducted at the Health Protection Agency (Colindale, UK) using methods described previously.\n2\n, \n22\n Briefly, 25 \u03bcl of a twofold serial dilution series from 1:8 to 1:1024 of RDE\u2010treated serum samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an equal volume of the NIBRG\u201014 virus dilution, followed by the addition of 25 \u03bcl of the erythrocyte suspension. HI titers less than eight were considered undetectable and were assigned a value of four. For the Viet Nam patient samples tested by HI against A/Viet Nam/CL26 at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, guinea pig erythrocytes were used as horse erythrocytes were unavialable.\n\nNeutralising antibody titres were determined at the Health Protection Agency using a MN assay as described elsewhere.\n23\n, \n24\n Highly reactive sheep sera were pre\u2010diluted at 1:50. The antigen used in the assays was NIBRG\u201014 virus. MN titers less than 20 were considered undetectable and were assigned a value of 10.\n\nRetroviral (MLV) and lentiviral (HIV) vector particles pseudotyped with Influenza A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 HA were made by cotransfection of an HA\u2010expressing plasmid, pI.18/VN1194 HA, with plasmids encoding gag\u2010pol and GFP or Luc vector genome in 293T cells (Figure 1a). Culture supernatants were used to infect human 293T cells as a representative human cell line, canine MDCK cells as the preferred cell line for culturing influenza viruses, QT6 quail cells and porcine PK15 and ST\u2010IOWA cells as potential mixing vessels for human and avian influenza viruses.\n25\n, \n26\n VSV\u2010G\u2010pseudotyped particles were used as a positive control and infected all cell lines tested (data not shown). MLV(HA) pseudotypes infected all cell lines tested with the highest titer obtained on 293T cells (5 \u00d7 106 IU/ml), while HIV(HA) titers on human, canine and quail cells were broadly equivalent to MLV(HA) titers (Figure 1b). The titer of MLV(HA)\u2010Luc on 293T cells was 1.6 \u00d7 107 RLU/ml. All neutralization assays were performed using MLV(HA) pseudotypes on 293T cells as the most effective combination.\n\nSera from five patients who had recovered from infection during H5N1 outbreaks in Viet Nam in early 2004 (three patients, VN1\u20103) and 2005 (two patients, VN4\u20105) were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies using the MLV(HA) pseudotype assay. A broad range of IC90\u2010neutralizing antibody titers was observed in these sera (400\u20133200 for GFP and 800\u20136400 for Luc) and these were compared with titers obtained by horse HI (against a reassortant containing A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 derived HA (NIBRG\u201014), guinea pig HI (against A/Viet Nam/CL26/2004), and MN with NIBRG\u201014 and A/Viet Nam/CL26/2004 MN (Table 1). Titers obtained using the reverse genetic NIBRG\u201014 virus versus the CL26 virus correlated strongly by HI (r\n2 = 0.99) and MN (r\n2 = 0.99).\n\nTo test specificity and further validate our assay, a panel of 50 age\u2010stratified human sera with HI titers against Wyo_2004 and Pan_2004 H3N2 viruses ranging from <8 (negative) to 1024 was screened by NIBRG\u201014 MN, NIBRG\u201014 horse HI and by MLV(HA) assay. All sera tested negative for antibodies against H5 (Table 1 panel 1). No false positive results were observed in the sera from older individuals (age range 55\u201374) which can present problems in influenza serology.\n23\n Correlations of NIBRG\u201014 horse HI and MN assay titers with MLV(HA) titers for the H5 positive sera and the 50 age\u2010stratified sera are shown in Figure 2a. An additional panel of 50 human sera from healthy subjects also tested negative by the MLV(HA) assay for neutralizing antibodies against H5 (Table 1, panel 2).\n\nSera from ferrets infected with Hong Kong and Viet Nam H5N1 viruses were tested by MLV(HA) and NIBRG\u201014 HI and MN assays for the presence of antibodies against A/Viet Nam/1194/2004. Using the turkey erythrocyte HI, titers ranged from undetectable (<20) to 40, but horse erythrocytes were more sensitive with titers from 64 to 1024 (Table 2). When tested using homologous virus, turkey HI titers for ferret FA (infected with A/HK/489/97 H5N1) and ferret FB (infected with A/HK/213/03 H5N1) were 240 and 640 respectively. For the ferrets infected with the A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 virus, neutralizing antibody titers obtained with MLV(HA) correlated strongly with titers obtained by NIBRG\u201014 horse HI and MN (Figure 2b). The titer range was 50\u20133200 for GFP and 100\u20133200 for Luc. Sera from ferrets infected with influenza B viruses (F7A and F7B), and from uninfected ferrets were negative for the presence of antibodies to A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 HA (Table 2).\n\nSera from birds that had homologous turkey HI titers greater than 128 were tested for neutralizing antibody responses against A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 HA by MLV(HA), by horse erythrocyte NIBRG\u201014 HI, and by MN. All chicken sera except serum from the H5N9 immunized chicken (serum C6) were shown to have strong neutralizing antibody titers to A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 (100\u20133200 for GFP and 100\u20136400 for Luc) (Table 3). Neutralizing antibody titers obtained using MLV(HA) correlated strongly with titers obtained by horse HI and MN (Figure 2b).\n\nSera raised in sheep against recombinant HA vaccines derived from H3N2, H5N1, H7N1 and H9N2 viruses were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to H5N1 by pseudotype assay using MLV(HA) particles. Sheep serum S4, prepared against NIBRG\u201014, and S3 (A/Viet Nam/1194/2004) were tested by horse HI and MN assay for antibodies to A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 HA. Using the MLV(HA) assay, no cross neutralization of H5 was seen with sera raised against H3, H7 or H9 (Table 4). Sheep S5 (H7N1) was also tested by HI and MN against the RED3 reverse genetics H7 virus (Table 4). All sheep sera had positive single\u2010radial haemolysis (SRH) titers against their respective antigens (data not shown).\n\nWe have developed a retroviral pseudotype\u2010based assay that facilitates the accurate determination of neutralizing antibody responses to influenza H5N1 without the need to use replication\u2010competent virus. Our assay detected neutralizing antibodies to H5 HA in sera from patients who had recovered from infection with influenza H5N1 during the 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong and the more recent outbreaks in Viet Nam, in sera from ferrets experimentally infected with influenza H5N1 viruses, in white leghorn chickens immunized with various avian H5 viruses and in sheep immunized with recombinant H5 HA (3, 1, 2, 4). All sera found to be positive by HI and/or MN for H5 antibodies were also positive by MLV(HA) making this a highly sensitive assay.\n\nThe pseudotype assay described here is specific for the detection of neutralizing antibodies against H5 HA. High titer sera raised in sheep against H3, H7 and H9 viruses failed to neutralize the MLV(HA) pseudotype (Table 4). Sera from ferrets infected with influenza B viruses, and a panel of 50 age\u2010stratified human sera negative for H5 antibodies by NIBRG\u201014 MN and horse HI were also negative by MLV(HA) assay (1, 2).\n\nThe sensitivity of the HI assay is largely determined by the type of erythrocytes used and the measurement of HI titers against avian viruses has been significantly improved by use of horse erythrocytes. These contain a high proportion of SA\u03b12,3Gal linkages. Turkey erythrocytes, however, contain a low proportion of SA\u03b12,3Gal linkages which is thought to be responsible for the relative insensitivity of HI for the detection of avian H5 viruses.\n22\n HI titers obtained using horse erythrocytes were found to be at least 12\u2010fold greater than those measured using turkey erythrocytes for the detection of antibodies to A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 in ferret sera (Table 2). In sera from patients who had recovered from infection with H5N1 virus, HI titers obtained with horse erythrocytes were up to sixfold greater than those obtained using guinea pig erythrocytes which also contain a low proportion of SA\u03b12,3Gal linkages (Table 1).\n27\n HI using turkey erythrocytes failed to detect antibody in ferrets infected with the NIBRG\u201014 reverse genetics virus (ferrets F5 and F6) but using a modified horse erythrocyte protocol these were shown to be weakly positive. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in F5 and F6 by MLV(HA) assay, however, albeit at low levels (Table 2).\n\nThe pseudotype assay is significantly more sensitive than the turkey erythrocyte HI and at least as sensitive as the horse erythrocyte HI and MN for the detection of antibodies to H5 HA (3, 1, 2, 4 and Figure 2b). Sera from ferrets infected with live influenza A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 that had weak turkey HI titers against this virus have high levels of antibodies as measured with our pseudotype assay. Neutralizing antibody titers determined by the pseudotype assay were shown to be strongly correlated with titers obtained by horse HI and MN for human, ferret and avian sera (Figure 2a and b). When comparing the correlations between MLV(HA) versus HI (r\n2 = 0.93), MLV(HA) versus MN (r\n2 = 0.78) and HI versus MN, however, it should be noted that MN will also measure neutralizing responses against other envelope glycoproteins, namely NA, in contrast to the pseudotype assay and the HI assay which only measure responses against the HA component. This factor may explain why we obtained higher r\n2 values for correlations between MLV(HA) and HI assays than between MLV(HA) and MN assays for the human, ferret and chicken data (Figure 2b). We have constructed retroviral pseudotypes bearing both HA and NA glycoproteins and these particles may be useful in the development of assays for the detection of neutralizing antibodies to either glycoprotein (N. J. Temperton, unpublished observations).\n\nSerum from ferret FA, infected with the clade 3 influenza A/HK/489/97virus tested negative by turkey HI when tested against A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 virus, but had a titer of 240 when tested against the homologous virus (HK/489/97). However, with the MLV(HA) assay which is based on Viet Nam/1194/2004 HA, a neutralizing antibody titer of 1600 was obtained (Table 2). Similarly, serum from a patient who had recovered from infection, by a 1997 HK H5N1 virus also had a strong neutralizing antibody titer as measured by MLV(HA) (800 versus a MN titer of 80) (Table 1). Also, sera from chickens that had been immunized with a variety of avian H5 viruses (isolated between 1959 and 2005) showed the presence of high levels of neutralizing antibodies to the recent A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 virus in the MLV(HA) assay (Table 3). Antisera to an avian H5N1 strain isolated in 1959 could neutralize the VN1194 pseudotype at high titer. Only chickens immunized with A/TKY/ONT/7732/66 (H5N9) did not produce high neutralizing antibody titers against the VN1194 HA. These data suggest that the MLV(HA) assay may be detecting cross\u2010neutralizing activity. The significance of such cross\u2010neutralizing activity remains to be evaluated by the use of further panels of human and animal sera, and pseudotyped H5 viruses belonging to different antigenic clades.\n\nTo achieve maximum sensitivity in serological assays, the selection of virus isolated from the same influenza outbreak, or the use of an antigenically equivalent strain is required for optimal antigenic match. A competent molecular virology laboratory could produce HA pseudotype virus within 2\u20133 weeks of the availability of viral RNA. Further studies are underway, making use of a panel of H5 retroviral pseudotypes with HA components derived from H5N1 viruses involved in the recent human and avian outbreaks. Of particular importance would be cross\u2010clade neutralization studies between viruses from the four different clades of H5N1 (1, 1\u2032, 2 and 3)\n28\n as recent studies have shown that there is often poor antigenic cross\u2010reactivity between viruses belonging to the Indonesian (clade 2) and Vietnamese (clade 1) sublineages, an observation that has implications for the design of vaccines against H5N1.\n29\n, \n30\n\n\n\nThere is a need to study the seroprevalence of influenza H5N1 in countries where outbreaks of H5N1 have occurred in humans and where H5N1 is endemic in the avian population. This is, primarily, to determine the extent of avian\u2010to\u2010human and potentially human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. Influenza A/H5\u2010specific antibody measured by neutralization is currently regarded as the \u2018gold standard\u2019 serological assay for H5N1 infection by the WHO.\n1\n The neutralization assay is used to detect functional strain\u2010specific antibodies in animal and human sera but as the neutralization assay requires the use of live virus, its use is restricted to those laboratories that have Biosafety Level 3 containment facilities, and for non\u2010attenuated H5N1, this may need to be upgraded to BSL4. Our MLV(HA) assay is at least as sensitive as the live virus\u2010neutralizing antibody assay, and does not require high containment.\n\nThe safety, specificity and sensitivity of the pseudotype assay suggest that it may have a role as an alternative or supplement to conventional assays. Our data indicate that for avian H5 viruses it is considerably more sensitive than turkey HI. It is possible that previous serological studies relying solely on turkey HI may have failed to detect low levels of antibody that could readily be detected by a pseudotype based assay as described here. By switching our assay reporter from GFP to Luc our neutralization assay has been adapted for high\u2010throughput usage. This assay is well placed to assess protective neutralizing immunity in sera from experimentally immunized animals (as for the sheep and chickens studied here), and from human clinical trials of pre\u2010pandemic H5N1 vaccines. Further development of \u03b2\u2010gal\u2010based pseudotype assays will allow wider application as an ELISA\u2010type assay in laboratories without specialized equipment. In addition, with minor modifications, these assays could be used to screen HA and NA inhibitors.\n\nN.J. Temperton and R.A. Weiss are the principal investigators on the project. N.J.
