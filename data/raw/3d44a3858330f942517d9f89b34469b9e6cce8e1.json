{"title": "Anterior Segment Mechanisms of Protection During HSV-1 Infection NIH Public Access Author Manuscript", "body": "Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are linear double stranded DNA viruses that are highly disseminated in nature and characterized by lifetime latency in their host 1 . They are also a leading cause of infectious corneal blindness in the United States 2 and a major cause of corneal opacity worldwide. One example is HSV-1 which causes herpes stromal keratitis (HSK), an infection of the corneal stroma which, if not appropriately treated, may result in vascularization and scarring that may eventually lead to blindness 3 .\n\nHerpesviruses may also cause visually devastating diseases in non-corneal sites, such as in the case of acute retinal necrosis (ARN) 4, 5 . While clinical features of herpes ocular diseases have been described extensively, the pathogenesis of herpesvirus infection in humans is still poorly understood. For example, it is not known why patients with HSK who have HSV-1 in the anterior segment do not develop retinitis in the posterior segment, despite the fact that there is no anatomical barrier between the anterior and posterior segments. A similar phenomenon has been observed in a mouse model of ARN 6 . Following inoculation of HSV-1 (KOS) into the anterior chamber (AC) of one eye of a BALB/c mouse, virus replicates in the anterior segment of the injected eye and then spreads via synaptically connected neurons through the CNS to the optic nerve and retina of the uninoculated contralateral eye. Paradoxically the retina of the injected eye is spared from destructive retinitis. Sequentially, the route and timing of virus spread are as follows: anterior segment of the injected eye (day 0), ipsilateral ciliary ganglion (day 2), ipsilateral Edinger Westphal nucleus (day 3), ipsilateral suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN, day 5) and contralateral optic nerve and retina (day 7) 6-8 .\n\nIn an effort to discern the mechanisms involved in protection of the retina of the injected eye, previous studies have examined the roles of T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and polymorphonuclear (PMNs) cells in preventing direct anterior-to-posterior transfer of virus in the mouse model of ARN. Although in T-cell-depleted mice, virus infects the CNS and both optic nerves, and bilateral infection of the retina is observed, there is no evidence of direct anterior-to-posterior spread of virus in the injected eye of these mice [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Neutrophils and NK cells have been implicated in protecting the ipsilateral retina from direct anterior-toposterior spread of HSV-1 after uniocular AC injection; however, the number of these cells peaks in the injected eye on post injection (p.i.) day 4 or later. Additionally, the mechanisms by which these innate immune cells control virus spread in the injected eye have not been elucidated [14] [15] [16] [17] . The goal of studies described herein was to identify cells and cytokines involved in early protection (i.e., before day 4) of the injected eye in the mouse model of ARN.\n\nWe first studied infiltrating cells in injected eyes of HSV-1 (KOS) infected BALB/c mice. Single-cell suspensions were prepared from 6 pooled whole eyes of normal control, mock injected mice at 24 hours p.i. and from HSV-1 injected mice at 24, 48, 72 and 120 hours p.i. Cell suspensions were blocked with 10% mouse serum and then antibodies against cellular markers Mac-1, F4/80, CD4, CD8, CD49b, and CD11c were used to quantify microglia, macrophages, T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells 16 . Statistical significance was calculated as the average percentage of cell types from two independent experiments using one-way ANOVA.\n\nThe percent of Mac-1+ cells in the eye of normal control mice and of mock injected mice was low (0.94% and 0.60% respectively). In contrast, in the injected eye of HSV-1 infected mice, the percent of Mac-1+ cells had increased to 2.26% at 24hrs p.i. and peaked at 16.12% at 72hrs p.i. As shown in Table 1 the overall difference in the percentage of Mac-1+ cells between normal control, mock injected and virus injected groups was significant (P=0.01). The percent of F4/80+ cells observed in normal eyes or mock injected eyes was low (0.17% and 0% respectively) while a small, but significant percentage of cells was F4/80+ at 120hrs p.i. (1.87%). The overall difference in the percentage of F4/80+ cells between normal control, mock injected and virus injected groups was significant (P=0.001; Table 1 ). The percentage of CD49b+ cells was increased above normal control or mock-injected (0.51% and 1.23%) eyes only at 120hrs p.i. (2.76%), but this increase was not statistically significant (P=0.148). There were also no significant differences in the percentages of CD4+, CD8+ or CD11c+ cells between normal control, mock injected mice or virus injected mice at any time point (P=0.719, 0.307, 0.664, respectively).\n\nImmunohistochemistry was used to detect and quantify IFN\u03b3 positive cells in HSV-1 infected and uninfected mouse eyes. Frozen sections were prepared from eyes of normal control, mock injected mice at 24 hours p.i. and from HSV-1 infected mice at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours p.i. Sections were stained for IFN\u03b3 as previously described 16 . The area of the ciliary body was examined and fluorescent images were captured from four noncontiguous representative sections from each animal in each group. Images were captured using 200X magnification with SPOT Advanced (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). The number of IFN\u03b3+ cells was determined by counting the number of IFN\u03b3+ cells in each image of the ciliary body and averaging the number of positive cells in each group. Cell counts were transformed using the square root transformation [y=sqrt(x+1)] and transformed data were used in all analyses. Pairwise comparisons were made using the Tukey Kramer test in SAS 9.1.\n\nThe average number of IFN\u03b3+ cells in the ciliary body in virus injected mice was significantly increased at 48 hours p.i. (15 cells) when compared with normal control and mock injected mice (0 cells; P=0.01; Figure 1A ). Results were also significant when the average number of IFN\u03b3+ cells in the ciliary body of virus injected mice was compared at 12hr (0 cells) and 48hr p.i. (15 cells; P<0.0001; Figure 1A ) and also between 24hr p.i. (1 cell) and 48hr p.i. (15 cells; P=0.0005).\n\nImmunofluorescence was also used to identify Mac-1+ cells producing IFN\u03b3 and to determine their location in the injected eye following uniocular AC inoculation of HSV-1 (KOS). Frozen sections were prepared from eyes of normal control, mock injected mice at 24 hours p.i. and from virus infected mice at 24, 48, and 72 hours p.i.; sections were double stained for Mac-1 and IFN\u03b3 as previously described 16 .\n\nAn occasional Mac-1+ cell was observed in the eye of normal control (not shown) or the injected eye of mock injected animals ( Figure 1C ). Single stained IFN\u03b3+ cells or cells double stained for IFN\u03b3 and Mac-1 were rarely observed in control animals ( Figure 1B-E) . Mac-1+ IFN\u03b3+ cells were observed in the anterior segment of the injected eye before 24hrs p.i. (not shown). As shown in Figure 1F -M, some but not all, Mac-1+ cells were also IFN\u03b3+ and IFN\u03b3+ Mac-1+ cells were observed in the limbus, ciliary body, iris and cornea through day 3 p.i. 16 .\n\nTo determine whether the absence of IFN\u03b3 affected either the pattern of HSV-1 spread or the area infected in the injected eye, IFN\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 [C.129S7(B6)-Ifng tm1Ts /J; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME] and IFN\u03b3+/+ (BALB/cJ; The Jackson Laboratory) mice were injected in the AC with HSV-1 (KOS). For detection of HSV-1+ cells in normal control and in virus injected whole eyes of IFN\u03b3+/+ and IFN\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice at 48, 72 and 120 hours p.i., frozen sections were prepared and fixed as described 16 . Sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum and incubated with unconjugated rabbit anti-HSV-1 (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corporation; Westbury, NY) washed in PBS, incubated with FITC conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch; West Grove, PA), washed in PBS again and mounted with VectorShield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA). Slides were examined using a fluorescence microscope and images were captured using AxioVision 4.6 (Carl Zeiss, Germany).\n\nHSV-1+ staining was observed in the anterior segment (ciliary body, iris, and cornea) in 100% of both IFN\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice (4/4, 8/8, and 8/8) and IFN\u03b3+/+ mice (3/3, 9/9 and 9/9) at 48, 72 and 120 hrs p.i., respectively. The pattern of HSV-1 staining in the ciliary body of IFN\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 mice was similar to that seen in IFN\u03b3+/+ mice; however, more of the ciliary body was HSV-1+ in IFN\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 2 ). HSV-1+ staining was observed in the central retina in 25% (1/4), 38% (3/8), and 50% (4/8) of IFN\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice at 48, 72 and 120 hours p.i., respectively (not shown). HSV-1 staining was observed in the central retina in 0% (0/3), 22% (2/9), and 22% (2/9) of IFN\u03b3+/+ mice at 48, 72 and 120 hours p.i (not shown). The amount of HSV-1 staining in the central retina appeared to be similar between IFN\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice and IFN\u03b3+/+ mice. Although destructive retinitis was not observed, the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and ganglion cells of the central retina were HSV-1+ more often in IFN\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice than in IFN\u03b3+/+ mice.\n\nFollowing uniocular AC inoculation, HSV-1 does not spread directly from the anterior segment to the posterior segment in the injected eye of BALB/c mice [6] [7] [8] . The front line of immune defense in vertebrates is the innate response during which macrophages and neutrophils recognize, ingest and kill invading pathogens. Macrophages secrete cytokines which activate NK cells and dendritic cells that are then recruited to the site of infection resulting in activation of adaptive immune response including T and B cells. In absence of T-cells, mice infected with HSV-1 in the AC develop bilateral retinitis. However, in these mice the virus gains access to the ipsilateral retina via connections of the contralateral suprachiasmatic nucleus to the ipsilateral optic nerve and retina and not via direct spread of virus from the infected anterior segment [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Na\u00efve T cells are continuously migrating between the circulating blood and lymphoid tissue awaiting activation by antigen presenting cells and are therefore more likely to contribute to protection of the ipsilateral retina after day 5 9, 11, 16 . Neutrophils and NK cells also appear to be critical to protection of the ipsilateral retina; however, these cell types are detected later in infection (on and after day 4 p.i.), while the number of Mac-1+ (i.e., activated microglia) in the injected eye peaks before day 4 p.i. [14] [15] [16] .\n\nInterferons are important cytokines which induce production of proteins that inhibit translation and cell growth, induce apoptosis, and promote down regulation of mRNA in virus infected cells via intracellular signaling mechanisms 18 . IFN\u03b3, produced by cells of the innate and adaptive immune system (NK cells, macrophages, neutrophils and T cells), is appropriately known as the \"immune interferon\" [19] [20] [21] [22] . Studies of overexpression of IFN\u03b3 and infection of IFN\u03b3 deficient mice have shown that IFN\u03b3 plays an important role in viral pathogenesis. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . We have shown that the absence of IFN\u03b3 does not dramatically affect spread of HSV-1 from the anterior segment to the posterior segment and retina in the injected eye following uniocular AC inoculation of virus. IFN\u03b3 is produced by immune cell types that are located in the anterior segment and are in position to mediate protection of the ipsilateral retina, 15-17, 20, 22 however depletion of single cell types or cytokines does not result in panretinal HSV-1 infection 11, 14, 15 . Taken together, these findings support the idea that in the mouse, the timing and appearance of different cell types and cytokines is critical to protection of the retina from infection due to direct spread of virus. The roles of macrophages, microglia and cytokines (i.e., IFN\u03b3) in preventing intraocular virus spread in human patients remains to be elucidated, but it is likely that similar to what has been observed in the mouse, in humans there are multiple factors which contribute to protection against virus spread in the eye and timing of appearance of these factors is important.
