As of February 20, 2020, a total of more than 75,000 cumulative confirmed cases and 2,130 death cases have been documented globally in 26 countries across 5 continents. Current studies reveal that respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever, dry cough, even dyspnea represent the most common and lobular activities without fibrin deposition or fibrosis. 9 It is believed that SARS-associated hepatotoxicity may be likely with viral hepatitis or a secondary effect associated with drug toxicity due to high-dose consumption of antiviral medications, antibiotics and steroids, as well as immune system overreaction. However, little is known about 2019-nCoV infection in liver. Surprisingly, recent single cell RNA sequencing data from two independent cohorts revealed a significant enrichment of ACE2 expression in cholangiocytes (59.7% of cells) instead of hepatocytes (2.6% of cells) suggesting that 2019-nCoV might lead to direct damage of intrahepatic bile ducts. 10 Altogether, many efforts should be made to be alert on the initial digestive symptoms of COVID-19 for early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation and early intervention."}
