{"title": "Predicting the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in China and across the world using the machine learning approach", "body": "Although the spread of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is slowing down in China, it is rapidly growing outside China and how it will evolve remains unclear. So far, SARS-CoV-2 has infected nearly 200,000 people and led to nearly 8,000 deaths worldwide. The COVID-19 outbreak has been declared as a pandemic and is expected to cause one of the most serious global public health problems in recent years 1 In this study, based on the public data of COVID-19 cases, we predicted the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in China and across the world. We first built the prediction model using the publicly available data for COVID cases. These data included the daily numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (CCCs), new cases (NCs), and death cases (DCs) of COVID-19 in China since January 20, 2020. We trained our model using the data from Jan 20, 2020, to Mar 1, 2020, and predicted the daily numbers of CCCs, NCs, and DCs after Mar 1, 2020. Furthermore, we predicted the epidemic trend of COVID-19 across the world (outside China) using the models derived from the models built based on the China cases.\n\nWe downloaded the statistics of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China from the National Health Committee of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), including the daily numbers of CCCs, NCs, and DCs since January 20, 2020. The data for the statistics of confirmed COVID-19 cases outside China were downloaded from Worldometer (https://www. worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries).\n\nCOVID-19 in China based on the data from Jan 20, 2020, to Mar 1, 2020 using Eureqa (Trial Version 1.24.0, https://www.nutonian.com/products/eureqa-desktop). Eureqa is a machine learning algorithm that can automatically build predictive models from data 9 .\n\nWe input the daily numbers of CCCs or DCs and their corresponding days to Eureqa to obtain a formula which perfectly shapes the relationship between both variables. Due to insufficient sample size of the datasets for COVID-19 cases outside China because of their recent outbreak, we did not directly use Eureqa to build the predictive models for the COVID-19 epidemic trend outside China. Instead, we derived the predictive models from the models for the China cases on the assumption that the COVID-19 epidemic trend outside China is similar to that in China with a time lag.\n\nWe trained the model for predicting the daily number of CCCs of COVID-19 in China using the data from Jan 20, 2020, to Mar 1, 2020 with Eureqa. We obtained the (Fig. 1A) . This is consistent with several recent reports 8,10-12 .\n\nWe predicted that the COVID-19 epidemic will end around mid-May in China. The number of COVID-19 cases is expected to total around 89, 000 when the epidemic ends in China.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The number of NCs is predicted to peak on Feb 10, 2020, with 4,944\n\nNCs. At the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak on Feb 22, 2020, the number of NCs is estimated to be 1,050. After Feb 22, 2020, the daily numbers of NCs are expected to be less than 1,000. Starting from Mar 25, 2020, the daily numbers of NCs will drop to less than 100, indicating that the COVID-19 outbreak has been basically under controlled in China.\n\nIn addition, using Eureqa, we built a model for predicting the daily DCs in China as follows: \n\n, where Y is the number of NCs and X the time (days). The model R 2 equals to 0.998 in the training set. The model predicted around 4,000 deaths caused by COVID-19 during the epidemic in China (Fig. 1C) . Furthermore, we estimated that the mortality rate for COVID-19 will be 4.2%, which is slightly higher than the mortality rate of 4% calculated based on the latest data on Mar 17, 2020. However, because the number of NCs grows small while the number of critical cases remains more than 3,000 on Mar 17, 2020, the final actual mortality rate for COVID-19 in China will approach to our estimate. Furthermore, we estimated the daily COVID-19 mortality rate in China based on the daily CCCs and DCs predicted. Because the median time from onset to critical condition is around 10 days 13 , we calculated the mortality rate on a given day by All rights reserved.

The daily mortality rate increases over time and grows steady from early April, 2020 (Fig. 1D) .\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak across the world (outside China) has lagged behind that in China. We tried to predict the epidemic trend of COVID-19 across the world (China excluded). We found that the daily numbers of CCCs within the 14 consecutive days starting from Feb 27, 2020 across the world followed the same distribution to those within the 14 consecutive days starting from Jan 26, 2020 in China (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test), p = 1) ( Fig. 2A) . Thus, we supposed that the COVID-19 epidemic across the world had a similar trend to that in China with a 32-day lag.\n\nAccordingly, based on the model for predicting the daily number of CCCs of COVID-19 in China, we generated the model for predicting the daily number of CCCs of COVID-19 across the world: 42641.14 30962.75 tan 0.16 32\n\nwhere Y is the number of CCCs, X is the time (days), and \u03b2 (= 4.5) is the ratio of the population outside China to that in China. Based on this model, we predicted that the number of NCs will peak on Mar 13, 2020, with 22,341 NCs across the world (Fig. 2B ).\n\nOn April 10, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak will peak across the world with the number of CCCs and NCs being 382,403 and 1,058, respectively (Fig. 2B) . After April 10, 2020, the daily numbers of NCs will be less than 1,000. Starting from June 15, 2020, the daily number of NCs will drop to 100, indicating that the COVID-19 outbreak is All rights reserved.

The total number of COVID-19 cases is estimated to reach 403,216 during the epidemic across the world.\n\nIn addition, we found that the daily numbers of DCs within the 7 consecutive days starting from Feb 29, 2020 outside China followed the same distribution to those within the 7 consecutive days starting from Jan 27, 2020 in China (K-S test, p = 1) (Fig. 2C) .\n\nAccordingly, based on the model for predicting the daily number of DCs in China, we built the model for predicting the daily number of DCs across the world: \n\nwhere Y is the number of DCs, X is the time (days), and \u03b2 (= 4.5) is the ratio of the population outside China to that in China. Using this model, we predicted that a total of 18,381 people will died of the COVID-19 disease when the COVID-19 outbreak is basically under control across the world (Fig. 2D) . The mortality rate for COVID-19, estimated by our predictive models, will be 4.56% across the world during the COVID-19 outbreak. This number is close to that (4.2%) for China.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has made comprehensive and profound impacts on the world.\n\nAlthough this disease appears to be well controlled in China, the recent dramatic increase in new cases and deaths outside China indicates that the COVID-19 outbreak may have catastrophic results globally without implementation of necessary mitigation measures. However, the experience from China suggests that the COVID-19 outbreak All rights reserved.

Because the COVID-19 outbreak outside China is in the initial or exponential expansion phase depending on different regions or countries, currently it is difficult to predict the major turning points in the COVID-19 epidemic outside China based on their data. Therefore, we assumed that the COVID-19 outbreak outside China follows a similar pattern to that in China, and accordingly derived predictive models for the COVID-19 epidemic outside China from the models built based on the China cases. Our models predicted that the COVID-19 outbreak will peak across the world around April 10, 2020, and is basically under control in mid-June (Table 1) . It should be noted that these predictions are made under the premise that the countries outside China implement comprehensive and stringent control measures like China, such as city lockdown, traffic control, and concentrated medical support for seriously-infected areas. Otherwise, the epidemic outside China could follow a different trend from China, e.g., prolonged outbreak that results in more unnecessary deaths and cases.\n\nOur model predicted that the number of NCs will peak on Mar 13, 2020 outside China. This is consistent with a recent prediction of the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in Italy 14 . We estimated the mortality rate for COVID-19 to be 4.56% outside China. This number may varies depending on different regions or countries. For example, the current mortality rate is 7.9% in Italian versus 0.28% in German. It should be noted that the estimated mortality rate could exceed the actual mortality rate considering that a number of asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic cases might not be identified.
