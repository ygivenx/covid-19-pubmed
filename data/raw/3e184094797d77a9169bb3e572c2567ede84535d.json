{"title": "Dynamic and cell-infiltratable hydrogels as injectable carrier of therapeutic cells and drugs for treating challenging bone defects", "body": ". 1 As the Ac-\u03b2-CD content increases, both the storage and loss modulus of the Ci-I gelatin hydrogels increase ( Figure. S2a ). At the same, the storage and loss modulus of the Ci-I gelatin hydrogels also can be improved by increasing the concentration of gelatin.\n\n( Figure S2b ). Interestingly, when the gelatin content increases from 8% to 10%, the storage and loss modulus of the Ci-I gelatin hydrogels do not show significant different.\n\nTherefore, based on these data, we choose Ci-I gelatin hydrogels with 8% gelatin and 10% Ac-\u03b2-CD for the following experiments. \n\nA total of 10g of \u03b2-CD were added to 150 mL of DMF and 7 mL of TEA were added to the solution. The mixture was stirred and cooled to 0 o C before 7mL of acrylic acid were added. After stirring for 12 h, the mixture was filtered to remove trimethylamine hydrochloride and the clear solution obtained was concentrated to about 20mL with vacuum rotary evaporation. Then the solution was dripped into 600 mL of acetone to precipitate the modified \u03b2-CD. The precipitate was washed several times with acetone and vacuum dried for 3 days. The substitution degree (DS) of CD was confirmed as 1.5 by 1 H NMR (Bruker Advance 400 MHz spectrometer) recorded with DMSO-d6 as the internal reference at 37 \u00b0C.\n\nGelatin and Ac-\u03b2-CD were dissolved in Phosphate Buffered Salin(PBS) at 37 \u00b0C to produce solutions with fixed concentrations of gelatin (8% [w/v] and Ac-\u03b2-CD (10% [w/v]). Then initiator I2959 was added at 0.05% (w/v). The mixture was pipetted into Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) molds at 37 \u00b0C, cooled to 25 \u00b0C, and then exposed to 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) light (10 mW/cm 2 , 10 min) at 25 \u00b0C to form supramolecular hydrogels.\n\nFor different tests, PVC molds of different sizes were used.\n\nFrequency sweep and shear thinning tests were performed on an Anton Paar MCR301 rheometer with 25-mm diameter plates (plate to plate) at a 0.2-mm gap size. The hydrogels were homogeneously distributed between the top and bottom plates of the rheometer. Frequency sweeps were recorded at a strain of 0.1% and a frequency that changed from 0.01 to 10 Hz. For the shear thinning test, the sample underwent sequential shear with a strain of 0.1% (for 120 s) and 1000% (for 120 s) for four cycles, and the recovery of storage (G') and loss modulus (G'') were monitored by time sweeps at a fixed frequency (10 Hz).\n\nCompression tests were performed on samples of 3-cm diameter \u00d7 3-mm thickness at an extension speed of 1 mm/s using a MACH-1 Micromechanical System (Biomomentum Inc.).\n\nIcaritin laden HGM hydrogels (32 \u00b5g icaritin per 100 \u00b5L hydrogel n=4) were photocrosslinked in 6-mm diameter \u00d7 3-mm thickness PVC molds. The hydrogels were incubated in 350 \u00b5L of PBS. PBS solutions were collected and replenished at 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 17 h, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, 7 days, and 14 days. The absorbance of samples was measured at 242 nm for these solutions to calculate the percentage of icaritin released.\n\nTo eliminate the effect of I2959, Ci-I hydrogels without icaritin were soaked in PBS as a blank control.\n\nThe migration test was performed by using a 24-well transwell. Icaritin laden Ci-I hydrogels and Ci-I hydrogels without icaritin were each formed on the top of the transwell membrane. Then, the transwell setups were placed in a 24-well plate. The volume of each hydrogel was 30 \u00b5L. Next, 100 \u00b5L of media containing hMSCs (2 \u00d7 10 6 /mL) were added to the top of the hydrogels, and 770 \u00b5L of growth media were added to the 24-well plates. After 24 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the hydrogels were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with DAPI. Confocal micrographs were obtained to visualize the distribution of the cells in the hydrogels.\n\nhMSCs were expanded to passage 4 by using growth medium consisting of \u03b1-minimum essential medium with 16.7% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% L-glutamine.\n\nFor three-dimensional (3D) culture, 1 \u00d7 10 7 /mL hMSCs were then photoencapsulated by irradiation at 365 nm UV (10 mW/cm 2 , 5 min) in Ci-I or MeGel hydrogels. Media \n\nThe cylindrical hMSCs-laden Ci-I gelatin hydrogels was cultured in growth media for 1 day and then injected through a G21 needle to cylindrical molds to remold the hydrogels. After the injection, the remolded hMSCs-laden Ci-I gelatin hydrogels were culture in growth media for another 5 days. The cell viability was tested before and after the injection by using live/dead staining.\n\nSamples were homogenized in Trizol reagent and then RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA concentration was determined using an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies). RNA from each sample (100 ng) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit from Thermo following the manufacturer's protocol. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real Time PRC system using Taqman primers and probes specific for GAPDH (housekeeping gene), osteogenic marker gene, and adipogenic marker gene. The relative gene expression was calculated using the \u2206\u2206CT method, where fold difference was calculated using the expression 2 -\u0394\u0394CT . Each sample was internally normalized to GAPDH, and every group was compared to the expression levels of Group 1, the quantitative value of which was determined to be 1.\n\nFive-month-old male SD rats were used. The animal experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. According to our established protocols 1,2 , every SD rat was injected with MPS (100 mg/kg per day) for 5 continuous days. At day 14, surgical CD of 1.2 mm diameter and 10 mm depth was performed in the mid-axis of the femoral neck of SD rats. Bulk cylindrical Ci-I hydrogels (15mm diameter, 3mm thickness) without icaritin, or loaded with icaritin (1.3 mM), or loaded with icaritin (1.3 mM) and MSCs (100 million cells per 100 \u00b5L hydrogel) were prepared. These bulk Ci-I hydrogels were washed in PBS for 3 minutes and then cultured in growth media for 1 hour. Then, the bulk Ci-I hydrogels was drawn into 3mL syringe iva suction and then immediately injected at 30 \u03bcL volume each time to a single bone tunnel created by the core decompression surgery.\n\nThe total volume of hydrogel for each rat was ~ 30 \u03bcL. The injection duration was ~ 30 seconds.\n\nThe femora were collected and fixed in 70% ethyl alcohol prior to bone scanning fusing a high-resolution peripheral computed tomography instrument (HR-pQCT, Scanco Medical, Br\u00fcttisellen, Switzerland) with a source voltage of 70 kV and current of 114 \u00b5A, according to our established protocols 3 . 3D images of the peri-tunnel and tunnel at week 3 and week 6 were reconstructed. Bone tissue volume fractions (bone volume/total volume, BV/TV) were measured using the built-in software of the HR-pQCT system.\n\nIn vitro samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, embedded in paraffin, and processed using standard histological procedures. The histological sections ( \n\nAccording to our previous protocol 3 , on the first day of week 3 or week 6 post surgery, calcein green (CG, 10 mg/kg) was subcutaneously injected into each rat. Then, after 7 days, xylenol orange (XO, 90 mg/kg) was injected into the rat through the same way.\n\nAfter another 3 days, rats were sacrificed, and their femoral heads were collected and embedded in MMA without decalcification and sectioned into thick sections (200 \u03bcm).\n\nThe tissue sections were further polished to 100 \u03bcm for the evaluation of the new-bone formation rate under a fluorescence microscope. The spacing between the CG area and the XO area was measured byusing ImageJ (supplied by National Institutes of Health, USA), and this spacing equaled to the distance of new bone formation after CG injection but before XO injection (7 days). Then, the bone formation rate at week 3 or week 6 post surgery was the calculated spacing divided by 7 days.\n\nSPIO labeling was performed on rat MSCs according to our established protocol 5 . SPIO nanoparticles were coated with silica and functionalized with amines, suspended in serum free \u03b1-MEM, and then sonicated for 30 min at 100 V to disperse aggregated particles. MSCs were washed thoroughly with PBS for 16 h to remove the serum prior incubation with SPIO. The labeled MSCs (100 \u00b5L suspension of 1 million pre-labeled MSCs) were injected into the bone marrow cavity of the proximal ipsilateral tibia during SAON surgery for histological analysis.\n\nAccording to our established protocols 3,6 , the concentration of protein was measured by using a BCA protein assay kit. 50 \u00b5g of protein was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane by a buffer-tank-blotting apparatus. After blocking with 5% fat-free milk for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody \u03b2catenin, \u03b2-actin, c-Src, PCNA CEBP\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, Osteocalcin (OCN), and colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) overnight at 4 \u00b0C, respectively. Then it was incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h. After washing with tris-buffered saline and Tris-buffered saline Tween-20, the protein was detected and visualized using Amersham ECL Plus TM Western Blotting Detection.\n\nNo unexpected or unusually high safety hazards were encountered."}
