{"title": "Silicone pneumonitis after gluteal filler: a case report and literature review", "body": "For decades, Liquid injectable silicone has been used for correction of contour defect or soft\u2010tissue augmentation. Medical\u2010grade liquid silicone (polydimethylsiloxane) becomes the preferred inert material for cosmetic purpose due to its durability, a lack of immunogenicity, and thermal stability; but later found to be associated with silicone embolism syndrome (SES). Liquid injectable silicone induced embolism has been reported by several studies as a cause of acute pneumonitis with alveolar haemorrhage 1, 2, 3.\n\nA previously healthy 30\u2010year\u2010old woman presented with three days history of cough with dyspnoea and fever. She had a history of breast augmentation with silicone implant two years ago and had received bilateral gluteal silicone injections from an unlicensed provider one week before the current presentation. The injected volume was approximately 500 mL for each gluteal.\n\nThe physical examination was tachycardia, tachypnoea with the respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute and a temperature of 38\u00b0C. Results of the arterial blood gas performed while the patient was breathing room air were as follows: pH, 7.39; PaCO2, 40 mmHg; PaO2, 56 mmHg; and peripheral oxygen saturation, 90%. Lungs examination revealed bilateral lower zone crepitations. Other blood investigations which included a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and lactate were unremarkable. She was initiated on broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics, oseltamivir, intravenous hydrocortisone 50 mg every 8 h, and 12 L/min (FiO2: 60%) of high\u2010flow oxygen supplement. However, she developed right\u2010sided pneumothorax and worsened respiratory failure 12 h later.\n\nOn chest radiograph, diffuse alveolar opacities in both lung fields were observed. A computed tomographic scan of her thorax demonstrated diffuse bilateral ground\u2010glass infiltrates (Fig. 1). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed, which revealed normal lung segments. Trans\u2010bronchial lung biopsy showed non\u2010refractile lipoid vacuoles, consistent with silicone pneumonitis (Fig. 2). Magnetic resonance imaging of the breast confirmed no intracapsular and extracapsular rupture of the bilateral breast prosthesis. Her bronchial wash was positive for Coronavirus NL63 RNA PCR.\n\nShe received lung protective ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (i.e. low tidal volumes and high positive end\u2010expiratory pressure (PEEP)) for continued hypoxia. Unfortunately, two weeks later, she again developed another spontaneous pneumothorax on the left lung and required chest tube drainage. Over four weeks in the intensive care unit, we manage to wean down the ventilatory support. She had an excellent clinical response and discharged with tapering prednisolone over two weeks. At six weeks of outpatient follow up, she was symptom\u2010free, and her chest X\u2010ray revealed residual bilateral reticulations.\n\nAppropriate written informed consent was obtained for publication of this case report and accompanying images."}
