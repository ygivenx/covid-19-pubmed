{"title": "Archives of Virology Asymptomatie Inieetion of Mouse Hepatitis Virus in the Rat Briei Report", "body": ", MHV-S multiplied in the \"anterior part of the head\", which includes the nasal bones as well as the nasal mucosa, and reached a maximum titer of about 10 5 PFU/0.2 g on day 2. Virus grew to much lower titres in the brain and low titres (less than 10 2 PFU/0.2 g) were also detected in the lung, liver and spleen in some animals examined 1 to 4 days after virus inoculation. Other tissues, such as salivary glands or blood, contained no infectious virus. limited to the nasal mueosa and brain (manuscript in preparation). Two other strains of MHV, namely JHM and MHV-Nu66 (10), were also inoculated into 10-day-old rats and were found to multiply, but to a lesser extent than MHV-S.\n\nFigs. 2a and 2b. Necrotic changes (Fig. 2a) and cytoplasmic immunofluorescenee (Fig. 2b) in epithelial cells of the nasal mueosa. Tissue from 10-day-old rats 2 days after i.n. inoculation with 105 PFU of MHV-S. Bar represents 0.1 mm Two-, 4-, 6-and t0-week-old rats were also inoculated i.n. with t05 PFU of MHV-S and infectious viruses were assayed in the lung, brain, salivary glands and liver. In less than one-third of the total, were infectious viruses detected in the lung and salivary glands and the titers were less than t02 PFU/0.2 g. No infectious virus was demonstrable in the liver. Sera were collected 14 days after inoculation and examined for neutralizing antibody. Table 1 shows that almost all contained neutralizing antibody to a titre of >100. The two rats inoculated at 6 weeks and seronegative when tested at 1 : 100 were nevertheless positive at i : 50.\n\nSo far only mice have been considered to be natural hosts of MHV and rat; has been excluded because highly virulent MHV inoculated by various routes did not cause any sy~lptomatic infection like that produced in the mouse (7, 13) . However, this does not imply that MtIV does not infect the rat. In the present study, we clearly demonstrated that by the intranasal route MHV-S infects rats of various ages from the following criteria: 1. MHV replicated in the \"anterior part of the head\" and several other organs; 2. viral antigen was detected by immunoftuoreseenee in the epithelial cells of nasal mneosa where histopathological changes were also found ; 3. rats of all ages produced neutralizing antibodies after virus inoculation. I n some cases, neither infectious virus nor histopathologieal changes were demonstrable in infected rats, however, neutralizing antibodies were constantly detected in the sera of inoculated rats, revealing that MHV replication occurs in every cases, but m a y be below the detection level in some cases.\n\nTwo eoronaviruses, namely rat eoronavirus (RCV) (12) and sialodaeryoadenitis virus (SDAV) (11) , are known to infect and cause disease in the rat. These viruses multiply first in the epithelial cells of the nasal cavity and thereafter, they manifest their organ tropism i.e., RCV goes to the respiratory system and woduees interstitial pneumonia (2, 12) and SDAV affects the salivary and lacrymal glands, and produces adenitis (11) . The pathogenesis of NHV-S infection in rats resembles, in part, that of SDAV or I~CV, in that these viruses cause the necrotic changes in the epithelial cells of the nasal mucosa at early stage of infection (2) . However MHV is confined there, or affects slightly the central nervous system as it does in infections of mice (manuscript in preparation).\n\nB~tATT and his eoworkers showed that SDAV multiplied in mice producing some histopathological changes in the respiratory system after i.n. inoculation (3) and we demonstrated in the w e s e n t paper that 3{HV infected rats of any ages. These facts indicate that SDAV and MItV are infectious for both mice and rats, so that both m a y play an important part in the survival of these viruses."}
