Here, we cloned S ectodomain and its fragments RBD and 84 S1 into recombinant baculovirus and expressed the proteins in insect cells. We found 85 that S and S1 formed homotrimer in solutions and the three proteins reacted well with 96 To screen a potent immunogen for COVID-19 vaccine development, we designed three 97 constructs-S ectodomain, S1 and RBD-for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein 98 expression by aligning the SARS-CoV-2 S gene (Genbank accession no. NC_045512.2) 99 to a SARS-CoV strain (Genbank accession no. NC_004718) S gene sequence in terms 100 of structure-defined domain profile of the SARS-CoV S protein (Fig. 1A) . The gene of 101 SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain encoding amino acids (aa) 15-1,213 with removal of its 102 original signal sequence was cloned to the downstream of the gp67 signal sequence in 103 pAcgp67B plasmid vector (Fig.1B) . and with its C-terminal addition of a thrombin 104 cleavage site, a T4 trimerization foldon motif and his tag.

The three 108 constructed plasmids were respectively co-transfected into Sf9 insect cells with v-109 cath/chiA gene deficient baculovirus DNA for the generation and amplification of 110 recombinant baculovirus, which were then harnessed to infect Hive Five insect cells to 111 eventually produce recombinant proteins, named S, S1 and RBD respectively.\n\nThe recombinant proteins were mostly soluble expressed and secreted into the 113 culture medium. The centrifugation supernatants of cell culture went through metal 114 affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA resin. S, S1 and RBD proteins were mainly as detection antibody (Fig. 1C) . Interestingly, about one half S proteins were cleaved 119 into S1 (identical migration site to S1 lane in Fig. 1C ) and S2 (about 80kDa developed 120 in anti-His WB) possibly by innate furin of insect cell that was also found in other cases (Fig. 1D ). These peaks fractionated at retention volume 28mL, 36mL, 48mL, 124 and 65mL, were further harvested and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The results 125 indicated that S proteins together with cleaved S1/S2 were resolved at peak 1 in size-126 exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1D ) and showed a high purity of over 95% total 127 .

Overall, one-step Ni-NTA affinity chromatography produced 128 RBD with 95% purity and a yield of 30 mg per L cell culture, S1 with about 90% purity 129 and 10 mg per L yield, while further purification through a size-exclusion 130 chromatography (SEC), the resultant S sample had over 95% purity regarding intact S 131 and cleaved S1/S2, and was harvested in a yield of 1 mg per L cell culture.

The three proteins were further analyzed by 150 differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) that was usually used to investigate the inner 151 thermostability of macromolecules or their complexes 14 . RBD and S1 showed one 152 major peak at comparable thermal denaturation midpoints (Tm) of 46.0 \u00b0C and 45.5 \u00b0C, 153 respectively ( Fig. 3G and 3H ), whereas S sample showed two major peaks at Tm of 154 45.5\u00b0C (identical to Tm of S1) and 64.5\u00b0C (Fig. 3I) , which might reflect the coexistence 155 of intact S and cleaved S1/S2.\n\nOn the other hand, we investigated the glycosylation extent of the three protein by The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.994152 doi: bioRxiv preprint Reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S1 and S proteins against convalescent COVID-173 19 human sera 174 We next evaluated the antigenicity of the three versions of S proteins by WB and ELISA 175 using a panel of six COVID-19 convalescent human sera, which was collected from Taken together, RBD, S1 and S proteins from insect cells maintain the native-like The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.994152 doi: bioRxiv preprint phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among these epitopes, most RBD epitopes are strictly 194 tertiary conformation-dependent sites that are damaged upon the mild denatured 195 condition of reductant and SDS treatment, NTD within S1 bears some linear epitopes, 196 whereas S2 part essentially has linear epitopes that are immunogenic in all COVID-19 197 patients (n=6).

Surprisingly, the alignment 219 demonstrated that the two cryo-EM structures share similar mushroom-shaped 220 architecture in particular nearly identical at stalk moiety (S2 region), but our S-pre 221 shows the cap part (S1 region) at ~15\u00c5 lower position than the reported S trimer in 222 RBD-down prefusion conformation (Fig. 4D ). Regarding to substantial mismatch at the 223 density of 3 S1 subunits, we respectively fitted 5 individual domains (NTD, RBD, SD1, 224 SD2 and S2) of the SARS-CoV-2 S structure (PDB code 6VSB) to our S-pre map. In 225 the fitting map, NTD, RBD, SD2 and S2 could be well placed in the S-pre map, 226 especially for the latter two, which reflects the aforementioned good match at the stalk 227 of the mushroom-shape ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . However, there is no observable 228 density between RBD and SD2 to accommodate an SD1 model ( Supplementary Fig. 2 CoV-2 spike may retain at more precedent state than the classic prefusion conformation 294 that has been determined for other coronaviruses. This early prefusion conformation 295 features that the cap of the mushroom-shaped spike constituted by three S1 subunits is 296 more proximal to viral membrane by 15 \u00c5 than in the classic prefusion conformation.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 spike expressed in insect cells predominantly retains a unique 298 early prefusion conformation, which was repeatable in at least three batches of samples 299 and is ascribed to two possible reasons -native aa sequence used in the S ectodomain The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.994152 doi: bioRxiv preprint first Ni-NAT and the second SEC purification (Fig. 1C and 1E ).
