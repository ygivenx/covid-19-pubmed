Fernandez et al. Bovine rotavirus (BRV) is an important cause of diarrhea in calves under 3 weeks of age'.'. Protection against BRV diarrhea and infection in calves during the nursing period has been correlated with high levels of neutralizing antibodies in the calf's intestine, mainly associated with IgGI, passively acquired via colostrum and milkJm5. Although most cows are seropositive to BRV due to field exposure, in unvaccinated cows, antibody titers in milk decline to unprotective levels after parturitions. and second, to determine the BRV antibody isotype titers in serum and faeces of these calves. We also examined if calves that were passively protected after the initial inoculation with BRV were immune to a subsequent BRV challenge exposure 21 days later. for the passive protection studies. Whey was obtained from each colostrum pool as described previously and used in assays to determine the virus neutralization and the isotype (ELISA) antibody titers to IND BRV'*.\n\nUnsuckled, newborn, colostrum-deprived (CD), male Holstein calves were procured and maintained as described previously'. Five calves were assigned to each of four colostrum feeding groups (VLP, CLP, inactivated SAl 1, or control colostrum) and were fed 1% supplemental pooled colostrum (20 ml of colostrum in 2 I of cows' milk infant formula) from each of the respective colostrum pools twice a day from birth through 7 days of age. Five control calves were not fed colostrum, but maintained on infant formula. All calves (between 20 and 30 hours of age) were orally inoculated with a suspension of 5 ml of IND BRV (titer -1x10' FFU ml ) in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS), pH 7.4, prepared from the intestinal contents of an infected gnotobiotic Cal?. IND BRV (titer -1xlO'FFU ml ') for oral challenge 21 days later, was prepared and administered in a similar manner.\n\nDaily records (birth to PID 10 and PCD O-10) were maintained of clinical signs and observations on stool color and consistency (faecal scores 0 = normal to 3 = liquid, a score of 22 indicating diarrhea). Faecal samples were collected daily from birth through PID 10 and from PCD 0 to 10. Serum samples were collected before the initiation of colostrum feeding (within 2 h after birth), at inoculation ( -20-30 h of age) and weekly through post-inoculation day (PID) 35. For detection of coproantibodies, faecal samples were suspended in PBS (dilution 1:16), centrifuged 15 min at SOOg and filtered through 0.45 /lrn syringe filters. Serum samples were inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. then stored frozen at -20\u00b0C for subsequent testing.\n\nTo detect rotavirus shedding, examined by immunoelectron faecal samples were microscopy\".\", cell\n\nPassive immunity to bovine rotavirus: FM Fernandez et al. culture immunofluorescence (CCIF)'.'\" and antigen capture ELISAJ,'\", as previously described.\n\nA sample was considered rotavirus positive if it was positive in any one of the three assays.

Days of BRV shedding, days of BRV-associated diarrhea, and cumulative faecal scores were also analysed. Diarrhea was considered BRV-associated if rotavirus antigen or virus was detected at any time during the period of diarrhea. Cumulative faecal scores were calculated for O-10 PID inclusive; this time interval was used as most representative of the protective effects of oral colostral supplements fed up to and including PID 6.\n\nIgGI, IgG2, IgA and IgM antibody responses to IND BRV (P[5]G6) were analysed in all serum and weekly faccal specimens using an indirect isotypc-specific ELISA as previously de:jcribed\".\".\n\nBriefly, polystyrene, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 2 /lg ml ' (in 0.06 M bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) of hyperimmune antiserum against BRV produced in a gnotobiotic pig (capture antibody).\n\nPlates were stored for up to 7 days at 4\u00b0C. Plates were washed using PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) prior to the addition of standard volumes of (1.1 ml well of each reagent (diluted in PBS-T) followed by 1 h sequential incubations of each reagent at 37\u00b0C in a humid CO? atmosphere.\n\nSemi-purified IND BRV from infected MA104 cell cultures ur mock-infected MA104 cell culture control fluids were added to each well followed by addition of the test serum or faecal samples (serial fourfold dilutions starting at 1:16) to antigen-coated and control (mock antigen) wells. Secondary antibodies consisting of MAb (from ascites) to bovine IgGI, IgG2, IgM (1:lOOOO) and IgA (1500) were added, each to separate plates followed by the indicator antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), F(ab')?, conjugated to alkaline phosphatase\n\n( 1: 10 000) and the substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 10% diethanolamine buffer (pH 9.6). The absorbance was read in an ELISA reader at 405 nm. The ELISA antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest sample dilution which had an absorbance of > 3 SD above the background control (samples in mock antigen wells).\n\nAnalyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed to detect significant differences among experimental groups. When such differences were noted, the least significant difference (LSD) test was applied. A signiticance level of p 10.05 was used throughout.\n\nand ELISA isotype antibody titers in colostrum pools against IND BRV arc summarized in Table I . The VLP colostrum pool had the highest VN antibody titer (-47-fold higher than the control colostrum pool), followed by the inactivated SAll colostrum pool (-12-fold higher than the control colostrum pool). The VN antibody titers of the CLP and control colostrum pools were similar. In ELISA, IgGl antibody titers to BRV were highest in the VLP and CLP colostrum pools ( -4 and 64-fold higher than SAll and control colostrum pools, respectively) and were the predominant antibody isotype in colostrum.\n\nThe IgA antibody titer of the VLP colostrum pool was -16-fold higher than the CLP and inactivated SAl 1 colostrum pools and -lOOO-fold higher than the control colostrum pool. Higher, but low IgM antibody titers were detected in vaccinated colostrum pools compared with control colostrum, and low IgG2 antibody titers to BRV were detected only in the VLP colostrum pool.\n\nColostral whey from each colostrum pool were processed\" and along w!lth calf sera and faeces','5 were tested in plaque reduction virus neutralization tests to detect neutralizing antibody titers against IND BRV4.\".

Fernandez et al. significantly fewer days of BRV-associated diarrhea than calves receiving control colostrum or no colostrum (Tahlc 2). In addition, diarrhea was significantly less severe (as measured by the cumulative faecal scores) in calves receiving VLP and CLP colostral supplements than in calves in control groups. Although differences among the three vaccine groups were not statistically significant, calves in the VLP colostrum group had the lowest mean days of virus shedding, and the lowest mean cumulative faecal score. None of the VLP colostrum calves experienced BRV-associated diarrhea; however one calf developed BRV-associated diarrhea at PID 12 for 3 days, 6 days after colostrum supplementation ended (data shown are for PID O-10). The onset PID of BRV diarrhea and shedding for each calf are shown (Table 3) .\n\nAntibody titers in serum and faeces of the calves in the different colostrum feeding groups arc summarized (Tghlr 3, Figures I and 2 ). At the initial sampling (-2 h after birth), all calves were negative for rotavirus antibodies (titers ~16) in serum and faeces (data not shown). Serum and faecal antibody titers of calves fed colostrum from vaccinated cows increased after the first feeding, but peak faecal antibody titers were not attained in some calves until 6 days of age (PID 5) possibly due to delayed passage of gastrointestinal contents in these individuals (Table 3) . Serum and faecal IgGl antibodies were significantly higher in calves fed VLP and CLP colostrum than in calves in control groups; titers decreased after cessation of colostrum feeding ( Figures I and 2 ). Titers of serum and faecal IgA antibodies were significantly higher in calves receiving VLP colostrum, than in calves in the other four groups. Virus neutralizing antibody titers were low (GMT< 100) in faeces of calves in all groups, within 5 days of BRV inoculation, with the exception of faeces from calves fed VLP colostrum (GMT = 1660 data not shown), corresponding to the highest VN antibody titers detected in the pooled VLP colostrum (Table I) .\n\nWe attempted to clarify whether calves which were passively protected after inoculation with BRV develop immunity to subsequent challenge. After challenge (PID 21) there were no significant differences in the number of days of BRV shedding, or in days of BRV-associated diarrhea among the vaccine colostrum and control groups ( ,& 4) . However, significant differences were evident in IgGl antibody GMT in serum and faeces at the time of challenge at PID 21, with the highest GMT in the control groups comprised of calves recovered from BRV shedding and diarrhea after inoculation (Tahk 4).\n\nIn calves that received control colostrum or no colostrum, peak IgM antibody responses to BRV were detected in serum and faecal specimens at PID 7-14, preceding\n\nIgGl and IgA antibody responses which occurred at PID 14-21 (F@re.s I and 2). IgG2 antibody titers to BRV were detected only in serum after challenge, at PCD 7-14. IgA antibody titers to BRV increased in serum and faeces of control and no colostrum fed calves after BRV challenge. The highest active antibody responses (IgM and IgGl in serum, and IgM, IgGl and IgA in faeces) occurred in these two groups (Figures 1 and 2) .\n\nIn VLP colostrum fed calves, a low IgM antibody response to BRV was detected in serum and faeces after inoculation, and an increase in IgM and IgGl antibodies was detected in faeces after challenge ( Figures I and 2 ). In the CLP colostrum fed calves, a transient IgM antibody response was detected in faeces after BRV inoculation, but no increased IgGl or IgA antibody responses were detected after BRV inocul'a- \"Unsuckled newborn calves were fed 1% colostrum pools (twice daily from birth through 7 days of age) from the indicated groups and orally inoculated with IND BRV at 20-30 hours of age, and orally challenged with IND BRV at 21 days of age \"Days of diarrhea from PID 0 to PID 10 were analysed as most representative of protective effects of oral colostral supplements fed up to and including PID 6 \"Stool consistency was scored daily (0 = normal to 3 = liquid).

Two of these calves were in the CLP colostrum group, two were in the SAl 1 colostrum group, and two were in the no colostrum group \"Groups in the same column with different letter superscripts differ significantly @ ~0.05); groups in the same column with the same letter superscript do not differ significantly; groups in the same column but lacking letter superscripts do not differ significantly tion or challenge (Fig~-t?.~ 1 and 2). In the inactivated SAI 1 colostrum fed calves, peak IgM responses were detected in serum and faeces after inoculation, preceding peak IgA antibody responses in faeces (F@w 1 and 2) . The IgGl antibody titers in serum and faeces remained constant or decreased after challenge.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that calves fed colostrum from cows immunized with experimental rotavirus vaccines are protected against rotavirus infection and diarrheaJ.'X.'\".

Experimental colostrum pools from VLP, CLP and inactivated SAI 1 vaccinated cows than in the control colostrum pool, the highest IgGI titers were detected in the VLP and CLP colostrum pools. In contrast, the VN antibody titer for the CLP colostrum pool was similar to control colostrum, confirming the inability of VP2 and VP6 proteins to induce VN antibodies even in field exposed, rotavirus seropositive cows.

Peak faecal IgGl antibody titers (PID colostrum or no colostrum.\n\nFaecal antibody titers were O-5) were significantly higher in calves receiving VLP highly variable within groups at the time of inoculation or CLP colostrum antibody titers in these two groups), than in calves in the other three groups. Calves receiving colostrum supplements from vaccinated cows had significantly fewer days of BRV diarrhea and shedding following inoculation, than calves in control groups. It has been reported previously that high VN titers are necessary for complete protection, and that an association exists between VN antibody titers and protection in calves\". Investigators studying mice and piglets have reported a correlation between faecal IgA antibodies or intestinal IgA antibody secreting cells, respectively and protection against rotavirus challenge\"-\". Calves in the present study which received VLP colostrum had high titers of IgGl antibodies in serum and facces, and high titers of IgA antibodies and VN antibodies in faeces. This group of calves had the lowest mean days of BRV shedding, and no BRV diarrhea while the colostrum supplement was being fed. It is unclear whether VN antibodies or IgA antibodies (or both) were instrumental in this protection, as both were elevated in this group.\n\nCalves which received CLP colostrum had similar titers of IgGl antibodies in serum and faeces (PID O-5) as calves in the VLP group, but low titers of IgA and VN antibodies. Although all five calves in the CLP group shed BRV, only one calf experienced diarrhea while receiving the colostrum supplement, indicating at least partial protection.\n\nStudies of mice\".'\"~3\" suggest that high titers of non-neutralizing antibodies to the major structural protein, VP6 can contribute to partial passive protection against rotavirus diarrhea. In calves, passively-derived IgGl is transferred from the serum into the gastrointestinal tract after birth, and these serum-derived IgGl antibodies may contribute to passive intestinal immunity to BRV'\". It is unclear whether the mechanism of passive protection afforded by non-neutralizing IgGl antibodies in calves is cells durin,g dimeric IgA transport)\"'. Whether a receptor for IgGl transport across intestinal epithelial cells exists in calves, comparable to the polymeric Ig receptor for dimeric IgA transport is unknown. Although Fc-specific receptors for IgGl exist on the alveolar epithelial cells of the bovine mammary gland, and contribute to' the selective transport of IgGl from serum into bovine mammary secretions\", the presence of comparable Fc receptors for IgGI on intestinal epithelial cells of calves has not been investigated.\n\nCalves which received colostrum from cows vaccinated with inactivated SAI 1 vaccine, shed virus for a comparable length of time as calves in the CLP group, but had the highest mean days of rotavirus diarrhea, and the highest cumulative faecal scores of calves in the three vaccine groups. Although moderate titers of IgGl antibodies were present in serum and faeces of these calves at PID O-5, IgA and VN antibody titers were low. The higher VN antibody titers in the VLP colostrum calves probably relate to the consistently high VP4 and VP7 antigen concentrations in the VLP vaccine'\" and their presentation in an immunogenic form in association with intact triple-layered particles. The lower concentrati'ons of VP4 and VP7 in the inactivated SAll rotavirus vaccine\" may be a major factor limiting the effectiveness of this type of conventional vaccine, or the process of inactivation may alter the structure or antigens of the native virus particles, decreasing their immunlogenicity.\n\nIn the present study, calves receiving no colostrum or control colostrum developed active immune responses after rotavirus inoculation, with IgM antibodies present in serum and faeces by PID 7. IgA and IgGl antibodies were evident in faeces by PID 14, and IgGl antibodies appeared in serum at the same time. Active immune responses in calves receiving colostrum from vaccinated cows were of lower magnitude, developed later and (when present) consisted mainly of IgM, findings consistent with suppression of active immune responses by maternal antibodie?',\". Surprisingly, although control calves had strong serological evidence of active immune responses to BRV by the time of challenge, and the other three groups did not, there was little BRV diarrhea or shedding in any of the groups. The possibility that immune priming occurred in the presence of maternal antibodies deserves further investigation. An alternative explanation would be that sufficient residual passive antibodies (resecreted from the serum into the intestine) were present at PID 21 to provide the observed level of protection against BRV challenge exposure.\n\nOur results support the ability of a heterotypic SAll VLP vaccine or SAll CLP and inactivated vaccines (P[2]G3) to induce complete or partial passive protection in calves, against a serotypically unrelated BRV strain (P[5]G6). Such 'VLP vaccines possess potential advantages over existing BRV vaccines including safety (due to inability to replicate and a lack of adventitious agents potentially present in live vaccines), and the consistent expression of VP4 and VP7 on VLP in a stable and immunogenic form. Additional studies are needed to analyse the role and mechanism of passive immunity associated with the CLP vaccine which induced non-neutralizing antibodies to the major structural protein VP6, but nevertheless mediated at least partial passive protection in calves."}
