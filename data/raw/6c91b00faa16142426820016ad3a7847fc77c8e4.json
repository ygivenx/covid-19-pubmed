{"title": "Specific ACE2 Expression in Cholangiocytes May Cause Liver Damage After 2019-nCoV Infection", "body": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, temporally named as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO), was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1] . The novel coronavirus was isolated from the airway epithelial cells of patients with pneumonia that was epidemiologically linked to Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Within 2 months, 2019-nCoV spreads rapidly from Wuhan to all provinces in China, and more than 20 countries around the globe. As of 20:00 on February 3, 2020, 17,335 cases were confirmed in China, 21,559 were suspected, with an alarming number of 361 fatalities. Unfortunately, the numbers of both infected patients and fatalities are still growing rapidly with no effective drugs clinically approved. 2019-nCoV is closely related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and was proposed to share the same receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS [2] [3] [4] .\n\nThe liver, being one of the largest organs of the body in vertebrates, is located between the portal and the systemic circulation. It is constantly exposed to dietary antigens, viruses, and bacterial products with inflammatory potential. The liver damage can be caused by multitudinous factors such as exposure to toxins, excessive alcohol consumption, bile duct prevention obstruction, and viral infections [5] . Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the main causative viral agent for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in China [6] . A recent study also found acute infection of hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes varying degrees of liver damage [7] . Liver damage was reported in SARS-infected patients [8] . \n\nMacrovascularEndo.\n\nOtherEndo.\n\nOther Table 1 . Patient information of the in-house cohort.\n\n.
