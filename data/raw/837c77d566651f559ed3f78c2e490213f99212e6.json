{"title": "The geometry of dependence: solitary bee larvae prioritize carbohydrate over protein in", "body": "Bees are critical not only to global ecological stability but also to humans' food security, 44 as major pollinators for 90% of the world's food crops (Klein et al., 2018 (Klein et al., , 2007 Potts et al., 45 2016) and many wildflowers (Ollerton et al., 2011) . Many wild and domesticated bees have seen 46 marked declines in recent decades, with both significant range contractions and extinctions 47 maintain themselves (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012a) . Understanding how animals cope in a 66 changing nutritional environment requires us to understand not only how animals gather the 67 correct balance of nutrients they need, but also how they adjust their foraging when resources are 68 imbalanced (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012b) . 69 In bees, the larval stage is where almost all growth occurs (Nijhout et al., 2014) as well as distinctly different diet to adults, adults primarily feeding on nectar (although see Cane, 2016) 77 and larvae feeding almost solely on pollen (Muth et al., 2016) . 78 The Geometric Framework for Nutrition (GF) allows us to investigate foraging decisions 79 made by animals in multi-dimensional \"nutrient space\" (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012b, 80 1993). The GF can be used to determine an organism's intake target (the optimal amount and 81 balance of macronutrients that an animal should aim to consume in order to achieve maximal 82 fitness (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 1993) as well as how that target is achieved. Additionally, 83 we can use the GF to investigate the rule of compromise -that is, the rules governing 84 consumption that an animal uses when it is unable to reach its intake target with the nutritional 85 options available (e.g. Lee et al., 2004b; Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2001) . 86 The GF has provided profound insights into broad topics from ant agriculture (Shik et al., 87 2016) to human obesity (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2005) .

This means that nutritional insights 95 from GF studies into the parent-offspring relationship are currently limited. 96 In solitary bees, by contrast, typically each reproductive female provisions each of her 97 offspring individually with a single, independent \"pollen ball\" before sealing the cell and 98 leaving. This pollen ball contains all the resources that the larva will need to grow to adulthood. Scriber and Slansky, 1981) in order to determine 122 their rules of compromise and the diet composition that maximised fitness. In a second \"choice\" 123 phase, we then provided larvae with targeted choices between sets of two imbalanced diets that 124 differed in their P:C ratios to determine whether larvae consistently aim for an intake target.

Completed nests, signified by a mud plug at the entrance, were then brought into the 157 laboratory. Early trials revealed that fresh eggs and newly emerged larvae were too fragile for 158 manipulation. Therefore, newly emerged larvae were left alone for two days before we 159 transferred them to a single-occupancy nest and assigned each to an experimental treatment.\n\nThe majority of nests were filled before the larvae hatched.

Provisions were replaced weekly, to avoid desiccation and mould formation, 204 or when fully consumed by larvae. Weight of provision consumed was recorded upon provision 205 replacement. Control larvae underwent the same manipulation but were supplied with natural 206 provisions, i.e. a pollen ball from a cell containing an experimental larva whose pollen ball had 207 been removed. Should they finish this provision, it was replenished with a fresh pollen ball, 208 making the simplifying assumption that all parentally provided provisions were of equal 209 composition. A \"water control\" group, containing pollen provisions but no larvae, was used to 210 track water loss from the diets, going through the same weighing regime as above with weight 211 loss recorded at each swap.\n\nNests were checked daily to ensure the health of the larvae. Final provision consumption 213 was calculated once larvae had pupated by summing consumption across diet changes.

Response surfaces were calculated for cocoon weight and visualised using non-parametric 236 thin-plate splines. Larvae that died pre-pupation were not used in the calculation of the mean P 237 and C consumption for diets in either experiment, but were used in analyses involving survival.\n\nIn the choice experiment, mean final consumption of each nutrient was investigated using 239 linear models with diet combination, dilution and their interaction as predictors. The minimal 240 model was determined using reverse stepwise model selection and pairwise differences among 241 groups were examined using Tukey's Post Hoc tests. We additionally tested whether larvae were 242 exercising a choice at all, i.e. whether they were consuming the available diets non-randomly. 243 We calculated the expected protein and carbohydrate that would be consumed under random 244 consumption of each diet by assigning exactly half the total amount of food consumed by each 245 larva to each of the two choices offered to that larva. We then re-ran our models, using \"random 246 vs. observed consumption\" as a predictor variable. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Note that no non-linear effects were observed, that is, we did not identify an 272 optimal amount of protein or carbohydrate that maximised cocoon weight.\n\nDiet also influenced the survival of larvae, with those held on the more dilute diets 274 suffering greater mortality (parametric survival regression, \u03c7 2 =72.7, df=6, p<0.0001, Fig. 4) . Despite not converging upon an intake target in nutritional space, larvae were 296 nevertheless not consuming the diets at random, instead seeming to align on a P:C ratio of about 297 1:1.8 (Fig. 6a) . For both carbohydrate and protein we saw differences in consumption from what 298 would have been expected for each larva based on random consumption, and this effect was 299 dependent on the specific set of diet choices (carbohydrate: linear mixed models with ID as a 300 random effect and \"diet combination\" and \"random or observed\" as predictor variables; dropping 301 the interaction, \u03c7 2 =42.76, df=3, p<0.0001; protein: dropping the interaction, \u03c7 2 =16.91, df=3, 302 p<0.001, Fig. 7) . 303 Moreover, when visualised as the amounts of P and C consumed during each 48h 304 treatment period (Fig. 7a, b) , it is clear that larvae were achieving a degree of homeostasis in C 305 consumption compared to what would be expected under random consumption of each diet 306 choice (Fig. 7c, Fig. 7d ). In contrast, their consumption of P aligned very closely with what 307 would be expected under random consumption (Fig. 7) .

Nevertheless, (Bosch 341 and Vicens, 2005) found little correlation between body size in O.cornuta and fecundity, which 342 was instead more related to longevity and provisioning rate. It is also worth noting that although 343 we found that high carbohydrate increased cocoon weight we did not identify a fitness peak at 344 which cocoon weight was maximised. Further work could employ a wider range of diet ratios in 345 order to locate this. Although high-carbohydrate consumption increased survival to pupation, among those larvae 355 that ended up eating low quantities of carbohydrate, protein consumption mediated survival, with 356 those on higher protein diets (higher P:C) experiencing greater survival (Fig. 5) . This pattern Interestingly, when allowed to self-select their diets, O.bicornis larvae did not cluster in 380 nutritional space but were instead spread out along a P:C ratio of 1:1.8 (Fig. 6a) , approximately 381 according to overall diet concentration. Notwithstanding the variable amounts actually eaten, 382 assuming at least that this 1:1.8 ratio reflects the ratio of the larvae's true intake target, this (Fig. 2b) , they were clearly unable to compensate for the 396 reduced nutrient concentration, consuming less of each macronutrient than larvae fed more 397 concentrated diets (Fig. 2a) . Despite the fact that total food consumption was similar across 398 treatments in the choice phase (Fig. 6b) , larvae on less concentrated diets may have been unable 399 to reach the same point in nutritional space due to consumption rate limitations. Raubenheimer, 2012b). Larval bees feed on pollen, which is amongst the most protein-rich of 425 plant tissues (Mattson, 1980) , and, as such, carbohydrate may be the more limiting nutrient for 426 larvae. It is likely that starch, the standard form of digestible carbohydrate storage in pollen 427 (Pacini, 1996) , rarely exceeds the protein content of pollen; (Roulston and Buchmann, 2000) 428 found that average starch content of pollen ranged from 0-22%, considerably less than the range 429 for protein (2-60%; Roulston and Cane, 2000a) . Thus, the relative abundance of protein in pollen The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/397802 doi: bioRxiv preprint may help to explain why O.bicornis larvae appeared to eat to a carbohydrate target whilst 431 tolerating varying levels of protein.\n\nThe fact that larvae consumed very different amounts of protein, despite its importance to 433 larval insects, suggests that bee larvae may be vulnerable to environmental variations in the 434 protein:carbohydrate ratio of pollen -in a similar but opposite manner to humans, who will 435 consume excesses of carbohydrate in order to eat enough protein, rendering them vulnerable to 436 variation in protein:carbohydrate ratio of food (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2005) . Since bee 437 larvae appear to be able to regulate carbohydrate, they may therefore rely on parents to regulate The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
