{"title": "Composite nonwovens in medical applications", "body": "Composite nonwovens are fi brous materials, in which several layers of different fi bres are either bonded together or combined with other textile components, while their felt characteristics remain predominant. Composite nonwovens are generally prepared by combining multiple fi brous layers of different types of polymers, fi bres or textile components. Integration of multiple fi brous layers can be achieved by passing them through a set of hot rollers, needle-punching, stitchbonding, ultrasound treatment or high-frequency welding. Such nonwoven products can be tailored to meet the requirements of the following specifi c clinical applications:\n\n\u2022 personal healthcare/hygiene products, such as surgical gowns, masks, wipes, surgical drapes and bedding;\n\n\u2022 non-implantable medical dressings, including wound dressings and bandages; \u2022 implantable medical products, including scaffolds for tissue regeneration and orthopaedic structures.\n\nNanofi brous nonwoven matrices, made by using the electrospinning technique, are beyond the scope of this article. However, extensive research work is being conducted in the development of electrospun matrices made up of composite nanofi bres for medical applications (Soliman et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2009; Kai et al. 2013 ).\n\nThe main function of a surgical gown is to provide an appropriate level of hygiene, comfort and protection for surgeons and healthcare workers from blood-borne pathogens. The recent prevalence of infectious diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) demonstrates the critical need to develop effi cient surgical gowns, gloves and masks to ensure the highest level of protection.\n\nA critical performance factor in protective surgical apparel relates to the ability to provide a barrier to microbial transfer from a non-sterile to a sterile side of the fabric. Microbes and pathogens can pass through the fabric, carried by dust particles or liquids such as body fl uids (blood, perspiration, etc.) . According to the defi nition of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA), liquidresistant apparel allows minimal amounts of liquid to penetrate when pressure is applied. Liquid-proof apparel does not allow any liquid to penetrate at all (Mangram et al. 1999) .\n\nThere is great demand for cheap disposable gowns in the cost-conscious healthcare sector. Over the last few years various strategies for developing singleuse fabrics have evolved, using spunbonded-meltblown-spunbonded (SMS), spunlace hydroentangled, triplex or bicomponent fi brous webs, with or without chemical fi nishes to resist liquid penetration. Disposable SMS fabric can be formed by sandwiching an inner thermoplastic meltblown microfi brous web between two outer nonwoven webs of substantially continuous thermoplastic spunbonded fi lament, where the spunbond layer provides strength and dimensional stability while the meltblown layer provides the barrier property. The microfi brous nonwoven meltblown layers provide a barrier impervious to pathogens in the composite nonwoven fabric. However, various surgical procedures entail an extent of splashing, liquid strike-through, aerosol generation, or applied pressure, and can be of long duration. Care should therefore be taken in selecting single-or multiple-use gowns during specifi c procedures. Leonas and Jinkins (1997) compared eight commercially available surgical gowns, among which fi ve were disposable nonwovens and three were reusable woven fabrics. Four of the fi ve nonwoven fabrics investigated were made from polypropylene-based SMS nonwoven fabrics and hydroentangled wood pulp and polyester of spun-lace fabrics. SMS nonwovens showed better effi ciency in preventing the transmission of S. aureus and E. coli in a saline solution, as compared to woven fabrics. Lankester et al. (2002) studied the extent of bacterial penetration through disposable gowns made of spun-bonded polyester and wood pulp, as compared to reusable woven polyester gowns; the results clearly showed a comparatively inferior barrier property for reusable woven polyester fabrics. Taken together, as a very generalized conclusion (McCullough and Schoenberger 1991), polypropylene-based gowns (for example, 97-100% polypropylene, SMS laminates) provided the greatest protection against blood strike-through and microbial penetration. Gowns composed of a single layer of nonwoven fabric provided the next highest level of effectiveness. Reusable gowns composed of 100% woven cotton provided a minimal level of protection.\n\nOther than surgical gowns, several other wearable products are currently demanding attention from researchers, such as shoe covers, caps, facemasks to be worn by surgeons during surgery, facemasks for patients or caregivers, facemasks for health workers handling outbreaks of airborne diseases (SARS virus, H1N1 fl u, bird fl u, etc.), and masks for sanitation workers working in dusty environments.\n\nPreviously, all such reusable hospital garments were made using conventional textiles (cotton, cotton-polyester, etc.), but these have now been linked to increases in so-called 'Hospital Acquired Infections'. Pathogenic bacteria present on the scalp and skin are reported to have caused epidemics (Dineen and Drusin 1973) ; it is therefore highly important that effi cient coverings are available during surgery. All over the world, major care is being taken to reduce patient-to-patient transmission of resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus . Nonwoven products remain the most common choice for protection, sometimes with an additional active coating. Surgical facemasks are usually composed of three layers of an SMS nonwoven fabric, where the meltblown material acts as a fi lter. The design of most surgical masks includes three pleats/folds to allow the user to expand the mask to cover the area under the nose and under the chin. This design may be suffi cient to protect the wearer in dusty environments, but these products are not particularly effective in offering protection from airborne pandemic diseases or in environments full of aerosols.\n\nSeveral new designs of respirator mask that use advanced strategies are currently coming in the healthcare markets. For example, the multiple-use respirator mask introduced by Carey International Ltd, Westerly, RI, USA, consists of a needle-punched, four-ply nonwoven fabric in which two outer layers contain silver/copper zeolite compounds permanently embedded onto the fi bres, and two inner fi ltration layers are designed to prevent microbial or particulate penetration (complying with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health standards N95 and N99). The outer layers have been demonstrated to kill Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and deactivate strains of H1N1 and H5N1, as well as common fl u and other viruses. The N95 masks offer 95% or higher particle fi ltration effi ciency.\n\nThe main limitation in the performance of shoe covers for clinicians and healthcare professionals is frequent rupturing during use (Carter 1990; Jones and Jakeways 1998) . Blood easily soaks through many commercially available shoe covers, and better bacterial and liquid barrier properties are needed.\n\nAlthough all these products have been commonly used for many years (Eisen 2011) , there is scope for innovation in their design. For example, facemasks for health workers involved in fl u pandemics must remain effective for at least a few weeks, but the standard single-use masks currently available remain effective for only a few hours. Effi cient pathogen monitoring and detection mechanisms should be available for these masks.\n\nThe wipes market is experiencing massive growth, and there has been a constant stream of new nonwoven products across a number of categories, which have been innovatively applied. Examples include Procter & Gamble's 'Swiffer' household fl oor wipes and L'Oreal's make-up removal wipes 'Revitalift'. An extensive review of wipes is given in Chapter 6 of this book.\n\nMammalian embryos and some amphibians can spontaneously regenerate their tissues after severe injury. Adult mammals typically recover from such injuries by a 'repair' process, eventually developing scars. At the price of wound closure, severe wound contraction and scar tissue formation often cause serious clinical complications and life-long disfi gurement for the survivor. During healing of skin wounds, a group of contractile cells (myofi broblasts) migrate in the wound bed. These cells express cytoplasmic bundles of microfi laments (stress fi bres), using which they apply contractile forces to shrink the injured site. Eventually the wound site is fi lled by an irregular dense collagen fi brous matrix (Tomasek et al. 2002) . When a nonwoven matrix is implanted within the wound bed, those contractile cells migrate randomly, following the randomly oriented fi brous architecture of the nonwoven matrix. This can result in disorientation of major axes of contractile cells and the disruption of organized cell contraction at the edges of the wound. Thus, randomization of individual force vectors of contractile cells will reduce rapid contraction of wound edges ( Fig. 9 .1 ). A signifi cant reduction in the number of contractile cells has also been reported when the wound is treated with a nonwoven scaffold during dermis regeneration (Murphy et al. 1990 ). Despite detailed understanding of wound healing mechanisms, scarless healing in adult humans still remains a utopian concept, but extensive research is ongoing to develop bioresponsive fi brous material, such as collagenglycosaminoglycan bicomponent fi brous web, which will be able to inhibit scar formation and cause controlled contraction (Yannas 2013) . Many basic composite nonwoven dressings are commercially available and are regularly used. These are relatively inexpensive, readily available, and versatile enough to treat several types of wounds. The simplest form is as a single nonwoven layer with a transparent waterproof backing (generally polyurethane fi lm), which forms an attachment to the skin to keep the dressing in place while the nonwoven absorbent layer contains medication to promote healing.\n\nStrategies to induce fast clotting are critically needed for wound dressing materials to achieve minimum blood loss and absorption of exudates. Numerous commercial wound dressing products use composite nonwoven adhesive tape (usually polyester) as an absorbent pad/wound contact layer. In some dressings, these absorbent pads are placed continuously edge-to-edge, whereas in some products they are located as an island in the central region of the dressing. Such dressings can handle low-to-moderate exudate. In some dressings, such as Kendall's Viasorb, super-absorbent polymers may be added for handling moderately-to heavily-exuding wounds.\n\n9.1 (a) Skin wounds without nonwoven myofi broblasts get oriented to form scar tissue; (b) in the presence of nonwoven fabric, random scattering of myofi broblasts inhibit scar tissue formation.\n\nTissue engineering is a rapidly developing multidisciplinary fi eld and holds great promise for the repair and reconstruction of tissues and organs damaged by disease, accidents, congenital abnormality and defects. There are numerous methods of scaffold fabrication, but porous sponge-like scaffolds made using porogen-leaching techniques and nonwoven-based structures are the two most common. These offer much in terms of high surface area, porosity and pore size distribution, ease of preparation, and fi brous randomness, as per anatomical requirement. High porosity and pore interconnectivity are needed for cell attachment, migration and uniform distribution throughout the scaffold.\n\nIn the early stages of embrogenesis, trophoblast cells form an outer layer of blastocyst to provide nutrients to the embryo. Culturing human trophoblast cells on needle-punched nonwoven polyethylene terephthalate fabric has shown that metabolic activities and proliferation rate are dependent on the porosity of the nonwoven scaffold. However, a higher extent of cellular differentiation has been observed with high-porosity mesh than with low-porosity mesh, as evidenced by the expression of specifi c biomarkers (Ma et al. 2000) . These fi ndings are important, as a critical balance between cell proliferation and differentiation can govern tissue development.\n\nHuman embryonic stem cells have the potential to differentiate into all three germ layers and develop into any tissue types found in our body. These cells can proliferate in long-term culture in vitro . However, until recently, undifferentiated embryonic stem cells needed culture on a layer of feeder cells, such as mouse embryonic fi broblasts. Feeder cells produce some important soluble factors, such as the cytokine Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), which are critically needed for embryonic stem cells to maintain their undifferentiated, pluripotent phenotype. Cetinkaya et al. (2007) generated carboxylic acid groups on poly(ethylene terephthalate) fi brous nonwoven material by hydrolysis reaction, which helped in immobilizing LIF via ionic interaction with amino groups. LIF-immobilized scaffold supported the growth of embryonic stem cells, but undifferentiated morphology was not retained as anticipated.\n\nFirst-generation tissue engineering experiments targeted cartilage regeneration using poly lactic acid/poly glycolic acid (PLA/PGA)-based nonwoven matrices. For example, Shieh et al. (2004) used PGA nonwoven fi brous scaffolds, where fi bres were treated with poly-L-lactide (PLLA)-chloroform solution; a human earshaped architecture was developed using a negative mould. Sheep chondrocytes were then cultured to develop tissue-engineered auricular cartilage.\n\nHyaluronic acid is an important molecule in the maintenance of the physicochemical characteristics of the cartilage extracellular matrix. Sodium hyaluronate salt is water-soluble, so sodium hyaluronate is esterifi ed in order to impart water insolubility. Esterifi ed hyaluronic acid fi bres show easy processability and enhanced residence time in vivo . Esterifi ed hyaluronic acid-based nonwovens (e.g., Hyaff-11, Fidia Advanced Biopolymers, Italy) have been extensively used for knee-joint cartilage tissue engineering (Moretti et al. 2005) and nose reconstruction (Farhadi et al. 2006) . Statistically, chondrocytes produced a signifi cantly higher amount of glycosaminoglycan and collagen in the nonwoven scaffold ( Fig. 9 .2 ) as compared to porogen-leached poly ethelene glycol terephthalate/poly butylene terephthalate (PEGT/PBT) scaffolds . Nonwoven porous polymer tubes fabricated from nonwoven meshes of polyglycolic acid fi bres have been seeded with rat hepatocytes and the constructs successfully implanted in small intestinal submucosa (Kim and Mooney 1998) .\n\nSpinal cord damage can cause paraplegia or quadriplegia. Attempts have been made to fi ll gaps in the spinal cord by seeding adult rat spinal cord-derived cells in a polyglycolic acid nonwoven mesh (Albany International, Albany, NY, USA); in these experiments, the construct was implanted into a 3-4 mm-long gap. Cells gradually differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes and contributed to the restoration of function to the lower limbs. After six months, coordinated gait in hind limbs and motor control of the tail were noticed. This work demonstrated the fascinating promise for spinal cord repair by incorporating undifferentiated neural progenitor cells into implants to fi ll gaps in the damaged spinal cord (Vacanti et al. 2001 ).\n\nWakita and colleagues developed siloxane-poly(lactic acid)-calcium carbonate composite fi brous structures so that mineral components are agglomerated within the PLA fi bre matrix. Such nonwoven scaffolds release calcium and silicate ions, and have potential for bone regeneration (Wakita et al. 2011) . However, most 9.2 Cartilage tissue engineering using nonwoven scaffold. nonwoven scaffolds reported so far have poor compressive strength and are hence unsuitable for bone tissue engineering. For the purpose of bone regeneration, attempts have been made to develop fi bre-reinforced polymer foam. The reinforcing effect of fi bres within a matrix becomes effective when fi bres are uniformly distributed throughout the matrix, the degree of fi bre-polymer contact is maximized and fi bre-fi bre contact is kept at a minimum. Generally, this type of scaffold is made using a solvent-casting technique. Mandal et al. (2012) attempted to develop a silk-fi bre-reinforced scaffold to simulate the compressive modulus of bone. Interfacial bonding between the silk fi bre and the silk matrix resulted in an compressive modulus of 10 MPa in hydrated conditions. Such matrix stiffness and surface roughness support osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to prepare bone-like tissue (Mandal et al. 2012) .\n\nThere is no successful clinical option available for patients suffering from endstage liver disease. Bioartifi cial liver support systems based on hollow fi bre technology have undergone clinical trials and have been demonstrated to be promising (Watanabe et al. 1997 ). In this system, hepatocytes are placed inside a chambered cartridge. When patients' blood is passed through, cells process toxins from the blood and synthesize proteins and metabolites. This plasma is then returned to the patient's body. In such systems, oxygenated plasma fl ows through the fi bre capillary, but hepatocytes are attached in extracapillary spaces. As a result, the oxygen supply to the hepatocytes is inadequate because the oxygenbinding ability of plasma is less than one-tenth of that of whole blood. This limited oxygen supply leads to insuffi cient function of hepatocytes. Li et al. (2006) used a roller pump in which polysulfone hollow fi bres were spirally wound with polytetrafl uoroethylene nonwoven fabric. Nonwoven fabric allowed attachment and aggregation of hepatocytes, and semipermeable membranes of hollow fi bres served as gas exchangers and immuno-protective barriers. Whole blood passed through the intra-luminal space of the hollow fi bres and was exposed to the hepatocytes for effective oxygen supply, CO 2 removal and exchange of metabolic waste and nutrients. Hence, the diffusion distance was reduced and mass exchange took place akin to that in the sinusoids of the liver parenchyma.\n\nA hernia is a protrusion of a tissue through the wall of the cavity in which it is normally contained. Nonwoven meshes should be easy to use in both laparoscopic and open hernia repair. Fibrous capsule formation, cellular attachment and mesh contraction result in the recurrence of hernias in most patients. Woven polypropylene meshes frequently form adhesion and fi stula when transplanted intra-peritoneally. Polypropylene nonwoven fabric has been demonstrated to overcome such complications due to its microporous structure giving a high capacity for tissue in-growth and integration (Langenbach et al. 2003) . Raptis et al. (2011) implanted woven as well as nonwoven polypropylene fabrics into 12 pigs to compare ease of incorporation and removal by histology and adhesion formation 90 days after implantation. Intraperitoneally, woven polypropylene fabric became fully peritonealized, but generated thick and abundant adhesions. Interestingly, polypropylene nonwoven fabric became fully peritonealized and generated only very thin adhesions, and to a strikingly lesser extent. Woven meshes formed comparatively dense adhesions that could only be detached with greater diffi culty than with nonwoven meshes (Raptis et al. 2011) . Weyhe et al. (2006) and Dubova et al. (2007) investigated the infl ammatory response in rats during abdominal wall reconstruction using polypropylene fabrics, at different time points after surgery. One group of rats received heavy woven polypropylene meshes with macro-dimensional pores, and the other group of rats received light nonwoven fabrics with micro-dimensional pores. A more severe infl ammatory reaction was noticed in the group which received nonwoven fabrics. Interestingly, however, Dubova et al. (2007) noticed less intense fi brosis in the nonwoven fabric, with uniform tissue growth after 28 days, while Weyhe et al. (2006) reported a decline in the concentration of infl ammatory cells over time in both groups. Fibrous tissue formation took place in both types of hernia mesh after 45 days, with no statistical difference between the groups.\n\nRed blood cell concentrates and platelet concentrates are commonly transfused to patients. It has been observed that the presence of white blood cells (leukocytes) in blood during transfusion may cause several adverse reactions, including recurrent febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction with high fever and vomiting, platelet refractoriness, graft versus host disease, and transmission of viruses (e.g. cytomegalovirus and HIV). The preferred method is therefore to reduce leukocytecounts before storage of peripheral blood at the blood bank. Kim et al. (2009) developed meltblown poly(butylene terephthalate) nonwoven and graft-polymerized acrylic acid onto it by oxygen plasma glow discharge treatment. They then immersed the nonwoven fabric in an aqueous solution containing high concentrations of phosphate and calcium ions to produce a thin layer of hydroxyapatite. This composite nonwoven was found to successfully remove 98.5% of leukocytes and recovered 99.5% of erythrocytes. This strategy seems promising compared to the standard procedure of removing cell populations by centrifugation.\n\nBone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells are regularly used for regenerative medicine strategies. Isolation of these stem cells from total marrow is usually conducted using a sucrose-based density gradient column, which is a time-consuming process. After screening 200 biomaterials, Ito et al. (2010) selected rayon-polyethylene nonwoven fabric for the development of a fi lter for the collection of mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow hematopoietic mononuclear cells. Mesenchymal stem cells adhered tightly to highly hydrophilic and rough surfaces as compared to hydrophobic and smooth surfaces, resulting in a rapid and effi cient method of cell isolation fi ltration.\n\nIncontinence products\n\nHealthcare and hygiene products for incontinence tend to basically consist of an absorbent pad and skin contact layer and a transparent (waterproof) fi lm adhesive tape. Composite nonwoven based incontinence and hygiene products can be classifi ed as follows:\n\n\u2022 Babycare products: baby nappies and baby wipes (dry or moisturized). \u2022 Feminine hygiene products: sanitary napkins, panty shields and liners. \u2022 Adult incontinence: adult nappies, nursing pads, disposable underwear, bladder control pads.\n\nThese products are discussed in detail in Chapter 5 of this book.\n\nAdvances in the development of composite nonwovens for various medical applications are signifi cantly changing the lives of many people. However, the emergence of drug-resistant microbial strains demands more effi cient detection mechanisms for surgical drapings and masks and better anti-viral, anti-microbial strategies. The detection, prevention and killing of viruses and bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , hepatitis, SARS or H1N1, remain permanent challenges in the development of protection for healthcare workers. Although signifi cant progress has already been made in research on nonwovens, structure-function relationships still need to be elucidated. Moreover, in order to face up to such challenging problems, researchers should not be afraid of blurring the boundaries of traditional textile technology. A multi-disciplinary approach is required to develop the next generation of products -for example, electronicsembedded nonwovens for effi cient detection of viral particles on a facemask -to improve understanding of the interaction of the nonwoven matrix with cells and the related cellular signalling process to induce organ regeneration. As boundaries between disciplines blur, multi-disciplinary research will become the norm rather than the exception, stimulating further growth in the nonwovens sector. "}
