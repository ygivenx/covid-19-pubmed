{"title": "Microbiology in Clinical Pathology", "body": "Bacteria Single-celled organisms called prokaryotes that lack a nuclear membrane. They are usually 0.5-5.0 mm in length. They may be spherical (cocci) or rod-shaped (bacilli), curved, or spiral-shaped. Biosafety levels The level of biocontainment precautions required to handle microorganisms. The lowest level, level 1, concerns organisms that are not typically dangerous, while level 4 concerns organisms that are highly dangerous and require many precautions. Most work in a clinical microbiology hospital laboratory is performed under BSL2. Epidemiology The field of study involving the incidence, distribution, and control of disease. Infection control practitioners and public health authorities track the epidemiology of multiple diseases to contain outbreaks and prevent disease. Fungi Multicelled eukaryotic organisms including yeasts and molds. Dimorphic molds grow as either yeast or mold, depending on temperature. MALDI-TOF Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry is a method to analyze biomolecules by laser fragmentation and soft ionization within a protective matrix, followed by measurement of spectra of flight times in a vacuum. By analyzing primarily ribosomal proteins, microorganisms are identified to species level in clinical laboratories. Next-generation sequencing A method to determine the order of nucleotides of DNA using a high-throughput technology that parallelizes the sequencing process, producing many sequences at the same time, utilizing a variety of chemistries for signal detection. These methods are less expensive than older sequencing methods and are used to produce large quantities of precise data. Parasite An organism that lives within or on another organism. Parasites often have complicated life cycles, utilizing intermediate hosts, and include a wide range of organisms from microscopic protozoa to very large worms. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction A variant of polymerase chain reaction used to amplify DNA or RNA (if preceded by a reverse transcriptase reaction) by monitoring amplification with a fluorescent signal at each cycle of the reaction and comparing the signal to a standard curve to determine the quantity of starting nucleic acid. Viruses Submicroscopic infectious agents consisting of RNA or DNA surrounded by a protein coat only capable of replicating inside host cells. Some viruses also have a lipid envelope. \n\nMicrobes are ubiquitous in nature and number in the thousands. They are both essential for our health and the cause of devastating infectious diseases. Diagnostic microbiology must identify the pathogenic microbes that cause disease and distinguish them from normal flora and from environmental organisms not causing disease. The diagnostic microbiology laboratory is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. Diagnostic microbiology utilizes methods that have been in place for hundreds of years, such as the Gram stain, and recently developed techniques that allow very sophisticated analysis of gene sequence and protein profiles. Routinely, a hospital laboratory identifies the organisms causing the most common\n\ninfections, yet laboratory personnel must also be alert for unusual pathogens and for the next epidemic. Diagnostic microbiology is a subsection of clinical pathology within the hospital laboratory, usually as part of a department of pathology or a department of laboratory medicine. Microbiology laboratories are also located in independent reference laboratories that serve large geographic areas and that offer a broad test menu including more esoteric tests for less common infections. A director of microbiology in a hospital or clinical reference laboratory may take several routes for training, as directors may earn either an MD or a PhD degree. If the director is a physician, then residency in either pathology or infectious diseases is most common, with a possible additional medical microbiology fellowship. If the director has a PhD in a biological field as initial training, a 2-year fellowship in medical microbiology is required. Certification may be obtained from the American Board of Pathology or from the American Academy of Microbiology, depending on the training path. Staff working in the hospital laboratory may be trained in a 4-year medical technologist program, or they may receive on-the-job training following an undergraduate 4-year degree in a biological field, or technologist-specific training following the original undergraduate degree. Certification of technologists is completed through the American Society for Clinical Pathology.\n\nThe diseases caused by microbes and the diagnostic methods used to detect microbes vary widely based on type of microbe: viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites.\n\nThe very small size of viruses (most are 20-400 nm) and their dependence on host cells for replication drive the methods used to detect them. Viruses typically carry DNA or RNA, not both, surrounded by a protein shell and in some viruses, a lipid coat. Viral infections may be acute or chronic and clinical symptoms of viral infection may be florid or absent. Viruses may cause rapid death of a host cell or integrate viral genetic material into the host genome. Viral infections can be mild and common, such as rhinovirus causing colds, or rare and devastating, such as Ebola virus causing hemorrhagic fever. Viruses may be highly contagious, such as influenza, or have limited transmission capability, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Figure 1 ).\n\nBacteria are unicellular organisms lacking a nuclear membrane. The cell wall may have a thick peptidoglycan layer or a thin peptidoglycan layer along with a lipid-containing outer membrane. A few pathogenic bacteria, such as mycoplasma, lack a cell wall. Mycobacteria have a cell wall containing mycolic acid, a property affecting virulence, stability, and our detection methods.\n\nFungi are eukaryotic organisms that exist as a unicellular yeast or a filamentous mold. Yeast replicate asexually, whereas mold may replicate sexually or asexually. A class of fungi called dimorphic fungi have two forms, a yeast form and a mold form. The dimorphic molds Histoplasma, Blastomyces, and Coccidioides are prominent pathogens.\n\nParasites are eukaryotic microbes of vastly diverse forms. Protozoa are quite small, while some parasitic worms are very large. Parasites can have very complex life cycles, evolving through multiple developmental stages in one or two intermediate animal hosts before infecting the definitive host. Parasitic diseases are particularly geography-specific, so knowing the home, travel history, lifestyles, pets, and potential exposures of a patient is a required part of any medical evaluation when creating a parasitic differential diagnosis. \n\nThere are many different microorganisms that colonize humans, in an organ-specific way ( Table 1) . Normal flora are beneficial to us for their roles in food metabolism, protection against pathogenic microbes, production of growth factors, and balancing the interactions of the innate and adaptive immune system with the environment. It is very important to consider the normal flora when interpreting the results of a positive culture. Some normal flora are very rarely pathogens and would not be treated by physicians. An example would be Lactobacillus from a vaginal specimen and most Corynebacteria from a wound/skin specimen. Other organisms recovered are always considered pathogens and must be treated. Examples include rabies virus, Bacillus anthracis, Plasmodium, Listeria, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A third group of organisms are potential pathogens but may colonize some individuals. This group would include viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus, and quite a few of the organisms listed in the table of normal flora. Therefore, it is essential that the laboratory results be interpreted in the context of the clinical scenario. Furthermore, there are many environmental microorganisms that are not associated with human disease. The processes routinely used in the clinical laboratory are tailored to detect those organisms known to cause disease.\n\nWhen analyzing human pathogens, it is essential to understand the risk to the laboratory professional while culturing or processing the samples. There are four biosafety levels (BSLs) of increasing precautions as risk increases. BSL1 involves agents that are not known to cause disease consistently in healthy adults. Most routine work in the hospital laboratory, involving the handling of agents that are associated with human disease, is performed with BSL2 precautions in place. Biosafety cabinets for physical containment devises are used for any steps that cause splashing or aerosolization. Personal protective equipment such as lab coats, gloves, and face protection are used as needed per procedure guidelines. BSL3 levels guide the testing of agents that cause more serious disease and/or have a higher potential for aerosolization such as M. tuberculosis and Coccidioides immitis. Increased protection is obtained by limited access to the room containing the lab bench, negative airflow into the laboratory, increased use of the biosafety cabinet, and increased steps to decontaminate waste. BSL4 laboratories are much less common and they deal with the most dangerous agents such as hemorrhagic fever viruses. Additional precautions include very restricted access, additional training and monitoring of staff, changes of clothing, and a positive pressure personnel suit.\n\nThe burden of infectious diseases globally is enormous with approximately a third of deaths globally due to communicable diseases. Although tremendous progress has been made during this past century to reduce morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases, especially in developed countries, the percentage of deaths due to infectious diseases compared to many other types of human disease is still quite significant. Diseases that have challenged us for centuries, such as tuberculosis and cholera, still infect and kill many people each year. Although there has been a worldwide campaign to eradicate diseases such as polio, this disease remains to be eliminated from the causes of human disease. While long-standing causes of infectious diseases remain prevalent, new emerging infectious diseases add to the challenge of physicians treating patients. Agents including West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, H5N1 avian influenza virus, HIV, and human metapneumovirus have all appeared or spread widely in recent times. The threat of a pandemic, in which the disease occurs over a very large geographic area, is real, although not a guarantee, and vigilance by public health practitioners and infectious disease specialists around the world will aid in curtailing the next emerging disease. Beyond the confirmed associations of infectious agents with many diseases, there are many cases for which there are limited data to associate a specific disease with an infectious process, and thus, much ongoing research attempts to further determine these associations. More than thirty diseases have some evidence suggesting an infectious agent may be involved, but either no agent has been identified or the evidence is still preliminary. Examples include Crohn's disease, psoriasis, sarcoidosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic fatigue syndrome, and atherosclerosis.\n\nSurprising to many is the finding that microbes play a role in several malignancies that were previously thought to be \n\nAn infectious disease can present with signs and symptoms consistent with multiple noninfectious disease processes, so a positive microbiology result can be the key information to guide therapy. There are multiple dramatic cases of patients who have undergone surgery for treatment of a noninfectious disease or who were being evaluated for malignancies when, unexpectedly, the patients had treatable infectious processes. Effective communication between primary treating physicians, the infectious disease consult team, and microbiology laboratory staff helps to ensure that correct tests are being ordered, with additional stains and media added as needed to cover the differential diagnosis. Furthermore, the correct interpretation of data is required to decide optimal therapy, with test limitations conveyed from laboratory staff to the treatment team. Some typical examples of disease associations with specific bacteria are listed in Table 2 .\n\nOutbreaks involve many people each year. In 2009-10, the US public health departments reported 1527 foodborne disease outbreaks, resulting in 29 444 cases of illness, 1184 hospitalizations, and 23 deaths. The steps taken to manage a new outbreak include the detection of an outbreak strain in a patient by the clinical microbiology laboratory, followed by investigation of the source of the infection, and virulence, susceptibility, and genetic analysis in public health and research laboratories.\n\nNosocomial infections are those acquired in the healthcare system. They are very common and are often associated with the most resistant organisms, making therapy difficult. The infection control team in a healthcare facility monitors nosocomial infections and adherence to isolation guidelines, along with investigation of potential outbreaks or organism transmission within an institution. The diagnostic microbiology laboratory performs testing for surveillance and for transmission investigation. Urinary tract infections are the most common nosocomial infection, followed by surgical wound and respiratory tract infections, and then finally bloodstream infections. New hospital monitoring systems such as the National Healthcare Safety Network now require hospitals to participate in tracking of nosocomial infections. Tracking patients who are colonized with specific resistant organisms, following by implementation of isolation precautions while hospitalized, is of enormous value in protecting susceptible and vulnerable patients from additional infections that could be spread throughout the hospital by healthcare workers. Examples include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, respiratory viruses, and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative enterobacteriaceae such as Klebsiella pneumoniae that are positive for the carbapenemase enzyme, bla KPC .\n\nSome infections have become a major concern for public health agencies and to the general public. Given the spread of MRSA in recent years, some state governments in the United States have established legislation requiring specific types of monitoring in hospitals, such as in the intensive care units. Implementation of this legislation was very controversial, as many physicians felt that although important to monitor, action would be best decided by a hospital's infection control team based on data in that hospital, instead of being legislated by the regional government without the flexibility of adjusting quickly to changing needs for monitoring infections as trends change. Flexibility would permit assigning resources to the most essential areas of concern at any one time. Many countries have guidelines established by consensus committees of infectious disease organizations to control the spread of resistant organisms, even if there is no specific legislation regarding this issue.\n\nSusceptibility testing is one of the most critical functions of the microbiology laboratory. It is best to use the minimal number of drugs that will effectively treat an infection and physicians often start broad-spectrum drugs as empirical therapy until further laboratory data are available. If the broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent is not replaced with the optimal drugs, toxicity may be worse, and spread of resistance throughout the world is a very significant consequence of widespread use of antibiotics. Multiple drugs to treat bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites have been developed since the 1940s; however, microbes have evolved to counter the effectiveness of these agents in many cases. Resistance has developed and spread due to mutations in genomes or plasmids, small circular DNA strands that replicate independently of the chromosome, combined with the transfer of resistance genes from one species to another. Some strains of resistant bacteria are very common, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. Some multidrugresistant organisms are resistant to all available antimicrobial agents in our arsenal, which is devastating for the patients who get these infections.\n\nBy identifying an infectious agent as the cause of a set of symptoms, a patient may be spared further unnecessary invasive procedures to diagnose his condition. Clearly, the accurate diagnosis of the responsible infectious agent is of extreme importance to properly treat individual patients, to follow and stop the spread of disease within the population, and to increase our scientific understanding of the pathogenesis of both old and new infectious diseases. Further, staying upto-date on improvements in our diagnostic assays and advances in technology is a key part of the job of a medical microbiologist.\n\nProper specimen collection is essential for accurate diagnosis of infectious diseases. The correct specimen type must be sent in the correct transport container at the appropriate temperature, without unnecessary delay. These are important issues that are constantly monitored by hospital laboratory services. Examples of common problems include a poorly collected urine specimen that is contaminated by skin/vaginal/fecal flora, a viral culture that is not collected in viral transport medium containing antibiotics to kill bacteria so that the culture is overgrown by bacteria, or failure to collect infected wound tissue in anaerobic transport media even though anaerobes are likely pathogens in the case. Some RNA viruses are labile and culture positivity would decline with a delay in transport. Fortunately, most viral testing is now molecular-based testing, removing the requirement for viable organism for detection, so this issue is not as prevalent at this time. Collection of the appropriate amount of blood for blood cultures in potentially septic patients is critical for optimal detection of the causative microorganism. To improve testing effectiveness, accrediting organizations, such as the College of American Pathologists, have recently added requirements for ongoing monitoring and feedback to clinicians on the blood volumes collected from patients. An improperly collected specimen may result in a missed diagnosis, or alternatively, the report and subsequent treatment of a patient, for an organism that is a commensal or contaminant, along with discontinuation of testing before the true cause of infection is identified. On the appearance of new symptoms in a patient, collection of a specimen prior to antimicrobial administration is important to optimize the potential for a positive culture. This is especially true in a septic patient diagnosed using blood cultures. If the specimen volume is small and many tests are requested, the physician must prioritize the testing, as the limited volume may not be adequate for the initial requested set of assays. Most processing and plating of specimens for culture is done manually by technologists; however, automated systems have been developed to handle and plate specimens. Three examples of automated systems include Kiestra TLA (BD Kiestra B.V., Drachten, the Netherlands), Full Microbiology Laboratory Automation (FMLA; bioM\u00e9rieux, Inc., La Balme, France), and the WASPLab (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA). The high cost of such a system and the inability of the systems to handle unusual containers, small volumes, and complicated test panels result in the systems being most appropriate for large reference laboratories or high-volume laboratories.\n\nMicroscopy remains critical to microbiology workflow, with light microscopy and fluorescent microscopy being used most frequently. Direct smears of patient specimens permit detection of infection without any antecedent culture, a rapid route to a preliminary or definitive diagnosis. Bacteria are divided into Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms based on a historic stain using crystal violet and a safranin counterstain, with distinguishes based on cell wall peptidoglycan thickness and membrane lipid content ( Table 3) . The Gram stain is the most frequently used stain in the microbiology laboratory (Figures 2-5) . Mycobacteria can be detected with a Kinyoun acid-fast stain or a fluorescent stain ( Figure 6) . A calcofluor white stain or Fungi-Fluor fluorescent stain of direct specimens is frequently used to detect fungal elements. Examples of fungal stains are shown in Figures 7-13 . Multiple fluorescent stains are utilized for specific identification of viral and parasitic organisms incorporating a monoclonal antibody for specificity. Iodine preparations, acid-fast stains, and trichrome stains are useful for parasitic identifications. Examples of stains for parasites are shown in Figures 14-20 . The 100 \u00c2 oil objective of the microscope is most commonly used for bacterial microscopy, and 40 \u00c2 dry objective is often used for wet mounts and fluorescent stains. Dark field microscopy, which uses an illumination technique to enhance contrast in unstained specimens producing bright objects on a dark background, can be used to detect spirochetes and Leptospira, but is not routinely used. Phase contrast microscopy converts phase shifts in the light passing through the transparent specimen into brightness changes that are visible as cellular structures and is used for examining unstained material in wet mounts and cell cultures.\n\nIn most laboratories, identification of yeast can in many cases be accomplished with instruments that identify bacteria, but identification of mold involves microscopic analysis of slide culture, looking for hyphal elements and specialized hyphal structures, called conidiophores that produce fungal spores called conidia. This requires time and expertise. Some labs have begun to use mass spectrometry for identification of fungi, greatly reducing the time and increasing the accuracy of identification.\n\nThe burden of disease due to parasites varies tremendously based on geographic location, with a much higher burden in developing countries. Parasitology is the area of the laboratory that still uses the most traditional methods of multiple stains and direct microscopic examination. Several multiplex molecular panels have been developed that include organisms such as Giardia and Entamoeba, in addition to pathogenic bacteria\n\nStep 1 Crystal violet Gram-positive Gram-negative\n\nStep 2 Gram iodine\n\nStep 3 Decolorizer (alcohol or acetone)\n\nStep 4 Safranin red and viruses, but currently, most routine labs have not incorporated molecular methods for parasites into the daily workflow. Stool samples are examined by iodine-stained wet mount and permanent stains of fixed specimens. Motile protozoa may be seen on wet mount, and eggs and larva may be seen on permanent smear. A tremendous amount of information and definitive identification of pathogens can be made from direct examination of stool ( Figure 21 ).\n\nMicroscopy can be critical for determining appropriateness of a specimen for testing. The examination of a sputum sample for the presence of neutrophils and for relatively few squamous epithelial cells indicates an appropriate specimen for evaluation of a potential pneumonia, whereas a sample with many squamous epithelial cells indicates that it is contaminated with oral cells and flora and is thus a poor specimen. Patients who are immunocompromised may not produce neutrophils, so the criteria for appropriate specimens must be adjusted for these patients. As testing has shifted considerably to molecular methods without a microscopic examination of the specimen, the quality control measure has now been removed from many cases.\n\nCulture techniques are still essential for infectious diseases identifications, even with the huge increase in molecular testing, because pathogenic organisms that cause disease must be separated from other organisms in mixed cultures, and the prevalence of one organism compared to other organisms in the culture is useful for assessing the likelihood that an organism is contributing to disease. Molecular techniques cannot substitute for this information at this time. Enriched nonselective media that allow growth of many organisms include blood agar, chocolate agar, and thioglycollate broth ( Table 4) . Selective media promote the growth of one group of organisms while inhibiting others. Differential media permit the distinction of different organisms growing on the same media. Selective and differential media include MacConkey agar for Gramnegative bacteria, which permits the distinction of lactosefermenting organisms due to a pink color of the colonies. Specialized media will promote the growth of a specific organism while inhibiting most other organisms, such as cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin agar for Yersinia. To obtain isolated colonies for identification, the agar plates must be streaked appropriately ( Figure 22 ). To culture bacteria, the appropriate temperature and gas mixture is essential. Most bacterial are cultured at 35-37 C in 5% CO 2 . Organisms may grow in an aerobic (oxygen rich) environment or in an anaerobic (lacking oxygen) environment, or they may be microaerophilic, requiring a low concentration of oxygen, or capnophilic, requiring higher CO 2 concentrations for optimal growth. Fungal culture medium contains antibacterial compounds to inhibit bacterial growth and plates are cultured at 30 C. Mycobacteria cultures require specialized media and long incubation times, up to weeks compared with the short incubation times of < 24 h for many bacterial cultures. Examples of various colony morphologies on different types of media are shown in Figures 23-27.\n\nAutomated instruments are used to monitor blood inoculated into broth for blood cultures. The BACTEC system (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) measures the CO 2 produced by the growing organism. The fluorescent signal in the vial is increased in response to increasing CO 2 . Continuous monitoring of the signal and the presence of an alarm when a bottle is positive results in a much more rapid detection of sepsis than in days prior to such instruments. The BacT/ALERT (bioM\u00e9rieux, Durham, NC) has a sensor response to changes in CO 2 resulting in a color change detected by the instrument.\n\nViruses are either DNA or RNA, enclosed in a protein coat with or without a lipid membrane shell. Viruses require host cells for replication and many have limited survival outside the host. Traditional detection of viral infections involves culturing the viruses with mammalian cells. Viruses often display cell tropism (preferential growth) for specific cell types and produce characteristic cytopathic (cellular disruption) effects ( Figure 28 ). An adaptation of viral culture is the shell-vial culture during which the specimen is centrifuged into the cells growing on a coverslip. After 2-5 days of incubation, the coverslip is stained with a fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody specific for the virus in question. Although viral culture methods have disappeared from many routine laboratories, the viral culture techniques are essential for public health and epidemiological data collection, vaccine development, research, and response to emerging viruses. Several pathogens are difficult to culture or noncultivatable in a clinical laboratory, including Treponema, Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, many parasites, Epstein-Barr virus, norovirus, and human papillomaviruses, among others. Alternative methods, such as serology and molecular techniques, must be used to identify these infections. Some examples of virus-disease associations are listed in Figure 29 .\n\nOrganisms are identified phenotypically based on observable or detectable characteristics, such as morphology, staining properties, growth properties, nutritional requirements, antigenic properties, and resistance profiles. The colony morphology on a plate provides a lot of information for the experienced microbiologist. Some colony characteristics to consider include color, size, shape, whether a colony is convex or concave, edge uniformity, wrinkling of colonies, pitting of agar, and hemolysis on a blood plate. Colonies may be glistening and mucoid or very dry, opaque, or transparent. Examples include strong hemolysis for Streptococcus pyogenes, pitting of agar by Eikenella, and wrinkling of colonies by Pseudomonas stutzeri. Specific organisms may also have characteristic smells due to chemicals released by the organisms. Eikenella smells like bleach, Streptococci can smell like butter, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa smells like grapes.\n\nMicrobiology laboratories still perform a number of rapid biochemical reactions on bacterial isolates to narrow differential diagnosis quickly. Examples include tests for oxidase, L-pyrroglutamyl aminopeptidase, and catalase, and the S. aureus latex bead test for protein A and clumping factor. An enzyme or identifying molecule in the bacteria can be detected in minutes with the use of a substrate that provides a visible change (color change, bubbling, and agglutination) in the presence of the specific bacteria. An example is shown in Figure 30 .\n\nHistorically, analysis of metabolic activity through detection of substrate utilization involved many biochemical tubes per isolate to determine a phenotypic profile or signature of each bacterial isolate. This profile was compared to a database to match the unknown to a unique species profile. Later, commercial systems were developed to miniaturize and automate the analysis of phenotypic properties. The VITEK 2 (bioM\u00e9rieux), Phoenix (Becton Dickinson), MicroScan Walk-Away (Dade Behring), and Sensititre (TREK/Thermo Scientific) are examples of commercial systems. An automated system may include a filling unit to inoculate a bacterial solution into many wells of a cartridge, an incubator, a reader to detect changes in substrate or pH indicator following a reaction, and a computer module to make the initial interpretation of the data. One cartridge may contain about 40-45 tests for one organism. For some organisms with typical profiles, the report can be transmitted directly into the medical record for the treating physician to see without the intervention of a technologist in the laboratory. Results can be available in 2-18 h after inoculation. The software is built so that any profile that does not match well will be blocked from transmission to the physician until further investigation is completed by the laboratory, with likely additional follow-up testing.\n\nThe introduction of mass spectrometry into routine clinical microbiology laboratories has revolutionized the field. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry is a rapid and reliable identification system with low reagent costs and low labor time after initial investment in an expensive instrument and software. Isolated colonies can be placed directly onto a slide with a matrix solution that absorbed some of the energy of the laser targeted to the bacteria. The laser beam disrupts the bacteria, releasing molecules of various sizes into a vacuum tube toward a detector. Molecules travel based on size and charge, with ribosomal proteins being a predominant component of the analysis. The resulting spectrum for each unknown patient isolate is compared to the profile for many bacteria in a database and matching of data provides the identification of genus or species. An updated and comprehensive database is critical for optimal results. An identification that previously required 18 h to several days can now be completed in 10 min (Figures 31 and 32) .\n\nLateral flow immunochromatographic assays are very rapid and easy to perform ( Figure 33 ). They can be performed with minimal training and provide rapid results. The assays can identify bacterial antigens in urine, such as for S. pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. These methods detect an infection more rapidly than methods that require culture incubation time. Rapid antigen assays are also used for respiratory viruses, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. The review of literature by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shown low sensitivity of some of these tests, and although they are popular in some emergency and primary care settings, rapid immunoassays for respiratory viruses should be used with caution, if at all. A different format of immunoassay for HIV has been used widely to obtain rapid diagnosis of HIV infection in multiple clinical settings.\n\nTesting for tuberculosis is performed in BSL2 facilities with BSL3 practices. Mycobacteria have a cell wall that includes mycolic acid, giving them different staining properties. This feature is utilized in the acid-fast bacilli stains such as Kinyoun and auramine. Both solid and liquid media for mycobacteria are tailored to the nutrient requirements of these organisms and inhibit the growth of other organisms. Rapidly growing mycobacteria may be detected on routine bacterial media. Nontuberculosis mycobacteria are being reported as a cause of human disease much more now than previously. Brothbased culture systems with automated monitoring exist for mycobacteria, analogous to the blood culture systems. These dramatically improve turnaround time for growth of mycobacteria, as some species can take weeks to grow on solid media. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on direct specimens, extraction of mycobacterial isolate DNA for PCR followed by sequencing, use of molecular probes, and MALDI-TOF are all methods in use today to identify mycobacteria as alternatives to the much slower conventional biochemical tests.\n\nYeast are identified by morphological characteristics and assimilation and/or fermentation of carbohydrates. Some yeast are now identified by the multiple types of automated systems used for bacteria, with a final confirmation of identification requiring that the colony characteristics match the organism reported. To identify molds, traditionally morphological study of asexual reproductive characteristics is of key importance. Both yeast and molds can now be identified by MALDI-TOF, which is extremely rapid compared to traditional mold identification techniques.\n\nDirect fluorescent antibody (DFA) assays are used to diagnose varicella zoster virus in skin lesions or Toxoplasma gondii in respiratory specimens. A monoclonal antibody directed against a unique antigen on the organism is conjugated to a fluorescent marker that can be seen with a fluorescent microscope. For positive identification, the morphology of the organism or cells must be distinguishable from background artifactual fluorescence. PCR assays are now available and often more sensitive than DFA. The PCR assays are used instead of traditional methods or in combination when the DFA can be performed more quickly or when the information is still felt to provide evidence of the magnitude of the infection.\n\nIn situ hybridization, PCR, and sequencing\n\nThe use of molecular techniques in microbial identification has increased dramatically over the past decade and there is still a rapid rate of introduction of new and revised methods and applications. Detection of an organism's nucleic acid does not require a viable organism, which is a big advantage. Molecular methods overall tend to be very sensitive and specific. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a technique using a tagged nucleic acid probe on cultures or fixed tissue to identify the DNA of the suspected organism ( Figure 34 ). PCR is a powerful method and is used in a number of ways. PCR uses a heat-stable DNA polymerase combined with DNA oligomers (primers) of a specific sequence designed to amplify a specific target. Multiple cycles of heating denature the DNA, followed by cooling to allow specific hybridization of primers, and then extension of synthesized product by the polymerase enzyme can result in a millionfold increase in the DNA of interest. The process can be completed in several hours or shorter with new fast instruments ( Figure 35 ). Multiple adaptations of PCR include reverse-transcription PCR, which includes an initial step to convert RNA into DNA, followed by DNA amplification, or real-time PCR that permits quantification of the starting nucleic acid. The DNA product is measured in each cycle, often by a fluorescent DNA probe, and the amount of signal on each cycle is proportional to the starting material ( Figure 36 ). Real-time PCR is used for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, BK and JC polyomaviruses, herpesviruses, and quite a few more targets. The conversion of viral testing from viral culture techniques to molecular methods had a huge impact on test turnaround time. Some viral cultures previously took 14-21 days, but results can now be obtained in a few hours. Most of virology testing has moved from viral culture, shell-vial culture, rapid immunochromatographic assays, and DFA assays to realtime PCR assays. Multiplex PCR includes multiple primer sets in a single reaction with a number of ingenious ways to separate and detect the signal of the specific pathogens. Assays currently may have 16 or more targets in an individual assay. Respiratory virus detection was greatly improved by multiplex methods compared to culture, DFA assays, antigen detection, and single-target PCR assays. DNA sequencing of the gene for the 16S ribosomal subunit, a component of the cellular protein synthesis machine, is used to identify bacteria that may not be identified by phenotypic methods described earlier.\n\nSequencing ribosomal or other genes may also be used for identification of fungi, mycobacteria, and viruses.\n\nNucleic acid probes have been used to identify M. tuberculosis and some other mycobacteria for a number of years. The probe has a chemiluminescent label and the DNA probe targets the ribosomal RNA. The resulting DNA-RNA hybrid can be distinguished from a nonhybridized probe, and a stable DNA-RNA hybrid is detected by light produced by the chemical reaction. AccuProbes (Gene-Probe) are still used, but they have been replaced by sequencing or MALDI-TOF in a number of laboratories. Hybrid capture assays are used for detection of human papillomaviruses, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia, and cytomegalovirus. The method involves signal amplification of RNA probes complementary to a DNA target. A monoclonal antibody conjugated to a reporter molecule may be used to detect the RNA/DNA hybrid.\n\nAdditional nucleic acid amplification methods include the isothermal methods. For nucleic acid sequence-based amplification and transcription-mediated amplification, RNA is reverse-transcribed into cDNA, and RNA copies are synthesized with RNA polymerase. Loop-mediated amplification is another isothermal method that has been developed for a number of targets. Branched-chain DNA assays are an alternative to PCR. Short DNA sequences complementary to viral RNA are attached to a surface to capture the target. Next, a second cDNA is added attached to a branched chain of DNA. With subsequent cycles, the signal is amplified. This method is used for sensitive detection of HIV viral loads ( Figure 37 ). Standard of care for diagnosis and treatment of patients with HIV infections includes the determination of actual viral load and phenotypic/genotypic determination of likely susceptibility to anti-HIV agents. Instruments for HIV testing have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a US federal agency responsible for protecting public health, and standardized reporting of viral titer in international units provides a comparable result for a specific specimen regardless of where in the world the specimen was tested, by incorporating a global quality control into the data analysis.\n\nOne significant challenge with molecular methods is contamination of new reactions with amplified product from previous reactions. Assays have been developed to be 'closed' systems to avoid this problem and laboratories separate the working bench location of nucleic acid extraction of new patient specimens from the postamplification steps. Stringent controls are required to ensure ongoing quality assays.\n\nAn infection control team in a hospital monitors for spread of pathogenic organisms within the hospital from one patient to another. Because hospitalized individuals are battling their underlying illnesses, they are vulnerable to severe complications from a nosocomial infection. Similarly, an outbreak of an organism in the community is tracked by public health labs to determine the source of infections and to stop an outbreak if possible. Some of the systems to investigate clonality (genetic similarity) of organisms include pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), plasmid profiling, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), repetitive-element PCR, and genome sequencing. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based methods utilize the variation in DNA fragments obtained upon a specific restriction enzyme digestion of bacterial genomic DNA. PFGE involves digestion of isolates by restriction enzymes in an agarose plug, choosing an enzyme that will result in 10-20 DNA fragments. Then, the DNA is separated by a specialized electrophoresis device that uses a pulsed electric field ( Figure 38 ). The RFLPs are compared by analyzing multiple isolates on the same gel to determine similarity of the patterns. Plasmid profiling involves gel electrophoresis of plasmids after disruption of genomic DNA. The discriminating power of this method is variable. Repetitive-element PCR amplifies the region between interspersed repetitive DNA elements. The amplicons generated will vary between strains, thus allowing determination of strain similarity in an outbreak. MLST detects variations due to mutations or recombination by direct sequencing of fragments in housekeeping genes or another specific set of genes, such as virulence genes. The different MLST profiles of organisms under investigation are then compared. Whole-genome sequencing is now possible as an epidemiological tool. With the decrease in the cost of sequencing, entire genomes can be compared and singlenucleotide polymorphisms, deletions, insertions, or recombinations can be detected. Only a limited number of labs have access to whole-genome sequence techniques and the bioinformatics experts to analyze the data. Sequencing can also be used to compare viral strains that are implicated in an outbreak.\n\nSerological diagnostic techniques examine the antibody response of an individual to a specific organism. A change in antibody titers to a specific microbial antigen may allow the diagnosis of an infectious disease that would otherwise be undiagnosed due to the lack of positive cultures because of our inability to culture the organism, due to prior antimicrobial therapy, or due to a lack of alternative assays that would detect the organism. Serology is useful in these cases to establish a diagnosis and to determine if the infection is acute or chronic, a primary infection or a reinfection, by analyzing for the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgG, and the change in titer with time. Some agents for which serology is helpful include Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis viruses, HIV, human T-cell leukemia virus, rabies virus, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and arboviruses. Serological monitoring is important to track successful immunization following vaccination. Serological tests for hepatitis B, rubella, measles, varicella zoster, and mumps viruses help document vaccine efficacy.\n\nTo choose the most appropriate antimicrobial agent for treatment of a patient's infection, susceptibility testing in the laboratory can be essential. Empirical therapy that is started at the time of symptoms, before a definitive diagnosis is established or before a causative pathogen is identified, is usually very broadly active, may have unwanted side effects, and may be inactive against the true infecting agent. Furthermore, widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics contributes to the spread of organisms that are resistant to multiple antibiotics. So for multiple reasons, it is important to identify the specific antimicrobial therapy for a specific infection. Antibacterial agents work through various mechanisms including disruption of cell wall synthesis, inhibition of cell membrane function, inhibition of protein synthesis, inhibition of DNA/RNA synthesis, or inhibition of metabolic processes. Different organisms have developed various mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. The susceptibility testing must be standardized for accuracy. Methods include broth dilution, agar dilution, disk diffusion, broth microdilution, E-test gradients, and genotypic methods. Various methods are illustrated in Figures 39-43 . For each, the organism is incubated in the presence of different concentrations of the drug to determine the lowest concentration that inhibits the growth of the organism, thus determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). To determine the clinical significance of the data and to translate the MIC from the laboratory into information that the physician can use to determine if the drug will likely be effective to treat a specific patient, guidelines have been established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Some susceptibility testing methods are manual and labor-intensive. However, multiple automated instruments have been developed to test antimicrobial susceptibility in broth culture, detect the MIC, and interpret the MIC. Expert software has been written to check for unusual patterns that may indicate an error in organism identification or resistance patterns that signal a multidrug-resistant organism. A separate approach to susceptibility testing is the detection of a resistance gene with molecular methods. These methods can be much more rapid than phenotypic testing. Examples of common genotypic testing include the mecA gene used to detect MRSA and the vanA gene used to detect vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. Sophisticated phenotypic and genotypic testing of HIV is performed routinely by specialized laboratories for optimal choice of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Because host factors and the organ infected can influence the effectiveness of the chosen therapy, patient symptoms must be monitored closely and therapy adjusted if the patient is not improving on the drug to which the organism was reported to be sensitive.\n\nAll microbiological test results must be interpreted in the context of the patient. Each organism identified in a specimen may be a pathogen, a component of commensal flora, or an environmental contaminant. The underlying condition of the patient will strongly influence the interpretation of the laboratory data.\n\nPatients who are immunocompromised due to autoimmune diseases, cancer chemotherapy, HIV infection, immunomodulating therapy, or genetic disorders that result in immunocompromise are more likely have true infections from an opportunistic pathogen than an otherwise healthy, immunocompetent host. Molecular methods may detect DNA of a nonviable organism or detect a very low burden of organism that is not responsible for the symptoms of the patient. Interpretation will be affected by the age of the patient. Newborns, children, and adults have different pretest probabilities of some specific causes of infection. For example, meningitis in a newborn is more likely to be due to Escherichia coli or group B Streptococcus, whereas meningitis in an older patient may be due to Neisseria meningitidis or enterovirus. Contamination of cultures with organisms that are potential pathogens can complicate interpretation of results. If an environmental organism that has never been reported to cause human disease is isolated, it is almost certainly a contaminant. One would need to do an extensive investigation to confirm that a new organism was responsible for disease. In some cases, based on the colony location on a nutrient agar plate, it is easy to determine if an isolate is a laboratory contaminant. In other cases, it is much more difficult, so contamination must be kept to an absolute minimum with strict sterile technique when processing and working up cultures. Another important feature of interpretation may be the quantity of organism in the specimen. A small amount of a potential pathogen in a culture that is mixed with multiple other bacteria may suggest that the organism is a colonizer, whereas a heavy growth of a single organism type is more likely a pathogen. A urine culture is an example of a routine quantitative culture that is interpreted based on the mixture and quantity of organisms present. In some cases, lower respiratory tract or wound cultures may be quantitative. It is essential to know the list of normal flora for each specimen source when interpreting results. Identification of an organism from a sterile site is almost always significant, with the exception of contaminated specimens. For phenotypic methods, it is not always possible to identify an organism with absolute certainty. A lab may report a result as 'most consistent with organism X.' This occurs partly because not every organism of a specific species may give the same enzymatic result for one test. Likewise, for sequencing and MALDI-TOF results, the data may not be adequate to distinguish between several species, and several possible organisms may be reported. When a specimen is cultured in the clinical lab, results are often available in a series of steps. The direct Gram stain is known immediately, and then isolates grown from the culture may be evident in 12, 24, 48, 72 h, or longer. A culture might have several microorganisms evident on different days. The treating physician receives preliminary reports, followed by updates as they become available. The clinician, with the aid of the clinical microbiologist, must create a differential diagnosis including the list of organisms that fit the data to date and then treat the patient with antimicrobials to cover possible organisms. They must weigh the risks and benefits of narrowing therapy at any given time, balancing the negative aspect of toxicity of several broad-spectrum agents against the benefit of covering all possible likely pathogens until the culture results are finalized. The severity of illness of the patient will greatly impact these decisions.\n\nTypically, about 3-7% of positive blood cultures are due to contamination during the collection process. Several factors can be used to assess the clinical significance of the positive blood culture: (1) organism identification, because skin flora are frequent contaminants whereas other organisms are rarely contaminants;\n\n(2) more than one positive blood culture with the same organism increases the likelihood of a true positive finding of bacteremia, bacteria in the blood that may be causing disease as opposed to a false-positive result; and (3) growth of the organism in both the blood and another sterile or potentially infected site in the same patient indicates likely bacteremia and disease. Corynebacterium species, Bacillus species, and Propionibacterium species are most often contaminants. The isolation of S. aureus, E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, or Candida albicans from blood cultures is almost always clinically significant.\n\nA negative result from a microbiological culture, PCR assay, fluorescent antibody assay, or other detection method could mean that the patient does not have an infection with that organism, or that the specimen was inadequate, or that the assay is not sensitive enough. Some organisms are much harder to culture than others, or to detect by alternative methods such as antigen detection, special stains, or serological testing. In some situations, multiple assays will be used simultaneously to rule out an infection, such as cultures from multiple sites, combined with a molecular assay, combined with serological testing. Cost considerations would favor limiting testing to the most appropriate number of tests needed for a given patient. Likewise, any assay has some number of false-positive results, so all results must be considered in a clinical context. \n\nCaution must be used when interpreting quantitative molecular results, such as viral loads. Many of the tests used in clinical laboratories are not available as FDA-approved assays and the results are not standardized, although all laboratories are required to perform extensive validation of their assays.\n\nWhile HIV viral load testing is standardized, many viral assays are developed in-house by specific laboratories and are not FDA-approved. The viral loads for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and adenovirus are often followed over time in transplant patients. The comparison of viral loads over time in a single patient should be done with data from a single accredited laboratory. However, a result from one laboratory should not be compared to a result from a second laboratory to determine if the viral load has increased or decreased, unless the results are standardized between laboratories. Otherwise, the physician may mistakenly determine that the viral load has changed for better or worse when it has not.\n\nAlthough Gram stains are used daily in the laboratory and provide information rapidly, judgment is required when reporting the result. There are some limitations to the assay due to variations in organism staining characteristics. For example, Acinetobacter is a Gram-negative coccobacillus that can be mistaken for Gram-negative coccus, such as Neisseria, or Gram-positive coccus, such as Streptococcus. Anaerobic Gram-positive organisms can frequently stain as Gramnegative organisms. A single organism type may have variations in shape, appearing as a diplococcus and also as an elongated coccus that resembles a short bacillus in the same slide, leading a microbiologist to mistakenly interpret the slide as having a mixture of two organisms. The common pitfalls are known and should be communicated from the laboratory to the treating clinician when appropriate.\n\nCulture was traditionally the gold standard for detection of the microbes causing infectious diseases; however, a number of organisms are either fastidious and thus difficult to culture or uncultivatable in routine laboratories. Examples include Epstein-Barr virus, Treponema pallidum, Rickettsia, and human metapneumovirus. Advances in molecular technology have been of great value in this area, expanding the number of bacteria and viruses that we can detect. However, molecular testing does not always distinguish colonization from diseaseassociated infections, and we can design primers and probes for molecular assays only after we have sufficient unique sequence data. Serology, as discussed, also assists in the diagnosis of organisms that we cannot grow. Testing in the clinical lab is optimized for human pathogens. Environmental organisms may not grow. Bacteria, viruses, or fungi that are not known to infect humans are not included in the assay design. Emerging infectious agents may not be detected quickly for this reason.\n\nUnlike many chemistry tests that can be run immediately, directly from a blood specimen within minutes, microbiology results are often delayed due to the time required to grow an organism, isolate it from the other organisms in the culture, and determine susceptibility results. One approach to reduce turnaround time for blood cultures is the use of FISH, which uses peptide nucleic acid probes targeting specific microbe 16S rRNA after a blood culture has flagged positive. A limitation is that the FISH probes will detect only organisms that are targeted, missing organisms not targeted with the selected set of probes. Although faster than traditional bacterial identification systems that require incubation time for enzymatic or carbohydrate utilization assays to occur, there is extra work to run the FISH and then to perform further testing when required. Workflow and cost considerations prevent some labs from adopting this approach. Another rapid approach is to perform MALDI-TOF analysis directly from extracted material from a positive blood culture, without waiting for isolation of specific organisms. Of significant note, organisms will often be missed in mixed infections for a number of these rapid approaches, so a complete workup of all organisms present in a blood culture is still required. The positive outcome of these rapid approaches is that preliminary data are provided to clinicians for rapid refinement of the differential diagnosis and possible early treatment changes. Scientists continue to work on the 'Holy Grail' of complete microorganism identification directly from patient specimens without the need for culture. Currently, to detect the maximum number of organisms, a routine clinical microbiology laboratory uses a combined approach of culture, serology, antigen detection, biomarker detection, molecular methods, microscopy, and stains.\n\nThe thresholds defined for the interpretation of a specific bacterial isolate as sensitive or resistant to a specific drug, such as the susceptibility of Klebsiella to ceftazidime, are based on guidelines from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The CLSI is a consensus body created to make decisions on best available data, including pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic data, animal models, in vitro testing, computer simulations, and limited patient outcome data. When there are multiple options for therapy because an organism tests sensitive to multiple drugs, the method generally works well. But when an organism is resistant to many drugs, then the best option clinically is not always clear. Within the past several years, the guidelines provided by CLSI have changed the cutoff values for the MIC value that should be translated into sensitive, intermediate, or resistant for a number of organism/drug combinations. Because the FDA approval of microbiology equipment is independent of the CLSI process, this resulted in different labs using different cutoffs based on which FDA-approved instrument or method they used. This issue strongly highlights the fact that medicine is still both an art and a science, as a physician must incorporate all signs, symptoms, and test results to make the best therapeutic plan.\n\nDatabases to interpret biochemical reaction profiles of bacteria, DNA sequence databases, or mass spectrometry databases to interpret proteomic profiles from MALDI-TOF methods must be updated routinely, and laboratory staff must be aware of which organisms are included in the database. When a specific species is not included in the database, it cannot be selected; therefore, misidentification has resulted from this limitation in the database. Nomenclature also changes, so databases and reports must be updated accordingly.\n\nA limitation of many molecular assays involving an amplification step is the possible contamination of the work area and patient samples with amplified product. There have been many improvements to address this concern, such as closed tubes and more automated instruments that reduce the likelihood of contamination. Also, addition of deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) instead of thymidine triphosphtate (dTTP) to the reaction mix, combined with the use of uracil DNA glycosylase prior to each amplification step, has been beneficial in eliminating contaminating amplicons from previous amplifications. Finally, awareness of the issue and inclusion of negative controls is essential to keep this problem to a minimum.\n\nCost A significant concern in most hospitals is the cost of patient care, a component of which is the cost of laboratory testing. As our technology advances in the microbiology laboratory and we are able to test for more microbes, the cost is often much higher than traditional method costs. It is now more common to create a panel of pathogens that are tested by a molecular method at one time instead of culture and assays that focus on each potential pathogen individually, based on likelihood of the presence of that pathogen. The panels may include common pathogens along with less common pathogens and the test cannot be adapted to test only a subset of targets. This creates a challenge for the ordering clinician and the microbiology director to provide the best care for each individual patient without losing sight of the budget limitations for the facility overall. It is hoped that continued research and advances in technology will result in new ways to reduce the cost of these new comprehensive assays without compromising quality and spectrum of targets.\n\nNucleic acid testing will continue to become even more extensively utilized. Academic, reference, and research laboratories continually develop assays for the detection of microbes not currently available in commercially marketed products. There will likely be an increase in availability and use of international standards so that results can be reported in comparable international units, as implementation of such units for a number of viral assays has lagged behind their use in other areas, such as for coumadin levels and HIV viral loads. Whole-genome sequence analysis has now been used during investigations of several outbreaks to rapidly and precisely define the chain of transmission of an outbreak organism. Furthermore, the lineage of the organism can be identified, and the mechanism of increased virulence compared to similar nonoutbreak strains can be determined. The power of this technique is identifying the entire nucleotide sequence of the organism, which includes orders of magnitude more data than was provided by older methods of epidemiological analysis such as PFGE. For organisms that present very different patterns of bands from a PFGE analysis, the genome analysis is not necessary; however, when a single largely clonal strain is present nationally or globally, the discriminatory power of detecting subtle changes by genome analysis may be desired to detect the spread of a hospital strain within a specific setting from patient to patient. Most routine labs do not yet have the equipment or bioinformatics expertise for this approach and usually do not need this approach for routine work outside of outbreak investigations. However, in the not-too-distant future, many hospital infection control practitioners may find this approach feasible and useful, perhaps in conjunction with online bioinformatics expertise.\n\nAn example of the power of current technologies is illustrated by the 2011 European outbreak of E. coli in sprouts. The infections resulted in a high percentage of patients developing hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can result in kidney failure and death. Multiple research teams sequenced the genome of the new strain very rapidly. This allowed tracking of the outbreak and determination of the changes in the genetic components of this organism that were responsible for the increased virulence.\n\nDevelopment of methods for detection of microorganisms directly in patient specimens without the need for culture is one goal for improving rapid diagnostics. A diagnostic instrument, T2MR (T2 Biosystems) currently under evaluation, utilizes a multistep approach of PCR for specific fungi, followed by hybridization of the amplified DNA to nanoparticles attached to capture probes. Hybridization yields microclusters detectable by T2 magnetic resonance. Initial reports indicated the method can detect yeast bloodstream infections with only one colony-forming unit per milliliter with a time of 3 h from collection to detection. The technology has the potential to greatly improve patient care through more rapid diagnosis of yeast bloodstream infections and possibly other infections, as the technology is adapted.\n\nThe introduction of mass spectrometry into the clinical microbiology laboratory is a revolutionary change in the way diagnostic microbiology is practiced. For many years, the phenotypic appearance of the organism on a selective or differential agar plate, along with biochemical assays to detect carbohydrate utilization and enzymes within the organism defined the methods of identification. As more laboratories adopt the newer methods, the phenotypic and biochemical data become much less important. Mass spectrometry methods are being utilized in more routine clinical laboratories and can now be used for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Investigators are currently exploring methods to use mass spectrometry for strain typing and susceptibility testing, but there is more work to be done in this area, which has not yet been shown to have enough discriminatory power for use in patient care. PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is another technology that has large potential for the future of microbiological diagnostics. This is a method capable of identifying nearly all human pathogens of different types without requiring the establishment of a predesigned panel of candidate microbes for testing. This is a unique feature because most assays test for the presence of specific organisms. The method combines a PCR step with a mass spectrometry time-of-flight analyzer to identify the nucleic acid base composition of the PCR products produced in a multiplex PCR reaction. Resulting nucleotide sequence must be analyzed against a reference database of genomic sequences to identify the organisms present. This technology is primarily used for research, food testing, public health surveillance, or biopharmaceutical testing at this time and has not yet been adopted into the routine clinical microbiology laboratory. There is powerful potential in this technology, but it is not yet clear if the practical issues of cost, workflow, and technical expertise of the routine laboratory will inhibit the adoption of this methodology in many laboratories.\n\nA group of scientists with expertise in genomic analysis of microorganisms has created a collaborative effort to create a Global Microbial Identifier, described on their website: http:// www.globalmicrobialidentifier.org. The objective of this collaboration is to create a global system to aggregate, share, mine, and translate genomic data for microorganisms in real time, enabling a direct link from end users in academia, industry, and government (e.g., clinicians, veterinarians, epidemiologist, and microbiologists) to main databases through user-friendly platforms. This system may include a reference database that could be accessed both for single clinical tasks (simple microbiological identification) and for national and international public health surveillance and outbreak investigation and response. If the vision of this group is fulfilled, the speed and simplicity of analyzing genomic data and of putting new findings into the appropriate global context will improve dramatically.\n\nGiven the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of medical microbiology, there is no doubt that new pathogens will be identified over the next 5 years, and our understanding of currently known microbes, along with their associated diseases and therapies, will also change dramatically within that time frame. It is an exciting field and one that requires constant vigilance. Emerging infectious diseases assure us that there will be an ongoing need for professionals who can develop new diagnostic tests for newly identified pathogens and implement routine testing of patients. The ease of international travel by huge numbers of people easily converts what might have been a local or regional infectious disease outbreak to a global one. The CDC list about 50 emerging infectious diseases is monitored and studied in order to understand their pathogenesis, detect them as they emerge in new locations, offer guidance to practitioners who recognize the symptoms, and contain them when possible. A few examples of diseases that have emerged in recent times are included here to illustrate the importance of following these fascinating human diseases.\n\nVariant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy caused by a transmissible proteinaceous particle called a prion, first recognized in the 1990s. The disease in humans is believed to be due to exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy transmitted to humans from cattle. The disease is quite rare, but frightening, as there is no current cure available and the idea of a pathogenic transmissible protein that is not viral or bacterial or similar to any previously known microbes has led to much controversy over many years and much excellent research into disease mechanisms.\n\nExtensively drug-resistant tuberculosis is a form of tuberculosis caused by mycobacteria that are resistant to some of the most effective antituberculosis drugs. Treatment is quite prolonged and can result in considerable side effects from the second-and third-line drugs used to treat the disease. This disease is associated with a much higher mortality rate than other forms of tuberculosis.\n\nAdvanced immunodeficiency syndrome due to HIV was first clinically observed in 1981 in the United States. Scientific study has now shown that HIV entered the human population at a much earlier date and is thought to have jumped the species barrier on several independent occasions, giving rise to three groups of the virus. Over the past several decades, many millions of people have died in the global epidemic of HIV; however, amazing advances in directed antiviral drugs and in diagnostic platforms have permitted many millions to live for years with the disease. SARS, caused by a coronavirus, spreads to more than two dozen countries, infecting about 8000 people, before the global outbreak of 2003 was contained. Mortality from the disease was $10%. Middle East respiratory syndrome is a more recent viral respiratory illness due to a related coronavirus, with initial mortality above 50%. Investigators are working to better understand the risks of this virus, including the source, how it spreads, and how infections might be prevented.\n\nInfluenza viruses adapt rapidly, and every year, scientists design a new influenza vaccine to combat the next wave of viruses. Avian influenza viruses have evolved the ability to infect humans on a number of occasions. Avian influenza A H5N1 virus has been detected for a number of years, and H7N9 virus is one of the most recently reported. Exposure to infected poultry is associated with spread to human populations. Again, avian viruses tend to cause severe disease and high mortality. Vigilant monitoring to detect adaption of one of these viruses to a strain that can be transmitted easily between humans, increasing the likelihood of a pandemic, is a high priority for public health agencies. K. pneumoniae that produce an enzyme known as a carbapenemase are responsible for the spread of drug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections to many countries in the world. In some cases, the organisms are resistant to all available drugs for Gram-negative organisms, and again, high mortality is seen in infected patients with comorbidities. Strong infection control measures are essential because the organism can be spread by contact with the environment on incompletely washed hands of healthcare workers ( Figure 44 )."}
