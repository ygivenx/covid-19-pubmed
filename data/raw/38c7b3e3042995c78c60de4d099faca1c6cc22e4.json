Viruses need to be purified for many studies in which properties or structure of the virus must be distinguished from those of the host cells or culture medium, such as analyses of structure of viral polypeptides, function of membrane glycoproteins, etc.\n\nIn this review, we will describe proven methods of purifying enveloped versus nonenveloped viruses, and labile versus stable viruses, as these properties constitute important differences in the methods. We will also discuss those criteria used by various laboratories for determining the degree of purity achieved in virus preparations.\n\nUltracentrifugation is the usual technique of choice for the purification of particles of defined size (i.e. virions) from their contaminating materials. In any suspension of particles their rate of sedimentation depends not only on the size, density and morphology of the particles but also on the nature of the medium in which they are suspended and the force applied to the particles during centrifugation.\n\nOne important contributory factor to consider in the separation and ultimate purification of virions from contaminating materials is therefore the viscosity of the medium in which they are centrifuged and this chapter addresses such an issue later.\n\nIt is of course theoretically possible to separate particles solely on the basis of differential pelleting, where asymmetrical particles will sediment slower than spherical particles of the same mass and density. By increasing the time of centrifugation or the centrifugation speed smaller particles will also pellet. Differential centrifugation also separates particles on the basis of their density. Whilst the procedure can be successful in achieving good separation of a variety of particles as long as there are large differences in their mass and/or densities, the yield of such a procedure is likely to be low and the purity of the particles questionable. The technique is however often used as a starting point designed so as to enrich populations of particles before further purification. Virus purification is more likely to be achieved by the technique of density gradient centrifugation, where separation of the components is achieved by sedimentation through a density gradient, (i.e. a solution which increases in density with increasing distance down the centrifuge tube).\n\nTwo types of approach are routinely usedrate-zonal centrifugation and isopycnic centrifugation.\n\nIn rate-zonal centrifugation the problem of co-sedimentation of particles is overcome by layering the sample in the form of a narrow layer on top of a density gradient. During centrifugation the sample particles separate as a series of bands or zones, each with its own characteristic sedimentation rate. Centrifugation is stopped before the particles pellet and the separated components are collected by fractionation of the gradient. The rate at which the particles sediment depends on their size, shape, density, the centrifugal force, and the density and viscosity profile of the gradient.\n\nIsopycnic centrifugation separates particles solely on the basis of their different densities. The sample is loaded directly on to a preformed density gradient and then centrifuged or is mixed with the gradierft medium to give a solution of uniform density and the density gradient forms during centrifugation (e.g. Dea and Tijssen 1988) .\n\nIn rate-zonal centrifugation the density of the gradient must not exceed that of the particles being separated whereas in isopycnic centrifugation the maximum density must always exceed the density of the particles.\n\nThe above procedures are carried out in preparative ultracentrifuges which are usually grouped on the basis of their speed. Routinely one would wish for a machine capable of 40-80 x 103 rpm and 600 x 103 g. Centrifuge rotors come in various sizes but would routinely be swing-out rotors for ratezonal centrifugation and fixed angle or vertical rotors for isopycnic centrifugation.\n\nConcentration of viral suspensions by precipitation techniques is a useful starting point for virus purification.\n\nPrecipitation of macromolecular proteins such as viruses by high molecular weight polyethylene glycol-6000 (PEG), pioneered by Yamamoto et al (1970) for bacteriophages, is an effective concentration method because the viruses are slowly precipitated in a cold, high-salt environment which protects them from chemical and physical denaturation.\n\nPEG precipitation is more gentle than physical concentration by ultracentrifugation or molecular sieve filtration. These are also done in the cold, but ulltracentrifugation often packs the virions so tightly, even atop sucrose cushions, that they cannot be resuspended without significant loss of virus, and ultrafiltration requires magnetic mixing to keep the filter cleared and loses a great deal of virus trapped in the filter itself. PEG is also more effective, in our hands, than ammonium sulfate precipitation, although the latter has been used with good results for astroviruses, caliciviruses, coronaviruses, picornaviruses and many others (Ashley and Caul 1982; Tannock 1973; Wadey and Westaway 1981; Minor 1985) . The PEG precipitation procedure outlined below has been performed with good results for coronaviruses (Hierholzer 1976; Lanser and Howard 1980) , rhabdoviruses (Obijeski et al 1974) , parainfluenzaviruses (Hierholzer et al 1993) , respiratory syncytial virus (Anderson et al 1984; Cash et al 1977; Hierholzer et al 1994) , rubella virus (Fuccillo and Sever 1989) , and picornaviruses (Hasegawa and Inouye 1983; Hierholzer et al 1984 \n\nSucrose is suitable for most rate-zonal centrifugation procedures and is often the ideal method for the formation of sharp, easily isolated bands of pure virus. Sucrose is however very viscous at densities greater than 30% w/v and some laboratories use Ficoll or Dextran (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals) as an alternative. The procedures for gradient formation are, however, the same. The gradient solution is usually made up in an aqueous buffer at neutral pH; borate buffer should never be used. The gradients are usually of the continuous type, i.e. the density of the sucrose solution increases smoothly with increasing distance from the axis of rotation. In designing gradients it is essential that the top of the gradient is of sufficient density to support the virus sample whereas the density at the bottom must exceed that of the virus particles.\n\nStep gradients (e.g. 5-30%, 10-40% or 15-45%) should be used whenever possible as they result in better separation of virus particles from contaminating materials. Gradients should also never be overloaded with sample, and whilst this procedure is of course a 'learning curve' for different viruses Hull (1985) suggests that SW27 (large swing out rotors) should never be loaded with more than 5 mg virus whereas the smaller tube (SW50) should contain 1 mg of virus or less.\n\nGradients are either produced by the diffusion method, where a series of differing sucrose concentrations are layered one on top of the other and allowed to diffuse, or by the use of gradient makers, which range from home-made devices put together by the local glass-blower to sophisticated commercially acquired apparatus.\n\nThe diffusion method relies on the aliquoting, by underlaying or overlaying, of identical volumes of a series of sucrose solutions to produce a step gradient. Once prepared the tube is stood either vertically or horizontally and the sucrose allowed to diffuse to form the gradient. If left vertically the tubes should be allowed to stand overnight at 4~\n\nTypical volume examples for preparation of a variety of different sized gradients are shown below (reproduced from Hull, 1985) .\n\nGradients made by means of a gradient maker can be used immediately. The gradient maker consists of two vessels of equal crosssectional area joined by a connecting channel which is opened or closed by means of a stopcock. The outlet or mixing chamber has a fine tube exit which, via a piece of flexible tubing, leads to the centrifuge tube. Vessels are constructed for various volume gradients. Whilst sucrose will flow by gravity many workers prefer to use a peristaltic pump between the glass exit tube and the centrifuge tube (see Fig. 4 .1)\n\nThe methods for gradient preparation are well documented by Hames (1984) but a brief description of the 'dense end first' method is given here. pure virus. Such a band can often be observed by shining a beam of light up through the bottom of the clear centrifuge tube, this being carried out in a darkened room. For some purposes the band can be harvested by puncturing the tube with a hypodermic syringe and withdrawing the band, the sample being pelleted later by ultracentrifugation. It is however often necessary to collect appropriately volumed fractions from sucrose gradients. For this purpose, again, commercial apparatus is available, but great success is achieved easily by the construction of a home-made apparatus. The authors have used the three designs discussed by Minor (1985) but prefer the apparatus referred to as 'c' in his article. This is briefly discussed below (see Fig. 4 \n\n2. Connect the vessel outlet tubing to the top of the centrifuge tube. The tubing may be held in place but as long as care is taken can often be left 'lodged' against the inner side of the top of the centrifuge tube. 3. Ensure stop-cock between chambers is closed and introduce required volume of less dense solution into the reservoir chamber. Add appropriate volume of the more dense solution to the mixing chamber. 4. Stir the solution in the mixing chamber using a helix stainless steel wire (or similar device) driven by an overhead motor. 5. Set a peristaltic pump to give a steady flow rate and open connecting stopcock (watch out for trapped air). The solution flowing into the centrifuge tube becomes progressively more dilute, thus establishing a gradient. 6. The gradient is stored at the required temperature but should normally be used within an hour.\n\nA gradient preformed in such a way is ready for use in rate-zonal centrifugation, hopefully leading to the formation of a visible band of The apparatus consists of a rubber bung, a bleed tube of steel tubing attached to a short piece of silicone rubber tubing (i), and a glass inlet tube attached to a repeating syringe adjustable to deliver Such a method is capable of giving good separation of 'bands', of e.g. empty and full capsids, etc. Sucrose density gradient rate-zonal centrifugation has been used for the purification of a whole range of viruses, e.g. influenza virus (Barrett and inglis 1985) , adenovirus (Precious and Russell 1985) , coronavirus (Collins and Alexander 1980) , parainfluenzavirus (Ito et al 1987) , rotavirus (McCrae 1985) , rhabdovirus (Wunner 1985) , togavirus (Gould and Clegg 1985) , picornavirus (Minor 1985) , and herpes viruses (Killington and Powell 1985) .\n\nSpecific purification methods for a small capsid virus (e.g. picornavirus) and a large enveloped virus (e.g. a herpes virus) are detailed below. (Minor 1985) Preparations of virus for purification are usually derived following high m.o.i, of appropriate cell cultures (e.g. HeLa suspension cultures) which are freeze-thawed two or three times and then centrifuged to remove the debris. The supernatant is often treated with either ammonium sulphate or polythene glycol prior to purification. Picornaviruses are however often associated with membranes and thus detergent is usually added (e.g. 1% NP40) to free the virus particles. The purification process is as follows: Virus purified in such a way is suitable for most purposes. However some impurities may remain and if extreme purity is required it may be necessary to re-purify on caesium chloride gradients. (Killington and Powell 1985) Herpes simplex virus provides a more difficult challenge than most viruses with regard to the preparation of pure virus particles. Techniques which work well with one virus strain in a particular cell line do not work for other strains of virus in the same cells or for the same strain of virus in different cells. For this reason we give two methods here. Method 1 relies on the virus strain being released into the extracellular medium of e.g. Hep-2 infected cells. Method 2 appears to work for most strains.\n\npreparations of virus a wide variety of other techniques can be used, including a second sucrose gradient or caesium chloride gradients. Both these techniques yield virus with a protein/particle ratio better than 20 ~tg/101~ particles.\n\nMethod 1 (Powell and Watson 1975) Heine et al 1972; Killington et al 1977) 1. Infect the cells exactly as described for method 1. 2. Incubate the cells at 37~ for 18-24 h and harvest by scraping from the glass and low-speed centrifugation. 3. Resuspend the cell pellet so obtained in Reticulocyte Standard Buffer (RSB) and allow the cells to swell for 10 min. The cytoplasm may then be obtained from the cells by Dounce homogenization. 4. Centrifuge the Dounce-homogenized cells at low speed to remove nuclei and cell debris. 5. Layer the supernatant (containing the majority of the infectious virus) on to a 5-40% Dextran gradient in Tris buffer and centrifuge at 12,500 rpm for 1 h (Sorvall AH 627 rotor); the virus is obtained by removing the visible band in the centre of the gradient. 6. Collect the virus from this band by sedimentation (20,000 rpm for 1 h, Sorvall AH 627 rotor).\n\nAt this point the virus is of adequate purity for many purposes but can easily be improved by the methods mentioned above. Purified virus derived by either method may be resuspended in distilled water or a suitable buffer and aliquots taken for infectivity assay, total particle count and protein estimation. Virus can be frozen at -70~ but on thawing this leads to partial disintegraton of the viral envelope.\n\nC h a p t e r 4 C a e s i u m c h l o r i d e g r a d i e n t s\n\nCaesium chloride (CsCI)is one of the materials of choice used for the purification of viruses by a technique referred to as buoyant densitygradient sedimentation, isopycnic centrifugation or equilibrium density gradient centrifugation. This method is based on the premise that the layering of a virus suspension on to a preformed gradient followed by ultracentrifugation will result in the migration of virus particles until they reach an equilibrium according to their buoyant density. Alternatively, the gradient may be field formed by mixing the virus suspension with a known amount of CsCI in a suitable buffer prior to centrifugation when the gradient is produced. This technique contrasts with the procedure of rate-zonal centrifugation which separates particles on the basis of size. Other materials used in isopycnic centrifugation include organic molecules such as sugars (sucrose) or polysaccharides (Ficoll), iodinated aromatic compounds (Nycodenz) or colloidal silica (Percoll). Hence no one particular compound is of universal application. More far reaching applications of CsCI gradients include the purification of plasmid DNA and the separation of subviral components.\n\nThe widespread use of CsCI is attributed to -3 the fact that solutions of up to 1.91 g cm can be prepared from it which is highly desirable for the purification of viruses whose buoy--3 ant densities range from 1.28-1.45 g cm (non-enveloped) to 1.18-1.25 g cm-3 (enveloped). Suggestions for the concentrations of CsCI to be used for gradient formation range from 1.32 g cm -3 (32% w/v) for a virus containing 5% RNA to 1.7 g cm -3 (55.5%) w/v for a DNA virus. In addition to its high level of solubility and density, CsCI is able to form solutions of low ionic strength and viscosity. Also, at a suitable pH its presence does not affect the biological activities of the virus. Optical grade CsCI does not absorb UV light allowing direct photometric analysis of gradient fractions. Further it does not interfere with the activity of scintil-lation fluids, thereby allowing analysis of radioactively labeled virus preparations taken from the gradient. CsCI can easily be removed from the virus fraction by dialysis, filtration or ultracentrifugation. CsCI gradients may either be self formed or preformed and the latter type of gradient may either be discontinuous or continuous. For the discontinuous gradient, often referred to as a step gradient, different densities of CsCI are layered into a centrifuge tube, beginning either by underlaying the least dense with a more dense preparation or by layering the less dense preparation on the top of the more dense. The virus sample is loaded on to the top of the gradient and centrifugation begun immediately. The continuous gradient is prepared in the same manner but additionally it is held at 4~ overnight, allowing diffusion to occur. More often however, a gradient maker is used to form the continuous gradient thus saving time. For the self-forming gradient, the virus sample, the gradient solute and the buffer are mixed together in proportions that will generate a suitable density range on centrifugation.\n\nSwing out, fixed angle and vertical rotors can all be used for the purpose of CsCI centrifugation. if limited time is available, the various fractions of the gradient are collected and their densities can be measured in an Abbe refractometer. Alternatively, known volumes of liquid may be weighed using a pycnometer. Some methods for virus purification using CsCI gradient centrifugation are given below. (Minor 1985) 1. Prepare a 40% w/w solution of CsCI by dissolving 4 g of solid CsCI in 6 ml of 0.01 M Tris-HCI pH 7.4.\n\n2. Prepare a 5% w/w solution of CsCI by dissolving 0.5 g of solid CsCI in 9.5 ml of 0.01 M Tris-HCI pH 7.4. 3. Pour a 10 ml 5-40% linear CsCI gradient in an ultracentrifuge tube of 12 ml capacity (e.g. Beckman SW41 tube) using 5 ml of each solution and a suitable gradient maker. 4. Layer the sample containing 1% NP-40 on to the gradient in a volume of 1 ml. Balance centrifuge tubes using liquid paraffin. 5. Centrifuge at 120,000 g for at least 4 h and preferably overnight at 4~ in, for example, a Beckman L8 ultracentrifuge, SW41 head at 30,000 rpm. 6. Harvest the gradients.\n\nFollowing the treatment of tissue samples to extract a virus of interest, CsCI gradient centrifugation can then be used for its purification. One such example of this was an examination of the structure of fish lymphocystis disease virus from skin tumours of pleuronectes following their purification on CsCI gradients (Samalecos 1986 ).\n\nforming CsCI gradient (Hull, 1985) 1. Precipitate a suspension of virus extracted from infected leaves with polyethylene glycol 6000 (10% in 0.1 M NaCI and centrifuge at 10,000 g for 10 min, resuspend in 1/10 the volume of 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0 and centrifuge at 10,000 g for 10 min to recover the supernatant. 2. Add CsCI to give a density of 1.36 g c m -3 and centrifuge at 36,000 rpm for 18 h in a Beckman R40 rotor. 3. Recover the virus band from the gradient and dialyse against at least 100 volumes of 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0 for 3-4 h to remove the CsCI. 4. Repeat steps 1 and 2 and resuspend the final product in 1 ml of sodium acetate pH 5.0 per 100 g of starting leaf material. Finally, CsCI centrifugation has been used for the separation on the basis of buoyant density of viruses isolated from faecal material whose description had previously been limited to that of 'small round viruses'. These were then further examined by electron microscopy and could be classified in more detail (Oliver and Phillips 1988 densities between 1.2 and 1.5 g cm were placed on agar coated slides and allowed to dry. Samples were stained and examined by electron microscopy. By carrying out this retrospective study, small round viruses found in faecal samples were classified into groups such as astrovirus, 'Norwalk-like' virus, parvovirus, enterovirus and hepatitis A.\n\nCsCI density gradient centrifugation was used for the production of purified preparations of rotavirus antigens for use in T-cell proliferation assays (Bruce et al 1994) . Virus was pelleted from 400 ml of clarified (5000 g for 30 min) cell culture lysates and resuspended in 3 ml of 20 mM-Tris-HCI pH 7.5 buffer containing 5 mM calcium chloride. The virus was purified further by differential centrifugation on a fivestep caesium chloride gradient. Double and single-shelled rotavirus particles were harvested from the gradient, pooled and washed by ultracentrifugation. The virus purified thus was then used in T-cell proliferation assays.\n\nThe purification of subviral components using CsCI gradient centrifugation CsCI gradient centrifugation is effective in the production of purified subviral components from either biological fluids or from systems which over-express the protein. Three examples of this are given below.\n\n1. HBsAg was purified from the plasma of high-titre chronic carriers of HBsAg Virus purification (Gavilanes et al 1990) . Following treatment with octyl glucoside the suspension was layered onto a 12.8 ml CsCI linear gradient (density 1.15-1.32 g c m -3 ) . The CsCI had been previously filtered through GSWPO4750 Millipore filters before use.\n\n2. Gradients were centrifuged for 4 h at 154,400 g in a Beckman SW40 rotor. 3. Fractions of 0.4 ml were collected beginning from the bottom of the gradient and their absorbance at 280 nm measured. Antigen-positive fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mM-Tris (pH 7.0)/50 mM NaCI.\n\nHepatitis B core antigen is composed of an envelope carrying the surface antigen and an internal capsid containing the circular, partially dsDNA genome and the viral polymerase. Empty cores have been produced in baculo-virus and one cycle of CsCI gradient centrifugation was used for their purification. Three species were found in sedimentation velocity studies of a 3 mg m1-1 solution. These had migrations of 71.3S, 62.5S and 11.0S respectively (Hilditch et al 1990) . Hepatitis delta virus antigen was expressed in a eukaryotic cell line (Macnaughton et al 1990) and the density of the antigen was found to be 1.19 g c m -3 by equilibrium centrifugation in caesium chloride. The procedure was as follows:\n\n1. A 200 ~1 sample of ammonium sulphate precipitated recHDAg was overlaid on a 10 mi gradient of preformed caesium chloride (1.1-1.5 g c m -3 and centrifuged (120,000 g) for 25 h at 20~ and 0.5 ml fractions collected). 2. Fractions were tested for HDAg activity by RIA and its density was estimated from the refractive index.\n\nPositive density/negative viscosity gradients were first proposed by Barzilai et al (1972) as a means of effectively separating viruses from cytoplasmic components with similar densities. His studies used CsCI to provide density and glycerol for viscosity, and the gradients were employed to purify foot-and-mouth disease virus, a picornavirus, from the host cell milieu in which it was grown. The method described here is patterned after Obijeski et al (1974) , who found that potassium tartrate provided a gentler chemical environment than caesium or rubidium salts for enveloped viruses.\n\nThe gradients are constructed such that the potassium tartrate yields increasing density from the top of the gradient to the bottom, while the glycerol yields decreasing viscosity from the top to the bottom; thus the designation 'positive density/negative viscosity'. The method is gentle and does not destroy labile viruses either by pelleting them or by a harsh chemical milieu, it has been found particularly useful for purifying enveloped viruses such as rhabdoviruses (Obijeski et al 1974) , coronaviruses (Hierholzer 1976) , parainfluenza and mumps viruses (Hierholzer et al 1993) , and respiratory syncytial virus (Hierholzer et al 1994) , and non-enveloped but nonstable viruses such as caliciviruses and astroviruses (Ashley and Caul 1982) . In the 30% (v/v) glycerol-to-40% (v/v) potassium tartrate gradients used for enveloped viruses, the top of the gradient after centrifugation contains a band of flocculent material with a refractive index of--1.356; followed by a faint, hazy band (--1.377); a sharp, compact virus band (--1.379); another faint, hazy band just below the virus (--1.380); and two very flocculent bands near the bottom of the tube (RI 1.381 and 1.385, respectively). The RI values correspond to a range of 15-32 % sucrose. For nonenveloped viruses, the gradient is constructed with 30% glycerol and 60% tartrate to provide the greater density needed for these viruses (Ashley and Caul 1982) .\n\n1. Construct gradients in cellulose nitrate centrifuge tubes holding at least 10 ml.\n\nThe directions here will be for the Beckman SW41 tubes, which hold 12.5 ml to the top, and allow for 10 ml of gradient and 2.5 mt of previouslyconcentrated virus. The tubes should be situated vertically, as with all gradients. 2. To make three identical gradients, place 16 ml of 40% di-potassium tartrate in TES buffer, pH 7.2 (see page 176), in the right-hand cylinder to prevent an air trap, and then lead it into the three lines of tubing leading to the pump and centrifuge tubes. This provides a small cushion of 40% tartrate (highest density) which will prevent viruses with densities around 1.18 g c m -3 from passing through. 3. Commence stirring in the right-hand cylinder, either with a stainless steel agitator rod or a magnetic mixing bar. Adjust the stirrer so that excessive air bubbles are not formed and forced into the tubing going to the pump and centrifuge tubes. Excessive bubbles can create air traps and also disrupt the linearity of the gradients. Gel filtration, also referred to as size exclusion liquid chromatography (SEC), gel chromatography or gel permeation chromatography has proven to be one of a number of methods of choice for the purification of viruses and is extensively used in the purification of subviral components including antigens and virally encoded enzymes often expressed in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems. SEC is used in the separation of simple mixtures conveniently and rapidly when the components of the mixture have a sufficient difference in size. The technique uses a solid phase composed of a column packing of beads with pores of a defined average size. The beads have a specific size exclusion so that the separation of solute entering the column is dependent on its ability to enter the pores. The smaller components are able to enter the pores and are retained in the column and are eluted first. Solutes of intermediate size are less able to approach the walls of the pores and spend less time in the pores. These move through the column at speeds dependent on their relative size. Thus separation in SEC is strictly on the basis of molecular size. The retention of solutes by adsorption is undesirable and usually does not occur with the correct combination of substrate and mobile phase. A differential elution, proportional to the particle size (and consequently to the particle molecular weight) can be obtained. The beads are composed of various materials. The ideal surface must be neutral and hydrophilic to minimize the possibility of adsorption. Highly cross-linked, mechanically stable, macroporous matrices from neutral, hydrophilic polymers such as dextrans or agarose have been used for such purposes. The commercially available Sepharose CL (Pharmacia) is a beaded agarose matrix which has been cross-linked. However, cross-linking agents introduce hydrophobic character into the matrix. Pore diameter and pore volume can also be reduced during cross-linking.\n\nSepharose gel filtration media give a broad range of fractionation (10,000-40,000,000 Mr) and have a high exclusion limit for the separation of biomolecules. The particle size is from 45-200 t~m. The beaded agarose matrix shows low non-specific binding and the cross-linked forms have good chemical and physical stability. Sepharose is available with three different agarose contents: 2%, 4% and 6%. Increasing the agarose concentration decreases matrix porosity thus altering the fractionation range while increasing the rigidity.\n\nOperating instructions and gel selection depend on the application and the desired resolution. The technique can be broadly separated into two categories, desalting or group separation and fractionation. For desalting, the molecule of interest is eluted in the void volume whilst smaller molecules are retained. Thus the exclusion size should be smaller than the molecule of interest. For fractionation, molecules of varying molecular weight are separated within the gel matrix and thus the molecules of interest should fall within the separation range of the gel. Gel filtration is a non-interactive technique which means that the conditions can be chosen to maintain the stability of the molecules being separated. This is a valuable means of separating unknown samples but, more pertinent here, can also be used for the purification of viruses such as poliovirus or rabies virus (van Wezel et al 1979) . Filtration on Sephacryl $300 has also been used for the purification of influenza neuraminidase fragments.\n\nThe more efficient method of high performance SEC (HPSEC) is now frequently used where the system is closed and operated at high pressures. Thus separations take 10-20 min compared to hours. High pressure, rapid flow rates and sophisticated equipment are characteristic of this procedure. However, small more rigid porous particles will be used for column packing as opposed to the ones used for SEC which would collapse at high species (tetramer). Gel filtration was then used to purify this further. To do this, protein from one-litre batches of supernatant was precipitated with 85% ammonium sulphate, resuspended in 30 ml of water and dialyzed for 24 h against 3 changes of PBS. Six-millilitre aliquots (0.5 mg gp160) were separated by gel-filtration chromatography using a Sephacryl S-400HR column (90 x 2.5 cm). Threemillilitre fractions were collected and each screened for gp 160 by ELISA. Fractions containing gp160 were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration centrifugation through a Centricon filter with a 10 K size exclusion. Protein was stored at -20~ in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6.\n\nFor further applications of gel filtration techniques for the purification of viral proteins see HSV-1 UL8 protein (Parry et al 1993) , Epstein-Barr virus Nuclear Protein 2A (Tsui and Schubach 1994) , HTLVl recombinant protease (Daenke et al 1994) , HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (Sharma et al 1994) , HIV-2 Nef Protein (Du Bois et al 1993) .\n\nWhen designing a purification protocol it is uninfected cells can be reacted with virus essential to apply stringent tests to ensure preparation. that the virus particles produced are pure.\n\nAnother method designed to detect free Once the protocol has been tried and tested antigen contaminants in the purified virus is the purity of each batch of virus should be non-SDS electrophoresis, where pure virus assessed by at least one criterion, should yield no detectable stained bands Protein/particle ratios are good indications moving into the gel. of purity. Estimations of particle weight and Comparison of radioactively labeled polypercent protein allows the calculation of a target protein/particle ratio, e.g. for herpes simplex approximately 13.5 ~g/10 l~ particles. Whilst such figures are not totally accurate peptide profiles with stained profiles on SDS polyacrylamide gels can also be a useful monitor of purity.\n\nFinally, another method of assaying virus they do give a valid target for which to aim. The observation of particles in the electron purity is to use prelabeled cells. Cells are microscope, whilst not a good criterion of labeled with e.g. 14C-amino acids for a conpurity, does allow the detection of 'unwanted siderable period prior to infection and then structures', chased with unlabeled amino acids. Following It would be expected that constituents of the infection, infected cells are labeled with 3Hmedium would form a major part of the con-amino acids. The degree of incorporated label taminants of purified virus preparations. This is monitored throughout the purification procecan be monitored by gel diffusion tests, where dure. This method, again, is a rough guide to antisera raised against e.g. calf serum, or the degree of purity."}
