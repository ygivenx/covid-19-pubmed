The characteristic clinical sign of FIPlike disease is large palpable intra-abdominal masses, like dry-type FIP [2, 3, 6] . In addition, there are two genotypes of FRCoV based on differences in the spike (S) gene. This suggests that genotype I is associated with FIP-like disease and genotype II is associated with ECE [18] . However, we previously showed that there was no significant relationship between the genotypes of FRCoV and disease in Japan [14] . In addition, genotype I FRCoV was also detected in numerous asymptomatic ferrets in the Netherlands [9] . The relationship between FRCoV genotype and clinical symptoms thus remains unclear.\n\nReverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for epidemiological study of FRCoV infection. FRCoV gene detection in 56-61 % of ferrets in Japan and the Netherlands has been reported [9, 14] . Recently, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recombinant nucleocapsid (N) protein of FRCoV had been established, indicating that many ferrets possess antibodies against FRCoV [7] . However, FRCoV has not yet been isolated.\n\nIn animal hospitals throughout Japan, 201 fecal samples were collected from domestic ferrets between Aug 1, 2012 and Dec 8, 2015 and were examined by RT-PCR. RNA was extracted from fecal samples using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and RT-PCR was performed using a QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit (QIA-GEN, Hilden, Germany). For specific and sensitive detection of FRCoV, FRCoV-specific primers, FRCoV RdRp-F1 (5 0 -GTT GGT TGC TGC ACA CAT AG-3 0 ) and FRCoV RdRp-R1 (5 0 -GGA GAA GTG CTT ACG CAA ATA-3 0 ) were used [14] . Coronavirus (CoV)-consensus primers, IN-6 (5 0 -GGT TGG GAC TAT CCT AAG TGT GA-3 0 ) and IN-7 (5 0 -CCA TCA TCA GAT AGA ATC ATC ATA-3 0 ), were also used for the detection of coronaviruses [8] . Both primer pairs target partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. The results showed that 126 ferrets (62.7 %) in Japan were positive (Supplementary Table S1 ). Significant differences were statistically analyzed using Chi-squared and Fisher's exact probability tests. P values of \\0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. The ratio of detection of FRCoV between diarrhea (75.9 %) and other symptoms (53.4 %) was significantly different. In particular, the difference was marked in ferrets aged more than 3 years, suggesting that FRCoV is the primary pathogen or exacerbating factor for diarrhea in ferrets. In addition, most ferrets aged less than 1 year (81.6 %) were infected with FRCoV, regardless of their clinical symptoms, suggesting that most ferrets are infected with FRCoV soon after birth. Importantly, some strains, Saitama-1 strain from ferret no. 22 and Aichi-1 strain from ferret no. 160, were detected by RT-PCR using CoV-consensus primers, but not FRCoV-specific primers, even though the latter can detect FRCoV with more sensitivity than CoV-consensus primers [14] .\n\nThe nucleotide sequences of partial RdRp genes were determined using a BigDye Terminator Ver. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All sequences were deposited to the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the program MrBayes Ver. 3.2.2 [11] for MrModeltest analysis with a general time reversible (GTR) or WAG substitution matrices [15] . All trees were graphically represented using FigTree Ver. 1.4.2 [10] . The phylogenetic tree based on the partial RdRp genes showed that the FRCoV Saitama-1 and Aichi-1 strains belonged to a different cluster from other FRCoV strains (Fig. 1a) .\n\nIn order to determine the 3 0 -terminal region of the Saitama-1 genome, further sequence analysis was performed. QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and TaKaRa RNA LA PCR TM Kit (AMV) Ver. 1.1 (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) were used to amplify each fragment of the Saitama-1 and Aichi-1 strains using the primer pairs listed in Supplementary Table S2 The nucleotide sequence from the S gene to poly A was compared among FRECV MSU-2, FRSCV MSU-1, and Saitama-1 strain using SimPlot Ver. 3.5.1 [5] . SimPlot analysis showed that the Saitama-1 strain was different in some regions, including the N, 3x-like, and ORF7b genes, when compared with other strains (data not shown). Surprisingly, the 3 0 -terminal in two-thirds of S genes in the MSU-2 strain was similar to that in the Saitama-1 strain, but one-third of S genes in the MSU-2 strain was similar to that in the MSU-1 strain (Fig. 2a) . Alignment of S proteins among Saitama-1, MSU-1, and MSU-2 strains also indicated that the MSU-2 strain was similar to the MSU-1 strain in the N-terminal one-third of S protein and to the Saitama-1 strain in the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein Virus Genes (2016) 52:858-862 859 (Fig. 2b) . In addition, a low similarity in nucleotide sequences between the MSU-1 and MSU-2 strains and the Saitama-1 strain was observed in the N, 3x-like, and ORF7b genes, but the E and M genes were highly conserved among all strains (data not shown). Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the Nterminal one-third of the S protein (a.a. 1-438 of Saitama-1 S protein) and the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein (a.a. 439-1435 of Saitama-1 S protein), indicating that the MSU-2 strain was more similar to the MSU-1 strain than the Saitama-1 strain in the N-terminal onethird of the S protein (Fig. 1b) and was more similar to the Saitama-1 strain than the MSU-1 strain in the Cterminal two-thirds (Fig. 1c) . Furthermore, a phylogenetic tree based on the N protein indicated that Saitama-1 and Aichi-1 strains differed more from the other FRCoVs than from mink coronaviruses (Fig. 1d) . These results indicate that the Saitama-1 strain possesses different S, N, 3x-like, and ORF7 genes than other FRCoVs, and that the E and M genes are conserved among FRCoVs. Therefore, we consider the Saitama-1 and Aichi-1 strains to comprise a novel FRCoV genotype. In addition, these results indicate that the MSU-2 strain emerged by recombination of the S protein between the MSU-1 and Saitama-1 strains. These recombination events often occurred among CoVs, resulting in the diversity of CoV genomes. Especially, the recombination of S protein caused the cross-species transmission or change of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV [4] , porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), canine coronavirus (CCoV) type II [1] , and feline coronavirus (FCoV) [13] . Novel CoVs must emerge and drastically evolve by these recombination events. Further investigation will thus be required to determine the evolution of CoV including FRCoV.\n\nIn conclusion, novel FRCoV strains (Saitama-1 and Aichi-1) were detected in Japan. These FRCoVs appear to have emerged by recombination events among other FRCoVs. This information will be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of FRCoV in ferrets. "}
