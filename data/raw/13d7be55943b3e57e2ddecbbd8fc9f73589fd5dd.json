{"title": "Postnatal Maturation of Rat Small Intestinal Brush Border Membranes Correlate s with Increase in Food Protein Binding Capacity", "body": "In addition to their barrie r function and participation in dige stive , absorptive , and se cretory proce sse s, small inte stinal e nte rocyte s were propose d to contribute to mucosal immune re actions by pre senting antige ns coming from the gut lume n (1, 2) . Binding of fore ign prote ins to the apical brush borde r membrane (BBM) was reporte d to facilitate uptake and to in\u00afuence intrace llular proce ssing (3\u00b1 5). Interactions of luminal molecules with the BBM also could re sult in signal transduction and cellular re sponse s (6, 7) .\n\nRats are a suitable mode l for studying deve lopm ental change s in BBM archite cture and enterocytic functions, because profound change s occur during post-natal maturation. At the time of weaning, the shift from milk-base d to carbohydrate -rich fee ding is accompanie d by change s of BBM, in e nzyme activitie s, prote in and lipid composition, glycosylation, and membrane\u00afuidity (6, 8 \u00b1 10) . Furthe rmore, the ne wborn rat mucosal barrie r appe ars to be more leaky, as indicate d by highe r rate s of endocytosis (11, 12) . Enhance d inte raction of prote ins with BBM is suppose d to contribute to the increased uptake see n in ne wborn rats (10) .\n\nCon\u00aficting results were obtaine d e arlie r in our laboratory using diffe rent approache s to study intestinal food prote in binding in vitro. In e xpe rime nts using whole gut sacs, we found a maturational increase in binding and uptake of b -lactoglobulin and bovine se rum albumin whe n comparing immature 18-day-old rats with mature adult rats (13) . In contrast, a maturational decrease in the binding capaci-ties of isolate d BBM ve sicles from ne wborn to adult age was de monstrate d for a -lactalbumin, b -lactoglobulin, bovine se rum albumin, and the gliadin pe ptide B3142 (14) . O ur aims, therefore , we re to clarify whether e nhance d BBM food prote in binding occurs before weaning and to characte rize membrane compone nts that inte ract with food prote ins. Food prote ins of clinical importance (gliadin pe ptide s, cow's milk prote ins, ovalbumin) and le ctins (controls for spe ci\u00ae city of binding and for de te ction of de velopmental change s in membrane glycosylation) were use d. Anim als. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 200 \u00b1 300 g, and timed-pregnant rats were obtained from Charles-River Wiga (Sulzfeld, Ge rmany). They we re kept on a glute n-fre e and cow's milk protein-poor rat chow (diet no. C1078, Altromin, Lage, Ge rmany). Newborn rats were allowed to suckle fre ely and we re killed at the age of 24 hr. Adult rats were fasted one day prior to the study.\n\nBrush Border Mem bran e Vesicles. For isolation of brush border membrane vesicles, whole small intestines of newborn rats and proximal halves of adult small intestines we re removed and washed with cold physiological saline. Starting with homogenates of neonatal intestines or scrapings of adult intestinal mucosa, BBM ve sicles were obtained by a modi\u00ae ed Ca 2 1 -precipitation technique as described before (16) . For e ach preparation, small intestines of several newborn rats or mucosa scrapings of two adult rats we re pooled. Activities of the BBM enzymes lactase , sucrase, alkaline phosphatase , and total maltase activity we re dete rmined according to Dahlqvist (17) and Bowers and McComb (18) .\n\nOne unit was de\u00ae ned as 1 m mol substrate hydrolyzed per minute under the e xperimental conditions. Speci\u00ae c e nzyme activities were expressed as units per milligram of protein.\n\nProtein concentrations we re measured using bovine serum albumin as standard (19) .\n\nElectron Microscop y. BBM ve sicles we re \u00ae xed in 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde , 100 mM cacodylate buffe r, pH 7.4, for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C and collecte d by centrifugation (30 min at 30,000g). Pe llets were washed three times with cacodylate buffe r, pellete d, and post\u00ae xe d in 1% (v/v) osmium te troxide in cacodylate buffe r for 1.5 hr at room tempe rature. Afte r washing, the me mbranes we re dehydrate d ste pwise in e thanol and tre ate d with saturated uranyl acetate for contrast enhanceme nt. Ultrathin sections were prepared from me mbrane vesicled e mbedded in Araldite, stained with lead citrate, and analyze d with a Z eiss EM10 e lectron microscope.\n\nBiotin ylation . Food proteins were labeled with biotin, using biotinamidocaproate-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester for cow's milk proteins and biotinamidocaproate-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester for gliadin peptides as described previously (15) .\n\nGel Electrop horesis. Sodium dodecyl sulfate \u00b1 polyacrylamide ge l electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE ) was performed using the Mini-Protean II e lectrophoresis system (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) according to Laemmli (20) under nonreducing conditions. Western Blot. Electrophoretic transfe r of proteins from polyacrylamide ge ls to nitrocellulose shee ts was performed by tank blotting as described before (21) , using the Mini Trans-Blot electrophoresis transfe r cell from Bio-Rad. To enhance transfe r, SDS was adde d in a \u00ae nal concentration of 0.05% (w/v) to the electrode buffer.\n\nCh em ilum in escence Binding Assay. Intact BBM ve sicles or e lectrophoretically separate d membrane proteins were immobilized on nitrocellulose sheets by the dot blot (22) or we ste rn blot technique. Free binding sites of nitrocellulose we re blocked with 2% (v/v) Twe e n 20 in phosphatebuffe red saline (PBS), pH 7.4. To diminish nonspeci\u00ae c adhe rence, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS was used in each washing or incubation step. Afte r incubation with biotinylated proteins overnight at 4\u00b0C, bound probes we re detecte d using peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and ECL blotting dete ction reage nts. Chemilumine scence signals we re qua ntitate d d e nsitom e trica lly with the vide odensitomete r syste m Biopro\u00ae l (LTF Labortechnik, Wasserburg, Ge rmany), using the program Bio-1D ve rsion 5.08 (V ilber Lourmat Biotechnology, Marne La Valle\u00c2 e, France). Binding intensity was e xpressed as densitometric units per microgram BBM protein in relation to biotinylated standard proteins (Bio-Rad), which we re applied directly to nitrocellulose. Saturation and inhibition of protein binding we re assessed as criteria for binding speci\u00ae city. Inhibition of protein binding was measured by addition of nonlabeled proteins to solutions of biotinylated probes. Change s in binding we re calculated in relation to binding of biotinylated proteins alone. Maximal binding intensities were calculated from results of saturation e xperiments.\n\nStatistical An alysis. All data are expressed as mean 6 standard deviation (SD). Student's t te st was used for statistical analysis of diffe rences of BBM binding capacities betwe en newborns and adults.\n\nCh aracterization of BBM Vesicles. BBM vesicle s were isolate d from rat small inte stines, forming close d vesicle s of varying size s. Cytoske leton prote ins of the brush borde r appe are d as e le ctron-de nse mate rial inside the vesicle s ( Figure 1 ). Enrichm ent of BBM marke r enzyme s indicate d suf\u00ae cie nt purity of membrane preparations (Table 1) MAA binding was not saturate d in the concentration range te ste d ( Figure 3 ). Food prote in binding to adult BBM re ache d 18.6 to 27.4 de nsitom e tric units/m g BBM prote in e xce pt BLG, which was signi\u00ae cantly less bound to BBM ( Table 2) . Adult BBM bound signi\u00ae cantly more PT-GLI, CAS, BLG, ALA, BSA, and O V A than ne wborn membrane s. Lectin binding re\u00afected known change s in membrane glycosylation during postnatal maturation. According to the shift from sialylation to fucosylation, ne wborn BBM bound more PNA, MAA, and SNA, but less UEA I ( Table 2 ).\n\nIn h ibition of Bin din g. Be sides saturation, spe ci\u00ae city of food prote in binding to BBM was studie d by inhibition e xpe riments. Binding of PT-GLI, CAS, BLG, and ALA was inhibite d by a 10 3 -fold e xcess of nonlabe le d prote in. Howe ver, the obse rved aggre gation of BSA and O VA, de \u00ae ne d as the ability of the biotinylate d prote in to bind to the immobilize d unmarke d counte rpart, was not compatible with this kind of e xpe rime nt (Figure 4) . O nly in the case of weak binding due to low conce ntrations of biotinylate d prote ins was a 10 3 -fold exce ss of nonlabe le d prote in suf\u00ae cient to achie ve 100% inhibition (data not shown) . With concentrations above 0.01 m g/ml, assay sensitivity did not allow 100% inhibition of speci\u00ae c le ctin binding, too, using e ithe r nonlabe le d lectins or monosacchari des (Figure 4 ). Food Protein Bin din g to Isolated Mem bran e Protein s. Binding characte ristics of isolate d membrane prote ins were furthe r analyze d in weste rn blots to de \u00ae ne maturational diffe rences. In accordance with results obtaine d with whole BBM in dot blots, isolate d membrane prote ins of adult rats showe d highe r binding capacitie s for PT-GLI, ALA, BLG, and O V A and more binding sites than ne wborn rats ( Figure 5 ). This maturational diffe rence was also se e n with BSA and CAS (de nsitom etric pro\u00ae les not shown) . Common or at least adjoining binding sites for food prote ins were de te cted on newborn membrane prote ins of 124 \u00b1 131 kDa, 117\u00b1 120 kDa, and 66 kDa. Adult membrane prote ins of 128 \u00b1 138 kDa, 115\u00b1 120 kDa, 103\u00b1 105 kDa, 90 \u00b1 92 kDa, 85\u00b1 86 kDa, 65\u00b1 67 kDa, and 45\u00b1 46 kDa share d food prote in binding abilitie s. To e xclude that the se maturational diffe rences were due to methodical errors, e g, failure to isolate ne wborn BBM prote ins, lectin binding was studie d in western blots, too. Newborn membrane prote ins had more binding site s and e nhance d binding capacity for SNA, PNA, and MAA than adults, whe re as UEA I binding was lowe r in ne wborns compare d to adults (data not shown) .\n\nInhibition e xpe rime nts with unre late d prote ins indicate d common binding of food prote ins be cause cow' s milk prote ins, e spe cially CAS, were able to re duce BBM binding of an unre late d prote in, whe reas O V A interfe red to a lower e xte nt with cow' s milk prote in and gliadin peptide binding (Table 3) . It was not possible to discriminate whe the r inte rfere nce was due to prote in interactions in solution, to nonspe ci\u00ae c membrane binding, or to the pre sence of common binding site s. On the othe r hand, cow' s milk prote ins and O V A did not inte rfe re with le ctin\u00b1 BBM interactions and did not disturb the che milumine scence reaction. Addition of a 10 4 -fold e xce ss of nonlabe led food prote ins to solutions of biotinylate d lectins at a conce ntration of 0.1 m g/ml did not re sult in signi\u00ae cant change s of le ctin binding. Due to its strong adhe rence to BBM, only CAS was able to re duce le ctin binding by 19.4 \u00b1 37.7% .\n\nDiffe rent approache s have be en re porte d to study BBM\u00b1 prote in interactions and to characte rize deve lopme ntal change s in BBM structure . Be side histochemical studie s (23, 24) and utilization of isolate d enterocyte s (25) and of gut sacs (3, 13, 26, 27) , BBM vesicle s have bee n use d. As the smalle st unit for studying membrane structure and function (28) , BBM vesicle s allow description of e nte rocytic binding structure s in detail, at the same time reducing the complexity of the inve stigate d syste m. Binding characte ristics of rat BBM ve sicle s for food prote ins and le ctins have bee n asse ssed in centrifugation and \u00ae ltration binding assays (14, 16, 29 \u00b1 33) . A conside rable drawback of the se methods was the ir low sensitivity in de tecting weak food prote in binding.\n\nTo improve se nsitivity, we use d a chemilumine scence binding assay in this study. Food prote in binding to BBM of ne wborn and adult rats was found to be spe ci\u00ae c with re gard to saturation and inhibition. Ove rall food prote in binding capacity of BBM was comparable to le ctins, except for BLG. Saturation of food prote in binding was only re ached at 10-to 100fold highe r molar conce ntrations compare d to le ctins and CAS. This differe nce betwe en food prote ins and le ctins is in accordance with former studie s (16, 33) . In contrast, the former centrifugation binding assay did not show any saturation and inhibition of food prote in binding to BBM vesicle s (13, 14, 16) . In our opinion, results of nonspe ci\u00ae c food prote in binding to BBM were obscure d by methodological dif\u00ae cultie s in the centrifugation binding assay, which did not allow washing of ligand\u00b1 BBM comple xe s without concurrent loss of binding signals.\n\nWhile Colye r et al (25) reporte d up to 50% inhibition of gliadin pe ptide binding to isolate d e nte rocyte s, Farre\u00c2 Castany et al (34) demonstrate d nonspe ci\u00ae c binding of a pe ptic\u00b1 tryptic dige st of gliadin to the colon carcinom a e pithe lial cell line HT-29. The authors studie d bindin g prope rtie s of ovalbum inblocke d and glutaralde hyde -\u00ae xed HT-29 cells, which might be an e xplanation for the obse rve d concentration-de pe nde nt, but nonspe ci\u00ae c, gliadin binding. Nevertheless, gliadin is able to associate with many prote ins, mainly by hydrophobic interactions (35) . To exclude weak hydrophobic inte ractions be twee n food prote ins and BBM, we studie d binding phe nomena in pre sence of the de te rge nt Twee n 20.\n\nExperiments with BBM vesicle s in dot blots gave a marke d incre ase in food prote in binding capacitie s from ne wborn to adult rats. This \u00ae nding contradicts pre vious re sults of a maturational de crease of food prote in binding to rat BBM (14, 16) and might be due to the more sensitive and spe ci\u00ae c binding assay use d in this study. Howe ver, our \u00ae ndings are in accordance with data on increased binding and uptake of BLG and BSA obtaine d in gut sacs of adult rats compare d to juve nile rats (13) .\n\nFor measure ment of strong and highly speci\u00ae c le ctin binding to BBM, the binding assay system was not found as critical. The same maturational change s in BBM glycosylation were obse rve d using e ithe r the chemilumine scence binding assay in this study or othe r methods as de scribe d e lse where (29, 30, 32) . Neve rthe le ss, minor differe nce s indicate d enhance d sensitivity of the chemilum inescence assay. Binding of SNA to adult BBM and of UEA I to ne wborn membrane prote ins was measurable , in contrast to the earlie r re sults of Taatje s and Roth (24) and Le noir et al (36) , which were base d on a diffe rent methodology.\n\nThe maturational decrease in the lipid/prote in ratio of BBM (10, membrane prote in pro\u00ae les in Figure 5 ) is accompanie d by an increase in food prote in binding to isolate d BBM prote ins. In western blots, membrane prote ins of adult rats had more binding site s and highe r binding capacitie s than BBM prote ins of ne wborn rats. Although membrane prote ins are denature d during SDS-PAGE , the ir binding prope rtie s are not necessarily de stroye d, as has be en shown for seve ral re ceptor\u00b1 ligand inte ractions in weste rn blots (37, 38) .\n\nO ur data of multiple binding site s do not support the hypothe sis of distinct re ceptors for food prote ins comparable to the e nzyme aminope ptidase N as a receptor for coronavirus (39) . Moreover, prote in\u00b1 oligosaccharide inte ractions le ading to membrane attachme nt could be e xclude d be cause food prote in binding patte rns did not show any similarity to le ctin patte rns in western blots. Lectin-like binding characte ristics of BSA and ALA binding to rat BBM vesicle s and of gliadin to model glycoprote ins were rule d out earlie r by othe r inve stigators (27, 40) . In our opinion, prote in\u00b1 prote in inte ractions are responsible for food prote in attachme nt to BBM. This kind of interaction was obviously not in\u00afuence d by the diffe re nt composition and physicoche mical characte ristics of the investigate d cow's milk prote ins, gliadin pe ptide s, and ovalbumin. O n the contrary, common or at le ast adjoining binding site s e xist for the diffe re nt food prote ins, as indicate d by western blot \u00ae ndings. Inhibition by unre late d food prote ins supports this possibility. Control e xpe riments could exclude artifacts cause d by biotinylation of food prote ins. V e sicle de struction leading to re le ase of brush borde r cytoske leton prote ins could possibly in\u00afuence binding characte ristics re corde d in We ste rn blots. For example , actin as a major compone nt of adult brush borde r might have caused the positive signals in the are a of 45 kDa. There fore furthe r e xpe rime nts have to be conducte d to ide ntify structure s in membrane binding and their orientation towards the intestinal lume n in vivo.\n\nIn conclusion, contrary to e arlie r re ports, BBM food prote in binding was found increased during ente rocytic maturation of rat small intestine. It has to be ke pt in mind that any experimental de sign using isolate d BBM vesicle s in vitro lacks important parts of the mucosal barrie r (41) . Diffe rences in prote in re sistance to inte stinal hydrolysis (gliadin, BLG in contrast to CAS) (42) in\u00afue nce the ir acce ss to small intestinal e pithe lial cells in vivo. For e valuation of conseque nces of change s in food prote in binding capacity cause d by alte rations in BBM composition, it should be inve stigate d whe the r proce sse s of uptake and intrace llular processing or signal transduction occur. It is well-known that endocytosis is stimulate d by prior membrane adsorption (43, 44) . Moreover, diffe rence s of intrace llular proce ssing after uptake of membranebound prote ins or pinocytosis of\u00afuid-phase molecule s have bee n re porte d for small intestinal e pithelial cells (4, 5, 45) . O ur results clearly indicate that BBM composition in\u00afue nces its capacity for speci\u00ae c food prote in binding. In this re gard, studie s of enterocytic membrane alte rations possibly involve d in the de velopm ent of food-se nsitive e nte ropathie s would be worthwhile ."}
