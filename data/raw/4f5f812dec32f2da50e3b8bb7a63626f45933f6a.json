In the 84 clinical practice, saturated oxygen (< 93% in rest state), reparatory rates (>30 85 times/min), and deteriorated chest radiology imaging (X-Ray and CT more high 86 resolution) provide references to confirm their severity [5, 9, 10] . Because of 87 the hypoxia stress, most patients will experience an over reactivated immune 88 storm, including elevated their expression level of some specific immunological 89 cytokines and changes of certain types of immune cell counts [6, 11] . Biopsy 90 analysis also showed that the lung bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with 91 cellular fibromyxoid exudates [12] . However, the CT imaging and immunology 92 detection is not only expensive but also far unavailable as for the explosive 93 increase of suspected cases, in particular in those hospitals not well equipped.\n\nCan some routine clinical characteristics or/and laboratory measurement, or 95 their combinations predict the occurrence of severe cases?\n\nIn this study, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of 97 those patients who progressed to severe pneumonia later and found that five CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
