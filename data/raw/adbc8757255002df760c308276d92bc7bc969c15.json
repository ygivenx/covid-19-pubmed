{"title": "Spinned Poisson distribution with health management application Ramalingam Shanmugam", "body": "Let Y be a random number of cases in an observable set S of non-negative integers with unknown parameters \u0398 \u2208 {\u03b8, \u03c1} in a Poisson type chance mechanism where the infected cases are quickly removed by the health management even before the completion of data. The analysis of data has to be carefully done with a selection of an appropriate underlying probability distribution. The usual Poisson distribution is inappropriate to use because of the impact of removing infected cases on the incidence rate and the chance of observing a new case. The parameters \u03b8>0 and \u03c1\u22650 portray respectively the incidence rate and the impact level of removing infected cases. Consequently, both the random observation count Y and the incidence rate, \u03b8 become size/ length biased. Published articles in the statistical literature deal with only the size/length bias on observation, Y in a marginal sense excluding the impact on the parameter (see pages 149-150 and the reference section of Johnson et al. [3] for a full list of published articles on size/length biased sampling). There is no article in the literature discussing the sampling bias on the incidence rate, \u03b8. The sampling bias on both the observation and the incidence rate should be dealt with simultaneously to be realistic in modeling the situation in which the infected cases are removed.\n\nFor this purpose, assume that the observation Y is proportional to a sampling weight factor w y; r; q \u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 1\u00fery \u00f0 \u00de 1\u00ferq \u00f0 \u00de . An insight for this weight factor arises from the following reasons. The observation y is impacted by the removal bias \u03c1\u22650 due to the removal. A scale shift on one in the weight factor is necessary to avoid degeneration of probabilities to zero when \u03c1=0. The denominator (1+\u03c1\u03b8) in the weight factor echoes the impact of the removal bias on the incidence parameter \u03b8 and it is a necessity for the expression in (1) to be a bona fide probability distribution.\n\nIn this weighted Poisson sampling framework, when \u03c1=0, it nullifies the impact of removing cases. When \u03c1=1, it is called size/length biased sampling. That is found in count distribution literature. Since the seminal work of Cox [2] , many articles have appeared about size/length biased sampling. These articles considered only the bias in the observation, Y, but not the bias in the parameter. This article is the first one to suggest that the selection bias could influence the parameter(s) as much as the observation.\n\nA new Poisson distribution in (1) incorporates the chance mechanism of rare events in which the infected cases are removed.\n\n\u00de e \u00c0q q y =y! y \u00bc 0; 1; 2; :::; 1; 0 < q < 1; 0 r < 1 \u00f01\u00de\n\nThe probability distribution in (1) is named the spinned Poisson distribution (SPD). Is expression in (1) a bona fide probability distribution? The answer is affirmative. The following arguments prove it. For the specified parameter space 0 < \u03b8 < \u221e; 0 \u2264 \u03c1 < \u221e and the sample space y=0,1,2,\u2026,\u221e, the right side of the expression (1) has clearly non-negative valued functions. In addition, the sum of their non-negative values is equal to one and it is proved below.\n\nThe SPD is versatile enough to describe data from engineering, finance and economics in which the removal of cases occurs before completing the data collection. For example, in finance studies, a defaulted homeowner may be removed from a potential home mortgage insurance list.\n\nThe SPD has several interesting statistical properties as explained below. The estimation of its parameters, assessment of its survival function, and the application of the hypothesis testing procedures for the SPD are of interest. Results are demonstrated, using Bailey's [1] data on Nigeria's smallpox incidences in Section 3. The Table 1 Table 1 . The Fig. 2 helps to compare the goodness of fit test results.\n\nIn this section, several statistical properties are derived and interpreted. The expected value \u03bc = E(Y) is obtained in a straightforward manner as stated below. That is,\n\nneglecting the fraction 1 1\u00ferq < 1. When the impact of removing infected cases is negligible (that is, \u03c1=0), the mean in (2) reduces to just the expected value, \u03b8 of the usual Poisson distribution. From (2), note that and it attests to a property that there are triangular relationships among the mean \u03bc, parameters \u03b8 and \u03c1. In a similar manner the variance\n\nThe expression (3.a) is the second factorial moment. The expression (3.a) could be rewritten equivalently, for \u03c1\u22600,\n\nThe expression (3.b) illustrates a mean-variance relationship like the one for the usual Poisson distribution in which the mean and variance are equal (that is, \u03c3 2 = \u03bc).\n\nWhen there is negligible impact of removing the infected cases (that is, \u03c1=0), the result in (3.a) and (3.b) reduce respectively to the second factorial moment and variance of the usual Poisson distribution. Otherwise, there is an intrinsic relationship among the incidence rate, impact of removing infected cases and the expected number of infected cases.\n\n. This result confirms that \u03c1\u21920 when \u03bc\u2192\u03b8, a property of the usual Poisson distribution.\n\n\u00de is the threshold probability for the event Y=0. However, a recurrence relationship among the spinned Poisson probabilities exists and it is\n\nThe recurrence relationship in (4) of the SPD implies that\n\nand so on. These relationships point out that the datacollection mechanism that includes the removal of infected cases indeed imposes a sampling bias on both the observation and the incidence rate. When the impact of removing infected cases turns out to be negligible (that is, \u03c1\u21920), the SPD in (1) reduces to the usual Poisson distribution\n\nSee Johnson et al. [3] for properties of the usual Poisson distribution. Now, other properties of the SPD are derived. First, note incidentally that the statistic 1 1\u00ferY is an unbiased estimate of the parametric function 1 1\u00ferq because\n\n\u00de e \u00c0q q y =y!:\n\nFurthermore, the variance of the statistic 1 1\u00ferY is obtained using a formula (see Stuart and Ord [4] for details) that\n\nwhere m 2 j and s 2 j denote the mean and variance respectively of j = U or V. In this set up, note that U=1 and V=1+\u03c1Y.\n\nHence, the variance of the statistic 1 1\u00ferY is Var 1\n\n\u00de e \u00c0q q y =y!:\n\nConsequently, an expression for computing the correlation coefficient between two sample statistics Y and 1 1\u00ferY is obtained and utilized to confirm whether the SPD matches well the given data in Section 3. The correlation coefficient\n\nis zero when \u03c1=0. Otherwise (that is for \u03c1\u22600),\n\nusing (2) \n\nusing the MLE of the dispersion \u03c3 2 and the mean \u03bc. Consider a random sample y 1 , y 2 ,....,y n from the SPD in Eq. 1. The MLEs are asymptotically efficient. The log likelihood function is ln L \u00bc P n i\u00bc1 lnp y i ; r; q j \u00f0 \u00de. The first derivatives of the log likelihood function with respect to the parameters \u03b8 and \u03c1 give their score functions. Equating the score functions @ q ln L and @ r ln L to zero gives the MLEs. The exact value of the MLEs b q mle and b r mle could be obtained by solving iteratively the equations\n\nand\n\nThe process is tedious for the exact values. The process can be eased if approximate values are acceptable. For this purpose, the expression (9) is approximated using Taylor's series approximation. That is,\n\nwhere the notation @ b r mle \u00bc0 6 b r mle \u00f0 \u00de portrays the derivative of 6 b r mle \u00f0 \u00de with respect to b r mle evaluated at b r mle \u00bc 0 and b q mle is the MLE of the incidence rate. Hence, the approximate values of the MLEs are b q mle % y \u00c0 1 \u00f010\u00de\n\nwhere y is the sample mean and s is the sample standard deviation.\n\nNext, an expression for the survival function of the SPD is derived. The cumulative distribution function of the usual Poisson distribution is expressed in terms of the cumulative chi-squared distribution function in Johnson et al. [3] , which is tabulated extensively in books. Following this line of thinking, a similar relationship between the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of the SPD and the chisquared distribution can be established. For this purpose, let CDF m; q; r \u00f0 \u00de\u00bcPr Y m \u00bd be CDF of the SPD for a prespecified m in the sample space. Implicitly, the survival function Sf m \u00fe 1; q; r \u00f0 \u00de\u00bc1 \u00c0 CDF m; q; r \u00f0 \u00deof the spinned Poisson distribution is, after algebraic simplifications,\n\nin which CDF # 2 2m;df 2q \u00f0 \u00de denotes the cumulative chi-squared distribution function with 2 m degrees of freedom (df) and the percentile (2\u03b8).\n\nAn immediate removal means that the number of days to remove a next infected case is Y=0. The probability for an immediate removal to occur, with m=0, is\n\nThe scenario, \u03c1=0 is indicative of no impact of the removing the infected cases. Substituting \u03c1=0 in (12) and (13), they reduce to the results for the usual Poisson distribution. On the contrary, the scenario, \u03c1=1 is indicative of the presence of impact on the observation count Y and on the incidence rate \u03b8 due to removing the infected cases. Otherwise (that is when \u03c1>0), there is a significant impact on the observation and on the incidence rate due to removing infected cases. A hypothesis testing procedure about the impact parameter \u03c1 is therefore worthwhile. The likelihood ratio concept can be used to test the null hypothesis H o : \u03c1 = \u03c1 o where \u03c1 o is zero against a research/ alternative hypothesis H 1 : \u03c1 = \u03c1 * \u2260 \u03c1 o . Note that the likelihood ratio under the null hypothesis is \u039b r o \u00bc L y 1 ; y 2 ; ::; y n ; b q r O \u00bc0 ; r o \u00bc 0 L y 1 ; y 2 ; ::; y n ; b q b r mle ; b r mle 6 \u00bc 0 and is \u039b r \u00bb \u00bc L y 1 ; y 2 ; ::; y n ; b q r \u00bb ; r \u00bc r \u00bb L y 1 ; y 2 ; ::; y n ; b q b r mle ; b r mle 6 \u00bc 0 under a research/alternative hypothesis. The MLE of the incidence rate is b q mle; r o \u00bc0 \u00bc y under the null hypothesis and b q mle; r\u00bcr \u00bb % y \u00c0 1 under the alternative/ research hypothesis. The MLE of the impact parameter\n\nunder the alternative/research hypothesis. Under the null hypothesis, the minus log likelihood ratio is\n\nand it follows a non-central chi-squared distribution with one df and the non-centrality parameter\n\nSee Wald [5] for definition and properties of the non-central chi squared distribution. A unique property of the MLE is that the MLE of a function is the function of the MLE of the parameters. In addition, the variance-covariance matrix of the MLE of the parameters is the inverse of the information matrix \n\nand (2). The determinant of the information matrix in (16) is\n\nusing (3.b) and (10). The variance-covariance matrix of the MLE of the parameters is \n\nwith the MLE of b q mle and b r mle . In addition, the non-central chi squared distribution with one df and non-centrality parameter \u03b4 approximately follows 1 \u00fe d 1\u00fed times a central chi squared distribution with 1\u00fed \u00f0 \u00de 2 1\u00fe2d \u00f0 \u00de df (see Stuart and Ord [4] for details of this equivalence). This means that the null hypothesis H o : \u03c1 = \u03c1 o where \u03c1 o is zero will be rejected in favor of the research/alternative hypothesis\n\nwhere the right side is the critical value based on the 100 (1\u2212\u03b1) th percentile of the central chi squared distribution\n\n1\u00fe2 b dr o \u00c0 \u00c1 df and a significance level \u03b1 \u2208(0,1). The statistical power of the test statistic in (14) can be examined with a selection of a specific value for \u03c1 in the research/alternative hypothesis. Let H 1 : \u03c1 = \u03c1 * \u2260 \u03c1 o in which \u03c1 o is zero. It then suggests that the statistical power is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis H o : \u03c1 = \u03c1 o in favor of the research/alternative hypothesis H 1 : \u03c1 = \u03c1 * \u2260 \u03c1 o . That is, under the research hypothesis, the minus log likelihood ratio is\n\nIn addition, it follows a non-central chi-squared distribution with one df and non-centrality parameter \n\nThis non-central chi squared distribution with one df and non-centrality parameter b d r \u00bb approximately follows df. The power is the probability of accepting the research/alternative hypothesis H 1 when \u03c1 = \u03c1*. That is, studies in which some cases are removed from the study population due to a screening criterion. The results based on the spinned Poisson distribution could become the foundation for performing further reliability or validity analysis. These and other aspects are currently under investigation and the findings will be reported later."}
