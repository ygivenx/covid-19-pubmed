In the cited series of infection in pregnant subjects, the 5 neonates, born between 27 and 36 wks gestation, were not infected by the H1N1 [1]. In a previous series of SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus) infection in pregnant women, infants born to mothers with the respiratory viral infection did not acquire the infection through vertical transmission [2].\n\nThe first case report of H1N1 neonatal pneumonia has been published [3]. I wonder if there are any more cases of neonatal H1N1 elsewhere in the world. We have since managed a dozen of neonates with RSV infections in the early months of 2010 but no H1N1 to date. These neonates did not require ICU support and were only managed symptomatically.\n\n1. Shek CC, Ng PC, Fung GPG et al. Infants born to mothers with severe acute respiratory syndrome.
