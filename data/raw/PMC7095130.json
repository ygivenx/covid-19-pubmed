{"title": "News in brief", "body": "Munich\n\nA team of European astronomers has discovered dozens of supermassive black holes \u2014 without using a telescope.\n\nInstead, the team used a \u2018virtual observatory\u2019 that searches through images previously taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, the Very Large Telescope in Chile and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The computer program, called the Astrophysical Virtual Observatory, was able to identify 30 very faint, distant black holes by comparing X-ray and visible light images. The results are set to appear in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n\nOnly nine of this particular class of black hole have previously been found, according to lead author Paolo Padovani of the European Southern Observatory in Garching, Germany. The new finds may force theorists to reconsider their previous estimates of how many black holes there are in the Galaxy, he says.\n\nSupporters of virtual observatories say they help to boost the powers of existing telescopes, and give astronomers in parts of the world without access to telescopes the chance to conduct cutting-edge research.\n\nRome\n\nAfter a spate of diseases that have passed from animals to humans, and with the rise in such diseases spreading between countries, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Organisation for Animal Health have banded together in a bid to control future outbreaks.\n\nMany researchers agree that the next major pandemic could result from a virus jumping the species barrier between animals and humans. Such viruses \u2014 including HIV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and some influenza viruses \u2014 are often deadly because humans have not had the chance to develop resistance to them. The last major flu epidemic, in 1918, which killed more than 40 million people worldwide, was probably caused by a bird virus.\n\nOn 24 May, the two organizations agreed to combine their resources and establish a global information network. \u201cRapid distribution of information and an improved coordination between countries is essential to control contagious diseases,\u201d the two agencies said.\n\nWashington\n\nA group of five scientists poised to advise the US Department of State will \u201cbring fresh ideas and new perspectives to America's foreign policy,\u201d according to Secretary of State Colin Powell.\n\nThe researchers were announced as the first Jefferson science fellows on 26 May. The group, which includes an evolutionary biologist, a biochemist and a remote-imaging specialist, will take up their posts in August.\n\nThe Jefferson Science Fellows programme allows tenured researchers to work in Washington DC for a year, advising policy-makers on science-related issues. In return for their year's education in statecraft and diplomacy, the researchers must act as consultants for the state department for five years after they return to their home institutions.\n\nNew Delhi\n\nIndia's new coalition government has named Harvard-educated lawyer turned politician Kapil Sibal as science minister.\n\nUnlike his predecessor, Murli Manohar Joshi, Sibal will not serve as a full cabinet minister. He will hold the lower rank of minister of state, and will have to seek cabinet approval on policy issues. But science secretary Valangiman Ramamurthi says this should not be seen as a signal that science has been given lower priority by the new prime minister, Manmohan Singh.\n\nSibal's appointment has been generally welcomed by India's scientific community, despite his lack of science training. He has promised to simplify regulations in biotechnology and to give top priority to stemming India's brain drain.\n\nLondon\n\nThe UK research councils have given stem-cell research a \u00a316.5-million (US$30-million) boost. The funding will go towards 57 research grants in embryonic, adult and fetal stem-cell research, including the development of new embryonic stem-cell lines.\n\nThis should be welcome news to the country's stem-cell bank at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in Potter's Bar, which opened last month with just two cell lines. Britain has much more liberal rules regarding stem cells than countries such as the United States, something that many think should lead to a research advantage. \u201cThis is the first direct attempt to exploit our lead in stem-cell research,\u201d says Richard Oreffo from the University of Southampton's School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cWithout a boost like this, the path of stem-cell research would be long and tortuous,\u201d says Ann Logan, a molecular neuroscientist at Birmingham University who has received \u00a3400,000 to study how adult stem cells may be used to regenerate brain neurons.\n\nWashington\n\nNASA has loaned several pieces of the wreckage of the space shuttle Columbia to an independent aerospace researcher.\n\nThe move marks something of a departure for NASA. The remnants of two previously destroyed spacecraft \u2014 the shuttle Challenger and the burned Apollo 1 capsule \u2014 were stored away out of respect for the lost astronauts. But last year, following a recommendation by shuttle launch director Mike Leinbach (right), NASA decided to grant companies access to the Columbia debris for research.\n\nThe first recipient, materials scientist Gary Steckel of The Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, California, will use propellant tanks and one of the shuttle's engines to study how the heat and pressure of atmospheric re-entry affects the composite materials used in such parts. NASA notified the families of the Columbia astronauts before releasing the debris."}
