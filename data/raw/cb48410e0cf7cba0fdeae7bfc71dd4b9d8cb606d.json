{"title": "Sudden unexpected death in adults caused by intracranial pathology", "body": "A wide range of deaths from natural causes is encountered in the field of forensic medicine. Despite the advances in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, a substantial number of sudden and unexpected deaths are caused by infections. In most medicolegal systems these deaths are subject to a forensic investigation.\n\nThe World Health Organization defines sudden death as that occurring within 24 h of the onset of symptoms. Some authors variably define sudden death as that occurring within 1, 6, and 12 h of the onset of symptoms.\n\nForensic pathologists should be aware of the importance of infectious causes of sudden death in the present era of bioterrorism and emergent and reemergent diseases. Genetic engineering has led to the development of highly infectious and virulent strains of microorganisms (e.g., anthrax). Emerging infectious diseases are infections whose incidence has increased in recent years and/or threatens to increase in the near future. Reemergence refers to the reappearance of a known infection after a period of disappearance or decline.\n\nDeath from infectious agents may occur as a direct consequence of the infection or from complications such as immunosuppression caused by the infection and adverse reactions to therapeutic drugs. Sudden death due to infectious disease may be classified by organ system involvement (e.g., cardiac -myocarditis; nervous system -meningitis and encephalitis) or according to the etiological agent (e.g., viral, chlamydial, bacterial, fungal, protozoal, or helminthic) . The common infectious causes of sudden death by organ system are listed in Table 1 .\n\nThe morphological findings at autopsy will depend on the type of organism, the site involved, and the host's response to the organism. Microbiological demonstration of an organism does not equate to disease, as a host may be colonized by bacteria or the patient may have an asymptomatic viral infection. The exquisite sensitivity of molecular tests, e.g., polymerase chain reaction, may exacerbate this problem if the results are not correlated with the pathological findings at autopsy.\n\nCategories of human pathogens include prions; viruses; chlamydiae, rickettsiae, and mycoplasmas; bacteria; fungi; protozoans; and helminths. Infection by prions, rickettsiae, and mycoplasmas is not normally associated with sudden and unexpected death.\n\nViruses are ubiquitous and cause a spectrum of disease in humans. These may range from asymptomatic infection, severe debilitating illness, to sudden death. Viral infections causing sudden death usually involve the cardiac, respiratory, or the central nervous system. Morphologic findings in viral infections may include intranuclear and/or intracytoplasmic inclusions, multinucleate giant cells, and tissue necrosis (cytopathic effect). In many cases the diagnosis can only be made on special investigations, e.g., culture, electron microscopy, serology, or molecular testing. Viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Marburg, Lassa, and Ebola virus may cause sudden death in children. If there is any suspicion of a viral hemorrhagic fever, special care must be taken to avoid unwarranted exposure to health workers. The local public health officials must be informed and consideration given to limited autopsy examination in consultation with a virologist (e.g., postmortem blood sampling and liver biopsy).\n\nCardiac involvement usually takes the form of myocarditis. Although many viruses may cause myocarditis (Table 2) , coxsackie A and B are responsible for most cases. Fulminant coxsackievirus infection may also cause leptomeningitis, florid interstitial pneumonitis, pancreatitis, and focal hepatic necrosis. Coxsackie B viruses should also be considered as a cause of sudden infant death.\n\nAt autopsy, the myocardium is usually mottled and flabby. Histology reveals focal infiltrates of inflammatory cells (neutrophils and/or lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages). At least two foci of individual myofiber necrosis associated with 5-10 inflammatory cells are required for the histological diagnosis of myocarditis. Focal aggregates of lymphocytes not associated with necrosis may be seen in elderly patients and are not diagnostic of myocarditis. Myocardial involvement may be patchy. For adequate histological sampling, it is recommended that at least six sections be taken from various areas of the myocardium, including the left ventricle and nodal tissue.\n\nIndirect damage to the myocardium may occur as an allergic response to a viral infection and eosinophilia, e.g., in eosinophilic myocarditis. This is a rare cause of sudden death in apparently healthy children due to the cardiac toxicity of eosinophils.\n\nStudies have shown that persons undergoing severe mental or physical stress may have reduced immunity to viral infections. In the investigation of sudden death in athletes, the diagnosis of viral myocarditis must be considered. Enteroviral infection may also play an important role in coronary plaque instability and may precipitate coronary thrombosis, leading to ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death.\n\nViral infections of the respiratory system Sudden death due to viral involvement of the respiratory system may be due to fulminant viral pneumonitis or bacterial pneumonia complicating an initial viral pneumonitis. Viruses implicated include respiratory syncytial virus, human herpesvirus-6, and parainfluenza virus in children, and adenovirus and influenza A and B in adults.\n\nMicroscopically, the findings of a viral pneumonitis are usually nonspecific and include edema and widening of the interstitial septa with a mononuclear cell infiltrate. In some cases, diagnostic viral inclusions may be demonstrated.\n\nEmergent diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have a high mortality and may cause death within hours. SARS refers to an acute respiratory illness caused by infection with a novel coronavirus currently known as the SARS virus.\n\nPostmortem histopathological evaluations of lung tissue show diffuse alveolar damage consistent with the pathologic manifestations of acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is usually mild interstitial inflammation with scattered alveolar pneumocytes showing cytomegaly, and enlarged nuclei with prominent nucleoli.\n\nWhen faced with the finding of diffuse alveolar damage at autopsy, the pathologist should consider other infective causes such as influenza, para influenza, respiratory syncytial, and adenoviruses, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Pneumococcus, Legionella, and Pneumocystis. \n\nSudden death may occur due to direct infection of the nervous system or a complication of a viral infection such as toxoplasmosis in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Herpes simplex virus-1 encephalitis is usually due to reactivation of latent infection. Commonly affected sites include the temporal lobe(s) (medial before lateral), the inferior frontal lobe(s), and the Sylvian cortex(es). At autopsy there is widespread and asymmetrical necrosis. In fulminant cases there is prominent hemorrhage and swelling with raised intracranial pressure and brain herniation. Histological findings include perivascular cuffing by mononuclear cells (Figure 1 ) and, in a small number of cases, intranuclear inclusions may be seen in astrocytes and neurons.\n\nIn adult HIV infections, sudden death from infective causes may be due to opportunistic infections (e.g., toxoplasmosis) or rupture of mycotic aneurysms.\n\nIn viral central nervous system infections the brain may appear macroscopically normal, especially in very young, elderly, debilitated, and immunocompromised individuals. Specimens should be taken for microbiology and histology. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be sent for antibody studies. Tissue for histological examination should be taken from normal, obviously abnormal, and transition areas. Routine sections should be taken from the cerebral cortex (all four lobes), thalamus, basal ganglia, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum. As poliomyelitis has been described as a cause of sudden death in infants, autopsy protocols in sudden death should include histological examination of spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia.\n\nChlamydia pneumoniae may be associated with myocarditis and sudden unexpected death.\n\nBacterial infections are responsible for sudden unexpected death in adults and children. In the pediatric population bacterial infections of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system account for the majority of cases of sudden death.\n\nBacterial infections of the cardiovascular system Bacterial causes of myocarditis include Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Borrelia burgdorferi. In B. burgdorferi, cardiac involvement occurs in 1-8% of cases and death may occur as a result of conduction disturbances. In diphtheritic myocarditis myocardial damage is caused by the release of toxins. Bartonella-induced silent myocarditis has been described as a cause of sudden unexpected cardiac death in athletes.\n\nGranulomatous myocarditis may also lead to sudden death ( Table 3 ). The mechanism of death includes arrhythmias, cardiac rupture, coronary occlusion, obstruction to pulmonary blood flow leading to fatal hemorrhage, and impaired myocardial contractility.\n\nCardiac tuberculosis is usually an autopsy diagnosis. Histological examination of the myocardium shows a nodular, miliary, or diffuse infiltrative pattern. The coronary arteries may show narrowing or complete occlusion due to an intimal or diffuse tuberculous arteritis. It is uncommon to demonstrate acid-fast bacilli within the lesions. Molecular tests such as the ligase chain reaction (LCR) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be used to demonstrate the organism. Sudden death in infective endocarditis occurs as a result of perforation of a free-wall myocardial abscess or rupture of a valve leaflet. Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for 10-20% of cases and is the major cause in intravenous drug abusers. Other bacterial causes include Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella (HACEK group). Negative bacterial cultures may be found in 10% of cases as a result of prior antibiotic therapy. The most common sites of infection are the aortic and mitral valves, except in intravenous drug abusers, where the right-sided valves are primarily affected.\n\nTertiary syphilis causing aortitis may cause sudden death from rupture of aortic aneurysms with aortic dissection. The mechanism of death is either blood loss with hypovolemic shock or a fatal cardiac tamponade from intrapericardial rupture.\n\nBacterial infections of the respiratory system Sudden death from acute epiglottitis occurs from respiratory obstruction caused by swelling of the epiglottic folds, uvula, and vocal cords. The most common cause of acute epiglottitis in developing countries is Haemophilus influenzae type B. In countries with established immunization programs, the incidence of H. influenzae epiglottitis has decreased and other bacteria, such as streptococcus, staphylococcus, and pneumococcus, have been implicated as possible causes. Postmortem blood cultures are positive in 50-75% of cases.\n\nLobar pneumonia ( Figure 2 ) and confluent bronchopneumonia are the most frequent cause of sudden death from acute pulmonary disease. Some 90-95% of lobar pneumonia is due to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3. Bronchopneumonia is caused by staphylococci, streptococci, H. influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and coliform bacteria.\n\nPulmonary tuberculosis may result in hemoptysis, which can cause hypovolemic shock and sudden death. Histologically, caseating granulomas are found. Acid-fast bacilli are demonstrated using the Ziehl-Neelsen stain (Figure 3) . Corynebacterium diphtheriae produces a gray pseudomembrane from the pharynx to the larynx, and this may lead to respiratory obstruction and sudden death.\n\nLegionnaire's disease is associated with outbreaks of sudden death. The disease is caused by Legionella pneumophila, a facultative intracellular organism. It causes severe pneumonia in the elderly, in smokers, and in immunocompromised patients. The organisms may be transmitted via droplet spread from contaminated air-conditioning units and water coolers. The organism may be demonstrated by a modified silver stain (Dieterle stain) or by immunofluorescence and culture.\n\nPyogenic meningitis may cause sudden death. The causative organism varies according to the age of the patient ( Table 4) .\n\nThe location of the exudates depends on the organism. In H. influenzae it is basally located. In pneumococcal meningitis it occurs over the convexities of the brain in the parasagittal region ( Figure 4) . Microscopic examination reveals neutrophils filling the subarachnoid space with extension of the inflammation into the leptomeningeal veins in fulminant cases.\n\nBlood spread is the most common means of entry; however other routes of infection include local extension of infection, e.g., paranasal sinusitis, osteomyelitis, direct implantation, and via the peripheral nervous system.\n\nDiffuse bacterial meningitis may follow rupture of a brain abscess, which may lead to sudden death.\n\nThe organisms may be demonstrated by microbiological culture of the CSF and examination of Gram stains of the CSF and brain tissue.\n\nBacterial urogenital tract infections Fulminant acute bacterial pyelonephritis may lead to septicemia, causing sudden death. At autopsy, the kidneys show tubular necrosis with interstitial suppurative inflammation. Renal papillary necrosis may also be present.\n\nSevere bacterial enterocolitis may lead to sudden death, especially in the young. The pathogenesis of the diarrhea depends on the cause. Vibrio cholerae and Clostridium perfringens cause diarrhea by ingestion of a preformed toxin that is present in contaminated foods. Enteroinvasive organisms such as Salmonella, Shigella, and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli invade and destroy mucosal epithelial cells. Death occurs as a result of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.\n\nBleeding peptic ulcers that are caused by Helicobacter pylori may be the first indication of an ulcer and account for 25% of ulcer deaths, many of which are sudden and unexpected. Fulminant bacterial peritonitis secondary to acute appendicitis, acute salpingitis, ruptured peptic ulcer, diverticulitis, strangulated bowel, and cholecystitis may cause sudden death. Primary peritonitis may occur postsplenectomy and in patients with splenic hypoplasia. Patients with sickle-cell disease may have anatomical or functional asplenia. The former is due to repeated bouts of infarction leading to autosplenectomy. The latter is due to a defect in opsonization of encapsulated bacteria.\n\nMassive bilateral adrenal hemorrhage with adrenocortical insufficiency may occur as a result of septicemic shock from overwhelming bacterial infection (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome). The most common association is with Neisseria meningitidis septicemia; however, other virulent organisms, e.g., H. influenzae and Pseudomonas species, may also lead to this syndrome.\n\nSudden death due to fungal infection may occur in an immunocompromised host such as in HIV/AIDS. Organisms include Cryptococcus (meningitis or disseminated disease) and Pneumocystis carinii (pneumonia).\n\nIntravenous drug abusers are susceptible to endocarditis due to fungi such as Candida. These patients are prone to fungal thromboembolism, leading to sudden death.\n\nSudden death may also be due to a complication of fungal diseases such as fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage complicating actinomycotic meningitis or fatal hemoptysis complicating pulmonary mucormycosis.\n\nDiagnostic modalities include culture of the organism and the histological demonstration of the organisms in tissue. This may be facilitated by special stains such as the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) or Grocott's methenamine silver stain.\n\nFatal cardiac tamponade may occur with intrapericardial rupture of an amebic liver abscess due to Entamoeba histolytica. Fatal amebic meningoencephalitis may be caused by Naegleria fowleri. The organism enters the arachnoid space through the cribriform plate of the nose. There is meningeal hemorrhage with fibrinoid necrosis of blood vessels.\n\nCerebral malaria does not usually cause sudden death. However, it may be the primary cause of sudden death in nonimmune persons. Susceptible individuals are tourists, business travelers, and sailors. At autopsy, the brain is swollen and may have a ''slate gray'' color due to the brown-black malarial pigment called hemozoin. Histology reveals petechial hemorrhages as well as intravascular parasitized red cells. Small perivascular inflammatory foci called malarial or D\u00fc rck's granulomas may be present. Sudden death in malaria may also be due to rupture of an enlarged spleen. An enlarged spleen is fragile and more vulnerable to rupture. Other infections that may lead to splenic rupture and sudden death are infectious mononucleosis and typhoid.\n\nSudden death due to cardiac involvement in Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi) occurs in 5-10% of acute cases. The damage to the myocardium causes fatal ventricular tachycardia. Histological examination shows myofiber necrosis with an acute inflammatory reaction. Clusters of organisms may be found within dilated myofibers, resulting in intracellular pseudocysts.\n\nClinically occult helminthic diseases such as hydatid disease (Echinococcus granulosus) and neurocysticercosis (Taenia solium) may cause sudden death. In neurocysticercosis death may occur due to epilepsy or raised intracranial pressure. Parasitic cysts containing scolices are present, especially in the subarachnoid space, cortical sulci, and cortical gray matter. Large multilocular cysts (racemose cysts) may be present in the basilar cisterns near the cerebellopontine angle ( Figure 5) .\n\nIsolated cardiac hydatid cyst is an uncommon manifestation and accounts for fewer than 3% of all hydatid disease. Sudden death may be the initial manifestation of the disease. Death may be due to involvement of the left ventricular myocardium or to massive pulmonary embolism.\n\nAll autopsies must be approached using universal precautionary principles.\n\nIn sudden deaths complete autopsy examination is recommended with appropriate tissue and body fluid sampling for special investigations.\n\nAutopsy sampling for microbiological investigations is indicated in the following circumstances: sudden unexpected deaths in children and adults, deaths in immunocompromised patients, deaths in patients with clinically suspected infections, and deaths with organ changes of infection. The problems encountered with autopsy microbiological testing are contamination during procurement of the sample because of poor technique or due to the postmortem spread of commensals.\n\nTo prevent false-positive postmortem blood cultures the following should be observed: the body should be refrigerated as soon as possible; and movement of the body should be limited to decrease the possibility of postmortem bacterial spread. An aseptic technique should be used to collect the sample, which should be stored and transported in the correct medium and temperature.\n\nClose liaison with the microbiology and virology laboratories is important to guide collection, preservation, transport, and evaluation of specimens. This is particularly important in cases where there are positive cultures with negative histological findings. Sampling at multiple sites and determining the antibiotic sensitivities may be helpful in determining the significance of positive cultures. The finding of a ''pure'' as opposed to ''mixed'' culture helps to determine the significance of the findings. The type of organism in relation to the site where it was cultured also helps to differentiate contaminants from significant positive cultures.\n\nRelevant special techniques should be used by the pathologist in order to improve the diagnostic yield in infectious diseases ( Table 5) .\n\nIn a small group of cases (so-called negative autopsies) no obvious cause of death is apparent after detailed initial external and internal examination. The incidence of negative autopsies is 5%-10%; this figure improves to about 5% when special tests such as postmortem chemistry and microbiology are carried out.\n\nInfectious agents are not a common cause of sudden death. Even in cases with little or no morphological changes, investigation of appropriate autopsy samples by recently developed laboratory techniques may prove invaluable and shed light on the cause of death.\n\nChildren: Sudden Natural Infant and Childhood Death; Sudden Natural Death: Cardiovascular; Central Nervous System and Miscellaneous Causes \n\nIn the year 2000 an estimated 815 000 people died from suicide around the world. This represents an annual global mortality rate of 14.5 per 100 000 population. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), suicide is the 13th leading cause of death worldwide. It leads among violent causes of death (e.g., suicide, homicide, traffic deaths). Among those aged between 15 and 44 years, suicide is the fourth leading cause of death, and violence against the self is the sixth leading cause of disability. Suicidal behavior ranges in degree from merely thinking about ending one's life, through developing a plan to commit suicide and obtaining the means to do so, attempting to kill oneself, to finally carrying out the act of ''completed suicide''. The term ''suicide'' is based on the Latin words sui (of oneself) and caedere (to kill). The Encyclopaedia Britannica defines suicide as: ''the human act of self-inflicting one's own life cessation.'' However, it is often difficult to reconstruct the thoughts of people who commit suicide unless they have made clear statements before their death since all suicidal deaths are not clearly planned. In many legal systems, a death is certified as suicide if murder, accidental death, and natural causes can all be ruled out and if the circumstances are consistent with suicide.\n\nThis article deals with fatal suicidal behavior. This is the term proposed for suicidal acts that result in death and that directly concern forensic medicine; it does not cover nonfatal suicidal behavior, attempted suicide, or deliberate self-harm, i.e., suicidal actions that do not result in death and which may be referred to psychiatrists. Even if it is not always clearly planned, suicide is a result of an act deliberately initiated and performed by a person in expectation of its fatal outcome. Suicide is also now a major public health problem, as evidenced by epidemiologic data.\n\nAccording to WHO, taken as an average for 53 countries for which complete data are available, the age-standardized suicide rate for 2000 was 14.5 per 100 000. The rate for males was 22.9 per 100 000 and for females 6.8 per 100 000. The rate of suicide is almost universally higher among men compared to women by an aggregate ratio of 3.5 to 1. For some countries the most recent data are shown in Table 1 .\n\nOver nearly 30 years , for 39 countries for which complete data are available, the suicide rates seem to have remained quite stable.\n\nGeographically, changes in suicide rates vary considerably. According to the French National Institute on Demographic Studies (INED; Institut National des Etudes D\u00e9mographiques), which provides reliable information on suicide mortality, the rates range from 40.1 per 100 000 in the Russian Federation to 31.6 per 100 000 in Hungary, 25.1 per 100 000 in Japan,"}
