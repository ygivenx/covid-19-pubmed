{"title": "SECTION A The Clinician and the Laboratory PART IV Laboratory Diagnosis and Therapy for Infectious Diseases", "body": "The availability of rapid and reliable viral diagnostic tests, particularly nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), facilitates decision making in the prevention, treatment, public health, and infection control measures related to viral infections. With specific antiviral therapy available for many clinically relevant viruses, a specific viral diagnosis may limit the need for further diagnostic testing and unnecessary antibiotic therapy. [1] [2] [3] Two major approaches to diagnosis of viral infection are virologic (detection of virus) and serologic (detection of antibody, antigen, or both). The virologic approach includes (1) isolation of infectious virus in cell culture, (2) detection of viral antigen by immunologic methods (e.g., fluorescent antibody [FA] testing or enzyme immunoassay [EIA]); (3) visualization of viral particles by electron microscopy (EM); and (4) detection of viral nucleic acid by molecular techniques (e.g., hybridization or NAATs). Cytologic examination of tissues and cells may identify viral effects, thus prompting further investigation. Occasionally, cytologic changes can be sufficiently specific to suggest a particular agent (e.g., cytomegalovirus [CMV] ). 4 The serologic approach includes detection of the following: (1) virus-specific antibodies indicating recent, current, or past infection, as well as immunity following recovery or vaccination; (2) a significant rise in virus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody suggestive of acute or recent infection; (3) virus-specific antigens (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] ); or (4) virus-specific IgM antibody in late acute or early recovery phase sera. As the immune response matures following a viral infection, low-avidity IgG antibodies are replaced with high-avidity antibodies. EIAs capable of measuring the avidity of IgG antibodies to specific viruses have been used to distinguish primary from secondary (reactivation) antibody responses to vaccination or natural infection. 5, 6 Clinically, laboratory tests for the detection of virus infection can be divided into 3 specific categories: those used to (1) make a specific diagnosis, (2) measure virus activity in patients known to be infected (e.g., viral load testing for human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), and (3) screen for infection or a carrier state (e.g., before transplantation or blood donation).\n\nFor the detection of most viruses, specimens collected soon after the onset of clinical symptoms (preferably within the first 3-4 days) when viral shedding is greatest are preferred. Optimal specimens vary depending on the site or sites of disease. In general, tissues, aspirates, and body fluids are superior to swabs. Body sites or lesions that can be sampled easily with a swab include the pharynx or nasopharynx, conjunctiva, urethra, cervix, vagina, and vesicles or ulcers on the skin or mucous membranes. Many swabs types are available for specimen collection, including plastic swabs, wooden swabs, and swabs with a flexible wire shaft and a tip made of cotton, Dacron, calcium alginate, or polyurethane, 7 although not all are suitable for detection of some viruses. Swabs with a wooden shaft can contain toxic products that inactivate herpes simplex virus (HSV). Cotton-tipped swabs can contain fatty acids that can interfere with the survival of Chlamydia species, but they are suitable for the collection of specimens from the vagina, cervix, or urethra for the detection of Mycoplasma. Calcium alginate-tipped swabs can be toxic for lipid-enveloped viruses such as herpesviruses and some cell cultures, but they are useful for the collection of specimens for Chlamydia. Although swabs placed in a viral transport medium (VTM) can be used for NAATs, many commercial assays for detection of viruses and Chlamydia provide their own swab and transport media, which should be used. viruses cause morphologic changes (i.e., cytopathic effect[(CPE]), in the cell monolayer. Some viruses cause CPE within 2 days (e.g., HSV), others within a week (e.g., enteroviruses), and others after several weeks (e.g., CMV). For viruses that do not cause a typical CPE, detection can be based on the adsorption of red blood cells to the surface of virus-infected cells in culture (e.g., influenza and parainfluenza viruses) or by the use of interference assays (e.g., rubella virus). Presumptive identification of a particular virus or virus group in cell culture is based on the cell type, the timing and appearance of CPE, the source of the specimen, and the suspected clinical diagnosis.\n\nConfirmation of the virus isolated requires immunologic methods such as fluorescein-or peroxidase-conjugated virus-specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Antibodies to HSV, CMV, VZV, RSV, influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, measles virus, and enterovirus antigens are readily available.\n\nCentrifugation of specimens (referred to as shell vial or spin-amplified culture) onto cell monolayers on coverslips placed in the bottom of small vials or in wells, followed by incubation and staining for viral antigen by using monoclonal antibody after 1 to 3 days, shortens the time required to detect and confirm the presence of many viruses and has replaced conventional cultures in many laboratories. For slowly growing viruses such as CMV, the use of monoclonal antibody against nonstructural proteins produced early in the replication cycle (i.e., immediate early antigen [EA] or EA) allows detection of virus days to weeks before CPE can be observed by traditional cell culture techniques.\n\nTwo techniques for isolation of some viruses have been developed with sensitivity comparable to that of standard culture and shell vial methods. [15] [16] [17] Genetically engineered cell lines such as the enzyme-linked virus-inducible system (ELVIS, Quidel, San Diego, Calif) using a baby hamster kidney cell line that has been transformed by using an HSVinducible promoter (UL39 gene) and an Escherichia coli \u03b2-galactosidase gene was introduced for the isolation of HSV. The addition of a substrate for the \u03b2-galactosidase enzyme results in formation of a color reaction in the HSV-infected cells. This technique has been adapted for performing rapid HSV antiviral susceptibility testing. Mixing multiple cell types in a single shell vial culture can provide rapid detection of the following: respiratory viruses (R-Mix, Quidel); HSV, CMV, and VZV (H&V-Mix, Quidel); and enteroviruses (E-Mix, Quidel).\n\nVirus antigen detection tests can be performed directly on a variety of specimen types and are highly specific and rapid. 7 Because virus antigen is cell associated, collection of an adequate number of infected cells is important. Several commercial kits (EIA, latex agglutination, FA) are available for the detection of the following: (1) rotavirus and enteric adenovirus in stool specimens; (2) RSV, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses in respiratory tract specimens;\n\n(3) HBsAg and HIV p24 antigen in serum; (4) HSV and VZV in vesicle or ulcer swab specimens; and (5) CMV in BAL and blood specimens. The FA technique has been used for the detection of rabies virus in brain tissue, mumps virus in throat and urine sediment, and measles virus in conjunctival cells. The detection of CMV pp65 antigen in neutrophils can be used in the diagnosis and management of new or reactivated CMV infection in immunocompromised patients. 18 \n\nAlthough almost any specimen type is suitable for EM, most laboratories have replaced EM with other virus detection methods. 19, 20 Some laboratories continue to use EM for the detection of gastrointestinal pathogens such as rotavirus, enteric adenoviruses, and norovirus, as well as for detection of BK-polyomavirus in tissue biopsy and urine samples. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Disadvantages of EM include the large number of virus particles (approximately 1 \u00d7 10 6 /mL of specimen) required for detection, limited throughput, expense, and lack of availability and expertise in many centers. 24 \n\nThe increased sensitivity and availability of NAATs for detection of almost any clinically relevant virus have revolutionized testing in the Swabs and tissues for detection of viruses should be placed into VTM to prevent drying, maintain virus viability, and prevent the overgrowth of contaminating organisms. 7 Several commercially prepared VTMs are available. 7 Swabs collected for bacterial isolation that are placed in bacterial transport medium are unacceptable for detection of viruses. 7 Conversely, VTM contains antimicrobial agents that inhibit most bacteria and fungi. Specimens such as blood, bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, and other body fluids should be placed in clean, sterile containers without VTM.\n\nFor detection of most respiratory viruses, a nasopharyngeal (NP) aspirate or wash, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen provides a better yield for detection of viruses than NP, nasal, or throat swabs. 7 Multiple samples can be required to maximize yield. Freshly passed stool is superior to a rectal swab for detection of gastrointestinal viruses. 7 Specific viruses can be found in different blood cells, the plasma or serum, or both (e.g., HIV in lymphocytes and macrophages, CMV in neutrophils and to a lesser extent in mononuclear cells, enteroviruses in plasma and white blood cells). 8, 9 Blood should be collected into Vacutainer tubes containing an anticoagulant such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Recovery rates are higher with EDTA than with heparin. 10 Heparin can inactivate herpesviruses and can inhibit some NAATs 11, 12 ; this issue may be less of a concern for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and can be related to the type of heparin (sodium vs. lithium) used. 13, 14 For tissue specimens or when the lability of particular viruses (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] or varicella-zoster virus [VZV]) is a concern, VTM containing albumin or serum as a stabilizer should be used.\n\nMost viruses are stable for 2 to 3 days at 4\u00b0C (refrigerator or wet ice temperature). 7 Freezing at \u221220\u00b0C (ordinary freezer temperature) destroys or reduces the infectivity of most viruses and can alter the ability to detect viral antigen when using some commercially available kits. Beyond 2 to 3 days, specimens should be stored in an ultralow-temperature freezer (\u221270\u00b0C) and transported on dry ice. For some NAATs (e.g., detection of hepatitis C virus [HCV] RNA in serum or plasma), serum or plasma should be separated within 4 to 6 hours of collection and processed within 72 hours (if kept at 2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C) or frozen at \u221270\u00b0C until tested. 7 For serologic detection of viral antibodies or antigen, blood can be transported at room temperature. If a delay is anticipated, the specimen should be kept refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C. Serum or plasma should be separated as soon as possible after specimen collection. If an extended period will elapse before testing, the serum or plasma sample should be frozen at \u221220\u00b0C or lower. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided. For viruses for which an IgM assay is available (e.g., hepatitis A virus [HAV]), an acute phase specimen can be sufficient for diagnosis. Otherwise, an acute phase specimen is collected within a few days of illness onset and serum is stored, followed by collection of a convalescent phase specimen 2 to 4 weeks later, and the specimens are tested simultaneously.\n\nMost laboratories performing virus isolation use monolayer cell culture techniques. However, many clinically relevant viruses, such as parvovirus, human papillomavirus, hepatitis viruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), rotaviruses, noroviruses, and others, are not cultivatable in routine diagnostic laboratories; laboratory diagnosis is based on other methods. Although cultivation of HIV is possible using suspension cultures of lymphocytes, special containment facilities are required; alternative methods are used for routine diagnosis. The major viruses detected by isolation in monolayer cell culture include HSV-1 and HSV-2, CMV, VZV, RSV, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory adenoviruses, several enteroviruses (coxsackievirus, echovirus, poliovirus), and measles virus. Not all cultivatable viruses replicate in a single cell line. Thus various cell lines are used for primary isolation: diploid cell lines such as human foreskin or lung fibroblasts for herpesviruses, primary cell lines such as primary rhesus monkey kidney cells for respiratory viruses and enteroviruses, and heteroploid or continuous human epithelial cell lines such as Hep-2 cells for RSV. The types of cell lines used in the diagnostic laboratory are determined by the specimen type, season, epidemiologic data, and clinical information provided. Many PART IV Laboratory Diagnosis and Therapy for Infectious Diseases competitive assays. Results usually are measured in optical density (OD) units because of a color reaction, and results are reported either qualitatively or quantitatively in international units (IU) or index values. Interpretation of optical density units varies with the EIA-ELISA kit used and the virus antibodies being detected. A relatively newer modification of EIA (known as chemiluminescent immunoassay) uses an enzyme/ substrate combination to generate a light signal and results are reported as relative light units (RLU). Chemiluminescent immunoassays generally are considered more sensitive than EIAs.\n\nThe presence of virus-specific IgM antibody in serum obtained 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of illness permits a diagnosis of acute or recent infection for many viruses. Typically, IgM antibody disappears from serum within a few months after the acute illness, but it can persist for an extended time in some people and for some viruses. 45 False-positive IgM results can be caused by (1) cross-reactivity (e.g., among herpesviruses or from polyclonal stimulation secondary to EBV infection), 46 (2) the presence of rheumatoid factor (IgM antibody that binds to the Fc portion of IgG), 47 and (3) inherent testing difficulties. 48 Misinterpretation of IgM antibodies as indicative of an acute or recent infection also can occur as a result of (1) persistence of IgM antibody for several months after the acute illness (e.g., EBV, West Nile virus) 49 or (2) reactivation of latent or chronic viruses (e.g., HSV, HBV).\n\nFalse-negative IgM test results can reflect the following: (1) an absent, low, or delayed IgM response, especially in immunologically immature hosts (e.g., during infancy, congenital CMV or HIV infection) or in immunosuppressed patients (e.g., patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) 49, 50 ; or (2) the presence of high-titer IgG antibody (precluding binding of IgM). 20 Many commercially available kits contain reagents to adsorb IgG from the test serum or use a background subtraction step, thus reducing the possibility of interference. 51, 52 When IgG antibody tests are used to determine susceptibility or immunity to a particular virus, the sensitivity of the method is important. Detection of neutralizing antibodies can be the best predictor of immunity.\n\nThe major advantages of serologic diagnosis of acute viral infection include noncritical specimen handling and wide availability. The disadvantages include (1) the requirement for acute and convalescent sera for IgG antibody tests, (2) false-positive and false-negative IgM antibody results, and (3) a delay of 2 to 3 weeks before a diagnosis can be confirmed with short-incubation infections. Because of the many confounding factors (e.g., passive transfer of antibodies from mother to infant, receipt of immunoglobulin, immunocompromise), serologic test results always should be interpreted within the context of the clinical situation. Whenever possible, serologic diagnosis should be confirmed with the use of virus isolation or direct detection of virus antigens or nucleic acids.\n\nDepending on the serologic assay, either serum or plasma can be used. The use of other specimen types has not been well validated for most clinical virology laboratory. 19, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] In many laboratories, NAATs have supplanted virus culture, antigen detection methods, and direct molecular hybridization techniques. Three approaches have been taken: (1) target amplification such as PCR, strand displacement amplification, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, and transcription-mediated amplification systems; (2) probe amplification, including Q-\u03b2 replicase and ligase chain reaction; and (3) signal amplification, such as branchedchain DNA (bDNA) assay and hybrid capture assay. 3, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Several commercial and in-house (\"home-brew\") assays have been developed. Quantification of viral genome in plasma or serum can be used to determine prognosis, select patients for antiviral therapy, and monitor response to treatment in a variety of patient populations. 28, 33 Multiplex assays capable of detecting several viruses in a single amplification reaction have been developed (e.g., for herpesviruses and for enteric, bloodborne, and respiratory viruses), and studies suggest that these assays are cost-effective. [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] The development of automated real-time PCR using fluorescence techniques and continuous detection of amplified product has shortened detection times substantially relative to conventional PCR assays. 40 Because these assays use a closed system (i.e., amplification and detection occur in a single tube that need not be opened once the reaction is completed), they also are less prone to contamination than conventional PCR. NAAT has been applied to genotyping of viruses (e.g., HIV, HBV, and HCV), as well as for the detection of mutations that confer resistance to antiviral agents. 28 Newer molecular techniques such as pyrosequencing and whole-genome sequencing are beginning to be applied in the clinical laboratory and are providing improved genotyping of viruses, detection of virus quasispecies, and metagenomic analysis for detecting existing and new or novel viruses in clinical specimens. 41, 42 \n\nChoosing optimal tests depends on the specific virus being sought, clinical setting, specimen type, availability of kits, reagents and equipment, experience of laboratory personnel, and cost. The use of NAATs is rapidly replacing older viral diagnostic methods because of the rapid turnaround time, superior sensitivity, and ability to quantify virus density of NAATs. Several relatively simple in-house and commercially available NAATs are available for a wide variety of viruses. However, some laboratories continue to use antigen detection methods and virus culture when expertise in molecular techniques is not available or cost is prohibitive.\n\nSerologic methods can be used to diagnose a current or recent acute infection, to determine specific susceptibility or immunity, and for epidemiologic and surveillance purposes. Interpretation of serologic results is virus specific. For example, the presence of HIV antibodies indicates current infection, whereas the presence of IgG antirubella indicates immunity as a result of immunization or recovery from natural infection. Serologic diagnosis of acute infection is more useful when the incubation period is prolonged (e.g., 3-6 weeks) and antibody is present in serum concomitantly with signs of illness (e.g., EBV and CMV mononucleosis). Fig. 287 .1 shows a typical antibody response for an acute, moderate-incubation (several days to 2 weeks) viral illness such as measles. At the onset of rash or other manifestations, antibody is undetectable or is present at low titer. Within 10 to 14 days, appreciable titers of antibody are present. For short-incubation virus infections (e.g., respiratory viruses), a rise in antibody usually does not occur until the late recovery phase or during convalescence and therefore has no value for diagnosis during acute infection. Older serologic methods such as hemagglutination inhibition and complement fixation (CF), which relied on a greater than fourfold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent sera tested in parallel, have largely been replaced by solid phase immunoassays such as EIAs, passive latex agglutination, and immunofluoresence assay (IFA). The presence of antibody in high titer in a single serum specimen during convalescence usually does not permit a definitive diagnosis. Seroconversion can be used to diagnose an acute or recent infection.\n\nEIAs and ELISAs are highly standardized, can be quantitative, can detect IgG or IgM antibodies, or both, and, for some viruses such as HIV and HCV, can simultaneously detect both antigen and antibodies in a single assay. 43, 44 EIAs can be noncompetitive (\"sandwich assay\") or viruses or assays. Some exceptions include the use of saliva for the detection of HIV antibodies and CSF in patients with viral central nervous system (CNS) disease. 53, 54 Optimal Tests for Specific Viruses Table 287 .1 contains a list of the medically important viruses, major attributable diseases, optimal diagnostic specimens, available tests, and average time to a positive test result. For many tests, the time to obtain a result is a function of the test itself (e.g., culture), the logistics of laboratory testing schedules, or the need to refer a sample to a reference laboratory. The preferred test provides the fastest result with acceptable sensitivity (>90%) and specificity (>95%). The preferred diagnostic test or tests can vary, depending on the patient population being tested (e.g., immunocompromised hosts) and the clinical indication.\n\nThe optimal tests for diagnosis of the members of the Herpesviridae family vary by virus type. For suspected mucocutaneous lesions caused by HSV or VZV, clinical diagnosis is usually sufficient. If laboratory confirmation is required, an aspirate or swab of the vesicular fluid or scraping of the ulcer base placed in VTM is recommended. Other potentially useful samples include blood in EDTA when viremia is suspected The average time to a positive result may be as much a function of the test itself (e.g., culture) as it is the frequency with which the test is performed in the laboratory. c Preferred test on the basis of sensitivity, specificity, and short time to a positive test result. d Acute and convalescent (2-4 weeks after the onset of illness) serologic testing is recommended for most viruses. IgM antibody testing is available for CMV, EBV, HAV, HBVcore, HSV, measles, mumps, parvovirus B19, rubella, and varicella-zoster virus. e In cases of sexual abuse or rape, culture is recommended because of concern about false-positive results with nonculture methods. f PCR test times to a positive result vary. (e.g., neonates), CSF in a sterile container when meningitis or encephalitis is suspected, conjunctival swab or corneal scrapings in VTM in suspected cases of herpes keratitis, and tissue biopsy in VTM or frozen (e.g., disseminated HSV and VZV in neonates or immunocompromised patients). In infants, duodenal aspirates also can be collected for suspected neonatal HSV infection. Tests for isolation of virus, direct detection of viral antigen in cells using FA staining (and monoclonal antibodies specific for HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV), and detection of HSV and VZV DNA by NAATs are all available.\n\nThe yield on culture is quite variable and depends on the culture cell type used, 55 the stage of the clinical infection (yield is greatest \u22644 days of onset), 56 and the specimen type and transportation time (preferably \u226412 hours of collection). Visualization of CPE in a sensitive cell line detects 50% of HSV-positive specimens in 24 hours, 80% in 48 hours, and 95% in 72 hours. 57 The shell vial method permits detection of HSV with 66% to 99% sensitivity and 100% specificity by 16 to 24 hours. 55, 58 ELVIS has a sensitivity similar to that of both standard and shell vial culture. 15 Direct detection of VZV antigens by FA of smears from lesions is more sensitive than culture. 59 Vesicular fluid, although good for culture, is inadequate for FA testing because of the lack of cellular material.\n\nDirect antigen detection tests for HSV have variable sensitivity (47%-95%) and specificity (85%-100%). 60, 61 None is sufficiently sensitive to detect asymptomatic shedding reliably. 62 Herpes Simplex Virus and Varicella-Zoster Virus. The yield of CSF culture is <5% in biopsy-proven cases of HSV encephalitis. 63 HSV PCR performed on CSF (sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 99%) 64 is the diagnostic test of choice for HSV encephalitis and meningitis. 63 PCR results are positive at least through the first 6 to 7 days of illness, even in patients receiving acyclovir therapy. 63, 65 Conversely, because negative results were obtained in 1 study in up to 25% of first CSF samples from infants and children, 66 a single HSV PCR test does not completely exclude HSV encephalitis. HSV PCR also is useful with other clinical specimen types, 67 and it can distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2. The role of quantitative HSV PCR remains unclear. Results regarding the relationship between the amount of HSV in CSF and clinical outcome are conflicting. 68, 69 Successful antiviral therapy is associated with a decline in HSV viral load in CSF. 63 PCR for detection of VZV DNA is more sensitive than culture or FA, particularly in scrapings of older, crusted lesions. PCR can be used to distinguish vaccine-type versus wild-type VZV. Analysis of CSF by PCR and the detection of VZV antibody in CSF can confirm the role of VZV in CNS syndromes. 70 Multiplex PCR assays, capable of detecting VZV and other herpesviruses, have been evaluated and can simplify the diagnosis in patients with overlapping clinical syndromes (e.g., vesicular rash). 34 HSV-specific IgG and IgM antibodies are detectable in serum 10 to 20 days after the onset of primary infection. IgG antibodies indicate past, latent, or current infection, but not necessarily active disease. Because Herpesviridae are latent, the presence of HSV IgG antibody in organ transplant recipients is used as a risk factor for recurrences and an indication for the prophylactic use of acyclovir. 71 Because of fluctuations in HSV IgG antibody titers, serologic tests should not be used to diagnose recurrent HSV infections. IgM antibody is not a reliable indicator of primary infection because reactivation can cause a rise in IgM concentrations. 71 Commercially available EIAs, Western blot (WB) tests, and immunoblot tests based on HSV glycoprotein G antigen reliably distinguish type-specific HSV antibodies. 72 The use of HSV-2 type-specific assays has provided important information about the epidemiology of genital HSV infection and the insensitivity of clinical history. 73 Recommendations have been proposed for the appropriate use of HSV-2 serologic tests. 74 No commercially available IgM test can distinguish HSV-1 from HSV-2 infection.\n\nIgG anti-VZV is used primarily to assess susceptibility to infection, to determine the need for vaccination or risk of disease in exposed people, and to determine the duration of protection after vaccination. 75, 76 During acute VZV infection, VZV antibodies appear within a few days after the onset of rash and peak 2 to 3 weeks later. A greater than fourfold rise in IgG antibody between serum samples collected 10 to 14 days apart or the detection of VZV-specific IgM antibodies in a single sample supports a diagnosis of acute infection. However, serologic diagnosis of acute VZV infection can be confounded by heterotypic antibody increases that can occur in up to one third of patients with primary HSV infection who have experienced a previous VZV infection. 77 FA against membrane antigen (FAMA) is considered the gold standard for the detection of VZV antibodies. 76 Detection of neutralizing antibodies to VZV in healthy people by FAMA or latex agglutination correlates with protection in up to 96% of people. 78 Occasionally, VZV infection has been reported to occur in patients with low levels of VZV antibodies detected by these assays. 79 EIAs can have lower sensitivity compared with FAMA and latex agglutination assays, particularly for detecting antibodies after vaccination. 76 Newer glycoprotein (gp) EIAs appear to have improved sensitivity over older EIAs. Recognizing the difficulties of serologic testing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consider a history of receipt of 2 valid doses of VZV vaccine as evidence of protection.\n\nGuidelines for standardization of in vitro susceptibility testing of HSV have been published. 80 Resistance to acyclovir and other drugs has emerged as a clinical problem in immunocompromised patients receiving prolonged courses of continuous or intermittent suppressive therapy. 81, 82 PCR, together with sequence analysis of the DNA polymerase and thymidine kinase genes, can be used to detect mutations conferring drug resistance. 83 However, this approach is limited because one can interpret the presence only of mutations that have been associated with phenotypic HSV antiviral resistance. The significance of new or novel mutations requires confirmation.\n\nCytomegalovirus. CMV can be detected in a variety of clinical specimens by isolation, antigen detection, DNA probes, or NAATs. [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] Distinguishing between asymptomatic shedding (from urine, cervical secretions, semen, saliva, and respiratory tract secretions) and active CMV disease is often difficult. Isolation of CMV from tissues is good evidence of active infection. The preferred specimens and tests for detection and diagnosis of CMV depend on the clinical syndrome and immune function of the patient (see Chapter 206) . 84, 89, 90 To enhance culture detection of CMV in various clinical specimens, multiple shell vials should be inoculated (2 for urine specimens, tissue, and BAL and 3 for blood specimens) with staining at 24 and 48 hours and observation for blood specimens for CPE for 10 days. 91, 92 Isolation of CMV from urine obtained during the first 3 weeks of life is diagnostic of congenital infection. 89 In all other situations, distinguishing whether CMV detection is related to primary infection, reactivation or reinfection disease, or asymptomatic shedding (including from respiratory tract specimens) is impossible. In immunocompromised patients with suspected CMV pneumonia, culture of a BAL specimen compared with a lung biopsy specimen has a sensitivity of 70% to 95% and a specificity of 50% to 100%. 93, 94 Demonstration of CMV antigen in cells from BAL specimens by direct FA (DFA) staining can be more specific for CMV infection, but sensitivity is reduced. 93 Histologic examination of cells obtained by BAL for the presence of characteristic CMV intranuclear inclusions (\"owl eyes\" appearance) suggests a diagnosis of CMV pneumonia.\n\nDetection of CMV in blood (peripheral blood white blood cells, plasma, serum, or whole blood) by either CMV antigenemia (pp65 antigen) or CMV PCR can be useful in the diagnosis of active CMV disease or as a predictor of future CMV disease in transplant recipients and other immunocompromised patients. 84, [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] Results can be quantitative or semiquantitative, and several studies support a relationship between the level of CMV in blood and the likelihood of active or emerging CMV disease. [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] These assays are used in preemptive treatment strategies and for monitoring response to anti-CMV therapy. However, because of variability among commercial and in-house quantitative CMV assays, the exact level of CMV DNA or antigenemia that should be used to initiate preemptive therapy is not well established.\n\nFor the diagnosis of CMV mononucleosis in otherwise healthy people, testing for CMV-specific IgM is the preferred method. However, IgM antibodies can be detected in both primary and reactivated CMV infections and can persist for months. False-positive CMV IgM test results can occur in patients with acute EBV infection, as well as in patients with high concentrations of rheumatoid factor in the presence of CMVspecific IgG. 105 In immunologically immature hosts or in immunocompromised patients, the CMV IgM response during acute infection can be delayed or absent. Because IgM antibodies do not cross the placenta, their detection in a newborn is diagnostic of congenital infection. However, production of IgM antibodies by the newborn can be delayed or absent in up to 30% of cases, and thus a negative test result does not exclude congenital infection. 89 The major use of CMV IgG serologic testing is to determine susceptibility to infection in healthcare or childcare workers, 106 as well as to identify the CMV status of blood and organ or tissue donors and recipients. 107 In pregnant women, CMV-specific IgG avidity assays may be of value. 90 The presence of low-avidity IgG anti-CMV can be a better predictor of recent infection than IgM alone, thus increasing the likelihood of CMV transmission to the fetus. However, substantial variability in performance of different CMV avidity assays precludes clear guidance on use and interpretation. 108 Additional testing such as PCR or virus isolation from amniotic fluid may be required to confirm infection of the fetus.\n\nStandardization of in vitro CMV antiviral susceptibility testing has not been established despite the utility of this testing in immunocompromised patients, in whom resistance correlates with clinical failures. 109 Phenotypic assays are limited by long turnaround time and expertise required for performance. Genotypic assays can detect the most common mutations in the CMV UL97 phosphotransferase gene and the UL54 DNA polymerase gene that confer antiviral resistance, but these assays are not available widely. 110 Epstein-Barr Virus. In patients with suspected EBV infectious mononucleosis (IM), heterophile antibody remains the serologic test of choice. 111 These IgM antibodies can be detected easily and rapidly by using a simple spot agglutination assay (often referred to as a \"monospot\") or immunochromatographic assays. 112 Heterophile antibodies develop in approximately 80% to 85% of adolescents and adults with EBV IM 111 within 2 to 3 weeks after the onset of illness. Responses can be delayed in some people; repeat testing may be required. Results of the heterophile test can be negative in 70% to 80% of EBV infections in children <4 years of age. 112 Heterophile antibodies usually disappear within a few months but can persist for >1 year after acute illness in 20% to 70% of patients, 49 and persistence should not be interpreted as indicating recurrent or chronic IM. Cases of heterophile-negative IM in school-aged children are caused by CMV in 70% and by EBV (proven by EBV-specific serologic findings) in 16% of cases. 113 EBV serologic testing can be indicated when the diagnosis of EBV infection is strongly suspected but the heterophile test result is negative. 114\n\nindicate active infection with HHV-7. HHV-7 has been isolated from the saliva of 75% of healthy adults, 129 as well as from ill people, thus questioning the value of such testing. HHV-7 has been isolated only rarely from PBMCs of healthy asymptomatic people compared with people with active infections; this finding suggests that PBMC cultures may have diagnostic value. 130 Specific primers for PCR amplification of HHV-7 have been developed that do not amplify the DNA from any other human herpesviruses and have been included in a multiplex assay. 131, 132 Human Herpesvirus 8. Testing for HHV-8 is available only in research settings. PCR has been used for detection of HHV-8 DNA in PBMCs and tissues. 133 The use of plasma or serum for HHV-8 PCR has no value for identifying active infections. 119 Serologic assays can detect IgG anti-HHV-8 but not IgM anti-HHV-8. Although serologic tests are useful for seroprevalence studies, the role of these tests in diagnosing and managing HHV-8 infections has not been established. 134 \n\nNumerous viruses including RSV, influenza viruses A and B, human parainfluenza viruses (types 1, 2, 3, and 4), adenoviruses (subtypes A to E), rhinoviruses, human coronaviruses 229E, OC43, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and the Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus (MERS CoV) can infect the respiratory tract and cause clinically indistinguishable signs and symptoms. The increasing development of NAATs for detection of respiratory viruses (whether individually or in multiplex PCR assays) has significantly simplified and improved the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections. 38, 135 NAATs have been applied to NP washes, aspirates, and swabs, as well as BAL and endotracheal tube (ETT) aspirates, with superior sensitivity than culture or antigen detection. Early sample collection (within the first few days of symptom onset) further improves sensitivity. Results with NAATs are available within 1 to 5 hours, thus substantially shortening the turnaround time compared with culture (mean, 3-7 days). When NAATs are not available, some laboratories may continue to use culture or antigen detection tests. The sensitivity of antigen detection techniques (for RSV or influenza viruses, or both) such as EIA microtiter plate kits, membrane filter EIA, and DFA range from 84% to 96%, with a specificity of 92% to 96%. 37, [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] The membrane filter EIA for RSV detection offers the advantage of providing a result within 15 to 20 minutes. [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] Several rapid antigen detection kits, including point-of-care tests, are available for the detection of influenza A only, influenza A and B together (without distinguishing between them), and influenza A or B. [142] [143] [144] [145] [146] [147] [148] [149] [150] Evaluations of rapid tests for the detection of seasonal influenza virus, as well as the pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus, indicate relatively poor sensitivity (which is affected by the circulating strains and specimen type) but high specificity. These tests have not been evaluated fully for the detection of avian influenza A/H5N1. When goodquality respiratory specimens with well-preserved epithelial cells are used, DFA staining using monoclonal antibodies has a sensitivity of 80% to 90% and a specificity of >90%. [146] [147] [148] Some antigen detection assays can detect multiple respiratory viruses simultaneously. 140 Numerous studies have confirmed the superiority of NAATs for the detection of respiratory viruses, with some tests capable of detecting mutations within influenza strains that confer resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors. [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] The use of serologic tests for the diagnosis of acute respiratory virus infections generally has little clinical value, other than for epidemiologic purposes, and these tests are not routinely available. They play no role in determining immunity or response to vaccine (e.g., influenza virus). [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] \n\nThe routine diagnosis of all infections with hepatitis viruses is based on serologic testing. Serum or plasma can be used and should be separated from blood within 24 hours of collection. The diagnosis of acute HAV infection is made by demonstration of IgM anti-HAV. 156 Immunity to HAV following natural infection or immunization is determined by measuring hepatitis A IgG or total (IgG and IgM) anti-HAV. 156 Currently, no role exists for reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR measurement of HAV RNA for routine diagnosis, but it can assist in characterizing strains during outbreak investigations.\n\nIn acute and chronic HBV infection, both HBsAg and anti-hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) usually are present. 157 IgM anti-HBc generally The IFA test is considered the gold standard, although EIA and immunoblot assays can be used. 111 IFA tests have more uniform performance characteristics, whereas EIAs can vary because of the wide variety of antigen preparations used in different kits. The most useful diagnostic test is IgM anti-EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA), which appears within 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms, disappears within months, and is 91% to 98% sensitive and 99% specific. 49, 111, 114 False-positive results can reflect the presence of rheumatoid factor, other herpesvirus infections, and antinuclear factors in EIA test systems. False-negative results can occur if samples are collected late in the course of the illness. IgG anti-VCA is elevated during symptoms of illness and can persist for life, and thus it is the most reliable marker of EBV seropositivity. IgG anti-Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen [EBNA]) appears late, generally after 6 weeks, and persists for life. Several months after recovering from IM, a patient is expected to have IgG antibodies to VCA and EBNA, but low or absent VCA IgM antibodies and EA antibodies 111 (see Fig. 208 .3).\n\nDirect tests for EBV, such as cultivation in cord blood leukocytes, direct detection by immunofluorescence staining, or detection of DNA, 115, 116 are performed in some laboratories. EBV can be isolated from oropharyngeal washings or circulating lymphocytes of 80% to 90% of patients with IM. PCR detection of EBV DNA in the CSF of patients with HIV infection is strongly associated with primary CNS lymphoma. 116 Following organ and marrow transplantation, the use of quantitative EBV PCR using blood specimens can help predict the development of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. 117 The relative merit of testing whole blood, leukocytes, plasma, or serum is unclear. Elevated levels of EBV DNA in peripheral blood can be an indication to decrease immunosuppressive therapy or to consider therapies such as CD20 + monoclonal antibodies or EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 117 Rarely, EBV infection is associated with an acute fulminant disease (e.g., X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome and virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome). 118 Persistent high-titer EBV antibodies, except against EBNA, are characteristic but can be absent. The diagnosis depends on detection of virus or its genome.\n\nHuman Herpesvirus 6. Primary infection with human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) occurs in most children before the age of 2 to 3 years, and routine laboratory testing usually is not performed. Detectable antibodies in primary infection generally appear 3 to 8 days after the onset of fever. The following serologic criteria are considered diagnostic of primary HHV-6 infection: (1) antibody seroconversion between acute and convalescent phase serum or plasma specimens collected 2 to 4 weeks apart; (2) detection of HHV-6-specific low-avidity IgG antibodies; (3) positive serum IgM in the absence of IgG antibodies; and (4) a greater than fourfold rise in IgG antibody by IFA or anticomplementary immunofluorescence assays. 119 Current commercial assays for IgG anti-HHV-6 do not distinguish between variants A and B and can cross-react with HHV-7 and CMV. 120, 121 Antibody avidity testing can be used to differentiate primary HHV-6 from HHV-7 infections. IgM anti-HHV-6 alone is not a reliable indicator of acute or recent infection because IgM can be found during reactivation or reinfection and approximately 5% of adults have detectable IgM anti-HHV-6 at any time. 119 IgM may not be detectable in some culture-positive children. 120, 122 During acute primary HHV-6 infection, virus can be isolated from cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 100% of infants, but not after recovery. 123 HHV-6 DNA can be detected by PCR both during acute illness and after recovery. 121, 124 Monoclonal antibodies are available for direct detection of HHV-6 antigen and have been used to confirm cell culture CPE and for immunohistochemical staining of tissues.\n\nIn immunocompromised patients, HHV-6 infection can be associated with substantial morbidity and mortality rates. 125, 126 Proof of HHV-6 causation is difficult because specific antibodies can be absent and demonstration of viral DNA in PBMCs can represent latent infection. Although PCR detection of HHV-6 DNA in serum or plasma has low sensitivity, it can be a better marker for active infection. PCR results were negative in the serum or plasma of 57 healthy adults but positive in 94% of 17 patients with exanthem subitum, 23% of 13 bone marrow transplant recipients, and 22% of 18 HIV-infected patients. 127, 128 Human Herpesvirus 7. Serologic tests for HHV-7 are not available widely. Some degree of cross-reaction between HHV-6 and HHV-7 antibodies results from cross-reactive epitopes on the viruses. 120 Responses can be distinguished by antibody avidity testing. 120 A significant rise in HHV-7 antibodies with stable or absent antibodies to HHV-6 may HDV superinfection of a patient who is chronically infected with HBV, anti-HDV generally persists indefinitely because infection becomes chronic in most cases. Measurement of HDV RNA by RT-PCR remains a research test. Both IgG and IgM anti-HEV can be measured using research or commercial assays. 169 Because of the use of different antigens, assays show significant variability in sensitivity and specificity. 170 IgG anti-HEV is positive in most patients 1 to 4 weeks after the onset of disease and becomes undetectable by 3 months. IgG anti-HEV typically declines after infection. In areas where HEV is not endemic, RT-PCR can prove useful as a confirmatory test.\n\nA multitude of viruses can cause acute gastroenteritis. In most cases, laboratory diagnosis is not required or indicated except perhaps for infection control purposes, during institutional outbreaks, or for public health reasons. Stool samples placed in a clean, sterile container without VTM or preservative for the detection of enteric viruses should be collected within the first 48 hours of illness. Rectal swabs may not contain sufficient virus for EM detection. Stool specimens are stable at 4\u00b0C for up to 1 week. Although freezing at \u221270\u00b0C can permit prolonged storage, EM detection is reduced by repeated freezing and thawing that destroys the morphologic features of viral structures. None of the enteric viruses can be cultivated readily in conventional cell culture systems, but all can be detected by EM. Commercial EIA, latex agglutination, and membranebased tests with >95% sensitivity and specificity are available for detection of rotaviruses, noroviruses, enteric adenoviruses, and astroviruses. 19, 20, 171 PCR-based assays (including multiplex assays) for these viruses are available commercially, 36, 172, 173 and they are the methods of choice for diagnosing enteric viruses. Serologic testing for enteric viruses has no clinical role except during outbreak investigations.\n\nEnteroviruses generally are stable and survive in the environment for weeks; rapid transport of clinical specimens to the laboratory is not critical. Enterovirus viability decreases slowly over days to weeks at room temperature and is preserved for decades at \u221270\u00b0C. Appropriate specimens include the following: CSF; serum or whole blood; pericardial fluid; tissue biopsy samples (e.g., myocardium); urine; stool; and rectal, nasal, and throat swabs. Although many enteroviruses can be grown in cell culture, some serotypes (e.g., coxsackievirus A groups 1, 19, and 22) fail to grow in standard cell culture. Isolation of enteroviruses requires 4 to 7 days. 174 Virus can be isolated more frequently from stool (80%\u221285%) and throat swabs (50%\u221260%) than from CSF (40%\u221260%) and serum or peripheral leukocytes (40%\u221250%). Because of the lack of a common antigen among enteroviruses, immunoassays for direct detection are not available. EM is not useful for diagnosis because of the low quantity of virus in most clinical samples.\n\nRT-PCR has been used to test CSF, cardiac tissue, and pericardial fluid, as well as serum, and has significantly improved the speed of detection of enteroviruses, with a reported sensitivity of 81% to 100% and a specificity of 92% to 100%. [175] [176] [177] In comparison, culture has a sensitivity of only 40% to 60%. 174 Detection in urine samples is poor, probably because of nonspecific inhibitors of PCR. 178 In respiratory specimens, crossamplification of some rhinoviruses can occur.\n\nClinically, the detection of enteroviruses in stool and respiratory specimens must be interpreted cautiously. Asymptomatic shedding of wild enterovirus from the gastrointestinal tract can occur for weeks or months. Additionally, oral polio vaccine virus can be shed in stool and, less commonly, in the throat of young vaccinated children. Detection of virus in CSF, the genitourinary tract, tissue, or blood is proof of a causative role.\n\nMeasuring antibody titers for enteroviruses is of limited diagnostic value. A separate neutralization assay must be performed for each enterovirus subtype.\n\nThe laboratory diagnosis of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) viruses can be made by virus isolation, detection of antigen, the use of RT-PCR, or serologic testing. Suitable samples for isolation or detection of viral indicates acute HBV infection but can also be detected during a flare of inflammation in chronic carriers. By definition, a person with persistently positive HBsAg for >6 months is considered chronically infected. Isolated anti-HBc positivity can occur during (1) acute infection between the loss of detectable HBsAg and the emergence of detectable HBsAb (\"core window\"), (2) late chronic infection when HBsAg levels have fallen to less than detectable levels, (3) coinfection with HCV or HIV that suppresses HBsAg production, (4) infection with a mutant HBV, or (5) a false-positive result. The role of quantitative HBsAg assays is being evaluated for monitoring patients with chronic HBV infection. The presence of HBV e antigen (HBeAg) and the absence of anti-HBe are markers of greater infectivity and correlate with increased risk of progression to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. 157 The presence of anti-HBe is an indicator of likely recovery. The presence of HBsAb at a level >10 IU/mL is considered protective against acute infection. HBsAb levels can decline to less than 10 IU/mL after 10 to 12 years in many vaccine responders. These people remain protected from acute infection likely as a result of immune memory. 158 The presence of HBsAb alone reflects previous immunization, whereas the presence of HBsAb together with HBcAb reflects recovery from previous natural infection. 157 Although HBsAg and HBsAb were believed to be mutually exclusive, as many as one third of carriers of HBsAg will also have detectable HBsAb. 159, 160 The mechanism is uncertain, but it may be related to coinfection with different subtypes. Thus current recommendations are that all people who are HBsAb positive be tested for HBsAg at least once.\n\nFor diagnosis of HCV infection, second-and third-generation EIAs and a supplementary recombinant immunoblot assay using recombinant structural proteins are widely available. 161, 162 Seroconversion occurs by 8 to 12 weeks following acute infection, with a sensitivity of 94% to 100% (except in immunocompromised people) and a specificity of >97% after the supplementary recombinant immunoblot assay test. HCV antibody (anti-HCV) frequently is negative at the onset of jaundice. The presence of HCV antibodies indicates active infection in approximately 70% to 80% of patients. The remaining 20% to 30% of patients have likely cleared the virus spontaneously or as a result of antiviral treatment. The use of HCV RNA assays can help distinguish between these 2 possibilities. No assay is available currently for the detection of IgM anti-HCV. The utility of measuring HCV antigen in serum or plasma has not been established but is being evaluated as a potential alternative to HCV RNA for monitoring patients during therapy.\n\nMolecular assays for the detection and quantification of HBV and HCV viral nucleic acid in serum are useful for determining prognosis, selecting candidates for therapy, and monitoring response to therapy. 161, 163, 164 A lower baseline concentration indicates a better prognosis and a greater likelihood of response to treatment. Patients responding to antiviral treatment demonstrate a significant drop in HBV DNA or HCV RNA, whereas nonresponders do not. Molecular assays also are available for HBV and HCV genotyping and antiviral resistance testing. [165] [166] [167] NAATs that detect HCV RNA in serum 1 to 3 weeks after exposure are being used as part of blood and organ or tissue donor screening and in patients with indeterminate HCV antibody results when the recombinant immunoblot assay result is inconclusive.\n\nIn most clinical situations, testing for hepatitis A, B, and C can be grouped into 1 of 3 categories: (1) acute hepatitis, (2) chronic hepatitis, and (3) immune status or previous exposure. For suspected acute hepatitis, initial testing for IgM anti-HAV, HBsAg, and anti-HCV should be performed. If all 3 results are negative, IgM anti-HBc should be tested. Repeat testing for anti-HCV is recommended in 3 to 4 weeks. When chronic hepatitis is suspected, testing should include HBsAg and anti-HCV. Some clinicians also may test for anti-HBc. Patients being screened for immunity or previous infection should have the following tests: (1) total or IgG anti-HAV; (2) HBsAb or HBcAb, or both (depending on whether one is trying to distinguish vaccine response or evidence of previous infection); and (3) anti-HCV (which is a marker of previous infection and not immunity).\n\nSerologic tests are available for both hepatitis D (delta agent) virus (HDV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV), but none is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 168 Because infection with HDV occurs solely in conjunction with HBV infection, testing for anti-HDV should be performed in only patients who are acutely or chronically infected with HBV. During coinfection with HBV and HDV, anti-HDV disappears within months following recovery from acute infection. However, in PART IV Laboratory Diagnosis and Therapy for Infectious Diseases collection. None of these assays is approved for use in people infected with HIV-2 or HIV-1 group O. Other molecular assays are available for HIV-1 genotyping for the detection of antiretroviral resistance mutations. 193 Resistance testing is recommended before initiating therapy and when treatment fails. 194 Phenotypic assays can also be performed for this purpose.\n\nThe mainstay of diagnosis for HIV remains HIV-specific serologic testing using screening EIAs or, less commonly, particle agglutination assays followed by confirmatory testing using WB or other assay. 190 Both serum and plasma are acceptable specimens. Testing systems for dried blood spots, urine, and saliva also are available. Third-and fourthgeneration EIA kits using more purified virus antigens from cell lysates, recombinant viral proteins, and synthetic peptide antigens can detect group O. These assays have increased sensitivity and specificity and fewer indeterminate results. 190 Most currently available assays detect IgG and IgM anti-HIV-1 and anti-HIV-2 in the same assay. 195 Fourth-generation screening tests can detect both HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies and p24 antigen at the same time while reducing the seroconversion window period to approximately 16 days. 190 Detuned (also known as \"sensitive/ less sensitive\") EIAs capable of measuring the affinity of HIV antibodies have been used to distinguish recent from past or distant HIV infection and to estimate incidence rates. 196 WB has been the principal confirmatory test for HIV serologic status, even though its sensitivity in seroconversion panels is inferior to that of third-and fourth-generation screening tests. Separate WB tests must be used to confirm HIV-1 and HIV-2. WB measures the antibody response to 9 HIV-1 proteins (p) or glycoproteins (gp): gp160, gp120, p66, p55, p51, gp41, p31, p24, and p17; however, the test is prone to give a high rate of indeterminate results because of detection of cross-reacting antibodies and nonspecific reactions. 190 The criterion for confirmation of HIV-1 infection using WB is the presence of antibody to any 2 of the following: p24, gp41, or gp120/ 160. 197 No antibody response to HIV-1 proteins represents a negative test result, whereas the presence of some, but not all, antibodies required for a positive interpretation is an indeterminate result. Under these circumstances, repeat testing over the next 6 months is recommended, and if WB results remain indeterminate, patients are considered not to be infected with HIV. 197 In low-risk populations, people with a positive screening EIA test result and an indeterminate WB result are rarely, if ever, infected with HIV on follow-up serologic testing. 198, 199 Rapid multispot assays developed as alternatives to WB can distinguish between HIV-1 and HIV-2 with very good sensitivity and specificity. 200 The IFA test can detect both IgG and IgM anti-HIV-1, is quite sensitive and specific, and has been used as an alternative to WB as a confirmatory test. 190 The line immunoassay can be used for confirmation of HIV-1 (including group O) and HIV-2 in a single test. Rapid point-of-care tests for both screening and confirmation that require minimal or no laboratory equipment have been developed that can yield a result in <30 minutes with sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of thirdgeneration EIA-based tests and other confirmatory assays. 201 Different laboratory diagnostic strategies are needed for the most common situations in which HIV infection is considered: (1) an adult or older child who is suspected of having HIV infection, (2) an infant with suspected vertically acquired HIV infection, and (3) someone in whom acute infection or seroconversion may develop because of exposure to an HIV-infected person. One should refer to the most recent guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for up-to-date recommendations for screening and confirmation of HIV infection. 202 The most notable change in 2014 was the recommendation to replace WB with HIV-1 and HIV-2 discriminatory assays, p24 antigen tests, and NAATs. The sensitivity of p24 antigen tests varies according to clinical disease status: 4% in asymptomatically infected people, 56% in patients with AIDS-related complex, and 76% in patients with AIDS. 203 Confirmation of vertical transmission of HIV by using EIA or WB is confounded by the presence of maternal antibodies for up to 18 months of age, and antibody tests should not be used for diagnosis of neonatal infection. 189, 204 The current recommendation is that virologic assays (NAATS for HIV RNA and HIV DNA) that directly detect HIV must be used to diagnose HIV infection in infants younger than 18 months of age. 204 HIV culture (once considered the gold standard) and p24 antigen assays should not be used in these situations based on the complexity and cost of culture and the lack of sensitivity of p24 antigen assays. [204] [205] [206] [207] [208] antigen include whole blood (particularly PBMCs for the isolation of measles), serum, buccal swabs, throat and NP secretions, urine, and, under appropriate clinical circumstances, CSF and brain and skin biopsy samples. Because these are labile viruses, rapid transport to the laboratory is important. Specimens are best kept at 4\u00b0C before processing, but they can be frozen at \u221270\u00b0C if a delay >48 hours is anticipated. Isolation of virus from blood is greatest 3 to 5 days before rash onset and declines rapidly within 2 to 3 days thereafter. Conjunctival and NP samples for isolation of measles virus can be collected 2 to 4 days before and up to 4 days after the onset of rash. Throat swabs for rubella virus isolation usually are positive (~90%) if collected on the day of rash onset but rapidly become negative within 4 days. Mumps virus can be isolated from saliva 9 days before and up to 8 days after the onset of parotitis. These viruses can be cultivated in conventional cell lines, but isolation requires 7 to 10 days for measles and mumps virus and >3 weeks for rubella virus. 179, 180 The shell vial method for measles virus has a sensitivity of 78% at 1 to 2 days and 100% at 5 days. The sensitivity of DFA staining of NP swab specimens for measles virus antigen is 100% compared with culture, but it is only 67% for throat swabs and 85% for urine specimens. Shell vial culture for detection of mumps virus has sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of traditional culture.\n\nMolecular diagnosis using virus-specific RT-PCR has been used for detection of all of 3 viruses and can be used for genotyping to help differentiate wild-type from vaccine-virus strains. 181, 182 Timing of serum specimen collection is critical because many patients do not have IgM antibody at the time of rash onset. For suspected measles virus infection, serum can be collected within 7 to 10 days of rash onset. For rubella virus infection, >90% of patients have IgM positivity \u22655 days after rash onset. Although the traditional MMR serologic test is hemagglutination inhibition for IgG antibody, several IFA and EIA IgG and IgM kits are available commercially. 183 With the declining prevalence of these viral diseases, the positive predictive value of IgM tests can be low. The presence of rheumatoid factor can lead to a false-positive IgM result, and re-exposure in a previously vaccinated person or someone with a history of natural infection can result in a secondary IgG or IgM response. Mumps IgM antibody can persist for months after acute illness. 184 Patients with IM, 185 parvovirus B19 infection, 186 measles virus, and CMV infection can have cross-reacting IgM antirubella antibodies. Similarly, infection with parvovirus B19 and rubella virus can result in crossreacting IgM antimeasles. In pregnant women, IgM antirubella should be confirmed with a second IgM assay or detection of a significant rise in IgG antibodies. 187 Avidity assays for IgG antibodies to measles and rubella viruses are available. Measurement of virus-specific IgG antibodies can be used to determine immune status. For mumps virus, crossreactions with other paramyxoviruses can occur. For rubella virus, an IgG level of >10 IU/mL is thought to represent immunity in most cases. 179 \n\nThe major diagnostic tests for HIV are serologic (EIA, IFA, and WB for HIV antibody; EIA for p24 antigen), culture, and NAATs for the detection of HIV-1 RNA in plasma or proviral DNA in whole blood or PBMCs. Culture for HIV is no longer used for routine diagnosis. 188 NAATs can be used for the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in neonates with excellent sensitivity and specificity. 189 Screening tests for HIV-1 RNA have been part of routine blood and organ or tissue donor screening programs since 2002, 190 and these tests also can be used for measuring HIV-1 in other specimen types including CSF, cervical secretions, seminal plasma or semen, and serum. The use of NAATs in people who are not known to be HIV seropositive has yielded false-positive results. 191 The major use of quantitative HIV-1 viral load assays is for monitoring a patient's response to antiretroviral therapy. 27, 192 Because of the intra-assay and biologic variability in HIV-1 RNA levels, a greater than threefold change is considered clinically relevant. Different molecular assays also can produce significant differences in HIV-1 viral load, and thus baseline values should be repeated when the laboratory testing is changed from 1 assay to another. 192 Some assays yield lower levels in the same patient if serum is used instead of plasma or if blood is collected in acid-citrate-dextrose anticoagulant rather than EDTA. Currently available commercial assays vary in specimen volume requirement (range, 50 \u00b5L to 2 mL), lower limit of detection, dynamic range, and time to result. 193 Regardless of assay format, plasma must be separated from the blood cells within 6 hours of\n\nThe recommended specimens and laboratory tests for other viruses are listed in Table 287 .1. For most of these viruses, testing is performed in highly specialized research or reference laboratories.\n\nThe major viruses infecting fetuses and newborn infants now extend beyond the traditional \"TORCH\" (Toxoplasma, rubella virus, CMV, HSV) agents and include CMV, VZV, HSV, rubella, parvovirus B19, HBV, HCV, HEV, enteroviruses, and HIV. 218 Negative maternal and neonatal serologic test results for any of these viruses generally exclude fetal infection. 218 Detection of virus (by culture, antigen detection, or NAAT) can be required before a correct diagnosis can be made. Cord blood can yield false-positive and false-negative results and should not be relied on for diagnosis. 218 Congenital CMV infection is best diagnosed by isolating CMV from the urine of neonates within the first 3 weeks of life. Beyond 3 weeks of age, isolation of CMV from urine cannot distinguish congenital from perinatal or postnatal infection. IgM anti-CMV in a newborn is positive in only 50% to 70% of congenitally infected neonates, and the test can yield false-positive results. 219 Congenital VZV infection can be diagnosed by serologic testing. Perinatal or postnatal infection with VZV, as well as infection with HSV and enteroviruses, usually can be diagnosed by conventional antigen detection or culture techniques, although NAAT testing has replaced these tests in most centers. Serologic diagnosis of neonatal HSV infections is inappropriate because a response may not be detectable for 2 or 3 weeks after infection. 220 Demonstration of rubella IgM in a neonate with features consistent with congenital rubella confirms the diagnosis; virus isolation can require 3 to 4 weeks. 218, 220, 221 Parvovirus infection during pregnancy can be diagnosed in the mother by serologic testing; detection of IgM or rising IgG antibody concentrations is diagnostic, whereas a stable IgG titer reflects past infection. Parvovirus B19 infection of a fetus with hydrops can be confirmed using NAAT for viral DNA in fetal blood, amniotic fluid cells, or both. 215, 221 CHLAMYDIACEAE Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila psittaci cause disease in humans. Psittacosis, rare in children, is confirmed serologically.\n\nBoth culture and nonculture methods are available for the detection of C. trachomatis. Culture previously was considered the gold standard because of its 100% specificity and excellent sensitivity when optimal techniques were used. 222 However, for genital specimens, its sensitivity is approximately 70% to 80% compared with NAATs, which have now become the tests of choice for routine testing. Testing of first-void urine in men and women by any of the commercially available NAATs has excellent sensitivity and a specificity of >97%, resulting in a high positive predictive value. 223 Other nonculture methods such as EIA and IFA tests and nucleic acid probe tests have little if any role in routine testing for C. trachomatis because of their inferior perfomance. 222, 224 Point-of-care tests have poor sensitivity and specificity and are not recommended. 225, 226 The optimal specimen types, collection method, and transportation requirements vary depending on the testing method used, the purpose of the test (screening vs. diagnosis), and the age and sex of patients being tested. In general, because of the lower sensitivity, technical requirements, and prolonged turnaround time, culture is not performed routinely for detection of urogenital C. trachomatis infection. Culture has been replaced by NAAT as the test of choice. For male patients, either a urethral swab inserted 3 to 4 cm or a first-catch urine sample is the preferred specimen. For women, a swab of the cervical os inserted 1 to 2 cm, a vaginal swab (including self-collected vulvovaginal swab), and a firstcatch urine sample are all acceptable specimens. 222, 226 NAATs have been used for adult sexual assault victims, and their implications have been assessed. 227 Although NAATs have been evaluated in sexually abused Testing in infants with known perinatal HIV exposure is recommended at ages 14 to 21 days, 1 to 2 months, and 4 to 6 months of age. 204 The diagnosis of HIV infection in children with nonperinatal exposure or children with perinatal exposure who are >24 months of age should follow the same recommendations as for testing of adults with suspected HIV infection and is based primarily on the use of HIV antibody tests.\n\nIn a person with known HIV exposure, antibody to the virus usually can be detected within 2 to 8 weeks after infection. Based on thirdgeneration screening assays, HIV antibodies are detectable in 50% of infected patients within 3 weeks after infection and in most of the remaining patients within 2 months. 190, 209 Virtually all infected, immunocompetent people are seropositive 6 months after exposure. 209 A mononucleosis-like syndrome develops in some patients 2 to 4 weeks after infection; p24 antigen can appear transiently during this period. 209 Arboviruses Laboratory testing generally is not performed for most arbovirus infections. For arboviruses causing CNS disease, only a brief, low level of viremia occurs, and it clears before the patient seeks medical attention. 210 Thus blood specimens for virus isolation and NAAT rarely yield positive results unless they are collected before the neuroinvasive phase of illness. For some arbovirus infections, including dengue, yellow fever, sandfly fever, Venezuelan encephalitis, and Colorado tick fever, a relatively high level of viremia occurs that can persist for days or weeks and makes virus isolation or NAAT from blood specimens possible. Virus isolation of neurotropic viruses from brain tissue and CSF occasionally is successful during the acute phase of infection; NAAT is more sensitive in these cases. 211 For most arbovirus infections, the diagnosis is established by IgG seroconversion or detection of specific IgM antibodies, or both. 210, 212 Collection of paired acute (collected during the first week of illness) and convalescent (collected 2-3 weeks later) sera is recommended. A single sample may be sufficient for diagnosis if a specific IgM test is available (e.g., eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus, western equine encephalomyelitis virus, California [La Crosse] virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus). However, in some cases (e.g., West Nile virus), virus-specific IgM can be detected in serum for \u22652 years following infection. For CNS disease, both serum and CSF specimens should be tested. The sensitivity of some of these tests approaches 100% by the 10th day of illness. 213 Traditional assays such as CF and hemagglutination inhibition tests largely have been replaced by FA and EIAs. 210 Serologic cross-reactions can occur among antigenically related viruses (e.g., St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, Powassan, and other flaviviruses). The plaque reduction neutralization test remains the most specific test for the serologic diagnosis of arbovirus infections. Neutralizing antibodies are the best indicators of protective immunity.\n\nParvovirus cannot be cultivated in routine cell culture, and thus serologic testing (rising IgG titers or the presence of IgM antibody) is the mainstay of diagnosis. 214 IgM antibodies are detectable in serum approximately 10 to 12 days after infection, when the rash or joint symptoms begin, and they can persist for several months. The sensitivity of IgM antiparvovirus exceeds 90% in the first month after the onset of symptoms. IgG antibodies appear several days after IgM and generally persist for years. Current IgG assays have a sensitivity of >90%; IgG indicates past infection. Re-exposure to parvovirus leads to a rise in IgG antibody levels. IgG avidity assays can help distinguish primary from secondary infections. 215 NAAT detection of viral DNA in serum or other specimen types may be required for diagnosis in immunocompromised patients. Parvovirus-associated aplastic crisis, chronic infection, and congenital infection can be diagnosed by PCR testing of serum. [214] [215] [216] PCR also can be used to detect parvovirus B19 DNA in bone marrow aspirates, cord blood samples, amniotic fluid cells, and biopsy specimens of placenta and fetal tissues in cases of fetal hydrops. However, parvovirus DNA may be detectable in serum for months after acute infection and for years in other tissues. 217 Thus the diagnosis of acute or chronic parvovirus infection can require both serologic testing and quantitative PCR.\n\nPART IV Laboratory Diagnosis and Therapy for Infectious Diseases species. Given their poor sensitivity, CF tests should not be used for diagnosis. 233, 238 Isolation of C. pneumoniae is difficult. The stability of C. pneumoniae in clinical specimens has not been well studied, although 1 study reported that 70% of organisms remain viable after 24 hours at 4\u00b0C. 222, 239 Throat swabs, sputum, NP, BAL, and other respiratory tract specimens placed in transport media have been used with variable success. Detection of the organism in respiratory secretions does not prove causality because asymptomatic infections occur in children and persistent shedding can occur for months after acute disease in adults. 240, 241 Molecular diagnosis with noncommercial conventional and real-time PCR tests has been evaluated. 242, 243 Sensitivities appear to be as good as those of culture, but specificity is difficult to determine given the lack of a gold standard for comparison.\n\nRapid and accurate diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is problematic because of the lack of well-standardized tests. 244 Culture is the most widely accepted method for testing respiratory tract secretions, but availability is limited, specialized broth and agar media are required, and yield is relatively low. 245 For optimal isolation, specimens (BAL, tracheobronchial secretions, sputum, NP aspirates or swabs, tissues, blood, CSF, joint fluid) should be inoculated into appropriate media (e.g., SP4) at the bedside. Most media are acceptable for both isolation and PCR assay. Specimens should be refrigerated if they are not processed within 24 hours. Because M. pneumoniae is relatively slow growing, cultures should be maintained for 4 weeks before results are reported as negative. Shedding of M. pneumoniae can persist for several weeks after the onset of illness (particularly in children), thereby confounding the interpretation of a positive culture result.\n\nDirect antigen testing (EIA, DFA, immunoblotting) for respiratory tract secretions such as sputum and NP aspirates performs well in research settings (sensitivity of 90%), but these tests are not available widely. 246, 247 Cross-reactivity with other commensal mycoplasmas can occur. Persistent shedding and detection of antigen in asymptomatic people confound the interpretation of positive results. At present, these tests are neither recommended nor used routinely in the clinical setting.\n\nConventional and real-time PCR tests for detection of M. pneumoniae in respiratory secretions have been widely evaluated. [245] [246] [247] [248] [249] [250] [251] PCR tests consistently are more sensitive than culture and antigen detection. Despite relatively high sensitivity, most studies suggest that PCR cannot be used alone to make a diagnosis of acute or recent infection; results must be used in conjunction with other results such as those of serologic tests. 245, 251, 252 When performed on CSF, PCR can be useful for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae-associated meningoencephalitis. 253 Serologic diagnosis by measurement of anti-M. pneumoniae IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies can be performed with commercially available EIA, FA, and latex agglutination kits. These tests are more sensitive and specific than CF assays and have replaced CF in many diagnostic laboratories. 244, 254, 255 Their usefulness is limited because many children are IgM negative at the time of presentation, and the time to seroconversion can be 2 to 4 weeks. 256 In children, adolescents, and young adults, a single positive IgM result can be considered diagnostic, although false-positive results occur. The combination of serologic results together with culture or PCR may provide the most reliable approach to diagnosis. 245, 250, 251 Cold agglutinin antibody titers are simple to perform and are widely available. Because only 50% to 75% of people infected with M. pneumoniae develop cold agglutinin antibodies and the test lacks sensitivity and specificity, it should not be used for the serologic diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infections. 257, 258 Genital Mycoplasmas\n\nThe laboratory diagnosis of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis infections can be achieved by isolation of the organism by using specialized broth and agar media. Organisms grow rapidly, and culture results are positive within 2 to 5 days. PCR (including multiplex assays) has been used to detect U. urealyticum and M. hominis in clinical specimens. [259] [260] [261] Mycoplasma genitalium grows slowly; cultures may not children and their medical and legal implications have been evaluated, 228, 229 culture remains the recommended method for urethral specimens from boys and for extragenital specimens (pharynx, conjunctiva, and rectum) from boys and girls. 224 NAATs can be used for vaginal specimens or urine specimens from girls. However, none of the commercially available NAATs is FDA approved for use for testing specimens from extragenital sites. The yield of culture is related directly to the quality of the specimen and the transport and storage conditions before testing. Isolation of C. trachomatis in culture from urethral specimens collected from prepubertal boys is low and is not recommended. However, if urethral discharge is present, a meatal specimen can be collected. Because of the low yield, pharyngeal specimens for isolation of C. trachomatis are not recommended for children of either sex. 224 For culture, Dacron-, cotton-or rayon-tip swabs on an aluminum or plastic shaft are recommended. Swabs with wooden shafts and those with a calcium alginate tip can inhibit growth of the organism. 222 Swabs should be placed immediately into chlamydial transport media (containing sucrose phosphate or sucrose phosphate glutamate supplemented with bovine serum and antimicrobial agents) at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C and transported to the laboratory within 24 hours. Freezing at \u221270\u00b0C can result in a 20% loss of viability. Freezing at \u221220\u00b0C should be avoided.\n\nCollection of endocervical and urethral swab specimens for NAATs should follow the instructions of the manufacturer. Swab specimens for NAAT are stable at room temperature for up to 10 days. Urine specimens for NAAT are stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature, after which they can be refrigerated for up to 4 days or stored at \u221220\u00b0C or lower for up to 2 months before processing.\n\nSeveral FDA-approved NAATs are available for the simultaneous detection of C. trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae based on PCR, transcription-mediated amplification, and strand displacement amplification. 222 All have excellent sensitivity and specificity and can be performed in 2 to 5 hours. However, they do not all perform equally well with all specimen types. 230 In 2006, a genetic variant of C. trachomatis was identified in Sweden that was undetectable by PCR, a finding that further raises the importance of continued assessment of different NAATs to ensure optimal performance. 231 Serologic tests for C. trachomatis genital tract infections are not useful for diagnosis in individual patients. 222 Antibodies to C. trachomatis persist for life. In infants, detection of anti-C. trachomatis IgM antibody by using the microimmunofluorescence (MIF) test is the diagnostic test of choice for chlamydial pneumonia. 222 Maternal IgG antibodies can persist in infants for 6 to 9 months. 222 The MIF test is the most sensitive serologic test and is the only one that detects species-and serovar-specific responses. 222 EIAs for the detection of IgM antibodies in infants have variable performance compared with the MIF test and are not specific for C. trachomatis. 222 Interpretation of a single IgG antibody test result is difficult because 50% to 70% of people can have antibodies to C. pneumoniae. 232,233 CF tests have been used widely for the diagnosis of psittacosis and lymphogranuloma venereum, but they have no value in diagnosing genital tract or neonatal chlamydial infections.\n\nAntimicrobial susceptibility testing for any of the Chlamydia species has not been standardized, and in vitro results do not necessarily correlate with clinical response to treatment. Therefore, no role exists for routine susceptibility testing for clinical management, and testing generally is restricted to a few research laboratories.\n\nAccurate laboratory confirmation of acute infection with C. pneumoniae is difficult and often is based on serologic testing despite the high seroprevalence of the organism in adults. 222, 234, 235 The MIF test appears to be the most reliable serologic test for diagnosis of acute infection, and the following criteria for a positive test have been used: (1) a greater than fourfold rise in titer; (2) IgM titer >1 : 16; or (3) IgG titer >1 : 512. IgG titers between 1 : 16 and 1 : 512 are considered evidence of previous, but not necessarily recent, infection. 233 However, the MIF test is limited by lack of standardization and availability of high-quality reagents and by the inability to distinguish past from persistent infection. 236 Comparison of EIAs (using species-specific assays) with MIF have shown good sensitivity and specificity in children with respiratory tract diseases and in control children. 237 Because some EIAs detect antibodies to lipopolysaccharide, these tests detect antibodies to all Chlamydia"}
