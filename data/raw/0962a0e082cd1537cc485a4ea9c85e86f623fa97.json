{"title": "Original Article VSITA, an Improved Approach of Target Amplification in the Identification of Viral Pathogens *", "body": "ith the development of urbanization and globalization, viruses previously confined to small, remote geographic areas is keeping spreading all over the world through global business [1] . Classical viral diseases are invading novel populations. For example, the transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus from camel to human in Arabic countries, and to remote areas, as far as Asia [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , the transmission of yellow fever virus from Africa to Asia [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , and the transmission of Zika virus from South America to the whole world [1, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Even in the area with inconvenient transportation, well-defined viruses can cause new headaches for public health, like the outbreak of Ebola in 2014-2016 [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .\n\nThe identification of epidemic pathogens is therefore challenging. Traditionally, serological tests and PCR-based methods are used as first-line identification methods in outbreak of epidemic diseases [26] . However, these methods rely on pre-defined specific antibody, primer, probes, and do not work with new pathogens. The development of next generation sequencing (NGS), with unprecedented sequencing throughput, has promised to address these problems [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . With the use of random oligo nucleic acids instead of predefined primers, unbiased sequencing is able to identify any virus sequence, known or unknown, local or imported, or even the pathogens that have never been reported [32] . However, unbiased sequencing or shotgun sequencing is susceptible to interference from environmental sequences. According to reported results as well as our own experience in processing traditional shotgun sequences, over 95% of success reads are commonly found to be host or environmental ribosomal RNAs [33] . Consequently, background depletion techniques are particularly useful for samples where viral load is much lower than environment sequences. Some studies reported different methods for background depletion, but virome enrichment techniques are usually needed to access a broader set of viruses [34] .\n\nIn the present study, we aimed to develop a Viral Sequence Independent Targeted Amplification (VSITA) approach using a set of non-ribosomal and virus-enriched octamers (V8) and compare with traditionally used random hexamers (N6) in the reverse transcription step followed by library construction and NGS analysis, attempting to reduce the interference from unwanted RNA sequences and improve NGS-based virus identification in clinical samples.\n\nFirst, we removed a total of 3,985 hexamers that primed reverse-transcription of human or bacterial ribosomal RNA (Accession Number: NR_046235.3 of human 45S pre-ribosomal sequence, J01859.1 for Escherichia coli 16S ribosomal RNA, and NR_037007.2 for Staphylococcus aureus 16S ribosomal RNA) from a candidate dataset of 4,096 (4 6 ) random hexamers. Second, we constructed a single FASTA sequence file with all the virus-related sequences available from NCBI (8,584 viral genome sequences) (release data 8 July 2014) and corresponding complementary sequences (17,168 virus-related sequences in total). Third, we aligned the remaining 111 hexamers with both virus-related sequences, and scored each of them according to the numbers of perfect matching to either sequence. Forth, we then obtained the first 30 hexamers with the highest scores in matching to virus-related sequences (sense and antisense). Finally, we intended to add 2 random nucleotides to the 5' tail of the hexame to increase flexibility and diversity of targeted priming. Thus these 6+2N octamers (V8) (listed in Table 1 ) were used in reverse-transcription step for VSITA. Figure 1A and 1B) . The discrepancy occurred in partial samples infected with Rotavirus, hADV, swlH1N1, CMV, and HIV and all the samples infected with HBV and HCV. On the other hand, viral sequences were obviously enriched by V8 in most (38/45) samples ( Figure 1C ). The inconsistency occurred in partial samples infected with Norovirus, hADV, H3N2, coxsackievirus 16, HIV, HBV and HCV. In general, the relative quantities of 18S and 28S sequences were under 1 ( Figure 1D ), indicating the better performance of VSITA to inhibit the amplification of sequences from 18S and 28S. Meanwhile, the relative quantities of viral sequences were over 1 ( Figure 1D ), representing the better enrichment of viral genome sequences by VSITA.\n\nFragment distribution of the enriched cDNA was evaluated by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system. The obvious difference in the fragment distribution was observed between V8 and N6 priming. Taking the first-strand synthesis of 2 samples as examples for comparison (Figure 2A vs. 2B, 2C vs. 2D) , the N6 priming showed higher diversity of the fragments, the fragments were more evenly distributed along the length axis (Figure 2A , 2C) while V8 priming tended to generate larger fragments more concentrated in some certain regions ( Figure 2B, 2D) . Results from other samples were showed in Supplementary Figure  1 (available in www.besjournal.com).\n\nOf all the 10 samples from patients with fever of unknown origin, N6 primers approach succeeded to identify 185 reads of dengue virus (DENV III) in sample F10 and covered 25.1% of dengue virus genome, while V8 approach identified 2,257 reads and covered 94.88% of the same dengue virus genome ( 480 (30 \u00d7 4 2 = 480) non-ribosomal virus-targeted octamers. We infer that the virus-targeted specificity of V8 will not be obviously affected as the specificity of a primer is predominantly determined by its 3' end sequence.\n\nComparison of the virus-enrichment in cDNA synthesis between the V8 and random hexamers (N6) approaches was carried out by qPCR assays of 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, and viral sequences. Our results showed V8 approach revealed improved virus enrichment and removal of human ribosomal RNA sequences in the majority of 45 archived clinical samples. Among a few samples (7/45), V8 approach showed inconsistent results (lower than N6) in virus (Norovirus, hADV, H3N2, coxsackievirus, HIV, HBV and HCV) enrichment. This phenomenon might be due to the difference in matrix constitution and targeted viral concentrations in extracted RNA of these clinical samples. Also, among some samples (6/45 for 18S, 14/45 for 28S), the performance of random hexamers was better in depletion of human ribosomal RNA than V8. Especially in the case of 28S sequences, N6 showed better performance than V8 in all of the 3 HBV-positive and 4 HCV-positive samples. The reason might be the nonspecific 28S amplification using cyber green-based qPCR analysis because subsequent melting curve analysis indicated they were nonspecific products. Though dsDNA viruses such as hADV and HBV were not primed in the step of reverse transcription by VSITA, they were involved in the virus-targeted enrichment in the PCR step due to the specificity of V8. More efforts will be needed to fine-tune the balance between virus-targeted sensitivity and specificity of V8 primer set in the future work. Nevertheless, given a large variety of virus-positive clinical samples of different types (serum, feces, and throat swabs) were tested, our data suggested VSITA is a worthwhile alternative to improve the enrichment of virus targets in the clinical samples.\n\nFurthermore, 20 clinical samples with fever or diarrhea of unknown causes were used to evaluate the performance of V8 and N6 in parallel, the fragment length analysis of generated library was conducted with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The results showed that V8 produced longer fragments distribution and lower length diversity as compared to N6. This phenomenon might be attributed to the difference of V8 and N6 primer sets in the specificity and diversity. V8 has stronger specificity inclining to amplify limited viral genome regions, while N6 has higher diversity tending to generate fragments with a broad range. The sequencing results with ion torrent PGM system revealed an obviously superior performance using V8. By the use of V8 primers, one more case of dengue virus infection was found and validated using real-time PCR in serum sample tests. In the testing of fecal samples, both methods were able to report the causative viruses in several cases, including one case of multiple infections. However, V8 showed apparently higher genome coverage and more reads hit for all virus-positive samples in comparison with N6, except for one case with Norovirus infection, where N6 covered slightly larger region on the Norovirus genome (86.93% vs. 86.53%), although V8 achieved more reads hit. Overall, NGS data implied that V8 approach was superior to N6 in the identification of virus from clinical samples.\n\nOther than virus-targeted amplification, efforts have also been made in pre-treatment of samples to improve virus identification with NGS. It is reported that ultracentrifugation of clinical samples improved virus discovery by removal of free RNA and DNA as well as bacteria [39] . Pre-degradation of free nucleic acid with cocktail enzyme system has also been reported [33] . The enrichment strategy in this study can be combined with those reported methods to provide an integrated and comprehensive enrichment solution.\n\nIn this study, only serum, swab, and feces samples were used to test the reliability of the VSITA approach followed by NGS. The performance of VSITA in other sample types, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, and other viral infection needs to be further validated in future study.\n\nIn conclusion, the VSITA approach designed in this study is demonstrated to possess higher sensitivity and broader genome coverage than traditionally used hexamers in NGS-based identification of viral pathogens directly from clinical samples.\n\nAll the authors approved the final manuscript and they have no conflict of interest to declare.\n\nAll aspects of the study were performed in accordance with national ethics regulations and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China."}
