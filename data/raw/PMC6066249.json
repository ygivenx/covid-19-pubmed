{"title": "Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) sentinel surveillance in the country of Georgia, 2015-2017", "body": "Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Increased uptake of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine have led to declines in fatal outcomes due to lower respiratory infections, from 3.4 million deaths worldwide in 1990 to 2.8 million in 2010.[1] However, SARI is associated with a large number of different viral and bacterial agents, notably influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), adenoviruses (AV), and rhinoviruses.[1]\n\nThe complex interrelationships between the prevalent pathogens that cause SARI are not well understood.[2] Influenza, in particular, is a very common and sometimes serious infectious disease, with an epidemiological picture marked by seasonal peaks in winter months and antigenic drift and shift, which potentiate local and regional outbreaks and global pandemics. A community influenza burden assessment in England found that approximately 18% of the unvaccinated population became infected with influenza A or B viruses each season during 2006\u20132011.[3] Although three-quarters of the infections in this population were asymptomatic,[3] symptoms and complications are often more severe among well recognized high-risk groups. For example, the hospitalization rate due to respiratory illness during an influenza season in Japan was 4.3 times higher among pregnant women than among those who were not pregnant.[4]\n\nRoutine monitoring of influenza A/B virus activity is the foundation for preparedness and response to the virus and its pandemic potential. Special studies are not sufficient to provide timely and actionable information to guide response. In 2006, WHO and other organizations evaluated the influenza A pandemic response and preparedness capacity in the country of Georgia, among other countries. The review found deficiencies in the local epidemiological and laboratory capacity.[5] In response, a surveillance system for SARI was established to provide improved epidemiologic monitoring of influenza and other respiratory disease within the country of Georgia.[6]\n\nAccording to previously modeled estimates regarding burden of SARI among children 0\u20134 years in Georgia,[7] influenza A virus and RSV are associated with 32% and 54% of all acute lower respiratory illnesses, respectively. Epidemiologic characterization of influenza among high-risk groups in Georgia has not been previously reported in the literature. This study aimed to characterize the seasonality and epidemiology of SARI in the country of Georgia over two influenza seasons (2015\u20132016 and 2016\u20132017), to describe the etiological and clinical patterns observed, and to assess seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness using a case-test negative design.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s sentinel-based SARI surveillance network collects epidemiologic, clinical and virologic data on patients who present with Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) at five clinical inpatient sites. One site is located in Tbilisi, the country\u2019s capital which is in the eastern region of the country, and the four other sites are located in Kutaisi, the second largest city in the country\u2019s central-west region.\n\nCase selection followed the WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza [8] with cases enrolled through an alternate day, systematic sample method. SARI cases were defined as a respiratory infection with fever of \u2265 38\u00b0C, cough, onset within the last 10 days, and hospitalization.[8]\n\nHospitalized patients with SARI provided demographic information, including age, sex, and residence through questionnaires. The surveillance system also collects patients\u2019 self-reported history of seasonal influenza vaccination within the past year in response to the question, \u201cAre you vaccinated against influenza?\u201d Participants who responded affirmatively were subsequently questioned about when they were vaccinated, and were only recorded as having received the vaccine if it was received specifically for the on-going season. Based on date of sampling and enrollment into the study, cases of SARI captured in the sentinel surveillance system between September 29, 2015, and March 15, 2017, were included in this present manuscript.\n\nA single pharyngeal and nasal swab were collected from each patient at the time they were diagnosed as a SARI case by the physician. After collection, the nasal and pharyngeal swabs were inserted into the same 2 ml cryovial containing viral transport medium. The swabs were expressed on the side of the cryovials and broken off into the cryovials. These specimens were stored in an indexed cryovial box inside a cooler of wet ice for shipment to the laboratory at Richard Lugar Center for Public Health Research in Tbilisi, Country of Georgia, where they were preserved at -80\u00b0C until molecular studies were performed.\n\nThe QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were used for viral RNA and DNA extraction. To guarantee RNA integrity, samples were lysed under highly denaturing conditions to inactivate RNases. Alcohol was added and lysates loaded onto the QIAamp spin column. Viral RNA and DNA bind specifically to the QIAamp silica membrane while contaminants pass through. Pure viral RNA/DNA were eluted in a 60 \u03bcl buffer. Wash buffers removed impurities and pure, ready-to-use RNA/DNA was then eluted in water or low-salt buffer. Total nucleic acid extracts were stored at -80\u00b0C until further processing by PCR.\n\nFTD Respiratory Pathogens 21 (Fast Track Diagnostics) multiplex Real-Time PCR diagnostic strategy was used to detect influenza A, pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (A/H1N1pdm09 or A/H1pdm09), influenza B, rhinovirus, coronavirus NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus A/B, bocavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B, adenovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The CFX96\u2122 Real-time PCR System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) that detects five different fluorescent dyes simultaneously was used for multi-pathogen detection in one clinical sample. To identify A/H3 virus, we used a real-time RT-PCR Influenza A subtyping kit donated by the US CDC.\n\nFrequencies and proportions of SARI patients were calculated by demographic characteristics, comorbidities (some patients had more than one), and clinical presentation. To portray the seasonal distribution of the different etiologic pathogens, the weekly case count by pathogen is depicted graphically for each pathogen, and the proportion of SARI patients who were diagnosed with each pathogen was calculated for each month.\n\nWe used a case-test negative design to estimate the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination within the past year.[9] An odds ratio (OR) was calculated comparing the odds of being positive for influenza among those with and without a prior seasonal influenza vaccination. This odds ratio was calculated separately for the A/H1pdm09 and A/H3 strains, along with any influenza virus strain. The reference controls (\u201ctest negatives\u201d) were those SARI cases who were not positive for any influenza virus. Many patients had an unknown vaccination status. As a sensitivity analysis, the OR was calculated three separate ways: not including any patient with unknown vaccination status, and then including vaccination unknowns into either the vaccinated or unvaccinated group. The OR was estimated using a logistic regression model that also controlled for sex and age and was limited to individuals \u22651 year of age.\n\nThe dataset was analyzed in SPSS version 20 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).\n\nData were de-identified prior to analysis. Because the analysis was part of regular public health surveillance activities, it was deemed exempt from ethical oversight by the Georgia NCDC Institutional Review Board.\n\nThe number of reported SARI cases peaked in the month of February (29%; 466/1624), of which 49% (227/466) tested positive for influenza (Table 2). Although influenza A predominated earlier in the year, by March, influenza B was more common (present in 9% [15/171] of patients, versus 6% [11/171] of those with A/H1pdm09 and 2% [3/171] of those with A/H3). The most commonly identified pathogen in SARI patients was RSV in March (31%, 37/86) through May (24%, 6/25) and rhinovirus in June (28%, 13/46) through November (30%, 26/88). By December, influenza A/H3 was the most commonly identified pathogen, present in 30% (75/250) of patients. Patients with no identifiable pathogen, e.g. who were not positive for influenza or any of the pathogens in the multiplex test, were relatively common in the summer and early fall, comprising the majority of patients in August (69%, 11/16) and September (52%, 15/29).\n\nOverall, influenza was common in the initial weeks of the year, with A/H1pdm09 dominating in the 2015\u20132016 season, and A/H3 dominating in the 2016\u20132017 season (Fig 1). The number of influenza cases was also much higher in the 2015\u20132016 season than the 2016\u20132017 season (Fig 1). Parainfluenza was more common before the rapid increase in influenza cases, and coronavirus showed a less distinct seasonal pattern, with some cases apparent throughout the year, even in the summer. RSV was more common later in the spring when the number of influenza cases declined.\n\nFever, cough, and breathing difficulty were the most common symptoms in SARI cases; fever and cough are included in the SARI case definition (Table 1). Overall, 75% (1,213/1,624) of SARI cases had breathing difficulty, especially in those with human metapneumovirus (93%, 37/40), adenovirus (80%, 67/82), rhinovirus (80%, 156/193), and influenza A/H3 (80%, 107/133) infections. Clinical outcomes associated with disease severity, including hospitalization in an ICU and artificial ventilation, followed similar patterns: hospitalization in an ICU was highest among those with human metapneumovirus (50%, 20/40) and influenza A/H1pdm09 (44%, 144/327); it was relatively low among those with adenovirus (26%, 22/82). Artificial ventilation was more common in those with influenza A/H1pdm09 (18%, 58/328), human metapneumovirus (15%, 6/40), influenza A/H3 (13%, 18/133), and parainfluenzavirus (12%, 9/72), and less than 10% for those with other infections.\n\nAmong the 14 individuals who died, 4 had influenza A/H3, 2 had influenza A/H1pdm09, 2 had rhinovirus, 2 had adenovirus, 1 had coronavirus 63, and 3 were negative for all pathogens tested for. No co-infections were identified among these individuals.\n\nA very small proportion of SARI cases reported influenza vaccination (1%; 20/1624) for the given season and 12% (206/1624) of cases reported unknown vaccination status. No individual with influenza B infection reported prior vaccination. The odds of being an influenza case compared to being a SARI case that did not have influenza varied by influenza strain and by how those with unknown vaccination status were categorized (Fig 2). For influenza A/H3, vaccination was associated with higher odds of influenza when excluding SARI cases with unknown vaccination status (OR: 5.47, 95% CI: 2.11, 14.18) or by combining those who were vaccinated with the unknown vaccination status group (OR: 7.11, 95% CI: 2.76, 18.29). The opposite trend, a protective association between vaccination and disease status was observed when cases with unknown vaccination status were combined with those who were known to be unvaccinated (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.97).\n\nAlthough we had a case definition of SARI established by the WHO, physicians reporting cases into the surveillance system did include a small number of cases who did not meet all symptom criteria. It is not clear how representative these findings are of SARI for the whole of Georgia. A longitudinal study in England estimated that only 5% of symptomatic influenza cases are medically attended and reported into the surveillance system.[3] Nonetheless, we are able to provide information over two influenza seasons (2015\u20132016 and 2016\u20132017) from a sentinel surveillance system which captures individuals throughout the country of Georgia. Additionally, we attempted to model the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine through a case-test negative design, however, we did not have the statistical power to test this by year. Overall, this study employed a rigorous sampling methodology and was able to enroll individuals throughout Georgia to describe the characteristics of SARI patients within the country.\n\nContinued strengthening of sentinel surveillance networks at the country and regional-levels is important to help shape policy and programmatic response to SARI activity while also keeping the public and media informed. Multi-pathogen diagnostic testing as part of Georgia\u2019s SARI sentinel surveillance allows for in-depth understanding of SARI by specific etiology, seasonality of pathogens and case distribution by age. Influenza was a predominant infection associated with more severe outcomes, but the majority of the population studied was unvaccinated. The findings from this sentinel surveillance system can assist in improving preparedness for severe respiratory illness epidemics throughout the year and guide influenza vaccination policies for Georgia."}
