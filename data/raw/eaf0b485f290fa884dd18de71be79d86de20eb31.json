{"title": "Public Exposure to Live Animals, Behavioural Change, and Support in Containment Measures in response to COVID-19 Outbreak: a population-based cross sectional survey in China", "body": "In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we aimed to investigate behavioural change on exposure to live animals before and during the outbreak, and public support and confidence for governmental containment measures.\n\nA population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled. Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities.\n\nProportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119/510) in Wuhan and 20.4%\n\n(102/501) in Shanghai. During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p<0\u00b7001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p<0\u00b7001). Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2%\n\n(52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p<0\u00b7001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p<0\u00b7001). 79.0%\n\n(403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P<0.001). 95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures. Females and the more educated were more supportive for the above containment measures.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We identified 179 studies, most of which are research on clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. To date there is no primary research to quantify public behavioural response and support in containment measures in response to the outbreak.\n\nOnly four commentaries mentioned the influence of the outbreak on mental health. One commentary introduced the habit of consuming wild animal products in China. Another commentary briefly introduced isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment as public health measures in the outbreak. The Chinese government has introduced a series of strict containment measures, and societal acceptability of these measure is important for effective and sustained response.\n\nEvidence is urgently needed to help policy makers understand public response to the outbreak and support for the containment measures, but no evidence available to date.\n\nWe conducted a population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random digital dialing in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020.\n\nTo date, this is the only few analyses on behavioural response to the outbreak and societal acceptability of governmental containment measures, which has been listed as the current priority of China CDC. We provide an assessment of behavioural change on exposure to live animals during the outbreak, by comparison before and during the outbreak, and between two cities with diverse exposure intensities to COVID-19. We also provide evidence on public support in governmental containment measures, including strict regulation on wet markets to reduce animal-to-human transmission and city quarantine All rights reserved.

The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and significantly reduced exposure to live animals and stopped wild animal consumption, especially in Wuhan. They were very supportive of governmental containment measures. With high public support, wet markets should be better regulated, and healthy diets, including changing the traditional habit of eating wild animal products, should be promoted. This can inform policy makers in China and other countries to implement and adjust containment strategies in response to the outbreak in the future.\n\nEarly in December 2019, several pneumonia cases caused by the novel coronavirus (now known as were first reported in Wuhan city, China. [1] [2] [3] The majority of the earliest cases were epidemiologically traced to the local Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Wholesale Market, where some wild animals were sold. [1] [2] [3] [4] On Jan 26, novel coronavirus was detected in environmental samples from this market by China CDC, suggesting that the virus possibly originated in wild animals sold in the market. [3] [4] This pathogenic virus has been identified as a new strain of coronavirus, which is in the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). [4] [5] The COVID-19 outbreak was declared by World Health Organization as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on Jan 30, 2020. 6 As of Feb 16, 2020, a total of 70,548 cases have been reported in mainland China, with 1,770 resulting deaths. 7 The outbreak has now spread beyond China to twenty-five other countries. 8 The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were proven to have originated from wild animals. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The COVID-19 is also likely to have a zoonotic origin. The practice of consuming wild animal products in China dates back to prehistoric times and persists into today. 9 Trade and consumption of wild animals were not well regulated even after SARS. Until the amendment of Wild Animal Protection Act in 2016, the prohibition was firstly added, but only for a short list of the nationally protected animals. Previous studies explored population exposure to live poultry in China, [15] [16] [17] but information on exposure to wild animals is limited.\n\nIn the efforts to contain the spread of the virus, the Chinese government introduced a series of All rights reserved.

Furthermore, Wuhan city has been quarantined to stop human-to-human transmission: starting on Jan 23, 2020, public transportation in Wuhan was closed, and all flights and trains leaving from Wuhan were cancelled.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent containment measures to lower the zoonotic virus transmission offer a unique opportunity to reassess the exposure to live animals, demand for wild animal consumption, and public readiness to further regulate wet markets. In this study, we aim to investigate behaviour patterns of population interaction to live animals, with a particular focus on differences before and during the outbreak, between Wuhan and Shanghai representing diverse exposure intensities to COVID-19. We also seek to understand levels of public support for containment measures and public confidence in their effectiveness to quell the outbreak. This study will help to clarify the public's response to the outbreak and has important policy implications regarding the social acceptability of infection containment measures and their application in different contexts.\n\nA population-based cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted in Wuhan and Shanghai between Feb 1 and 10, 2020, one month since the outbreak. These two cities were selected to represent diverse exposure intensities to COVID-19. Wuhan is the site of origin of the COVID-19 outbreak. Shanghai was selected due to its status as a city that has been significantly affected by imported COVID-19 cases All rights reserved.

The first imported case was confirmed in Shanghai on Jan 20. During the period of our survey, the number of confirmed cases rose rapidly in Wuhan, from 4,109 to 18,454, but maintained low epidemic rates in Shanghai, with reported cases rising from 182 to 303. Figure 1 illustrates the timeline of the outbreak progression and containment measures. This provides an opportunity to assess and compare public behavioural response and support for containment measures during the outbreak between two cities with different exposure intensities.\n\nThe sample size (n=500 for each city) is sufficient to estimate the change of outcomes (p=0.5) with a margin of error of 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval, according to previous studies. [15] [16] Our target population was persons aged 18 or over who had been living in the selected city for at least 6 months in the year prior to the survey and were current residents at the time of the survey. In each city, the telephone survey was conducted through a computer-assisted interviewing system, which enabled the random generation of mobile phone numbers and systematic data collection. We attempted to contact each generated number three times a day at different hours; if no contact was established after the third call, this number was classified as invalid or unreachable. Random dials with proportional quota sampling were used to ensure that respondents were demographically representative of the general population in each city, with quotas based on sex and age. 19\n\nThe outcomes of interest we studied were exposure to live animals before and during the COVID-19 outbreak, public support for containment measures that aim to reduce population exposure to live animals and human transmission, and confidence in these measures to quell the outbreak.

To measure behavioural change during the outbreak, each respondent was asked to report exposing behaviours both (1) prior to the outbreak: before Dec 31, 2019 when COVID-19 cases were first released by Wuhan Health Commission and (2) since the outbreak, between Jan 1 to Feb 10, 2020. For live animal consumption habits, where behaviour change cannot be measured in a short period of time, we assessed people's intention to: 1) buy live poultry or wild animals, and eat wild animal products (continue to buy/eat as usual, buy/eat less, not buy/eat any more) and 2) continue raising pets and touching stray animals (continue to raise/touch as usual, temporarily not during the outbreak, try or resolutely not even after the outbreak).\n\nWe measured public support for two types of governmental containment measures in response to the outbreak; one is regulation on wet markets to reduce population exposure to live animals, and the other is quarantining measures meant to reduce human transmission, such as the closure of public transportation in Wuhan and the cancellation of flights and trains leaving from Wuhan. Each respondent was asked to rate the extent, on a five-point Likert scale, to which they supported 1) the permanent closure of LPMs, 2) a ban on the wild animal trade, and 3) the quarantining of Wuhan; respondents were also asked to report the extent of their confidence in the effectiveness of these measures to quell the outbreak.\n\nCharacteristics of respondents, including gender, age, marital status, education, income, and All rights reserved.

We also collected the history of fever or cough symptoms for respondents and their relatives or friends in the two weeks prior to the survey, and whether there were confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases in the neighbourhood in which they live.\n\nEach respondent was also asked at what point they started paying attention to this outbreak.\n\nThe survey questionnaire was adjusted according to an instrument used during the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 20-21 and influenza A(H7N9) in 2013. 15 The survey instrument was pretested for face and content validity, length, and understandability by the public before our survey was administered.\n\nDescriptive and univariate analysis were used to investigate changes in exposure to live animals during the outbreak, public support for containment measures, and confidence in containment measures to quell the outbreak, between Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases).\n\nChi-square tests or fisher's exact tests (when applicable) were used to compare differences in these measures between the two cities, and before and during the outbreak. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate factors associated with public support for containment measures and confidence in intervention effectiveness. The proportion and Odds Ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).\n\nA total of 18,576 telephone numbers were randomly selected via digital dialing system in Wuhan and Shanghai.

In total, 510 respondents in Wuhan and 501 respondents in Shanghai completed the interview, and the overall response rate was 14.8%\n\n(1,011/6,836) (Appendix Figure 1 ).\n\nRespondents in Wuhan and Shanghai were generally similar in terms of sex, marital status and occupation, but in Shanghai respondents tended to be older and had higher education and income levels than in Wuhan (Table 1 ). Our sample was consistent with characteristics of the general population in the two cities, as Shanghai is more developed and has an older population than Wuhan. Expectedly, respondents in Wuhan were much more intensely exposed to the COVID-19 outbreak and paid attention to the outbreak earlier than those in Shanghai.\n\nWe first investigated patterns of usual exposure to live animals before the outbreak ( Table 2 Panel of 55, 58.2% in Shanghai, p=0.339); more than 90% of respondents always arranged for slaughter of purchased animals in wet markets, with no noticeable differences between the two cities. However, residents in Wuhan reported wild animal consumption at a higher rate than those in Shanghai; 47 (9.2%) of 510 respondents in Wuhan and 23 (4.6%) of 501 respondents in Shanghai reported eating All rights reserved.

We found that respondents dramatically reduced exposure to live animals during the outbreak, with respondents in Wuhan changing their exposure much more significantly than in Shanghai. Specifically, the frequency of visiting LPMs decreased from 23.3% (n=119) to 3.1% (n=16)\n\nin Wuhan (p<0\u00b7001), and from 20.4% (n=102) to 4.4%(n=22) in Shanghai (p<0\u00b7001; Figure 2 ). The proportion of respondents buying live poultry or wild animals also decreased from around 11.0% to 2.6% in both cities (p<0\u00b7001). We also asked whether respondents intended to change their habit of buying live poultry or wild animals since the outbreak among those exposing to live animals at usual ( (4/55) of respondents in Wuhan and 25.5% (14/55) in Shanghai stated they would continue to buy these products as usual.\n\nThe proportion of respondents consuming wild animals declined significantly, 10.2%(n=52) to 0.6%(n=3) in Wuhan (p<0\u00b7001) and 5.2%(n=26) to 0.8%(n=4) in Shanghai (p<0\u00b7001) (Figure 2 ).

Table 3 presents socio-demographic factors associated with public support for the governmental containment measures implemented (i.e. closure of LPMs, banning the wild animal trade, and city quarantine) and confidence in the effectiveness of governmental response. There was evidence that females were more supportive towards all three containment measures and that there was a positive association between education level and the likelihood of supporting regulations on wet markets and trade of wild animals.

We did not find any difference in population profiles of those who support Wuhan quarantine or show confidence in the effectiveness of governmental response.\n\nThis study is the first to investigate behavioural changes of exposure to live animals during the COVID-19 outbreak, and public support for governmental containment measures in response to the outbreak. We found that population exposures to live animals were similar in Wuhan and Shanghai before the outbreak, except that wild animal consumption was more prevalent in Wuhan than in Shanghai. During the outbreak, residents in both cities significantly changed their behaviours and reduced exposures to live animals, and such changes were much more significant in Wuhan. Most respondents supported governmental containment measures implemented, and three in four had confidence on the effectiveness of these measures. Male, the less educated and those exposing to live animals at usual were less likely to support containment measures.\n\nIn our survey, more than 20% of respondents visited wet markets at usual, which was similar in Wuhan and Shanghai, despite Shanghai being much more developed. Compared with the 30% level reported in 2013 in the same study sites, 15 the share of respondents visiting wet markets declined by 10 percentage points, but was still high. 10% of respondents consumed products of wild animals in Wuhan, twice that reported in Shanghai. In China, there exists a long tradition of eating the meat and products of wild animals, which persists into modern times due to a false but commonly held belief that these products All rights reserved.

[22] [23] These beliefs and preferences for fresh food are especially popular in southern China, where Wuhan is located, but were greatly challenged and changed during the 2003 SARS outbreak in China 9,12 . However, these practices have become popular again in recent years, due in part to the popularity of social media influencers who broadcast themselves eating wild animal products on livestream platforms. 22 The revival of this tradition may have set the socio-biological context for the occurrence and spread of COVID-19 in China.\n\nWe found that respondents' risks of exposure to live animals declined significantly, reaching a very low level, and most respondents stopped wild animal consumption after this outbreak, especially in Wuhan.\n\nThis indicates that the public responded quickly and adequately to the outbreak. In the survey, all respondents cared about the outbreak, and about one in five respondents in Wuhan reported starting to pay attention before Dec 31, 2019. The outbreak gradually gained intense nationwide attention, 24 and a series of policies were implemented by the Chinese government to contain the outbreak. As of Jan 30, all provinces had initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies. [25] [26] These actions raised public attention further and induced significant behavioural changes. A national online survey on Jan 26 showed that the vast majority of people knew of the disease and related preventive measures, 66.5% reported that they would wear masks when outside their home, and 80% cancelled travel plans during the Spring Festival due to the outbreak. 27 The findings from both this survey and ours demonstrate behavioural change in terms of exposure to live animals or daily protection.\n\nIn addition, more strict regulations were implemented on wet markets to lower the risk of disease transmission. Wuhan instituted prohibited the sale of live poultry and wild animals starting on Jan 22. All rights reserved.

The Chinese Government further instituted nationwide bans on all forms of wild animal transactions on Jan 26. 28 These regulations may accelerate the decrease in exposing behaviours to live animals. However, the COVID-19 epidemic occurred prior to the Chinese lunar new year, when the demand for live animals is generally high. 23 This may produce a conflict between the public demand for live animals and regulations. Fortunately, we found that the public strongly supports the regulations on wet markets to control the outbreak.\n\nAlthough permanent closure of LPMs was not fully backed by the public, it was still much higher than reported during the 2013 influenza A outbreak (27.3% in Wuhan, 39.3% in Shanghai). 15, 29 The strong support for this policy offers a great opportunity to improve regulations on wet markets and change the prevalent habit of eating wild animal products in China.\n\nWe believe that the keys to quelling outbreaks of zoonotic viral diseases such as COVID-19 and preventing future outbreaks are changing the false beliefs and dangerous habits regarding eating wild animal products and strengthening regulations on wet markets. Firstly, healthy diets need to be vigorously promoted in China. Health China 2030 promotes healthy diets, but does not discuss the risks of eating wild animals. We also believe the internet and social media can be an effective channel to promote healthy eating habits and reduce the inappropriate and outdated tradition of eating wild animal products. 25, 30 Since the outbreak, spontaneous initiatives have emerged on the internet to explain the risks of and resist consuming wild animals. Secondly, live animal transactions should be more strictly regulated, and wild animal transactions should be even prohibited in the long term. While different animals should be sold separately in specific wet markets to lower risks of virus transmission, in practice, various kinds of live animals are sold together within one market, as found in Huanan Seafood All rights reserved.

Laws should be strengthened to regulate and implement the strict separation of live animals from general markets. With the currently high public support, bans on the wild animal trade should be promoted, but the government must be aware of the risk of creating an unregulated black market by instituting a ban. For live poultry and non-wild animals, better regulations may be a better option than bans without the full support of the public. 23 The feasible measures include seasonal closure of wet markets, regular rest days, and banning leaving live animals in markets overnight. 10, 15 The above measures should be given priority in China and other countries to reduce current levels of COVID-19, as well as future threats from zoonotic diseases.\n\nOur study has several limitations. First, there may be recall bias. We aimed to identify behavioral changes in a cross-sectional survey, and outcomes before the outbreak were measured based on participant recall. Second, our results may be affected by selection bias from telephone survey. We did attempt multiple calls to unanswered numbers to mitigate this bias, and quota sampling was introduced to get a representative sample. The anonymous phone interview addressed the concern of response bias due to fear of being seen as criticizing the government. Third, a cross-sectional design prevents us from assessing how long the effect on behavioral/intention change demonstrated in this study will last, when the outbreak is no longer fresh in people's minds. Thus, we plan to conduct a second-round survey at the end of the outbreak to track the long-term changes.\n\nIn conclusion, exposure to live animals was common before the COVID-19 outbreak. The public responded quickly to this outbreak, and significantly reduced their exposure to live animals and stopped wild animal consumption, especially in Wuhan.
