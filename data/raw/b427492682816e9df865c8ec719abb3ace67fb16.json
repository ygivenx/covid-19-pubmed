{"title": "Supporting Information Survivability, partitioning, and recovery of enveloped viruses in untreated municipal wastewater", "body": "Optimization of Ultrafiltration Method. A higher MHV recovery was achieved when the wastewater solids removal step was carried out with filtration through 0.22 \u00b5m PES membranes rather than centrifugation at 30,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min (P = 0.0046; Figure S3A ). Employing 10 kDa ultra-filters for the concentration step resulted in higher and more consistent MHV recoveries compared to 100-kDa ultra-filters ( Figure S3B ). In comparison, the specific solids-removal techniques and the 10 kDa versus 100 kDa filter sizes did not impact the MS2 recoveries.\n\nFollowing ultra-filter regeneration, the mean recovery of MHV decreased and the mean recovery of MS2 increased, although neither change was significant (P = 0.2444; Figure S3B ).\n\nWhen solids were collected from the wastewater with centrifugation at 30,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min., the extraction solution consisting of pH 9.5 glycine buffer resulted in the highest recovery of MHV (3.7% of spiked MHV; Figure S3C ) from the wastewater solids; this recovery was low considering that nearly a quarter of spiked MHV were reversibly adsorbed to solids after incubating for one-hour, and therefore should have been recoverable. The limited recovery may be due to viruses losing infectivity as they are detached from the soil surface, as reported elsewhere. 1 MS2 recoveries were ~2% for all of the tested extraction solutions; this was not surprising based on the low percentage (6%) of MS2 associated with the wastewater solids at equilibrium.
