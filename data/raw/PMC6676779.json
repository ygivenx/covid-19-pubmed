{"title": "Strengthening laboratory capacity for detection of respiratory viral pathogens through the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) framework", "body": "Acute respiratory infections have threatened public health for decades.1,2,3,4 In 2003, when severe acute respiratory syndrome emerged out of Hong Kong, it illustrated the speed with which respiratory pathogens could spread globally as well as their potential for worldwide economic impact.5 Two respiratory viruses have recently emerged as public health threats: influenza A/H7N9 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.6,7 According to the International Health Regulations established by the World Health Organization (WHO), countries should develop capacities for timely detection and rapid public health response to emerging and re-emerging threats, and these capacities rely in part on a robust public health laboratory system.8\n\nThe Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) (www.ghsagenda.org) is a partnership of countries and international organisations launched in 2014 to strengthen global capacity to detect, prevent and respond to disease threats that occur naturally, accidentally or deliberately. One of GHSA\u2019s primary areas of focus, known as an \u2018action package\u2019, is an emphasis on strengthening national laboratory systems (Action Package: Detect 1).9 Through this action package, GHSA enables countries to enhance real-time bio-surveillance and ensure that laboratories are capable of safe, accurate detection and characterisation of epidemic-prone pathogens, including both known and novel threats.9 In order for public health laboratories to prepare for outbreaks and emerging pandemic threats, they should demonstrate ongoing capacities for routine diagnostics.\n\nFor almost a decade, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Influenza Division has developed laboratory capacity for seasonal influenza virus and pandemic influenza preparedness. As a WHO collaborating center, CDC provides technical assistance for influenza testing in a network of global laboratories, known as National Influenza Centers (NICs), which have functional links to their assigned WHO reference laboratory and access to quality assured reagents from the CDC Influenza Division through the International Reagent Resource (IRR) (https://www.internationalreagentresource.org). The NICs often have standardised, state-of-the-art equipment, in addition to well-trained molecular biologists. Specimens for routine testing at NICs are received from influenza surveillance sites that include regional hospitals and clinics using the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) or influenza-like illness case definitions. Frequently, SARI and influenza-like illness sentinel systems are models of successful surveillance in resource-limited countries where epidemiologic data are linked to specimen collection and laboratory testing.10 An opportunity exists to expand the existing surveillance systems at NICs in GHSA countries by expanding testing capacity for other priority agents.\n\nAccordingly, as a part of the GHSA, the United States CDC strengthened and expanded its existing capacity to test for respiratory viral pathogens in laboratories of select countries (Table 1). These activities, detailed below, can serve as a model for other countries with NICs and laboratories with moderate technical capabilities that are looking to expand their capacities beyond influenza.\n\nThis article followed all ethical standards for a research without direct contact with human or animal subjects.\n\nQuality assured reagents are essential for accuracy in diagnostic testing. In addition, a reliable method for procurement and distribution of available reagents is necessary to order and receive laboratory materials, particularly when many of the reagents are temperature sensitive. Utilising GHSA funds, the online reagent portal, the IRR, was expanded to include 14 new custom products including the FTD33 kit, the CDC-developed respiratory virus rRT-PCR assay kits and controls, as well as ancillary commercial products such as rRT-PCR enzyme kits and specimen extraction kits required to run the CDC respiratory virus rRT-PCR assays. The IRR is a programme established by CDC to provide registered users with various reagents and information for the study and detection of influenza virus. It was chosen as the delivery mechanism for these reagents, because the selected laboratories for GHSA were already using or in the process of being approved to use the IRR for the purpose of WHO influenza surveillance, eliminating the need to establish a new or duplicative reagent distribution plan.\n\nIn addition to enhancing laboratory capacity through the availability of quality reagents, CDC has enhanced its technical capacity through partnerships to conduct workforce training. Working with the Association of Public Health Laboratories, laboratory training took place in Atlanta in July of 2016. Nine countries participated and were trained in the expanded respiratory viral pathogen detection, including Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Pakistan, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania and Vietnam. The Pasteur Institute of Paris, France, conducted similar laboratory training in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, in April 2017 with representatives from Benin, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Togo. Table 1 lists countries that have received training up to December 2017.\n\nThe training curriculum included lectures from subject matter experts and hands-on laboratory exercises in order to familiarise attendees with the CDC rRT-PCR assays and the use of the FTD33. Didactic lectures covered a range of topics including an overview of respiratory viruses, quality assurance and biosafety guidelines, setting up a molecular diagnostics laboratory, and performing rRT-PCR assays on human clinical respiratory specimens. The hands-on exercises covered total nucleic acid isolation from clinical respiratory specimens, setting up rRT-PCR reactions for CDC singleplex and FTD33 multiplex assays, as well as analysis of the rRT-PCR data. Laboratory subject matter experts from CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories guided participants through the exercises ensuring everyone followed proper techniques. The specimens used for training were mock respiratory specimens spiked with inactivated respiratory viruses. By pre-characterising these specimens with the CDC respiratory virus panel, the participants\u2019 results could be used as a metric for successful learning.\n\nIn order to test each country\u2019s laboratory capabilities and availability of reagents following the training, CDC is preparing to provide laboratories with external quality assessment panels. These panels, produced by Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (http://www.qcmd.org), enable laboratories to process and test proficiency samples using the same protocol they use for clinical specimens. The results will be reported back to Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics for scoring and the compilation of performance reports. Confidential individual reports will be returned to the respective laboratories. Based on their individual performances, CDC may recommend additional training and technical support, if necessary. For laboratories expanding their viral testing capacity, the availability of external quality assessment panels ensures quality performance.\n\nThe GHSA measures its success according to metrics defined by the WHO\u2019s Joint External Evaluation tool.18 In the arena of national laboratory systems, two of these indicators include the capacity for the detection of priority diseases, as well as for effective and modern diagnostics. The training and materials provided through CDC\u2019s engagement in GHSA laboratory strengthening has provided tools and building blocks to more than one-third of all GHSA countries to more readily achieve their goals in laboratory capacity. Data generated from expanded testing will allow for a more complete understanding of the burden of disease in their country. A routine system of collection, transportation, testing and results sharing in a quality assured environment will enable the public health system to respond to outbreaks when they occur."}
