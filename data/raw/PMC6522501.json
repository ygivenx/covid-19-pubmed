{"title": "Mortality due to Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii in low-income settings: an autopsy study", "body": "Cryptococcosis is the leading cause of meningitis in adults living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa1,2. In 2008, the number of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) cases in this region was estimated to be 720,000 (range 144,000\u20131.3 million)3. Recent estimates from 2014 indicate that over 160,000 (95%CI 113,600\u2013193,900) cases of CM, including more than 130,000 deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa4. This significant decrease in the absolute number of cases from 2008 to 2014 seems to be related to the scale-up of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART)5. However, the proportion of AIDS-related deaths due to Cryptococcus remains similar (around 15%), representing the second most common cause of AIDS-related mortality in adults, after tuberculosis4. Cryptococcal infection is believed to be acquired by inhalation of fungal cells from the environment. In immunocompetent hosts, the pathogen can be cleared or establish a latent infection6. In immunocompromised patients, Cryptococcus may induce pneumonia and its dissemination to the central nervous system (CNS) causes meningitis, the most severe form of the infection, which is fatal without appropriate treatment. In low income countries, the one-year mortality of CM, even in HIV-infected patients in care, has been estimated to be as high as 70%4.\n\nHuman cryptococcal infections were traditionally attributed to Cryptococcus neoformans until Cryptococcus gattii was classified as a distinct species by molecular methods in 20027. Cryptococcus gattii is further divided into four molecular types (variety gattii; VGI-VGIV) and little is known about C.gatti infections in Africa, where this pathogen has been isolated from both clinical and environmental samples8. Most VGIV strains have been described in the southern part of Africa, whereas VGI and VGII strains have been reported in central Africa8. C. gattii infections were thought to occur mainly in the tropics9 until 2004, when an outbreak of C. gattii in North America was recognized10. This outbreak was caused by VGII strains and included the emergence of hypervirulent variants11. Current knowledge on the epidemiology and clinical presentation of C. neoformans infection is clearly greater than that related to C. gattii. C. neoformans infections occur predominantly in people infected with HIV or with other immunocompromising conditions, whereas C. gattii infections have been mainly described in apparently immunocompetent patients9. Autopsy findings reveal that the CNS and the lungs are the organs most frequently affected in disseminated infections12,13, which may also affect multiple organs, especially in HIV-infected patients14. However, reported autopsy series do not usually include cryptococcal species identification, and therefore, knowledge regarding the histopathology of C. gattii remains limited.\n\nIn the present study, we determined the Cryptococcus-associated mortality of a series of 284 autopsies performed in two hospitals located in high prevalence HIV areas, Mozambique in sub-Saharan Africa and the Brazilian Amazonia. We also analysed the clinical presentation, management, and histopathological and microbiological findings of 17 cases of fatal cryptococcal infection.\n\nAn observational study was performed at the Department of Pathology of the Maputo Central Hospital in Maputo, Mozambique and at the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado, in Manaus, Western Brazilian Amazon. The study was approved by the Comiss\u00e3o Nacional de \u00c9tica em Pesquisa - CONEP (Brazil; Ref. 1.074.304), the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (Spain; File 2013/8677) and National Bioethics Committee of Mozambique (Mozambique; Ref. 342/CNBS/13), which deemed verbal consent sufficient in this study. All research was performed in accordance with guidelines and regulations of the Montreal Statement on Research Integrity in Cross-Boundary Research Collaborations, and the Singapore Statement on Research Integrity.\n\nFrom November 2013 to March 2015, complete diagnostic autopsies (CDAs) were performed in 284 deceased patients in the two study sites. Two hundred twenty-three cases were recruited from Mozambique: 169 were adults over 15 years of age (112 women, 57 of whom were maternal deaths, i. e., women dying during pregnancy, partum, post-partum or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy15), and 54 were children from 1 month to 15 years of age (37 males and 17 females). Sixty-one cases were recruited from Brazil: 59 adults (38 males and 21 females, including one maternal death) and two children. A description of the study design and inclusion criteria for the cases has been published elsewhere16\u201318. All cases fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included in the study; these were (1) a CDA requested by the clinician as part of the medical evaluation of the patient and; (2) a verbal informed consent to perform the autopsy given by the relatives. Traumatic deaths were excluded. A member of the study staff was tasked with liaising with the families in cases of deaths occurring in the pediatric department, but only after the clinicians had asked for consent for postmortem examination17. All the clinical records available regarding admission preceding death of each patient were reviewed and the clinical data were collected in a standardized manner.\n\nThe autopsy procedures and a description of the pathological and microbiological methods used have been reported elsewhere19,20 and for Briefly, samples of blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bone marrow and key organs such as the liver, lungs, CNS, spleen and kidneys, as well as uterus in all women of reproductive age were collected for histopathological and microbiological analysis. The microbiological methods included universal screening for relevant pathogens (e.g. HIV, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis, malaria) and bacterial/fungal culture of autopsy samples, targeted screening depending on the patient\u2019s condition (i.e. screening for Cryptococcus, Toxoplasma gondii and Pneumocystis jirovecii in HIV-infected cases), and additional specific testing according to the histopathological findings. Following the analysis of the CDA samples, a panel composed of a pathologist, a microbiologist, and a clinician with expertise in infectious diseases and epidemiology evaluated all the data (including the clinical information) and assigned the final cause of death.\n\nAll cases in which the cause of death was assigned to a cryptococcal infection were further characterized. The histological evaluation included periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining (PAS) of the samples of both lungs, CNS, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney and uterus, as well as Grocott-Gomorimethenamine silver staining in all CNS samples. Microbiological evaluation included a specific real time PCR for Cryptococcus spp.21, which was performed in the samples of both lungs, CNS, bone marrow, spleen, liver and uterus. PCR cycle threshold values >38 were considered negative. Plasma and CSF samples were tested by both real time PCR and the Cryptococcus antigen (CrAg) lateral flow assay (LFA) (IMMY Inc., Norman, Oklahoma). Discrimination between C. neoformans var. grubii, C. neoformans var. neoformans, and C. gattii was achieved by amplification of the rRNA intergenic spacer (IGS) region, followed by forward and reverse Sanger sequencing of the amplicons. Identities of the cryptococcal species were assigned based on a >98% match to the IGS sequence of a Cryptococcus reference strain (C. gattii: CBS 6289, ATCC MYA-4561, CBS 6955, ATCC MYA-4563; C. neoformans var. grubii: ATCC MYA-4564, ATCC MYA-4565 and C. neoformans var. neoformans: ATCC MYA-4567) as described previously22.\n\nCryptococcal strains isolated from the cultures of the autopsy samples underwent a consensus multi-locus sequence typing scheme for C. neoformans and C. gattii23. In addition, the sero-mating type of these strains was determined by multiplex PCR as described previously24,25. An anti-fungogram was performed for each strain using the Sensititre\u00ae YeastOne\u00ae susceptibility plate (TREK Diagnostic Systems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Oakwood Village, USA).\n\nDescriptive analysis was performed using univariate statistics with means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequency distributions for categorical variables. All analyses, data manipulation, and implementations were done using Stata MP version 15 (Stata, College Station, TX, USA).\n\nAmong the 284 deceased patients included in this study, 163 (57%) tested positive for HIV, and a total of 17 (6%) fatal cryptococcal infections were confirmed in the CDA. All the deaths except one occurred in HIV-infected cases. Among the HIV-infected cases, cryptococcosis was responsible for 16 deaths (10%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6\u201315%). Among the Mozambican adults, 109 out of 169 (64%) were HIV-infected, and 11 died of fatal cryptococcal infection (10%). Four of these cases were maternal deaths (three pregnant women and one in the puerperal period), accounting for 11% of the 36 maternal deaths occurring in HIV-infected women. None of the 17 HIV-positive children over one month of age had cryptococcal infection. Thirty-seven out of the 61 (61%) patients from Brazil were HIV-infected, and Cryptococcus was responsible for five of these deaths (13%). The only death caused by Cryptococcus in an HIV-negative patient occurred in a six-year-old child (infected with C. gattii).\n\nThe demographic features, HIV status, clinical presentation and management of the 17 patients with fatal cryptococcal infection are summarized in Table 1. The median age was 34 years (range 6\u201344 years); 11 cases (65%) were men. In 13 out of the 16 (81%) HIV-infected patients, a positive HIV test result was reported in the clinical records and was apparently unknown by the clinician in the other 3 cases. Four out of the 16 (25%) HIV-infected patients were on ART, but the duration of ART was only reported in one case.\n\nHeadache was the most common symptom (13 patients, 76%), followed by fever and vomiting (eight cases each, 47%). Upon admission to hospital, eight patients (47%) were confused and/or agitated, two patients (12%) were lethargic, and another two (12%) were fully comatose. Meningeal signs were detected in seven patients (41%). The mean time from admission to death was 9.3 days (95%CI: 2.4\u201316.2). Cryptococcal infection was considered the first clinical diagnostic option in only 4/17 (23%) of the confirmed cases, whereas it was included in the differential diagnosis in eight patients (47%). Antifungal treatment (fluconazole or Amphotericin B) had been prescribed to seven patients but to only five of the clinically suspected cases. Seven of the patients (41%) died within 72 hours of admission, and 12 out of the 16 HIV-positive patients (75%) died within one week of admission.\n\nThe clinical records of the remaining 267 cases included in this study were reviewed for clinical diagnosis of cryptococcal infection. Among these, three HIV-infected patients were clinically diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis, but no evidence of cryptococcal infection was found in the autopsy (the cause of death was identified as toxoplasmosis in two cases and tuberculosis in one case).\n\nTable 2 shows the final cause of death, the cryptococcal species, other associated diagnoses identified in the CDA, as well as the results of the PAS staining, Cryptococcus real time PCR and CrAg test in the different samples analysed. Identification of the cryptococcal species was successful in 15 out of the 17 cases. In two cases, the tissue samples provided insufficient DNA to perform IGS amplification and sequencing. Interestingly, among the 15 cases identified, five (33%) were C. gattii whereas the remaining cases (66.6%) were C. neoformans var. grubii.\n\nTwelve of the 17 cases (70%) were diagnosed as disseminated infections and the remaining 5(30%) as meningoencephalitis.The CNS was affected in all 17 cases. The following were the most affected organs (PAS and/or PCR positive): the lungs (88%), spleen (76%), liver (71%), bone marrow (59%) and kidney (47%). In addition, in five out of six (83%) deceased women, the pathogen was detected in uterus samples, and in one case it was detected in the placenta. Cryptococcus was found in more than 5 different samples in 11 patients (65% of the cases). More organs were affected in C. neoformans var. grubii than in C. gattii infections (mean of 6.2 vs. 2.8 organs positive by PAS staining), but no specific histopathological differences were observed between the two Cryptococcus species. Molecular testing expanded the detection of Cryptococcus in 14 additional tissues that were negative for PAS staining. In contrast, two tissue samples were positive for PAS staining but negative by real time PCR. Periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining and Grocott-Gomorimethenamine silver staining showed identical results. Representative histopathological images of different affected tissues are shown in Fig. 1. Cryptococcus was detected by PCR in CSF and plasma in 80% and 47% of the cases tested, respectively. All plasma and CSF samples tested for CrAg LFA were positive. Co-infections with other AIDS-related pathogens or AIDS-defining illnesses (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus, esophageal candidiasis, Toxoplasma gondii, and Histoplasma capsulatum) were detected in five cases.\n\nEight strains were isolated by culture, seven from the CSF and one from the blood. The molecular characterization and antifungal susceptibility of the cryptococcal strains isolated are shown in Table 3. All C. neoformans var. grubii corresponded to the VNI molecular type, whereas two different genotypes, VGI and VGIV, were identified in the two C. gattii isolates. Sero-mating type A\u03b1 was found in all the C. neoformans isolates. B\u03b1 and C\u03b1 strains were found among the C. gattii strains.\n\nMinimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of a variety of antifungal agents were determined (Table 3). All triazole antifungal agents (fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole and posaconazole) had MICs less than or equal to the defined epidemiological cut-off values (ECVs)26. One isolate showed a MIC to flucytosine (16 \u00b5g/mL), one dilution higher than the ECV (8 \u00b5g/mL). Although all the isolates presented a MIC \u2264 1 \u00b5g/mL to amphotericin, the MICs of three C. neoformans molecular type VNI (1 \u00b5g/mL) and two C. gattii (1 \u00b5g/mL) were one dilution higher than the defined ECVs (0.5 \u00b5g/mL)27.\n\nThe study protocol received approval of the National Mozambican Ethics Committee (ref.342/CNBS/13) and the Ethics Committee of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (Spain; approved, File 2013/8677). MIA and CDA procedures were only conducted after verbal informed consent was provided by the relatives."}
