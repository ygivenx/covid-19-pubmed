It is a common human pathogen that occurs worldwide with 60% to 95% of infection in adults, and is responsible for a broad range of human infectious diseases such as gingiva-stomatitis, keratitis, cutaneous herpes, genital herpes and encephalitis [17, 18] .\n\nHerpes simplex virus infections are usually managed with anti-viral drugs such as acyclovir, vidarabine and phosphonoformic acid [12] . However, undesirable complications and the emergence of drug-resistant virus strains necessitate the development of alternative agents for the management of HSV infections [7, 11] .\n\nChinese traditional knowledge and practices play an important role in the discovery and development of safe and effective drugs. Natural products remain a consistently successful source in drug discovery and may offer many opportunities to find anti-HSV drugs or lead compounds [5, 20] . A variety of natural products have been found effective on inhibiting unique enzymes and proteins crucial to the virus life cycle [2, 21] . acute infectious hepatitis, chronic nephritis, leukaemia, erythematous lupus, and neurodermatitis [4] .\n\nThe medicinal part of T. hypoglaucum is its roots with principal active components of alkaloids, terpenoids and tannins [10] . The content of total alkaloids in the root is about 1% which is obviously higher than in the stem.\n\nThe compounds purified from root methanol extracts, such as triptonine A, hypoglaunine A, hypoglaunine B and hyponine E, were reported to be active in anti-HIV virus [8] . A primary investigation was carried out on the treatment of viral keratitis with the preparation of T. hypoglaucum.\n\nIn this paper, the in vitro anti-HSV-1 activity of the total alkaloids extract from T. hypoglaucum was evaluated at the cellular and molecular level. [15] . Titer of the virus stock was 10 5.5 TCID 50 /mL.\n\nThe cytotoxicity of the total alkaloids extract on Vero cells was evaluated before antiviral activity assay by MTT method as described elsewhere [13] .\n\nBriefly, cells (2\u00d710 5 /mL) were seeded in a 96-well tissue culture plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% \n\nAntiviral activity of the total alkaloids extract was determined according to the inhibitory capacity against the viral cytopathic effect [24] . HSV-1 virus \n\nVero cells was measured in order to gauge antiviral selectivity by MTT assay after a 48 h of co-incubation with drug dilutions. The cytotoxic concentration that \n\nThe inhibition activity of the alkaloids extract from T. hypoglaucum against HSV-1 induced CPE was investigated and results are shown in Table 3 . The results indicate that the alkaloids extract possessed a potent inhibitory activity against HSV-1 with an IC 50 value of 6.5 \u03bcg/mL which was notably lower than that of Acyclovir (15.4 \u03bcg /mL).\n\nThe improved Antiviral activity of the alkaloids extract compared to Acyclovir was further confirmed by plaque inhibition assay. The results (Table 4) show that the extract significantly reduced the viral plaque formation at a low concentration of 6.25 \u03bcg/mL to 12.5 \u03bcg/mL with the plaque reduction ratio of 55% to 75% which was 35% higher than that of Acyclovir at the same concentration, and the inhibition activity showed an obvious dosage dependence.\n\nBefore \n\nBotanical extracts exhibit a wide spectrum of Cell viability (%, mean\u00b1S.D., n=3); others the same. biological and pharmacological properties, including cytoprotection, anticancer, anti-inflammation, immunomodulation and anti-infection [14, 22] . Such medicinal plants provide an important source for antiviral drug screening and development [6, 1, 9] .\n\nThe components of T. hypoglaucum are complex, but the main medicinal content in the root has been identified to comprise alkaloids. In this study, we found that cytotoxicity of the crude alkaloid extract was larger than for Acyclovir (ACV),with a TI of 7.17 compared to 54.63 for ACV (Table 3 ). This showed the drug safety of the crude alkaloids extract was less than ACV's. But the crude alkaloids extract displayed significant activity against HSV-1 and inhibited the proliferation of HSV-1 in Vero cells. Its IC 50 was lower than that of Acyclovir (Table 3) , and presented notably higher plaque reduction efficacy than Acyclovir at a concentration range of 6.25 to 12.5 \u03bcg/mL (Table 4) . RT-PCR assay further suggested the potent anti-HSV-1 activity.\n\nTheoretically, antiviral activity could take place at many different steps of the viral lifecycle, such as host invasion, genome transcription, DNA replication, particle assembly, virion maturation and expression.\n\nThus, through modern biological and chemical assays, the action mechanism may be well revealed. The functions of about half the HSV-1 coded proteins have been shown to be absolutely necessary for successful lifecycle [16] . Any one of these indispensable virus proteins identifies a possible target for antiviral intervention. The most successful antiviral directed against HSV to date is Acyclovir.\n\nAcyclovir interacts specifically and sequentially with the proteins coded by UL23 and UL30. Acyclovir is phosphorylated to its active form by the viral encoded thymidine kinase where it acts as a chain terminator of the viral DNA polymerase there by stopping any further viral replication [3, 23] .\n\nIn the present study, transcription levels of the 3 key genes UL30, UL39 and US6 were semi-quantified by RT-PCR assay (Fig. 2, Fig. 3 ). Under treatment with T.\n\nhypoglaucum alkaloids extract at a concentration of 12.5 \u03bcg/mL, the transcription of genes UL30, UL39 and US6 was significantly inhibited by an inhibition efficacy of 74.6% (UL30), 70.9% (UL39) and 62.6% (US6) respectively contrasted to virus control, which further confirmed the potent antiviral activity against HSV-1 replication though lower than that of Acyclovir. In conclusion, the total alkaloids extract of the medicinal plant T. hypoglaucum presented potent anti-HSV-1 activity and low cytotoxicity in Vero cells. It is worthwhile to do further works on the identification of potential active compounds and the investigation of action mechanism."}
