{"title": "Simian hemorrhagic fever virus: Recent advances", "body": "SHFV is a member of the family Arteriviridae that also includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) . A related virus, wobbly possum disease virus (WPDV), was recently identified (Dunowska, Biggs et al. 2012) .\n\nArterivirus genomes are positive-sense, single-stranded, polycistronic RNAs with a 5\u2032 type I cap and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tract (Snijder and Spaan 2006) . Among the arteriviruses, EAV has the shortest genome (12.7 kb) while SHFV has the longest (15.7 kb). The genome organization and replication strategies of arteriviruses are similar to those of coronaviruses. However, arterivirus genomes are about half the size of coronavirus genomes and the virions of the two virus groups also differ in their structural protein compositions, capsid types (coronaviruses-helical and arteriviruses-spherical) and virion sizes.\n\nArteriviruses infect macrophages (M\u03a6s) and dendritic cells (DCs) and have restricted host ranges; EAV infects horses and donkeys, PRRSV infects pigs, LDV infects mice and SHFV infects non-human primates (NHPs) (Snijder and Meulenberg 1998) . Disease symptoms associated with EAV and PRRSV infections include fever, respiratory disease, tissue necrosis and spontaneous abortions while LDV typically causes asymptomatic, persistent infections (Snijder and Spaan 2006) . The majority of research on arteriviruses has focused on EAV and PRRSV due to the significant agricultural impact of the diseases they cause.\n\nSHFV was first isolated in 1964 as the causative agent of hemorrhagic fever outbreaks associated with high mortality in macaque colonies in the United States and the USSR (Allen, Palmer et al. 1968 , Shevtsova 1969 , Lapin and Shevtsova 1971 . African monkeys, such as baboons and African green, patas and colobus monkeys, are natural hosts of SHFV and typically develop asymptomatic, persistent infections with low level viremia (London 1977 , Lauck, Hyeroba et al. 2011 , Lauck, Sibley et al. 2013 . SHFV-infected macaques develop fever, facial edema, anorexia, dehydration, depression and coagulation defects indicated by skin petechiae, retrobulbar hemorrhages and subcutaneous hematomas. Death occurs 7 to 13 days after infection (Allen, Palmer et al. 1968 , London 1977 . The clinical signs and disease course closely resemble those induced in macaques by other hemorrhagic fever virus infections, such as Ebola Zaire, Marburg, and Lassa (Mahanty and Bray 2004, Bray and Geisbert 2005) . The presence of persistently infected African NHPs in the NIH primate colony and the use of the same needle for tattooing or tuberculosis testing of multiple NHPs of African and Asian origin are thought to have resulted in inadvertent virus transmission to macaques (Allen, Palmer et al. 1968 ). SHFV is typically transmitted between African NHPs during fighting but can spread efficiently among macaques by both direct and indirect contact (London 1977 , Renquist 1990 ).\n\nBased on an unpublished number of test animals, it was previously estimated that 1% of baboons, 1% of African green monkeys and 10% of patas monkeys are SHFV-positive (London 1977) . In a recent study, sera/plasma samples from 205 baboons from a US colony were tested for SHFV using two RT-PCR assays targeted to conserved sequence regions . Of the wild-caught Olive baboons tested, 14.2% were positive for SHFV. However, because none of the archived sera samples tested were collected at the time of capture, it is not known whether these animals were infected in the wild or after capture. Nineteen percent of the opportunistically sampled animals living in the colony were SHFV-positive. However, because most of the colony animals tested were males that were being treated for lacerations obtained during fighting, the percentage of SHFV-positive animals in the entire colony is expected to be lower. None of the SHFV positive baboons showed any signs of disease. Infections lasting >10 years were documented using serial archived sera samples and the viremia levels were consistently low (100-1000 PFU/ml).\n\nThe outcomes of experimental infections of patas monkeys with one of four previous SHFV isolates indicated differences in their biological properties (Gravell, London et al. 1986 ). LVR was isolated from a stump tail macaque that died of hemorrhagic fever disease ), P-248 was isolated from a feral, persistently infected patas monkey, P-180 was isolated from a patas monkey that died from an SHFV infection, and P741 was isolated from a rhesus macaque that died after inoculation of SHFV from an asymptomatic persistently infected patas monkey. Infection of patas monkeys with two of the isolates (LVR and P-180) produced acute transient clinical signs of hemorrhagic disease with p-180 causing more severe disease that was only rarely fatal. Infection of patas monkeys with either P-248 or P741 produced asymptomatic, long-term persistent infections. Acutely infected animals produced high levels of anti-viral antibody while antibody titers in persistently infected animals were low. Lytic infections were induced by LVR in MA-104 cells, a rhesus macaque kidney cell line, as well as in both patas and rhesus peritoneal M\u03a6s. P-180 could lytically infect both types of M\u03a6s but not MA-104 cells while P-248 and P-741 could lytically infect only rhesus macaque M\u03a6s. All four of these isolates efficiently induced acute fatal hemorrhagic fever disease in macaques. EAV and PRRSV can also efficiently infect MA104 cells. The M\u03a6-restricted protein sialoadhesion (CD169) mediates virus attachment and internalization by clathrin-mediated endocytosis of EAV and PRRSV (Van Breedam, Delputte et al. 2010 ). CD163 was identified as an arterivirus co-receptor required for nucleocapsid release from endosomes and is also monocyte-macrophage lineage restricted (Welch and Calvert 2010) . MA104 cells express CD163 and CD151 but not sialoadhesin. It was recently reported that SHFV LVR enters MA104 cells by clathrinmediated endocytosis and that treatment of MA104 cells with anti-CD163 antibody decreased SHFV replication (Cai, Postnikova et al. 2014) .\n\nOnly the prototype SHFV isolate, LVR v42-0/M6941, survived from the earlier studies of SHFV ). The species of African NHP from which LVR originated is not known for certain but patas monkeys housed in the same facility were subsequently shown to be persistently infected with SHFV and the source of the SHFV shown to initiate additional epizootics in macaques in the same facility (London 1977) . A complete sequence of the SHFV LVR genome was obtained in the early 1990s by sequencing \"shot gun\" clones by older methods (GenBank Assession number AF180391.1). During the construction of the first infectious SHFV infectious clone, nucleotide differences were detected between RT-PCR amplified cDNA fragments used to construct the full length clone and the GenBank sequence. The SHFV LVR genome RNA was also subjected to 454 sequencing. The same 18 nt differences compared to the GenBank sequence were detected by both 454 genomic sequencing and individual fragment sequencing and the GenBank sequence was updated (GenBank Assession number AF180391.2).\n\nAlthough a low dose of SHFV LVR, in sera or culture fluid injected by the intramuscular route consistently induced severe hemorrhagic disease in macaques in the 1960s , no correlation between SHFV LVR dose (50 to 500,000 PFU) and hemorrhagic disease induction in macaques was observed in a 2011 study and the majority of the animals (12 of 16) that did not survive were found to have bacterial sepsis (Johnson, Dodd et al. 2011) . The inoculum used in this study was generated by three freeze-thaw cycles of infected MA104 cells. Activation of cell RNA sensors by the large amounts of cell and viral (genomic and sg) RNAs in these lysates may have induced a strong host antiviral response that contributed to the decreased efficiency of hemorrhagic disease induction observed. Also, defective SHFV genomes present in the LVR stock used may have reduced the efficiency of virus replication ).\n\nSHFV isolates obtained from two SHFV-positive Olive baboons (B11661 and B11662) that were housed together only in the early 1990s and persistently infected >10 years were amplified by a single passage in primary rhesus macaque M\u03a6s and 454 sequenced ). The two sequences were very similar to each other, differing at 15 nt positions within the 15.7 kb genome. Surprisingly, these genomes sequences were also very similar (differing at 7 or 10 unique positions, respectively) to that of a three times serially plaque-purified stock of SHFV LVR grown in MA104 cells. Four Japanese macaques injected intravenously with 100 PFU of B11661 developed severe hemorrhagic fever disease, characterized by high level viremia, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, elevation of tissue factor and coagulopathy but no evidence of bacterial sepsis. Infected M\u03a6s were detected in liver and spleen tissue sections using antibody to viral nonstructural proteins and the M\u03a6 marker CD68. SHFV infection in macaques has been proposed as a BSL2 model for viral hemorrhagic fever disease (Johnson, Dodd et al. 2011 ).\n\nAnother recent study sequenced SHFV genomes obtained from wild Mikumi yellow baboons and captive Olive baboons in the same US primate facility used for the study described above and found them to be divergent (Bailey, Lauck et al. 2014) . Different SHFV genome sequences obtained from additional wild species of African NHPs, red colobus and red-tailed guenons were previously reported (Lauck, Sibley et al. 2013 , Bailey, Lauck et al. 2014 . Two different strains of SHFV (krc1 and krc2) were isolated from red colobus animals and sequence diversity was detected among isolates of the same strain from different infected animals. One animal was found to be co-infected with both SHFV strains. No signs of disease were observed in SHFV-infected red colobus, even though the viremia levels were high (10 6 -10 7 RNA copies/ml of plasma). It is not yet known whether these SHFV isolates can infect macaques and induce hemorrhagic fever disease.\n\nreported that pro-inflammatory cytokines released from Ebola infected macaque M\u03a6s and DCs upregulate tissue factor and sequentially induce disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (Bray and Geisbert 2005) . The ability of an SHFV LVR infection to induce proinflammatory cytokine production was compared in M\u03a6s and myeloid DCs differentiated in culture from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from disease resistant baboons and disease susceptible macaques . Both viral RNA replication and virion production were more robust in macaque M\u03a6s and mDCs than in baboon cells (Table 1) . Approximately ~90% of macaque M\u03a6s but only 10% of baboon M\u03a6s were productively infected but the intracellular dsRNA fluorescence signal was similarly bright in the cells from both types of NHPs. In contrast, a similar percentage of baboon and macaque mDCs were infected (~50%) but the intensity of intracellular dsRNA signal was much higher in macaque mDCs than baboon mDCs suggesting that the higher yield of SHFV produced by macaque mDCs was due to more efficient intracellular virus replication. The mechanisms involved in the observed variations in cell susceptibility have not yet been analyzed.\n\nConsistent with the observed induction of hemorrhagic fever disease by SHFV infection in macaques, SHFV infection of cultured macaque but not of baboon M\u03a6s and mDCs induced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12/23(p40), TNF-\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b1 . UV-inactivated SHFV induced only transient production of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 indicating that early stages of the virus lifecycle can induce this response but that sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine production requires virus replication . IL-10 signaling leading to upregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) that suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production (Moore, de Waal Malefyt et al. 2001) . Cultured baboon M\u03a6s and mDCs expressed higher basal levels of IL-10 than macaque cells and the levels of both the inducible IL-10 receptor subunit 1 (IL-10R1) and SOCS3 were upregulated in SHFV-infected baboon M\u03a6s and mDCs. In contrast, in SHFV-infected macaque M\u03a6s and mDCs, the levels of IL-10R1 were downregulated with time after infection and SOCS3 expression was not induced. Treatment of macaque M\u03a6s and mDCs with recombinant human IL-10 starting prior to or at the time of infection with SHFV suppressed IL-6 and MIP-1\u03b1 but not TNF-\u03b1 production in macaque cells without altering viral yields or cell viability. Treatment of baboon cells with anti-IL-10 antibody did not result in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and SOCS3 expression was upregulated prior to the upregulation of IL-10R1 suggesting that SOCS3 expression may be induced by SHFV infection.\n\nThe arterivirus major and minor structural proteins are encoded within the 3\u2032 one-third of the genome and are translated from a nested set of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 coterminal subgenomic mRNAs (sg mRNAs) (Zeng, Godeny et al. 1995 , Godeny, deVries et al. 1998 , Snijder and Spaan 2006 . The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome encodes two polyproteins 1a and 1ab. Polyprotein 1ab is produced when a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift occurs on a slippery sequence located near the polyprotein 1a stop codon (Snijder and Spaan 2006) . A second frameshift (-2) can occur in nsp2 producing a truncated nsp2 protein with a different C-terminal sequence (nsp2TF) (Fang, Treffers et al. 2012) . Polyproteins 1a and 1ab are posttranslationally cleaved by viral proteases to generate the nonstructural proteins (nsp) involved in replication and transcription of the viral genome and sg mRNAs Meulenberg 1998, Beerens, Selisko et al. 2007 ). The SHFV genome encodes additional proteins at both its 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends compared to the genomes of the other known arteriviruses.\n\nThe nsp1 proteins are encoded at the N-terminus of polyproteins 1a and are cleaved from the polyprotein by viral papain-like protease 1 (PLP1) domains. All of the arterivirus nsp1 proteins function as interferon pathway antagonists, inhibiting IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB mediated IFN\u03b2 promoter activity as well as the ISRE promotor activity (Beura, Sarkar et al. 2010 , Fang and Snijder 2010 , Kim, Sun et al. 2010 , Song, Krell et al. 2010 , Beura, Subramaniam et al. 2012 , Han, Kim et al. 2014 . The N-terminal zinc-finger domain in EAV nsp1 and PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 was shown to regulate sg mRNA and genome transcription abundance (van Dinten, den Boon et al. 1997 , Kroese, Zevenhoven-Dobbe et al. 2008 , Nedialkova, Gorbalenya et al. 2010 ).\n\nThe arterivirus ORF1a polyprotein encodes multiple proteases: PLP1 domains in the nsp1 region, a PLP2 domain in nsp2, and the main serine protease domain in nsp4 (Snijder and Spaan 2006) . Arterivirus PLP2s are similar to coronavirus PLPs (PLP1, PLP2, and PLpro) in having a catalytic Cys-His-Asp triad and the ability to cleave both in cis and in trans (Mielech, Chen et al. 2014) . In contrast, arterivirus PLP1s have a Cys-His catalytic tandem (Sun, Xue et al. 2009 , Xue, Sun et al. 2010 . EAV, LDV and PRRSV PLP1s were shown to cleave exclusively in cis at a single site downstream of the catalytic domain (Snijder and Spaan 2006) . All of the coronavirus PLPs and the arterivirus PLP2s also have deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities (van Kasteren, Bailey-Elkin et al. 2013 , Mielech, Chen et al. 2014 . Most coronavirus PLPs cleave at a canonical -Leu-X-Gly\u2193Gly site but the cleavage sites of arterivirus PLPs are not well conserved (Sun, Xue et al. 2009 , Xue, Sun et al. 2010 , Mielech, Chen et al. 2014 . Autocleavage by LDV and PRRSV PLP1\u03b1 and PLP1\u03b2 generate nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2, respectively (den Boon, Faaberg et al. 1995 , Sun, Xue et al. 2009 , Xue, Sun et al. 2010 ) ( Figure 1A ). The EAV PLP1\u03b1 domain is inactive due to a Lys substitution of the catalytic Cys residue and a single nsp1 fusion protein is produced (Snijder, Wassenaar et al. 1992 , Ziebuhr, Snijder et al. 2000 .\n\nSHFV is unique among arteriviruses in encoding a longer nsp1 region containing three predicted PLP1 domains (PLP1\u03b1, PLP1\u03b2, and PLP1\u03b3) ( Figure 1A ). The SHFV LVR nsp1 sequences were homology modeled on crystal structures of PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 (Sun, Xue et al. 2009 , Xue, Sun et al. 2010 . SHFV nsp1\u03b1 modeled well on the PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 structure and SHFV nsp1\u03b2 modeled well on the PRRSV nsp1\u03b2 structure. SHFV nsp1\u03b3 was modeled on both the PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 structures and appeared to be more similar to PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 than nsp1\u03b2. The catalytic residues of other arterivirus PLP1s were previously identified as a Cys and a His located about 60 amino acids downstream. In all previously studied active arterivirus PLP1s, a Trp follows the catalytic Cys (den Boon, Faaberg et al. 1995 , Sun, Xue et al. 2009 , Xue, Sun et al. 2010 ). Alignment of the three SHFV PLP1 sequences with each other using a conserved GV[Q/T]G motif as an anchor ) predicted Cys246 as a catalytic residue of PLP1\u03b2 and Cys378 as a catalytic residue of PLP1\u03b3. Each of these Cys residues was adjacent to a Trp Brinton et al. Page 6 Virus Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 April 16. and located 62 and 64 aa upstream, respectively, of the predicted catalytic His. In PLP1\u03b1, the only Cys adjacent to a Trp was Cys115 located only 14 amino acids upstream of the predicted catalytic His. Cys63 located 67 amino acids upstream of the predicted catalytic His aligned with the predicted catalytic Cys residues of SHFV PLP1\u03b2 and PLP1\u03b3 but was adjacent to an Ala. Alignment of SHFV, PRRSV and LDV PLP1\u03b1 sequences also predicted Cys63 as the catalytic Cys. Arterivirus PLP1 cleavage site sequences are not well conserved (den Boon, Faaberg et al. 1995 , Sun, Xue et al. 2009 , Xue, Sun et al. 2010 . The alignments predicted that SHFV PLP1\u03b1 cleaved at either Gly170/Thr171 or Gly164/Gly165, that PLP1\u03b2 cleaved at Gly350/Gly351 and that PLP1\u03b3 cleaved at Gly484/Gly485.\n\nIn vitro autocleavage products of wild type and mutant polyproteins consisting of the SHFV LVR nsp1 region plus the N-terminal part of nsp2 with an N-terminal Flag tag and a Cterminal c-Myc tag were analyzed ). In addition to the expected precursors and cleavage products, a ~30 kDa band was consistently detected in the wild type lysate, Flag and c-Myc immunoprecipitation lanes, suggesting the existence of an extra cleavage site within the PLP1\u03b2 catalytic domain that generates N-and C-terminal ~30 kDa cleavage products. Substitution of Cys63 with Ala in PLP1\u03b1 abrogated cleavage between nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 and substitution of Cys378 in PLP1\u03b3 abrogated cleavage between nsp1\u03b3 and nsp2, identifying these Cys as functional catalytic residues ( Figure 1B ) ). However, substitution of Cys246 with Ala in PLP1\u03b2 reduced but did not inhibit cleavage between nsp1\u03b2 and nsp1\u03b3 suggesting that Cys246 is a PLP1\u03b2 catalytic residue but that another PLP1 can also cleave at the nsp1\u03b2/nsp1\u03b3 junction. Inefficient cleavage at the nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2 junction as well as within nsp1\u03b2 by PLP1\u03b1 was observed when both the PLP1\u03b2 and PLP1\u03b3 catalytic Cys residues were substituted with Ala. Efficient cleavage at the nsp1\u03b2/ nsp1\u03b3 junction as well as within nsp1\u03b2 by PLP1\u03b2 was observed when the catalytic Cys residues of both PLP1\u03b1 and PLP1\u03b3 were mutated. However, efficient cleavage at the nsp1\u03b3/ nsp2 junction, within nsp1\u03b2 and also at the nsp1\u03b2/nsp1\u03b3 junction by PLP1\u03b3 was observed when the PLP1\u03b1 and PLP1\u03b2 catalytic Cys residues were mutated indicating that SHFV PLP1\u03b3 can cleave at upstream sites as well as at a downstream site ( Figure 1B ).\n\nConstructs with the \u22121 and \u22122 amino acids of each predicted cleavage site substituted were used to functionally identify the SHFV PLP1 cleavage sites . Two putative cleavage sites were predicted for PLP1\u03b1; no cleavage at the nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2 junction was detected when Gly164/Gly165 were substituted while substitution of the Gly171/ Thr172 site only reduced cleavage, suggesting that the Gly164/Gly165 site is the preferred cleavage site at the nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2 junction ( Figure 1B) . This finding was supported by a mass spectroscopy analysis of the immunoprecipitated nsp1\u03b1 cleavage product that detected ten trypsin generated peptides ending at aa164 and only one peptide ending at aa171. Substitution of the predicted Gly350/Gly351 site resulted in loss of cleavage at the nsp1\u03b2/ nsp1\u03b3 junction, indicating this is the cleavage site used. Three adjacent Gly residues are present at the predicted cleavage site between nsp1\u03b3 and nsp2. Substitution of either Gly484/ Gly485 or Gly485/Gly486 resulted in loss of cleavage between nsp1\u03b3 and nsp2. Mass spectroscopy analyses of immunoprecipitated cleavage products nsp1\u03b1+\u03b2 and nsp1\u03b1+\u03b2+\u03b3 confirmed the locations of the cleavage sites at the nsp1\u03b2/nsp1\u03b3 and nsp1\u03b3/nsp2 junctions.\n\nSubstitution of the Gly271/Val272 site within nsp1\u03b2 resulted in the loss of cleavage within nsp1\u03b2, indicating that this site can be cleaved in in vitro reactions.\n\nAnalysis of SHFV nsp1 region autoprocessing in infected cells by Western blotting using SHFV nsp1\u03b1-, nsp1\u03b2-(N-or C-terminal) or nsp1\u03b3-specific antibodies detected only the mature nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2 and nsp1\u03b3 proteins, respectively ). The lack of detection of any intermediate precursor bands or truncated nsp1\u03b2 proteins suggested that rapid processing of the nsp1 polyprotein occurs in infected cells. Cleavage at the Gly271/ Val272 site within nsp1\u03b2 in the in vitro assays but not in infected cells could be due to misfolding of some of the in vitro translated polyproteins and/or the lack of posttranslational modifications and/or chaperones.\n\nA recent study on arterivirus nsp1 proteins used SHFV nsp1 expression constructs made from a different stock of SHFV LVR than the one used for the study described above to analyze autocleavage in HeLa cells (Han, Kim et al. 2014) . This study predicted C115 as a catalytic residue of PLP1\u03b1 and did not observe cleavage at the nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2 junction.\n\nArteriviruses differ from coronaviruses in having a spherical nucleocapsid composed of interacting nucleocapsid (N) protein dimers. The capsid is surrounded by an envelope that contains two major envelop proteins, the non-glycosylated membrane (M) protein and the major glycoprotein (GP5), which form disulfide-linked heterodimers (Delputte, Vanderheijden et al. 2002 , Delputte, Van Breedam et al. 2007 ). Three minor glycoproteins (GPs), GP2, GP3 and GP4, form a complex that is located periodically on the virion envelope Spaan 2006, Tian, Wei et al. 2012) . Another minor structural protein E forms oligomers in the virion envelope and is thought to function as an ion-channel during viral entry (Snijder, van Tol et al. 1999, Lee and Yoo 2006 ). An additional recently discovered minor structural protein 5a was detected in purified PRRSV particles and inhibition of 5a expression reduced EAV yields (Johnson, Griggs et al. 2011 , Sun, Li et al. 2013 . SHFV is unique among the arteriviruses in encoding two adjacent sets of four minor structural proteins (Godeny, deVries et al. 1998) . These genes, listed in their order from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 in the genome, were recently renamed GP2\u2032, E\u2032, GP3\u2032, GP4\u2032 and E, GP2, GP3, GP4 ( Figure 2A) . Notably, the order of the open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the GP2 and E protein orthologs differ between the two sets ( Figure 2B ) (Snijder and Spaan 2006) .\n\nEAV encodes a single set of the four minor structural proteins that are produced from three sg mRNAs because GP2 and E are both expressed from the bicistronic sg mRNA 2 (van Berlo, Horzinek et al. 1982 , Snijder and Meulenberg 1998 , Snijder, van Tol et al. 1999 . SHFV encodes two adjacent sets of the four minor structural proteins and six sg mRNAs were expected for their expression ( Figure 2C ). However, the leader-body junction sequence for the GP3\u2032 sg mRNA was not detected suggesting that SHFV GP2\u2032 and GP3\u2032 were expressed from a bicistronic sg mRNA 2\u2032 (Godeny, deVries et al. 1998 ). The subsequent discovery of an ORF for the E\u2032 protein which overlaps the GP2\u2032 ORF and the demonstration of bicistronic expression of E and GP2 from the EAV sg mRNA 2 (Snijder, van Tol et al. 1999 ) made it unlikely that three minor structural proteins, GP2\u2032, E\u2032 and GP3\u2032, would be expressed from the SHFV sg mRNA2\u2032. A recent Northern blotting analysis of the sg mRNAs produced in infected MA104 cells detected six minor structural protein sg mRNAs including one of the size predicted for a separate GP3\u2032 sg mRNA (sg mRNA 3\u2032) . The existence of sg mRNA 3\u2032 was confirmed by leader-body sequencing data. The ORFs for GP2\u2032, E\u2032 and GP3\u2032 were renamed ORF2a\u2032, ORF2b\u2032 and ORF3\u2032, respectively ( Figure 2 ). The identification of sg mRNA3\u2032 for GP3\u2032 led to the interesting observation that the relative abundance of the corresponding sg mRNAs in the duplicated sets of the SHFV minor structural proteins was similar, with sg mRNAs 2\u2032 and 2 being more abundant and sg mRNAs 3\u2032, 3, 4\u2032 and 4 being less abundant. This finding indicated that regulation of the expression of the individual minor structural protein sg mRNAs in the duplicated sets is conserved. The different order of the ORFs for the GP2 and E orthologs in the two sets suggests that the second set of SHFV minor structural proteins was not generated by a simple duplication event.\n\nLittle work has so far been done on the viral and cell proteins and cis acting viral RNA elements involved in regulating SHFV RNA replication. However, RNA structures in the 3\u2032 noncoding region (NCR) of the genome and the 3\u2032 NCR of the minus strand (\u2212) RNA were previously predicted and cell proteins binding to these RNA regions that may be involved in regulating the functions of the genomic 3' NCRs during initiation of RNA synthesis were identified (You-Kyung and Brinton 1998 , Maines, Young et al. 2005 . Two cell proteins, p56 and p42, that bound specifically to an SHFV 3\u2032(+)NCR RNA probe were identified as polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) and fructose bisphosphate aldolase A, respectively. PTB binding sites in the SHFV 3'SL structure were mapped to a terminal loop and a bulged region and the aldolase A binding site to a region near the top of the 3\u2032SL. Four SHFV 3\u2032(\u2212) NCR RNA binding cell proteins (103, 86, 55, and 36 kDa) were detected in UV-induced cross-linking assays, and three of these proteins (103, 55, and 36 kDa) were also detected by Northwestern blotting assays. The binding sites for these four cellular proteins were mapped to the region between nt 117 and 184 from the 3' end of the negative strand RNA. This 68-nt sequence was predicted to form two stem-loops, SL4 and SL5. Additional data obtained with (+) and (\u2212) 3\u2032NCR RNAs of other arteriviruses suggested that the RNA elements interacting with the identified cell proteins are conserved among arteriviruses.\n\nMutant SHFV infectious clones lacking the expression of either one of the minor structural proteins or of a pair of minor structural protein orthologs were made ). None of these clones produced infectious virus. However, the ability of each clone to produce extracellular virions was assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR of extracellular viral RNA. Cells transfected with the \u0394GP4\u2032, \u0394GP2 or \u0394GP3 mutant infectious clone RNAs produced a sustained low level of extracellular viral RNA beginning at 24 h after transfection (Table 2 ). In contrast, after transfection of wildtype infectious clone RNA, extracellular viral RNA increased dramatically starting at 96 h after transfection. The lack of amplification of extracellular viral RNA at later times observed for all of the mutants indicated that the extracellular virus particles produced were non-infectious. The \u0394GP4 infectious clone RNA also produced a low level of extracellular viral RNA beginning at 24 h after transfection, but the level was not sustained indicating a potential role for GP4 in virion stability. The \u0394GP2\u2032, \u0394GP3\u2032, \u0394E\u2032 and \u0394E mutant infectious clone RNAs did not produce extracellular viral RNA above background levels suggesting that each of these proteins plays an essential role in virus replication or virion production. No extracellular viral RNA production was detected from MA104 cells transfected with any of the double mutant RNAs. No intracellular viral proteins were detected in lysates from any of the mutant RNA transfected cells by Western blotting, which is consistent with a lack of virus spread. Although the abundance of sg mRNA orthologs in the duplicated sets of SHFV minor structural proteins is similar, the functions of the orthologs are not redundant. The finding that both sets of minor structural proteins are required for efficient production of infectious extracellular virus indicates that SHFV virus production and virion structure are more complex than those of other known arteriviruses.\n\nSHFV typically causes benign persistent infections in African NFPs which are natural hosts but fatal hemorrhagic fever disease in Asian macaques which are not natural hosts. M\u03a6s from the two types of animals differed in the percentage of susceptible cells present while mDCs from the two animals differed in their ability to efficiently replicate virus. Consistent with the different symptoms observed in SHFV infected African NHPs and macaques, SHFV infection of cultured macaque M\u03a6s and mDCs induced proinflammatrory cytokine production while infections in baboon cells did not. The data suggest that there is a balance between upregulation of cell anti-viral and inflammatory responses and viral-mediated counteraction/modulation of these responses that is beneficial to both the host and the virus in African NHPs but not in macaques. All previous isolates of SHFV caused severe hemorrhagic fever disease in macaques but varied in their ability to cause signs of hemorrhagic disease that was rarely fatal in patas monkeys. A new SHFV isolate from persistently infected baboons lytically infected rhesus macaque M\u03a6s and MA104 cells and caused long term asymptomatic persistent infections in baboons but fatal hemorrhagic fever disease in macaques. Although divergent SHFV genome sequences obtained from additional NHP species have recently been reported, data from experimental infection studies with these isolates in different types of NHPs and cells have not yet been reported.\n\nThe SHFV genome encodes five additional proteins compared to other known arteriviruses. The additional nsp1 protein nsp1\u03b3 was predicted to be more similar to PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 than to PRRSV nsp1\u03b2. However, PLP1\u03b3 is able to cleave at upstream as well as downstream sites, which is a characteristic of the PLP2s but not PLP1s of other arteriviruses. Arterivirus PLP2s have a Cya-His-Asp catalytic triad and deubiquitinating as well as deISGylating activities in addition to protease activity. SHFV PLP1\u03b3 has a Cys-His catalytic dyad and is not predicted to have deubiquitinating or deISGylating activity. SHFV nsp1\u03b3 may have originated by a duplication of nsp1\u03b1. It is possible that SHFV PLP1\u03b1 may also be able to cleave upstream but due to its location at the 5\u2032 end of the 1a polyprotein, this ability was not tested. Sequence alignment indicated that the three SHFV PLP1s are more similar to each other that to those of other arteriviruses. Additional functional studies of the SHFV PLP1s, including analysis of possible trans cleavage activities, as well as crystal structures of the three SHFV nsp1s are needed to provide insights about the origin of the additional SHFV nsp1 region.\n\nA duplicated set of four additional minor structural proteins is encoded in the 3\u2032 end of the SHFV genome. The finding that each of the minor structural proteins from both sets is required for the production of infectious SHFV suggests that the SHF virion composition is more complex than that of other known arteriviruses. Cells transfected with mutant viral RNAs that did not express GP2\u2032, GP3\u2032, E, or E\u2032 did not produce extracellular virus particles suggesting that these proteins have essential functions during earlier stages of the virus life cycle. However, some or all of these proteins may also be functionally important for virion infectivity. The EAV, PRRSV and LDV E proteins have a conserved N-terminal myristoylation site (Thaa, Kabatek et al. 2009 ). The observation of a decrease in virus infectivity and plaque size but not in the yield of extracellular virions when myristoylation was inhibited in EAV-infected cells suggested that E protein myristoylation is required for virion infectivity but not for virion budding (Thaa, Kabatek et al. 2009 ). This finding is consistent with E protein ion channel function being required for virion entry. The SHFV E protein sequence contains the conserved N-terminal myristoylation site but the SHFV E\u2032 protein sequence does not. Both of the SHFV E proteins appear to have intracellular functions during the virus replication cycle but one or both may also function during virion entry. The SHFV E protein is more homologous to the EAV and LDV E proteins and the orientation of the overlapping E and GP2 ORFs in these genomes is similar. SHFV E\u2032 is more homologous to the PRRSV E and the genomes both have the opposite orientation of the E and GP2 ORFs. All of these data more support acquisition of an additional set of minor SHFV structural proteins by a recombination event with the genome of another arterivirus than by a \"duplication\" recombination event between SHFV genomes. All of the newly discovered SHFV genomes in additional species of NHPs that have been recently sequenced encode two similar sets of minor structural proteins indicating that the addition of the second set of genes is not a recent event. The identity of the ancestral arterivirus contributing the additional set of SHFV minor structural proteins and the circumstances under which a co-infection occurred are not known.\n\n\u2022 SHFV induces hemorrhagic fever in macaques but not in African nonhuman primates.\n\n\u2022 A new baboon SHFV isolate induces hemorrhagic fever disease in macaques.\n\n\u2022 SHFV infection of macaque but not baboon cells induces proinflammatory cytokines.\n\n\u2022 Unique N-and C-terminal genes encoded by SHFV were functionally analyzed.\n\n\u2022 PLP1\u03b3 can cleave at upstream sites as well as at the expected downstream site.\n\n\u2022 Eight minor structural proteins are required for infectious virus production.
