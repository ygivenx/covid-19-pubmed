{"title": "Appropriate scaling approach for evaluating peak VO2 development in Southern Chinese 8 to 16 years old", "body": "It is well established that adequate aerobic fitness is associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality and chronic diseases across the lifespan[1\u20135]. Peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) is widely recognized as one of the best indicators of aerobic fitness in the child, providing a composite measure of the pulmonary, cardiovascular, and hematological components of oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization in the exercising muscles.\n\nIn clinical settings, peak VO2 has been used as a predictor of mortality and of hospital admissions [6\u20138], an indicator of the severity of functional impairment and for tracking responses to intervention [9]. Despite the proven usefulness of peak VO2, achieving quality and consistency of data in children remains a challenge. Peak VO2 is developmentally divergent, varying with age, maturity and sex, and is highly correlated with body size and composition [10, 11]. It has been convention to scale peak VO2 by simply dividing absolute peak VO2 (mL. min-1) by body mass (ratio scaling). This however, results in a different pattern of development in peak VO2 in comparison to absolute peak VO2, with absolute peak VO2 in boys increasing with age, but ratio-scaled peak VO2 remaining unchanged [12]. Similarly in girls, increases in absolute peak VO2 are noted with increasing age until a levelling off in puberty, but ratio-scaled peak VO2 declines with age [12].\n\nRatio scaling is only robust if underlying mathematical assumptions are met, otherwise spurious interpretation may result [13]. Theoretically, physiological variables should be scaled for size using the general allometric equation to derive the appropriate size power function (y/xb) and thereby providing a more appropriate interpretation of size-related (xb) changes in physiologic function (y) [14]. The development of peak VO2 has been described using allometric scaling (log-linear analysis of covariance with body mass as the covariate) in Caucasian children and adolescents, and the same developmental pattern as absolute peak VO2 has been noted with age i.e., peak VO2 increases in boys with age, whereas in girls it increases until about 14 years of age when a leveling off is observed [15]. In a recent study, z score equations targeted to remove the effect of body size for peak VO2 in a group of healthy children in Canada has also been presented [16].\n\nPeak VO2 has been shown to vary by ethnic group in children, with sparse data on Southern Chinese children [17, 18]. Little consideration has been given to the appropriate scaling of peak VO2 in the Chinese child, which is necessary for evaluating the development of peak VO2 and for the identification of children with low cardiopulomonary fitness. The purpose of this study therefore was to examine what the appropriate scaling approach for evaluating the development of peak VO2 in Southern Chinese children and adolescents should be, how power functions may differ by age and sex, and how this impacts interpretation of peak VO2.\n\nEthnic Chinese children and adolescents, aged 8\u201316 years, were recruited from the community using a stratified (by districts) and clustered (all subjects within class) random selection of primary (21 schools) and secondary schools (19 schools) from the 4 main geographical regions of Hong Kong (i.e. Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, New Territories East and New Territories West). Participation was on a voluntary basis. Informed and written consent was obtained from students and their parents. Those suffering from acute or chronic illness (for example, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, dyslipidaemia, congenital or acquired heart disease, lupus erythematosus, sleep apnoea), or had a recent upper respiratory tract or other infection with the past 4 weeks were excluded. The study protocol was approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong\u2014New Territory East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CRE Ref. No. 2013.574).\n\nThe sample selection was based on a stratified (by districts) and clustered (all subjects within class) randomised sampling frame. All primary and secondary schools registered under the Education Bureau according to the four geographic regions in Hong Kong were stratified. Selection of a school was based on computer generated random numbers. If the selected school refused to participate, the next randomly selected school was invited. A total of 12 primary and 19 secondary schools were randomly chosen. Two classes in each school year grade were randomly selected from the schools. All students of the selected classes were invited to participate in the study.\n\nParticipants were scheduled to undergo assessment at the cardiopulmonary exercise laboratory in the Prince of Wales Hospital. Participants were asked to abstain from alcohol, any caffeinated drink and vigorous exercise for 24 hours prior to testing. They were also asked to eat only a light snack and drink only 0.5L of water within 3 hours of the test.\n\nBody weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and percentage body fat was measured to the nearest 0.1% using foot-to-foot bio-electrical impedance (TBF-401, Tanita Co, Tokyo, Japan) [19], with subjects barefoot and dressed in light t-shirt and shorts. Standing height without shoes was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with a Harpenden stadiometer (Holtain, Grymych, UK). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by weight in kg divided by height in meters squared [20].\n\nPeak VO2 was assessed using an incremental treadmill running test to maximum [21]. Participants began walking on the treadmill at an age-specific walking speed for 3 minutes. The speed was then increased by 1 km\u00b7h-1 every minute, until the speed reached the running pace of the participant. At this point the speed was held constant and the gradient increased by 1% every minute until volitional exhaustion. Heart rate was monitored continuously during the test. Participants wore a comfortably fitted facemask (Hans Rudolph paediatric large size, 8950 series) and breath-by breath gas samples were collected and analyzed throughout the test using the Medgraphics CPX/DTM metabolic cart (Medical Graphics Corporation, St. Paul, MN), calibrated prior to each test. Peak VO2 was determined when two of the following three conditions were reached: 1) a respiratory exchange ratio (RER)>1.0, 2) heart rate within 5% of age predicted maximum, 3) the participant was exhausted and refused to carry on despite strong verbal encouragement [22].\n\nAssuming peak VO2 is normally distributed among each age and sex, the sample size was calculated using the standard deviation of the 100\u03b1th centile (SDc100\u03b1) and the age- and sex-specific SD described by Healy [23]. In order to determine the age and sex-specific mean and standard deviation (SD) of peak VO2 for sample size calculation, we collected pilot data from 261 healthy children aged 9\u201316 years. Age groups were analysed in 2-year intervals and the required sample size for each sex and age group was calculated to obtain the 97th centile, with an error of \u00b1 3%. We assumed that children under 9 will be the same as those under 10 years of age, and therefore proposed recruiting an additional 43 boys and 43 girls aged 8 years to help recruitment of the younger years. The estimated total number of subjects required was 828 (Table 1).\n\nPeak VO2 was allometrically scaled using the procedure described by Vanderburgh et al [24, 25]. Peak VO2 and body weight were log-transformed. A log-linear regression model was constructed using log (peak VO2) as the dependent and log (body weight) as independent variables. The interaction effects of age and sex were tested and found to significantly modulate the association between body mass and peak VO2, justifying the need for sex and age specific exponents. Therefore, allometric scaling was done separately for 4 different subgroups: (1) younger (aged from 8 to 11.99 years) males; (2) older (aged from 12 to 16.99 years) males; (3) younger females (aged from 8 to 11.99 years) and (4) older females (aged from 12 to 16.99 years). Outliers were identified using the least median of squares eliminator and removed from analyses [26]. Regression diagnostics were performed to ensure the models were appropriate [27]. Shapiro-Wilks normality test was used to evaluate the normality of the residuals. Homoscedasticity was assessed by plotting the standardized residuals against the standardized predicted value. The resulting beta coefficients were used as the allometric exponents. Peak VO2 can then be allometrically scaled using the equation:\nallometricallyscaledpeakVO2=unscaledpeakVO2bodymassexponent\n\nPearson correlation analysis was used to examine the association of the scaled peak VO2 with body size (body mass and height) and age to verify the effectiveness of the allometric scaling approach for controlling for body size within the specific age groups.\n\nGiven the necessity for different allometric exponents for body mass in the 4 different subgroups in this dataset, z scores for the four different subgroups were developed to allow comparisons of peak VO2 across age and sex.\n\nA stepwise regression was used to evaluate the association between peak VO2 and body size and age. The linear (x), second-order (x2) and third-order (x3) effects of age, height and weight were tested and the resulting regression equations were used to predict peak VO2. Subjects with the resulting standardised predicted VO2 greater than 3 or less than -3 were considered as outliers and were excluded. As the variance of the residual values varied with body size and the variations are different between sexes and age groups, age- and sex-specific models were established to predict the standard deviation with body size using the method suggested by Altman [28]. First, linear regression was used to examine the association between the absolute value of the residual values and body size. Since the residual values were normally distributed, the absolute values of the residual values had a half-normal distribution. The mean of a half-normal distribution is \u221a(2/\u03c0). The SD of the residuals can be estimated as the product of the mean of the absolute residuals and \u221a(\u03c0/2). It follows that the predicted values from the regression of the absolute residuals on body size multiplied by \u221a(\u03c0/2) would be the estimates of SD of the signed residual, and hence of peak VO2. As a result, two regression models were developed for each sex and age group, one for the prediction of peak VO2 and the other for the prediction of SD. Z scores were calculated using the following formula:\nZscore=unscaledpeakVO2-predictedpeakVO2predictedSD\n\nThe calculated z scores were evaluated for departure from a normal distribution by visual assessment of histogram and by using the Shapiro-Wilk statistic.\n\nPearson correlation analysis was used to examine the association of the calculated z scores with body size and age to verify the validity of the computed z scores in controlling for body size and age.\n\nStudent\u2019s t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi-square test were used for group comparisons for parametric, nonparametric, and categorical data, respectively. The interaction effects of age and gender as well as pubertal stage and gender on peak VO2 were assessed by two-way ANOVA. The level of significance is set at p<0.05. Bonferroni correlation was used to adjust the significance level for multiple pairwise comparisons. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (version 21, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).\n\nPercentile curves for absolute peak VO2 (expressed in l\u00b7min-1) and allometrically scaled peak VO2 were constructed using the LMS method [29]. The LMS method using the maximum penalized likelihood has been used to perform model fitting of the anthropometric centiles for the physical parameters. The LMS method estimates the measurement centiles in terms of three age- and sex-specific cubic spline curves: the L curve (Box-Cox power to transform the data that follow a normal distribution), M curve (median), and S curve (coefficient of variation).\n\nChildren\u2019s absolute peak VO2 was also compared to the predicted peak VO2 from Armstrong and Welsman\u2019s regression equations generated from the data of European children [12].\n\nAbsolute peak VO2 was significantly greater in older (F1,848 = 814, P <0.001) and male (F1,848 = 52, P <0.001) participants. A significant age*sex interaction was present (F1,834 = 102, P <0.001), with subgroup analyses demonstrating an increase in peak VO2 with age in both males (F1,408 = 582, P <0.001) and females (F1,440 = 228, P <0.001) (Fig 1). Post-hoc analysis confirmed that the difference in peak VO2 between boys and girls became apparent from 12 years of age. Scatter plots of peak VO2 against age for boys and girls are presented in S1 and S2 Figs, respectively. Using the LMS method, smoothed percentile curves for unscaled peak VO2 were constructed for boys (Table 3 and Fig 2) and girls (Table 4 and Fig 3). The smoothed centiles are established with all standard errors within 9%.\n\nWhen peak VO2 was expressed as a ratio standard with body mass (ml\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1), a significant main effect for age (F1,848 = 9.4, P = 0.002) and sex (F1,848 = 24, P <0.001) and a significant age*sex interaction (F1,834 = 50, P <0.001) were present. Ratio-scaled peak VO2 increased with age in boys (F1,408 = 43, P <0.001), but decreased with age in girls (F1,440 = 10, P = 0.002) (Fig 4). Differences between boys and girls were only significant from age 13 years and older.\n\nThe allometric exponents generated for the younger (aged from 8 to 11.99 years) males and older (aged from 12 to 16.99 years) males were 0.635 and 0.839 respectively. For the younger females (aged from 8 to 11.99 years) and older females (aged from 12 to 16.99 years) exponents were 0.678 and 0.798. Regression diagnostics confirmed that the residuals for the log-linear regression using body mass were normally distributed, and the residuals were homoscedastic. Percentiles for the 4 subgroups are presented in Table 5 and the smoothed percentile curves for allometric scaled peak VO2 of the 4 subgroups are presented in Fig 5.\n\nThe regression equations of predicted peak VO2 and SD for the four different subgroups are displayed in Table 6. An automated excel file (S1 File) has been developed to calculate the z score for peak VO2. The resulting z score for peak VO2 was normally distributed and had no residual correlation with age, weight and height. The agreement between the percentile ranks from z score and allometric scaling is high (ICC = 0.95).\n\nPearson correlations of absolute, ratio scaled, allometric scaled peak VO2, and z score of peak VO2 with body mass, height and age within each subgroup are presented in Table 7. All correlations between z score of peak VO2 and body mass, height, and age were close to zero (p>0.2 for all) in all subgroups. For allometric scaled peak VO2, only the correlations with body mass were close to zero (p>0.7 for all) in all subgroups. Significant associations with height and age were apparent in males and in the younger females. Both absolute and ratio-scaled peak VO2 were significantly associated with body size and/or age in all subgroups.\n\nThe sample size estimation was based on establishing a representative cohort with precise extreme centiles for each age and sex. The estimated sample size did not provide sufficient power for log-linear regression analysis to determine sex-specific exponents with high precision for each chronological year. Therefore, we formed younger (<12 years) and older (\u226512 years) groups to ensure the precision of the exponents.\n\nWe do not include lean body mass in the current study because we only had bioelectrical impedance data on a limited number of our participants. Although scaling for lean body mass is preferred [41], many clinical testing settings like our do not have easy more valid measures of lean body mass such as dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry or magnetic resonance imaging. Besides, physical activity level was also not measured in this study so that its impact on peak VO2 could not be examined. In this study, the cardiopulmonary exercise test was performed on a treadmill and the reference values would not be applicable if the test was performed using other ergometers such as a cycle ergometer.\n\nIn conclusion, we have provided comparisons between different body size scaling approaches for peak VO2 in Southern Chinese girls and boys and have shown these differentially impact the interpretation of peak VO2 with changes in age and sex. We recommend the use of z scores for identifying Southern Chinese children with poor cardiopulmonary fitness, and provide an accessible data processing tools for this purpose."}
