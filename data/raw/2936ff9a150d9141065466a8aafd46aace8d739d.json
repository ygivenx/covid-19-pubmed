{"title": "Original Article", "body": "The use of effective immunosuppressant (IS) is explored to prevent graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after solid organ transplantation (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, immunocompromised conditions induced by IS exacerbate the risk of opportunistic infections. 1\u00c03 Communityacquired respiratory viruses (CA-RVs), as well as multidrug-resistant bacteria and molds, have increasingly become of great importance, comprising a large burden on posttransplant infection. 2\u00c04 CA-RVs can cause lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), resulting in mortality and lifethreatening morbidities in transplant recipients. 5\u00c08 SOT and HSCT recipients face different hurdles, such as susceptibility to CA-RV infection (CA-RVI) within posttransplant timeframe. 1\u00c04,9 HSCT recipients are mainly susceptible to severe CA-RVI in the early posttransplant period, including pre-engraftment with prolonged neutropenia. SOT recipients could be at risk of CA-RVI from the community at any time during the posttransplant period. 1, 2, 10 Non-transplant critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are another group vulnerable to invasive CA-RVI. 11\u00c015 Among patients with severe rhinovirus pneumonia diagnosed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), transplantation did not comprise the majority of underlying conditions (To et al., 78%; Choi et al., 95.4%). 14, 15 Most patients with acute respiratory failure by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were also not transplant recipients. 16 Respiratory infections caused by CA-RVs apart from seasonal influenza A/B may have been under-diagnosed before the introduction of multiplex RT-PCR methods. 17, 18 As the diagnosis of the precise species of CA-RVI became possible, CA-RVs have had great clinical significance in severely immunocompromised patients. 19 The epidemiology and clinical outcome of adenovirus (AdV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza (PIV), and RSV in SOT and HSCT recipients have been reported during the past few decades. 4, 19 However, there are few reports of unique features and impact on outcome or mortality of CA-RVI in non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU compared to transplant recipients, even though many reports have focused on the comparison of specific CA-RVI, particularly seasonal influenza virus, between SOT and HSCT recipients. 19 The clinical information of CA-RVI between these susceptible groups will be helpful to clinicians if they need to consider the different strategies or practices for treating CA-RV, especially in severe LRTI cases, among transplant recipients or non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics and outcome of symptomatic respiratory infection resulting from CA-RVs besides seasonal influenza A/B, between nontransplant critically ill patients admitted to the ICU and transplant recipients.\n\nThis was a retrospective cohort study. We retrieved all data regarding 41,489 tests including multiplex RT-PCR and culture for 12 CA-RVs of AdV, coronavirus (CoV) 229E/ OC43/NL63, human bocavirus (hBoV), hMPV, PIV 1/2/3, rhinovirus, and RSV A/B, from SOT or HSCT recipients or from non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU who were !18 years of age and were admitted between November 2012 and November 2017 at the Severance Hospital, a university-affiliated tertiary-care center in Seoul. We did not include seasonal influenza A/B, which could have been diagnosed using rapid antigen test beside RT-PCR or culture in this study. The CA-RVs tests were performed for patients with a suspicion of symptomatic CA-RVI based on the respective clinician's judgement. We excluded 3426 CA-RVs tests that were performed during the pretransplant period or in recipients who received both SOT and HSCT or re-transplantation. Thereafter, 10,616 and 3794 CA-RVs test results from SOT and HSCT recipients, respectively, were finally included. The non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU had undergone 23,367 CA-RVs tests (Fig. 1) . Repeated identical CA-RV isolation in one patient within 30 days were considered as the same infection. Therefore, the cohort included 85 (29.7%) and 61 (21.3%) CA-RVI cases in SOT and HSCT recipients, respectively, and 140 (49.0%) CA-RVI cases in non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). This study was approved by Gangnam Severance Hospital Institutional Review Board, and the need for informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study.\n\nThe AdvanSure\u00e4 RV multiplex real-time RT-PCR kit with Taqman \u00e2 probe (AdvanSure; LG Life Sciences, Seoul, South \n\nThe CA-RVs tests have been performed when respiratory infection symptoms such as fever, cough, and sputum were noted, or when the patient was clinically suspected of having a CA-RVI. In some cases, one CA-RV was repeatedly detected at different time points and ! two CA-RVs were simultaneously detected in one patient. We considered several isolations caused by the same CA-RV within 30 days in one patient as one CA-RVI case. Abnormal findings on chest radiography and/or chest computed tomography (CT) scan was defined as the presence of newly developed lung parenchymal infiltration, as determined by the radiologist. We categorized seasonal variation based on spring (MarcheMay), summer (JuneeAugust), autumn (SeptembereNovember), and winter (DecembereFebruary).\n\nData were expressed as number (percent) or mean AE standard deviation or median (interquartile range [IQR]) according to whether they followed the normal distribution or not. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and post-hoc analysis via Bonferroni correction based on adjusted standardized residuals was used to control for type I error inflation (adjusted p). We used the parametric independent T-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to compare the continuous variables with normal distribution between two or three groups, respectively. Continuous variables without normal distribution between two or three groups were compared using non- \n\nAny CA-RVs that were not isolated in culture had been tested in a minority of patients (0.9%). We described the positive rates of all kinds of CA-RVs in multiplex RT-PCR tests that were performed based on clinical suspicion of symptomatic CA-RVI in three different groups (Supplementary Table 1 ). The positivity of rhinovirus was higher in both SOT and HSCT recipients than in non-transplant critically ill patients in the ICU (3.9% vs. 2.2%, p Z 0.044). In HSCT recipients, the positive rate of AdV (4.2%) was the most prominent. The positive rates of each CA-RV showed significant differences between three groups for AdV (p < 0.001), hBoV (p < 0.001), PIV3 (p Z 0.005), rhinovirus (p Z 0.044), and RSV A/B (p Z 0.037). Overall CA-RVs positive rates were the highest in HSCT recipients (0.9% of SOT recipients, 1.7% of HSCT recipients and 0.6% of non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU, p Z 0.034) (Supplementary Table 1 ). In the analyses of the total 286 CA-RVI cases, AdV, hBoV, and rhinovirus had significantly different proportions between three groups (p Z 0.039, 0.027, and 0.042, respectively), with the highest frequency in HSCT recipients for AdV and hBoV or in SOT recipients for rhinovirus. The percentage of AdV infection in HSCT recipients (23.0%) was significantly higher compared to that in SOT recipients (11.8%) or in non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU (11.4%). The HSCT recipients (19.7%) had significantly lower percentages of rhinovirus infection than SOT recipients (37.6%) ( Table 1 ).\n\nWe analyzed the characteristics of CA-RVI in three groups, and the impact of CA-RVI on the outcome of all-causes inhospital mortality ( Table 2 ). The most common allograft in CA-RVs-infected SOT recipients was kidney (48.3%), followed by lung (25.3%) and liver (21.8%). In total, 62.3% and 91.8% of CA-RVs-infected HSCT recipients received transplantation from allogeneic donor and stem cell source of peripheral blood, respectively.\n\nThe age, male sex, and total duration of hospital stay at the time of CA-RVI were significantly different among the three groups (p < 0.001, 0.044 and 0.002, respectively). The non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU were the oldest (68 AE 14 year-old) and had stayed in hospital during the longest period, with median of 25 days (IQR, 11e45 days). Total duration of ICU stay was not significantly different between non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU and transplant recipients who had ever received ICU (29.4% of SOT and 29.5% of HSCT recipients). The time interval between transplantation and CA-RVI was significantly longer in SOT recipients than in HSCT recipients (30 [10e107] vs. 20 [11e39] months, p Z 0.035) ( Table 2 and Fig. 2) . The season of CA-RVI incidence was not different between three groups (p Z 0.206). The SOT recipients had the significantly lowest all-cause in-hospital mortality (28.2%) among the three groups (p Z 0.002) ( Table 2 and Fig. 3 ).\n\nThe patients who died in hospital due to any cause of death after CA-RVI were significantly older (62 AE 15 vs. 58 AE 17year-old, p Z 0.023) and had significantly higher percentages of administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (20.8% vs. 3.6%, p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (MV) (78.3% vs. 33.7%, p < 0.001) than those who were alive (Table 3) . Each CA-RV-infected patient had similar rates for all-cause in-hospital death (AdV, 42.5%; hBoV, 40.0%; CoV, 44.7%; hMPV, 42.3%, PIV 1/2/3, 40.0%; rhinovirus, 38.8%, and RSV A/B, 48.5%).\n\nIn the analyses for relation of each CA-RV to all-cause inhospital mortality, three groups infected by any CA-RV did not show significantly different mortality rate (Supplementary Table 2 ). In Cox proportional hazard regression model, MV was independent risk factor associated with higher all-cause in-hospital mortality (HR 3.37, 95% CI 2.04e5.56, p < 0.001). The transplantation was not independently related to mortality (Table 4 ).\n\nThe frequency of each CA-RV except seasonal influenza A/B among the three high-risk groups was heterogeneous despite significant differences in overall frequency, with overall frequency being the highest in HSCT recipients. This study revealed that the proportion of CA-RV species, vulnerable age, and all-cause mortalities in symptomatic CA-RVI were different between SOT and HSCT recipients and non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU group that are populations typically at risk of invasive viral infections. One of our major findings was that AdV caused significantly higher rates of respiratory infection in adult HSCT recipients, as compared to other non-immunocompetent groups. Several studies reported the incidence of, and mortality due to AdV infection in HSCT recipients of 2.7e47% and 4.3e75%, respectively, which were typically higher than SOT recipients, similar to our findings. 4\u00c06,19,23\u00c027 These relatively wide ranges could be due to the characteristics of the study population, including potent conditioning chemotherapy and underlying hematological malignancies, type or repetition of HSCT, era, and occurrence of GVHD. 23, 27 In this study, a large proportion of CA-RVs except seasonal influenza resulted in symptomatic respiratory infection at a late posttransplant period, with median of 20 months in HSCT and 30 months in SOT recipients. Like as previous reports, 1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 28 our data also showed that the posttransplant period in which CA-RVI occurred in SOT recipients was significantly longer than that in HSCT recipients. This finding suggests that physicians need to suspect and diagnosis CA-RVI in transplant recipients with respiratory symptoms regardless of posttransplant period.\n\nAnother important finding of this study was that nontransplant critically ill patients in ICU group had high mortality rates after CA-RVI rather than transplant recipients. Our analyses for mortalities showed the MV as traditional risk factor indicating severity of LRTI was independent risk factors for all-causes in-hospital mortality in three immunosuppressive groups with CA-RVI. The species of CA-RV itself independently did not lead to increase mortality. Even though SOT recipients with all kinds of CA-RVI had the lowest mortality rate in the three high-risk groups, we did not find the independent effect of SOT on all-cause mortality in Cox proportional hazard regression model.\n\nOur data showed that hBoV, a recently emerging CA-RV in transplantation, 29 occurred in only five transplant recipients. Although it has been reported that hBoV can cause severe disseminated infections in infants and children recipients, 30,31 the incidence, attributable mortality, and effect of hBoV on graft in adult recipients remains unclear. 29 A future multicenter observational study will be helpful to verify the role of hBoV in severely immunocompromised patients.\n\nEven though the CA-RV tests showed the lowest positive rate in non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU group, the frequencies of hMPV and RSV A/B infection associated with detrimental outcomes and treated with specific antiviral agent, 4, 5, 19, 32 in this group were not different compared to transplant recipients. Of 432 non-transplant patients with suspected sepsis in the previous study, 12 (2.8%) had RSV A/B and 23 (5.3%) had hMPV. 33 Gr\u00e9ve et al. reported 7 (0.5%) with hMPV and 21 (1.5%) with RSV among 1407 non-transplant patients admitted to the ICU on MV therapy in a prospective multicenter study in 2018. 11 Recent reports support our findings and indicate that hMPV and RSV should not be regarded as negligible pathogens and could be under-diagnosed in non-transplant critically ill patients, in particular on ventilated and ICU care. 11\u00c013,16,34 However, we do not have any consensus that these CA-RVs are directly related to poor outcome and attributable mortality in this population. 11, 12, 34 In addition, there is no standard guideline for prevention or treatment of CA-RVs among transplant recipients and non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU. Therefore, the guideline for indication of surveillance or diagnostic tests as well as treatment of specific CA-RVs in unique high-risk subpopulation through further prospective studies needs to be standardized to implement practices effectively.\n\nThis study has several limitations; (1) CA-RV tests were performed based on the decisions of individual clinicians and not according to a standard uniform protocol or united prescription criteria. This could have resulted in overprescriptions leading to the lower positive rate, as well as under-prescriptions as no suspicion of CA-RVI, (2) retrospective data collection precluded us from obtaining precise incidence rates according to year or season. Nevertheless, comprehensive data with nearly total 40,000 exclusively multiplex RT-PCR tests in our study can be seen as a strength. In addition, the data demonstrated that recipients of SOT or HSCT have different frequencies for CA-RVI compared to non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU, and these three high-risk groups with positive rates of each CA-RV in RT-PCR tests were detected on a large scale at one hospital. The data from one hospital might ensure the homogeneity of severity and consistency of laboratory tests in the study population.\n\nIn conclusions, non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU group with CA-RVI except seasonal influenza A/B had higher all-cause mortality rate than in transplant recipients. CA-RVI except influenza in transplant recipients could occur in the late posttransplant period of several years. Especially, AdV infection was the most prominent in HSCT recipients. This study suggests the importance of suspicion and diagnosis of CA-RVI in transplant recipients even in the late posttransplant period, and non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU with older age, particularly those with MV.\n\nNone.\n\nNone of the authors declares conflicts of interest associated with this manuscript.
