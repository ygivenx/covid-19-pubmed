{"title": "Structural basis of mercury-and zinc-conjugated complexes as SARS-CoV 3C-like protease inhibitors", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to Coronaviridae, which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003. Other members of human coronaviruses include HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63. For SARS-CoV, its 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) functions in the maturation of viral proteins, thus representing an ideal target for therapeutic intervention [1] . Its crystal structure [2, 3] has been determined to assist the design of inhibitors [4, 5] .\n\nWe previously found that some metal ions (e.g., Cu 2+ , Hg 2+ , Zn 2+ ) and their metal-conjugated compounds [phenylmecuric acetate (PMA), toluene-3,4-dithiolato zinc (TDT), and Nethyl-N-phenyldithiocarbamic acid zinc (EPDTC)] showed inhibitory potency in the low or sub-lM range against SARS-CoV 3CL pro [6] . Hg 2+ or Zn 2+ were known to inhibit several viral proteases such as 3CL pro of norovirus, papain-like protease (PLP2) of SARS-CoV, human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) protease and hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Here, to elucidate the metal-inhibitor binding mode and to pursue better inhibitors, we extended our work to two zinc-based inhibitors bis(L L-aspartato-N,O) zinc(II) ethanate (designated as JMF1586) and (nitrilotriacetato-N,O) zinc(II) acetate (designated as JMF1600) and obtained the crystal structures of SARS 3CL pro complexed with PMA, TDT, EPDTC, JMF1586 and JMF1600 to delineate the inhibition modes.\n\nJMF1856 and JMF1600 were prepared according to the following procedure. Et 3 N (10 mmol) was added to a mixture of L L-aspartic acid (10 mmol) or nitrilotriacetic acid (5 mmol) in ethanol. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature, prior to the addition of zinc acetate dihydrate (5 mmol). The white precipitate was collected by filtration, and washed with ethanol and acetone to yield the desired zinc complex. These complexes were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Their molecular formula are shown in Scheme 1.\n\nThe fluorimetric assay was utilized to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL pro and determine their inhibition constants [12] . The K i values of PMA, EPDTC, and TDT against 3CL pro have been reported [6] , and those of JMF1600 and JMF1586 was 0.32 lM and 0.05 lM, respectively.\n\nThe purified SARS-CoV 3CL pro was prepared as described previously [2] . All inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO for crystallization. Using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method, enzyme solution was mixed with inhibitor solutions by a molar ratio of 1:5 for 20 min before combining with equal amounts of reservoir. The 3CL pro -EPDTC crystals were obtained using a reservoir of 10% PEG 6000, 14% DMSO, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 M MES at pH 6.5. The other complex crystals were obtained using 15% PEG 6000, 4-14% DMSO, 0.1 mM DTT, and 0.1 M MES at pH 6.5. The crystals were flash-frozen to 100 K with 20-25% ethylene glycol (vol/vol) as a cryo-protectant. The 3CL pro -JMF1586 data were collected at the wavelength of 1.000 \u00c5 using Taiwan beam line BL12B2 in SPring8 (Japan). Data sets for the other four crystals were collected using the MSC MicroMax 002 equipped with an R-AXIS IV ++ image-plate detector. Diffraction data were processed and scaled using the program HKL2000 [13] .\n\nAbbreviations: BABIM, bis(5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl) methane; EPDTC, N-ethyl-N-phenyldithiocarbamic acid zinc; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; JMF1586, bis(L L-aspartato-N,O) zinc(II) ethanate; JMF1600, (nitrilotriacetato-N,O) zinc(II) acetate; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; PMA, phenylmercuric acetate; TDT, toluene-3,4-dithiolato zinc All crystal structures were determined by molecular replacement method using the program AMoRe [14] , and using Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1Z1J [2] as the search model. The Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) program [15] was used for structure refinement. All manual modifications of the models were performed using the program XtalView [16] . The difference Fourier map (F o \u00c0 F c ) was used to locate the inhibitors and solvent molecules. Data collection and final model statistics are shown in Table S1 . The atomic coordinates and structure factors of 3CL pro -EPDTC, 3CL pro -JMF1600, 3CL pro -JMF1586, 3CL pro -PMA and 3CL pro -TDT have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank codes 2Z9J, 2Z9K, 2Z9L, 2Z9G and 2Z94, respectively.\n\nSARS-CoV 3CL pro is a homodimer with three domains in each monomer. Its active site comprises the His 41 -Cys 145 catalytic dyad located at the cleft between domains I and II, and the third domain contributes to the dimerization of protease [2, 3] (Fig. 1A) . Here, five complex structures were determined. Diffraction data of the 3CL pro -JMF1586 crystal were processed for anomalous signal and exploited to locate the zinc atom sites by calculating anomalous difference Fourier maps. Two major Zn 2+ peaks were located in the active site of each protein molecule in the asymmetric unit. In the 3CL pro -EPDTC, 3CL pro -JMF1600, 3CL pro -JMF1586 complex structures, four DMSO molecules in each dimer derived from the crystallization condition were found. Two were located on the enzyme surface surrounded by the side chains of R 298 , M 6 , and F 8 of each subunit. The second pair of DMSO molecules was bound in the S1 pocket, which consists of the side chains of H 163 and F 140 and the main-chains of M 165 , E 166 and H 172 . The oxygen atom of DMSO is hydrogen bonded to the imidazole side chain of H 163 with a mean distance of 2.55 \u00c5 (Fig. 1A,B) .\n\nIn the 3CL pro -PMA complex structure, the phenyl-bound mercury is bound to the sulfur atom of residue C 44 with the bond distance of 2.5 \u00c5 , and the phenolic oxygen atom of Y 54 and sulfur atom of M 49 serve as the other two ligands to form a square planar geometry with Hg-O and Hg-S bond lengths of 2.6 \u00c5 and 3.5 \u00c5 , respectively (Fig. 1C) . The observed electron density of the inhibitor is well defined for mercury and the phenyl group, but the acetate group of PMA was dissociated and replaced by protein ligands. Furthermore, the phenyl group of PMA occupying the S3 pocket contacts the side chain of H 41 , causing its imidazole ring to rotate to form a hydrogen bond (3.0 \u00c5 ) with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of H 164 (Fig. 1D) . Comparison of 3CL pro -PMA with the native-3CL pro (PDB code 1Z1I) [2] structure reveals a significant conformational change of residues 43-51, indicating its flexibility for PMA entry to and binding at the S3 pocket.\n\nTDT is bound to the catalytic dyad residues H 41 and C 145 acting to inhibit the enzyme's activity (Fig. 2A) . The zinc atom of TDT is coordinated to the side chain nitrogen atom of H 41 and the sulfur atom of C 145 with a distorted tetrahedral geometry despite a rigid S-Zn-S bond angle of 93.3\u00b0 (Fig. 2E) . The toluene group of TDT has no interaction with the protein. The inhibition mode of EPDTC is the same as that of TDT regarding the zinc atom coordination to two sulfur atoms and two Scheme 1. Chemical structures and inhibition parameters of inhibitors. PMA is a mercury-conjugated compound, whereas TDT, EPDTC, JMF1586 and JMF1600 are zinc-conjugates. The respective inhibition constants (K i ) for SARS-CoV 3CL pro are also indicated. side chains of H 41 and C 145 (Fig. 2B) . Nonetheless, the local metal center geometry of EPDTC, unlike that of TDT, is that the zinc ion binds to H 41 and C 145 in a more typical zinc tetrahedral geometry with the S-Zn-S bond angle of 107.2\u00b0 (  Fig. 2F) . Moreover, the electron density map of the zinc atom and two sulfur atoms of EPDTC can be clearly seen in each subunit, yet the bulky substituent groups are absent (Fig. S1 ). The lack of electron density might suggest that the substituents are disordered. We have performed a computer modeling study to address the question whether the bulky substituents impede the binding of the complex. Fig. S2 shows that the entire EPDTC could be accommodated in the active site pocket, with sufficient room for the bulky side groups to rotate about. Therefore conformational disorder of side chains remains a likely possibility.\n\nactivity JMF1600 and JMF1586 showed smaller K i value (0.32 lM and 0.05 lM, respectively) for inhibiting SARS-3CL pro than that of Zn 2+ (1.1 lM) [6] by 3-and 20-fold, respectively (Scheme 1), with JMF1586 exhibiting the highest inhibition activity. In the 3CL pro -JMF1586 complex, the zinc-centered tetrahedral coordination is formed by H 41 , C 145 and two nitrogen atoms. On the other hand, H 41 , C 145 , one nitrogen atom and a water molecule are responsible for the Zn coordination in the 3CL pro -JMF1600 complex (Fig. 2C,D) . Scheme 1 shows that the zinc atom is chelated by two nitrogen and two oxygen atoms for JMF1586, and by one nitrogen and three oxygen atoms for JMF1600. The Zn-N bond is stronger than the Zn-O bond, consistent with the lower K i value for JMF1586. Both structures indicate that the metal-oxygen bond of JMF1586 and JMF1600 must break prior to being substituted by H 41 and C 145 in the formation of the zinc-centered complex. Like the case above, the electron densities of the zinc ions and nitrogen atoms of JMF1586 and JMF1600 were visible, but not those for the substituent groups (Fig. S1 ).\n\nIn this study, five crystal structures allow us to identify ligand binding regions of metal-conjugated compounds as inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . The 3CL pro -PMA structure reveals that a phenyl-bound mercury occupying the S3 pocket is responsible for inhibiting the enzymatic activity. One SARS-CoV 3CL pro molecule contains 12 free cysteine-SH residues, in which only C 44 , but not the active site C 145 , provides a specific coordination environment for the phenyl-bound mercury. Inorganic Hg ion is known to cause toxic effects, since the affinity of Hg(II) ion to thiol group in proteins lead to non-specific inhibition of cellular enzymes [17] . Therefore, structural studies of the specific interaction between mercury-conjugated compounds and the thiol groups of cysteine-containing enzyme may be valuable for the future development of specific inhibitors. The zinc inhibitors are coordinated to the catalytic dyad with the zinc ion surrounded by a tetrahedral or distorted tetrahedral arrangement of ligands. A DMSO molecule located at the S1 pocket was observed in the latter three crystals B, C and D, colored as in Fig. 1D . In all complexes, DMSO and inhibitors carbon atoms are green. The zinc ions are depicted as a yellow sphere. (E-H) Schematic representation of zinc-centered geometry in active sites. The zinc centered coordination is N His S Cys S2 for 3CL pro -TDT and 3CL pro -EPDTC, N His S Cys N2 for 3CL pro -JMF1586, and N His S Cys ON for 3CL pro -JMF1600. The bond lengths and bond angles are also indicated.\n\nRegarding the structures of the zinc-centered complexes, the zinc ion plays a key role in targeting the catalytic residues, via binding to the H 41 -C 145 catalytic dyad to yield a zinc-central tetrahedral geometry. This type of inhibition is similar to the zinc-mediated serine protease inhibitor keto-BABIM-Zn 2+ for trypsin in that a zinc ion is coordinated to two chelating nitrogen atoms of bis(5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl) methane (BABIM) and two catalytic residues (Ser-His) of trypsin in a tetrahedral geometry [18] . However, this zinc-centered inhibition mode has never been described before for cysteine protease. The safety of zinc-containing compounds for human use is indicated by the fact that zinc acetate and zinc sulfate are added as a supplement to the drug for the treatment of Wilson's disease and Behcet's disease, respectively [19, 20] . The possibility of zinc complexes incorporated into cells through the cell membrane is also demonstrated by the studies on type 2 diabetic treatment [21] . Here, our results show that the zinccentered coordination pattern would serve as a starting platform for inhibitor optimization and the development of potential drug for SARS therapies. Since 3C and 3CL proteases with the Cys-His catalytic residues have been found in several human viruses such as the family of Coronaviridae, and Arteriviridae [22, 23] , these proteases can be targets for the zinc derivatized inhibitors."}
