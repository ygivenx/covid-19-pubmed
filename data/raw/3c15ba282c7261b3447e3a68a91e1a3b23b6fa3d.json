{"title": "In-flight Transmission Cluster of COVID-19: A Retrospective Case Series Running title: In-flight Transmission Cluster of COVID-19", "body": "more than 50000 cases have been reported [6] . Further rapid increases are expected to continue for some time.\n\nThe COVID-19 spreads rapidly around the world, largely because of persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 traveled on aircraft to other countries, since SARS-Cov-2 has strong affinity to human respiratory receptors [8] . No data were available about the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on aircraft and clinical characteristics and outcomes of these COVID-19 patients. Here, we conducted a retrospective research to describe the clinical characteristics in an attempt to recognize the features of COVID-19 infected on aircraft.\n\nSince the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China, strict precautionary measures are implemented. Especially, Zhejiang provincial government initially launched a Category A response -a response to a major public health emergency -in the morning of 23 th January 2020. In one day, a commercial aircraft carrying 325 passengers and crew members flew to Hangzhou International Airport in Zhejiang. Most passengers were Chinese tourists and were returning home.

None of them were symptomatic. Most passengers had taken no precautionary measures against possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2, while all the flight attendants well wore masks. During the flight, a man passenger (patient 1) who traveled from Wuhan had a fever and no respiratory symptoms. Also, he did not wear a mask. After the 5-hour flight, the plane arrived in Hangzhou at 10 pm. Considering there were some Wuhan citizens on aircraft, staffs from the Hangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had been on standby at the airport and once the aircraft arrived they boarded to screen for possible fever and respiratory symptoms amongst the passengers and crew members. They had found that patient 1 still had a fever and his temperature was 38.1 . Then, his throat swab specimens were collected and sent to CDC. Five hours later, he was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was admitted into the designated hospital. The crew members and rest of the passengers were placed under isolation and routine medical checks at hotels near airport for 14 days to observe whether illness onset will happen. As shown in figure 1, a further nine passengers were successively tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were also admitted. Another two passengers were also tested positively but we failed to interview them. No further patients were All rights reserved.

Then they were released from quarantine.\n\nWe conducted a retrospective study focused on the clinical characteristics of ten patients with COVID-19 successively admitted to Xiaoshan First People's Hospital after having been on a flight. Patients were diagnosed based on National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China guidelines and the WHO interim guidance [9, 10] . For the ten patients included in our study, there was no recognized exposure history in 14 days before this fight. The incubation period was defined as the time from the flight arrival day to the onset of illness. Hospitalized days were defined as the period from admission to discharge day. The study has been reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committees of Xiaoshan First people's Hospital (Approval NO: 2020-02). Written informed consent were waived because of the urgent need to collect clinical data on this emerging disease and entirely anonymized data therefore the individual identity cannot be identified.\n\nEpidemiology data were collected by interviewing each patient including exposure history, dates of illness onset, hospital admissions and All rights reserved.

Clinical information, including symptoms, chest CT images and therapy during hospital stay, laboratory results on admission, were retrospectively collected from their medical records. Two experienced radiologists (Y. Fu; X. Jian) reviewed all chest CT images and positive/negative findings and radiological features were decided by consensus. Both epidemiology data and clinical information were sent to two experienced physicians (G. Qian; N. Yang). If information were unclear or missing, we clarified the details with the attendant doctors who were treating these patients.\n\nThroat swab specimens collected from all patients were sent to CDC and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR using the established sets of primers [11] . Outcomes were ready in three hours. Laboratory confirmation was achieved when the result of RT-PCR was positive.\n\nLaboratory tests conducted on the day of admission included blood cell count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, serum chemistry, D-dimer, fibrinogen in coagulation test, liver and renal function, electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase. Each of five lung lobes were assessed for degree of involvement and classified as none (0%) with a score of 0, minimal (1-25%) with a score of 1, mild (26-50%) with a score of 2, moderate All rights reserved.

An overall lung \"total severity score\" was reached by summing the five lobes scores (range of possible scores, 0-20) [12] .\n\nAll Patients received antiviral treatment with Arbidol (200mg twice daily, in ten patients), either in combination with Lopinavir/Ritonavir (400mg/100mg twice daily, in seven patients) or Darunavir/Cobicistat (800mg/150mg once daily in three patients). Patients were treated with corticosteroid (40-80mg) when their resting respiratory rate were more than 30 per minutes or when multiple pulmonary lobes showed more than 50% progression of disease on chest CT imaging in two days. Oxygen supports via nasal cannula were given when oxygen saturations were below 93% without oxygen support. Patients were discharged from hospital when the results of two RT-PCR tests taken 24 hours apart were negative for SARS-CoV-2 and symptoms improved obviously according to China guidelines 10 . MuLBSTA scores were assessed and recorded by attending physicians based on six indexes [13].\n\nWe summarized continuous variables as medians (interquartile ranges, IQR).

All analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS statistics software, version 26.0.\n\nBy 28 th February, clinical data had been collected on all ten patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. No flight attendants have been infected.\n\nIn 14 days prior to the flight, no one including patient 1 had been exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.\n\nAs shown in Table 1 , the median incubation period was 3.0 (IQR, 2-7; ranged from 1 to 14 or longer) days and from illness onset to hospital admission was 2 (IQR, 1-4; ranged from 1 to 6) days. The median age was 33 (IQR, 26 to 42; ranged from 20 to 52), and 70% were females and none was pregnant. None of them was health worker.\n\nOf the ten patients, two patients (patient 9 and 10) were asymptomatic and negative for chest CT scan throughout the disease course. In the other eight patients, the most common symptoms were fever in 7 (70%) patients. Among them, 5 (50%) patients had temperature between 37.3-39 , while 2 (20%) patients were above 39 .

Table 2 shows the laboratory findings on admission. Elevated C-reactive protein (>4mg/L) was seen in 7 (70%) patients, while leucopenia (white blood cell count <3.5\u0d4810 9 /L) and lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <1.1\u0d4810 9 /L) was observed in 1 (10%) patient, respectively. Decreased platelet levels (<125\u0d4810 9 /L) were detected in 2 (20%) patients. All the procalcitonin levels were within normal range at less than 0.5\u03bcg/L. No patient had an increased level of aspartate aminotransferase. Decreased level of potassium with 2.5mmol/L and increased level of D-dimer with 1.78mg/L were documented in 1 (10%) patient. Two (20%) patients had slight increased levels of fibrinogen (normal range, 2-4g/L).\n\nAs shown in table 3, two of the ten patients had no pneumonia throughout the disease course. Typical CT findings of pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass opacities, especially with peripheral lung distribution, were seen in the other 8 patients. Among of them, bilateral lung involvements were seen in 7 patients while unilateral left lung involvement was seen in 1 patient. The most frequently involved lobe was left lower lobe in all the above 8 (80%) patients and right lower lobe in 7 (70%) patients. Of the 7 patients with CT images of bilateral pulmonary parenchymal groundglass opacities, consolidations were also seen in 4 patients. Notably, \"Crazy-Paving\" pattern, pleural effusion (Figure 2) , and ground-glass nodules were also seen in some patients.\n\nThe median number of lobes with lung opacities involvement was 4 (IQR, 1-5; range from 0 to 5). The median lung \"total severity score\" was 6 (IQR, 1-9; range from 0 to 13).\n\nOn admission, initial RT-PCRs on admission were positive in 9 (90%) patients, however initial chest CT were positive in only half of the ten patients. In the patient with negative initial RT-PCT, the result was positive on the third time after a week following illness onset.\n\nAll patients received antiviral treatment. All received Arbidol. Lopinavir/ Ritonavir was administered to in 7 patients alongside with Darunavir/ Cobicistat in 3 patients, and alongside with Oseltamivir in 3 patients.\n\nFour patients were given empirical antibiotic treatment, 3 patients were given systematic corticosteroid treatment, and 3 patients were given All rights reserved.

Five patients were treated with traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Interferon alpha inhalation and Chloroquine were not administered to our patients.\n\nAs shown in table 4, none of the patient was ever admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, 9 (90%) patients were discharged, and one patient was still isolated in our hospital. The median hospitalized days were 20 (IQR, 13-22; ranged from 13 to 22) of the 9 discharged patients.\n\nThe median MuLBSTA score was 4.5(IQR, 0-5; range from 0 to 5).\n\nTo estimate the risk of aircraft transmission, we calculated the numbers of persons diagnosed with COVID-19 divided by the total number of persons on this flight, the result is 3.69% (12/325).\n\nHere, we report clinical data from ten passengers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 after having been on a flight.

Notably, the symptoms of COVID-19 patients infected in this flight were relatively mild, outcomes were inclined to be better, and the risk to passengers was higher compared with transmission of SARS on aircraft [15-17].\n\nThe imaging manifestations of these patients with COVID-19 transmission on aircraft were similar to those without in-flight history, as previously reported [12] . Pleural effusion was rarely seen amongst COVID-19 patients [18, 19] . In this case, for the first time we report small volumes of pleural effusion in both lungs in a non-severe patient of COVID-19. Moreover, 9 patients were tested RT-PCR positive at admission while only 5 patients were chest CT scan positive at admission, indicating that RT-PCR has a higher sensitivity than chest CT scans in diagnosing COVID-19 in our study.\n\nPatients in our cohort received antiviral treatment, but the types of medicine prescribed varied between patients based on their conditions. All of them received Arbidol. Use of Lopinavir combined with Ritonavia were considered to be beneficial because they had the potential to treat SARS [20] .

Currently, there is no widely recognized effective drug treatment exists. As, to date, no results of randomized controlled studies on these drugs in COVID-19 patients have been conducted, it was unclear whether their improvement were due to these individual drugs or some combination of them.

These measures must abide to before boarding, during the flight and after disembarkation while the global pandemic of COVID-19 is occurring.\n\nOur study is limited by the retrospective method and sample size. Several issues should be taken into consideration when reading the results. Firstly, we tried to obtain the passenger rosters, their seats assignments, and contact information during this flight from the Scoot airline in Singapore, as well as from the Health Commission and CDC of Hangzhou, but failed. Therefore, we could not confirm that whether the transmission of COVID-19 amongst passengers occurred before boarding (having a feature that patients being randomly distributed throughout the aircraft) or while on board in the aircraft (having a feature that clustered patients were seated in the same row or within two rows in front of or behind index patient). The WHO working definition of a contact on a flight is any passenger seated in the same row of seats or within two seats in front of or behind the index patient, or any flight attendant.\n\n[30] Secondly, there were two asymptomatic patients reported in our study. We agreed that more asymptomatic carriers might be found out if all the other passengers and crew members were tested with RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 before they were released from quarantine.

[3, 31] A possible explanation for this aircraft transmission is there was a presymptomatic or asymptomatic flight attendant who mediated transmission between passengers, although we believe it was less likely as the flight attendants were wearing masks.\n\nThirdly, information about the physical proximity to the index patient were unavailable, therefore we could not quantify the exact risk of in-flight transmission, especially whether degree of illness in passengers was consistent with the physical proximity to the index patient(s).\n\naddressed in all anecdotal reports on COVID-19 outbreak.
