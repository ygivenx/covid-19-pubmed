{"title": "Investigating Gastroenteritis: The Merseyside Experience 1983-1987", "body": "The control of gastroenteritis associated with bacterial, protozoal and viral infection of the alimentary tract is a major public health responsibility. Although vomiting and diarrhoea of short duration in individuals is common and not a serious problem, spread of infection by the faecal-oral route may lead to outbreaks with numerous cases in families, institutions including hospitals, day nurseries and schools and among persons attending large social functions. Gastroenteritis associated with rapid fluid loss may be life-threatening particularly in the very young and very old and prevention is very important in, for example, maternity and special care baby units and in geriatric wards. Laboratory investigations show that a wide range of micro-organisms may be responsible for outbreaks of gastroenteritis some of which have only recently been added to the list of those taken into account by microbiologists carrying out tests on faecal samples. Thus, to long-recognised organisms such as Salmonella, Shigella, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EEC), Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus and Giardia lamblia must now be added others including Campylobacter, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas hydrophila, enterotoxigenic (ETC), enteroinvasive (EIC) and verotoxin-producing strains of E. coli, Clostridium difficile, Bacillus cereus, Cryptosporidium and enteropathogenic viruses including, most commonly, rotavirus and Norwalk virus. Travellers from abroad may be infected with Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus or Entamoeba histolytica.\n\nLaboratory investigations are thus expensive and time-consuming but are necessary to establish the source of an outbreak and to prevent further spread or recurrence of the problem. Identification of the causative organism will also enable a decision to be made about specific chemotherapy which is required in G. lamblia infection and may be indicated in other cases associated with severe systemic illness, for example, salmonella bacteraemia. Moreover monitoring of the prevalence of gastroenteritis and the causative agents reveals changes reflecting, for example, altered dietary habits and other social factors. These include the greatly increased consumption of mass-produced food of animal origin, notably poultry, and the much larger proportion of people who take holidays abroad during the summer. We have analysed the results of the laboratory investigation of gastroenteritis in the Merseyside conurbation consisting of 5 boroughs with a population of about 1\u00bd million in the 5 years 1983-1987.\n\nFaecal samples or, in some cases rectal swabs (for culture only), were received by Liverpool Public Health Laboratory (PHL) from general practitioners and environmental health departments in the 5 Merseyside boroughs, Knowsley, Liverpool, St. Helens, Sefton and Wirral, with a total population of about 121 million, and from the Mersey Regional Infectious Diseases Unit and other departments of Fazakerley Hospital Liverpool (1,000 beds). Microbiology departments of most of the other hospitals in the area submitted cultures to PHL for identification. These were mainly salmonellas isolated from specimens submitted by general practitioners through open access to hospital laboratories. Faecal samples for electron microscopy were also referred by hospital microbiology departments to PHL from cases of suspected viral gastroenteritis, the majority from ward outbreaks.\n\nAll first faecal samples from patients with gastroenteritis were cultured for Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter and, if from infants up to 2 years old, enteropathogenic E. coil. Microscopy and culture for other bacteria were also undertaken when indicated by information accompanying the sample. In cases of Bacillus cereus, CI. perfringens or Staph. aureus food poisoning, these organisms were only sought in faeces if incriminated food was also available for examination.\n\nThe total numbers of specimens each year from 1983 to 1987, including positive cultures referred by hospital laboratories were:   1983  8,607  1984  8,313  1985  6,334  1986  7,308  1987  4,696   Total  35,258  Up to August 1984, when the practice ceased, women admitted to the Maternity Unit,  Fazakerley Hospital, were screened for salmonella excretion representing nearly 4,000 specimens per annum. This was discontinued because over a 9-year period only 60 (0.2%) of 30471 women screened were salmonella-positive and only 7 of the 60 babies excreted salmonellas, l Reduced numbers in 1987 compared with 1985 and 1986 reflected the absence of major outbreaks in the later year. During the period under review however the workload per specimen increased with introduction of additional special techniques for the detection of Cl. difficile and its toxin, Cryptosporidium and, in 1987, Aeromonas and Yersinia.\n\nCultures of Salmonella were sent for serotyping and/or phage typing to Division of Enteric Pathogens (DEP), Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, London. Cultures of Shigella other than sonnei were also sent to DEP for serotyping.\n\nDetails of each patient's home address, age, sex and, in some cases, illness were available from the specimen request form or were obtained, if possible, by telephone. Questionnaires in respect of salmonella-positive patients were sent to the doctors concerned and also in the case of outbreaks of infection of any kind requesting information about number of patients with symptoms or found to be positive for the causative organism.\n\nControl of salmonella infections in man depends on identification of sources of infection usually foods of animal origin. Infection by person-to-person transmission is less common, except in, for example, clinical situations involving infants or elderly and incontinent persons or, in the household, close family contacts. By antigenic analysis about 2,000 Salmonella serotypes can be identified and the more common of these have been further divided in phage types (PT's). Thus there are 232 PT's of S. typhimurium and 32 PT's of S. enteritidis but in both cases a small minority of the PT's account for most of the infections in man. Accurate recognition of sources of infection depends on the use of these typing systems to 'finger-print' salmonellas which are widely distributed, often without causing disease, in animals that are sources of human food such as cattle, pigs or poultry and, as a result, frequently cause infection in man when there are lapses in standards of cooking or hygiene. Epidemiological typing is therefore an essential part of the laboratory investigation of salmonella infections.\n\nThe numbers of patients from whom salmonellas other than S. typhi and S. paratyphi were isolated annually from 1983 to 1987 are showr, in Table I together with the numbers of the serotypes most frequently isolated. The main change in the distribution of Salmonella serotypes in the period under review was the emergence of S. enteritidis as a rival to S. typhimurium which has occupied first place for many years. Of the S. enteritidis isolates PT4 predominated accounting for 127 (71%) of 179 cases in 1986 (including a hospital outbreak of 37 cases) and 73 (78%) of 94 in 1987. This is the enteritidis PT most commonly isolated from chickens and eggs including some batches of liquid egg and these are probably the food sources mainly responsible for the rapid increase in human S. enteritidis infections. There was however an outbreak of 12 cases of S. enteritidis PT8 infection in 1985 at an old people's home and 35 cases of S. enteritidis PT6 in 1986 including many in travellers returning from Spain and Portugal.\n\nThe high proportion of the enteritidis serotype among salmonellas acquired by holdiday-makers in these two countries (Table II) (Table IV) . The total numbers of cases for each year from 1983 to 1987 is substantially less than those of Salmonella infections (Table I) but the impact of Campylobacter infections in the community is certainly underestimated in Table   IV . This is because campylobacters isolated in hospital laboratories from specimens submitted by general practitioners were not from large outbreaks and were not usually referred to PHLS for biotyping and serotyping. This is in sharp contrast to the practice in most hospital laboratories of submitting all Salmonella cultures to PHL for further investigation including many from general practitioner patients. Where a direct comparison of the prevalence of the two infections is possible it is noteworthy that between 1983 and 1987, 253 cases of Campylobaeter infection were admitted to Fazakerley Hospital, nearly all to the Regional Infectious Diseases Unit and the comparable figure for\n\nSalmonella cases was 209. In 1987 an outbreak of milk-associated gastroenteritis-at a residential school affected 296 children and 17 adults. At Liverpool PHL Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from 16 of 17 patients investigated and positive cultures from 7 other patients were received from hospital laboratories. (Table VI) Verotoxin-producing E. coli 0157:H7 the cause of haemorrhagic colitis was sought in selected cases in 1987 but none were positive.\n\nThe protozoa most commonly associated with gastroenteritis in UK are Giardia lamblia detected by wet-film microscopy of faecal samples and Cryptosporidium newly recognised as a human pathogen 5 and also detected by microscopy of faecal samples after special staining. The number of positive cases of these two infections diagnosed at Liverpool PHL are shown in Table VII .\n\nThe peak age group for G. lamblia infections was the pre-school, including day nursery, group aged 1-4 years but many cases also occurred in adults, 1(~59 years (Table VIII) . Among the latter there were 7 instances identified of patients whose children were infected with Giardia. In 1985 there was an outbreak at a Liverpool day nursery involving 5 children aged 20 months to 3 years, 3 of whom were also excreting enteropathogenic E. coll. The distribution of positive cases in the 4 quarters of the year was respectively 44, 35, 74, 58, i.e. higher in July to September than in the rest of the year. Some cases were associated with foreign travel. \n\nYersinia enterocolitica is regarded as an important cause of gastroenteritis in some Western European countries. In 1987 faecal samples from patients with diarrhoea were tested for Yersinia in parallel with tests for Aeromonas but only 3 were positive for Yersinia spp.\n\nPatients with gastrointestinal symptoms recently arrived from Asia or from other countries known to have cholera cases were tested for Vibrio spp. Between 1983 and 1987, none were positive for V. cholerae but 11. parahaemolyticus was isolated from one patient with diarrhoea after arriving by air from Bangkok.\n\nDiarrhoea is a common complication of antibiotic treatment and probably associated in many cases with overgrowth in the bowel of CI. difficile with production of sufficient toxin to cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Tests for this organism and its toxins are however recommended only for the more severe cases including those presenting as pseudomembranous colitis. They are largely confined to hospital practice where outbreaks occasionally occur involving cross-infection in wards for elderly or immunocompromised patients. During the period under review Liverpool PHL identified 61 positive patients in hospitals but only 4 from general practitioners.\n\nDiagnosis of food-poisoning caused by Bacillus cereus, Clostridiurn perfringens or enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus depends on demonstration of large numbers of the causative organism in food consumed by those affected. Between 1983 and 1987 there were 5 major episodes of food-poisoning in which one of these organisms was identified as responsible.\n\nMost viruses associated with gastroenteritis cannot be isolated by tissue culture methods and their detection depends on the use of electron microscopy or, in the case of rotavirus, demonstration of specific antigen by, for example, enzyme immunoassay. These methods require, however, the presence in faecal samples of relatively large amounts of virus and specimens must be collected in the acute phase of the illness for there to be much chance of a positive result.\n\nDuring 1986 and 1987, faecal samples from 2,529 patients were examined by electron microscopy at Liverpool PHL. The samples selected for this examination were mainly from those patients with gastroenteritis in whom no bacterial or protozoal agents had been demonstrated and which had been collected within a few days of the date of onset of illness. The patients investigated included those involved in 24 outbreaks of gastroenteritis in the community, 3 in childrens' units, 21 in homes for old people, and 27 outbreaks in hospitals, 2 in paediatric, 2 ! in geriatric and 4 in general wards. Rotavirus or Norwalk virus were detected in 9 (18%) of the 51 outbreaks investigated (Table IX) , \n\nIt is clear that control of gastroenteritis in the community is an important aspect of preventive medicine. In severe cases the symptoms are very distressing and the illness may be life-threatening particularly in the very young and very old. At all ages however there may be serious social disruption. Persons affected must take time off work or school and exclusion, for a time, of employees in high-risk occupations such as nursing or food-handling is necessary. Children have to be excluded from day nurseries and schools affecting attendance of parents at work. Gastrointestinal infection acquired at a social function is a disaster when large numbers of guests are affected. Gastroenteritis is often a disturbing accompaniment or aftermath of foreign travel. In this survey in an almost entirely urban area we draw attention to the many infective agents which have to be considered in the laboratory investigation of cases and outbreaks of gastroenteritis. The examination of faecal samples in the microbiology laboratory is becoming increasingly complex requiring as it does the use of additional new techniques for previously unrecognised bacterial, viral and protozoal causes of gastroenteritis including, in the last two decades, Campylobacter, Clostridium di~cile, rotavirus, Norwalk virus and Cryptosporidium. To cover all, or most, possibilities it is now necessary to employ a wide range of techniques which may include as many as 12 different solid or liquid culture media incubated aerobically and anaerobically and at 3 different incubator temperatures, 30\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C and 43\u00b0C; light microscopy of stained and unstained preparations; electron microscopy and either tissue culture or latex agglutination for detection of bacterial toxin. In addition to work in the laboratory that receives the specimens, it is necessary in some cases for specialised investigations to be undertaken by the Division of Enteric Pathogens, Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale Avenue (DEP) including tests for enterotoxin and epidemiological typing, for example, phage typing which may be necessary to define the source and pattern of spread of an outbreak. An example of this was the nationwide outbreak early in 1988 of Salmonella typhimurium PT124 infections traced to imported salami and halted after investigation by Communicable Diseases Surveillance Centre (CDSC) based on case-control studies of patients from whom this STM phage type had been isolated. Plasmid profiles may also be used increasingly in future in this field.\n\nIt may be argued that laboratory investigation of gastroenteritis is often unnecessary because, for most cases, specific chemotherapy is not recommended and because in 'high-risk' situations persons with diarrhoea are excluded irrespective of the results of laboratory tests. It is important however to take into account that specific treatment is required for patients with Giardia lamblia infections including symptomless carriers often identified among contacts of clinical cases. Also the epidemiology of gastroenteritis caused by different organisms varies so much that it is necessary to identify the agent responsible for an outbreak before appropriate and effective measures can be taken to bring it under control and prevent a recurrence. Precise identification of the cause of cases of gastroenteritis can only be achieved by microbiological examination of faecal samples or, in the case of some types of food-poisoning, the food thought to be responsible for the illness. In some food-related outbreaks, the length of the incubation period may give an important clue to the diagnosis, for example, 2 to 4 hours for staphylococcal food-poisoning, but laboratory investigation is necessary to identify the source of infection with certainty.\n\nSuch investigations are expensive and in the face of increasing pressure to economise it is of paramount importance that the best use should be made of the resources available. To this end laboratory work should be based on as much information as possible about the illness under investigation. We advise medical staff, environmental health officers and others who submit specimens to the laboratory that the information accompanying them should include:\n\n1. Home address, age and sex of patient. 2. Nature of symptoms and date of onset. 3. Whether illness associated with a particular food or meal and if so the incubation period before onset of symptoms. 4. Whether patient has recently been in contact with similar cases. 5. Whether patient has recently been abroad and if so where. 6. Whether patient has been in hospital or been given antibiotic treatment recently. If this information is lacking the causative organism may not be identified because the appropriate techniques have not been used. If, on the other hand, it is available it may be possible for staff from the laboratory to suggest further investigations including collection of additional specimens from likely sources of infection. The information provided may also reveal evidence of a link with other cases under investigation in the laboratory or, through CDSC, with cases in other parts of the country. Data derived from tests on large numbers of patients can also be used in the longer term to monitor changing trends in the incidence of different types of gastroenteritis in the area served by the laboratory and at national level through transmission of data to CDSC. 6 "}
