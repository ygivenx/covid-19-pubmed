{"title": "The epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19", "body": "There is a current worldwide outbreak of a new type of coronavirus , which originated from Wuhan, China and has now spread to 140 other countries, including Japan, Korea and Italy. The WHO declared that COVID-19 has become a global health concern, causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spread to humans via transmission from wild animals illegally sold in the Huanan Seafood\n\nWholesale Market. Phylogenetic analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 is a new member of the Coronaviridae family but is distinct from SARS-CoV (identity of approximately 79%) and MERS-CoV (identity of approximately 50%) [1, 2] . Knowing the origin of such a pathogen is critical to developing means to block further transmission and vaccines [3] . Notably, SARS-CoV-2 shares a high level of genetic similarity (96.3%) with the bat coronavirus RaTG13, which was obtained from bats in Yunnan in 2013; however, bats are not the immediate source of SARS-CoV-2 [4] .\n\nThe typical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, sore throat, fatigue, cough or dyspnea coupled with recent exposure. As of March 16 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 generated 168, 826 confirmed cases, including 6, 503 deaths worldwide. In China during the outbreak of the pandemic 42,000 doctors and nurses from all over the country supported Wuhan. Moreover, the government shared the updated genome sequence of COVID-19 to the public, and scientists from China and overseas are working closely and efficiently on this public health emergency [5, 6] . Due to interventions and control measures from the government (shutting down public transportation and implementing a treatment strategy) and the reaction of personal behaviors (wearing masks and reducing contact with others), the number of confirmed and suspected cases has started to decrease.\n\nHowever, the transmission of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV- 2 has not yet been completely eliminated. The COVID-19 outbreak is still a major challenge for clinicians. The aim of this article is to describe the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation and treatment of COVID-19.\n\nEarly transmission dynamics of COVID-19 reveal that the mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days [7] . Another study later using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases had a similar mean incubation period, which was 6.4 days (95% CI: 5.6-7.7) [8] . An unusual case was reported, in which the incubation period was as long as 19 days [9] . Notably, a long incubation time means adjustments in screening and control policies [10] . The 19-day incubation period is a low probability event, and experts suggest 14 days for quarantine.\n\nThe basic reproduction number is model-based and largely depends on the epidemiological setting and the most important parameter to determine the intrinsic transmissibility. The early outbreak data largely follow exponential growth. Different models based on the clinical progression of the disease were devised to estimate the basic reproductive number. In the early stages of COVID-19, the pandemic doubled in size every 7.4 days, and the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 [7] . Another study estimated a similar reproductive number, which ranged from 2.24 to 3.58 [11] . However, a deterministic compartmental model devised based on the likelihood and a model analysis showed that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 [12] . As noted in the paper, this basic reproductive number is higher because the estimation accounts for three to four generations of viral transmission and intensive social contacts. The basic reproductive number estimated by the majority of studies ranges from 2.24 to 3.58 [13] , which is slightly higher than that of SARS.\n\nRapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 is crucial in controlling outbreaks in the community and in hospitals [14] . Current diagnostic tests for coronavirus include reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rRT-PCR), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) [15, 16] . RT-LAMP has similar sensitivity as real time RT-PCR. It is also highly specific and is used to detect MERS-CoV [17, 18] . According to current diagnostic criteria founded by the China National Health Commission, laboratory examinations, including nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab tests, have become a standard assessment for the diagnosis of a COVID-19 infection. To identify patients earlier, two one-step qRT-PCR assays were developed to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome [19] . Three novel RT-PCR assays targeting the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were developed. Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro, of which the highly sensitive and specific may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 [20] . SARS-CoV E gene assay was more sensitive than RdRp gene assay combined with the one-step RT-PCR system [21] . The E gene PCR is sufficient for diagnosing a SARS-CoV-2 infection but the RdRp protocol was recommended for the confirmation of a positive result [22, 23] . The overall positive rate of RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 4, 880 cases from one hospital in Wuhan was 38% [24] . The positive rate of PCR for oropharyngeal swabs is not very high, and only 53.3% of COVID-19-confirmed patients had oral swabs tests that were positive [25] . In a series of 51 COVID-19-confirmed patients, 71% patients were RT-PCR positive at the first time of testing of throat swab or sputum samples [26] . Usually, after several days (2-8 days) , the RT-PCR results become positive [27] .\n\nAutomated solutions for molecular diagnostics can help handle large numbers of samples and can be scaled to keep pace with fluctuating demand [28] [29] [30] . The good analytical performance of a molecular assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on a high-throughput platform, the cobas 6800, was observed with minimal hands-on time, while offering fast and reliable results [31, 32] .The current laboratory test is time-consuming, and a shortage of commercial kits also intensifies the delayed diagnosis. If the patients suffered from fever, sore throat, fatigue, coughing or dyspnea that is coupled with recent exposure, COVID-19 infection should be diagnosed with typical CT characteristics despite negative RT-PCR results. [33] Of 1, 014 patients, 59% had positive RT-PCR results, and 88% had positive chest CT scans. [34] . belongs to the Coronaviridae family. It is not surprising that COVID-19 has imaging findings that are similar to those for SARS CoV and MERS-CoV [35] . Typical CT findings included bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, sometimes with a rounded morphology and peripheral lung distribution [33] . Eighty-six percent of patients showed ground-glass opacities or consolidation, and more than one lobe (71%) with bilateral involvement (76%) was affected by the 21 initial chest CT scans [36] . Notably, lung cavitation, discrete pulmonary nodules, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy were absent [36] . Lung abnormalities on a chest CT scan showed the greatest severity approximately 10 days after the initial onset of symptoms [37] . Chest CT scans can be used to assess the severity of COVID-19.\n\nCOVID-19 also manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1-3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia [38] [39] [40] . As the diagnostic criteria expanded from laboratory examination to chest CT imaging, more than 14,000 patients were diagnosed on February 12, 2020.\n\nClassical public health measures, including isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment can be used to curb the pandemic of this respiratory disease [41] .\n\nChina has been preparing to contain future pandemics by applying lessons learned from SARS ever since 2003 [42] . In the COVID-19 pandemic, China issued the largest quarantine in history. \n\nThere is no current evidence from RCTs to recommend any specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment for patients with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Lopinavir (LPV) is an effective agent that inhibits the protease activity of coronavirus in vitro and animal studies. A retrospective matched cohort study including 1, 052 SARS patients showed that the addition of LPV/r as an initial treatment was associated with a reduced death rate (2.3% vs. 11.0% ) [43] .\n\nThe protease inhibitor LPV is an effective treatment based on the experience accumulated from the SARS and MERS outbreaks, indicating it would be a potential treatment option for COVID-19 [44] . Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, is an antiviral compound used to treat several virus infections, including respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis C virus, and some viral hemorrhagic fevers. Promising results were obtained with ribavirin in a MERS-CoV rhesus macaque model [45] . Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) model is targeted by ribavirin after sequence analysis, modeling, and docking to build the model. This feature increases its potential as an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 [46] .\n\nThe antiviral agent remdesivir was designed for the Ebola virus disease [47] . Remdesivir shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, and it could be able to compete for RdRp [48] . Remdesivir and IFNb have superior antiviral activity to those of lopinavir and ritonavir in vitro [49] . In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, both prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir improved pulmonary function and reduced lung viral loads and severe lung pathology [50] . In a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection, when prophylactic remdesivir treatment was initiated 24 h prior to inoculation, MERS-CoV was prevented from inducing clinical disease and inhibited from replicating in respiratory tissues, which prevented the formation of lung lesions [51] . In cell-based assays, triphosphate form of remdesivir incorporated at position i, and then RNA chain termination was delayed, which helped to explain the high potency of remdesivir against RNA [52] . In the first case of COVID-19 in the United States, remdesivir was used to treat COVID-19. After having administered remdesivir for only one day the patient's clinical condition improved [53] . A phase II clinical trial of remdesivir was performed by the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and a phase III clinical trial was performed by China-Japan Friendship Hospital. The results of these clinical trials will be revealed in April 2020. Remdesivir improved pulmonary function, reduced lung viral loads, and ameliorated severe lung pathology. In contrast, prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFNb only slightly reduced viral loads and did not impact other disease parameters, and therapeutic LPV/RTV -IFNb improved pulmonary function, but did not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology [49] .\n\nOverall, these results indicated that remdesivir showed more potential than LPV/RTV-IFNb [54] .\n\nIn a case report, lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra\u00ae) and arbidol were used to treat COVID-19 patients, and they had significant improvements [55] . The efficacy and safety of these antiviral agents for COVID-19 will be assessed by further clinical trials. 34 trials of antiviral agents in patients with COVID-19 have been registered up to March 15 (Table. 1).\n\nChloroquine, a widely-used anti-malarial and autoimmune disease drug, has been reported as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug [56] [57] [58] . Chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV [59] . The first results obtained from more than 100 patients showed the superiority of chloroquine in terms of reduction of exacerbation of pneumonia, duration of symptoms and delay of viral clearance, all in the absence of severe side effects [60] . Chloroquine was included in the recommendations regarding the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia [60, 61] . The optimal dosage for SARS-CoV-2 is an issue that will need to be assessed in the coming trials [62] .\n\nHydroxychloroquine is an analog of chloroquine that has fewer concerns about drug-drug interactions [63] . In the previous SARS outbreak, hydroxychloroquine was reported to have anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro [64] . Based on physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. [65] . It has been reported that cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 were increased in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection [66, 67] . This may progress to a cytokine storm, followed by multi-organ failure and potentially death. Both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have immunomodulatory effects and can suppress the immune response [68, 69] . Following above idea, 21 clinical studies were launched by Chinese hospitals and University of Oxford to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine ( Table 2) . It is also necessary to determine if the benefit of chloroquine therapy depends on the age class, the clinical presentation or the stage of the disease [70] . If clinical data confirm the biological results, it is possible to use both in prophylaxis in people exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 and as well as curative treatment [71] .\n\nIn the study of 41 COVID-19 patients, 21% received corticosteroids, which could suppress lung inflammation [66] . The dose of methylprednisolone varied depending on disease severity.\n\nHowever, current interim guidance from the WHO on the clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when SARS-CoV-2 infection is suspected (released January 28, 2020) advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason. The clinical outcomes of coronavirus and similar outbreaks do not support the use of corticosteroids. In a retrospective observational study reporting on 309 adults who were critically ill with MERS, patients who were given corticosteroids were more likely to require mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy [72] . For the management of SARS, corticosteroid treatment was more associated with psychosis, diabetes and avascular necrosis [73, 74] .\n\nOverall, no unique reason exists to expect that patients with COVID-19 infection will benefit from corticosteroids, and they might be more likely to be harmed with such treatment [75] .\n\nHowever, according to our clinical experience, corticosteroids could be prescribed at the right time for the right patients. The clinical trials about corticosteroids were shown in Table. 3.\n\nThe development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19 has important implications. Considering the relatively high identity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with the COVID-19\n\nspike protein was assessed. The spike protein is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies.\n\nFortunately, the SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody CR3022 could bind potently with the COVID-19 RBD [76] . However, other SARS-CoV RBD-directed antibodies 230, m396 and 80R cannot bind to the COVID-19 RBD [77] . CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infections. Both antibodies MAb114 and REGN-EB3\n\nwere designed for Ebola, and these significantly reduce the mortality when used as the treatment for Ebola virus disease [47] . Monoclonal antibodies can only recognize a single antigen epitope, which limits the use of MAb114 and REGN-EB3 in the treatment of COVID-19.\n\nHowever, the development of COVID-19-specific antibodies requires a long time. It is not easy to apply monoclonal antibodies for new pathogens to clinical practice in a short time.\n\nIn the treatment of SARS, convalescent plasma is administered early after symptom onset, and the pooled odds of mortality following treatment was reduced compared with placebo or no therapy (odds ratio, 0.25) [78] . However, in Ebola virus disease, the transfusion of up to 500 ml of convalescent plasma in 84 patients was not associated with a significant improvement in survival [79] . In a laboratory test, the COVID-19 virus was isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient, and it could be neutralized by sera from several patients [80] . Current clinical trials about convalescent plasma transfusion were shown in Table. 4. For the treatment of the COVID-19, the National Health Commission of China appeal to convalescent patients to donate blood. Plasma from convalescence should be collected within two weeks after recovery to ensure a high neutralization antibody titer. The difficulty in obtaining plasma during convalescence also limits its clinical application. The efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in patients with COVID-19 infection should be further evaluated in well-designed clinical trials.\n\nThe structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein has been revealed, and it should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis [77] . These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on optimizing the design of vaccination strategies for this emerging infection. The majority of the vaccines that are being developed for coronaviruses target the spike glycoprotein or S protein [81] . Moreover, a new oral SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has been successfully developed at Tianjin University, which uses food-grade safe Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a carrier and targets the S protein.\n\nThere are 18 biotech companies and universities in China working on SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.\n\nThanks to scientists around the world trying their best to develop vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 and Chinese health organizations approving them at the fastest pace, vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have been developed much faster than those for Ebola.\n\nBats have been recognized as natural reservoir and vectors of a variety of coronaviruses and the viruses have crossed species barriers to infect humans and many other different kinds of animals, including avians, rodents, and chiropters [83, 84] . While the origin of COVID-19 is still being investigated, COVID-19 has features typical of the Coronaviridae family and was classified in the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage. COVID-19 can be transmitted between humans.\n\nInterventions, including intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19, with the effect of travel restrictions. Wearing masks, washing hands and disinfecting surfaces contribute to reducing the risk of infection. Human coronaviruses can be efficiently inactivated within 1 minute by using surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite [85] .\n\nIdentification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, control the pandemic, and reduce the economic impacts of COVID-19 on China and the world. In acute respiratory infection, RT-PCR is routinely used to detect causative viruses from respiratory secretions. The positive rate of PCR from oropharyngeal swabs is not very high. In this situation, more swab testing is needed to clarify a diagnosis. Typical CT findings can help early screening of suspected cases and diagnosing COVID-19.\n\nThe COVID-19 infection has a clustering onset and is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities [86] , and the average age is 51 years old. No evidence supports adverse birth outcomes, intrauterine infection, or vertical transmission of COVID-19 [87] . However, viral infections can be acquired when the infant passes through the birth canal during vaginal delivery or through postpartum breastfeeding [88] . The most common symptoms were fever, cough, expectoration, headache, myalgia or fatigue, diarrhoea, and haemoptysis [89] . Some people may experience severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Histological examination of lung biopsy samples showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates [90] . Other organs are also susceptible to COVID-19. The single-cell RNA-seq data was used to analyze receptor ACE2 expression to reveals the potential risk of different human organs vulnerable to COVID-19 infection [91] . COVID-19 uses the same cell entry receptor as SARS-CoV, ACE2, which regulates both cross-species and human-to-human transmissions [80] .\n\nProximal tubular cells also express higher levels of the ACE2 receptor, which leads to susceptibility to COVID-19 [91] and induces kidney injury. Data from 33 patients with a complete clinical course were analyzed, and the levels of blood urea and creatinine were higher in non-survivors than in survivors [92] .\n\nIn the treatment of COVID-19-infected pneumonia, all patients received antibacterial agents, 90% received antiviral therapy, and 45% received methylprednisolone [92] . Current clinical trials are under investigation to demonstrate the efficacy of new antiviral drugs, convalescent plasma transfusion, and vaccines. Most of the trials were initiated by investigators and the study period would last for 1 to 11 months. Although the final results of studies will take a long time to complete, the interim research data may provide some help for the current urgent demand for therapy [93] . "}
