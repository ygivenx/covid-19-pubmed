{"title": "Acute Myocardial Injury of Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019", "body": "The widespread outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19, previously known as 2019-nCoV) in China is a big challenge for public health and medical care.\n\nSince its first emergence in Wuhan city in late December 2019, COVID-19 has already spread to 26 countries. As of March 02, 2020, there were over 87137 confirmed cases worldwide, with 2977 deaths. 1 To date, several latest studies have reported the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), including signs, symptoms, laboratory test results, imaging features, therapeutic strategies and effects, and multiple organ dysfunction. [2] [3] [4] [5] Notably, acute myocardial injury (AMI), defined as troponin T-hypersensitivity (TNT-HSST) serum levels > 99th percentile upper reference limit (>28 pg/ml) by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force for myocardial infarction and non-myocardial infarction diseases, 6 was detected in approximately 7.2%-12% COVID-19 patients in previous studies. [2] [3] Furthermore, both severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been linked to acute myocarditis, AMI, and rapid-onset heart failure. 7-9 Reportedly, 2 nearly 40% of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID- 19 have underlying comorbidities such as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases.\n\nFurthermore, among COVID-19 patients, those with underlying cardiovascular diseases can be more severely affected and may have more adverse outcomes than those without underlying diseases. Thus, undoubtedly, special medical attention should be paid to COVID-19 patients with cardiac complications and underlying All rights reserved.

On February 13, 2020, the ACC released an ACC Clinical Bulletin titled \"Cardiac Implications of Novel Wuhan Coronavirus (COVID-19)\" 10 for addressing cardiac implications of this disease and offering early clinical guidance given the current uncertainty over COVID-19. However, detailed clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with cardiac involvement, especially those with AMI, have not been investigated in detail. Thus, we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and to further determine the risk factors for AMI in them.\n\nThe institutional ethics board of our institutes approved this study (No. 2020.43). We retrospectively enrolled 53 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized between January 02, 2020 and February 14, 2020. The patients were diagnosed and classified according to the World Health Organization interim guidance. 7 NCP types were classified as mild, common, severe, and critically severe according to the COVID-19 patient management guideline issued on February 8, 2020. 11\n\nData on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical signs and symptoms, underlying comorbidities, complications, and treatment management (such All rights reserved.

Laboratory test results including those of blood routine tests, C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer tests, and blood gas analysis were recorded and compared. The levels of cardiac injury markers including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, myoglobin (MYO), amino N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and TNT-HSST were determined at admission. The AMI group was defined as patients with TNT-HSST serum levels > 99th percentile upper reference limit (>28 pg/ml). 6 The group with cardiac marker abnormalities but non-definite AMI was defined as patients with TNT-HSST serum levels < 28pg/ml but increase in the levels of any of the other abovementioned cardiac markers. The group without cardiac marker abnormalities comprised patients without elevation in the levels of any of the cardiac markers. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed on the day of admission. The period of illness onset to admission was defined from the day when signs or symptoms were first noticed to the day of admission. All enrolled patients underwent two-dimensional echocardiography (2D echo) and electrocardiography (ECG) during hospitalization.\n\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was identified according to the Berlin definition 12 and acute kidney injury (AKI) according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definition. 13\n\nAll rights reserved.

Data were presented as median (interquartile range; IQR) if non-normally distributed and as mean (standard deviation; SD) if normally distributed. Categorical variables were presented as n (%). Kruskal-Wallis analysis, Chi-square test, and one-way analysis of variance were used for multiple group comparisons according to data characteristics. Bivariate correlation was calculated using Pearson or Spearman method as appropriate to detect the potential risk factors for AMI. In all analyses, two-tailed p-values of <0.05 were considered significant.\n\nThe baseline data of the 53 COVID-19 patients are listed in Table 1 author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031591 doi: medRxiv preprint 77.36%). Furthermore, the mean systolic blood pressure of the AMI patients was higher than those of the other two groups (p<0.001). Fifteen (28%) of all the patients had tachycardia.\n\nHigh occurrence of hypertension was detected in the AMI patients (total patients with hypertension: n=8, 15.09%; AMI group: n=4, 66.67%; cardiac marker abnormalities group: n=2, 8.33%; without cardiac marker abnormalities group: n=2, 8.69%; p=0.001). Cardiovascular diseases were more frequently found in the AMI patients, all of whom had coronary artery disease, with one having prior coronary artery bypass grafting (total patients with cardiovascular disease: n=6, 11.32%; AMI group: n=4, 66.67%), compared with the groups with and without cardiac marker abnormalities (p=0.001). Additionally, diabetes (n=8, 15.09%) and COPD (n=3, 5.6%) were found in all the patients, with a higher tendency in the AMI group (diabetes: n=2 and COPD: n=2) than in the other two groups (Figure 1) . Notably, only the AMI patients had more than two comorbidities (n=5).\n\nRegarding CT or DR findings on admission, all the AMI patients and 21 (87.5%) non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities had bilateral multilobular and sub-segmental lung involvement; in the without cardiac marker abnormalities group, bilateral lobes were affected in only 15 (65.22%) patients.\n\nThe laboratory test and blood gas analysis results are shown in Table S1 (see in supplementary appendix).

Initial lymphocyte counts of five (83.33%) AMI patients were decreased below the normal range (0.80-4.00 \u00d7 10 9 /l); these counts were decreased in only nine (37.5%) and eight (34.78%) patients with and without cardiac marker abnormalities, respectively.\n\nFurthermore, red blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count of the AMI group were lower than those of the other two groups (p<0.05); four (66.67%) AMI patients had procalcitonin levels above the normal range (0-0.5 ng/ml).\n\nOver half (n=30, 56.6%) of the COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated cardiac marker levels. Cardiac marker levels were higher in the AMI and non-definite AMI patients than in those without cardiac marker abnormities (p<0.05; Figure S1 in supplementary appendix). In the AMI group, cardiac marker levels continuously increased in three patients who died, with the levels being extremely high on the day All rights reserved.

Of all the COVID-19 patients, 45.28% (n=24) patients exhibited echo abnormalities. Echo abnormalities more frequently occurred in the AMI group and included left atrial enlargement (n=2), left ventricular (LV) enlargement (n=2), LV diastolic dysfunction (n=3), mitral valve regurgitation (n=2), triple valve regurgitation (n=1), and aortic valve regurgitation (n=1). Three AMI patients had LV wall thickening. It is noteworthy that non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities also had high frequency of echo abnormalities (n=15, 62.50%), with 11(45.83%) of them having more than two of the abovementioned echo abnormalities. The most frequent echo abnormality in the cardiac marker abnormalities group was LV diastolic dysfunction (n=14, 58.33%). Table 3 , 11 (20.75%) COIVD-19 patients had ECG abnormalities, including all the AMI patients and five (20.83%) non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities. Five of the AMI patients had more than two kinds of ECG abnormalities including atrioventricular block (n=2), ST-T/Q curve abnormalities (n=2), and arrhythmia (n=3); furthermore, ST-T/Q curve abnormalities (n=5, 20.83%) and arrhythmia (n=1, 4.27%) were the main abnormalities in patients with cardiac marker abnormalities. None of the patients without cardiac marker abnormalities exhibited ECG abnormalities.\n\nAll rights reserved.

In the AMI group, in addition to antiviral and antibiotic therapies, cardioprotective medications such as amiodarone and cedilla were used by four patients to improve the cardiac function. However, the non-definite AMI patients with and without cardiac markers abnormalities did not use cardioprotective medication. All the 53 patients were administered nasal cannula oxygen therapy during admission for respiratory support; non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was performed for five AMI and three non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities. Notably, in the AMI group, invasive mechanical ventilation was used in three patients and ECMO in one patient due to extremely severe ARDS.\n\nARDS occurred in all the six AMI patients and four non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities. Hypoxemia was a common complication that affected 19 (35.85%) of the 53 study patients, with a significant difference in the number of affected patients between the AMI (n=6, 100%) and non-definite AMI with cardiac marker abnormalities (n=10, 41.67%) groups and the without cardiac marker abnormalities group (n=3, 13.04%; p<0.001). Moreover, a total of five AMI patients had AKI, and four of them used continuous renal replacement therapy.\n\nImportantly, all the six AMI patients had critically severe NCP and needed care in intensive care unit (ICU). However, half of the patients with cardiac marker abnormalities (n=13, 54.17%) had the common NCP type, with only two (8.33%) of them having critically severe NCP needing ICU care.

Regarding clinical outcomes, in the AMI group, three patients died, two were still in admission, and one was discharged from hospital.\n\nConversely, a majority of non-definite AMI patients with (n=20, 83.33%) and without (n=21, 91.30%) cardiac marker abnormalities were discharged, with no case of death. \n\nThis is the first study to show that cardiac abnormalities including tachycardia (28%), elevated myocardial enzyme levels (56.6%), cardiac dysfunction (37.7%), and even All rights reserved.

Moreover, AMI was detected in 6 of the 53 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. All the six patients had severe or critically severe NCP and required ICU care. Of the six AMI patients, three died, two remained hospitalized, and one was discharged. Notably, CRP levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the major risk factors for AMI in the COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, there were 24 (45%) COVID-19 patients with elevation in the levels of one or more myocardial enzymes and markers of myocardial damage whose features did not meet the strict definition of myocardial injury, with most of them having the common NCP type and experiencing quick recovery; however, 58.33% of these patients exhibited LV dysfunction on echo, and long-term outcomes should be observed via follow-up in a future study.\n\nOur study results suggest that the rates of cardiac complications were high in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially in patients with confirmed AMI from among those who required ICU care. As shown in a recent report on 138 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 2 16 .7% of the patients developed arrhythmia and 7.2% developed acute cardiac injury. In another series of 41 cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it has been reported that 5 (12%) patients were diagnosed with acute cardiac injury. [2] [3] [4] [5] Similar to the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19, those of SARS include hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, systolic and diastolic dysfunctions, and sudden death, with tachycardia particularly being the commonest condition persistent in nearly 40% of patients during follow-up. 14 Furthermore, MERS-induced myocarditis All rights reserved.

However, further evidence is urgently needed to assess the mechanism of cardiac damage in large-sample autopsy or biopsy studies. Previous studies have indicated that SARS-CoV can mediate MI and damage associated with the downregulation of the myocardial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 system; this may be responsible for the myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with SARS, which has also been detected in COVID-19 patients. [19] [20] [21] [22] Until now, the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has not been completely understood. Although full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, the pathophysiological mechanism of cardiac infection or damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 needs to be further validated in future studies. 23 In our study, AMI usually occurred in COVID-19 patients with old age, underlying comorbidities, severe or critically severe NCP, and ARDS. Among 44,672 patients with confirmed COVID-19, as reported in the China CDC Weekly on Feb 11, 2020, approximately 31.2% patients were aged >60 years. The overall case fatality rate was 2.3% (1,023 deaths); more importantly, the majority (81%) of deaths occurred in patients aged \u2265 60 years or in those with underlying medical conditions. 24 Similarly, in our study, all the six AMI patients were aged >60 years and had one or more underlying conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, COPD, and cardiovascular diseases.

Meanwhile, ARDS was present in all the AMI patients. ARDS, as a severe complication, occurred in approximately 19%-29% NCP patients as per previous reports. [2] [3] [4] [5] Thus, we must understand the mechanisms of heart-lung interactions in ARDS patients, particularly the right ventricle function impairments caused by respiratory dysfunction. 26 Logistic regression analysis indicated that NCP severity was a risk factor for AMI in COVID-19 patients. Indeed, the outcomes of these patients need to be further determined in long-term follow-up studies.\n\nOur study has some limitations. First, this is a modest-size case series of hospitalized COVID-19 patients; more standardized data from a larger cohort would beneficial for further determining the clinical characteristics. Second, our data showed the clinical characteristics of AMI induced by COVID-19, including the clinical presentations, electrophysiological abnormality, myocardial enzyme and myocardial injury marker levels, and cardiac dysfunction and enlargement. However, the tissue characteristics in myocardial damage (i.e., edema, fibrosis, and microcirculation disorder) should be further demonstrated via cardiac magnetic resonance imaging examination as far as possible under the premise of controlling transmission. Finally, most of the COVID-19 patients with AMI had severe or critically severe NCP and high fatality rate, but long-term follow-up should be performed to determine adverse cardiac All rights reserved.

More importantly, CRP level elevation, NCP severity, and underlying cardiovascular diseases are the major risk factors for AMI in these patients.\n\nWe thank all our colleagues who helped us during the current study.
