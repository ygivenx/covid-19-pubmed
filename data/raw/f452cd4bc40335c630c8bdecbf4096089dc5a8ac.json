{"title": "Calicivirus-Like Agents", "body": "Small viruses have been found in diarrheic feces of humans, calves and piglets which have a superficial morphologic resemblance to the members of the Caliciviridae. However, these have not been characterized or grown in cell culture and have not been shown to possess the properties of the Caliciviridae (Matthews, 1982) .\n\nThe term was first used to describe virus-like particles in human feces (reviewed by Madeley, 1979) , and similar particles were subsequently identified in the feces of lambs by Snodgrass and Gray (1977) , of calves by Woode and Bridger (1978) and of pigs by Bridger (1980) .\n\nBovine calicivirus-like agents have not been characterized chemically. When negatively stained with 2% potassium phosphotungstate, fecal particles have a reticulate appearance with capsomeres projecting from their outer edges. Occasionally particles are penetrated by stain and show an outer rim, 7-8 nm wide. The particles occur singularly or in groups containing as many as several hundred virions. Within these groups small particles about 18 nm diameter are frequently and characteristically observed. The mean diameter of complete particles is 33 nm (Fig. 172 ; Woode and Bridger, 1978) . The particles are similar but not identical to the description of calicivirus-like particles from humans (Madeley, 1979) and to members of the Caliciviridae (Smith et al., 1983) .\n\nSerological tests, other than IEM, have not been developed. Two-way crossprotection experiments in gnotobiotic calves have confirmed the presence of at least two antigenically different strains and probably more (Woode and Bridger, 1978; Bridger et al., 1984) . Antiserum to Newbury agent was tested against a bovine calicivirus (Smith et al., 1983) and 17 other serotypes of calicivirus (12 serotypes of San Miguel sea lion virus, a vaccine strain of feline calicivirus and caliciviruses isolated from a gorilla, a rattlesnake, a mink and a walrus); no antigenic relationship with any one of these caliciviruses was detected (A.W. Smith, personal communication, 1983) .\n\nCalicivirus-like agents were identified in fecal samples of three herds with a history of calf diarrhea in England. All initial isolates were contaminated by astrovirus. In one herd other pathogens were not identified as frequent causes of the scour, but in two herds infection with Coronavirus or rotavirus were common (Woode and Bridger, 1978) . The authors consider that infections with these agents are probably common, as it is not necessary to search diligently for infected herds, once diagnostic methods have been developed. From a survey of calf diarrhea in southern England 6 of 18 outbreaks were associated with calicivirus-like agents . However, the calicivirus-like agent infections of calves have been reported only from one group in England and this may be the result of the difficulty of identifying the viruses in fecal samples by routine examination . Recently a caliciviruslike agent has been identified with calf diarrhea in the USA (G.N. Woode, unpublished data, 1983) . A calicivirus (Tillamook strain) was isolated from calves with respiratory disease; this virus caused vesicular lesions in experimentally infected pigs. Although this virus was not neutralized by 18 calicivirus typing antisera, it has the typical morphology and is probably a member of the vesicular exanthema group of swine viruses (Smith et al., 1983) .\n\nExperimentally the fecal-oral route of transmission is successful, with diarrhea commencing 24-72 h p.i. Under farm conditions, infections appear to spread in a similar manner, following direct or indirect contact with fecal material.\n\nCalicivirus-like agents can infect orally, and virus is found in the feces 24-72 h p.i. There is no report of involvement of organs other than the small intestine. Excretion of detectable virus is limited to a few days.\n\nGnotobiotic calves 1 to more than 40 days of age when orally fed the virus become infected and excrete the virus. Calves less than 8 days of age develop mild diarrhea characterized by a change in color of the feces (yellow) and some softening. Calves aged more than 16 days may develop profuse yellow diarrhea and some calves excrete fresh blood. Anorexia may persist for 1-2 days. There is considerable variability between calves in the severity of diarrhea, anorexia, watery nature of the stools and fecal output. Dry matter content is a poor indicator of disease severity and may vary from 5 to 30%. When anorexia is more severe, diarrhea and fecal output is reduced. There may be virus strain differences in virulence for gnotobiotic calves. In general, virus particles are detectable in the feces a few hours before diarrhea commences, or their presence coincides with the onset of diarrhea and may be detectable for a further 1-4 days. Usually few particles are excreted and they can be difficult to find (Woode and Bridger, 1978; Hall et al., 1982 Hall et al., , 1984 Bridger et al., 1984) . D-xylose absorption is a good measure of the clinical effect of infection and may be reduced by as much as 100% 1 h after feeding (Woode and Bridger, 1978) but can show variability amongst individual calves with reductions ranging from 43 to 96% (calicivirus SVR-1) or 18 to 32% (calicivirus SRV-2) of preinfection levels .\n\nThere are no macroscopic lesions seen, although some calves will have blood in the rectal contents. Lesions occur mainly in the anterior 33% of the small intestine, characterized by villus atrophy and reduced lactase activity in the jejunum. There is swelling of epithelial cells with shortening or loss of the microvilli. Infected cells degenerate and villus atrophy develops, with mild inflammatory response and crypt hyperplasia. Virus has not been observed in the cells involved in the lesion by transmission EM and immunofluorescence is not observed with convalescent serum (Woode et al., 1978; Hall et al., 1982; Bridger et al., 1984) , but a faint reaction is observed by the immunoperoxidase method . Loss of activity of/J-galactosidase occurs throughout the small intestine.\n\nConvalescent serum has IEM activity. Tissue cultures inoculated with virus preparations show no sign of infection and do not immunofluoresce; affected tissues also fail to show immunofluorescence, although there is a faint reaction by the immunoperoxidase method.\n\nEM of fecal or intestinal contents, with minimal dilution, pelleted through 20-40% sucrose and stained with potassium phosphotungstate, is the most commonly used diagnostic method. IEM can increase the isolation rate, but only for those strains antigenically related. Immunoperoxidase staining of sections of the small intestine has been described. At least two and possibly more isolates of bovine calicivirus-like agents are unrelated antigenically as judged by cross-protection studies. It is probable that many serotypes exist (Woode and Bridger, 1978; Smith et al., 1983; Bridger et al., 1984) .\n\nThere are no known control methods, and the importance of these viruses in the calf scour syndrome is not known. However, they were isolated from one"}
