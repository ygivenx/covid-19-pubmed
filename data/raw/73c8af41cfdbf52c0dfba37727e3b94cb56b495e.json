{"title": "The Essential Facts of Wuhan Novel Coronavirus Outbreak in China and Epitope-based Vaccine Designing against COVID-19", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses, which is surrounded by crownshaped, club-like spikes projection on the outer surface [1] [2] . Coronaviruses spike protein are glycoprotein that are embedded over the viral envelope. This spike protein attaches to specific cellular receptors and initiates structural changes of spike protein, and causes penetration of cell membranes which results in the release of the viral nucleocapsid into the cell [3] . The viral spike protein includes N-terminal, which is crucial for identification of Coronaviruses [4] . Coronaviruses have a large RNA genome in the size ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases and capable of obtaining distinct ways of replication [5] . Like all other RNA viruses, coronavirus undergoes replication of genome and transcription of mRNAs upon infection. Synthesis of a full-length negative-strand RNA serves as template for full-length genomic RNA [3] [6] . Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales [7] . that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats [8] . This group of viruses can cause wide varieties of respiratory illness in mammals and birds. In human, it causes common cold, leading to severe illness pneumonia to elderly people and immunocompromised people, like hospital patients [9] . This viral pathogen was responsible for the Middle East Respiratory [87] . First European fatality of a 80-year-old-man in France was reported on the same date [88] . 1,933 deaths in Hubei alone and more than 70,000 cases were reported by Health authorities on 18th February, 2020 [89] . China's National Health Committee reported on 19th February, 2020 that blood plasma can be extracted from the recovered patients to treat serious patients [90] . Japan's Health Ministry announced two deaths of a 87-year-old-man and 84-yearold-woman on the cruise ship on 20th February, 2020 and on the same date South Korea's first fatality was reported [91] . The youngest coronavirus infected patient who is under age 10 was reported in Japan on 21th February, 2020 [92] . As of 22th February, 2020, 2,239 death cases and 75,567 infected cases including 346 infected cases in South Korea were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) [93] . World Health Organization (WHO) welcomed the report of China on 23th February, 2020 saying there was a fall in new death case in mainland China but concerned with infected cases in other counties as the total infected cases in South Korea stood 433 on the same date [94] .\n\n.

Use of Interferons in combination with Ribavirin is somewhat effective. However, the effectiveness of combined remedy needs to be further evaluated [95] . This experiment is carried out to design novel epitope-based vaccine against four proteins of SARS-CoV-2 i.e., nucleocapsid phosphoprotein which is responsible for genome packaging and viral assembly [96] ; surface glycoprotein that is responsible for membrane fusion event during viral entry [97] [98] ; ORF3a protein that is responsible for viral replication, characterized virulence, viral spreading and infection [99] and membrane glycoprotein which mediates the interaction of virions with cell receptors [100] using the approaches of reverse vaccinology.\n\nReverse vaccinology refers to the process of developing vaccines where the novel antigens of a virus or microorganism or organism are detected by analyzing the genomic and genetic information of that particular virus or organism. In reverse vaccinology, the tools of bioinformatics are used for identifying and analyzing these novel antigens. These tools are used to dissect the genome and genetic makeup of a pathogen for developing a potential vaccine. Reverse vaccinology approach of vaccine development also allows the scientists to easily understand the antigenic segments of a virus or pathogen that should be given more emphasis during the vaccine development. This method is a quick, cheap, efficient, easy and cost-effective way to design vaccine. Reverse vaccinology has successfully been used for developing vaccines to fight against many viruses i.e., the Zika virus, Chikungunya virus etc. [ \n\nThe current experiment was conducted to develop potential vaccines against the Wuhan novel coronavirus (strain SARS-CoV-2) (Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus) exploiting the strategies of reverse vaccinology (Figure 01 ).\n\nThe strain of the SARS-CoV-2 was selected by reviewing numerous entries of the online database of National Center for Biotechnology Information or NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).\n\nFour protein sequences i.e., nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (PubMed accession no: QHD43423.2), membrane glycoprotein (PubMed accession no: QHD43419.1), ORF3a protein (PubMed accession no: QHD43417.1) and surface glycoprotein (PubMed accession no: QHD43416.1) were downloaded from the NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) database in fasta format.\n\nThe antigenicity of protein sequences was determined using an online tool called VaxiJen v2.0 (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.htm). During the antigenicity prediction, the prediction accuracy parameter threshold was set at 0.4 in the tumor model [103] - [105] . The tumor model was used in prediction because it generated excellent results (when compared to other models) in both the leave-on-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) and external validation in numerous studies. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of a prediction (by the VaxiJen v2.0 server) depends on the prediction accuracy threshold. For this reason, to improve the accuracy of the prediction, the threshold 0.4 was used. The server is a user-friendly web tool for effective . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.935072 doi: bioRxiv preprint prediction of the antigenicity of proteins [106] - [108] . Only the highly antigenic protein sequences were selected for further analysis. Next, the selected antigenic protein sequences were analyzed by ExPASy's online tool and ProtParam (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) to determine their physicochemical properties i.e., the number of amino acids, theoretical pI, extinction co-efficient, aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) etc. [109] .\n\nThe online epitope prediction server Immune Epitope Database or IEDB (https://www.iedb.org/) was used for T-cell and B-cell epitope prediction. The database contains a huge collection of experimental data on T-cell epitopes and antibodies [110] . The NetMHCpan EL 4.0 prediction method was used for MHC class-I restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope prediction (for HLA-A*11-01 allele) and the MHC class-II restricted CD4+ helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes were predicted (for HLA DRB1*04-01 allele), using the Sturniolo prediction method [111] . Ten of the top twenty MHC class-I and MHC class-II epitopes were randomly selected based on their antigenicity scores (AS). For, the B-cell lymphocytic epitopes (BCL), with amino acid number of more than ten, were selected for analysis that were predicted using BepiPred linear epitope prediction method [112] [113].\n\nThe epitopes selected in the previous step were then subjected to the transmembrane topology experiment using the transmembrane topology of protein helices determinant, TMHMM v2.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) [114] . [108] .\n\nThe allergenicity of the selected epitopes were predicted using two online tools i.e., AllerTOP v2.0 (https://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP/) and AllergenFP v1.0 (http://ddgpharmfac.net/AllergenFP/). AllerTOP server generates more accurate results than AllergenFP server [115] [116] . For this reason, during prediction, the results predicted by AllerTOP were given much priority. The toxicity prediction of the selected epitopes was carried out using ToxinPred server (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/) using SVM (support vector method) based method, keeping all the parameters default. The SVM is a machine learning technique which is used in the server for differentiating the toxic and non-toxic peptides [117] . After the antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity tests, the epitopes that were found to be antigenic, non-allergenic and non-toxic, were considered as the best predicted epitopes and selected for the later phases of the experiment.\n\nThe cluster analysis of the MHC alleles was carried out to identify the alleles of the MHC class-I and class-II molecules with similar binding specificities. The cluster analysis of the MHC alleles were carried out using online tool MHCcluster 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MHCcluster/) [118] . During the analysis, all the parameters were kept default and all the HLA supertype representatives (MHC class-I) as well as the HLA-DR representatives (MHC class-II) were selected. The NetMHCpan-2.8 prediction method was used for analyzing the MHC class-I alleles.\n\n. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Only the best selected epitopes from previous steps (the epitopes that followed the selection criteria of high antigenicity, non-allergenicity and non-toxicity in the previous steps, were considered best) were taken for 3D structure prediction [119] - [121] .\n\nMolecular docking analysis is one of the essential steps in reverse vaccinology to design vaccines.\n\nIn this step, peptide-protein docking was performed to predict the binding of epitopes with various antibodies or the MHC receptors [122] . The molecular docking study of the epitopes were conducted using PatchDock (https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/php.php) server against HLA-A*11-01 allele (PDB ID: 5WJL) and HLA DRB1*04-01 (PDB ID: 5JLZ). PatchDock tool is a quick, easy, efficient and effective online docking tool which works on some specific algorithms. These algorithms divide the connolly dot surface representations of the compounds into concave, convex and flat patches. Later, possible solutions are predicted from these patches and RMSD (root mean square deviation) scores are applied to the candidate solutions. Based on the RMSD scores, the best candidate solutions are determined by the server. After successful docking by PatchDock, the refinement and re-scoring of the docking results were carried out by the FireDock server (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/FireDock/php.php). The FireDock server generates global energies for the best solutions and the lowest global energy is always considered as the best docking score [113]- [126] . The best results were visualized using Discovery Studio Visualizer [127] . \n\nThe antigenicity of the constructed vaccines was predicted by the online server VaxiJen v2.0 (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.htm) using the tumor model where the threshold was set at 0.4. The allergenicity of the predicted vaccines were determined by two online tools for improving the prediction accuracy i.e., AlgPred (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/algpred/) and AllerTop v2.0 (https://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP/). MEME/MAST motif prediction was used to predict the allergenicity of the vaccines by AlgPred [136] . Later, ProtParam (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) was used to predict different physicochemical properties of the predicted vaccines [109] .\n\nThe secondary structure generation of the vaccine constructs were performed using online server, PRISPRED (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/), which is a simple and easy secondary structure generating tool [137] [138] . The secondary structures of the vaccine constructs were predicted using the PRISPRED 4.0 prediction method. Next, another online tool, NetTurnP v1.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetTurnP/) was used to predict the \u03b2-sheet structure of the predicted vaccines [139] . The 3D structures of the vaccines were then generated using online server RaptorX (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/) [140] - [142] .\n\nProtein structure refinement is an important step in vaccine design because when protein 3D structures are predicted by online tools, they may lack the true, native structure. The refinement of the structures can convert the low resolution predicted model to high resolution predicted model \n\nDisulfide bonds are important characteristics of protein because they provide stability to the proteins. For this reason, to predict the correct disulfide interactions, the vaccine protein disulfide engineering was carried out with the aid of Disulfide by Design 2 v12.2 (http://cptweb.cpt.wayne.edu/DbD2/) server which predicts the potential sites within a protein structure that have higher possibility of undergoing disulfide bond formation [147] . During disulfide engineering, the intra-chain, inter-chain and C\u03b2 for glycine residue were selected and the \u03c73 Angle was kept -87\u00b0 or +97\u00b0 \u00b1 5 and C\u03b1-C\u03b2-S\u03b3 Angle was kept 114.6\u00b0 \u00b110. The \u03c73 angle was set at -87\u00b0 or +97\u00b0 \u00b1 5 because numerous disulfides were generated by the server, when the default angle (+97\u00b0 \u00b130\u00b0 and -87\u00b0 \u00b130\u00b0) was used. So, to shorten the amount of disulfides, the \u03c73 angle was kept low. Furthermore, studies have estimated that C\u03b1-C\u03b2-S\u03b3 angle reach a peak of near 115\u00b0\n\nand covers a range from 105\u00b0 to 125\u00b0, in known disulfides. For this reason, the C\u03b1-C\u03b2-S\u03b3 angle was kept default (114.6\u00b0 \u00b110) [148] [149].\n\n. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

During viral infections, the MHC complex recognize the viral particles as potent antigens. Since the different portions of the MHC molecules are encoded by different MHC alleles, the constructed vaccines should have very good binding affinity towards these segments of the MHC complex [150] . [152] . The coronavirus is an RNA virus [153] . For this reason, the vaccine constructs of Wuhan novel coronavirus were docked against TLR-8 (PDB ID: 3W3M). The protein-protein docking study was conducted using different online docking tools to improve the prediction accuracy of the docking study. At first, the docking was performed by ClusPro 2.0 (https://cluspro.bu.edu/login.php). The server ranks the docked complexes based on their center scores and lowest energy scores [154] - [156] . The binding affinity (\u0394G in kcal mol -1 ) of the docked complexes were later analyzed by PRODIGY tool of HADDOCK webserver (https://haddock.science.uu.nl/). The lower binding energy of the server represents the higher binding affinity and vice versa [157] - [159] . Next, the docking was again carried out by PatchDock (https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/php.php) server and later refined and re-scored by FireDock server (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/FireDock/php.php). The The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.935072 doi: bioRxiv preprint Surface Area (MM-GBSA) study was also calculated by the HawkDock server which works on specific algorithm that depicts that, the lower score and lower energy represent the better scores [160] - [163] . From the docking experiment, one best vaccine was selected based on the docking score. The docked structures were visualized by PyMol tool [164] .\n\nThe molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study was of the best selected vaccine construct was carried out using the online MD simulation tool, iMODS (http://imods.chaconlab.org/). It is a fast, online, user-friendly and effective molecular dynamics simulation server that predicts the deformability, B-factor (mobility profiles), eigenvalues, variance, co-variance map and elastic network of the protein complex. For a protein complex, the stability depends on the ability to deform at each of its amino acids. The eigenvalue represents the motion stiffness of the protein complex and the lower eigenvalue represents easy deformability of the complex. The server also determines and measures the protein flexibility [165] - [169] .\n\nThe best predicted vaccine from the previous steps, was reverse transcribed to a possible DNA sequence which is supposed to express the vaccine protein in a target organism. The cellular machinery of that particular organism could use the codons of the newly adapted DNA sequence efficiently for producing the desired vaccine. Codon adaptation is a necessary step of vaccine design because this step provides the effective prediction of the DNA sequence of a vaccine\n\nconstruct. An amino acid can be encoded by different codons in different organisms, which is known as codon bias. Codon adaptation predicts the best codon for a specific amino acid that .

The best predicted vaccine was used for codon adaptation by the Java Codon Adaptation Tool or JCat server (http://www.jcat.de/). The server ensures the maximal expression of protein in a target organism. Eukaryotic E. coli strain K12 was selected at the JCat server and rho-independent transcription terminators, prokaryotic ribosome binding sites and SgrA1 and SphI cleavage sites of restriction enzymes, were avoided.\n\nThe optimized DNA sequence was then taken and SgrA1 and SphI restriction sites were attached to the N-terminal and C-terminal sites, respectively. Finally, the SnapGene restriction cloning module was used to insert the newly adapted DNA sequence between the SgrA1 and SphI restriction sites of pET-19b vector [170] - [174] .\n\n.

The physicochemical property analysis was conducted for these two selected proteins. Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein had the highest predicted theoretical pI of 10.07, however, surface glycoprotein had the highest predicted extinction co-efficient of 148960 M -1 cm -1 . Both of them were found to have similar predicted half-life of 30 hours. However, surface glycoprotein had the highest predicted aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) values among the two proteins (Table 03) .\n\nHowever, numerous in vitro and in vivo researches should be carried out on these predictions to determine the degree of their accuracy. \n\nThe MHC class-I and MHC class-II epitopes, determined for potential vaccine construction. The IEDB (https://www.iedb.org/) server generates a good number of epitopes. However, based on the antigenicity scores, ten epitopes were selected from the top twenty epitopes because the epitopes generated almost similar AS and percentile scores. Later, the epitopes with high antigenicity, nonallergenicity and non-toxicity were selected for vaccine construction. The B-cell epitopes were also selected based on their antigenicity, non-allergenicity and length (the sequences with more than 10 amino acids). Table 04 and Table 05 list the potential T-cell epitopes of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and Table   06 and Table 07 list the potential T-cell epitopes of surface glycoprotein. Table 08 lists the predicted B-cell epitopes of the two proteins and Table 09 lists the epitopes that followed the mentioned criteria and were selected for further analysis and vaccine construction. \n\nThe online tool MHCcluster 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MHCcluster/), was used for the prediction or cluster analysis of the possible MHC class-I and MHC class-II alleles that may interact with the selected epitopes during the immune responses. The tool illustrates the relationship of the clusters of the alleles in phylogenetic manner.

To construct the vaccines, three different adjuvants were used i.e., beta defensin, L7/L12 ribosomal protein and HABA protein and different linkers i.e., EAAAK, GGGS, GPGPG and KK linkers were used at their appropriate positions.\n\nPADRE sequence is an important sequence which was used in vaccine construction. It has the capability to increase the potency of the vaccines with minimal toxicity. Moreover, PADRE sequence also improve the CTL response, thus ensuring potent immune response [175] . The newly constructed vaccines were designated as: CV-1, CV-2 and CV-3 (Table 11) .\n\n. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

All the three vaccine constructs were found to be antigenic as well as non-allergenic. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.935072 doi: bioRxiv preprint \n\nFrom the secondary structure analysis, it was determined that, the CV-1 had the highest percentage of the amino acids (67.1%) in the coil formation as well as the highest percentage of amino acids (8%) in the beta-strand formation. However, CV-3 had the highest percentage of 37.8% of amino acids in the alpha-helix formation (Figure 05 and Table 13 ). CV-1 and CV-2 vaccines had 02 domains, whereas, CV-3 had only one domain. CV-2 had the lowest p-value of 6.35e-05. The pvalue represents the relative quality of a protein model. The smaller p-value refers to higher quality of the protein model and vice-verse [176] . For this reason, CV-2 showed the best performance in the 3D structure generation experiment. Moreover, three different templates were used for generating3D structures of the three different vaccines. The RaptorX server used the templates for generating the 3D structures of the query vaccine constructs [177] . The results of the 3D structure analysis are listed in Table 14 and illustrated in Figure 06 .\n\n. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

The PROCHECK server (https://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/PROCHECK/) divides the Ramachandran plot into four regions: the most favored region (represented by red color), the additional allowed region (represented by yellow color), the generously allowed region (represented by light yellow color) and the disallowed region (represented by white color).\n\nAccording to the server, a valid protein (the best quality protein) should have over 90% of its amino acids in the most favored region. The additional allowed region and generously allowed region might also contain some percentage of the amino acids of the protein. Moreover, no amino acid should reside in the disallowed region [178] - [180] .\n\nThe 3D protein structures generated in the previous step were refined for further analysis and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.935072 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nIn protein disulfide engineering, disulfide bonds were generated within the 3D structures of the vaccine constructs. In the experiment, the amino acid pairs that had bond energy value less than 2.00 kcal/mol were selected. Since about 90% of the native disulfide bonds in proteins have energy value of less than 2.2 kcal/mol, the bond energy value of 2.00 kcal/mol was selected as the cut-off value for the experiment for better prediction [181] . The CV-1 generated 10 amino acid pairs that had the capability to form disulfide bonds. However, only one pair was selected because they had the bond energy, less than 2.00 kcal/mol: 276 Ser-311 Arg. However, CV-2 and CV-3 generated 04 and 05 pairs of amino acids, respectively, that might form disulfide bonds and no pair of amino acids showed bond energy less than 2.00 Kcal/mol. The selected amino acid pairs of CV-1 formed the mutant version of the original vaccines (Figure 08) .

The vaccine construct with the best result in the molecular docking, was considered as the best vaccine construct. According to docking results, it was found that CV-1 was the best constructed vaccine. CV-1 showed the best and lowest scores in the docking as well as in the MM-GBSA study. However, CV-2 showed the best binding affinity (\u0394G scores) with DRB3*0202 (- showed the best results in the protein-protein docking study, it was considered as the best vaccine construct among the three constructed vaccines (Figure 09 & Table 15 ). Later, the molecular dynamics simulation study and in silico codon adaptation studies were conducted only on the CV-1 vaccine. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.935072 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nThe results of molecular dynamics simulation of CV-1-TLR-8 docked complex is illustrated in Figure 10 . Dynamic simulation of proteins gives easy determination of the stability and physical movements of their atoms and molecules [182] . So, the simulation is carried out to determine the relative stability of the vaccine protein. The deformability graph of the complex illustrates the peaks representing the regions of the protein with moderate degree of deformability (Figure 10b) .\n\nThe B-factor graph of the complex gives easy visualization and comparison between the NMA and the PDB field of the docked complex (Figure 10c) . The eigenvalue of the docked complex is depicted in Figure 10d . CV-1 and TLR8 docked complex generated quite good eigenvalue of 3.817339e-06. The variance graph illustrates the individual variance by red colored bars and cumulative variance by green colored bars (Figure 10e) . Figure 10f depicts the co-variance map of the complex, where red color represents the correlated motion between a pair of residues, uncorrelated motion is indicated by white color as well as the anti-correlated motion is marked by blue color. The elastic map of the complex refers to the connection between the atoms and darker gray regions indicate stiffer regions (Figure 09g ) [167] - [169] .\n\nSince the CV-1 protein had 596 amino acids, after reverse translation, the number nucleotides of the probable DNA sequence of CV-1 would be 1788. The codon adaptation index (CAI) value of 1.0 of CV-1 indicated that the DNA sequences contained higher proportion of the codons that should be used by the cellular machinery of the target organism E. coli strain K12 (codon bias).\n\nFor this reason, the production of the CV-1 vaccine should be carried out efficiently [183] [184] .\n\nThe GC content of the improved sequence was 51.34% (Figure 11) . The predicted DNA sequence of CV-1 was inserted into the pET-19b vector plasmid between the SgrAI and SphI restriction sites . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

The pneumonia has already caused the death of several thousands of people worldwide. For this reason, possible vaccines were predicted in this study to fight against this lethal virus. To carry out the vaccine construction, four candidate proteins of the virus were identified and selected from the NCBI database. Only highly antigenic sequences were selected for further analysis since the highly antigenic proteins can induce better immunogenic response [185, 201] . Because the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein were found to be antigenic, they were taken into consideration for vaccine construction.\n\nThe physicochemical property analysis was conducted for the two predicted antigenic proteins.\n\nThe extinction coefficient can be defined as the amount of light that is absorbed by a particular compound at a certain wavelength [186] [187] . Surface glycoprotein had the highest predicted extinction co-efficient of 148960 M -1 cm -1 . The aliphatic index of a protein corresponds to the relative volume occupied by the aliphatic amino acids in the side chains of the protein, for example: alanine, valine etc. [188] [189] . Surface glycoprotein also had the highest predicted aliphatic index among the two proteins (84.67). For this reason, surface glycoprotein had greater amount of aliphatic amino acids in its side chain than the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. The grand average of hydropathicity value (GRAVY) for a protein is calculated as the sum of hydropathy values of all the amino acids of the protein, divided by the number of residues in its sequence [190] . Surface [191] - [195] . The possible T-cell and Bcell epitopes of the selected proteins were determined by the IEDB (https://www.iedb.org/) server.\n\nThe epitopes with high antigenicity, non-allergenicity and non-toxicity were selected to vaccine construction. The B-cell epitopes (predicted by the server) that were more than ten amino acids long were taken into consideration and the antigenic and non-allergenic epitopes were selected for vaccine construction. However, most of the epitopes were found to be residing within the cell membrane.\n\nThe cluster analysis of the MHC alleles which may interact with the selected epitopes during the immune response, showed quite good interaction with each other. Next the 3D structures of the selected epitopes were generated for peptide-protein docking study. The docking was carried out . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Since all the epitopes generated quite good docking scores, it can be concluded that, all of them had the capability to bind with their respective targets and induce potential immune response. However, among the selected epitopes, QLESKMSGK, LIRQGTDYKHWP, GVLTESNKK and TSNFRVQPTESI generated the best docking scores.\n\nAfter the successful docking study, the vaccine construction was performed. The linkers were used to connect the T-cell and B-cell epitopes among themselves and also with the adjuvant sequences as well as the PADRE sequence. The vaccines, with three different adjuvants, were constructed and designated as: CV-1, CV-2 and CV-3. Since all the three vaccines were found to be antigenic, they should be able to induce good immune response. Moreover, all of them were possibly nonallergenic, they should not be able to cause any allergenic reaction within the body as per in silico The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.935072 doi: bioRxiv preprint antigen. Moreover, the conventional approach of vaccine development have raised many safety concerns in many pre-clinical and clinical trials. The subunit vaccines like the vaccines predicted in the study could overcome such difficulties [196] - [200] . Finally, this study recommends CV-1 as the best vaccine to be an effective worldwide treatment based on the strategies employed in the study to be triggered against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, further in vivo and in vitro experiments are suggested to strengthen the findings of this study.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 has caused one of the deadliest outbreaks in the recent times. Prevention of the newly emerging infection is very challenging as well as mandatory. The potentiality of in silico methods can be exploited to find desired solutions with fewer trials and errors and thus saving both time and costs of the scientists. In this study, potential subunit vaccines were designed against the SARS-CoV-2 using various methods of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. To design the vaccines, the highly antigenic viral proteins as well as epitopes were used. Various computational studies of the suggested vaccine constructs revealed that these vaccines might confer good immunogenic response. For this reason, if satisfactory results are achieved in various in vivo and in vitro tests and trials, these suggested vaccine constructs might be used effectively for vaccination to prevent the coronavirus infection and spreading. Therefore, our present study should help the scientists to develop potential vaccines and therapeutics against the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus 2019.
