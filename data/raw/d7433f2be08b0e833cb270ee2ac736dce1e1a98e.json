{"title": "S4 Appendix: Multilevel ERGM Goodness of Fit", "body": ".2 shows the additional goodness-of-fit results arising from treating the network as multilevel. In particular, results for female-bipartite, male-bipartite, and female-bipartite-male network interactions are shown. All statistics are fit to an acceptable standard. Because the same-sex networks are fixed, graph statistics without bipartite edges show zero variation. The ability of this model specification to closely capture all these features of the empirical network, including ones not explicitly modelled, is strong evidence that a useful model has been specified.
