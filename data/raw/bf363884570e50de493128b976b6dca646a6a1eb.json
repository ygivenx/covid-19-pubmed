{"title": "", "body": "Editorial Critical care nursing: expanding beyond critical care\n\nIn this edition of the journal we have continued with a recent innovation whereby keynote nursing speakers from the previous annual scientific meeting provide a guest editorial on a key area of interest from their area of practice. Anne Wojner from Texas discusses a major research project on stroke which demonstrates the versatility of critical care nurses in a community role. These guest editorials are organised through Leanne Aitken, who has recently successfully re-nominated as an associate editor to ACC. Professor Doug Etliott chose not to re-nominate to the editorial committee; I would personally like to acknowledge Doug's outstanding contribution to the journal over the last four years of his term and thank him for his support, particularly in working to establish the ACCCN webpage and move the journal towards electronic publishing.
