{"title": "The Netherlands) NEONATAL DIARRHEA IN CALVES AND PIGS", "body": "economic importance but also of great relevance for the understanding of the pathogenesis of intestinal disorders in man.\n\nThis symposium proved to be very fruitful and the study of its proceedings offers a great deal of information.\n\nIt was pointed out (S.D. Acres, C.A. Mebus and M. Morin) that neonatal diarrhea is a multifactorial disease with the preponderance of some bacterial, viral and parasitic agents (enteropathogenic E. coil, Coronavirus, Reoviruslike organisms) and even the 20--30% of cases with unidentified etiology are considered to be infectious processes.\n\nThe influence of the environment, i.e., climate, housing, nutrition, is enormous.\n\nC.L. Gyles gave a very competent and impressive outline on the genetics of E. coll. This is no longer a science to be anxiously avoided by the practising clinician because of the hygienic and epidemiologic significance of the plasmid-born multiple resistance. The problem of the control of neonatal diarrhea by immunization procedures has been amply discussed by L.L. Myers, M.R. Wilson, I. McCallum and G. Khachatourians and the clinical treatment by O.R. Radostits as well. It seems that considerable progress has been made, for instance by the use of the K88 antigen as an immunogen. The antibody thus produced should be protective by prevention of the adhesion of enteropathogenic coli strains to the epithelial cell. Also bacterins and E. coil vaccines of minicell cultures and immunoglobulin preparations have been successfully used.\n\nOther authors presented their recent experiments on E. coil enterotoxins and offered pathogenetic considerations. A _fine _and very clear summation aiming at recommendations for future research and for measurements to be taken by veterinarians and the authorities, is given by H.W. Moon, who is himself one of the most competent investigators in this field.\n\nThis kind of symposium is very useful. It brings people working on different aspects of a given entity together ~.~d reflects the present standard of knowledge. It is a pleasure to be informed in such a concise way by this booklet.\n\n(Btern, Switzerland) Veterinary Microbiology, 3 (1978) Oxford English Dictionary or in Webster's Dictionary, but in either case it must be consistent within each article. 2. Submit the original and two copies of your manuscript. Enclose the original illustrations and two sets of photo-copies (three prints cf any photographs). 3. Manuscripts should be typewritten, typed on one side of the paper, with wide margins and double spacing throughout, including abstracts, footnotes and references.\n\nEvery page of the manuscript should be numbered in the upper right-hand corner, including title page, references, tables, etc. However, in the text no reference should be made to page numbers; if necessary, one may refer to sections. Underline words that should be in italics, and do not underline any other words. Avoid excessive usage of italics to emphasize part of the text. 4. When corrections are necessary in a manuscript, never follow the same rules as for proof correction. Small corrections s~ ould be inserted between the lines, and the place where they should go must be clearly marked. Large corrections are to be typed on separate sheets. 5. Manuscripts should in general be organized in the following order:\n\nTitle (please try to avoid long title~) Author 6. In typing the manuscript, titles and subtitles should not be run within the text. They should be typed on a separate line, without indentation. Use lower-case lettertype, do not use superfluous capitals and do not underline titles; the marking of headings should be left to the copy editor. 7. Cross-references cannot be finally inserted until the page proof is available. Type them: \"see page 000\". In the margin pencil the page number of the cross-reference in the manuscript.\n\n8. SI units should be used. Temperature must be expressed in Centigrade (C) or Kelvin (K) scales. 9. If a special instruction to the copy editor or printer is written on the copy it should be encircled. The printer will then know that the enclosed matter is not to be set in type. When a typewritten character may have mo-e than one meaning (e.g., the lowercase letter ! may be confused with the numeral 1 ), a note should be inserted in a circle in the margin to make the meaning clear to the printer. If Greek letters or uncommon symbols are used in the manuscript, they should be written very clearly, and if necessary a note such as \"Greek lower-case chi\" should be put in the margin and encircled. 10. After having written the first draft of your paper, review the structure of your manuscript. Examine whether the sections are arranged in logical sequence and the arrangement of paragraphs within sections is logical and orderly. Evaluate whether all information assembled is relevant for the purpose of the manuscript or whether some could be deleted, and whether any specialized jargon could be eliminated. 1!.\n\nElsevier reserves the privilege of returning to the author for revision accepted manuscripts and illustrations which are not in the proper form given in this guide.\n\n1. An abstract not longer than 500 words should be included with the manuscript. 2. At the beginning of each abstract provide the complete bibliographic entry by which the paper will be referenced. 3. In addition to the English abstract, abstracts in French and/or German will be published if the author so desires and submits them with his manuscript. They will not be checked by the publisher. Illustrations should be designed with the format of the page of the jouhml in mind. Fold-outs can only be accepted in exceptional cases. Illustrations should be of such a size as to allow a reduction of 50%.\n\nLettering should be in Indian ink or by printed labels. Make sure that the size of the \u2022 lettering is big enough to allow a reduction of 50% without becoming illegible. The lettering should be in English. Use the same kind oI lettering throughout and follow the style of the journal. 6.\n\nIf a scale should be given, use bar scales on all illustrations instead cf numerical scales that must be~changed with reduction. 7.\n\nEach illustration should have a caption. The captions to all figures sho~.~!d be typed on a separate sheet of the manuscript. 8.\n\nExplanations should be given in the typewritter, legend. Drawn \"text in the figures should be kept to a minimum.\n\nPhotographs are only acceptable if they have good contrast and intensRy. Sharp and glossy copies are required. Reproductions of photographs already printed cannot be accepted.\n\nLine drawings can be made or improved by Elsevier, at the author's expense.\n\nColour illustrations cannot usually be included, unless the cost of their reproduction is paid for by the author. 2m\" 6. Equations should be numbered serially on the right-hand side and in parentheses.\n\nOnly equations explicitly referred to in the text need in general b,e numbered. 7. The use of fractional powers instead of root signs is recommended. Also powers of e are often more conveniently denoted by exp. 8. Levels of statistical significance which can be mentioned without further explanation are *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001. 9. In the chemical formulae, valence of ions should be given as, e.g., Ca 2 \u00f7 and CO~-, not as Ca ++ or CO:-. 10. Isotope numbers should precede the symbols, e.g., ~sO. 11. The repeated writing of chemical formulae in the ~xt is to be avoided where reasonably possible; instead, the name of the compound should be given in full. Exceptions may be made in the case of a very long name occurring very frequently, or in the case of a compound being described as the end product of a gravimetric determination (e.g., phosphate as P205). Footnotes 1. Footnotes should only be used if absolutely essential. In most cases it will be possible to incorporate the inforrration in normal text. 2. If used, they should be numbered in the text, indicated by superscript numbers, and kept as short as possible."}
