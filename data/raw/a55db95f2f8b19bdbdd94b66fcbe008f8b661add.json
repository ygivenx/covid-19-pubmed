{"title": "Synthesis of a 3 0 -C-ethynyl-b-D-ribofuranose purine nucleoside library: Discovery of C7-deazapurine analogs as potent antiproliferative nucleosides", "body": "Nucleoside analogs are the cornerstones for antiviral therapy with notable successes in the treatment of HIV and Hepatitis C virus infections [1] . Furthermore, nucleoside analogs have also found widespread use in oncology, with most approved derivatives active against various forms of lymphomas [1e3] .\n\nA focused screening library, comprised of nucleoside analogs surrounding a single modified D-ribofuranose moiety could be a viable strategy to discover attractive hits for the aforementioned disease areas, as evidenced by a number of recent publications [4e14] . In this paper, a rather underrepresented 3 0 -C-ethynylribofuranose motif [15e18] was used as the sugar scaffold to construct a small library of nucleoside analogs. Previous reports mainly focused on pyrimidine (-like) nucleobase moieties [17, 19] , structurally resembling the cytidine analog, ECyd (1, Fig. 1 ), which emerged as the most promising derivative from the initial discovery of 3 0 -C-ethynyl nucleosides in 1996 [15] . ECyd has been evaluated in clinical trials as a new antitumoral agent [3] and recently attracted renewed interest as a combination therapy, e.g. with carboplatin [3] , or as part of a 'duplex drug', in which it is linked to 2 0 -deoxy-5-fluorouridine [20] .\n\nThe purine counterparts on the other hand, exemplified by the 3 0 -C-ethynyladenosine analog (EAdo, 5), have received little attention, which motivated us to combine this peculiar 3 0 -C-ethynyl sugar element with different purine nucleobases to build a focused library. Previously we reported a series of C2-and C6-substituted purine analogs (4, Fig. 1 ) of 3 0 -C-ethynyladenosine (EAdo, 5) [21] . Considering the interesting biological properties reported for nucleosides comprising a C6 arylpurine [22, 23] (e.g. 2, Fig. 1 ) or a C7substituted-7-deazapurine base, which was recently coined a 'privileged scaffold' [24] and is part of the natural nucleoside antibiotic tubercidin (3) [24e26], in this contribution we investigate the effect(s) of combining these base moieties with the 3 0 -Cethynylribofuranose moiety.\n\nThe target nucleoside analogs were prepared by Vorbr\u00fcggen glycosylation using either acetate (6, Scheme 1) [21] or benzoate (18, Scheme 2) [15] protected sugar precursors. Reaction conditions depended on the type of nucleobase (purine [21] vs. 7-deazapurine analogs [27] ). Synthesis of the 6-substituted purine analogs 13e17 was accomplished via Suzuki reaction of the 6-chloropurine nucleoside 7 with appropriate phenylboronic acids [22] . Final compounds were obtained after deprotection with NH 3 /MeOH (Scheme 1).\n\nFor the synthesis of the C7-modified 7-deazanucleosides 1 (Scheme 2), the use of the aforementioned sugar precursor 6 only provided the desired glycosylation product in low yield after cumbersome purification procedures. Switching to the benzoate protected sugar derivative 18 [15] improved the coupling yields [27] , but the isolated glycosylation products were contaminated with residues of glycosyl donor degradation products (tentative assignment based on 1 H NMR data; not shown). Treatment of the crude intermediates 19e22 with NH 3 /MeOH [27] (or NH 4 OH [28] ) at elevated (>100 C) temperatures caused decomposition. Therefore, an alternative protocol to introduce the 6-amino group was employed [29, 30] . Nucleophilic displacement of the 6-chloride with sodium azide efficiently delivered the corresponding azide derivatives (23e26), which generally could be obtained in pure form due to the marked difference in polarity induced by the predominating tetrazolo tautomer. Staudinger reduction furnished the corresponding 6-amino derivatives. Deprotection afforded the final compounds (31, 32, 33, 34) . To dehalogenate the 7-iodo intermediate 26, it was subjected to I/Mg exchange using Knochel's iPrMgCl.LiCl [26, 31] , and the magnesiated intermediate was quenched with aqueous acid to give 35 in good yield. Further conversion to 37 was realized as described above. Introduction of a furan-2-yl moiety was achieved via an aqueous Suzuki reaction on 34 [25] . Remarkably, Suzuki reaction on the 7-iodo-7-deazapurine substrate gave significantly lower yields than reaction with the 6chloropurine starting material.\n\nA similar glycosylation strategy was followed to synthetize the C7 (C5) 2 trifluoromethyl analog 49 from 39 (upper line in Scheme 3) [35, 36] by treating commercial 4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo [2,3-d] (ii) TMSOTf, 1,2-dichloroethane, reflux, 81%; b) (substituted) phenylboronic acid, K 2 CO 3 , Pd(Ph 3 P) 4 , toluene, 100 C, 30e52%; c) 7 N NH 3 /MeOH, 43e75%. 1 In the body of the text, purine numbering will be used for nucleoside analogs; however in the Experimental section, IUPAC nomenclature and pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine numbering will be applied. 2 In order to allow for a more facile comparison with the assigned NMR data provided in the Experimental section; pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine numbering is indicated for selected derivates in italic and between brackets. pyrimidine with the Langlois reagent (sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate) [35] . The presence of a 3 J H-1 0 -C-8 cross peak in the 1 H-13 C gHMBC spectrum of compound 48 (see Supporting Information) allowed to ascertain glycosylation at N9 (N7). However, a large coupling constant (J \u00bc 37. 8 Hz) observed for C8 (C6) was inconsistent with the CF 3 group being attached to C7 (C5). This led us to assign the structure of the trifluoromethylated compound prepared using Langlois' reagent as the C8 (C6) regio-isomer. The C7 (C5) substituted heterocycle 42 could be obtained from the known C7 (C5) iodide 40 [34] by subsequent N-Boc protection and trifluoromethylation using the Ruppert reagent [37] (the N-Boc protecting group was lost during the reaction). Comparison of the 1 H NMR spectra of both regioisomers 39 and 42 (see Supporting Information) led to the confirmation that 39 and thus also 48, are the C8 (C6) substituted isomers. Of note, a recent patent application [38] described both regio-isomers 39 and 42, in which the regiochemical assignment is opposite to our conclusions. The C7 substituted heterocycle 42 was used to synthetize the desired product 49, following the same reaction sequence as above.\n\nTo obtain the C7 ethynyl substituted analog 54 (Scheme 4) a Sonogashira reaction was envisioned. To avoid selectivity issues with the 3 0 -C-ethynyl group of 18, this group was protected with a TMS group (51) and glycosylated (52). After introduction of the C7 ethynyl chain [25] , 53 was transformed into 54 employing the same reaction sequence as described above. The synthesis of 3 0 -C-ethyl analog 59 started with catalytic hydrogenation of 18, giving rise to 55, which was subjected to glycosylation conditions. The glycosylation product 56 was directly used and elaborated as described above.\n\nFor the synthesis of 1,7-dideazapurine (7-azaindole or pyrrolo [2,3-b]pyridine) 3 nucleoside analogs (Schemes 5 and 6), commercially available 1H-4-chloro-pyrrolo [2,3-b] pyridine was halogenated with the appropriate halosuccinimide [34] . Glycosylation products were obtained using the same conditions as for their C7deazapurine counterparts. Lewis acid-mediated glycosylation with this type of heterocycle has only been reported once [39] . Generally, nucleobase-anion glycosylation [40] or acid-catalyzed fusion [41] are employed to ensure this transformation. Both regio-and stereochemistry were ascertained by 1 H-13 C gHMBC and 2D NOESY experiments (see Supporting Information). Deprotection with NH 3 / MeOH gave final products 66, 67 and 68. De-iodination by I/Mg exchange of 65 gave 69 in good yield, after which deprotection furnished 70. As expected, introduction of the C6 (C4) azido group on e.g. 63 was problematic due to the higher electron density of the pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine system with respect to the pyrrolo[2,3-d] pyrimidine system. No desired product could be detected after reaction with NaN 3 at 65 C, while gradual increase of the temperature to 100 C (and higher) only led to degradation.\n\nThese issues led us to introduce the azido group [42] before the glycosylation step (Scheme 6). Glycosylation, employing the same conditions as for the chloride-substituted heterocycles, was first attempted with 72, which afforded two products, 74 and 75. The identity of each isomer was assigned after Staudinger reduction to 76 and 77 (Scheme 6) to facilitate purification. The 1 H-13 C gHMBC spectrum of 76 and 77 showed a markedly different cross-peak pattern between H-1 0 and the heterocyclic moiety (see Supporting Information). The synthesis of iodo-substituted 79 was accomplished using the same conditions (the tentative N3 (N7) isomer could be observed from TLC analysis, but was not isolated nor formally characterized). Both intermediates (76 and 79) afforded, after deprotection with saturated NH 3 /MeOH, the desired nucleosides 80 and 81.\n\nribofuranosylpurine nucleosides [22, 23] , failed to display any inhibitory activity on the cell line proliferation. Remarkably, 3 0 -Cethynyl-7-deaza-adenosine (3 0 -C-ethynyltubercidin) 37, as well as its 7-halogenated analogs 31e34 inhibited the proliferation of the different tumor cell lines with nanomolar IC 50 values. The chloro (32) and bromo (33) analogs showed the highest antiproliferative activity irrespective of the cell line studied, while unsubstituted derivative 37 showed similar activity as EAdo (5) . Interestingly, the observed structure-antiproliferative activity relationship from this small subset significantly differs from that observed for the corresponding ribofuranose derivatives [25] . Furan-2-yl substituted analog 38 was found to only weakly inhibit tumor cell proliferation, which contrasts to the potent activity observed for the corresponding 7-(furan-2-yl)-7-deazaadenosine [25] . Similarly, the 7ethynyl analog 54 only showed weak antiproliferative activity, which also contrasts with the activity observed for the corresponding ribofuranose analog [25] . Saturation of the ethynyl substituent as in 59, resulted in two orders of magnitude lower IC 50 's than those for 32.\n\nThe 7-trifluoromethyl analog 49 gave submicromolar activity, while the corresponding C8 isomer 50 was completely devoid of activity, possibly due to a preferred anti-orientation of the purine ring for activity.\n\nTo investigate the importance of N1, we synthetized the 1,7dideazapurine or pyrrolo [2,3-b] pyridine analogs 66e68, 70 and 80 and 81. Interestingly, all the analogs elicited antiproliferative effects, most notably for the CEM cell line (C6 chloride analogs), except for 70. In the C6 chloride series, the antiproliferative activity correlated with halogen size (I > Br > Cl > H). While analog 80 was significantly less active than the related 32 (approximately 100fold); this was not the case for the iodo-substituted analog 81, which displayed potent antiproliferative activity, especially on the L1210 cell line.\n\nTo further explore the potential of these new nucleoside analogs, the most potent analogs (31e34 and 37) were selected for testing in the NCI-60 cell line panel [43, 44] . Tables 2 and 3 summarize the GI 50 values of representative cell lines. Full assay data as well as mean GI 50 graphs are provided in the Supporting Information.\n\nPotent growth inhibitory activity was observed for 32, 33 and 34, while 31 and 37 were less active. The activity spectrum of the former analogs was found to be broad, and especially pronounced for leukemia cell lines as observed for e.g. clofarabine. GI 50 values for several solid tumor cell lines (e.g. MCF-7, HCT-116, U251, NCI-H460) are below 100 nM.\n\nAdditionally, these analogs were evaluated for their potential to inhibit the cell proliferation of three different endothelial cell types. Agents capable of modifying the tumor vasculature, either by antiangiogenic or vascular-disrupting action, are of interest for antitumor therapies both as single agents and in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs. Disruption of vascular networks in solid tumors may induce their collapse by deprivation of oxygen and other nutrients [45] . Nucleoside analogs 31e34, 37 were found to potently inhibit the proliferation of the three endothelial cell types studied, with the halogenated derivatives 32 (Cl) and 33 (Br) being most potent. Unfortunately, these analogs also significantly inhibited the proliferation of Hel-fibroblasts.\n\nEncouraged by the strong in vitro anti-proliferative activity of analogs 31e34, 37, 49 and 81 against various tumor cell lines Scheme 5. Reagents and conditions: a) appropriate N-halosuccinimide, DMF, 93% (Tables 1e3), analog 32 was selected for in vivo evaluation of its antitumor activity in a metastatic breast cancer xenograft mouse model employing MDA-MB-231 (LM2) cells expressing firefly luciferase [46] . Antitumor activity was assessed by measurement of both the BLI signal ( Fig. 2 , Panel A) and the tumor volume (Panel B). LM2 cells were orthotopically engrafted in SCID mice and treatment commenced once the tumor was palpable (day 10). Compound 32 was injected intratumorally (0.3 mg/kg) 3 times a week for two consecutive weeks. The tumor growth was significantly retarded starting from day 18, i.e. after four i.t. injections, as measured by bioluminescent radiance (Panel A). The reduced tumor growth was also obvious when the tumor size was measured using a digital caliper (Panel B). At day 35, mice were sacrificed and the tumors removed, after which they were macroscopically examined (Panel B). The average control tumor weight was 551 \u00b1 74 mg versus 241 \u00b1 61 mg for the treatment group.\n\nTo analyze the effect of 32 on lung metastasis, mice were covered with a black paper during imaging to shield the primary tumor. Interestingly, the total metastasis burden in the lungs was significantly lower in the treated group at day 34 versus the vehicle control group (Panel C). This indicates that the nucleoside analog not only exhibits antitumor activity but also reduces breast cancer metastasis to secondary organs.\n\nMost analogs either showed no antiviral activity up to the highest concentration tested (100 mM) when assayed against a panel of relevant viruses (see Experimental section), or the activity was accompanied by significant toxicity for the host cell, making the derivatives non-specific (data not shown). Only a few analogs combined antiviral activities with acceptable selectivity indices.\n\nThe results are summarized in Table 5 & Table 6 . EAdo (5) showed activity against vaccinia virus (Table 5) , although it also potently inhibited Hel cell line proliferation (Table 6 ). Activity against vaccinia virus and HSV-2 was also found for 59, which, however generally inhibited cell proliferation (see also Table 1 ). The most promising antiviral activity was found for compound 66, which exhibited potent activity against human cytomegalovirus (hCMV), with a reasonable selectivity index (10-fold). Other halogen-substituted derivatives 67 (Br) and 68 (I) displayed elevated cytotoxicity and are therefore non-selective. Apparently, the observed activity is specific for halogen bearing compounds, as the parent compound without halogen (70) was inactive. Furthermore, changing the 6-chloride for an amino group, mimicking a natural adenine, was detrimental for the activity (compare 66 and 80).\n\nWe have developed a nucleoside library around a 3 0 -C-ethynylribofuranose moiety, which was combined with several purine nucleobases that bear substituents, which were previously found to confer biological activity when combined with other sugar motifs. While 6-aryl purine nucleoside analogs 13e17 were devoid of antiproliferative or antiviral activity, the 7-halogenated 7deazapurine analogs (31e34), as well as trifluoromethylated derivative 49 and the C7 unsubstituted analog 37 were found to significantly inhibit the growth of three tumor cell lines. Their spectrum of activity was thoroughly investigated (except for 49) by assaying against the NCI-60 panel, which also revealed nanomolar activity against several solid tumor derived cell lines. Removal of the N7 nitrogen and introduction of substitutions at C7 (particularly halogens, derivatives 31e34) was shown to lead to significantly more potent antiproliferative nucleosides than the C2/C6 modified derivatives we have previously reported. Additionally, analogs 31e34 potently inhibited proliferation of endothelial cell types, which could be particularly interesting for the treatment of solid tumors. As a proof-of-concept, analog 32 was investigated in a metastatic breast cancer xenograft mouse model. This derivative inhibited both tumor growth as well as metastasis as assessed by means of BLI. However, 32 also potently inhibited in vitro proliferation of Hel-fibroblasts, requiring further optimization to improve on selectivity. Several 1,7-dideaza-3-C-ethynyl analogs were prepared and some of them found to be potent inhibitors of human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) in vitro. Particularly, analog 66 requires further evaluation.\n\nIn conclusion, the results presented in this paper showcase the utility of screening a focused nucleoside library for both antiviral as well as antiproliferative activity as a means of finding novel hits for further elaboration.\n\nAll reagents and solvents were obtained from standard commercial sources and were of analytical grade. Unless otherwise specified, they were used as received. 6 [21] , 18 [15] , were prepared according to literature procedures. Halogenated heterocycles 4chloro-5-halo-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine: 5-fluoro [32, 33] , 5-chloro [34] , 5-bromo [34] , 5-iodo (40) [34] , were prepared from commercially available 4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine employing literature conditions.\n\nAll moisture sensitive reactions were carried out under argon atmosphere. Reactions were carried out at ambient temperature unless otherwise indicated.

After glycosylation, both the correct stereochemistry at C1' (b) and the correct regiochemistry (N9; purine numbering) of the glycosylation products was ascertained by means of 2D NMR techniques (2D NOESY, \n\na Antiviral activity is expressed as EC 50 values (mM) and represent the concentration of test compound necessary to reduce viral-induced cytopathogenicity by 50%. b MCC or minimal cytotoxic concentration represents the concentration of test compound that is able to cause a microscopically detectable alteration of normal cell morphology. c CC 50 represents the concentration (mM) of test compound that reduces cell (Hel) proliferation by 50% as determined by Coulter Counter. 1 H-13 C gHMBC, respectively), either on the protected or on the deprotected derivative (depending on peak resolution). Melting points were determined on a B\u00fcchi-545 apparatus and are uncorrected. Purity was assessed by means of analytical LC-MS employing either:\n\n(1) Waters Alliance 2695 XE separation Module using a Phenomenex Luna \u00ae reversed-phase C18 (2) column (3 mm, 100 \u00c2 2.00 mm) and a gradient system of HCOOH in All obtained final compounds had purity >95%, as assayed by analytical HPLC (UV) unless otherwise indicated.\n\nIn a flame-dried 25 mL round-bottom flask, equipped with a stir bar was added under argon, 6-chloro purine nucleoside derivative 6 (0.5 mmol, 1 eq.), the corresponding boronic acid (1.5 eq.), anhydrous K 2 CO 3 (1.5 eq.) and Pd(Ph 3 P) 4 (0.05 eq.). The flask was evacuated and refilled with argon three times. Then, anhydrous degassed toluene (5 mL, 10 mL/mmol SM) was added and the mixture stirred for approximately 5 min before being heated to 100 C. After TLC monitoring showed full conversion of the starting material (~2e4h), the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, filtered and evaporated till dryness. The residue was purified by column chromatography (0 / 5% acetone/DCM).\n\nThe ester protected nucleoside (1 eq.) was dissolved in 7N NH 3 in MeOH and stirred at ambient temperature until TLC showed full conversion (generally overnight to 36h). Then, the mixture was evaporated to dryness and the residue purified by column chromatography (typically 2 / 10% MeOH/DCM). \n\nIn a flame-dried 2-neck round bottom flask, equipped with a stir bar was added the appropriate heterocycle (1.1 eq.) under argon. Then, anhydrous MeCN (7.5 mL/mmol SM) was added, followed by BSA (1.2 eq.). The resulting suspension was stirred at ambient temperature for approximately 10 min; after which a clear solution was obtained. Then, glycosyl donor, 18 [15] (1 eq.) was added in one portion, immediately followed by TMSOTf (1.25 eq.). The resulting solution was stirred at ambient temperature for another 15 min, and then transferred to a pre-heated oil bath at 80 C. Heating was continued until TLC analysis showed full consumption of the starting material (~2e3h), after which the mixture was cooled to ambient temperature. EA was added, and the mixture poured into a sat. aq. NaHCO 3 solution. The layers were separated and the water layer extracted twice more with EA. The organic layers were combined, dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and evaporated till dryness. The residue was purified by column chromatography 15% EA/Hexanes.\n\nThe appropriate chloro-nucleoside (1 eq.) was dissolved in DMF (10 mL/mmol). Then, NaN 3 (2 eq.) was added and the mixture stirred at 65 C for 30 min. Then, the mixture was cooled to ambient temperature after which it was poured into half-saturated aq. NaHCO 3 solution and EA. The layers were separated and the water layer extracted two more times with EA. The organic layers were combined, dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and evaporated till dryness. The residue was purified by column chromatography (EA/Hexanes) to yield the protected azidonucleoside.\n\nThe appropriate azidonucleoside (1 eq.) was dissolved in THF (10 mL/mmol). Then, PMe 3 solution (1 M in THF; 2 eq.) was added and the mixture stirred at ambient temperature until TLC analysis showed full conversion of starting material (generally 30 min to 1 h). Next, the solution was evaporated till dryness, and subsequently re-dissolved in MeCN (10 mL/mmol). To this solution was added a 1 M aq. HOAc solution (3.33 eq.), and the mixture heated in a pre-heated oil bath at 65 C for 1h. Next, the mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and poured into sat. aq. NaHCO 3 solution. DCM was added, layers were separated, and the water layer extracted two more times with DCM. The organic layers were combined, dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and evaporated till dryness.\n\nPurification by column chromatography (EA/Hexanes) gave rise to the protected nucleoside aminopurine. 22 2 was prepared according to a literature procedure [22] . Spectral data are in accordance with literature values [22] . 1 \n\n6-chloropurine (0.46 g, 2.94 mmol, 1.5 eq.) was suspended in HMDS (16 mL, 8 mL/mmol SM) and a catalytic amount of (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 was added. The mixture was then refluxed overnight. After cooling to ambient temperature, the resulting solution was carefully evaporated till dryness, and the resulting oil further dried at high vacuum (~1 h). Then, anhydrous 1,2-dichloroethane (16 mL, 8 mL/ mmol SM) was added to dissolve the silylated heterocycle, after which 6 [21] (0.67 g, 1.96 mmol, 1 eq.) was added via syringe, immediately followed by TMSOTf (0.71 mL, 3.91 mmol, 2 eq.). The resulting solution was subsequently refluxed for approximately 30 min and cooled to ambient temperature. Then, the mixture was poured into sat. aq. NaHCO 3 , and DCM was added. The layers were separated, and the water layer extracted twice more with DCM. The organic layers were combined, dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and evaporated till dryness. The residue was purified by column chromatography 5 / 7.5% acetone/DCM to give 7 (0.693 g, 1.59 mmol) as a white foam in 81% yield. 1 [Remark: correct stereo-and regiochemistry was ascertained by transforming a small amount into 3 0 -C-ethynyladenosine (5) and comparing NMR data to literature reference; [15] which confirmed the correct structure]. (19) 19 was prepared according to General Procedure C. 18 (0.63 g, 1.2 mmol) gave rise to 19 (0.246 g) as a white foam, containing some impurities. Therefore, 19 was immediately used in the next step. (20) 20 was prepared according to General Procedure C. 18 (0.8 g, 1.5 mmol) gave rise to 20 (0.39 g) as a yellow foam, containing some impurities. Therefore, 20 was immediately used in the next step. (22) 22 was prepared according to General Procedure C. 18 (1.69 g, 3.2 mmol) gave rise to 22 (1.25 g) as a yellow foam, containing some impurities. Therefore, 22 was immediately used in the next step. (23) 23 was prepared according to General Procedure D. 19 (0.246 g, 0.385 mmol) gave rise to 23 (0.14 g, 0.217 mmol) as a white solid in 56% yield. Purification: 0 / 30% EA/Hexanes. 1 (24) 24 was prepared according to General Procedure D. 20 (0.38 g, 0.579 mmol) gave rise to 24 (0.16 g, 0.24 mmol) as a slightly yellow foam in 41% yield. Purification: 0 / 60% EA/Hexanes. 1 [2,3-d] pyrimidine (29) 29 was prepared by employing a sequence of General Procedure C, D & E. As such, 18 (0.53 g, 1.0 mmol) gave rise to 29 (0.077 g, 0.113 mmol) as a white foam in 11% yield. 1 (35) 26 (0.22 g, 0.292 mmol, 1 eq.) was co-evaporated with anhydrous toluene (10 mL) three times. Then, the resulting foam was dissolved in anhydrous toluene (2.5 mL, 8.5 mL/mmol SM) under argon and cooled to e65 C. After stirring at this temperature for 15 min, iPrMgCl.LiCl (1.3 M in THF, 0.45 mL, 0.583 mmol, 2 eq.) was added dropwise with the help of a syringe pump (70 mL/min). After complete addition, the mixture was stirred at e65 C for~30min, after which the cooling was removed, and aq. sat. NH 4 Cl was added. Then, the mixture was diluted with EA and additional water was added. The layers were separated, and the water layer extracted twice more with EA. The organic layers were combined, dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and evaporated. the residue was purified by column chromatography 0 / 10% Et 2 O/Toluene to give 35 (0.14 g, 0.222 mmol) as a white foam in 76% yield. 1 (38) 34 (0.086 g, 0.207 mmol, 1 eq.), furan-2-boronic acid (0.035 g, 0.31 mmol, 1.5 eq.), Na 2 CO 3 (0.2 g, 1.86 mmol, 9 eq.), Pd(OAc) 2 (0.002 g, 0.01 mmol, 0.05 eq.) and TPPTS (0.018 g, 0.031 mmol, 0.15 eq.) were added to a 10 mL round-bottom flask, equipped with a stir bar. Next, the flask was evacuated and refilled with argon. This procedure was repeated three times in total. Next, degassed MeCN (0.75 mL) and H 2 O (1.5 mL) were added to the solids under argon. After 5 min of stirring, the mixture was heated to 100 C in a preheated oil bath. When the starting material was fully consumed (30 min), the mixture was cooled to ambient temperature, and neutralized (pH~7) with 0.5 M aq. HCl. The mixture was evaporated till dryness, resuspended in MeOH and evaporated (three times). Next, the mixture was adsorbed onto Celite \u00ae (from MeOH) and eluted over a short silica pad (~5 cm) with 20% MeOH/DCM. The liquid was evaporated in vacuo and purified by column chromatography 1 /10% MeOH/DCM, to give 38 (0.022 g, 0.061 mmol) as a white solid in 29% yield.

After stirring at that temperature for~10 min, 70% aq. tBuOOH (1.4 mL, 10 mmol, 5 eq.) was added dropwise (0.1 mL/min). When the addition was complete, the ice bath was removed, and vigorous stirring continued for 3 days. Then, the mixture was partitioned between sat. aq. NaHCO 3 solution and DCM, and the layers separated. The water layer was extracted twice more with DCM. The combined organic layers were dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and evaporated till dryness. Purification by column chromatography 16% EA/Hexanes gave 39 (0.05 g, 0.226 mmol) as a white solid in 11% yield. 1 19 F NMR (282 MHz, CDCl 3 ) d: \u00c061.6. 13 C NMR (75 MHz, CDCl 3 ) d: 101.6 (q, J \u00bc 3.5 Hz, 1C, C-5), 117.5 (C-4a), 120.5 (q, J \u00bc 267. 9 Hz, 1H, CF 3 ), 128.5 (q, J \u00bc 40.1 Hz, 1C, C-6), 151.6, 152.4 (C-2), 155.7. Spectral data were in accordance with literature values [35] .\n\n40 [34] (0.84 g, 3 mmol, 1 eq.) was suspended in anhydrous 1,4dioxane (12 mL, 4 mL/mmol SM). Then, DMAP (0.073 g, 0.6 mmol, 0.2 eq.) was added, followed by DBU (0.9 mL, 6 mmol, 2 eq.). Next, Boc 2 O (2.07 mL, 9 mmol, 3 eq.) was added dropwise and the resulting mixture was stirred at ambient temperature overnight. Next, the mixture was added to sat. aq. NH 4 Cl, and EA/water was added. The layers were separated, and the water layer extracted twice more with EA. The organic layers were combined, dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and evaporated till dryness. The residue was purified by column chromatography (15% EA/Hexanes) to yield 41 (1.09 g, 2.87 mmol) as a slightly yellow solid in 96% yield. 1 \n\nIn a flame dried culture flask, equipped with a stir bar, was added under argon: 41 (0.76 g, 2 mmol, 1 eq.), KF (0.349 g, 6 mmol, 3 eq.), CuI (0.076 g, 0.4 mmol, 0.2 eq.) and 1,10-phenanthroline (0.072 g, 0.4 mmol, 0.2 eq.). The flask was evacuated and refilled with argon three times. Then, anhydrous DMSO (4 mL, 2 mL/mmol SM) was added, followed by B(OMe) 3 and TMSCF 3 . The mixture was submerged in a pre-heated oil bath at 60 C for 24h. Then, the mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature and partitioned between water and Et 2 O. The layers were separated, and the water layer extracted once more with Et 2 O. The combined organic layers were then washed with diluted aq. ammonia solution (1\u00c2), followed by brine (1\u00c2), and dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and evaporated till dryness. The residue was purified by column chromatography 3 / 4% acetone/DCM. The resulting product was found to be sufficiently pure for use in the next step (Vorbr\u00fcggen glycosylation). [However, the slight amount of remaining iodoheterocycle (40; thus without Boc protecting group) could be efficiently removed by employing a Sonogashira reaction [Pd(Ph 3 P) 2 Cl 2 (0.05 eq.), CuI (0.1 eq.), Et 3 N (0.2 mL/mmol), DMF (10 mL/mmol)] with butyn-1-ol (1 eq.)

The residue was purified by column chromatography (0 / 25% EA/Hexanes; three sequences), to give 53 (0.125 g, 0.158 mmol) as a yellowish foam in 39% yield. 1 18 (1.47 g, 2.78 mmol) was dissolved in EA (15 mL, 5 mL/mmol SM) under a nitrogen atmosphere. Then, a catalytic amount of Pd/C was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred under a hydrogen atmosphere (balloon) for approximately 7 h. Then, the mixture was flushed with nitrogen and filtered over a short pad of Celite \u00ae . The filtrate was evaporated till dryness and purified by column chromatography 15% EA/Hexanes to give 55 (1.37, 2.57 mmol) as white foam in 92% yield. 1 13 42 [Caution: this reaction employs large amounts of sodium azide in combination with mild acid as well as substantial heating, and can therefore be considered explosive (HN 3 )! No accidents have occurred when performing this reaction (>10 runs), however reaction scale has never exceeded 10 mmol of heterocycle SM. Additional protection by means of a blast shield, and closed fume hood is strongly recommended] 4-chloro-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine (0.765 g, 5 mmol, 1 eq.) was dissolved in DMF (15 mL, 3 mL/mmol SM), and NH 4 Cl (1.34 g, 25 mmol, 5 eq.) was added, followed by NaN 3 (1.63 g, 25 mmol, 5 eq.). the mixture was heated to 110 C behind a blast shield. After 7 h, the mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature, diluted with EA, and poured into half-sat. aq. NaHCO 3 solution. The layers were separated, and the water layer washed twice with EA. The organic layers were combined, dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and evaporated till dryness. The residue was purified by column chromatography (30% EA/PET) to give 71 (0.53 g, 3.32 mmol) as a white solid in 66% yield. Melting point: 180 C (decomposed). 1 \n\n[Caution: See note for 71 with regard to additional safety measures when performing this reaction!] 60 (0.53 g, 2.83 mmol, 1 eq.) and NH 4 Cl (0.62 g, 14.17 mmol, 5 eq.) were suspended in DMF (10 mL, 3 mL/mmol SM).

The mixture was stirred in the dark overnight. Then, ice-cold water (10 mL, 5 mL/mmol SM) was added and the resulting precipitate filtered. The solids were washed four additional times with ice-cold water (2 mL, 1 mL/mmol SM). The solid was collected and dried under high vacuum to give 73 (0.527 g, 1.85 mmol) as a yellow solid in 93% yield. Melting point: 192 C (decomposed). 1 L1210, HeLa and CEM cells [21] : All assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates. To each well were added (5e7.5) \u00c2 10 4 tumor cells and a given amount of the test compound. The cells were allowed to proliferate for 48 h (murine leukemia L1210 cells) or 72 h (human lymphocytic CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells) at 37 C in a humidified CO 2 -controlled atmosphere. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were counted in a Coulter counter (Analis, Belgium). The IC 50 (50% inhibitory concentration) was defined as the concentration of the compound that inhibited cell proliferation by 50%.\n\nNCI-60 evaluation: Assay protocols concerning NCI-60 tumor cell panel evaluation can be found in the following references: [43, 44] .\n\nEndothelial cells (ECs). Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-d) were purchased from Lonza (Verviers, Belgium) and the human microvascular endothelial cell line HMEC-1 was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atalanta, GA, USA). The ECs were seeded in gelatin-coated 48-well plates at 20,000 cells/well in EC growth medium (EGM2, Lonza) and after an overnight incubation, 5-fold dilutions of the compounds were added. The ECs were allowed to proliferate for four days in the presence of the compounds, trypsinized and counted by means of a Coulter counter to determine the IC 50 values.\n\nFemale severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were used at the age of 8 weeks. The animals were bred at the animal facility of the Rega Institute for Medical Research (KU Leuven, Belgium). The MDA-MB-231-LM2 lung metastatic cell line (clone 4715) was a kind gift of Prof. Massagu e [46] . LM2 cells (10 6 ) were suspended in 50% matrigel (BD Bioscience) in PBS and orthotopically engrafted in the exposed left, fourth inguinal mammary fat pad of anesthetized SCID mice. Once the tumor was palpable (day 10), 32 was injected intratumorally (i.t.) at 0.3 mg/kg in PBS containing 1% DMSO, 3 times a week, for 2-consecutive weeks. Control mice received only PBS with 1% DMSO.\n\nThe growth of luciferase-positive LM2 cells was quantified with an IVIS Spectrum imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA, USA). Before imaging, mice were anesthetized and injected subcutaneously with 150 mg/kg D-luciferin (PerkinElmer). Images were acquired every 2 min and plateau radiance values (photons/ sec) were retained. Lung metastasis was determined after shielding the primary tumor with a black paper. Tumor size was measured using a digital caliper and calculated with the following formula: tumor volume (mm 3 ) \u00bc 0.5 \u00c2 a x b 2 , where a is the longest diameter and b is the shortest diameter.\n\nEthics statement: All studies were done in compliance with the ethical guidelines for animal welfare of the KU Leuven (P277/2015).\n\nThe compounds were evaluated against the following viruses: herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) strain KOS, thymidine kinasedeficient (TK \u00c0 ) HSV-1 KOS strain resistant to ACV (ACV r ), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) strains Lyons and G, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) strain Oka, TK \u00c0 VZV strain 07\u00c01, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strains AD-169 and Davis, vaccinia virus Lederle strain, adenovirus-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strain Long, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Coxsackie B4, parainfluenza 3, influenza virus A (subtypes H1N1, H3N2), influenza virus B, Sindbis, reovirus-1, Punta Toro. The antiviral assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (Hel) fibroblasts, African green monkey cells (Vero), human epithelial cells (HeLa) or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) . Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (VZV) in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virusinfected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50%. Cytotoxic concentration was expressed as the MCC or minimal cytotoxic concentration being the compound concentration that was required to afford a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology.\n\nAssays involving hCMV and VZV were performed as described in literature [47] . In short; the antiviral assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (Hel) fibroblasts. Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of HCMV (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (VZV). After a 1e2 h, the residual virus was removed, and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity (hCMV) or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures (untreated controls). Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or concentration required for reducing virus-induced cytopathicity or viral plaque formation by 50%.\n\nDeclaration of interests: none."}
