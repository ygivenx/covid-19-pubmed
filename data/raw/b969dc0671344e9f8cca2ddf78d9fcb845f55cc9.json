{"title": "Chemokine profiling of Japanese encephalitis virus-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells by microarray and real-time RT-PCR: Implication in neuropathogenesis", "body": "Japanese encephalitis has become a major cause of mortality and morbidity in wide areas of south and southeast Asia and kept in a zoonotic transmission cycle between pigs or birds and mosquitoes (Burke et al., 2001; Solomon et al., 2003; Tsai, 2000) . JEV spreads to dead-end hosts, including humans, through the bite of JEV-infected mosquitoes and causes infection of the central nervous system, with a high mortality rate (Parida et al., 2006a) . JEV targets the CNS, clinically manifesting with fever, headache, vomiting, signs of meningeal irritation, and altered consciousness, leading to high mortality and neurological sequelae in some of those who survive (Kumar et al., 1990) . After entry into the host, JEV generates a rapid inflammatory response, including peripheral neutrophil leucocytosis or infiltration of neutrophils in extraneural tissue. Clinically, the infection of JEV results in increased levels of cytokines such as macrophage-derived chemotactic factor, TNF, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (Khanna et al., 1991; Ravi et al., 1997; Singh et al., 2000) . The increased levels of inflam-matory mediators appear to play a protective role or initiate an irreversible immune response leading to cell death. Despite the fact that Japanese encephalitis is a major disease affecting the tropical world, little is known of its pathogenesis due, partly, to the lack of a suitable animal model and the complex cell interactions in infected individuals. JEV tends to cause a neurotrophic infection, attacking neural rather than non-neural tissues in humans. Experimental studies in rats have demonstrated that neuron cells, especially developing neurons are the major target cells for infection. The role that neurons play in the induction of the immune response following CNS viral infection is poorly understood, largely owing to the belief that these cells are immunologically quiescent. In order to understand the nature and consequence at the transcriptional level, we have carried out the microarray analysis of mock-infected and JE virus-infected murine neuroblastoma cells. The microarray data was validated with qRT-PCR experiments and time point analysis was done to demonstrate the induction of chemokine by JEV-infected neurons as an early defense mechanism. We employed mouse neuronal cells (N2A) as a model system because of the permissiveness of these cells to JEV infection (Murali-Krishna et al., 1995; Yang et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2004; Hong-Lin et al., 2002) . In this study, we demonstrated that virus infection of neuronal cells results in the strong induction of proinflammatory chemokines along with robust anti-viral response. The replicating virus within the infected host neurons alters normal gene expression profiles, which can be of significance in JEV pathogenesis at the molecular level.\n\nA neurovirulent JEV strain, JE S982, was employed throughout this study. The propagation of virus was carried out in C6/36 cells utilizing RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To determine virus titers, culture media were harvested for plaque-forming assays using Porcine stable Kidney cells. The mouse neuroblastoma, N2A cell line was maintained in antibiotic-free minimum essential medium (MEM) with Earle's salts supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum.\n\nFor viral infection, monolayers of the mouse neuroblastoma cells grown in 6-or 12-well plates were exposed to either live JE Virus (multiplicity of infection MOI = 5) or mock-infected for 1 h, at 37 \u2022 C. The unbound virus was removed from cells by gentle washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then the cells were cultured in medium at 37 \u2022 C. The quantification of the viral load in harvested infected culture fluid was determined by one-step single tube SYBR Green I mediated JEV Env gene-specific real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP (Santhosh et al., 2007; Parida et al., 2006b) . Total RNA was extracted from uninfected or JEV-infected cells at 36 h post-infection using the Qiagen (Valencia, CA) RNAEasy Mini kit. RNA quality and integrity was assessed using RNA 6000 Nano Lab Chip on the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). Agilent mouse whole genome array (4\u00d7 44k; G 4122F) was used and processed for labeling and hybridization as per manufacturer's protocol.\n\nHybridized arrays were scanned at 5 m resolution on an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner, Model G2565BA. Data extraction from images was done using Feature Extraction software of Agilent. The microarray experiment was repeated once. Feature extracted data was analyzed using GeneSpring Gx v7.3.1 software from Agilent. Normalization of the data was done using per spot per chip intensity dependent lowess normalization. Further quality control of normalized data was done using correlation based condition tree to eliminate experimental error. One folds and above differentially regulated genes was filtered from the data. Differentially regulated genes were clustered using gene tree to identify significant gene expression patterns. Ontology based biological analysis was done using Gene Ontology browser in GeneSpring Gx.\n\nGenes with significant transcriptional changes known to be associated with biological significance were selected for further analysis. RT 2 Profiler PCR Array of Mouse Inflammatory Cytokines and Receptors (PAMM-011A Superarray Bioscience Corporation, USA) was used for qRT-PCR studies. The housekeeping genes were used for standardization of the initial RNA content of a sample. The result for an individual sample was expressed as the mean expression level of a specific gene. The relative expression between each infected sample and the uninfected control was then calculated and expressed as fold change. The real-time RT-PCR was carried out for the time point analysis of chemokines using gene-specific primers for CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 using Quanti Tect primer assay kit (Qiagen, Germany) and Quanti Fast one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Germany) to validate the secretion of chemokines by neurons itself as preliminary antiviral response. Reactions were run on Stratagene Mx 3005p system. The threshold cycle (C t ) of gene of interest and housekeeping gene (HK) and the difference between their C t values (C t ) were deter-mined. Relative changes of gene expression were calculated by the following formula (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) , and the data are represented as fold upregulation/downregulation.fold change = 2 \u2212 C t ,where C t = (C t of gene of interest, treated -C t of HK gene, treated) \u2212 (C t of gene of interest, control \u2212 Ct of HK gene, control), C t is the threshold cycle number and HK is the house keeping gene.\n\nThe time point for microarray and PCR array study consisted of only 36 hpi of mock-infected (control) and JE virus-infected samples. For microarray and PCR array, two replicates each (control and infected) were used and the experiment is repeated once. The data of Tables 1-4 were analyzed by t-test and p-value of \u22640.05 was considered significant. Data of time course study on chemokine synthesis was analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed Dunnet's test for comparison between control and treatment groups. The level of significance was set at p \u2264 0.05. All experiments were repeated at least thrice. Viral replication in N2A cells infected with JE virus JaOAr S982 for 96 h duration was determined by plaque assay of the virus released in the cell culture medium (Fig. 1) . The results showed that new extracellular viral progeny reached maximum at 72 h. After 72 h, a degree of cell death becomes apparent and the experiment was terminated at 96 h (Fig. 2) . Transcript analysis on 36 h post-infection was thus selected to track early changes in gene expression in JE virus-infected cells. A total of 497 genes were found to be significantly upregulated after JEV infection and 223 genes were downregulated (Tables 1 and 2) . Some of the pathways which show upregulated gene expression are toll-like receptor signaling, MAPK, JAK-STAT, SNARE reactions in vesicular transport, antigen processing and presentation (Table 3) . Some of the significantly downregulated pathways are biosynthesis of steroids, androgen and estrogen metabolism, ECM interaction, focal adhesion, etc. (Table 4 ). Other downregulated genes are making clusters in CNS signature like neuron maturation, nerve ensheathment, neurophysiological process, transmission of nerve impulse, ionic insulation of neurons, myelination, transport, localization and neuron projection (data not shown). Other differentially regulated genes that were significantly changed include those associated with cell signaling, lipid metabolism, cell cycle and vesicular transport.\n\nIn order to verify the reproducibility of the microarray results, the real-time PCR plate assay of mouse inflammatory cytokines and cytokine receptors was carried out. The results showed a set of six genes viz. Itgb, CD40, Tollip, Xcr1, CXCL1 and CXCL10 well corroborated with microarray data. GAPDH, \u2424 actin, Gusb, Hsp90 ab1 and Hprt1 were used as housekeeping genes. Out of those six genes, five genes showed congruent and significant differences in expression, while one displayed opposite expression pattern (Table 5) . Upregulated genes include CXCL1 (chemokine, C-X-C motif, ligand 1), CXCL10 (chemokine, C-X-C motif, ligand 10), Itgb (integrin beta), and CD 40 (CD40 ligand). downregulated genes include Xcr1 (chemokine, C motif receptor 1). However, the qRT-PCR showed greater dynamism in fold changes than the microarray results because of the greater sensitivity of PCR compared with fluorescent detection in microarray experiment.\n\nWe found marked increase in expression of IP-10/CXCL10, which is known to play important role in the host defense against viral infection . CXCL10 is found to be a crucial molecule governing the protective response against various diseases like dengue, Trypanosoma cruzi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, rabies virus and corona virus infection of the CNS by enhancing innate immune responses Hardison et al., 2006) . IP-10 is an essential component in host defense by coordinating the trafficking of Th1 T lymphocytes into the CNS in response to viral infection. We demonstrated the strong induction of CXCL10 by infected neurons itself. The qRT-PCR analysis showed sustained induction of CXCL10 in JEV-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells.\n\nThe results indicate that neurons may be a source of chemokine synthesis for primary anti-viral response in JE infection (Fig. 3B ). There is gradual decrease in CXCL10 expression with increased viral load in cells, suggesting its anti-viral role in JE infection. No significant fold change was detected for other chemoattractant like CXCL11 and CXCL9 (Fig. 3A-C) .\n\nArray data also showed Ccl-5 upregulation in JE infection indicating virus modulation of the host machinery in the initial stages of infection. Ccl5-Ccr5 interaction provides anti-apoptotic signals for macrophage survival during viral infection. Ccl5-responsive genes comprise a significant number of enzymes, transcription factors, and miscellaneous molecules involved in neuronal survival and differentiation, including neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis (Valerio et al., 2004) . There was significant upregulation of a number of ubiquitin-proteasome system related genes such as Usp18 during JE virus replication but it was unclear if this response was anti-viral or if the JE virus utilized components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system for its replication. We found significant upregulation in anti-viral response genes like IFN induced Isg15, Viperin, Mx 2, anti-viral genes like oligoadenylate synthetase, Parp14, Irgm, transcription factor-like STAT and ER stress regulated genes like Herpud1, ATF6 and XBP1. The marked elevation in expression of these genes at 36 h post-infection suggests a highly notable anti-viral response to JEV pathogenesis. Downregulated genes were mainly from focal adhesion and CNS signature, as detailed and vast study is required to elaborate the importance and involvement of these significantly downregulated genes in JEV pathogenesis. Genes like Lypd3, Lgi4 are involved in protein binding, neuron maturation, myelination, etc. The realtime RT-PCR validated genes elucidate the varied transcriptional responses of JE virus-infected neuroblastoma cells. Together with other identified differentially expressed genes, these transcripts provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of JEV at a transcriptomic level, particularly the molecular events that underpin host defense mechanism against JEV infection.\n\nThe results of the present study with mouse neuronal cells clearly show that many genes and host response pathways were upregulated during JE infection. Specific components of the response to virus such as Viperin, G1p2, Ifit3, Atf3, Irgm and CXCL10 have been implicated in JE infection for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Future research is required to explore the mechanism of JEV modulation of these genes to evade the host defense response. Our study offers an overview of the cascade of changes in host cellular expression culminating from infection with JEV. The counterbalancing of several anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory pathways together with the variable expression of apoptosis-related genes is a significant finding of the present study. The involvement of these genes indicated modulation of ini- Chemokine (C motif) receptor 1 Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction \u22120.3 \u22120.5 Cxcl1\n\nChemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction +3.1 +6.68 Cxcl10\n\nChemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 Toll-Like receptor signaling +7.7 +35.7 tial host cell response and balance between cell proliferation and cell death there by enabling virus multiplication. The emerging picture from this study implicates a central role for the immune response in the pathobiology of JE infection. It will be interesting to compare the host response to different JEV isolates with inactivated preparations of the virus. The present study implies that neurons play an important role in their own defense against viral infections. Although this challenges the long-held belief that neurons are immunologically quiescent, an improved understanding of the proinflammatory effects responsible for immune-mediated control of viral infection and neuronal injury during JEV infection is an essential step for developing strategies for limiting the severity of CNS disease."}
