{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Inside China and COVID-19: Questions and answers", "body": "In the early stages of the outbreak, with rapid SARS-CoV-2 spread, many questions remained unanswered, including the source of the pathogen, mode of transmission, infectiousness and clinical characteristics. There were initial suggestions that the overall case fatality rate might not be that different to seasonal influenza, with analogies drawn to the 60,000 annual influenza deaths in the US. As the scale of the outbreak became apparent and additional data became available, a higher CFR became apparent, with a figure of 2.1% according to the data released on February 6, 2020) 1 , but this figure will be subject to revision as additional data emerges. Based upon my experience the CFR might be varied from region to region, due to the availability of SARS-CoV-2, medical care and practice, and the accuracy of number of infected patients. A particular issue, making direct comparisons with influenza mortality difficult in today's world, is the ready availability of anti-influenza antivirals and vaccines, and the absence of any proven efficacious antiviral and vaccine for the treatment of COVID-19. Although Chinese researchers identified a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 associated with the Wuhan pneumonia in less than ten days after the outbreak, efforts to prevent the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 were not successful. Based on the current epidemiological data and clinical characteristics, the author believes that there are several contributing factors, as described below.\n\n1. The origin of the epidemic remains unknown. The retrospective epidemiology study of 423 cases performed by China CDC showed there may be multiple sources of infection in addition to the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan from the very beginning of epidemic. 7 The significance of epidemiology of family clustering cases was also underestimated. 8 2. The number of early cases is too small to fully understand the clinical features and severity of the disease. The earliest report of 41 confirmed cases with an alarming mortality rate, raised the question of whether this novel coronavirus could be treated as a common coronavirus. 9 Although coronavirus is an important cause of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and of pneumonia, its incidence is lower than that of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus, at least in temperate climates. 10 Of the six coronaviruses that have previously been identified as capable of causing human disease, SARS and MERS coronaviruses have been of the greatest concern, as human coronaviruses generally account for merely 5% -10% of all acute upper respiratory tract infections in adults, albeit reaching 25% -35% during outbreaks. 10-14 Human coronaviruses can cause severe pneumonia in the immunocompromised such as HIV-positive individuals, or in other vulnerable populations: in an outbreak of HCoV-OC43 infection in elderly people living in a Canadian long-term care facility the case fatality rate was 8% , the mortality is nevertheless far inferior to that of SARS and MERS, and may therefore be overlooked by the medical community. 15 3. Clinical symptoms observed with this novel coronavirus infection can be relatively atypical, e.g. some patients had diarrhea, and progress of the disease is relatively slow.\n\nPatients who develop severe disease usually experience deterioration such as dyspnea and hypoxemia in the first week after disease onset. Thus, many patients visited the doctor for the first time, or were hospitalized, a week after onset of their disease. The virus thus enjoyed an opportunity to spread for a relatively long period before patients were isolated or hospitalized. Only with all of these efforts coordinated can transmission of virus be cut within the family, the risk of nosocomial infections minimized, and the epidemic finally controlled.\n\nFunding: None.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards and Conflict of interest: The author has no financial or non-financial conflict of interest relevant to this paper to disclose.\n\nEthical approval: Not required for this commentary.\n\n."}
