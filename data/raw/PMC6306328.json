{"title": "An Atypical Case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in a Returning Traveler to Korea from Kuwait, 2018", "body": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a respiratory illness caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia1 and in Jordan.2 Since then, 27 countries have reported 2,254 cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS, and as of October 12, 2018, 800 MERS-CoV-related deaths (case-fatality rate, 35%) have been reported to the World Health Organization.3\n\nThe Korean outbreak of MERS-CoV occurred in May, June, and July of 2015. There were 186 cases including 38 deaths, which is the largest outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula.4 Subsequently, there were no additional MERS cases in Korea until August 2018. Here, we report the first imported case of MERS-CoV infection in Korea since the end of the large outbreak in 2015.\n\nThe protocol of the present study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB No. 1809-072-973). The patient provided written informed consent.\n\nHere we describe the first imported case of MERS-CoV infection after a large outbreak in Korea in 2015. Although 21 close contacts were identified by an epidemiological investigation, no additional cases of MERS-CoV infection were found.5\n\nAs the index case of the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea, this patient also did not have any risk of acquiring MERS-CoV infection. He did not visit a camel farm, did not consume camel milk or camel products. As he visited a local health clinic in Kuwait two times (days 7 and 9 of his illness), a possible hypothesis is he contracted MERS-CoV at the clinic. However, he already had mild leukopenia and thrombocytopenia on day 7, and extensive bilateral lung infiltrates on day 10. Considering the shortest incubation period of 2 days, we can safely say that he had already been infected with MERS-CoV when he visited the clinic, and diarrhea was a presenting symptom of MERS in this patient. It is important to note that of the Saudi patients who were infected with MERS-CoV in the community, less than half had history of exposure to camel.6 Therefore, we should remind that one can be infected with MERS-CoV in the Middle East even if he or she does not have a history of exposure to camels or camel products. A phylogenetic study of MERS-CoV from this patient may shed light on the origin of the infecting virus.\n\nIn the current patient, the presenting symptom was diarrhea. Although MERS-CoV is considered a respiratory virus and respiratory manifestations are the major clinical feature of MERS, gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in up to 30% of patients with MERS-CoV infection.1 During the 2015 Korea outbreak, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain was reported in 14%, 19%, and 8% of the patients, respectively,7 and diarrhea developed from day 1 of illness.8 The pathophysiology of gastrointestinal manifestations in MERS-CoV infection is not well understood. In a cell culture study, cytopathic effect was observed as early as one day after MERS-CoV inoculation in CaCo-2 cells, a colorectal cancer cell line,9 suggesting the virus can replicate in the gastrointestinal epithelial cells. MERS-CoV RNA was also detected in 14.6% (12/82) of stool samples from patients, with maximum concentration of 1.26 \u00d7 105 copies per milliliter,10 and as late as 15 days after symptom onset.11 A recent study using an ex vivo human intestine model demonstrated that MERS-CoV replicated better in intestinal epithelium than in respiratory epithelium,12 suggesting the gastrointestinal track as an alternative route of infection. In our patient, however, we were not able to detect MERS-CoV RNA in his stool samples.\n\nAnother interesting clinical feature in the patient is he showed few respiratory symptoms, although his chest radiography showed multiple patchy infiltrates in both lungs. Indeed, the computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 5 cm-sized consolidation in the left lung, with numerous small infiltrates located in the subpleural spaces. We speculated that the large consolidation was a MERS-CoV pneumonia and the numerous subpleural infiltrates were due to virus-triggered organizing pneumonia.13,14 As the infiltrates were localized mainly in the periphery of the lungs, and probably in the interstitial space rather than in the airspace, we also speculated that symptoms due to airway inflammation, such as cough and sputum production, were not prominent. A recent case report also highlighted that respiratory symptoms did not develop, although chest CT scan showed multiple patch infiltrates in both lungs.15 Therefore, chest radiography should be taken in every patient who is suspected of MERS-CoV infection, even if respiratory symptoms are mild or absent.\n\nAs the patient presented with diarrhea and he had few respiratory symptoms, he did not meet the case definition of MERS when he arrived at the airport,16 and the quarantine officer did not isolate him. This raised a question whether the case definition should be revised to include diarrhea symptom. The answer depends on whether MERS-CoV is excreted into stool and transmissible to others, however, no fecal transmission has been reported so far. Moreover, as diarrhea is a common and non-specific symptom, many patients with traveler's diarrhea without MERS-CoV infection would undergo unnecessary screening tests. Therefore, inclusion of diarrhea symptom in the case definition for MERS-CoV surveillance requires more data and ensuring evidence.\n\nTo summarize, here we report a patient with a confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection who presented with diarrhea and fever. The present record highlights early detection of a MERS-CoV case is challenging, because 1) exposure history is often absent, 2) presenting symptoms are not specific to MERS, 3) pneumonia can be missed without chest radiography. The present case underscores the importance of having a high index of suspicion of MERS-CoV infection when a febrile patient presents after a recent visit to the Middle East."}
