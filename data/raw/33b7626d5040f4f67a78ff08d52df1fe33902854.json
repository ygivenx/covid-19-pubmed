{"title": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)", "body": "A novel coronavirus has been isolated from the respiratory secretions of a patient with SARS and subsequently this virus or a serologic response to this virus has been demonstrated in other patients. This points to a possible etiologic association between this novel coronavirus and SARS. [2] [3] [4] Coronaviruses, RNA viruses of which 3 groups are known, are associated with a variety of diseases in humans and domestic animals including gastroenteritis and upper and lower respiratory tract disease. However, the known human coronavirus is associated with mild disease (the common cold). The ability of coronavirus to cause severe disease in animals raises the possibility that Reprint requests : Dr. S.K.'Kabra, Deptt. of Pediatrics, AIIMS, New Delhi-110029. E-mail : skkabra@hotmail.com coronavirus could also cause a more severe disease in humans.\n\nThe coronavirus implicated in SARS (SARS associated coronavirus) has got only 50-60% homology in nucleotide component to the known human coronaviruses. 2 As expected with a point source epidemic, several nucleotide sequences of the viruses isolated from patients from different regions are identical. ~3 The apparent lack of antibody in all serum specimens except for those from patients with SAILS suggests that this virus has not circulated previously. Presumably, this virus originated in animals and mutated or recombined in a fashion that permitted it to infect, cause disease and pass on from person to person. 2 The name suggested for this new coronavirus is urbani SARS associated coronavirus in memory of Dr Carlo Urbani, the 40 year old WHO physician and infectious disease specialist whose work defined SARS, who died on March 29 of SARS. 2 Metapneumovirus was isolated in 5 patients in one study, s but further studies did not reveal the same.\n\nThe infection appears to be highly but not uniformly contagious. Secondary attack rates are about 50~ ~7 In one study on children, it was suggested that infected children did not spread the infection to other children in their class in school. 8 The following may be modes of transmission: Droplet spread, Close contact, Fomites; shedding of virus in feces may be an additional source of spread. Viral RNA concentrations in sputum were noticed to be high, suggesting that the shedding of virus from respiratory tract is the primary mode of transmission 2. SARS also appears to spread by direct contact with respiratory secretions, which makes touching contaminated objects a potential concern. Coronavirus is light sensitive but can survive in body secretions for few hours.\n\nThe incubation period for SARS has been observed to be 2-11 days, with a median of 6 days. s7 The clinical and laboratory features reported in various series are given in Table 1 . SARS clinically presents with high-grade fever, chills and rigors, myalgia, headache, cough with or without sputum production, dyspnea, and dizziness. It is less commonly associated with sore throat, coryza, nausea and vomiting and diarrhea. Rash, purpura and lymphadenopathy are not features of SARSY Physical examination may reveal increased respiratory rate, dull percussion note in chest and inspiratory crackles in lower chest.\n\nOn investigation, some patients were found to have low arterial oxygen saturation. Chest radiographs have revealed unilateral or bilateral, predominantly peripheral, areas of consolidation progressing within a short time to bilateral patchy consolidation. ~ Characteristic chest CT findings observed include bilateral air space ground glass consolidation mimicking that seen in bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia. 5, 6 Laboratory data has revealed leucopenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, deranged APTT, abnormal Ddimer assayY Serum AST, ALT, LDH and CK levels were found to be raised. Electrolyte abnormalities in the form of hypenatremia and hypokalemia have been observed in a few patientsY A recent study on 75 adults with SARS has observed that the fever and pneumonia initially responded to treatment) However, patients developed recurrent fever (85.3%) on day 8.9 _+ 3.1 (range 4 to 18), watery diarrhea (73.3%) on day 7.5 _+ 2.3 (range 3 to 15), radiological deterioration (80%) on day 7.4 _+ 2.2 (range 3 to 13) and respiratory deterioration (45.3%) on day 8.6 + 3 (range 5 to 19). In 45.3% of patients, marked improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was closely associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites. Twenty percent progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during the third week. Quantitative RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (4 had ARDS and 10 without ARDS) consistently demonstrated a peak viral load at day 10 and a decrease to admission level at day 15. This suggests that deterioration during the second week was not related to uncontrolled viral replication but may rather be related to immunopathological damage. ~ Data on children is limited. Hon et al have described the clinical features in 10 children from Hong Kong. 8 Two distinct patterns of clinical presentation among the children were observed. Teenaged patients presented with symptoms of malaise, myalgia, chill, and rigor similar to those of adults, whereas the younger children presented mainly with cough and runny nose, and none had chills, rigors, or myalgia. The clinical course was much milder and shorter among younger patients, and radiological changes were milder and generally resolved more quickly than in the teenagers. All pediatric patients had clinically important lymphopenia, but it was more severe among the teenage children.\n\nPostmortem examination in a few cases has shown gross consolidation of lungs. The early phase and organ)zing phase of diffuse alveolar damage were seen in different parts of lung. The early phase was characterized by pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation suggestive of early phase of ARDS. Cellular fibromyxoid organizing exudates in air spaces indicated the ongoing phase of alveolar damage. It was also noticed that there was a scanty lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate in the interstitium; vacuolated and multinucleated pneumoeTtes were also identified, no viral inclusions were detected. There was no evidence of involvement of other organs.\n\nDiagnosis is mainly based on clinical features and exclusion of other known causes of acute lower respiratory tract infection (community acquired pneumonia, atypical pneumonia and other viral pneumonia).\n\nNew case definitions that include laboratory test criteria are under final review and productions of test reagents for widespread distribution are well underway.\n\nThe symptoms and laboratory finding in SARS are non specific and constellation of various clinical and biochemical parameters should alert the medical pracatitioners to the possibility of SARS.\n\nThe case definition of SARS is as follows l~ :\n\nRespiratory illness of unknown etiology with onset of since February 1, 2003, and the following criteria: 1. Measured temperature greater than 100.4 o F (>38 ~ and 2. One or more clinical findings of respiratory illness (e.g. shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or hypoxia), and 3. Travel within 10 days of onset of symptoms to an area with documented or suspected community transmission of SARS (excludes areas with secondary cases limited to health case workers or direct household contacts).\n\n4. Close contact within 10 days of onset of symptoms with a person known to be a suspect SARS.\n\nA suspect case with one of the following: 1. Presence of radiographic evidence of pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome. 2. Presence of autopsy finding consistent with respiratory distress syndrome without an identifiable cause. One should try to exclude common causes of atypical pneumonia.\n\nNumerous antibiotics (clarithromycin, third generation cephalosporins, levofloxacin) and anti-influenza therapies have been tried with no clear effect. Physicians in SARS affected areas have used ribavarin with or without use of steroids in an increasing number of patients. 6\"8'9 But, in the absence of clinical indicators, its effectiveness has not been proven. Supportive care is particularly important.\n\nOverall case fatality is about 4%. Lee et a/6 observed tilat in a multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of an adverse outcome were advanced age (odds ratio per decade of life, 1.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.16 to 2.81; P=0.009), a high peak lactate dehydrogenase level (odds ratio per 100 U per liter, 2.09; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.28 to 3.42; P=0.003), and.an absolute neutrophil count that exceeded the upper limit of the normal range on presentation (odds ratio, 1.60; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.50; P=0.04). 6 According to ~ study 32.2 % required ICU admission and 13.8% required mechanical ventilatory support. Mortality rate was nearly 5%.\n\nOne report on ten children observed that four teenagers required oxygen therapy and two needed assisted ventilation; none died. 8 None of the younger children required oxygen supplementation. This suggests that the disease is milder in children.\n\nThe WHO has recommended that the following criteria be considered prior to making a decision regarding discharge from hospital regarding a convalescent case:\n\nClinical symptoms~findings 9 Afebrile for 48 hours 9 Resolving cough Laboratory tests: if previously abnormal 9 White cell count returning to normal 9 Platelet count returning to normal 9 Creatine phosphokinase returning to normal 9 Liver function tests returning to normal 9 Plasma sodium returning to normal 9 C reactive protein returning to normal For home or residential setting : Placing a surgical mask on suspect SARS patient during contact with others at home is recommended. If the patient is unable to wear a surgical mask, it may be prudent for household members to wear surgical masks when in close contact with the patient, should be reminded of the need for careful hand hygiene including hand washing with soap and water; if hands are not visibly soiled, alcohol-based handrubs may be used as an alternative to hand washing."}
