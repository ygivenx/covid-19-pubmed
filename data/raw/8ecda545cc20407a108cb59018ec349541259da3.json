{"title": "Clinical and Paraclinical Characteristics of COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis", "body": "Coronavirus is a type of enveloped RNA virus with size of 60 to 140 nanometers in diameter. They have spike-like projections with a crown-like appearance under the electron microscope (1) . This family of viruses, which can be divided into four type of alpha, beta, delta, and gamma, can infect multiple types of different species. For instance, they have been isolated from humans (alpha and beta), bats, Canidae, and Felidae (2, 3) . Although the coronavirus family is mainly responsible for human mild respiratory diseases such as common cold, in some cases, they can cause serious illnesses (3) . Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are among epidemic diseases caused by coronaviruses in recent decades (4) .\n\nRecently, a novel strain of coronaviruses, which originated from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, has been identified (1) . This strain (SARS-CoV-2) has been discovered in 2019 and characterized as a pandemic disease in March 2020 (5) . According to World Health Organization (WHO), up to 17 March 2020, over 188,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported throughout the world with the mortality rate of 3.4 % (6).\n\nIn a study, Sun et al. assessed the incidence of fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and ARDS in patients with CoVID-19 (7) . Given the increasing prevalence of the disease, further investigation of the clinical and paraclinical features of this disease seems necessary. In this regard, we conducted this systematic and meta-analysis review. In this study, we investigated the risk of incidence of different type of clinical finding and comorbidities in severe and non-severe patients.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Fever, cough, and sour throat are among the most common symptoms of the patients, which were reported respectively in 22, 20, and 7 studies. Meta-analysis findings are as follows respectively: 84% (95% CI, 79-88), 65% (95% CI, 59-71), and 14% (95% CI 8-19) ( Fig. 4 5 and Supplementary File). Anorexia, Chills, Shortness of breath, dyspnea, chest pain, confusion, and nausea/vomiting were reported in respectively 5, 5, 6, 5, 7, 2, and 9 studies. Overall prevalence of these symptoms was 24% (95% CI, 13-34), 19% (95% CI, 11-27), 27% (95% CI, 12-42), 31% (95% CI, 14-48), 6% (95% CI, 2-9), 1% (95% CI, 0-2) and 6% (95% CI, 3-8) (Supplementary File and Table 2 ).\n\nIn addition, sneezing, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, hemoptysis, and expectoration were reported in 3, 4, 7, 3, and 4 studies, respectively. Pooling results were 26% (95% CI, 14-39), 24% (95% CI, 1-48), 4% (95% CI 1-6), 2% (95% CI, 0-3), and 39% (95% CI, 27-51) (Supplementary File and Table 2 ).\n\nAbdominal pain, pharyngula, dizziness, and sputum production have been reported in 2, 5, 4, 8 studies, respectively. Meta-analysis findings were 4% (95%CI 2 -5), 12% (95%CI 5 -19), 8% (95%CI 6 -10), and 27% (95%CI 20 -35) (Supplementary File and Table 2 ).\n\nAll rights reserved.

Most common observing in these patients were leukocytopenia (26%, 95%CI 17 -35), neutrophilia (25%, 95%CI 11 -39), thrombocytopenia (36%, 95%CI 30-42) and lymphocytopenia (34%, 95%CI 12 -57) by following thrombocytosis (4%, 95%CI 1 -8), increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (56%, 95%CI 21 -92), procalcitonin (5%, 95%CI 1 -8), IL-6 (42%, 95%CI 34 -50), D-dimer (14%, 95%CI 0 -28), and Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (54%, 95%CI 28 -79) ( Fig. 7 and 8 ).\n\nRegarding radiological findings, 84% (95%CI 79 -88) of patients who underwent a Computed tomography (CT) scan were positive for pneumonia. The most common radiological findings in these patients were Ground-glass opacity (50%, 95%CI 29 -70), consolidation (27%, 95%CI 10 -44), unilateral pneumonia (24%, 95%CI 3 -44), and bilateral pneumonia (61%, 95%CI 30 -91) (Supplementary File and Table 2 ).\n\nDifferent studies investigated the underlying diseases in patients with COVID-19. The cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cerebrovascular disease were reported in 12, 11, and 4 original studies, respectively. In this regard, pooling of the results was 10% (95%CI 7 -114), 10% (95%CI 7 -14), and 2% (95%CI 1 -3), respectively. Also, other underlying diseases like hypertension and chronic kidney disease were investigated in 11 and 7 studies. The general outbreak of these disorders was 18% (95%CI 13 -23) and 1% (95%CI 1 -2) respectively (Supplementary File and Table 2 ). All rights reserved.

Meta-analysis showed the prevalence of 21% (95%CI 6 -35) and 2% (95%CI -1-5) respectively (Supplementary File and Table 2 ).\n\nIn this systematic review for detecting the source of heterogeneity, we analyzed the subgroups based on the severity of the disease. The results are as follows:\n\nThe prevalence of the symptoms such as sore throat, sputum production, headache, and fatigue in stable patients did not need to be admitted into intensive care unit (ICU) were 14%, 33%, 14%, 44%, respectively. However, these statistics for patients with severe symptoms were 14%, 41%, 12%, 53%. Other symptoms like diarrhea, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, and dyspnea in mild patients showed the prevalence of 9%, 17%, 6%, and 24%, which were 8%, 30%, 9%, and 59%, respectively in severe cases (Supplementary File and Table 2 ).\n\nThe prevalence of symptoms like abdominal pain, pharyngalgia, hemoptysis, expectoration, and fever in mild cases were 6%, 8%, 1%, 36%, 90%. The same symptoms for the severe cases were 7%, 14%, 3%, 39%, 94% respectively. Furthermore, the prevalence of the symptoms of myalgia, cough, dizziness, chills, and shortness of breath were 27%, 68%, 5%, 11%, and 19% whereas in All rights reserved.

However, in critically severe patients were 15%, 17%, 10%, and 31%. The prevalence of other underlying diseases like chronic liver disease and respiratory diseases were 2% and 1% whereas in severe cases, respiratory diseases prevalence is 6% (Supplementary File and Table 2 ).\n\nThe prevalence of malignancies (2%) and chronic kidney disease (1%) mostly reported in mild patients whereas in severe cases, were 2% and 24%, respectively (Supplementary File and Table   2 ).\n\nDue to the novelty of Coronavirus 2019, there is no clear picture of the clinical and paraclinical features of the disease. Moreover, the reported frequencies of these features are variable. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis study was performed to evaluate the clinical and paraclinical features of the disease. In this systematic review, 20 studies including 48967 cases of COVID-19 have been studied. All the studies were conducted in China, with one exception which studies some case in South Korea along with Chinese cases.\n\nIt was difficult to diagnose this disease at the time of onset, as the general symptoms of the disease can also be seen in other respiratory diseases. A wide range of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings have been observed in relation to this disease. Symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, All rights reserved.

As mentioned, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea are less common and symptoms such as fever and cough are more common in viral infections such as seasonal influenza, SARS and MERS. (8, 9) . Many patients with coronavirus may be unrecognized and present in the community because, according to the results of this study, none of the clinical symptoms were definitively present in all patients. Therefore, definitive diagnosis of patients is difficult and one should expect hidden and vector-borne patients in the community. In the meta-analysis of Sun et al. which conducted on the symptoms of COVID-19 patients, the results have shown that fever, cough, and fatigue are among the most common symptoms (7).\n\nThe rate of death and the outcome of patients after hospitalization have been investigated in this meta-analysis. The results have shown more than two-thirds of the patients (69%) who referred to the hospitals get hospitalized, and about 26% will be released after outpatient treatment. Around 3% of the patients, however, will expire. It should be noted that the real mortality rate would be higher than this statistics. In the study of Baud et al. It has been shown that the mortality of this disease is higher than that typically obtained by dividing the death rate by the total number of patients. Because at the time of infection the number of persons is much lower than the number entered into the denominator (10). Based on the present meta-analysis findings in 84% of suspected cases, CT-Scan findings were positive, indicating that a high proportion of patients can be identified by relying on CT-Scan.\n\nOn the other hand, 84% of suspected cases had high fever and cough was seen in many patients.\n\nChanges in laboratory findings are less common than radiological and clinical findings and appear to be less reliable.

Also, underlying diseases were more common in these patients.\n\nThe limitations of this study include:\n\n1. All of the studies have been conducted in China 2. High methodological heterogeneity in the included studies 3. Due to the lack of information by sex and age, it was not possible to calculate the mortality and morbidity of patients in these subgroups.\n\nGiven the high proportion that may occur without CT-Scan findings or clinical symptoms, it is advisable to use several combination methods to better diagnose the disease, to minimize undiagnosed patients. Moreover, while there is no access to clinical and paraclinical facilities in in public places such as airports and border crossings, it is recommended to consider factors such as fever, cough, sputum and fatigue. Since the prevalence of underlying diseases is higher in patients with more severe conditions, the risk of serious illness in those with underlying diseases should be considered.\n\n13 All rights reserved.
