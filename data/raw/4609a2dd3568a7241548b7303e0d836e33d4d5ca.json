{"title": "Reduction and Functional Exhaustion of T Cells in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)", "body": "In December 2019, a series of acute respiratory illness were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 1,2 A novel coronavirus, initially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of this disease by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 3 This disease, now designated as coronavirus disease 2019 by the WHO, rapidly spread to other cities of China, and has become a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) following its global spread. COVID-19 is clinically manifests as fever, cough, muscle pain, fatigue, diarrhea and pneumonia, and can cause death in severe cases. [4] [5] [6] Up through February 18, 2020, China has reported 72436 cases of confirmed COVID-19 and 1868 fatalities. 7\n\nSince an effective immune response against viral infections depends on the activation of cytotoxic T cells that can clear infection by killing virus-infected cells, 8 boosting the numbers and function of T cells in COVID-19 patients is critical for successful recovery. A recent study reported that the 82.1% of COVID-19 cases displayed low circulating lymphocyte counts. [4] [5] [6] However, the factors which might cause the reduction in count, and the activation status of T cells in COVID-19 patients, remain uninvestigated. We retrospectively analyze here the clinical data from 522 cases of COVID-19 who were admitted into the General Hospital of Central Theatre Command and Hanyang Hospital in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020. We also compared the expression of exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 on the surface of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from COVID-19 and healthy controls. Our results thus provide a preliminary demonstration of T cell exhaustion during COVID-19 infection and suggest that more aggressive early intervention may be required in patients with low T lymphocyte counts.\n\nPatients Medical records from 522 patients (aged from 5 days to 97 years) with confirmed COVID-19 and admitted into the General Hospital of Central Theatre Command or Hanyang Hospital in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020, and 40 healthy people (aged from 2 to 62 years), who came to the hospitals for routine physical examination, were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (5th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China. 9 All the patients were laboratory-confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 by use of quantitative 9 Within the cohort analyzed 43 were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), because they required high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support measures to correct hypoxaemia. Hypoxaemia was defined as arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) over inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO2) of less than 300 mm Hg or arterial oxygen saturation of 93% or lower. According to the staging of infectious disease, 10 the prodromal period is a phase in which the host begins to experience general signs and symptoms. The illness period (overtly symptomatic period) is a phase in which the signs or symptoms of disease are most obvious and severe, with positive laboratory findings and chest images. For ICU patients, ICU period is a phase in which the symptoms are most obvious and severe The decline period is a phase in which the clinical symptoms begin to decline, laboratory findings and chest images improve, and arterial oxygen saturation to return to the normal.\n\nWe reviewed clinical records, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays or CT scans for all the patients and physical examination records of the 40 healthy people. All information was obtained and curated with a customised data collection form. Three investigators (C Wang, Z Fen and Y Chen) independently reviewed the data collection forms to verify data accuracy.

After being stained, the cells were measured by flow cytometry on an LSR Fortessa Cell Analyzer (BD Biosciences) and data analyzed using the FolwJo software (TreeStar). All experimental procedures were completed under biosafety level II plus condition.\n\nStatistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

The final version was approved by all authors.\n\nFrom our retrospective analysis of 522 patients, 499 cases had lymphocyte count recorded. 75.75%\n\n(359/499), 75.95% (379/499) and 71.54% (357/499) patients had remarkably low total T cell counts, CD4 + and CD8 + T cell counts, respectively. Among milder patients in the Non-ICU group, the median value of total T cells, CD4 + and CD8 + T cell counts are 652, 342 and 208, respectively, the median value decreased to 261, 198 and 64.3, respectively, in the ICU group. (Figure 1A) . The counts of total T cells, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were significantly lower in ICU patients than Non-ICU cases ( Figure 1B) . These patients were further categorized into three groups based on age (<20 years old, 20\uff5e60 years and \u226560 years), and an age-dependent reduction of T cell numbers was observed in COVID-19 patients, with the lowest T cells numbers found in patients \u226560 years old (Figure 1C) , suggesting a potential cause for increased susceptibility in elderly patients.\n\nWe next retrospectively reviewed T cell numbers in 212 cases from Non-ICU patients within one center (the General Hospital of Central Theatre Command). The Non-ICU patients were further divided into four groups based on clinical outcomes. Among these patients, 151 cases are mild/moderate, 40 cases are severe, while 13 cases in critical condition, and 8 perished occurred.\n\nStatistical analysis showed that T cell numbers including total T cells, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in .

Most importantly, the numbers of total T cell, CD8 + T cells and CD4 + T cells in severe and perished groups are lower than 800/\u03bcL, 300/\u03bcL, or 400/\u03bcL, respectively ( Figure 1D ). This result suggests that aggressive interventions may be required for non-ICU patients even in the absence of more severe symptoms should their T cell counts fall below the critical threshold.\n\nThe expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2), the predicted receptor of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, is absent on T cells, 11 suggesting that the depressed T counts in COVID-19 patients mentioned above (Figure 1 ) was likely not caused by direct infection of T cells. We therefore examined the concentrations of serum cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10, from these COVID-19 patients to explore the influence of cytokine signaling. We only found the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly increased in infected patients, and statistical analysis illustrated that their levels in ICU patients are significantly higher than in Non-ICU patients (Figure 2A) .\n\nWe next investigated the relationships between IL-10, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and T cell count within Non-ICU patients. Interestingly, the concentration of these three cytokines was negatively correlated with total T cell counts, CD4 + counts, and CD8 + counts, respectively ( Figure 2B) . We subsequently summarized the follow up data of cytokine concentrations and T cell numbers in ten patients that were follower over the course of inpatient care. Interestingly, serum levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly decreased in these patients in the decline period as compared with illness period, while counts of total T cells, CD4 + , and CD8 + T cell subsets recovered during the decline period ( Figure 2C) . The phenomena suggests that the decrease of T cells seen in COVID-19 patients is likely the result of high serum concentration of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-10 negatively regulating T cell survival or proliferation.\n\nBeyond changing in numbers during the course of infection, T cells may display limited function during prolonged infection as a result of exhaustion, which has been associated with the expression of some immune-inhibitory factors including PD-1, Tim-3 on cell surface. 12 We therefore examined whether T cells in COVID-19 patients have exhaustion phenotypes. FACs analysis illustrated that, T 7 / 14 cells from COVID-19 patients have markedly higher levels of PD-1 compared to healthy controls ( Figure 3A) . Furthermore, statistical analysis showed that the percentage of PD-1 + CD8 + T cells from ICU patients was significantly higher than from both Non-ICU cases and healthy controls ( Figure 3B) , indicating that SARS-CoV-2 viruses induce T cell exhaustion in COVID-19 patients, particularly in those requiring ICU care.\n\nThree patients were follow-up during inpatient care, and the expression of the exhausted markers including PD-1 and Tim-3 on surface of T cells during disease progress was detected. FACs showed that these patients have very low level of PD-1 and Tim-3 on CD8 + and CD4 + T cells in the prodromal stage, however, their levels on CD8 + T cells was increased in overtly symptomatic stages, and highest levels were seen in ICU period (Figure 3C, D) . Similarly, higher levels of Tim-3 was observed on CD4 + T cells from patients who are in ICU stage, although enhancing the expression of PD-1 on CD4 + T cells was not obviously during disease progress (Figure 3C, D) . These results\n\nsecreting an array of molecules such as perforin, granzymes, and IFN-\u03b3 to eradicate viruses from the host. 13 At the same time, CD4 + helper T cells (Th) can assist cytotoxic T cells and B cells and enhance their ability to clear pathogen. 14 However, persistent stimulation by the virus may induce T cell exhaustion, leading to loss of cytokine production capability and reduced functions. 15, 16 Earlier studies have been unclear regarding the numbers and function of T cells in COVID-19 patients, albeit with suggestions of depressed lymphocyte counts. 4, 6 In this report, we retrospectively reviewed the numbers of total T cells, CD4 + , CD8 + T cell subsets in a total of 499 COVID-19 patients. In Non-ICU patients, we found that over 70.56% cases underwent decreased in the total T cells, CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells. However, in the ICU group, a total of 95% (19/20) patients showed a decrease in both total T cells and CD4 + T cells, and most importantly, all of the patients displayed decreases in CD8 + T cells. We also analyzed Non-ICU patients in greater detail, and found that aggressive intervention may be necessary to preempt the development of severe symptoms in patients with low T cell counts.\n\nCytokine storm is a phenomenon of excessive inflammatory reaction in which cytokines are rapidly produced in large amount in response to microbial infection. This phenomenon has been .

[19] [20] [21] [22] showed that the levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1 and MIP-1A were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients. 4 Consistent with this report, we here also found that the secretion of cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-10 was increased in COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, the numbers of total T cells, CD4 + T and CD8 + T cells are negatively correlated to levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-10, respectively (Figure 2B) , suggesting these cytokines promote T cells decrease in COVID-19 patients.\n\nTNF-\u03b1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which can promote T cell apoptosis via interacting with its receptor, TNFR1, which expression is increased in aged T cells. 23, 24 Our current analysis demonstrated that patient over 60 years old have lower T cell numbers, indicating that TNF-\u03b1 might be directly involved in inducing T cell loss in these patients. IL-6, when promptly and transiently produced in response to infections and tissue injuries, contributes to host defense through the stimulation of acute phase responses or immune reactions. Dysregulated and continual synthesis of IL-6 has been shown to play a pathological role in chronic inflammation and infection. 25, 26 Tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, has been developed and approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. 27, 28 Moreover, tocilizumab has been shown to be effective against cytokine release syndrome resulting from CAR-T cell infusion against B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 29 Whether tocilizumab can restore T cell counts in COVID-19 patients by suppressing IL-6 signaling remains uninvestigated.\n\nOne interesting question is the source of these cytokine during COVID-19 infection. While previous studies have validated that the secretion of cytokines including IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 are mainly from T cells, macrophages and monocytes etc, based on our results, we suggest that the secretion of these cytokines does not originate from T cells. However, the cytokine storm in turn may promote apoptosis or necrosis of T cells, and consequently leads to their reduction. Our previous work demonstrating that monocytes and macrophages can produce pro-inflammatory cytokine during murine hepatitis virus strain-3 infection, 30, 31 and whether SARS-CoV-2 also triggers cytokine release from monocytes and macrophages in COVID-19 patients need further investigation and such work is in progress in our hospital.\n\nT cell exhaustion is a state of T cell dysfunction that arises during many chronic infections and cancer. It is defined by poor effector function, sustained expression of inhibitory receptors, and a .

Since these changes could also be observed in our longitudinal follow-up of several patients from prodromal to ICU care (Figure 3) . IL-10, an inhibitory cytokine, not only prevents T cell proliferation, but also can induce T cell exhaustion.\n\nImportant, blocking IL-10 function has been shown to successfully prevent T cell exhaustion in animal models of chronic infection. 33, 34 We demonstrate here that COVID-19 patients have very high levels of serum IL-10 following SARS-CoV-2 infection, while also displaying high levels of the PD-1 and Tim-3 exhaustion markers on their T cells, suggesting that IL-10 might be mechanistically responsible. The application of potent antiviral treatments to prevent the progression to T cell exhaustion in susceptible patients may thus be critical to their recovery. We have read with great interest the successful application of Remdesivir to curing a COVID-19 patient in the US, and to clinical trials indicates that it may have significant potential as such an antiviral. 35, 36 Taken together, we conclude that T cells are decreased and exhausted in patients with COVID-19. Cytokines such as IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 might directly mediate T cell reduction. Thus, new therapeutic measures are needed for treatment of ICU patients, and may even be necessary early on to preempt disease progression in higher-risk patients with low T cell counts.\n\nThe authors declare no financial or commercial conflict of interest. .
