{"title": "Role of CD25+ CD4+ T cells in acute and\npersistent coronavirus infection of the central nervous system", "body": "Regulatory T cells (Treg) which express the Foxp3 transcription factor,\nneuropilin 1 (Nrp-1) and the IL-2 receptor (CD25) comprise ~10% of\nCD4+ T cells in the na\u00efve animal and play an essential role\nin regulating the immune response to infection, progression of clinical disease and\ntissue damage (Langier et al., 2010; Lourenco and La Cava, 2011; Rouse et al., 2006; Rowe et al., 2012). During viral infection the host is\nchallenged to mount an effective anti-viral immune response while minimizing immune\nmediated damage. Exuberant T cell effector function and tissue damage are regulated\nby sustained natural Treg (nTreg), induction of antigen specific Foxp3+\nTreg (iTreg), secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by both\nFoxp3+ and Foxp3\u2212 T cells, as well as inhibitory\nligand receptor interactions (Belkaid, 2007;\nCurotto de Lafaille and Lafaille, 2009;\nLangier et al., 2010; Rowe et al., 2012). Treg influence the immune\nresponse during a variety of acute viral infections (Rouse et al., 2006; Rowe et al.,\n2012; Zelinskyy et al., 2009) and\nare implicated in facilitating persistent infections in both humans and mice (Dittmer et al., 2004; Rowe et al., 2012; Xu et al.,\n2006). However, their suppressive role and the mechanism(s) of\nsuppression vary depending upon both the pathogen and primary tissue infected.\nFollowing mucosal infection by Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) Treg facilitate\nrecruitment of virus effectors to the site of infection (Lund et al., 2008). They also enhance the severity of murine\nhepatitis virus (MHV) induced hepatitis due to their expression of the\nimmunosuppressive cytokine fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Shalev et al., 2009). By contrast, during acute respiratory\nsyncytial virus (RSV) infection of the lung or Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)\ninfection of the eye, Treg limit cellular recruitment into the site of infection,\ndiminishing tissue destruction (Lee et al.,\n2010; Suvas et al., 2004). These\nfindings suggest that Treg play an important role in regulating immunopathology\nassociated with viral infection; however, this anti-inflammatory regulation may also\nreduce anti-viral activity, leading to delayed clearance and/or viral\npersistence.\n\nThe balance between an effective immune response, limited tissue damage, and\nestablishment of viral persistence is especially critical in the central nervous\nsystem (CNS), due to its limited regenerative capacity. Theiler's murine\nencephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection produces an acute encephalitis in mouse\nstrains either susceptible or resistant to chronic CNS infection. Depletion and/or\nfunctional inactivation of CD25+ Treg did not affect CNS inflammation or\nTMEV replication in mice resistant to chronic infection (Richards et al., 2011). The identical depletion strategy\nresulted in both enhanced inflammation and control of TMEV replication in the CNS of\nmice susceptible to chronic infection (Richards et\nal., 2011). By contrast, Treg depletion prior to acute infection with a\nneuronotropic MHV, which also produces chronic demyelination, did not alter CNS\ninflammation or virus specific T cell responses (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2012). Following CNS infection with an MHV\nvariant containing a mutation in the immunodominant CD4+ T cell epitope\nwhich ameliorates disease, anti-CD25 mediated Treg depletion increased both\nmorbidity and mortality (Anghelina et al.,\n2009). A beneficial role of Treg was also supported by adoptive transfer\nof nTreg at a time when CNS infection by a sub-lethal, glial tropic JHM strain of\nMHV (JHMV) was already established. The increased Treg ameliorated clinical disease\nand immunopathology without altering viral clearance (Trandem et al., 2010). Nevertheless, the role of\nCD25+ Treg in the pathogenesis of acute JHMV encephalomyelitis and\nprogression to persistent CNS infection is unclear. To better define the role of\nCD25+ Treg early during JHMV induced encephalomyelitis and potential\nconsequences on the chronic infection associated with sustained demyelination, the\npresent study examined depletion/functional inactivation of CD25+ cells\nin wild type (WT) and syngeneic IL-10 reporter mice. The Treg population, composed\nof both Nrp1hi and Nrp1low Treg, peaked in the CNS during\nacute infection, declined as virus was controlled, and was retained in the CNS\nduring viral persistence. The absence of CD25+CD4+ T cells did\nnot influence the composition or extent of the CNS inflammatory cells, including\nvirus-specific CD8+ T cells. However, CD25 depletion transiently impaired\ninfectious virus control in the absence of detectable differences in ex\nvivo cytolytic effector function. The transient delay in virus control\ncorrelated with increased tissue damage although viral persistence within the CNS\nwas not altered. These data support the concept that the regulation of the immune\nresponse within the CNS by CD25+ T cells during JHMV infection is\nconfined to a temporally narrow window during the initiation and effector phase of\nthe acute inflammatory response.\n\nPrior to initiating anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment the\nkinetics and relative composition of CD25+ and\nFoxp3+CD4+ T cells recruited into the CNS were\nassessed following JHMV infection. CNS accumulation of CD25+ and\nFoxp3+CD4+ T cells followed similar patterns\nthroughout infection (Fig. 1A). Total\nnumbers of both CD25+CD4+ and Foxp3+ T cells\npeaked at day 7 post infection (p.i.) comprising ~20% of total\nCD4+ T cells (Fig. 1). These\npopulations declined rapidly by day 10 p.i. and stabilized thereafter (Fig. 1B and C). Importantly, >\n75% of CD25+ cells expressed Foxp3+ at day 7 p.i.\nindicating a minority of ~25% non Treg CD4+ effector\ncells expressed CD25 (Fig. 1A and D). These\ndata show that the vast majority of the Foxp3+ population expressed\nCD25 (Fig. 1A and D) and this proportion\nremained stable at 75\u201380% throughout the infection (Fig. 1A and D).\n\nTo distinguish a phenotypic transition of Treg populations, possibly\naccompanied by differential expression of CD25, nTregs were identified based on\nhigh Nrp-1 expression (Weiss et al.,\n2012; Yadav et al., 2012). At day\n7 p.i., Nrp-1hi nTreg represented the majority (~75%)\nof Foxp3+ Treg within the CNS (Fig. 2A\nand B). At day 10 p.i., the frequency of Nrp-1hi nTreg\ndeclined to ~50% and remained stable at all subsequent time\npoints, resulting in an equal proportion of Nrp-1hi and\nNrp-1low Treg (Fig. 2A and\nB). Similar to the total Foxp3+ population (Fig. 1D), CD25 expression remained stable at\n~75% on both Nrp-1hi (Fig. 2C) and Nrp-1low Treg during the course of infection\n(Fig. 2C and D). These data predicted\nthat the majority of CD25+Foxp3+ Treg are susceptible to\nanti-CD25 treatment. Moreover, CD25 treatment at early times during infection\nwas anticipated to primarily target prevailing Nrp-1hi Treg and only\na minor population of CD25+ effector T cells.\n\nThe role of CD25+ Treg in JHMV induced sub-lethal\nencephalomyelitis and viral persistence was thus examined by infection of mice\ntreated with anti-CD25 mAb at day \u22123, 0, and +3 relative to infection.\nJHMV induces clinical symptoms associated with encephalitis which transitions to\npredominantly hind limb paralysis. Severity of clinical symptoms reflects both\nviral load and the antiviral immune response (Bergmann et al., 2006; Kapil et al.,\n2009; Weiss and Leibowitz,\n2011). Anti-CD25 treatment did not alter disease onset, severity or\nthe progression of clinical symptoms (Fig.\n3A). These data contrast with the reduced morbidity mediated by\nadoptive transfer of nTreg during JHMV infection (Trandem et al., 2010). Therefore we assured the efficacy of\nanti-CD25 treatment. Anti-CD25 mAb eliminated essentially all CD25+ T\ncells from the cervical lymph nodes (CLN) at least until day 14 p. i.; a small\npercentage of CD4+CD25+ T cells, representing\n~15% of control levels, emerged by day 21 p.i. (data not shown).\nFlow cytometric analysis of CD4+ T cells recruited into the CNS\nindicated the anti-CD25 treatment was also effective at the site of infection at\nleast until day 14 p.i. (Fig. 3B and C). At\nday 21 p.i., the frequency of CD25+ CD4+ cells within the\nCNS of the anti-CD25 treated group, returned to control levels, suggesting\naccumulation of CD25+CD4+ T cells from the reemerging\nperipheral pool. Neither total numbers of CD45hi inflammatory cells\nnor CD11b+ macrophages recruited into the CNS were altered in the\nanti-CD25 treated group compared to controls (Fig.\n4A and B), consistent with the similarity in clinical disease.\nAlthough CD25+ T cells comprise up to 30% of CD4+\nT cells in the CNS at day 7 p.i. (Figs. 1A\nand 3C), total CD4+ T cells in\nthe CNS were unaltered at all times p.i. comparing anti-CD25 treated and control\ngroups (Fig. 4C). These data suggest the\npossible enrichment of CD4 effector T cells at the site of infection. These data\nalso demonstrate efficient and sustained depletion/functional inactivation of\nCD25+ T cells from both the periphery and CNS until day 14 p.i,\nspanning the time frame of maximal T cell activation and CNS accumulation (Bergmann et al., 2006; Phares et al., 2010). Moreover, their absence did not alter\neither a clinical component of JHMV-induced encephalitis or the cellular CNS\ninflammation.\n\nCD25+ T cell mediated regulation of anti-viral T cell activity\nwas examined by determining viral loads in the CNS (Fig. 5A). Virus replication was not influenced by the\nabsence of CD25+ T cells at days 3 and 5 p.i., confirming the absence\nof defects in innate immunity critical for the early control of JHMV spread\n(Ireland et al., 2008). However, at\nday 7 p.i. when anti-viral T cell activity is maximal (Bergmann et al., 2006; Phares et al., 2010). CNS viral replication was increased in\nanti-CD25 compared to control mAb treated mice (Fig. 5A). A marginal, but not statistically significant, increase in\ninfectious virus was sustained to day 10 p.i. (Fig. 5A). Nevertheless, impaired virus control was transient, as no\ndifferences were detected at day 14 p.i. and infectious virus was undetectable\nin the CNS of either group at day 21 p.i. (Fig.\n5A). Consistent with delayed, but eventually effective viral control,\nno clinical evidence of viral recrudescence was found in CD25 depleted mice.\n\nT cell mediated cytolytic activity and IFN-\u03b3 are the primary\nimmune effectors controlling JHMV replication within the CNS (Bergmann et al., 2006) and Treg depletion\nenhances CD8+ T cell number and activity (Dietze et al., 2011; Haeryfar et al., 2005). Comparison of anti-CD25 treated and control\nmice indicated no affect on CNS IFN-\u03b3 mRNA levels or frequencies of\nvirus-specific T cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 (data not shown). The limited\ncontrol of viral replication at day 7 p.i. in the absence of CD25+ T\ncells (Fig. 5A) did not coincide with\nimpaired CNS recruitment of total CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5B). Although recruitment of CD8+ T cells\ninto the CNS was increased at days 10 and 14 p.i., these increases did not reach\nstatistical significance. Similarly, the apparent increase in virus specific\nCD8+ T cells at days 10 and 14 p.i. also did not reach\nstatistical significance (Fig. 5C). During\ninfluenza virus infection of the lung, highly cytolytic IL-10 producing\nCD8+ T cells are dependent upon CD4+ T cells (Sun et al., 2011), suggesting a possible\ninfluence of CD4+CD25+ T cells on CD8+ T cell\nfunction during JHMV. Furthermore, an IL-10+CD8+ T cell\npopulation constituting ~25% of virus-specific CD8+ T\ncells resides within the JHMV infected CNS at day 7 p.i. (Puntambekar et al., 2011), comprising CD8+ T\ncells with high cytolytic potential (Trandem et\nal., 2011a). Anti-CD25 treated and control IL-10 reporter mice were\ntherefore infected to examine the possibility of diminished IL-10+\neffector CD8+ T cells. Similar to WT mice, anti-CD25 mAb treatment\nwas effective at eliminating CD25+CD4+ T cells from the\nCNS of infected IL-10 reporter mice until at least day 14 p.i (data not shown).\nAnti-CD25 treatment reduced the frequency of IL-10+CD4+ T\ncells by ~30% at day 7 p.i.; however, the population returned to\nWT levels by day 10 p.i (data not shown). In contrast to the CD4+ T\ncell population, virus specific CD8+IL-10+ were slightly\nreduced at both days 7 and 10 p.i.; however, these decreases also did not reach\nstatistical significance. CNS derived mononuclear cells from infected anti-CD25\nand control mAb treated mice were also tested for direct ex\nvivo cytolytic activity at day 7 p.i. Although virus replication\nwas increased at day 7 p.i. in the anti-CD25 treated group (Fig. 5A), cytolytic activity by CNS derived CD8+\nT cells was not altered by anti-CD25 treatment (Fig. 5E). Furthermore, cytolytic activity in both anti-CD25 and\ncontrol mAb treated groups decreased at day 10 p.i. (data not shown), consistent\nwith previous results (Bergmann et al.,\n1999). Thus the transiently increased viral load in the absence of\nCD25+CD4+ T cells could not be correlated with either\nreduced IFN-\u03b3, virus-specific CD8+ T cell recruitment or\ncytolytic activity. Transiently decreased anti-viral activity may thus be due to\ninsufficient help provided by CD25+CD4+ T cells (Phares et al., 2012) or induction of\ninhibitory molecules (Phares et al.,\n2009), neither of which would be directly reflected by in\nvitro analysis.\n\nA number of chronic viral infections are associated with\nCD25+CD4+ Treg (Belkaid, 2007; Rowe et al.,\n2012). However, no clinical or virological evidence for viral\nrecrudescence was found in the anti-CD25 treated group (Figs. 3A and 5A),\nsimilar to control mice. Therefore, the ability of CD25+ T cells to\ninfluence viral persistence was examined by PCR due to the absence of infectious\nvirus during JHMV persistence (Bergmann et al.,\n2006; Phares et al., 2010). As\nexpected based on the limited ability of anti-CD25 treated mice to control viral\nload at day 7 p.i., expression of the mRNA encoding the viral nucleocapsid (N)\nprotein was increased in the brains of anti-CD25 treated mice compared to\ncontrols (data not shown). At subsequent times p.i., however, viral mRNA\nexpression was equivalent in the spinal cords of both groups (Fig. 6A), the predominant site of JHMV\npersistence (Bergmann et al., 2006; Marten et al., 2000). These results\nindicate that diminished viral control during the acute phase of coronavirus\nmediated encephalomyelitis in the absence of CD25+CD4+ T\ncells did not facilitate viral persistence.\n\nThe transient decrease in control of CNS viral replication, decreased\ndemyelination mediated by nTreg adoptive transfer in a similar model of JHMV\ninfection (Trandem et al., 2010) and the\ndelayed onset of demyelination in anti-CD25 treated TMEV infected mice (Richards et al., 2011) suggested that\nCD25+CD4+ T cells might influence JHMV induced tissue\ndamage. Therefore, spinal cords from anti-CD25 treated and control mice were\ncompared for inflammation, the extent and distribution of viral antigen, as well\nas demyelination at day 14 p.i. when viral mRNA levels were equivalent (Fig. 6A). No differences in the extent or\ndistribution of inflammatory cells were detected comparing the two groups (Fig. 6B). Similar inflammation is consistent\nwith the overall recruitment of both inflammatory cells (Fig. 4A) and their composition (Figs. 4 and 5).\nAlthough few infected cells were found in either group (Fig. 6B), consistent with low levels of infectious virus\n(Fig. 5A), the predominant cell type\ninfected exhibited the morphology and anatomical location of oligodendroglia and\nwas similar in both groups (Fig. 6B). These\ndata suggested that anti-CD25 treatment did not alter viral tropism.\n\nTo determine if the transiently increased viral load during the acute\nphase of infection prolonged or worsened tissue damage, demyelination was\nquantified in both groups at different times p.i. No difference in demyelination\nwas apparent at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 6C).\nHowever, the extent of demyelination was increased in the spinal cords of the\nCD25 deficient mice at days 14 and 21 p.i (Fig. 6B\nand C). These data support the notion that the early events of viral\ninduced tissue damage within the CNS are not regulated by\nCD25+CD4+ Treg cells. However, these data support the\nconcept notion that the subsequent presence of Treg in the damaged CNS is not\nsufficient to stem demyelination initiated during the early phase of virus\nreplication.\n\nDuring viral infections Treg can suppress T cell activity at multiple\nlevels. They can directly limit T cell priming in the draining lymph nodes and\ntrafficking to the effector site (Lee et al.,\n2010; Suvas et al., 2004) where\nthey can further dampen T cell effector function to prevent bystander damage.\nIndeed, recent evidence suggests that suppression is more important at the site of\ninfection (Ding et al., 2012). However,\nsuppressing an anti-viral response may also allow virus dissemination to cells\ncritical for maintaining homeostasis and/or facilitate viral persistence (Belkaid, 2007; Rouse et al., 2006; Rowe et al.,\n2012). In this regard the CNS presents an especially challenging site to\ncontrol infection due to the limited capacity for regeneration of specialized cells.\nJHMV induces an acute encephalomyelitis characterized by the recruitment of a\nvariety of innate and adaptive immune effectors into the CNS (Bergmann et al., 2006), including Treg (Anghelina et al.; 2009, Puntambekar et al., 2011). Although reduced tissue damage following\nadoptive transfer of nTreg at the peak of acute JHMV encephalitis (Trandem et al., 2010) implicated a local\nprotective role, protection was not associated with either Treg recruitment into the\nCNS or decreased virus replication (Trandem et al.,\n2010). These results suggested that after infection is established the\nprimary site of Treg function may be the CLN. Our data demonstrate that the high\nfrequency of Treg recruited into the CNS during the peak of acute inflammation\ndeclines as virus replication is controlled. Consistent with previous data (Puntambekar et al., 2011) Treg are nevertheless\nretained within the CNS during persistence. Moreover, the majority of Treg expressed\na Npr-1hi phenotype during peak CNS inflammation, consistent with their\nprevious designation as nTreg based on expression of the helios transcription factor\n(Zhao et al., 2011). The Treg population\nwithin the CNS declined dramatically by day 10 p.i. as virus replication was\ncontrolled. However, the Nrp-1low Treg population increased to a stable\n~50% of total Treg as virus replication was controlled and similar\nproportions of Nrp-1hi and Nrp-1low Treg were retained in the\nCNS.\n\nTo determine if Treg influenced acute JHMV infection and subsequently\ndemyelination, mice were treated with anti-CD25 mAb prior to infection. This well\nestablished methodology has been used to minimize the influence of Treg on viral\npathogenesis in both the CNS and at other anatomical sites. Inhibition of\nIL-2-IL/IL-2R interactions may explain the limited inflammation in some viral\ninfections (Fulton et al., 2010; Ruckwardt et al., 2009), but it has no effect\non inflammation in others (Betts et al.,\n2011). In addition, anti-CD25 treatment increases CD8+ T cells\nresponses under some, but not all circumstances (Betts et al., 2011; Dietze et al.,\n2011; Fulton et al., 2010; Haeryfar et al., 2005; Ruckwardt et al., 2009). Both CD25+CD4+ T\ncells and CD4+IL-10+ T cells are rapidly recruited into the\nJHMV infected CNS (Anghelina et al., 2009;\nPuntambekar et al., 2011). However, both\nvirus control and inflammation are Treg independent following infection with a\nrelated MHV (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2012).\nTherefore, it was not surprising that anti-CD25 treatment did not alter recruitment\nof inflammatory cells into the CNS. Limited Treg mediated suppression within the CNS\nis also consistent with an adverse environment established during CNS inflammation\n(Korn et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2008). Indeed, induction of IL-12 or IL-6 within\nthe CNS during JHMV infection (Kapil et al.,\n2009) may contribute to limiting suppressive activity (Longhi et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2012). Furthermore a variety of inhibitory\nmolecules, i.e. Programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1), as well as the anti-inflammatory\ncytokine IL-10 influence JHMV pathogenesis (Phares\net al., 2010; Trandem et al.,\n2011b) potentially exhibiting more potent regional effects than Treg. For\nexample, JHMV infection of IL-10 deficient mice demonstrated accelerated viral\nclearance, yet dramatically enhanced tissue destruction (Trandem et al., 2011a). During JHMV infection IL-10 secretion\nwithin the CNS is limited to the T cell compartment with\nCD25+IL-10+CD4+ T cells, characteristic of\nnTreg, rapidly recruited into the CNS (Puntambekar\net al., 2011). The absence of a suppressive effect suggested by anti-CD25\ntreatment may reside in the rapid replacement of this population by\nCD25\u2212 IL-10+ CD4+ T cells (Puntambekar et al., 2011), or the loss of CD25\nexpression. Although the precise phenotype of the\nCD25\u2212IL-10+CD4+ T cell population is\nunclear, it is possible it comprises virus-specific Foxp3+ Treg (Zhao et al., 2012) or virus-specific\nIL-10+ Foxp3\u2212 cells regulated by IL-27 (Wojno and Hunter, 2012). Interestingly,\n~5% of Treg infiltrating the CNS during JHMV infection are\nvirus-specific (Zhao et al., 2011). As CD25\nexpression was not assessed on this population, our data cannot exclude that\nenrichment of this population in the CD25\u2212Foxp3+\nsubset may contribute to JHMV pathogenesis.\n\nControl of CNS virus replication was partially inhibited at the peak of\nreplication, suggesting that CD25+CD4+ T cells enhanced the\ninitial phase of adaptive immunity. Although anti-CD25 treatment did not alter\nnumbers of inflammatory cells recruited into the CNS or the proportions of\nanti-viral effectors, we cannot rule out a transient CD25 dependent CD4+\nhelper T cell effect (Phares et al., 2012),\nindependent of the Treg population. This is supported by increased mortality,\ndespite similar JHMV clearance, in transgenic mice lacking both IL-27 and IL-35\n(Tirotta et al., 2013) suggesting that\nneither of these Treg associated cytokines regulates viral clearance. One\npossibility to account for the limited clearance of infectious virus in the absence\nof CD25+CD4+ T cells is inhibition of CTL activity in\nvivo via the inhibitory ligand PD-L1 on CNS targets (Phares et al., 2009) which is not apparent in a\ndirect ex vivo assay. Although PD-L1 mRNA expression was slightly\nincreased in the CNS of the CD25+CD4+ T cell depleted mice\nrelative to controls (data not shown), the difference did not reach statistical\nsignificance. Together, these data indicate that Treg exert minimal effects on\nanti-viral functions during acute JHMV induced encephalomyelitis, similar to their\ninability to alter TMEV induced encephalitis in resistant mice (Richards et al., 2011). Consistent with\nfunctional anti-viral effectors, treatment with anti-CD25 did not enhance or\ndiminish viral persistence. These data contrast with data from a number of both\nhuman and viral infections suggesting that CD25+CD4+ Treg\nfacilitate chronic viral infection (Belkaid,\n2007; Rouse et al., 2006; Rowe et al., 2012). Although\nCD25+CD4+ T cells are rapidly recruited to the site of\ninfection, depletion and/or functional inactivation demonstrates the effect on the\ninflammatory response within the CNS is transient, appearing to decrease the initial\nset point for control of virus replication without influencing viral\npersistence.\n\nTransfer of Treg into mice with an established JHMV infection limited\ndemyelination, consistent with the concept that demyelination is mediated by\nadaptive immunity (Pewe and Perlman, 2002;\nSavarin et al., 2008). However, infection\nof mice treated with anti-CD25 did not alter the extent of tissue damage during the\nacute phase of infection. These data indicate that in contrast to infection of the\neye and mucosal sites (Lund et al., 2008;\nSuvas et al., 2004), Treg do not\nconstitute a primary mechanism of damage control in the CNS during the period of\nmaximal T cell effector function. By contrast, the extent of demyelination increased\nduring viral persistence, even after CD25+ T cells were re-established\nwithin the CNS. Thus despite the minimal influence of\nCD25+CD4+ Treg on JHMV viral load and persistence, these\nminimal alterations were sufficient to influence the extent of tissue damage.\nNevertheless, less extensive tissue damage compared to that found in the total\nabsence of IL-10 (Trandem et al., 2011a),\nsuggests that in addition to Treg, other IL-10 secreting regulatory populations\ncontribute to limiting demyelination following JHMV infection. Overall these results\nsupport the notion that the presence of Treg in the CNS during persistence and\ndemyelination is linked to the control of acute viral load and the resulting viral\ninduced tissue damage.\n\nC57BL/6 mice (WT) were purchased from the National Cancer Institute\n(Frederick, MD). IL-10-GFP and Foxp3-GFP reporter mice on the C57BL/6 background\n(Madan et al., 2009; Korn et al., 2007) were bred locally under\npathogen-free conditions. Female and male mice at 6 weeks of age were infected\nintracranially (i.c.) with 1000 PFU of the sub-lethal glial tropic mAb-selected\nJ2.2v-1 variant of JHMV (Fleming et al.,\n1986). Mice were scored daily following infection for clinical signs\nas follows: 0, healthy; 1, hunched back; 2, partial hind limb paralysis or\nreduced ability to regain an upright position; 3, complete hind limb paralysis;\n4, moribund or dead (Fleming et al.,\n1986). All procedures were conducted in accordance with animal protocols\napproved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Cleveland\nClinic Foundation. To deplete or functionally inactivate CD25+ T\ncells mice received 3 intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 250 \u00b5g of\nanti-CD25 mAb (clone PC61, rat IgG1) obtained from BioXCell (West Lebanon, NH)\non days \u22123, 0 and 3 relative to infection. Controls received 250\n\u00b5g of an irrelevant rat IgG1 mAb (clone GL113,\nanti-\u03b2-galactosidase), originally obtained from Dr. R. Coffman (DNAX\nCorporation, Palo Alto, CA) and prepared as described (Phares et al., 2012) on days \u22123, 0 and 3 relative\nto infection.\n\nBrains were homogenized in Dulbecco's PBS using ice cold\nTenbroeck tissue homogenizers (Wheaton Science Products, Millville, NJ). After\ncentrifugation at 450g for 7 min at 4 \u00b0C supernatants\nwere stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Cell pellets were suspended in RPMI\nmedium containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 and used for the analysis of CNS\ninflammation as described below. Brain derived supernatants were used to\ndetermine virus titers by plaque assay on monolayers of the continuous Delayed\nBrain Tumor (DBT) astrocytoma cell line as described (Fleming et al., 1986; Kapil\net al., 2009; Phares et al.,\n2012)\n\nCNS derived cell pellets resuspended in RPMI medium containing 25 mM\nHEPES (pH 7.2) were adjusted to 30% Percoll (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ).\nCells were separated from myelin debris by centrifugation at\n850g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C onto a 70% Percoll\ncushion. Cells from the 30%/70% interphase were collected,\nwashed and analyzed by flow cytometry or for cytolytic activity. Single cell\nsuspensions from CLN were obtained as described (Bergmann et al., 1999; Kapil et al.,\n2009; Phares et al.,\n2012).\n\nCells were incubated at 4 \u00b0C with 1% mouse serum and\n1% rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 mAb to prevent non-specific staining.\nSurface marker expression was examined using mAb purchased from BD Biosciences\n(San Diego, CA) unless otherwise noted. Staining used fluorescein isothiocyanate\n(FITC), phycoerythrin (PE), Peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP) and\nallophycocyanin (APC)\u2013conjugated mAb specific for: CD45 (30-F11), CD4\n(L3T4), CD8 (53-6.7), F4/80 (Serotec, Raleigh, NC), MHC Class II (2G9), CD25\n(PC61), CD62L (Mel-14), CD44 (IM7), CD69 (H1-2F3) and Npr-1 (R&D\nSystems, Minneapolis, MN). Virus specific CD8+ T cells were\nidentified using DbS510 MHC Class I tetramers (Bergmann et al., 1999; Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).\nCells from IL-10-GFP and Foxp3-GFP reporter mice were analyzed without fixation\nand GFP expression identified in the FL1/FITC channel as previously described\n(Puntambekar et al., 2011). Cells\nwere acquired on a FACSCalibur or FACS Aria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and\nthe data analyzed by FlowJo 7.6 software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR).\n\nSpecific lysis was determined using EL4 (H-2b) targets pulsed\nwith 1 \u00b5M of S510 peptide encoding the H-2Db restricted\nimmunodominant epitope in serum free RPMI medium for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. After\nwashes, S510 coated cells were labeled with high (2.5 \u00b5M) and control\ncells (no peptide) with low (0.125 \u00b5M) carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl\nester (CFSE; Molecular Probes, Eugene OR), respectively. High and low CSFE\nlabeled targets (5 \u00d7 103) were plated into 96 well plates in\na volume of 100 \u00b5l. CNS derived cells were added in a volume of 100\n\u00b5l at various effector: target (E:T) ratios based on the frequency of\nvirus specific CD8+ T cells identified with DbS510\ntetramer (Bergmann et al., 1999). After 6\nh incubation at 37 \u00b0C, cells were harvested and directly acquired on a\nFACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed by FlowJo 7.6\nsoftware (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). Specific lysis was calculated based on\nthe following formula: [1 \u2212 (ratio of targets only/ratio of target + T\ncells)] \u00d7 100.\n\nSpinal cords were homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using\na TissueLyzer and stainless steel beads (Qiagen, Valencia CA) and RNA isolated\nas previously described (Ireland et al.,\n2008). Briefly, following addition of chloroform samples were\ncentrifuged at 12,000g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. RNA was\nprecipitated with isopropyl alcohol, washed with 75% ethanol and\nresuspended in RNase-free water (Gibco/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). DNA was\neliminated using a DNA-free kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was obtained by reverse\ntranscription using 2 \u00b5g of RNA, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse\ntranscriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 10 mM of deoxynucleoside triphosphate\nmix, and 250 ng of random hexamer primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 h at\n37 \u00b0C. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) used\nSYBR\u00ae Green in a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR system (Applied\nBiosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers specific for the JHMV N gene were: (F:\nforward, R: reverse) 5'-CGCAGAGTATGGCGACGAT-3' (F) and\n5'-GAGGTCCTAGTCTCGGCCTGTT-3' (R). Ct values were normalized to\nGAPDH mRNA levels using the following formula: 2[Ct (GAPDH)\u2212Ct\n(gene of interest)] \u00d7 1000 where Ct is the threshold cycle as\npreviously described (Puntambekar et al.,\n2011).\n\nSpinal cords were fixed in 10% Zinc formalin, divided into 6\nsections corresponding to cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions and embedded in\nparaffin as described previously (Hindinger et\nal., 2012) Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin\n(H&E) to visualize inflammation or Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) to visualize\nmyelin. For viral antigen, sections were incubated with anti-JHMV mAb J.3.3\nspecific for the viral N protein and visualized using immunoperoxidase-labeled\nanti-mouse mAb (Vectastain-ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).\nSections were scored in a blind manner for inflammation, demyelination, and\nviral antigen. Stained spinal cord sections of all 6 levels on individual slides\nwere scanned with an Aperio ScanScope (Vista, CA) at 40\u00d7 and digitally\nimaged at high resolution. Spinal cord sections of all 6 levels on individual\nslides stained with LFB were used to quantify areas of demyelination within the\nwhite matter using Aperio software (Hindinger et\nal., 2012). Representative fields were identified based on average\nscore of all sections in each experimental group.\n\nStatistical significance was determined using standard two-tailed\nStudent's t test, assessed by GraphPad Prism 5.0\nsoftware (La Jolla, CA). The results are shown as either mean \u00b1 SEM or\nmean \u00b1 SD for each group. A value of p < 0.05\nwas considered statistically significant."}
