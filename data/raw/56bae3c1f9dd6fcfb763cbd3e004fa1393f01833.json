{"title": "", "body": "It is particularly appropriate that a conference concerned with the effects of intercurrent infections in laboratory rodents on biom\u00e9dical research, in which experimental animals play such a key role, should be dedicated to Wallace Prescott Rowe. For from the beginning of his research career he was concerned with clarifying infectious disease mechanisms, with sorting out primary causes from epiphenomena, recognizing the complexities of etiological and epidemiological puzzles, and asking the questions whose answers would really help to bring insight and order. He had particular talent for perceiving patterns and interrelationships, and for noticing -seeing something new even in long-studied systems. To cite just two examples -one from his very first, and one from his last, singleauthor research paper:\n\nIn 1950 to 1952, working in Erich Traub's laboratory at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda and studying pathogenesis and immune mechanisms of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in adult mice, the young Lt. Rowe was the first to suggest a direct correlation between the pathology of a disease and the host's immune response (1,2), now known in the case of LCM to be a T-lymphocyte mediated phenomenon (3). And in a paper finished in early 1983, he described a unique pathological consequence of exogenous infection of young mice with certain murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs), in which the whiskers of infected mice become deformed: curved, shortened, and sparse (4). I can't guess how many Friend-helper or Moloney MuLV infected mice had been examined previously by investigators all over the world without this really striking effect being remarked upon.\n\nIn the time span marked by these two studies -30-odd years -Wally Rowe worked at NIH, first in association with Robert J. Huebner, for whom he felt and often expressed unending gratitude and respect, and later as Chief of his own laboratory, the Laboratory of Viral Diseases, in NIAID. From just the point of view of research related in some way to laboratory rodents, the area in which significant studies were performed is remarkably broad: Of 15 infectious agents or groups of agents to be covered in this conference, Wally worked with 13, plus one or two not mentioned in the program.\n\nThe work was done by Wally and a small but dedicated staff, supplemented by a sequence of talented guest workers and Research Fellows (too many to list but most now prominent in independent research), and by outside collaborators such as Roger Wilsnack at Becton-Dickinson, Jack Parker and others at Microbiological Associates, Frank Lilly at Albert Einstein University, Lloyd Old and others at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Institute, and Nancy Hopkins at M.I.T., to name only those whose association spanned many years. Wally was a directing or supporting force in studies in which previously undescribed mouse representatives of the adenovirus (5), herpes virus (6), and reovirus (7) groups, were isolated and characterized; and serological and tissue culture assay systems for many murine viruses including polyoma and K viruses, mouse hepatitis virus, Sendai virus, minute virus of mice, and mouse adenovirus, were developed (8-13).\n\nThese techniques were applied to practical, sensitive, and specific systems for monitoring infection in mouse and rat colonies and for detecting virus infection of cell cultures and transplant tumor lines (11, 12, 14, 15) .\n\nThe natural history of polyoma virus infection of wild and laboratory mice (16) , the epidemiology of MHV (17), Sendai virus (18), MVM (15) , and rat coronavirus (19) infections were all described by Wally and his collaborators. And, of course, his final years in research were spent in studying the biology and molecular biology of mouse leukemia virus infection:\n\nIn his laboratory, tissue culture systems for isolation and quantitation were developed (20) (21) (22) ; the defective nature of murine sarcoma virus was described (23); key elements in understanding virus-related genetic resistance were revealed (24-26); new MuLVs were isolated and characterized (27,28), and new relationships of MuLVs to both malignant disease and non-malignant effects recognized (28-32,4); the induction of infectious virus expression by chemicals was demonstrated (33); the genetic transmission of MuLVs was experimentally proven (34), viral genes were chromosomally mapped and virus-congenic mouse strains developed (35, 36) and the structural identity of a virus induction locus and viral sequences in cellular DNA was established (37) ; and the whole concept of endogenous viruses was opened up for intense biological and molecular study.\n\nIn the context of this meeting, perhaps as important as the wide spectrum of viruses and diseases to whose study he contributed, or the depth and influence of his research with murine leukemia viruses, was his insight into the impactbeyond just health considerations -of contamination by extraneous indigenous agents of experimental animals and all reagents derived from them. Such variables as viral interference, helper virus dependencies, suppression of cellular or other immune mechanisms, interferon induction, presence of unrecognized antigenic stimuli and unexpected displays of antigens on cell surfaces -all these and other potential effects and problems were recognized in some form in the work of Wally Rowe.\n\nIn a broader context, though perhaps less obviously pertinent to the subject of this conference, there were many contributions to our understanding of human adenovirus and cytomegalovirus infection and disease, to our knowledge of interactions of viruses with other viruses, and to the development of realistic and rational guidelines for recombinant DNA research.\n\nAnd in even broader terms, this remarkable man conveyed to all who worked with him over the years great gifts: A sense of the fascination and joy of research; the satisfaction of patient and precise development of a system, for which a firm basis is first prepared; and the internal reward of achieving a revealing answer which expands the question and the mind of the investigator. Further, he was generous in his help and with his ideas, considerate in his dealings with young investigators (though demanding high standards), and modest in his acceptance of recognition, always being conscious of what he perceived to be the contribution of others to his success.\n\nIt is most fitting then that we recognized Wally Rowe's personal and scientific contributions to the work of us all, by dedicating this conference to his memory. It is beyond regret that it cannot be to his presence and continued participation. "}
