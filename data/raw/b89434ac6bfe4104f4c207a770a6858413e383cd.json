In early 2015, physicians in Northeast Brazil first found patients with a \"dengue-like syndrome\", and ZIKV was later identified as the cause. [15] High transmissibility was found for ZIKV, with a range of 2-6.6 among the basic reproduction number, [16] especially among those in a high migration flow. [17] This virus can adapt to harsh conditions, even can keep stable structure in the temperature of 40\u00b0C. [18] Microcephaly is a rare condition defined as a smaller head size, compared to other fetuses/babies of the same age/sex/ethnicity, [19] often with prognosis of intellectual disabilities. There is still no uniform and universally accepted diagnostic standard of microcephaly [20] because of its complex and diverse etiology. The possible etiology of microcephaly includes genetic cause, perinatal brain injury, postnatal brain injury, or craniosynostosis. No cause for microcephaly was found in 40% of the child victims. [20] In November 2015, physicians in Brazil began to report that there was a surge of the number of microcephaly among newborns, which was possibly linked to ZIKV infection during the mothers' pregnancy. [21] A Public Health Emergency of International Concern was dispatched to explore the suspected association between ZIKV and microcephaly. [22] We reviewed the published literature to search for hints of further research to clarify or verify the association. The potential association between ZIKV and microcephaly was reported in Brazil, [8, 9, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] French Polynesia, [23, [37] [38] [39] [40] Columbia, [41] America, [42, 43] and Slovenia [44] [ Table 1 ]. The studies were mainly conducted from 2013 to 2016. The cases in the above studies included both resident and nonresident patients.\n\nWe did a comprehensive literature review with the keywords \"zika\" and/or \"microcephaly\" from inception to May 27, 2016, with PubMed. No publication date, language, location, or age restrictions were employed. In this review-based viewpoint, studies were included if they met all of the following criteria: \"probable or confirmed infant microcephaly\" and \"probable or confirmed ZIKV infection among mothers or infants\". The information from selected articles was extracted and entered into Microsoft Excel 2010\u2122 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA) by one reviewer and separately reviewed by another independent reviewer according to the selection criteria. A third independent reviewer reconciled any discrepancy. We extracted the following variables: title of the study, study type, reporting place, probable infection place, study period, study description, maternal ZIKV identification, other maternal infections exception, fetal ZIKV identification, other fetus infections exception, microcephaly identification, and sample size [ Table 1 ]. \n\nAt present, what we know about ZIKV is limited. A few studies in process are trying to uncover the mystery and gain a better understanding. It is estimated that about 80% of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic. The disease often presents as mild and nonlethal among symptomatic infections and the self-limiting disease usually lasts about 1 week, while the incubation period varies from several days to 2 weeks. [12] The characteristics of ZIKV make the infection process unnoticeable due to no obvious symptoms/ signs. People do not care about the self-limiting disease with mild symptoms/signs. Such characteristics hindered the diagnosis and ecological studies in Brazil made the diagnosis imprecise by mainly relying on self-reported symptoms/signs from the patients. [29] The clinical manifestations of ZIKV infections are similar to dengue or chikungunya fever [46] and are even called a \"dengue-like\" illness. [29] \n\nThe virus was often misdiagnosed as dengue virus because of a high cross-reactivity rate between them. During the early stage of the ZIKV outbreak of Yap in Micronesia, the laboratory test results from the dengue IgM kit mistakenly identified the dengue virus. [12] Now, the frequently used laboratory testing methods to confirm ZIKV include both antibody and RNA detection in serum, plasma, urine, saliva, amniotic fluid specimens, cerebrospinal fluid specimens, tissues of autopsy and placenta, and conception products. [3, 9, 43, 44, 47] A recent testing technique in the final validation may differentiate the three viruses: zika, dengue, and chikungunya in early of infection, [48] when a physician cannot confirm the infection from symptoms/signs only. Although laboratory ZIKV testing methods are advanced, at moment, no treatment is pharmaceutically effective to reduce viral load. Clinical trials are absent due to no specific treatment of the ZIKV infection. However, mice model for ZIKV has provided directions of therapy and vaccine products. [49] Interferon may be an option to treat and control acute ZIKV infections and prevent ZIKV pass the placenta. [50] Until, microcephaly is diagnosed by ultrasonography, and women often had an inaccurate recall of their mild symptoms and signs dating back several weeks, even months. Zika-confirmation through the viral load in the acute phase and antibody testing in the convalescence period was absent. [8, 27] There are so many \"ZIKV-like\" symptoms which might occur in diverse diseases including Zika, [24] that even latently infected women are still potentially relevant to fetal microcephaly. [25, 28] Scientists have realized that many other infections should be ruled out to explore the association between ZIKV and microcephaly. [8, 25, 28, 30] In the future, we should study and determine how often patients should be tested to timely identify infection status and have a better response to the virus. It is interesting to explore why the virus was recently reported to be related to microcephaly.\n\nThere are two kinds of mechanism of birth defects ascribed to viruses. Some viruses directly pass through the placenta to infect the fetus and some viruses cause a placental inflammatory reaction and cause further damage. [51, 52] However, the detailed mechanism of ZIKV to embryo or fetus is still unclear. Previous case studies reported that ZIKV was detected in amniotic fluids and fetal brain tissues though blood/urine was negative for the ZIKV. [8, 27, 28, 37, 43, 44] ZIKV identified in amniotic fluids and the fetal brain showed that the viruses can get through the placental barrier. Microscopic placental examinations showed calcific and focal chorionic villi [32, 44] or ultrasonography showed an abnormal placenta. [24] An inflammatory response in the placenta has not been observed. [44, 53] Animal experimental models in mice showed that ZIKV had the capability to destroy the central nervous system and had severe pathological changes in mice. [49] ZIKV may impact the survival and growth of human brain cells by restricting the growth of neurospheres and brain organoids. [54] More appropriate animal models may be needed to solve the mystery between maternal ZIKV infection and microcephaly.\n\nIt is necessary to find what happened to the fetus and how ZIKV generated a smaller head circumference after maternal infection. [27] A flexible definition challenging an accurate diagnosis of microcephaly\n\nThe operational definition of microcephaly is a head circumference below the value of the mean \u22122 standard deviations or <2% of the population of the same race, age, and sex. [55] In Brazil, the value was changed from 33 to 32 cm in all full-term newborns to estimate the number of microcephalics at birth. [56] Microcephaly diagnosis standard in Brazil after December 8, 2015, showed a higher specificity and an equal sensitivity than before. [57] A questioned surge in microcephaly prevalence occurred in 2015 (about 20 cases per 10,000 births), compared to that in previous years (about 1 case per 10,000 births). [29] Considering the uniform diagnostic standard, the number of reported cases was overestimated. Many false diagnosis cases were excluded in the follow-up. [21, 23] Brazil now suffering a severe economic recession is facing a challenge to solve the rising unemployment among young people. [58] With no or little income, the youth of child-bearing age are in an economic-disadvantaged situation and this directly affects their nutritional status. Malnutrition has a negative impact on fetal growth, including head circumference. [59, 60] The reproductive process study of the Dutch famine in 1944-1945 showed that head circumference declined 2.7% during the famine, and rose 2.4% afterward. [61] Randomized controlled studies showed that adequate maternal and fetal nutrition improved prenatal head growth, [62, 63] the difference still existed 7 weeks after birth (corrected value), but catch-up growth at 36 weeks narrowed the gap to borderline significance (P = 0.046). [62, 63] The economic condition may contribute to a false diagnosis of microcephaly, and postdiagnosis follow-up is necessary to make a definite diagnosis or complete correct diagnosis, considering the limitation of the operational definition in the size of head circumference. [64] While microcephaly is often identified after 20 weeks of gestation by ultrasonography, it's much earlier than the possible catch-up opportunity. Nutrition assessment is necessary and cautious for microcephaly diagnosis when ascribe to ZIKV. False diagnosis of microcephaly may report inexact relationship between ZIKV and microcephaly: exaggerated, shrink, or even reverse the links.\n\nEcological studies in Brazil reported a higher prevalence of microcephaly in 2015 than previous years. A higher prevalence was also found in 15 states among the 19 states having ZIKV infections as reported by laboratory confirmation. [23, 26] Nevertheless, the study cannot generate causal reference because it does not rule out unknown and uncontrolled confounders. Brasil et al.'s cohort study showed a positive association between ZIKV and microcephaly, 4/42 versus 0/16 among the exposure group and the nonexposure group, respectively. [24] The limited-sample size study had a control group with a rash during pregnancy, but the cause of the rash was not clearly diagnosed or analyzed. An American case report showed ZIKV infections happened to pregnant women in the second and third trimester, who still delivered healthy babies. [43] Based on the nature of retrospective surveys, ZIKV exposure seemed to occur earlier than microcephaly diagnosis and a temporal relation was established in published articles. However, it should be taken with caution because there was either no laboratory ZIKV confirmation or laboratory exclusion for other infections relevant to microcephaly in the studies. In addition, there were some gaps between exposure and disease confirmation reported in the studies to verify the potential association between ZIKV and microcephaly [ Table 2 ]. The interval between the time when the fetus was first diagnosed as microcephaly and the occurrence of maternal clinical manifestations was on average 13 weeks, with a broad range of 3-27 weeks. The ZIKV outbreak may predict a remarkable increase in the number of microcephaly cases 5-10 months later in Brazil. [65] The long time gap often missed the best time for maternal laboratory ZIKV confirmation. As a nonspecific cause for microcephaly, we need to exclude confounders other than ZIKV exposure. An accurate microcephaly diagnosis will benefit the causal reference between ZIKV exposure and outcome of microcephaly.\n\nThe cerebrospinal fluid test for ZIKV should be performed to verify the effectiveness of the description by the possibly infected fetus.\n\nAn ongoing cohort study in Colombia will attempt to confirm ZIKV infection and rule out many confounders or other infections. [45] The available etiological studies and case studies provide incomplete evidence for the confirmation of a potential association between ZIKV and microcephaly. However, ongoing cohort studies in Brazil and Columbia are expected to generate robust evidence for hypothesis verification. [24, 45] A dose-response relationship was observed in three trimesters, with a higher risk in the first trimester in a model based on data from French Polynesia. [38] In future, if possible, multicenter study should be performed to explore the dose-response relationship in different trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis showed that ZIKV strains of Brazil emerged in a mixed way. [66] The estimated RNA mutation rate was 0.001-0.002 nt \u22121 year \u22121 , [66] lower than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) mutation rate (0.003 nt \u22121 year \u22121 ), [67] and far higher than the human DNA mutation rate. [68] ZIKV has a global movement distribution similar to the chikungunya virus. [69, 70] Perhaps this disease can shed light on the virological study of ZIKV strains isolated in Brazil. A study showed that the isolated strains presented a 99% identification with a strain in French Polynesia in 2013 (KJ776791), [8, 44] but were much closer to the Cambodian strain in 2010. [13] ZIKV strains in Brazil coming from an Asian lineage had 6-15 amino acids changes, compared to a strain in French Polynesia [44] with a 1947 preepidemic prototype. [71] A new clade emergence of chikungunya with mutations caused outbreaks in China and India. [72, 73] Can ZIKV outbreaks in Yap of Micronesia, French Polynesia, and countries of the Americas with an Asian lineage be attributed to micro-mutations of the viruses? [13, 44, 74] What kind of changes happened to the virus from sporadic to outbreak? What about an African lineage? Can the changes of the virus affect the toxicity, replication, and hosting environment? What is the survival time in blood, amniotic fluids, brain, and other tissues? Some studies reported that the viruses had a prolonged life in amniotic fluids and fetal brain. Which genes cause the neurotropism? Can a developing brain structure provide a more hospitable micro-environment for the virus? What is the full spectrum of defects caused by congenital ZIKV infection?\n\nSARS research may shed light on ZIKV evolution at different stages in terms of nucleotide and amino acid mutation. [67] This may uncover the possible change in virus structure of the epidemic strain. Hu et al. [75] found that China Rhinolophus was the natural host of the SARS coronavirus-like virus, rather than palm civets until 2013, and this was 10 years after the first outbreak of SARS. This result was consistent with the fact that few coronavirus-like viruses were separated from palm civets. [76] The present review-based viewpoint claims that it is too early to come up with any explanation or conclusion of the ZIKV infection.\n\nIt is a prerequisite to explore the association of ZIKV and microcephaly from the perspective of the global health. Maternal \"ZIKV-like\" clinical manifestations can corroborate the diagnosis, but maternal and fetal laboratory confirmation, especially autopsy or detection of miscarriage products, could provide more objective evidence. Microcephaly diagnosis relies on ultrasonography during pregnancy, physical birth examination, and/or autopsy of still-birth or miscarriage products, and postdelivery follow-up. We should exclude potential confounders which might cause microcephaly. Other infections related to microcephaly should be detected. Observational studies, especially in economic-advantaged social environment, should follow the above to ensure an accurate outcome. In addition, animal experiments can disclose the possible mechanism, but robust evidence on gestational human being is overwhelming. In addition, comparable studies with other similar viruses will provide experience and lessons. Bioinformatics techniques and findings on similar damages of central nervous system diseases might shed light on the choice of an appropriate animal model, which will be better than mice.\n\nThis work was supported by the grant from 2016 Presidential Fund of Capital Medical University.\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.
