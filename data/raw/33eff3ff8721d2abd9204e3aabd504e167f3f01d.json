{"title": "", "body": "The initial case of COVID-19 in Japan was that of a patient returning from Wuhan, China who showed symptoms on 3 January, 2020. Subsequently, as of 11 March, 2020, 503 cases were announced, including asymptomatic or those abroad in countries such as China but excluding those infected on a large cruise ship, the Diamond Princess [1] .\n\nSports and entertainment events were canceled in Japan for two weeks from 26 February to 11 March according to a government advisory. At the same time, it was advised that small business and private meetings be cancelled voluntarily. The policy is designated as voluntary event cancellation (VEC). Moreover, since 3 March, almost all schools have been closed to control the spread until early April. Although schoolchildren are not of pestiferous age, the policy effects remain unknown. These policies must be evaluated as soon as possible. If the effective reproduction number, R v under these measures is less than one, the outbreak can be contained. Alternatively, even given a low R 0 before these measures, if it was greater than one, it might prolong the outbreak. Nevertheless, one could expect to prevent some fatal cases over time by easing burdens on medical resources or developing a vaccine. The entire course of the outbreak might be altered if these measures were able to reduce infectiousness considerably. Therefore, evaluation of these measures must be thorough when these All rights reserved.

The present study was conducted to evaluate VEC before VEC is cancelled so as to contribute government's decision making whether VEC will be continued or ceased.\n\nWe applied a simple susceptible-infected-recovery (SIR) model [2] to the data assuming an incubation period following its empirical distribution in the early stage of the outbreak in Japan. Experiences of Japanese people living in Wuhan until the outbreak provide information related to mild cases because complete laboratory surveillance was administered for them. During January 29 -February 17, 2020, 829 Japanese people returned to Japan from Wuhan. All had received a test to detect COVID-19; of them, 14 were found to be positive for COVID-19 [3] . Of those 14, 10 Japanese people had exhibited mild symptoms; the other 4 showed no symptom as of February 25. Moreover, two Japanese residents of Wuhan exhibited severe symptoms: one was confirmed as COVID-19. The other died, although no fatal case was confirmed as COVID-19 by testing. In addition, two Japanese residents of Wuhan with mild symptoms were refused re-entry to Japan even though they had not been confirmed as infected.

We therefore apply these proportions to the simulation.\n\nAssuming that the power of infectivity among severe patients and mild patients were equal among the asymptomatic cases, half of the symptomatic cases can be assumed. This assumption about relative infectiousness among asymptomatic cases compared with symptomatic cases was also assumed in simulation studies for influenza [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . We sought R 0 to fit the number of patients during 14 January -28 February and to minimize the sum of absolute values of discrepancies among the reported numbers and the fitted values. Its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the 10000 iterations of bootstrapping for empirical distribution.\n\nWe used data of the community outbreak of patients with COVID-19 who showed any symptom in Japan for 14 January -8 March, 2020. During this period, 432 cases with onset dates occurred. We excluded some patients who had returned from China, and who were presumed to be infected persons from the Diamond Princess. They were presumed to be not community-acquired in Japan.\n\nPublished information about COVID-19 patients with symptoms from the Ministry of Labour, Health and Welfare (MLHW), Japan was usually adversely affected with All rights reserved.

Therefore, published data of patients must be adjust at least a few days. To adjust it, we applied the following regression. We denote Xt-k|t as the number of patients whose onset date was t-k published on day t. The reporting delay multiplied by the latest published data are expected to be predictions of the number of patients whose onset date was t-k. We used this adjusted number of patients in the latest few days including those after VEC was adopted. We used the published data on 2,5,6, 9,10, 11 and 12 March,2020 by MLHW [1] .\n\nFirst, we estimated R 0 in Japan to fit the data of community outbreak before VEC was introduced. Then, using the adjusted data of patients, we estimated R v after VEC was adopted.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Figure 1 showed the empirical distribution of incubation period among 59 cases whose exposed date and onset date were published by MHLW. Its mode was six days and average was 6.6 days. Figure 3 depicts the entire predicted epidemic curve based on R 0 and R v and its 95% CI.

An earlier study [9] estimated R 0 for COVID-19 as 2.24-3.58 in Wuhan. Our R 0 obtained before VEC was similar.\n\nHowever, R v after VEC introduced was 35% reduction from R 0 . Actually, VEC can reduce the COVID-19 infectiousness by 35%. Even was after being reduced, it was higher than one. Therefore, VEC cannot contain the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan completely. The period of outbreak might be prolonged if VEC can be continued until the outbreak ceased. However, the maximum number of inpatients with VEC was lower than that without VEC by 70%. Therefore, we can expect mortality to be reduced All rights reserved.

It is necessary to prove that the benefit attributable to reduction in patients and in mortality cases is greater than the cost of VEC. Such calculations remain as a subject for further research.\n\nResults demonstrated that VEC can reduce infectiousness of COVID-19 by 35%, although the R 0 remains greater than one. The peak number of cases obtained in our simulation was decreased by about one third compared to the peak obtained without adoption of VEC. Moreover, the peak was delayed from occurring.\n\nVEC had been extended until March 19 on March 10. We hope that the present study contribute government's decision making for VEC.
