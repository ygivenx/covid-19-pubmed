{"title": "Adjuvant therapy with traditional Chinese medicine in a heart failure patient complicated by hospital-acquired pneumonia: A case report", "body": "Pneumonia is one of the most common infectious diseases causing significant morbidity and mortality in adults even in the modern medical care system. 1 According to the World Health Organization statistics, pneumonia was the 4th leading cause of death, causing 3.0 million deaths worldwide in 2016. 2 As the 3 rd leading cause of death in 2016, 3 the social-economic burden of pneumonia in Taiwan is significant. Pneumonia is classified as community acquired (CAP) or hospital acquired (HAP) according to the acquisitionsite. 4 The prognosis of HAP patients is unfavorable, especially for those with comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, immunocompromised status, and congestive heart failure (CHF). 5 The standard treatment for HAP includes antimicrobial therapy and supportive care. Antibiotics can attenuate the infectious process. However, with the widespread overuse and misuse of antibiotics, multiple-drug-resistant pathogens give rise to pneumonia that is difficult to treat. 6 The morality rate for HAP (27.7%) is greater than that of CAP and is especially high in those patients with multiple comorbidities. 7, 8 Xu et al conducted a prospective, multi-center, double-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial to evaluate integrated therapy consisting of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and antibiotics in elderly patients with pneumonia. 9 Their findings indicate that TCM combination therapy is safe and effective in ameliorating expectoration and promoting the absorption of pneumonia lesions. 9 Here, we report a HAP patient comorbid with CHF who was treated with TCM adjuvant therapy. The patient exhibited rapid, significant improvement in symptoms and image findings. \n\nOn December 6, 2016, a 33-year-old man presented with fever offand-on up to 39.6\u00b0C, chills, and cough with purulent sputum. He had been discharged from a rehabilitation ward 1-2 days before this admission. His medical history included acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock over the previous year, and his present left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was reduced to 28%. Serial laboratory examinations showed no leukocytosis but neutrophil dominance (83.1%) and an elevated C-reactive protein (C-RP) level of 7.62 mg/dL. Sputum and blood culture analysis were performed on December 6, yielding negative findings. Thoracic radiography revealed a bilateral perihilar alveolar pattern,a dilated azygos vein, and diffuse pulmonary consolidations with air bronchograms in bilateral lower lung fields (Fig. 1) . Accordingly, HAP accompanied by pulmonary edema was diagnosed. Empiric intravenous antibiotic treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g every 8 h was promptly initiated on December 6, 2016.Nevertheless, the patient continued to experience fever and progressive cough with purulent sputum during antibiotic treatment. He asked for TCM combination therapy, which was started on December 9, 2016 (the 3 rd hospital day).\n\nThe diagnosis according to the TMC theory was \"exterior evil inward invasion\" and \"accumulation of phlegm and heat in the lung\" in a yang-deficiency constitution. The \"clearing heat and damp excreting\" decoction was prescribed three times a day as shown in Table 1 . After a 3-day course of treatment, the pneumonia lesions significantly improved on chest X-ray (Fig. 1) . The sputum clearly decreased in volume, and the fever had completely abated by day 5 of TCM adjuvant therapy (Fig. 2) . The patient's report of cough decreased. He also felt much better and more energetic.\n\nWe report a HAP patient comorbid with CHF who experienced rapid and significant improvement in symptoms and image findings following treatment with TCM adjuvant therapy. Because the bacterial cultures from sputum and blood were all negative, we believe that the antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and antitussive effects of the TCM regiment acted against the persistent inflammation in this patient.\n\nThe integration of TCM and Western medicine has been shown effective for treating patients with pneumonia in a previous clinical trial and an animal study of the anti-inflammatory effects of TCM. 9,10 Ma-Xing-Gan-Shi-Tang (MXGST) is an old TCM formula consisting of four ingredients: HerbaEphedrae (Ma Huang), Semen Armeniacae (Xing Ren), Gypsum Fibrosum (Shi Gao), and Radix Glycyrrhizae (Gan Cao). 11 This formula has been used to treat patient with common-cold-related fever and bronchial asthma for several centuries. In a rat model of bronchial asthma, MZGST was shown to exertanti-tussive and anti-pyretic effects through promoting airway smooth muscle relaxation and inhibiting neutrophil recruitment in the airway. 11 In an animal study, treatment of lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury with MXGST resulted in decreased inflammation and a hyperpermeability reaction in lungs through regulation of the toll-like receptor 4, Src, and NF-\u03baB pathways. 12 In this case, we chose HerbaEphedrae (Ma Huang), Gypsum Fibrosum (Shi Gao) and Radix Glycyrrhizae (Gan Cao) as the major components of our mixture because of their antipyretic and anti-asthmatic effects. 13 We added Yu Xing Cao (Houttuyniacordata), Huang Qin (Radix Scutellariae), Mu Dan Pi (Cortex Mountan), Sang Bai Pi (Cortex Mori), and Gua Lou Shi (Fructus Trichosanthis) to increase the antipyretic and antiinflammatory effects. We added Ting Li Zi (SemenLepidii) and Fu Ling (Poria Cocos) to improve the edema status of this patient and Huang Qin (Scutellariae Radix) and Mu Dan Pi (Moutan Cortex) to ameliorate lung inflammation, based on the results of previous investigations. 14 The main component of Moutan cortex is Paeonol, which is reported to have anti-inflammatory effect and anti-pyretic effects against lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury. 15, 16 Yu Xing Cao (Houttuyniacordata) was chosen as a key herb for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects according to multiple studies. 17, 18, 19 Lianqiao (Fructus Forsythiae) was confirmed by studies to have antibacterial, antivirus, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. 20 Fu Ling (PoriaCocos) has anti-inflammatory and diuretic effects, which are reported to improve cardiac function in CHF rats via the AVP-V2R-AQP2 axis. 21, 22 Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) is proven to have cardiotonic action and reverse the dysfunction in CHF processing. 23, 24 Although the pharmacological mechanisms underlying the actions of Gua Lou Shi (FructusTrichosanthis), Sang Bai Pi (Cortex Mori), and Tin\u0261 Li Zi (Semen Lepidii) remain unclear, their functions in dealing with phlegm retention are abundantly documented in the \"Compendium of Materia Medica\" (BencaoGangmu), an ancient TCM herbal text book.\n\nThe role of TCM in this case was not to act as antibiotics to kill pathogens. In fact, the patient had been treated with antibiotics and all the culture reports showed negative results. Therefore, TCM was prescribed to help patient with \"clearing heat and damp excreting\" and have some diuretic effects to improve pulmonary congestion. We suggest that TCM was helpful for the edema and sputum in this case for two reasons: First, after the administration of standard antibiotic therapy, the fever and the progressive cough with purulent sputum persisted. TCM was an extra intervention administered during the fever period. Second, because the bacterial cultures of sputum and blood were all negative before and after antibiotic treatment, the intermittent fever due to inflammatory reaction was highly suspicious after exclusion of other comment causes of fever, such as tumor fever and endocrine disorders. The \"clearing heat and damp excreting\" decoction we use was proven to have anti-inflammatory effects in a previous clinical trial and animal study. We suggest that the decreased time to fever abatement was caused by the improvement of lung inflammation after TCM adjuvant therapy.\n\nAdjuvant therapy with a \"clearing heat and damp excreting\" decoction may improve HAP in a patient comorbid with CHF. These effects may be exerted through the anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory, antitussive and diuretic effects of TCM. Further investigations are warranted to confirm the efficacy and mechanism of TCM treatments for pneumonia.\n\nThe institutional review board (IRB) of the Taichung Veterans General hospital approved this case report with a reference number CE17307A on December 5, 2017. The organized IRB operates according to the good clinical practice and applicable laws and regulations."}
