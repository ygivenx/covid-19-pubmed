{"title": "The uvea", "body": "Anterior uvea: iris and ciliary body Iris ( Fig. 9 .1) \u2022 Stroma \u25a0 Embryologically derived from the neural crest, apart from vascular endothelium derived from mesoderm \u25a0 Loose connective tissue stroma populated by fibroblasts and melanocytes. Melanocyte population tends to be more dense in the posterior stroma than in the anterior stroma \u25a0 The anterior border has no epithelial surface and, therefore, there is little to deter fluid exchange with the anterior chamber \u25a0 Capillaries are non-fenestrated, contributing to the 'bloodaqueous barrier' . However, blood vessel endothelium lacks tight junctions in many domestic animals, with permeability differing greatly between species -Inflammation of the iris leading to increase in vascular permeability manifests as protein in the aqueous humor. This is detectable by slit-lamp biomicroscopy as 'aqueous flare' \u25a0 Granula iridica (corpora nigra) -In domestic herbivores such as equidae, bovids, and camelids, the iridal epithelia at the superior margin of the pupil, and sometimes also at its inferior margin, gather and expand anteriorly to form prominent pigmented nodules or, in the case of the New World Camelids, well-organized pleats -The postulated role of the granula iridica is to shade the structures of the inner eye from ambient sunlight from above, much like the bill or visor of a baseball cap Ciliary body ( Fig. 9 .2) \u2022 The ciliary body is continuous anteriorly with the base of the iris. The structure and function of the aqueous outflow pathways will be addressed in Chapter 13, given their importance in the pathology of glaucoma\n\n\u2022 The ciliary body is divided into an anterior pars plicata, characterized by a series of meridional folds or processes, from which the suspensory zonules of the lens originate, and a posterior pars plana. The structure of the ciliary processes, in terms of their topography and angio-architecture differs considerably between mammalian species, and in nonmammalian vertebrates distinct ciliary processes may be absent\n\n\u2022 The stroma and the ciliary muscle \u25a0 The supraciliary space is a potential space between the sclera and ciliary body and is continuous posteriorly with the \u25a0 The iris stroma, and for that matter the entire globe, lacks lymphatic vessels\n\n\u2022 Muscles and posterior epithelium \u25a0 Sphincter muscle -Constricts in bright light and during accommodation -Smooth muscle in mammals, derived from neuroectoderm of optic cup -Striated muscle in birds and most reptiles, in which it is predominantly of neural crest origin \u25a0 Dilator muscle and posterior pigmented epithelium -The posterior epithelium and the dilator muscle together form a complex two-layered structure derived from the neuroectoderm of the anterior optic cup -The posterior, pigmented epithelium of the iris is continuous posteriorly with the inner, non-pigmented epithelium of the ciliary body -The myoepithelial cells of the anterior iris epithelium are among the most complex cells of the body. Basally, their cytoplasm is contractile (the dilator muscle) and apically the cytoplasm of these epithelial cells contains melanin granules. The anterior iris epithelium is continuous with the pigmented epithelium of the ciliary body -In birds and most reptiles, as with the constrictor muscle, the dilator muscle is striated, although smooth muscle often also plays a role in pupil dilation (E) The highly muscular iris from a diving bird (Loon). In birds, the iridal muscle is skeletal muscle, and in this diving bird the robust iris muscle is important in accommodation. It plays a role in increasing the curvature of the anterior lens surface, thereby increasing refraction.

Disruption of this barrier by inflammation and other disease processes results in an increase in the protein content of aqueous humor, clinically detectable as aqueous flare -The inner epithelium is continuous with the neuro-sensory retina -The basal lamina of the non-pigmented epithelium forms the boundary between the ciliary epithelium and the vitreous body and the posterior chamber \ue073 Anatomically as well as functionally, the vitreous body and the posterior chamber both represent modified extracellular spaces and not luminal spaces. This feature is important to our understanding of how these spaces are invaded by blood vessels and spindle cells during disease states -The ciliary epithelium secretes hyaluronic acid. The hyaluronic acid is secreted apically and must be transported around the cell toward the vitreous body in extra-cellular 'channels' visible on Alcian blue staining -The inner, non-pigmented epithelium of the ciliary body is often laden with lympho-plasmacytic inflammatory cells in chronic inflammation and also in lymphoma \ue073 This observation leads one to speculate that the non-pigmented epithelium serves a function in immune-regulation -The native inner epithelium is vimentin positive and cytokeratin negative, a staining pattern which is unusual among epithelial tissues \u25a0 The outer, pigmented epithelium -The basal lamina of the pigmented epithelium of the ciliary body lies at the junction with the stroma suprachoroidal space. The supraciliary and suprachoiroidal space play a role in the uveoscleral or unconventional pathway of aqueous outflow. This space becomes prominent when exudates or hemorrhage accumulate in the uvea, particularly inferiorly due to the additional influence of gravity \u25a0 The stroma of the ciliary body contains the ciliary muscle, or the muscle of accommodation -The ciliary muscle is derived from neural crest tissue -The ciliary muscle is smooth muscle in mammals and striated in birds and most reptiles -The ciliary body vasculature is highly permeable, with fenestrated capillaries, thus making no functional contribution to the blood-aqueous barrier\n\n\u2022 The ciliary body epithelium \u25a0 The ciliary body epithelium is a two-layered epithelium derived from neuroectoderm of the optic cup -The cells of these two mono-layers are oriented apex-to-apex -The inner epithelium is non-pigmented except immediately adjacent to the iris epithelium, where it may contain pigment -Ciliary epithelium actively secretes aqueous humor against a pressure gradient -The ciliary epithelium secretes extra-cellular matrix proteins which assemble to form the zonular ligaments suspending the lens -The ciliary epithelium secretes hyaluronic acid which provides substance to the vitreous body \u25a0 Inner, non-pigmented ciliary epithelium -Junctional complexes in the apico-lateral membranes of the inner, non-pigmented epithelial cells represent the The formalin-fixed globe was post-fixed in glacial acetic acid, which helps to opacify the zonular ligaments fibers (arrows).\n\nThe choroidal stroma contains many large arteries and veins supplying blood to the choriocapillaris, a capillary bed with a very high rate of perfusion.\n\n\u2022 The choriocapillaris is a highly fenestrated capillary bed supplying nutrition to the outer retina \u2022 The choriocapillaris is defined internally by Bruch's membrane, which is a multi-layered basement membrane complex formed by the basal laminae of the capillary endothelium and the retinal pigment epithelium, with variable amounts of collagen and elastin fibers.\n\nThe tapetum lucidum \u2022 Most of the common domestic mammalian species have a highly reflective tapetum lucidum positioned between the choriocapillaris and the medium-sized vessel layer of the choroidal stroma, superior to the optic nerve head. The peak -The outer epithelium of the ciliary body is continuous with the retinal pigment epithelium.\n\nThe choroid ( Fig. 9 .3) is the vascular tunic of the posterior segment.\n\n\u2022 It supplies vascular perfusion for the highly metabolically active and oxygen dependent outer retina via the choriocapillaris \u2022 The choroid usually contains abundant melanocytes and serves as a pigmented lining of the rigid globe, which reduces internal light reflection and also functions as a 'sink' that traps free-radicals.\n\nThe suprachoroidal space is a potential space immediately adjacent to the sclera, which often expands and fills with edema, hemorrhage, or exudates in disease states. It is continuous anteriorly with the supraciliary space and plays an important role in unconventional outflow of aqueous humor. devoid of melanin, but variably hypoplastic. Likewise, the tapetum is often hypoplastic or absent\n\n\u2022 The canine blue eye contains no identifiable melanocytes in the iris stroma when stained, by immunohistochemistry, for melanocytic markers. However, premelanosomes have been described in the cytoplasm of cells presumed to be melanocytes when examined with transmission electron microscopy. Feline and human blue irides have stromal melanocytes, but their cytoplasm lacks melanosomes.\n\nSee Collie eye anomaly and anomalies associated with merle ocular dysgenesis in Chapter 3.\n\nIris hypoplasia and aniridia ( Fig. 9 .5) \u2022 Iris hypoplasia generally affects only iris stromal tissue and may be localized to specific zones of the iris. \u25a0 Blue irides are most often affected, although pigmented irides may also be hypoplastic \u25a0 Hypoplastic tissue may appear thin in cross-section, or clinically may appear to bulge anteriorly \u25a0 In horses, zones of iris stromal hypoplasia are commonly observed superior to the pupil margin. Clinically these often appear to bulge anteriorly\n\n\u2022 Sporadic reports of cases diagnosed clinically as aniridia\n\ngenerally represent examples of severe iris hypoplasia, with rudimentary iris tissue. True aniridia is very rare \u25a0 Bilateral aniridia has been reported in horses, and in some breeds may be a familial trait \u25a0 Aniridia is a rare, sporadic abnormality in other species, but has been documented in Llanwenog sheep in the UK \u25a0 Dermoid, or corneal vascularization, has been reported as a concurrent finding in aniridia, often involving the superior limbus \u25a0 Congenital cataract is also a frequent finding \u2022 There are three equine cases of severe iris hypoplasia in the COPLOW collection. \u25a0 All three cases in the COPLOW collection also have epithelial thickening at the limbus with hyperkeratosis but not true dermoid \u25a0 All three cases also had concurrent cataract \u2022 Diffuse iris stromal hypoplasia is also observed in Siamese cats with inherited congenital glaucoma (see Ch. 13) \u2022 Hypoplasia of the iris dilator muscle, clinically appreciated as a miotic pupil, is a characteristic feature of the complex of congenital ocular anomalies seen in Rocky Mountain horses (see Ch. 3).\n\n\u2022 These strands of uveal tissue represent remnants of the vessels and mesenchyme of the anterior tunica vasculosa lentis, or pupillary membrane, a sheet that normally overlies the anterior surface of the lens during development. \u25a0 The tunica vasculosa lentis mostly regresses by the time of birth, or within the first several weeks of life, depending on the species and their degree of ocular maturity at birth \u25a0 PPM represent a delay in, or failure of, normal regression of the anterior tunica vasculosa lentis \u2022 PPMs are a common incidental finding, recognized sporadically in dogs and horses. An inherited predisposition has been reported in several breeds of dog, most notably the Basenji wavelength of the light reflected by the tapetum is thought to be tailored to that particular species' biological niche \u25a0 The cellular tapetum -All carnivores have a cellular tapetum made up of regularly arranged cells. Each tapetal cell contains precisely oriented organelles (rodlets) that reflect light in the visible spectrum \ue073 The canine tapetum, in common with that of all carnivores except cats, has a highly variable thickness and the reflective rodlets are composed of a zinc-cysteine complex. The canine tapetum can be so thin that it may not be apparent by light microscopy and one must rely on identification of the non-pigmented RPE to determine the location of the superior fundus \ue073 The feline tapetum is distinct from that of the dog, in that it is consistently thicker and the reflective rods, which are more precisely oriented, are made up of a riboflavin-zinc complex. This type of tapetum is strongly autofluorescent \u25a0 The fibrous tapetum -Domestic herbivores generally have a tapetum made up of cell-poor, regularly oriented layers of collagen \u2022 The overlying retinal pigment epithelium lacks pigment in the area of the tapetum \u2022 Penetrating vessels can be seen in cross-section to pass from the medium-sized vessel layer through the tapetum at right angles, then terminate in the choriocapillaris.\n\nWhile in general terms the anatomy of the human uvea conforms to that described for other species, differences exist -some subtle and some profound. Often, when confronted with an eye from a non-human species, an ophthalmic pathologist can find distinctive clues to the identity of that species from the appearance of the iris, ciliary body, or choroid and tapetum lucidum. Although a broad class of retinal diseases in humans is referred to as tapeto-retinal degeneration, the human does not have a reflective, cellular, or fibrous tapetum lucidum positioned between the choriocapillaris and the choroidal stroma. The presence of the tapetum lucidum is always intriguing when seen by pathologists accustomed mainly to human eyes.\n\nThe morphologic features of the canine blue eye (Fig. 9 .4) \u2022 In the absence of pigment within the iris stroma, the iris color will appear blue because of the diffraction of incident light within the iris stroma. The absence of pigment is due to a genetic color diluting effect, e.g. associated with the merle gene in dogs, on melanocytes of the body that are derived from the neural crest, including those of the hair coat and the stromal tissues of the uveal tract. The lack of pigment is not always uniform. For example, in some animals only one eye is blue while the other is brown (heterochromia irides), or in some eyes only a portion of the iris is blue (heterochromia iridis)\n\n\u2022 The iris epithelium and the retinal pigment epithelium have a distinct neuroepithelial embryological origin, and are normally pigmented \u2022 Iris stroma is devoid of pigment but not usually significantly hypoplastic. In contrast, the choroid of affected eyes is not only distinguished from congenital iris hypoplasia or colobomas \u2022 Atrophy can also be a feature in chronic glaucoma or after trauma.\n\n\u2022 Sporadic iridal cysts (Figs 9.7, 9.8) \u25a0 Cysts of the posterior iris epithelium may be recognized in any species, and occur commonly in dogs. They may affect any breed, being particularly common in Labrador and Golden retrievers, but are seldom of clinical significance \u25a0 The pigmented epithelium of the iris or, less frequently, the inner epithelium of the ciliary body, undergoes spontaneous cystic hyperplasia, in the absence of inflammation or any other apparent predisposing factors\n\n\u2022 PPM may also occur in association with other lesions, including microphthalmic syndromes, and with local cataract or corneal opacity if they attach to the anterior lens capsule, or corneal endothelium respectively \u2022 Peter's anomaly, refers to a more severe spectrum of anterior segment malformation characterized by persistent sheets of mesenchyme and corneal and lens opacities (see Ch. 3).\n\nDegenerative, hyperplastic, and age-related conditions Iris atrophy ( Fig. 9 .6) \u2022 Iris atrophy is seen as an age-related change in several species \u25a0 Progressive thinning of the iris stroma can lead to the appearance of 'holes' in the iris that should be -Similar cystic changes may affect the iris epithelium associated with the corpora nigra in horses, and if sufficiently large, can impact vision -Acquired iris cysts, in cats, are a consistent morphological feature seen in eyes with a history of blunt trauma, or with other morphologic features suggestive of blunt trauma -Spontaneous iris cysts are more likely to be bilateral and multiple in cats than in dogs and horses \u25a0 Clinical appearance and complications of iris cysts -Cysts can break off and float free in the anterior chamber, although in cats they generally remain attached to the iris epithelium. Very rarely, they can move into the vitreous -In dogs and horses, these cysts are typically spherical or ovoid and often darkly pigmented although they may vary in their degree of pigmentation. Feline iris cysts tend to be black, or very darkly pigmented, and are often more elongated and ovoid in appearance than canine iris cysts -Cysts can masquerade as pigmented masses and careful clinical evaluation is essential to avoid inappropriate removal of the eye. As they are thin-walled, iris cysts can be distinguished from other pigmented masses (neoplasms) by trans-illumination using a bright light source Figure 9 .6 Iris atrophy. Siamese, 13 years old: the tapetal reflex can be seen in the thin temporal iris. It is especially obvious through the many iris holes. \u2022 Multiple irido-ciliary cysts in Golden Retriever dogs, 'pigmentary uveitis' (Figs 9.10, 9.11 ) \u25a0 The occurrence of multiple, thin-walled, irido-ciliary cysts is an important cause of glaucoma in Golden Retrievers. Within the COPLOW collection, there are 134 cases, representing 20% of glaucomas diagnosed in Golden Retrievers \u25a0 Based entirely on submissions to the COPLOW collection, this condition was most prevalent in the Golden Retriever population in the North-eastern United States in the 1990s, which may reflect the common ancestry of this population \u25a0 The condition is seldom diagnosed in Golden Retrievers in Europe, although a very similar condition has been reported in Great Danes. There is one case in a Great Dane in the COPLOW collection, and occasional cases with similar morphology in other breeds have been diagnosed at COPLOW \u25a0 There are significant differences between the clinical presenting features and the histopathological features of this disease:\n\n-Cysts can make contact with the lens, resulting in focal capsular opacity, and may even initiate posterior synechiae -Cysts can adhere to the endothelial surface of the cornea, and if they rupture or collapse, may be a source for endothelial pigmentation or atrophy -The presence of multiple uveal cysts in the posterior chamber can lead to collapse of the ciliary cleft and anterior displacement of the iris with closure of the irido-corneal angle, but secondary glaucoma is not common.\n\n\u2022 Pars plana cysts in cats and horses (Fig. 9.9) \u25a0 Cystic hyperplasia of the non-pigmented epithelium of the pars plana is a common finding in aged cats \u25a0 The cysts are filled with Alcian blue-staining hyaluronic acid, which is digested by treatment with hyaluronidase \u25a0 These cysts have no known clinical significance \u25a0 Cysts of the pars plana epithelium also occur in aged horses (see Ch. 11)\n\nC D E F secondary glaucoma, are available for histopathological evaluation \u25a0 Morphologic features of multiple irido-ciliary cysts in Golden Retrievers -Thin-walled epithelial cysts, that may be either pigmented or non-pigmented, extending across the posterior chamber \ue073 Cyst epithelium is thin, almost squamous in appearance \ue073 A PAS stain often reveals a magenta-staining basal lamina along with the epithelial cells \ue073 A cell-poor collagenous matrix may also be identified, adjacent to the cyst epithelium or attached to the lens capsule -Cyst walls or portions of cyst walls are adherent to the anterior face of the vitreous body or the equatorial lens capsule \ue073 When present on the lens capsule, the cyst epithelium often extends anteriorly, towards the anterior pole of the lens. These pigmented thin epithelial fragments are probably what is recognized as pigment adherent to the lens clinically -Posterior synechiae or iris bomb\u00e9 are frequently seen in globes removed because of secondary glaucoma -Clinically, the disease presents as uveitis with aqueous flare, and proteinaceous and cellular debris and pigment recognized in the anterior chamber. Typically there is also pigment adherent to the lens capsule, often in a radial pattern, and to the posterior cornea, hence the clinical term 'pigmentary uveitis' . The condition often affects both eyes, although disease involvement is not generally symmetrical -Histologically, the main defining characteristic of this disease is the presence of thin-walled epithelial cysts filling the posterior chamber and draped against the lens capsule and anterior face of the vitreous body. Inflammation is variable, and not consistently seen -Affected globes are often heavily pigmented and free melanin pigment in the irido-corneal angle might play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammation or glaucoma. Reduction in aqueous outflow by viscous material liberated from ruptured cysts, or simply anterior displacement of the iris by multiple cysts in the posterior chamber, could also contribute to the development of secondary glaucoma in affected dogs -It should be acknowledged that, in a pathology collection, only severely affected globes, often with -Preiridal fibrovascular membranes are commonly encountered, often with concurrent peripheral anterior synechiae -Focal retro-corneal membranes are often seen, frequently with pigment entrapment \ue073 Fragments of thin-walled cysts are seldom, if ever, recognized in the anterior chamber -Intraocular hemorrhage is often seen -Free pigment in the irido-corneal angle may play a role in the development of glaucoma, just as it might in glaucoma associated with goniodysgenesis.\n\n\u2022 Multiple irido-ciliary cysts are a characteristic finding in Rocky\n\nMountain horses with an inherited complex of congenital ocular anomalies (see Ch. 3) \u25a0 The cysts are thin-walled and translucent and are generally present in both eyes of affected horses. ciliary processes. Advanced cases can span the globe across the anterior vitreous and extend behind the lens \u25a0 Intravitreal membranes, extending from the pars plana into the body of the vitreous. Intravitreal membranes are generally associated with intraocular hemorrhage \u25a0 Intravitreal, or epiretinal membranes extending from the optic nerve head into the body of the vitreous and on the inner surface of the retina are infrequently recognized in domestic animals\n\n\u2022 In contrast to the human eye, the eyes of domestic animals seldom develop proliferative membranes directly on the retinal surface, (proliferative vitreoretinopathy or epiretinal membranes)\n\n\u2022 It is appropriate here to re-emphasize that the chambers of the eye, the anterior and posterior chamber and the vitreous body, are not luminal spaces. Rather, they are modified, cell-poor, extracellular spaces. As such, it comes as no surprise that they are easily invaded by fibrovascular membranes.\n\nFibrovascular proliferation (granulation tissue formation) is almost never seen within the uveal tissue proper.\n\n\u2022 It can therefore be assumed that there is some inhibitory process at work within the uveal tissues, preventing the formation of harmful scar tissue directly within the uveal stroma. \n\nNeoplastic membranes on the anterior surface of the iris are a prominent feature in metastatic neoplasia. See later in this chapter for further discussion of metastatic neoplasia involving the uvea.\n\nThe major congenital and developmental abnormalities of the human uveal tract are colobomas, aniridia, persistent pupillary membrane, persistence of the tunica vasculosa lentis, and iris cysts.\n\nNeovascular proliferation and tissue fibrosis in the uvea ( Fig. 9 .12)\n\nThe uvea is prone to neovascular proliferation and tissue fibrosis in circumstances which favor local production of cytokines, most prominently vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)\n\n\u2022 Conditions that are commonly associated with uveal neovascular membranes in domestic animals include: \u25a0 Uveitis \u25a0 Trauma, including intraocular surgery \u25a0 Intraocular neoplasia \u25a0 Retinal detachment and associated retinal hypoxia \u25a0 Other causes of ocular or retinal hypoxia or ischemia, including glaucoma\n\n\u2022 Common sites of uveal neovascular membrane formation are:\n\n\u25a0 Pre-iridal fibrovascular membrane (PIFVM), which is most commonly recognized on histopathology -Since there is no epithelial lining to the anterior iris surface, the new vessels and fibroblasts that constitute the fibrovascular membrane do not have to penetrate an epithelium, as would be required at other sites of fibrovascular proliferation within the eye -PIFVM is seldom mentioned as a clinical finding on pathology submission forms \ue073 In dogs, however, careful slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination by an experienced observer may be required to identify PIFVM, which is much more difficult to appreciate clinically against the darker background of the typical, brown canine iris \ue073 Clinicians may recognize the effects of PIFVM, rather than directly identifying the membrane itself, e.g. by identifying ectropion or entropion uveae, whereby the pupillary zone of the iris is distorted by the contractile effects of a PIFVM \u25a0 Posterior iridal fibrovascular membrane \u25a0 Cyclitic membrane -Fibrovascular tissue penetrates the ciliary epithelium and extends across the anterior vitreous face, incorporating the\n\nIn the human, one of the most important and intensely studied examples of neovascular proliferation is in the wet or exudative type of age-related macular degeneration. These eyes have fibrovascular tissue present between the inner and outer layers of Bruch's membrane, beneath the retinal pigment epithelium or in the subretinal space. This leads to fluid leakage giving rise to serous retinal detachments, and vessel rupture, resulting in subretinal and intraretinal hemorrhages.\n\nDistinct and separate criteria are used by the clinician and by the pathologist in the diagnosis of uveitis. Thus, in some cases, it can be difficult to reconcile clinical and pathologic diagnoses. \u2022 Lympho-plasmacytic uveitis is one of the most common causes of feline glaucoma and, in the COPLOW collection, is second only to diffuse iris melanoma as the most common cause of feline glaucoma resulting in enucleation \u25a0 Although L-P uveitis in cats is not always clinically associated with glaucoma, globes with concurrent glaucoma are overwhelmingly more likely to be submitted to COPLOW for histopathologic evaluation\n\n\u2022 Although much studied, the etiopathogenesis of L-P uveitis in cats has not yet been elucidated, with many cases being termed idiopathic \u25a0 Lympho-plasmacytic inflammation is also commonly seen in traumatized eyes, suggesting that L-P uveitis is a non-specific or cells in the aqueous humor. Protein in the aqueous humor is very difficult for the histopathologist to demonstrate\n\n\u2022 The histopathologic diagnosis of uveitis relies on the demonstration of cellular hallmarks of inflammation directly within the uveal stroma. There is no reliable way to make this determination clinically.\n\nFeline lympho-plasmacytic uveitis (L-P uveitis) ( Fig. 9. \n\nThere are 558 cases of feline lympho-plasmacytic uveitis in the COPLOW collection, 11% of feline submissions. clinical signs noted until significant secondary complications, such as cataract, glaucoma and/or phthisis bulbi become apparent\n\n\u2022 The etiopathogenesis of ERU has not been definitively established and many causes have been postulated. However, current evidence implicates Leptospiral ocular infection and auto-immunity as the important factors in the pathogenesis ERU \u25a0 Evidence to support the role of Leptospirosis in the pathogenesis of ERU includes: -Inoculation of susceptible ponies with Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona causes a syndrome of recurrent uveitis that is clinically and histopathologically indistinguishable from ERU -Some affected horses have elevated antibody titers and the titers are even higher in the aqueous -Leptospira serovars have been detected by culture and/or PCR in vitreous and aqueous, and even fixed ocular tissues of affected horses. However, this has been a very inconsistent finding in ERU cases in North America compared with ERU cases from continental Europe -While Leptospirosis may induce uveitis in horses, the recurrent nature of inflammation in ERU most-likely reflects the role of auto-immunity in its pathogenesis \u25a0 Evidence that supports a role for auto-immunity in the pathogenesis of ERU includes: -During the active phase of the disease, there are circulating or local antibodies to various ocular proteins -Leptospira organisms are not consistently detected in ocular fluids and tissues of all affected horses -Immunopathologic studies support the 'auto-aggressive' nature of the disease, demonstrating a preponderance of CD4+ T-cells and increased transcription of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 with low IL-4, that are characteristic of a Th1-like inflammatory response -A role for retinal auto-antigens, including interphotoreceptor binding protein, cellular retinaldehyde binding protein, recoverin and retinal-S antigen (arrestin), has been demonstrated in experimental models and spontaneous ERU -Immunogenetic investigations have suggested an association between ERU susceptibility and certain equine lymphocyte antigen (ELA) haplotypes -Some affected horses develop a subclinical lymphocytic inflammation in the pineal gland which shares many antigens with the retina \u2022 Distinctive morphologic features of ERU include:\n\n\u25a0 Lympho-plasmacytic uveitis, with lymphoid follicle formation in some cases. Equine recurrent uveitis and feline L-P uveitis are the two diseases in which this feature is prominent. Lymphoid follicles are otherwise a rare finding in the uveal tract \u25a0 Lymphocytes and/ or plasma cells within the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium \u25a0 Hypereosinophilic linear inclusions in the cytoplasm of non-pigmented ciliary body epithelial cells -Masson's trichrome stain facilitates the identification of these bright red-staining, intra-cytoplasmic inclusions -By electron microscopy these inclusions represent crystalline arrays of protein. At the margins of the inclusions, fragments of a double membrane are seen suggesting that the inclusions develop within mitochondria, breaking through the membrane \u25a0 Deposition of a cell-poor hyaline protein on the inner surface of the non-pigmented ciliary body epithelium feline ocular immune response that may be initiated by multiple causes \u25a0 Based on serologic studies, Toxoplasmosis and Bartonellosis have been cited as potential etiologic agents\n\n\u2022 Morphologic features of L-P uveitis in cats include:\n\n\u25a0 Lymphocytes and plasma cells in the anterior uvea -The ratio of lymphocytes to plasma cells can vary dramatically between cases -The absolute numbers of inflammatory cells can also vary dramatically between cases, and is important, neither to the diagnosis of L-P uveitis, nor to the subsequent development of secondary glaucoma \u25a0 Formation of lymphoid follicles in the iris stroma or the anterior ciliary body stroma -Although not all cases demonstrate lymphoid follicles, these are a feature that is not commonly seen in response to chronic uveitis in other species, except horses \u25a0 Lymphocytic cells within the non-pigmented epithelium of the ciliary body \u25a0 Many cases have lens luxation or subluxation -This morphologic feature needs to be assessed at the time of globe trimming \u25a0 Many cases demonstrate vitreous liquefaction -This morphologic feature also needs to be assessed at the time of globe trimming -Whereas the bulk of the vitreous body may be liquid, the anterior vitreous face often appears abnormally dense or condensed \u25a0 Changes in the anterior vitreous:\n\n-it is important to use an Alcian blue-PAS stain to evaluate the anterior vitreous -The anterior face of the vitreous often contains an excess of spindle cells and collagen -The anterior vitreous is often displaced into the posterior chamber or through the pupil, into the anterior chamber -Granular hypereosinophilic protein may be observed in the anterior vitreous, adjacent to the posterior lens capsule \ue073 Although it is not always possible to demonstrate a break in the thin, posterior lens capsule, this abnormality of the anterior vitreous that is suggestive of lens protein leakage is seen relatively frequently. In these cases, the inflammation observed may represent a lens-induced uveitis\n\n\u2022 Mechanisms of secondary glaucoma in L-P uveitis \u25a0 Many assume that secondary glaucoma is related to obliteration or occlusion of the drainage angle structures by inflammation or attendant pre-iridal fibrovascular membranes, however, lens luxation and/or anterior vitreous prolapse may also be implicated in some cases.\n\nThere are 78 cases of equine recurrent uveitis in the COPLOW collection, 20 of them in Appaloosa horses.\n\n\u2022 ERU is the most common cause of cataract, glaucoma, phthisis bulbi and blindness in horses \u2022 There is a breed predilection for the Appaloosa \u2022 It is important to be aware that not all cases of uveitis in horses are attributable to ERU\n\n\u2022 The clinical syndrome is characterized by recurrent bouts of inflammatory disease leading to progressive ocular degeneration. In some horses the disease has an insidious onset, with minimal\n\n\u2022 Other morphologic features of ERU, which are common findings but not necessarily specific, include: \u25a0 Cataract \u25a0 Retrocorneal membranes and corneal wrinkling \u25a0 Anterior and/or posterior synechiae \u25a0 Fibrovascular membranes \u25a0 Retinal detachment and/or retinal degeneration \u25a0 Optic nerve inflammation, degeneration and gliosis -Stains positive with Congo red stain, a feature of amyloid -Shows green birefringence when viewed with intense polarized light, which is also a feature of amyloid -Stains blue with Masson's trichrome, which is typical of collagen -Filaments have ultrastructural characteristics suggestive of collagen \u2022 It appears that significant posterior uveitis, characterized by pronounced chorioretinal disease and vitreous opacification, is less frequently observed in the USA than in Europe \u25a0 This may reflect differences in the ability to establish persistent intraocular infections between the predominant Leptospira isolates from ocular fluids of horses with ERU in Europe (L. kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa, strain Duyster) and North America (L. interrogans serovar Pomona).\n\nThere are 83 cases of uveodermatologic syndrome in the COPLOW collection, 23 of which are in Akitas.\n\n\u2022 This canine uveo-dermatologic syndrome is considered a model for human Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome\n\n\u2022 The Akita breed is predisposed to uveodermatologic syndrome \u2022 The human disease generally affects dark-skinned people between 20 and 50 years old and is most common in Japan. The bilateral uveitis is accompanied by pigment loss in the skin and/or hair. The human disease is strongly related to certain HLA tissue types \u25a0 Increased frequency of certain DLA class alleles has been identified in Akitas in the USA, and these alleles carry a higher relative risk for uveodermatologic syndrome \u2022 Canine uveodermatologic syndrome and human VKH are both thought to be an autoimmune disease that targets melanin or a component protein expressed in melanocytes. Tyrosinase, or tyrosinase-related proteins are considered to represent strong candidates as the target antigen. Peptides from tyrosinase related protein-1 have been used to induce experimental uveodermatologic syndrome in Akitas\n\n\u2022 Clinically the syndrome is characterized by uveitis that is generally bilaterally symmetrical and unilateral disease is rare. Retinal detachment and glaucoma are seen in many cases \u25a0 A case report describing a dog with unilateral disease provides an interesting insight into the pathogenesis. This dog had asymmetric uveal pigment dilution (heterochromia irides), the blue eye being spared the panuveitis recognized in the brown eye \u2022 Poliosis, vitiligo and alopecia are frequently recognized, with depigmentation that may be localized to the facial region, particularly to the nasal planum and lips, or may be generalized\n\n\u2022 Morphologic features of canine uveodermatologic syndrome include: \u25a0 The hallmark feature of uveodermatologic syndrome is granulomatous uveitis -Uveal inflammation is always histiocyte-rich \ue073 Some dogs have marked uveal thickening because of solid sheets of histiocytic inflammation, whereas others have no thickening and a very bland histiocytic infiltrate \ue073 Histiocytes are peppered with melanin granules \ue073 Inflammation can be more severe in any part of the uvea but the choroid is always affected \ue073 The distribution of the inflammation is highly variable but, if both eyes are available for examination, the symmetry in distribution between eyes is striking -There is a mismatch between the degree of granulomatous inflammation observed in the uvea, and the relatively 'quiet' appearance of the vitreous, aqueous, retina, and cornea -Granulomatous inflammation centered on pigmented cells is a defining feature of canine uveodermatologic syndrome \ue073 Clusters of histiocytes within the choroid and subtending the pigmented retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in a manner reminiscent of Dalen-Fuchs nodules.\n\nIn humans, these collections of epithelioid cells between the RPE and Bruch's membrane are associated with certain forms of granulomatous uveitis, including VKH and sympathetic ophthalmia -In skin biopsies from affected dogs with de-pigmentation there will be histiocytic inflammation, with melanophage cells subtending the surface epithelium -Inflammation of the meninges is common in the human disease but appears to be rare in dogs.\n\n\u2022 There are 79 cases of asymmetric uveitis in the COPLOW collection, 17 of which are in Poodles, however the records seldom report which Poodle type. Although this diagnosis is made fairly frequently in the COPLOW submissions, the condition has not been reported in the veterinary literature. \u2022 The same morphologic features will be seen in the second eye if it is submitted for evaluation, concurrently or subsequently \u2022 Aside from the characteristic features which define asymmetric uveitis, in most instances the first affected globe shows other features suggesting a penetrating injury such as lens capsule rupture, scleral defect, sepsis in the globe or a foreign body. However, evidence of a penetrating injury is not always identified and a history of trauma is seldom reported by the submitting clinician. Careful scrutiny of serial sections may be required to identify such evidence of penetrating injury or episcleral inflammation\n\n\u2022 Severe uveitis that develops in some dogs with diabetic cataract, with lens protein-associated, macrophage-rich endophthalmitis, presents a histological appearance that is very similar to asymmetric uveitis.\n\nLens-induced uveitis, phacolytic uveitis ( Fig. 9 .20)\n\nThere are 50 cases of lens-induced uveitis in the COPLOW collection. Because this phenomenon is commonly seen as part of a complex, multifaceted disease process, it is likely that the condition is significantly under-represented in our collection.\n\n\u2022 Lens-induced uveitis almost invariably accompanies mature, intumescent or hypermature cataract. Induction of an inflammatory response within the uvea is thought to occur secondary to the leakage of lens proteins through an intact lens capsule, as part of a degenerative process that also results in lens shrinkage and capsule wrinkling \u25a0 In the COPLOW collection, there are 15 cases of macrophage-rich endophthalmitis in diabetic dogs with intumescent cataract and lens capsule rupture \u25a0 Diabetic cataract often develops very rapidly in dogs, with large amounts of modified lens proteins being released into the aqueous, either passing through an intact lens capsule or after lens capsule rupture \u25a0 The morphology of macrophage-rich endophthalmitis in diabetic dogs differs from most inflammatory diseases which occur secondary to traumatic lens capsule rupture (see Ch. 5) in that the macrophage reaction is widely distributed in the eye and not centered on the lens. There are similarities, already mentioned, to asymmetric uveitis Morphologic features of ocular involvement with FIP:\n\n\u2022 Although textbook descriptions suggest that histopathology is the best way to definitively diagnose this condition, as a pathologist it is always a challenge to make this diagnosis because the features of FIP are diverse and highly variable\n\n\u2022 The COPLOW experience indicates that histopathological diagnosis of ocular FIP presents a challenge. Key to establishing a diagnosis is the recognition of the interplay of multiple different morphologic patterns, each of which adds an increment of credence to the diagnosis of ocular FIP. However, the pathologist's best effort often leads to only a tentative diagnosis of FIP.\n\n\u2022 Gross lesions \u25a0 One of the most important lesions indicative of FIP is the observation of highly proteinaceous, cell-poor exudates in the aqueous and vitreous body. The protein is fixed by formalin, or other fixative used, and is seen as a semisolid, translucent exudate filling the sectioned globe\n\nThere are 41 cases of FIP ( Fig. 9 .24) in the COPLOW collection.\n\n\u2022 Although young cats are most commonly affected, the collection includes six cases in cats over 5 years old\n\n\u2022 The prevalence is greatest in cats housed in multi-cat environments.\n\nFIP is caused by a virulent biotype of feline coronavirus and is a relatively common disease that is presently incurable, and generally considered to be fatal. Feline coronavirus infection may be limited to the gastrointestinal tract but some virulent strains acquire the ability to replicate within macrophages. In cats that do not mount an appropriate, strong, cellmediated immune response to the virus, disseminated infection can develop, leading to FIP.\n\nThree main variants of FIP are recognized, on the basis of their clinical and pathological presentation:\n\n1. Effusive, 'wet' form \u25a0 Characterized at necropsy by clear, protein rich, viscous fluid exudates in one or more body cavities and fibrinous exudates adherent to the serosal surfaces \u25a0 Ocular involvement is less common in the purely effusive form of the disease 2. Non-effusive, 'dry' form \u25a0 Characterized by pyogranulomatous inflammation in the parenchyma of the kidney, liver, lung or any of several other organs based on clinical appearance, rather than by demonstrating the presence of the organism within ocular tissues \u25a0 In humans, disseminated mycoses with ocular involvement may be encountered in immunocompromised individuals\n\n\u2022 Blastomycosis, Blastomyces dermatitidis (Figs 9.25, 9.26) \u25a0 There are 140 cases of Blastomycosis in dogs and eight cases in cats in the COPLOW collection -Blastomycosis is the most commonly reported disseminated mycotic infection in dogs \u25a0 Blastomycosis is a systemic mycotic infection, most common in the Mississippi River valley. The disease is also endemic in the Ohio and Missouri River valleys and the mid-Atlantic and southern states of the United States \u25a0 The disease occurs in very localized 'hot beds' of infection related to 'point source' exposure. Many cases live in close proximity to water courses \u25a0 The disease is considerably more prevalent in dogs than it is in humans and more prevalent in humans than it is in cats -In humans, the disease seldom affects ocular structures other than the eyelid but can be associated with endophthalmitis \u25a0 This dimorphic fungus is found in acidic soils, particularly those with decaying wood, and is infective only by inhalation of spores from infectious soil or by direct implantation into a penetrating wound. While transmission to humans from dogs is theoretically possible by this latter route, the zoonotic potential of blastomycosis is very low \u25a0 The disease in dogs:\n\n-Blastomycosis is typically a disease of young adult dogs who spend a lot of time outdoors, particularly hunting or working breeds -The primary site of infection is the lung, which is the most commonly affected, and earliest, organ to develop lesions -Other organs commonly affected include the eye, skin, lymph nodes, and bone. Any other tissue may be involved occasionally \u25a0 Morphologic features of ocular involvement in blastomycosis include: -Most commonly, a chorioretinitis is identified, that may be nodular or multifocal. Posterior segment involvement is most common, although the location of lesions in the globe or orbit is highly variable -The inflammation is pyogranulomatous in all cases, although 'classical' nodular granulomas are not typical -The diagnosis is dependent on finding the yeast form of the organism in histological sections or cytological preparations -Morphologic features of the Blastomyces dermatitidis organism in tissue include: \ue073 Exquisitely round, typically 10-15 \u00b5m diameter yeast form \ue073 One micron refractile cell wall \ue073 Broad-based, budding forms \ue073 Live organisms have an amphophilic central body and dead organisms have only an empty cell wall \ue073 Free organisms are often surrounded by Splendore-Hoeppli reaction \ue073 Histopathological findings in eyes with endophthalmitis related to blastomycosis do not appear to be significantly affected by anti-fungal treatment compared to untreated eyes, e.g. in their degree and type of inflammation and identification of budding yeast forms \n\n\u25a0 Although all of these diseases occur in humans, with the exception of histoplasmosis, ocular involvement is rare \u25a0 The 'presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome' in humans occurs most frequently in the Ohio River valley where histoplasmosis is common. However, the diagnosis is made \u25a0 Blastomycosis in cats: -The disease in cats differs only minimally from that in dogs, although it is much rarer and feline blastomycosis is more likely to involve the central nervous system than canine blastomycosis\n\n\u2022 Cryptococcosis, Cryptococcus neoformans (Figs 9.27, 9.28) \u25a0 There are 12 cases in dogs and 23 cases in cats in the COPLOW collection -Cryptococcosis is considered to be the most common disseminated mycotic infection in cats \u25a0 Cryptococcosis affects many species as a systemic yeast infection, but only dogs and cats with ocular involvement are represented in the COPLOW collection \u25a0 Immunosuppression plays a role in the establishment of disseminated infection, especially in humans \u25a0 Cats are more commonly affected than dogs but the clinical syndromes are similar in these species \u25a0 Cryptococcosis has a worldwide distribution and is acquired by the inhalation of spores from infectious soil. The infectious stage is often a contaminant in pigeon droppings \u25a0 The nasal cavity is the earliest and most likely site to become infected \u25a0 The tissues of the upper respiratory tract, CNS, lymph nodes, skin, and eyes are most commonly affected by cryptococcosis \u25a0 The definitive diagnosis of ocular cryptococcosis is dependent on identification of the organism in affected tissues or cytological preparations. Serological testing to detect cryptococcal antigen is also useful, particularly in monitoring response to therapy \u25a0 Morphologic features of ocular cryptococcosis include:\n\n-Most commonly, a multifocal, granulomatous chorioretinitis, although the infection can involve any part of the eye or orbit -Pyogranulomatous inflammation is the most frequently observed type of inflammatory reaction. However, in some cases there is minimal cellular infiltrate \ue073 The degree of inflammation appears to be inversely related to the thickness of the mucoid capsule on the infecting organism \ue073 In cases with minimal or no inflammatory cellular component, the organisms are often found in blood vessel lumina -Morphologic features of the Cryptococcus neoformans organism in tissue include: \ue073 The yeast cell body ranges from 5 to 8 \u00b5m in diameter, and stains poorly with H&E, which reveals no visible internal structure \ue073 The central yeast is surrounded by a thick polysaccharide capsule which does not stain with H&E. The capsule is between 3 and 10 \u00b5m thick \ue073 The central yeast organism stains magenta with PAS, and the mucoid capsule stains blue with Alcian blue, or bright red with mucicarmine stain \ue073 In contrast to blastomycosis, budding forms will not be found in Cryptococcosis \ue073 Very rarely, short pseudohyphae are seen.\n\n\u2022 Histoplasmosis, Histoplasma capsulatum ( Fig. 9 .29) \u25a0 There are two cases in dogs and 16 cases in cats in the COPLOW collection. However, the organism is often hard to find in cats, and there may be many more cases that go undiagnosed \u25a0 Histoplasmosis is a systemic disease, occurring worldwide, that affects many species, but only dogs and cats with ocular involvement are represented in the COPLOW collection \u25a0 The dimorphic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum exists as infective hardy spores in the soil, particularly in soil rich in bird or bat droppings \u25a0 In the USA, the disease is most common in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys \u25a0 The primary site of infection is in the lungs, following the inhalation of infective spores \u25a0 Disseminated histoplasmosis commonly affects the lungs, intestine, lymph nodes, skeleton, skin and eyes, although involvement of any part of the body may be seen \u25a0 Morphologic features of ocular histoplasmosis include:\n\n-Pyogranulomatous uveitis, although there is a highly variable distribution of inflammation in the globe or in orbital tissues -In cats there is often a thick spindle cell layer internal to the choroid as well as proliferation of the RPE. This is similar in many ways to the reaction seen in humans in the 'Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome' (Fig. 9 .30) -The diagnosis depends on demonstrating the organism within tissues, which requires PAS or a silver stain for fungus \ue073 The organism is always intracellular, within macrophage cells, and may be numerous or there may be only a few organisms. Furthermore there may be cases in which the organisms are too few to find, or nonexistent in the eye, as is often the case in humans -Morphologic features of Histoplasma capsulatum in tissue include: \ue073 The organism is small, only 3-5 \u00b5m in diameter, and is always located within macrophage cells \ue073 The organism has a 'target' appearance with H&E, but stains uniformly black with silver stains \ue073 Budding is not seen \u25a0 Immunosuppressed animals are at particular risk of disseminated infection but the disease is also seen in otherwise healthy individuals \u25a0 Many species are susceptible to infection but only dogs and cats with ocular involvement are represented in the COPLOW collection \u25a0 The disease commonly affects the lungs, bones, and eyes, however any tissue may be affected \u25a0 Morphologic features of ocular involvement include:\n\n-Pyogranulomatous inflammation in the tissues affected. In the eye, the pattern of disease is variable, although chorioretinitis is a common feature. Ocular involvement is often unilateral -Coccidioidomycosis is diagnosed by demonstration of the organism in tissue sections or cytological preparations -The organism exists in small numbers in tissues, but it is large and easily recognized -The organism is more numerous, therefore more easily identified, in cat eyes than in dog eyes -Morphologic features of Coccidioides immitis in tissues include: \ue073 The spores from the soil, upon establishing infection in the tissues, transform into large spherules ranging from 20 to 85 \u00b5m in diameter \ue073 The spherules consist of a thick, refractile, outer cell wall, containing small, 2-4 \u00b5m subunits called endospores \ue073 Budding is not seen, but the mature spherule bursts releasing numerous endospores\n\n\u2022 Canine systemic (disseminated) aspergillosis ( Fig. 9 .32) \u25a0 In cases where the eye is submitted to COPLOW, ocular disease often precedes signs of systemic illness \u25a0 There are 21 cases of canine systemic aspergillosis in the COPLOW collection and of these, nine are in German Shepherd dogs, a breed that appears to be predisposed to opportunistic fungal infections \u25a0 Affected dogs have widely disseminated infection and the diagnosis carries a poor prognosis \u25a0 Widespread vasculitis is a prominent feature of the systemic disease \u25a0 Immune deficiency, or aberrant immune response, is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of systemic aspergillosis. The disseminated disease in humans almost exclusively affects immunocompromised individuals and patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse \u25a0 Morphologic features of ocular disease in canine systemic aspergillosis include: -Panophthalmitis, often with the most severe exudate being identified, grossly and histologically in the vitreous body -Fungal organisms are most likely to be found in the vitreous body adjacent to the inner retina -Organisms are sometimes found within the lens capsule and capsular rupture may be a feature \ue073 The hyphae may be found directly within the lens capsule, which should therefore be carefully scrutinized, because the organisms are very apparent in this location, even with H&E stain. keratitis associated with aspergillus infection in avian eyes in the COPLOW collection.\n\nCanine ocular protothecosis (Prototheca zopfii or, less often, Prototheca wickerhamii) ( Fig. 9 .\n\nThere are six cases in the COPLOW collection, all in dogs.\n\n\u2022 Disseminated protothecosis occurs in dogs and is extremely rare in other species\n\n\u2022 The organism is classified as an saprophytic, achlorophyllous alga \u2022 The organism is common in contaminated water but infection is rare \u2022 Infection occurs worldwide but the South-eastern United States has a relatively high incidence \u25a0 Clinical signs depend on the tissues affected, but chronic gastro-intestinal signs are often a feature \u25a0 Ocular involvement is common in systemic disease and is usually bilateral \u25a0 Response to treatment has been discouraging in affected dogs, and the diagnosis of disseminated protothecosis carries a poor prognosis in this species\n\n\u2022 Morphologic features of ocular protothecosis \u25a0 Retinal separation, often with complete, 'morning glory' retinal detachment \u25a0 The subretinal space, vitreous, and aqueous contain a dry, granulomatous exudate but not the dense, protein-rich exudate that may be seen with many other infectious causes of endophthalmitis \u25a0 Granulomatous inflammation carpeting the outer retina and the inner choroid \u25a0 Large numbers of organisms are seen in macrophage cells and free within the tissue \u25a0 Morphologic features of Prototheca sp. in tissues -One to 10 \u00b5m, round to ovoid organisms are surrounded by a thick, refractile cell wall which stains poorly or slightly amphophilic with H&E -A few cells undergo endosporulation and may have two or many daughter cells within the cell wall -The organisms stain intensely positive with PAS stain.\n\nToxocara canis (Fig. 9. \n\nThere are five cases of ocular larva migrans in the COPLOW collection, all in dogs.\n\n\u2022 Toxocara canis was suspected to be the parasite responsible in all cases \u2022 In most cases, larva migrans in dogs affects young, working dogs, presumably because of a large parasite burden \u2022 Morphologic features of canine ocular larva migrans include: \u25a0 Mild exudates in the vitreous \u25a0 Perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate in the retina \u25a0 Localized granulomatous inflammation -It is important to search for the localized granulomas under a dissecting microscope and specifically section through the granulomatous lesions -Granulomatous lesions track in and out of the uvea, retina and vitreous -Eosinophils are rarely seen in the cases from the COPLOW collection -Larval parasites may or may not be found within the granulomata and they may also be found in tissues away from these lesions, particularly in the retina -Morphologic features of Toxocara canis larvae in tissue include prominent lateral alae and excretory columns. \n\nAs in other species, uveitis in humans is an important and complex group of diseases. A major focus of the histopathologic study of specimens with uveitis is the determination of the cause. Uveitis may result from non-infectious stimuli, such as surgical or non-surgical trauma, and endogenous agents, including tissue necrosis and reactions to allergens. Other non-infectious causes include inflammation associated with systemic diseases and predisposing genetic factors, such as HLA antigens and allergic predispositions.\n\nImportant categories of non-infectious uveitis in humans include sarcoidosis, Beh\u00e7et's disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, and phacoantigenic uveitis. A fascinating and important disease in this category that occurs only in man is sympathetic ophthalmia. This is a diffuse granulomatous inflammation of the uvea, occurring in the uninvolved eye following injury to the contralateral eye. The onset is usually a few days or weeks after a perforating injury to the exciting eye, or originally damaged eye, but there are well-documented cases of the onset being many years after the initial injury.\n\nIn infectious uveitis with a bacterial etiology, there are a number of Gram-positive organisms that have a propensity to invade the choroid from the bloodstream. Granulomatous uveitis is seen with tuberculosis, leprosy, syphilis, Pneumocystis carinii choroidopathy, nocardiosis, and Lyme disease. Major viral causes of uveitis in humans include herpes simplex and herpes zoster viruses, Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus infection, and congenital rubella syndrome. Major fungal causes of uveitis include Candida albicans infection, histoplasmosis and presumed ocular histoplasmosis, cryptococcal infection and Aspergillus infection. Causes of parasitic uveitis in humans include toxoplasmosis, toxocariasis, and onchocerciasis. \n\n\u2022 All of the clinical and morphologic features are the same as described for the Cairn Terrier, except that: \u25a0 When ocular melanosis occurs in other breeds, it is usually unilateral \u25a0 Based on limited electron microscopic studies, melanophages may be the predominant cell type in other breeds.\n\n\u2022 Age of onset and rate of progression are variable \u2022 The disease, in Cairn Terriers is usually bilateral but often not symmetrical\n\n\u25a0 An early recognizable feature is that the iris of affected dogs is very dark brown or black and has a prominent, circumferential ridge at the iris root \u25a0 Pigmented particles may be seen free-floating within the aqueous humor, deposited on the anterior lens capsule, or coating the endothelial surface of the cornea and opening to the drainage angle inferiorly \u25a0 Dark pigment patches become evident in the anterior sclera and episclera \u25a0 With progression, chronic glaucoma ensues, leading to blindness \u25a0 In some cases, progressive pigmentation in the posterior segment may be seen, obscuring the tapetum\n\n\u25a0 Diffuse over-pigmentation of the uvea -An increase in the size of pigmented cells and an increase in the number of pigmented cells -Electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry can help to distinguish if the pigmented cells are melanocytes or melanophage cells \ue073 Two distinct cell types can be identified within this population of large pigmented cells \ue073 The predominant cell type appears to be melanocytes, with different stages of melanosome development visible on electron microscopy. These cells are variably immuno-labelled using markers associated with melanocytes that include HMB45, MITF and vimentin, but not S-100 or Melan-A \ue073 A subpopulation of cells have the appearance of melanophages, with melanosomes contained within lysosomal membranes on electron microscopy. Some of these cells are positively immunolabelled by CD-18, indicating that they are indeed melanophages \u25a0 Disruption of the normal uveal contour because of excessive pigmentation and excessive accumulation of pigmented cells -This disruption is most prominent at the iris base, anterior ciliary body and limbal sclera \u25a0 Infiltration of pigmented cells in the limbal sclera and episclera is often quite pronounced, and contributes to a clinical impression of neoplasia \u25a0 Acquired staphyloma is seen occasionally \u25a0 Some affected eyes also have lympho-plasmacytic uveitis and/or PIFVM \u25a0 Melanocytoma or malignant uveal melanoma occasionally occurs in affected eyes \u25a0 Distinguishing melanosis from melanocytoma -Many pathologists consider ocular melanosis to be a diffuse variant of melanocytoma -At COPLOW, the distinct diagnosis of melanocytoma, rather than melanosis, is based on the finding of a regional mass, or a mass which is populated by a mixture of heavily pigmented round cells and heavily pigmented spindle cells. This combination is not seen in melanosis\n\n\u2022 Removal of the eye is generally carried out for the management of glaucoma or to rule out neoplasia.\n\nOcular melanocytosis occurs in humans, generally as a unilateral diffuse uveal nevus, causing heterochromia of the iris and a darkened choroid, associated with gray patches on the sclera and episclera. If the eyelid and brow are involved, the condition is known as oculodermal melanocytosis. This condition carries a risk of melanoma development in Caucasians.\n\nUveal neoplasia is an important differential consideration in animals that present clinically with intraocular masses, uveitis, intraocular hemorrhage, glaucoma or retinal detachment.\n\n\u25a0 This is a common intraocular neoplasm in dogs.\n\n-There are 1090 uveal melanocytomas in the COPLOW collection -Of these neoplasms: \ue073 94% are in the anterior uvea ( Fig. 9 .36) \ue073 6% are in the choroid ( Fig. 9 .37) \u25a0 The signalment of affected dogs may be summarized as follows: -The average age of affected dogs is 9.7 years \ue073 There is a spike in incidence in dogs under 2 years, but otherwise uveal melanocytoma is a disease of older dogs -Affected dogs by gender (where known) \ue073 Males: 169 \ue073 Neutered males: 302 \ue073 Females: 105 \ue073 Spayed females: 454 -No specific breeds are over-represented \u25a0 Frequently, melanocytoma occurs within heavily pigmented globes or those with melanosis \u25a0 Regardless of the extent of invasion, adequate removal by local resection, enucleation or exenteration, is generally curative -There are rare but notable exceptions to this generally benign biologic behavior. \ue073 In the COPLOW collection, there are three documented cases in which melanocytoma recurred in the orbit as malignant melanoma -Photocoagulation of presumed iris melanocytoma in dogs is increasingly carried out by veterinary ophthalmologists, using diode laser. Although uveal melanocytic neoplasia is generally benign in this species and this form of treatment is considered relatively non-invasive, its application in the absence of a definitive, histopathological diagnosis remains somewhat controversial. As malignant melanoma may arise in eyes with melanocytoma (see below), diligent follow-up and monitoring for signs of progression is warranted following laser therapy \u25a0 Morphologic features of canine uveal melanocytoma) include ( Fig. 9 .38): -Melanocytoma is usually made up of heavily pigmented large round cells and heavily pigmented spindle cells in variable proportions -As the tumor takes on a more and more malignant cellular profile, more spindle-shaped, less pigmented cells begin to predominate over a smaller proportion of heavily pigmented round cells -The mitotic index is a valuable means of distinguishing between melanocytoma and malignant melanoma \ue073 More than four mitotic figures per 10 high power fields is indicative of malignant melanoma (see below) but is not necessarily predictive of malignant behavior\n\n\u2022 Malignant ocular melanoma in dogs \u25a0 This is less common than benign uveal melanocytoma in dogs.\n\n-There are 334 cases of malignant ocular melanoma in the COPLOW (Figs 9.39, 9.40) \ue073 323 are in the anterior uvea \ue073 11 are in the choroid \u25a0 The signalment of affected dogs may be summarized as follows: -The average age of affected dogs is 10.3 years \ue073 In contrast to melanocytoma, there is no spike in incidence in the 0 to 2 year age group -Affected dogs by gender (where known) \ue073 Males: 37 \ue073 Neutered males: 109 \ue073 Females: 21 \ue073 Spayed females: 142 \u25a0 Frequently, malignant melanoma occurs in eyes with melanocytoma \u25a0 Even though malignant ocular melanoma is characterized by histopathological features of malignancy, few metastasize and the prognosis is therefore only slightly guarded \u25a0 Morphologic features of malignant uveal melanoma include ( Fig. 9 .41): -Malignant melanoma is usually less pigmented than melanocytoma, or is amelanotic -Anaplastic nuclear features including anisokaryosis, karyomegaly, folded nuclei, and large nucleoli are characteristic -A mitotic index greater than four mitotic figures per 10 high power fields is indicative of malignant melanoma\n\n\u2022 Feline diffuse iris melanoma (FDIM) (Figs 9.42, 9.43) \u25a0 FDIM is a common clinical presentation and pathologic diagnosis in cats -There are 1358 cases of diffuse iris melanoma in the COPLOW collection -Diffuse iris melanoma accounts for 26% of total feline submissions and 50% of feline neoplasms submitted to COPLOW \u25a0 The signalment of affected cats may be summarized as follows: -The average age of affected cats is 9.4 years old -Affected cats by gender \ue073 Males: 55 \ue073 Neutered males: 643 \ue073 Females: 65 \ue073 Spayed females: 541 \u25a0 Clinical histories indicate that FDIM begins as focal or multifocal areas of iridal pigmentation that are gradually progressive ( Fig. 9 .44) -In the earliest stage, the pigmentation is strictly confined to the iridal surface. Lesions sampled at this stage are diagnosed as iris melanosis -The extent of the pigmented lesions increases either by enlargement of individual spots, or by increase in the number of pigmented spots -The disease is designated as early FDIM when the pigment cells extend into the iridal stroma but the extent of involvement is still entirely within the iris \u25a0 The progression of disease is highly variable -Cases have been documented where the disease has slowly progressed over a 10-year period with little or no apparent effect on the health of the eye, or where FDIM has gradually led to glaucoma -Other cases progress rapidly, developing glaucoma and metastases over a short timescale ( Fig. 9 .45) -At this time, there is no good way to predict the likely progression of disease in individual cats \u25a0 This unpredictable progression makes it hard to offer advice on when to enucleate: -Some clinicians will remove a globe when they document any evidence of continued growth and progression of pigmented lesions, while others will wait until glaucoma develops -Cats with early FDIM at the time of enucleation, that generally have not yet developed glaucoma, survive at the same rate as unaffected cats -It is very difficult to accurately estimate the rate of metastatic disease in affected cats. Obtaining documented evidence of metastatic disease may be confounded by long periods of latency in many cases \ue073 Most cats with documented metastatic disease had advanced disease, i.e., Extension of the neoplasm beyond the iris and/or neoplastic cells within the scleral venous plexus, at the time of enucleation -Metastasis occurs more often to the abdominal cavity/ abdominal organs than to the lungs -Recurrence in the orbit may also occur \u25a0 FDIM demonstrates a tremendous degree of variation in cellular morphology. Within this spectrum of disease, a number of histopathological variants are recognized ( \u2022 Equine anterior uveal melanocytic neoplasms \u25a0 There are 17 cases of equine intraocular melanocytic neoplasia in the COPLOW collection \u25a0 Although dermal melanocytic neoplasia is common in horses, equine ocular melanocytic neoplasms are rare, with few reports in the veterinary literature \u25a0 Reported cases have generally shown benign histological characteristics.\n\n\u25a0 Amelanotic variants are often clinically mistaken for inflammatory disease \u25a0 Not all cases are strictly diffuse in the iris. Variations in tumor distribution occur where the neoplasm exists as solid localized masses or other cases which are primarily in the ciliary body or even the choroid \u25a0 Although uveal melanomas have been experimentally induced in cats by feline sarcoma virus infection, there is no compelling evidence to support an important role for retrovirus infection in the spontaneous development of feline anterior uveal melanoma \u2022 Feline atypical melanoma ( Fig. 9 .47) \u25a0 This is an uncommon variant of uveal melanoma in cats: -There are only 23 cases in the COPLOW collection, representing only 1% of feline neoplasms in the collection \u25a0 These are multifocal masses composed entirely of very heavily pigmented round cells, with bland small round nuclei only visible on bleached sections -The tumors are distributed throughout the uvea and may involve the iris but, in contrast to FDIM, they are not centered on the iris -A characteristic feature, seen in most cases, is the appearance of aggregates of tumor cells on the retinal pigment epithelium, filling the sub-retinal space and extending into the retina \u25a0 Despite the bland cellular features, several of these neoplasms have metastasized \n\nUveal malignant melanoma is the most common primary intraocular tumor in adult humans, with an incidence in the United States of approximately six cases per million. These occur predominantly in the choroid (85%) with about 10% in the ciliary body and 5% in the iris. Except in the iris, uveal malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive tumor, and about half of patients with this type die with metastatic disease within 10-15 years of diagnosis.\n\nIn 1931, Colonel George R. Callender at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology classified these tumors into six types, based on the morphology of the tumor cells. A modified Callender classification continues to be used for the cytologic classification of these tumors. \u2022 The major categories are spindle cell nevus; spindle cell melanoma; epithelioid melanoma; and mixed-cell type (mixture of spindle and epithelioid cells). This classification has proved less useful in tumors in other species. \u2022 Classification based on invasiveness ( Fig. 9 .50) \u25a0 Non-invasive adenoma -These tumors are entirely confined to the posterior or anterior chamber and do not invade the substance of the uvea \u25a0 Uveo-invasive adenoma -These tumors are still considered benign by morphologic criteria. Although they invade the uveal stroma they do not demonstrate scleral invasion \u25a0 Irido-ciliary adenocarcinoma -Tumors which invade the sclera are designated adenocarcinoma by virtue of their invasive behavior; 116 cases in the COPLOW collection are classified as adenocarcinoma based on these criteria -Adenocarcinoma has a more anaplastic morphologic phenotype than adenoma but is still not likely to metastasize -The more aggressive and infiltrative the tumor, the more likely the neoplastic cells are to be positively immunolabelled for cytokeratin as well as vimentin \u25a0 Pleomorphic adenocarcinoma ( Fig. 9 .51) -Very rarely, adenocarcinoma of the irido-ciliary epithelium is aggressively invasive, extending throughout the globe and infiltrating deeply into the orbit and into vascular structures -There are 10 cases in the COPLOW collection and all of them are in eyes with a history of chronic disease, diagnosed as uveitis or glaucoma -These tumors resemble the extremely rare human tumor, pleomorphic adenocarcinoma and they are likely to metastasize -Usually stain with both cytokeratin and vimentin \u2022 Morphologic features of canine irido-ciliary epithelial tumors ( Fig. 9 .52) \u25a0 Morphologic features of the epithelial cells -90% of the neoplasms are predominantly non-pigmented, although about half of the tumors have some pigmented cells -Degree of differentiation varies with biologic behavior -Morphologic variants are: \ue073 Palisading ribbons, the most common pattern \ue073 Pleomorphic solid sheets \ue073 Anaplastic \u25a0 Morphologic patterns of the extracellular matrix -60% of these neoplasms demonstrate thick, branching basal laminae, in a very distinctive pattern, which stain magenta with PAS stain in at least a portion of the tumor -The remainder have thin basal laminae which subdivide cords, clusters, or sheets of neoplastic cells \u25a0 Many exhibit extracellular hyaluronic acid secretion -This can be demonstrated by Alcian blue staining, before and after treatment of tissue sections with hyaluronidase \u25a0 Extracellular metaplastic bone is seen only rarely in canine tumors \u25a0 TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) staining increases with increasing aggressiveness of the neoplasm \u2022 Pathologic features often seen in association with canine irido-ciliary epithelial tumors include: (Fig. 9 .53) \u25a0 Pre-iridal fibrovascular membranes (PIFVM) -These can be associated with intraocular hemorrhage and/or neovascular glaucoma \u25a0 Asteroid hyalosis -27% of dogs with irido-ciliary epithelial tumors also have asteroid hyalosis.\n\n\u2022 Immunohistochemical profile:\n\n\u25a0 Vimentin positive \u25a0 Neuron specific enolase positive \u25a0 S-100 labelling is variable \u25a0 Cytokeratin labelling variable -Benign irido-ciliary adenomas are often cytokeratin negative -Overall, cytokeratin expression appears to increase with increasing aggressiveness of the neoplasm -Cytokeratin 20 expression appears to decrease with increasing aggressiveness of the neoplasm \u25a0 They seldom contain cords or ribbons of epithelial cells; rather, they are composed of solid sheets of polygonal cells which can be difficult to recognize as being epithelial \u25a0 There is a delicate but very regular vascular stroma which subtly subdivides the tumor mass into small subunits, and is made more apparent with the PAS stain \u25a0 About 30% of feline irido-ciliary adenomas have metaplastic bone within the mass \u25a0 The solid sheets of tumor tissue are often interrupted by cavitated cystic spaces. Occasionally, the tumors are predominantly cystic.\n\nFeline ocular neuroglial tumor (Fig. 9. \n\nThis is a rare but distinctive neoplasm arising in the uvea of cats. There are four cases in the COPLOW collection.\n\n\u2022 The tumor appears solid and white on observation at the time of gross sectioning \u2022 The tumor bulges inward, extending from the uveal tract\n\nThere are 103 cases of irido-ciliary epithelial tumors in cats (Figs 9.54, 9.55) in the COPLOW collection. Together, these constitute 2% of the feline submissions and 3.7% of feline ocular neoplasms.\n\n\u2022 Irido-ciliary epithelial tumors are the fourth most common intraocular neoplasm in cats, following diffuse iris melanoma, lymphoma and post-traumatic sarcoma\n\n\u2022 The signalment of affected cats may be summarized as follows: \u2022 Uveal lymphoma is the second most common intraocular neoplasm of cats \u25a0 These cases do not include the round cell variant of feline post-traumatic ocular sarcoma (FPTOS). The round cell variant of FPTOS is distinguished from feline uveal lymphoma unrelated to trauma by its wide distribution in the globe, presence of lens capsule rupture, extent of necrosis and history. This tumor, which is also a form of lymphoma, is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 5 and later in this chapter.\n\n\u2022 The average age of affected cats is 9.8 years and there is no breed predilection. The FeLV/FIV status of affected cats is not often recorded in the COPLOW archive, however, there is no reason to believe that cats with uveal lymphoma are commonly infected by either retrovirus\n\n\u2022 Approximately half of feline uveal lymphomas are seen in combination with lympho-plasmacytic uveitis: \u25a0 The relationship between lymphoma and inflammation is not clear \u25a0 Lymphoma in association with uveitis is less likely to clearly express markers of T-cell or B-cell differentiation. However, these neoplasms are just as likely to impact lifespan/survival\n\n\u2022 Based on limited follow-up information available, uveal lymphoma generally represents a systemic rather than localized disease process. However, ocular disease is frequently the presenting complaint and may precede signs of systemic involvement \u25a0 This experience suggests that chemotherapy may be warranted in cats following enucleation of a globe that appears to be affected in isolation -Larger, more complex multi-layered rosettes or tube structures lined by columnar neuroblastic cells are the defining feature of medulloepithelioma \u25a0 Although medulloepithelioma is locally invasive it is only rarely metastatic. \n\n\u2022 Tumors of the retinal pigment epithelium and the epithelium of the ciliary body and iris are uncommon in humans and, in general, parallel the description given for other species. These may take the form of adenomas or adenocarcinomas \u2022 Medulloepitheliomas (dictyomas) are congenital neuroepithelial tumors arising from primitive medullary epithelium and are usually located in the ciliary body. Although some of these tumors appear histologically malignant, most have a relatively benign course if confined to the eye \u2022 Fuchs adenomas are benign proliferations of the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium. These are usually an incidental finding at autopsy or enucleation and rarely have clinical significance.\n\nUveal lymphoma in cats ( Fig. 9. \n\nThere are 284 cases in the COPLOW collection, accounting for 5.5% of feline submissions and 10% of ocular neoplastic submissions in cats \u25a0 Ocular involvement is common in dogs with multicentric lymphoma\n\n\u2022 Ocular involvement is more likely to be bilateral in dogs than in cats, however bilateral cases are less likely to undergo enucleation\n\n\u2022 The anterior uvea is the most common tissue involved but lymphoma can also be recognized in the retina, cornea, adnexa, orbit, optic nerve head, or in peripheral nerve tissue\n\n\u2022 As is the case in cats, the ciliary body epithelium is often distorted by an infiltrate of neoplastic cells, a feature which may prove useful in making the distinction between lymphoma and melanoma, as melanoma is unlikely to specifically affect the ciliary body epithelium.\n\nIntravascular lymphoma in dogs, malignant angioendotheliomatosis ( Fig. 9. \n\nThere are six cases of intravascular lymphoma affecting the eye in the COPLOW collection, all in different breeds.\n\n\u2022 Intravascular lymphoma is a rare condition, characterized by primary neoplastic proliferation of lymphocytes within the lumen of blood vessels\n\n\u2022 The most common ocular tissue to be involved is the anterior uvea (iris and ciliary body). Uveal involvement may be nodular or diffuse. However, the retina, choroid, cornea (particularly the limbal region), adnexa, peripheral nerve tissue or optic nerve may also be affected\n\n\u2022 The ciliary body epithelium is often distorted by an infiltrate of neoplastic cells, a feature which may prove useful in making the distinction between lymphoma and melanoma, as melanoma is unlikely to specifically affect the ciliary body epithelium\n\n\u2022 Immunohistochemical labeling of leukocyte differentiation antigens and/or melanocytic markers can also help to distinguish between lymphoma and amelanotic melanoma \u25a0 There is not enough information to draw conclusions regarding the significance of immunophenotyping of feline ocular lymphoma. However, tumors of both T-cell and B-cell lineage occur.\n\nUveal lymphoma in dogs ( Fig. 9 .61) \u2022 Lymphoma is the third most common intraocular neoplasm in dogs \u25a0 There are 188 cases in the COPLOW collection, representing 1.3% of all canine submissions and 3.3% of canine neoplasms in the collection \n\n\u2022 Lymphoma of the uveal tract in humans occurs almost exclusively in association with systemic malignant lymphoma \u2022 In addition, the choroid may be involved with lymphoid proliferation, either in association with systemic lymphoproliferative disease or as a primary ocular process \u2022 It is important to distinguish inflammatory pseudotumor from lymphoma on the basis of lymphocyte typing. \u25a0 Tumors identified in pigmented uveal tissue have occurred in animals with partly blue irides or, in one case in which the tumor was located in the choroid, a pigmented iris and non-pigmented choroid\n\n\u2022 The signalment of affected dogs may be summarized as follows:\n\n\u25a0 The average age of affected dogs is 7.5 years \u25a0 In the 43 cases identified, the following breeds are over-represented: -Siberian husky (22 cases) -Catahoula hounds (four cases out of a total of 15 Catahoula hounds represented in the COPLOW collection)\n\n\u2022 Ocular neoplasia was suspected at the time of submission in less than half of the cases in which SCTBED was diagnosed \u2022 The tumor is usually located in the iris, extending into the ciliary body, but there are also cases entirely confined to the choroid \u2022 The risk of metastasis is still undetermined. However, there are examples of tumors that have recurred in the orbit or within the scleral shell, following enucleation or evisceration, respectively\n\n\u2022 Morphologic features of SCTBED include: \u25a0 These tumors lead to a poorly delineated swelling most often within the iris stroma, expanding and distorting the uveal contour \u25a0 The neoplastic cells are spindle cells but they are highly variable in cellular morphology and cellular organization -Individual cells range from small, slender spindle cells, devoid of anaplastic features, to large plump cells which exhibit karyomegaly and may be profoundly anaplastic -The cellular organization may be consistent with that seen in peripheral nerve sheath tumors (Antoni A and Antoni B patterns) \u25a0 Immunohistochemistry of SCTBED -Vimentin positive, suggesting mesenchymal origin -S-100 positive, suggesting a neural crest origin -GFAP positive in most cases \ue073 Although considered a marker of astrocytes of the central nervous system, Schwann cells of nonmyelinated nerves are also positively labeled for GFAP. For that reason the GFAP-positive immunolabelling of the majority of SCTBED cases provides strong evidence for a Schwann cell origin of this neoplasm \ue073 GFAP immunohistochemistry in unaffected, normal canine blue irides demonstrates a plexus of GFAPpositive fibers in the anterior iris and, to a lesser extent in other areas of the uvea, when compared with normal, pigmented iris tissue Metastasis may occur by the following mechanisms:\n\n\u2022 Extension into the orbit leading to local recurrence \u2022 Extension along the optic nerve or peripheral nerves to the brain \u2022 Hematogenous metastasis \u2022 Rarely, metastasis to lymph nodes.\n\n\u2022 Metastatic pattern in dogs (Figs 9.68, 9.69) \u25a0 Exclusive of lymphoma, there are 223 cases of metastatic neoplasia in canine eyes in the COPLOW collection, accounting for 3.9% of all canine tumors submitted in the COPLOW collection \u25a0 Neoplasms that often metastasize to the eye include histiocytic sarcoma, melanoma, hemangiosarcoma, osteosarcoma, mammary adenocarcinoma, as well as many others \u25a0 Common morphologic features of metastatic neoplasia in the canine eye include: -Metastases may be present in one globe but recurrent tumor in the second globe is common -A tendency to affect the anterior uvea more than the choroid -Neoplastic cells are often identifiable in blood vessels -Neoplastic cells 'break out' from the uveal stroma and 'line' the anterior or posterior chambers -Melan A is usually, but not always negative indicating that the neoplasm is unlikely to be of melanocyte origin, which rules out spindle cell amelanotic melanoma \u25a0 There is a solitary, published report of a peripheral nerve sheath tumor with similar morphology in the eye of a dog, but in that report the uvea was pigmented.\n\nFeline post-traumatic ocular sarcoma (FPTOS) (see Ch. 5 for detailed discussion of this neoplasm) ( Fig. 9 .67)\n\nThere are 234 cases in the COPLOW collection, making it the third most common intraocular tumor in cats. There are three morphologic variants of FPTOS:\n\n1. The spindle cell variant is most common (70% of FPTOS) \u25a0 The spindle cell variant is thought to originate from lens epithelial cells \u25a0 Extension beyond the sclera is a poor prognostic sign 2. The round cell variant (24% of FPTOS) (also discussed later in this chapter) \u25a0 The round cell variant is thought to be a lymphoma \u25a0 Phenotyping the round cell variant FPTOS has proven to be difficult 3. Post-traumatic osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma (6% of FPTOS) On average, there is a 7-year latency between a traumatic event with lens capsule rupture and the diagnosis of FPTOS. -A pattern of choroidal infarction is often seen, with characteristic, wedge-shaped areas of tapetal discoloration and profound vascular attenuation visible on funduscopy -Orbital involvement may accompany involvement of the posterior segment of the globe -Ocular metastases may be diagnosed in cats with many forms of malignant neoplasia; with pulmonary carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of undetermined origin, and fibrosarcoma being seen most commonly.\n\n-In some cases, thorough evaluation fails to reveal a primary neoplasm and diagnosis of a rare primary ocular malignant neoplasm, such as extraskeletal osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma, may be made.\n\n\u2022 Metastatic pattern in cats (Figs 9.70, 9.71) \u25a0 Exclusive of lymphoma, there are 101 cases of metastatic neoplasia in feline eyes in the COPLOW collection, accounting for 3.7% of all feline COPLOW submissions with neoplasia \u25a0 Common morphologic features of metastatic neoplasia in cat eyes include: -Uveal metastases may be recognized in one or both globes -A tendency to affect the choroid more often than the anterior uvea -When the anterior uvea is affected by metastatic epithelial tumors, the neoplastic cells form a 'lining' attached to the inner surface of the iris and ciliary body -There is often extensive and widespread invasion of blood vessels \n\nvan der Woerdt, A., Nasisse, M.P., Davidson MG, 1992 .
