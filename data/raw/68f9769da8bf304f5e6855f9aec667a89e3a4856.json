{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Experience of different upper respiratory tract sampling strategies for detection of COVID-19 Experience of different upper respiratory tract sampling strategies for detection of COVID-19", "body": "COVID-19 is spreading rapidly around the world 1 . At present, the diagnosis of COVID-19 mainly depends on real-time RT-PCR assay of throat swabs 2 . However, the false negative rate of nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 with throat swabs is high, and throat swabs are uncomfortable for patients, and may induce coughing. The lingual swab is convenient and may achieve the same effect. This study compares the differences between lingual swab and throat swab sampling results, and analyzes whether standardized sampling by the same nurse could improve the detection rate compared with sampling by several nurses.\n\nTo analyze the positive rates of throat swabs and lingual swabs to detect COVID-19, we conducted a cohort study of two groups of suspected patients at two COVID-19 fixed-point hospitals (Wuhan No.7 Hospital and Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University). Zhongnan Hospital is one of the largest hospitals in the area, and has admitted a large number of COVID-19 patients 3, 4 . Two groups of consented patients were sampled using both sampling methods; all swabs were tested using a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe first group contained 46 patients, who were from fever clinic of Wuhan No.7\n\nHospital (a COVID-19 fixed-point hospital). This group of patients was sampled by the same experienced, who used a standardized sampling method. Of these patients, (Table 1 ).\n\nIn total, of these 91 patients, the positive rate of throat swabs (44.0%) was higher than that of lingual swabs (36.3%), but this difference may have been attributable to a single exoerienced nurse collecting all of the samples in the first group (54.3% VS 36.9%). This suggests that highly trained or experienced nurses may improve the diagnostic sensitivity with throat swabs. Table) .\n\nIn conclusion, the positive rate of throat swabs is higher than that of lingual swabs for the detection of COVID-19; however, in our small study this difference was only seen when swabs were collected by a single experienced nurse. When multiple nurses took samples, throat swabs had no obvious advantage over lingual swabs, and diagnostic sensitivity was improved by collection of samples from both sites. We believe that these observations should be of value to other centres establishing COVID-19 diagnostic programmes. "}
