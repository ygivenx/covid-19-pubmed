{"title": "Archives of Virology Comparison of the Morpholofy of Three Coronaviruses", "body": "Coronaviruses are a group of lipid-contMning RNA viruses that have a unique morphology (15, 22) . The virions are usually described as being large pleomorphic spherical particles with characteristic bulbous, wideLy-spaced surface projections that form a corona around the particles (15) . The virus envelope contains lipid and appeaxs to consist of a distinct pair of electron dense shells (15) and a singlestranded helical internal component that has been identified as ribonueleoprotein (10). At present, coronaviruses are classified almost entirely by means of their characteristic morphology, and although preliminary biochemical and serological criteria are now available for some coronaviruses (22) , the relative difficulty in isolating and growing some of these viruses in cell culture for biochemical analysis means that for some time it wilt be necessary to classify many coronaviruses entirely by their morphological features.\n\nMeasurements of the sizes oi various coronavirus species by different investigators using negative staining have revealed a large range in total diameters 0304-8608/79/0059/0025/$ 01.80 of between 50 and 220 nm, with average total diameters ranging from 75 to 160 nm (15) . Furthermore, the bulbous surface projections vary in shape and size, with lengths of between i2 and 24 nm (15) . Few measurements of the width of these projections have been made. In some cases, long, thin, rod-like sui~face projections of length approximately 20 nm have been observed that bear little if any resemblance to 'typical' coronavirus projections (I, 3, 4, 16) . Sometimes spherical dilations or T-shaped structures were observed at the distal end of these projections.\n\nAs no previous comparative studies have been made on the detailed structure of different coronaviruses, we have analysed the morphology by negative staining of three coronaviruses: avian infectious bronchitis virus strain Connecticut (IBV Conn), human coronavirus strain 229E (HCV 229E) and mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 (MI-IV3). The results we have obtained are of importance in the morphological classification of eoronaviruses.\n\nIBV strain Connecticut (IBV46) was grown in 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs incubated at 37 \u00b0 C for 24 hours as previously described (Ii). I-ICV229E was grown in monelaycr cultures of embryo hmg cells of the MIRC continuous line at 33 \u00b0C for 32 hours in Eagles' BME with 2 per cent new born calf serum (13) . MI-IV3 was grown in confluent secondary mouse embryonic fibroblasts at 37 \u00b0 C for 72 hours in Eagles' MEM with 2 per cent foetal calf serum (10). Cell cultures containing HCV229E and MI-IV 3 particles were frozen and thawed three times and then purified.\n\nAll t h e purification steps were p e r f o r m e d at 0 \u00b0 to 4 \u00b0 C. The virus suspension was clarified at 2000 \u00d7 g for 30 minutes, pelleted at 75,000 \u00d7 g for I hour a n d t h e n resuspended in i ml Dulbeeeo's p h o s p h a t e buffered saline 'A' (PBSA). The r e s u s p e n d e d virus was overlaid on to a linear 25 to 55 per ce:r~t (w/w) sucrose g r a d i e n t in P B S A a n d centrifuged for t6 hours at 90,000 \u00d7 g. The virus peak at 1.18 g/rot was collected, diluted in P B S A a n d again layered o n t o a linear 25 to 55 per c e n t (w/w) sucrose g r a d i e n t in P B S A a n d centrifuged for 16 hours at 90,000\u00d7g. P e a k fractions at 1.18 g/ml were e x a m i n e d b y electron microscopy.\n\nOne aliquot of each virus sample was n e g a t i v e l y stained w i t h 2 per cent (w/v) potassium phosphotungstate pll 6.5 and a second with 0.5 per cent (w/v) uranyl acetate, pll 4.4, and examined in a Philips EM 300 electron microscope. Three features of coronavirus morphology were examined, namely, the envelope diameter (excluding surface projections) and the length and width of the surface projections. Approximately 50 envelope diameters of each virus species were measured. In each case two measurements of diameter were taken and the average value was used in subsequent calculations. For elliptical shaped virus particles, one measurement was taken across the long axis and the other across the short axis (18) . Between 50 and 100 measurements of surface projection lengths and widths were made for each virus species. Lengths were measured from the boundary of the virus envelopes to the distal end of the projections and widths were measured at the widest parts of the projections. An analysis of variance was performed on tile measurements for each feature, using each staining method, to determine whether the gleans for the three viruses differed significantly. \n\nPurified coronavirus particles of density 1.18 g/ml from sucrose gradients were examined in this study as only these particles comprised complete infectious particles (MAc~A~GItTON, manuscript in preparation). Nevertheless, the morphology of virus particles of other densities was similar to that of the complete particles. Figure 1 shows electron micrographs of IBV Conn, HCV 229E and MHV3 examined by negative staining with potassium phosphotungstate (KPT) and uranyl acetate (UA). Typical, more or less spherical eoronavirus particles were observed with almost complete coronas of surface projections. The particles remained intact with both negative stains as judged by the exclusion of stain from them. Table 1 summarises the results of measurements of envelope diameters of IBV Corm, HCV 229E and MHV3 using purified virus preparations, negatively stained with K P T or UA. For each stain IBV Corm was highly significantly greater than the other two (p <0.001), while the other two were less, but still significantly, different from each other. IBV Corm and MHV3 showed no significant difference as between one stain and the other, but ItCV 229E had a highly significantly greater diameter (p<0.001) when stained with UA than when stained with KPT. With K P T staining MItV3 had a larger average diameter then HCV 229E (p = 0.001), while the reverse was true for UA staining (0.005 > p >0.001). a Negative staining with 2 per cent potassium phosphotungstate, pH 6.5 b Negative staining with 0.5 per cent uranyl acetate, pH 4.1 Figure 2 shows histograms of the envelope diameters of the three eoronaviruses stained with KPT. Most HCV 229E and MHV3 particles had envelope diameters showing little spread around the mean values. However, there was a wider spread in the diameters of IBV Corm enveIopes. The diameters of UA stained virus envelopes were distributed as in Figure 2 (not shown), except for HCV 229E (Table 1) .\n\nThree types of surface projections were found. Those of IBV Conn (Fig. l a  and b) and HCV 229E (Figs. l c and d) were bulbous or 'tear-drop' shaped and were widely spaced on the virus envelope. However, those of M H V 3 (Figs. l e and f) were 'cone-shaped' with the thicker, flat p a r t at the distal end. T h e y were spaced closely together on the virus envelope though not as m a n y particles exhibited complete coronas as I B V Conn and HCV 229E. I n spite of this difference in shape, the vMues of length shown in Table 2 were not found to be significantly different from each other when K P T staining was used. Itowever, with U A staining, the three types were highly significantly different from each other (p<0.001), and all three were considerably shortened compared with their K P T values (p<0.001 in each case).\n\nConn and I-ICV 229E respectively, determined from KPT stained preparations. It is of interest to note that the lengths of the projections of IBV Conn show a much greater spread in values than HCV 229E, but this difference in spread is not sufficient to invalidate the analysis of variance. The spread of lengths of projections of IBV Conn in UA stained preparations was similar to that obtained using KPT but HCV 229E and MHV3 had a wider spread with UA than with KPT (not sho~vn). In one preparation of HCV 229E, projections were observed that were not consistent with the above description. A small percentage of particles in this preparation had projections that were thinner than the 'tear-drop' morphology, being 17 to 24 nm long and 3.9 to 5.6 nm wide. Projections of this type were not seen in preparations of IBV Conn. The spread was similar to that determined from UA treated preparations (not shown) and to K P T treated HCV 229E preparations (Fig. 3b) . ~n three preparations of MHV3, negatively stained with KPT a small percentage of the surface projections did not have the 'cone-shaped' morphology.\n\nThese were bulbous in shape, 7.5 to 14 nm long and 6 to 11 nm wide. Table 3 shows the widths of the surface projections. Here the main difference lies in the 1VIHV3 values being smaller than the others, while the I~BV Conn values were a little greater than the HCV 229E values, and for each virus species tho values using UA were rather greater than those using K P T (p <0.001 in every case). a Negative staining with 2 per cent potassium phosphotungstate, pH 6.5 b Negative staining with 0.5 per cent uranyl acetate, pH 4.4\n\nVirus particles were also examined from partially purified samples in order to see if our purification procedure had had any effect on the virus morphology. Unfortunately, too few particles were present in crude clarified preparations to enable an accurate study to be made of them. However, pelleted virus preparations, before sucrose density gradient centrifugation, had sufficient virus particles present for analysis, although many of them were at least partially obscured by cell debris in MHV3 preparations. Essentially no difference was observed in the morphology of the three coronavirus species between partially purified pelleted and purified virus particles, suggesting that our purification procedure has little effect on virus morphology.\n\nThe sizes of coronaviruses reported in the literature (15) vary widely, but it has not been clear how much of the variation was due to different methods of preparation, purification and negative staining, and whether different coronavirus species really do vary in size. Our results show that IBV Conn particles are much larger than those of HCV 229E and MHV3, and these may reflect significant molecular differences in their structures. In this respect it is interesting to note that the polypeptide compositions of IBV particles (t 1, i4) show significant differences from the polypeptide compositions of HCV (5, 6, 9) and MHV (9, 19, 20) , although the RNA genomes of IBV (8, 12, 17) and HCV (13, 21) show close similarities.\n\nMost reports on coronavirus morphology, summarised by McINTos~ (I5), have suggested that eoronavirus particles have only one type of surface projection, the typical bulbous or 'tear-drop' shaped projection. However, a few reports (1, 3, 4, 16) have indicated the existence of another type of surface projection that is rod-shaped and sometimes has a spherical dilation or T-shaped structure at the distal end. Apparently, IBV (2, 3, 4) and haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (16) It is difficult to understand why the morphology of the surface projections is different. The differences cannot be attributed to staining procedures as identical methods were used for all three coronaviruses. The widely spaced typical bulbous coronavirus projections of IBV Conn and HCV 229E may reflect aggregations of the thinner, cone-shaped, MHV3-1ike projections which are more closely packed. This would explain how we have occasionally observed surface projections of different morphology in HCV 229E and MHV3 preparations. Similarly, it would clarify previous reports that have shown certain coronavirus preparations to contain atypical surface projections. However, the different surface projections may be made up of similar glycopolypeptides that are arranged slightly differently, producing a different morphology, but exhibiting similar biological functions. I t has been shown that staining virus particles with UA can vary the morphology of the projections of all three eoronavirus species and the envelope diameters of HCV 229E and MHV3. However, the action of UA as a negative stain is not understood. One suggestion is that UA is acidic and its reaction with polypeptides may depend on their isoelectrie points (7) .\n\nIt is important to determine how great is the morphological variation exhibited by coronavirus species and to establish whether such differences can be related to their biochemical structures. In this way it should be possible to establish whether such variations are significant and whether the eoronavirus group should be subdivided."}
