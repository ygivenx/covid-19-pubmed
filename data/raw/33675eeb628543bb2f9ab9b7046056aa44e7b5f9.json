{"title": "", "body": "The outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease has led to the current global health crisis. As of late March, there have been over 315,000 cases worldwide and over 25,000 cases in the United States. 1 COVID-19 has been of concern to many health care workers (HCW's) in the emergency department (ED), due to potential exposure and the possibility of transmitting the virus to other patients and family members. Currently, personal protection equipment (PPE) recommendations are in flux and it is unclear if patients outside of -flu-like symptoms\u2016 require PPE. 2 Furthermore, as increasing asymptomatic and atypical presentations develop, clear guidance is needed for HCW's. In China, asymptomatic and atypical presentations with gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported, 3 and it has been suggested that up to 10% of COVID-19 patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms. However, due to limited data and an unknown true disease prevalence, it is unclear what percentage of patients present atypically without respiratory symptoms. 4 In addition, a study showed that up to 18% of patients had no radiographic or CT abnormality. 5 As studies continue to demonstrate more patients who present asymptomatically or atypically, our need for increased guidance on PPE grows. We present a case report of a man who was referred to the ED for abdominal and testicular pain who was subsequently found to test positive for COVID-19."}
