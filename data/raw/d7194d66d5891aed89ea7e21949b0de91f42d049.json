{"title": "", "body": "In their Correspondence, David Baud and colleagues 1 suggest that case fatality rates (CFRs) for coronavirus disease 2019 have been underestimated and propose to divide deaths at time t by cases at time t minus 14 days to correct this underestimation and provide so-called real estimates. Many biases in both directions afflict CFR estimates during outbreaks, 2 and experts have spent 2 decades (since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) finding ways to overcome these. 3 The delay problem highlighted by Baud and colleagues produces falsely low estimates, whereas the underascertainment of mild cases produces falsely high estimates. 4 These issues are well appreciated in the field and have been discussed in the popular press in recent weeks. 5, 6 No expert thinks the 3\u00b76% raw ratio of deaths to cases on March 1 is an accurate estimate of the CFR because it suffers from all of these biases. The authors make the situation worse: correcting for delay (with an invalid method) without correcting for ascertainment of mild cases inflates the estimates, bringing them further from what most experts believe are the true numbers, around the 1-2% range for symptomatic cases. 7, 8 Baud and colleagues' estimates are not real; they are in fact less real than the biased calculations they claim to correct. Especially in a time of great urgency, authors have a responsibility to read and understand relevant background literature and look for obvious flaws in their own analysis. This work does not appear to have met that standard. The fact that peer review did not pick up these flaws should be a caution against hastening the peer review process at the expense of due care.
