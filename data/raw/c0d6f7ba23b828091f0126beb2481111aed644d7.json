Its causative agent (TGEV) belongs to the Coronaviridae, a family of enveloped viruses with a large, single-stranded RNA of *To whom reprint requests should be addressed. 0378-1135/90/$03.50 positive polarity as a genome. The virions are constructed from three major structural proteins: a phosphoprotein (N), which encapsidates the genomic RNA, an integral membrane protein (M or E 1 ) and a large glycoprotein (S or E2), which forms the viral projections (review: Spaan et al., 1988 ) .\n\nIn spite of its economic importance, TGEV has been one of the least studied coronaviruses, as compared to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which have been the objects of sustained research. Up to 1980, only limited information was available on the polypeptide constitution and the genome characteristics of TGEV (Garwes et al., 1976; Brian et al., 1980) . During the last few years there has been a substantial accumulation of experimental molecular data. The scope of this paper is to review briefly current information about the organisation of the TGEV genome and the functions associated with the structural domains of the envelope glycoproteins. GENOME STRUCTURE Partial sequence analysis of cloned virion RNA and characterisation of virus-specific intracellular RNAs have led to a proposed model for TGEV genome organisation and expression which is depicted in Fig. 1 . The sequence of the 3'-most 8300 nucleotides of the genomic RNA of Purdue-115 cell-adapted strain has been determined; it encompasses the whole part of the genome which is expressed through subgenomic RNAs . The remaining part, of the genome (approximately 20 kilobases long), is thought to encode the viral replicase/transcriptase, as shown in the case of IBV (Boursnell et al., 1987 ) . The three largest genes sequenced, encoding the structural proteins, are oriented according to the consensus gene order of coronaviruses: 5'-E2-E l-N-3'. Four additional major open reading frames (ORFs), poten- tially coding for non-structural polypeptides, can be deduced from available sequence data. The number and distribution of the latter differ from that of both MHV and IBV.\n\nOverall, the identified coding regions ofTGEV genome are densely packed, yet there are almost no overlaps. Most of the intergenic region consists of 0-15 bases. The largest non-coding region, located upstream from the 3'-most gene (N), is about 280 nucleotides long exclusive of the polyA stretch (Kapke and Brian, 1986; .\n\nExpression of coronavirus genomic information involves the synthesis of a negative strand which in turn serves as a template for the production of one genome-sized and several subgenomic RNA species (review: Spaan et al., 1988 ) . Six subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized in non equimolar amounts in TGEV-infected cells (Jacobs et al., 1986; . They form, together with the full-length genome RNA, a 3' coterminal nested set, a distinctive feature of coronaviridae. The synthesis of these molecules has been demonstrated to occur through a discontinuous transcription process, in which a short leader sequence ( ~ 70 bases) is joined to the body of each RNA (review: Lai, 1986) . The nucleotide composition of the leader sequence remains to be determined in the case of TGEV. A consensus sequence 5 'AACUAAAC3', found in each intergenic region of TGEV, is assumed to act as a transcription-initiation signal for the leader-polymerase complex. The translationally active part of each mRNA corresponds to the segment which is not redundant with smaller species. Except for mRNA 3, all TGEV subgenomic RNAs appear to be functionally monocistronic.\n\nCharacterisation of the non-structural polypeptides of TGEV is incomplete, and most of the available information comes from the sequence data. The translation of four polypeptides is potentially allowed by mRNA 3,4 and 7 . Two usable reading frames have been identified on mRNA 3: X2a (71 codons) and X2b (254 codons). In vitro translation of mRNA 3 gave rise to a 24 kDa polypeptide (Jacobs et al., 1986 ) , presumably encoded by X2b. A highly hydrophobic polypeptide of 9 kDa has been predicted from ORF X 1 present on mRNA 4 . None of the above species has been characterised as yet in TGEV-infected cells. However, a 14 kDa polypeptide has been shown to be expressed (Wesley and Woods, 1986) , which reacted with an antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the ORF X3 found on mRNA 7 (Garwes et al., 1988) . As for other coronaviruses, the biological role of these non-structural polypeptides remains to be elucidated.\n\nH. LAUDE ETAL.\n\nThe glycoprotein E2 forms the typical petal-shaped, 20 nm long peplomers projecting outward from the virion's surface. In addition to its probable role in determining the host cell tropism, E2 is assumed to have a membrane fusion activity which enables the viral nucleoprotein to enter the cytoplasm. Also, E2 bears major B lymphocyte antigenic determinants Jimenez et al., 1986) which are likely to play a crucial role in promoting the adaptive immunity. In particular, W2 is the sole structural protein capable of eliciting the production of neutralising antibodies, which are able to confer protection to sucking piglets (Garwes et al., 1979 ) .\n\nE2 is initially synthesized as a molecule of 1447 residues , significantly larger than the IBV and MHV peplomer protein.\n\nAfter cleavage of a short hydrophobic sequence acting as a secretory signal peptide, the polypeptide chain is 1431 residues long, with a predicted Mw of 158 kDa. Mannose-rich carbohydrate side-chains are cotranslationally added to most of the 32 potential Asn-linked glycosylation sites present on the apoprotein, thus giving the intracellular species designated E'2 (Mw: 175 kDa). After an additional glycosylation step within the Golgi apparatus (Delmas and Laude, unpublished results) , the mature protein (220 kDa) is incorporated into the virions.\n\nAnalysis of the primary sequence of TGEV E2 has led to the identification of several functional domains (Fig. 2 ) . Near the C-terminus, a hydrophobic segment of about 20 residues is assumed to anchor the protein into the lipid membrane. The internal domain, about 35 residues long, is divided into 2 parts: a stretch with a high ratio of cysteine residues (50%), which are putative fatty acylation sites, and a hydrophilic stretch, likely protruding inside the virions. The ectodomain thus forms the essential part of the protein. At 1/4-1/5 from the carboxy-end, an amphipatic alpha helix 8 nm long is pre- dicted, which is thought to be responsible for the association of 2 or 3 E2 subunits through a coiled-coil interaction, as shown for the influenza HA protein. Such a structure may explain the elongated shape of the peplomer's stem . Approximately at the middle of the polypeptide chain a sequence DRTRG might correspond to a vestigial site of cleavage, whereas a functional cleavage sequence gives rise to a heterodimer peplomer protein in IBV and MHV. The amino half of E2 molecule has an overall hydrophobic profile, which reflects the existence of a tightly packed core in the globular part of the peplomer.\n\nFour main antigenic sites, designated A, B, C and D, have been delineated on the TGEV E2 protein by means of competition assay using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the Purdue strain (Delmas et al., 1986 ) . Most of the critical neutralisation determinants are clustered in a discrete area comprising the two topologically related sites A and B. Whereas the A, B and D sites are highly conserved among TGEV strains from different origins, the C site exhibits slight variation. Prokaryotic expression of E2 gene fragments allowed the characterisation of the latter as a continuous epitope of 10 residues. Controlled proteolytic digestion of E2 has been shown to generate two reactive fragments of 26 kDa and 14 kDa recognised by site A-B and D MAbs, respectively. Partial amino acid sequencing permitted the localisation of these fragments in two distinct regions of the E2 primary structure (Delmaset al., 1990) . Furthermore, amino acid substitutions capable of conferring neutralisation resistance were identified in each region by direct RNA sequencing of the genome of site A or D antigenic mutants (Laude et al., unpublished results) . All four antigenic sites appeared to be located in the amino-half part of E2 (Fig. 2 ) .\n\nAnalysis of the antigenic profile of a newly recognised porcine respiratory coronavirus, closely related to TGEV (Pensaert et al., 1986) , has revealed important epitope changes within the site D, but non in the A-B domain, a situation similar to that shown for the feline FIPV and canine CCV (Laude et al., 1988b) , two other members of coronavirus antigenic group I. This observation is consistant with the fact that the site D lies in the last 250 Nterminal residues of E2, i.e. the region which is the most divergent between TGEV and FIPV (Jacobs et al., 1987) . Hence, it can be speculated that determinants important in modulating the virus tropism might reside in this domain of E2. Different approaches are currently being used in the laboratory to address this question.\n\nMostly embedded within the lipid envelope, the glycoprotein E1 is assumed to play an essential role in virion architecture. Moreover, the restriction of E 1 to endoplasmic reticulum membranes has been shown to determine the assembly site of the coronavirus particles. Sequence data of the TGEV E 1 gene predict a primary translation product of 262 residues. In contrast to both IBV and MHV, the translocation of TGEV E1 into the membrane appears to take place through the cleavage of a 17 residue N-terminal signal peptide . The mature E1 protein, of Mw 29 kDa, carries a unique mannose-rich Asn-linked side-chain; minor species of E 1 (up to 36 kDa) have more complex glycans (Delmas and Laude, unpublished results) .\n\nInspection of TGEV E 1 amino acid sequence reveals several well-defined structural domains . At the N-terminus, a highly hydrophilic stretch of about 40 residues containing the glycosylation site, constitutes the ectodomain of the protein. The latter is significantly larger and, due to the presence of four cysteine residues, potentially more complex in its secondary structure than the exposed domain in IBV and MHV. It is followed by three hydrophobic, membrane-spanning segments. The remaining half of the polypeptide comprises an amphiphilic region presumably associated with the inner part of the membrane, and an hydrophilic C-terminus. The above findings indicate that the topology of TGEV E 1 within the membrane should be essentially similar to that previously proposed for MHV and IBV (Rottier et al., 1986 ).\n\nInactivated TGEV particles or glutaraldehyde-fixed infected cells have been shown to trigger an early and strong synthesis of alpha-type interferon (IFN) in non-immune porcine or human peripheral blood lymphocytes. This activity appeared to be blocked by two of four MAbs directed against glycoprotein E 1, whereas MAbs specific for the other structural proteins were not effective in blocking the interferon induction . A series of epitope mutants were selected on the basis of their resistance to complementmediated neutralisation towards the IFN-induction blocking MAbs. All the relevant amino acid substitutions identified by sequencing of mutant E 1 genes were localised within the last 22 N-terminal residues. Strikingly, two mutations were shown to markedly affect the IFN-inducing capacity (Laude et al., 1988a and unpublished results ) .\n\nThese findings provide strong evidence for the role of El as the effector and indicate that the interferogenic domain must be located within the ectodomain of the protein. It is tempting to postulate that the interaction of E 1 with the lymphocyte membrane is the first of the events leading to the induction of IFN-coding genes. This newly recognised biological function of E 1 may explain the high titre of circulating IFN observed in TGEV-infected piglets. It is likely that too little attention has been paid to such an alternate pathway of alpha IFN-induction by non-replicating viral structures.\n\nMolecular studies of the highly enteropathogenic virus, TGEV, have produced relevant information. While increasing the knowledge of coronaviruses, these data have revealed some features that are unique to TGEV. Moreover, further development of these studies should have an important impact in several domains. Thus, the availability of cDNA copies of the genes coding for surface antigens provide the opportunity to analyse in more detail the mechanisms of protective immunity in TGEV infection and to design new generation vaccines. Elucidation of the molecular basis ofpathogenesis would also be a fascinating area for future research."}
