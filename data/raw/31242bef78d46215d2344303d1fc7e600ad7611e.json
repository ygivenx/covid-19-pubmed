{"title": "", "body": "\u2022 There are four recognized pathophysiologic mechanisms of diarrhea include osmotic, secretory, increased permeability and altered motility.\n\nSmall bowel diarrhea is characterized by:\n\n\u2022 Loose to watery feces.\n\n\u2022 Increased volume of feces.\n\n\u2022 Normal to increased frequency of defecation.\n\n\u2022 No straining or tenesmus associated with defecation.\n\n\u2022 If blood is present in feces it occurs as melena.\n\n\u2022 Increased mucus is not present in the feces.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss and vomiting are commonly observed concurrently.\n\n\u2022 Small intestinal tract (duodenum, jejunum and ileum).\n\n\u2022 Mild, acute small bowel diarrhea is a common problem that may be caused by a variety of selflimiting factors, including dietary, infectious, parasitic or toxic agents. However, severe small bowel diarrhea may be life-threatening and associated with severe systemic or GI disease. Some diseases typically produce chronic diarrhea, but in the early stages are perceived as producing acute diarrhea. Diarrhea commonly occurs either due to motility disturbances or irritating effects of the foreign object that may cause increased secretion.\n\n\u2022 Intussusception* (p 712)\n\nAcute onset of diarrhea may occur due to alterations in gut motility, however, vomiting is a more prominent clinical sign.\n\n\u2022 Motility disturbances Primary motility disturbances are rare, but secondary causes of abnormal GI motility such as postoperative ileus, post-obstructive disease or metabolic or endocrine causes of ileus are more important causes of diarrhea.\n\n\u2022 Short bowel syndrome (p 730)\n\nSpontaneous short bowel syndrome occurs acutely with intussusception, bowel strangulation and intestinal volvulus. Iatrogenic syndrome associated with resection of 75-90% of the small intestine results in severe diarrhea and weight loss. Congenital forms of short bowel syndrome are reported, but are rare.\n\nIntermittent diarrhea, vomiting or voluminous stools in an older cat with a good to ravenous appetite, obvious weight loss and poorly groomed coat are characteristic of this disease.\n\nThe clinical presentation of cholangitis is non-specific: anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, hepatomegaly and icterus. The disease primarily affects male cats greater than 4 years of age.\n\n\u2022 Shock (hypovolemic, septic, endotoxic)* (p 722)\n\nAcute diarrhea occurs secondary to gastrointestinal ischemia from severe hypovolemia or sepsis and may contribute to patient morbidity.\n\n\u2022 Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (p 730) A rare disease in cats, but is typically associated with small bowel diarrhea, weight loss and a ravenous appetite. Diarrhea is typically chronic but may be perceived as acute onset.\n\nIndiscretion is associated with an acute onset of diarrhea due to overeating, eating too quickly or ingesting a foreign substance (food or non-food). Intolerance presents with intermittent diarrhea or vomiting, with no pattern or association with eating, and resolves when the food source is changed to omit offending substance from diet.\n\nVomiting appears to be more common than diarrhea in cats with food allergy, but it is more likely to occur when the disturbance affects more distal aspects of the GI tract.\n\nThe most common tumor of the feline digestive system is alimentary lymphoma. Other tumors that occur in the small intestine are adenocarcinomas (second), and mast cell tumors (third), with fibrosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas and carcinoids occurring rarely. With the exception of lymphoma, which can occur at any age, most tumors occur in old cats. The clinical signs most often observed are anorexia and weight loss, with vomiting or diarrhea less common. The diarrhea is often chronic, but the onset may be acute.\n\n\u2022 Idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (p 714) Generally considered to be a disorder associated with chronic, intermittent vomiting, diarrhea or weight loss, but acute exacerbations of diarrhea may occur. IBD is described primarily by the predominant inflammatory cell type infiltrating the mucosa. Lymphocytic plasmacytic enteritis is the most common form of IBD, but eosinophilic and suppurative forms of the disease occur as well.\n\nInfections that result in mild to moderate diarrhea are most common in neonates and immunosuppressed adults. Most adults have asymptomatic infestations. The species of coccidia most commonly associated with disease in cats are Isospora spp., Cryptospordium parvum and occasionally Toxoplasma gondii.\n\n\u2022 Giardiasis** (p 707)\n\nAcute or chronic small bowel diarrhea is the most common clinical presentation, however in some cats large bowel diarrhea also may occur.\n\n\u2022 Nematode parasites (roundworms, hookworms)* (p 717)\n\nCommon signs occurring in kittens with roundworms (Toxocara cati, Toxascaris leonina) include unthriftiness, diarrhea and pot-bellied appearance, however, vomiting may also occur.\n\n\u2022 Salmonellosis* (p 719)\n\nDiarrhea, weight loss and systemic illness are primarily problems in young or debilitated cats, as most cats are asymptomatic carriers. The disease is most important clinically in young kittens or geriatric cats that develop septicemia due to Salmonella spp., and may die acutely. Salmonellosis is a zoonotic disease.\n\n\u2022 Clostridium perfringens enterocolitis* (p 721)\n\nDiarrhea occurs due to sporulation of clostridial organisms and release of enterotoxin resulting in a secretory diarrhea that is usually small bowel in character, but can also have a large bowel component.\n\nAcute small intestinal diarrhea is a common clinical problem that is often mild or self-limiting.\n\nIn general, small bowel diarrhea tends to be milder in cats than in dogs because of the capacity of the feline GI tract to absorb water.\n\nSome diseases which typically produce chronic diarrhea may present as acute diarrhea.\n\nIn some cats, life-threatening illness develops due to the severity of fluid loss or as a result of the primary problem causing the small bowel diarrhea (endotoxemia, neoplasia, etc.).\n\nThere are many different causes of diarrhea, which literally is the presence of increased water in the feces.\n\nThe increase in fecal water may be due to a physical, functional or physiologic disturbance in the small intestine, the colon, or both.\n\n\u2022 A large volume of watery or very soft feces.\n\n\u2022 No mucus or hematochezia, if blood is present it occurs as melena. \u2022 There is little or no straining or tenesmus. \u2022 Weight loss and vomiting are commonly observed. \u2022 The frequency of defecation is normal to increased.\n\nDiarrhea may be due to increased osmotically active substances present in the lumen. The most common causes of this type of diarrhea are dietary overload/indiscretion and malabsorption, which can be due to deficiency of pancreatic (e.g. EPI) or intestinal brush border enzymes, or upper small bowel diseases (e.g. mucosal or intramural), such as IBD or lymphoma.\n\nIncreased secretion of water and electrolytes is another cause of diarrhea which occurs primarily as a result of activation of cellular second messenger pathways (cAMP, cGMP, etc) . The causes of secretory diarrhea in cats include Salmonella, Clostridium, Campylobacter, E. coli, and Staphylococcus. Diarrhea due to hyperthryoidism may also be due to a secretory mechanism, but this is unproven.\n\nThe presence of increased intestinal permeability due to inflammation, erosion/ulceration or necrosis is also an important cause of diarrhea. A major cause of increased permeability diarrhea in cats is IBD, but lymphoma or other causes of intestinal inflammation, such as the enteroinvasive bacteria (e.g. E. coli) can also cause diarrhea by this mechanism.\n\nAltered intestinal motility, either increased or decreased segmentation or propulsion movements will cause diarrhea. While it is difficult to prove that altered motility is the primary cause of diarrhea in many cases, it may occur in hyperthyroidism, dysautonomia, some infectious enteropathies and in GI neoplasia.\n\nThe main consequences of acute small bowel diarrhea are dehydration and development of metabolic acidosis as a result of fluid and electrolyte losses.\n\nInfectious and parasitic causes of small intestinal diarrhea may be either self-limiting or severe, depending on the pathogenicity of the organism.\n\nInflammatory bowel disease, neoplasia and other more severe diseases that cause small bowel diarrhea are often associated with other signs of systemic or GI disease, such as weight loss, anorexia, vomiting or depression.\n\nSmall bowel diarrhea can be the result of disease in the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) or occur secondary to systemic illness (peritonitis, septicemia), organ failure (hepatic, renal or pancreatic disease) or other miscellaneous causes such as hyperthyroidism.\n\nA careful history and physical examination will determine whether the problem is likely related to the GI tract or a systemic problem.\n\nIn otherwise healthy cats with acute diarrhea that is likely due to dietary indiscretion, mild infectious enteritis or exposure to a self-limiting toxin, a minimal diagnostic approach is needed.\n\nIn cats that are dehydrated, clinically depressed, anorectic or vomiting, a more aggressive approach that includes a hemogram, chemistry profile, fecal analysis, and radiographs or ultrasound is indicated.\n\nThe most common causes of mild, self-limiting small bowel diarrhea include food intolerance or dietary indiscretion, and some infectious or parasitic agents.\n\nCats with small bowel diarrhea of a more serious nature often have systemic illness/organ failure (e.g. hepatitis, renal failure, or pancreatic disease such as pancreatitis), or severe intestinal disease such as neoplasia or inflammatory bowel disease, which must be carefully evaluated.\n\nDiagnosis is based upon history and physical examination findings, radiography, hematology and serum chemistry profiles, serology if indicated for FeLV/FIV, serum TLI, fecal analysis, fecal cytology or alpha-1 protease inhibitor testing, serum cobalamin/folate assays and histopathology.\n\nClassical signs \u2022 Vomiting, anorexia or reduced appetite are common. \u2022 Acute gastroenteritis is more common in young cats or kittens, but can occur in any age, breed or sex. \u2022 Mild to severe small bowel diarrhea may also be observed.\n\nMild, acute small bowel diarrhea is a common presenting complaint, and may be caused by a variety of self-limiting disturbances, including dietary, parasitic, infectious or toxic agents.\n\nSmall bowel diarrhea can be caused by osmotic (increased unabsorbed substances present in the lumen, such as occurs in overeating or malabsorption), secretory (increased secretion of ions and water into the lumen, which is mediated by second messengers such as cAMP or cGMP and often stimulated by bacterial or viral agents), increased permeability (increased intestinal permeability occurs from diseases that cause increased inflammation, erosion, ulceration or necrosis), and altered intestinal motility (increased or decreased intestinal motility can result in diarrhea, especially when it affects segmentation contractions in the colon).\n\nCats with self-limiting gastroenteritis require minimal diagnostic testing and will respond to symptomatic treatment.\n\nCertain strains of E. coli may behave as gastrointestinal pathogens. Very little is known about diarrheagenic E. coli in cats and further epidemiological investigations on this subject are needed. One recent study showed no difference in the strains of E. coli isolated from a group of cats with diarrhea and a control group of cats that did not have diarrhea.\n\nAcute onset of vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia or lethargy in an otherwise healthy cat.\n\nDehydration may occur if the signs are severe.\n\nRarely associated with hematemesis, hematochezia or melena.\n\nAcute idiopathic gastroenteritis is a pathological description and not a diagnosis. One of the many etiologies listed in this chapter is the likely cause. However in cats that are otherwise healthy, but have mild signs of gastroenteritis and no clinical evidence of dehydration, an extensive diagnostic work-up is rarely indicated or performed so the cause of the signs remains unknown.\n\nA PCV, TP and fecal examination are simple, inexpensive tests that should be used in cats that seem lethargic or dehydrated.\n\nIn cats with more persistent or severe clinical signs, a dietary change, more extensive fecal analysis (zinc sulfate flotations, culture or cytology) and additional evaluation of the hemogram or chemistry profile is indicated.\n\nFood intolerance (ingestion of substances that cause an adverse response that is not immunologically mediated, e.g. not food allergy) or dietary indiscretion (ingestion of foreign or usual foods or non-food substances that cause GI disturbance) is a common cause of acute gastroenteritis.\n\nBacterial or viral infections of the GI tract may be mild and self-limiting, or severe and life-threatening, so the clinical presentation must be carefully evaluated.\n\nOther causes of acute, mild gastroenteritis are ingestion of toxic substances (plant material, oil or other materials attached to hair coat, etc.).\n\nFluid therapy is indicated if there are clinical signs of dehydration, or if the cat is unable to drink.\n\nBalanced isotonic replacement electrolyte solutions are the best fluid choices for cats with mild to moderate metabolic acidosis and dehydration secondary to acute diarrhea.\n\nFluids may be given subcutaneously in cats that are only mildly dehydrated.\n\nIn cats with severe dehydration or who are intolerant of subcutaneous fluid administration, intravenous replacement of fluid deficits is necessary.\n\nOral rehydration therapy is effective in patients that are mildly dehydrated and can ingest oral fluids.\n\nThe maintenance rate for fluid therapy is 40-60 ml/kg/day, and replacement of fluid deficits is calculated by:\n\nDeficits should be replaced over 4-6 hours or more, and ongoing losses estimated and additional fluid amounts added to the maintenance fluid rate calculated.\n\nshould be initiated once the cat is rehydrated and should be monitored and adjusted based upon serum potassium levels.\n\nAntimicrobial therapy is not routinely indicated for treatment of acute, mild forms of gastroenteritis.\n\nThe choice of antibiotic should be based on the suspected or known causative organism (Campylobacter, Clostridium spp., etc.) .\n\nCats with severe mucosal injury as evidenced by blood loss or hypoproteinemia have the potential to develop septicemia, or signs of systemic sepsis (fever, depression, leukocytosis, hypoglycemia, etc.). These cats should receive broad-spectrum, parenteral antibiotics effective against enteral pathogens (e.g. either alone or in combination: ampicillin, enrofloxacin, trimethoprimsulfadimethoxine, metronidazole or cephalexin).\n\nThe most effective motility-modifying drugs for treatment of diarrhea are the opioids (loperamide 0.08-0.16 mg/kg q 12 h or diphenoxylate 0.05-0.1 mg/kg q 12 h). Opioids should be used with care in cats because safe, effective dosages have not been established.\n\nAnticholinergic drugs have no useful role in the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea in cats with gastroenteritis, because they reduce both peristaltic and segmental intestinal motility contractions.\n\nIntestinal protectants and absorbent agents (kaolin, pectin, activated charcoal, barium, bismuth subsalicylate) may or may not be clinically effective, but are not harmful and are likely most beneficial when used in acute, non-specific enteritis.\n\nBismuth subsalicylate, 0.25 ml/kg q 4-6 h, has been shown to be most effective in acute small-intestinal diarrhea, but should be used cautiously in cats to decrease the possibility of salicylate toxicity.\n\nIf vomiting is a concurrent problem, anti-emetic therapy should also be initiated. Metoclopramide, 0.2-0.5 mg/kg q 6-8 h, or prochlorperazine, 0.1-0.5 mg/kg q 8 h, are two commonly used anti-emetics. Anti-emetic therapy should not be used if a gastric outflow obstruction is suspected.\n\nWithhold food for 24-48 hours in cats with acute small bowel diarrhea, and only offer water or oral isotonic glucose, amino acid and electrolyte solutions.\n\nBecause most diarrheas in cats are osmotic rather than secretory, feeding through an acute diarrhea will worsen the signs and may exacerbate the condition. This is in contrast to humans with secretory diarrhea, where feeding is advantageous.\n\nIn general, for the majority of cats with acute, nonspecific gastroenteritis, the prognosis is excellent.\n\nThe prognosis is guarded for cats with severe diarrhea or diarrhea occurring secondary to problems in other body systems.\n\nReduce opportunities for ingestion of toxic or irritating substances.\n\n\u2022 Intermittent vomiting or diarrhea. \u2022 Inappetence.\n\nFood intolerance is a non-immunologic, adverse reaction to a substance(s) present in food. This reaction may be to a food component such as the type of protein or carbohydrate, a particular component (e.g. wheat gluten) or it may be to food colorings, preservatives, flavorings, etc.\n\nFood intolerances may result from an inability to adequately digest a dietary constituent (e.g. lactose) or from metabolic, toxic or pharmacological responses to food components such as histamine in foods, lectins or from the metabolism of dietary residues by the large intestinal microflora.\n\nThe precise mechanism associated with vomiting or diarrhea due to food intolerance is unknown.\n\nThe mucosa (formerly gut) associated lymphoid tissue is believed to be a major component in the devel-opment of food intolerance, as it is this tissue that is responsible for promoting tolerance and hyporesponsiveness to harmless dietary antigens.\n\nIntolerance may develop as a result of abnormal mucosal barrier function, disturbances in immunoregulation (decreased tolerance) or simply an abnormal recognition or response to certain dietary antigens.\n\nIntermittent but persistent vomiting or diarrhea are the most common signs.\n\nPoor hair coat, pruritus, inappetence or failure to thrive may also be noted but these are less common.\n\nPresence of concurrent dermatologic and gastrointestinal signs should prompt consideration of a food allergy.\n\nThere is no diagnostic test for this problem other than to observe a beneficial response to an appropriate dietary trial. This should be carried out for a minimum of 3 weeks.\n\nUse a highly digestible diet or an elimination diet, either a commercial diet containing a single novel protein source, or a homemade diet of boiled white rice and a novel meat source such as duck, venison, rabbit, kangaroo, tofu, horsemeat, etc.\n\nAcute, intermittent diarrhea in an otherwise healthy cat suggests early inflammatory bowel disease, GI parasites, dietary indiscretion, or acute gastroenteritis due to infectious causes.\n\nIn some cats, this may be a sign of early renal or liver disease, hyperthyroidism and other primary GI abnormalities such as neoplasia.\n\nThe diet should be changed so that it does not contain the offending substance. This may be as simple as changing from a grocery store brand to a premium brand food (or vice versa), but also may require changing to a hypoallergenic food product (e.g. IVD's Limited diets, Hill's d/d, Eukanuba Response formula, Royal Canin, etc.) or in unresponsive cases, formulating a novel homemade diet that is complete and nutritionally balanced.\n\nIn food intolerance, the abnormal gastrointestinal response is non-immunologic, thus the use of oral prednisolone is not indicated and is unlikely to be beneficial.\n\nGood if the appropriate diet can be found, which is usually not a difficult problem. However, the cat may have to remain on the diet indefinitely.\n\nThere is no known method to predict which cats are susceptible to food intolerance, and further, no way to prevent the development of food intolerance.\n\nClassical signs \u2022 Anorexia, vomiting or diarrhea may all occur following administration of antibiotics.\n\nVomiting or diarrhea associated with antibiotics is a common occurrence and can occur with almost all of the popular antibiotics, including: amoxicillin, cephalexin, erythromycin, lincomycin, sulfasoxazole, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfadiazine, metronidazole and clindamycin.\n\nThe mechanism for induction of nausea, vomiting or diarrhea varies for each drug.\n\nDiarrhea often occurs due to a disruption of the enteric microflora that results in overgrowth of pathogenic species or sporulation of normal flora resulting in release of toxins that cause diarrhea.\n\nAnorexia or a decrease in appetite and vomiting are common occurrences following antibiotic use.\n\nDiarrhea may be liquid and explosive (consistent with small bowel diarrhea) or unformed, soft feces with increased mucus (large bowel character).\n\nThere are no age, breed or sex predispositions to adverse effects, but in many cats, once an adverse effect occurs due to one antibiotic, other closely related antibiotics may cause similar problems.\n\nThe diagnosis is not difficult because it is based upon an appropriate history and physical examination findings (e.g. no other abnormalities are found). A fecal exam and appropriate dietary history will rule out the other potential causes of acute diarrhea.\n\nThe best approach is to stop the use of the antibiotic in question, and if antibiotic therapy is still required, switch to an appropriate antibiotic of another class.\n\nThere is no known way to predict a cat's response to antibiotic therapy, but certain antibiotics (e.g. clindamycin, cephalosporins, and amoxicillin) are the most common culprits.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 Acute small bowel diarrhea is most common in young cats or kittens. \u2022 In severely infected kittens, weight loss, anorexia and dehydration may also occur. \u2022 Most adult cats will be asymptomatic or have subclinical infections.\n\nCoccidian parasites (Isospora, Cryptosporidia, etc.) are common intestinal inhabitants that may occur as commensals or pathogens, depending on the circumstances.\n\nIsospora felis and I. rivolta are the two Isospora species (also called Cystoisospora) that infect cats.\n\nCryptosporidium parvum is generally accepted to be the cause of feline cryptosporidiosis.\n\nImmunocompetent cats will only develop Cryptosporidia infections in the GI tract, but immunocompromised cats can have infections of the liver, pancreas, gall bladder and respiratory tract in addition to the GI disease.\n\nCryptosporidiosis has been primarily reported in cats with immunosuppressive or immune-mediated diseases such as FeLV, IBD and intestinal lymphosarcoma.\n\nUnlike most coccidian parasites, the life cycle of Cryptosporidium occurs entirely within one host.\n\nIn other coccidian parasites infection occurs by ingestion of infective (sporulated) oocysts or tissues from an infected paratenic host (wildlife, large animals, etc.).\n\nConcurrent disease, malnutrition, stress and immunosuppression appear to be important contributing factors in the development of clinical disease.\n\nClinical disease is most common in young kittens from crowded, unsanitary, high-stress conditions.\n\nNatural infections of healthy kittens and cats result in asymptomatic infections in almost all cases.\n\nDiarrhea is present in about 10% of cats with the enteroepithelial form of toxoplasmosis but is more common in kittens infected before weaning. Acute diarrhea is most common in neonatal kittens.\n\nThe principal clinical sign of coccidiosis is diarrhea, which may be bloody, mucoid or watery.\n\nOther signs that may be observed include vomiting, weight loss, lethargy and dehydration.\n\nAdult cats that are infected with coccidian parasites (including cryptosporidia) are typically asymptomatic.\n\nYoung or immunocompromised cats with cryptosporidiosis will have profuse, watery diarrhea and mesenteric lymphadenopathy due to intestinal hypersecretion and malabsorption.\n\nDiagnosis is made by identification of isosporoid oocysts in fresh feces.\n\nThe oocysts of cryptosporidia are smaller than RBCs, 1/10th the size of isospora, and 1/16th the size of a Toxocara oocyst.\n\n\u2022 Special flotation media (Sheather's sugar or zinc sulfate flotation) is required along with special staining (Kinyoun's carbolfuchsin negative) or phase contrast microscopy, to identify Cryptosporidia. \u2022 Because of their small size, the operator needs to focus up and down on the sample to be able to identify the oocysts.\n\nOther methods of identification of fecal Cryptosporidia include an ELISA test, however, its effectiveness in identifying feline species of Cryptosporidia is unknown, a PCR test for Cryptosporidium DNA in the feces, or electron microscopy of intestinal biopsy samples.\n\nFecal samples submitted to the laboratory should be preserved in formalin to minimize the risk of human infection.\n\nThe primary differentials are other intestinal parasites or protozoa (giardiasis), infectious diarrhea, toxininduced diarrhea or dietary disturbances, which are common in young cats adjusting to new foods.\n\nSulfonamides are the drugs of choice for Isospora, however they are coccidiostatic, not curative. Sulfadimethoxine (15 mg/kg q 12 h \u00d7 14 days) alone, or in combination with trimethoprim, is the drug of first choice.\n\nOther drugs that may be considered if treatment failure occurs are nitrofurazone, tetracycline, quinacrine, spiramycin or roxithroromycin.\n\nTreatment of subclinical infections of isospora or cryptosporidiosis is not indicated or necessary, as full recovery will occur.\n\nCats or kittens with clinically significant cryptosporidiosis may be treated with tylosin, clindamycin or azithromycin, however, the clinical effectiveness of these drugs is not well tested.\n\nCats or kittens that are dehydrated and anorectic will require supportive care in the form of fluid replacement therapy or nutritional support or both.\n\nThe prognosis for complete recovery in immunocompetent cats and kittens is excellent.\n\nAny adult cat with coccidiosis or cryptosporidiosis should be carefully evaluated for the presence of other immunodeficiency (e.g. FIV) or immune-compromising diseases (e.g. neoplasia, IBD, etc.).\n\nCoccidiosis is primarily a problem of poor sanitation, and over-crowded, high-stress conditions that occur in catteries, shelters and other population-dense situations.\n\nBecause the oocysts (both Isospora and Cryptosporidia) are environmentally resistant, only aggressive sanitation measures (daily fecal removal, disinfection of cages, runs and food utensils with steam cleaning or 10% ammonia solutions) will prevent contamination.\n\nCryptosporidiosis is a significant zoonosis, and thus, careful precautions must be taken in handling infected animals, their feces and their environments.\n\nEven though the association between human infection and feline cryptosporidiosis is weak, this problem should not be taken lightly, especially in cases of cats owned by immunocompromised humans.\n\n\u2022 The most common sign is liquid, to semiformed, diarrhea with increased frequency and urgency. \u2022 Some animals are asymptomatic, and most remain bright, alert and afebrile.\n\nGiardia intestinalis is a commonly encountered flagellate protozoan parasite, with a direct life cycle.\n\nGiardia cysts are ingested from contaminated water, or directly from animal to animal (e.g. in kennels or catteries).\n\nExcystation of the ingested cysts releases two motile trophozoites in the small intestine.\n\nCysts are approximately 9-13 microns in size but are not routinely identified in flotation solutions because they are not shed consistently and are small.\n\nSugar flotation solutions will cause the cysts to shrivel.\n\nTrophozoites are slightly larger, tear-drop-shaped, have four pairs of flagella and are binucleated. The trophozoites attach to the mucosal brush border to absorb nutrients. Little is known about encystation and what triggers it.\n\nCysts are susceptible to desiccation, but can exist for months in a cool, moist environment.\n\nThe pathogenesis of Giardia infection is not well understood but is believed to involve malabsorption, disturbances in brush border enzyme function and possible enterotoxin production.\n\nSevere clinical disease is more common in young cats, but adults can become infected and symptomatic.\n\nProtective immunity appears to protect cats from the development of clinical signs, but may not protect from shedding, since some animals will continue to shed organisms despite treatment.\n\nMost adult cats infected with Giardia spp. remain asymptomatic.\n\nThe most common sign observed is the presence of liquid to semiformed diarrhea, associated with increased frequency and quantity of defecation, in an otherwise healthy cat.\n\nVomiting, dehydration, lethargy and anorexia may be observed in severe cases, but are uncommon.\n\nOccasionally, chronic small bowel diarrhea with weight loss and poor body condition are observed.\n\nCats are more likely to also have evidence of acute or chronic large bowel diarrhea (with hematochezia, increased mucus and tenesmus) than are other species affected.\n\nThe diagnosis is made by appropriate fecal examination techniques. Zinc sulfate flotation is considered to be the most accurate and practical test. Three consecutive zinc sulfate flotations will identify 95% of infected animals.\n\nOther methods include examination of fresh fecal saline smears (1 drop saline with a small amount of feces that is spread thin enough to read a newspaper through) for trophozoites (only 40% of infected animals will be identified), duodenal aspiration (e.g. instill 10 ml of saline into the duodenum, either through the accessory channel of the endoscope or injected directly during laparotomy, and then aspirate the fluid for examination) of fluid looking for trophozoites (requires endoscopy or laparotomy, but is 88% effective), or fecal ELISA testing for Giardia specific antigens (95% sensitivity, but low specificity).\n\nAt this time, the zinc sulfate flotation test appears to be the easiest, most reliable and most accurate method of identifying Giardia infections.\n\nBecause of the small size of the cysts (1/8 the size of a Toxocara oocyst), the operator needs to scan the slide carefully and focus up and down through the different planes to identify the cysts in the preparation.\n\nOther infectious, parasitic, dietary, toxic and idiopathic causes of small bowel diarrhea must be considered since many cats have only mild signs.\n\nMetronidazole (50 mg/kg/day PO for 5 days) continues to be recommended for treatment of giardiasis in cats. However, resistant strains of the protozoan are increasingly being reported, and thus this therapy may not be effective in all cases.\n\nSide effects associated with metronidazole therapy include gastrointestinal upset and neurologic signs, such as seizures, coma and behavioral changes. All of these are less common in cats than in dogs and are reversible with discontinuation of treatment.\n\nOther drugs that have been recommended for treatment of giardiasis are quinacrine and furazolidine, but these drugs may not eliminate the infection, only improve the clinical signs.\n\nAlbendazole and fenbendazole have been recently shown to be effective in treatment of dogs and cats with giardiasis. Albendazole (25 mg/kg q 12 h \u00d7 2 days) is not approved for use in cats in the United States and is teratogenic, hepatotoxic and causes bone marrow suppression, and thus is not recommended. Fenbendazole (50 mg/kg/day \u00d7 3 days) has been recommended for treatment of giardiasis in cats.\n\nProper disposal of feces and good sanitation is essential to remove any environmental contamination.\n\nWith proper diagnosis, treatment and sanitation procedures, Giardia infections can be completely controlled.\n\nSince the cysts are susceptible to drying and many common disinfectants, good sanitation can prevent a once contaminated area from being a source of additional infections.\n\nAvoid allowing cats access to drinking water that may have fecal contamination.\n\nA vaccine is now available that purports to reduce shedding of Giardia cysts, however, immune system activation has been shown to decrease shedding without having an effect on the infection itself. The vaccine does not prevent infection or reduce severity, and in a study in cats made no significant difference overall.\n\nGiardia cysts should be considered potentially zoonotic.\n\nThe infectivity of different strains of Giardia for different species is quite variable, but this fact should not preclude the need to take adequate precautions when handling feces.\n\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal signs are variable, but can include vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss or anorexia. \u2022 Food allergy may also produce dermatologic signs usually in the absence of GI signs.\n\nSee main reference on page 667 for details.\n\nGastrointestinal signs are more variable, but can include vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss or anorexia.\n\n\u2022 In cats, vomiting is more common than diarrhea.\n\n\u2022 Generally, signs of hypersensitivity involve either the GI tract or skin. \u2022 Clinical signs can occur at any age.\n\nMost common signs are dermatologic in origin (pruritus, alopecia, miliary dermatitis, seborrhea), affect the head, face, ears and inner thigh especially, and are non-seasonal in occurrence.\n\nThere are no known breed or sex predispositions for food allergy.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis of food allergy is only obtained by feeding an elimination diet. The signs usually start to resolve after 4-7 days but may require 6-8 weeks for complete resolution, then reintroduction of the offending diet results in the reappearance of signs.\n\n\u2022 The elimination diet chosen depends on the cat's preferences for food, the owner's willingness to make homemade foods, and the clinical situation; however, the best elimination diet is a diet containing a single, novel protein source (turkey, venison, duck, kangoroo, etc.) and a single, novel carbohydrate source (rice, potato, etc.), with no other additives except a pet vitamin. \u2022 A homemade diet (1/3 cup protein, 2/3 cup carbohydrate) can be used as a diagnostic trial, but is not a balanced diet for long-term maintenance. In most cats, choosing a commercial diet that contains a single, novel protein source will work best for long-term management of these cats. \u2022 Diets that contain protein hydrolysates are less antigenic than intact proteins because their molecular structure is too short to bridge IgE receptors on the cell membrane. The usefulness of these diets in cats with food allergy is unknown. Type I (IgEmediated) hypersensitivity is thought to be involved in only about 25% of food allergy cases. However, these diets give another option for both diagnosis and treatment of cats with food allergy.\n\nOther diagnostic tests, including intradermal skin testing, ELISA testing, RAST testing, and gastroscopic food testing have all been tried in an attempt to find easier methods of making the diagnosis. However, the only reliable test currently available is the food elimination trial (which is also what is used in humans).\n\nIn most cats, the hemogram and chemistry profile will be completely normal or have mild non-specific changes associated with inflammation.\n\nOther differentials such as food intolerance, parasites, and metabolic or neoplastic diseases should be considered. Inflammatory bowel disease is also a disease that mimics food allergy and is very difficult to differentiate from it.\n\nFlea allergy is the most common cause of dermatologic signs of allergy, but atopy and food allergy must be considered.\n\nOnce an elimination diet has been identified that successfully relieves the clinical signs, the cat should remain on that diet indefinitely. However, it is best in most cases to try to identify a commercial diet that most closely resembles the elimination diet so that the cat receives a nutritionally complete and balanced diet.\n\nAfter a period on one diet, cats may develop hypersensitivity to that new diet, so new (even more novel) diets will be necessary.\n\nMost cats with food allergy respond only partially or not at all to prednisolone.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss, anorexia and depression.\n\nSee main reference on page 427 for details.\n\nWeight loss (often dramatic), anorexia, vomiting, icterus and depression are the most common signs.\n\nOther signs may include ascites, diarrhea or fever.\n\nMost affected cats are middle-aged or older.\n\nThe presence of icterus helps to narrow the differentials list to hepatic, pre-hepatic and post-hepatic diseases.\n\nThe hemogram in cats with hepatic disease is often abnormal (e.g. mild, non-regenerative anemia, with abnormal RBC morphology including schistocytes, leptocytes or target cells), but the changes are not specific for liver disease. However, it does help rule out pre-hepatic causes of icterus which are rare in cats.\n\nSerum chemistry abnormalities may include elevated liver enzyme activities (sometimes dramatically), hyperbilirubinemia, hypocholesterolemia, hypoalbuminemia, decreased BUN and electrolyte alterations (consistent with vomiting or dehydration, e.g. hypokalemia, hypernatremia).\n\nBilirubinuria is common, but some cats may have urate crystalluria if the liver failure is severe.\n\nBile acid assay (pre-and 2 hours post-prandial) will show mild to moderate elevations.\n\nUrine sulfated bile acids are a new test of liver function that may be useful in situations where obtaining post-prandial bile acids is impossible, for example in inappetent cats.\n\nCoagulation function (platelet numbers and function, and coagulation factors) should be evaluated since liver disease often adversely affects these functions.\n\nUltrasonography is the most useful imaging modality, and it can also be used to obtain fine needle aspirates or biopsies. In cats with cholangitis the liver may be normal, decreased or increased in size, but typically will have a hyperechoic pattern due to the presence of inflammatory infiltrates.\n\nThe results of tru-cut biopsies do not always reflect the histopathologic diagnosis of surgically obtained wedge biopsies. This was illustrated in a recent study of 189 biopsies, where > 60% of the cats had tru-cut biopsies that failed to confirm the presence of cholangitis, which was confirmed by wedge biopsies.\n\nLiver biopsies taken via surgical exploratory are more diagnostic, and will also allow placement of a feeding tube (gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube) during the procedure, which is essential for any cat that has not eaten for 3-5 days.\n\nIn addition to liver histopathology, samples of hepatic tissue should also be submitted for aerobic and anaerobic culture.\n\nCats that have vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss in addition to icterus, the list of differentials is narrowed to pre-hepatic causes (hemolysis), hepatic causes (hepatic lipidosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure, etc.), and post-hepatic causes (pancreatitis, neoplasia of stomach, pancreas, duodenum or bile duct, and common bile duct obstruction).\n\nIn cats that are not icteric, the list of potential causes broadens extensively to include the spectrum of metabolic, neoplastic, toxic and infectious causes of both systemic and primary gastrointestinal origin.\n\nTherapy for cats with cholangitis is largely supportive, but the histopathologic findings are crucial in determining severity, the type of inflammatory infiltrate (which is essential to choosing appropriate therapy), and the overall prognosis for the disease.\n\nMost cats with severe liver disease will require fluid therapy to replace deficits, provide maintenance fluid support during the recovery period, and induce diuresis to assist removal of hepatotoxins and prevent tubular sludging from bilirubinuria and casts.\n\nThe fluids should be isotonic, balanced electrolyte solutions, but preferably not containing lactate, which is not converted to bicarbonate in cats with liver failure and thus serves as an additional source of acid. Ringers solution and Normosol-R are replacement electrolyte solutions without lactate.\n\nVomiting should be controlled with a combination of anti-emetic therapy (e.g. metoclopramide or dolasetron) and acid-blocking therapy (H 2 antagonists such as famotidine), since cats with liver disease are prone to development of hypergastrinemic gastritis.\n\nDiarrhea is rarely severe enough to require therapy and often resolves as the anorexia worsens.\n\nCholerectic agents (Actigall) should be used to reduce bile sludging and improve bile salt flow.\n\nCats with neutrophilic cholangitis should be given broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics. A penicillin combined with a fluorinated quinolone provides a good spectrum of activity for enteric pathogens. Ideally, the antibiotic choice should be based upon culture results, but if the culture is negative or the cat is systemically ill, broad-spectrum antimicrobial chemotherapy should be initiated.\n\nLymphoplasmacytic cholangitis is believed to be an immune-mediated disease and has recently been shown to occur in association with inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatitis. Prednisolone therapy (2-4 mg/kg/day) is indicated in cats with lymphocytic plasmacytic hepatic infiltrates.\n\nNutritional support is often overlooked in cats that do not have hepatic lipidosis, but is crucial for all sick cats due to their requirement for essential amino acids and fatty acids to be provided in the daily diet. Nutrition can be provided in the short term (1-3 days) via nasoesophageal feeding tubes, but for longer periods, esophageal feeding tubes or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube should be placed to allow larger amounts of food per feeding as well as feeding a blenderized cat food rather than liquid enteral diets.\n\nWhen initiating enteral feeding in sick cats, the volume of food must be gradually increased over 3-5 days, to reduce vomiting and gastric retention of food. A con-stant rate infusion of food over 24 hours is less labor intensive than using initial 1-2 hour feedings of small volumes of food. After the initial introductory period, the goal is to achieve a daily caloric intake near the resting energy requirement (RER), calculated as BER = [70 + body wt (kg) \u00d7 30].\n\nMost anorectic or ill cats will benefit from addition of B vitamins to the fluids, however, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency may also develop in cats that are anorectic or have malabsorption. Supplementation with vitamin K and in some cases, vitamin E should be considered in those cats. Supplementation with L-carnitine may also be beneficial.\n\nPotassium and phosphorus should be supplemented in cats with low serum levels using potassium chloride and potassium phosphate. \n\nTypical signs include weight loss despite a good to ravenous appetite, hyperactivity, polyuria/polydipsia, and a poor coat condition.\n\nVomiting, diarrhea or voluminous feces are common, and may be observed as an acute problem.\n\nMost cats will have tachycardia, a gallop rhythm or other signs associated with congestive heart failure (coughing, increased respiratory rate, weakness) secondary to thyrotoxic heart disease.\n\nGastrointestinal signs associated with hyperthyroidism are often intermittent or relatively mild, with the exception of weight loss and appetite changes.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis is an elevated serum total thyroxine concentration (T 4 ).\n\nOther non-specific abnormalities of the hemogram or chemistry profile may include hemoconcentration, mild anemia, increased liver enzyme concentrations, including elevated serum alanine aminotransferase activity, or hyperglycemia.\n\nA thorough assessment of renal function should be undertaken (BUN, creatinine, UA) before initiating treatment of hyperthyroidism in cats since the increased renal blood flow associated with hyperthyroidism may result in acute renal decompensation when the thyroid disease is treated (especially with surgical or radioactive iodine therapy).\n\nMost cats will have a palpable thyroid nodule.\n\nCats with signs of hyperthyroidism but serum total T 4 in the upper half of the normal range should be tested using free T 4 levels, as false lowering of the T 4 level may occur due to non-thyroidal illness.\n\nIn cats with suspected hyperthyroidism, but normal serum total or free T 4 levels, a T 3 suppression test or radioactive thyroid scan can be performed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nCats with signs of cardiovascular disease should also have thoracic radiographs and an echocardiogram performed to determine the extent of thyrotoxic heart disease and need for therapy.\n\nThe major differentials for an older cat with weight loss, vomiting or diarrhea include neoplasia, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, hepatic or renal disease and inflammatory bowel disease. However, the presence of cardiovascular signs, a ravenous appetite or hyperactive behavior with the GI signs should point to hyperthyroidism first.\n\nTreatment for hyperthyroidism includes both control of the over-secretion of thyroid hormone as well as its effects on the remainder of the body (e.g. thyrotoxic heart disease).\n\nThere are three commonly used therapeutic approaches to treatment of the hyperthyroid condition in cats: (1) medical management with methimazole;\n\n(2) surgical removal of the adenomatous thyroid; and (3) radioactive iodine treatment of the cat to obliterate the hyperactive gland(s).\n\nThe treatment method chosen depends on several factors: (1) the condition of the cat (requires assessment of anesthetic and surgical risks, renal function, cardiovascular function; (2) the availability of radioactive therapy; (3) the owner's wishes (financial and other considerations), and the clinical judgment of the attending veterinarian.\n\nPrior to surgical or radioiodine therapy, evaluation of renal function and cardiovascular status is extremely important. Cats with marginal renal function may not be good candidates for thyroidectomy or radioiodine therapy which will reduce renal blood flow and metabolism dramatically and may induce an acute exacerbation of renal failure.\n\nSome cats with thyrotoxic heart disease may require calcium channel or beta-blocker therapy, furosemide if they are in heart failure, or aspirin (efficacy unproven) to reduce the risk of thromboembolism. Many cats with thyrotoxic heart disease respond to treatment of hyperthyroidism alone.\n\n\u2022 Anorexia, inappetence or normal appetite are all possible, depending on the location and severity of the obstruction. \u2022 Weight loss.\n\nIntussusceptions are rare in cats compared to dogs. When they occur, they tend to be in the jejunum.\n\nWith high intussusceptions, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, lethargy, dehydration and hypovolemia leading to shock are the most common clinical signs.\n\nLow intussusceptions (at the ileocolic junction) typically present with bloody, mucoid diarrhea, tenesmus, intermittent vomiting and weight loss. In many of these cases, the intussusception can be palpated.\n\nDepending on the location and severity of the obstruction, there may be anorexia or inappetence and vomiting.\n\nHemogram and serum biochemistry profiles are variable depending on the severity and location of the intussusception, however, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, anemia and leukocyte changes have all been observed depending on the cause of the intussusception.\n\nRadiographs and/or ultrasound examination of the gastrointestinal tract are the best means of confirming the diagnosis. Contrast studies may be used but should not be done at the expense of delaying treatment in severely ill cases.\n\nEndoscopic examination or colonoscopy can also be used to obtain a diagnosis, especially with low intussusceptions.\n\nMany diseases that can precipitate an intussusception (viral enteritis, foreign bodies, gastroenteritis, intestinal parasitism, etc.) also have clinical signs that mimic it. Therefore, a thorough physical examination, diagnostic evaluation, and close patient monitoring are essential. Mesenteric volvulus is a very difficult condition to differentiate from intussusception both clinically and radiographically, but fortunately is very rare in the cat.\n\nIntussusception must be considered a surgical emergency. Cats with signs of shock or endotoxemia should be prepared for surgery by correcting fluid and electrolyte imbalances, administration of broadspectrum, parenteral antibiotics (combinations such as ampicillin/amoxicillin or cefazolin and enrofloxain, amikacin, cefoxitin or imipenam), and use of histamine-2 blockers (ranitidine or famotidine) or protectants if gastric erosions or ulceration is suspected.\n\nMotility-enhancing drugs, such as metoclopramide, are contraindicated in patients with GI obstruction and should not be used.\n\nAfter surgical correction, if gastric ulceration is not a complicating factor, oral alimentation should be instituted in the first 24 hours, to enhance the return of normal motility and reduce the possibility of postoperative ileus.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss, anorexia or inappetence \u2022 Acute onset of vomiting or gagging, occasionally diarrhea is observed.\n\nSee main reference on page 636 for details.\n\nThe signs depend upon the location of the foreign object.\n\nWith gastric or upper small intestinal obstructions, acute onset of frequent vomiting or gagging is common.\n\nDehydration, lethargy and anorexia are common in these cats, and they may show evidence of abdominal discomfort (either on palpation or by posture).\n\nIn cats with a lower intestinal obstruction, diarrhea will be more prevalent and vomiting less frequent.\n\nIf the foreign body is of significant size or if intestinal plication from a linear foreign body is present, these abnormalities may be palpable.\n\nCats that develop an intestinal perforation as a result of the foreign body may be quite ill (depression, fever, hypovolemia/shock).\n\nDepending on the location and severity of the obstruction, there may be an acute onset of anorexia or inappetence.\n\nHistory and physical examination findings are very important. Always examine under the tongue of vomiting cats for evidence of a string or thread foreign body.\n\nHemogram and serum biochemistry profile findings will likely be normal if the condition is acute.\n\nLong-standing or severe linear foreign bodies or GI perforation will show an inflammatory response, evidence of dehydration (hemoconcentration or elevated proteins) and electrolyte abnormalities consistent with vomiting (hypokalemia is most common).\n\nThe diagnosis is obtained by imaging studies, including radiography (plain or contrast studies looking for evidence of an obstructive gas pattern), ultrasonography or upper GI endoscopy. In some cases, endoscopy will allow retrieval of the foreign object, and is a useful means of assessing other damage (e.g. erosions, ulcers, or tears in the mucosa).\n\nAcute diarrhea is not the classic clinical sign of a foreign body, but may occur in combination with vomiting or anorexia, and can occur without these signs if the obstruction is more distal.\n\nthat may not suggest the diagnosis immediately.\n\nOther differentials in those cases would include infectious, dietary or inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases.\n\nIn cases where the object is still in the stomach, it is sometimes possible to safely retrieve the object (needle, small toy, etc.) via an endoscopic procedure.\n\nMost GI foreign bodies however, will require surgical removal, and some may be a surgical emergency when GI perforation has occurred.\n\nCats that are severely dehydrated from persistent vomiting, or have suspected intestinal perforation and leakage should be stabilized as much as possible with aggressive fluid therapy and broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to surgery (e.g. combination of ampicillin/amoxicillin or cefazolin and enrofloxacin, amikacin or cefoxitin). Some cats with a protracted history of vomiting will benefit from histamine-2 blockers or GI protectants if gastritis or gastric erosions are suspected.\n\nMotility-modifying agents, such as metoclopramide, should not be used until the obstruction is relieved.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 Vomiting, anorexia and weight loss are the most common signs of upper GI IBD. \u2022 Diarrhea can occur. \u2022 Affected cats are usually middle aged or older, with no particular sex or breed predisposition.\n\nSee main reference on page 768 for details.\n\nTypically, IBD is associated with upper GI signs of chronic intermittent vomiting, weight loss and anorexia.\n\nDiarrhea is also observed in some cats, when the disease affects the colon or distal small intestine. This occurs less often in cats than in dogs. Acute exacerbation of diarrhea may occur.\n\nThe disease is most prevalent in middle-aged to older cats, but the range is from 6 months to 17 years.\n\nThere appears to be no breed or sex predisposition to IBD in most studies, but purebred cats and males appear to be over-represented in some studies.\n\nIBD is a diagnosis of exclusion, that requires two steps: (1) the histopathologic confirmation of an excessive inflammatory response, and (2) the elimination of the multitude of potential causes for GI inflammation.\n\nThe majority of cats with IBD will have a normal hemogram and serum chemistry profile, however, a few abnormalities are not uncommon, but they are not specific for IBD. These include leukocytosis, mild non-regenerative anemia, increases in liver enzyme concentrations, mild hypoalbuminemia and mild hyperglycemia.\n\nFecal examination (flotation, direct exam, cytology) is essential to rule out parasitism.\n\nUltrasound examination is very important, not only in evaluation of the abdomen for structural abnormalities, but especially for assessing bowel wall thickness and lymph node enlargement, which have been shown to correlate well with the severity of IBD.\n\nUltrasound is also important, as it may allow fineneedle aspiration of abnormalities which facilitate diagnosis, but also will help determine the best approach to take when obtaining the biopsies (full thickness vs. endoscopic).\n\nRadiography, including contrast studies, has not been shown to be helpful in differentiating cats with IBD and those with other diseases.\n\nUltimately, endoscopic examination or a surgical exploratory will be necessary to obtain biopsies of the GI tract. Endoscopy is less invasive and allows visualization of the mucosal surface, which may assist in the evaluation of the cat. Multiple (6-8) biopsies should be taken from multiple sites (stomach, duodenum, ileum and colon), even if there is no visible evidence of disease.\n\nSince there are no simple, easy tests for food intolerance or food allergy, dietary elimination trials should be conducted in all cats with signs of IBD or that have inflammatory infiltrates of the GI tract.\n\nThe list of diseases that may mimic, cause or complicate IBD (e.g. cause GI inflammation and similar clinical signs) is extensive: systemic diseases (hyperthyroidism, pancreatic disease, liver disease, feline viral diseases, toxoplasmosis), parasitic diseases (nematodes, Giardia, Cryptosporidia, other parasites such as coccidia, entamoeba), bacterial infection (Helicobacter, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Clostridia, etc.), metabolic diseases (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, serum cobalamin or folate deficiency), nutritional disorders (food intolerance), immunological conditions (food allergy) and neoplasia (lymphoma, adenocarcinoma, mast cell tumor).\n\nThe key to successful treatment of IBD is to have a correct diagnosis (and that is a real challenge).\n\nEven if food allergy/intolerance has been ruled out, a highly digestible, hypoallergenic or elimination diet is important in the treatment of IBD. Cats with IBD have an abnormal gut immune system, thus the presence of additional dietary antigens will only serve to exacerbate the inflammatory response.\n\nMetronidazole (10-15 mg/kg q 12 h PO) is also very effective, and in some cats, may be as effective as steroid therapy. Many clinicians start with metronidazole and dietary therapy, and then add prednisolone if the response to treatment is incomplete.\n\nIn cats with severe IBD that is not responsive to metronidazole, prednisolone and dietary therapy, cytotoxic drugs may be considered. However, most cats with IBD do not require additional cytotoxic drug therapy, to manage their disease. Drugs have may be considered include chlorambucil (2 mg/m 2 ), azathioprine (0.3 mg/kg EOD) and cyclosporine (5 mg/cat/day).\n\nCats with a poor response to treatment or recurrent disease should be carefully re-evaluated (including multiple GI biopsies) to be sure that the diagnosis is correct. Lymphoplasmacytic enteritis can be mistaken for intestinal lymphoma in the early stages or a new problem may have developed.\n\n\u2022 Chronic, progressive vomiting that may include hematemesis. \u2022 Weight loss and anorexia may be the earliest, and most consistent signs. \u2022 Lethargy or depression are also common, especially later in the course. \u2022 Diarrhea is more common with infiltrative neoplasms.\n\nSee main reference on page 675 for details.\n\nWeight loss and anorexia are the earliest and most common clinical signs.\n\nLethargy or depression are also common.\n\nDiarrhea is most common with infiltrative neoplasms, such as alimentary lymphoma, which is the most common neoplasm in the feline small intestine.\n\nVomiting is a common presenting complaint and may be associated with hematemesis.\n\nIn the USA there is no breed predilection for lymphoma, but Siamese cats appear to be predisposed to adenocarcinoma.\n\nIntestinal forms of lymphoma are usually found in FeLV-negative cats, however, the multicentric form of lymphoma can involve the GI tract and is often associated with FeLV-positive antigenemia where FeLV is frequent in the feline population.\n\nBoth adenocarcinoma and mast cell tumors of the GI tract are often associated more with vomiting and weight loss due to their mass-like, obstructive behavior.\n\nPalpation of the abdomen may reveal a mass or thickened intestinal loops.\n\nHematology and serum chemistry profiles are usually non-specific, but help to rule out other causes of vomiting. The most frequent hematologic abnormality is anemia of chronic disease (normocytic, normochromic), but blood loss anemia is also observed. The abnormalities found in the chemistry profile depend on the extent of the disease and severity of vomiting, and are non-specific as well.\n\nThe most helpful diagnostic procedures are imaging techniques: radiography, ultrasonography or possibly endoscopy. There are no specific radiographic features of neoplasia, since it may be infiltrative or obstructive in nature. Ultrasound may be more helpful in identification of thickened loops of bowel or mass lesions.\n\nDepending on the location and size of the mass, ultrasonography will allow visualization of the lesion, and may also facilitate diagnosis via fine-needle aspiration or biopsy.\n\nIn cats with obstructive or mass lesions, lesions unreachable by the endoscope, or when ultrasoundguided fine-needle aspirates are non-diagnostic, surgically obtained biopsies and resection are the best approach.\n\nAlimentary lymphoma is easily (and often) mistaken, especially in the early stages of disease, for lymphoplasmacytic enteritis (inflammatory bowel disease).\n\nincluding hyperthyroidism, chronic renal failure or liver disease, pancreatitis, severe food intolerance or sensitivity, and severe forms of infectious enteritis. Differentiation of these diseases is based on blood testing, exploratory laparotomy and intestinal biopsy.\n\nIn cats with mass-like or obstructive lesions, other diseases to consider are intussusception or foreign bodies, FIP or fungal granulomas, and focal abscesses. Differentiation often requires exploratory laparotomy or biopsy.\n\nFor adenocarcinoma, mast cell tumors and other tumors that tend to occur as solitary mass lesions, surgical removal via intestinal resection is the primary approach. Biopsies should be obtained of liver, regional lymph nodes and mesenteric tissues to determine if metastasis has occurred and its extent.\n\nLymphoma of the alimentary tract is generally an infiltrative neoplasm and chemotherapy using combination protocols (COAP, etc.) are the treatments of choice. See main reference on page 676 for details.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 Abdominal distention, colicky abdominal pain. \u2022 Poor body condition, not nursing or eating. \u2022 Diarrhea or abnormal feces.\n\nToxocara cati and Toxascaris leonina are the primary roundworms of cats. T. cati can be transmitted via milk, and by ingestion of the ova or hosts (e.g. rodents) containing the ova. Adult roundworms live in the small intestine.\n\nAncylostoma tubaeforme is the most common hookworm of cats, but is less pathogenic than the primary hookworm of dogs (A. caninum). Infections occur by ingestion of larvae, migration of larvae through the skin, via paratenic hosts, or prenatally. However, hookworms are much less of a problem in cats than in dogs.\n\nKittens are most likely to have clinical signs associated with infestation with helminths.\n\nThe clinical signs may include abdominal distention, colicky abdominal pain, poor body condition/hair coat, poor or reduced appetite, diarrhea or abnormal feces, and vomiting worms or vomiting due to masses of worms obstructing passage of ingesta.\n\nAscarids of cats do not pass through the placenta, so kittens will not develop prenatal infections like puppies do.\n\nFecal flotation will reveal spherical egg (Toxocara cati) with pitted outer shell membrane containing a single zygote, and approximately 75 \u00d7 45 \u03bcm in size. Toxascaris is also an ovoid egg of similar size but has a smooth shell.\n\nAncylostoma tubaeforme (60 \u00d7 40 \u03bcm) is the most common hookworm of cats, and is most prevalent in tropical regions. The eggs are elliptical and slightly smaller than roundworm eggs, but still readily identified on saline fecal flotation.\n\nInfection may be associated with peripheral eosinophilia, hypoproteinemia, and mild to severe regenerative anemia (blood loss).\n\nKittens with severe intestinal parasitism may develop a bowel obstruction or intussusception resulting from the motility disturbance, in these kittens, radiography, contrast studies or ultrasound examination will be necessary to identify the problem.\n\nThe age and clinical signs are usually supportive of the diagnosis, but other protozoal, infectious or dietary causes of gastroenteritis should be considered.\n\nAnthelmintics such as pyrantel (5-10 mg/kg PO once) or fenbendazole (25-50 mg/kg PO q 24 h for 3 days) are effective and can be used for treatment of both kittens and adult cats.\n\nSelemectin (oral monthly heartworm preventative, flea adulticide and nematocide) may be used to treat or prevent intestinal parasites.\n\nRepeat treatment in 2-3 weeks (hookworms) and 4-6 weeks (roundworms) to effectively kill prepatent stages.\n\nFeces must be removed from the litter box or collected if outside, and incinerated.\n\nExcellent, except in cats with intestinal obstruction, etc., which have a more guarded prognosis until the problem is surgically corrected.\n\nBoth roundworms (visceral larval migrans) and hookworms (cutaneous larval migrans) have zoonotic potential, but are not as prone to cause larval migrans as canine parasites.\n\n\u2022 Acute onset of vomiting, diarrhea, hypersalivation and agitation. \u2022 Contact dermatitis. \u2022 Ataxia and possibly seizures.\n\nSee main reference on page 644 for details.\n\nSigns associated with contact exposure or ingestion of pyrethrin/pyrethroid-containing pesticides is generally mild.\n\nVomiting, diarrhea, hypersalivation and agitation are the most common signs of organophosphate toxicity.\n\nPermethrins are very toxic to cats, resulting in central nervous system signs, which include muscle tremors, ataxia, excitation or seizures. Cats may also become hyperthermic secondary to prolonged muscle activity or seizures.\n\nContact dermatitis is not common, but may be observed in cats with the topical preparations.\n\nHistory of exposure to or ingestion of products containing permethrin (most common) or pyrethroids.\n\nThere is generally no need for further diagnostic testing since signs will abate with removal of the product from the skin or GI tract and supportive care.\n\nThe history of recent application of a product containing these chemicals is usually definitive.\n\nThe first and most important step, if the cat is not seizuring, is to bath the cat to remove any remaining chemical.\n\nCats that have muscle tremors, seizures or other neurologic dysfunction may need specific therapy such as phenobarbital or valium for seizure control. Methocarbamol (a muscle relaxant) may be helpful in decreasing excessive muscle activity.\n\nOrganophosphate toxicity is treated with 2-PAM and/or atropine (0.2-0.4 mg/kg) to control the excessive salivation and defecation.\n\nThe signs will be self-limiting once the chemical is removed from the body, so supportive care is all that is required. However, some cats may require 1-3 days to recover.\n\nSince cats will not drink or eat, fluid therapy may be needed. In some cats, muscle tremors may be so severe to increase body temperature, so monitoring (and controlling) body temperature is important.\n\nClassical signs \u2022 Mild to moderately severe diarrhea for 2-5 days, usually in kittens (enteric form). \u2022 Signs of FIP are vague and variable and include weight loss, fever and anorexia. \u2022 Occasionally vomiting and chronic diarrhea are observed in cats with FIP.\n\nDiarrhea is uncommon in adults, but occasionally can be a peracute, severe hemorrhagic diarrhea.\n\nThe clinical signs associated with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus infection are quite variable and depend a great deal upon the stage when the cat presents to the veterinarian for evaluation.\n\nCats with fulminant FIP will likely be severely depressed, anorectic and have significant weight loss. Respiratory distress from pleural effusion is also common, as is the presence of ascites. Some of these cats will have gastrointestinal tract signs, such as vomiting or diarrhea, if there is significant intestinal, liver or renal dysfunction.\n\nCats with the so-called non-effusive or \"dry\" FIP, will have much more vague clinical signs, including reduced appetite, fever, mild weight loss and general malaise. Some cats will have mild abdominal discomfort, respiratory signs, neurological signs and granulomatous retinal lesions.\n\nIn some cats, FIP granulomas will cause more focal signs associated with the body system that is affected. Vomiting and/or chronic diarrhea from granulomas in the GI tract have been reported, as have central nervous system signs ranging from ataxia to seizures.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis of FIP in cats antemortem is quite difficult, especially in cases of focal or nonfulminant FIP.\n\nInterpretation of serologic tests can be difficult, because most test for antibodies to FECV, rather than for the FIPV form of the virus. While the negative predictive index is relatively good, false-negative tests can occur in cats with FIP. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is the best current test, but at present is only definitive for confirmation that a cat does not have FIP. The PCR test still has false positives that prevent it from being a good screening/diagnostic test. The 7B ELISA test detects antibody to 7B protein, but both false-positive and falsenegative results are common with this test.\n\nCurrently, the definitive test for FIP remains histopathologic examination or immunohistochemistry and virus isolation.\n\n\u2022 Abdominal distention, colicky abdominal pain.\n\n\u2022 Poor body condition, not nursing or eating.\n\n\u2022 Diarrhea or abnormal feces.\n\nSalmonella are motile, Gram-negative bacilli that are ubiquitous pathogens able to infect many mammals, birds and reptiles.\n\nVirulence of different strains varies and this is determined by the ability to invade tissues.\n\nSalmonella localize in the lymph nodes and intestinal tract, and shedding of organisms occurs for 3-6 weeks. Reactivation of shedding or clinical illness may occur after stress, immunosuppression, other viral infections or crowded environmental conditions.\n\nSalmonella produce enterotoxins which increase secretions and fluid loss in addition to the enteroinvasive effects.\n\nEndotoxemia due to Salmonella is believed to only occur in cats with severe immunocompromise.\n\nThere are several clinical syndromes that occur: gastroenteritis, bacteremia/septicemia, organ localization and the persistent asymptomatic carrier state.\n\nAcute episodes occur 3-5 days after exposure, with the most severe signs in kittens or old cats.\n\nCats will present with fever, malaise, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea.\n\nThe diarrhea varies from watery to mucoid and may have hematochezia.\n\nWeight loss, dehydration, shock and death will ensue if the cat is not treated aggressively.\n\nOther organ systems may be affected with the systemic illness, including the CNS (seizures) and respiratory tract (pneumonia).\n\nVery young kittens, less than 7 weeks old, will not have fever despite bacteremia. Hypothermia, weakness and collapse may occur without the onset of GI signs.\n\nOrgan localization occurs after clinical or subclinical bacteremia and is less common in cats than it is in humans.\n\nThe most common sites of organ localization include pyothorax, meningitis, osteomyelitis and focal abscesses of organs or skin.\n\nSongbird fever is a clinical syndrome of acute febrile illness in cats associated with seasonal migrations of birds in the northeastern United States. The disease is characterized by fever, depression, diarrhea and anorexia in young, roaming (outdoor) cats that lasts for 2-7 days and may be self-limiting or very severe.\n\nThe vast majority of cats with salmonellosis (>90%) have transient or no clinical illness. Occasionally chronic diarrhea will occur for up to 8 weeks. Recovered cats will shed for up to 6 weeks.\n\nHistory (acute onset) and physical examination (fever, depression, diarrhea) will be important suggestive factors but there are numerous causes of acute diarrhea in young cats.\n\nRoutine hematology and serum biochemistry profiles are typically unremarkable in the early phases, but will show evidence of dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and leukocyte abnormalities in the later stages. Cats with bacteremia/septicemia will have a left shift or degenerative neutropenia, hypoglycemia, and may have hepatic or renal compromise as a result of the endotoxemia.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis depends on the culture of Salmonella spp. from fecal samples, or from urine, CSF, synovial fluid or blood in cats with bacteremia.\n\nSerology can be used, but many subclinically infected cats will have titers, thus this method is not an accurate means of diagnosis. It is also not useful in acutely ill cats to aid treatment decisions because of the time delay in seroconversion.\n\nFecal cytologic exam will reveal large number of fecal leukocytes, thus suggesting an infectious organism that disrupts the mucosal barrier.\n\nOther acute, GI infectious diseases, such as feline panleukopenia virus, Campylobacter and Clostridium should be considered, in addition to Giardia, Cryptosporidia, dietary indiscretion and toxicity.\n\nAcute gastroenteritis, without systemic septicemia, is best treated with parenteral isotonic replacement fluids. Maintenance fluid therapy is 40-60 ml/kg/day and replacement includes maintenance plus correction of dehydration, i.e. BW \u00d7 % dehydration plus additional fluids to replace any ongoing losses. The replacement fluids are to be given over 12-24 hours, then the fluid rates can be adjusted to meet the patient's needs for maintenance and ongoing losses.\n\nCats with severe hypoproteinemia due to GI protein loss or septicemia and endotoxemia may benefit from plasma transfusions or colloid (Hetastarch) therapy.\n\nAntibiotic therapy is not indicated in treating cats with uncomplicated gastroenteritis, but is recommended in cats with sepsis or endotoxemia. Antibiotics that may be effective against salmonellosis include the fluorinated quinolones, aminoglycosides and trimethoprim-sulfonamide combinations.\n\nAntibiotic therapy may prolong the period of shedding, and is associated with development of resistant populations of Salmonella spp.\n\nThe presence of neutrophils on a rectal cytology swab justifies antibiotic therapy.\n\nExcellent for cats with mild or subclinical infections, which comprise the majority of the cases.\n\nIn cats with septicemia or endotoxemia, the mortality rate is high due to cardiovascular collapse, renal failure and DIC.\n\nEnforcement of strict hygiene (litter box) and proper cleaning of cages (phenolic compounds or bleach) will reduce the risk of subclinical carriers creating disease problems in large population groups or hospitals.\n\n\u2022 Acute small bowel diarrhea with or without anorexia or lethargy.\n\nClostridium perfringens is an anaerobic, Grampositive, spore-forming rod that is a normal inhabitant of the colon in animals and people.\n\nEnterotoxin formation by Clostridium spp. causes increased membrane permeability and results in fluid and ion loss. Eventually, the epithelial cells will die and slough.\n\nMost clostridia exist in the GI tract in their vegetative state, but under certain conditions (alkaline environment, other concurrent infections, antibiotic therapy or stress) the bacterium will undergo sporulation and release of enterotoxin.\n\nFollowing an infection, the organism can be shed for weeks to months, and because of its stability in the environment, has the potential to infect many other susceptible animals.\n\nThe most common clinical sign is severe, watery to mucohemorrhagic diarrhea.\n\nIn most cats, the diarrhea only lasts a few days, but in some, it may persist and become chronic. Animals that have severe diarrhea will become dehydrated, lethargic and may be anorexic.\n\nThere is no breed, sex or age predisposition, but cats from catteries or in stressed environments are at increased risk.\n\nThe history (acute onset, predisposing conditions) and physical examination findings (character of the diarrhea) help to focus the diagnostic approach toward infectious, parasitic and dietary causes of diarrhea.\n\nThe presence of the organism can be confirmed by culture of fresh fecal specimens, however, because this is part of the normal flora, this approach is not definitive.\n\nSimilar to the dog, there appears to be a poor correlation between the presence of fecal endospores and the presence of enterotoxin.\n\nReverse passive latex agglutination (RPLA) tests for clostridial enterotoxin are available and have been used in dogs and humans, but have not been evaluated in cats. In dogs, the test does not differentiate dogs with clostridial diarrhea from normal dogs, as > 25% of normal dogs are positive. An enzyme immunoassay (Techlab, Inc., Blacksburg, VA) appears to be more specific in dogs. A positive enterotoxin assay determined by ELISA (regardless of endospore numbers) in the context of clinical signs consistent with clostridial infection is strongly supportive of clostridial-associated diarrhea.\n\nPCR tests are also utilized for testing feces for enterotoxin, but are not universally available.\n\nOther enteric bacterial infections, parasitic and protozoal infections, dietary disturbances and toxin exposure should all be ruled out first.\n\nBecause this disease can occur in any age of cat, other considerations are metabolic disease (hyperthyroidism), liver disease and neoplasia.\n\nIn severely ill cats, parenteral fluid therapy and introduction of a bland, highly digestible diet is necessary.\n\nThe primary treatment is the use of antimicrobial drugs that have a good spectrum against anaerobic bacteria: metronidazole, tylosin, ampicillin/amoxicillin and clindamycin have all been successfully used.\n\n(1 tbsp psyllium/cat), or changing to a diet with increased dietary fiber may greatly reduce the proliferation of clostridial organisms in the large bowel.\n\nGood with appropriate antibiotic therapy in most cats.\n\nSome cats will have recurrent bouts of diarrhea that require repeated treatment with antibiotics or may benefit from lactulose, which reduces the luminal pH and thus will decrease sporulation.\n\n\u2022 Acute onset of generalized depression, fever or hypothermia. \u2022 Tachycardia/tachypnea and signs of shock. \u2022 Vomiting is not consistently present but does occur, and bloody diarrhea is also occasionally observed.\n\nSee main reference on page 269 for details.\n\nCats with endotoxemia or sepsis are depressed, usually febrile (but may be hypothermic), and show signs of shock.\n\nVomiting or bloody diarrhea may occur in the later stages of illness.\n\nOther signs include respiratory distress, weakness, obtundation and seizures.\n\nHemogram, serum chemistry and urinalysis show neutrophilia if there has been time for neutrophilia to develop, or neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia early, progressing to hypoglycemia later. Hyperkalemia, and elevated liver enzymes and BUN are common, as is bacteriuria.\n\nBlood culture is indicated in patients with suspected bacteremia to confirm the infection exists. Urine culture is also helpful in cases with renal seeding of the infection.\n\nImaging studies are important in further evaluating the extent of illness and may help identify a focus of infection (e.g. radiographs of chest, abdominal ultrasound).\n\n\u2022 Acute onset of anorexia, vomiting, pyrexia, depression, weakness and dehydration. \u2022 The disease is most severe in kittens, and has a high mortality rate. \u2022 Diarrhea occurs late in the course of the disease.\n\nFeline panleukopenia is a parvovirus that requires rapidly dividing cells for successful infection (lymphoid tissue, bone marrow and intestinal mucosal crypts).\n\nInfections of kittens in utero, or in the immediate postnatal period, results in infection of the cerebellum, cerebrum, retina and optic nerves which may result in seizures, behavioral changes, cerebellar dysfunction and retinal degeneration.\n\nDamage to the intestinal crypt cells results in shortening and eventually loss of the villous (absorptive) cells. Diarrhea is caused by malabsorption and increased permeability.\n\nKittens infected with panleukopenia are highly susceptible to secondary bacterial infections with enteric microflora.\n\nGram-negative endotoxemia is a common complication and cause of death in kittens.\n\nInfection of the queen early in the pregnancy can result in a wide variety of reproductive disorders, including early fetal death, infertility, abortions or fetal mummification. Late-stage gestation infections result in the birth of live kittens with varying degrees of neurologic dysfunction.\n\nAs with canine parvovirus, the feline virus is highly contagious, and is very persistent in the environment.\n\nPanleukopenia is transmitted by direct contact of susceptible animals with infected cats or their secretions (feces contains the largest amount of virus). However, fomites are an important aspect of transmission because of the prolonged survival of the virus in the environment.\n\nFeline panleukopenia can be inactivated by bleach and formaldehyde, but is resistant to other common disinfectants.\n\nThe majority of cases of clinical panleukopenia are observed in kittens or young cats under 1 year age.\n\nClinical signs vary from mild to very severe.\n\nAnorexia, depression and extreme lethargy are very common clinical signs in the early stages.\n\nDiarrhea occurs 24-48 hours after the onset of depression, and may be mild or marked with severe blood-streaked or hemorrhagic diarrhea.\n\nIn the peracute form, death may occur before diarrhea develops.\n\n\u2022 The cat often sits sternally with its head down (flexed). \u2022 Abdominal palpation may reveal evidence of pain, enlarged abdominal (mesenteric) lymph nodes and increased gas or fluid in the intestines.\n\nThe cat may or may not be febrile, but may become febrile if there is sepsis. In the late stages of fatal disease, the cat will almost always become hypothermic.\n\nKittens affected in late gestation, or in the first 9 days after birth, are often ataxic, hypermetric, dysmetric, incoordinated and have a base-wide stance when they begin to walk at 2-3 weeks of age.\n\nOther neurologic abnormalities include seizures, behavioral changes and retinal degeneration.\n\nPrenatally infected kittens may be stillborn or die as fading kittens in the first few days of life.\n\nMany susceptible cats will be infected, but have subclinical or mild GI signs associated with depression and anorexia for 1-3 days.\n\nSecondary upper respiratory tract infections may occur, especially calici-or herpesvirus infections.\n\nThe history (acute onset of depression and vomiting), signalment (cat less than 1 year of age) and physical examination findings (fluid-and gas-filled intestines) are all suggestive of the disease.\n\nThe milder forms of the disease that occur in adult cats can be difficult to differentiate from many other gastrointestinal diseases.\n\nThe most consistent hematologic abnormality is panleukopenia, with leukocyte counts typically ranging between 500 and 3000 cell/\u03bcl. Because the disease is so acute, serum biochemistry values are usually within normal limits. Hypoglycemia and elevated liver enzyme concentrations may be detected in cats with endotoxemia.\n\nThere is no licensed ELISA test kit for the feline parvovirus, however, the canine test kit will detect the feline parvovirus in feces as well. False-positive and false-negative test results can occur.\n\n\u2022 False-positive test results can occur following recent vaccination with a modified live panleukopenia vaccine, and false-negative results occur if the kitten is tested before shedding starts, if there is low virus burden or late in the course when shedding becomes more intermittent.\n\nSerologic testing is still an important diagnostic test for feline panleukopenia, but it requires paired samples (acute and convalescent) that show a rise in titer to be definitive. Serology is usually only indicated in a multi-cat facility so appropriate preventative vaccination programs can be implemented.\n\nOther tests that can be performed include virus isolation on feces or tissues and electron microscopy for detection of virus particles in the feces.\n\nIn its severe form, which is typically present in kittens, few diseases mimic feline panleukopenia.\n\nMilder clinical forms of the disease in adult cats must be differentiated from all other infectious causes of gastrointestinal disease (e.g. campylobacterosis, giardiasis, etc.).\n\nFeline leukemia virus can present in some cats with a panleukopenia-like syndrome, but is easily distinguished from feline panleukopenia by the presence of FeLV antigenemia, persistent leukopenia and anemia in a well, vaccinated cat.\n\nSalmonella infections in cats are usually subclinical, but can present with a fulminant gastroenteritis similar to panleukopenia. In acute salmonellosis, leukopenia may be present.\n\nTreatment is supportive, but must be aggressively administered if it is to be successful.\n\nThe key is maintenance of fluid (40-60 ml/kg/day plus correction of dehydration and treatment of ongoing losses) and electrolyte balance (add potassium chloride to fluids) and prevention of secondary bacterial infection until the body is able to neutralize the virus with antibody.\n\nAntibiotics effective against enteric pathogens (Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria) must be given to control secondary bacterial infections. Combination therapy with ampicillin (10-20 mg/kg q 8 h) or cephalexin (20-30 mg/kg q 8 h) and amikacin (8 mg/kg q 24 h) or enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg q 24 h) is necessary for broad-spectrum coverage.\n\nControl of vomiting can usually be achieved with metoclopramide (0.2-0.5 mg/kg q 6-8 h) or prochlorperazine (0.1-0.5 mg/kg q 6-8 h) therapy.\n\nPlasma or blood transfusion therapy (up to 20 ml/kg for plasma therapy, or calculate transfusion to increase the PCV to approximately 20%) are indicated in kittens with severe anemia, hypoproteinemia or hypotension.\n\nYoung kittens also need nutritional support to prevent the development of hypoglycemia and assist the immune response. B vitamin supplementation is also especially important.\n\n\u2022 Nutritional support may include tube feeding (orogastric, nasogastric) with liquid enteral supplements, force feeding of canned or blenderized foods, or intraosseous/intravenous feeding (total or partial parenteral nutrition). If the kitten is not vomiting, the enteral route is preferred, but in vomiting patients, parenteral routes of feeding will be necessary. The most important nutrients to include are amino acids and glucose, which can be given via a peripheral vein or intraosseously.\n\nAs with other parvovirus infections, aggressive supportive care (fluids, antibiotics, warmth, control of emesis, and nutrition, including gamma globulins if available) is the key to success.\n\nTreatment of adult cats is supportive, but depends on the severity of the clinical signs.\n\nThere is no treatment for the neurological signs.\n\nThe prognosis for kittens or very young cats with severe signs of feline panleukopenia is guarded to grave, as many die. Kittens infected before 10 days of age that survive have life-long neurologic dysfunction, which is not progressive, and may be acceptable to the owners.\n\n\u2022 Arsenic toxicity eventually results in hepatic and renal failure presenting as depression, anorexia, vomiting and diarrhea, along with oliguria or anuria, or icterus and ascites.\n\nSee main reference on pages 596, 659 for details.\n\nThere are two major categories of clinical signs with lead poisoning: (1) gastrointestinal signs, which occur early in the course of the disease, and (2) central nervous system signs, which are manifest late in the disease.\n\nGI tract signs occur early with lead toxicity and may include vomiting, diarrhea, salivation, inappetence and lethargy.\n\nChronic signs of lead toxicity involve the central nervous system, and include seizures, tremors and ataxia.\n\nArsenic causes GI signs early, but is hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic, resulting in depression, anorexia, vomiting and diarrhea along with oliguria or anuria, or icterus and ascites.\n\nLead is commonly found in older paints, while arsenic is primarily obtained from snail baits.\n\nHistorical information of exposure to heavy metals is a very important means of getting the diagnosis, however, such information is not always known.\n\nThe hemogram and serum chemistry profile will be unremarkable when the cat presents with signs of gastrointestinal disturbance.\n\nThe most common hematologic abnormality asssociated with lead poisoning is basophilic stippling of red cells, which occurs in 30% of cats with lead exposure, and the presence of nucleated red blood cells (also 30%). However, these tests are not pathognomonic for lead poisoning.\n\nHeavy metals also cause hepatocellular necrosis, which will be evidenced by elevations in serum ala-nine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase enzymes. Other abnormalities may include elevations in bilirubin, bile acid values and decreases in albumin (in end stage hepatic failure).\n\nNephrotoxicity associated with arsenic poisoning is also associated with isosthenuria, azotemia and eventually oliguria/anuria.\n\n\u2022 Clinical signs are incredibly variable and depend on which organ(s) are affected. \u2022 Weight loss, inappetence. \u2022 Occasionally vomiting or chronic diarrhea. \u2022 Diarrhea is rarely observed as an acute onset. \u2022 Anemia may be observed.\n\nSee main reference on page 540 for details.\n\nInappetence, weight loss, and lethargy are typical non-specific signs.\n\nThe clinical signs observed in cats infected with feline leukemia virus will be quite variable and depend upon which body system(s) is affected.\n\nNeoplasia, immunosuppression and bone marrow disease (especially of the red cell series causing anemia) are the most common clinical manifestations of the disease.\n\nGeneralized lymphosarcoma is a manifestation of FeLV in cats, and involvement of liver and mesenteric lymph nodes results in gastrointestinal tract signs, such as vomiting, anorexia, chronic diarrhea and weight loss. While the diarrhea is generally chronic in nature, the owner may perceive that it is acute in onset. Occasionally, the diarrhea occurs in cats with a good to increased appetite.\n\nAny ill cat should be tested for infection with feline leukemia virus, due to its many clinical manifestations and the poor prognosis that exists for cats that are infected with the virus.\n\nThe hemogram and serum chemistry profile will likely be abnormal, especially in cats with systemic illness. The changes may be mild or subtle (mild anemia of chronic disease, mild changes in white blood count, liver enzymes, etc.) in the early stages of the disease, and dramatic (severe non-regenerative anemia, leukopenia, elevation of liver enzymes, etc.) when the disease finally progresses to end-stage.\n\nRadiographs and ultrasound examination are useful in detecting lymphosarcoma involving the GI tract.\n\nBiopsy of the GI lesions via fine-needle, tru-cut or wedge resection of tissue will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of lymphosarcoma.\n\nThe definitive diagnostic test for detection of feline leukemia virus infection in cats is a serum ELISA test which detects viral antigen. A positive test should be confirmed using a follow-up ELISA test 8-12 weeks later, or by using an immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test on whole blood or bone marrow, as the sensitivity and specificity of serological tests such as these are affected by the incidence of disease in the local population and the individual cat's risk factors for infection.\n\n\u2022 Chronic disease of middle-aged to older cats. \u2022 Most common clinical signs are weight loss, chronic infections and development of neoplastic disease. \u2022 Acute or chronic diarrhea is an uncommon problem but occasionally occurs as the only sign.\n\nSee main reference on page 339 for details.\n\nClinical signs may be due to direct effects of the virus or occur secondary to the development of immunodeficiency, but in either case, occur in middle-aged to older, male cats that are outdoor or occasionally fight.\n\nAcute signs include fever, lymphadenopathy and inappetence. Other signs include weight loss and nonspecific lethargy.\n\nChronic small bowel diarrhea is one clinical syndrome associated with FIV infection. Other syndromes include non-regenerative anemia, neutropenia, anterior uveitis, glomerulonephritis and central nervous system signs ranging from behavioral changes to seizures.\n\nHistory (middle-aged, male, outdoor cat) and physical examination (non-specific signs of weight loss, with possible multi-system involvement) findings are suggestive.\n\nAntibodies to FIV are detected in serum by an ELISA test commercially available.\n\nCats vaccinated for FIV will be positive to the antibody test and cannot be distinguished from infected cats.\n\nConfirmation of the test is not usually necessary in ill cats, but in healthy cats, confirmation of the positive antibody test by western blot or PCR analysis is suggested.\n\nKittens may obtain antibody from milk and not be infected, so a positive antibody test in kittens under 16 weeks of age should be re-evaluated in 1-2 months to determine whether the antibody was maternal or infectious.\n\n\u2022 Abdominal distention, colicky abdominal pain, and diarrhea are the most common signs. \u2022 Kittens are generally in poor body condition, or have other concurrent infections.\n\nCampylobacter spp. are Gram-negative, motile rods associated with diarrheal disease in many species.\n\nThe disease is spread by fecal-oral mechanisms, with food and water being primary sources of infection.\n\nThe disease is most prevalent, and clinically significant, in kittens from catteries, shelters or laboratories.\n\nMost adult cats have asymptomatic infections, and those with diarrhea often have other concurrent enteric pathogens present that exacerbate the severity of the disease.\n\nExposure to Campylobacter results in the development of protective immunity which may explain why kittens are more prone than adults to the development of clinical disease.\n\nIn cats, clinical signs of campylobacteriosis are uncommon in the absence of other pathogens. Most infections are asymptomatic.\n\nAffected cats are usually less than 6 months of age.\n\nwhich may be watery, bloody, mucoid or a combination.\n\nSome kittens will become systemically ill with lethargy, dehydration and anorexia observed.\n\nHistory and physical examination findings are important, but may be unremarkable.\n\nRoutine hematology, chemistry profiles and imaging studies are typically unremarkable.\n\nDiagnosis can be confirmed by culturing freshly obtained fecal samples. Samples can be transported at room temperature without special handling, but must be cultured in a microaerophilic atmosphere.\n\nCampylobacter are often cultured from the feces of normal cats (up to 40%), so it is important to correlate the presence of the organism with the history and clinical signs.\n\nDark-field or phase contrast microscopy can also be used to identify the motile, curved bacteria on fresh fecal samples. Gram-stained samples can also be used to identify the gull wing-shaped rods in the feces. However, these approaches are less sensitive and require more technical skill.\n\nInfectious (Salmonella, Clostridium), parasitic (Giardia, Cryptosporidia, etc.), and dietary (intolerance or discretion) agents should all be considered.\n\nSince most cats with Campylobacter infections are asymptomatic or associated with other infections, the effectiveness of antibiotics for treatment of this disease is unknown.\n\nSeveral antibiotics appear to be effective in eliminating the organism, including erythromycin (10 mg/kg q 8 h PO), metronidazole (5-10 mg/kg q 12 h, PO), cephalosporins (20 mg/kg q 12 h PO), and fluorinated quinolones (5 mg/kg q 24 h PO).\n\nExcellent, especially in adult cats.\n\nEnteric campylobacters are known to be human pathogens, and kittens can be a source of human infection.\n\nUsually kittens with diarrhea are incriminated as causes of human infection, however, because humans can be infected with extremely small amounts of the bacteria, asymptomatic cats and kittens that are shedding can also be a source of infection.\n\nThe best way to prevent human zoonosis is to stress the importance of exercising appropriate personal hygiene when handling pet feces or litter boxes.\n\n\u2022 The only presenting sign is chronic diarrhea.\n\nThe pathogenesis of idiopathic juvenile diarrhea is unknown.\n\nOther treatments that may be necessary include fluid therapy, anti-emetics such as metoclopramide (0.2-0.5 mg/kg PO or SQ q 8 h), and offering food that is bland or highly digestible.\n\nOnce signs of nephrotoxicity are observed following lily plant ingestion, progression to anuric renal failure and death is unavoidable. Supportive care with fluid therapy may slow the onset of signs, but there is no effective treatment.\n\n\u2022 Severe, small bowel diarrhea that may be unresponsive to treatment. \u2022 The hemogram is characterized by peripheral eosinophilia and there is infiltration of eosinophils in the bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes and other organs.\n\nSee main reference on page 758 for details.\n\nThe clinical signs are similar to those of cats with IBD except the intestinal wall thickening is more pronounced, hepatosplenomegaly is common, and bloody diarrhea is common. The diarrhea is usually chronic rather than acute.\n\nSome cats will cough, have skin lesions (miliary dermatitis) and have peripheral lymphadenopathy, but these clinical signs are less common.\n\nHistopathologic examination of liver, spleen, lymph node or intestinal biopsies provides the definitive diagnosis. There is infiltration of these organs by large numbers of normal eosinophils.\n\nThe cornerstone of treatment is high-dose prednisolone therapy (3-6 mg/kg/day PO), but relapses are common, even if the high doses of steroids are maintained. Hydroxyurea (7.5 mg/kg q 12 h PO) may also be used to reduce eosinophil production. It is administered for 3-14-day courses, as required to maintain the cat in remission.\n\nNutritional or fluid support is often required until the disease is brought under control.\n\nThe prognosis is guarded to poor.\n\n\u2022 Abdominal pain, lethargy, ascites, anorexia and fever are common signs. \u2022 Vomiting or diarrhea are less frequent, but often observed in more severe cases.\n\nSee main reference on page 467 for details.\n\nIntestinal perforation secondary to string or other foreign bodies, is the most common cause of peritonitis. Other causes include penetrating wounds and chemical peritonitis (due to bile duct rupture).\n\nAbdominal discomfort/pain, lethargy and anorexia are common signs.\n\nVomiting or diarrhea are not common signs, but when they occur are often associated with severe disease.\n\nFever and abdominal distention/effusion may also be present.\n\nAbdominal radiographs (plain, contrast) and ultrasonography will suggest peritonitis and may pinpoint location or cause (ruptured gallbladder, pancreatitis, bowel rupture).\n\nDefinitive diagnosis confirming the presence of peritonitis is with abdominocentesis or diagnostic peritoneal lavage and cytologic/bacteriologic examination of fluid.\n\nHematology is non-specific: inflammatory leukogram, stress leukogram or sequestration of neutrophils.\n\n\u2022 Severe, and in some cases intractable, small bowel diarrhea. \u2022 Peracute onset of vomiting, depression and anorexia if associated with ischemic intestinal disease.\n\nShort bowel syndrome is classically due to surgical resection of a large segment (75-90%) of the small intestine that results in fluid overload to the colon and resultant diarrhea.\n\nOther causes include ischemic intestinal diseases such as intussusception, bowel strangulation and intestinal volvulus, which are very rare in the cat.\n\nIntestinal adaptation occurs in the large bowel, which ultimately results in a return to a soft or semiformed fecal specimen.\n\nIf greater than 85% of the small intestine has been removed the chance for adaptation is poor.\n\nCongenital forms of short bowel syndrome are also rare, and will be seen in kittens with intractable diarrhea.\n\nDiarrhea, dehydration and weight loss all occur as a result of short bowel syndrome.\n\nOther signs are related to intestinal malabsorption: deficiency of proteins, vitamins or clotting factors.\n\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth may also occur resulting in vomiting or anorexia as well.\n\nIf associated with ischemic intestinal diseases, evidence of endotoxemia and shock may be present.\n\nDepression, anorexia and vomiting are the most common signs. The acuteness and severity of the signs depend on the extent of the bowel compromise.\n\nThe diagnosis is presumptive if surgical resection is the cause.\n\nCats are often hypoproteinemic, may be hypocholesterolemic, and have other non-specific hemogram or chemistry abnormalities.\n\nImaging studies can be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nOther diseases that may cause similar signs include severe infectious enteropathies, inflammatory bowel disease or alimentary neoplasia.\n\nIf the disease is spontaneous in the adult cat, stabilization and prompt surgery is required.\n\nTincture of thyme will allow the bowel to adapt when the syndrome is iatrogenic in origin.\n\nLow-fat, highly digestible diets are necessary to maximize absorption of nutrients.\n\nFat-soluble vitamins should be administered as needed. Cobalamin 125-250 \u03bcg SQ once per week until serum concentrations are normalized, then every 1-2 months to maintain levels. Folate 0.5 mg PO daily until serum levels normalized then as required. Vitamin E supplementation may also be needed.\n\nParenteral nutrition may be required in some cats in the early stages to support them until bowel function returns.\n\nGuarded; in cats where diarrhea persists for longer than 2 months after the resection, the prognosis for a return to function is poor.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss despite a vigorous appetite, which may include pica and coprophagy.\n\nMost cats with EPI can be successfully treated by dietary supplementation with pancreatic enzymes. The powder products (1 tsp per meal) appear to be more clinically effective than tablets.\n\nIf the cat refuses to eat the food with pancreatic extract, raw pancreas can be offered, but it is essential to use bovine pancreas to prevent transmission of Aujeszky's disease in porcine pancreas in areas where the disease occurs.\n\nA diet that contains low amounts of insoluble fiber should be fed, since insoluble fibers may interfere with pancreatic enzyme activity.\n\nSome cats will not respond to enzyme supplementation alone, and this may be due to concurrent cobalamin deficiency or small intestinal disease. Cobalamin supplementation should be given parenterally (100-250 \u03bcg SC once weekly for 6-8 weeks, then monthly or bimonthly as needed).\n\nIn cats with suspected vitamin K deficiency, supplementation should also be initiated (vitamin K 1 1 mg/kg/day PO).\n\nOther supplements that should be given include: tocopherol (30 IU orally, once daily with food for the first month until levels are normalized), and folate (0.5 mg orally, once daily).\n\nIt is unknown whether or not cats develop small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as a complication of EPI as is common in dogs. However, in cats that do not respond as anticipated to pancreatic enzyme supplementation, addition of metronidazole or tetracycline to the treatment regime is indicated.\n\nBecause EPI is associated with the irreversible loss of pancreatic acinar tissue, complete recovery is not possible.\n\nHowever, with appropriate management, cats with EPI will gain weight, pass normal feces and can live a normal life.\n\nThere is no known way to prevent the development of EPI, however, if cats with chronic pancreatitis can be recognized and appropriately managed, it may be possible to prevent the consequences of chronic pancreatitis-EPI.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 The disease occurs primarily in kittens at weaning age, but is rare. \u2022 Rapid onset of depression, abdominal discomfort. \u2022 Death within 24-48 hours is common, but some may have signs several days before death.\n\nDisease is caused by Bacillus piliformis, a sporeforming, Gram-negative, intracellular bacillus. This is primarily a disease of laboratory rodents, and is very rare in cats and dogs, but may be seen in kittens and especially weanlings.\n\nThe source of the infection is believed to be rodent feces.\n\nThe organism proliferates in the intestinal epithelium producing enterocolitis and then spreads to the liver and systemic circulation.\n\nThe most common signs are an acute onset of depression and abdominal discomfort.\n\nDeath usually occurs within 24-48 hours, although weight loss and recurrent or chronic diarrhea can occur in older cats.\n\nThe diarrhea is typically infrequent, scant and pasty.\n\nThere is no ante-mortem test for Tyzzer's disease, and most frequently, the diagnosis is made by necropsy.\n\nThe lesions are most severe in the ileum, colon and liver, with the ileum and colon being severely thickened.\n\nSpecial stains (Giemsa) will reveal the filamentous organisms in the histopathologic specimens.\n\nThe organism is difficult to culture because of its intracellular, microaerophilic nature.\n\nThe disease is so peracute that panleukopenia must be considered, as well as other infectious agents that cause severe enteritis and systemic disease.\n\nThere is no known effective therapy.\n\nSupportive care with antibiotics, fluids and maintenance of body functions (temperature, nutrition) are essential.\n\nPoor.\n\n32 -THE CAT WITH SIGNS OF ACUTE SMALL BOWEL DIARRHEA 733"}
