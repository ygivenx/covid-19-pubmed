{"title": "Prediction of outcome and prognosis of patients on mechanical ventilation using body mass index, SOFA score, C-Reactive protein, and serum albumin", "body": "Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (MV) is the standard supportive therapy for acute respiratory failure (ARF).[1] Prolonged endotracheal intubation has become the standard of care in most intensive care units (ICUs) for maintenance of MV. Unfortunately, this approach is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.[2] In critically ill patients suffering from ARF, weaning from ventilatory assistance is a key survival factor.[3] Despite the efficacy of MV, there are still patients in whom positive pressure ventilation is not successful in preventing further deterioration of respiratory function.\n\nClinical trials and observational studies usually use scoring systems for the assessment of the severity of organ function impairment. One of most popular among them is the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.[4] SOFA is composed of scores from six organ systems (respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological) graded from 0 to 4 according to the degree of dysfunction/failure.\n\nHowever, the prediction of MV duration is difficult and has been studied by few authors. A retrospective study done on elective cardiac surgical patients showed that vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and arterial oxygen pressure, before surgery, predict the duration of MV.[5] Moreover, for emergent intubation, respiratory parameters cannot be measured before the tracheal intubation. Established prognostic factors such as nutritional depletion as assessed by body mass index (BMI) and serum albumin levels and overall systemic inflammation as estimated by C-reactive protein (CRP) appear to be major determinants of hospitalization and death risk whatever the end-stage respiratory disease.[6] Increased CRP levels are strongly and independently associated with respiratory impairment.[7] A higher CRP value was associated with the development of respiratory failure and subsequent intubation in patients with probable severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).[8] Hence, the severity of inflammatory response and impairment of organ function are the major determinants of the outcome in critically ill patients.\n\nThe predictive ability of SOFA score, BMI, CRP or serum albumin as a simple, inexpensive, and dynamic marker of critical illness in patients requiring MV has been studied by few authors. Hutter et al. study had showed that the group of patients that failed non invasive positive pressure ventilation had a mean BMI of 23 kg/m2, which is relatively under weight. However, authors have not correlated BMI with the duration and outcome of mechanical ventilation.[9] Studies done on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have shown that patients with low BMI and nutritional depletion tend to have poor prognosis.[10\u201312] Also high CRP levels have been associated with development of respiratory failure and subsequent intubation in patients with probable severe acute respiratory syndrome.[78] Frequency of hospitalization in COPD patients have been found to be independently determined by elevated CRP.[6] It has also been shown that BMI of < 23.3 kg/m2 and CRP of >10 mg/L is an independent predictor of more than seven days duration of MV.[13] However, in this study only the patients who had improved were included in the study. We wanted to study whether these parameters can be used to predict mortality of the patients with acute respiratory distress on mechanical ventilation. Hence, this study was designed to determine the presence of a relationship between the SOFA score, BMI, CRP, serum albumin with the duration and outcome of the patients with acute respiratory distress on MV.\n\nProspective follow-up study\n\nThirty patients (age >18 years) admitted to the ICU of tertiary care hospital and who required mechanical ventilation were enrolled for the study. They were divided into two groups; patients who improved (Group 1), patients who expired (Group 2). Group 1 was further divided into two groups; patients on mechanical ventilator for <5 days (Group A), patients on mechanical ventilator for >5days (Group B). Approval from the institutional ethical committee was taken before commencement of the study. Written consent was taken from the patient relatives before collection of blood. Patients without neuromuscular diseases, left ventricular dysfunction, chest or abdominal trauma, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, chest pain or suspected myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery, burn injury or any addiction, no history of exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure during the last 3 months were included in the study.\n\nDuration of MV was calculated from the time the patient was intubated and connected to ventilator till the time he was disconnected from the ventilator. A combination of subjective and objective parameters were used to wean the patient from MV. The objective parameters used were: a) PaO2/FiO2 > 150-200; b) level of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) between 5-8 cm H2O; c) FiO2 level <50%; d) pH > 7.25; e) ability to initiate spontaneous breaths. The subjective parameters used were: a) hemodynamic stability; b) absence of active myocardial ischemia; c) absence of clinically significant vasopressor requiring hypotension; d) adequate muscular strength allowing the capability to initiate/sustain the respiratory effort.\n\nArithmetic mean and SD were estimated to assess the level of various parameters in the study. Differences in the outcome from MV, BMI, CRP, serum albumin, and SOFA score between the defined groups were assessed using the Mann\u2013Whitney nonparametric test. The nonparametric Spearman ranked sign procedure was used to assess the significance of associations. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and positive or negative likelihood ratios (+ LR) for BMI, CRP, serum albumin and SOFA score in predicting the outcome of patients from MV were calculated. Also, receiver operative characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed for each of the predictive variables and the areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were compared. The analyses were facilitated with the use of the MedCalc 11.5.1.0 software packages. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to determine; which of the above variable was an independent risk factor for predicting the outcome of patients from MV. Differences were considered significant if the P value was <0.05. In order to test the significance of difference among the four groups based on obesity, analysis of variance was applied at 5% level of significance.\n\nThe distribution of patients in the study groups along with their mean age is shown in Table 1. Out of the 30 patients enrolled for the study, 18 patients successfully improved after mechanical ventilation support was given to them and 12 patients expired. The mean age and BMI of the patients who improved (Group 1), when compared with those who expired (Group 2), did not show any statistical significance P value 0.56 and 0.25, respectively. Serum albumin levels though decreased in group 2 when compared to group 1 was not statistically significant (P value 0.09). However, SOFA score and CRP were highly increased in group 2 when compared to group 1 (P value 0.0004 and 0.0001, respectively) [Table 2].\n\nOut of the 18 patients in group 1, 10 patients improved within 5 days and 8 improved after 5 days. The mean age of the patients belonging to the two groups were comparable and did not show any statistical significance (P value >0.48). Also, mean BMI, serum albumin, CRP, and SOFA score did not show any statistical significance in the two groups [Table 3].\n\nWhen patients were classified based on the Indian Standards of BMI,[14] 50% of the patients had normal BMI (BMI: 18.5 to 22.9), 23.3% of the patients were under weight (BMI <18.5), 13.3% of the patients were overweight (BMI 23-25), and 13.3% were obese (BMI >25). Age, duration of MV, SOFA score, and serum albumin and CRP levels did not show any statistical difference in the four groups based on the Indian standar5ds of BMI [Table 4].\n\nThe sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, positive or negative LR and area under the ROC curve (AUC) to predict the outcome of the patient from MV is shown in Table 5 and Figure 1. CRP had high specificity or PPV for predicting the outcome from MV. The SOFA score had high sensitivity or NPV for this purpose. The AUC for CRP or SOFA score was not significantly different (P > 0.05). CRP >24.2 mg/L or SOFA score >7 at the start of MV increases the probability of mortality by factor 13.08 or 3.92, respectively. By performing stepwise logistic regression analysis, it was shown that the most powerful predictor of outcome of patients from MV was SOFA score. An increase of 1 in SOFA score significantly increased the relative probability of mortality by a factor of 1.662 (95% CI, 1.1659-2.3707, P = 0.005). Also, by performing Spearman ranked correlations it was seen that CRP and SOFA score at the start of MV showed highest correlation with the mortality (rs = 0.68 and rs = 0.59, respectively). The association was negative with serum albumin concentration [Table 6].\n\nSmall sample size is the limitation of the study. Therefore, large-scale, multi-centric, prospective epidemiologic studies must be conducted to confirm and validate the findings of this preliminary study.\n\nSimple, economic and easily accessible markers like CRP and assessment tools of critically ill patients with SOFA score are important determinants of possible outcomes of a patient from MV."}
