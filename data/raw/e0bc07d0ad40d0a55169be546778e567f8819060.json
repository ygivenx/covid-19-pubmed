{"title": "Journal of Infection The Clinical Characteristics of Myocardial injury 1 in Severe and Very Severe Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease", "body": "We read with interest the recent article published by Yang W et al. 1 We noted significantly increased cTnI, CK, HBDB and LDH levels in very severe group as compare to severe (Table 1) . We then applied Fisher's exact test to determine the positive rate of cardiac lesion markers between severe and very severe patients. Increasingly, the percentage of very severe patients with elevated cTnI levels was markedly higher, with 8/8 patients exhibiting increased cTnI in very severe group, and only 1/26 patient in severe group (P value<0.001). In addition, the abnormal percentage of HBDB and LDH showed no significant difference between 2 groups (Table 2) .\n\nRecently, a number of studies have described the epidemiological and clinical characters of COVID-19 2-4 . A study of 41 patients with COVID-19 has suggested that 12% of the mild and severe cases combined showed increased hyper sensitivity troponin I, suggesting acute myocardial injury 2 . It is also reported that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 6 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 7 have caused critical cardiac lesions. In the present study, we have focused on cardiac lesion biomarkers in severe and very severe patients with COVID-19. We have proved elevation of cTnI, CK, HBDB, and LDH in critical cases. It is important to notify that, in very severe group, 8/8 patients exhibit cTnI above reference level; while 1/26 in severe group. This suggests that elevated cTnI could be a potential indicator for critically ill patients. It is worth notifying that among the 8 critically ill patients enrolled, the kidney and liver function markers are not as significantly disturbed as the cardiac lesion markers, suggesting that most patients enrolled have not been suffering from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Thus, the consistently high cTnI levels in very severe group point to the importance that the heart injury could be a distinct, or even lethal feature in very severe COVID-19. Protecting from myocardial injury could be of vital importance in clinical treatment for reducing the mortality rate. The study was limited by small sample size. And we haven't analyzed the echocardiography and MRI for the patients enrolled. Further analysis is needed to determine the etiology.\n\nAuthor Contributions: BZ, XM and YW collected the clinical and laboratory data. JS processed statistical analysis.
