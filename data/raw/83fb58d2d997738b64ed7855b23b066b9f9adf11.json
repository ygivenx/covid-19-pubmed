{"title": "Structure-based glycoengineering of interferon lambda 4 enhances its productivity and anti-viral potency", "body": "Interferons (IFNs) are a group of cytokines that serve as the first line of defense against viruses. In addition to their protective role against viral infection, the interferon (IFN) family -consisting of types I, II, and III IFNs, have numerous additional functions that influence cellular growth and immune surveillance against tumor cells [1] [2] [3] . All three IFN members activate the JAK/STAT pathway and induce interferonstimulated gene (ISG) expression by binding to their respective receptors: IFN\u03b1R1 and IFN\u03b1R2 for type I interferon (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2), IFN\u03b3R1 and IFN\u03b3R2 for type II interferon (IFN\u03b3), and IFN\u03bbR1 and IL10R\u03b2 for type III interferon (IFN\u03bb1~4) [1, 4] . In contrast to types I and II, type III IFN was only recently identified and plays not only antiviral functions but also novel immunomodulatory functions in oncology and autoimmune diseases [5, 6] . IFN\u03bb1~3 were identified through computational based prediction from genome sequencing [7, 8] and IFN\u03bb4 was discovered in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients [9] . The \u0394G allele of a dinucleotide genetic variant (rs368234815) that is upstream of the IFNL3 locus on chromosome 19 creates the functional IFN\u03bb4, while the TT allele leads to a frameshift, thereby rendering it a pseudogene [9] . Interestingly, HCV patients with the \u0394G allele and hence expressing IFN\u03bb4, responded poorly to PEGylated-IFN\u03b1-ribavirin treatment as compared to patients with the TT allele [10] . However, IFN\u03bb4 still induces the major hepatic ISG expression during chronic HCV infection and is able to drive the anti-viral response against other viruses such as the MERS-CoV in vitro [11] . Similar to IFN\u03b1 (Roferon-A for hairy cell leukemia) and IFN\u03b2 (Avonex for multiple sclerosis), successful phase 2 clinical trials of PEGylated IFN\u03bb1 against hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection highlight the pharmaceutical potential of the IFN\u03bb family.\n\nIFN\u03bb4. It was suggested that a weak signal peptide in IFN\u03bb4 may be responsible for its impaired secretion and that proper glycosylation of IFN\u03bb4 may be required for its secretion [9] . Although recombinant IFN\u03bb4 can be purified from a bacterial expression system through refolding the inclusion body [11] , a lack of glycosylation may affect the efficacy of IFN\u03bb4. Recently, glyco-engineering, which introduces new glycosylation sites or alters the glycan composition of CHO cells, has been widely used to produce improved therapeutic proteins, because glycan moieties can affect various protein properties, such as solubility, stability, in vivo activity, and serum half-life. For example, improved half-life and productivity are obtained from glyco-engineered hIFN\u03b2-1a and hIFN\u03b1 [12, 13] . Moreover, increased secretion of lipase, cutinase, llama V HH antibody, and macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 results from the addition of a single N-glycosylation site [14, 15] . Therefore, we propose that glyco-engineering IFN\u03bb4 is a viable option for improving its expression level and possibly altering other properties.\n\nIn this study, we used mutagenesis to introduce new potential Nglycosylation sites based on the model structures of the IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb4-IFN\u03bbR1 complex. Our results indicate that, among several IFN\u03bb4 variants, three -L28N, P73N, and L28N + P73N -exhibited enhanced productivity, although only P73N was glycosylated de novo. Moreover, these HEK293-expressed IFN\u03bb4 variants retained their binding affinity to the specific IL10R\u03b2 and IFN\u03bbR1 receptors, and showed a more potent IFN\u03bb4-mediated signaling and antiviral activity than did E. coli-derived IFN\u03bb4 (eIFN\u03bb4).\n\nThe human IFN\u03bb4 amino acid sequence (22~179, NCBI Accession Number: AFQ38559.1) was used in SWISS-MODEL homology modeling with three templates (PDB code: 5T5W.1.C, 3OG6.1.A, 3OG4.1.A). The model with the highest QMEAN-Z (Qualitative Model Energy ANalysis-Z) score (\u22122.56) was aligned to the IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb3-IFN\u03bbR1 structure (PDB code: 5T5W) to create the IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb4-IFN\u03bbR1 model.\n\nExpi293F (#A14527, Gibco\u00ae) cells were cultured according to ATCC guidelines and used within 6 months of receipt. They were maintained in suspension in Expi293F expression medium (#14351, Gibco\u00ae) at 37\u00b0C and 8% CO 2 with 125 rpm agitation. Huh-7.5 cells (Apath) were maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (WelGENE), 4.5 g/l glucose, L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (WelGENE). Smallinterfering RNAs (siRNAs) against IFN\u03bbR1 and scrambled sequences were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Transfection of IFN\u03bbR1 siRNA was performed using lipofectamine RNAi MAX (Invitrogen). Recombinant IFN-\u03b1-2a was obtained from PBL Assay Science, recombinant IFN-\u03b2 was obtained from PeproTech, and recombinant human IFN\u03bb1 (1598-IL), \u03bb2 (8417-IL), \u03bb3 (5259-IL), and eIFN\u03bb4 (9165-IL) were obtained from R&D Systems.\n\nGene encoding human IFN\u03bb4 (1~179) was cloned into a modified pcDNA3.1 (#V79020, Invitrogen\u2122) containing a C-terminal 6x-His tag. IFN\u03bb4 variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, #200519, Agilent) using the IFN\u03bb4 wild-type construct as the PCR template. The primers for site-directed mutagenesis are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . For IFN\u03bb4-Protein A expression, the C-terminal 6x-His in the IFN\u03bb4 constructs were replaced with a Protein A gene derived from PEZZ18 (#VPT4033, GE Healthcare life Sciences). A thrombin cleavage sequence (LVPRGS) was introduced between the IFN\u03bb4 genes and the Protein A gene using the PCR primer, in order to remove Protein A. IFN\u03bb4 wild-type and variants containing 6x-His or Protein A were transfected into Expi293F cells using ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Kits (#A14524, Invitrogen M ), following the manufacturer's protocol. For the purification of IFN\u03bb4 variants, the supernatant containing secreted IFN\u03bb4-Protein A was loaded onto IgG Sepharose resin (#17096902, GE Healthcare Life Sciences). After three washes with 1x PBS, the protein-bound resins were incubated overnight with thrombin (1% (v/v) in 1x PBS) at 4\u00b0C to remove the C-terminal Protein A tag. Eluted IFN\u03bb4 variants were subsequently purified by gel-filtration chromatography in a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (#28990944, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with 1x PBS.\n\nThe cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to prepare total cell lysates. Ten micrograms of each cell lysate were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels prior to immunoblotting. The antibodies used for immunoblotting were: IFN\u03bb4 \n\nN-glycans of IFN\u03bb4 were removed using a PNGase F kit (#P0704S, New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, IFN\u03bb4 variants were boiled with Glycoprotein Denaturing Buffer (10\u00d7) and chilled on ice. GlycoBuffer(10\u00d7), NP-40(10\u00d7), and 1 \u03bcl of PNGase F were added onto denatured proteins and the mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h before the Western blot analysis.\n\nThe glycopeptides resulting from non-specific digestion were prepared as previously described [16] . Briefly, 50 \u00b5g/\u00b5L IFN\u03bb4 variants were incubated with 50 \u00b5g/\u00b5L pronase E for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The digested glycopeptides were enriched by graphitized carbon solid-phase extraction (PGC-SPE) and analyzed by nanoLC-Chip Q-TOF MS (Agilent Technologies). The LC-MS and MS/MS data were processed and interpreted as previously described, using MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software (version B.07.00, Agilent Technologies) and GP Finder software [17] .\n\nThe IFN\u03bb4 variant binding kinetics to IFN\u03bbR1 and IL10R\u03b2 were measured by biolayer light interferometry on a BLItz system (ForteBio, Pall Life Sciences). The mixtures were agitated at 2200 rpm in washing buffer (200 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 5% glycerol, 0.01% Tween-20). Assays were performed at room temperature. Biotinylated IFN\u03bb4, at concentrations of 0.25 mg/ml, were loaded onto the surfaces of streptavidin biosensors (ForteBio) for 1 min, followed by washing of the loaded biosensors for 2 min with washing buffer (200 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 5% glycerol, 0.01% Tween-20) to remove any unbound protein. The biosensor tips were immersed in drops containing indicated concentration of IFN\u03bbR1 and IL10R\u03b2 (500, 1000 and 2000 nM). Associations (on rate, k on ) were measured over a 2 min interval. The sensors were subsequently immersed in washing buffer for 2 min to measure dissociation (off-rate, k off ). K D , measured in nanomoles, was calculated as the ratio of off-rate to on-rate. The resulting data were analyzed by fitting to a 1:1 ligand model with the global fitting function.\n\nThe Japanese fulminant hepatits-1 (JFH-1) strain (genotype 2a) of HCVcc was produced as described previously [18] . DMEM containing 5% human serum was used to culture the Huh-7.5 cells, in order to produce highly infectious JFH1 HCVcc. HCVcc infectivity was quantified by a colorimetric focus-forming assay, as described previously [19] . Huh-7.5 cells were infected with JFH-1 HCVcc at 0.5 multiplicity of infection (MOI).\n\nTotal RNA isolation and TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR were performed as described previously [20] . In brief, total RNA was isolated with GeneAll Ribospin\u2122 (GeneAll), after which TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) were used to determine the mRNA levels of the target genes. Quantification of intracellular HCV RNA copies was performed as described previously [20] . The results were standardized to the mRNA levels of GAPDH and the data are presented as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean. TaqMan Assay (Applied Biosystems) used in this study are: IFNLR1 (Hs00417120_m1), ISG15 (Hs01921425_s1), MX1 (Hs00895608_m1), SOCS1 (Hs00705164_s1), USP18 (Hs00276441_m1), GAPDH (Hs02758991_g1). IFNL proteins (R &D Systems) used in this study are: IFNL1 (1598-IL), IFNL2 (8417-IL), IFNL3 (5259-IL), eIFNL4 (9165-IL).\n\nData from experiments with cell lines are presented as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean. Unpaired t-tests or two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-tests were performed for statistical analysis. All of the analyses for real-time quantitative PCR were performed with GraphPad Prism version 7.01. P values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.\n\nThe low affinity of wild-type IFN\u03bb to its receptor, IL10R\u03b2, hampers the production of the stable ternary complex -IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb-IFN\u03bbR1. Therefore, only the structures of IFN\u03bb3 alone [21] or IFN\u03bb1 in complex with IFN\u03bbR1 [22] have been determined. Recently, Mendoza, et al., introduced affinity-enhancing mutations on IFN\u03bb3 which stabilized its interaction with IL10R\u03b2, and elucidated the crystal structure of the type III interferon signaling complex, IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb3-IFN\u03bbR1 (PDB code: 5T5W) (Fig. 1A ) [23] . Although IFN\u03bb4 shares only~30% sequence identity with IFN\u03bb1~3, the sequence alignment of IFN\u03bb1~4 suggests that IFN\u03bb4 interacts with IFN\u03bbR1 and IL10R\u03b2 in a similar manner as the IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb3-IFN\u03bbR1 ternary complex [23] for two reasons. First, the amino acids of the IFN\u03bb family that are critical for IFN\u03bbR1 binding are well-conserved in IFN\u03bb4 (P37, L40, K44, R47, D48, I108, F159, and R163) (Fig. 1B) . Second, hydroxyl groups of several aromatic residues of IL10R\u03b2 (Y59, Y82, Y140, and W143) form a hydrogen bonding network with IFN\u03bb3 (S44, L45, Q48R, and E106D); these are also well conserved in IFN\u03bb4 (S34, L35, R48, and Q100). Therefore, we modeled the IFN\u03bb4 structure using the crystal structure of IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb1 (Fig. 1A) and structurally aligned it to the IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb3-IFN\u03bbR1 structure to build the IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb4-IFN\u03bbR1 model (Fig. 1B) . Interestingly, the model structure of IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb4-IFN\u03bbR1 indicates that critical hydrophobic pockets for harboring the hydrophobic residues of IL10R\u03b2 (Y82 and W143) are well maintained on the surface of IFN\u03bb4 (Fig. 1C) .\n\nUsing the IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb4-IFN\u03bbR1 model structure, we searched the new N-glycosylation candidate sites of IFN\u03bb4 based on three criteria. First, the sites had to be outside the receptor binding region to minimize the change in the receptor-ligand binding and signal activation. Second, they had to be exposed to the solvent to allow access to oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), which catalyzes the initial transfer of glycan from the lipid-linked oligosaccharide onto the substrate asparagine [24, 25] . Third, the consensus sequence (NXS/T, X = any amino acid except proline) had to be achieved by single point mutation to minimize the structural distortion caused by the mutation. Only six candidate sites were available that met all three criteria : L28N, A54N, P73N, H97N , K154N, and A173N ( Fig. 1A and B) . We named them M1~M6, respectively. Next, we examined the expression levels of each of the IFN\u03bb4 variants (M1~M6) by western blot and found that two IFN\u03bb4 variants, M1 (L28N mutation) and M3 (P73N mutation), resulted in enhanced protein expression ( Fig. 2A) . Interestingly, only M3 showed the prominent up-shift in SDS-PAGE that indicates successful hyperglycosylation. We also checked the expression level of the double mutants (L28N and P73N, M7), showing further enhanced protein expression compared to M1 and M3 variants (Fig. 2A) . The constructs used in the western blot for hit discovery carried a C-terminus 6x Histidine tag, which may interfere with proper secretion of the protein, given the extensive distribution of positively-charged amino acids in IFN\u03bb4. Therefore, we substituted the 6x histidine tag with a protein A tag and purified three IFN\u03bb4 variants (M1, M3, and M7) using affinity chromatography followed by thrombin digestion, in order to remove the protein A tag and subsequent size exclusion chromatography. Final IFN\u03bb4 variants (M1, M3, and M7) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining under reducing and non-reducing condition. The resulting bands indicate that three IFN\u03bb4 variants (M1, M3, and M7) are monomer (Fig. 2B) . The elution profile of standard proteins indicates that each monodispersed peak corresponds to the IFN\u03bb4 variants (~44 kDa) (Fig. 2C ). Most likely, this oversized elution is due to the presence of N-glycosylation on IFN\u03bb4 variants, which was confirmed by the results shown in the following section.\n\nTo identify the presence of N-glycans on the three IFN\u03bb4 variants, we treated them with PNGase F and compared their sizes with SDS-PAGE. The M3 (P73N) and M7 (L28N + P73N) IFN\u03bb4 variants were located at higher molecular weight positions compared to the M1 (L28N) IFN\u03bb4 variant. After de-glycosylation with PNGase F, however, the molecular weight of the three IFN\u03bb4 variants decreased to the same level, indicating the presence of N-glycans in all IFN\u03bb4 variants, but the status or position of M1 N-glycosylation may be slightly different from those of M3 and M7 IFN\u03bb4 variants (Fig. 3A) .\n\nWe used mass spectrometry to determine the exact position of Nglycans on IFN\u03bb4 variants [26] . Briefly, purified IFN\u03bb4 variants were treated with pronase E to produce glycopeptides, and ultimately to determine the glycosylation site. The glycopeptides were then separated and analyzed by nanoLC-Chip Q-TOF MS. The LC/MS data indicate that the mutated L28N in M1 and M7 IFN\u03bb4 variants were not glycosylated, whereas an original N-glycosylation site, Asn61, and mutated P73N were fully occupied by N-glycans (Fig. 3B-D) . These are in accordance with the PNGase F treatment results, where M1 (L28N) migrated more quickly than either M3 (P73N) or M7 (L28N + P73N) .\n\nTo investigate whether the mutation and the additional glycan on IFN\u03bb4 variants affect their binding to their receptors, IL10R\u03b2 and IFN\u03bbR1, we examined the in vitro binding affinity of IFN\u03bb4 variants to IL10R\u03b2 and IFN\u03bbR1 by Biolayer Light Interferometry (BLI) and then compared them with that of IFN\u03bb4 WT purified from E. coli (eIFN\u03bb4). Similar to eIFN\u03bb4, the three IFN\u03bb4 variants properly bound to their receptors and their binding affinities to IFN\u03bbR1 were higher than to IL10R\u03b2 (Fig. 4) . Moreover, our variants had a slightly higher affinity towards IL10R\u03b2 than the eIFN\u03bb4 does (For IL10R\u03b2, K D M1 = 49 nM, K D M3 = 51 nM, K D M7 = 49 nM, K D eIFN\u03bb4 = 71 nM), while their binding affinity to IFN\u03bbR1 was similar to each other (For IFN\u03bbR1, K D M1 = 14 nM, K D M3 = 22 nM, K D M7 = 17 nM, K D eIFN\u03bb4 = 19 nM). The modifications elicited by mutation and glycosylation does not inhibit their interaction with their specific receptors, even further stabilize the interaction between IFN\u03bb4 and IL10R\u03b2.\n\nIn order to determine whether the mutation and additional glycan (caption on next page) (Fig. 5A ). IFN\u03bb4 stimulation reportedly leads to the assembly of the ISGF3 transcription factor complex, which consists of phospho-STAT1, phospho-STAT2, and IRF9 and induces the expression of ISG15 [27] , which is critical for anti-viral activity [28] . We showed that the M1, M3, and M7 IFN\u03bb4 variants also induced the expression of ISG15 and inhibited HCV replication in HCVinfected Huh-7.5 cells (Fig. 5B and 5C) . Interestingly, the M1, M3, and M7 IFN\u03bb4 variants showed a significantly more potent ISG induction and anti-viral activity than eIFN\u03bb4. IL10R\u03b2 are highlighted in green and cyan, respectively. Mutation sites for potential N-glycosylation are labeled from M1 to M6 and are boxed in orange. The endogenous N-glycosylation site for IFN\u03bb4 (N61, M0) is boxed in blue. Sequence conservation from the highest to lowest order is colored in red, blue, and black. The *IFN\u03bb3 sequence was obtained from the crystal structure of the IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb3-IFN\u03bbR1 complex [23] , which contains affinity-enhancing mutations on IFN\u03bb3 for stabilizing its interaction with IL10R\u03b2. (C) Binding mode of IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb4 towards IL10R\u03b2. The hydrogen bond network between IFN\u03bb3 and IL10R\u03b2 is shown and similar interactions between IFN\u03bb4 and IL10R\u03b2 are mapped based on the model structure of IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb4-IFN\u03bbR1 (left). Surface representation of binding sites for IL10R\u03b2 Y82 and W143 within IFN\u03bb3 [23] and IFN\u03bb4 (right). Hydrophobic residues are colored in orange and grey. Hydrophobic pockets for harboring the hydrophobic residues of IL10R\u03b2 (Y82, W143) were found within both IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb4. Prolonged exposure to IFN\u03bb proteins induces the production of unphosphorylated ISGF3 (U-ISGF3) consisting of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 without tyrosine phosphorylation while the expression of phosphorylated ISGF3 are diminished [18] . As a result, the upregulation of the U-ISGF3-specific set of genes, such as Mx1, is maintained long-term. In order to assess whether the M1, M3, and M7 variants display a similar functionality during prolonged treatment, we evaluated the protein levels of the U-ISGF3 components. The protein levels of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 were equally upregulated by all IFN\u03bb4s (Fig. 5D) . Nevertheless, our IFN\u03bb4 variants maintained the upregulation of Mx1 more robustly than did eIFN\u03bb4, but IFN\u03bb1, 2 and 3 maintained more strongly the upregulation of Mx1 expression compared to our IFN\u03bb4 variants (Fig. 5E ).\n\nPreviously, eIFN\u03bb4 is shown to induce the expression of negative regulators of IFN signaling [27, 29] such as SOCS1 and USP18. To assess the effect of glycosylation on this functionality, we examined the expression level of SOCS1 and USP18 upon the treatment of M1, M3 and M7 variants on Huh7 cell line. USP18 was significantly increased upon treatment of IFN\u03bb1, 2 and 3. While eIFN\u03bb4 resulted in slight increase of USP18, our IFN\u03bb4 variants (M1, M3 and M7) showed a comparable activity to IFN\u03bb1, 2 and 3 (Fig. 5F ). The protein expression of SOCS1 was not significantly increased by the treatment of any form of IFN\u03bbs (Fig. 5F ). However, the mRNA expression of SOCS1 was slightly upregulated by IFN\u03bbs, although there was no significant difference among IFN\u03bbs (Fig. 5G) . These results suggest that our structure-based approach on selecting de novo glycosylation maintained the biological activity of IFN\u03bb4 and our IFN\u03bb4 variants expressed from HEK293 have superior activity compared to eIFN\u03bb4.\n\nUntil recently, research on IFN\u03bb4 and its use as a clinical therapeutic was hindered by the inability to obtain appreciable amounts of this protein. Purification of bacterial-derived recombinant IFN\u03bb4 through refolding [11] still poses a number of problems, including the complexity of purification steps, lack of glycosylation, and endotoxin contamination. Our study is an example of how glycoengineering aided by structural information can be used to overcome such limitations; it is the first to report the successful production of IFN\u03bb4 protein from a mammalian cell line with enhanced properties compared to eIFN\u03bb4 and requiring a simpler purification protocol. There are several possibilities as to why our IFN\u03bb4 variants displayed enhanced expression and potency. First, the presence of acidic N-glycans may stabilize the protein through a charge-balance, since IFN\u03bb4 is unusually abundant with positively charged amino acids (~23%). Second, considering how the immune response is more actively triggered by our variants without critically affecting the receptor binding activity, compared to eIFN\u03bb4, extra N-glycans may have extended the half-life, as in other reports [12, 30] , thereby increasing the fraction of functional protein during treatment. Finally, since N-glycosylation in eukaryotes is co-translational [31] , the protein folding may have also been affected. Nevertheless, the mechanism behind the enhanced expression induced by unmodified L28N remains unanswered. We speculate that L28 may serve as the hydrophobic aggregation nuclei interacting with nearby hydrophobic residues, such as L29 or Y32 [32, 33] ; perhaps L28N alleviates this effect.\n\nThis study is unique, in that we were able to successfully identify a viable de novo N-glycosylation site by structural elucidation of glycopeptides. We used endogenous serine, threonine, or asparagine to introduce the glycosylation modification, which minimized the mutationinduced structural distortion. Other IFN\u03bb4 candidates containing Nglycosylation sites at random locations were also tested (data not shown) but no additional modification or expression changes were observed, indicating the efficiency of our structure-oriented approach. However, glyco-peptides containing L28N were not detected by mass spectrometry, suggesting that the site may have remained unmodified. According to the recent cryo-EM structure of oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) [34] [35] [36] , which catalyzes the initial transfer of glycan from the lipid-linked oligosaccharide onto the substrate asparagine, substrate binding to the catalytic subunit, STT3, requires structural flexibility near the glycosylation sequence of the substrate. Our IFN\u03bb4 model suggests that P73 is located on the flexible loop, while other eliminated candidate sites (A173 and K154) are part of the \u03b1-helix. This may partly explain the successful glycosylation of P73N. On the contrary, L28N may not be physically accessible by OST. Elucidating the structure of IFN\u03bb4 may provide insights to this hypothesis. A number of interferons are already targets of drug development, due to their ability to generate strong antiviral and antitumor responses or to modulate immune responses. IFN\u03b1 and its PEGylated variants are used against cancers such as hairy cell leukemia (Roferon A), melanoma (Multiferon), and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (Intron A) [37] [38] [39] . IFN\u03b2 is a well-known treatment for multiple sclerosis, with a number of different versions available (Rebif -IFN\u03b2 1a, liquid form, Avonex -IFN\u03b2 1a, lyophilized, Cinnovex -IFN\u03b2 1a, biogeneric, Betaseron -IFN\u03b2 1b, Plegridy -PEGylated IFN\u03b2 1a) [40] [41] [42] [43] . Similar to this, IFN\u03bbs also have a therapeutic potential, because it has been shown that IFN\u03bbs can protect hosts from various viruses, including influenza virus, West Nile virus, norovirus and rotavirus [38] [39] [40] [41] . It will be very interesting to test if glycosylated IFN\u03bbs exert anti-viral activity in hosts infected by such viruses. In this regard, a recent study demonstrated that IFN\u03bbs can suppress influenza virus without the inflammatory side effects of IFN\u03b1 [44] . However, it was previously shown that the expression of functional IFN\u03bb4 is associated with unresponsiveness to IFN\u03b1 treatment among HCV-infected patients [9] , and a subsequent study showed that long-term exposure to IFN\u03bb4 leads to cellular unresponsiveness to IFN\u03b1 treatment by upregulation of USP18 or SOCS1 [27, 29] , indicating that IFN\u03bb4 treatment may be detrimental to virus-infected patients. On the other hand, our result shown in Fig. 5C indicates that IFN\u03bb4 treatment can directly suppress HCV replication. Whether IFN\u03bb4 treatment will be beneficial or detrimental to virus-infected patients might be determined by duration of the treatment and use of IFN\u03b1 following IFN\u03bb4 treatment. Although much further research and insight into the mode of action of IFN\u03bb4 is required to understand if its effects are beneficial or detrimental to human health, our engineered IFN\u03bb4 variants can be utilized as an alternative platform of IFN\u03bb4 wild-type.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to "}
