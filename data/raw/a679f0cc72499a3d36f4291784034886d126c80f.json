{"title": "IL-12 and Viral Infections", "body": "The elaboration of cytokines by distinct cell types and their activities on either themselves \"autocrine# or on neighboring or more distant cells \"paracrine and systemic\\ respectively# has been well documented as a part of both speci_c and innate immune responses[ The cell surface receptors and the intracellular signal transduction path! ways have been elucidated for many of these molecules \u00f00\u00d02\u0141[ The cytokines secreted in response to a variety of stimuli have been used to de_ne distinct subsets \"for example\\ CD3\\ Th1 cells are characterized to produce IL! 3\\ IL!4\\ IL!09#[ However\\ almost exclusively\\ studies such as these have been performed using cells of the hem! atopoietic lineages \"e[g[ lymphocytes and macrophages#[ Many cytokines are produced or responded to by cells of other lineages[ There is a growing body of literature of regulated cytokine gene expression in the CNS both by parenchymal cells in addition to in~ammatory mono! nuclear cells \u00f03\u0141[ This has been observed for autoimmune diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and its animal model\\ Department 166 experimental allergic encephalitis\\ as well as in response to bacterial and viral infections \u00f04\u00d06\u0141[ Cytokines may be elaborated to recruit and activate circulating mono! nuclear cells\\ but it also appears that resident par! enchymal cells both synthesize cytokines and respond to them \u00f03\\ 7\\ 8\u0141[ In order to respond to cytokines\\ cells must express receptors and also have the necessary signal transduction machinery for communicating receptor occupancy \u00f00\u00d0 2\u0141[ Subsequently\\ there must be a change in the gene expression of the cell\\ in response to the cytokine ligand! receptor binding[ In some cases\\ cytokines deliver a di}erentiating or activating signal[ Alternatively\\ in the case of TNF!a action for many cells\\ for instance\\ the response may be to initiate the apoptosis cascade \u00f009\u00d001\u0141[ There is abundant evidence of tissue pathology\\ including cell death\\ in the CNS associated with in~ammatory cyto!

induced activation of the cell takes place[ Receptor! mediated cascades lead to phosphorylation of STATs by members of the Jak:Tyk family of tyrosine kinases and subsequent homo! or hetero! dimerization[ The dimers are able to translocate to the nucleus where transcription is initiated \u00f00\u00d02\\ 49\u0141[ Of all the cytokines and growth factors examined to date\\ STAT3 has uniquely been found to be phos! phorylated by IL!01 \u00f037\u0141[ Other stimuli are more pro! miscuous or overlapping in their STAT activation in lymphocytes \u00f00\u00d02\u0141[ Mice de_cient in STAT3 have been developed and initially examined for functional responses \u00f040\u0141[ They appear to be de_cient in Th0 responses and su.cient in Th1 responses to speci_c Ags[ STAT5 knock! out mice are able to mount Th0 responses but not Th1\\ from which it was concluded that STAT5 is essential for the IL!3 response \u00f041\u0141[ Mice de_cient in Jak1 have recently been described to be embryonic lethal^they have impaired erythropoiesis\\ so that the impact of this de_ciency on cytokine signaling in lymphocytes cannot easily be de_ned \u00f042\\ 43\u0141[\n\nLike bacterial infections of Ag presenting cells\\ viral infections rapidly induce IL!01 gene expression and immunoreactive material \u00f044\u00d046\u0141[ In the CNS\\ infection rapidly induces IL!01 expression and also IL!01 treat!
