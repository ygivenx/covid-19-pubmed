Synthesis and Biological Activity of Ethyl 5-Hydroxy-1-Methyl-2-(Trans-2-Phenylcyclopropyl)-1H-Indole-3-Carboxylate", "body": "\n1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AM-360 and AV-600 instruments with TMS as internal standard. HPLC-MS analysis was carried out using an Agilent 1200 instrument. HPLC of umifenovir was carried out under the following conditions: Reprosil-Pur Basic C18 column 250\u00d74.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, with a precolumn. Eluents: A) CF3COOH\u2013H2O (113 \u03bcl per liter), B) CF3COOH\u2013MeCN (113 \u03bcl per liter). Gradient 0-20 min, 5 to 100% B. HPLC of compound 3 was performed using the following conditions: Vodac Denali C18 120A column, 250\u00d74.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, with a precolumn. Eluents: A) CF3COOH\u2013H2O (113 \u03bcl per liter), B) CF3COOH\u2013MeCN (113 \u03bcl per liter). Gradient 0-30 min, 40 to 70% B. The flow rate for all of the HPLC analyses was 1 ml/min. Detectors UV (\u03bb 220 nm) and ELSD. All mass-spectrometric analysis used electrospray ionization. Elemental analysis was carried out on a Vario EL Cube apparatus. The halogen content was determined by combustion of a sample of the material in a flask filled with oxygen and using visual mercurometric titration with alkaline hydrogen peroxide solution as absorbent. A separate determination of chloride anion was carried out by the argentometric method. Melting points were measured by the capillary method using a Buchi M-565 apparatus with a heating rate of 1\u00b0C/min (corrected values are given). TLC was carried out on Merck Alufolien Kieselgel 60 F254 and visualized by UV light at 254 nm. Column chromatography used Alfa Aesar L14002 silica gel of size 0.06-0.20 mm (70-230 mesh). All of the syntheses used Alfa Aesar and Acros Organics chemical reagents and solvents. Solvents were dried by standard methods [11].\n\nThe antiviral studies were carried out using methods [8\u201310]. Cell colonies were made available by the Catholic University at Leuven in Belgium.\n\n\nEthyl 6-bromo-4-(dimethylamino)methyl-5-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-(phenylsulfanyl)methyl-1\nH\n-indole- 3-carboxylate hydrochloride monohydrate (umifenovir) was prepared by the previously reported method [12].

A solution of trans-2-phenylcyclo-propane-1-carbazide (1) in anhydrous CH2Cl2 was prepared from trans-2-phenylcyclopropane-1-carbohydrazide (20.0 g, 113 mmol) by method [7] using CH2Cl2 (550 ml) in place of PhMe. It was added dropwise with stirring and cooling in an ice bath to a solution of the 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (Meldrum's acid) (16.3 g, 113 mmol) and (i-Pr)2NEt (60 ml, 46.9 g, 363 mmol) in absolute CH2Cl2 (160 ml). The reaction mixture was left overnight at room temperature and poured onto a mixture of crushed ice (250 g) and conc. HCl (40 ml). The organic phase was separated, washed with 1 N HCl (3\u00d7120 ml), water (3\u00d7100 ml), and dried over MgSO4. After filtration from the desiccant, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was treated with activated carbon (2.5 g) in absolute EtOH (250 ml). The mixture was refluxed with protection from moisture until gas evolution ceased (about 2.5 h). The product was filtered, solvent was distilled off, and the residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (400 ml), washed with 5% aqueous NaHCO3 solution (4\u00d775 ml) and then water (3\u00d775 ml), and dried over MgSO4. The dried solution was filtered, the filtrate was evaporated, and the residue was distilled under reduced pressure. The yield (calculated on the trans-2-phenylcyclopropane-1-carbo-hydrazide) was 17.1 g (65%). Colorless oil. Bp 156-158\u00b0C (2 mm Hg) (138-140\u00b0C (0.2 mm Hg) [15]).

A 33% solution of MeNH2 in anhydrous EtOH (2 ml, 16 mmol of MeNH2) was treated with glacial AcOH (1 ml, 1.04 g, 16 mmol), 1,4-benzoquinone (1.08 g, 10 mmol), and ester 2 (2.32 g, 10 mmol) dissolved in absolute EtOH (17 ml). The mixture obtained was refluxed for 16 h. The solvent was distilled off, and the residue was dissolved in EtOAc (150 ml), washed with water (3\u00d775 ml), saturated aqueous NaCl solution (4\u00d775 ml), and dried over MgSO4. The product was filtered and silica gel added (15 g). The obtained mixture was evaporated to dryness and the product (absorbed on silica gel) was transferred to a chromatographic column. The target product was purified by gravity elution of the silica gel column (50\u00d7600 mm) with EtOAc in hexane (gradient from 5 to 30%) as an eluent. The fractions containing the target product were combined, evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue was triturated with Et2O, filtered, and dried to constant weight. Yield 0.94 g (28%).
