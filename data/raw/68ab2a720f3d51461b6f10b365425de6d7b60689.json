{"title": "Biological and genetic analysis of a bovine-like coronavirus isolated from water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) calves", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae) are enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA particles that are responsible for enteric and/or respiratory disease in mammals and birds. Their ability to evolve through genetic recombination and/or point mutation is well-known so that they give rise to new viral genotypes or mutants with different tissue or host tropism. Currently, CoVs are organized into three antigenic groups with group 2 including bovine-like (subgroup 2a) and SARS-like (subgroup 2b) viruses. Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) belongs to subgroup 2a together with mouse hepatitis virus, sialodacryadenitis virus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43, human enteric coronavirus (HECV) 4408 (Enjuanes et al., 2000) and the newly recognized equine coronavirus (ECoV) (Guy et al., 2000) , HCoV-HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005) , and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) (Decaro et al., 2007a; Erles et al., 2003) . There are multiple genetic and antigenic evidences that several subgroup 2a CoVs, such as HCoV-OC43, HECV-4408, PHEV and CRCoV, have arisen as a consequence of trans-species infections caused by BCoV (Zhang et al., 1994; Vijgen et al., 2005 Vijgen et al., , 2006 Erles et al., 2007) . BCoV can cause severe diarrhea in newborn calves (Snodgrass et al., 1986) , \"winter dysentery\" in adult cows (Cho et al., 2000; Saif et al., 1991) and respiratory tract illness in calves and cows (Lathrop et al., 2000; Storz et al., 2000) . The same virus strain could be responsible for simultaneous appearance of enteric and respiratory disease in the same animals (Chouljenko et al., 2001) as well as in both calves and cows (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 2001) . BCoV infection is responsible for severe economic losses in cattle herds due to decreased milk production in dairy cows and reduced weight gain in beef calves (Saif et al., 1998) , with generally low mortality rates.\n\nWater buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) represents a ruminant species important in the economy of several countries, including Brazil, India, Vietnam and some regions of southern Italy, where the breed Mediterranean Italian buffalo produces high quality milk employed for production of the buffalo \"mozzarella cheese\" (Romano et al., 2001) . Recently, bovine-like CoVs have been identified in wild or domesticated ruminants, including several species of deer, waterbuck antelope (Tsunemitsu et al., 1995) , giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) , alpaca (Lama pacos) (Jin et al., 2007) and sable antelope (Hippotragus niger) (Spiro D., R. Halpin, S. Wang, M. Hasoksuz, X. Zhang, K. Alekseev, A. Vlasova, D. Janies, E. Ghedin, and L. Saif, unpublished) . However, CoVs have never been isolated from buffaloes, although there is a single report on the detection of BCoV antibodies in Bulgarian buffaloes by hemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization tests (Muniiappa et al., 1985) . In the same report, hemagglutinating activity which could be suppressed by a BCoV-specific bovine serum was also demonstrated in some bubaline fecal samples. In this paper, we describe the isolation and biological and genomic characterization of a bovine-like coronavirus from a buffalo herd affected by severe diarrhea and calf mortality.\n\nThe outbreak occurred between October 2006 and April 2007 in a herd of Mediterranean Italian buffalo (B. bubalis) in Campania (southern Italy). No cattle, sheep or goat farms were present in the vicinity of the outbreak. At that time the herd consisted of 460 buffaloes, including 215 lactating cows, all vaccinated against colibacillosis, clostridiosis and salmonellosis. Buffalo calves were removed from their dams shortly after their birth and placed in separate hutches according to the gender where they were hand-fed fresh colustrum for 5 days. Neonatal mortality was firstly observed in October 2006 in 30 5-to 20-day-old calves (out of 40 newborns) that displayed severe diarrhea and died despite treatment with antibiotics (oxytetracyclin and amoxicillin). Simultaneously, gastroenteric disease was also observed in older calves (1-3 months of age). On April 2007, neonatal mortality and enteric signs in calves persisted and two carcasses of 20-day-old dead calves together with fecal samples from additional 17 diseased calves were submitted to our laboratory for routine analysis.\n\nAt necropsy, the carcasses of the two dead buffalo calves showed severe gastroenteritis, with enlargement of the mesenteric lymph nodes and gall bladder. By conventional RT-PCR (Erles et al., 2003) , bovine-like CoV RNA was detected in the intestinal content of the dead animals as well as in all 17 fecal samples from calves with diarrhea. Sequence analysis of the Sgene fragments showed a 100% nucleotide identity among the CoV strains detected in different animals. Gastrointestinal parasites of ruminants, including Cryptosporidium spp., were not detected by zinc sulfate flotation or Ziehl Nielsen staining, whereas by bacteriological investigations only common bacteria with poor pathogenic significance (E. coli, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp.) were isolated from the intestinal contents or fecal samples. Using real-time RT-PCR, bovine-like CoV RNA was detected at low titers in the intestinal contents of the dead animals, whereas higher viral loads were found in the fecal samples of calves with diarrhea, with a peak of 5.23 \u00d7 10 7 RNA copies/\u03bcl of template in calf 179/07-11 (Table 1) .\n\nThe fecal sample of calf 179/07-11 was used for virus isolation attempts on human rectal tumor (HRT-18) and Madin Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. Cytopathic effect (CPE) consisting of syncytia formation and subsequent cell lysis was evident at the 2nd passage on HRT-18 cells (Fig. 1A) , where the growth of a bovine-like CoV was confirmed by the cytoplasmic fluorescence detected by the IF assay using a BCoV-specific serum ( Fig. 1B) . At the 5th passage on HRT cells the viral titer reached values of 10 6.25 TCID 50 /50 \u03bcl of viral suspension and 1.97 \u00d7 10 8 RNA copies/ml of template, as calculated by the Karber's method and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. Replication of strain 179/07-11 in MDBK cells was not as efficient as in HRT-18 cells, considering that CPE was not observed on MDBK monolayers and only few positive cells were detected by the IF assay at the 1st passage, with viral titers (as calculated by real-time RT-PCR) decreasing progressively in the subsequent passages until defi-nitive loss of the replication ability. MDBK cells were confirmed to be poorly permissive to 179/07-11 replication even when the HRT-18 cell-cultured virus was inoculated.\n\nThe isolated strain was evaluated by assessment of hemagglutination (HA) and receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) activities in comparison with the BCoV isolates 339/06 (Decaro et al., 2007b) , 438/06-2 (Decaro et al., in press) and 9WBL7 (kindly provided by Dr Paolo Cordioli, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Brescia, Italy). All isolates agglutinated mouse erythrocytes at titers higher at 4\u00b0C than at 37\u00b0C. The bovine isolates caused HA with chicken erythrocytes at low titers at both 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, whereas the bubaline strain 179/07-11 did not hemagglutinate those cells despite the high HA titers obtained with mouse red blood cells (Table 2) . Using mouse erythrocytes, RDE activity (loss of the HA pattern formed at 4\u00b0C) was observed for the bovine and bubaline isolates (Table 2) .\n\nA 9.6-kb region encompassing the entire 3\u2032 end of the viral genome (from the 32-kDa to nucleocapsid protein genes) was determined through PCR amplification and subsequent sequencing of overlapping fragments. At the 3\u2032 end of viral RNA, bubaline CoV strain 179/07-11 had the same genomic organization of other ruminant CoVs (Fig. 2) . Nine ORFs were identified by both ORF Finder program and sequence comparison with reference ruminant CoV sequences. All predicted ORFs but the 4.8-kDa gene were preceded by a repeated intergenic sequence, CUAAAC or CCAAAC, which is predicted to interact with the viral polymerase during the discontinuous transcription of the negative strand subgenomic RNA of the Nidovirales members (Table 3) . Table 4 shows the unique aa changes encountered in the encoded proteins of strain 179/07-11 with respect to other ruminant CoVs. The predicted 32-kDa nonstructural protein (nsp) had the same length (278 aa) as most other bovine-like CoVs, including ruminant CoVs giraffe coronavirus (GiCoV), alpaca coronavirus (ACoV) and sable antelope coronavirus (SACoV), as well as CRCoV and HCoV-OC43. Three aa changes were found to be unique to strain 179/07-11. The highest aa identity (98.9%) of the 32-kDa protein of strain 179/07-11 was found to enteric and respiratory BCoVs, as well as to ACoV. The hemagglutininesterase (HE) protein (424 aa) showed three unique aa mutations in comparison with other ruminant CoVs and it was more closely related (99% aa identity) to BCoVs DB2 and ENT and SACoV. By analysis with the NetNglyc server, the HE of strain 179/07-11 was found to contain nine potential N-glycosylation sites, analogously to BCoV reference strains. Moreover, the predicted site for neuraminidate-O-acetylesterase activity, FGDS, was detected at the N-terminus. The spike (S) protein was long 1363 aa and matched the best aa identity (98.1%) to BCoV-E-AH65 and SACoV-US/OH1/03. Twenty-one potential N-glycosylation sites were identified throughout the protein, one more than other ruminant CoVs, due to the presence of an additional Nglycosylation site, NLS, at position 1260. No deletions or insertions were observed in strain 179/07-11 compared with bovine-like CoVs. Also, the aa stretch KRRSRR, responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of the S protein at residue 768 into subunits S1 and S2, was conserved. In comparison to ruminant CoV reference strains, 16 unique residues were identified in the S protein of strain 179/07-11. Nsp 4.9 kDa was 43-aa long as for BCoVs Mebus, Quebec and DB2 and HECV-4408, whereas in other ruminant CoVs it is BuCoV-179/07-11 truncated in the C-terminus (only 29 aa in length). The length of nsp 4.8 kDa was 45 aa as for HECV-4408 and ruminant CoVs with the exception of GiCoVand SACoV (38 aa). Nsp 12.7 kDa showed the same size as for HECV-4408 and ruminant CoVs (109 aa), although BCoV Quebec exhibits a truncate form of the protein (87 aa). In the three nonstructural proteins, strain 179/07-11 displayed the highest identity to HECV-4408, with three, seven and one unique residues in nsp 4.9 kDa, 4.8 kDa and 12.7 kDa, respectively. The envelope (E) protein was 84-aa long exactly as BCoV and GiCoV but 1-aa shorter and 2-aa longer than the analogous protein of ACoV and SACoV, respectively. No residue unique to the bubaline strain was detected at this level. A 100% aa identity in the E protein was found between the bubaline strain and GiCoV and most BCoV strains, with the exception of BCoV-Mebus (98.8%), whereas the bubaline isolate was slightly less related to ACoV and SACoV. The membrane (M) protein was 220-aa long and contained two unique residues, with the I58L change shared with HECV-4408. In this protein the highest identity (99.5%) was matched to HECV-4408. One potential N-glycosylation and four potential Oglycosylation sites were detected at the N-terminus of the M protein, as for all bovine-like CoVs including the closely related HECV-4408, with which the bubaline isolates shared an aa mutation with respect to other ruminant CoVs. However, both programs indicated that M gene sequence of the ruminant CoVs might not contain a signal peptide. Proteins without signal peptides are unlikely to be exposed to the O-glycosylation and Nglycosylation machineries and thus may not be glycosylated in vivo even though they contain potential motifs. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of strain 179/07-11 had a length of 448 aa and was closely related (99.3% of aa identity) to BCoV-DB2. Two unique aa changes were found in comparison to other bovine-like viruses. The I protein (207 aa) encoded by the N-gene internal ORF showed four unique residues and the best aa identity (96.1%) to BCoV reference strains Mebus, Quebec and DB2. When the 9.6-kb sequence corresponding to the 3\u2032 end of CoV genome was analyzed, the bubaline strain showed over 97.6% nt identity to BCoV strains and other ruminant CoVs, whereas it was less genetically related to other bovine-like CoVs, including CRCoV (96.5% nt identity), HCoV-OC43 (91.4%), HECV-4408 (85.1%) and PHEV-VW572 (83.1%). Phylogenetic analysis with the structural protein HE showed that the bubaline strain 179/07-11 clusters together with the bovine-like CoVs, being more related to ruminant viruses (Fig. 3) . Similar phylogenetic trees were generated for the other proteins (data not shown) but the M protein, where strain 179/ 07-11 forms a separate cluster with HECV-4408 into the bovine subgroup (Fig. 3) .\n\nIn order to better define the taxonomic position of the bubaline CoV 179/07-11, a sequence comparison between BCoV reference strain ENT and ruminant CoVs GiCoV, ACoV, SACoV and the bubaline strain was conduced in the nonstructural and structural proteins (Table 5 ). For such a comparison, strain ENT was chosen among the available BCoV sequences as it is an enteric strain isolated very recently (Chouljenko et al., 2001) . The results showed that strain 179/07-11 is less related to BCoV-ENT than to other ruminant CoVs in all major structural and nonstructural proteins, whereas closer relationship (98.8% aa identity) to BCoV-ENT with respect to SACoV (97.6% aa identity) was found only in the E protein. Analysis of the nt sequence cor-responding to the entire 3\u2032 end of CoV genome confirmed that the bubaline strain has a lower genetic relationship (97.8% nt identity) to the reference BCoV than other recently isolated ruminant CoVs (99.1-99.3% nt identity). Confirmation of the conclusions drawn from Table 5 was derived with the use of SimPlot analysis.\n\nIn the present report, a bovine-like CoV in water buffalo (B. bubalis) has been described, along with its biological and genetic characterization. The bubaline strain was detected in the feces of buffalo calves with severe gastroenteritis, causing the death of at least 30 animals. A virus (strain 179/07-11) antigenically related to BCoV was isolated on HRT-18 cells, producing CPE typical of BCoV and being recognized by a BCoV-specific serum in an IF assay. Analysis of the biological properties of the bubaline strain showed that, unlike classical BCoV strains (Fukutomi et al., 1999) , the virus was not able to replicate efficiently on MDBK cells or cause hemagglutination with chicken erythrocytes. However, Benfield and Saif (1990) demonstrated that winter dysentery strains of BCoV from adult cattle were also unable to replicate in MDBK cells. Among wild ruminant CoVs, only few strains have been characterized at a biological level. GiCoV displayed HA activity also with chicken erythrocytes at a temperature of 4\u00b0C, whereas no data are available about its replication efficiency on MDBK cells . Using chicken erythrocytes, other ruminant CoVs, including the waterbuck, sambar deer and white-tailed deer isolates and some BCoV strains, exhibited very low HA titers at 4\u00b0C and no HA activity at 37\u00b0C. Thus, the loss of ability to replicate on MDBK cells and to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes appears as characteristic of the bubaline CoV with respect to the other ruminant CoVs.\n\nSequence analysis of the 3\u2032 end of the viral genome showed that strain 179/07-11 has a genomic organization similar to BCoV, including the presence of three ORFs encoding for small nonstructural proteins between the S and E genes. Moreover, the virus has a close genetic relatedness to the bovine CoV subgroup in the major structural and nonstructural proteins. However, as shown by sequence and SimPlot analyses, the genetic distance between the bubaline virus and reference BCoV strain ENT was approximately the same or even higher than observed between the BCoV strain and other ruminant CoVs. Unique aa substitutions were detected in all proteins of the bubaline virus but they were mainly within the S protein (Table 4 ). As observed in BCoV (Chouljenko et al., 1998) , GiCoV and ACoV (Jin et al., 2007) , these changes occurred mostly in the S1 subunit which has been proven to be involved in receptor binding and host specificity in the well-characterized MHV (de Haan et al., 2006) . Certain residues in the S protein had been associated to enteric or respiratory tropism of BCoV, including residues 531, 769 and 1026 (Chouljenko et al., 1998) . The bubaline strain displayed the same aa residues encountered in enteric BCoVs in only one position (D531). The remaining two aa residues (S769, G1026) suggest a potential respiratory tropism, which is in contrast with the exclusive enteric clinical pattern observed in water buffalo. However, more recent Table 5 Sequence identity (%) of ruminant CoVs to reference BCoV-ENT in nonstructural and structural proteins and in the full-length sequence of the genomic RNA 3\u2032 end (9.6 kb) analysis of two enteric and respiratory BCoV pairs failed to identify specific aa residue determinants in the S proteins as well as in other structural and nonstructural proteins, except for a T22I mutation in nsp 4.8 kDa . Interestingly, strain 179/07-11 showed the same aa determinant T22 as the enteric BCoV strains. Other authors have identified a truncated form of nsp 4.9 kDa (29 instead of 43 aa) as a genetic marker for the respiratory tropism (Gelinas et al., 2001; Vijgen et al., 2006) . The bubaline strain presented an intact nsp 4.9 kDa as enteric BCoVs, but even this aa deletion has been recently shown not to be involved in tissue tropism (Zhang et al., 1994) . Based on the unique biological properties and the more distant relatedness of strain 179/07-11 to BCoV with respect to other ruminant CoVs, we propose to designate this strain as prototype of a host-range variant of BCoV, namely bubaline CoV (BuCoV). With regard to the its possible origin, BuCoV may have arisen through interspecies transmission of a BCoV strain from cattle to water buffaloes, although no recent contacts with cattle or other ruminants were reported. This hypothesis is supported by the high genetic relatedness between BuCoV and BCoV. Moreover, it should be considered that a bovine origin has been strongly suggested for other group 2 CoVs less genetically related to BCoV, such as HCoV-OC43 (Vijgen et al., 2005) , PHEV (Vijgen et al., 2006) and CRCoV (Erles et al., 2007) .\n\nAccumulation of point mutations, as well as small insertions and deletions in coding and non-coding sequences, are the dominant forces in the microevolution of plus-stranded (+) RNA viruses, resulting in proliferation of virus strains, serotypes and subtypes (Dolja and Carrington, 1992) . Coronaviruses are thought to mutate at high frequency like most RNA viruses as a consequence of high error rates of the RNA polymerase that are predicted to accumulate several base substitutions per round of replication (Jarvis and Kirkegaard, 1991; Lai and Holmes, 2001) . Changes in tissue tropisms and/or interspecies transmission of CoVs occur through genetic variations in structural and/or nonstructural proteins (Laude et al., 1993; Vennema et al., 1998; Guan et al., 2003; Rottier et al., 2005; Song et al., 2005; Vijgen et al., 2005; Decaro et al., 2007c) . Genetic determinants that may have caused the cattle-to-buffalo interspecies transmission have not been identified so far. Although this study has detected a CoV strain in buffalo calves with severe diarrhea, the pathogenicity of this virus and its etiologic role in enteric disease of water buffalo still have to be determined more definitively. In addition, epidemiological studies could assess whether BuCoV is widespread among water buffalo herds as well as whether cross-species transmission between buffalo and cattle occurs mainly in areas where both closely related ruminant species are raised intensively.\n\nNucleic acids for (RT-)PCR assays were purified using the commercial kits DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN S.p.A., Milan, Italy) and QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen S.p.A., Milan, Italy) from the fecal samples and intestinal contents and QIAamp\u00ae RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen S.p.A.) from the tissue samples.\n\nRNA extracts were used for detection of BCoV (Erles et al., 2003) , toroviruses (Hoet et al., 2002) , rotaviruses (Gouvea et al., 1994) , caliciviruses (Jiang et al., 1999) , bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) (Sullivan and Akkina, 1995) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (Valarcher et al., 1999) . Detection of bovine herpesvirus types 1 (BoHV-1) (Vilcek, 1993) and 4 (BoHV-4) (Boerner et al., 1999) was carried out on the DNA templates. RT-PCR and PCR assays were performed using SuperScript\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR for Long Templates (Life Technologies) and LA PCR Kit Ver. 2.1 (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan), respectively.\n\nThe samples were examined for bacterial and parasitic pathogens by standardized methods. For bacteriological investigations, the fecal samples were plated out on 5% sheep blood agar and cultured aerobically at 37\u00b0C for 24 h to exclude the presence of aerobic pathogens. One hundred milligrams of fecal samples was resuspended in 900 \u03bcl of fluid thioglycolate medium (FTG). Ten-fold dilutions (10 \u2212 2 to 10 \u2212 8 ) were subsequently plated onto 5% sheep blood agar and egg yolk agar with Dcycloserine 400 \u03bcg/ml. Bacteria were allowed to grow overnight at 37\u00b0C in anaerobic condition. Detection of the most common enteric parasites was achieved using zinc sulfate flotation. The Ziehl Nielsen staining was also performed on fecal samples or intestinal sections for detection of Cryptosporidium spp.\n\nA real-time RT-PCR assay based on TaqMan technology (G. Elia et al., manuscript in preparation) was used to quantify the viral load in samples tested positive for bovine-like CoVs by conventional RT-PCR (Erles et al., 2003) . The TaqMan assay had been proven to be able to detect BCoV as well as the closely related CRCoV (Elia et al., manuscript in preparation) . BCoV-like RNA copy numbers were calculated on the basis of the standard curves generated by 10-fold dilutions of a synthetic RNA obtained by in vitro transcription of a plasmid containing the M gene of BCoV strain 339/07 (Decaro et al., 2007b) . Reverse transcription was carried out using GeneAmp\u00ae RNA PCR (Applied Biosystems, Applera Italia, Monza, Italy), following the manufacturer's recommendations. The quantitative assay targeting the M gene was conducted in a 50-\u03bcl reaction mixture containing 25 \u03bcl of IQ\u2122 Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories Srl), 600 nM of primers BCoV-F (CCTTCATATCTATACACATCAAGTTGTT) and BCoV-R (ACCAGCCATTTTAAATCCTTCA), 200 nM of probe BCoV-Pb (6FAM \u2212 CCTTCATATCTATACACAT-CAAGTTGTT-BHQ1) and 20 \u03bcl of c-DNA. The thermal profile consisted of activation of iTaq DNA polymerase at 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and annealing extension at 60\u00b0C for 1 min.\n\nVirus isolation was carried out on the buffalo fecal sample containing the highest RNA titer of BCoV-like coronavirus (strain 179/07-11), as determined by real-time RT-PCR. Feces were homogenized in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (D-MEM) containing antibiotics (penicillin 5000 IU/ml, streptomycin 2500 \u03bcg/ml, amphotericin B 10 \u03bcg/ml). After centrifugation at 3000\u00d7g for 15 min, the supernatant was used to inoculate confluent monolayers of HRT-18 and MDBK cells in the presence of trypsin (5 \u03bcg/ml). Viral growth was monitored by an immunofluorescence (IF) assay using a BCoV-positive bovine serum and a rabbit anti-bovine IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma Aldrich srl, Milan, Italy).\n\nTwo-fold dilutions (starting from dilution 1:2) of the supernatant of the CoV-infected HRT-18 cells tested positive by the IF assay were made in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) using 96-well V-plates. Mouse (0.8%) or chicken (0.4%) erythrocytes were added to each dilution. Results were read after 1 h at 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C and expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution producing HA. The plates were then incubated for additional 4 h at 37\u00b0C to assess RDE activity, which was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of virus resulting in complete disappearance of HA (Hasoksuz et al., 1999) .\n\nThe 3\u2032 end of the genome of strain 179/07-11 was amplified from the original fecal sample using SuperScript\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR for Long Templates (Life Technologies, Invitrogen.\n\nMilan, Italy), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thirteen partially overlapping fragments encompassing from the very 3\u2032 end of ORF1b to the 5\u2032 end of the untranslated region (UTR) were amplified using primer pairs designed on conserved regions among BCoV-like group 2 coronaviruses (Table 6) .\n\nThe PCR-amplified products were sequenced by Genome Express (Meylan, France) and the obtained sequences were assembled and analyzed using the BioEdit software package (Hall, 1999) and the NCBI's (htttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and EMBL's (http://www.ebi.ac.uk) analysis tools. Additional RT-PCR assays and sequencing attempts were performed to close gaps between assembled contigs using strain-specific primers. ORFs contained in the amplified genomic region were determined either with the ORF Finder tool of NCBI or on the basis of the similarity to known coronavirus proteins. The ORFs identified in this manner were translated and the predicted amino acid (aa) sequences were saved as individual files for further analyses. Putative N-glycosylation sites were predicted using the NetNglyc 1.0 Server program (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/ services/NetNGlyc/), whereas the NetOGlyc 3.1 Server program (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc/) was used for prediction of O-linked glycosylation sites. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using Mega3 (Kumar et al., 2004) . Phylogenetic trees, based on the nonstructural 32-kDa protein, on the structural spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins and on the genomic RNA 3\u2032 end (9.6 kb) of CoV strain 179/07-11, were elaborated using both parsimony and neighbor-joining methods, supplying a statistical support with bootstrapping over 1000 replicates.\n\nThe SimPlot program (version 3.2) was used to analyze the genetic distance of the 3\u2032 end of the genomes of ruminant CoVs, including the bubaline strain, in reference to the same region of BCoV strain ENT and this genetic distance was plotted versus nucleotide (nt) positions (Lole et al., 1999) .\n\nThe nt sequence of the bubaline strain 179/07-11 has been deposited in GenBank under accession number EU019216."}
