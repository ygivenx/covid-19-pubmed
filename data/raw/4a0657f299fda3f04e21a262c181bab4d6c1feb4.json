{"title": "VIRUS ENTRY INTO ANIMAL CELLS", "body": "In addition to its many other functions, the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells serves as a barrier against invading parasites and viruses. It is not permeable to ions and to low molecular weight solutes, let alone to proteins and polynucleotides. Yet it is clear that viruses are capable of transporting their genome and accessory pro-teins into the cytosol or into the nucleus, and thus infect the cell. While the detailed mechanisms remain unclear for most animal viruses, a general theme is apparent like other stages in the replication cycle, entry depends intimately on the activities of the host cell. In order to take up nutrients, to communicate with other cells, to control the intracellular ion balance, and to secrete substances, cells have devised a variety of mechanisms for bypassing and modifying the barrier properties imposed by their plasma membrane. It is these mechanisms, and the molecules involved in them, that most viruses seem to exploit. The host cell provides surface receptors, endocytic activities, triggers for penetration, intracellular transport, and so on, and the viruses take advantage of these during infection. It follows that our understanding of early virus-cell interactions depends on progress in cell biology, physiology, and aspects of molecular biology which at first glance may appear to be only remotely pertinent.\n\nThe early phases of viral infection have remained a relatively neglected field in spite of their obvious importance for understanding viral replication, cell tropism, and pathogenesis. The reason may be that they are relatively intractable experimentally. Identification of viral receptors is often hampered by the weak affinity between individual viral proteins and receptor molecules, and receptors often occur in low numbers on the cell surface. The efficiency of productive entry is usually low (the particle-infective unit ratios can be as high as 100-1000). This means that biochemical and morphological studies are easily confused by virions following side pathways. It is, moreover, difficult to obtain a good signal at reasonable multiplicities of infection because the early events take place, by definition, before the amplification in signal due to replication.\n\nIn spite of these obstacles, considerable progress has been made. Model virus systems have been characterized approaching a plaqueforming unit (pfu) to particle ratio of 1. It is possible to incorporate sufficient radioactive label into virus particles to follow their fate even at low multiplicity. Modern immunochemical methods have proved powerful in identifying receptors. Relatively well-characterized inhibitors that block the productive infection pathway of large groups of viruses have been identified. In uivo and in vitro systems have been developed for studying penetration by membrane fusion. As a result, the step-by-step itinerary of the entry pathway of some viruses, such as the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) , are now known.\n\nIn this review we will focus on some of the principles in virus entry with emphasis on recent work. Individual viruses and virus families will be discussed only briefly to illustrate some of the generalizations made. For early work the reader should consult reviews by Dales (1973 Dales ( , 1978 , Lonberg-Holm and Philipson (19741, and Meager and Hughes (1977) . More recent reviews include those of Helenius et al. (1980a) , Dimmock (19821, Marsh (19841, Sommerfelt and Marsh (19881, White et al. (19831, Doms et al. (19881, and Stegmann et al. (1988) . There are three recent meeting reports which contain relevant information on virus entry (Compans et al., 1988; Lonberg-Holm and Crowell, 1986 ) and on membrane fusion (Hoekstra and Wilschut, 1989; Ohki et al., 1988) .\n\nThe spread of viral infection depends on the transfer of the viral genome and accessory proteins from the cytosol (or the nucleus) of infected cells to the corresponding compartments of uninfected cells. When infection occurs via a virus particle-and not, as is sometimes the case, by direct fusion of the two cells-a sequence of discrete events take place. Depending on the virus, these include virus assembly in the infected cell, release of infective virions from the infected cell into the extracellular space, attachment of the viruses to receptor structures on the host cell surface, internalization by endocytosis, penetration through a host cell membrane, uncoating of the genome, and intracytoplasmic relocation to the nucleus or some other site in the cell.\n\nVirtually all types of viruses can be seen by electron microscopy to be internalized by endocytosis. Endocytic uptake is probably not mandatory, however, for infectivity in all cases; many viruses have been shown to penetrate directly through the plasma membrane. It is now well established that viruses which depend on acidic pH (or some other property unique to endocytic organelles) require internalization to be infective.\n\nRegardless of whether it is the plasma membrane or the membrane of an endocytic vacuole that serves as portal of entry, the genome and accessory proteins are usually first delivered to the cytosolic compartment. For successful entry the complete nucleocapsid may not need to enter; for some viruses only the genome need be made accessible to the cytosol. A dramatic example of such a mechanism is found in T-even bacteriophages, where the bulk of the viral particle actually remains extracellular.\n\nReplication may occur in cytosolic complexes, in association with specific cytosolic membranes, or the genome may have to be transported in one form or other to the nucleus for replication. Although topologically continuous with the cytoplasm, the nucleoplasm can only be reached through the nuclear membrane or the nuclear pores. Due to a low size cutoff for passage through the pores (see Dingwall and Laskey, 19861 , the nuclear membrane constitutes another barrier for those viruses destined for replication in the nucleus. Proteins smaller than about 70 kDa can pass freely through the pores, while larger particles can only enter by energy-dependent, selective uptake mechanisms which depend on specific signal determinants (see Dingwall and Laskey, 1986) . Studies with gold particles coated with the appropriate signal peptides have shown that the pore structures can expand to allow particles with a diameter of 20 nm (ie., close to the size of viral nucelocapsids) to pass (Feldherr et al., 1984) .\n\nThere is evidence to support the notion that some viruses possess, and make use of, nuclear targeting signals (Davey et al., 1985; Kalderon et al., 19861 , and capitalize on existing cellular mechanisms for nuclear transport. Electron-microscopic evidence has, on the other hand, been presented suggesting that adenovirus particles, presumably released into the cytosol after lysis of endosomal membranes, may actually uncoat at nuclear pores and inject their genome into the nucleus (Dales, 1978) . It cannot be ruled out that some (such as polyoma and SV40) may be delivered to the nucleus by membrane-bound vesicles (Mackay and Consigli, 1976; Maul et al., 1978; Nishimura et al., 1986) or enter the nucleus during mitosis when the nuclear membrane is dissociated.\n\nWhile similar in their overall pathways of entry, enveloped and nonenveloped viruses differ in the mechanisms of release and penetration. Enveloped animal viruses make elegant use of membrane fission and membrane fusion. Most nonenveloped viruses rely on lysis to escape from the infected host cell followed by poorly understood membrane translocation mechanisms during entry.\n\nThe membrane fission-fusion strategy would seem to have several advantages. It allows the viral genome to egress from and enter into cells without membrane lysis. Perhaps more importantly, at no stage during virus release from the infected cell, or entry, do the nucleocapsids need to be physically translocated through a membrane bilayer. This is a major advantage because major conformational alterations and a complex machinery is usually required for translocation of macromolecules through cellular membranes. Furthermore, packaging of large and segmented viral genomes need not be as rigorously controlled in terms of genome and capsid size as is the case for nonenveloped viruses. Many enveloped viruses are, in fact, polymorphic in size and shape. In normal cell life vesicle-mediated transport is clearly a preferred mode of cellular transport; it is common within the cytoplasm for flexible and efficient intercompartmental transport of cellular macromolecules (Palade, 1975) .\n\nNonenveloped viruses generally exit from the infected cells by inducing cell lysis. During subsequent entry, they must penetrate a t least one host cell membrane by a translocation or a lytic mechanism. This may occur either at the level of the plasma membrane or the limiting membranes of endocytic vacuoles. The membrane translocation probably involves dramatic changes in the structure of the outer protein shell of the virus. These changes, which in many instances seem to be acid-activated, result in increased hydrophobicity of the virus surface and hydrophobic membrane attachment. Little detailed molecular data are yet available. The structural and functional studies on picornaviruses are, however, progressing rapidly (Hogle et al., 1985; Rossmann et al., 1985; Rossman and Palmenberg, 1988) and the mechanism of penetration may soon be understood.\n\nIn order to cause infection, a virus must be able to bind to a cell. Binding occurs through interactions between the surface proteins of the virion and structures on the target cell, \"viral receptors.\" Enveloped and nonenveloped viruses have multiple identical proteins on their surface, thereby possessing the inherent capacity to bind to receptors through multivalent interactions. This provides them with considerable versatility in binding properties. For example, high-avidity binding may occur through a few high-affinity interactions; the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1) gp120 protein binds with high affinity (Kd = 4 x Ml) to the HIV receptor CD4 (Lasky et al., 1987) . Alternatively, high avidity can result from multiple lowaffinity interactions (Fries and Helenius, 1979) .\n\nVirus binding has, for the most part, been studied in tissue culture systems. A combination of factors including temperature, ionic strength, pH, composition of the medium, and the presence of serum has major effects on binding (Lonberg-Holm, 1981) . A variety of techniques including affinity isolation with whole virus or viral components, antireceptor antibodies or antiidiotypic antibodies to the viral binding sites, chemical cross-linking, DNA transfection, and somatic cell hybrids have been used in attempts to identify specific binding components (reviewed in Sommerfelt and Marsh, 1988) . However, few specific virus receptors have been unambiguously identified and still fewer demonstrated to play a functional role in virus entry in uiuo. A list of molecules reported to bind viruses (or viral components) that infect humans and other vertebrates is given in Table I . The evidence is not clear-cut in all the cases listed; hence the information should be viewed with some caution. Taken together the data indicate, however, that viruses have developed a large variety of strategies by which they recognize and bind to their host cells. They can use proteins, lipids, or oligosaccharides as receptors. It is not surprising that many of the receptors are proteins involved in ligand binding, endocytosis, and cell recognition.\n\nViruses such as HIV-1 and 2 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) bind to components expressed only on a limited number of cell types. In the .case of HIV, the virions bind to CD4 molecules expressed on helperlinducer T lymphocytes, cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage, and certain cells transfected with the CD4 gene (Dalgleish et al., 1984; Klatzmann et al., 1984; McDougal et al., 1986; Maddon et al., 1986) . The specificity of binding determines viral tropism. Cells that lack receptors for a given virus, or where the binding sites are blocked, are resistant to infection. Replication may occur in such cells if the viral genome is introduced artificially.\"\n\nThe CD4 antigen is presently the best characterized virus receptor protein. The molecule has been cloned, sequenced and, by expression in receptor-negative cells, confirmed as the HIV receptor (Maddon et al., 1986) . Soluble forms of the molecule, which lack the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, have been generated and shown to inhibit virus infection in uitro (Lasky et al., 1987) and the epitopes involved in virus binding are being mapped with increasing resolution (Sattentau and Weiss, 1988) .\n\nOrthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses bind with considerable spedficity to sialic acid, often in distinct linkage configurations. The * Receptor expression is not, however, the only factor that determines cell tropism.\n\nPostpenetration events, such as cell-specific expression of transactivating factors, also determine whether a virus is replicated in a particular cell (Weiss, 1984) .\n\nbinding site for sialic acid in influenza virus HA has been identified in the X-ray structure as a highly conserved depression in the HA1 subunit a t the tip of the spike protein (Wilson et al., 1981) . Sialic acid is frequently the terminal saccharide residue on cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids. Consequently, myxoviruses can infect a wide range of cells through a variety of glycoprotein or glycolipid receptors. Sialic acid has also been implicated in the binding of picornaviruses, papovaviruses, reoviruses, and adenoviruses (Burness, 1981) . Competition experiments with the lectin concanavalin A point to a role for other saccharide moieties in human rhinovirus-14 (HRV-14) binding (see Rossmann et al., 1985) , and complex carbohydrates such as those present heparan sulfate proteoglycan may be involved in herpes simplex virus infection (WuDunn and .\n\nA number of viruses, such as the alphavirus SFV, rhabdo virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), exhibit a broad host range in culture but do not appear to utilize carbohydrates as binding components. Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is probably able to utlize several cell surface proteins as receptors. Thus SFV binds to major histocompatibility (MHC) class I antigens on human and murine lymphoblastoid cells (Helenius et al., 1978) but it can also infect cells that do not express MHC molecules (Oldstone et al., 1980) . With SFV the affinity of individual spike glycoprotein-receptor interactions appears to be low, but binding of the intact multivalent virus is virtually irreversible (Fries and Helenius, 1979; Marsh et al., 198313) . Vesicular stomatitis virus has been reported to bind preferentially to negatively charged phospholipids (Mastromarino et al., 1987; Schlegel et al., 1983) .\n\nOrthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses, which bind to sialic acid, can use the same binding sites. Competition experiments show that receptors may be shared among other viruses as well. On HeLa cells, four distinct binding sites are used by a number of nonenveloped viruses: group 1 is shared by the HRV types 2, lA, and 1B; group 2 by coxsackie type A21 and HRV types 3, 5, 14, 15, 39, 41, 51 ; group 3 by all three serotypes of poliovirus; and group 4 by coxsackie B3, other coxsackie B viruses, and adenoviruses types 2 and 5 (Lonberg-Holm et al., 1976) . Similarly, 18 retroviruses that infect cultured human cells utilize eight distinct receptors, although it remains unclear whether they utilize the same epitopes (Sommerfelt and Marsh, 1988) . (1985) , Suzuki et ul. Helenius et al. (1978) Massen and Terhorst (1981) , Tignor et al. (1984) Inada and Mims (1984) Peiris and Porterfield (1979) Lentz et ul. ( ) Mastromarino et al. (1987 , Schlegel et al. (1983) Dalgleish et al. (1984) , Klatzmann et al. (1984) Johnson and Rosner (1986) @Neil1 et al. ( ) Dalziel et al. (1988 ( ) (1985 Herpes Epstein-Barr virus CR2 Fingeroth et al. (19841, Frade et al. (1985) , Reisert et al. (1985) , Tan Svensson et al. (1981) \n\nMembrane proteins of enveloped viruses may themselves function as virus receptors. Normally, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells-a cell line that grows as a polarized monolayer in culture-can only be infected with VSV through the basolateral domain. The receptors for these viruses are not expressed on the apical domain. When MDCK cells are infected with influenza virus, HA is expressed apically and the cells become susceptible to VSV through the apical domain. The HA binds to the sialic acid in the envelope protein (G) of VSV and functions as a VSV receptor (Fuller et al., 1985) . Similarly, baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells do not express a receptor for murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59, a coronavirus). The cells are therefore resistant to MHV. However, they become susceptible when preinfected with influenza. Thus, virus infection can facilitate secondary infections by other virus in uitro (Fuller et al., 1985; Khelifa and Menezes, 1983) .* A similar phenomenon may occur in uiuo.\n\nThe examples just discussed all involve direct interaction of the virus attachment sites with cell surface-binding components. Viruses may also bind to cell surface components indirectly through mediation by an intermediate molecule. The clearest example of this type of interaction occurs in antibody-enhanced viral infection. Antiviral antibodies facilitate flavivirus, myxovirus, and lentivirus infection of macrophages and other cells both in culture and in viuo by cross-linking virions to cell surface Fc receptors (McGuire et al., 1986; Peiris and Porterfield, 1979; Peiris et al., 1981; Webster and Askonas, 1980) . Cytomegalovirus is believed to bind &-microglobulin, displace MHCbound &-microglobulin, and use MHC antigens to bind to the cell surface McKeating et aE., 1987) . Hepatitis B virus appears to bind to hepatocytes through polyalbumin and polymeric albumin receptors (Thung and Gerber, 1984) .\n\nA curious example where an related receptor can rescue a virus is supplied by mutant Sendai viruses which lack functional receptor binding proteins: since the glycoproteins contain terminal sialic acid, they * Infection by one virus may also interfere with subsequent infection by a second.\n\nCells chronically producing retroviruses, and expressing viral envelope glycoproteins on their surface, down-regulate, shield, or otherwise hide the binding site. Thereby the cells become resistant to superinfection by any retroviruses that use the same cell surfacebinding sites (see Sommerfelt and Marsh, 1988 ).\n\ncan be internalized through the asialoglycoprotein receptor and infect cells (Markwell et al., 1982) .\n\nBinding facilitates viral entry by providing the initial physical association between a cell surface and the virion. Whether virus receptors play any further role in entry depends on the case. Influenza virus, for instance, does not require sialic acid containing receptors for penetration. The receptors are needed for binding and endocytosis. In the case of alphaviruses and rhabdoviruses it is also known from in uitro studies that the fusion activity which underlies penetration in endosomes is not dependent on the presence of specific surface receptors. Experiments in which avian retroviruses bind nonspecifically to receptordeficient cells but fail to infect suggest, however, that additional essential roles for receptors may exist in other cases (Notter et al., 1982) . The receptor for poliovirus may, for instance, be needed for the correct acid-induced conformational change. While binding and endocytosis is required for penetration by pH-dependent viruses (Section V), no evidence for a more direct role for the receptor in penetration is available.\n\nAll nucleated interphase cells express continuous, high-capacity endocytic activity whereby components of the medium are internalized in membrane-bound vesicles. Constitutive endocytosis occurs primarily through clathrin-coated vesicles (-100 nm diameter), which form by the invagination of specialized coated-pit domains of the plasma membrane. Coated vesicles mediate efficient uptake of nutrient carriers, growth factors, peptide hormones, immune complexes, and other physiological ligands that bind to specific receptors expressed on the cell surface (see Brown et al., 1983; Goldstein et al., 1985; Helenius et al., 1983) . In addition, solutes and small particles ( 4 0 0 nm diameter) are internalized nonspecifically and less efficiently in the fluid content of the vesicles (fluid-phase endocytosis) (see Steinman et al., 1983) .\n\nFollowing internalization, the clathrin coat is removed and the vesicles fuse with organelles of the endosome compartment. Endosomes are the station for sorting ligands and receptors internalized by coated vesicles and for regulating endocytic membrane traffic (see Helenius et al., 1983) . They are responsible for dispatching molecules to lysosomes and for recycling others to the plasma membrane on the Golgi apparatus (see Goldstein et al., 1985; Helenius et al., 1983; Mellman et al., 1986) . Some incoming molecules are proteolytically processed in endosomes (Diment et ul., 1988) . Others undergo conformational changes.\n\nThe mechanisms of these sorting reactions are not well understood. However, acidification of endocytic organelles through membranebound H + -ATPases is one important element (Mellman et ul., 1986; Tycko and Maxfield, 1982) . Endosomes are the first acidic compartment in the endocytic pathway (Fuchs et al., 1987) . From a pH of 6.2 in early endosomes the pH decrease to approximately 5.0 by the time ligands reach the terminal compartment of the pathway, the lysosomes. Agents, such as acidotropic weak bases (ammonium chloride, chloroquine, amantadine, methylamine) and carboxylic ionophores (monensin and nigericin), which raise the pH of acidic organelles,* disrupt endosomal function, prevent the dissociation of receptorligand complexes, and inhibit the recycling of receptors Maxfield, 1982; Mellman et al., 1986; Ohkuma and Poole, 1978) . Acidification is also important for lysosome function. Lysosomes provide a hydrolytic environment where ligands, and receptors to be down-regulated or turned over, are degraded. The hydrolytic enzymes are active at low pH and at least partially inhibited by reagents that raise the pH of acidic organelles (Ohkufna and Poole, 1978) . Some hydrolytic enzymes are already encountered and active in the endo-soma1 compartment, where they modify and degrade certain incoming ligands (Diment et al., 1988) .\n\nIn addition to constitutive endocytosis, cells can internalize large particles (>200 nm diameter) such as yeast or bacteria. Termed phagocytosis, this form of endocytosis is usually the property of specialized phagocytic cells such as macrophages (see Steinman et al., 1986) , but with an appropriately opsonized particle it can occur in most cell types. Phagocytosis is ligand-induced, receptor-dependent, and occurs through an actin-based mechanism that can be inhibited by cytochalasin B. Following invagination, phagocytic vesicles are acidified in a similar way to endosomes and fuse with lysosomes to form degradative phagolysosomes.\n\n* In nonprotonated form, weak bases readily diffuse across membranes. In acid compartments they become protonated, accumulate, and increase the vesicular pH. Carboxylic ionophores have a similar effect but achieve this by exchanging H + for Naf or K + (Maxfield, 1982; Ohkuma and Poole, 1978) .\n\nMany viruses, including alphaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses, retroviruses, herpesviruses, and a number of nonenveloped viruses, have been shown to be internalized by endocytosis (Dales, 1973; Helenius et al., 1980b; Matlin et al., 1982a,b) . Morphological evidence for this process, originally termed \"viropexis,\" indicates that uptake usually occurs through clathrin-coated vesicles by receptor-mediated endocytosis, but other modes of endocytosis may also be operational.\n\nDetailed experiments with SFV have shown that the endocytosis is very similar to the receptor-mediated uptake of physiological ligands (see  Fig. 1 ). At 0\u00b0C virions are bound over the entire cell surface but are not internalized. On warming to 37\"C, the virions are relocated to coated pits and internalized in coated vesicles. Uptake is not induced by the virions, is independent of multiplicity, and occurs through the constitutive endocytic activity of the host cell (Marsh and Helenius, 1980; Marsh et al., 1983a) . The SFV particles (65 nm diameter) can be contained within endocytic coated vesicles. They are internalized with a time course similar to that of serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) (the half-time of bound viruses on the cell surface is 5-10 minutes) Marsh and Helenius, 1980; Schmid et al., 1989) . In BHK cells up to 3000 SFV particles can be internalized in coated vesicles per minute (Marsh and Helenius, 1980) . The injection of anticlathrin antibodies into the cytoplasm of cells inhibits the internalization of SFV and blocks infection (Doxsey et al., 1987) .\n\nMorphological observations indicate that many other viruses follow essentially the same pathway, although the kinetics of endocytosis can vary apparently as a function of particle size. Influenza virus (100 nm diameter) and VSV (150 nm long, 50 nm diameter) have a half-time of 10-15 and 30 minutes, respectively (Matlin et al., 1982a,b) .\n\nAlthough clathrin-coated vesicles are clearly involved in the uptake of most enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, other endocytic mechanisms have been encountered. Morphological experiments with influenza and Sendai viruses show that, in addition to coated vesicles, virions are occasionally seen in noncoated membrane vacuoles resembling phagocytic vesicles (Dourmashkin and Tyrell, 1974; Hayward, 1987; Matlin et al., 1982a) . Although herpesviruses are often observed close to coated pits, EBV (250 nm diameter) is reported to enter B lymphocytes in noncoated vesicles (Nemerow et al., 1985) . The endocytic uptake of herpesvirus may at least in part, occur by a phagocytic 2. Internalization. enters by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and penetration by membrane fusion is triggered in the early endosome. Attachment occurs preferentially to microvilli followed by lateral movement of the virus to coated pits. Exposure to a pH of <6.2 and penetration of virus occurs almost immediately after internalization. If mutant viruses with a lower pH threshold of fusion or cell mutants with a n endosomal acidification defect are used, penetration occurs from late endosomes Schmid et al., 1988 . Recent studies on the site of replication of the viral RNA suggest that it occurs on the cytoplasmic surface of the lysosomal membrane (Froshauer et al., 1988) . Frequently, a connection between the lysosome and the rough endoplasmic reticulum is seen, suggesting that viral RNA synthesis, the synthesis of nonstructural and structural protein, as well as nucleocapsid assembly may occur in the same extensive structure suspended over the space between the cytopathic vacuoles and the lysosomes (Froshauer et al., 1988) . mechanism, since it is inhibited by cytochalasins (Rosenthal et al., 1985) . Whereas poliovirus seems to enter mainly by coated pits, HRV-2 may infect cells via a coated vesicle-independent endocytic mechanism (Madshus et al., 1987) . Papovaviruses are known to be internalized mainly in noncoated vesicles (Maul et al., 1978; Mackay and Consigli, 1976) . They are so small and tight fitting that it almost looks like the viral particles would be budding from the extracellular space into the cell. All these mechanisms require further study, as they may provide new insights into the versatility of cellular endocytosis.\n\nLike other ligands internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, internalized virions are delivered to endosomes. Kinetic, morphological, biochemical, and cell fractionation experiments have demonstrated that SFV, Sindbis, and influenza virions penetrate into the cytoplasm by fusing with the limiting membrane of endosomes Marsh et al., 1983a; Richman et al., 1986; Talbot and Vance, 1982; Yoshimura and Ohnishi, 1984) . Internalized viruses have been shown to be infectious , and fusion of SFV with endosome membranes has been observed morphologically (Helenius, 1984) . Particularly convincing images of viruses fusing out of endosomes have been obtained for frog 3 viruses (Braunwald et al., 1985) .\n\nFor alphaviruses, myxoviruses, rhabdoviruses, and many other viruses, endocytosis is essential for productive entry. The acidic conditions in endosomes trigger the reactions which lead to fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes. The precise time and location of penetration is determined by the pH dependence of the fusion activity. Viruses in which fusion is triggered at a pH close to neutral (e.g., SFV, pH 6.2) fuse in so-called early endosomes Schmid et al., 1988) . Viruses that require more acidic conditions, such as SFV,,,-, (pH 5.3) and influenza X-31 (pH 5.3), fuse in so-called late endosomes (tll2 = 20-35 minutes) Schmid et al., 1988; Stegmann et al., 1987b) . The differences reflect the gradual increase in acidity within the endocytic pathway.\n\nIn all cases studied, fusion appears to occur in endosomes prior to delivery to the lysosomes Marsh et al., 1983a; Stegmann et al., 1987b) . Viruses, or viral components that are delivered to lysosomes, are rapidly inactivated and degraded (Marsh et al., 1983a) , which may explain why lysosomes are usually not able to support viral penetration. One exception could be reoviruses, where specific proteolytic cleavages are needed for infectivity (Sturzenbecker et al., 1987) .\n\nThe dependence on endocytosis and subsequent exposure to acid conditions presents a point at which penetration can be blocked. By raising the pH of endosomes and lysosomes, weak bases and carboxylic ionophores block the acid-induced changes essential for fusion and translocation of many viruses (Gollins and Porterfield, 198613; Helenius et al., 1982; Matlin et aE., 1982a,b; Richman et al., 1986; Yoshimura and Ohnishi, 19841 .\" As a result, the viral genome is not released into the cytoplasm. The efficacy of weak bases is related to the pH threshold of fusion. Viruses that fuse at pH 6.0 (SFV, VSV) and 6.5 (West Nile) require higher concentrations of weak bases to be effectively neutralized than viruses that fuse at pH 5.3 (influenza X-31) .\n\nWeak bases and carboxylic ionophores do not affect binding, endocytosis, and transport of prebound virions to endosomes, nor do they affect the fusion reaction directly. In some cases weak base-induced blocks to infection can be bypassed by briefly incubating cells, with bound virus, in low-pH medium. This treatment induces fusion of virions at the cell surface, and, even in the presence of the inhibitors, results in infection of the cell (Helenius et al., 1980b . The effects of acidotropic weak bases are, moreover, very sensitive to a lowering of the pH in the medium, which has to be controlled throughout the experiment Yoshimura et al., 1987) .\n\nInternalization through the endocytic pathway usually results in the delivery of ligands to the hydrolytic lysosome compartment, an environment in which they are rapidly inactivated and degraded. Since entry via the endocytic pathway carries such a risk for viruses, it must offer significant balancing advantages. Some potential advantages * Note that the effects of weak bases and carboxylic ionophores on virus entry should not be confused with effects on other steps in replication. Weak bases and carboxylic ionophores affect all acidic compartments in the cell and are not specific to endocytic organelles. For example, transport of newly synthesized enveloped virus membrane proteins to the cell surface can be inhibited through the effects of these agents on the exocytic pathway (see Cassell et al., 1984; Mellman et al., 1986; Tartakoff, 1983) . When using these agents as diagnostic inhibitors for acid-dependent entry, it is important to assay for early events such as uncoating or RNA replication rather than late events such as the production of progeny virus.\n\nhave been discussed previously Sommerfelt and Marsh, 1988) . By requiring endocytosis, virions can, for instance, ensure that they enter metabolically active cells capable of supporting replication. For pH-dependent viruses, endocytosis is required to deliver the virions to an acidic environment.\n\nAnother likely advantage is based on the fact that viral genome may need to be delivered to a specific region of the cytoplasm, such as the perinuclear region, to initiate infection. Entry through the endocytic pathway provides a natural means for achieving such relocalization. Evidence suggesting that productive infection of some cell types only occurs efficiently from endocytic vesicles comes from experiments with pH-d%pendent enveloped viruses. As already mentioned, fusion can be induced at the plasma membrane by briefly acidifying the medium (Helenius et al., 1980b) . In baby hamster kidney (BHK), fusion a t the cell surface results in infection (Helenius et al., 1980b; . In several other systems, however, including VSV and fowl plague virus (an avian influenza virus) in MDCK cells, West Nile virus on murine macrophagelike cells, and SFV on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, fusion at the cell surface does not cause infection (Gollins and Porterfield, 1986a; Matlin et al., 1982a,b; M. Marsh, unpublished observations) , although it is clear that the nucleocapsids have been delivered into thc cytosol (Matlin et al., 1982a) . The most likely reason is that the incoming nucleocapsids are trapped in the space between the plasma membrane and the underlying membrane cytoskeleton, and cannot move into the cytoplasm proper. The result implies that endocytosis in many cell types may be essential for transporting viruses through obstacles within the cytoplasmic compartment, and deliver the genome into the central perinuclear area. In neuronal cells, which have long cytoplasmic projections, penetration is likely to occur after transport of viruses to the cell body.\n\nThe membrane fusion activity of enveloped animal viruses is catalyzed by the spike glycoproteins (Table 11) . While different in their detailed structure, the fusion proteins so far identified in different virus families have several properties in common. They are, as a rule, homooligomeric or heterooligomeric transmembrane glycoproteins with a combined molecular weight in the 200K-400K range. The N termini are located in the external (ecto) domain. Since the trans- (1977) membrane domains and the C-terminal, cytoplasmic domains are relatively small, the bulk of the polypeptide is external and visible by high-resolution electron microscopy as spikelike protrusions on the surface of the virus envelope. Most viruses only need a single type of spike glycoproteins for fusion, but it has been suggested that others, such as paramyxoviruses, may need the cooperative action of two (see later). Each virus particle contains 80 or more spike glycoproteins. Whether more than one individual spike is required in each fusion event is unclear.\n\nThe fusion factors are invariably glycosylated, and many of them contain covalently bound palmitic acid. While addition of the N-linked sugars is often required for correct folding of.the nascent fusion proteins and transport to the surface (see Rose and Doms, 1988; Schlesinger and Schlesinger, 19861 , the carbohydrate moiety has no direct role in fusion. The role of fatty acid acylation is less clear. Mutants and naturally occurring strains of VSV, which lack fatty acylation in their G protein, are not impaired in their fusion activity, showing that the fatty acid is dispensable (Rose et al., 1984) . In the case of influenza HA it has been reported, however, that removal of palmitic acid using hydrolysis with hydroxylamine inhibits fusion activity, suggesting that it may play a role (Lambrecht and Schmidt, 1986) . It is not clear in this case whether the treatment modified the spike trimers in other subtle ways. In VSV G protein the fatty acid is coupled by a thioester bond to a cysteine residue in the cytoplasmic tail (Rose et al., 1984) . A similar location for the palmitic acid is likely for other acylated spike glycoproteins.\n\nActivating proteolytic cleavages catalyzed by cellular proteases late in the secretory pathway are critical for the fusion activity of a t least orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, and retroviruses (see Choppin and Compans, 1975; Sturman et al., 1985; White et al., 1983) . The new N termini are frequently hydrophobic, and some have been shown to be important in fusion (Boulay et al., 1987a; Gething et al., 1978 Gething et al., , 1986 Harter et al., 1988) . In influenza HA strains the \"fusion sequence\" at the newly created N terminus of HA2 is highly conserved (Wiley and Skehel, 1987) . While the uncleaved precursor hemagglutinin, called HAO, can undergo an acid-activated conformational change similar to that observed for the mature HA, it does not expose a hydrophobic moiety with which it can interact with membranes (Boulay et al., 1987a) . It is thus apparent that the hydrophobic \"fusion sequence\" must be present as a free N-terminal for fusion activity.\n\nProteolytic activation is not required for all viral fusion proteins. A precursor subunit in the spike glycoprotein of SFV (p62) undergoes a late cleavage t o the mature glycopolypeptides E2 and E3, very similar to those listed earlier, but this cleavage is not needed for fusion activity (Cutler and Garoff, 1986; Edwards et al., 1983) . Rhabdovirus G proteins do not undergo any posttranslational cleavages, but they are still very efficient fusogens.\n\nAside from the general similarities, fusion factors constitute quite a heterogeneous group of proteins. Sequence homologies are seldom observed, and not all have N-terminal hydrophobic fusion sequences. Some fusion proteins have receptor-binding activities, others do not. While fusion proteins are generally oligomeric, some contain a single type of subunits; others are heterooligomeric. The mechanisms of fusion also display distinct differences. It seems clear that, as a group, viral fusion factors do not have their origin in a single ancestral gene. Perhaps they evolved from different cellular surface receptors or cell recognition proteins, and their initial functions may have been to provide efficient and specific attachment to cells. The fusion function may have evolved later. Since many different proteins display latent fusion activities, particularly when denatured by extremes of pH, the structural requirements for this activity may not be very stringent (Stegmann et al., 1988) .\n\nMost biological membranes have the capacity to fuse with other membranes. During cell life, membrane fusion is a frequent activity in endocytosis, exocytosis, and numerous other cellular functions. Fusion events in biological systems occur between specific membranes, at specific times, and at defined locations. Since they are strictly regulated, it is usually assumed that proteins are involved.\n\nSo far, the best-studied fusion proteins are the viral spikes from influenza virus, Sendai virus, SFV, HIV-1, and VSV. Their properties and activities have been described in numerous papers, and have been the topic of recent reviews, by White et al. (1983) , Wiley and Skehel (1987) , Stegmann et al. (1989) , and Wharton (19871, and by several other authors in books on membrane fusion (Hoekstra and Wilschut, 1988; Ohki et al., 1989) . Here we will restrict the discussion to some general principles, focusing mainly on influenza HA.\n\nInfluenza virus HA constitutes one of the most efficient fusogens known. The X-ray structure of the HA ectodomain in its inactive neutral pH form is known (Wilson et al., 198l) , and its biosynthesis and assembly have been extensively analyzed. It is a homotrimer (3 x 84 kDa) in which every protomer consists of two disulfide-linked glyco-polypeptides, HA1 and HA2, derived by proteolytic cleavage from a common precursor HAO. HA2 constitutes the transmembrane subunit and plays a key role in fusion (Gething et al., 1986; Harter et al., 1988; Wharton, 1987) . HA1, which is entirely outside of the membrane, is responsible for binding the virus to sialic acid residues on the surface of the host cell.\n\nHA is the only protein component required for fusion activity (White et al., 1982a) . To be active it must be an integral component of one of the fusing membranes (White et al., 1982a) and (in exceptional cases) when present as a polyvalent, water-soluble rosette (Wharton, 1987) . The lipid compositions of the HA-containing membrane and the target membrane are not very critical (Maeda et al., 1981; Stegmann et al., 1987a; . Thus, HA can be reconstituted in functional form into artificial membranes without loss of activity, and it mediates fusion with virtually any type of biological or artificial membrane (Kawasaki et al., 1983; Maeda et al., 1981; Stegmann et al., 1987a; . Only certain liposomes with nonbiological lipid compositions have been found to be poor targets (Stegmann, 19871 , and drastic enzymatic modification of the viral lipids has been shown to be inhibitory (Huang and Uslu, 1986) . The target membranes do not need to contain any sialic acid-carrying molecules or proteins (Maeda et al., 1981; . The fact that sialic acid-containing receptors such as gangliosides sometimes increase the efficiency of fusion may reflect improved attachment of the two membranes to each other rather than receptor involvement in fusion (Stegmann et al., 1988) .\n\nThe fusion activity of HA is acid-activated and involves a major conformational change in the HA trimer. The conformational change, studied in several laboratories using a variety of techniques (see Doms et al., 1985; Stegmann et al., 1988; Wharton, 1987; White and Wilson, 1987; White et al., 1983) , involves a partial dissociation of the trimer. The top domains of the HA1 chains dissociate from each other. A previously hidden hydrophobic moiety, which includes the N termini of the HA2, is exposed, and additional changes occur in the interface between the three HA2 subunits (Doms and Helenius, 1986) . Figure 2 depicts schematically our interpretation of the data. The half-life of the irreversible change is about 15 seconds a t pH 5 and 37\u00b0C; at lower temperatures the change is slower and less complete. There are indications that the change occurs in two steps. The first involves a change at the tip of the molecule and the second a change further down. However, studies with isolated bromelain fragments, which comprise NEUTRAL FORM ACID FORM\n\nagreed that acid exposure leads to a partial dissociation of the ectodomain of the HA spike trimer, that a hydrophobic moiety involving the N termini of HA2 (here shown in black) is exposed. Though based on a variety of biochemical, genetic, immunochemical, and morphological data, the proposed structure of the acid HA shown is, however, still highly speculative. the trimeric ectodomain (and approximate the intact HA in their acid conversion), have indicated that exposure of the hydrophobic fusion peptide may also be an early event (White and Wilson, 1987) . The conformational change in the HA trimer is cooperative (Boulay et al., 1987b) , and we have indirect evidence that fusion may involve more than one spike trimer (Doms and Helenius, 1986 ). It has been suggested on the basis of radiation inactivation analysis that the fusionactive unit in influenza virus fusion with red blood cells is no larger than about 60 kDa (Bundu-Morita et al., 1987) . The dose-response curve is complex, however, and other interpretations are possible.\n\nDespite extensive work in analyzing the conformational change in HA, a single generally accepted model does not exist. For alternative interpretations of its nature and its relevance for fusion, see Doms and Helenius (1988) , Landsberger and Schegal (1986) , and Ruigrok et uZ. (1986) . Reports suggesting that influenza can fuse at neutral pH have appeared in the literature (Haywood and Boyer, 1982; Stegmann et al., 1985 Stegmann et al., ,1986 ). One of them was shown to be an artifact due to the use of cardiolipin vesicles as targets (Stegmann et al., 1986) . The highly charged cardiolipin membranes are known to serve as efficient fusion vesicles for a large number of proteins including many with no known physiological fusion activity (see Stegmann et al., 1989) . The ac-cumulation of positively charged ions (including protons) close to the membrane, according to the electrical double-layer theory of Gouy and Chapman, may a t least in part explain the effect. Too little quantitative data are available to evaluate properly another report of neutral pH fusion between influenza virus and ganglioside-containing vesicles (Haywood and Boyer, 1982) .\n\nThe detailed mechanism of HA-mediated fusion remains elusive. The view that we favor is as follows: When exposed to a pH of 5.0-5.6 (depending on the virus strain) in the late endosomes, the HA undergoes the conformational change. A hydrophobic interaction between the spikes and the target membrane is established through insertion of the exposed hydrophobic moieties into the target membrane. This results in attachment of the virus to the target membrane and close apposition between the two membranes. The close proximity of the two membranes results in local dehydration of the membrane surface, which in turn leads to a lowering of the hydration force, which normally prevents close apposition of polar surfaces in aqueous solution (Rand, 1981) . As a consequence of local dehydration and a change in the local lipid configurations induced by the inserted polypeptide, fusion of the outer bilayer leaflet of the viral membrane and the inner bilayer leaflet of the endosome occurs. The fusion with the outer leaflet of the endosome and the inner leaflet of the viral envelope membrane follows, resulting in the release of the nucleocapsid into the cytosolic compartment. Fusion between two membranes obviously needs to occur only at a single focal site. This model predicts that the HA molecules are associated-at least transiently-as integral proteins in both fusing membranes and that the insertion of protein into the target membrane and the effect on surface hydration brings about a change in local lipid orientation.\n\nIt should be emphasized that other mechanisms are conceivable and that it is unclear what exactly is needed to induce fusion of any type of biological membrane (Blumenthal et al., 1987; Rand, 1981) . Other viruses and viral fusion factors seem to differ in their fusion properties in significant ways. Some depend on the presence of cholesterol in the target membrane (Kielian and Helenius, 1984; , some do not have distinct hydrophobic fusion sequences (Woodgett and Rose, 1986) , and some may, unlike HA, undergo reversible conformational changes at acid pH (Doms et aZ., 1987) . As already mentioned, several viral proteins differ from HA in that they do not require acid pH for fusion (Tables I1 and 111 ). Additional information on these matters will be presented next, when a selection of individual virus families are described. Superti et al. (1984 Superti et al. ( , 1987a , Tsing and Superti (19841, White et al. (1983) (1985), Gonzalez-Scarano et al.\n\nCash ( \n\nThe pathway of entry and penetration of toga(a1pha)viruses has been studied in considerable detail. The work on SFV now serves as a general paradigm for viruses with endocytic entry pathways. It was the first virus to be shown to have acid-activated penetration from endosomes and to fuse with liposomes and cell membranes in an acidtriggered fashion (Helenius et al., 1980b; Marsh et al., 1983a; . The major advantages of this virus as a model system is the extremely high pfu to particle ratio, the ease of radioactive labeling to very high specific activities, and the wide host cell specificity. Since the literature on alphavirus entry has been recently reviewed (Kielian and Helenius, 19861 , and some of the material already described here, a relatively short description will suffice.\n\nAlthough restricted to a few host organisms in the wild, these arthropod-borne, positive-stranded RNA viruses infect a wide range of cells in tissue culture. Some have been shown to bind to MHC antigens and to other surface proteins (Table I) , but the true physiological receptors are not known. Endocytic internalization occurs by receptormediated endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits and vesicles (Helenius et d , 1980b; Marsh and Helenius, 1980 ). This has not only been demonstrated at the morphological level, but injection of anticlathrin antibodies into the cytosol has also been shown to inhibit endocytosis and infectivity (Doxsey et al., 1987) . Internalized virions are rapidly and efficiently delivered in intact form to early endosomes where the mildly acid conditions (pH <6.2) trigger an irreversible conformational change in the viral fusion proteins, thus inducing membrane fusion and penetration (Edwards et al., 1983; Helenius, 1984; Kielian and Helenius, 1985; Schmid et al., 1988; Talbot and Vance, 1982; . The overall pathway of SFV entry is shown in Fig. 1 . It is important to note that up to 60% of cell-associated viruses are actually able to release their RNA into the cytosol Kielian and Helenius, 1984; Marsh et al., 1983a) , and that the viral RNA replication appears to take place on the surface of the endosomal and lysosomal membranes (Froshauer et al., 1988) . The endosomes and lysosomes are modified in the process to morphologically distinct organelles called cytopathic vacuole I (Froshauer et al., 1988; Grimley et al., 1972) .\n\nAlphavirus penetration is blocked by weak bases and carboxylic ionophores Marsh et al., 1982; Miller and Lenard, 1981; Talbot and Vance, 1982) . Semliki Forest virus reaches the endosomes in the presence of these acidotropic agents, but fusion is inhibited. The virus-loaded endosomes thus obtained can be isolated, and the SFV nucleocapsid induced to penetrate out of them in uitro by adding ATP to drive the endosomal H+-ATPase and decrease the endosomal pH (M. Marsh, unpublished observations) . This in uitro-penetration reaction is inhibited by carboxylic ionophores and other agents that prevent acidification of the isolated organelles. Like influenza HA, the spike glycoproteins can be extracted from the viral membrane with detergents and reconstituted into lipid vesicles in fusionactive form (Scheule, 1986 (Scheule, , 1987 .\n\nFor successful fusion of SFV with target membranes, three conditions must be fulfilled. i.) A pH of less than 6.2 is required to trigger the conformational changes that render the envelope proteins fusogenic (Edwards et al., 1983; Young et al., 1983) . ii.) The target membrane must contain cholesterol (Kielian and Helenius, 1984; Scheule, 1987; , without which fusion does not occur. Cholesterol is needed for the low-pHinduced conformational change in the E l glycoprotein . iii.) Finally, the cell must have a normal membrane potential . In depolarized cells, virions are bound and internalized, and undergo acid-induced conformational changes in endosomes, but they do not fuse. This requirement remains somewhat perplexing because no pH gradient, ion gradient, or membrane potential over the target membrane is needed for SFV fusion with liposomes (Kielian and Helenius, 1984) .\n\nSince the mode of acid-activated, endocytosis-dependent entry of alphaviruses presented here is not unanimously accepted, it may be important to discuss some of the objections that have been raised. Because infection by Sindbis virus is not inhibited by cytochalasin B, Coombs et al. (1981) concluded that endocytosis is not essential for infection. However, it is known that, while this microfilament inhibitor blocks phagocytosis, it leaves coated vesicle-mediated pinocytic processes essentially unaffected (Steinman et al., 1983) . Marsh and Helenius (1980) suggested, in fact, that the lack of cytochalasin inhibition was consistent with a pinocytic coated vesicle-dependent pathway of entry. The notion that acid-activated fusion only occurs after pH neutralization (Edwards and Brown, 1986 ) is also incorrect, as shown by recent studies on cell-cell fusion (Kempf et al., 1987) . The confusion may in this case have arisen from the light-microscopic fusion assay used by Edwards and Brown (1986) ; they did not score fusion as such but subsequent changes in cell morphology, which take time to develop and may be more efficient after returning to neutral pH. Taken together, the overwhelming evidence contradicts the view presented by Edwards et al. (1983) that low pH causes the expression of a fusion function which merely \"mimics\" some intrinsically pH-independent event which occurs during normal infection.\n\nFlavivirus entry has been studied in most detail with West Nile virus. West Nile virus is internalized by coated vesicles and trans-ported to endosomes (Gollins and Porterfield, 1985) . Infection is inhibited by weak bases and is therefore presumed to involve acid-induced fusion Porterfield, 1985, 1986b) . The conclusion is supported by experiments in which viruses have been induced to fuse with liposomes or the plasma membrane of target cells (Gollins and Porterfield, 1986a) . Penetration is pH-dependent, with the threshold for fusion being about pH 6.5. The mechanism of entry into macrophages is of particular interest, as it is mediated by antibodies and presumably occurs via the Fc receptor (Gollins and Porterfield, 1985; Peiris and Porterfield, 1979; Peiris et al., 1981) . Gollins and Porterfield (1986~) have made an important observation which may be of value for future therapeutic strategies against flaviviruses. They found that among several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the West Nile virus, one was able to block penetration without affecting attachment or endocytic internalization. They concluded that the antibody specifically interacted with the acidic fusionactive form of the virus and prevented penetration in endosomes. A similar report has been made for rabies virus (Dietzschold et al., 1987) .\n\nThe entry of VSV and rabies virus into tissue culture cells resembles that of SFV and influenza virus, but less is known about it. Cell surface-bound virions are internalized through coated pits and delivered to endosomes (Matlin et al., 198213) . Fusion is pH-dependent, occurring at pH 6.0 and below, and entry is inhibited by weak bases (Blumenthal et al., 1987; Matlin et al., 1982b; Miller and Lenard, 1981; Tsing and Superti, 1984) and carboxylic ionophores (M. Marsh, unpublished observations) . Vesicular stomatitis virus fuses rapidly and efficiently with a variety of natural and artificial target membranes (Blumenthal et al., 1987; Matlin et al., 1982b; Mifune et al., 1982; White et al., 1981; Yamada and Ohnishi, 1986) . The G protein, which exists as a trimer in the viral membrane, has been successfully reconstituted into proteoliposomes (Metsikko et al., 1986) . G Protein undergoes conformational changes at low pH which seem to be unique in being reversible when the pH is returned to neutrality (Doms et al., 1987) . One of the effects of the conformational change in the G protein is the stabilization of the homotrimeric structure (Doms et al., 1987) . However, the effects of these changes on the conformation of the G-protein trimers and the fusion properties of the G protein are still poorly understood. The sequence of G Protein is known (Rose and Gallione, 1981) , but there is no obvious hydrophobic fusion sequence. It has been suggested that the N-terminal peptide may serve such a role (Schlegel and Wade, 1985) , but this is unlikely in view of more recent in uitro mutation studies (Woodgett and Rose, 1986) .\n\nThe entry of influenza virus A has already been discussed extensively. Considerable information exists regarding the structure, receptor specificity, endocytosis, and low-pH-dependent fusion of these viruses. Penetration occurs from late endosomes (Yoshimura et al., 1982) following uptake in coated and noncoated vesicles (Dourmashkin and Tyrell, 1974; Matlin et al., 1982a) . The low endosomal pH triggers the fusion reaction (Stegmann et al., 1985; White et al., 1982b) and infection is blocked by acidotropic weak bases (Matlin et al., 1982a; Yoshimura et al., 1982) .\n\nParamyxoviruses, such as Sendai and Newcastle disease virus, are well-known fusogenic viruses (see Choppin and Compans, 1975; Hayward, 1987; White et al., 1983) . Unlike the fusion reactions already described for alphaviruses, rhabdoviruses, and orthomyxoviruses, fusion is pH-independent, occurring with almost equal efficiency throughout the relevant pH range. Consequently, paramyxovirus fusion can and does occur a t the cell surface. During infection of cells with Sendai virus, intact virions can also be seen in coated vesicles and are presumably taken into endosomes. It remains to be demonstrated whether both or only one of the pathways are infectious.\n\nFusion is mediated by the F protein, which has a hydrophobic \"fusion sequence'' at the N terminus of the F1 subunit (Gething et al., 1978) . Only the proteolytically cleaved protein is active (Homma and Ohuchi, 1973; Scheid and Choppin, 1976) . Several recent reports indicate that for maximal fusion, a second glycoprotein, HN, must also be present (Ohki, 1988) . On the other hand, fusion can take place without receptor molecules in the target membrane (Citovsky and Loyter, 1985) . Cholesterol in the target membrane provides for enhanced fusion activity (Asano and Asano, 1985; Citovsky et al., 1988; Hus et al., 1983; Yoshimura et al., 1987) . Even then, the fusion activity of Sendai and other paramyxoviruses is slow and inefficient compared to acidactivated viruses.\n\nThe retroviruses are a diverse group of viruses that can induce tumors or immunodeficiency diseases in humans and animals. A common feature is that they contain a reverse transcriptase which, following penetration, converts the positive-sense RNA genome into a doublestranded DNA which can integrate into the host cell genome. Entry of the viruses occurs by membrane fusion, which is mediated by fusogenic envelope glycoproteins (see White et al., 1983) . These proteins have a similar overall structure to the HA of influenza virus, although they differ from it in primary sequence. The proteins are synthesized as single-chain polyprotein precursors in the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells. En route to the cell surface the proteins are trimerized (Hunter and Einfeld, 1988) and proteolytically cleaved. One of the resulting glycopolypeptides, the N-terminal gp120 of HIV for example, is not anchored in the bilayer and carries the receptor-binding site. It is analogous to the HA1 polypeptide. The other portion (gp41 for HIV) is a transmembrane protein and contains the newly created N terminus, which is highly hydrophobic. It is analogous to HA2. As with HA, proteolytic activation and the hydrophobic nature of the N terininus are essential for the fusion activity (Kowalski et al., 1987) .\n\nThe fusion activities of retroviruses can be acid-dependent or pHindependent (Table 111 ). The acid-dependent viruses include the ecotropic murine leukemia viruses, which are internalized into host cells by endocytosis and inhibited by weak bases (Anderson and Nexg, 1983) and murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV), which fuses cells a t <pH 5.3 (Redmond et al., 1984) . Many other retroviruses-in particular those that infect human cells-exhibit pH-independent fusion. This has been demonstrated most clearly for HIV-1 and HIV-2 (McClure et al., 1987; Stein et al., 1987) . HIV fuses at the cell surface and entry is not affected by weak bases and carboxylic ionophores (McClure et al., 1987; Stein et al., 1987) . Virus particles are also observed in endocytic coated pits and coated vesicles (Bauer et al., 1987; D. Pauze, personal communication) . It remains to be demonstrated whether either one or both of these routes leads to productive infection.\n\nThe CD4 receptor for HIV-1 and HIV-2, normally expressed on Thelper/inducer cells, functions as a virus receptor when expressed in human CD4-negative HeLa cells. Murine NIH 3T3 cells expressing CD4, however, bind HIV-1 but remain resistant to infection (Maddon et al., 1986 ). An additional complication is suggested by experiments with VSV (HIV-1) pseudotype viruses: pseudotypes containing the VSV genome and the HIV envelope infect HeLa-CD4 cells but fail to replicate the VSV genome in NIH 3T3-CD4 cells. The block in these murine cells appears to be in entry, reflecting an important, and as yet unresolved, postbinding entry event.\n\nVirions of the herpes group are considerably more complex than the viruses just discussed. They are believed to carry a t least five antigenically distinct glycoproteins. Penetration occurs by membrane fusion. The gB protein is essential for entry and appears to be involved in fusion but not in binding (Ali et al., 1987) . A role in fusion has also been suggested for the gD protein (Ali et al., 1987; Campadelli-Fiume et al., 1988; Fuller and Spear, 1987; Sarnieto et al., 1979) . Morphological studies indicate that virions are internalized, and that this may occur in coated vesicles. However, fusion can either occur at the plasma membrane or following endocytosis, and it remains unclear whether both routes give rise to productive infection (Campadelli -Fiume et al., 1988) .\n\nThe receptor for EBV, the CR2 complement receptor, is expressed primarily on B lymphocytes. The virions are up to 250 nm in diameter and thus considerably larger than the average coated vesicle. Epstein-Barr virus is, indeed, observed to enter into noncoated vesicles, possibly by phagocytosis (Nemerow et al., 1985; Tanner et al., 1987) . Cytomegalovirus is believed to require exposure to low pH, as infection can be blocked by weak bases (J. McKeating, personal communication) .\n\nCompared to enveloped viruses, less is known about the penetration and uncoating of nonenveloped viruses. Endocytic uptake of adenoviruses, reoviruses, polyomaviruses, picornaviruses, and other viruses has been observed both biochemically and morphologically (Dales, 1973 (Dales, ,1978 Griffiths and Consigli, 1986; Silverstein and Dales, 1968) , and a requirement for exposure to acid pH is inferred for several nonenveloped viruses from experiments in which infection is inhibited by acidotropic weak bases or carboxylic ionophores (Madshus et al., 1984a-c; Pastan et al., 1986; Stuzenbecker et al., 1987) . The general mechanism of penetration through a cellular membrane probably involves a conformational change in the viral particle which confers on it hydrophobic, membrane-binding properties. This change may allow the viruses to become embedded in the cellular membrane and provide a mechanism for releasing the genome through the membrane.\n\nA deep \"canyon\" or pit on the surface picornaviruses has been proposed as the receptor binding site. The amino acids lining the cavity are more conserved between the various viruses than other surface residues (Rossman and Palmerberg, 1988) . Endocytic uptake of various picornaviruses has been observed morphologically and analyzed biochemically (Dales, 1973; Mandel, 1967; Zeichardt et al., 1985) . It seems to be required for infectious entry of poliovirus type 1 and rhinoviruses. Infectivity is blocked by acidotropic amines, carboxylic ionophores, and reagents that inhibit endocytosis or endosome acid-ification (2-deoxy-~-glucose, NaN,) (Madshus et al., 1984a-c) . The block can be bypassed if cells with bound viruses are briefly incubated at low pH (Madshus et al., 1984a) . In isolated virions low pH induces changes in the capsid. In many cases this leads to loss of the VP4 protein and RNA, as well as to an increase in hydrophobicity and a change in isoelectric point. When polioviruses are incubated with cells or isolated membranes a similar change occurs, resulting in subviral particles that have lost the smallest structural protein VP4 and the viral RNA. It is possible that the extrusion of VP4, which is myristylated and therefore rather hydrophobic, may be significant in the translocation and mechanism (Paul et al., 1987; Chow et al., 1987) . The conformational change in the virus particles also leads to exposure of the amino terminus of VP1, which helps attach the virus to lipid vesicles (Hogle, 1988) . The changes are observed during normal entry into cells, and they are inhibited by weak bases, suggesting that low pH is responsible for conformational changes in the virions during penetration (Madshus et al., 1984a,b) . In addition to exposure to low pH, a pH gradient across the membrane appears to be required for penetration (Madshus et al., 1984a) . Thus acetic acid-induced acidification of the cytoplasm can inhibit poliovirus infection.\n\nIt has been suggested that occupation of receptor binding sites on the surface of the picornavirus capsids might facilitate disruption of the pentamer-pentamer contacts in the capsid and provide a port by which VP4 and RNA can exit the virion, accompanied by a change in the isoelectric point of the virus (Rossmann et al., 1985) . Experiments on the pH dependence of the conformational changes observed in poliovirus type l support this idea. The changes are influenced both by temperature and association of the virus with a cell. In free virus the conformational changes are half-maximal at pH 5.0, following binding to cells they are half-maximal at pH 6.1-6.5 (Madshus et al., 1984a,b) . Thus receptor binding may assist in unlocking the capsid.\n\nAlthough acidotropic reagents and carboxylic ionophores inhibit the entry of poliovirus, HRV type 2, and foot-and-mouth disease virus (Carrillo et al., 1984; Madshus et al., 1984b) , they do not block the entry of all picornaviruses. Infection by murine encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus is, in fact, enhanced by monensin (Madshus et al., 1984b) .\n\nThe endocytosis of adenovirus has been observed morphologically, and a low-pH-dependent step has been implicated in its penetration (Dales, 1973 (Dales, , 1978 Pastan et al., 1986) . Morphological experiments show that virions are internalized in coated vesicles and delivered to endosomes (Dales, 1978; Pastan et al., 1986) . Further studies at the morphological and biochemical level suggest that the viruses are released into the cytosol in intact form by lysis of endosomes (Dales, 1978; Pastan et al., 1986) . It has, moreover, been suggested that the lytic reaction is catalyzed by a viral factor which is activated by low pH (Pastan et al., 1986) . Cells treated with weak bases (chloroquine and methylamine) are protected from infection, and the virions do not undergo acid-induced changes which render the viral proteins more hydrophobic (Pastan et al., 1986) . As already mentioned, morphological evidence suggests that, following penetration from endosomes, the virion releases its genome into the nucleus through nuclear pores (Dales, 1978) .\n\nReoviruses are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, through coated pits and coated vesicles, and delivered to endosomes and lysosomes (Silverstein and Dales, 1968; Sturzenbecker et al., 1987) . A variation in the theme of pH-induced changes seems to occur. The viral outer capsids are proteolytically digested to produce partially uncoated subviral particles which are able to penetrate.\n\nEntry of reovirus types 1 and 3 into mouse L cells in inhibited by NH4C1 (Sturzenbecker et al., 1987) . The inhibitor acts early in entry, within 1 hour of virus addition, and does not influence the binding, endocytosis, or intracellular routing of the virus. It blocks the digestion of the outer capsid proteins. If virions are digested with protease prior to infection, subviral particles are produced that are infectious and insensitive to NH4C1. It is unknown whether the acid-dependent protease is viral or cellular, but it is clear that digestion is an essential step in entry.\n\nThe fact that low pH and proteolytic digestion are important for entry in tissue culture cells does not mean that the same process occurs in the intact animal. Infection appears to occur through specialized M cells of the small intestine, and in order to reach these cells the viruses must pass through the acid hydrolytic environment of the stomach. How this \"pretreatment\" affects the virus is unclear (Wolf et al., 1983) .\n\nInterest in early virus-cell interactions is rapidly growing. For enveloped viruses some well-characterized paradigms have now been established, and relatively clear-cut diagnostic tests are available to determine general properties of entry in other systems. The main chal-lenges for the future are the identification of cell surface receptors, the characterization of the virus-receptor interactions at the molecular level, the elucidation of translocation, membrane fusion, and uncoating mechanisms, and the analysis of early cytoplasmic and nuclear events. The membrane translocation mechanisms of nonenveloped viruses remain particularly enigmatic.\n\nMost of the successes so far have been limited to tissue culture cells. The question of entry in the whole organism, and its role in determining cell tropism and pathogenesis, must now be addressed. More work should also be invested in therapeutic and prophylactic strategies based on our knowledge about early virus-cell interactions.\n\nIt will be important to keep abreast with progress in a wide field of adjoining disciplines such as cell biology, molecular and structural biology, membrane biochemistry, and physiology. These areas provide the basis for understanding early virus-cell interactions. The exchange of information with other disciplines goes both ways: the work on virus entry has already greatly enhanced our understanding of endocytosis, membrane fusion, and organelle acidification. While each virus will turn out to have special features in respect to entry, the overall principles will probably be common to many. We are not yet at a point where these principles are known, and continued parallel work with a variety of different viruses is needed."}
