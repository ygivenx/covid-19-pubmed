{"title": "Molecular diversity of proteins in biological offense and defense systems", "body": "The biodiversity of living organisms on Earth is the result of a perpetual evolutional process. One approach to tracing this process is through the application of currently available biomolecular techniques which, in particular, enable gene and protein sequences to be analyzed. The recent advances that have been made in a number of genome projects aimed at determining the genomes of various living species, including the human genome, have enabled scientists to view evolution within the framework of whole genome structures and, subsequently, be able to compare genomes between species.\n\nTo date, almost every study on molecular evolution has focused on individual genes or proteins. However, in order to be able to understand the evolutionary mechanism of diversified proteins in molecular networks, one must acquire a system-wide perspective, including the us-or-them war of survival. One of the important questions in molecular evolution is: How can new adaptations to proteins recognize the target molecules to be obtained in the complex biological networks? An applicable example of the evolutionary mechanism at work are adaptations in network, biological defense and offense systems. These two systems are essentially equal and identical with the exception of the target protein; i.e. biological defense molecules such as anti-bacterial proteins are produced in humans as offensive molecules against bacteria; conversely, the bacterial toxins are offensive molecules against humans but defensive molecules for the bacterial cell itself. Interactions between species, such as paragenetic and hostile correlations, must affect the evolutional processes of the interacting species.\n\nThe mechanism by which genes and proteins have evolved in a molecular context is believed to be through the fixation and chance adaptation of errors that occurred in the genome during gene replication and/or repair. Alternative splicing and gene duplication are well-known major mechanisms for generating new functional and evolutionary molecular diversities of proteins [1, 2] . More recently, some hot topics have attracted the attention of many researchers: the role of gene duplication in the emergence of novel functions, adaptive molecular evolution versus neutral drift and the identification of molecular evolutional pathways responsible for various human characteristics pertaining to infection and disease. Rapid adaptive evolution, which is characterized by a higher mutation rate of nonsynonymous nucleotides (causing amino acid change) to synonymous ones (not causing amino acid change) and/ or by the higher mutation rate of coding region/exons compared to those of non-coding/introns, has been identified in several gene families, including that of 'Biological offense & defense systems' and 'Reproduction' (see Table 1 and Ref. [59 -61] ).\n\nIn this special issue of Molecular Diversity, we focus on the molecular evolution of proteins in biological offense and defense systems: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family proteins and their receptors, including recently identified snake venom-derived VEGFs (Yasuo Yamazaki and Takashi Morita), snake neurotoxins (Toru Tamiya and Takahiko J. Fujimi) and spider toxins (Pierre Escoubas) in biological offense systems. Furthermore, five unique examples of biological defense systems are described: adaptive rapid evolution of the Siglec family of cell-surface lectins (Takashi Angata), conger eel galectins (Tsuyoshi Shirai et al.), b-defensins (Julia R. Dorin and Colin Semple), RNase A superfamily (Kimberly Dyer and Helene F. Rosenberg) and insects' immunoglobulin superfamily (Shoichiro Kurata). Thus, the readers will be able to get an overall feeling for the field in general as well as acquire some insight into each unique case of proteins in biological offense and defense systems and, consequently into the molecular evolution of proteins. This special issue will no doubt provide interesting reading material.\n\nI would like to thank to contributors for their support, and also gratefully acknowledge the help received from the reviewers in evaluating the manuscripts.
