{"title": "Diversification of importin-\u03b1 isoforms in cellular trafficking and disease states", "body": "Nucleocytoplasmic transport is central to the function of eukaryotic cells and an integral part of the processes that lead to many human diseases. Over the past 30 years, dramatic progress in cell, molecular and structural biology has been instrumental in elucidating the soluble factors mediating the trafficking of cargoes through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), the organization, architecture and assembly of the NPC, and the mechanisms of translocation through it. The overall picture emerging from this large body of work describes nucleocytoplasmic transport as a signal-and energy-mediated process through the large aqueous channel of the NPC, which functions as a semipermeable filter. The importin \u03b2superfamily, named for the founder importin \u03b2 (also known as karyopherin \u03b21) [1] , represents the major class of soluble transport receptors involved in shuttling cargoes through the NPC. Importin \u03b2 functions as a transport receptor by coordinating three biochemical activities: (i) high-affinity binding to a basic nuclear localization signal (NLS) exposed by import cargoes; (ii) avidity for phenylalanine-glycine repeats exposed by several nucleoporins (FG-nups) protruding into the cytoplasm and lining the NPC; and (iii) highaffinity association with Ras-related nuclear protein GTP (RanGTP) which triggers a conformational change to release both NLS-cargoes and FG-nups. Importin \u03b2 can associate with import cargoes either directly or via adaptors, such as snurportin or importin \u03b1 [2] . These adaptors can be thought of as specialized cargoes that carry a potent N-terminal NLS, known as the importin \u03b2-binding (IBB) domain [3] . Import cargoes expose NLS sequences, exemplified by the monopartite SV40 large Tantigen NLS and the bipartite nucleoplasmin NLS [4] , which bind the adapter importin \u03b1 in the presence of importin \u03b2, initiating what is known as the 'classic' nuclear import pathway ( Figure 1 ). The heterotrimeric importin \u03b2/\u03b1/NLS-cargo complex ( Figure 2 ) shuttles through the NPC and delivers the NLS-cargo into the nucleus in a process aided by the small RanGTPase. Although a detailed description of nuclear transport is beyond the scope of the present review, several excellent reviews describing mechanisms governing nucleocytoplasmic transport have been published in recent years [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . In the present review, wefocus on a surprising aspect of the biology of importin \u03b1: unlike importin \u03b2, which is encoded by a single gene in all eukaryotes, at least seven isoforms of importin \u03b1 exist in higher eukaryotes. These isoforms display remarkable substrate specificity in vivo, which is not always repeated in vitro. The present review focuses on the biology of importin \u03b1 isoforms: we take an inventory of known NLS-cargoes specific to importin \u03b1 isoforms and critically analyse their role in cell physiology and involvement in human diseases.\n\nFunctional diversification of the adaptor importin \u03b1 has occurred throughout the evolution of multicellular animals, paralleling the increasingly complex requirements of higher organisms with their need to perform cell-and tissue-specific functions during development and differentiation [14] . Saccaromyces cerevisiae has a single gene encoding orthologues of importin \u03b2 and importin \u03b1 (known as Kap95 and Kap60, respectively). Three importin-\u03b1 isoforms exist in Drosophila melanogaster and as many as seven isoforms are found in vertebrates ( Figure 3 ). Human importin-\u03b1 isoforms are well conserved, with 26% identity and 42% conservation in their amino acid sequences, as determined by ClustalW alignment [15] and the BLOSUM62 similarity matrix [16] . They can be divided into three subfamilies: the \u03b11 subfamily containing importin \u03b11 and \u03b18; the \u03b12 subfamily containing importin \u03b13 and \u03b14; and the \u03b13 subfamily, containing importin \u03b15, \u03b16 and \u03b17 (Table 1) . A growing number of cellular (Table 2 ) and viral (Table 3 ) cargoes rely on specific importin-\u03b1 isoforms for transport into the nucleus, and important differences in the regulation of these isoforms are just beginning to be understood. also resolved when complexed with PB2 [35] , and a fragment of importin \u03b16 spanning armadillo (Arm) 7-10 was recently found bound to Ebola virus VP24 [52] (see Table 1 ).\n\nAll importin-\u03b1 isoforms are expressed to some extent in all adult cell types [21, 41, 53] , with the exception of importin \u03b16, which is limited to the testis [41] , and importin \u03b18, the expression of which is restricted to the ovaries and early stage embryos [37, 54] . However, the relative intracellular concentration of isoforms \u03b11, \u03b13, \u03b14, \u03b15 and \u03b17 has not been accurately determined, and it is not known if any particular isoform is generally abundant. Furthermore, it is increasingly appreciated that the distribution of importin-\u03b1 isoforms across different cell types and at different developmental stages is important in development and normal cellular functions, e.g. mouse neural differentiation displays a specific expression sequence of importin \u03b1: a gradient from high initial importin \u03b11 and low importin \u03b13 and \u03b15, to lower importin \u03b11 and high importin \u03b13 and \u03b15 as differentiation progresses [55] . An additional layer of import regulation in neural differentiation comes from the evidence that certain cargoes such as Oct6 or Brn2 can bind to multiple importin-\u03b1 isoforms, but their transport outcome varies depending on the isoform. Binding to importin \u03b15 leads to successful nuclear import, whereas binding to importin \u03b11 inhibits cargo import, causing cytoplasmic retention [56] . Notably, these cargoes bind an importin-\u03b11 C-terminalbinding section (iCBS), possibly in a similar fashion to Nup50 [57, 58].\n\nThe exact mechanism by which importin \u03b11 prevents nuclear import is unknown, but two possible scenarios are either difficulty in complex disassembly or conformational change in the import complex which prevents its import [56] . An examination of importin-\u03b1 isoform expression in different regions of the mouse brain, at various stages after birth, also shows interesting changes in distribution over time and regions of the brain [59]. Likewise, importin-\u03b1 isoform expression in spermatogenesis has been extensively studied, showing significant variations in expression levels of importin \u03b11, in particular, throughout the process [58, 60, 61] . Any one of the importin \u03b14, \u03b15, \u03b17 or \u03b18 knockouts in mice did not lead to abnormal brain development [54, [62] [63] [64] [65] , suggesting that the loss of a single isoform gene is probably compensated for in vivo by an isoform of the same subfamily. Instead, the importin \u03b15 and \u03b17 knockouts led to reproductive problems in female mice and the importin \u03b18 knockout causes reduced fertility and sex imbalance in litters due to induced lethality in females [54], suggesting some non-redundant function of these isoforms in reproduction. There have been several recent studies using a proteomic approach to understand cargo specificity in spermatogenesis and development, although they have generally been looking at cargoes only in the context of one or two isoforms rather than the full range [58, 66, 67] .\n\nAll importin-\u03b1 isoforms share a fundamentally conserved structure consisting of an Nterminal, autoinhibitory, IBB domain spanning approximately the first 70 residues and a Cterminal helical core containing Armadillo repeats (Arm-core) (see Figure 2 ). Despite the high sequence similarity, importin-\u03b1 isoforms present subtle differences in 3D structure and biochemical properties which contribute to their in vivo specificity for specialized import cargoes.\n\nThe central core of all importin-\u03b1 isoforms is built by 10 stacked Arm repeats [ Figure 4A (i)] and structurally very similar to Kap60 [68] . Secondary structure matching of the four human importin-\u03b1 isoforms found crystallographically (\u03b11, \u03b13, \u03b15 and \u03b17) (see Table 1 ) with Kap60 yields an RMSD of between 0.8 and 1.7 \u00c5 (1 \u00c5 = 0.1 nm), underlining a remarkable degree of conservation between the yeast and human proteins. The Arm repeats [ Figure 4A (ii)] of importin \u03b1 are very similar to the HEAT repeats [ Figure 4A (iv)] found in importin \u03b2; in both proteins, stacks of Arm/HEAT repeats generate superhelical solenoids, which are highly specialized to participate in protein-protein interactions [1, 12] . HEAT repeats are composed of two \u03b1-helices (named H1 and H2) arranged as a hairpin, which allows for extremely flexible assemblies [69] . In contrast, in Arm repeats the first helix splits into two helices to make a total of three helices (named H1, H2 and H3), which have a triangular arrangement, leading to more rigid assemblies [70, 71] . In all importin-\u03b1 isoforms, two Arm repeats deviate from the standard three-helix architecture: Arm 1, which lacks the first helix (H1) [ Figure 4A (iii)] and Arm 5 which has helices H1 and H2 fused together, making it essentially a HEAT repeat [ Figure 4A (iv)]. Stacking of Arm repeats generates an extended concave surface, which harbours NLS-binding pockets, and a convex surface. Superimposition of the Arm-core of importin \u03b11, \u03b13, \u03b15 and \u03b17 reveals that the NLSbinding surface is practically identical in all the isoforms [35], whereas the convex surface is quite variable ( Figure 4B ). This implies that differences in import cargo specificity and binding affinity among importin \u03b1 isoforms cannot be ascribed to the NLS-binding surface, which is fundamentally identical in all of the a isoforms.\n\nThe Arm-core of importin \u03b1 has generally been considered to be essentially rigid compared with flexible HEAT-containing proteins such as importin \u03b2 [71, 72] . However, recent molecular dynamic simulations comparing the flexibility of mouse importin \u03b11, and human importins \u03b13 and \u03b17, revealed that importin \u03b13 has a greater range of extension and compression than the other isoforms, potentially due to a hinge at the major NLS-binding site [35] . This flexibility may result in lower binding affinity for classic NLSs at the major NLS-binding pocket and contribute to decreased IBB domain autoinhibition. In direct relation to the flexibility of Arm-core, the initial structure of importin \u03b15, determined when complexed with PB2, had a domain swap of Arm 10's helix H3 between adjacent molecules in the crystal [50], although two subsequent structures found with this isoform show Arm-10 helices neatly stacked (Protein Databank PDBs 3TJ3 and 4B18) [51] . Although the physiological significance of this domain swap is unclear, Arm-10 unfolding in importin \u03b15 may be due to the presence of a bulky Tyr 476 at the interface of helices H1 and H2 [ Figure  4B (v)]. This residue, which is conserved only in members of the \u03b13 subfamily, but replaced by a glycine in all other isoforms, was proposed to swing inwards between helices H1 and H2, thereby preventing the intramolecular stacking essential to stabilize the folded conformation of Arm 10. Introducing a glycine/alanine at this position in isoforms \u03b15 and \u03b16, as in importin \u03b11, disrupts high-affinity binding to pSTAT1 [49] and Ebola virus VP24\n\n[52], suggesting that an intrinsic flexibility of Arm 10 could be important for binding to nonclassic cargoes interacting with the C-terminus of \u03b13-subfamily members.\n\nSimilar to Kap60, the murine importin \u03b11 was also found to be autoinhibited by its IBB domain [22] . The latter contains a bipartite basic sequence ('RRRR(X) 17 KRR') and, in the absence of importin \u03b2, it folds back to occupy the NLS-binding surface of importin \u03b1 ( Figure 5A ). The first basic motif binds at the minor NLS pocket (Arm 6-8) whereas the second basic motif occupies the major NLS-binding box (Arm 2-4) [22, [73] [74] [75] . The intramolecular interaction between IBB domain and Arm-core prevents binding of importin \u03b2 to an empty importin \u03b1, thus representing a regulatory mechanism to prevent futile nuclear translocation of unloaded import complexes. IBB domain autoinhibition is essential in vivo in yeasts, and probably in higher eukaryotes [76] , and was initially thought to occur in all human importin-\u03b1 isoforms. In contrast, recent studies revealed that IBB autoinhibition varies greatly among isoforms and each isoform can be differentially autoinhibited for different NLS-cargoes, e.g. both importin \u03b13 and \u03b15/\u03b17 are significantly less autoinhibited than importin \u03b11 [35]. This is probably explained by subtle differences in the IBB-domain amino acid sequence ( Figure 5B ): although the major NLS-binding box ('KRR') is conserved in all importin-\u03b1 isoforms, the minor NLS-binding cluster shows significant differences. Importin \u03b11, \u03b15, \u03b16 and \u03b17 all have 'RRRR' as their minor NLS-binding box, whereas importin \u03b13/\u03b14 lacks the third arginine ('RRQR' and 'RRHR', respectively). Furthermore, in \u03b13-subfamily isoforms (\u03b15/\u03b16/\u03b17), the 'RRRR' motif is surrounded by an exceptionally acidic patch containing as many as five glutamate/aspartate residues.\n\nThe ability to overcome IBB domain autoinhibition also varies greatly among NLS sequences. Monopartite SV40-like NLSs are usually insufficient to overcome IBB autoinhibition and, thus, bind importin-\u03b1 isoforms exclusively in the presence of importin \u03b2. In contrast, recent studies have shown that certain cargoes containing highly basic bipartite or certain non-classic NLSs are able to bind importin-\u03b1 isoforms efficiently in the absence of importin \u03b2; noticeable examples include RCC1 [77] , STAT1 [49] and influenza A virus PB2 [35] . In addition, importin \u03b18 presents several variations in the IBB region that make it different from all other isoforms ( Figure 5B ). In this isoform, which has a predominant nuclear localization, the IBB domain binds with a stronger affinity to importin \u03b2 and the Arm-core, but shows very weak binding to classic NLS peptides, even in the absence of its IBB domain [36] . Thus, what was once thought to be a universal feature of all isoforms of importin \u03b1, autoinhibition, appears to be generally weaker in isoforms of the subfamilies \u03b12 and \u03b13 and strictly cargo dependent.\n\nThe interaction between importin-\u03b1 isoforms and viral proteins has been studied since study of the nuclear transport field started, e.g. the prototypical monopartite NLS sequence (P 126 KKKRRV 132 ), found in hundreds of cellular factors, is derived from the large T antigen of SV40 [78] , and the leucine-rich nuclear export signal was first identified in the HIV Rev protein [79] . Intuitively, viruses have proteins that need to enter the nucleus to hijack the host DNA and use the cell's transcriptional machinery. Some viruses have adapted to acquire specificity for certain importin-\u03b1 isoforms, although the advantage of this specialization is not well understood. Table 3 presents a comprehensive list of all viral proteins known to interact with specific importin-\u03b1 isoforms. Among them, influenza virus NP was one of the first identified NLS-cargoes to interact with importin \u03b1. Subsequent work showed that importin \u03b11 also binds strongly and imports NP, whereas importin \u03b13 associates only weakly with this cargo [80, 81] . HIV-1 integrase, on the other hand, relies on only isoform \u03b13 [82] and, in addition, uses a member of the \u03b2-karyopherin family, transportin, to gain access to the nucleus [83] .\n\nIn a more complex example, influenza A virus polymerase subunit PB2, a major virulence determinant implicated in pathogenicity and host adaptation [84] , has been shown to have a preference for importin \u03b13 in avian influenza strains. By contrast, in mammalian-adapted strains, PB2 switches dependency to importin \u03b17 [63, 85, 86] , possibly as a result of a limited set of point mutations. Recent work has proposed that the preferential utilization of isoforms \u03b13 and \u03b17 is probably explained by the differential degree of IBB domain autoinhibition for PB2 in these two isoforms, and by the complex structure of the PB2 NLS domain, which contains a bipartite NLS next to a globular domain [35, 50] . In vitro binding assays revealed that PB2 efficiently competes with the IBB domain of isoforms \u03b13 and to a lesser extent \u03b17 in the absence of importin \u03b2, whereas it is autoinhibited from binding importin \u03b11 [35]. However, PB2 associates with comparable nanomolar affinity to the Arm-core of all isoforms in the absence of the IBB domain [87] . Another important viral protein, HIV-1 Vpr, can also bind to the C-terminal Arm repeats of importin-\u03b1 isoforms from all three families [88, 89] , but recent studies have shown a distinct preference for importin \u03b15. Intriguingly, although Vpr binds with similar affinity to all tested isoforms, only importin \u03b15 efficiently released Vpr in the presence of the recycling factor CAS, and, furthermore, silencing CAS inhibited Vpr import [90] . It is unclear why CAS can induce preferential release of Vpr from importin \u03b15, but it suggests a possible additional layer of complexity in the specificity.\n\nIn addition to promoting viral genome replication/transcription and virion assembly, another critical viral function is to evade the host's immune response. The JAK (Janus kinase)/ STAT pathway is critical in initiating the immune response to viral infections, so, unsurprisingly, it is a target for suppression by many viruses, e.g. both Ebola virus VP24 and hepatitis B polymerase block STAT1 nuclear import by binding to the C-terminus of importin \u03b15, thereby preventing transcription of STAT1-dependent interferon genes [91, 92] . VP24 has also been found to bind to other members of the \u03b13 family [93] , and a recent structure complexed with importin \u03b16 reveals that it binds to C-terminal Arm 7-10, as opposed to the NLS-binding pockets [52] . VP24 association with importin \u03b15 does not prevent a classic NLS-cargo from binding, suggesting that VP24 specifically blocks STAT1 import rather than all importin-\u03b15-mediated import. However, it was also found that VP24 forms oligomers that bind to the plasma membrane [94] , which could effectively sequester importin \u03b15 in the cytoplasm and prevent any cargo relying on the \u03b13 family shuttling through the NPC. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ORF6 also blocks STAT1 signalling by an indirect mechanism, via the sequestration of importin \u03b11 on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum [95] . Although importin \u03b11 as such does not import STAT1, it has been hypothesized that loss of \u03b11 increases competition for importin-\u03b15 binding, thereby reducing the net influx of STAT1 into the nucleus. A follow-up paper from the same group identified additional transcription factors, the transcription of which was disrupted by the ORF6 sequestration of importin \u03b11, and some of these factors, such as cAMP response element-binding protein 1 (CREB1), SMAD4, p53 and Oct3/4, are important in the response to viral infection [96] . In addition to targeting importin \u03b1, the nonclassic NLS of STAT1 is itself a target for reducing the antiviral response. A well-known example is the vaccinia virus protein VH1 [97] , which dephosphorylates Tyr 701 of STAT1 [98, 99] , thereby causing a conformational change that prevents exposure of STAT1's nonclassic NLS to importin \u03b15 [49], and blocks nuclear import and transcription of interferon genes.\n\nImportin-\u03b1 isoform expression is altered in many forms of cancer. In most cases, the upregulation of the KPNA2 gene (encoding importin \u03b11, see Table 1 ) indicates a poor prognosis, making it a useful biomarker in breast [100] , ovarian [101] , cervical [102] , prostate [103] and bladder [104] cancer, melanoma [105] , squamous cell carcinoma [106] , hepatocellular carcinoma [107] , lung cancer [108] , astrocytic glioma [109] and anaplastic oligoastrocytoma [110] . In some cases, knock down of importin \u03b11 with siRNA could reduce the proliferation of cancerous cells [103, 108] , but in others it had no effect [102] . Of particular interest was a xenograft study of epithelial ovarian carcinoma in mice, in which transplanted tumours either had KPNA2 knocked down with siRNA, or additionally induced. It was found that knockdown of KPNA2 reduced tumour volume, whereas increased expression of KPNA2 increased tumour volume [111] . Other nucleocytoplasmic transporters, such as importin \u03b2 [102] and CRM1 [102, 110] , are also found to be upregulated in some cancers. One proposed mechanism for this up-regulation is the deregulated activity of the E2F transcription factor, which can up-regulate both KPNA2 and the importin-\u03b2 gene [112] . E2F is itself regulated by the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) pathway, which is frequently disrupted in cancer. Another importin-\u03b1 isoform found to have irregular expression in cancerous cells is importin \u03b18. Normally expressed only in oocytes and early embryos, irregular expression of importin \u03b18 in several pancreatic cancer cell lines contributes significantly to the proliferation of these cells [38] .\n\nSpecific importin-\u03b1 isoforms play a role in both normal and abnormal brain and neuron function (reviewed by Perry and Fainzilber [113] ). Importin \u03b1 has been identified as critical in the neurons' ability to start a regenerative response in injured nerve. Importin \u03b1 and \u03b2 form a high-affinity complex with STAT3 that traffics retrogradely with the motor protein dynein from the axon back to the nucleus [114] . In an interesting variation on its role as a karyopherin, importin \u03b15 was found to be critical as an adaptor to microtubules. Knock down of importin \u03b15 in injured neurons blocked STAT3 signalling after injury, but direct injection of STAT3 into the axonal bodies, where it can be imported by other importin-\u03b1 isoforms, could rescue STAT3 signalling [115] , suggesting a unique role for importin \u03b15 as a multifunctional transporter. Specific importin-\u03b1 isoform expression has also been implicated in neuronal differentiation and development [55] . Analysis of the expression of importin-\u03b1 isoforms in different regions of the mouse brain between birth and adulthood shows a distinct shift in levels and ratios of importin-\u03b1 isoform expression [59] . A mutation in human importin \u03b18 has also been found to be associated with improper neuronal development [116] . However, the redundancy of the importin-\u03b1 isoforms still allows for proper brain development even when one of these isoforms is lost, as seen when importin \u03b15 was knocked down in mice [62] .\n\nImportin-\u03b1 isoforms can also play a role in diseased states of the brain, e.g. in schizophrenia, importin-\u03b13 expression is decreased, resulting in reduced NF-\u03baB signalling. This loss of expression is associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the KPNA4 gene (encoding importin \u03b13), which is also a marker for increased susceptibility to schizophrenia [117] . In addition, certain SNPs of the KPNA3 gene (encoding importin \u03b14) have been correlated with susceptibility to schizophrenia in some populations [118, 119] . Importin \u03b11 is also misregulated in Alzheimer's disease, due to it sequestration in the Hirano bodies of hippocampal neurons. The cause of this sequestration is unclear, but its result is a distinct mislocalization of critical NLS-cargoes, such as p27 [120] .\n\nRecent studies have shown a loss of importin-\u03b1 expression in ageing myocardial tissues. In myocardial endothelial cells, a reduction in the levels of both importin \u03b11 and importin \u03b13 mRNA and protein was associated with reduced import of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1, which regulates vascular endothelial growth factor expression, a key component in angiogenesis. Thus, loss of importin-\u03b1 expression in ageing myocardial cells could make recovery after heart disease more difficult for elderly patients [121] . In a study of human fibroblasts, the expression of importin \u03b11 decreased steadily from children to adults to elderly people, whereas importin-\u03b2 expression over this range was consistent [122] . In addition to loss of importin \u03b11 in ageing myocardial cells, the microRNA miR-181b is able to reduce the signalling of NF-\u03baB in the vascular endothelium by knocking down importin \u03b13 expression [123] . The classic NF-\u03baB p50/p65 heterodimer was first identified as specific to importin \u03b13 and \u03b14 [43], but subsequent studies have shown that it can also bind to members of the \u03b13 family, depending on the expression system, implicating posttranslational modifications [124] . This is corroborated by the observation that loss of importin \u03b13 in the vascular endothelium blocks NF-\u03baB signalling, but is compensated for by importin \u03b15 in leukocytes [125] .\n\nThe nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of NF-\u03baB also plays a key role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Prohibitin (PHB) 1 is found to be down-regulated during IBD by tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), along with increased NF-\u03baB signalling. However, when expression of PHB is restored, NF-\u03baB signalling is reduced. Theiss et al [126] determined that expression of PHB caused suppression of importin \u03b13 and \u03b14, thus preventing the nuclear import of NF-\u03baB despite cell stimulation; however, the mechanism for this suppression is unknown. Similarly, NF-\u03baB and STAT3 signalling are found to be increased in nephropathy due to the down-regulation of miR-223, which causes increased expression of importin \u03b14 and \u03b15 [127] .\n\nAn attentive review of the literature suggests at least four distinct strategies by which the availability of importin-\u03b1 isoforms is controlled and regulated in response to endogenous and viral effectors (illustrated in Figure 6 ).\n\nThe pool of importin-\u03b1 isoforms can be reduced at the transcriptional level by microRNAmediated degradation of importin-\u03b1 isoform mRNAs. Glinsky et al [128] predicted that importin \u03b1, and importin \u03b15 in particular, is a major microRNA target in a variety of human diseases. This prediction was corroborated by subsequent studies with miR-181b, which was found to specifically down-regulate importin-\u03b13 expression, thereby blocking NF-\u03baB import and signalling in epithelial cells ( Figure 6A ) [123, 125] . A microRNA not included in the Glinsky analysis, miR-223, was found to block expression of importin \u03b14 and \u03b15; accordingly, decreased expression of miR-223 in nephropathy led to increased signalling of NF-\u03baB and STAT1, possibly by expression of isoforms \u03b14 and \u03b15, respectively [127] .\n\nImportin-\u03b1 availability can be altered post-translationally by sequestration. As previously described, Ebola VP24 binds the C-terminus of the \u03b13-subfamily isoforms, competing for binding with STAT1 and thereby blocking its import ( Figure 6B ). An endogenous factor that uses a similar strategy is ARHI, a Ras homologue, which acts as a tumour suppressor and the expression of which is lost in many breast and ovarian cancers. ARHI binds several isoforms of importin \u03b1 -\u03b11, \u03b13, \u03b16 and \u03b17, but not \u03b15 -and, by doing so, it blocks import of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) and classic NLS-cargoes [129] .\n\nAnother approach to reducing nucleocytoplasmic transport of expressed importin-\u03b1 isoforms is targeted degradation. The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (see Table 2 ) can inhibit the interferon response by targeted proteasome-mediated degradation of pig importin \u03b15. PRRSV protein Nsp1\u03b2 mediates this degradation by causing an increase in ubiquitination of importin \u03b15, although the mechanism for this is unknown [130] . Similar behaviour is seen from the foot-and-mouth-disease virus protein 3C pro (see Table 2 ), which has protease activity and directly degrades importin \u03b15 [131] . There are also endogenous approaches to targeted degradation of importin \u03b1, implemented as a response to viral infection or during cell death. Natural killer cells of the immune system are able to fight viral replication by inducing apoptosis in target cells through release of a variety of proteolytic enzymes. Among these is granzyme K, which has been found to be of particular importance as a response to influenza infection [132] . Granzyme K is a tryptase and can cleave both importin \u03b1 and importin \u03b2 so that they cannot bind to each other, thus blocking cargo import ( Figure 6C ). Interestingly, it was observed that granzyme K could cleave all human importin \u03b1 isoforms at a location upstream of the IBB, at a conserved arginine residue critical for binding to importin \u03b2. This degradation has the effect of blocking viral replication by preventing the nuclear import of key influenza proteins such as NP and PB2 [133] . Importin-\u03b1 cleavage has also been found to play a role in apoptosis, when various caspases are capable of cleaving the IBB domain from importin \u03b11, \u03b13, \u03b14, and \u03b15. \u0394IBB importin \u03b1 could still accumulate in the nucleus, a behaviour seen previously for \u0394IBB importin \u03b1 from all families [134] , and was found to block DNA replication by sequestering the DNA replication licensing factor (MCM) [135] . Finally, importin \u03b15 was recently found to be a substrate for the ubiquitin ligase activity of RAG-1, perhaps as a method of regulation of RAG-1 activity [136] . RAG-1, best known for its role in V(D)J recombination, is also active as a ubiquitin ligase. Interestingly, although RAG-1 is imported into the nucleus by importin \u03b11, not importin \u03b15, it binds to importin \u03b15 weakly outside its functional NLS [137] .\n\nPost-translational modification of importin \u03b1 and NLS-cargoes can both up-and downregulate nuclear imports [138] . One excellent importin-\u03b1 isoform-specific example is the phosphorylation of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1). Although the unphosphorylated NLS is sufficient for nuclear import, it binds to its specific adaptor importin \u03b15 with low affinity. Phosphorylation of the NLS accelerates the rate of import and also significantly increases binding to importin \u03b15 [49, 139] . Phosphorylation and acetylation of the importin \u03b1 receptor itself have also been observed. Bannister et al. [140] found that the acetylation of importin \u03b11 by CBP/p300 at Lys 22 , upstream of the NLS, enhances association with importin \u03b2. CBP/p300 was also able to acetylate importin \u03b17 but not importin \u03b13. These authors identified a 'GK' motif as essential for acetylation of this importin \u03b11, though they did not test for this in importin \u03b17 [140] . Wang et al. [141] found that 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an upstream regulator of CBP/p300, thereby inducing importin-\u03b1 acetylation and, in addition, that AMPK itself could also phosphorylate importin \u03b11 at Ser 105 . The combination of these two modifications significantly up-regulates human antigen R (HuR) nuclear import, whereas transfection with importin-\u03b11 mutants lacking either modification site caused no increase in import. Acetylation at Lys 22 is predicted to increase the affinity of the IBB domain for importin \u03b2, whereas phosphorylation of Ser 105 is predicted to increase affinity for an NLS at the major NLS-binding pocket ( Figure 6D ) [141] . It is interesting to note that importin \u03b17 has a 'GK' motif several residues upstream of where it is found in importin \u03b11 (Lys 9 compared with Lys 22 ), so it is unclear if acetylation of this isoform would have the same effect as acetylation of importin \u03b11. Importin \u03b13, which is not acetylated, has no' GK' motif in the IBB domain. In addition, no other isoform has a serine near the equivalent of importin \u03b11's residue 105.\n\nIt has been 20 years since the discovery of human importin \u03b11 [17] , during which time a total of 7 isoforms and over 75 isoform-specific import cargoes have been identified (see Tables 2 and 3 ). As of September 2014, a Medline search for 'importin \u03b1' and 'isoform' identified 150 publications, signifying an explosion in the number of pathways recognized as mediated by specific importin-\u03b1 isoforms. As described in the present review, importin-\u03b1 isoforms play a pivotal role in the nuclear import of critically important transcription factors such as STATs and NF-\u03baB, recently identified as targets of importin \u03b15 and importin \u03b13, respectively. A precise display of importin-\u03b1 isoform expression also seems to be critical during development, particularly of the brain. Misregulation of specific importin-\u03b1 isoform expression, availability and activity occurs in disease states in response to pathogens and in cancer, which prompted many to use importin \u03b11 as a biomarker. Thus, apart from the classic role as 'karyopherins', importin-\u03b1 isoforms play a pleiotropic role as signalling molecules in cell physiology, development and human diseases.\n\nWhat makes importin-\u03b1 isoforms specific in vivo? On the basis of the literature reviewed here, we identify three factors that may help answer this question. First, in the simplest possible scenario, cell type availability of different isoforms could dictate specificity for certain import cargoes. The intracellular concentration of different isoforms has not been accurately determined, leaving open the possibility that the first discovered isoform, importin \u03b11, may not necessarily be the most abundant in all cell types. Furthermore, as previously described, there are several mechanisms to up-or down-regulate the relative concentration of specific importin-\u03b1 isoforms (i.e. microRNAs, sequestration, degradation and post-translational modifications), thereby generating fluctuations in the intracellular concentrationofimportin-\u03b1 isoforms which may lead to a preferential association with certain import cargos. Secondly, not all 'import cargoes are created equal' in a cell. In addition to the NLS, other binding determinants in an import cargo can provide preferential affinity, and hence specificity, to an importin-\u03b1 isoform. Good examples of this are nonclassic cargoes such as STAT1 [49] and VP24 [52] which strongly bind the C-terminus of importin \u03b1, outside the minor NLS-binding pocket. Alternatively, certain NLS-cargoes such as RCC1 [77] and PB2 [35] have NLSs flanked by a folded domain that contributes additional binding determinants for importin \u03b13. Finally, not all importin-\u03b1 isoforms are equally autoinhibited by their IBB domains, suggesting that different levels of intramolecular autoinhibition may determine preferences in association (and hence specificity) of an isoform for a given import cargo. Similarly the disassembly of an import cargo from an importin-\u03b1 isoform can potentially dictate isoform specificity, as in the case of Vpr. This small HIV-1-encoded protein binds to several importin-\u03b1 isoforms (see Table  3 ), but is specific for importin \u03b15 due to its inability to be removed from the other isoforms by CAS [90] . In all the strategies described above, post-translational modifications in both import cargoes and importin \u03b1 can modulate the affinity and hence specificity of a given isoform for an import cargo [142] .\n\nA goal of this field is to develop selective inhibitors that block specific isoforms (or similar isoforms within a subfamily) without affecting the bulk of NLS-cargoes moving through the NPC. There are already examples of peptides designed to target importin \u03b1 that block the classic nuclear import, such as cSN50.1, Bimax2 and ivermectin. Of these, only cSN50.1 has been shown to have importin-\u03b1 isoform specificity. It is a peptide based on the NLS of the NF-\u03baB subunit p50 [143] , shown to bind with nanomolar affinity to importin \u03b15 and only very weakly to other isoforms [144] . This peptide has been shown to block import of NF-\u03baB along with a variety of other key transcription factors, thereby suppressing proinflammatory signals [145, 146] . Bimax2, designed by Kosugi et al. [147] , is a monopartite NLS that acts as a high-affinity general inhibitor of the classic nuclear import pathway. Ivermectin is a small molecule commonly used as an anti-parasitic drug, which, it has recently been determined, blocks cargo binding to importin \u03b1 [148, 149] . In summary, the work done to date to understand the regulation of importin-\u03b1 isoform expression is just the tip of the iceberg; a thorough analysis of importin-\u03b1 isoform expression, in vivo interactions and post-translational regulation will allow better understanding of their role in cell physiology. Due to their function as gatekeepers to the nucleus and unique specialization for important signalling cargoes often associated with human disease, importin-\u03b1 isoforms are excellent targets for the development of new pharmacological agents.\n\nThis work was supported in part by a National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant (GM074846) to G.C.R.A.P. was supported by an NIH award (T32 GM100836) from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.\n\nArm armadillo The diagram is based on the structure of human importin \u03b2 (beige) bound to the IBB domain (dark blue; PDB 1QGK) and mouse importin \u03b12 (cyan) bound to the nucleoplasmin NLS (grey; PDB 1EJY).
