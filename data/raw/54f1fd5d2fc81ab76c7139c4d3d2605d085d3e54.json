{"title": "De Novo Design of \u03b1-Helical Lipopeptides Targeting Viral Fusion Proteins: A Promising Strategy for Relatively Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Drug Discovery", "body": "The traditional \"one bug\u2212one drug\" paradigm for the development of antiviral therapeutics has yielded laudable successes to control the emerging and re-emerging threat of viral pathogens. 1\u22123 However, a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy that affords timely and effective pharmacological agents that can respond to an increasing diversity of highly pathogenic viruses remains elusive. 4 A commonality in the viral life cycle, i.e., the fusion of enveloped viruses with the host cell membrane, represents a viable target for the discovery of broad-spectrum therapeutics. 5, 6 In this fusion process, the triggered formation of a leucine zipper-like \u03b1-helical hexamer, 7, 8 either at the cell surface or within some later endosomes, is the typical structural feature of class I fusion glycoproteins used by enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), 9\u221211 influenza A viruses (IAVs), 12 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 13 and Ebola virus (EboV) 14 ( Figure 1A) .\n\nDuring the coiled-coil six-helix bundle (6HB) assembly, three N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) regions of viral fusion proteins initially form a central trimeric helix scaffold that becomes temporarily exposed, creating a metastable prehairpin conformation; three C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) regions then pack onto the periphery of the trimeric NHR inner core in an antiparallel orientation. 15 Bioactive peptides derived from the CHR motif of class I viral fusion proteins, designated as Cpeptides, act as decoy \u03b1-helices and are able to bind to their corresponding NHR helical trimers to form a heterologous nonfunctional 6HB structure in a virus-specific manner, thereby antagonizing the refolding of the endogenous CHR region and competitively inhibiting virus\u2212host cell membrane fusion. 16 In 1993, Jiang and colleagues discovered a highly potent HIV-1 fusion inhibitory peptides derived from the CHR region of HIV-1 gp41, designated SJ-2176; in 1994, Wild et al. reported another CHR-peptide, DP-178 (also named T20 later). 17 ,18 T20 (brand name, Fuzeon; generic name, enfuvirtide) was finally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2003 for clinical use as the first fusion inhibitor-based anti-HIV drug. The discovery of these anti-HIV peptides spurred the identification of antiviral peptides against other viruses that utilize class I fusion proteins, including the recently identified MERS-CoV. After the emergence of MERS-CoV infection, Gao's group and Jiang's group independently solved the crystal structure of MERS-CoV's 6HB fusion core. 13, 19 On the basis of the 6HB structure, Jiang's group reported the highly effective anti-MERS-CoV peptide HR2PM2. Most recently, we identified a hydrocarbonstapled short \u03b1-helical peptide that could inhibit MERS-CoV infection at the low micromolar level. 20 Considering the universal 6HB fusion mechanism employed by class I enveloped viruses, inhibition of NHR/CHR coiled coilmediated interactions has significant potential for the development of broad-spectrum therapeutic interventions.\n\nCoiled coils are ubiquitous protein folding motifs found in nature, and they orchestrate the association of numerous complexes implicated in biological processes. 21 A wealth of structural information has provided a relatively detailed understanding of the sequence-to-structure relationships for this supercoiled scaffold. 22 In structural terms, amphipathic \u03b1helices encode canonical coiled coils via burial of their hydrophobic faces to drive the multimerization of constituent helices. 23 The hexameric coiled-coil assembly present in HIV-1 is arguably the best characterized class I viral fusion apparatus, 24, 25 in which the C-helices are divided into a hydrophobic buried binding interface and hydrophilic solventaccessible sites ( Figure 1B) . Structural analysis has demonstrated that a high variability in the primary sequence of CHR motifs within the HIV-1 6HB is allowed as long as the driving force for coiled-coil assembly, i.e., amphiphilic characteristics of the individual helices, is maintained. 26, 27 Accordingly, \u03b1helix-constrained HIV-neutralizing C-peptides, engineered by strategies such as salt bridges, 28, 29 helix-favoring amino acids, 30 and hydrophobic mutations in buried residues, 31 can significantly enhance the bundle stability compared with their corresponding wild-type ligands despite the substitution of approximately half of the parent residues.\n\nIncorporation of an alkyl hydrocarbon tail onto a peptide represents another promising \u03b1-helix-promoting technique. Recent studies on HIV-1 fusion inhibitors have revealed that lipid-conjugated C-peptides have a greatly increased \u03b1-helicity and NHR-binding capability. 32, 33 Moreover, for viruses that fuse at the cell surface, lipidation also provides the critical advantage of endowing C-peptides with the membrane-tropic feature. Enrichment of the local concentration of helical peptides at the membrane level further facilitates their assembly with the intermediate-stage NHR-helical trimers. 34 For intracellularly fusing viruses, lipidation allows antiviral peptides to internalize along with viruses into host cells, thereby arresting 6HB formation in the endosomes. 12 Taking advantage of the adjustability and tractability of \u03b1helix-mediated interactions in the 6HB core structure typical of class I viral fusion proteins, we herein describe a rational approach for the design of relatively broad-spectrum inhibitors against infection of MERS-CoV, of the family Coronaviridae, that primarily employs the cell surface pathway, 13, 35 and IAV, of the family Orthomyxoviridae, that uses the endocytic route, 6,7 based on replicating the topography of CHR helices by using de novo designed amphiphilic \u03b1-helical peptides with the addition of a fatty acid tail.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, coiled-coil domains share a characteristic heptad repeat, usually denoted as a-b-c-d-e-f-g, with hydrophobic residues at the core a-d positions and hydrophilic residues at the other sites. 20, 21 In the helix wheel model of the NHR/CHR 6HB structure, the residues at the ad-e sites on the C-helices face the inner N-helices and are largely buried; these residues are primarily responsible for CHR\u2212NHR interaction. Meanwhile, the residues at the b-c-f-g sites are located away from the interaction center. Therefore, we adopted the heptad repeat approach to design amphiphilic peptides based on the sequence Ac-(X a E b E c X d Z e K f K g ) 5 -\u03b2Ala-K(C16)-NH 2 . In the repeated heptapeptide sequence, we placed hydrophobic residues at the \"X\" positions and polar/ charged residues at the \"Z\" positions. With the foreground a-d and e positions of the model sequence set, the background b-c-fg sites were populated with combinations of glutamic acid and lysine to form double Glu-Lys intrastrand salt bridges at the i \n\nArticle to i + 4 positions to favor the overall \u03b1-helicity and solubility of the heptad repeat peptides. Seminal work investigating the structural characterization of coiled coils suggests that the stability of helical bundles is directly proportional to the number of heptad repeats. Combined with the optimal peptide length paradigm established by current peptidic fusion inhibitors, the designed sequence was made with five heptads, i.e., 35 residues, and an \u03b2-alanine (\u03b2Ala) was additionally appended outside of the heptad repeat region in order to link an extra lysine residue, 36, 37 which was capped by a palmitoyl group (C16), thus providing its membrane-tropic feature and favorable safety profile for drug development ( Figure 1C ).\n\nInitially, we aimed to establish combinations of foreground a-d residues in the heptad repeat moiety. As previous experiments have indicated that alanine residues are strongly biased toward helix formation in peptides, 38 the design of the novel lipopeptide began with the peptide named AAS (Table 1 ), in which hydrophobic alanine residues were placed at the a and d positions of the heptad, and a small helix-favoring polar residue, i.e., serine, which has been widely utilized in protein functional scanning strategies, 39 was populated at the e positions. To explore the influence of hydrophobic residue contact at \u03b1-helix-mediated coiled-coil interaction sites on antiviral activity, substitutions at the a-d positions of the peptide AAS were made with different hydrophobic residues, including Val, Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Ile. We used our previously developed MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell\u2212cell fusion assay to test the biological activity of these peptides. 40 As shown in Table 1 , all of the lipopeptides potently inhibited cell\u2212cell fusion mediated by MERS-CoV S protein, with 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) values ranging from 0.1 to >10.0 \u03bcM. Of the six lipopeptides we designed, both LLS and IIS were found to be potent MERS-CoV fusion inhibitors, with EC 50 values of 0.24 and 0.10 \u03bcM, respectively. The possible reasons for this activity include the evolutionary preference for Leu and Ile in the heptad positions a-d for viral fusion glycoprotein sequences and the significance of creating enough hydrophobicity/amphiphilicity to yield a stable coiled-coil structure. 41 Compared to LLS, IIS possessed obviously lower cytotoxicity in Huh-7 cells, which were used as target cells in the cell\u2212cell fusion assay. Therefore, in the next round of analogues, we further mutated residues at the e position of the heptad of IIS with different types of polar residues, including cationic Lys, anionic Glu, and uncharged Gln, as well as aromatic/heterocyclic amino acids such as Tyr, Trp, and His, expecting that these optimizations would provide further improvement in potency and cytotoxicity. Strikingly, Glncontaining IIQ and Tyr-containing IIY had EC 50 values of 0.11 and 0.52 \u03bcM, respectively, even reaching the potencies of the MERS-CoV-specific fusion inhibitor HR2PM2 peptide. 42 In addition, both IIQ and IIY possessed lower cytotoxicity values than the selected lead IIS, with a 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC 50 ) value of >100 \u03bcM. Subsequently, we tested the inhibitory activity of the peptide IIQ on the entry of pseudovirus carrying the wild-type MERS-CoV S protein. As shown in Supporting Information, Figure S1 , IIQ was effective against MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection, with an EC 50 value of 0.13 \u03bcM; this finding was in close agreement with the cell\u2212 cell fusion assay results. These data imply that the de novo designed peptides that are nonhomologous with the naturally occurring MERS-CoV S protein sequence could effectively inhibit MERS-CoV infection by targeting virus\u2212host cell membrane fusion. Moreover, we explored the structural properties of these lipopeptides by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to determine if their propensities to adopt \u03b1helical structure were correlated with anti-MERS-CoV activity. The relationships between the EC 50 s of lipopeptides and their \u03b1-helical content are shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. We found that the potency was not strictly dependent on their \u03b1-helicity (r 2 = 0.2439), suggesting that other factors, such as solubility and target binding affinity and kinetics, may be involved in their biological activity. This phenomena has also been observed in the studies on HIV-1 fusion inhibitors, where several C-peptides exhibited no anti-HIV-1 potency despite they have fully \u03b1-helical structure in solution. 29, 43 The number of 293T/MERS/EGFP cells fused or unfused with Huh-7 cells were countered, and the percentage of inhibition was calculated as described in the experimental section. Data were derived from the results of three independent experiments and are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. b These peptides have an acetyl group at the N-terminus and carboxyamide at the C-terminus. The letters a-g indicate the positions of the corresponding residues in a helical wheel presentation. \u03b2A, \u03b2-alanine. c Cytotoxicity to Huh-7 cells.\n\nThe ongoing threat of the emergence of resistant variants that diminish or ablate the effectiveness of the currently available anti-IAV drugs underscores the demand for new antiviral strategies targeting other proteins in the influenza virus life cycle. 44 Therefore, we employed a cytopathic effect inhibition assay to evaluate the inhibition effect of compounds IIS, IIY, and IIQ, which exhibited promising potency in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection, against IAVs. Surprisingly, one of the lipopeptides, IIQ, displayed potent inhibitory activity toward both strains A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2), with EC 50 values of 1.73 and 0.70 \u03bcM, respectively (Table 2) . Furthermore, none of these peptides displayed a cytotoxic effect against Madin\u2212Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. The selective index of IIQ was larger than 143, indicating a safe profile for further exploration. The data presented in Table S1 in the Supporting Information show that IIQ was also potent against oseltamivir-resistant strains, including LN/1109 (H1N1) and TJ/15 (H1N1), with EC 50 values of 4.36 and 3.03 \u03bcM, respectively, whereas oseltamivir was much less effective (EC 50 = 21.7 \u03bcM) against LN/1109 (H1N1) and inactive against TJ/15 (H1N1) at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. In addition, IIQ also exerted remarkable inhibitory activity against B/Lee/40 strain infection with an EC 50 value of 1.87 \u00b1 0.95 \u03bcM. As expected, MERS-CoV HR2PM2 displayed no inhibition effect against A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) and A/ Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) infection at the concentration up to 20 \u03bcM. The life cycle of influenza virus is divided into three steps, i.e., virus entry, viral genome replication, and progeny virion release. 45 Currently, several anti-influenza drugs have been developed for interruption of specific processes in influenza infection. Among them, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) targets neuraminidase (NA) protein, thus preventing release of tethered progeny virus from its host cells. 46 Favipiravir that selectively inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been approved in Japan as an inhibitor of influenza virus replication for the treatment of influenza virus infection in 2014. 47 We then asked if the IIQ peptide acts by inhibiting the entry step of IAV into host cells. To address this question, a viral replicon assay and a neuraminidase inhibition assay were performed to \n\nArticle rule out any effect of IIQ on viral replication and progeny virion release, respectively. In the mini-replicon system, viral RNA polymerase protein expression plasmids mediate the expression of a reporter genome encoding firefly luciferase. Through determination of the normalized firefly luminescence/Renilla luminescence ratio, we found that favipiravir could inhibit influenza replicon activity in a dose-dependent manner, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value of 26.2 \u00b1 3.7 \u03bcM, whereas IIQ and the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir exhibited no significant inhibition at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM ( Figure 2A ). As shown in Figure 2B ,C, neither IIQ nor favipiravir was able to disturb cleavage of the substrate by neuraminidase from the two IAV strains A/Puerto Rico/8/ 34 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2) in the test range. In contrast, oseltamivir could inhibit neuraminidase of these two viruses, with IC 50 values of 1.71 \u00b1 0.2 and 0.51 \u00b1 0.01 nM, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest IIQ may affect the entry stage of viral life cycle to block virus infection. Moreover, using a time-of-addition assay, we found that the viral load at intervals of 0\u221210 h (covering the whole life cycle) and 0\u22122 h (covering the entry step) was reduced by approximately 60%, with the addition of 10 \u03bcM IIQ, as compared with the PBS control, and no antiviral activity was observed for the remaining three time intervals (2\u22125, 5\u22128, and 8\u221210 h). However, favipiravir continued to exert its full effect, even at the interval of 5\u22128 h. These results further confirmed that IIQ targets the entry step in the IAV life cycle ( Figure  2D \u2212F). Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay is wellestablished to determine whether the sialic acid-binding site on HA1 subunit acts as potential drug target; meanwhile, hemolysis inhibition assay is commonly used to determine whether the HA2 subunit can be a possible target. 48 Thus, an HI assay was first performed to determine the potential effect of IIQ peptide on the HA1 subunit sialic acid-binding site. The result showed that no apparent inhibition of influenza virusinduced aggregation of chicken erythrocytes was observed in the test range, indicating IIQ has no effect on the interaction of HA1 subunit with its sialic acid receptor (Supporting Information, Figure S3A ). Moreover, the hemolysis inhibition assay showed that the lysis of erythrocytes caused by the conformational rearrangements of HA2 subunit under acidic condition was decreased compared with the hemolytic effect of virus only (Supporting Information, Figure S3B ). The combined results indicate that IIQ may bind to the HA2 subunit to interrupt the conformational changes in HA2 rather \n\nArticle than interacting with HA1 subunit via inhibiting the absorption of viruses into host cells, consistent with our design rationale. After identifying that the entry/fusion process phase of the life cycle of MERS-CoV and IAV was the point of interference, we explored whether the IIQ peptide would interact with the corresponding NHR region of viral fusion proteins with a mechanism of action similar to virus-specific C-peptides. The first piece of evidence came from native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (N-PAGE) of equimolar mixtures of IIQ plus synthetic peptides containing the NHR segments of the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein S2 subunit, designated as HR1P, 13 and the postfusion structure of the H3N2 hemagglutinin (HA) HA2 subunit, namely N66, 49 respectively. The mixtures of IIQ/HR1P and IIQ/N66 showed new bands at the upper positions in the gel, demonstrating that tightly associated complexes were formed ( Figure 3A ). These findings are consistent with the results obtained from circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, in which the signal of these mixtures was dramatically greater than that of the mathematical sum of the corresponding isolated peptides, suggesting induction of a large \u03b1-helical structure resulting from their interaction ( Figure  3B ,C). 50 Moreover, data from CD analysis indicated that the IIQ/HR1P and IIQ/N66 helical bundles showed strong thermal stability, with melting temperature values of >90 and 83.1\u00b0C, respectively ( Figure 3D and Supporting Information, Table S2 ). In CD analysis, N36/C34 6HB, 31 which has an available crystal structure and is widely used to represent the HIV-1 fusion core, was used as a positive control (Supporting Information, Figure S4 ). Finally, sedimentation velocity analysis demonstrated the heterogeneous 6HB states of the IIQ/HR1P complex and the IIQ/N66 complex (Supporting Information, Table S3 and Figure S5 ). Together, these data suggest that the active IIQ peptide does indeed associate with a site in the NHR region and forms heterogeneous 6HB structures that interfere with the fusion between virus and target cell membrane.\n\nWe used the palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospholcholine large unilamellar vesicle (POPC LUV) liposome system to examine the ability of IIQ to interact with a lipid bilayer by measuring the heat generated during the peptide\u2212lipid binding in an isothermal titration calorimetry assay. 51 As shown in Figure 4 , a huge amount of released heat was observed after the titration of POPC LUVs into solutions containing IIQ peptide, with a binding constant of 1.04 \u00d7 10 5 M \u22121 . In comparison, the unconjugated peptide IIQ\u0394, which exhibited no significant inhibitory activity at the concentration up to 40 \u03bcM on both MERS-CoV pseudovirus and A/Puerto Rico/8/ 34 (H1N1) infection, did not show lipid vesicle binding. These observations indicate that IIQ can bind to a lipid bilayer. Although HIV-1-neutralizing CHR peptides provide a classic paradigm for the rational design of fusion inhibitors that interfere with the interaction between the heptad-repeat regions of class I viral fusion proteins, the development of such drugs with novel modes of action against IAV remains a challenge, mainly by the inaccessibility of exogenously added C-peptides to the endocytic compartment, where fusogenic 6HB formation takes place. Thus, we next appended the fluorescent probe nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) to the Nterminus of IIQ via a \u03b2-alanine spacer to generate IIQ NBD and monitored its cellular uptake. IIQ NBD was found to be similar to IIQ in terms of its \u03b1-helicity and inhibitory potency against IAV infection, indicating that the addition of the fluorophore did not dramatically affect the biophysical/ biological properties of IIQ (Supporting Information, Table  S4 ). To demonstrate cellular uptake, MDCK cells treated with IIQ NBD were observed after incubation for 0.5, 1, and 4 h by confocal microscopy. The lysotracker probe specifically fluoresces in acidic vesicles. 52 As shown in Figure 5 , MDCK cells exposed to IIQ NBD for 0.5 h showed that the lipopeptides were distributed on the periphery of the cell membrane. After 1 h, the accumulation of IIQ NBD within the MDCK cells was detected in the acidic intracellular compartments, colocalized \n\nArticle with LysoTracker Red. Moreover, after 4 h, an increasing amount of IIQ NBD was internalized and colocalized extensively with LysoTracker Red. Taken together, these results suggest that the \u03b1-helical lipopeptide could cross the plasma membrane efficiently via endocytosis and trap IAV fusion proteins in their prehairpin intermediate state, thereby blocking membrane fusion.\n\nSubsequently, IIQ peptide was assessed for essential druglike properties, including water solubility and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties. IIQ showed solubility value of 8.87 \u00b1 0.4 mg/ mL in pure water. The pharmacokinetic behavior of IIQ was evaluated in rats ( Figure 6 and Table 3 ). Sprague\u2212Dawley rats were injected intravenously with 5 mg/kg of IIQ peptide, and blood was withdrawn after 2 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h 12 h, and 24 h, respectively (three animals at each time point). The LC/MS/MS method showed satisfactory results for the determination of IIQ in rat plasma and was used for the pharmacokinetic study. Inspection of the plasma concentration\u2212time profile for IIQ revealed that the mean value of the maximum plasma concentration (C max ) obtained 2 min after dosing was 97.6 \u03bcg/mL and the area under the plasma concentration\u2212time curve extrapolated to the last time point (AUC 0\u2212t ) was 234.7 (\u03bcg/mL)\u00b7h. The elimination kinetics of IIQ demonstrated durable plasma half-life of 6.6 h, and the concentration of IIQ in plasma remained well above the 0.1 \u03bcg/mL limit of quantitation of the analytical method at 24 h. Furthermore, IIQ peptide has a low rate of clearance of 20.7 mL\u00b7h \u22121 \u00b7kg \u22121 . Together, the favorable pharmacokinetic of IIQ, including the efficacious exposure level, the low clearance, and the relatively extended half-life in vivo, suggest IIQ is suitable for further study as a drug candidate.\n\nTo investigate whether our engineered lipopeptides exert broad antiviral spectrum beyond Coronaviridae and Orthomyxoviridae families, IIQ peptide was further evaluated against HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env)-mediated cell\u2212cell fusion and Ebola virus (EboV) envelope glycoprotein (GP)-mediated cell entry. We found that IIQ inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion with an EC 50 of 3.63 \u00b1 0.54 \u03bcM and exhibited low cytotoxicity, with CC 50 > 100 \u03bcM, on the TZM-b1 cell that was used for the fusion assay. Encouragingly, IIQ also inhibited the entry of pseudovirus carrying the GP of the EboV Sudan species, with EC 50 value of 1.02 \u00b1 0.54 \u03bcM. To our knowledge, the formation of a hexameric coiled-coil complex is believed to be a common element in type I fusion events. However, the fusion rates vary significantly between viruses from different families, between viruses within a family, and even between isolates of the same species, thus leading to the different window periods during which inhibitory peptides access to the target fusion protein and thereby impacting entry inhibitor efficacy. 5 Furthermore, the stability of the corresponding fusogenic 6HB of different type I viral fusion proteins was also correlated with the inhibitory potency of peptides. 7 Therefore, the engineered lipopeptides with simple repeating units of the heptad in our study could not be effective against all of the class I viruses entry, but first provide a proof-of-concept prototype for broad-spectrum antiviral agents design. Moreover, these lipopeptides may also be used as lead compounds for further optimization to design inhibitors with a broader antiviral spectrum.\n\nOn the basis of common features of the fusogenic 6HB structure formed between the CHR and NHR regions of the class I viral fusion glycoproteins, we report an effective strategy to expedite the development of relatively broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Our study reveals that the de novo designed \u03b1helical lipopeptides, which are nonhomologous with naturally occurring protein sequences, can interact with both MERS-CoV and IAV NHR trimeric coiled coils to prevent virus\u2212cell membrane fusion. One of the designed peptides showed a high potency against MERS-CoV infection and effectively neutralized H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (influenza A group 1), H3N2 \n\nArticle A/Hong Kong/8/68 (influenza A group 2), and even the influenza B virus (B/Lee/40). The relatively broad-spectrum antiviral peptides were designed based on the secondary structure at the hexameric coiled-coil complex interface. We anticipate that this approach could also be extended to other pathogenic viruses with class I fusion proteins because they undergo fusion catalysis in a manner similar to that of MERS-CoV and IAVs. to the reactor; the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 60 min. After completion of the coupling reaction or Fmoc removal, the resin was washed with DMF (5 \u00d7 1 min) and DCM (3 \u00d7 1 min). For lipopeptides, the template peptides containing a Dde-protected lysine residue at their C-terminus required a special deprotection step (four 3 min washes of 2% hydrazinehydrate in DMF). This enabled the conjugation of a palmityl moiety, which was performed by the addition of 3 equiv of palmic acid, 3 equiv of HBTU, and 6 equiv of DIEA in DMF to the resin, followed by stirring for 2 h. Conjugation of a fluoride [4-fluoro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBD)] fluorescent probe to the N-terminus of the peptide was performed by the addition of 6 equiv of NBD-Cl dissolved in DMF together with 6 equiv of DIEA to the peptide resin, followed by stirring for 12 h. The peptides were cleaved from the resin and deprotected with reagent K, which contained 85% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% thioanisole, 5% m-cresol, and 5% water. The carboxyl termini were amidated upon cleavage from the resin, and the amino termini were capped with acetic acid anhydride, except NBD-conjugated peptides. All lyophilized crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase highperformance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC; Shimadzu preparative HPLC system), and the purity of each peptide was confirmed to be \u226595% by analytical RP-HPLC (Shimadzu analytical HPLC system). Such information is provided in the Supporting Information (Table S5\u2212 Inhibition of Pseudotyped MERS-CoV Infection. Inhibition of MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection was assessed using a previously described method. 42 Briefly, the serially diluted tested peptides were added to a 96-well plate and incubated with MERS-CoV pseudovirus for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Then, the pseudovirus/peptide mixture was added to the Huh-7 cells. Cultures were refed with fresh medium at 12 h postinfection and incubated for an additional 48 h at 37\u00b0C. Fluorescence was determined using a luciferase kit (Promega) and an Ultra 384 luminometer (Tecan).\n\nCytopathic Effect Reduction Assay. Madin\u2212Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (Nunc MicroWell) at a density of 1.5 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium/Ham's F-12 medium (DF-12) and were incubated overnight to adhere to the plate. 53 A 3-fold dilution series of tested compounds in DF-12 with tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin was added to cells infected with influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) or A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2) at a final multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.003 Pfu/cell suspended in DF-12 medium with TPCK-trypsin. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 72 h, the antiviral effect of the tested compounds was measured using a CellTiter-Glo cell viability assay (Promega, USA), as described by the manufacturer. The plates were read by a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, USA).\n\nCytotoxicity Assays. Cytotoxicity of Compounds on Huh-7 Cells. Briefly, 100 \u03bcL of a Huh-7 cell suspension (1 \u00d7 10 5 cells/mL) were added to each well of a 96-well culture plate. The plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 for 12 h. Next, 5 \u03bcL of serially diluted peptide solution were added. At the same time, a blank control group without peptide and a positive control group with 5 \u03bcL of 10% Triton X-100 were cultured for 48 h under the conditions of 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C\n\n. To each well were added 10 \u03bcL of Cell Counting Kit 8 solution, and the plate was incubated for an additional 2 h. The absorbance at 450 nm was determined by a microplate reader.\n\nCytotoxicity of Compounds on MDCK Cells. MDCK cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1.5 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well in DF-12 medium and incubated overnight before a 3-fold dilution series of tested compounds in DF-12 medium with TPCK-trypsin was added to the cells. At 72 h after treatment, the cytotoxicity was measured by a CellTiter-Glo cell viability assay (Promega, USA). The 50% cytotoxicity concentration data were fit and determined by Origin 8 software.\n\nInfluenza Virus Replication Assay. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (Nunc MicroWell) at a density of 2.5 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well in DF-12 medium and were incubated overnight. The plasmid encoding the influenza replication complex component (NP, PB1, PB2, and PA) and that encoding the luciferase reporter (polI-NS-Luc and pRL SV40 ) were transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, USA). At 6 h post-transfection, serially diluted oseltamivir or favipiravir or IIQ was added at the indicated concentration. After 30 h, the luciferase activities were measured using a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, USA) and a Dual-Glo luciferase assay kit (Promega, USA), according to the standard protocol. The replicon activities were represented by the ratio of firefly luciferase activity relative to Renilla \n\nArticle luciferase activity. The replicon activity inhibition of the tested compounds was calculated using the following formula: Inhibition of replicon activity (%) = (experimental sample ratio \u2212 negative control ratio)/(positive control ratio \u2212 negative control ratio) \u00d7 100%. Curve fitting was performed by Origin 8.0 software. Neuraminidase Inhibition Assay. The NA-Star Influenza Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) was used to measure the inhibition of neuraminidase activity according to the manufacturer's instructions. Neuraminidase from influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2) and neuraminidase from influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus were used for this assay. The chemiluminescent signal intensity of the assay plate was measured immediately after accelerator injection, and the read time was set to 1 s. The inhibitory activity of oseltamivir or favipiravir or IIQ was calculated using the following formula: inhibitory activity , harvested, and then applied to qPCR for viral load analysis. Cells were continuously cultured in fresh medium after removal of test compounds at 37\u00b0C until 10 h postinfection, and then viral load was analyzed. Total RNA of the cell samples was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Absolute RT-qPCR was performed using the ABI Step One Plus platform by using a One-Step PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Takara). All samples were run in triplicate. The details of the primers, probe sequences, and reaction system can be found in the Supporting Information. The mRNA expression profiles at different time intervals of IIQ or favipiravir or PBS treatment were analyzed, and the mRNA expression profiles under IIQ or favipiravir treatment were presented relative to the PBS control. Statistical significance of the data was determined by MANOVA method using SPSS 20.0 software. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy. CD spectra were acquired on a MOS-450 system (BioLogic, Claix, France) with the following parameters: bandwidth, 4.0 nm; resolution, 0.1 nm; path length, 0.1 cm; response time, 4.0 s; and scanning speed, 50 nm/min. HR1P was incubated with IIQ at 25\u00b0C for 30 min in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). N66 was incubated with IIQ at 30\u00b0C for 30 min in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (containing 10 mM sodium phosphate and 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 5.0). All samples were prepared with the buffer solution at a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM and cooled to 25\u00b0C for measurement. The CD data were presented as the mean residue ellipticity. The \u03b1-helical content for these peptides was calculated by assuming that 100% helicity corresponds to \u221233000 degrees cm 2 dmol \u22121 . For the thermal unfolding experiments, the CD absorbance was monitored at 222 nm with the temperature for the peptide solutions ranging from 10 to 90\u00b0C at a scan speed of 2\u00b0C/min. Samples at pH 5.0 contained 10 \u03bcM peptide in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (containing 10 mM sodium phosphate and 150 mM sodium chloride). Samples at pH 7.4 contained 10 \u03bcM peptide in 10 mM phosphate buffer.\n\nNative Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis. An equimolar mixture of IIQ and HR1P in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 30 min (final concentration of each peptide: 150 \u03bcM). After the addition of 2\u00d7 \u03b2-alanine\u2212formic acid native sample buffer to samples at a ratio of 1:1, all samples were loaded on a 15% \u03b2-alanine\u2212formic acid gel with a \u03b2-alanine\u2212formic acid running buffer (pH 3.4). After sample loading, the samples were concentrated at a constant voltage of 90 V. When the samples reached the boundary of the two gels, the voltage was raised to 150 V, and the samples were electrophoresed for 2.5 h until the indicator was within 1\u22122 cm of the leading edge. The gel was subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue R250. An equimolar mixture of IIQ and N66 in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (containing 10 mM sodium phosphate and 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 5.0) was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 30 min (final concentration of each peptide: 150 \u03bcM). After incubation, the solutions were equilibrated at room temperature, and the pH was neutralized by the addition of 200 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.5). After the addition of 2\u00d7 Tris-glycine native sample buffer (Invitrogen, USA) to the samples at a ratio of 1:1, all samples were loaded onto a 15% Trisglycine gel with Tris\u2212glycine running buffer (pH 8.8). After sample loading, the samples were concentrated at a constant voltage of 90 V. When the samples reached the boundary of the two gels, the voltage was raised to 150 V and the samples were electrophoresed for 2.5 h until the indicator was within 1\u22122 cm of the leading edge. The gel was subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue R250.\n\nSedimentation Velocity Analysis (SVA). A Beckman XL-A-type ultracentrifuge was used for the SVA experiments. HR1P was incubated with IIQ at 25\u00b0C for 30 min in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). N66 was incubated with IIQ at 30\u00b0C for 30 min in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (containing 10 mM phosphate and 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 5.0). All samples were prepared at a final concentration of 150 \u03bcM, which was measured by a UV absorption experiment. Data were collected at 280 nm at a rotor speed of 3000 rpm initially and then 60000 rpm in continuous mode at 25\u00b0C. The sedimentation coefficient distribution, c(s), was measured, and the molecular weight distribution was calculated by SEDFIT software.\n\nIsothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). ITC was performed to detect the IIQ and lipid-binding activity, as described previously. 51 The solutions were degassed under vacuum prior to use. To detect the IIQ and lipid-binding activity, large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) liposomes were used. LUVs of POPC (13 mM) were injected into the cell containing peptide solution (15 \u03bcM, 300 \u03bcL) . The experiments used a MicroCal ITC200 system (GE, Alpharetta, GA USA) for titration, with the following experimental parameters: total injection, 20 drops; drop volume, 2 \u03bcL; syringe concentration, 13 mM; cell concentration, 15 \u03bcM; cell temperature, 25\u00b0C; energy reference, 3 \u03bcCal/s; titration delay, 60 s; stirring speed, 750 rpm; drop volume, 2 \u03bcL; titration time, 4 s; two-drop interval, 120 s; data collection interval, 5 s. Data acquisition and analyses were performed using Origin software (Version 8.5, MicroCal).\n\nImmunofluorescence Assay. MDCK cells were pretreated with LysoTracker Red DND-99 (L7528), which was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Shanghai, China). LysoTracker solution (1 \u03bcL, 1 mM) was added to 10 mL of growth medium to obtain a working solution of 100 nM. Cells in a 96-well plate were incubated with 50 \u03bcL of 100 nM LysoTracker working solution for 1.5 h, and then they were washed twice with PBS. DF-12 medium without phenol red containing 5 \u03bcM IIQ NBD was added to the cells (time point of 0 h), and then the cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO 2 . At time points of 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h, the cells were scanned with the Operetta confocal imaging system (provided by PerkinElmer) with a 20\u00d7 objective lens. The following filters were used: Alexa Fluor 548 for acidic intracellular compartments and FITC for IIQ NBD .\n\nPharmacokinetic Assessments. Sprague\u2212Dawley rats weighing 210 \u00b1 10 g each were obtained from the Animal Center of Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology and were used for pharmacokinetic assessments. Animals were treated in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" (NIH Publication 86-23, revised 1985).
