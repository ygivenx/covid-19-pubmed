However, the recent circulation of influenza A (H1N1) virus has been associated with severe disease and with excess pneumonia. 3 Data from Australia's winter revealed a hospitalization rate of 23 per 100,000 population with 13 % of ICU admission. 4 The Canadian prospective study of critically ill patients with 2009 infl uenza (H1N1) infection revealed that major co-morbidities were present in only 30,4 % of patients and was associated with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. 5 Recent series from the US and Australia including critically ill patients with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection describe development of ARDS in 35.8 % and 48.8 % of cases and a 45 % and 14.3 % hospital mortality, respectively. 6, 7 Exacerbation of chronic diseases (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease-COPD-and chronic heart failure) occurs in 14.9 % of patients with H1N1 admitted to ICU in Utah 8 and exacerbation of airfl ow limitation in 13.9 % of patients admitted to ICU in Australia and New Zealand. 7\n\nSince its initial reports in the late 1980s NIV has become a first-line intervention for different causes of acute respiratory failure (ARF). 9 It reduces intubation rate and mortality in ARF due to exacerbations of COPD 10 and acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. 11 However, data from surveys across the world suggests that NIV is still underused in some centres. 12 The role of NIV for hypoxemic respiratory failure is more controversial. However, it has been demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial that, with similar settings, NIV is equivalent to conventional ventilation in improving gas exchange with lower incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia. 13 According to a a large multicentric study, only 31 % of ARDS patients are eligible for NIV, but this intervention avoided intubation in around 50 % of cases; 14 those with Simplified Acute Physiology Score \u2264 34 and PaO 2 /FIO 2 > 175 after one hour were more likely to benefi t from NIV.\n\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), due to a novel coronavirus, emerged in 2002, with signifi cant morbidity and mortality. Critically ill patients with SARS presented with Acute Lung Injury/ARDS in 82 % of cases, with mortality at 28 days of 45 %. 15 Those patients were at high risk of infecting health care workers (HCW), especially due to high-risk procedures coinciding with viral shedding peak. 16 Avoidance of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and other aerosol-generating procedures were recommended in Canadian guidelines to minimise the occupational risk and nosocomial transmission. 17 However, this was due to a non-signifi cant increased risk from a retrospective ICU cohort analysis and others recommended NIV for respiratory distress and refractory hypoxemia in newly designed SARS wards. 18 In fact, NIV has been reported to be effective in SARS-related Acute Respiratory Failure without posing infection risks to HCW. 19 Yam LYC et al suggest that compared to invasive ventilation, NIV for ARF in SARS was associated with reduced mortality without any NIV-related SARS transmission within the 21 patients treated. 19 Moreover Cheung et al 20 in a retrospective analysis of 20 patients state that NIV (also performed in negative pressure rooms) avoided intubation in 70 % of cases and none of the 105 HCW caring for the patients acquired SARS. Another series in China reported the experience with NIV in 28 patients with SARS showing physiologic improvement and avoiding intubation in 67 % and none of the HCW contracted SARS. 21 In the US another report confi rms the lack of SARS transmission among 110 HCW with exposure to 6 SARS patients. 22\n\nRecently there has been some debate in literature about the use of NIV in the context of H1N1. 23 Should it be considered a high-risk procedure? Is it an effective ventilatory support in this scenario?\n\nThe concern of infectious droplet dispersion has been addressed by experimental models showing that exposure can occur within one metre of patients receiving Non-invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation. 24 However, it is questionable that a mannequin can confidently simulate NIV in real patients. Moreover wearing a face mask for NIV can protect against particle generation during coughing and sneezing.\n\nDue to the effi cacy previously described in SARS, NIV can be an attractive option especially in a pandemic scenario when the demand for critical care may be massive. 25\n\nAmong the recently published major series of critically ill patients with novel infl uenza A (H1N1) virus infection, [5] [6] [7] [8] [26] [27] [28] NIV has been reported in four of them, 5,26-28 including 129 patients with a success ranging from 5 % to 100 % (table 1). Two smaller series 8, 29 (in which NIV was tried in 21 patients) (table 2) and six case series (including 10 patients) [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] describe success in 6 cases (20 %).\n\nThe majority were patients with severe ARDS in whom ventilatory support ranged from CPAP 33 to bi-level ventilation. 30 No mention of ventilatory parameters [27] [28] [29] 31, 32 precludes some critical review of the negative results, but in the Spanish series Rello et al. 29 suggest that the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was higher in NIV failure. Moreover Estenssoro et al. 27 suggest that patients that used NIV were associated with a better outcome.\n\nThe impact of H1N1 infection on the southern hemisphere provided important lessons in critical care demand, revealing that in the epidemic peak in Australia and New Zealand the percentage of beds occupied by patients with H1N1 reached up to a maximum of 19 %. 7 In case ICU facilities cannot be expanded, NIV can be delivered in respiratory intermediate care units (RICU), offloading ICU beds. In fact during the H1N1 outbreak 4 Mexican patients died while awaiting ICU beds. 26 From that previously described, approximately one-third of critically ill patients may be eligible for NIV. Moving from ventilatory support in the ICU to NIV in RICU may be crucial during H1N1 pandemic!\n\nNosocomial non-pandemic infl uenza outbreaks are usually underdetected and underreported but their consequences for hospitals in terms of morbidity and costs are considerable. 36 Soon after the identifi cation of novel infl uenza A (H1N1) virus infections in the US, 26 cases of infected HCW were reported by the CDC, 50 % of which were deemed to have acquired it in the health-care setting. 37 Although no mention of aerosol-generating procedures that put HCW at risk is made, the report highlighted the need to implement infection-control strategies to prevent transmission of novel H1N1 in hospitals. Of the 13 HCWs who were infected, only three had consistently used personal protective equipment. 37 Concerning the case of HCW transmission, in the recent series of critically ill H1N1 patients this has been stated only in 4, 3, 5, 26, 29 ranging from zero in the Canadian series 5 to 12 % in the Mexican study. 3 To be highlighted is the fact that in the latter report the authors verifi ed that no HCW were hospitalized after strict infection control measures were undertaken. 3 Since NIV is suggested as a risk factor for infection in hospital workers in these papers, although in some of the series there is omission of this information, it seems that the risk may not be so signifi cant after all!\n\nRecently the European Respiratory Society and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine released some guidelines on the use and limitations of NIV in patients with confi rmed H1N1 infection. 38 They suggest that NIV may be considered only in patients with mild to moderate hypercapnic acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory failure and/or distress due to cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, in the absence of pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and refractory hypoxemia.\n\nThe Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases (ASID) in a recent position statement also recommends that patients who require non-invasive ventilation should have priority for negative-pressure rooms if available. 39 This has also been suggested by the UK Department of Health, which recommends use of a non-vented mask or helmet for NIV, a high-effi ciency bacterial/viral fi lter between the non-vented mask and the expiratory port and at the outlet of the ventilator. 40 In another NHS document developed in conjunction with the British Thoracic Society and the Intensive Care Society it is advised that NIV should be provided with strict safety measure for the HCW and by experienced teams. 41 It is proposed that NIV can have a role in influenza-related pneumonia as an early intervention, particularly in those with co-morbidities such as COPD.\n\nMoreover it can constitute ceiling to ventilator care in patients with COPD or heart failure with DNI orders. From the previous discussion and current literature it is clear that if certain recommendations are followed NIV can be effective and safe in the context of H1N1 infection. Hence, we propose that we should give NIV a chance and suggest the management principles depicted in the table 3.\n\nWhile the pandemic is still evolving across the globe we are deeply convinced that non-invasive ventilation can have a role in treating acute respiratory failure patients, reducing the need of ICU beds and improving outcomes.\n\nAlthough there are some authors that reject NIV in infectious patients 43 the experience from recent series suggests that clinicians are using it even in countries where guidelines suggest its avoidance. 5 It is reasonable to recommend NIV in Chronic Heart Failure 35 and COPD with exacerbations attributable to H1N1, given the strong evidence of NIV in non-H1N1 patients with similar diseases. 10, 11 For those patients with H1N1 associated ARDS a thorough selection is needed, although some may respond to NIV. 30 In this context NIV should be applied with specifi c resources by experienced teams.\n\nTo strengthen the position on non-invasive ventilation in the ongoing H1N1 pandemic infl uenza we encourage all clinicians to report their experience with this technique in this setting. Active surveillance of nosocomial infections is also highly recommended.\n\nEarly diagnosis and therapeutic interventions for severe H1N1 pandemic infl uenza should also be emphasized.\n\nAuthors declare they don't have any confl ict of interest.
