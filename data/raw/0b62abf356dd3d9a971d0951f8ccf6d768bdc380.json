{"title": "Identification of the hyper-variable genomic hotspot for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2", "body": "A recent study in this journal studied the genomes of the novel SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in China and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 had undergone genetic recombination with SARS-related CoV [1] . By February 14, 2020, a total of 66,576 2 confirmed cases of COVID-19, people infected with SARS-CoV-2, were reported in China, leading to 1,524 deaths, per the Chinese CDC (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/). Several full genomic sequences of this virus have been released for the study of its evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics [2] [3] [4] . Here, we analyzed the potential mutations that may have evolved after the virus became epidemic among humans and also the mutations resulting in the human adaptation. We compared these results with those of the work of Ceraolo and Giorgi [8] , who reported at least two hyper-variable genomic hotspots based on the Shannon entropy of nucleotide sequences. They utilized all of the sequences, while we merged all of the fully identical sequences into one during our Shannon entropy calculation. As shown in Figure   1B , 28 sequences were merged into one in present study because they had been collected 4 in such a short time, so collection time and location could not have produced any large bias. If those identical sequences were calculated individually, any mutations on these 28 sequences would have sharply increased Shannon entropy. The protein sequences were used to exclude any unimportant silent mutations. Finally, the sequences of earliest SARS-CoV-2 were compared with RaTG13 from bats ( Figure 1D ). Fisher's exact test with post hoc test suggested that nsp1, nsp3, and nsp15 of ORF1ab and gene S had significantly more mutations than other genes, which might facilitate human adaptation and infection.\n\nS gene encodes spike glycoprotein, which binds host ACE2 receptors and is required for initiation of the infection [9] . They reported that a 193-amino acid fragment was able to bind ACE2 more efficiently than its unmutated counterpart. This region in which spike glycoprotein binds to ACE2 had 21 mutations not found in RaTG13, suggesting their role in the adaptation to human hosts. Peptide nsp1 facilitated viral gene expression and evasion from the host immune response [10] . Peptide nsp3, named papain-like proteinase, was found to be associated with the cleavages, viral replication, and antagonization of innate immune. These two peptides are probably associated with the latent period after infection in humans. Peptide nsp15 acted as uridylate-specific endoribonuclease. These results collectively suggest that peptides nsp1, nsp3, and nsp15 might have unclear but critical roles in this outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nTo summarize, this study confirmed the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 with other beta coronaviruses on the amino acid level. The hyper-variable genomic hotspot has been established in the SARS-CoV-2 population at the nucleotide but not the amino acid level, suggesting that there have been no beneficial mutations. The mutations in nsp1, nsp3, nsp15, and gene S that identified in this study would be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and was worthy of further study. The graphs show all of the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and its close relative strains isolated from bats."}
