{"title": "Protocol for Recombinant RBD-based SARS Vaccines: Protein Preparation, Animal Vaccination and Neutralization Detection", "body": "1. Prepare calcium phosphate transfection reagent 1. 2X HBS buffer preparation: Mix together 16 g of NaCl, 0.4 g of Na2HPO4*7H2O, and 13.0 g of HEPES. Adjust pH to 7.00 and bring up total volume to 1000 mL in distilled water. After filtering the solution for sterilization, aliquot and store it at -20\u00b0C. Hint: Any variation of the pH value would affect the transfection results. Thus, it is advisable to test several pH values around 7.00 (for example, 6.99, 7.00, or 7.01) and find the best one for the transfection using the method introduced below. 2. 2.5 M CaCl2 preparation: Add 73.5 g of CaCl2*2H2O to distilled water in a final volume of 200 mL. Filter the solution and store at -20\u00b0C.\n\n1. Split 293T cells at 50-70% confluency 24 h before transfection. Grow cells in T-175 cm 2 tissue culture flasks in 40 mL DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated (HI) FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. 2. All transfection reagents should be brought up to room temperature before transfection. These reagents include 2X HBS, 2.5M CaCl2, DiH2O, and rRBD plasmid 6 . Hint: The final recombinant plasmid construct used for protein expression should contain a signal peptide to ensure secretion of expressed recombinant proteins to the culture supernatant. A 6x His tag may be added to the C-terminal of the expressed protein for easy purification. 3. Prepare one 50 mL (A) and one 15 mL (B) BD Falcon tube, and add reagents to the tubes as indicated in Table 1 The volumes listed in Table 1 are for one transfection unit. If more flasks or dishes are used for the transfection, adjust volumes accordingly. 4. Add the DNA-calcium solution in tube B into tube A in a dropwise manner, while maintaining constant and gentle mixing in a vortex. Let the mixture sit at room temperature for 20-30 min. The key for successful calcium phosphate transfection depends on the size and shape of the precipitate formed. Thus, the mixture should be vortexed constantly and slowly to meet this requirement and, as a result, improve transfection efficacy. 5. Add mixture in a dropwise and even manner into 293T cells (4000 \u03bcL/flask). Culture cells in incubator at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. 6. Replace the culture medium with fresh serum-free OPTI-MEM I Reduced-Serum Medium (50 mL/flask) 8-10 h post-transfection.\n\nContinue to culture cells for two more days in the same condition. 7. Collect supernatant containing expressed rRBD protein 72 h post-transfection. Centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris.\n\nAdd protease inhibitor cocktail to the collected supernatant and store at 4\u00b0C overnight. 8. On the next day, purify rRBD recombinant protein from the culture supernatant using Ni-NTA Superflow following manufacturer's instructions. 9. Concentrate purified protein using Amicon Ultra -15 concentration tubes. After protein concentration, add PBS to the concentration tubes and centrifuge again to remove imidazole in elution buffer. Calculate protein concentration and store purified protein at -80\u00b0C until use.\n\n1. Pre-warm Sigma adjuvant system (SAS) to 40-45\u00b0C according to manufacturer's instructions. Add 1 mL PBS per vial and mix thoroughly. 2. Prepare protein-adjuvant emulsion according to the protocol in Table 2 . Pipette calculated rRBD protein into a 1.5 mL tube. Add equal volume of SAS adjuvant to the tube and vortex vigorously for 2-3 min to form emulsion. Hint: The volumes listed in Table 2 Table 2 . Mouse immunization protocol 3. Subcutaneously prime-immunize female BALB/c mice (4-6 weeks old, 5 mice/group), and boost twice with rRBD and SAS as indicated in Table 2 . Use PBS group as the control. The site for subcutaneous injections usually chosen is the loose skin between the shoulder blades. Alternatively, the ventral abdomen is commonly used, because it is easier to inject, and may observe any leakage from the injection sites. When repeated doses of vaccines are used, it is easy to select various injection sites, preventing potential local skin reactions. 4. Bleed mice via retro-orbital with anesthetic before immunization and 10 days after each vaccination, and heat sera at 56\u00b0C for 30 min to inactivate complement. Store mouse sera at -20\u00b0C until use."}
