{"title": "Flunarizine Prevents Hepatitis C Virus Membrane Fusion in a Genotype-dependent Manner by Targeting the Potential Fusion Peptide within E1 HHS Public Access", "body": "HCV is a liver-tropic, enveloped virus of the family Flaviviridae. It possesses a plusstranded RNA genome of 9.6 kb which encodes a single polyprotein. Proteolytic processing mediated by cellular and two viral proteases (NS2-3 and NS3-4A) liberates ten distinct HCV polypeptides (1) . The structural proteins core, E1 and E2 compose the virion with core encasing the viral RNA and the glycoproteins E1-E2 mediating receptor interactions and low pH triggered membrane fusion. The p7 ion channel is essential for virus assembly and protection of E1-E2 during virus release. The NS3, 4A, 4B, 5A and 5B assemble into a multi-protein complex critical for viral RNA replication. HCV is highly variable and viral strains are classified into seven distinct genotypes (GTs), 67 confirmed and 21 unassigned subtypes (2) .\n\nChronic HCV infection frequently leads to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and it has become the leading indication for liver transplantation (3) . Novel drugs have improved treatment options, and several efficacious combination therapies are available (4) . However, these regimens are expensive limiting access particularly in medium to low income countries where HCV is most prevalent (5) . To identify alternative, cost-effective treatment options for HCV and to explore mechanisms of viral replication, we screened a compound library including drugs approved to treat neuronal or heart diseases for antiviral activity against HCV.\n\nThe initial screen of the compounds was performed according to what was previously published (6) . Briefly, Huh7-Lunet/hCD81 cells constitutively expressing gaussia luciferase (G-Luc) were transfected with firefly reporter Jc1 (pFK-Luc-Jc1) and seeded into 96-well plates. Media containing serial dilutions of each compound were added to the cells after 4h. After 48h, the supernatant containing G-Luc was collected for cell viability assessment and cells were lysed and measured for firefly luciferase (F-Luc) activity as an indicator of HCV RNA replication. The supernatant of these cells was used to infect target cells. These were lysed after 48h and their reporter levels measured for whole life cycle assessment.\n\nThe assay was performed as previously described (7) . Huh7-Lunet/hCD81 cells (3 x 10 5 cells/ml) were seeded into each well of a 6-well plate one day before the experiment. The following day, cells were treated with Concanamycin A (5nM) for 1h at 37\u00b0C, before infection with concentrated reporter viruses in presence of Concanamycin A. The cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with medium containing Concanamycin A for 1h at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, cells are incubated for 5 min at 37\u00b0C with pH7 or pH5 citric acid buffer (McIlvaine buffer system). Fresh media was added to the cells in continuous presence of Concanamycin A for 3h longer. Medium was changed and infectivity was measured by assessment of reporter activity following 48h.\n\nHuh7-Lunet/hCD81 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (4 x 10 5 cells/well) one day before being infected with Jc1 virus stocks (pFK-Jc1) for 4h in presence of two concentrations of flunarizine (5.25\u03bcM or 10.5\u03bcM) or 1% DMSO before addition of fresh medium. 48 to 72h later, cells were split and flunarizine or DMSO was added after 4h. After 48h, virus containing supernatants were used for infection of new Huh7-Lunet-hCD81 cells, according to the procedure performed for the first infection. After 10 cycles of infection of na\u00efve cells and splitting of virus producing cells (approximately 10 weeks), cells were allowed to produce viruses in absence of any compound for 16h and supernatant was harvested for core measurement by ELISA. The stocks from DMSO, flunarizine 5.25\u03bcM and flunarizine 10.5\u03bcM -passaged viruses were normalized to have same core levels and used for infection of cells seeded in cover-slips in 24-well plates. Infection efficiency was assessed by immunofluorescence using the NS5A-specific monoclonal antibody 9E10 at a dilution of 1:2,000. Bound primary antibodies were detected using goat anti-mouse IgG-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:1000. Nuclear DNA was stained using DAPI at a dilution of 1:3000.\n\nLicensed HCV drugs target either polyprotein processing (NS3-4A protease inhibitors) or RNA replication (NS5A inhibitors, NS5B polymerase inhibitors). To identify molecules that would complement these therapies and that may reveal novel insights into other life cycle steps, we aimed at identifying inhibitors with a novel mode of action. In addition, such molecules should not suffer from potential viral cross-resistance to established drug classes. Thus, we chose a whole life cycle screening assay based on the GT2a chimeric Jc1luciferase reporter virus (JcR-2a) (8) , which interrogates HCV entry, RNA translation, polyprotein processing, RNA replication and virus assembly (Supporting Fig. S1 Fig. and  (6) ). Since inhibitors of the influenza A virus M2 ion channel have been used to treat humans and because HCV p7 is an ion channel protein essential for virus production, we screened a library of 23 compounds including several clinically approved ion channel inhibitors used to treat heart or neurologic conditions (Supporting Table ST1 ). Fifteen compounds inhibited HCV entry, assembly or release (Supporting Fig. S1 ). Flunarizine displayed an IC 50 value of 388nM (Supporting Table ST2 ) and a CC 50 value of 10.85\u03bcM which is equivalent to a therapeutic index (CC 50 /IC 50 ) of greater than 25 (Fig. 1A) . Flunarizine had recently emerged as an anti-HCV inhibitor in independent screening campaigns (9) (10) (11) . However, its mode of action remained unclear. Moreover, it was not explored if this molecule is antiviral in primary human hepatocytes and in vivo.\n\nTo address these limitations, we inoculated Huh7-Lunet/hCD81/G-Luc cells with a Jc1-F-Luc virus in the presence of the compound and subsequently washed away unbound virus and compound. Virus-encoded F-Luc activity was decreased by more than 10-fold at a dose of 1.3\u03bcM, whereas cell-encoded G-Luc expression was not affected, thereby indicating absence of cytotoxicity (Fig. 1B) . In contrast, addition of flunarizine to HCV RNAtransfected cells did not reduce release of infectious virus particle as determined by a corespecific ELISA and limiting dilution assay (TCID 50 ) (Supporting Fig. S2 ). Interestingly, it did not inhibit entry of HCV pseudotypes (HCVpp) carrying the J6-derived glycoproteins (Supporting Figure S3 ). Thus, flunarizine selectively inhibits entry of authentic, cell culture derived HCV (HCVcc) but not of HCVpp. Moreover, it does not inhibit RNA replication or virus assembly ( Fig. 1A and Supporting Fig. S2 ).\n\nNext, we infected primary human hepatocytes (PHH) with Jc1 particles in the presence of telaprevir, flunarizine or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solvent. Flunarizine significantly inhibited de novo production of infectious virus at both 24 and 48h after inoculation compared to inoculation in the presence of solvent (Fig. 1C) . Finally, we administered flunarizine to HCV cell entry reporter mice, which express crucial human co-factors for HCV entry and carry a luciferase reporter gene that is activated by the CRE-recombinase (12) . When these animals were challenged with infectious Jc1 expressing a CRErecombinase, flunarizine serum levels reached an average level of 133nM, which is close to the in vitro EC 50 value described above. Importantly, at this dose HCV-CRE-dependent activation of luciferase expression was significantly repressed (Fig. 1D) . Thus, flunarizine inhibits HCV cell entry into human primary liver cells both in vitro and humanized mouse hepatocytes in vivo.\n\nSince flunarizine did not inhibit infection by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or human coronavirus (Supporting Figure S4 ), we investigated if it prevents HCV entry across all seven HCV genotypes. Therefore, Huh7-Lunet/hCD81/G-Luc cells were inoculated with chimeric HCV viruses in the presence of increasing doses of flunarizine ( Fig. 2A) . All non-GT2 strains displayed resistance towards this drug with IC 50 values more than an order of magnitude greater than Jc1. The GT2b isolate showed an intermediate phenotype with an IC 50 value of 3.69\u03bcM and both GT2a isolates -JFH1 and Jc1-were highly susceptible displaying IC 50 values of 0.37\u03bcM and 0.22 \u03bcM, respectively. To map the determinants of flunarizine susceptibility, we shuffled viral core to NS2 proteins between the resistant Con1 (GT1b) and the susceptible Jc1 (GT2a). Transfer of Con1-derived p7 into Jc1 did not render the resulting virus (Jc1/Con1-p7) resistant to flunarizine (Fig. 2B ). In contrast, insertion of the Con1-derived E1-E2 proteins into Jc1 did confer flunarizine resistance to Jc1/Con1-E1-E2. Conversely, replacement of the Con1-derived E1-E2 sequences by those of Jc1 rendered the Con1 chimera (Con1-/J6-E1-E2) susceptible to the drug (Fig. 2B ). Therefore, susceptibility to flunarizine is governed by determinants resident in the E1-E2 genes. Likewise, when we exchanged structural proteins, p7 or NS2 between J6 (GT2a) or J8 (GT2b), all viruses carrying the J6 E1-E2 genes displayed greater susceptibility to flunarizine compared with those harboring the J8-derived glycoproteins (Supporting Figure  S5A ). A chimeric virus carrying J8 derived E2 in the backbone of Jc1 produced infectious virus and exhibited partial resistance to flunarizine indicating that determinants in both E1 and E2 influence susceptibility to this drug (Supporting Figure S5B ). Next, we used HCV particles trans-complemented with primary E1-E2 gene sequences from GT2a-and GT2binfected patients (13) . Also these clinical GT2a isolates were susceptible to flunarizine, whereas the GT2b isolates were resistant (Fig. 2C ). Finally, we created HCV transcomplemented particles carrying E1-E2 proteins from six additional GT2 subtypes including d, e, k, m, q, and r. All of these strains were susceptible to inhibition by flunarizine, albeit to variable degrees (Fig. 2D ). Collectively, this indicates that flunarizine interferes with HCV entry by targeting viral E1-E2 protein function(s) of almost all GT2 subtypes tested and with a clear preference for GT2 over other viral genotypes.\n\nTo corroborate that E1 and E2 are targeted by flunarizine, we passaged HCV in presence of flunarizine. After ten weeks we observed drug resistance as infection of Huh7-Lunet/ hCD81/G-Luc cells by virus populations cultured in the presence of the drug was poorly inhibited by flunarizine compared to viruses cultured in the presence of DMSO (Fig. 3A) . Sequencing revealed conserved amino acid mutations at positions M267V in E1 (A1140G in H77 genome), Q289H in E1 (A1208C in H77 genome), M405T in E2 (T1554C in H77 genome) and I757T in p7 (T2603C in H77 genome), which we engineered into the parental Jc1-luciferase virus either alone or in combination. Insertion of the p7 mutation did not change susceptibility to flunarizine (Fig. 3B ). In contrast, the E2 mutation and both Interestingly, E1 residue Q289 is fully conserved among all HCV sequences deposited in the gene bank database (Fig. 3C) . Additionally, 88.5 % of all GT2 isolates carry M267 which correlates with susceptibility to flunarizine in our GT2a virus Jc1, whereas all non-GT2 sequences encode glycine at this position (Supporting Table ST3 ). Finally, the E2 mutation resides in the hypervariable region, an important yet strain specific viral neutralizing epitope. The full conservation of 289 in E1 and the high level of conservation of 267 in E1 may indicate important functional constraints that could limit viral escape in vivo. To explore this, we evaluated neutralization of the flunarizine resistant virus by potent monoclonal antibodies. Neutralization by the E2-targeting HC-11 and AR4A antibodies was significantly enhanced by the flunarizine resistance mutations (Fig. 3D) . Collectively, a combination of three mutations -in part affecting highly conserved residues-is necessary to confer a 50-fold resistance to flunarizine. These mutations render HCV more susceptible to neutralizing antibodies, suggesting a high barrier to viral resistance.\n\nTo precisely define the mode of action of flunarizine, we conducted time-of-addition experiments including HCV entry inhibitors which arrest HCV infection at distinct stages of cell entry (Supporting Figure S6 ). Since flunarizine resistance was reached at a time point similar to resistance to inhibitors of endosomal acidification (e.g. concanamycin A), this suggested that flunarizine inhibits a late entry step. To explore this further, we used an HCV plasma membrane fusion assay where cells are pre-treated with concanamycin A to prevent viral entry and membrane fusion via the normal route through acidified endosomes (7) (Fig.  4 ). Under these circumstances, HCV fusion and thus productive infection can be triggered by briefly exposing virus inoculated cells to a low pH buffer. Because HCV membrane fusion requires receptor interactions including the binding to CD81 (14) the virus is receptive to this exogenous trigger (low pH buffer) only after an incubation of ca. 1h at 37\u00b0C (7) . Thus, Huh7-Lunet/hCD81 cells were continuously treated with concanamycin A and additional drugs were added either directly after virus inoculation and throughout the experiment until 4h post temperature shift (Fig. 4A , protocol I), only during the incubation with low pH buffer (protocol II) or only directly subsequent to the fusion triggering low pH wash (protocol III). A buffer with neutral pH 7 was used to control that productive infection fully depends on low pH-induced fusion. As expected, HCV infection only occurred when cells were exposed to low pH buffer, since only then luciferase expression above the background of uninfected cells was detected (Fig. 4B ). When DMSO was added to the cells according to protocol I, II or III, the low pH wash resulted in high luciferase activity approximately 50-fold above the background of mock infected cells or virus inoculated cells treated with the neutral pH buffer (Fig. 4B) . Addition of bafilomycin A1, which like concanamycin A prevents acidification of endosomes, did not have an antiviral effect, regardless of the administration protocol. This confirms that HCV can only access cells by exogenous administration of low pH, independently of endosomal acidification. Moreover, all inhibitors had completely lost antiviral activity when applied directly after the low pH fusion trigger, indicating that they exert their antiviral activity by blocking HCV entry Perin et al.\n\nHepatology.

Both BJ486K and flunarizine reduced HCV infection essentially to background levels when administered directly after virus inoculation, and thus when present during virus trafficking at the cell surface (1h 37\u00b0C) and the low pH-fusion treatment. However, only flunarizine was fully antiviral when added selectively during the five minutes low pH washing step (Fig. 4B, protocol II) . Interestingly, viruses carrying the two E1 resistance mutations were no longer inhibited (Fig.  5C ), whereas the E2 mutation alone was not sufficient to confer flunarizine resistance in this fusion assay. These results indicate that flunarizine specifically targets HCV membrane fusion and that resistance is primarily mediated by two mutations within E1.\n\nTo further corroborate that flunarizine targets HCV fusion, we utilized an imaging assay of fluorescent DiD-HCV entry into polarized, three dimensional hepatocyte cultures (Baktash et al., unpublished data), which enables quantification of HCV single particle cell surface trafficking to the tight junction complex, virus internalization into early endosomes and ultimately fusion and uncoating. Following DiD-HCV fusion and uncoating, there is an increase in distribution of fluorescence due to mixing of DiD with cellular membranes, which can be quantified (15) . Huh-7.5 cells were grown in extracellular matrix to form hepatic spheroids, were treated with either flunarize or the vehicle control, infected with DiD-HCV and imaged for colocalization with either the tight junction marker zona occludins (ZO)-1 or the early endosomal marker early endosomal antigen (EEA)-1 over a time course of entry. We observed that flunarizine did not affect the localization of DiD-HCV to the tight junction (Fig. 5A, B) nor did it affect the internalization and localization of DiD-HCV with the early endosome (Fig. 5C, D) . Treatment with flunarizine did decrease DiD-HCV fusion, which is evidenced by significantly lower DiD fluorescence volume at 360min post temperature shift as compared to the vehicle control (Fig. 5E,F) . Therefore, flunarizine does not affect HCV trafficking and endocytosis but inhibits fusion of HCV with the endosomal membrane.\n\nFlunarizine is a T-type Ca 2+ channel inhibitor and belongs to the group of diarylmethyl piperazine drugs. A range of structurally related drugs (e.g. pimozide) are known which also block Ca 2+ ion channels and which are used as anti-psychotic drugs (16) . Moreover, phenothiazines such as fluphenazine and trifluoperazine are also important drugs in which the phenothiazine group resembles the biarylmethyl group. Indeed, all of these have emerged as potent HCV inhibitors in our screening (Supporting Figure S1 ). Therefore, we explored if inhibition of Ca 2+ ion channels in general is essential for the antiviral activity of these molecules. Furthermore, we investigated if these drugs inhibit HCV via an antiviral mechanism comparable to flunarizine. To address this we explored the influence of 1,2bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) and ethylene glycol tetra acetic acid (EGTA), two Ca 2+ -chelating agents, which sequester intracellular and extracellular Ca 2+ -pools, respectively, on the antiviral activity of flunarizine. Although both BAPTA and EGTA were administered at high doses, they did not modulate the antiviral activity of flunarizine indicating inhibition of HCV entry by flunarizine does not depend on availability of Ca 2+ (Fig. 6A ). Next we explored if mibefradil (17), penfluridol (18), or NiCl 2 (19) , three well established inhibitors of T-type Ca 2+ channels, interfere with HCV infection. Neither of these molecules inhibited infection of parental HCV or flunarizineresistant HCV (Fig. 6B ). In contrast, both phenothiazines (fluphenazine and trifluoperazine) and pimozide preferentially inhibited the parental virus and were less active against the variant with flunarizin resistance mutations. The antiviral activity of BJ486K (20) and curcumin (21) -two molecules that inhibit HCV cell entry by different molecular mechanisms -was not influenced by these mutations (Fig. 6B) . While this work was in preparation, Chamoun-Emmanueli reported that selected phenothiazines inhibit HCV entry potentially by increasing the fluidity of cholesterol-rich membranes (22) . This prompted us to explore if viral susceptibility to flunarizine correlates with susceptibility to modulation of membrane fluidity achieved by depletion of cholesterol using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Interestingly, we observed that Jc1 was significantly more susceptible to cholesterol depletion than a genotype 5a virus, which has high endogenous flunarizine resistance (Fig.  6C) . Moreover, also the flunarizine-resistant Jc1-variant was significantly more resistant to depletion of cholesterol compared with parental Jc1 (Fig. 6C ). This suggests that differences in the dependence of the HCV fusion machinery on membrane properties may in part determine susceptibility to flunarizine, phenothiazines and pimozide. However, in our experiments these drugs did not modulate membrane fluidity (Supporting Figure S7 ) nor cellular cholesterol content (Supporting Figure S8 ), suggesting that other membrane changes are responsible for fusion inhibition.\n\nNotably, pimozide was antiviral in vivo (Fig. 1D) , and the individual mutations in E1 and E2 conferred partial resistance to pimozide like they did to flunarizine (Supporting Figure S9) . Finally, fluphenazine, trifluoperazine and pimozide displayed a preference for GT2a over the other GTs, very similar to flunarizine. However, pimozide and fluphenazine displayed a much improved cross-genotype coverage with IC50 values below 10\u03bcM for GT 3a, 5a and 7a in case of pimozide and for GT3a, 6a and 7a for fluphenazine (Fig. 7) . In conclusion, the antiviral activity of flunarizine and related compounds is not directly linked with their ability to inhibit Ca 2+ ion channels. Nevertheless, viral cross-resistance and comparable genotypespecificity between flunarizine, these phenothiazines and pimozide, strongly argue for a shared antiviral mode of action.\n\nWe screened a library of clinically licensed drugs and identified four related ion channel inhibitors that prevent HCV entry in vitro and in vivo. We provide evidence based on chimeric viruses and resistance mutations that these molecules selectively target HCV E1-E2 functioning during entry. Moreover, time of addition experiments and single particle tracking indicate that these drugs specifically inhibit HCV membrane fusion. Finally, the domain of E1 carrying the resistance mutations likely plays a key role in membrane fusion.\n\nSeveral scenarios how these molecules prevent HCV membrane fusion are possible. Firstly, these drugs which all inhibit cellular Ca 2+ -channels, may prevent fusion by changing Ca 2+fluxes in HCV target cells and/or by directly blocking the interaction of HCV with a Ca 2+channel critical for membrane fusion. However, not all tested Ca 2+ -channel targeting drugs also arrested HCV infection. Moreover, sequestration of Ca 2+ did not modulate the antiviral activity of flunarizine. Therefore, we consider it unlikely that inhibition of Ca 2+ -channels by these drugs -which then would be used by HCV in a genotype-dependent fashion -is responsible for the anti-HCV activity of this class of molecules.\n\nSecondly, it is possible that flunarizine, pimozide and phenothiazines directly bind E1-E2, thereby inhibiting membrane fusion. The genotype-specificity of the antiviral activity supports this notion since sequence variation may prevent drug binding. However, HCVpp carrying the same viral envelope proteins as flunarizine-susceptible HCVcc particles are not inhibited by flunarizine, arguing against this. Also Chockalingam et al. and Hu et al. reported resistance of HCVpp to flunarizine leading them to conclude that flunarizine is likely not an entry inhibitor (10, 11) . Our data, however, show that flunarizine inhibits entry of authentic HCV at the stage of membrane fusion. This highlights an as yet unexplored difference between the mode of HCVpp and HCVcc membrane fusion which may arise because HCVpp are produced in 293T cells rather than in human liver cells. Consequently, HCVpp could differ in lipid and lipoprotein composition thus affecting cell entry. Notably, it has been reported that receptor usage can differ between HCVcc and HCVpp with only the former using the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 cholesterol absorption receptor for cell entry (23) . Furthermore, Meertens and colleagues observed that cholesterol depletion of the host cell had no effect on the entry of HCVpp, whereas it was antiviral for HCVcc (24) . Therefore, the resistance mutations identified by us could be part of a direct drug binding site, or they could modulate the conformation and function of E1-E2 in membrane fusion which seems to be exquisitely cholesterol dependent for HCVcc particles. The E1 domain from residue 264 to 290 has previously been implicated in harboring an HCV fusion peptide based on phylogenetic comparison with related flaviviruses, sequence conservation and hydrophobicity (25) . The observation that drugs that specifically inhibit membrane fusion select for viral resistance in this region indirectly supports the notion that this peptide is critical for fusion. The crystal structures of E2 did not reveal evidence for a major role of E2 as fusion protein so that E1 is now assumed to be the primary fusion protein of HCV (26, 27) . This is also supported by earlier studies (28) (29) (30) .\n\nFinally, it is possible that these lipophilic drugs perturb membrane properties critical for virus membrane fusion. In fact, while this work was in preparation Chamoun-Emanuelli reported that this was the case for specific phenothiazines including fluphenazine and trifluoperazine, also characterized by us (22) . Intriguingly, we observed a correlation between HCV susceptibility to flunarizine and susceptibility of HCV to cholesteroldepletion induced changes in membrane properties. This result is compatible with the notion that also flunarizine and pimozide -like phenothiazines -modulate membrane fluidity and that this is the antiviral principle of these groups of compounds. In turn, the genotypespecific antiviral activity of these molecules implies that viral strains differ with regard to membrane requirements during fusion. The cholesterol depletion experiment reported here, which shows that Jc1 is more susceptible to cholesterol depletion compared to the flunarizine resistant Jc1 and to a flunarizine resistant strain (GT5a) supports this notion. However, unlike Chamoun-Emanuelli but consistent with Thomas and Verkleij we did not observe a modification of membrane fluidity by flunarizin and related drugs (31) . This discrepancy between studies may be due to differences in the assay set up including the composition of liposomes (Supporting Figure S7) . Moreover, flunarizine and related compounds did not extract cholesterol from Huh-7.5 cells -even upon prolonged incubation (Supporting Figure S8 ).\n\nFlunarizine also affects other biophysical membrane properties. For example, it inhibits the formation of hexagonal H II phase (31) , which is homologous to the formation of the negative curvature required for fusion of viral and cellular membranes (32, 33) . Notably, cholesterol depletion also affects the ability of a lipid bilayer to form the negative curvature required for fusion. Flunarizine may therefore inhibit HCV infectivity by affecting biophysical properties of the cellular membranes which are also dependent on cholesterol content, other than fluidity.\n\nA combination of three amino acid changes was necessary to obtain a 50-fold viral resistance to flunarizine. Moreover, the resistance mutation affected in part completely or highly conserved residues and significantly increased virus neutralization by two crossneutralizing antibodies suggesting that the barrier to viral resistance could be relatively high in vivo. Therefore, flunarizine and related compounds merit consideration for repurposing as potential adjunct therapy for GT2 infected patients and due to broader GT coverage in case of pimozide, trifluoperazine and fluphenazine also for the difficult to treat GT3.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\nHCVcc cell culture-derived HCV PHH Primary human hepatocyte "}
