{"title": "Synanthropic rodents as virus reservoirs and\ntransmitters", "body": "Rodents (Order: Rodentia) are distributed on all continents except for\nAntarctica\n1\n. Their heterogeneous and cosmopolitan distribution expands as their\ninteraction with humans increases\n2\n. Some species are better able to adapt to urban environments\n(synanthropism).\n\nIn a study conducted in Buenos Aires (Argentina), black rats (Rattus\nrattus) were found in residential and industrial areas, while house\nmice (Mus musculus) and brown rats (Rattus\nnorvegicus) were captured in green areas and shantytowns\n3\n, where their presence was favored by easy access, availability of shelter,\nand large food supply\n4\n.\n\nThese animals are natural reservoirs of infectious diseases\n5\n\n,\n\n6\n, and are involved in the emergence and dissemination of viruses, bacteria,\nand protozoa. The transmission of these agents can occur through both direct (bite,\ncontact) and indirect (urine, feces) means, through vectors (ticks, fleas, and\nmites) that infest rodents, or when they are predated by other species\n1\n\n,\n\n7\n\n,\n\n8\n.\n\nAlthough little information is currently available on the size of the population of\nsynanthropic rats, some indicators allow the subjective estimation of their\npresence, such as the presence of excrement, marks on walls, trails on the ground,\nfood sources, or the visual observation of rodents and/or the damage caused by\nthem\n9\n\n-\n\n11\n.\n\nTo evaluate the size of rodent populations, the concept of the \u2018minimum known number\u2019\nis used\n12\n, where individuals have to be captured and recaptured to estimate the\ninfestation rate. This statistical formula can be simplified by multiplying the\nnumber of animals caught in a trap in a single catch by 100\n11\n\n,\n\n13\n.\n\nA survey carried out in 1529 dwellings in a low-income region of S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil)\nshowed an initial synanthropic rodent infestation rate of 40%, which was reduced to\n14.4% after the implementation of sanitary education and pest control\n13\n. Similarly, in Pau de Lima (Bahia, Brazil), 62% of households (137/221)\npresented signs of active rodent infestations\n14\n.\n\nBesides synanthropic species, other rodents can cocirculate in rural environments and\nwild and urban interface areas, where they contact other animals and people\n10\n\n,\n\n15\n. Wild rodents are reservoirs for hantavirus, vaccinia virus, and\nLassa virus, among others\n16\n\n-\n\n19\n.\n\nFernandes et al. (2019)\n20\n investigated rural settlements in Goi\u00e1s (Brazil), and found 2.57% (n=12)\npositive rate for Orthohantavirus, equally distributed between\nwomen and men (n=6). In contrast, similar studies showed higher frequency in\nmiddle-aged men due to their risk behaviors\n21\n\n,\n\n22\n.\n\nRefugee camps accommodate large number of people and consequently there is\naccumulation of food and residues, attracting rodents (synanthropic and wild). In\nAfrica, studies have revealed the circulation of Mastomys\nnatalensis infected by Lassa virus in these camps,\nwhich is facilitated by the dissemination routes of the virus (urine, fomites,\nconsumption of rodents as food)\n23\n. Bonner et al. (2007)\n24\n investigated communities of up to 9,000 people and determined that the\nquality of housing, external hygiene, and the visualization of rodent burrows were\nthe main epidemiological factors associated with the spread of Lassa\nvirus.\n\nAircrafts and ships may also contribute to the introduction of rodents and even\ndissemination of diseases in new areas\n25\n\n,\n\n26\n. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has implemented rodent\ncontrol measures at airports and ports, including periodic surveys to verify the\nabsence of rodents onboard vessels. According to reports, 24.7% (270/1093) of moored\nships at the port of Shanwei (China) were infested with rats\n25\n. In Heilongjian, another Chinese port area, 4.47% of the 649 collected rats\ntested positive for hantavirus\n27\n.\n\nTherefore, this article aims to review important viral agents disseminated by\nsynanthropic rodents (M. musculus, R. rattus, and\nR. norvegicus), and thereby contribute to a better\nunderstanding of disease epidemiology and prevention.\n\nScientific texts in English and Portuguese were retrieved from the PubMed, Scopus,\nWeb of Science, and Scielo research platforms using the search term \u201cvirus\u201d in\ncombination with \u201cdisease\u201d and \u201crat or rodent or murine\u201d. Additionally, a second\nmore refined research was performed with the terms \u201cHepatitis E,\u201d \u201cHantavirus,\u201d\n\u201cRotavirus,\u201d \u201cCoronavirus\u201d, or \u201cArenavirus\u201d associated with \u201crat or rodent or\nmurine.\u201d\n\nAmong the resulting, studies mainly related to synanthropic rodents (M.\nmusculus; R. rattus; R. norvegicus)\ncollected in the field were selected, excluding the studies restricted to animal\nexperimentation.\n\nThus, hepatitis E, hantavirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, and arenavirus are the focus\nof this review, as they are neglected diseases transmitted by rodents.\n\nThe hepatitis E virus (HEV) has a single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 7 kb\nlength\n28\n. As a member of the Hepeviridae family, the genus\nOrthohepevirus has four species (from A to\nD)\n29\n, among which Orthohepevirus A and C have\nalready been described in rodents\n30\n.\n\nInfection occurs via the fecal-oral route through the consumption of water\ncontaminated with excrement or the consumption of raw/undercooked meat and the\nviscera of infected animals\n31\n. The prevalence rate in humans reaches 40% in industrialized countries, and\nthe virus has been detected in blood banks\n32\n. Socially vulnerable people may be an important epidemiological group at\nrisk, along with patients who depend on blood transfusions\n33\n\n,\n\n34\n.\n\nThe virus shows tropism to digestive system and is eliminated in stool after 4 to 23\ndays of infection\n35\n, remaining in this state for additional 5 weeks\n36\n\n,\n\n37\n.\n\nThe symptoms are mainly nonspecific, and include fever, headaches, abdominal pain,\nbut these infections may also be asymptomatic (depending on the HEV dose to which\nthe patient was exposed), hindering the detection, and potentiating the agent\u2019s\nspread\n38\n\n-\n\n40\n.\n\nMortality rates are higher among infected people presenting previous liver disease,\nimmunocompromised patients, and pregnant women, as they present higher chances of\nrenal failure leading to death\n33\n\n,\n\n41\n\n,\n\n42\n.\n\nThe role of black rats (R. rattus) and brown rats (R.\nnorvegicus) as reservoirs and transmitters of this viral agent and its\nprevalence rate remains unknown\n30\n.\n\n\nOrthohepevirus A has seven different genotypes (HEV1-7) defined by\nthe concatenated amino acid distance between the open reading frames of ORF1\n(nonstructural proteins) and ORF2 (capsid proteins)\n43\n. HEV-1 and HEV-2 occur only in humans; HEV-3 has been isolated from humans\nand several animal species; HEV-4 has been isolated from humans and pigs; HEV-5 and\nHEV-6 have been identified only in wild boars; and HEV-7 has only been found in\ncamels\n44\n.\n\nThe presence of anti-HEV IgG\n30\n\n,\n\n45\n, and the detection of viral particles in the feces of these rodents (with or\nwithout seroconversion) have been demonstrated\n37\n\n,\n\n46\n\n,\n\n47\n. However, only a single study has shown similarities between rodent\n(R. norvegicus) strains with regard to the HEV-3 genotype,\nwhich is most closely related to the genotypes found in rabbits\n37\n.\n\nOn the other hand, rat HEV (genotype C1), belonging to the\nOrthohepevirus C group, has been reported in R.\nnorvegicus and R. rattus, although its potential to\ncause disease in humans is still questioned\n37\n\n,\n\n47\n.\n\nIn Vietnam, animals captured at bus stations and hospitals have tested positive for\nrat HEV\n48\n. These findings are supported by serological evidence from domestic animals\nand rodents in other studies\n45\n\n,\n\n49\n\n,\n\n50\n.\n\nDetection methods for HEV include serological (specific IgG), histopathological, and\nmolecular (RT-PCR) techniques\n41\n. Commercially, there are no specific prophylatic measures available on the\nmarket, although Chinese researchers have developed the HEV p239 vaccine from the\nHEV1 genotype\n51\n. Its efficacy is considered high (> 90%), requiring three doses (0,.1 and\n6 months), and it may be used even in pregnant women\n52\n.\n\nHantaviruses, belonging to the Hantaviridae family, are divided into\nfour genera: Loanvirus, Mobatvirus,\nThottimvirus, and Orthohantavirus\n\n53\n. These enveloped viruses have a negative-sense RNA genome segmented into\nthree fragments: Large - L (6.8-12 kb), Middle - M (3.2-4.9 kb), and Small - S (1-3\nkb). They encode four proteins; the L segment encodes viral polymerase, while the M\nand S segments encode the precursor (GPC) of two viral surface glycoproteins (G1 and\nG2, alternatively called Gn and Gc), and the nucleocapsid (N) protein,\nrespectively\n54\n.\n\nMore than 50 species of hantaviruses have been reported worldwide\n55\n; however, some of them do not cause diseases, including the Prospect\nHill virus\n56\n. Rodents, bats, and moles are reservoirs of these agents\n57\n; transmission occurs through bites (saliva), and especially via the\ninhalation of viral particles from the feces and urine of these animals\n58\n. Despite a report of transmission between humans, this form is rare\n59\n.\n\nThe Orthohantavirus genus includes the greatest number of pathogenic\nspecies of public health importance\n60\n. Its presence is associated with the geographic distribution of rodents\n(Murinae, Avicolinae, and Sigmodontinae families), which can harbor\ndistinct forms of the disease.\n\n\nThe earliest reports of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), caused by\nviruses known as Old World hantaviruses (Europe and Asia), come from Chinese\nwritings dating from 960 BC. Later, in the Korean War (1951-1954), these diseases\ncaused the death of over 3,000 soldiers\n61\n. The Hantaan virus (HTNV) species was related to this\noutbreak. HTNV was isolated for the first time in 1978\n62\n and was linked to the rodent Apodemus agrarius; the virus\nwas detected in blood, urine, feces, and respiratory tract samples. In humans, this\nspecies causes a severe form of HFRS, which has thus far been restricted to rural\nareas of China, Korea, and Russia\n63\n\n,\n\n64\n.\n\n\nDobrava virus (DOBV) is also associated with HFRS syndrome, for\nwhich men are accidental hosts\n65\n. Mortality rates vary according to the genotype, ranging from 0.5% (DOBV -\nKurkino) to 12% (DOBV - Dobrava and DOBV -\nSochi)\n66\n\n,\n\n67\n.\n\nThe most commonly detected viral agent of this group in Western Europe,\nPuumala virus (PUUV), is disseminated by Myodes\nglareolus, whose proliferation is favored by the underbrush vegetation\nof this region, and the spread of the virus is further affected by virus-host\ncoevolution\n68\n. In humans, it causes moderate nephropathy, and can lead to subclinical\ninfections\n69\n.\n\n\nSeoul virus usually causes mild infections and without medical care\nthe mortality rates reach 1%. The host of this virus (R.\nnorvegicus) is found in urban areas, leading to a cosmopolitan distribution\nof the disease, in contrast to those caused by other Old World hantaviruses\n60\n\n,\n\n70\n. The incubation period varies from 2-3 weeks, and the endothelial cell\ntropism of the virus\n71\n produces nonspecific symptomatology (fever, headaches, muscle pain, nausea,\nvomiting), in addition to respiratory problems, dizziness, and diarrhea.\nThrombocytopenia entails the development of petechias, and decreased blood pressure\naffects kidney function, causing renal failure followed by disseminated\nintravascular coagulation\n72\n.\n\nHantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) is another pathology associated with\nagents of the genus New World hantaviruses (Americas), and appears to be related to\nclimatic phenomena such as El Ni\u00f1o\n\n58\n.\n\nThe first report of hantavirus in Brazil dates from 1993, when\nJuquitiba virus, transmitted by Oligoryzomys\nnigripes, was detected by Silva et al. (1997)\n73\n\n. To date, the following viruses have been identified in the\ncountry: (a) Araraquara virus (transmitted by Necromys\nlasiurus rodents); (b) Castelo dos\nSonhos virus (Oligoryzomys utiaritensis); (c)\nLaguna Negra virus (Calomys callidus); (d)\nAnajatuba virus (Oligoryzomys mattogrossae);\nand Rio Mamore virus (Oligoryzomys microtis),\namong others\n20\n.\n\nThe incubation period of HCPS ranges between 16-24 days, with initial nonspecific\nHFRS-like symptomatology differentiated by pulmonary edema and lymphoid organ\nimpairment\n74\n, which may cause cardiovascular shock and death\n72\n. Studies indicate that this pulmonary phase lasts approximately 1 week, but\nlong-lasting sequelae have been reported, such as dyspnea and weakness\n61\n. According to available data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, 2061\npeople had been infected in the country as of 2017, with a lethality rate of\n40.1%\n75\n.\n\nIn rodents, this virus causes a chronic infection with mild symptomatology such as\ndecreased growth\n76\n and renal problems\n77\n, although it is usually asymptomatic. This can be explained by the\ncoevolution of rodents with the virus over millions of years\n78\n. Hantavirus can be diagnosed by associating the patient\u2019s history with the\npresence of wild or synanthropic rodents. Tests for hantavirus include specific\nserological detection using ELISA (IgM or IgG) or viral detection using RT-PCR or\nreal-time PCR\n79\n.\n\nThe occurrence of HFRS has not yet been reported in Brazil, despite serologically\npositive human and rodent samples\n80\n. For example, in an urban area in Salvador, Brazil, Seoul\nvirus antibodies were found in R. norvegicus serum samples\n81\n. A molecular survey conducted in Madagascar detected the\nAnjozorobe virus (Thailand Orthohantavirus)\nstrain in R. rattus and M. musculus, suggesting\nviral spillover\n82\n.\n\nTo our knowledge, there is no licensed vaccine available on the market that prevents\nhantavirus infections. Several clinical trials at different stages are ongoing to\ntest inactivated (monovalent and bivalent), DNA, and live attenuated vaccines for\nboth HFRS and HCPS, with effectiveness of approximately 93.77-100% being\nreported\n83\n-\n85\n. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that the use of antiviral ribavirin\nincreases the survival rate in hantavirus-infected rats\n86\n\n-\n\n88\n.\n\nRotavirus (RV) belongs to the Rotavirus genus within the\nSedoreovirinae subfamily of the Reoviridae\nfamily\n53\n. These nonenveloped viruses have a double-stranded RNA genome of\napproximately 18550 bp in length, fragmented into 11 segments. The genome encodes\nsix structural (VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP6, and VP7) and six nonstructural (NSP1, NSP2,\nNSP3, NSP4, and NSP5/6) proteins, as the NSP5/6 gene is bicistronic\n89\n\n,\n\n90\n.\n\nMyriad mechanisms of viral variability occur in RVs, such as point mutations,\nrearrangements, reassortments, and intragenic recombination, conferring great\ngenetic diversity\n91\n\n,\n\n92\n. This genus is divided into nine different groups (RVA-RVI) based on the\nantigenic properties and nucleotide sequences of the VP6 protein\n89\n\n,\n\n93\n\n,\n\n94\n, and there is a potential candidate tenth group, RVJ\n95\n.\n\nFor the RVA group, it is necessary to adopt the notation of\nGx-P[x]-Ix-Rx-Cx-Mx-Ax-Nx-Tx-Ex-Hx, which considers all the variability presented by\nthe coding genes of the VP7-VP4-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5/6 proteins,\nrespectively\n96\n. To date, this group has at least 36 known G genotypes and 51 known P\ngenotypes in humans and animals\n93\n\n,\n\n97\n\n-\n\n99\n.\n\nAlthough rotaviruses are considered species-specific, heterologous infections may\noccur\n100\n. Wa-like and DS1-like (RVA) strains primarily cause disease in humans, and\ninfections caused by genotypes and serotypes common to animals have also been\ndocumented\n100\n\n,\n\n101\n.\n\nSynanthropic rodents are usually not associated with RVs, however, their efficiency\nin disease transmission and their close contact with other animals and people\nhighlight their importance to the epidemiology of these viruses\n101\n\n,\n\n102\n.\n\nTransmission initially occurs through the fecal-oral route, via particles present in\nthe soil and water, causing diarrhea due to the loss of absorptive capacity of\ninjured intestinal cells during viral replication\n103\n. Diarrhea is a leading cause of infant mortality worldwide, and rotavirus\ninfections are responsible for more than 35% of these cases\n104\n.\n\nRVs are widely distributed in Brazil, and have been described in animals (both young\nand adults) such as cattle\n105\n, birds\n106\n, and pigs\n107\n\n,\n\n108\n. In rodents, there is a single report of RVA associated with swine\nproduction\n109\n.\n\nA metagenomic analysis of R. norvegicus in Germany characterized a\nsample of RVA, revealing close identity between the identified strain and other\nanimal and human strains, namely, genotypes G3, P[3], and N2\n110\n.\n\nIn Italy, 40 fecal samples from R. rattus collected on swine farms\nwere analyzed, and a sample of RVA was characterized\n(G3-P[3]-I1-R11-C11-M10-A22-N18-T14-E18-H13), demonstrating an atypical combination\nof genotypes\n102\n.\n\nAs the associated symptomatology is mainly nonspecific, the diagnosis can easily be\nmisleading\n111\n. Commercial ELISA kits, RT-PCR (single or multiplex), and qPCR assays\n99\n\n,\n\n102\n\n,\n\n110\n are available for the detection of these infections.\n\nTo control this disease, animal vaccination (swine and cattle) should be carried out,\nmainly in females in the late gestation period. In production animals, prevalence\nrates may be higher than 90% in adults\n103\n. For humans, two vaccines are authorized by the WHO: (a) Rotarix\u00ae\n(GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium, an attenuated strain of G1P [8]\nRVA) and (b) RotaTeq\u00ae (Merck & Co., Whitehouse Station, NJ, with five strains of\ngenotypes G1P [5], G2P [5], G3P [5], G4P [5] and G6P [8]).\n\n Coronaviruses are enveloped, nonsegmented, positive, single-stranded RNA viruses\nassociated with the structural N-phosphoprotein in a nucleocapsid with helical\nsymmetry\n112\n\n,\n\n113\n. They are found in a wide variety of animals causing respiratory, enteric,\nhepatic, and neurological diseases of varying severity\n114\n. According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, two\nsubfamilies belong to the Coronaviridae family;\nLetovirinae, which has one subgenus,\nMilecovirus, found only in frogs and a sea hare thus far\n115\n, and Orthocoronavirinae, which is found in birds and\nmammals, and is divided into four genera due to the antigenic and genetic\ncharacteristics of the viruses\n53\n\n,\n\n116\n.\n\nPhylogenetic studies indicate that bats are the gene source for\nAlpha and Betacoronaviruses, while birds are\nthe gene source for Gama and Deltacoronaviruses\n\n117\n. Thus, Alpha and Betacoronaviruses are\nfound mainly in mammals, such as humans, dogs, cats, pigs, bats, mice, rats, horses,\nand cattle\n114\n\n,\n\n118\n\n-\n\n123\n, while Gama and Deltacoronaviruses infect\nmainly birds, with exceptions such as the white whale\nGamacoronavirus (Delphinapterus leucas)\n124\n and the porcine Deltacoronavirus\n\n125\n.\n\nAmong the Alpha and Betacoronaviruses, six are of\npublic health importance, causing mild (HCoV-229E, NL63, OC43, and HKV1) to severe\nrespiratory syndromes (SARS and MERS)\n120\n\n,\n\n126\n\n,\n\n127\n.\n\nDespite the many uncertainties about the epidemiology and reservoirs of severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), bats\nhave been identified as the most likely reservoirs, while palm civets\n(Paguma larvata)\n128\n and dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius)\n129\n\n,\n\n130\n act as intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans\n120\n\n,\n\n131\n\n,\n\n132\n. Both diseases have caused worldwide health problems, affecting 27 countries\nand causing hundreds of deaths in 2002 (SARS) and 2012 (MERS), aggravated by\nnosocomial transmission or transmission by family members\n126\n.\n\nIn general, the virion contains at least three proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M),\nand envelope (E) proteins. In addition, some coronaviruses include hemagglutinin\nesterase (HE)\n133\n. Proteins M and E are related to viral assembly\n134\n, while the S protein show hemagglutinating activity and is the main target\nfor neutralizing antibodies\n135\n.\n\nThe S protein, which shows great variability, is responsible for host specificity\nbecause its S1 and S2 subunits are used for binding the virus to host cell\nreceptors, and are associated with the antigenicity and pathogenicity of the\nvirus\n112\n\n,\n\n136\n.\n\nMany similarities exist between the CoVs of rats and bats\n119\n\n,\n\n120\n\n,\n\n140\n\n,\n\n141\n, suggesting that rodents could act as important reservoirs\n142\n. A survey conducted on 330 intestinal content samples from rodents\n(Apodemus sp., Myodes glareolus,\nArvicola terrestris, and Microtus sp.),\ncollected between 2014 and 2016 in different regions of France\n121\n, revealed positivity of 6.3% (21 samples), all belonging to\nAlphacoronavirus groups. This study also revealed\nAlpha and Betacoronavirus in bats, rabbits,\nand hedgehogs from the same area\n121\n.\n\nAn investigation conducted in China\n120\n, analyzed 177 rodent intestinal samples from three different species\n(Apodemus chevrieri, Apodemus ilex, and\nEothenomys fidelis), and found Alpha and\nBetacoronavirus in 13% (23 samples). \n\nBesides field investigations, rodent CoV also has an important role as Murine\nhepatitis virus (MHV)\n137\n, and has been used for experimental infections, mostly for the\nidentification of potential viruses showing interspecies transmission\n119\n. Although there is little information about the prevalence and diversity CoV\nin rodents\n138\n\n,\n\n139\n, many new species of Alpha and\nBetacoronaviruses (LRNV, LAMV, LRLV, and HKU24) have been\nidentified in rodents in China and Europe\n119\n\n,\n\n120\n\n,\n\n140\n\n,\n\n141\n.\n\n Some vaccine candidates are being developed only for MERS-CoV, including\nwhole-virus, vectored virus, DNA, and protein-based vaccines, however, lack of\ninvestment is delaying their development\n143\n.\n\nArenaviruses (genus Arenavirus, family\nArenaviridae) are enveloped viruses with an RNA genome segmented in\ntwo ambisense single stranded molecules: small (S) and large (L)\n53\n. The S portion encodes nucleocapsid protein and envelope glycoproteins,\nwhile L segment contains RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and zinc-binding\nprotein genes. Both S and L intergenic regions may potentially form one or more\nhairpins, which regulate mRNA transcription\n53\n\n,\n\n144\n\n-\n\n146\n. \n\nThis viral family has four genera, based on phylogenetic analysis involving pairwise\nsequence comparisons (PASC) of complete genomes\n53\n\n,\n\n147\n. Antennavirus genus includes viruses that infect\nfrogfish\n148\n, Hartmanivirus and Reptarenavirus infect\nsnakes, and Mammarenavirus, which have been reported in bats,\nticks, rodents, and primates, including humans\n146\n\n,\n\n147\n. \n\n\nMammarenaviruses are correlated to the geographical location where\ntheir hosts are found\n147\n; currently classified as: (a) Old World (OW) (Lassa virus,\nLujo virus, among others), and found mainly in Africa in\nrodents of the Murinae family as natural hosts\n149\n. Although Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) belongs\nto this category, it circulates globally\n146\n. Approximately 5% of the human population have been exposed to LCMV, due to\nthe ubiquity of the virus host, M. musculus\n\n150\n; (b) New World (NW), found in the American continent, are divided into four\nclades (A-D)\n151\n. Examples of NW viruses are Junin virus - Argentina\n152\n, Machupo virus - Bol\u00edvia\n153\n, Sabi\u00e1 virus - Brazil\n154\n, and Guanarito virus - Venezuela\n155\n. Sigmodontinae rodents are the main hosts of this class,\neven though Tacaribe virus has already been described in bats\n156\n and Amblyomma americanum ticks\n157\n.\n\nMembers of both OW and NW arenaviruses can cause hemorrhagic fever and severe human\ndiseases affecting the central nervous system\n158\n. Zoonotic transmission is through contact with rodents\u2019 urine or feces, and\nhuman-to-human transmission is possible\n146\n. Because of their impact on human health and rapid spread, they are\npotential bioterrorism agents\n159\n.\n\nIn Colombia, a study conducted with M. musculus, collected from\nresidential areas, detected 10% (8/80) of positives in serological analysis for\nLCMV. When brain samples of the same animals were submitted to RT-PCR, serologically\nnegative individuals showed positive results in this second analysis, highlighting\nthe importance of parallel diagnosis\n160\n. It can be justified by the vertical transmission among rodents that may\ndeactivate cytotoxic T- lymphocytes, generating immune-complexes that may lead to\nmisdiagnosis of ELISA reactions\n160\n.\n\nA research conducted in French Guiana sampled 37 animals (M.\nmusculus) of which two were positive for LCMV by hemi-nested PCR (from\nlung and kidney samples)\n161\n; another inquiry in Argentina reported that 9.4% of the mice collected were\npositive for arenavirus, and the serological rate was 4.6% and 2.6% for men and\nwomen, respectively\n162\n. In Baltimore (USA), 9% of the mice were seropositive for LCMV\n163\n, and 4.7% of the people were analyzed\n164\n. In Brazil, to our knowledge, there are no serological records on the\nprevalence of LCMV in rodents or humans.\n\n\nLassa virus (OW) is endemic in African countries, with\nseroprevalence reaching about 50% of the human population; this disease causes about\n5,000 deaths every year\n165\n. Mastomys natalensis is considered the main reservoir of\nthe virus\n166\n, but it can also be found in Hylomyscus pam\ufb01 and\nMastomys erythroleucus\n\n167\n.\n\nSurveys conducted in Nigeria reported positive animals for Lassa\nvirus in M. natalensis and M.\nerythroleucus, R. rattus\n\n168\n, and M. musculus\n\n169\n. In China, RT-PCRs performed in organs of R. rattus and\nR. norvegicus showed positive rates of 75% and 17%,\nrespectively, and a new viral species, the Wenzhou virus, was\nisolated\n145\n.\n\n\nJunin virus is considered endemic in Argentina\n170\n and sporadic outbreaks have been reported\n171\n. There are several promising vaccinal prototypes being developed for this\nvirus, most are in the preclinical stage\n172\n and one, based on plasmidial DNA, has already reached human test phase\n173\n.\n\nIn Brazil, the most remarkable arenavirus is Sabi\u00e1 virus, reported\nin S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil) in 1994. Initial symptoms were described as flu-like (fever,\nsickness, headaches, and lethargy), quickly leading to hemorrhage and death (within\n3 days)\n154\n\n,\n\n174\n. There have been two reports of this virus, caused by occupational exposure\nin a laboratory environment, one in Par\u00e1 (Brazil) and the other in Connecticut\n(USA), both with non-fatal courses\n175\n\n,\n\n176\n. The 4th case was described in S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil) in 1999\n177\n and the 5th, on January 2020 in Sorocaba (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil)\n178\n as a natural infection with lethal outcome.\n\nA new arenavirus, namely Pinhal virus, has been characterized as a\nNew World arenavirus (line C), first isolated from vesper mice (Calomys\ntener) in S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil), but there is still no evidence that this\nviral strain causes disease to humans\n177\n\n,\n\n179\n. Besides Pinhal virus, other arenaviruses have been\nreported in Brazil: Xapuri virus was recently isolated from rodents\n(Neacomys musseri); Amapar\u00ed virus\n(Neacomys guianae); Cupixi virus\n(Oryzomys megacephalus); Flexal virus\n(unidentified Oryzomyini rodent); Oliveros virus\n(Necromys lasiurus); Latino virus\n(Calomys callosus and Calomys callidus) and\nApor\u00e9 virus (Oligoryzomys mattogrossae)\n180\n.\n\nArenaviruses can be diagnosed using: (a) RT-PCR (fluids, feces, and tissues) followed\nby viral RNA sequencing for differentiation; (b) serology, through detection of\nspecific IgG and IgM employing immunofluorescence and/or ELISA tests; (c) viral\nisolation in cell culture.\n\nRecommended treatment is support therapy that can be combined with the antiviral\nribavirin, which should be administered during the first 7-10 days after infection.\nDespite its efficacy, there are significant side effects, such as hemolytic anemia,\nprogressive weight loss, respiratory difficulty, insomnia, and dermatitis, among\nothers\n180\n\n-\n\n182\n. Alternative drugs with less side effects have been tested, such as\nfavipiravir\n183\n and triarylmethane clotrimazole\n184\n. Cocktails using multiple antiviral drugs that target different steps of the\nviral life cycle appear to be the best strategy to limit viral multiplication with\nlower risk of drug resistance\n185\n.\n\nIn literature we find description of viral rodent-infections, usually from within the\ncontext of biological models or experimentation. In this review, we focus on rodents\nwithin an urban environment, especially R. rattus, R.\nnorvegicus, and M. musculus, although with the\nadvancement of human populations, the interaction with wild rodents increases, and\ndifferent viruses can emerge. There are relatively few studies addressing the\nmonitoring of viruses in these hosts, favoring the occurrence of outbreaks.\n\nControl and preventive activities should go beyond the elimination or reduction of\nthe populations of these hosts and involve sanitary education to aid the human\npopulation in the reduction of shelters for the hosts, the restriction of rodent\naccess to residences, and the reduction of their water and food supply. Basic\nsanitation actions are a generic but effective measure in the reduction of rodents\nand, consequently, the propagation of diseases."}
