In (Table 1) . WTp32 and MAXp32, respectively, showed 5-129 fold and 13-fold increases in IC 50 for ATV, and 6-fold and 10-fold increases in IC 50 for 130 DRV (Table 1) . Although MAXp32 displayed a higher resistance to ATV and DRV 131 than WTp32 (Table1), these differences were not significant (P = 0.4816 and P = The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/315366 doi: bioRxiv preprint compared the frequencies of resistant mutations. For each of the two studied viruses and 137 the two tested drugs, we sequenced between 1.9 \u00d7 10 7 and 4.1 \u00d7 10 7 individual protease 138 nucleotides (Table 2) . Sequence clonal analysis revealed no resistance-associated 139 substitutions in viruses propagated without drugs (Table 3) . On the other hand, both WT 140 and MAX viruses propagated in the presence of PIs developed previously described 141 resistance mutations to ATV and DRV (Table 3) . Moreover, the resistance variant 142 repertoire differed between the MAX and WT viruses (Table 3) . Specifically, the G16E (Table 2) , was also included in this analysis. We found that the five generated mutants 165 displayed comparable IC 50 values to ATV in both backgrounds, WT and MAX (Table   166 3). We also determined the replication capacity of these two ten mutant viruses in MT-4 167 cells with and without ATV (Fig. 2) . Similar to the IC50 results, the five tested variants The amino acid mutant repertoire also differed between the WT and MAX 176 viruses when they were propagated without drugs (Table 2) . Only one variant, D30N, 177 was detected in both virus populations. We do not know whether the observed variants 178 are adaptive or neutral mutations. Regardless, completely different mutant spectra were 179 detected in these two viruses. 180 We performed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction of all WT and 181 MAX unique amino acid variants that were recovered after 32 MT-4 cell passages in the 182 presence of ATV or DRV. Remarkably, the results showed that the two viruses, which 183 shared an identical starting amino acid sequence, followed different evolutionary 184 trajectories (Fig. 3) .

However, with regards to other mutations, the explanation 237 for the difference is not readily apparent (e.g., S37P, G48L, Q58E and I84V). In 238 particular, the G48L substitution is very rarely selected in vivo in patients undergoing PI 239 therapy (37). However, when the above substitutions (S37P, G48L, Q58E, I84V or 240 L89I) were introduced in the WT sequence they showed parallel replication capacities 241 to those observed with a MAX background. We can speculate that the introduced 242 synonymous substitutions affected neighboring residues (e.g., RNA structure).\n\nHowever, it must be noted that the MAX and WT proteases have similar RNA folding 244 free energy (10).

Synonymous codons differ in their propensity to mutate and, as previously 260 suggested (25, 32, 42), this differential access to protein sequence space may affect 261 adaptive pathways.\n\nAnother intriguing finding of our study is that the MAX virus showed higher The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/315366 doi: bioRxiv preprint exponential growth phase using maximum likelihood methods as previously described 309 (10).
