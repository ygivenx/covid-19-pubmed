{"title": "LETTER TO THE EDITOR DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF RESPIRATORY VIRUSES BY USING REAL TIME RT-PCR METHODOLOGY", "body": "The emergence of new respiratory viruses including: the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; the coronavirus in 2003 (SARS-CoV); influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, in the human population in the past ten years; the emergence of a new coronavirus identified in a patient presenting severe acute respiratory syndrome who travelled to Saudi Arabia (June, 2012), denominated as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV); and laboratory confirmation of three human infections with an avian influenza A(H7N9) virus not previously reported in humans on March 29, 2013, has encouraged scientists to develop diagnostic tests to identify these viruses 1,2,3,4 . The Adolfo Lutz, a Public Health Institute, has been improving its methodology tools in order to provide a timely answer to public health authorities facing acute respiratory disease outbreaks.\n\nTo apply the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Real Time RT-PCR as respiratory viruses' differential diagnosis in clinical specimens, a total of 252 respiratory secretions were collected from patients presenting influenza-like syndrome by the three Brazilian National Influenza Surveillance Network -Sentinel Units: Hospital Menino Jesus; Hospital Vila Maria; Hospital Geral de Guarulhos; during influenza season 2010. These samples presented negative results for influenza virus A(H1N1), A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B strains by CDC rRT-PCR ; and were also proven negative by differential diagnosis by the use of respiratory monoclonal panel to investigate: influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus and parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 viruses by Indirect Immunofluorescence (IFI). The differential diagnosis in samples presenting negative results, by both methodologies, was submitted to the CDC Real RT-PCR containing primers and probes for adenovirus (ADV), rhinovirus (RVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV ), parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 4(PV1, PV2, PV3, PV4), kindly provided by Dr. Dean Erdman. Of the 252 clinical specimens presenting negative results by using differential monoclonal respiratory panel IFI, 60 (23.80%) were positive by Real Time RT-PCR, the following etiologic agents have been identified: RSV 20 (33.40%); PV1 3 (5%); PV2 7 (11.60%); PV3 9 (15%) RVs 10 (16.60%); ADV 11 (18.40%).\n\nThis study demonstrates the high sensitivity of Real Time RT-PCR in respiratory differential diagnosis, by the National Influenza Surveillance Network, sponsored by Brazilian Ministry of Health.\n\nIn addition, fast, accurate and sensitive detection of respiratory viruses in clinical specimens through the use of this methodology would also increase our understanding of the epidemiology of both new emerging viruses such as influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, and conventional viruses such as the common cold viruses, including rhinovirus and coronavirus.\n\nTaking into account the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, successful measures of prevention and control of the disease can be warranted as soon as the etiology of the disease is revealed.
