{"title": "The mixed trunsored model with applications to SARS", "body": "WHO reports Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak as shown in [38, 39] . During almost a month from 21 February the SARS virus spread without isolation of probable patients. Taking into account of the short incubation period which is estimated as 5-8 days (see [23] ), it appears that the virus raged for more than a month without prevention. The number of probable patients appeared to grow exponentially in this period, and then the control of the human-to-human chain of transmission of the disease suppressed the growth rate of spreading. It may be considered that only one seed made a typical epidemic growth curve of the disease spread. Our concern is first what the appropriate probability distribution for the curve is; the logistic, the log-normal, the gamma, or the Weibull distribution may be fitted to the data provided by WHO [37] .\n\nAs SARS showed a severe case fatality ratio (abbreviated CFR here, but other terms such as case fatality rate in Refs. [7, 41, 42] or mortality rate in Ref. [20] are also used), our second concern is to know the ratio as soon as possible after the outbreak began. Since WHO opens the numbers of probable cases and the fatal cases to the public day by day, we can estimate the CFR by some censoring time T using the conditional likelihoods for both the probable and fatal cases; this approach is considered to be the truncated model approach. However, WHO, in addition to these two data cases, gave us the recovery (or cured) cases, which would be the fruitful information for the parameter estimation of the underlying probability distributions; we can also estimate the CFR using the probable and cured cases. We propose here a new estimation method for the parameters of the underlying distributions and the CFR using the three data sets of probable, fatal, and cured cases together. The trunsored model approach (Hirose [16, 18] ) can do this, but the traditional truncated model approach cannot.\n\nThe objective of the introduction of the trunsored model was to do hypothesis tests easily (Hirose [16, 18] ). This purpose may also be realized in our situation that we use the three data sets together. However, we do not go deeply into such a direction in this paper; we introduce the estimation methods of the underlying probability distribution parameters and of the CFR.\n\nIn some lifetime estimation problems, short-term survivors and long-term survivors are mixed: for example, Boag [3] , Farewell [10] , and Goldman [11] discussed the proportion of patients cured by a particular treatment; Anscombe [1] treated market penetration; Maltz and McCleary [27] , and Steinhurst [32] discussed recidivism; Meeker [28] and Hirose [16, 18] applied the model to integrated circuit reliability. Maller and Zhou [26] , Zhou and Maller [43] , Sun and Zhou [33] , Vu et al. [35] , Peng et al. [30] discussed the model as long-term survivors. Tsodikov et al. recently review the cure rates [34] . In such cases, r events within T are observed from n samples, but the ratio, p m , of the long-term survivors to the mixed populations is unknown. If n is unknown, the truncated model (e.g. Johnson et al. [22] , Meeker and Escobar [29] , Wallace et al. [36] , and Klein and Moeschberger [24] ) could be applied. However, the information n may be useful in our situation; one of the advantages to adopt this kind of model is described as the application of the likelihood ratio test in Hirose [16, 18] .\n\nThe epidemiological determinants of spread of SARS can be dealt with as the probabilistic growth curve models [25] , and the parameter estimation procedure for the probabilistic growth curve models may similarly be treated as the lifetime analysis [17] . Thus, we try to do the parameter estimation to the SARS cases for the infected cases, fatal cases, and cured cases here, as we usually do it in the lifetime analysis. To estimate the CFR caused by SARS, the truncated model approach using the infected and fatal growth curves may be fine. However, the recovery rate by the same approach using the infected and cured growth curves may not be consistent with the CFR obtained by using the infected and fatal cases. Thus, the truncated approach cannot have such consistency. A new approach proposed here, the mixed trunsored model, can have, however. Donnelly et al. [7] computed the CFR with the admission-to-death and admission-to-discharge distributions, but the proposed method shown here used the infected case distribution in addition.\n\nWe define a cumulative probability distribution function, H(t; \u03c8), which is a linear combination of F (t; \u03b8) and G(t; \u03c6) given by:\n\nwith a combination parameter s, and the corresponding pdf, h(t; \u03c8), for H is also defined\n\nThen, the likelihood function for the combined model can be expressed in the form:\n\nwhere t i denotes the observed times that events occurred. If we assume that the censoring time, T, is smaller than the left endpoint, T 0 , of G(t) such that:\n\ni.e. G implies the long-term survivors, then L(\u03c8) \u2192 L ts (\u03b8, s), where\n\nThis is the likelihood for the trunsored model in Hirose [16, 18] . For the sake of comparison, we define two additional likelihood functions for the censored model and the truncated model as:\n\nWe consider cumulative probability distribution functions, F j (j = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , J), with trunsored likelihoods such that:\n\nunder the restriction that\n\nwhere n j (j = 1, . . . , J) are the number of samples, and r j (j = 1, . . . , J) are the number of observed events. If restriction (9) is not imposed, the likelihood equations in (8) can be solved independently; with the restriction, however, we need to solve the likelihood equations simultaneously. In SARS applications, F 1 , F 2 , and F 3 may correspond to the infected case, fatal case, and cured case growth curves, respectively; restriction (9) implies that the probable cases are divided into exactly two categories: the fatal and the recovered cases as in following equation:\n\nThen, we can estimate the parameters, s j and \u03b8 j , by maximizing the likelihood function for the mixed trunsored model:\n\nIf the time of event is not observed and the number of events in some period, e.g. from T i to T i+1 , are observed instead, we consider the grouped data model such that:\n\nIn SARS case, T i to T i+1 may be 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days.\n\nWe consider four typical probability distribution models for the growth curves: the generalized logistic distribution (GL) [40] , the extended log-normal distribution (ELN) [14] , the extended gamma distribution (EGM) [13] , and the generalized extreme-value distribution (GEV) [12] , to allow the negative and positive skewness in the distribution functions [15] ; the number of parameters are three including the location parameter.\n\nThe logistic distribution with two parameter is often used as the growth model because this distribution is derived from the differential equation for the biological models; the generalized logistic curve [40] , also known as Richards' curve [31] , is a widely-used and flexible function for growth modeling by including the shape parameter in the model. The probability density function and the cumulative distribution function for GL are expressed by:\n\nThis distribution is negatively skewed when \u03b2 < 1, and is positively skewed when \u03b2 > 1. It is symmetric when \u03b2 = 1, as is known to two parameter logistic distribution. As mentioned in Section 1, probabilistic growth curves of the spread of SARS fitted to the infected cases, fatal cases, and cured cases can similarly be treated to the lifetime distributions, we deal with three typical probability distribution models used in the lifetime analysis [17] . The density functions for ELN, EGM, and GEV are expressed by:\n\nwith\n\nThese three distribution models are the extension models from the log-normal (LN), gamma (GM), and Weibull (WB) distributions, respectively, with densities:\n\nWHO opened the daily number of probable cases from 17 March 2003 to 11 July 2003, to the public [37] ; on 26 September 2003, summary of probable SARS cases with onset of illness from 1 November 2002 to 31 July 2003, is additionally opened. As mentioned earlier, the outbreak began by only one seed in Hong Kong; the growth curves for infected cases, fatal cases, and cured cases in Hong Kong are smooth and natural comparing to those in other districts such as China, Taiwan and Canada; for example in Canada, two successive asynchronous outbreaks occurred. Here, we deal with a rather simple case such as the case in Hong Kong as a primary analysis. The data used in this paper are taken from [37] ; they are the cumulative numbers of infected patients, deaths, and recovered persons from 17 March 2003 to 11 July 2003; see also [19] in detail.\n\nTo find the most appropriate probability distribution model in the four models introduced previously, we first fit the four models to SARS data for the infected, fatal, and cured cases. Using the truncated model of (7) with censoring time on 11 July 2003, the maximum values of the log-likelihood functions are obtained as shown in Table 1 , resulting that the generalized logistic model has the largest likelihood values for the infected, fatal, and cured cases. The difference of the likelihood values between the log-normal and the gamma is not so large; however, the difference between the generalized logistic and the gamma and that between the generalized logistic and the Weibull are significantly large. This assists the use of the generalized logistic distribution as the SARS dynamic, which is suggested in [44] without justification. We use the generalized logistic model from now on.\n\nThe estimated cumulative probability distribution functions of the generalized logistic distribution and the empirical distribution functions for the patients, fatal, and cured cases are shown in Fig. 1 ; circles, triangles, and squares in the figure express the empirical functions for patients, fatal, and cured cases, respectively, and the dashed lines are estimated distribution functions. It appears that the shapes of the three probability distribution functions are almost the same; only the location parameter seems to be different. We therefore may assume that the shape and scale parameters for these three distributions are the same; under such an assumption, the maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters in (13) and (14) Table 1 . Here, we use the notation of \u03b8 j = (\u03c3, \u03bb, \u03bc j ) T .\n\nThe observed numbers of the patients and deaths are considered to be grouped (day by day) and right truncated. By computing both the total expected numbers of patients and deaths, it seems that we can estimate the CFR as shown below, but the estimate seems to be questionable.\n\nUsing the truncated model likelihood to the infected patients, we can estimate the total number of patients, m 1 , in the future. If the estimated parameter is\u03b8 1 , thenm 1 can be estimated by: Based on data as of the 11 June 2003, and using the truncated model. \n\nwhere, T 1 is the censoring time. Similarly, the total number of fatal cases,m 2 , and the total number of cured cases,m 3 , are also calculated easily, if parameters,\u03b8 2 and\u03b8 3 , are obtained. The CFR, p f , and the case survival ratio (abbreviated CSR here), p s , are estimated by:\n\nwhere the CSR is defined by the number of survivors divided by the number of patients in this paper. As mentioned above, the best fit probability distribution model is the generalized logistic distribution, thus we may obtain the CFR by applying the truncated models with the generalized logistic distribution to the infected and fatal cases. When we set the censoring time, T = T 1 = T 2 , on 11 July 2003, and we suppose that the scale and shape parameters are the same for patients, deaths, and recoveries, then we can obtain the estimates,m 1 = 1755.71 andm 2 = 298.66; thus, the CFR,p f , becomes 17.01%. If we use the estimate of the total number of cured cases,m 3 = 1436.17, then the CSRp s = 81.80% (i.e.p f = 18.20%) is obtained. Here, these two ratios under the truncated model approach are obtained by solving the simultaneous likelihood equations:\n\nwhere \u03b8 j = (\u03c3, \u03bb, \u03bc j ) T because we supposed that \u03c3 j = \u03c3, \u03bb j = \u03bb (j = 1, 2, 3); the number of unknown parameters are five (\u03c3, \u03bb, \u03bc 1 , \u03bc 2 , \u03bc 3 ). However, the sum of the CFR, obtained by using the fatal and infected cases, and the CSR, obtained by using the cured and infected cases, is not equal to 1. If we set the censoring time on 25 May 2003, this discrepancy becomes markedly large; we obtainm 1 = 1740.23,m 2 = 278.90, andm 3 = 1346.46, then the estimated CFR and the CSR are,p f = 16.03% andp s = 77.37%. It would be crucial to get rid of this inconsistency even in earlier stages, i.e. the censoring time is earlier.\n\nUsing the bootstrap method [8, 9] with 1,000 resampling, we can obtain the confidence interval for the CFR. When we set the censoring time on 25 May 2003, the 95% confidence interval for the CFR is computed as 13.60% \u2264 p f \u2264 17.40%. This value seems to be acceptable. If the censoring time is set to the right far enough, e.g. on 11 July 2003, however, the estimated number of patients,m 1 = 1755.71, and the estimated number of deaths,m 2 = 298.66, become very close to the observed numbers of patients, 1755, and deaths, 298, by that time; in other resampling cases, the results are much the same. Then, the 95% confidence interval for the CFR is computed as 16.90% \u2264 p f \u2264 17.09%. Such very small confidence intervals are also reported elsewhere [6] . After the outbreaks are completely ceased, e.g. based on data as of the 31 Assuming that the CFR of SARS is supposed to be some constant value, then the number of deaths would be varied by chance. The CFRs in various districts could be fluctuated, but they would be covered by some interval, say [0.1, 0.2]. This is the reason why I think that the very small confidence intervals obtained by using the truncated model are paradoxical.\n\nBased on the truncated model, inconsistent estimates for the CFR and paradoxical confidence intervals are computed. To circumvent these flaws, we next use the proposed method, the mixed trunsored model.\n\nAll the patients are divided exactly into two categories: fatal cases and cured cases. This means that p f + p s = 1. This restriction cannot be imposed to the truncated model approach straightforwardly. The trunsored model approach using (8)- (12) , however, can do this; we only need to impose the restriction that s 3 = s 1 \u2212 s 2 . The CFR and the CSR are calculated by:\n\nSetting n j (j = 1, 2, 3) to some numbers, e.g., the actual population in Hong Kong (this is about 6,810,000 persons in 2003 [4] ), the estimated parameters, under the assumption that \u03c3 j = \u03c3 (j = 1, 2, 3) and \u03bb j = \u03bb (j = 1, 2, 3), ar\u00ea \u03c3 = 12.560,\u03bb = 3.2708,\u03bc 1 = 3.9911,\u03bc 2 = 25.310,\u03bc 3 = 25.337,p f = 1 \u2212p s = 17.30%, and the corresponding log-likelihood value is \u221246, 577 when we set the censoring time on 11 July 2003. If we set the censoring time on 25 May 2003, the CFR is computed asp f = 17.16%, which is almost the same value as that when the censoring time is 11 July 2003. The values of the estimates,\u015d j (j = 1, 2, 3), are not important by themselves; they change their values by setting n j (j = 1, 2, 3) to other values, butp f andp s are hardly affected by these values.\n\nThe CFR under the mixed trunsored model approach with seven (\u03c3, \u03bb, \u03bc 1 , \u03bc 2 , \u03bc 3 , s 1 , s 2 ) unknown parameters are shown in Fig. 2 when we vary the censoring time T. The estimated value of the CFR at time t (day) in the figure means that the estimate is obtained under the assumption that the censoring time T is equal to t. In the truncated model, the CFRs are obtained by two estimates: one is by using the numbers of the patients and deaths, and the other is by using the the numbers of the patients and recoveries. In Fig. 2 , these two CFRs under the truncated model approach are also shown. We can see that the estimated CFRs in the mixed trunsored model keep almost a constant value in a wide range of censoring time, while the CFRs in the truncated model do not, as mentioned above.\n\nThe 95% confidence intervals for the estimates of the CFR using the bootstrap method are computed as 15.51% \u2264 p f \u2264 19.13% and 13.73% \u2264 p f \u2264 19. considered to be reasonable and acceptable; see the next section. These values are also consistent with the results in [21] . The histogram of the bootstrapped estimates for the CFR, when the censoring time is on 11 July 2003, is shown in Fig. 3 . The frequency distributions of the bootstrapped estimates for the CFRs at various censoring times are shown in Fig. 4 . We can see that the confidence interval of the CFR at earlier estimating stage, e.g. 70th day from 17 March 2003, i.e. 25 May 2003, is wider than that at the final stage, but they are not so different from each other.\n\nThe confidence intervals for the CFR are obtained under the assumption that n j = 6, 810, 000 (j = 1, 2, 3); other values of n j (j = 1, 2, 3) will provide different confidence intervals, but the confidence intervals are not affected much as long as the values of n j (j = 1, 2, 3) are not so small. For example, using n j = 681, 000 (j = 1, 2, 3), the 95% confidence intervals for the CFR are computed as 15.52% \u2264 p f \u2264 19.11% and 13.64% \u2264 p f \u2264 19.20% when the censoring time is set to on 11 July 2003, and on 25 May 2003, respectively. \n\nThe variance of a ratio X/Y is approximately obtained by:\n\nwhere X and Y are random variables [2] . We assume that X = s 2 and Y = s 1 . When the censoring time is late enough, then E(X) and E(Y ) become s 2 and s 1 , and Var(X) and Var(Y ) become approximately s 2 (1 \u2212 s 2 )/n 2 and s 1 (1 \u2212 s 1 )/n 1 . (26) is approximately reduced to: In various infected districts, approximate CFRs and their 95% confidence intervals are computed by (27) ; they are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 5 . In the figure, the solid and dashed lines express the 95% confidence intervals when \u03c1 = 0 and when \u03c1 = 1, respectively. A very rough interval for the CFR, [12, 18] %, includes points in the 95% confidence Fig. 5 . Estimated case fatality ratios and their approximate 95% confidence intervals. Solid line, when correlation coefficient between numbers of patients and deaths = 0; dashed line, when correlation coefficient between numbers of patients and deaths = 1; a band [12, 18] % includes points in 95% confidence intervals in Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Vietnam. intervals of Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Vietnam, but does not include points in the 95% confidence interval of China. According to [37] , 325 cases have been discarded in Taiwan since 11 July 2003 because Laboratory information was insufficient or incomplete for 135 discarded cases, of which 101 died. World-wide, the CFR of about 9.6% (including Chinese cases) has been announced by media. However, this estimate should be treated cautiously; this is caused mainly by the Chinese CFR, and this value, about 6.6%, is very different from those in other countries. There would be reasons for such a very different value of the CFR. One reason would be that Chinese infected cases were counted circumspectly. However, a noticeable reference is also seen (see [5] ), in which Chinese medicine is found to improve the case survival rate in the treatment of SARS. In any case, it would be appropriate that the SARS CFR is estimated without the Chinese case if we consider the safety side. In such a case, it is roughly estimated to be about 12-18%, worldwide.\n\nThe epidemiological determinants of spread of SARS can be dealt with as the probabilistic growth curve models, and the parameter estimation procedure for the probabilistic growth curve models may similarly be treated as the lifetime analysis. Thus, we try to do the parameter estimation to the SARS cases for the infected cases, fatal cases, and cured cases, here, as we usually do it in the lifetime analysis. The estimated epidemiological determinants of spread of SARS, fitted to the infected, fatal, and cured cases, can be modeled by the generalized logistic distribution function. The truncated data model approach using the infected and fatal cases can estimate the case fatality ratio of the disease, but it also estimates the case fatality ratio using the numbers of the patients and recoveries; these estimates differ from each other in early censoring time stage. To circumvent this inconsistency, and to obtain reasonable estimates, the mixed trunsored model, which is an extension of the censored and truncated unified model, is found to be useful in estimating the case fatality ratio of SARS, when we use the data of the patients, deaths, and recoveries together. Using the proposed method, it would be appropriate that the SARS case fatality ratio is roughly estimated to be about 12-18% worldwide, if we consider the safety side without the Chinese case. Unlike the questionably small confidence intervals for the case fatality ratio using the truncated models, the case fatality ratio in the proposed model provides a reasonable confidence interval."}
