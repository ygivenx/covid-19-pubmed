{"title": "Supplementary information S1 | Viral pseudoknots", "body": "The (most 5') PK may stack onto an upstream stem-loop and bring PK adjacent to 5' terminal VpG moiety Martin and Palmenberg, 1996 Nateri et al., 2002 Nagashima et al., 2005 Tomato bushy stunt virus (Tombusviridae) PK present at 5\u2032 end of genome. Loop 3 contains substructures Essential for replication. PK links the T-shaped domain at the extreme 5' end with a downstream domain and is adjacent to a region involved in genome circularisation Ray et al., 2004 Translation/ IRES Hepatitis C-virus-like (HCV, CSFV, BVDV, PTV-1) (Flaviviridae) PK present at the bottom of a long IRES domain (III).\n\nIndeed, domain III forms loop 1 of these complex PKs. Loops 2 and 3 are very short, although some flexibility of loop 3 length documented Role in IRES activity/recruitment of 40S. HCV IRES binds to rpS5 -may have role in conformational switch to facilitate proper positioning of AUG in P-site Wang et al., 1995 Fletcher et al., 2002 Grassman et al., 2005 Chard et al., 2006 Fraser and Doudna, 2007 Cricket paralysis virus-like (CrPV, PSIV, RhPV) (Dicistroviridae) Three closely associated PKs form the IRES. PKIII is nested in PKII. Complex fold via intra-and inter-PK interactions. PKI may mimic tRNA Role in factor-independent recruitment of ribosome and first translocation step. PK folding informed by recent X-ray and cryo-EM studies Wilson et al., 2000 Jan and Sarnow, 2002 Pestova et al., 2004 Spahn et al., 2004 Schuler et al., 2006 Pfingsten et al., 2006 Hellen, 2007 Giardia lamblia virus (Totiviridae) Unusual IRES that extends well into coding region has two PKs. In 5' UTR, a coaxially-stacked H-type PK is present with a short loop 3. The PK in the coding region has relatively short stems (6bp), but a longer loop 3 containing substructures Both PKs are involved in IRES function. Upstream PK plays a role in both translation and mRNA stability Wang, 2002 Garlapati and Wang, 2005 Tobacco etch virus (Potyviridae) Run of short H-type PKs with short loops Reminiscent of PKs of FMDV and UPDs of TMV. L3 of PK1 has complementarity to 18S rRNA. PK1 also binds eIF4G, relevant to translational initiation mechanism of the uncapped genome Zeenko and Gallie, 2005 Ray et al., 2006 Translational autoregulation T-even bacteriophage (Myoviridae) Short H-type PK with coaxially-stacked stems. L1 is a single nucleotide in length PK binds to gene 32 product. PK may also stabilise mRNA. Some similarities to viral frameshift-promoting pseudoknots McPheeters et al., 1988 Shamoo et al., 1993 Du and Hoffmann, 1997 Genome coding region PK may interfere with ribosomal helicase activity, compromising ribosome function Giedroc et al., 2000 Brierley & Pennell, 2001 Plant et al., 2003 Baranov et al., 2006 Dreher and Miller, 2006 Namy et al., 2006 Translation: +1 ribosomal frameshifting Listeria monocytogenes phage PSA\n\nUnconfirmed short H-type PK PK may stimulate +1 frameshifting in association with a \"shifty-stop\". Some similarity to the +1 frameshift signal of human antizyme (see Supplementary Table 2 ) Zimmer et al., 2003 Translation: readthrough Murine leukemia virus (Gammaretroviruses) Short, H-type PK. Some primary sequence requirements within L3 PK may act by modulation of ribosome-release factor interaction Wills et al., 1991 Feng et al., 1992 Wills et al., 1994 Alam et al., 1999 In format provided by Brierley et al. HIV-1 PK is bent at the stem-stem junction and a potent inhibitor of RT (see main text) Tuerk et al., 1992 Chaloin et al., 2002 Kim and Jeong, 2003 Held et al., 2006 In format provided by Brierley et al.
