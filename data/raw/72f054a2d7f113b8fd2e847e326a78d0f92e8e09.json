{"title": "Murine hepatitis virus-A model for virus-induced CNS demyelination", "body": "in weanling mice compared to adult mice (Weiner, 1973) . Most studies are performed on 4-to 6-weekold mice.\n\nBoth MHV-A59 and JHM infect, to some extent, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes (Lavi et al, 1987; Stohlman et al, 1995a) , neurons (Parra et al, 1997; Lavi et al, 1999) , hepatocytes (Weiner, 1973; Navas et al, 2001) , macrophages, including Kuppfer cells (Even et al, 1995; Stohlman et al, 1995a) , thymic epithelial cells (Knobler and Oldstone, 1987; Godfraind et al, 1995) , and the endothelial cells which line blood vessels (Joseph et al, 1995; Lavi et al, 1999) . MHV-A59 has also been shown to infect B cells (Coutelier et al, 1994) , and MHV-JHM has been detected in ependymal cells (Stohlman et al, 1995a) . Except for glial cells and neurons, these cell populations closely match those demonstrated to express the known MHV receptor Bgp1a (biliary glycoprotein 1a), a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family, which in turn is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Williams et al, 1991) . The Bgp1a receptor has been identi ed on hepatocytes, macrophages, epithelial cells (such as those in the intestine), endothelial cells, B cells, and a small proportion of thymic epithelial cells (Williams et al, 1991) . A major determinant of tropism is the spike (S) protein (Phillips et al, 1999; Navas et al, 2001) , suggesting that variations in MHV receptor (such as posttranslational modi cations or expression of different isoforms) may affect recognition by different\n\nInfectious MHV can be found in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons after acute infection . Late after infection, virus is detectable only as low levels of antigen or RNA (Lavi et al, 1984b) . In animals with viral persistence due to the absence of IFN-\u00b0, antigen is detected mainly in oligodendrocytes (Parra et al, 1999) . In mice infected in the presence of protective maternal antibody, antigen persists in astrocytes as well as other unidenti ed cells (Perlman and Ries, 1987) . These studies demonstrate that virus can persist in glial cells.\n\nAfter intracerebral (i.c.) or intranasal (i.n.) infection with MHV-A59, virus enters the brain and causes encephalitis . Intranasal infection with MHV-JHM or -A59 leads to viral invasion through the olfactory bulb and along olfactory tracts, as well as a slower approach along the trigeminal nerve to the mesencephalic nucleus Perlman et al, 1989) . Early spread of i.) appears to be along speci c neural pathways in the CNS (Perlman et al, 1989 ) and, therefore, through neural connections. Later widespread infection can be blocked by passive transfer of antibody, suggesting spread through the blood, cerebrospinal uid, and/or interstitial uid (Perlman et al, 1989) . Liver infection can occur after any route of infection (i.n., i.c., i.g., or i.p.) with MHV-A59 . MHV-A59 liver titers peak 5 dpi after i.c. infection (Lavi et al, 1984b) and hepatitis develops during the rst 1 to 2 weeks . MHV-JHM replicates transiently in the lungs, blood, and cervical lymph nodes after i.n. infection, and occasionally is found in the thymus and bone marrow (Barthold and Smith, 1992) .\n\nAs would be expected in an infection that comes under immunological control, viral titers peak around 5 d.p.i. in the brain (Parra et al, 1997) , slightly later in the spinal cord (Matthews et al, 2001) , and virus is cleared by 8-20 d.p.i. (Sutherland et al, 1997) . The kinetics of viral antigen expression follow a pattern similar to that observed of viral titers during acute infection (Wang et al, 1992) , but viral antigen is still detectable up to 30 d.p.i. (Lavi et al, 1984a) . Viral RNA is detectable in the brain as late as 10-12 months postinfection, although the amount of RNA decreases with time (Lavi et al, 1984a) . However, immunosuppression of cell-mediated immunity by drugs, radiation, or T-cell depletion at late time points after infection does not result in viral recrudescence from this RNA pool (Stohlman and Weiner, 1981) .\n\nThe blood-brain barrier is a major factor of the CNS that limits immune function by preventing the easy entry of serum antibodies and infectious organisms in the absence of CNS in ammation (Cserr et al, 1992) . Although it has been thought that the blood-brain barrier allows the entry of only activated T cells, a recent study demonstrated that naive T cells can enter the CNS if there are few activated T cells in circulation (Brabb et al, 2000) .\n\nIt has been suggested that immunosuppressive cytokines such as transforming growth factor-beta, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) may limit or alter immune function within the CNS (Gordon et al, 1998; Lipton and Gonzales-Scarano , 1978) . Work with T cells responding to Sindbis virus infection of the CNS demonstrated that T cells lose their ability to proliferate and down-regulate IL-2 production after entering the brain, supporting the hypothesis that the environment of the CNS alters immune function (Irani et al, 1997) . In addition, the brain fosters viral antigen or nucleic acid persistence, which is not observed in most peripheral organs and seems to be attributable at least in some instances to inhibited immunemediated clearance (Kristensson and Norrby, 1986) . The poor regenerative potential of neurons and the sensitivity of the CNS to small lesions may have contributed to the development of a CNS environment which downregulates the more destructive aspects of the immune response.\n\nThe cells of the immune system successfully enter the CNS after MHV infection. Mononuclear cells of bone marrow origin peak 7 d.p.i. They then decline, even in animals that do not control the infection (Williamson et al, 1991) . In the absence of T cells in nude mice, infectious MHV-JHM is not cleared with normal kinetics (Houtman and Fleming, 1996) , demonstrating that T cells are important for clearance of MHV.\n\nCD8 C T cell response to MHV CD8 C T cells are critical for the early control of MHV infection in the CNS and for prevention of mortality (Gombold et al, 1995; Stohlman et al, 1995b; Sutherland et al, 1997) . Virus-speci c CD8 C T cells peak 7 days after MHV infection in the brain (Williamson et al, 1991) . The ability to detect MHV speci c CD8 C T cells in the draining cervical lymph nodes (CLN) or the spleen varies Parra et al, 1999) . This variability may be due to differences in the speci c injection sites. Virus delivered to the parenchyma results in a delayed peripheral immune response compared to virus delivered to the ventricles and cerebrospinal uid (Stevenson et al, 1997) .\n\nCD8 C T cells recognize peptides presented on cell surface MHC class I molecules. Although neurons do not express MHC class I and therefore are not anticipated targets of CD8 C T cells, MHC class I is present on endothelial cells and microglia (Horwitz et al, 1999) . In addition, class I expression can be induced in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in culture if exposed to factors secreted by cells infected with MHV-A59 (Suzumura et al, 1986) . After MHV-A59 infection of CD8 C T-cell-de cient mice, viral antigen clearance was delayed in microglia, lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and meningeal cells but not in neurons or glia . In another study, transfer of CD8 C T cells suppressed MHV-JHM antigen expression in astrocytes and microglia but not oligodendrocytes (Stohlman et al, 1995a) .\n\nCD8 C T cells can function through the lytic molecule perforin, through apoptosis induced by Fas ligand (FasL), or by secreting cytokines such as IFNgamma and TNF-alpha (Kajino et al, 1998) . All of these mechanisms may be productively used in the immune response to MHV. In the CNS of mice decient for perforin, viral clearance is delayed, thereby implicating a role for perforin in viral control . Ef cient viral clearance in Fas-de cient mice demonstrated that FasL-mediated lysis is not required for viral clearance. Nonetheless, mice lacking both FasL-mediated apoptosis and perforin have delayed clearance compared to mice just lacking perforin, suggesting that Fas-FasL interactions can contribute to viral control although they may not be very important (Parra et al, 2000) .\n\nBoth CD4 C and CD8 C T cells persist in the CNS for up to 34 d.p.i., with CD8 C T cells being more prominent in the parenchyma both early and late after infection (Stohlman et al, 1998a) . The number of CD8 C T cells decreases with time and decreasing viral RNA Marten et al, 2000) . At 45 d.p.i., about 48% of these cells are still virus-speci c, similar to the percentage of virus-speci c T cells observed during acute infection. Many of these chronically present cells secrete IFN-gamma, but cytolytic activity is gradually lost .\n\nAlthough activated , MHV-speci c, CD8 C T cells transferred to infected mice can control viral replication, they are not suf cient to clear infectious virus from oligodendrocytes (Stohlman et al, 1998b) . The presence of CD4 C T cells is necessary for transferred CD8 C T cell protection. Indeed, these cells appear to be important for CD8 C T-cell lytic activity and survival in the CNS, perhaps through the secretion of IL-2 (Stohlman et al, 1998b) . Virally activated CD4 C T cells protect against lethal viral infections after transfer, but as with transferred CD8 C T cells, they are not suf cient to clear the virus (Stohlman et al, 1986) . Depletion of either CD8 C or CD4 C T cells results in the inability of mice to control acute viral titers in the brain (Williamson et al, 1990; Sutherland et al, 1997) . Thus, both CD4 C and CD8 C T cells are important for control of acute viral infection in the CNS.\n\nUnlike CD8 C T cells, which accumulate in the parenchyma, CD4 C T cells tend to accumulate perivascularly and in subarachnoid spaces (Stohlman et al, 1998a) , locations rich in MHC class II positive macrophages and microglia (Hickey and Kimura, 1988; Braun et al, 1993) . Interestingly, CD4 C T cell numbers peak in the CNS at 9 d.p.i., a little later than CD8 C T cells (Williamson et al, 1991) , and persist in the CNS after viral clearance Marten et al, 2000) .\n\nThe effector function of many lymphocytes involves the production and secretion of cytokines. mRNA from a wide number of in ammatory cytokines can be detected in the brain 3-7 days following i.c. infection with MHV-JHM. These include interferon (IFN) alpha and beta (Wang et al, 1998) , interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-2, and TNF-alpha (Parra et al, 1997) . Immuno uorescence of MHV-JHM infected spinal cords demonstrated the presence of TNF-alpha protein as well as IL-1 beta and IL-6 in cells with the morphology of macrophages early after infection and in uninfected astrocytes late after infection .\n\nBoth Th1 (IFN-gamma) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) cytokine mRNAs increase after infection with various strains of MHV, peaking 7 to 9 days after MHV-JHM infection (Stohlman et al, 1995a; Parra et al, 1997) . In several studies MHV infection resulted in a predominantly IgG2a antibody isotype pro le (Coutelier et al, 1987; Fleming et al, 1989) supporting the idea of a predominantly Th1 response, although in another study IgG2a did not predominate over IgG1 (Parra et al, 1997) . These data, combined with the presence of both Th1 and Th2 cytokine mRNAs, suggest that neither T-helper cell type necessarily predominates, although a Th1 pro le is slightly more common. MHV-JHM infection of mice de cient for IFN-gamma revealed that IFN-gamma is not required for optimal antibody production or for CTL responses. IFN-gamma is, however, necessary for clearance of virus from the oligodendrocytes (Parra et al, 1999) . Clearance of an MHV strain that primarily infects neurons is delayed in the absence of IFN-gamma, suggesting that it may affect viral control in other cell types as well without being absolutely required for clearance (Lane et al, 1997) . In mice decient for IL-10, MHV-JHM causes a transient increase in viral titers 7 d.p.i. and greater mortality than in wild-type mice despite normal kinetics of viral clearance, which is thought to be due to an increase in in ammatory cytokines (Lin et al, 1998) .\n\nThe role of B cells in the control of MHV has been studied in rats and mice. In Lewis rats, the transfer of B cells into irradiated recipients decreased MHV-JHM titers in the CNS (Schwender et al, 1999) . IgM, the rst detectable antibody isotype, rst appears 6 d.p.i. with MHV-JHM i.c. in mice (Stohlman et al, 1986; Williamson et al, 1991) . Neutralizing antibodies are detected in the serum by 9 d.p.i. with MHV-JHM given i.c., but were not suf cient to control viral titers within 11 d.p.i. in the absence of CD8 C T cells . Similarly, after MHV-A59 infection, serum antibody is detectable 7 d.p.i. and reaches maximal levels 14-56 d.p.i. (Lavi et al, 1984b) . By electron microscopy, plasma cells can be observed in the CNS as late as 90 d.p.i. with MHV-JHM (Stohlman and Weiner, 1981) . Antibody mostly of isotype IgG2a is detected after infection (Lardans et al, 1996) , although sometimes IgG2a and IgG1 eventually reach equivalent levels (Parra et al, 1997) . Transfer of virusspeci c antibodies increases survival, presumably by decreasing peak viral levels, delaying neuronal infection, and/or decreasing neuronal infection (Fleming et al, 1989; Yokomori et al, 1992) .\n\nThe contribution of humoral immunity to viral clearance and persistent infection in the CNS has been investigated using mice de cient in secreted antibodies or B cells Bergmann et al, 2001; Matthews et al, 2001) . Mice homozygous for disruption of the Ig mu gene (muMT mice) lack B cells and develop acute disease in the CNS with similar kinetics and severity to wild-type C57BL/6 mice after MHV-JHM infection or MHV-A59 infection (Matthews et al, 2001) . Viral clearance during acute infection is similar in both groups. However, although virus is quickly cleared from the CNS of wildtype mice, it reemerges and persists in the CNS of muMT mice. B-cell-de cient mice have been shown to have impaired T cell immunity against a number of viral infections including MHV-JHM (Bergmann et al, 2001) , possibly due to their absence as antigenpresenting cells in these mice. To clarify how B cells mediate viral clearance in the CNS, we compared the role of B cells as antigen-presenting cells, using mice with B cells that are unable to secrete antibody, with that of secreted antibody, using muMT mice reconstituted with MHV-A59 immune immunoglobulin (Matthews et al, 2001) . muMT mice that received A59-speci c antibody had decreased virus in the CNS, whereas mice with B cells decient in antibody secretion did not clear virus from the CNS. These data suggest a major role for immune antibody in controlling virus replication in the CNS.\n\nNonlymphocytic immune response to MHV Natural killer (NK) cells (asialoGM1 C cells) peak in the CNS at 7 days after i.c. inoculation with MHV-JHM. The 7 d.p.i. CNS mononuclear cells are actively cytotoxic on the classic NK target cell line YAC-1 when assayed ex vivo (Williamson et al, 1991) . In the absence of T cells, a transient decrease in viral titers 5 to 7 d.p.i. has been attributed to the NK cell response (Williamson et al, 1990) . After immunosuppression by cyclophosphamide, in mice infected with a high dose of MHV-JHM, death occurs more quickly (3 d.p.i.) than in untreated mice (6-7 d.p.i.) (Weiner, 1973) . This observation suggests that the innate immune response that expands in response to infection, such as the NK cells, can be important in the early control of viral infection.\n\nMacrophages are susceptible to infection by MHV (Wijburg et al, 1996) , although only a subset is infected initially. It has been proposed that CD4 C T cells are necessary as a source of RANTES to attract monocyte/macrophage in ltration of the CNS . The role of macrophages in the immune response is dif cult to pinpoint. Depletion of blood-borne macrophages had little effect on CNS demyelination (Xue et al, 1999) . On the other hand, depletion of macrophages before i.v. infection with a highly lethal isolate of MHV-A59 resulted in earlier mortality (3-5 d.p.i.) associated with increased viral titers in the spleen and liver (Wijburg et al, 1997) . Macrophage depletion before i.n. infection with MHV-JHM also resulted in rapid death (Xue et al, 1999) . The early time point of mortality suggests that macrophages help control viral titers before the T and B cell populations are fully activated and effective.\n\nThe immune response that controls MHV infection in the liver is similar in some ways to that important in the CNS. Pre-existing antibody can protect from lethal liver infections and decrease liver lesions, so antibody is capable of controlling liver viral titers (Buchmeier et al, 1984) . However in contrast to the importance of antibody in controlling MHV-A59 replication in the CNS, antibody is not required for viral clearance from the liver. In muMT mice, which lack mature B lymphocytes, and in IgM-Tg mice with B cells that do not secrete antibody, infectious virus was cleared from the livers with similar kinetics to wild-type mice after i.c. or i.h. infection (Matthews et al, 2001) .\n\nCell-mediated immunity is required for the control of infection in the liver. Depletion of CD4 C or CD8 C T cells has been shown to result in increased MHV-JHM titers in the liver and prolonged accumulation of infectious virus to 5 d.p.i. When both T cell populations were depleted, viral titers were not controlled within 7 d.p.i., although the mice did subsequently recover (Kyuwa et al, 1996) . These data suggest that T cells play a role in controlling viral titers, even before 5 d.p.i. Beta2-microglobulinde cient mice, which lack CD8 C T cells, have delayed clearance of virus from the liver . IFN-gamma-de cient mice experience greater mortality than do wild-type mice after i.p. infection with MHV-JHM or MHV-A59 (Kyuwa et al, 1998; Schijns et al, 1996) . Virus persists up to 48 d.p.i. in the liver and large lesions develop in these mice, although there is no chronic increase in liver enzyme activity indicative of loss of liver function. Therefore, IFN-gamma is critical for viral control in the liver. In the absence of IFN-gamma, CD8 C T cell depletion further increased the severity of disease (Kyuwa et al, 1998) . Therefore, CD8 C T cell functions other than IFN-gamma production are also important for viral control.\n\nCNS demyelination develops as active MHV-A59 or MHV-JHM infection resolves. These lesions are histologically very similar to those observed in MS patients. CNS lesions are predominantly created by primary demyelination as evidenced by the intact, naked axons present in these lesions, although axonal damage is also detected . The peripheral nervous system is not affected (Lampert et al, 1973) . Lesions are scattered randomly throughout the spinal cord (Lampert, 1978) . Chronic lesions are associated with lipid-laden macrophages (presumably full of myelin), scattered lymphocytes, and naked axons. Viral particles are not detected. Astrocytic reactions and perivascular cuf ng are also sometimes found in lesions (Weiner, 1973; Stohlman and Weiner, 1981) . Chronic lesions can persist as late as 90 d.p.i. (Stohlman and Weiner, 1981) , and scattered demyelinated axons can be detected even 16 months after infection (Herndon et al, 1975) . Early demyelination after high-dose, lethal MHV-JHM infection is associated with polymorphonuclear cells, mononuclear cells, and extracellula r myelin debris. Degeneratin g axons are sometimes detectable (Lampert et al, 1973) . Nevertheless, even in necrotic lesions formed during lethal infections, some axonal preservation is observed (Weiner, 1973) .\n\nChronic disease in MHV-infected animals is characterized by a single major episode of demyelination associated with the development of ataxia, hind limb paresis, and paralysis (Lavi et al, 1984b) , following which animals usually recover. Recovery is mediated by CNS remyelination, sometimes accompanied by peripheral nervous system remyelination occurring in the CNS (Takahashi et al, 1987) . Remyelination has been reported to begin anywhere from 14 to 70 d.p.i. (Kristensson and Norrby, 1986; Takahashi et al, 1987) . As early as 2 to 3 weeks postinfection, there is a dramatic increase in MBP mRNA at the edges of lesions suggestive of early remyelination before histological detection (Kristensson and Norrby, 1986) . At 28 d.p.i., replicating oligodendrocytes were detectable near lesions (Herndon et al, 1977) . It is thought that remyelination involves oligodendrocyte precursor O-2A cell proliferation (Godfraind et al, 1989) .\n\nHow does CNS demyelination occur? This is perhaps the major question posed with the MHV model of MS. Neither acute encephalitis nor RNA persistence is suf cient to cause demyelination, as demonstrated with two mutants of MHV-A59 (Leparc-Goffart et al, 1998; Das Sarma et al, 2000) . Infectious virus does not have to be successfully cleared for demyelination to occur (Houtman and Fleming, 1996) . Transfer of CD8 C T cells during acute infection results in no subsequent demyelination, although whether this treatment changes viral RNA persistence is unclear (Stohlman et al, 1995a) . Early MHV-JHM-induced demyelination is rare in immunode cient transgenic SCID and RAG1 knockout mice or irradiated mice, demonstrating a strong if not absolute requirement for lymphocytes (Houtman and Fleming, 1996; Wu and Perlman, 1999) .\n\nElectron micrographs of demyelinating lesions demonstrate that macrophage processes slip between layers in the myelin sheath, suggesting that macrophages could be the direct mediators of demyelination (Powell and Lampert, 1975) . Macrophages localize to demyelinating lesions, and their appearance correlates with the development of lesions. They do not appear in great numbers in the absence of lymphocytes, consistent with the observation that lymphocytes are important for demyelination (Wu and Perlman, 1999; Lane et al, 2000) . Despite the visual evidence that macrophages invade myelin sheaths, it is possible that macrophages could be localizing to areas of demyelination to clean up the damaged myelin caused by a nonmacrophage dependent mechanism. Depletion of blood-borne macrophages does not affect the severity of demyelination, although similar techniques do affect demyelination in EAE and Theiler's virus-induced demyelination (Huitinga et al, 1995; Rossi et al, 1997; Xue et al, 1999) . However, macrophages that are assumed to be derived from microglia or perivascular macrophages are present in the CNS of these depleted mice and may still play a role beyond that of scavenging for disintegrating myelin (Xue et al, 1999) .\n\nT cells could mediate demyelination through direct lysis of oligodendrocytes or through in ammation mediated by CD4 C T cell-dependent in ammation as demonstrated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis . Certainly T cells persist in the CNS after virus is cleared and during active demyelination (Marten et al, 2000) . There is a signi cant amount of data demonstrating that neither CD4 C nor CD8 C T cells are speci cally required for demyelination. Demyelination occurs during acute infection of T cellde cient nude mice. Beta-2-microglobulin-de cient mice cannot express MHC class I and therefore do not develop mature CD8 C T cells. I-A b -de cient mice lack MHC class II and therefore do not develop mature CD4 C T cells. Both of these strains of T cell-de cient mice demonstrate early MHV-JHM induced demyelination (Houtman and Fleming, 1996) . Infection with MHV-A59 of beta-2 microglobulin-de cient mice and mice ef ciently depleted of CD8+ T cells also results in demyelination, although less frequently than in wild-type mice (Gombold et al, 1995; Sutherland et al, 1997; Lavi et al, 1999) .\n\nPartial depletion of CD4 C and CD8 C T cells does not inhibit chronic demyelination either, although in this study T cells were not depleted until 7 d.p.i. (Sutherland et al, 1997) . A few studies suggested that the absence of CD4 C or CD8 C T cells resulted in decient demyelination. CD4 C or CD8 C T cell-de cient mice infected with MHV-JHM were less likely to develop acute demyelination, but the mice that did develop demyelination had similar severity to that observed in wild-type mice (Houtman and Fleming, 1996) . CD4 C T cell-de cient mice infected with MHV-JHM developed acute and chronic demyelination, but it was signi cantly less severe than that seen in CD8 de cient or wild-type mice . When splenocytes were transferred to immunodecient RAG1 knockout mice, either CD4 C or CD8 C T cells were suf cient to generate signi cant levels of acute demyelination, although CD4 C T cells were less ef cient at inducing demyelination than CD8 C cells (Wu et al, 2000) . These data suggest that each of these T-cell subpopulations has the capability to mediate CNS demyelination after MHV infection and may induce slightly different levels or pathways of demyelination. On the other hand we have observed (Matthews et al, 2002) moderately sized, typical demyelinating lesions as well as atypical small round necrotic lesions in MHV-A59 infected RAG1 knockout mice, suggesting that, although T cells may be required for robust demyelination, other mechanisms must also be at work. Knockout mice have been used to demonstrate that the mechanism by which demyelination takes place requires neither perforin nor Fas-FasL interactions Parra et al, 2000) . Furthermore, removing TNF-alpha, IL-10, or IFN-gamma through depletion or the use of genetically de cient mice did not decrease demyelination (Stohlman et al, 1995b; Lin et al, 1998; Parra et al, 1999) . Chemokines, however, may play a role in demyelination. Gene expression for a number of chemokines has been found in the CNS of mice undergoing chronic demyelination (Lane et al, 1998) . Of these the C-C chemokine RANTES has been shown to possibly play a role in MHV-induced demyelination . Systemic depletion of RANTES with RANTES-speci c antisera resulted in a signi cant reduction in macrophage in ltration and demyelination in C57BL/6 mice infected with MHV-4. RANTES is a pro-in ammatory chemokine produced by T cells, platelets, and endothelia that acts as a chemoattractant for a variety of lymphocytic and myeloid cell types including monocytes and granulocytes. Lane and colleagues believe that the reduced demyelination observed in MHV-infected CD4 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice may be due to the absence of CD4 C T cell-derived RANTES . Thus, RANTES produced by CD4 C T cells may attract macrophages into the CNS during viral infection. Activated macrophages are a potent source of toxic nitric oxide intermediates produced by inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS). Inhibition of one of these, NOS-2, has been shown to reduce MHV-induced demyelination (Lane and Buchmeier, 1999) , providing further evidence for a role for pro-in ammatory innate immune mechanisms in CNS demyelination in this mouse model. Among the CXC chemokines expressed in the CNS during MHV-induced demyelinating disease is IFNinducible protein 10 (IP-10), suggesting a possible role for this chemokine in demyelination (Lane et al, 1998) . However, IP-10 has also been shown to be crucial for control of MHV viral replicatio n and recovery from acute encephalitis in the C57BL/6 mouse . Administration of anti-IP-10 antibody led to a signi cant reduction in T cells in ltrating the CNS of MHV-infected mice, decreased levels of IFN-\u00b0in the CNS and increased mortality of infected mice . Thus, although chemokinemediated in ammatory responses in the CNS may contribute to demyelination, as with all immune response elements examined, they also play a vital role in viral clearance.\n\nB cells and the antibodies they secrete could potentially also mediate demyelination. However, no correlation has been found in MHV-infected mice between antibody titers and severity of demyelination (Koolen et al, 1987) . In some animal models of CNS demyelination, antibodies against self-antigens in the brain induce or exacerbate demyelination (Brehm et al, 1999; Genain et al, 1999) but there is no evidence for the induction of antibodies that recognize host proteins after MHV infection of the CNS. We have examined the role of B cells in demyelination using B cell-de cient muMT mice (Matthews et al, 2002) . In infected B cell-de cient mice, robust demyelination not only occurred but was also statistically more severe than in wild-type animals 30 and 60 d.p.i. This increase in demyelination could be associated with the persistence of infectious virus in the absence of B cells. In mice lacking antibody Fc receptors or complement pathway activity, thereby lacking the ability to utilize antibody effector functions, virus did not persist yet demyelination was similar to that observed in wild-type mice. Antibody has also been suggested to facilitate remyelination. However, in muMT mice, remyelination was still detected. Therefore, we nd no evidence that B cells are important for CNS demyelination, nor are they required for remyelination.\n\nAnother hypothesis that has been proposed is that MHV invades the oligodendrocytes or cells that provide critical functions to the oligodendrocyte and damages them directly, thereby causing oligodendrocyte death or retraction of the myelin sheath. Early work on MHV-JHM using electron microscopy and immuno ourescence demonstrated that the virus infects oligodendrocytes early and possibly late after infection, and thereby supported this hypothesis (Lampert et al, 1973; Powell and Lampert, 1975; Wu and Perlman, 1999) . However, the degenerating oligodendrocytes detected during early paralysis rarely actually contained viral particles (Powell and Lampert, 1975) . Viral particles were also detected in astrocytes 7 d.p.i., and virus could potentially damage oligodendrocytes by disrupting the function of these cells . Interestingly, mice immunosuppressed using cyclophosphamide with resultant loss of antibody production and decreased perivascular in ammation still displayed small demyelinating lesions (Weiner, 1973) . Likewise, lipid-laden macrophages and occasional small lesions were detected in RAG1 knockout mice (Wu and Perlman, 1999) , and SCID mice can develop demyelination, if rarely (Houtman and Fleming, 1996) . Direct virally mediated demyelination is unlikely to be the sole cause of demyelination, however, because virus in the presence of T cells more reliably induces demyelinating lesions (Wang et al, 1992) .\n\nIt is clear that demyelination after MHV infection is a complex issue. It is possible that both direct viral destruction and immune mediated destruction contribute to the development of demyelinating lesions. Past research has focused on dissecting the immune response to MHV in order to determine the role of single components in the demyelinating phase of the disease. However, in contrast to other mouse models of demyelination, there does not appear to be a clear role for any one particular lymphocytic or monocytic subset that mediates the demyelination. Rather, it appears that a balance of immune components may be required for viral clearance and that various immune and nonimmune pathways may mediate the subsequent demyelinating events. It is this balance that determines the level of encephalitis in acute infection and sets up the conditions that lead to demyelination. One model that would account for the involvement of a variety of immune elements in demyelination would associate CNS pathology with free radical production by in ammatory cells of the myeloid lineage. These may be attracted into the CNS by chemokines secreted by viral speci c CD4 C T cells. In this model cytokines secreted by CD8 C T cells would assist in the state of activation of macrophages and astrocytes and therefore in uence the level of CNS disease. Such a model for CNS pathology has been implicated for EAE (Koprowski et al, 1993; Lin et al, 1993) and Borna disease virus-induced CNS pathology (Hooper et al, 2001) . Future studies are required to determine if this mechanism also prevails in MHV-induced demyelination.\n\nIn this review we have described studies in which modulating the immune response has resulted in perturbation of the balance between replication/spread of the virus and clearance with consequential changes in acute disease and demyelination. Knowledge of the contribution of different components of the disease would be useful in manipulating this balance so that robust viral clearance does not result in chronic CNS demyelination."}
