Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit 29 (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients 30 with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised 31 subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general. 32 ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for 33 malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in 34 chronic and acute disease. Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required 35 for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause 36 malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, 37 poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of 38 malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients. 39 In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) 40 aims at providing concise guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients by 41 proposing 10 practical recommendations. The practical guidance is focused to those in the ICU 42 setting or in the presence of older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated 43 with malnutrition and its negative impact on patient survival. The breaking of a COVID-19 pandemic is posing unprecedented challenges and threats to 48 patients and healthcare systems worldwide (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . The disease primarily involves the respiratory 49 tract (1-5) but it may deteriorate to multi-organ failure and be fatal (3). Acute respiratory 50 complications that are reported to require prolonged ICU stays are a major cause of morbidity 51 and mortality in COVID-19 patients, and older adults and polymorbid individuals have worst 52 outcomes and higher mortality (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . ICU stays, and particularly their longer duration, are per se 53 well-documented causes of malnutrition, with loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which 54 in turn may lead to poor quality of life, disability and morbidities long after ICU discharge (6). 55 Many chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and their clustering in 56 polymorbid individuals (7) as well as older age per se (8) are also very commonly associated 57 with high risk and prevalence of malnutrition and worse outcomes. Causes of ICU-and disease-58 related malnutrition include reduced mobility, catabolic changes particularly in skeletal muscle 59 as well as reduced food intake, all of which may be exacerbated in older adults (6-8). In (Table   101 1). According to GLIM, diagnosis of malnutrition requires at least 1 phenotypic criterion and 1 102 etiologic criterion. 103 The above considerations appear to be fully applicable to patients at risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 104 infection or hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, since poor outcomes in COVID-19 are reported 105 in patients that are most likely to present with malnutrition (such as older adults and comorbid 106 individuals). Preserving nutritional status and preventing or treating malnutrition also 107 importantly has the potential to reduce complications and negative outcomes in patients at 108 nutritional risk who might incur in COVID-19 in the future. In particular, COVID-19 can be 109 accompanied by nausea, vomiting and diarrhea impairing food intake and absorption (2), thus a 110 good nutritional status is an advantage for people at risk for severe COVID-19. In a recent 111 6 review about potential interventions for novel coronavirus based on the Chinese experience 112 authors suggested that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated 113 before the administration of general treatments (11) . 114 Looking at influenza infections, particular predictors of mortality could be identified by 115 multivariate analysis such as type of virus (OR 7.1), malnutrition (OR 25.0), hospital-acquired 116 infection (OR 12.2), respiratory insufficiency (OR 125.8) and pulmonary infiltrate on X-ray (OR 117 6.0) were identified as predictors (12) . It should be considered that also malnourished children (11) . Malnutrition and famine were associated with high disease severity 130 and was related to mortality also in the younger population. Undernutrition remains a problem 131 for viral pandemics of the twenty-first century and beyond. Indeed, chronic malnutrition was 132 thought to have contributed to the high morbidity and mortality seen in Guatemalan children 133 7 during the 2009 influenza pandemic (12) . In a future virus pandemic, we might face a \"double 134 burden\" of malnutrition, when both undernutrition and overnutrition will promote severity of 135 disease. It is now well accepted that obesity increases one's risk of being hospitalized with, and 136 dying from, an influenza virus infection, and that obesity inhibits both virus-specific CD8+ T cell 137 responses and antibody responses to the seasonal influenza vaccine (11) . The challenge for 138 future virus pandemics is therefore not only to protect those affected by undernutrition, but 139 also the growing number of people living with obesity (11) . This is particularly important for the 140 WHO European Region as in many European countries obesity and overweight affects 30-70% 141 of the population. (14) In a recent Japanese study, malnutrition and pneumonia were identified 142 as the prognostic factors in influenza infection, which are amenable to medical intervention. 143 Using Cox proportional hazards modeling with prescribed independent variables, male sex, 144 severity score, serum albumin levels, and pneumonia were associated with survival 30 days 145 from the onset of influenza (13). 146 We provide suggestions based on various ESPEN Guidelines, with particular regard to those on 147 polymorbid internal medicine patients (7) and those on geriatrics (8). We refer the reader to 255 We suggest that general guidance on prevention and treatment of malnutrition by using ONS is 276 targets. 277 Enteral nutrition should be implemented when nutritional needs cannot be met by the oral 278 route, e.g if oral intake is expected to be impossible for more than three days or expected to be 279 below half of energy requirements for more than one week. In these cases, the use of EN may General comments: When patients are stabilized and even in prone position, enteral feeding 369 can be started ideally after measuring indirect calorimetry targeting energy supply to 30% of 370 the measured energy expenditure. Energy administration will be increased progressively. 371 During emergency times, the predictive equation recommending 20 kcal/kg/day could be used 372 and energy increased to 50-70% of the predictive energy at day 2 to reach 80-100% at day 4.\n\nThe protein target of 1.3 g/kg/day should also be reached by day 3-5. Gastric tube is preferred 374 but in case of large gastric residual volume (above 500 mL), duodenal tube should be inserted 375 quickly. The use of enteral omega-3 fatty acids may improve oxygenation but strong evidence is 376 missing. If intolerance to enteral nutrition is present, parenteral nutrition should be considered. 377 Blood glucose should be maintained at target levels between 6-8 mmol/l, along with monitoring 378 of blood triglycerides and electrolytes including phosphate, potassium and magnesium (6). 405 The long-term prognosis of patients surviving intensive care is affected by physical, cognition 406 and mental impairment that occur following ICU stay (42). Loss of skeletal muscle mass and 407 muscle function may be tremendous and a major problem in ICU survivors (43). This may 408 particularly apply to older adults and comorbid patients that are more prone to present with 409 pre-existing catabolic conditions and impaired skeletal muscle mass and function; in addition, 410 these patient groups may be more presumably prone to develop more intense catabolic 411 responses due to COVID-19 and to ICU conditions at large. Prolonged reported duration of ICU 412 stay above two weeks for many COVID-19 patients is likely to further enhance muscle-catabolic 413 conditions. Appropriate energy delivery avoiding overfeeding and adequate protein 414 administration are critical to prevent this severe loss of muscle mass and function (see "}
