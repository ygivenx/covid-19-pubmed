{"title": "Microinjection of mRNA Coding for an Anti-Golgi Antibody Inhibits Intracellular Transport of a Viral Membrane Protein", "body": "The Golgi complex in eucaryotic cells plays a pivotal role in the intracellular transport and concomittant processing of newly synthesized secretory, lysosomal, and plasma membrane proteins (Palade, 1975; Rothman, 1981) . Functions which have thus far been localized to this organelle include trimming and terminal glycosylation of asparaginelinked oligosaccharides (reviewed by Hubbard and Ivatt, 1981) fatty acylation of membrane proteins (Schmidt et al., 1979) and phosphorylation of mannose residues on lysosomal enzymes (von Figura and Klein, 1979; Hasilik and Neufeld, 1980; Reitman and Kornfeld, 1981) . Much attention is now focused on the localization of these different functions to distinct compartments or cisternae within the Golgi stacks. One recent approach to this problem has been based on the use of drugs which may specifically block intracellular transport within the Golgi complex but not the synthesis of proteins to be transported. The rationale behind such an approach is that partially processed proteins should then accumulate immediately prior to the block. Thus by examination of these immature proteins, using biochemical and immunocytochemical techniques, one may be able to determine the positions of the various processing enzymes relative to the drug-induced transport block. The only drug that has been used so far with any degree of success is monensin Vassalli, 1977, 1978; Griffiths et al., 1983; Quinn et al., 1983) . This drug, however, is far from ideal since it severely perturbs the normal morphology of the Golgi complex and may well have further undesirable effects. In addition to these problems it is still far from clear how monensin exerts its effects.\n\nAs an alternative to the use of drugs, we considered the possibility of using antibodies to specifically interfere with Golgi functions. Currently, there are several well-characterized antibodies available that recognize specific Golgi proteins. These include polyclonal antisera against galactosyl transferase (Roth and Berger, 1982; Hiller and Weber, 1982) and mannosidase II (Novokoff et al., 1983) and both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against a 135K Golgi membrane protein Burke et al., 1982) .\n\nIntroduction of specific antibodies into cells can be achieved relatively easily by microneedle injection and there are several well-documented experiments where specific cytoplasmic processes have been disrupted using this or similar methods (Mabuchi and Okuno, 1977; Yamaizumi et al., 1978; Antman and Livingstone, 1980; Lin and Feramisco, 1981) . In the case of the Golgi complex, however, mere injection of antibodies into the cytoplasm may have no effect on function since all the available antisera appear to recognize protein domains on the luminal side of the Golgi membranes. Furthermore, all enzymic and receptor activities that can be assigned to the Golgi complex reside on the luminal side of the Golgi membranes.\n\nThe only obvious way, then, of introducing a specific antibody into the lumen of the Golgi complex is to microinject, not the antibody itself, but the messenger RNA coding for the heavy and light chains of the antibody. Since immunoglobulins are secretory proteins, one would expect the mRNAs to be translated on membrane-bound polysomes and the heavy and light chains to be translocated into the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they are known to assemble to form functional antibodies Valle et al., 1982) . These antibody molecules would then be transported to the Golgi complex where they could bind to their specific antigen.\n\nSince this approach requires a source of appropriate mRNA, one is clearly confined to the use of monoclonal antibodies. In this paper we describe experiments where we have microinjected BHK cells with mRNA coding for a monoclonal antibody (53FC3) against a 135K Golgi protein and we show that the antibody produced in these cells accumulates within the Golgi complex. We also examine the effects of microinjection of this mRNA on the cell surface expression of the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).\n\nWe showed previously (Burke et al., 1982 ) that most of the mass of the 135K protein was located on the luminal side of Golgi membranes since it was largely resistant to digestion by proteases added to sealed Golgi vesicles. We did not determine the location of the epitope recognized by 53FC3 although there was some circumstantial evidence to suggest that it was on the luminal side. We have now repeated these digestion experiments and, as shown in Figure 1 , the binding of 53FC3 to the 135K protein was not affected by protease treatment unless the vesicles were first made permeable using Triton X-100. The epitope recognized by 53FC3 is thus indeed located on the luminal side of Golgi membranes.\n\nTo determine whether 53FC3 could bind to the 135K protein in vivo, mRNA coding for this antibody was injected into the cytoplasm of BHK cells. We have already shown by immunofluorescence microscopy that 53FC3 recognizes the 135K protein in these cells ( Figure 2 ). Afer 5-6 hr incubation at 37\u00b0C the cells were fixed and any synthesis of mouse IgG was detected using a specific antibody conjugated to rhodamine. As shown in Figure 3 , the microinjected cells displayed a strong perinuclear fluorescence that was very similar in appearance to the pattern 0906 0025 01 0.4 1.5 60 ug Golgi Membmnes Rat liver Golgi vesicles were digested with 100 fig/ml trypsin in either the presence or absence of 0.4% Triton X-100 for 1 hr at 25\u00b0C. Membranes were then solubilized in Trtton X-100 in the presence of protease inhibitors. Appropriately diluted samples were spotted onto nitrocellulose and labeled with 53FC3 and iodinated protein A as described in Experimental Procedures. Digestion conditions used were as follows: 0 + Trypsin, -Triton; n + Tryspin, + Triton: 0 -Trypsin, -Trtton; 0 -Trypsin, + Trtton. Inset:\n\nEffects of trypsin digestion in the presence (A) or absence (A) of Triton X-100 (0.4%) on galactosyl transferase activity (a luminal marker) in rat liver Golgi vesicles. At 100 Ag/ml trypsin rn the presence of Trtton, activity is completely abolished while in the absence of Triton it IS largely unaffected. seen when BHK cells are stained in the conventional manner with the monoclonal antibody ( Figure 2 ). If, prior to fixation, the microinjected cells were treated for 2.5 hr with cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis but not intracellular transport (Jamieson and Palade, 1968 ) essentially the same pattern was seen ( Figure 4 ) indicating that mouse IgG was accumulating in what appeared to be the Golgi complex. Identical labeling patterns were found in every microinjected cell found expressing IgG (about 80 cells) in three separate experiments.\n\nSince BHK cells do not normally secrete IgG it is possible that this accumulation may simply have been due to a nonspecific phenomenon and not to a specific interaction Six hours after microinjection the cells were fixed in formaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton X-100 and then labeled with affinity-purified rabbi anti-mouse tgG that was conjugated to rhodamine. Note the similarity with Figure between 53FC3 and the 135K protein. To test this, mRNA mulation could be seen ( Figure 5A ). However, to ensure from another hybridoma making an IgG directed against a that these cells were indeed synthesizing the IgG, 10 PM viral antigen (Coronavirus El, 471Ml) was injected into monensin was added to the medium for the last 3 hr of BHK cells. After 5-6 hr incubation no intracellular accu-incubation in order to block secretion (Tartakoff and Vas- Five hours after microinjection cycloheximide was added to the medium to a final concentration of 10 pg/ml and the incubation continued for a further 2.5 hr. The cells were then fixed and labeled as described for Figure 3 . The corresponding field photographed using Nomarski optics is shown in (6). Bar = 20 am. sali, 1977) . When these cells were stained with rabbit antimouse IgG, a pattern resembling the ER was seen indicating that the mouse IgG was indeed being synthesized ( Figure 5C ). In the absence of monensin it is presumably secreted.\n\nSimilarly, when the 53FC3 mRNA was injected into 3T3 cells ( Figure 5E ) accumulation of mouse IgG could only be detected after treatment with monensin ( Figure 5G ). 3T3 cells contain the 135K protein as judged by immunofluorescence microscopy using polyclonal antisera, but lack the epitope recognized by 53FC3. This is true of all the mouse cells we have tested so far (results not shown).\n\nCells Expressing 53FC3 Since the 53FC3 immunoglobulin appeared to accumulate in the Golgi complex, presumably by way of its specific interaction with the 135K protein, it seemed likely that this might disrupt in some way the normal functioning of the organelle. This might, for example, be reflected in the inhibition of surface expression of plasma membrane proteins To investigate this, BHK cells were injected with 53FC3 mRNA and allowed to accumulate antibody intracellularly for 5 hr. At this point the cells were infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus, tsO45, the G protein of which is synthesized but unable to leave the ER at the nonpermissive temperature of 39.5\"C (Bergman et al., 1981) . The cells were infected for 1 hr at 37'C and incubated for a further 1.5 hr at 39.5'C to allow accumulation of viral G protein in the ER. The cells were then transferred to the permissive temperature of 31 \"C for 30 min, which is sufficient time for the G protein to appear on the cell surface (Bergman et al., 1981) . At the end of this incubation period the cells were fixed and labeled with rabbit anti-VSV-G protein without prior permeabilization so that only G protein on the cell surface was labeled. The cells were then treated with Triton X-100 and labeled with both rhodamine-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (to reveal surface G protein) and fluorescein-conjugated sheep antimouse IgG (to reveal 53FC3 in the Golgi complex). The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 6 . Microinjetted cells had considerably less surface G protein when compared with their neighbors. This lack of surface labeling was not due to inability of the VSV tsO45 to infect the microinjected cells since Triton X-l 00 treatment prior to G protein labeling resulted in strong internal staining in at least 95% of the cells expressing 53FC3 (Figure 7) approximately the same percentage as the noninjected cells. These data clearly indicate that 53FC3 in the Golgi complex can inhibit the surface expression of VSV-G protein.\n\nIt should be emphasized that we have never seen complete inhibition of surface expression of the viral G protein. We examined about 100 microinjected cells and found that 80%~90% of these showed considerable reduction in surface expression of G protein and about 40%-50% exhibited almost no surface G protein. It was, however, clear to us that the inhibition increased with the increasing amounts of injected mRNA. The fact that we could not obtain complete inhibition did have the advantage of showing that each microinjected cell examined was indeed infected.\n\nIn order to show that this inhibition of surface expression of VSV-G protein was not due to some trivial effect arising from the microinjection of hybridoma mRNA, we repeated the experiments described above using 417Ml mRNA. Since 417Ml IgG does not accumulate intracellularly (Figure 5) individual microinjected cells are difficult to identify. We therefore injected every cell on previously marked, and easily identifiable, areas of the glass coverslip. Out of 80 microinjected cells we could find no evidence for a reduction in the surface expression of the viral G protein ( Figure  8 ). This suggests that 53FC3 does indeed exert a specific effect.\n\nIn this paper we describe a novel method for blocking intracellular transport at the level of the Golgi complex using a monoclonal antibody directed against a luminal component of some Golgi cisternae. We show that after microinjection of the appropriate mRNA, BHK ceils are able to synthesize the IgG which is transported to the Golgi complex where it can recognize its specific antigen and accumulate. If these microinjected cells are subsequently infected with VSV, surface expression of the viral G protein is greatly inhibited despite the fact that viral infection appears to have occurred normally. How this inhibition of surface expression takes place is not clear. There are, however, two rather different although not mutually exclusive possibilities. The first is that binding of the antibody may inhibit some specific function of the 135K protein which is essential for intracellular transport. At present, we have no idea what the function of this protein might be. The second possibility is that by cross-linking proteins within the Golgi membranes the organelle may simply be unable to function efficiently. This explanation would, of course, require that the 135K protein exists as an oligomer in vivo. Furthermore, one would have to argue that crosslinked proteins within Golgi membranes are not dealt with in the same manner as those on the cell surface despite the fact that the luminal face of Golgi membranes and the external surface of the cell are topologically equivalent. Plasma membrane proteins cross-linked with antibodies are rapidly internalized and directed to lysosomes (Silverstein et al.,1977) . Our results indicated, however, that the bulk of 53FC3 remains in the Golgi complex for at least 2.5 hr.\n\nDespite the fact that the mechanism of this inhibition is still not clear, there are nevertheless certain conclusions which may be drawn. First, and most important, our data strongly support the view (Rothman, 1981) that plasma membrane and secretory proteins must share a common pathway through at least that part of the Golgi complex prior to the one or two cisternae in each Golgi stack in which the 135K protein is located (Burke et al., 1982) . Second, since after microinjection we could never find any evidence for the 135K protein appearing on the plasma Cells were treated exactly as described in Figure 6 except that the cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 prior to labeling with rabbit anti-VSV-G so that internal G protein was also labeled. BHK cells growing within a marked area on a glass coverslip were all microinjected with 417Ml mRNA, incubated for 5 hr and infected with VSV-tsO45 as described in the text. The cells were fixed and labeled with antibodies exactly as described in Figure 6 . Only labeling of G protein on the cell surface is shown since there is no appreciable intracellular accumulation of 417Ml IgG. (A) All the cells within this field (part of a group of 60) were microinjected with 417Ml mRNA. (B) Noninjected cells. Clearly microinjection with 417Ml mRNA has little or no effect on the surface expression of VSV-G protein. Bar = 20 pm. membrane, it would appear that simply attaching a secretory protein, an immunoglobulin, to an integral, Golgi membrane protein is insufficient to make it move from its normal location to the exterior of the cell. Our observations also explain the rather restricted species specificity of the monoclonal antibody. As described previously (Burke et al., 1982) the hybridoma was obtained from a fusion involving spleen cells from a mouse immunized with rat liver Golgi membranes. Clearly, it would create problems for a hybridoma (or any cell) to secrete antibody directed against a component found on the luminal side of its own Golgi membranes. It is not surprising then that although the antibody recognizes the 135K pro-tein in most rodent cells tested, it does not recognize the protein in mouse cells.\n\nWhile microinjection of both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies has previously been used to modify the behavior of cytoplasmic proteins, we believe this is the first report of a monoclonal antibody being used to block the intracellular transport of a plasma membrane protein. Furthermore, the antibody was introduced into the intracellular transport pathway by microinjection of specific mRNA coding for the antibody heavy and light chains. Thus we utilized the cells' own secretory machinery to deliver the antibody to the correct location. Although we have not thus far attempted to extend our results to the biochemical level, there is no reason to believe that this cannot be done. Cleveland et al. (1983) for instance, have recently been able to demonstrate biochemically that tubulin biosynthesis is depressed in cells microinjected with purified tubulin. Clearly the procedures that we have employed here are not only applicable to the study of the Golgi complex, but may be used to investigate the function of any protein specific to any of the compartments that comprise the intracellular transport pathway. The only requirement is the availability of the appropriate monoclonal antibody.\n\nCell Culture 3T3 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and containing penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). BHK cells were grown in Glasgow MEM containing 5% FCS, 10% tryptose phosphate broth (Gibco), and penicillin/streptomycin. Hybridomas were grown in Dulbecco's MEM contarning 4.5 g/L glucose, 15% FCS. and penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator wrth a 7.5% CO,, 92.5% air atmosphere. For bulk growth of hybridomas, 5 L glass spinner culture vessels gassed with 5% CO,, 95% air were used.\n\nAssay Rat liver Golgi membrane vesicles (Bergeron, 1979) were treated with trypsin (IO-loo0 as/ml) as described by Fleischer (1981) and modified by Burke et al. (1982) either in the presence or absence of 0.4% Triton X-l 00. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 25 mg/ml ovomucoid to give a final concentration of 3 mg, il. After a 5 min incubation on ice the Triion X-108 concentration of all samples was brought to 0.4%. The samples were then diluted as appropriate (see Results) in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 40 pg/ml PMSF. Two microliter aliquots (+fold serially diluted) were spotted 1 cm apart onto a nitrocellulose filter (Glenney et al., 1982; Howe and Hershey, 1981) . The filter was then air-dried and soaked in PBS containing 2% bovrne hemoglobulin and 0.2% Triton X-108 (PBS/Hb/Tx). After 30 min the filter was transferred to 20 ml of 53FC3 culture supernatant and Incubated for a further 45 min at room temperature. Following three 15 min washes in PBS/Hbflx the filter was incubated for 45 mm at room temperature rn the same solution containing rabbit ant\\-mouse IgG appropriately dluted. The filter was again washed three times and finally labeled with \"?-protein A (New England Nuclear: 600,003 cpm/ml in PBS/Hb/Tx) for 45 min. After extensive washing the individual dots were cut out and counted. Galactosyl transferase was assayed as described by Bretz and Staubli (1977) as modified by Bretz et al. (1980) .\n\nMinrscopy BHK or 3T3 cells were grown on glass coverslips and, following microinjection of mRNA or Infection with VSV-tsO45 were fixed and labeled with antibodies using the procedures described by Ash et al. (1977) . Antibodies used were affinity-purified (Ternynck and Avrameas. 1976 ) and coupled to rhcda :ine (Brandtzaeg, 1973) .\n\nMessenger RNA at a concentratron of 1 mg/ml was microinjected into the cytoplasm of BHK or 3T3 cells grown on glass coverslips. The procedures employed for mtcroinjection were either those described by Ansorge (1982) or by Timm et al. (1983) . Both techniques gave identical results.\n\nof mRNA Cells, grown to a density of 6 x 105/ml, were treated with 10 pg/ml cyclohexrmide (CHX) and the cells harvested in a Beckman J6-B centrifuge at 2,500 rpm for 10 min. The cells were then washed successively in PBS containing CHX; 106 mM MKCI, 2 mM Mg acetate, 5 mM DTT, 10 rg/ml CHX, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). and finally in 15 mM KCI, 1.5 mM Mg acetate, 5 mM DTT, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). After resuspension in 2 volumes of this last wash buffer, the cells were left on ice for 15 min and then broken by 20 strokes in a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer. One tenth by volume of 0.9 M KCI, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) was added to the homogenate and the nuclei removed by centrifugation in a Sorvall SSS4 rotor at 1988 rpm for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. Microsomes were also collected by centnfugation in the SS34 at 20,000 rpm for 30 mm at 4\u00b0C. They were resuspended In 120 mM NaCI, IO mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5) and then SDS was added to a final concentration of 2%. RNA was then extracted in chloroform-phenol.\n\nFollowing the addition of Na acetate to 0.2 M the RNA was preapitated in ethanol at -20\u00b0C. The RNA was redissolved rn 0.5 M NaCI, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5) and mRNA was prepared by affinity chromatography on oligo dT cellulose, as described by Blobel and Dobberstein (1977) . After a final ethanol precipitation, the mRNA was redissolved in water to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. A small aliquot from the mRNA preparation was translated in vitro in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes to confirm that mRNA for the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains was indeed present (Meyer and Dobberstein, 1980; Warren and Dobberstein, 1978) ."}
