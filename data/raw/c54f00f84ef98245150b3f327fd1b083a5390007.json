{"title": "Stereoselective synthesis of trans-dihydronarciclasine derivatives containing a 1,4-benzodioxane moiety", "body": "Nowadays, hundreds of members of alkaloids are known, which have been isolated from the plants of Amaryllidaceae family. After recognising their anticancerous properties, more and more attention has been paid to their isolation and structural elucidation [1] . The alkaloids prepared from this plant family are divided into 12 groups according to their ring systems [2] . Among these diverse structures, the most potent antitumorous alkaloids can be found in the phenanthridone subgroup. Surprisingly, the detailed investigations of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids started only at the end of the nineteenth century, when Gerrard isolated lycorine (1, Fig. 1 pseudonarcissus in 1877 [3, 4] . Since then, several alkaloids have been obtained from various Amaryllidaceae plants including trans-dihydronarciclasine (2, Fig. 1 ) isolated by Pettit and co-workers from Zephyranthes candida in 1990 [5] . Compound 2 is the most potent natural anticancerous alkaloid among the Amaryllidaceae ones according to the data from National Cancer Institute (NCI, USA) [6] . Its 7-deoxy analogue (3, Fig. 1 ) was also isolated by Pettit and co-workers from Hymenocallis caribaea and Hymenocallis latifolia, in pure form, but its biological activity was found to be weaker than that of 2 [6] . This can be explained by the lack of hydroxyl group at the position A-7, similarly to the comparison of other representatives, such as pancratistatin (4) and 7-deoxypancratistatin (5) or narciclasine (6) and lycoricidine (7) (Fig. 1 ) [6] . Further structure-activity relationship studies have intensively been made to find more effective synthetic analogues, but the modifications rather touched the ring C of the phenanthridone skeleton [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] than its ring A [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .\n\nFurthermore, the Amaryllidaceae alkaloids also showed significant antiviral effects. Thus, compound 1 has strong activity against herpes simplex 1 and varicella zoster DNA viruses [29] and against several RNA viruses, such as avian influenza virus (H5N1) [30] or SARS coronavirus [31] . It has also inhibitory effects against reverse transcriptase enzyme in the HIV-1 virus [32] . Besides, strong antiviral activities of some phenanthridone alkaloids including compounds 4, 6, and 7 were reported by Gabrielsen and coworkers [33, 34] . Very recently, trans-dihydronarciclasine, pancratistatin, and narciclasine have also been found to be active against Zika virus [35] .\n\nPreviously, the racemic [36] and the ent-forms of 3 [37] , as well as those of 2 [38, 39] , were stereoselectively synthesised using our facile and efficient process developed recently. Later, we also reported the highly stereoselective synthesis of a series of analogues of 2 substituted by alkyloxy groups (ethoxy and/or methoxy) in the aromatic ring [40] . In this work, focusing further on the modification of ring A of the phenanthridone scaffold by introducing a relatively rigid substituent, the stereoselective syntheses of some new trans-dihydronarciclasine analogues containing a 1,4-benzodioxane moiety (Fig. 2) , such as 2,3,4-trihydroxy-1,3,4,4a,5,9,10,12b-octahydro [1, 4] dioxino[2,3-j]phenanthridin-6(2H)-one (8), 2,3,4,7-tetrahydroxy-1,3,4,4a,5,9,10,12b-octahydro [1, 4] dioxino[2,3-j]phenanthridin-6(2H)-one (9), 2,3,4-trihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,3,4,4a,5,9,10,12b-octahydro [1, 4] dioxino [2,3j] phenanthridin-6(2H)-one (10) and 2,3,4-trihydroxy-11methoxy-1,2,3,4,4a, 8,9, 12b-octahydro [1, 4] dioxino [2,3- i]phenanthridin-6(2H)-one (11) , were described in both racemic and enantiopure forms.\n\nOur modifying strategy related to ring A of the phenanthridone skeleton aimed at the methylenedioxy (-OCH 2 O-) structural part, a rigid functional group, in transdihydronarciclasine, because this molecule part may also be responsible for the anticancerous activity of this alkaloid. Thus, the homologous ethylenedioxy (-OCH 2 CH 2 O-) one was introduced into the aromatic ring to obtain new analogues for further structure-activity relationship studies.\n\nSimilarly to our previous synthetic works [38] [39] [40] , the starting material was vanillin (12) , an inexpensive and readily available substance. As seen in Scheme 1, in the initial step, compound 12 was demethylated to 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (13) in dichloromethane by AlCl 3 and pyridine, using a known method [41] , in good yield (92%). Hydroxyvanillin (15) was also obtained from 12, but in this case, at first, it was selectively iodinated to 5-iodovanillin (14) [42] almost quantitatively, and then compound 14 was Fig. 2 Structures of trans-dihydronarciclasine derivatives containing a 1,4-benzodioxane moiety (8) (9) (10) (11) hydrolysed with 20% aqueous NaOH solution in presence of CuSO 4 [43] to give 15 in 64% yield. The dihydrobenzodioxine ring was formed with 1,2-dibromoethane in DMF, in the presence of K 2 CO 3 [44] to afford 2,3-dihydrobenzo[b] [1, 4] dioxine-6-carbaldehyde (16) and 8-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b] [1, 4] dioxine-6-carbaldehyde (17) in good yield (63%). In the next step, acetone was condensed with these benzaldehyde derivatives 16 and 17 in the Claisen-Schmidt reaction applying a high excess of acetone in water and basic conditions (NaOH) to give 4-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b] [1, 4] dioxin-6-yl)but-3-en-2-one (18) and 4-(8-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b] [1, 4] dioxin-6yl)but-3-en-2-one (19) in good yields (83 and 62%, respectively). Since dibenzylidene acetone derivatives may also be formed during this reaction, the pure products were obtained after distillation.\n\nThe first asymmetric centre of the title molecules was formed by Michael addition of nitromethane to compounds 18 and 19 to afford (\u00b1)-4-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b] [1, 4] dioxin-6-yl)-5-nitropentan-2-one [(\u00b1)-20] and (\u00b1)-4-(8- [1, 4] dioxin-6-yl)-5-nitropentan-2-one [(\u00b1)-21]. These racemic representatives were prepared by using Peseke and co-workers' mild method (MeNO 2 , EtOH, K 2 CO 3 ) [45] in very good yields (75-86%). Moreover, this reaction allows an opportunity to obtain these intermediates in enantiomerically pure form.\n\nThe results of the enantioselective Michael addition are summarised in Table 1 . Using 20 mol % (8S,9S)-9amino(9-deoxy)epiquinine (22) organocatalyst [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] under conditions applied previously [39, 40] , the optically active nitropentanones (-)-20 and (-)-21 were prepared in good yield (67%) and excellent enantioselectivity (92-98% ee) after 7 days. The negative optical rotation values suggest, in accordance with our previous studies [39, 40] , that these new intermediates enable synthesising further entforms of natural alkaloid analogues.\n\nHenceforth, only the syntheses of the optically active compounds are shown, but the racemic derivatives can be afforded in the same way. As seen in Scheme 2, the ring C was built by the Claisen-Henry reaction using ethyl\n\nStereoselective synthesis of trans-dihydronarciclasine derivatives containing\u2026 2267\n\nformate and dry sodium methoxide in anhydrous diethyl ether to give (-)-3-hydroxy-5- 24] in moderate yields (46-57%) after column chromatography or recrystallisation from ethyl acetate. Full diastereoselectivity was achieved in this cyclisation step which can be explained by the H-bond formation between the C-3 hydroxy and C-4 nitro groups (Fig. 3) , as described by Walker [54] and observed by us previously [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Prior to the reduction of the nitro group into the amino one, the carbonyl group of (-)-23 and (-)-24 was protected with ethylene glycol, in the presence of oxalic acid, in anhydrous acetonitrile to afford (?)-3-hydroxy-5-(2 0 ,3 0 -dihydrobenzo[b] [1, 4] [1, 4] dioxin-6 0 -yl)cyclohexanone ethylene acetal [(?)-28], in good yields (56-75%) using our catalytic hydrogenation method [39, 55] : 10% Pd/C (Selcat Q [56] ), methanol, 60-80\u00b0C and 12 bar. Subsequently, amino ketal (?)-27 or (?)-28 was reacted with methyl chloroformate in a biphasic solvent mixture (water and THF) to obtain (?)-3-hydroxy-4-methoxycarbonylamino-5-(2 0 ,3 0 -dihydrobenzo[b] [1, 4] dioxin-6 0 -yl)cyclohexanone ethylene acetal [(?) -29] or (?)-3-hydroxy-4-\n\nquantitatively. The ketal protective group of (?)-29 or (?)-30 was removed in acetone containing a catalytic amount of ptoluenesulphonic acid under reflux, but water elimination also took place to afford (-)-6- [1, 4] dioxin-6 0 -yl)-4-oxocyclohex-2-enyl)carbamic acid methyl ester [(-)-32] in excellent yields (88-93%).\n\nThen the oxo group of (-)-31 or (-)-32 was stereoselectively reduced with NaBH 4 , in the presence of CaCl 2 , in methanol (Utimoto's method [57] ) to obtain (-)-6-(2 0 ,3 0dihydrobenzo[b] [1, 4] dioxin-6 0 -yl)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2enyl)carbamic acid methyl ester [(-)-33] or (-)-6-(8 0methoxy-2 0 ,3 0 -dihydrobenzo[b] [1, 4] dioxin-6 0 -yl)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-enyl)carbamic acid methyl ester [(-) -34] in good yields (67-79%) and excellent enantiopurity ([ 99% ee) after recrystallisation from hexane/ethyl acetate (2:1). This very high stereoselectivity was achieved with an axial attack of the small hydride ion derived from NaBH 4 enhanced by the coordination with Ca 2? , resulting in an equatorial position of the hydroxy group formed newly (Scheme 3). However, the structure of the title compounds requires the inversion of this asymmetry centre. For this purpose, the Mitsunobu reaction [58] in a ratio of 1:1, in very good yield (87%). Although the 8 0 -deoxy derivative (-)-39 gave selectively compound (-)-41, it was converted spontaneously into the corresponding lactam one resulting in its poor yield. As seen in Scheme 4, the acidic treatment of (-)-41 with 2 M HCl in THF afforded (-)-2-benzoyloxy-6-oxo-1,2,3,4,4a,9,10,12b-octahydro [1, 4] 44] in moderate yield (54%), which was subsequently deacylated by the Zempl\u00e9n's method [61] (NaOMe/MeOH) in THF to give the title compound (-)-8 in good yield (71%).\n\nIn the next reactions the racemic form of (\u00b1)-42 and (\u00b1)-43 was used, but the same results could be obtained by applying their optically active ones. When the 1:1 mixture of regioisomers (\u00b1)-42 and (\u00b1)-43 was quantitatively converted into lactams, such as (\u00b1)-2-benzoyloxy-7methoxy-6-oxo-1,2,3,4,4a,8,9,12b-octahydro [1, 4] 45 ] and (\u00b1)-2-benzoyloxy-11-methoxy-6-oxo-1,2,3,4,4a,8,9,12boctahydro [1, 4] dioxino[2,3-i]phenanthridine-3,4-diyl diacetate [(\u00b1)-46], in the same way (Scheme 5), the methyl group of 7-methoxy derivative (\u00b1)-45 was selectively cleaved with iodotrimethylsilane (TMS-I) prepared in situ from chlorotrimethylsilane (TMS-Cl) and potassium iodide, in anhydrous acetonitrile to obtain (\u00b1)-2-benzoyloxy-7-hydroxy-6-oxo-1,2,3,4,4a,9,10,12b-octahydro [1, 4] while the methyl group in A-11 position of another regioisomer (\u00b1)-46 remained untouched allowing their separation. However, due to the poor yield (20%) of (\u00b1)-47 and the formation of further two by-products, such as (\u00b1)-3-acetamido-6-benzoyloxy-4- -49] , which proved also to be regioisomers (Fig. 4) , our synthesis strategy was modified. The structures of these regioisomers were distinguished by the chemical shifts of 5 0 -H Ar and 5 0 -C Ar of (\u00b1)-48, as well as 7 0 -H Ar and 7 0 -C Ar of (\u00b1)-49, because there were significant differences between the positions of these peaks both in the 1 H NMR (6.72 ppm for 5 0 -H Ar and 6.54 ppm for 7 0 -H Ar ) and 13 C NMR spectra (110.8 ppm for 5 0 -C Ar and 102.0 ppm for 7 0 -C Ar ). These diversions were due to the anisotropic shielding effect of the adjacent methoxy group in compound (\u00b1)-49, which resulted in lower chemical shifts for those aromatic hydrogen and carbon atoms at position A-7.\n\nAt first, as shown in Scheme 6, the 1:1 mixture of regioisomers (-)-42 and (-)-43 was also deacylated using the Zempl\u00e9n's method resulting in (-)-6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4,4a,9,10,12b-octahydro [1, 4] were also demethylated selectively at the position A-7 using the abovementioned method (TMS-I, acetonitrile). As a result of this cleavage, (-)-7-hydroxy-6-oxo-1,2,3,4,4a,9,10,12b-octahydro [1, 4] dioxino[2,3-j]phenanthridine-2,3,4-triyl triacetate [(-)-54] was obtained in moderate yield (55%). Then, compound (-)-52, (-)-53, or (-)-54 was also deacetylated by Zempl\u00e9n's method to afford (-)-9 in good yield (76%), and due to the regioisomer formation, two further synthetic analogues of trans-dihydronarciclasine (-)-10 and (-)-11 in moderate yields (47%).\n\nIn conclusion, four new synthetic trans-dihydronarciclasine analogues [(-)-8-(-)-11)] containing a relatively rigid 1,4benzodioxane moiety in ring A were synthesised from vanillin using stereo-and enantioselective synthetic routes. These new, optically active derivatives were obtained with excellent enantiomeric purity (99% ee). According to their negative optical rotation values, these compounds appear to be new analogues of (-)-trans-dihydronarciclasine. The preparation of compounds (-)-10 and (-)-11 was due to a side reaction and regioisomer formation, and based on our modified synthesis strategy. Biological evaluations of these potentially anticancerous and antiviral molecules are in progress.\n\nAll reagents are commercially available from Merck.
