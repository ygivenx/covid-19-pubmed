{"title": "Biological Evaluation of Molecules of the azaBINOL Class as Antiviral Agents: 1 Specific Inhibition of HIV-1 RNase H Activity by 7-Isopropoxy-8-(naphth-1-yl)quinoline 2 3 4 5", "body": "HIV/AIDS continues to be a major global health epidemic. In 2017, there were 36.9 million 39 axially chiral dimeric naphthylisoquinolone alkaloids first isolated from Anicistrocladus 84 korupensis in 1991 and later named the michellamines, exhibit selective anti-HIV activity. 15-19 85 Given these facts taken together with the existence of other antiviral biaryl natural products (e.g., 86\n\ndioncophylline 20 ) and recently identified synthetic antiviral drug leads with multiple aromatic 87 ring systems (e.g., arbidol, 21 peptide triazoles, 22 rhodanine derivatives, 23 naphthylhydrazones, 24 88 and hydroxypyridones 25 ), we elected to test a library of heterocyclic biaryl compounds available 89 to us and belonging to the so-called 'azaBINOL' chiral ligand family for inhibition of HIV-1 90\n\nThe azaBINOLs are nitrogenous analogs of BINOL based on isostructural 8-(naphth-1-92 yl)quinoline (2, 8-azaBINOL) 26 These molecules have been a focus of interest both from a fundamental standpoint 26, 30, 31 and for 94 their potential utility in enantioselective synthesis, 32, 33 but prior to this work, studies of any 95 aspect of the biological activity of azaBINOLs had yet to be reported. Herein, we show that 96 deoxy-8-azaBINOL derivatives provide a novel scaffold for the inhibition of HIV-1 RT RNase H 97 activity. Our lead compound, the isopropyl ether derivative of 2'-deoxy-8-azaBINOL (B#24), 98\n\nshows unoptimized low micromolar activity (4-9 \u00b5M range) in an HIV single round infectivity 99 assay as well as in fully infectious viral assays with low cytotoxicity and a selectivity index 100 of 14. 101 typed particles with differing tropism including HXB2, YU2, and 89.6 ( Table 1 ). All six of the 148 azaBINOL compounds showed similar activities across all viral variants. Quinol-type 2\u00b4-deoxy-149 8-azaBINOL ether B#24 in particular showed low micromolar HIV-1 neutralization against each 150 of the strains tested with activity similar to other antiviral drugs such as abacavir. 34 Although the 151 naphthol-type 2-deoxy-8-azaBINOL ether B#59 did show minor antiviral activity at high 152 concentrations, its IC50 was greater than the concentrations tested and significantly larger in 153 comparison to the closely related quinol-type ether B#24, which has an IC50 value of 4 -8 \u00b5M. 154\n\nThe significant difference in antiviral activity of these two regioisomers (B#24 and B#59) hints 155 towards a highly specific and selective mode of inhibition. The corresponding carbamate 156 derivatives of deoxy-8-azaBINOLs, B#43 and B#60, both showed moderate antiviral activity 157 against all three viral strains but with smaller selectivity indices. Again, neither of the 2-deoxy-158 8,8\u00b4-diazaBINOL derivatives, B#57 or B#58, showed any antiviral activity at concentrations up 159 to 200 \u00b5M. 160\n\nNext we used the EASY-HIT full viral infection assay system 35 to test all six isopropyl ether 161 and carbamate azaBINOL derivatives against fully-infectious, replication competent HIV-1LAI 162 (Table 2 ). The quinol-type 2\u00b4-deoxy-8-azaBINOL ether B#24 continued to exhibit low 163 micromolar antiviral activity in the EASY-HIT assay system in accordance with results obtained 164 from the HIVpp assay. Surprisingly, the naphthol-type 2-deoxy-8-azaBINOL ether B#59 165 exhibited increased antiviral activity. The deoxy-8-azaBINOL carbamate derivatives B#43 and 166 B#60 gave similar high micromolar viral neutralization but also displayed comparable 167 cytotoxicity. The analogous 2-deoxy-8,8\u00b4-diazaBINOL compounds, B#57 and B#58, showed no 168 antiviral activity or cytotoxicity at concentrations tested up to 200 \u00b5M. 169\n\nOut of the 41 unique compounds originally screened for anti-HIV-1 activity, one compound, 170 quinol-type 2\u00b4-deoxy-8-azaBINOL ether B#24, stands out with selective antiviral activity and a 171 favorable selectivity index. Small changes to its structure, including moving the isopropyl ether 172 substituent to the naphthyl ring system (B#59), or the introduction of an additional aromatic ring-173 bound nitrogen atom (B#57), results in drastically reduced antiviral activity. While the deoxy-8-174 azaBINOL carbamate derivatives B#43 and B#60 do exhibit antiviral activity in the phenotypic 175 assays, they also show significant cytotoxicity and therefore their apparent antiviral activity is 176 likely due to interference with the cell-based assay. The low micromolar antiviral activity of lead 177 compound B#24 encouraged us to explore its mode-of-action. 178\n\nPromiscuous inhibitors in high-throughput screening endeavors often lead to unproductive 180 identification and development of compounds with non-specific activity. 36 For example, cell-181 based assays requiring a colorimetric out-read can be inhibited through non-specific mechanisms 182 giving false-positive results. 37 The cell-based HIVpp used in this study contains a luciferase 183 reporter out read, so we looked to test the capacity of B#24 to directly inhibit luciferase 184 luminescence in a recombinant luciferase enzyme test (SI Figure 6 ). 38 B#24 showed no inhibition 185 of luciferase activity nor quenching at any concentrations tested verifying that it was not acting 186 on luminescence. Additionally, based on the low solubility and largely hydrophobic surface area 187 of B#24, we sought to probe its ability to inhibit HIV-1 through unspecific aggregation effects. 188\n\nWe tested the ability for B#24 to aggregate at higher concentrations in aqueous conditions via an 189 1 H-NMR dilution study (SI Figure 7) . 39 Five concentrations of B#24 were tested from 200 \u00b5M to 190 12 \u00b5M in 50 mM phosphate buffer made with D2O and 1% DMSO-d6.

The active azaBINOL compound B#24 inhibited all HIV-1 strains tested 197 regardless of their differing viral tropism (HXB2, YU2, and 89.6). This broad inhibition 198 indicated that the antiviral mode-of-action is unlikely to rely on the viral fusion process, as 199 changing the surface glycoprotein does not affect antiviral activity. Additionally, the EASY-HIT temsavir, which loses activity if dosed post viral entry. Instead, B#24 remains active throughout 207 the assay, but exhibits a subtle decrease in antiviral activity between 6-8 hours post infection. 208\n\nNext, we sought to explore viral enzyme interactions directly to verify if B#24 interacts with the 209 HIV RT dual functions (DNA polymerase and/or RNase H activity) or HIV integrase. 210\n\nNNRTI binding to the HIV RT enzyme occurs at a distant, allosteric binding site and the 212 long-distance effects on the RT polymerase activity are well documented. 10 In contrast, inhibitors 213 of the HIV RT enzyme that target its RNase H function directly affect the catalytic side with its 214 All rights reserved.

We screened B#24 for inhibitory 216 activity in recombinant protein-based assays to test for HIV-1 RT and/or integrase antiviral 217 inhibition (Table 3) . AzaBINOL B#24 showed no effect against HIV-1 integrase activity in a 218 commercially available kit (ExpressBio, Frederick, MD) at any concentration tested up to 200 219 \u00b5M. When tested against an HIV-1 RT polymerase assay we observed only weak inhibitory 220 effects for B#24 at concentrations higher than 100 \u00b5M, several orders of magnitude weaker than 221 seen in our cell-based assays. 222\n\nHowever, since RNase H activity, the second catalytic activity of the HIV-1 reverse 223 transcriptase, is not detected in the above RT-polymerase assay, we investigated the effect of 224 B#24 on RNase H activity using a previously reported FRET based approach. 40, 41 Here, we used 225 a pair of oligonucleosides including an 18-mer strand of RNA containing a 3'-fluorescein 226 modification and an 18-mer strand of DNA with a 5'-dabcyl quencher modification. When RNA 227 is cleaved from the RNA/DNA hybrid by RNase H activity, the fluorescent probe is removed 228 from its quenching partner (dabcyl) resulting in fluorescence. We found that B#24 inhibited 229\n\nRNase H activity of HIV RT with an IC50 of 14.2 \u00b5M, within the same range as the low 230 micromolar cell-based assay results ( inhibitors and therefore allow for a more favorable therapeutic window. 8, 9 249\n\nTo show that B#24 inhibits RNase H activity by binding the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase 251 enzyme, we explored direct binding to immobilized HIV-1 RT using bio-layer interferometry 252 (BLI). BLI allows for the real time measurement of binding affinities between ligands and 253 analytes of varying size using single-use, fiber optical sensors. BLI measures association (kon) 254 and dissociation (koff) rates directly from full spectrum wavelength shifts associated with 255 interference pattern changes derived from binding events at a sensors tip to determine binding 256 affinities (KD). 54 Recombinant-wild type HIV-1 p66/p51 RT (NIH Aids Reagents) was 257 immobilized via amine coupling onto BLI biosensors. B#24, selected other azaBINOLs, and 258 control compounds (rilpivirine positive control, raltegravir negative control) were prepared in 1x 259 kinetics buffer at multiple concentrations. Each compound was tested at multiple concentrations, 260 All rights reserved.

The binding curves obtained for B#24 are shown in Figure 5 . In good agreement with 262 cell-based antiviral assays, B#24 shows a concentration-dependent binding to HIV-1 RT. Control 263 compound rilpivirine also showed concentration dependent binding curves while raltegravir, an 264\n\nHIV-1 integrase inhibitor showed no binding at any concentration tested as expected (SI Figure  265 4). Although the acquired KD of 38 \u00b5M associated with B#24 is higher than the IC50 in cell-based 266 assays, it should be noted that the affinity value cannot be directly related to neutralization 267 efficacy, as seen in many high-affinity, non-neutralizing HIV antibodies. [55] [56] [57] No binding was 268 observed for the related azaBINOLs of interest from the compound library (SI Figure 7) . In 269 summary, the BLI binding data obtained reveals a striking correlation between the binding 270 affinity of B#24 towards its target HIV RT and its antiviral activity. 271\n\nRNase H inhibition of HIV-1 RT is an under explored and under-utilized mechanism of 273 inhibition. The azaBINOL compounds reported here represent novel scaffolds that inhibit HIV 274 via an underexplored allosteric mechanism with low toxicity and high specificity. In particular, 275 the isopropyl ether derivative of 2\u00b4-deoxy-8-azaBINOL (B#24) exhibits with potent and specific 276 antiviral activity against HIV RNase H. We utilized time-of-addition experiments and 277 recombinant enzyme assays to show that B#24 specifically inhibits RNase H. In addition, we 278 used BLI to show that B#24 binds to HIV RT via a 1:1 binding mechanism with a binding 279 affinity (KD) of 38 \u00b5M. Although a number of azaBINOL compounds within the screened library 280 were found to have limited solubility in the cell-based assays as expected, aggregation and non-281 specific inhibition was tested thoroughly and can be dismissed for lead compound B#24 (SI Fig  282   6 ,7). 283 All rights reserved.

Future studies are planned to optimize the azaBINOL core structure to increase HIV-1 299 activity by improving HIV-1 binding, solubility, and to reduce cytotoxicity. It is anticipated that 300 the absolute configuration of the biaryl system will influence biological activity but to what 301\n\nextent remains an open question since a majority of the compounds evaluated herein were tested 302 in racemic form only. Work is in progress to determine the configurational stability of 303 compounds such as B#24 and bioassays of these materials in enantioenriched form will be 304 conducted should their racemization half-lives prove to be high enough for such an effort to be 305\n\nAll rights reserved.

Based on the 308\n\nidentified RNase H inhibition, direct HIV-1 RT binding, and the known hydrophobic binding 309 surfaces associated with allosteric inhibiton, 58 we believe that B#24 is a novel allosteric inhibitor 310 of HIV-1 RT-RNase H activity. While biaryl compounds of natural origin have long been known 311 to exhibit significant biological activity, 14, 61 this study suggests that further investigations of the 312 bioactivity of artificial biaryls, designed purely with synthetic utility in mind, are warranted.

All samples were tested in 534 duplicate. Rilpivirine was used as a positive binding control, raltegravir as a negative control. 535\n\nEffects from non-specific binding were removed using double referencing. Residual baseline 536 drift was calculated by fitting the response during baseline periods to an exponential decay and 537 then subtracting this drift. The resulting response curves were globally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir 538 model. 72 All fits were performed using a constrained, non-linear least squares minimization 539 (MATLAB R2018a, lsqnonlin function implementing the trust region reflective algorithm). 540\n\nConstraints on parameters were used to guide convergence away from non-physical parameter 541\n\nvalues, but all constraints were inactive at the converged optimum. A parametric bootstrap 542 analysis was used to compute a 95% confidence interval for the computed KD values, using a 543 normally-distributed error with variance estimated from the sum of squared residuals of the 544 model fit (MATLAB R2018a, 100 iterations). Random noise in response curves was filtered 545 prior to plotting using a smoothing spline (MATLAB R2018a, spaps function). 546\n\nTesting for complexation of B#24 with Mg 2+ ions was carried out following previous 548 protocols with adjustments. 50 In brief, a 1 M stock solution of MgCl2 and a 1 M solution of B#24 549 were prepared in 1:1 ethanol/acetonitrile mixtures. B#24 was diluted to 100 \u00b5M and UV 550 absorbance readings recorded using a BioTek synergy plate reader from 200 -400 nm. 10 \u00b5L 551 additions of a 500 mM Mg 2+ solution containing 100 \u00b5M B#24 (to keep compound concentration 552 consistent) was added stepwise followed by absorbance readings between each addition. The 553 concentration of Mg 2+ was raised with each addition from 0.5 mM to 120 mM. Alignment, 554 reference subtraction of blanks, and plotting were done on raw data using Microsoft Excel. 555\n\nAll rights reserved.

Preliminary experiments established the concentration of luciferin to be used in the 561 assay in order to closely mimic the protein signal in single-round infectivity assay and give 562 maximal sensitivity in luminescence readings. Reactions were carried out in white 96 well-plates 563 (Gibco; ThermoFisher Scientific) by combining compounds with 0.5 \u00b5g/mL recombinant 564 luciferase in 1x PBS buffer and 1 mg/mL BSA (VWR). Reactions were initiated by the addition 565 of 30 \u00b5L luciferin substrate to wells. Luminescence readings were immediately recorded and 566 normalized using appropriate controls with vehicle solvent (1% DMSO).

To assess if the antiviral activity from the active azaBINOL 572 compound B#24 could be due to non-specific aggregation effects, an 1 H-NMR assay was 573 implemented to characterize compound behavior in aqueous conditions as described 574\n\npreviously. 39 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/525105 doi: bioRxiv preprint MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5mm TCI cryoprobe.
