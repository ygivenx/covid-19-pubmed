{"title": "Evidence for a crucial role of a host non-coding RNA in influenza A virus replication", "body": "The surprising observation that only 1.5% of the mammalian genome is protein coding and the identification of vast numbers of non-protein coding transcripts in large-scale transcriptomic studies initiated a debate about the role of ncRNAs in cell biology. 1 It has been speculated that in contrast to protein coding genes, the non-coding portion of a genome correlates with organism complexity and functions in crucial regulatory processes. 2, 3 With a length of ~22 nucleotides, microRNAs (miRNAs) constitute the best-studied class of small regulatory RNAs and have assigned functions in several cellular processes, including development, proliferation, and disease. 4, 5 However, recent identification and characterization of lncRNAs indicate a more complex cell regulatory network than previously anticipated. So far, lncRNAs are categorized as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not contain a significant open reading frame but are often polyadenylated and spliced. 6 The genomic origin of lncRNAs is manifold, including intergenic, intronic, gene-overlapping, or antisense transcription. Although only a few have been characterized in detail, their functional repertoire is expanding. Several studies have revealed that lncRNAs are important for gene regulation, 7, 8 such as XIST, which regulates dosage compensation of the mammalian X chromosome. 9 Mechanisms of lncRNA action are diverse and they are involved in widespread biological processes like imprinting, pluripotency, cell differentiation, development, apoptosis, and development of disease. 5 However, although infection is considered a major driving force of human genome evolution, little is known about potential roles of lncRNAs in this context. Recently, transcriptome-wide deep sequencing revealed the differential expression of more than a thousand potential lncRNAs during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in mice, indicative of a function in infection. 10 Several of these mouse lncRNAs were shown to be similarly regulated upon infection with IAV, a highly contagious virus causing annual epidemics and frequent pandemic outbreaks. 11 To understand the process of IAV infection in humans and develop new antiviral strategies, genome-wide studies have aimed to identify host cell proteins necessary for productive IAV replication. 12, 13 Host cell miRNAs are known to be differentially regulated by IAV and implicated in control of infection outcome, 14, 15 whereas the functional significance of lncRNA expression during IAV infection remains elusive.\n\nWe addressed this question based on differential expression analysis of human lncRNAs during influenza A/WSN/33 infection, using NCode\u2122 and Sureprint\u2122 G3 microarrays. We show that expression of virus inducible lincRNA (VIN), a highly regulated lncRNA during A/WSN/33 infection, is specifically induced during infection with different IAV strains and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) but not with influenza B virus (IBV). We further demonstrate a confined nuclear expression of VIN. Analysis of A/WSN/33 replication in VIN-knockdown cells revealed a significant decrease of viral titers, thus highlighting the role of the non-protein coding human genome during infectious disease.\n\nCommercially available microarray systems such as NCode\u2122 and Sureprint\u2122 G3 contain probe sequences that incorporate ncRNAs from a variety of classes. In addition to proteincoding genes, NCode\u2122 contains probe sequences of uncharacterized transcripts identified in cDNA and EST sequencing projects in addition to predicted functional ncRNA genes. Besides other noncoding RNA classes, the Sureprint\u2122 G3 annotation is mainly based on human lincRNAs identified during ChIP-seq projects. Due to differences in nomenclature and annotation of both microarrays, NCode\u2122 and Sureprint\u2122 G3 ncRNA probe sequences were re-annotated using the current Ensembl Genome Annotation (Release 68). According to the latest sequence information, microarrays were uniformly annotated to enable cross-platform comparison. Re-annotation revealed the relative contributions of different ncRNA classes to ncRNA probes represented on these microarrays (Fig. 1A) , and demonstrated that on NCode\u2122 and Sureprint\u2122 G3 microarrays, respectively, small RNA, uncharacterized miscellaneous RNA, and gene-overlapping RNA made up relatively minor proportions of probes, whereas pseudogene, antisense RNA, and lincRNA probes made up higher proportions. From the 3415 (NCode\u2122) and 3201 (Sureprint\u2122 G3) probes representing non-coding transcripts, 1342 (~40%) were common to both microarray systems (Fig. 1A) .\n\nWe used the re-annotated arrays to investigate potential infection-induced changes to lncRNA expression patterns at 8 h and 24 h post-infection (p.i.) with the influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in A549 lung The contributions of different ncRNA classes on Ncode\u2122 and sureprint\u2122 G3 microarrays alone and common to both are shown. Re-annotation of microarrays was performed according to ensembl human genome annotation (Release 68). (B) A549 cells were infected with influenza A/ WsN/33 (h1N1) virus (MOI 1) for 8 or 24 h. columns 1-4: log2-fold expression change of 17 lincRNAs (labeled by ensembl transcript ID) that were differentially regulated at least 2-fold between uninfected and infected samples at both time points using Ncode\u2122 and sureprint\u2122 G3 microarrays. columns 5-6: regulation of lincRNA expression by UV-treated, infected cell supernatants. epithelial cells. To avoid platform-specific effects, we focused our analysis on ncRNAs represented on both platforms. The expression of the known antiviral genes myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) and 2'-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL), as well as several other interferon (IFN)-inducible genes, was upregulated on microarrays, which confirmed successful infection in this system (Fig. S1) . In addition to protein-coding transcripts, the transcription of 42 ncRNAs common to both microarrays was up-or downregulated at least 2-fold upon infection, at both time points (Fig. S2) . As expected, the distribution of the differentially regulated non-coding RNA genes in both microarray systems mirrored the distribution of the represented ncRNA classes. Thus, the most abundantly represented class was lincRNAs, which are listed in Figure 1B . Following preliminary microarray re-annotation and data analysis, the differential expression of some lncRNA transcripts was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription (qRT) PCR (Fig. S3) .\n\nTo further investigate the nature of the infection-induced regulation of ncRNA expression, we exposed infected cell supernatants to ultraviolet light to inactivate virions ( Fig. S4A and B). Non-infected cells were then treated with supernatants and extracted RNA applied to Sureprint\u2122 G3 microarrays. IFNinducible genes were differentially regulated following incubation with UV-treated supernatants (Fig. S4C) . However, lncRNA expression, including the subset of 17 lincRNAs induced 8 h and 24 h p.i., was not affected (Fig. 1B) . Thus, several lncRNA classes were differentially regulated during infection in response to intact viruses, not as the indirect result of soluble factors released by infected cells.\n\nThe non-coding transcript ENST00000412690 was among the most highly induced lincRNAs in the microarray analyses, a finding confirmed by qRT-PCR ( Fig. 1B; Fig. S3 ). We focused on this annotated transcript, hereafter called VIN, for further functional analyses. To check if other viruses can also alter its expression, two additional IAV strains were selected, one IBV strain and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-a nonsegmented negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus. The levels of VIN expression in cells infected with the IAV strains A/ Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and A/FPV/Bratislava/79 (H7N7) increased approximately 30-60-fold, compared with 10-fold increased levels in A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus-infected cells at 6 h p.i. (Fig. 2A) . Interestingly, a similar level of expression was induced following infection with VSV but not with the IBV strain B/Brisbane/60/08. Infection with all tested viruses yielded a cell infection rate between 50-70%, excluding the possibility that different infectivities adversely affected VIN expression (Fig. S5) . qRT-PCR time course investigations over 8 h suggested that infection-induced expression of VIN increased during late infection [VSV and A/WSN/33 (H1N1); Fig. S6 ]. In line with initial investigations at 6 h p.i. (Fig. 2A) , IBV infection failed to induce VIN expression at all time points investigated (Fig. S6) .\n\nTo investigate whether the factor responsible for induction of VIN was viral RNA, we treated A549 cells with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)-a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA commonly used to mimic viral RNA intermediates that are present during virus infection. A wide range of poly I:C concentrations failed to induce VIN expression, whereas expression of IFN\u03b2 increased in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B) . In line with experiments using UV-inactivated supernatants, treatment with IFN\u03b2 at a range of concentrations did not induce VIN expression, although upregulation of the known IFN\u03b2 target gene, MX1, was successfully demonstrated in this system (Fig. 2C) .\n\nTo summarize, VIN expression was induced upon infection with a number of IAV viruses, and also after infection with VSV, suggesting that this lincRNA may have broader functionality during virus infection. However, since IBV, viral RNA mimics, or IFN\u03b2 are not able to induce VIN, this induction is likely to be a specific response and not due the presence of viral RNA itself.\n\nIn silico characterization of VIN LncRNAs have only recently been identified and recognized for their pivotal roles in biology, and accordingly, the characterization of these ncRNAs is a developing field. 16, 17 Bioinformatic analyses of predicted lncRNAs can provide valuable information to help functionally characterize predicted lncRNAs. 18, 19 The VIN gene is located ~90 kbp downstream of the ACTR3 protein coding gene on the forward strand of chromosome 2 and the transcript is annotated as an intergenic 844 base pair non-coding RNA [Ensembl ENST00000412690 (Release 68); RefSeq LOC440900] (Fig. 3A) . UCSC genome browser analysis revealed the presence of high methylation levels of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me) and acetylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27ac) upstream of VIN, markers for transcriptional activation 20 (Fig. 3A) . Together with the clustering of several transcription factor binding sites in this region and the presence of a CpG island, this supports the notion that VIN is actively transcribed (Fig. 3A) . Several other databases, including the recently released LNCipedia compendium, also list VIN as non-coding RNA. 21 This database classifies long non-coding transcripts according to Coding Potential Calculator (CPC) analysis. This algorithm takes multiple features such as peptide length, amino acid composition, secondary structure, and protein homology into consideration. 22 Like the majority of identified lncRNAs, 6,23 VIN is encoded by two exons and contains a 3\u2032-polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA).\n\nIn silico prediction of lncRNA secondary structure is another useful method to assign putative functions to non-coding transcripts, based upon the widely held assumption that highly folded structures impart functionality through binding interactions with proteins/nucleotides. [24] [25] [26] Characterization of VIN using RNAfold minimum free energy estimations predicted a highly folded secondary structure with several hairpin loops (Fig. 3B) . 27 Interestingly, unlike GAPDH mRNA, VIN was largely insensitive to endonuclease A (RNase A) digestion (Fig. 3C) . Since RNase A preferentially cleaves single-stranded RNA, this supported the idea that VIN adopts stable secondary structures, and thus, has a functional role in cells, perhaps in complex with other cellular components. \n\nIn addition to sequence and structural information, defining subcellular distributions of lncRNAs can also help assign function. RNA fractionation experiments revealed that VIN was more abundant in the nuclear RNA fraction of A549 cells compared with the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 4A) . The enrichment of VIN in the nuclear fraction was similar to that for the RNU1-1 nuclear RNA, whereas GAPDH mRNA was distributed approximately equally in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Western blotting with antibodies specific for the cytoplasmic 14-3-3 proteins and the nuclear protein Lamin A/C confirmed that fractionation was successful (Fig. S7) . RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) was performed to further investigate the subcellular localization of VIN. Mockand A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus-infected A549 cells were probed with a VIN-specific digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA oligonucleotide. In uninfected A549 cells, a faint diffuse but nuclear DIG signal was observed (Fig. 4B, panel 1) , which increased upon infection with A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus (Fig. 4B, panel  2) . The specificity of RNA-FISH was determined via hybridization of probes targeting nuclear RNU1-1 and the ubiquitously distributed GAPDH mRNA (Fig. S8A, panels 1 and 2) . A control condition without applying any probe showed that signals detected in the Cy2 channel were not influenced by simultaneous staining of viral nucleoprotein (NP) with Cy3 (Fig. S8A,  panel 3 ). In addition, knockdown of VIN by siRNAs decreased the nuclear DIG signal (Fig. S8B) , confirming the specificity of RNA-FISH probes. The observation that nuclear NP levels were decreased in cells depleted of VIN prompted us to hypothesize that VIN expression affected virus protein expression, potentially supporting viral infectivity.\n\nTo determine its role during productive A/WSN/33 infection, we analyzed viral replication upon knockdown of VIN.\n\nA549 cells were transfected with VIN-targeted siRNAs, followed by A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus infection. Virus replication was allowed to occur for 48 h, thereafter virus-containing supernatants were titrated onto MDCK cells. After an additional 6 h of infection, immunofluorescence analysis was performed and influenza A NP-positive MDCK cells were counted to quantify infection. Viral titers of the titrated cell supernatants were calculated according to infectivity rates. Notably, knockdown with three different siRNAs individually and in conjunction (approx. 60% knockdown efficiency, Fig. S9A) , reduced viral titers more than 10-fold compared with Allstars siRNA-treated control cells ( Fig. 5A and B) , highlighting the importance of VIN for productive IAV infection. Furthermore, the expression of key viral proteins was reduced in VIN-knockdown cells compared with Allstars siRNA-treated control cells, which confirms the observation that it is required for the H1N1 viral lifecycle (Fig. 5C) . Cell viability (Fig. S9B) and type I IFN response (Fig. S9C) were unchanged in knockdown cells, and thus, could not have caused decreased virus titers indirectly. These data demonstrate that VIN expression supports completion of the IAV lifecycle, and thus, viral propagation.\n\nRecent advances in genome and transcriptome sequencing revealed the expression of a high proportion of uncharacterized and mainly non protein-coding RNAs. 1 The tightly controlled transcription of lncRNAs and the fact that they appear to play a role in many tissues, 28 highlights their potential in regulating important aspects of the cellular machinery. Research into hostpathogen interactions has so far focused mostly on host cell proteins 12, 13, 29 and not yet considered the role of lncRNAs in detail. Given that small ncRNAs such as miRNAs 14, 15, 30, 31 have already been shown to have important functions during the host cell response to infections, it is likely that lncRNAs also play important roles. We identified the lincRNA VIN as an essential player during IAV replication, showing a more than 10-fold decrease of IAV titer upon VIN knockdown. Viruses are known to hijack the host cellular machinery for their own replication and suppress antiviral responses by a variety of mechanisms. The relevance of host cell factors during IAV replication has been previously identified, revealing the involvement of several cellular networks in IAV replication. 12, 29, 32, 33 Since these processes need tight control to ensure successful virus propagation, we propose a role for VIN in gene expression control during IAV infection.\n\nWe identified VIN as differentially expressed during influenza A/WSN/33 virus infection using NCode\u2122 and Sureprint G3\u2122 microarrays. Interestingly, dynamic changes in expression levels of lncRNAs have been identified upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation of macrophages, demonstrating the importance of lncRNAs during immune surveillance. 34 The first report about lncRNAs in the context of viral infections showed induction of a lncRNA upon Japanese encephalitis and rabies virus infection in mice. 35 More recently, a high-throughput sequencing approach described the differential lncRNA transcriptome upon SARS-CoV infection in mice and regulation of some of these lncRNAs was confirmed in IAV infection and upon IFN\u03b2 treatment. 10 In contrast, regulation of lncRNAs was mainly dependent on the presence of infectious virus in our system, comparing infection of live and inactivated IAV viruses in human cells.\n\nStrikingly, we show that VIN expression is not affected by viruses in general, viral RNA, or the type I IFN response. Instead, it is induced only by specific viruses, which may be related to differences in virulence. Notably, the induction levels of VIN observed here mirror the different pandemic potential of IAV strains, 11 with H7N7 being more pathogenic than H1N1 and H3N2. Differences in the protein repertoire encoded by VSV, IAV, and IBV, or differential host cell signaling during infection, could also be responsible for distinct VIN regulation profiles. 36, 37 However, the contribution of virus-specific factors on VIN expression, and the function of VIN during VSV and IBV infection, will need further investigation.\n\nSimilarly to many other characterized lncRNAs, 38,39 our data suggest nuclear localization of VIN. Nuclear lncRNAs have been implicated in the maintenance of sub-nuclear architecture, 40 direct transcriptional regulation, 41 post-transcriptional control, 42 and chromatin remodeling. 8 However, it remains to be demonstrated which function VIN conducts in the nucleus of IAV-infected cells. In silico secondary structure analysis and RNase A sensitivity analyses suggest that VIN folds into highly stable structures that may reflect its function, perhaps in complex with other cellular components. Gene regulatory functions of lncRNAs have already been proposed during immune responses. 43 The Th1selective lincRNA NeST, by acting as an enhancer RNA, contributes to IFN\u03b3 expression, thereby controlling susceptibility to bacterial and viral pathogens. 44, 45 In contrast, lncRNAs repressing antiviral or enhancing proviral gene expression might aid in supporting viral replication, rendering them interesting targets for the development of new host-directed antiviral strategies.\n\nHere, we identified the first human lncRNA, which functions in IAV propagation. Induction of VIN expression was observed in different virus infections, and VIN loss-of-function analysis revealed its importance during productive IAV replication. Nuclear expression of VIN suggests an involvement in gene-regulatory processes and our observation that VIN is functionally relevant during pathogenesis of IAV infection strengthens the view that lncRNAs are major players in diverse biological processes. Elucidating the mechanism of VIN action in more detail will broaden our understanding of lncRNAs in general and their implications in fighting infectious disease. \n\nCells were washed with PBS and then infected with viruses at the indicated MOIs in infection buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated for the indicated time periods at 37 \u00b0C in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 4 mM l-glutamine, and 100U/ml penicillin-streptomycin.\n\nMicroarray experiments were performed with dual-color hybridizations and independent dye-reversal color swap was applied to compensate for dye-specific effects. Quality control and quantification of total RNA was assessed using a NanoDrop 1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Kisker) and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). RNA labeling was performed with the Low RNA Input Linear Amplification Kit PLUS (Agilent Technologies). In brief, mRNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using an oligo-dT-T7 promoter primer, and cRNA was subsequently labeled with Cyanine 3-CTP or Cyanine 5-CTP. After precipitation and purification, 1.25 \u03bcg of each labeled cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to NCode\u2122 Human Non-coding RNA Microarray (NCRAH, Invitrogen) or SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray (G4851B, Agilent) according to the supplier's protocol. Scanning of microarrays was performed with 5 \u03bcm resolution using a G2565CA Re-annotation of microarrays was performed by BLAST analysis of 60mer oligonucleotide probe sequences from NCode\u2122 and Sureprint\u2122 G3 microarrays against the Ensembl human genome annotation (Release 68). Criterion for annotation was an unambiguous match to a transcript (minimum 95% identity). Omitting protein-coding genes and redundantly represented genes, probe sequences covered 3415 and 3201 unique ncRNAs on NCode\u2122 and Sureprint\u2122 G3, respectively.\n\nRNA isolation and qRT-PCR Total RNA was isolated by the TRIzol (Invitrogen) method or RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed with the one-step SYBR-green method using the RNA-to-Ct assay in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). One hundred nanograms of RNA were used for each reaction. Relative expression levels were determined by applying the \u0394\u0394Ct method using GAPDH as endogenous control and normalization to mock-treated cells. Primer sequences are given in Table 2. RNA fractionation 6 \u00d7 10 5 cells were washed in 3 ml RSB (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4; 10 mM NaCl; 3 mM MgCl2) and lysed in 500 \u03bcl RSBG40 (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4; 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2; 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonident P-40; 0.5 mM dithiothreitol [DTT] , and 100 U/ml rRNAsin [Promega]). After 10 min incubation on ice, nuclei were pelleted at 7000 rpm for 3 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was recovered as cytoplasmic fraction. Nuclear pellets were resuspended two times in 200 \u03bcl RSBG40, incubated on ice for 5 min, pelleted, and cytoplasmic fractions pooled. Trizol was added to nuclei and cytoplasmic fractions and RNA and protein extracted following the Trizol procedure.\n\nFor immunoblotting, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 1 \u00d7 SDS sample buffer containing 75 mM TRIS-HCl (pH 6.8), 25% glycerol, 0.6% SDS, 7.5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromophenol blue. Protein lysates were loaded and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and detected using antibodies depicted in Table 1 . Staining was performed with ECL western blotting detection reagent (Amersham).\n\nCells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, rinsed in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100/ 5mM Vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (VRC, NEBiolabs) on ice for 10 min. Following 3x washes in PBS and 2 \u00d7 SSC for 10 min, cells on coverslips were pre-hybridized for 1 h at RT (20% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 10% 20\u00d7SSC, 120 \u03bcg yeast tRNA, 0.5 \u03bcl rRNasin). In vitro-transcribed (Ambion MEGAscript T7) Digoxigenin-11-UTP (Roche)-labeled RNA hybridization probes were generated via cloning of GAPDH, RNU1-1, and VIN-specific sequences into pGEMT-Easy (Promega) (primer sequences Table 2 ). Cells were covered with 2\u00d7 SSC, heated for 4 min at 95 \u00b0C and incubated with denatured probes in hybridization buffer (20% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 10% 20x SSC, 100 g yeast tRNA, 0.5 \u03bcl rRNasin) in a humidified chamber at 37 \u00b0C overnight. Stringency washes were performed three times with 2\u00d7 SSC/ 50% formamide at 37 \u00b0C, three times with 2\u00d7 SSC at 42 \u00b0C, three times with 1\u00d7 SSC at 42 \u00b0C, and one time with 4\u00d7 SSC at room temperature. For immunofluorescence labeling, cells were permeabilized with 4\u00d7 SSC/0.1% Triton, blocked, and incubated with mouse anti-digoxigenin IgG (Roche, 1:100) for 1 h. After washing, secondary antibody staining was performed with Cy2-rabbitanti-mouse IgG (315-225-003, Dianova) and Draq5 (Thermo Scientific, 62252) for 1 h. Influenza Nucleoprotein (NP-Cy3 conjugate) staining was subsequently applied. After washing, coverslips were mounted using Mowiol (Sigma, 324590).
