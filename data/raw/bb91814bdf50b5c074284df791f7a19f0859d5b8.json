{"title": "Syndromic surveillance using web data: a systematic review", "body": "and the peak of influenza in the United States. Since then, various researches have been conducted with the help of web data (social media, search engines, etc.) to establish the fundamentals of internet surveillance systems. This novel approach deals with the implementation of information systems based on data from the web to track epidemics and to create patterns and rules for an early prediction. Across all over the world, at universities, organizations, or research centers, scientists study the potential of the web in epidemics. Except from various information systems and methods created for data analysis of the web data, new terms were introduced to describe this new approach and trend, such as Infoveillance or Infodemiology Spruit & Lytras, 2018) .\n\nIn this study, we examine the publications until the year of 2018. This examination was applied on an initial collection of 337 published items, of which 225 were found to be relevant. These publications consist of many different types. Most of them (86.22%) are published articles based on researches from various organizations, universities, or research centers which study the fields of syndromic surveillance or monitor epidemics. Other publications are based on dissertations, conference announcements, reviews or systematic reviews of articles, books, and one Google patent. In Fig. 2 .1, we can see these types and their percentage in relation to the sum of the published items.\n\nAs we can see in Fig. 2 .1, most of the publications are published articles. Nevertheless, we allocated 19 reviews or systematic reviews.\n\nWith this work we try to give a detailed analysis of the works published by identifying the most relevant ones, concerning syndromic surveillance using the Web, presenting the biggest collection of related articles ever made on this subject. By using the methodology of systematic review, there is an in-depth description and analysis of the main areas covered by these publications: the time (year) they were published, the diseases that were examined, the web data sources used by the researchers, the countries in which these diseases were spread, the approaches of the data analysis used by the scientists, and finally, the number of scientists that have worked until now. The detailed analysis refers to 225 relevant publications that were extracted from the online database of Google Scholar (2018) , which is a powerful tool for every researcher.\n\nTo conduct this review, we used a variation of the PRISMA statements methodology (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, & Altman, 2009 ) and we also examine the previous reviews or systematic reviews. We identified 19 previous reviews that were conducted to analyze various articles in the previous years. Of the total reviews, most of them focus on the influenza disease or other diseases, while others examine epidemics using web data in a more general way. We consider the work of Rattanaumpawan, Boonyasiri, Vong, and Thamlikitkul (2018) as the one with the biggest collection of articles, 110 in total, without ignoring of course the good work that has been done by other scientists who conducted reviews.\n\nConsidering the above, this study is a both quantitative and qualitative analysis, and the aims of this review are:\n\n1. To make a complete collection of articles, related to syndromic surveillance using web, available to any researcher. 2. To investigate the academic interest on this field, based on the number of published items every year. Is this growing or declining? 3. To analyze other aspects, such as the epidemic characteristics (diseases), the geographical spread of the researches and researchers, the used data, and the way the data analysis is described in these reteaches. 4. To estimate and evaluate what areas has been explored so far and what could be the possible research in the future. 5. To elaborate a novel way of systematic review on this research field that can help in deciding the importance of this research field. 6. To showcase, evaluate and align the results to the new Smart Healthcare technologies\n\nOur research took place from May 1 to June 30, 2018. The research model used was a variation of the PRISMA model, including a research protocol, which was created for this purpose and consists of five research stages plus a writing phase. The five stages are as follows: preparation, data retrieval, data analysis, data synthesis, and results. Below, we briefly present each stage.\n\nThe preparation stage includes all the necessary decisions and tools to be used, such as the scope, the method designing, and the research questions. The definitions of the methods, appropriate for the implementation of this research was critical, meaning that it should be decided at first.\n\nThree research questions were created to examine and understand the current literature regarding syndromic surveillance using the Web. The motivation of this review is to categorize and summarize the previous work that has been done until today and find the explored and unexplored areas toward a future work. These questions are as follows:\n\nRQ1: Is the academic interest growing or declining? To answer this question, we must base on the current literature and examine this in a yearly basis. RQ2: What aspects have been explored until now in the available literature? In addition, it is useful to understand which areas are underexplored. Generally, there is a very wide field of research, since there are lots of diseases and lots of countries, which can be researched. With this question, we are seeking what has been researched and at what extend. So, the next research question should be as follows: RQ3: What topics have been covered and which ones need further development and research in the future? This stage was concluded with some sample data that were gathered to help in finalizing the methods and tools needed to complete this research.\n\nThe present review has gone through with the help of the search queries that were inserted in the Google Scholar search engine. The criterion for the relevance of publications is whether each one includes the following keywords in the analysis, or the variants of them: syndromic surveillance OR detecting epidemics AND using web.\n\nWe conducted an extensive search through Google Scholar for research papers, articles, books, dissertations, reports, and conference presentations. The main keywords (which were expected to be prevalent in the relevant papers) were syndromic surveillance, predicting epidemics, and using web. These keywords are generally broad terms, while some others, more specific, were used such as Google, Twitter, Yahoo, or Web. There were two final search strings (for each of the two searches made) and can be expressed in one Boolean statement as follows:\n\n\u00f0\u00f0A OR B\u00de AND \u00f0C1 OR C2 OR C3 OR C4\u00de\u00de where A, syndromic surveillance; B, predicting epidemics; C1, using Web; C2, Google; C3, Yahoo; C4, Twitter.\n\nThe search strategy contained the following design decisions:\n\nSearched databases: Google Scholar, which contains articles from Springer Link, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, etc.\n\nSearched items: Journal articles, conference papers, workshop papers, technical reports, books reviews, and dissertations. Search applied on: Full text, to avoid exclusion of papers that didn't include the searched keywords in abstracts or titles or used a different variant of the terms but were relevant for this review. Language: The search was limited to papers written in English. All other languages are excluded. Publication period: All years (2004\u00c018). Syndromic surveillance using web started to receive attention after 2004, as already mentioned. Therefore the chosen publication period is set to be since 2004. The outcome of the search process resulted a total of 225 relevant papers, of which 19 are relevant reviews or systematic reviews.\n\nThe data were retrieved in a period of two weeks and initially included 337 published items, possible to be eligible in the review. All needed information was entered in a centralized Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for further analysis, as follows.\n\nThe objective of the study selection was to identify papers relevant to the objectives of the review, according to the agreed scope. The search strings were set to avoid excluding relevant studies in a relatively small category or when some data were missing, for example, when there was a research using web data, but not for a specific disease. In addition, some articles were entered twice, since there were present in each one of the queries entered in the Google Scholar search engine.\n\nDuring this phase, extensive analysis (quantitative and qualitative) has been done regarding the information gathered from the reviewed papers and articles. This was necessary for supporting data categorization and data synthesis. Our goal was to summarize, in a quantitative way, the main areas of research related to syndromic surveillance using web data. These quantitative summaries have been included in the results section, assisted with graphs that are supplemented by the references to the included papers.\n\nThe statistical analysis has been performed in all areas concerned with the synthesis of the studies that were identified. We used multiple perspectives to indicate interesting relationships and trends within the reviewed articles, since the available literature is not limited. By doing so, we believe that a scientist can better understand the perspectives and the trends of this type of research that has been conducted and goes into depth, finding interesting questions and views of the research field, potentially for a future work. The classification of the results includes the required characteristics to summarize, include or exclude features, to help the synthesis, and finally, the proper evaluation of all the researches included in this review.\n\nThis stage includes the outcomes of this research. The scope is not only to compare the previous published research to each other, but also to determine the importance of the research field of syndromic surveillance using web data.\n\nThe final stage is to write the procedures and results of this extensive research. This stage consists of all the procedures taken place during this research and we present them all in a way that helps in understanding each stage. The entire research model can be briefly described in Fig. 2 .2. \n\nIn this section, the results of this systematic review are presented based on the 225 papers that are relevant to the examined subject and finally selected.\n\n2.3.1 RQ1: Is the academic interest growing or declining?\n\nTo be able to answer this question, we must see the development of the articles and other items that were published each year from 2004. That means that we must find when these publications were made and determine the trend.\n\nThe first (relevant) one is published in 2004 and concerns the study of Johnson et al. (2004) , while the last one was published in 2018. Many studies occurred after 2009 as a result of the 2009 influenza pandemic. A lot of articles refer to influenza and particularly to the H1N1 virus that was responsible for many cases with severe symptoms during that year. This virus type has an unusual characteristic: it does not affect people over 60 years old but many young people, adults, and children. This virus type can lead to pneumonia if not early diagnosed and treated. The term swine flu was used by the news media in America and a lot of money were directed to the treatment of this disease. For instance, in Russia, the government has allocated 4 billion rubles (US$140 million) to buy the initial 43 million doses of vaccines, to perform In Fig. 2 .3, the thicker line represents the number of publications per year, while the dotted thinner line represents the trend, as it was calculated from the following polynomial formula:\n\ny 5 0:3042x 2 2 1:3639x 1 2:7626\n\nwhere y is the expected number of publications and x is the current year-2003\n\nMost articles per year are observed in 2017 (50 articles), but from 2013 until 2017, each year over 20 articles have been published regarding syndromic surveillance using the Web, except from the year 2015, in which we observe 12 publications. It seems that many scientists, research centers, or organizations appreciate the usability of the Web to provide data and tools for monitoring epidemics and outbreaks when they are effectively used along with the science of statistics. During the year 2018, we have allocated only 20 articles, but this is normal since this systematic review is conducted in June 15, 2018. As a result, the number of publications for the year 2018 is calculated as 50, using the abovementioned formula.\n\nThe results of this analysis answers to the first research question that the academic interest grows over time. Health issues are widely discussed in this research field as it is critical for modeling and predicting purposes concerning public health. Of the 225 publications, 161 (71.55%) refer explicitly to one or more health subject or disease.\n\nSome researchers conducted researches for more than one health subject (6.22%), while others focused on one disease (65.33%). There is a relatively large percentage of researches that did not examine specific diseases, but the syndromic surveillance generally (28.45%). Table 2 .1 includes all cases.\n\nThe relative % column indicates the percentage of the publications containing at least one health subject/disease. As we can see in this table, 103 published articles are related exclusively to influenza (45.78%, relative percentage 63.98%), 10 articles are about dengue, 5 articles are about HIV/AIDS, 4 articles are about malaria, 4 articles about cancer or breast cancer, and 3 articles about Ebola exclusively. There are also two references for foodborne illnesses and two for hand, foot, and mouth epidemics. Other health subjects are discussed once, such as the African swine fever, malaria, Lyme disease, listeria, foodborne illness, Ebola, depression, dementia, communicable diseases, cholera, human papillomavirus, measles, respiratory syncytial virus, syphilis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. As we see, not all the abovementioned are diseases that can be transmitted, although depression is s special case of psychological phenomenon (disorder) related to individuals. However, regarding public health, the research revealed that the Web can be a useful source of data for other nontransmitted diseases or disorders as cancer , or depression (Yang, Huang, Peng, & Tsai, 2010) . There are also articles which examine more than one disease and we include them separately in the table. Such cases are influenza and listeria, influenza and pertussis, cholera and dengue, influenza, cholera and rabies virus, influenza and dengue, and influenza and tuberculosis. Three studies include more than three diseases in their area of examination.\n\nAnother aspect is the keywords used to retrieve data from the internet for those researchers who have built specific databases for this purpose. In 78 studies, the scientists used as a search term, the name of the disease, in the language of the country they examined or using the English-speaking terms. Others used the words for their symptoms or other keywords, for example, \"cold\" to detect influenza, based both on the weather conditions of this common disease and on social media (Shikha, Younghee, & Mihui, 2017) . Weather is an important factor for the development of epidemics and we will come back to this matter, since there are some researches from scientists that are classified as relevant. We will further discuss the potential of weather forecast to help syndromic surveillance using the Web.\n\nA major aspect is where the relevant published researches have been conducted, but also which regions or countries of the earth these researches concern. We may assume that there is a similarity between these two aspects, since it is usual for a study to be made in the United States, for the United States. This is only a general rule applied to most publications, but there are exceptions. For instance, a scientist in Italy conducts a research about Africa. Such a case is the study of Alicino et al. (2015) , which examines the spread of Ebola virus in West Africa based on the findings of the researchers from the University of Genoa (Italy). In our case, we believe that it is more appropriate to analyze the geographical location that has been under research with the use of the internet. This is important, taking into account that the use of internet is globally available and this makes easy for data to be accessed by people in almost all countries of the world. Fig. 2 .4 shows explicitly the geographic regions from which surveillance data were used.\n\nIn this figure we can see that the most explored region is North America with 105 publications. This occurs since most researchers originated from the countries of the United States and Canada, but also some other scientists have conducted researches for these countries, especially for the United States. It is important to notice that for Africa, there are only four studies conducted for the countries of West Africa (Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea) for Ebola virus, since this virus is generally very common in the regions of Africa.\n\nFor Europe, there are 41 publications and for Asia 49. For Asia, 17 of the articles concern China. For Oceania (Australia and New Zealand), there are eight publications, while for South America we found six publications. For Central America and Caribbean, only one publication has been made, referring to Haiti.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that eleven publications are made, examining more than one geographical region, for example, a study was made using data for Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom (England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland), and the United States (Paul, Dredze, Broniatowski, & Generous, 2015) . In the regional analysis, we separate the regions that were exclusively studied, while there are eleven publications concerning countries more than one. Another example is a study for Australia, Canada, and Ireland, regions quite different to each other, but they are included in one article. Other publications concern the United States and Australia or Brazil, Ukraine, Turkey, and Venezuela. We see that, in the last case, there are four countries belonging to two different geographical continents, South America and Europe. The above observations mean that the current publications concern all the continents of the world, except from Antarctica and the North Pole, since very few people live there. It is also interesting to locate the countries, where the research has been conducted. All 225 researches were conducted in 32 countries. Most of the studies (102) were made in the United States. In the second place, far away, we find China with 19 publications, and the third place is taken by the United Kingdom with 18. Australia and Italy have nine publication each one. The complete list of countries is shown in Table 2 .2.\n\nFrom Europe, there are totally 47 publication from 9 countries on this research field. Surprisingly, Central Europe does not have too many publications, as Germany has none and France only three. In Europe, there are totally nine countries, in which researches are made: Denmark (5), France (3), Italy (9), Netherlands (2), Norway (1), Portugal (2), Spain (4), Sweden (3), and United Kingdom (18). On the contrast, it is quite interesting that countries, which are not considered as very developed or they are very small, have at least one publication, such as Madagascar, Pakistan, Philippines, and Thailand.\n\nScientists referred to or use various sources of data from the web for their experiments or/ and their analysis. We have found 169 different web sources that were used. The most popular is Twitter, as shown in Fig. 2 .5.\n\nIn Fig. 2 .5, we can see all the 169 web data sources. Fifty-nine publications (34.91%) have been conducted about Twitter. The next popular data source is Google Trends (30, 17.75%), which include both Google Trends and Goggle Flu Trends (GFT). Naver Trends search engine is used in one occasion. Other 18 (10.65%) researches include a combination of two or more data sources, for example, using social media and web search logs. The 15 publications (8.88%) which are mentioned as other include special systems developed in some countries. These systems are basically local systems used in countries to gather epidemiological data. They have been developed in specific countries and can be accessed to provide useful data and information, for example, recorded incidents by physicians, cloud-based electronic health records, various other databases, or emergency medicine internet sites, such as the medical website V\u00e5rdguiden.se of Sweden ).\n\nThe Google search engine follows with 11 publications (6.51%), while the Chinese Baidu search engine and Microsoft Bing were used in 6 researches (3.55%). The same number is found to blog data. Wikipedia is a web data source, used in five studies (2.96%) and data from Yahoo were used in two instances.\n\nWe can see that various web data have been used, in correlation to the syndromic surveillance data. It is important to mention that the data extraction was executed using traditional methods (use of internet sites) or by using specific API's (Application Programming Interfaces), written in programming languages, such as Python, C11, C#, .NET, etc.\n\nThere are many techniques regarding the data analysis approach used by various researchers that made estimations, analysis, or predictions. We have identified 109 published items with an explicit data analysis method (48.44%). The data analysis methods or statistical approach cannot easily be categorized, as scientists use sometimes multiple methods but, as a rule, all tried to find correlations between data from the official authorities for diseases and the data obtained from the web to create prediction rules.\n\nTwenty-four correlation techniques are used to correlate health data to data from the internet. The correlation techniques used are mentioned as Pearson correlation R, Spearman correlation coefficient, cross correlation function, simple correlation, or autocorrelation function. Others use the R 2 coefficient. It must be noticed that many researchers use combinations of models, which is very common in statistics, when the probability or the validity of the results must be examined and verified in depth before they are announced. Thirty-two types of regression or autoregression models were found. These models can be summarized as follows: linear regression and the ARGO model (autoregression with Google search data) which uses publicly available online search data and not only incorporates the seasonality in influenza epidemics, but also captures changes in people's online search behavior over time. GARMA model is the generalized autoregression moving average model, ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model) or ARMA is the Autoregressive Moving Average model, and SARIMA is the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model. It must be said that in all cases, the dependent variable is the data from the official health authorities, while independent variables are the data from the sources on the internet.\n\nSix studies have been conducted using linear, simple, and multivariate or multiple models. Seven use nonlinear models, such as logistic (logit), nonlinear regression, etc. Six researches use frequency analysis, for example, frequency of queries submitted in the internet.\n\nIt must be mentioned that there are some other models used, such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) in two studies, and two used the Ailment Topic Aspect Model (ATAM). Of course, there are some cases that the statistical analysis requires more than one technique, for example, a research (Yanga, Santillana, & Kou, 2015) was conducted, using multiple techniques, such as: Other scientists use the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) models, referring to them as LASSO regression or LASSO algorithm, while others use other models, such as ANOVA, or other machine learning algorithms, or a combination of them.\n\nRegarding an early prediction, some researchers conclude that, using web data, prediction is possible. In nine studies, early prediction time (period) varies from one day up to 6\u00c013 weeks.\n\nThere are totally 786 authors, which contributed in the 225 publications. Some of them worked in more than one research. John S. Brownstein has the most publications, as he has participated in 17 published researches. Michael J. Paul has 10 publications as an author, while Mark Dredze and Mauricio Santillana have nine and eight, respectively. Vasileios Lampos has seven, Elad Yom-Tov has six, and Elaine O. Nsoesie has five. Below, in Table 2 .3, we see that 29 scientists have three or more publications and other 72 have two publications as authors. Although many aspects of the research regarding syndromic surveillance using the Web have been used and analyzed, we believe that the field of research is still very wide. Besides influenza, other diseases have been explored but not to a very wide extend.\n\nLately, since 2017, another aspect is under examination; the role of weather. Four studies examine the role of weather into an integrated method based on weather data to assist the epidemics prediction.\n\nAccording to Van Noort, \u00c1 guasa, Ballesterosb, and Gomes (2011), a more direct approach in determining the seasonal variation of the ILI factor p, for example, could be the confirmation of the presence of ILI symptoms in influenza infected persons. The above statement is important, since indicates the use of weather data to track the presence of influenza. If this is true, then future information systems could be based both on web data and weather data. Such an effort is described in the research of Shikha et al. (2017) . This is a very interesting aspect, since it is not widely researched and could be researched further.\n\nA surveillance system may be created, based on weather forecasts that can be accessed through the internet and give warnings about a possible spread of a disease, for example, influenza based on weather conditions. Regarding influenza, it is considered that the spread can be extensive in areas with cold and dry weather conditions (World Health Organization, Media Center, Influenza Overview, Fact Sheet no 211, March 2003) (World Health Organization, 2003) . Furthermore, it might be interesting to analyze the spread and the outbreak of diseases with discrimination between urban and rural regions, taking into account that most infectious diseases are developed in a considerable extend in crowded cases, such as big and populous areas, for example, large metropolitan cities. This could be interesting, as in rural areas, internet data may be less or more difficult to be discovered, especially in some countries with vast territories or less developed.\n\nThe above results show an analysis regarding the time, the epidemics, the location, the web data, and the data analysis methods, which are presented in the examined researches and included in this review. Regarding the time, more publications are made every year based on researches from various countries from the world. This is normal, as technology and web continuously advances. The data from the web are now abundant and many scientists can take advantage of it. Many fields of science are now included in this effort to harness the web and estimate epidemics and health issues. Computer science, statistics, sociology, and medicine work together to investigate the appropriate method to exploit the web data.\n\nVarious methods are used to analyze the data in a complex framework with the ultimate goal for the social benefit. While broadband internet is nowadays widely used as the data speeds are growing with VDSL and ADSL lines (Very high speed digital subscriber line, Asymmetric digital subscriber line) by using fiber optics cables, there is still a part of the world undeveloped, such as Africa, Central America, or South America. As we saw, only four studies examine web data for Africa, one for Central America, and six for South America, as people in these countries may still have not the economy power, the expertise, or the infrastructure to widely use web services. That's why the data volume is limited in these geographical areas. On the other hand, more advanced countries seek the way of using web data for health purposes.\n\nRegarding epidemics, influenza seems to provide plenty of data and this explains the big percentage of studies that use data for this disease. It is also a disease with many health complications and a large number of deaths annually and worldwide. Twitter is found to be used in a large scale, as it may give many and useful advantages. Through the special APIs (REST and STREAMING API), there is the capability to track messages real-time, geolocated from almost every part of the world. The messages from Twitter, called tweets, provide the sufficient amount of data that can be further analyzed to help in the estimation of epidemics, although this procedure requires more computer programming techniques and algorithms. Google services, on the other hand, such as the search engine or the Trends, are also extensively used and are found to be also accurate enough to track epidemics. Nevertheless, as we have conducted researches with these two popular data sources, we believe that the potential of social media and Twitter particularly is bigger, despite certain constraints and limitations.\n\nThere is a lot of discussion about the usability of internet data to track epidemics. The key focus a researcher must have under consideration is how an internet system can be managed and function as a replacement system, a supplementary system, a support system, or an extension to traditional monitoring systems. Peek, Holmes, and Sun (2014) research is about the effective management of big data, collected through both traditional and internet surveillance systems. The scientists of this research believe that data for health and biomedicine have become so big and complex that the traditional methods and tools for managing them are not efficient any more. They call this development a big data revolution. They examine and discover the technical aspects of big data and the infrastructure needed for the management of them, to provide useful information. They also review analytical information about health and biomedicine regarding selection of cases and control, bias and confounding in observational data and techniques for mining health dimensional data. These data come from medical records, administrative data, web search logs, and social media. It is widely recognized that internet and electronic health data are quickly growing as technology advances. Capturing health data from various sources needs a change in the technical and management techniques regarding, such as the infrastructure, the file systems as well as the multidimensional data processing. To catch data from the internet, this can be done either with real-time techniques and nonreal-time techniques. Nevertheless, if we need early prediction of epidemics, we must support real-time data gathering and new technologies must be introduced to do so, such as Apache Spark and Storm. examined various studies about the usability of data from the social media. Many authors claim that social media programs should primarily be used to support existing surveillance programs. The researchers of this study concluded that the use of search queries and social media for disease surveillance are relatively recent phenomena and there is also an evolution of the tools and the methodology to exploit them. Although these surveillance systems, based on internet data, have a support function to the traditional ones, they require a high level of familiarity about capturing social behavior through social media. The data from social media, such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, are abundant, but the quality of health information among users in these media is highly variable and this may raise some concerns (Schein, Wilson, & Kealan, 2011 ) that social media users are exposed to unopposed viewpoints that counter core public health recommendations. We believe that this is logical but partly true as people interact with each other through social media about health issues, but it is hard to imagine that an individual could ignore the official treatment and medication or precaution measures for severe health issues just based on what people say in the social media. On the other hand, a person could be further alerted using social media.\n\nInfoveillance (Guy, Ratzki-Leewing, Bahati, & Gwadry-Sridhar, 2011 ) is a term to describe the capability of real-time retrieval of internet data regarding syndromic surveillance. It is a strategy to capture real-time online data. These data can be systematically mined, aggregated, and analyzed to inform public health and policy. Social media are also considered as a real-time source of epidemic intelligence. Epidemics can be monitored through accessing the expected magnitude, peek time, and intensity, and the duration (Nsoesie, Brownstein, & Ramakrishnan, 2013) . The data from the internet can inform healthcare practitioners on when to expect changes in demand for healthcare resources. A surveillance system based on real-time data could provide the means to do so. Nevertheless, in some cases, a precise estimation is not always successful. GFT is an online system that provides useful data, based on Google searches made for influenza. This system was developed by Google and during the first working period, it could also provide estimates and predictions. GFT is now no longer publishing current estimates, since it missed the emergence of the 2009 influenza pandemic and overestimated the 2012\u00c013 influenza season epidemic (Olson, Konty, Paladini, Viboud, & Simonsen, 2013) . Google searches though were used by many scientists and researchers to track epidemics, using various statistical methods that were very successful. Generally, we must consider that a general rule cannot be found for all countries and all diseases, but each one of the latter requires deep statistical analysis; a pattern of a disease in one country may differ in another. It is possible, however, to build systems based on internet data, social media, search engines, etc., but each system requires methods, which can be similar or not. The global pattern of human behavior and globalization can help this, since internet allows people to interact to an electronic system (such as Google Search) or to each other (social media). It is true that internet-based approaches are logistically and economically appealing. However, they do not have the capacity to replace traditional surveillance systems; they should not be viewed as an alternative, but rather as an extension (Milinovich, Williams, & Hu, 2014) . Of course, many people could say that the previous statement is thought to be based on today's technology. In the future, as the research continues, technology will further advance and the credibility of internet-based systems will probably be better and wide across the world. The findings of the researches until today show that the potential of creating such internet surveillance systems becomes more possible over time.\n\nThe impact of syndromic surveillance using web data has been shown to be large, both to the academic community and to the world in general. This is revealed not only from the numerous publications made, from the large number of authors and researchers, but also from the variety of techniques and sources used. The available tools to estimate and predict epidemics or health issues are undeniably a big conquest of science by humanity. Using web data, syndromic surveillance could be accurate in a less expensive way than traditional systems. Nevertheless, traditional surveillance systems must not stop existing. Web systems could be thought as supplementary or supportive systems. Hardware and software still go on getting better. Despite the evolution of electronic systems, the role of human is still important. Moran et al. (2016) describe the role of human interaction, comparing the weather forecast models to the ones for a weather forecast and found that epidemic forecasting is messier than weather forecasting.\n\nGoogle data and Twitter data represent almost the two-thirds (65.70%) of the total web data, used to estimate epidemics. However, we must not forget that there is significant difference between these popular tools. Using Google logs or data from other searched engines, there is the ability to track the search volume and not the search text itself, because what we really need is the aggregated number of searches, provided by these search engines. Twitter on the other side has this ability, but it first requires and it's easy enough to get the whole text which is included in a message. This means that we can read the detailed view of an individual regarding epidemics, but almost on every opinion a person has about a topic and not just for epidemics. This is not of course a privacy violation, but it must not be used for evil purposes. Human interaction in the social media must be conceptualized as a moment view, which is depicted in a specific time and place through internet. This is moreover what syndromic surveillance does; an estimation of time and place.\n\nRegarding modern healthcare systems, this work reveals the potential of internet syndromic surveillance systems to perform as adaptive analytic systems or as a novel research perspective in many ways, critical for Smart Healthcare: by enhancing Smart Healthcare data preprocessing and modeling and by using big data analytic techniques, model evaluation, knowledge deployment is possible through new forms of information infrastructure, as described in the work of Spruit and Lytras (2018) . The key concepts applied to Smart Healthcare systems may be the following:\n\n\u2022 How applied data science for patient-oriented healthcare can empower medical scientist and patients to more effectively and efficiently improve healthcare, \u2022 The discipline of applied data science, \u2022 The knowledge discovery process (KDP), and \u2022 The meta algorithmic modeling.\n\nSince gathering data from the internet is shown to be easy nowadays across the world, Smart Healthcare systems may drive the derived information to people in various directions: governments, scientists, medical doctors, national or international medical organizations or institutions, patients, or people who travel a lot and need direct and constant knowledge of what is happening in the world, regarding epidemics. This spread of data and information, within the framework of Smart Healthcare, could be valuable. Considering the advance of Internet of Things (IoT), the latest and future introduction of 5G networks, or smart home perspectives, internet surveillance systems could lead to a better warning and dealing with epidemics health plans and health policy decisions.\n\nUnder the above aspect, health decision policies might need a closest and greater attention to emerging technologies, such as the IoT, cognitive computing, advanced analytics and business intelligence, 5G networks, anticipatory and context-aware computing, and advanced distributed data warehouse platforms (Visvizi, Lytras, Damiani, & Mathkour, 2018) . We believe that the key perspective would not be just the change of the technology infrastructure and social behavior, but the proper handling of health data itself for health policies.\n\nExtending further the above into the future smart cities or villages (Lytras & Visvizi, 2018; Visvizi &Lytras, 2019) within the framework of IoT, another debate comes up regarding data on epidemics: first, citizens' awareness of applications and solutions that are considered smart and secondly, their ability to use these applications and solutions. In any case, to enhance traditional surveillance systems with internet systems for epidemics, given the proper use of the health data, can lead to social-driven decisions and policies for better living conditions for humans. At the end, both syndromic surveillance using internet data and Smart Healthcare will have the impacts in society, technology, and in medical science.\n\nThe main conclusions of this review can be summarized as follows:\n\nThere is an extensive literature related to the field of syndromic surveillance using the web. This review has gathered the biggest collection of articles and publications on this field ever made, totally 225. Of course, we may assume that more publications can be found except from Google Scholar or using other search queries, but the bulk of the gathered literature in this review is quite enough to extract useful results and conclusions.\n\nThe academic interest is still growing, especially after 2009. The years containing relevant publications extend from 2004 to the year of 2018. Since 2009, the number of publications has risen, after the 2009 pandemic of influenza. The total number of authors in publications is 786 worldwide. These two facts are important as they reveal the significance and the future perspectives of this research field.\n\nMany health topics have been discussed, while most of them are about influenza. It seems that for influenza a lot of data are available through internet, but the fact that totally 34 severe diseases have been included is also important, as it shows the potential of the web data to be used for syndromic surveillance.\n\nMost articles examine North America, the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia, since these are mainly the origins of scientists and data are broadly available in these areas of the world. Almost all regions of the earth have been examined for epidemics, but some areas, such as Africa, South America, or Central America, are underexamined. The contribution of scientists across the world is also extensive, since researchers from 32 countries of the world have published works on this field.\n\nTwitter at first and secondly Google are the most referred and used web data sources, although other social media, search engines, health records, and web logs have been widely used. There is a rich collection of various web data and electronic systems that have been built to present an internet surveillance system.\n\nVarious models for data analysis and techniques are used to correlate health data to data from the internet. In some occasions, scientists show that a prediction of epidemics is possible before the official data are announced from the competent health authorities. This prediction was achieved 6\u00c013 weeks prior to the official data. Another important aspect is that, using web data, we could estimate a disease development in shorter surveillance time intervals; while most of traditional surveillance systems monitor epidemics on weekly or monthly basis, information systems based on web data could provide daily monitoring or even for shorter periods.\n\nSmart Healthcare innovations can use internet-based surveillance systems to assist in the awareness and direction of information to people, medical science and organizations, as well as the policy decisions. With the continuous use of internet, Global System for mobile communication networks, smart mobile devices, and health information could lead to a better understanding and informative techniques regarding epidemics. Within the concept and realization of IoT, early detection and prevention of epidemics could be the common policy for the future, rather than treatment, by reducing costs and procedures. Technology infrastructure will change to deal with the big data revolution, as not only humans, but also smart devices would probably be constantly connected and interact with each other.\n\nKDP is a constant effort to derive knowledge out of data. This can be thought as an adaptive procedure in relation to the technology progress. Health data have been always sensitive and not easy to use. The same applies for internet data, even though they are not considered as epidemical, but inspect and reveal an epidemic from other sources, for example, social media, web searches, etc. Internet, but mainly Smart technologies, could become irrepressible, if not treated under the previous assumption. Future research could also be dedicated on this matter. Both Internet surveillance systems and Smart Healthcare have the same destination: to improve the quality of life.\n\nThe potential of the research on this field remains broad and other diseases except from influenza could be further examined. In addition, the research could be driven to other aspects of syndromic surveillance, such as the weather conditions or the distinction of epidemics in between urban and rural regions with the use of data from the web. Furthermore, although the impacts of internet data for monitoring epidemics may be obvious, it could be more discussed in the future.\n\nWeb can be a useful tool for obtaining data and make predictions for epidemics despite sometimes the restrictions of accuracy or the size of the data. Internet-based surveillance systems can be established to track epidemics and could work as alternative, supportive or as an extension to traditional systems.\n\nFinally, we believe that the contribution of this study is that it showcases the extended research and use of internet surveillance systems, the techniques, and the future perspectives within the concept and framework of Smart Health. Technology advance requires change of the way we think of data, information, and how to deliver them to accomplish the improvement of public health.\n\n\u2022 Extensiveness of surveillance systems with internet data \u2022 Data acquiring techniques and programming languages \u2022 Social media interaction \u2022 Early prediction and real-time monitoring of epidemics \u2022 Smart Healthcare with the use of internet data for epidemics Johnson, H.
