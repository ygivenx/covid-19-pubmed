Therefore, we 108 decided to focus on these two peptides and the relevant control peptides in this study 109 (listed in Figure 1 ). The parent LL-37 peptide was included as a baseline control. inhibiting CatB activity among the tested peptides with an IC50 of 6 \u00b5M ( Figure S3B ). 235 However, none of the peptides had inhibition effects on CatL-mediated cleavage of Z-\n\nPhe-Arg-AMC ( Figure S3C) . The data demonstrated that LL-37 and engineered 237 AMPs directly inhibit the intrinsic enzymatic activity of CatB, but not that of CatL. to such degradation, thus more effective at inhibiting EBOV infection.\n\nIn this report, we demonstrated that engineered AMPs based on human cathelicidin LL-268 37 inhibit EBOV infection. Mechanistic studies revealed that these AMPs act as CatB 269 inhibitors to block the endosomal processing of EBOV GP, thus preventing virus entry.\n\nOur results identify engineered AMPs as a potential novel class of anti-EBOV 271 therapeutics, providing an additional avenue for combating the highly lethal EBOV.\n\nHuman cathelicidin LL-37 has several limitations as a therapeutic molecule. First,\n\nit is relatively long with 37 amino acids. Second, it can be rapidly degraded by proteases. reported that LL-37 is an excellent substrate for CatS with 7 potential cleavage sites 296 (Andrault et al., 2015) . Therefore, we anticipate that targeted engineering of AMPs to 297 eliminate CatS cleavage sites will produce more stable versions of AMPs that may 298 display enhanced efficacy in inhibiting EBOV infection.\n\nOur in vitro study showed that LL-37 and its derived AMPs were inhibitors of 300\n\nCatB, but not CatL, using both EBOV GP and the standard substrates for each enzyme.\n\nThese results are in contrast to a previous study that claimed LL-37 was a selective \n\n17BI is a short name for 17BIPHE2 as previously published.
