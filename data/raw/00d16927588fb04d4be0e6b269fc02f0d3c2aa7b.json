{"title": "Real-time, MinION-based, amplicon sequencing for lineage typing of infectious bronchitis virus from upper respiratory samples", "body": "Infectious bronchitis (IB), which is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), is one of the most important diseases of poultry, causing severe economic losses worldwide. 8 Clinical signs of disease are diverse and include respiratory distress, severe ocular discharge, poor body weight gain, decreased egg production, flushing (renal disease), and occasionally mortality in chickens. 7 IB is often complicated by secondary bacterial (e.g., E. coli, Mycoplasma sp.) and viral infections (e.g., avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious laryngotracheitis virus). 43 Lack of cross protection among IBV serotypes is a challenge to controlling IB 15 ; therefore, control of IB relies heavily on serotype-specific live attenuated vaccines. 8 Collectively, the presence of multiple IBVs in a single sample, emergence of variant IBVs, and the high genetic diversity of IBV can complicate the diagnosis of IB and illustrate the need for enhanced diagnostics. 15 \n\nClinical swab samples (n = 15) were obtained from samples submitted to the Poultry Diagnostic & Research Center, University of Georgia. Detailed information about the samples is provided in Table 1 .\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from each of the swab samples using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as per manufacturer's instructions, aliquoted, and stored at \u221280 \u00baC until further use. These samples were previously tested for IBV and GA08 serotype of IBV.\n\nBriefly, a pan IBV RT-qPCR assay 4 was used to detect IBV in general and then IBV strain specific RT-qPCR assay 36 was used to detect GA08 in the samples using the AgPath ID, One step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on the Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST following the previously described protocols.\n\nFor MinION cDNA synthesis, RNA was extracted from 500 \u00b5l of each clinical sample using Trizol-LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), per manufacturer's directions.\n\nA reaction mixture of 8 \u00b5l of total RNA, 1 \u00b5l of random primers and 1 \u00b5l of dNTPs was incubated at 65 \u00b0C for 5 min, chilled on ice for at least 1 min followed by addition of 10 \u00b5l of cDNA synthesis mix including SuperScript III (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacture's instruction. The reaction was incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 10 min, then at 50 \u00b0C for 50 min for cDNA synthesis. The reaction was terminated at 85 \u00b0C for 5 min, and then chilled on ice. To remove residual RNA, the cDNA solution was incubated with RNase H at 37 \u00b0C for 20 min. All rights reserved.

Sequencing was allowed to continue for 2 hours until 42,940 reads were obtained for Run1 and 156,000 reads were obtained for Run 2 in 6 hours.\n\nFirst, a lineage-typing database, containing 32 IBV S1 gene sequences (one sequence from each of 32 lineages in the 6 genotypes 44 ) and the chicken genome (GCF_000002315.4_Gallus_gallus-5.0), was constructed (referred to as \"IBV-lineage-typing database\" in this study). A second database was constructed with all the Avian Coronaviruses S1 sequences (n = 7328) available in NCBI (as of: 09-08-2017) and the chicken genome (referred to as \"All-IBV database\" in this study). Prior to database construction, all sequences were dustmasked (NCBI C++ ToolKit), and each isolate was assigned a unique taxonomy ID as a species hierarchically under the genus Gammacoronavirus to allow easy sorting. The local BLAST databases were compiled using default settings. The IBV-lineage-typing database was All rights reserved.

The All-IBV database was used to assign IBV isolates taxonomic ID to each of IBV reads from within IBV lineage read clusters.\n\nThe IBV-lineage-typing database, which contains only one sequence per lineage, is required as centrifuge divides the score for any given read by the number of hits that have an equal score.\n\nSince some lineages are overrepresented in GenBank (e.g., Mass strains), this results in the scores of those reads (e.g., Mass reads) being divided by a large number, effectively reducing the score for any single alignment. However, because there is only one read per lineage in the IBVlineage-typing database, it has insufficient diversity to determine if there is more than one strain of the same lineage present in a sample. Thus, the All-IBV database provides the diversity required for that analysis.\n\nA schematic diagram of the workflow of MinION data analysis is presented in Fig. 1 . For Nanopore sequencing data, pre-processing steps were performed to prepare data for downstream analysis. Briefly, Nanopore reads (FAST5) were basecalled using Albacore v 2.02 (https://github.com/Albacore/albacore) with following parameters (read_fast5_basecaller.py -i /Input_reads.fast5 --recursive -t 4 -s /Output_files --flowcell FLO-MIN107 --kit SQK-LSK108o fastq). Porechop (https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) was used for adapter trimming, (default setting), barcode-based demultiplexing (default settings), and to trim an additional 21 nucleotides, representing the S1 primer sequences (porechop -i Input_file.fastq --extra_end_trim 21 -b ./output_demultiplexed files.fastq). After barcode and adapter removal, reads were analyzed with a script-based, 2-step data analysis protocol, which includes Centrifuge-kreport as taxonomic read classifier 24 using the sequences in the above mentioned BLAST databases.\n\nBriefly, basecalled reads (FASTQ) from individual barcoded samples were used as an input.

These read clusters were used to interpret presence of IBV genotypes and lineages in the samples. For isolate level identification of IBV, the lineage-based read clusters were individually aligned to the All-IBV database, which produced sub-clusters of reads. Each of these read sub-clusters potentially represents a different isolate and was further used for interpretation. Knowing that MinION sequencing has a high sequencing error rate in individual reads, further steps were added in the data analysis algorithm to obtain a more accurate consensus sequence. Therefore, these read sub-clusters were mapped, using Geneious mapper in Geneious software v11.1.3. (Biomatters, Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand), to the IBV-lineagetyping database (a reference FASTA file) to obtain consensus sequences from each sub-cluster.\n\nA minimum threshold for number of reads per consensus sequence was not set as in two samples (sample #4 in Run1 and sample #12 in Run 2), only 1 and 5 IBV reads were obtained, respectively; therefore, consensus sequences were built from all the available IBV reads per subcluster. The consensus sequences were compared to GenBank using BLASTn. To select the \"top hit\" from BLASTn output, sequence search results were ordered by \"sequence identity\" and then sequence alignments were evaluated for \"minimum mismatches\" and \"coverage\" of query or subject sequence. All isolates with the highest query or subject coverage and the fewest mismatches were used as \"top hit\" in the final results.\n\nFor Sanger sequencing amplicons synthesis, cDNA from MinION library preparation was amplified using the following primer sets (Table 2) . Firstly, a primer set based on Connecticut sequence NCBI FJ904716.1 was used to amplify Genotype I-lineage 1 viruses (e.g., Connecticut All rights reserved.

Secondly, a primer set based on GA98 sequence NCBI AF274439.1 was used to amplify Genotype IV-lineage 1 viruses (e.g., Georgia 1998 and Delaware 072 serotypes). Primer sets were designed using NCBI Primer-BLAST. 51 The PCR reaction mixture is composed of 10 \u00b5l of cDNA, 0.5 \u00b5l of 10 \u00b5M forward primer, 0.5 \u00b5l of 10 \u00b5M reverse primer, 2.5 \u00b5l of 10\u00d7 buffer, 0.5 \u00b5l of enzyme mix, and 0.5 \u00b5l of 10mM dNTPs, then made the final volume to 25 \u00b5l with nuclease-free water. The following thermocycling conditions were used for amplicon synthesis: denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by \n\nFor Sanger sequencing data, the chromatogram from each of the samples was manually checked and primer sequences were trimmed in MEGA 6.0. 42 Forward and reverse sequences from multiple clones were aligned using MEGA 6.0 software and consensus sequences were All rights reserved.

Samples with pathogenic IBV strains (Run 2, n = 5) were tested with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR and all five samples were IBV positive (Table 1) . Next, a GA08 serotype specific primer set (in house validated set of primers used for diagnostics) was used on all samples from Run 1 (including five samples that were previously tested by the pan-IBV PCR) and four of 10 samples were positive. Sample #3 and #4, which were positive with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR assay, were negative with GA08 specific RT-qPCR assay indicating that these samples contained IBV serotypes other than GA08 and required further testing. Sample #5 tested negative with both assays (Table 1) .\n\nA total of 10 clinical swab samples (Run 1) were processed for Sanger sequencing to confirm the presence of IBV lineages. Based on the MinION results, primers targeting GIV-L1 and GI-L1 (GA98 and Conn and primer sets, respectively) were created. The PCR products were cloned and multiple (6-24) clones from each sample were submitted for Sanger sequencing and results are summarized in Table 3 . Using GIV-L1 serotype primers showed that 9 out of 10 samples were positive with 1 sample (#5) negative for IBV (which is consistent with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR results for this sample). Consensus sequences from multiple clones obtained by using GIV-L1 primers showed the presence of GA98 (GA/A9dvaccinated) in 7 of 9 IBV-positive samples. DE072 was detected in samples #1 and #9 as the lone GIV-1 isolate but was also detected in three samples (#2, and #10) that also contained GA98 (Table 4 ). By using the GI-L1 primer set, which amplified Conn and Mass type IBVs, 3 of 9 IBV-positive samples were All rights reserved.

Based on the two conventional RT-PCRs and the GA08 RT-qPCR, it was determined that only samples #8 and #9 contained a single IBV isolate, while the other 7 samples were positive for 2-4 types of IBV (Table 3) .\n\nPCR amplicons obtained directly from 10 clinical swab samples with vaccine IBV serotypes were barcoded, pooled together and sequenced on MinION device (Run 1). A total of 38,661 reads were successfully basecalled from the entire sequencing run (total reads = 42,940).\n\nAfter demultiplexing, reads per barcode ranged from 831 to 4114. A total of 14,845 reads were not assigned to any of the used barcodes and 128 reads were discarded due to middle adapters.\n\nThe Nanopore reads were queried against IBV-lineage-typing database to determine if the samples contained IBV (Figure 1 ). This AmpSeq protocol detected IBV reads in 8 of 10 samples.\n\nThe number of IBV reads per sample (IBV positive sample) ranged from 56-944. The MinIONnegative samples included sample #5, which was consistently negative with RT-qPCR and RT-PCR assays (and thus interpreted as IBV negative), and sample #1, which had the highest Cq values in the pan-IBV RT-qPCR (Table 1) .\n\nSequencing data was further analyzed to determine if multiple IBV genotypes or lineages could be detected. Lineage-1 and lineage-27 from Genotype I (GI-L1, GI-L27), and lineage-1 from Genotype IV (GIV-L1) were the detected lineages in the samples. Results from individual RT-qPCR assay for GA08 (GI-L27), and RT-PCR assays for GIV-L1and GI-L1 confirmed the presence of multiple IBV genotypes and lineages in 6 of the 9 IBV-positive samples (#1, #2, #3, #4, #6, #7) and AmpSeq results confirmed multiple genotypes and lineages in 4 (#2, #4, #6, #7) of those 6 samples (AmpSeq failed to detect any IBV in #1, and failed to detect GIV-L1 in #3).

High-quality consensus sequences were obtained from the other read clusters (>5 reads per cluster). Each of the obtained consensus sequences were compared to GenBank databases using BLAST, which revealed >99% sequence identity to respective IBV isolates Table 4 ). As described in the Sanger Sequencing section, two samples (#8 and #9) contained only one IBV isolate per the non-MinION assays, and the AmpSeq results were consistent with these findings. Non-MinION assays showed that seven samples contained two or more isolates per sample. Six samples (#1, #3, #4, #6, #7, and #10) contained two isolates per sample (Table 4 ). Of those six samples, AmpSeq detected both isolates in four samples (#4, #6, #7, and #10), one isolate in one sample (#3), and no IBV in one sample (#1; as mentioned above, sample #1 was the sample with the highest Cq value). Of note, sample #10 contained two isolates from the same lineage and AmpSeq was able to identify both isolates within this sample.\n\nFinally, the seventh multi-isolate sample (#2) contained four isolates per the non-MinION results, and the AmpSeq detected two of those four isolates. These data show that a co-infection of multiple IBV lineages existed in the above-mentioned samples but a single RT-qPCR, or Sanger sequencing of a single clone may not have detected these co-infecting IBV lineages and required multiple assays to detect all the IBV types. However, the AmpSeq protocol accurately detected multiple IBV lineages in 4 of 7 samples, with partial detection in two of the remaining three samples (Table 4 ).

A total of 146,540 reads were successfully basecalled from the entire sequencing run (total reads = 156,000). After demultiplexing, reads per barcode ranged from 4,285 to 41,131. A total of 24,297 reads were not assigned to any of the used barcodes and 8,109 reads were discarded due to middle adapters in the basecalled reads.\n\nReal-time analysis of MinION data, which was obtained within 10 minutes of the sequencing, was sufficient for detection of IBV. However, the sequencing data obtained from entire sequencing run was processed with the same protocol as described above. This AmpSeq protocol detected IBV reads in all of the 5 tested samples using all basecalled reads. The number of IBV reads per sample ranged from 5-4,956. Additionally, the sequencing data analysis showed that the IBV reads belonged to GI-17 lineage and typed the isolate as DMV1639. After MinION sequencing results, these samples were later tested to confirm the presence of IBV variant by MDL_DMV1639 IBV variant specific RT-qPCR assay. All 5 samples were positive for IBV MDL_DMV1639 variant of IBV (Table 5) .\n\nIn all of the samples where a matching IBV genotype/lineage was identified by both AmpSeq and Sanger sequencing, the AmpSeq data showed high concordance with Sanger sequencing data, In one sample (#4), only a single MinION read of GA98 was detected by All rights reserved.

Additionally, a sequence analysis workflow is described here. The workflow analysis is designed to deal with the multiple, highly similar sequences contained within GenBank that are due to numerous sequencing experiments of IBV (especially vaccine viruses). This protocol demonstrates the feasibility of real-time-based sequencing to provide isolate-level resolution of IBV directly from clinical swab samples, including samples that contain multiple isolates.\n\nThe proper diagnosis of IBV as the cause of clinical respiratory disease is contingent on virus typing and differentiating live vaccine viruses from field strains. 11 Previously, it was reported that IBV genotypes correlate well with the serotypes of IBV 45 ; therefore, accurate genotypic identification of IBV will be useful to diagnose vaccine and variant viruses in clinical samples. The rapid pan-IBV and serotype specific RT-qPCR assays 4,23,36 have been used for serotype identification; however, positive results from RT-qPCR is insufficient to determine the IBV genotype and obtain isolate-level resolution of IBV; thus, sequence analysis of IBV-S1 gene is required. Previously, use of partial S1 gene sequences (450 bp) to type IBV has been described. 29 However, increasing the length of sequenced S1 gene (~1620 bp) results in more data to be used for genotyping as more of the hypervariable region is covered. 17, 27, 45 For example, the AmpSeq protocol was able to differentiate two genetically very similar (99.5% at S1 gene of IBV genome) but serotypically different GIV-L1 isolates, DE072 and GA98, within a single sample. Thus, the detection of highly diverse IBV genotypes, via the S1 subunit, with a single and rapid sequencing protocol is desirable and the ability to detect multiple isolates in a single sample would improve IBV detection in clinical samples.

Additionally, if unidentified IBVs are in the sample, then current detection and characterization may also require egg culture followed by various PCRs. 8 The AmpSeq method described in this report detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive and detected all the mixed isolates in four of seven samples containing two or more isolates. While mixed isolates were not 100% identified (0/2 in #1, 2/4 in #2, and \u00bd in #3) in three samples with the AmpSeq method, detection of those mixed isolates required several non-AmpSeq assays. Although, there is room for improving this new AmpSeq method, it represents a promising, single-step assay that can be used without egg culture. Thus, it is another tool for the detection of IBV, especially in cases when multiple isolates may be present or when genotyping is especially important.\n\nOne area that is problematic for a test such as AmpSeq is to detect all the isolates that may be present. While AmpSeq did detect all isolates in 4 samples, in 3 cases not all of the isolates were detected. A potential explanation to partial detection of multiple IBV genotypes could be the relative abundance of IBV genotypes in these clinical samples. It could also be that amplification of these IBV genotypes by serotype-specific RT-qPCR assays is more efficient due to small targeted fragment size (e.g., 120 bp for PCR and ~1600 bp for AmpSeq) and better primer alignment to the target (e.g., degenerate bases are used in the S1 primers used for AmpSeq). One complicating factor of the current AmpSeq protocol is that the IBV target sequence 27 was not originally designed for high specificity, especially from clinical samples. As such, a high proportion of total reads were non-IBV reads (e.g., often mapping to the chicken genome, data not shown), consistent with the extra bands visible in the original report for these All rights reserved.

Lastly, increasing the total number of reads collected by AmpSeq may improve the ability to detect all genotypes in sample by AmpSeq. It is possible to allow the sequencing to continue longer to obtain more reads per sample. Overall, AmpSeq is a feasible test for IBV characterization, and work is ongoing to improve this new type of assay.\n\nFor example, cost and time efficiency of a sequencing protocol can be improved through multiplexing of more samples in a single sequencing run. 3, 47 In this study, samples (Run 1 = 10, Run 2 = 5) were simultaneously multiplexed (i.e., pooled and then sequenced in one run) while maintaining IBV genotyping from data collected. Since the MinION flow cells were not exhausted, and can be washed and re-used, the AmpSeq method also has the potential for sequential multiplexing. This would decrease the need to hold samples for weeks while waiting for the cost-optimal number of samples for simultaneous multiplexing. Alternatively, if detection of all isolates within a given sample is preferred, the sequencing can be run longer to increase sensitivity. The single protocol nature of AmpSeq, the ability to obtain S1 gene sequence results, real-time data analysis, and flexibility of testing design makes MinION-based AmpSeq a viable sequencing protocol for typing of IBV isolates.\n\nThe advent of real-time, in-house, third generation sequencing represents a transformative opportunity for diagnostic laboratories, by offering the ability to more fully characterize PCR reactions beyond confirming amplicon size (e.g., routine electrophoresis), Sanger sequencing RT-PCR products, or by confirming a partial sequence through probe hybridization (e.g., probe-based qPCR). However, the interpretation of such large data sets represents a challenge to veterinary diagnosticians. Read-based classification software such as genotypes from single sample. Thus, the MinION-based AmpSeq coupled with the data analysis workflow for identification, differentiation, and accurate prediction of IBV genotypes from clinical swab samples can be used as an adjunct to other established rapid diagnostic assays 9,12 until extensive testing of this protocol is done to improve and validate AmpSeq for IBV diagnostics. Furthermore, AmpSeq-based assays can be, and are being applied to other viral pathogens, 3,37 demonstrating the power and utility of this method in the age of molecular diagnostics.
