{"title": "", "body": "Medical patients regularly present with complicated multi-pathologies, often involving more than one system, each having a signifi cant impact on the others. This chapter looks at some of the more common pathologies that the on call physiotherapist will encounter, highlighting important points to consider when assessing and treating the medical patient.\n\nCOPD exacerbations may be idiopathic or caused by bacterial or viral infection. Hypoxaemia will be the primary reason for the call out and the aim of physiotherapy is to establish the cause of hypoxaemia and treat as appropriate.\n\nMajor causes of hypoxaemia in COPD exacerbation include: \u2022 Bronchospasm \u2022 Sputum retention \u2022 Consolidation.\n\nOthers common causes include: \u2022 Cardiac event \u2022 Pneumothorax \u2022 Pulmonary embolus.\n\nOxygen is a drug and should be prescribed. Prescription should include percentage, fl ow rate, delivery device and whether oxygen delivery is intermittent or continuous. Any changes to oxygen therapy should be discussed with medical staff. Prescription may be fl exible, for example 'maintain sats between 88% and 92%', in which case the FiO 2 can be changed as necessary until the desired saturation is reached.\n\nNB: Liaise with medical staff to establish target SpO 2 levels for each individual patient. They may be as low as 80-85% in chronically hypoxic patients.\n\nThe role of the physiotherapist in relation to oxygen therapy includes: \u2022 Assessment of oxygenation prior to, during and following treatment \u2022 Ensuring the patient is receiving oxygen as prescribed\n\n\u2022 Informing medical staff of increasing oxygen requirements \u2022 Humidifi cation of FiO 2 >30% (or lower if secretions are tenacious).\n\nSome patients with COPD are classifi ed as oxygen sensitive and have a chronically raised PaCO 2 . They rely on a low PaO 2 to stimulate breathing, rather than an altered pH. This is called hypoxic drive. If too much oxygen is given, their stimulus to breathe (low PaO 2 ) is removed and the patient stops breathing, resulting in type II respiratory failure, sometimes called oxygen-induced respiratory acidosis.\n\nIt is vital that all COPD patients receive controlled oxygen therapy until it is established whether they are oxygen sensitive (through arterial blood gas analysis).\n\n\u2022 Maintain adequate O 2 levels (saturations \u226590%) without precipitating respiratory acidosis or worsening hypercapnia.\n\n\u2022 Deliver O 2 via a controlled system such as a Venturi device. If a mask is not tolerated O 2 may be delivered via nasal cannulae.\n\n\u2022 Until it is established whether a COPD patient is O 2 sensitive, start FiO 2 at 0.28 and increase until PaO 2 is >7.6 kPa, without causing a signifi cant fall in pH.\n\n\u2022 The COPD patient with respiratory acidosis, despite optimal medical management and controlled oxygen therapy, will require NIV or IPPV.\n\n\u2022 If the COPD patient is not O 2 sensitive, increase FiO 2 until saturations are \u226590%.\n\n(Refer to Chapter 9.) \u2022 Only consider NIV following optimal medical management and controlled O 2 therapy. \u2022 COPD patients are at risk of pneumothorax with positive pressure ventilation.\n\n\u2022 Use controlled O 2 therapy when removing from NIV.\n\nPhysiotherapy can play an important role in establishing the cause of frequent admissions in some patients and in helping to prevent such admissions (Table  12 .1).\n\nIt is important to establish the ceiling of treatment agreed by the patient, their family and their medical team. IPPV may be deemed futile, and the fully informed Calls to the medical unit patient may decide that NIV is not in their best interest; treatment may consist solely of medications and physiotherapy.\n\nAssess the patient and formulate your plan and goals in line with what the patient wishes to achieve. There may be some disparity between what you perceive as optimal treatment and what the patient consents to. Some patients may wish to limit treatment to symptom control while others may feel that any intervention will worsen shortness of breath, outweighing any benefi ts gained, and thus decline what physiotherapy has to offer. These patients, who have had years of coping with unpleasant and disabling symptoms and have often had multiple inpatient admissions, are able to make truly informed choices.\n\nPatients with end-stage COPD, together with their families and carers, should have access to the full range of services offered by the multidisciplinary palliative care teams, including admission to hospices. Opioids, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants and oxygen therapy may be used for the palliation of breathlessness in patients unresponsive to other medical treatments. In the terminal stages of the disease, antisecretory agents may be useful.\n\nOptimal medical management is essential during acute exacerbation of asthma and may include magnesium infusion, inhaled or nebulized bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists and antimuscarinics), inhaled, nebulized, oral or intravenous corticosteroids, and theophyllines. Antibiotics will be used if there is evidence of infection (\u2191white cell count, neutrophils and CRP, \u00b1 pyrexia) (Table 12 .2). The tiring patient Inspiratory and expiratory polyphonic wheeze or a silent chest on auscultation are signs of deteriorating asthma Beware of 'normal' blood gases.\n\nInitially patients show type I respiratory failure \u00b1 hypocapnia. As they tire, pCO 2 rises, but ABGs may have been taken as pCO 2 is rising through the normal range. Look for signs of CO 2 retention/narcosis (see Chapter 9)\n\n\u2022 If you suspect the patient is deteriorating, ask for an urgent medical review \u2022 Use positioning to optimize respiratory muscle function and reduce work of breathing \u2022 Only use sputum clearance techniques if you think sputum retention is signifi cant in causing airway obstruction (refer to Chapter 6) \u2022 Avoid tiring patient further. Restrict to short, regular treatments \u2022 Non-invasive or invasive ventilation will be required for patients with type 2 respiratory failure (refer to Chapter 9) \u2022 ! NB: Check for pneumothorax before applying non-invasive ventilation (refer to CXR and auscultation sections) Calls to the medical unit PANCREATITIS Pancreatitis can be acute (one-off occurrence), chronic where it persists even after the cause has been removed, or hereditary. Causes include gallstones, excessive alcohol consumption, hypertriglyceridaemia, viral infection, trauma, vasculitis or pregnancy.\n\nThe aim of physiotherapy is to identify and treat the cause of hypoxaemia (Table 12. 3).\n\nRenal failure is characterized by raised urea and creatinine levels. Electrolytes may also become deranged (Tables 12.4, 12.5 and 12.6).\n\nOesophageal varices are extremely dilated submucosal veins in the oesophagus. They are a consequence of portal hypertension as seen in liver cirrhosis. They are very likely to bleed and are diagnosed via endoscopy (Table 12 .7).\n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) refers to a group of lung diseases characterized by infl ammation which often leads to pulmonary fi brosis. Fibrosis destroys the alveoli, interstitium and capillary network of the affected areas of lung resulting in a restrictive disorder (Table 12 .8). \n\nPneumonia results from an infl ammation of the alveolar space, usually due to invasion by bacteria, viruses or fungi, or as a result of chemical or physical injury. In bacterial and fungal infection, alveoli fi ll with protein-rich fl uid and debris from white blood cells. Sputum production also increases (Table 12 .9). Interstitial pneumonia is characterized by patchy or diffuse infl ammation of the interstitium (the area between the alveoli). The alveoli do not contain signifi cant exudate. \u2022 CPAP is often required to maintain oxygenation \u2022 If type II respiratory failure develops, NIV or invasive ventilation will be required, if appropriate NB: Higher pressures will be required to ventilate 'stiff lungs' so \u2191risk of pneumothorax\n\n\u2022 Monitor SpO 2 closely during treatment \u2022 Always ensure adequate O 2 delivery when moving the fi brotic patient. An \u2191FiO 2 will probably be required \u2022 Dips in SpO 2 and breathlessness on exertion will resolve with rest and O 2 therapy. Be patient. It may take several minutes\n\nAdult cystic fi brosis (CF) patients will have their own independent airway clearance regime. It may comprise of PD \u00b1 self-percussion and ACBT, PEP mask, Flutter device or the Acapella. You do not need to be an expert in all these techniques, but during infective exacerbation you need to assess the effectiveness of the normal regime, and assist with sputum clearance if necessary. Patients may benefi t from PD and manual techniques performed by the physiotherapist. It is advisable to do one or two lung areas with each treatment. Treatment may need to be further modifi ed in the patient with dyspnoea, e.g. modifi ed PD, \u2191emphasis on breathing control (Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Cystic Fibrosis 2002) (Table  12 .10).
