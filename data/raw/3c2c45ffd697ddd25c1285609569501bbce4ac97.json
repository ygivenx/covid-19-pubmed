{"title": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus Papain-Like Novel Protease Inhibitors: Design, Synthesis, Protein-Ligand X- ray Structure and Biological Evaluation", "body": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was first reported in Guangdong province, China, in November 2002. 1 SARS is a contagious respiratory illness with no effective treatment to date. SARS affected three continents, infecting more than 8,000 individuals and causing nearly 800 deaths. Fortunately, the spread of SARS-CoV was contained after the initial outbreaks through public health measures. As it turned out, the etiological agent of SARS is a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV. 2, 3 There have been no known new cases of SARS since 2005. However, recent isolation of strains from zoonotic origins thought to be the reservoir for SARS-CoV raises the possibility of a reemergence of SARS and related ailments. 4, 5 Consequently, design and development of antivirals effective against SARS-CoV should be an important priority against future outbreaks. amines with 1-naphthaldehyde using Na(OAc) 3 BH in the presence of acetic acid furnished inhibitors 7a and 7b in 70% and 71% yield, respectively.\n\nFor structure-activity studies and optimization of potency, we planned to synthesize derivatives of both 1-and 2-naphthylethyl-piperidin-4-carboxylic acids and coupled them with various substituted benzylamine derivatives. The synthesis of substituted piperidine-4carboxylic acids is shown in Scheme 2. Alkylation of dimethylmalonate 8 with commercially available 2-bromomethyl-1,3-dioxolane 9 in the presence of KOtBu in DMSO at 23 \u00b0C afforded malonate derivative 10 as described previously. 14 Deprotection of the ketal functionalities was carried out by treatment of 10 with 10% aqueous HCl in THF at 23\u00b0C . The reaction was quenched with solid NaHCO 3 and the resulting crude dialdehyde was used directly for the subsequent condensation reaction. Condensation of the dialdehyde with various optically active (S)-and (R)-1-methyl-1-naphthylmethyl amines, 1-methyl-2naphthylmethyl amines, 2-naphthylmethyl amine, 1-naphthylmethyl amine and dimethyl-1naphthylmethyl amine 11g 10 in aqueous THF for 16 h afforded dihydropyridines 12a-g in 39-62% yield. Catalytic hydrogenation of dihydropyridines 12a-f in ethylacetate at 23 \u00b0C provided various piperidine derivatives 13a-f in 60-94% yield.\n\nThe synthesis of various test inhibitors is shown in Scheme 3. Treatment of diester 13a-f with NaCN in DMF at reflux for 16 h provided methyl ester 14a-f in 38-92% yield. Dihydropyridine derivative 12g was similarly converted to methyl ester 14g in a two-step sequence. Saponification of 14a-g with aqueous LiOH in a mixture (3:1:1) of THF, methanol, and water at 23 \u00b0C for 16 h afforded the corresponding carboxylic acids. Coupling of these resulting carboxylic acids with benzylamine derivatives 5a-d utilizing EDCI in the presence of diisopropylethylamine as described above furnished various inhibitors 15a-k in excellent yield (80-99%).\n\nTo evaluate the effect of the corresponding piperazine derivatives, we sought to synthesize racemic piperazine derivative 20 and the synthesis is outlined in Scheme 4. Reductive amination of Boc-piperazine 16 with 1-acetonaphthone 17 using sodium cyanoborohydride in a mixture (50:1) of methanol and acetic acid at 23 \u00b0C for 48 h afforded 18 in 24% yield. Removal of the Boc-group by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid in CH 2 Cl 2 at 23 \u00b0C for 2 h provided amine 19. Treatment of 4-methoxybenzylamine 5c in the presence of N,N\u2032carbonyldiimidazole in CH 2 Cl 2 followed by addition of 19 and stirring of the resulting mixture at 23 \u00b0C for 4 h afforded piperazine derivative 20 in 90% yield.\n\nThe second HTS lead 3 is considerably weaker than the first lead inhibitor 1, a benzamide derivative of 2-naphthyl ethylamine. To enhance activity, we first investigated the effect of 2-methoxy and 3-methoxy derivatives 7a and 7b on PLpro inhibitory activity. As shown in Table 1 , 2-methoxy derivative 7a showed a very poor inhibitory activity. The 3-methoxy derivative, 7b, however, displayed slightly better activity than the starting lead 3. Our previous structure-activity of lead 1 established that 1-naphthyl ethyl amides were significantly more potent than the corresponding 2-naphthyl derivative. The X-ray structure of 2 bound to PLpro demonstrated that a (R)-1-naphthylethylamide forms hydrophobic interactions with the Tyr-265 and Tyr-269 aromatic rings and with side chains of Pro-248 and Pro-249. 10 The preference for (R)-methyl was also documented as it points into the interior of the enzyme between Tyr-265 and Thr-302. Based upon this ligand-binding site interaction, we elected to incorporate the (R)-methyl group. As shown in Table 1 , the (R)methyl derivative 15a displayed an IC 50 value of 1.2 \u03bcM. To ascertain the importance of the position of the methoxy group, we synthesized o-methoxy and m-methoxy derivatives. Interestingly, m-methoxy derivative 15b exhibited improvement of enzyme inhibitory activity with an IC 50 value of 0.34 \u03bcM. The corresponding p-methoxy derivative 15c have also shown similar potency enhancement (>170-fold over 3). However, the 2-methoxy derivative 15a showed a 3-fold reduction in potency over 15b and 15c. We then examined the effect of 2-(R)-naphthylethyl derivatives on potency. As shown, both m-methoxy and omethoxy benzylamides 15d and 15e displayed significant reductions in potency compared to the 1-(R)-naphthylethyl derivatives 15b and 15a, respectively. Interestingly, the 2-(S)naphthylethyl derivative 15f is 2-fold more potent than the 2(R)-derivative 15d.\n\nWe next examined the effect of a piperazine ring in place of piperidine in 15c by preparing compound 20. However, this piperazine derivative showed no activity against PLpro. Most likely, the piperazine derivative showed no activity against PLpro due to the structural constraints imposed by the carbon to nitrogen replacement on this ring. The new nitrogen is then attached to the amide group, forming a urea moiety. This urea moiety will tend to be planar, imposing a flexibility constraint. GOLD docking shows the amide to rotate \u223c90 degrees away from the optimal hydrogen-bonding orientation (data not shown) of the other active compounds described here.\n\nOur structure-activity studies established that both m-methoxy and p-methoxy derivatives (15b and 15c) are equally potent. Our preliminary modeling studies indicated that either methoxy oxygen (meta or para) is within proximity to form a hydrogen bond with the Gln-270 carboxamide side chain. Based upon these possible interactions, we incorporated a benzodioxolane ring and examined its effect on inhibitory potency. As shown in Table 2 , dioxolane derivative 15g exhibits potency comparable to the corresponding m-and pderivatives 15b and 15c. The corresponding (S)-derivative 15h also shows comparable enzyme inhibitory activity. To examine the preference for a methyl group over a hydrogen at the 1-and 2-naphthylmethyl positions, we have synthesized and evaluated the corresponding unsubstituted derivatives 15i and 15j. As shown, both compounds displayed significant reduction in potency, indicating the importance of the methyl group. We have also examined the corresponding gem-dimethyl derivative 15k. Interestingly, this compound is inactive, indicating that both methyl groups cannot be accommodated by the PLpro active site. Antiviral activities of selected PLpro inhibitors were determined, and the results are shown in Table 3 . The compounds were assayed for their ability to rescue a Vero cell culture from SARS-CoV infection. The viability of virus-infected Vero E6 cells as a function of inhibitor concentration was measured relative to mock-infected cells using a luminescence assay. This protocol allows for the evaluation of both inhibitor efficacy and cytotoxicity. As can be observed from the data presented in Table 3 , the original HTS lead (3) does not show any antiviral activity. However, all 2-, 3-and 4-methoxy derivatives 15a-c show comparable antiviral activity. Inhibitor 15f with a 2-naphthyl substituent displayed no antiviral activity. While the (R)-methyl derivative 15g showed slightly better enzyme activity than the (S)methyl derivative 15h, both inhibitors exhibited the same antiviral potency (EC 50 = 9.1 \u03bcM). Interestingly, both dioxolane derivatives 15g and 15h showed antiviral activity approximately comparable to the corresponding methoxy or benzamide derivatives reported in our previous studies. 10 To obtain molecular insight into the ligand-binding site interactions, the X-ray crystal structure of 15g bound to PLpro was determined. Interestingly, the binding mode and key molecular interactions of inhibitor 15g are quite different than predicted and are different from the active-site interactions with the benzamide-derived inhibitors we previously reported. As shown in Figure 2 , the inhibitor binds to the active via a series of interactions including a hydrogen-bond formed between the carboxamide NH of the inhibitor and the backbone carbonyl of Tyr-269, with 15g wrapped around the beta-turn. The 15g bound PLpro crystal structure also confirms the presence of a few structural water molecules conserved between the apo enzyme (PDB id:2FE8) and inhibitor 2 bound PLpro (PDB id: 3E9S). One of the conserved water molecules sits in the P5 pocket shown in Figure 2 as spheres between residues Asp-165, Asp-303 and Thr-302 preventing the inhibitor naphthyl rings from occupying this pocket. In the stereo image of 15g bound PLpro we also show two other water molecules near residue Leu-163 and Lys-158 that may prevent the benzodioxolane ring from flipping down toward Lys-158. Figure 3 superimposes 15g and our previously developed inhibitor, 2, 10 and demonstrates that the binding mode differs significantly between the two inhibitors. Interestingly, the turn region between Tyr-269 and Gln-270 also shows significant flexibility, particularly in the case of inhibitor 2 (PDB id: 3E9S), where the peptide bond between Tyr-269 and Gln-270 flips by 180 degrees to enable a hydrogen bond interaction between the backbone nitrogen of Tyr-269 and the carboxamide oxygen in inhibitor 2. The carboxyamide nitrogen makes a hydrogen bond with the side chain carboxylate of Asp-165. The carboxy amide nitrogen of inhibitor 15g (yellow) forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Tyr-269 (protein shown in grey). The naphthyl rings of both inhibitors 2 and 15g align in a similar fashion in the hydrophobic pocket formed by residues Tyr-269, Tyr-265, Pro-248-249, and Thr-302. The overlapping position of one conserved water molecule observed for both the inhibitor 2-bound PLpro (oxygen atom shown as sphere in pink) crystal structure and inhibitor 15g-bound PLpro (oxygen atom shown as sphere in red) crystal structure is shown as overlapping spheres.\n\nTo understand the SAR of the analogs of HTS hit compound 3, we used computer modeling to explore the interactions of this series of inhibitors with PLpro. The activity of this series of compounds is independent of stereoisomerism in contrast to the series of compounds synthesized from the first HTS hit compound 1. 10 GOLD re-docking of inhibitor 15g into the PLpro crystal structure described above produces a heavy atom RMSD of 1.7\u00c5 with the crystal structure conformation of 15g, indicating that docking satisfactorily reproduces the experimental structure. When the inhibitors 15g, 15h and 15k are docked into the ligand removed 15g-bound PLpro crystal structure (with residues Tyr-269 and Gln-270 flagged as flexible), the internal strain scores of the compounds correlate very well with their enzymatic activities. The conserved overlapping water molecules observed in both chains A and B of the 15g bound PLpro crystal structure were included for all docking studies.\n\nTo investigate structural basis of the potency insensitivity to the (R)-Me (15g) versus (S)-Me (15h) configuration, we show the docked model of inhibitor 15h superimposed on the crystal structure of 15g-bound PLpro in Figure 4A . From this model, we observe an inversion of the piperidine ring between the (R)-Me and (S)-Me binding modes that allows the naphthyl rings of both isomers to be accommodated in the active site in very similar orientations. The flexible piperidine ring also acts as a spacer group that enables the carboxamide NH of both 15h and 15g to hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Tyr-269 in a similar fashion, thereby retaining the potency of both enantiomers. However, the gem-dimethyl substitution in 15k decreases the freedom around the carbon atom and locks the compound in a conformation where one of the methyl groups exhibits a bumping collision with the side chain of Asp-165. One of the methyl groups in 15k shifts almost 1.2 \u00c5 toward residue Asp-165 when compared to the single methyl substitution (R)-Me in 15g, as can be seen in Figure 4B . It is important to note that the side chain of this Asp-165 is locked in its position by a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of Arg-167. Hence, the gem-dimethyl substitution is not favorably accommodated in the active site, because in order to fit the hydrophobic methyl group near the hydrophilic residue, the aspartic acid side chain would have to move out, thereby breaking structural hydrogen bonding with Arg-167. This hypothesis is further validated by the GoldScore scoring function of GOLDv4.1 during the docking study. Compound 15k is heavily penalized due to an unfavorable internal energy term (-12 compared to \u223c -6 for both 15g and 15h) which is a sum of the internal torsional strain and internal van der Waals energy terms of the ligand. Docking with flexible residues also suggests that the Gln-270 side chain may adopt conformations that might enable hydrogen bonding interactions with one of the 1,3 benzodioxolane oxygens in 15g and 15h (within 3\u00c5). However, all docked conformations generated for 15k shows a loss of this hydrogen bonding interaction. The closest benzodioxolane oxygen of 15k is at least 4.8\u00c5 away from the side chain of Gln-270 (not shown). Figure 4B highlights the potential bumping collision of one of the methyl groups of 15k with Asp-165, demonstrating that two methyl groups cannot be accommodated favorably at this position.\n\nIn our previous study, we discussed the SAR of the analogs of our first HTS hit 1 and the evolution of inhibitor 2 in great detail. 10 In distinct contrast to the present work, that series of compounds is extremely sensitive to the enantiomeric form of the compound. From docking studies we concluded that the (R)-Me form was active whereas the (S)-Me was inactive because the (S)-Me conformation pushed the carboxamide group of the inhibitor away from the backbone NH of Tyr-269, inhibiting hydrogen bond formation with the loop residue.\n\nIn conclusion, we have designed, synthesized and evaluated a novel series of SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors. Initial lead structure 3 (IC 50 = 59.2 \u03bcM) was discovered via highthroughput screening of a library of diverse compounds. Our preliminary structure-activity studies and systematic modification guided by X-ray crystal structure of 2-bound PLpro and subsequent molecular modeling resulted in a potent inhibitor 15g with enzyme inhibitory IC 50 value of 320 nM and antiviral EC 50 value of 9.1 \u03bcM in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Interestingly, the corresponding (S)-isomer 15h is only slightly less potent (IC 50 = 560 nM) in PLpro inhibitory assays but equipotent in antiviral assay. The corresponding gemdimethyl derivative 15k is significantly less potent. A protein-ligand X-ray structure of 15gbound PLpro was determined to 2.6 \u00c5 resolution. This structure provided critical molecular insight into the ligand binding site interactions. It appears that the key active site interactions are quite different from the earlier series of inhibitors. Further design of improved reversible SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors is currently underway in our laboratories.\n\nChemistry 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Oxford 300 and Bruker Avance 400 spectrometers. Optical rotations were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 341 polarimeter. Anhydrous solvent was obtained as follows: CH 2 Cl 2 by distillation from CaH 2 , THF by distillation from Na and benzophenone. All other solvents were reagent grade. Column chromatography was performed with Whatman 240-400 mesh silica gel under low pressure of 3-5 psi. TLC was carried out with E. Merck silica gel 60-F-254 plates. Purity of all test compounds were determined by HRMS and HPLC analysis in the different solvent systems. All test compounds showed \u226595% purity. \n\nThe title compound 6a was obtained as described for compound 1-(t-butoxycarbonyl)- \n\nTo the solution of 1-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-4-[(3-methoxybenzylamino)carbonyl]piperidine (100 mg, 0.287 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 (3 mL), trifluoroacetic acid (0.15 mL) was added at 0 \u00b0C and the resulting mixture was stirred for 6 h at 23 \u00b0C. The reaction mixture was diluted with CH 2 Cl 2 and basified by slow addition of saturated NaHCO 3 solution. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted several times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 . The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to furnish the amine. To the crude amine in dry CH 2 Cl 2 (5 mL), 1naphthaldehyde (77\u03bcL, 0.57 mmol), Na(OAc) 3 BH (121 mg, 0.57 mmol), and AcOH (33 \u03bcL, 0.57 mmol) were added successively at 23 \u00b0C and the resulting mixture was stirred for 12 h at 23 \u00b0C. \n\nThe title compound 7a was obtained as described for compound 7b in 70% yield (viscous liquid 1-[1-Methyl-1-(1-naphthyl) \n\na solution of Boc 18 (32 mg, 0.094 mmol) in dry-CH 2 Cl 2 (2 mL) was added trifluoroacetic acid (0.3 mL) at 0 \u00b0C and it was allowed to stir for 1 h at 23 \u00b0C. The reaction was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was added toluene and concentrated under reduced pressure to give crude compound 19. To a solution of 1,1\u2032-carbonyldiimidazole (18.6 mg, 0.11 mmol) in dry-CH 2 Cl 2 (2 mL) was added dropwise 4-methoxybenzylamine 6c (15.7 \u03bcL, 0.12 mmol) at 0 \u00b0C under argon atmosphere and it was allowed to stir for 4 h at 23\u00b0C\n\n. The mixture was added dropwise a solution of 19 in dry-CH 2 Cl 2 (1 mL) and it was allowed to stir for 24 h at 23 \u00b0C. The reaction was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to furnish compound 20 (34 mg, 90%) as a white amorphous solid, R f = 0.57 (CH 2 Cl 2 : MeOH = 9:1); 1 H NMR (400 MHz, \n\nComputational analyses utilized the Sybyl 8.1 suite (Tripos, Inc.) and the GOLD docking program (CCDC) following previously described protocols. 10\n\nThe complex of inhibitor 15g with purified PLpro was formed prior to crystallization by incubating 10 mg/mL PLpro (in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM DTT) with 2 mM 15g at 4\u00b0C for 16h. Diffraction-quality crystals grew from a sitting drop containing 5 mg/mL PLpro, 1 mM 15g, 1 M (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 50 mM MES, pH 6.5, and 2.5% PEG 400. Crystals were flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen and then transferred into a dry nitrogen stream at 100 K for X-ray data collection. The data set of the complex was collected at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 program suite. Crystals belonged to the spacegroup C2, with two monomers in the asymmetric unit. The inhibitor-complexed structure was solved to 2.63 \u00c5 by molecular replacement using the SARS-CoV PLpro apoenzyme structure (PDB entry: 2FE8) as a search model in the AMoRe program of the CCP4 suite. Manual model building was performed using Wincoot, and iterative rounds of positional & B-factor refinement and map building were performed using CNS. The structure was deposited under PDB Code: 3MJ5.
