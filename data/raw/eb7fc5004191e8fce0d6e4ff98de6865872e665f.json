{"title": "Spike protein binding prediction with neutralizing antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 1 2", "body": "for SARS-CoV [12] . Shi and colleges showed that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor but not 73 other CoV receptors, aminopeptidase N (APN) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) [13] . Ying and colleges 74 showed the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) interacts with ACE2 75 [14] . McLaellen and colleges showed that ACE2 binds to SARS-CoV-2 S protein with much higher affinity than 76 to SARS-CoV S protein [15] . In addition, bioinformatic analysis proposed binding structure of RBD of S protein 77 (S-RBD) and ACE2 [16] . Thus, it is of great interest to identify neutralizing antibodies that can interact with 78 SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and interfere with the binding between viral S protein and host receptor ACE2.\n\nAfter the severe epidemic events of SARS and MERS, researchers have been made great efforts to 80 discover neutralizing antibodies for CoVs [17, 18] . The neutralizing antibodies for CoVs mainly targeted to S-81 RBD. S protein of SARS-CoV-2 shows 76.2% and 34.1% amino acid sequence identity to those of SARS-CoV 82 and MERS-CoV, respectively. Therefore, the neutralizing antibodies of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins 83 may have a possibility to interact with SARS-CoV-2 S protein and show similar viral neutralization effect. In the 84 present study, we employed a antibody-antigen docking approach to predict the interaction between SARS-CoV-85 2 S-RBD and previously reported neutralization antibodies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.\n\nTo comparing of S gene containing S protein among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV strains, the 90 nucleotide sequences of S gene were retrieved from GISAID [19] and ViPR [20] . The S genes of SARS-CoV-2 91 were retrieved from initially sequenced 62 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains. After removal of identical S gene 92 sequences, 16 genes of S protein were used in the study. The sequence from SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 93 (Genbank MN908947.3 or GISAID EPI ISL 402125) was used as a representative sequence of SARS-CoV-2 94 strains throughout this study. The closely related strains of SARS-CoV-2 were selected from preliminary and 95 extensive phylogenetic analaysis of SARS-CoV related strains including btSARS-CoV, SARS-CoV and a 96 MERS-CoV strain.

In ConSurf, conservation scores and confidence 107 intervals for the conservation scores were calculated using the empirical Bayesian method. The scores were 108 normalized using the number of inputted sequences. Also, the highest score of ConSurf program means the most 109 conserved position among sequences. We additionally checked the epitope positions on the SARS-CoV-2 S 110 protein based on the known epitope information of 11 neutralizing antibodies developing for SARS-CoV and 111 MERS-CoV. Each information of epitope positions was acquired from literatures (Table 1) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 /2020 antibodies to prevent MERS-CoV were selected in the study (Table 1 ). The complex structure of RBD and ten 124 neutralizing antibodies was retrieved from PDB. The complex structures were superimposed to the RBD 125 structure of SARS-CoV-2 which were built by homology modeling. The procedures were performed that the 126 RBD structures of SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV were aligned by pairwise sequence alignment. And then the 127 structures were superimposed according to those pairwise alignments using MatchMaker program [29] . Finally, 128 we suceesfully predicted the complex structures of neutralizaing antibody candidates and RBD of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAbout the antibody such as CR3022 [30] that the structure was not revealed, we performed the antibody strcture 148 149 author/funder.

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 groups 153 formed a rigid monophyletic group with their own closest bat SARS-CoV related strains, respectively. The result 154 suggested that these two human-pathogenic CoV strains were derived from common ancestral bat CoV.

Epitope map showed that the antibody-binding residues of S protein are located 175 within RDB region (Fig. 2) . Four SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies had the epitopes about 5 to 14 residues SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies might be bind to mainly conformational epitopes of S-RDB, whereas MERS-179 CoV neutralizing antibodies bound to linear epitopes of S-RBD (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, the major linear epitope 197 6NB7) which were good structural templates (Fig. 3 box) . In the S-RBD structure, we also displayed 198 experimentally defined epitope information based on position specific aligment with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV 199 antibody binding epitopes. 200 author/funder.

The structures of five antibodies including m396, 80R, F26G19, S230, and CR3022 203 developing to prevent SARS-CoV were aligned on SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD successfully (Fig. 3A) . The six MERS-204 CoV antibodies such as MERS-27, CDC2-C2, m336, 4C2, D12, and MCA1 were also aligned on SARS-CoV-2 205 S-RBD (Fig. 3B) . Because the X-ray crystal structure of CR3022 was not revealed, the optimized structure was 206 predicted using antibody homology modeling by 1000 structures generated using Rosetta program. As a results, 207 two SARS-CoV antibodies including CR3022 (-13.91 dG score) and F26G19 (-15.98 dG score) and MERS-CoV 208 D12 (-14.01 dG score) antibody had higher binding score than other antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD 209 region. However, various MERS-CoV antibodies did not match SARS-CoV-2 because MERS-CoV antibodies 210 were interacted with the outter regon of S-RBD which was located in major linear epitope region 211 (EDGDYYRKQL) (Fig. 2) .\n\nBased on antibody-antigen docking simulation, we calculated the binding scores between 11 antibodies and S-215 RBD structures. The antibody-antigen docking simulation generated not only the crystal structures of SARS-216 CoV and MERS-CoV S-RBD proteins, but also the high-quaility homology models with SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD.\n\nTo suggest S-RBD binding antibody, antibody-RBD docking comparisons were performed using the mean value 218 of caculated scores from the generated models. The mean scores of the docking simulation are shown in Table 2. 219 Among the SARS-CoV antibodies, only CR3022 showed that the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 was 220 higher than SARS-CoV. In addition, the docking score distribution of CR3022 was significantly changed 221 between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4) . For the CR3022 antibody, the mean score of binding affinity 222 was increased from -11.21 dG score (SARS-CoV, crystal structure) to -13.91 dG score (SARS-CoV-2, cryo-EM 223 structure) with a p-value of 0.00367. The binding affinity of all antibody-antibgen docking was tested using 224 1000 generated structures. Interestingly, the CR3022 was experimentally performed for the binding effect of 225 SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD [14] . The researchers found that the CR3022 had the binding effect anainst SARS-CoV-2 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
