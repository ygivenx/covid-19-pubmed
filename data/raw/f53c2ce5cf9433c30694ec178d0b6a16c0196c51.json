{"title": "Symptom-Based Isolation Policies: Evidence from a Mathematical Model of Outbreaks of Influenza and COVID-19", "body": "Respiratory infections are the leading cause of death in low-or middle-income countries (LMICs) and account for an estimated four million deaths annually [1] . Before the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, much research focused on influenza, which causes worldwide annual epidemics of seasonal resulting in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and approximately 250,000 to 500,000 deaths [2] . In the US, influenza causes on average of 226,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 to 49, 000 deaths each year [3, 4] . Control of influenza in children is an acute public health problem because attack rates (i.e., the proportion of the population infected) in unvaccinated children are estimated to average 12.7% [5] and exceed 30% during pandemic years [6] . Children also amplify the outbreak as they infect their peers and families, creating greater opportunities for further transmission in the community. [7, 8] For rapidly emerging outbreaks such as novel strains of influenza or SARS-CoV-2, pharmaceutical measures may be unavailable or less effective, and non-pharmaceutical intervention measures (NPIs) need to be used [9, 10] . NPIs are divided by the World Health Organization into categories of personal protection, social distancing, travel and environment measures [11] . However, when the WHO systematically reviewed all studies supporting each NPI for controlling pandemic influenza, it found gaps in the evidence base for many of the measures [11] . In this study, our goal is to use a computational model to examine the policy of symptom-based isolation -a form of social distancing. Under this NPI, individuals who are showing fever due to a respiratory infection are required to remain in isolation until their symptoms subside, normally followed by an additional period of one day free of fever (or antipyretic medications or steroids). The CDC currently recommends this NPI for controlling pandemic influenza and controlling influenza in schools [12, 13] . The buffer period of 1 day helps reduce transmission by keeping people in isolation when their fever symptoms temporarily subside. It also prevents transmission from viral shedding that often continues past the last episode of fever [14] . This NPI is often referred to as fever absenteeism or return-to-school policy in the context of schools.\n\nTo evaluate this NPI, our model computationally simulates outbreaks of influenza and COVID -19 in school settings, and then looks at the effect of symptom-based isolation policies. The benefit of using a model is the ability to clarify and quantify the possible effects of many different policy choices. Our work builds upon numerous previous studies that have applied mathematical models to model influenza transmission in schools (see e.g. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] ). Several studies also modeled non-pharmaceutical interventions such as closures but not absenteeism policies [19, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] ). We performed a systematic analysis of studies that evaluated isolation policies by using a broad search on PubMed. We found a variety of policies involving isolation of infected individuals, particularly isolation for a fixed interval following diagnosis. For example, the large modeling consortium on pandemic influenza [18] assumed students with influenza symptoms would isolate themselves but did not examine the duration of isolation. We also found several comprehensive computational studies of school closures and isolation of infected students (e.g. [18, 33] ), but did not find evaluation of policies that would reduce transmission caused by infectious students returning from home. A related policy of symptom monitoring, that isolates contacts once they show symptoms, has been examined computationally and shown to be sufficient for controlling certain outbreaks [34] .\n\nSymptom-based isolation could also contribute to the control of the current COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nCurrently the WHO recommends a fixed 14 days of isolation [35] , but this policy may fail to contain transmission from the significant fraction of cases with extended courses of illness [36] .\n\nIndeed, evidence suggests that shedding of SARS-CoV-2 continues past the end of symptoms [37] . Therefore, symptom-based isolation for a period of time past the end of symptoms could potentially be more effective and also avoid unnecessary isolation of patients who have a faster resolution of the disease.\n\nDespite the possible promise of this NPI for both COVID-19 and influenza, it is unclear if symptom-based isolation would be truly effective in controlling outbreaks because the CDC-recommended one day policy might not be enough to achieve a meaningful reduction in transmission, and a high rate of asymptomatic infections and partial compliance might weaken the ability to implement the policy. When the attack rate is high, transmission might occur regardless of isolation and the policy might merely create a burden on the isolated individuals and their families, without a tangible public health benefit. If the policy is proven effective, it is not known whether the CDC-recommended one day of symptom-based isolation is sufficient, and if not, how many days would be most beneficial. At the outset of our project, we hypothesized that these policies would have a small beneficial effect on reducing attack rate, delay the peak of the outbreak and reduce the height of its peak. We did not expect these policies to reduce the overall incidence because there would be many other opportunities to become infected. Furthermore, practical barriers may reduce the strictness with which the policies are enforced, which would reduce the policies' effectiveness.\n\nWe use a deterministic compartmental dynamical model known as the Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) model that tracks for each day during an outbreak the number of individuals of various cohorts and immunological states ( Figure 1 ). This class of SEIR models has been used extensively to model influenza and COVID-19 (e.g. [15, 23, 38] and [39, 40] ), and we extended the SEIR framework in order to calculate details about the outbreak relevant to symptoms and isolation.

The cohort structure and other parameters are adjustable to model outbreaks in different settings and by different pathogens. Vaccination is available only for some outbreaks and has incomplete coverage and efficacy.\n\nA relatively novel aspect of our model is the use of compartments to stratify the population by both the day of their infection, their location (un-isolated in community vs. isolated at home) and their cohort (see Appendix A for details). The day of infection determines the rate of virus shedding and the probability of symptoms, which then influences the decision to stay at home or to return. Generally, persons in the model were assumed to return to their community when their symptoms became less severe. The probability of returning was based on the stage of the illness, as well as the isolation policy. The isolation policy had a considerable effect on preventing premature return during the last days of illness, but also during the middle of the course of illness on days when symptoms temporarily waned. We allowed a vaccine to be received by some, if the vaccine is available ahead of the outbreak, attaining partial protection against the pathogen. The population was structured into cohorts representing ages in a school. In schools, students in the same grade generally have closer contacts to peers in the same grade, as opposed to the students in the other grades who also tend to be older or younger [41, 42] .\n\nWe considered the effect of several control policies, most importantly symptom-based isolation for one or more days, but also use of smaller class sizes and vaccination. We also evaluated stricter compliance, which could include remote monitoring, penalty for non-compliance and help in maintaining home isolation. We also considered greater symptom monitoring as could be achieved through education and providing thermometers. Further details on the model, including the equations and the parameter values are provided in Appendix A. The model was validated in several well-monitored influenza outbreaks in schools -an outbreak of 2009 pandemic influenza in a UK boarding school [43] and a US elementary school [44] , as well as a seasonal influenza outbreak in a UK school in 2015 [45] .\n\n.

We calibrated the transmission parameter of the model to give a 15% attack rate (thus matching the typical rate [5] , after accounting for incomplete detection).\n\nFollowing calibration, we evaluated the effect symptom-based isolation policies would have on influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks. We also considered alternative scenarios with larger schools (140 students per grade), higher compliance, vaccination and others described below. For COVID-19, we calibrated the transmission parameter to give a higher 50% attack rate and used symptom and shedding rates estimated for SARS-Cov-2 (Appendix A). Because there is conflicting data on the rates of fever symptoms with this infection, we considered two scenarios: a conservative where just 50% of the cases experience and detect fever, and a higher 88% (cf. [47] [48] [49] and [50, 51] , respectively). To ensure that the results are robust to uncertainty parameter values, we then simulated the epidemic 500 times per scenario, with substantially different values for parameters such as the start day in the year, contact rate between cohorts and others, and reported the median and the interquartile ranges (see Appendix B for details).

Implementing a policy of one and two days of home isolation following the last episode of fever decreases the attack rate to 0.12 (0.01-0.42) and 0.03 (0-0.26), respectively ( Table 1 ). The two-day policy substantially reduced the peak infected (23 to 2 in the median), the outbreak duration (66 to 32 in the median) and the number of person-days spent in the community (143 to 43 in the median). .

The effectiveness of the two-day policy is maintained even in the presence of 80% vaccine coverage and 50% efficacy. Increasing compliance with the policy from 60% to 75% compliance had a small effect (1-2% decrease in the attack rate) and is not effective without an explicit isolation policy. Measures to increase the attention to symptoms from 67% to 84% attention reduced the attack rate to a median 5% at 0 (this and the following reflect the baseline with no isolation days). Completely cutting off transmission during weekends reduced the attack rate by 16%. Dividing the population into groups of half the normal size reduced the attack rate by 16%. The two-day isolation policy was also found to be effective for large schools.\n\nWe considered two COVID-19 outbreak scenarios, corresponding to different levels of detection of fever. The estimated attack rates were 0.79 (IQR: 0.56-0.9), 0.71 (0.43-0.86), and 0.72 (0.43-0.86) at 0, 1 and 2 days of isolation following fever in the scenario of 50% fever ( Table 2) .\n\nWith one day of isolation the peak number of infected is reduced by 20% and the duration increases by 6 days, thus flattening the curve. No benefit was found from increasing the post-fever isolation period beyond one day. If the rate of detecting fever is a higher rate of 88%, implementing a 1 fever-free day achieves an 8% reduction in the attack rate (from 59% to 50% in the median), a 20% reduction in the peak concurrently infected and a 7 day increase in the duration of the outbreak. At this higher rate of symptom detection, increasing the isolation to 6 days achieves an attack rate of 0.43 (0.03-0.82) -a 15% reduction from no policy (see data in Appendix B). \n\nOutbreaks of acute respiratory infections, such as influenza and the novel COVID-19, require an expansion of the available control policies. Here we used a mathematical model to examine a little-studied, non-pharmaceutical intervention policy of symptom-based isolation. We found consistent evidence in support of this policy across outbreak scenarios and settings. For influenza, a 15% and 25% reduction in the attack rate is expected with one and two days of 11 .

This indicates that the CDC-recommended policy for schools, based on a single day of isolation, could be enhanced by requiring an additional day of isolation.\n\nThe result also holds in seasonal influenza in which vaccination is implemented. The isolation policy could be further strengthened with increased parental education and by reducing contacts during weekends.\n\nFor COVID-19, we find that one day of post-fever isolation would reduce the attack rate by 8% in the conservative scenario where only 50% of the cases detect fever ( Table 2 ). The policy is expected to achieve a 20% reduction in the peak of concurrent infections and extend the duration by 5 days. The policy is more effective if a greater proportion of cases are aware of their symptoms, and a 15% reduction is possible with six days of isolation after fever. Generally, COVID-19 is harder to control than influenza with isolation policies in part because the peak of infectiousness for SARS-CoV-2 arises before the development of fever symptoms, rather than coinciding with them (Appendix A).

With appropriate adjustments, the model is designed to be applicable to other settings such as workplaces, prisons or even the broader community.\n\nHowever, such settings have important processes such as travel and complex population structures that might be less significant in the setting of schools. Lastly, symptom parameter information is based on average values, and it is expected that it will vary between patients.\n\nFuture studies might attempt to evaluate symptom-based isolation policies with agent-based models (e.g. [17, 52] ) that can capture variability in health trajectories, the network structure of the population [53, 54] and individual behavior.\n\nDespite these limitations, our model captures essential aspects of acute respiratory outbreaks including progression through stages, the population structure and symptom trajectories.\n\nIn this study, we have created a model of transmission of respiratory infection and considered the effects of symptom-based isolation policies. We confirmed that such policies would be effective in controlling influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks in a variety of scenarios, and we recommend that isolation is maintained for at least two days following the last day of fever for influenza and 6 days for COVID-19. Policymakers tackling the influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks should consider implementing these policies for controlling outbreaks in schools and other settings.

The rate of contact with other cohorts is controlled by a parameter which was varied in our sensitivity analysis. To adjust for generally higher contact rates during the winter months, we use a seasonal term cf. [56, 57] which multiplies the baseline contact rate by a factor that peaks on January 1st:\n\nHere D is the day of the year counting from January 1st. Like the influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 transmission is apparently higher in cold and dry weather, but unlike influenza, it is also affected by absolute humidity [58] . Contact rates were also modified during weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) (cf. [30] ), vacations and closures (see Table A .2).\n\n.

We allowed for some of the infections to be asymptomatic [59, 63] , which in our model increases the rates of return to the community and transmission, while also reducing the effectiveness of control policies.
