{"title": "Arterivirus Papain-like Proteinase 1\u03b1 DATABANKS", "body": "The family Arteriviridae currently includes the genetically distinct members equine arteritis virus (EAV; the family prototype), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus genotypes I and II (PRRSV-I and PRRSV-II), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) [1] . EAV is the best-characterized arterivirus, although recent studies have increasingly been focused on PRRSV due to its economic importance. Arteriviruses are enveloped viruses with a polycistronic plus-strand RNA genome (12\u00c015 kb; [2\u00c06] ). Their replicase proteins are expressed from open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b that encode two large polyproteins: pp1a (187\u00c0260 kDa) and pp1ab (345\u00c0 422 kDa), the latter resulting from a C-terminal extension of pp1a via ribosomal frameshifting. Both polyproteins are processed extensively by three or four ORF1aencoded endopeptidases [7\u00c015] . The arterivirus proteases and proteolytic pathways can be compared with those of the distantly related coronaviruses (see Chapters 494 and 546) and roniviruses, all of which are united in the order Nidovirales [16, 17] .\n\nThe papain-like proteinase 1\u03b1 (PLP 1\u03b1), formerly also indicated as PCP\u03b1 (for papain-like cysteine proteinase \u03b1), is the most N-terminally located member of an array of three (four in SHFV) cysteine proteinase domains that has been identified in the N-terminal 500 residues of arterivirus pp1a (see also Chapters 496 and 497). Its name derives from limited sequence similarity to the papain active site and the relative position of this proteinase in pp1a/pp1ab with respect to a downstream PLP (PLP 1\u03b2; Chapter 496). The PLP 1\u03b1 domain is proteolytically active in the replicase polyproteins of PRRSV and LDV [11] . By cleaving the nsp1\u03b1knsp1\u03b2 junction, the proteinase mediates the autoproteolytic release of a 20\u00c022 kDa N-terminal cleavage product named non-structural protein 1\u03b1 (nsp1\u03b1), of which PLP 1\u03b1 itself is part. In the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus (EAV), however, the PLP 1\u03b1 domain is not an active proteinase. As a result, the nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 equivalents of EAV reside in a single protein named nsp1, which is autocatalytically released from nsp2 by the activity of the PLP 1\u03b2 autoproteinase domain (see Chapter 499) [7] .\n\nThe proteolytic activity of the PRRSV and LDV PLP 1\u03b1 domains (and the inactivated state of the orthologous EAV domain) was initially deduced from comparative sequence analysis. This assignment was subsequently corroborated by analysis of processing products resulting from in vitro translation of RNA transcripts encoding the N-terminal region of the respective pp1a proteins [7, 11] . Based on the apparent sizes of PRRSV nsp1\u03b1, PLP 1\u03b1 had originally been proposed to cleave about 20 residues downstream of its catalytic His residue (His146). The crystal structure of recombinant PRRSV-II nsp1\u03b1, purified after its autoproteolytic release from a nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2 precursor in E. coli, revealed that the protein spans 180 amino acid residues, suggesting that PLP 1\u03b1 cleaves between Met180 and Ala181 in PRRSV pp1a/pp1ab [18] . N-terminal sequencing analysis of nsp1\u03b2 that was immunoprecipitated was used to verfiy this suggestion. It from PRRSV-infected cells was used to verify this suggetion. IT confirmed Met180kAla181 as the site processed by PLP 1\u03b1 to release nsp1\u03b1 from the replicase polyproteins of PRRSV-II [19] . The nsp1\u03b1knsp1\u03b2 cleavage site in PRRSV-I and LDV have not been identified to date.\n\nIn a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, PLP 1\u03b1 was found to rapidly liberate nsp1\u03b1 from the polypeptide generated in vitro, suggesting cleavage in cis [11] . Attempts to detect trans-cleavage activity in this system, as well as by assaying cleavage of short synthetic peptides by recombinant nsp1\u03b1 in vitro [18] , were unsuccessful. The occlusion of the PLP 1\u03b1 active site by several nsp1\u03b1 Cterminal residues, which was observed in the crystal structure of PRRSV nsp1\u03b1, may explain the lack of proteolytic activity subsequent to the self-processing event at the nsp1\u03b1knsp1\u03b2 junction (see below).\n\nComparative sequence analysis (Figure 495 .1) suggests that the arterivirus PLP 1\u03b1 domain spans approximately 120 amino acids and is fused with an N-terminal zinc finger (ZF) domain, with which it forms the B180-residue nsp1\u03b1 protein in LDV/PRRSV/SHFV or the N-terminal B150 residues of the 260-residue nsp1 protein in EAV. The PRRSV and LDV PLP 1\u03b1 domains contain a Cys and His residue pair with surrounding sequence characteristics typical for the Cys/His catalytic dyad found in viral papain-like proteinases [3, 4, 11, 20] . The putative active-site Cys is followed, as usual, by a bulky, hydrophobic residue (Trp) and some local conservation was also detected. Replacement of Cys76 (the putative PLP 1\u03b1 catalytic nucleophile in PRRSV and LDV) or His146 completely abolished cleavage of the nsp1\u03b1knsp1\u03b2 site in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Combined with the sequence similarity to the active site of papain-like proteinases, these observations strongly suggested that these two residues form the PLP 1\u03b1 catalytic dyad. This notion is strengthened by a recent report on the crystal structure of recombinant PRRSV-II nsp1\u03b1 [18] . The PRRSV-II PLP 1\u03b1 domain (Pro66 \u00c0 Gln166 of nsp1\u03b1) was found to possess a typical peptidase clan CA papain-fold topology. It is composed of two opposing subdomains: one consisting of four left-handed \u03b1-helices and the other of three right-handed, antiparallel \u03b2-strands (Figure 495 .2). Cys76 and His146 face each other at the interface of these two subdomains, and His146 is held in an orientation that would favor catalysis by hydrogen bonding to the sidechain oxygen atoms of Asn143 and Glu69. The C-terminal nsp1\u03b1 residue \u00c0 Met180, is positioned in the immediate vicinity of Cys76 and likely defines the S1 subsite of PLP 1\u03b1 (Figure 495 .2). PLP 1\u03b1 loop regions connecting helices \u03b13 and \u03b14 and strands \u03b24 and \u03b25 shape the putative S2 subsite, occupied by Ala179, and multiple hydrophobic residues surround Phe176, the putative P5 residue. It is worthy of note that no less than eight of the C-terminal nsp1\u03b1 residues are conformationally stabilized in the putative active site by a multitude of main-chain hydrogen bonds with PLP 1\u03b1 residues. Together, the available structural and biochemical data strongly suggest that Cys76 and His146 form the PRRSV PLP 1\u03b1 catalytic dyad, and that their counterparts Cys76 and His147 fulfill the same role in the LDV PLP 1\u03b1 [11] ; see alignment in Figure 495.1.\n\nThe crystal structure of PRRSV-II nsp1\u03b1 confirmed the presence of a zinc finger (ZF) domain that had previously been identified in the N-terminal region of arterivirus nsp1 by bioinformatics [21] . The ZF, spanning residues Met1 to Glu65 of nsp1\u03b1, folds into two short parallel \u03b2-strands and a short \u03b1-helix around a zinc ion tetrahedrally coordinated by Cys8, Cys10, Cys25, and Cys28. The ZF topology places it in the structural superfamily of \u03b2-\u03b2-\u03b1 zinc fingers that are ubiquitous in cellular transcription factors [22] .\n\nSurprisingly, an additional zinc ion was found to be associated with the self-processed recombinant nsp1\u03b1 following its crystallization. This ion is held in place by Cys76 and His146 together with Cys70 and Met180 (Figure 495.2) . Given the nature of the peptide hydrolysis reaction by cysteine proteinases, zinc coordination by Cys76 and His146 would render them incapable of catalyzing this reaction, implying that this ion must be bound following nsp1\u03b1 autoproteolysis. It is unclear what the significance of the second zinc ion could be for the function(s) of nsp1\u03b1 during viral replication, though it may help to stabilize the occlusion of the PLP 1\u03b1 substrate-binding pocket by the nsp1\u03b1 C-terminus.\n\nAlthough the crystal structure of PRRSV-II nsp1\u03b1 contained one monomer per asymmetric unit, in solution the protein was reported to form homodimers that displayed a remarkable resistance to high salt concentrations [18] . Molecular modeling of the nsp1\u03b1 homodimer suggested that hydrophobic PLP 1\u03b1 residues mediate the majority of contacts between the monomer subunits, though amino acids in the ZF domain are also likely to contribute to this interaction. The PLP 1\u03b1 active sites face away from each other in the modeled dimer, which is compatible with a model of intramolecular autoproteolytic release of nsp1\u03b1. The PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 dimerization and its possible functional implications remain to be addressed in virus-infected cells. Interestingly, nsp1 of EAV has been demonstrated to form homo-oligomers during viral infection [23] , and our recent unpublished data suggest that an autoproteolytically released recombinant nsp1 is also present largely in a dimeric form in solution. Dimerization may, therefore, be of significance for the post-proteolytic functions of these proteins in arterivirus replication.\n\nThe nsp1-coding sequence of PRRSV-II was cloned into expression plasmid pET-28a and the construct was used to transform the BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli. The Nterminally His-tagged, self-processed nsp1\u03b1 product was subsequently purified by metal affinity chromatography and used for structural studies [18] .\n\nThe PLP 1\u03b1-containing nsp1\u03b1/nsp1 proteins of arteriviruses are accessory proteinases that assists the nsp4 [28] . The alignment was produced with Muscle [37] using Viralis platform [38] and was prepared for publication with Jalview 2.6.1 [39] . The catalytic Cys and His residues of the PLP 1\u03b1 domain, and zinc-binding residues of the N-terminal ZF domain are marked with # and *, respectively. Color indicates residues that are identical and conserved in all viruses. The C-terminal boundaries of the protease domain in viruses other than PRRSV are yet to be verified experimentally. GenBank and/or RefSeq accession numbers of respective virus genome sequences are presented next to the virus acronyms. main proteinase (see Chapter 692) in the proteolytic processing of the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins [16] . All available evidence points to only a single proteolytic event that is mediated by PLP 1\u03b1, i.e. the autoproteolytic release of nsp1\u03b1 (see above). In combination with the multidomain organization of nsp1\u03b1 and the loss of the PLP 1\u03b1 proteolytic activity in EAV, this suggests that PLP 1\u03b1-containing arterivirus proteins have other, non-proteolytic functions during viral infection.\n\nThe loss of the proteolytic activity in the EAV PLP 1\u03b1 lineage is, to our knowledge, almost unparalleled in virology (for the only other example, see Ziebuhrl et al. [24] ). It seems to be due to replacement of the catalytic Cys residue, and possibly other substitutions. However, despite this loss of proteolytic function and the low overall sequence similarity between EAV and PRRSV/LDV in this region, a number of PLP 1\u03b1 residues have been conserved in the corresponding part of EAV nsp1 (Figure 495.1) . This observation suggests the conservation of additional, nonproteolytic function(s) of this proteinase domain [11] , and we recently obtained additional data supporting this view. In particular, EAV nsp1 was implicated in the selective regulation of subgenomic mRNA synthesis [21] , which is a crucial, replication-dependent event in replicative cycles of arteriviruses and other nidoviruses [25\u00c027]. Initially, EAV nsp1 was thought to exercise this function mainly through its ZF [21] , but more recent data demonstrated the critical importance of charged residues from the PLP 1\u03b1 (and PLP 1\u03b2) domains for subgenomic mRNA production [28] . EAV nsp1 also appears to fine-tune the abundance of each viral mRNA species by controlling the accumulation levels of its respective minus-strand template [28] . Finally, certain replacements in the ZF and PLP 1\u03b1 domains of EAV nsp1 were found to interfere with virus production without affecting viral mRNA accumulation [28, 29] . Thus, nsp1 seems to coordinate various key events in the EAV replicative cycle. PLP 1\u03b1 residues have been implicated in all replicative functions of EAV nsp1, providing a possible explanation for the conservation of this proteolytically inactive domain. Interestingly, substitutions of catalytic PLP 1\u03b1 residues that lead to a block in nsp1\u03b1 autoproteolytic release render subgenomic mRNA accumulation undetectable in PRRSV-infected cells [30] , suggesting that the key function of nsp1\u03b1/nsp1 in subgenomic mRNA synthesis is conserved among arteriviruses.\n\nAn intriguing aspect of nsp1/nsp1\u03b1 biology is the fact that these proteins were found to partially localize to the cell nucleus during infection with EAV or PRRSV [19, 31, 32] . In the case of EAV nsp1, this appears to be due to active transport across the nuclear pore complex [31] . How these proteins are transported into the nucleus, in view of the absence of discernible nuclear localization signals in their primary structures, remains unclear. The relevance of the nuclear localization of nsp1/nsp1\u03b1 during infection is currently unknown, but it may be connected to a recently described function of PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 as an antagonist of Type I interferon (IFN), the synthesis and secretion of which are key events of cellular innate immune responses. Overexpression of nsp1\u03b1 (and nsp1\u03b2, see Chapter 496) strongly inhibited the expression of a reporter gene driven by an IFN\u03b2 promoter in the absence of other viral proteins [19,32\u00c034] . Subsequent reports provided evidence for a function of PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 as a negative modulator of NF-\u03baB activation, an important regulatory step leading to expression of various immunomodulatory factors, including IFN [32, 35] . The protein domains responsible for the suppression of innate immune responses by PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 have not yet been delineated, nor has the relevance of this proposed function for virus infection been examined. Interestingly, nsp1\u03b1 does not FIGURE 495.2 Ribbon diagram of the crystal structure of PRRSV-II nsp1\u03b1. The figure was made using the Pymol molecular graphics system and PDB entry 3IFU [18] . The structure of the nsp1\u03b1 monomer includes five \u03b2-strands and five \u03b1-helices [18] . The N-terminal ZF domain (Met1 to Glu65; zinc-binding residues Cys8, Cys10, Cys25, and Cys28 highlighted in yellow) and C-terminal PLP 1\u03b1 domain (Pro66 to Gln166) are colored as blue and dark red ribbons, respectively. The 'Cterminal extension' (CTE: Arg167 to Met180) that resides inside the PLP 1\u03b1 substrate-binding pocket is featured in green. In the crystal structure of recombinant nsp1\u03b1, the catalytic residues Cys76 and His146 (highlighted in bright red) were found to coordinate a second zinc ion, together with Cys70 (dark red) and the C-terminal Met180 (green). The latter residues are depicted only in the inset, in which the structure was rotated about 180 around its vertical axis. The functional implications of the presence of this second zinc ion for PLP 1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b1 remain to be investigated. seem capable of inhibiting cellular responses to IFN, unlike nsp1\u03b2, which suppresses IFN synthesis, as well as subsequent IFN-mediated signaling events ( [19] , see Chapter 496).\n\nPLP 1\u03b1 is a small papain-like cysteine proteinase domain, which is linked to an N-terminal zinc finger domain (Figure 499.2) . It cleaves the arterivirus pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins in cis B35 residues downstream of its active-site His residue, and thus releases the Nterminal nsp1\u03b1 subunit of the PRRSV and LDV replicase. The proteolytic activity of PLP 1\u03b1 appears to have been lost during EAV evolution.\n\nA polyclonal rabbit antiserum against EAV nsp1 was raised by immunization with a peptide representing the first 23 residues of pp1a [8] . This serum is available from the authors for research purposes on request. The production of a mouse monoclonal antibody (12A4) recognizing EAV nsp1 has also been documented [36] . Polyclonal antisera directed against nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 from a PRRSV-II have been described recently [19] .\n\nThe PLP 1\u03b1 lineage may have emerged by duplication in an ancestor of arteriviruses. In evolutionary terms it is far separated from other papain-like peptidases.\n\nThe papers of den Boon et al. [11] , Ziebuhr et al. [16] , Tijms et al. [21] , Sun et al. [18] , Chen et al.
