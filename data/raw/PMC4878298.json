{"title": "Respiratory syncytial virus seasonality in Brazil: implications for the\nimmunisation policy for at-risk populations", "body": "This was an ecologic study of the time series of RSV monthly positivity in samples\ntested using the influenza sentinel surveillance system (\u201cSIVEP-Gripe\u201d - SIVEP-flu),\nwith the purpose of identifying seasonal patterns in the five regions of Brazil from\n2005-2012. The temporal trend of the rates of monthly hospitalisation for bronchiolitis\nand pneumonia in infants under 5 years of age, in the same regions and period, was also\nanalysed.\n\nAll five administrative regions of Brazil were chosen as local of study because they\npresent different socioeconomic and environmental patterns which may influence on virus\ncirculation. The climate in the Midwest region (14,993,194 inhabitants) is predominantly\ntropical, with a rainy season between November and March (monthly rainfall between\n13.1-255.6 \u00d7 10-3 m) and temperatures ranging 22.0-26.4\u00baC. The Northeast region\n(55,794,694 inhabitants) has a semiarid climate in the interior and a tropical Atlantic\nclimate near the coast, where the majority of the population is concentrated, with a\nmonthly rainfall ranging 46.4-281.4 \u00d7 10-3 m and a low temperature range (monthly\naverage of 25.1-27.3\u00baC). The North region (16,983,485 inhabitants) has an equatorial\nclimate with rainfall throughout the year (monthly rainfall between 74.4-303.9 \u00d7 10-3 m)\nand low thermal amplitude (averages 26.3-28.0\u00baC). The Southeast region (84,465,579\ninhabitants) has a predominantly altitude tropical climate with rainfall concentrated\nbetween November and March (monthly rainfall between 28.2-285.6 \u00d7 10-3 m) and a slightly\nhigher thermal amplitude (monthly average between 18.7-24.6\u00baC). Finally, the Southern\nregion (28,795,762 inhabitants) has a predominantly subtropical climate with rainfall\ndistributed throughout the year (monthly rainfall between 101.1-198.9 \u00d7 10-3 m) and\nlower temperatures between May and September (monthly average between 14.9-23.1\u00baC).\n\n\nInfluenza sentinel surveillance system data (SIVEP-Gripe) - The\nlaboratory data were obtained from SIVEP-Gripe, which has 128 sentinel surveillance\nunits distributed throughout all the regions of Brazil. The surveillance units record at\nleast five samples of nasophar- yngeal secretions weekly from patients with\ninfluenza-like illness (measured fever associated with sore throat and/or cough without\nage group distinction). Samples are processed by using indirect immunofluorescence\n(IIF), including tests for influenza A and B; parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3; adenovirus; and\nRSV. The study variables included place of residence, age, and positive and negative IIF\nresults for RSV.\n\nThe laboratory positivity indicator was calculated using the results of the IIF reaction\nof the nasophar- yngeal secretion samples: monthly positivity of IIF reaction for RSV,\nrelative to the total of monthly valid tests, i.e., excluding the results within\ninadequate samples (not enough biological material, improper storage, correct material\nin the sample) or inconclusive results (no valid results). Because in some regions the\nnumber of samples was low until 2004 (Freitas et al.\n2013), samples from 2005-2012 were selected for analysis.\n\n\nHospitalisation data - The hospitalisation data were obtained from the\nHospital Information System of the Ministry of Health, which includes all the admissions\nmade by the Brazilian Public Health System through Hospitalisation Authorisation. These\ndata include over 75% of all hospitalisations in Brazil. The hospitalisation causes with\na possible association to RSV were selected. These are codified in the information\nsystem as RSV-associated pneumonia, RSV-associated acute bronchitis, RSV-associated\nacute bronchiolitis and unspecified acute bronchiolitis, with the following respective\ncodes from the International Disease Classification, CID-10: J12.1, J20.5, J21.0 and\nJ21.9.\n\nThe hospitalisation rates were calculated by dividing the number of admissions of\ninfants less than 5 years old (under the aforementioned causes) by the annual population\nin the same age range, estimated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics.\nThe hospitalisation and population data were obtained from the Informatics Department of\nthe Brazilian Public Health System.\n\n\nTime series - Wavelet and Fourier analysis - Initially, plots were made\nto visualise time parameters and seasonal trends. The IIF positivity proportions of\nnasopharyngeal secretion from laboratory data and hospitalisation rates were analysed\nusing the wavelet technique for identifying periodic patterns of RSV occurrence and\nassociated morbidity. Wavelet analysis provides information on the time-scale domain for\nstationary and non-stationary events, allowing for simultaneous localisation of time and\nof high and low frequencies. Subtle time patterns of occurrence of phenomena of\ndifferent nature can be detected, as well as changes in its periodicity. Wavelet\nanalysis permits inferences regarding the way continuous variables relate to different\nfrequencies and whether this relationship changes over time (Torrence & Compo 1998, Cazelles\net al. 2007). The algorithms described by Torrence and Compo (1998), available in free software were used (Alonso & McCormick 2012). This analysis allows\nestablishing whether a specific periodic phenomenon has a stationary frequency, a basic\nassumption required in Fourier analysis.\n\nNext, the laboratory and hospitalisation data were analysed through Fourier time series\ndecomposition using sinusoidal harmonics of the annual and semi-annual cycles. Fourier\nanalysis considers every period to have a periodic stable frequency throughout time.\nThis method allows analysing signals and systems through decomposition of periodic\nfunctions in convergent trigonometric series (sin and cos). In this case, it allowed\nidentifying the time of annual and biannual peaks of the time series analysed through\nmultiple linear regression.\n\nThe possible occurrence of seasonal heterogeneity within the administrative regions was\nverified through Fourier analysis of the individual hospitalisation data of each state.\nSince the sole purpose of this study was the analysis of seasonality, secular trends in\nmortality and hospitalisations were corrected by means of polynomial regression to\nimprove the regression fit.\n\n\nAnalysis of RSV transmission annual seasons - The probable annual\nstations of greater RSV circulation were defined based on the laboratory-based\npositivity indicator of the samples. This indicator (monthly positive samples/total of\nmonthly valid samples) was used to define annual seasons of RSV as the five consecutive\nmonths in which higher IIF positivity was observed. This definition is consistent with\nthe prophylaxis of five consecutive monthly doses of palivizumab, as recommended by the\nBrazilian Pediatric Society (SBP 2011). This\ncriterion, with minor changes, has been used before to study RSV and influenza through\nanalysis of monthly and weekly data, and has been shown to be adequate for the study of\nseasonality (Chiu et al. 2002, Bloom-Feshbach et al. 2013).\n\nFourier and wavelets analysis were performed using Matlab (Mathworks Inc.) software\nEPIPOI\u00ae (Alonso & McCormick 2012). Statistical\nanalysis was performed using SPSS v. 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) software, and the\nplots were constructed using Microsoft Office 2013 (Microsoft Corporation). The research\nwas approved by Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medical Sciences, University\nof Campinas (number 909/2013).\n\nFrom 2005-2012, 52,261 samples of nasopharyngeal secretions were collected, of which\n2,715 [5.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.6-6.0] were positive for RSV. The number of\nsamples collected from children under 5 years old was 12,501, of which 1,373 (11.6%; 95%\nCI 11.0-12.2) were positive for RSV.\n\nThe ratio of positive results from IIF assays in the age group under 5 years old for\neach of the five regions is shown in Table I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeasonality: time series - wavelet and Fourier analysis - Wavelet\nanalysis permitted identifying a strong tendency for RSV annual cycles in all regions of\nthe country; in addition one can suspect a lower second wave peak, especially in the\nearly years of the series. It is unstable and not statistical significant, but present\nin Figs 1-3.\nThis evidence may indicate a biannual (semiannual) periodicity, that is, six months\nafter the main peak. This second peak is more evident in the North and Midwest regions\nin specific years (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1, there is a seasonal pattern\nevidenced by the wavelets. Any irregularity may be due to the small number of monthly\nsamples.\n\nThe same annual cycle pattern with a small peak appearing after 6 months can also be\nobserved in Fig. 2, corresponding to the\nhospitalisation rates for bronchiolitis and pneumonia. These stable annual activity\npatterns identified using wavelets allow the analysis by means of Fourier decomposition\nof the complete time series for years 2005-2012.\n\n\n\n\n\nRSV seasonality analysis through Fourier decomposition of the time series assay results\nallowed identifying regional differences between the greater activity periods in the\ndistinct regions of Brazil. The RSV peak occurred in the North and Midwest regions in\nthe second week of April (peak = 4.4), in the Northeast in the first week of May (peak =\n5.1), in the Southeast in the beginning of April, and in the South in the first week of\nJune (peak = 6.2; Table II).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seasonality Fourier decomposition analysis of the monthly rates of hospitalisation\nfor RSV-associated bronchiolitis and pneumonia showed similar results when compared with\nthe results from the positivity series of assays in the same region (Table II). In general, the criteria are mutually\nconsistent, with matching results.\n\n\nTransmission peaks and annual season analysis - The most appropriate\ndates for starting immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab for each region of Brazil are\ncompared with the recent indication by Brazilian Ministry of Health (Table III). There are differences in the months\nsuggested for the beginning of therapy with palivizumab in Southeast and Midwest region\nwhen compared with Brazilian official guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis of the data collected by the SIVEP-GRIPE between the years 2005-2012 shows\na clear seasonality in all regions of Brazil and regional differences between the\nperiods of higher viral activity.\n\nThe probable RSV seasonal periods identified through samples tested by using IIF and\nfrom hospitalisation data showed similar results. Although the etiologic diagnosis of\nbronchiolitis is not always routinely performed in Brazilian hospitals, it is believed\nthat RSV is responsible for 60-75% of the total number of cases of this syndrome in\nchildren under 5 years old (Nair et al. 2010).\nThus we considered the diagnosis of bronchiolithis and pneumonia due to RSV as a viral\ncirculation marker.\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between the hospitalisations for\nbronchiolitis and pneumonia caused by RSV and the viral circulation of RSV; this\nincludes using hospitalisation data with codes compatible with symptoms caused by RSV as\na way of validating the laboratory surveillance data (Light et al. 2008, Panozzo et al.\n2010, Hampp et al. 2013). The use of\nsyndormic surveillance, besides validation of laboratory surveillance data, enables\nidentification of underreporting or a delay in reporting, through observation of trends\nin the occurrence of the disease (Freitas et al.\n2009, van den Wijngaard et al. 2012).\nAccordingly, the seasonality matching found through the laboratory and syndrome\nsurveillance indicators are compatible and may validate the results. The secondary peaks\ndo not seems to be artifacts.\n\nThere has been a great interest in studying RSV seasonality in order to develop\nappropriate prescription of palivizumab administration as well as other health care\nactions (Vieira et al. 2001, Paiva et al. 2012, Haynes et al. 2013). In Brazil, palivizumab has been recommended based on the\nfirst studies regarding RSV seasonality, mainly performed in the South and Southeast\nstates (ANVISA 2011). In 2013, the Brazilian\nMinistry of Health included palivizumab as a drug freely distributed by the Brazilian\nPublic Health System for use in premature babies (gestational age less or equal than 32\nweeks) and infants less than 2 years old with chronic lung disease or congenital heart\ndisease with demonstrated hemodynamic repercussion. Every state and region can establish\nthe optimal period for starting the use of immunobiologicals, accounting for the\nregional climate specificities and epidemiological evidences (MS 2012). The recent revision of guidelines by the Ministry of\nHealth in 2015 proposed a readjustment of the periods of provision of immunobiologicals\nin the different regions of the country (MS\n2015). Our results reinforce this revision for provision of palivizumab in\ndifferent regions, as suggested by others studies in Brazil (Vieira et al. 2001, Paiva et al.\n2012) and others regions (Panozzo et al.\n2010, Blom-Feshbach et al. 2013).\nResults over the period for availability of palivizumab in the Midwest and Southeast\n(January) do not match exactly with those suggested by Ministry of Health (February).\nAlthough there are differences of one month only, these are densely populated regions.\nThe readjustment of the immunisation schedule with palivizumab aims to ensure the\nprotection of higher risk children, while avoiding the waste of this expensive\nimmunobiological.\n\nIn addition to ascertaining the optimal time for prophylaxis against RSV, scheduling of\nother non-pharmacological interventions can interfere with the transmission of RSV.\nPrevention campaigns among the population and health care providers and the planning and\nprovision of pediatric hospital beds can be strengthened during these periods of the\nyear (Jefferson et al. 2010, CDC 2014).\n\nSome limitations of this study can be indicated, including the fact that the data on the\npositivity for RSV was obtained from an information system, which is still only\npartially and heterogeneously covered in various regions of the country. In addition,\nduring the period studied, SIVEP-GRIPE did not include other viruses such as\nmetapneumovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus, and human coronavirus, which may cause similar\nclinical features. Nonetheless, the analysed data represent all the information\navailable in SIVEP-GRIPE, having a great implication on the public health policies in\nthe country. Another limitation of this study was the low mean positivity found from the\ntests, which depended on several factors independent of the epidemiological situation,\nsuch as the quality of sample collection and transportation, in addition to the\nsensitivity of the test used. Furthermore, the number of collected samples did not allow\nusing weekly laboratory results or the separate evaluation of the states. However, the\nhospitalisation data for bronchiolitis and pneumonia due to RSV did not suggest regional\ndiscrepancies.\n\nThe aggregation of samples in administrative regions can lead to inaccurate\ngeneralisations, since it does not consider differences between the various states that\nmake up these regions. However, the reduced number of collected samples in some states\ndid not allow this separation. Moreover, partial analysis of state data performed in\nthis study showed similar results to those for the states aggregated into regions.\n\nThe hospitalisation rates for bronchiolitis respiratory diseases associated with RSV in\nchildren under 5 years of age can be considered an indicator that indirectly reflects\nthe risk of circulation of RSV in the community, although there is no laboratory\nconfirmation of these clinical conditions in the routine of hospital care in the\ncountry. The syndromic surveillance for bronchiolitis may be considered a good sentinel\nindicator of RSV circulation in Brazil. The results of the time series analysis of\nlaboratory positivity indicators and hospitalisation reinforce the revision and\nadaptation of provision calendars for high-cost immunoprophylaxis and for RSV infection\nprevention campaigns in the different regions of Brazil."}
