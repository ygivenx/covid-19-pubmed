{"title": "Fit for the future? The place of global health in the UK's postgraduate medical training: a review", "body": "Understanding that health is a global issue is vital for our future health professionals if they are to deal effectively with the health-care challenges that they will face. The Global Independent Commission on Education of Health Professionals for the 21st Century described a \u2018mismatch between present professional competencies and the requirements of an increasingly interdependent world\u2019,1 emphasizing the need for evolving postgraduate training to take account of the increasingly global nature of health.\n\nSome may question why UK-trained health professionals working solely within the National Health Service (NHS) need an awareness of global health. A range of reasons detailing how training our health professionals in global health will deliver significant benefits to the NHS are listed in Box 1. Furthermore, as health professionals we have a duty to advocate better health for all, not only for those living within the UK.\n\nUndergraduate training is adapting, with special study modules and intercalated Bachelor of Science degrees in international or global health having been available for more than a decade.5 The updated General Medical Council guidelines for undergraduate medical training \u2018Tomorrow's Doctors\u2019 include the learning outcome: \u2018Discuss from a global perspective the determinants of health and disease and variations in health-care delivery and medical practice\u20196 and global health learning outcomes for all UK medical students have recently been developed.7,8 This is welcome progress but, without a similar shift in postgraduate training, is not sufficient.\n\nIndeed Martineau et al.'s analysis of the career paths of early graduates of intercalated international health BScs concludes that \u2018the successful establishment of global health education at an undergraduate level must now be replicated in postgraduate training to follow this generation as they progress\u2019.9\n\nThere is high-level recognition of the need for and benefits of the NHS adopting a global health approach,10,13 including a House of Lords debate led by Lord Crisp.14 Several Royal Colleges have responded with conferences,15\u201317 position statements18 or strategies.19,20 Despite this, the coverage of global health within UK postgraduate medical curricula has not been systematically assessed. This article presents a review of the current global health content of a cross-section of postgraduate medical curricula in the UK.\n\nAn informal network of trainees and recently qualified general gractitioners (GPs) holding positions on the International Committees of a number of Colleges was established. Where Colleges do not have an International Committee or do not have a trainee representative on their International Committee, trainees nominated by the College or affiliated to the UK-based global health postgraduate organization Alma Mata21 were recruited to informally represent the College in which they are training. The Colleges and curricula reviewed are shown in Table 1. Unsuccessful efforts were made to include the Royal College of Anaesthetists and the Royal College of Radiologists.\n\n\nThe global health content of the curricula described in Table 1 was established by examining the competencies within them. For several curricula this was done by more than one person and discussed to achieve consensus. The competencies were coded as \u2018UK\u2019 (statement only relevant to UK work, often referring to UK institutions or structures), \u2018global\u2019 (statement with an explicit reference to aspects of health outside the UK such as the global burden of disease or organizations involved in international health-care issues) or generic (relevant both to the UK and international settings). This built on work previously conducted and published on the Faculty of Public Health's (FPH) curriculum; the results presented here for the FPH curriculum are from this previous work.22\n\nSix of the 11 curricula reviewed contained global health competencies, as shown in Table 2.\n\n\nThe six curricula that contained global health competencies had competencies on the global burden of disease or global determinants of disease and appropriate policy responses. The global health competencies identified are shown in Table 3. Two curricula were almost identical in common competencies (The College of Emergency Medicine [CEM] and The Royal College of Physicians \u2013 General Internal Medicine [RCP-GIM]).\n\n\nAlthough the aim of this paper was to review the core specialty curricula, the surgical and psychiatric subspecialty curricula were also reviewed. (The subspecialty curricula reviewed were: Neurosurgery; Trauma and Orthopaedics; General Surgery intermediate and advanced training; Urology; Paediatric Surgery; Plastics Surgery; Otolaryngology; Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery; Cardiothoracic Surgery; General Psychiatry (ST4+); Old Age Psychiatry; and Liaison Psychiatry.) The detailed results of these are not presented for simplicity but of those reviewed only the Trauma and Orthopaedics curriculum contained any global health competencies. These were very similar to the global health competencies in the CEM and RCP-GIM. Table 3 compares Collegiate competencies with the proposed undergraduate global health competencies.7\n\nFrom Table 3 we can see that The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) was the only College to require all trainees to \u2018be aware of (understand the work of) the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2019, or \u2018know the local, national and international structures for health care\u2019. These cross-cutting competencies have applicability to all specialties. Table 3 also demonstrates that there are a number of global health topics that are not covered by any of the postgraduate curricula such as health inequalities or the mobility of and inequalities in the global health workforce. The latter is of importance not only because of concerns around staffing health facilities in low- and middle-income countries but also because many of those undertaking postgraduate training in the UK will have qualified elsewhere, and large numbers of UK doctors work overseas at some time raising issues about the regulation and registration of physicians.\n\nAll 11 curricula contained numerous generic competencies where a global health perspective and/or international experience could be advantageous. These mostly related to caring for migrant or culturally different patients (e.g. maintaining an awareness of and having respect for \u2018socio-cultural contexts\u2019 in the assessment and management of patients, or communicating with patients whose first language is not English). There was brief reference in The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) curriculum to EU law, international conventions, international patient or professional organizations and to the prevalence of conditions in the UK in comparison to other European countries, however having knowledge of these was not an explicit learning outcome. Achievement of some competencies, such as RCPCH's awareness \u2018of child health exploitation issues including child prostitution, child labour and children in combat \u2026 and the effects of armed conflict on child health\u2019 or The Royal College of Pathologists' (RCPath's) \u2018impact on health of armed conflict, natural disasters and other social upheavals\u2019, would clearly benefit from a global perspective or international experience. Arguably all specialties, not just paediatrics, would benefit from an understanding of the role of the World Health Organization (WHO), and from an awareness of the global burden of disease.\n\nThere are a number of strengths and limitations to our study. First, all those reviewing the curricula have an interest in global health. This facilitated a shared understanding of what was meant by a global health competency and arguably helped with consistency across curriculum reviews. However, reviewers without a global health interest may have reached different conclusions. Secondly, the process of assignation of a competency to a category, though guided by the agreed definitions, is ultimately a subjective decision. While in some cases several people reviewed curricula, and in the FPH curriculum review good inter-rater reliability was achieved,22 this was not possible for all curricula. To reduce inconsistency all assignations to the global health category were reviewed by JH and discussed with reviewers. As demonstrated in Table 3, the global health competencies identified were very similar across the curricula indicating that this process was fairly successful. Finally, there were some discrepancies between the curricula in terms of exactly what \u2018a competency\u2019 was. Pragmatic decisions were taken where necessary and for this reason there are a number of caveats to the total number of competencies presented for each curriculum. These decisions were taken to increase the comparability of results between the curricula.\n\nThere is a strong case and increasing consensus on the need for a common minimum requirement of global health awareness that trainees of all specialties must attain. This can be achieved through a small number of common core competencies in global health, easily realizable without overseas experience, which are consistent across core curricula. These could cover issues such as the global burden of disease, global determinants of health, the role of international organizations in health, sustainable development and the potential structures of health-care systems.\n\nThese competencies do not need to be developed from scratch; those already introduced by Colleges and described in Table 3 can be used as a starting point. Such competencies can be framed to naturally follow on from those being introduced into undergraduate medical training.7 With common core competencies in place, Colleges can develop additional competencies relevant to their specialty at their own discretion. Levels of knowledge and understanding of global health issues will fit with standard levels of competence in curricula, though ensuring that they are covered by appropriate assessments will require a specific mandate from Colleges.\n\nTo seize this opportunity a forum for Colleges to collaborate will be required. This could either be through current structures, such as the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, or could be a separate venture organized by, for example, the General Medical Council or an enthusiastic College. With competencies in place their utility in facilitating better care within the NHS can be robustly assessed.\n\nFor trainees who want to take their enthusiasm for global health further there should be easily accessible further training in global health that complements ongoing specialty training. A tiered structure to this effect has previously been proposed.23\n\nThis study looked at the content of curricula linked to global health learning, however even where explicitly mentioned, tools to ensure adequate delivery of teaching and assessment of these competencies may be inadequate. For example knowledge of these competencies is not be routinely tested in either postgraduate exams or workplace-based assessments. Future areas of research may include exploring mechanisms to maximize the delivery and assessment of global health competencies, how the integration of these into training may impact the quality of care delivered in the UK, and the contribution of UK doctors to the broader global health agenda.\n\nGlobal health transcends traditional barriers between specialties as much as it does geographical boundaries, and the development of a set of core global health competencies is both judicious and timely. This article reflects a growing awareness across specialty trainees that coverage of global health in their curricula is inadequate. Addressing this gap will ensure that the UK has health professionals that are trained to meet the health challenges the UK faces in the future.\n\nOther than an interest in global health the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest\n\nNone declared\n\nNot applicable\n\nJH\n\nJAH had the idea for the paper, recruited trainee members of Royal College's International Committees or representatives via Alma Mata, reviewed the Faculty of Public Health's Curriculum with Drs Lee and Mandeville, oversaw the review of all curricula, coordinated the inputs for the first draft of the paper, led the writing of the final paper and has given final approval of the version to be published.
