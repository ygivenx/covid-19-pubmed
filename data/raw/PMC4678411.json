{"title": "Phosphonooxymethyl\nProdrug of Triptolide: Synthesis,\nPhysicochemical Characterization, and Efficacy in Human Colon Adenocarcinoma\nand Ovarian Cancer Xenografts", "body": "Triptolide (1, Figure 1), a diterpene\ntriepoxide, was first isolated from\nthe medicinal plant Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F\n(TWHF) and structurally characterized in 1972.1 In the following 43 years, it has been reported to be active in\nvitro by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of various\ncancer cell lines and as preventing tumor growth and metastases in\nvivo.2 More recently, triptolide has been\nfound to be effective against various cancers such as pancreatic cancer,3 neuroblastoma,104 breast\ncancer,105 and prostate cancer.18\n\nThe mechanisms of action of triptolide\nhave been extensively investigated,5,4 and evidence\nhas been provided that triptolide can covalently modify\nproteins presumably by epoxide ring opening reactions.1,2,6\u22128 It was recently\nshown that triptolide inhibits the ATPase activity of human XPB (xeroderma\npigmentosum B) by covalently binding Cys342 of XPB to the 12,13-epoxide.6,7 Because XPB is part of transcription factor THFIIH, RNA II polymerase-mediated\ntranscription and DNA excision repair are inhibited.6 Many of the observed anticancer effects can be explained\nby this mechanism, but other mechanisms9 have been observed such as epigenetic modifications, suppressing\nkinases, and Hsp70 expression.3,10,11 Triptolide was also reported to be the first DCTPP1 (dCTP pyrophosphatase)\ninhibitor.12 It is of interest to note\nthat this is a noncovalent interaction of triptolide with the target\nprotein. Furthermore, the compound has multiple biological activities\nthat could have value in other therapeutic areas.2,13 Triptolide\nwas reported to stimulate polycystin-2 channel opening, thereby restoring\ncalcium signaling and resulting in attenuation of cyst formation in\na mouse model of polycystic kidney disease.14 It is also known for its reversible male antifertility effects.15 In addition, triptolide was shown to preserve\ncognitive function in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease.16,17 The anticancer and other activities of triptolide\nsuch as its immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties are\nmore thoroughly described in recent reviews.18,5,9 Recent studies focus on the development\nof triptolide and its derivatives as potential antileukemic19 and antineoplastic agents.54,223\n\nDespite its promising bioactivities, poor aqueous solubility,\ndose-dependent\ntoxicity, narrow therapeutic window, and lack of patent protection\nof triptolide are impediments to its preclinical development and clinical\nsuccess. Two early stage clinical trials of triptolide as a potential\ndrug for rheumatoid arthritis were conducted in the US over a decade\nago.20,21 The 5-hydroxytriptolide derivative 5-hydroxytriptolide\n(LLDT-8, 2, Figure 1) is currently in phase I clinical trial in China for\nrheumatoid arthritis.13\n\nProdrug strategies, involving carboxylic and amino\nacid esters,\nhave been utilized previously with the intent to achieve desirable\nwater solubility of triptolide.22,23 While several prodrugs\nof triptolide have been reported in the literature, triptolide succinate\n(omtriptolide, F6008, PG490-88, 3, Figure 1) is the only one reported to have entered\nclinical trials.24 Unfortunately, the cleavage\nof the prodrug moiety was slow and incomplete, and significant interpatient\nvariability was reported.25 This does not\ndiscount the prodrug strategy but suggests that other prodrugs that\nprovide a reliable release of triptolide are needed. A nontoxic, water-soluble,\nchemically stable, and patentable prodrug approach would be a viable\noption to overcome some of the physicochemical limitations of triptolide\nfor the clinical development of this natural product.\n\nHistorically,\nthe use of a phosphate group as a promoiety has successfully\novercome numerous delivery problems of potential drugs.26\u221228 These prodrugs are formed by either direct linkage of a phosphate\nmoiety onto a hydroxyl group of a parent drug in the form of a phosphomonoester\nor by attaching it to the parent drug via a chemical linker. The phosphate\npromoiety is ionized at physiological pH, resulting in a significant\nincrease in aqueous solubility of poorly soluble phenol- and alcohol-bearing\nparent drugs.29\u221232 Additionally, these phosphomonoester prodrugs are typically stable\nwith long shelf-lives and undergo an alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1)-catalyzed\nbioconversion in vivo to release the parent alcohol or phenol drug\nand inorganic phosphate. Numerous phosphomonoester prodrugs have shown\ngood in vitro33\u221235 and in vivo36\u221238 conversion to the parent drug\nin the presence of alkaline phosphatases.\n\nThe aforementioned\nomtriptolide was ineffective in clinical trials\ndue to its incomplete and slow bioconversion in vivo.25 We hypothesized that the succinate promoiety directly attached\nto the 14-OH group of triptolide would not be easily accessible for\nenzymatic cleavage due to steric crowding. Therefore, the prerequisites\nfor a novel prodrug strategy of triptolide were three-fold: enhanced\naqueous solubility, chemical stability, and fast, complete bioconversion\nin vivo. We aimed to achieve these objectives by incorporating the\nphosphonooxymethyl promoiety, as it possesses a favorable combination\nof high aqueous solubility and chemical stability. This strategy has\nbeen successful for solubility enhancement of paclitaxel and propofol,\nand, in both cases, the promoiety was attached to a sterically hindered\nhydroxyl group.39 Previously, the synthesis\nand evaluation of the phosphonooxymethyl derivative of triptolide 4 (Figure 1) for pancreatic cancer40,41 and several other preclinical\ncancer models has been reported.246\u2212249 We are now describing an improved\nsynthesis for 4, its physicochemical characterization,\nand its pharmacodynamic evaluation in human colon adenocarcinoma and\novarian cancer xenografts via intraperitoneal and oral routes and\nusing less frequent dosing schedules than employed in previous studies.\n\nOur initial attempts to\nprepare 4 in two steps from triptolide by either O-alkylation\nwith chloromethyl phosphate diesters or direct alkylation of the hydroxyl\ngroup with chloroiodomethane were not successful.31,42,43 Therefore, an alternative strategy40 based on methylthiomethylation of the hydroxyl\ngroup was selected (Schemes 1 and 2) to furnish key intermediate 5.44 We observed complete conversion\nof triptolide during the Pummerer rearrangement, but a mixture of\nproducts was obtained. The products were separated by column chromatography\nand identified by NMR. While the target methylthiomethyl ether 5 was the main component (50\u201352% yield), acetoxymethyl\nether 6 was identified as a major byproduct (38% yield),\nand triptonide (7) formed in 10% (Scheme 1).\n\nThis composition is\nsimilar to what was previously observed for\nthis type of reaction using phenylsulfonyl derivatives.45 Our attempts to carry out a basic hydrolysis\nof the acetoxymethyl ether 6 resulted in decomposition\nof the product, but triptolide could be recovered by acidic hydrolysis\nof 6 in 75\u201380% yield. An alternative approach\n(Scheme 2) based on\ntreating triptolide with dimethyl sulfide and benzoyl peroxide in\nacetonitrile resulted in a similar yield of compound 5 (51%) with triptonide as the only side product in 46%. This methodology,\nhowever, allowed for significant reduction of the reaction time from\n5 days to 2 h and also made purification of 5 easier.\n\nIn the next step (Scheme 2), the conversion of methylthiomethyl ether 5 to dibenzyl phosphate 8 was achieved using an N-iodosuccinimide-mediated (NIS) nucleophilic displacement\nwith dibenzyl phosphate in CH2Cl2/THF in the\npresence of 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves.39 While the yield was high (91%), chromatographic purification on\nsilica gel was difficult because of pronounced decomposition due to\ninstability of the benzylic esters of the phosphate. The 50\u2013100\nmg scale flash chromatography experiments revealed approximately 20%\ndegradation. However, in larger scale preparations where contact between\nthe compound and silica gel is required for a longer period of time,\n60\u2013100% degradation was observed depending on the amount of\nsubstrate and the level of deactivation of the silica gel. Attempts\nto use alternate sorbents such as Florisil or alumina, as well as\ntriethylamine deactivation of silica gel, resulted in similar levels\nof degradation. It was not possible to avoid purification prior to\nhydrogenation due to the various sulfur derivatives formed during\nthe course of the synthesis. These compounds, even in minute quantities,\ncan poison the Pd/C catalyst used in the benzyl ether cleavage. This\nled to increased catalytic loading and longer reaction time, which\nin turn resulted in a larger number and quantity of impurities that\ncontaminated the final product. Additionally, during the formation\nof dibenzyl phosphate 8, 7\u201310% of succinimide\nwas produced from the reagent NIS, which coeluted during column chromatography.\nAn alternative purification methodology was developed utilizing a\nsequence of extractions that are described in Experimental\nSection, which removed most of the impurities while avoiding\nproduct decomposition. This methodology has proven reliable, efficient,\nand scalable. It results in the removal of most sulfur derivatives\nand succinimide without the use of chromatographic purification.\n\nIn the penultimate step, dibenzyl phosphate 8 was\nsubjected to hydrogenation in the presence of 10% Pd/C. The resultant\nphosphate was converted to 4 by treatment with sodium\ncarbonate. The final composition of the product included up to 6%\nof triptolide as a result of hydrolysis during the final chemical\nstep. Because the product decomposes during silica gel column chromatography,\nit was isolated in 99% purity by preparative HPLC using a C18 column.\nThe material is highly hygroscopic and was stored under nitrogen or\nargon gas.\n\nPhysicochemical characterizations\nof 4 were conducted to assess its solubility and chemical\nstability.\n\nAdjusting solution\npH can be a simple\nand effective method to increase the water solubility of a weakly\nacidic or basic injectable drug. However, pH adjustment is not a viable\napproach to increase the solubility of molecules such as triptolide\nthat lack ionizable groups. For such compounds, various strategies\nincluding the use of cosolvents, surfactants, and complexing agents\n(for example, parenterally safe cyclodextrins) have been used to overcome\naqueous solubility limitations. However, some of these techniques\ncan contribute significantly to toxicity. Ideally phosphonooxymethyl\nprodrugs will have good water solubility, particularly at physiological\npH. Avoiding pH extremes and/or cosolvent addition could allow for\nrapid parenteral infusion without the risk of drug precipitation.\nUsing HPLC, the aqueous solubility (buffered to pH 7.4 with Tris at\nroom temperature) of triptolide was determined to be 17 \u03bcg/mL\nwhile that of 4 was 61 mg/mL. Thus, by prodrug formation,\nthe solubility was enhanced 3600 times. We also estimated the second\ndissociation constant (pKa2) of 4. In solution, depending on the pH, the prodrug would exist\nin its diacidic, monobasic, or dibasic states as represented in Scheme 3. The pKa1 has limited pharmaceutical relevance, because the pH\nof most physiologically acceptable solutions would ensure ionization\nof the diacidic species. However, the pKa2 is significant given its influence on aqueous solubility, chemical\nstability, and effectiveness as an enzyme substrate to ensure bioconversion.\nTherefore, within the pharmaceutically relevant pH range, 4 would exist in an equilibrium between its monobasic and dibasic\nspecies. Thus, titration of an equilibrium mixture of these two species\nprovides an acid ionization constant, pKa2, whose value corresponds to the inflection point. Estimation of\nthis pKa2 using 31P NMR is\nadvantageous, as the 31P isotope has high natural abundance\n(100%) and its chemical shift is indicative of the change in ionization\nstate of the phosphorus moiety.46 The 31P NMR spectrum of 4 was obtained as a function\nof pH. The experimental data shown for the change in observed phosphorus\nchemical shifts of 4 in solutions at varying pH (Figure 2) was used to determine\npKa2 (eq 4, experimental part). The pH dependency of this observed\nchemical shift measurement resulted in a sigmoidal curve, which is\ntypical of an acid\u2013base titration. The pKa2 value of 4 was found to be 6.61, which compares\nfavorably to estimates from the literature.47\u221249 At pH 7.4, 4 would exist predominantly as a dianion, thus ensuring high\nsolubility.\n\nFollowing oral dosing,\nprodrugs are exposed to a wide pH range in the GI tract, from highly\nacidic in the stomach to neutral in the colon. Also, a wide array\nof hydrolytic enzymes, such as pepsin and pancreatin, are present\nin the GI tract. These enzymes have the natural function of digesting\nmacromolecules for use as nutrients, but they can also bind and hydrolyze\ndrug compounds. Therefore, prodrugs must be stable in the acidic,\nbasic, and enzymatic conditions of the GI tract for in vivo oral dosing.\nThe excipients in a formulation may also promote prodrug decomposition.\nTherefore, in vitro physiological stability of prodrugs in various\nbuffers (pH 1\u20139) and in simulated gastrointestinal fluids should\nbe assessed to gain insight into the stability of prodrugs. Thus, 4 was incubated with simulated gastric fluid (SGF), simulated\nintestinal fluid (SIF), and various buffers (pH 1\u20139). Oral\ndosing exposes compounds to pH 1\u20132 in the stomach, pH 4.5 at\nthe beginning of the small intestine, pH 6.6 on average for the small\nintestine, and pH 5\u20137 in the colon. The gastric emptying time\nvaries from 0.5\u20131 h in the fasted state to several hours after\na heavy meal. SGF simulates stomach fluid and incorporates acidic\nand enzymatic hydrolysis conditions. SIF mimics the pH and hydrolytic\nenzymes in the intestine. Incubation of 4 in these solutions\nis a rapid way to determine if 4 would be stable under\nconditions found in the GI tract. Compound 4 demonstrated\npH-dependent stability and rapidly degraded with conversion to triptolide\nin simulated gastric fluid and at very low pH values (1\u20132)\nand in simulated gastric fluid whereas it was markedly stable at higher\npH values (3\u20139) and in simulated intestinal fluid (Table 1). The shorter half-life\nat low pH for 4 could result in acid-mediated removal\nof the promoiety in the stomach. However, 4 can be \u201cprotected\u201d\nfrom the stomach acid by enteric coating.\n\nProdrugs, by their nature, tend to be less chemically\nstable than\nthe parent drugs. To be practically useful, prodrugs must possess\nadequate chemical stability under the conditions of their use. Prodrugs\nintended for intravenous administration should exhibit adequate solution\nstate stability so that a ready-to-use preparation with a reasonably\nlong shelf life (i.e., 2 or more years) can be formulated. If the\nsolution state stability is inadequate, the drug can be formulated\nas a dry powder (usually by lyophilization) and reconstituted into\nsolution right before administration. For example, Safadi and co-workers\ndescribed the development of phosphonooxymethyl carbonates as novel,\nwater-soluble prodrugs of hindered alcohols. However, the lack of\nadequate chemical stability limited the commercial and clinical potential\nof this prodrug concept.34 The chemical\nhydrolysis of 4 was followed at pH of 7.4 because the\nneutral pH range is perfectly suited for formulation delivery from\na physiological perspective. We found that the hydrolysis of 4 followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. Using the pseudo-first-order\nrate constants, determined at several temperatures between 40 and\n70 \u00b0C (Table 2), the Arrhenius plot was drawn (not shown). From this plot, the\nactivation energy (Ea) was calculated\nto be 63.4 kJ/mol. By extrapolating the plot to lower temperatures,\nthe kobsd at 25 and at 4 \u00b0C were\nobtained. This enabled the calculation of the half-life (t1/2) and shelf life (t90)\nof 4 at 25 and 4 \u00b0C (Table 3).\n\nThus, the chemical stability of 4 at neutral pH was\nfound to be quite satisfactory giving an estimated shelf life of approximately\n2 years (at 4 \u00b0C). Therefore, the formulation of 4 in a freeze-dried form or as an aqueous solution at pH 7.4 is predicted\nto have an acceptable shelf life.\n\nA prerequisite for a successful phosphate\nprodrug strategy is conversion\ncatalyzed by alkaline phosphatase. In general, phosphomonoesters,\nsuch as phosphonooxymethyl prodrugs, are good substrates for both\nacid and alkaline phosphatases which are found in a wide variety of\nliving organisms including bacteria, plants, and animals.50 Alkaline phosphatase is found throughout the\nbody and is mainly associated with plasma membranes of the intestine,\nplacenta, bone, liver, and kidney at high concentrations.51 This enzyme participates in hydrolase/transferase\nreactions on a variety of phosphate-containing compounds under physiological\nconditions. For the in vitro evaluation of the dephosphorylation of 4, alkaline phosphatase from bovine intestinal mucosa was\nchosen. As implied by its name, this enzyme has maximum activity in\nthe alkaline region (pH 9.8). The in vitro assay for phosphate monoester\nprodrugs is typically performed at pH 9.8, an optimum pH for the activity\nof alkaline phosphatases. The evaluation of bioconversion kinetics\nis, however, more relevant if performed at physiological pH. Thus,\na change in pH of reaction media to 7.4 may, in principle, reduce\nthe catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. However, for proof-of-concept,\nconfirming that 4 was indeed the substrate of alkaline\nphosphatase was paramount. Clearly, if 4 is administered\nparenterally in humans, the overwhelming presence of alkaline phosphate\nin vivo should guarantee bioconversion.\n\nThe in vitro enzymatic\nlability of 4 was recently reported by us.40 We carried out the bioconversion of 4 into triptolide in the presence of alkaline phosphatase in glycine\nbuffer at pH 9.8 (Scheme 4). Exposure of 4 to phosphatases cleaves the\nphosphate group and releases the hydroxymethyl derivative 9, which is chemically unstable and spontaneously releases triptolide\nand formaldehyde. The release of formaldehyde from prodrugs could\nraise a possible concern because of perceived toxicity.52 However, it is well-known that the turnover\nof formaldehyde in the human body from endogenous formaldehyde production\nby normal metabolism and from exogenous exposure (for example from\nfood) is in the range of 31\u201359 g per day.52 Because prodrugs only release milligram amounts of formaldehyde\nfrom phosphonooxymethyl prodrugs per day, the small amount of formaldehyde\nadds very little to the baseline exposure of gram quantities produced\nby normal metabolism. In addition, given the short half-life of 1.5\nmin for formaldehyde, which is converted to formic acid, exposure\nto formaldehyde produced by a prodrug would be limited to approximately\n10 min.52\n\nBoth the disappearance of 4 and\nthe formation of triptolide\nwere measured. Compound 4 degradation was a first-order\nprocess. The half-life (t1/2) of 4 was determined to be 2 min in the presence of alkaline phosphatase,\nshowing rapid conversion of the modified drug into its parent compound.\nAdditionally, 4 was found to be stable for 1 h in a similar\nassay conducted in the absence of alkaline phosphatase. The short\nhalf-life of 4 in this assay indicates that the enzymatically\ncatalyzed breakdown of 4 occurred at a fast rate. A short\nhalf-life for 4 is consistent with our hypothesis that\na methylene-linked phosphate prodrug would be released rapidly and\nnot be hampered by steric hindrance as seen with the succinate prodrug\nomtriptolide. Steric hindrance has been noted in the bioconversion\nof a number of phosphate and phosphonooxymethyl prodrugs.33,53\n\nIt was previously reported that compound 4 can reduce tumor growth, prevent tumor progression, and improve\nsurvival in multiple mouse models of pancreatic cancer.40,41 The efficacy of 4 has also been demonstrated in preclinical\nmodels of osteosarcoma, nonsmall cell lung carcinoma, human papillomavirus-positive\nhead and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and ovarian cancer.246\u2212249 These studies evaluated the efficacy of 4 after daily\nintraperitoneal (IP) administration. Here we used tumor xenograft\nmodels to evaluate the efficacy of 4 when administered\non a less frequent schedule and when administered by the oral route.\n\nThis study was designed to evaluate the potential efficacy and\ntoxicity of 4 when administered IP daily (QD) over a\nrange of doses and when administered on various schedules for 28 days.\nThe animal model used in the study was the HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma\ncell line implanted in female athymic nude mice as a subcutaneous\ntumor. Treatment groups with ten mice per group included four dose\nlevels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 mg/kg) and five dose regimens over\nthe 4-week treatment period (daily [QD] for 4 weeks; QD for 2 weeks\nthen no treatment for 2 weeks; QD for weeks 1 and 3 with no treatment\nduring weeks 2 and 4; 3\u00d7/week for 4 weeks; QD for 2 weeks then\n3\u00d7/week). Compound 4 administered daily IP was found\nto be effective in reducing or eliminating xenograft tumors of the\nhuman colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 in this animal model at dose levels\nfrom 0.3 to 0.9 mg/kg (Figure 3). Dose regimens in which 0.9 mg/kg of 4 was\nadministered less frequently than daily or with a break from daily\ndosing were also found to be effective (Figure 4). In the groups that received 0.9 mg/kg\ndaily for 4 weeks or 0.9 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks followed by 3\u00d7/week,\nall mice that survived until the end of the study (7/10 and 9/10,\nrespectively) were tumor free. Compound 4 was generally\nwell tolerated in female athymic nude mice with the only test-article\nrelated deaths observed in those mice receiving 0.9 mg/kg doses for\nat least 14 consecutive days (3 in the \u201cQD for 4 weeks\u201d\ngroup and 1 each in the \u201cQD for 2 weeks\u201d and the \u201cQD\nfor 2 weeks then 3\u00d7/week\u201d groups). Clinical signs of toxicity\nwere noted in some mice in higher dose groups after 14 days of dosing.\nThe frequency of mortality and severity of adverse clinical signs\nescalated with dose level and frequency. The mice receiving a daily\ndose of 0.9 mg/kg had the least mean group weight gain and the highest\nincidence of skin irritation and necrosis toward the end of the study.\nGroups receiving a lower dose of 4 or 0.9 mg/kg on an\nintermittent schedule had fewer clinical signs of toxicity and higher\nweight gain over the course of the study.\n\nThis study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability\nof 4 in a mouse model of human ovarian cancer when administered\nvia an intraperitoneal and oral route. The animal model used in this\nstudy was the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line implanted in female\nathymic nude mice as a subcutaneous tumor. Treatments included daily\ndoses of 4 ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 1.2 mg/kg (ten mice\nper group). Administration of 4 by intraperitoneal injection\nwas effective and well tolerated in female athymic nude mice with\nsubcutaneous xenograft tumors of the human A2780 ovarian carcinoma\nat daily doses of 0.6 or 0.9 mg/kg (data not shown). Administration\nof 4 by oral gavage was also effective at daily doses\nof 0.6 or 0.9 mg/kg but with slightly higher rates of morbidity and\nmortality (Figure 5). Frequency of mortality and severity of adverse clinical signs\nescalated with dose level and only two mice in the 1.2 mg/kg oral\ndose group survived beyond day 5 (data not shown). Clinical signs\nof acute toxicity included anorexia, dehydration, and moribund condition\nor death. In the vehicle control group, 8 of 10 mice were euthanized\nbefore the end of the study because tumor volume had surpassed the\ntumor volume end point. However, in the 0.6 mg/kg and 0.9 mg/kg groups,\nmost of the mice survived until the end of the study (7 of 10 and\n6 of 10, respectively) and all but one in each group was tumor free.\n\nTo\novercome solubility problems associated with the natural products,\nthe disodium phosphonooxymethyl prodrug of triptolide was prepared.\nThe synthesis, physicochemical characterization, and in vivo efficacy\nin mouse models of human colon adenocarcinoma and human ovarian carcinoma\ndemonstrated that 4 has suitable properties to be a clinical\ncandidate. Because the synthesis could be accomplished in three steps\nfrom the natural product, scale-up of this method for the clinical\nuse of the prodrug does not pose a problem. The chemical stability\nof 4, with a predicted shelf life of about 2 years at\n4 \u00b0C, will allow storage of the prodrug over an extended time\nperiod. The in vivo mouse models of human colon adenocarcinoma and\nhuman ovarian carcinoma provide additional information about the efficacy\nand tolerability of 4, suggesting that daily administration\nmay not be required and that 4 may be effective when\nadministered orally. After additional preclinical safety and toxicity\ntesting, compound 4 entered phase I clinical trials in\n2013 for evaluation in advanced gastrointestinal tumors.262\n\nA solution of triptolide (1; 2.0 g, 5.6 mmol)\nin acetic acid (100 mL, 1.8 mol) and a solution\nof acetic anhydride (20 mL, 220 mmol) in DMSO (30 mL, 420 mmol) were\nmixed and stirred at room temperature for a period of 5 days. The\nreaction mixture was then poured into water (1 L) and neutralized\nwith solid sodium bicarbonate added portionwise. The mixture was extracted\nwith ethyl acetate (4 \u00d7 250 mL), and the combined organic extract\nwas dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was removed under\nreduced pressure. The oily residue was purified by flash chromatography\n(ethyl acetate\u2013hexanes 1:5) to produce compound 5 (1.21 g; 52%) as a white foam. The NMR data matched those reported.54 HRMS calculated for (C22H28O6SNa) required m/z [M\n+ Na]+ 443.1505, found m/z 443.1507. In addition, acetoxymethyl ether 6 (896 mg,\n38%) and triptonide 7(55) (191\nmg, 10%) were isolated and identified.\n\nTo\na solution of triptolide (19.95 g, 55.36\nmmol) in anhydrous acetonitrile (560 mL) at 0 \u00b0C dimethyl sulfide\n(31.8 mL, 433 mmol; 8 equiv) was added. Then benzoyl peroxide (53.7\ng, 221 mmol, 4 equiv) was added portionwise during the course of 2\nh. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 2\nh, diluted with ethyl acetate (1200 mL), washed with diluted sodium\ncarbonate (saturated Na2CO3: H2O,\n1:2) (2 \u00d7 150 mL) and brine (150 mL), and dried over sodium sulfate\novernight. The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure, and\nthe resulting viscous mass containing crystals was filtered through\na glass filter and washed with cold ethyl acetate (50 mL). The collected\nsolid was air-dried to yield triptonide (7; 7.01 g).\nThe filtrate\u2019s volume was removed under reduced pressure, and\nthe residue was dried overnight under high vacuum to produce 47.4\ng of crude product. The crude product was purified by column chromatography\non silica gel using EtOAc\u2013hexanes (1:2) and then EtOAc\u2013CH2Cl2 (1:1 followed by 2:1) mixtures as eluents to\nproduce the target compound 5 (11.97 g; 51.4%) and additional\namounts of triptonide (7; 2.10 g; the total yield of\ntriptonide was 9.11 g, 46%).\n\nTo a solution of compound 5 (6.0 g; 14.3 mmol) in dry\ndichloromethane (240 mL) were added powdered 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves\n(6.0 g). The reaction mixture was placed under dry nitrogen, and then\na solution of dibenzyl phosphate (4.78 g (17.2 mmol) and N-iodosuccinimide (3.86 g; 17.2 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran\n(240 mL) was added slowly at 15\u201320 \u00b0C. After the addition\nwas completed, the reaction mixture was stirred at rt for a period\nof 3 h, filtered, and diluted with dichloromethane (2400 mL). The\nsolution was shaken with 0.1 M thiosulfate (240 mL) until fully decolorized\nand then washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate (240 mL) and brine\n(240 mL). The organic solution was dried over sodium sulfate for 0.5\nh and filtered, and then the solvent was removed under reduced pressure.\nThe residue was dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (900 mL), and\nthe solution was extracted with pentane (4 \u00d7 200 mL). The acetonitrile\nsolution was evaporated on a rotary evaporator followed by high vacuum\novernight drying. Yield: 8.42 g (91%) of dibenzyl ester 8, which was used directly in the next step without additional purification.\nThe small sample was purified by silica gel flash chromatography (50%\nEtOAc/hexanes) to give compound 8 as white foam. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4 0.72 (d, 3H, J =  6.8 Hz), 0.89 (d, 3H, J =  6.8 Hz),\n1.05 (s, 3H), 1.27 (m, 1H), 1.48 (m, 1H), 1.82 (dd, 1H, J1 = 14.7 and J2 = 13.4 Hz), 2.03\u20132.35\n(m, 4H), 2.64 (m, 1H), 3.14 (d, 1H, J =  5.5 Hz),\n3.46 (d, 1H, J =  3.1 Hz), 3.65 (s, 1H), 3.76 (d,\n1H, J =  3.1 Hz), 4.65 (m, 2H), 5.02 (m, 4H), 5.27\n(m, 1H), 5.47 (m, 1H), 7.34 (m, 10H) ppm; 13C NMR (100\nMHz, CDCl3) \u03b4 13.6, 16.8, 17.0, 23.3, 26.2, 29.62,\n29.67, 35.7, 40.3, 54.7, 55.2, 59.3, 61.1, 63.6, 64.0, 69.36, 69.39,\n69.42, 69.45, 69.9, 78.2, 92.9, 93.0, 125.5, 127.9, 128.0, 128.6,\n135.5, 135.6, 160.1, 173.2 ppm; HRMS calculated for (C35H39O10PNa) required m/z [M + Na]+ 673.2179, found m/z 673.2176. Analytical HPLC tR = 8.5 min.\n\nTo a 1 L round-bottom flask equipped with septa and stir\nbar were added Pd/C (1.8 g) and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (10 mL).\nThe flask was cooled in an ice bath and saturated with hydrogen gas\nusing a bubbler under stirring up to full replacement of air. The\nbubbler was removed, and a solution of dibenzyl ester 8 (8.42 g; 12.94 mmol) in dry THF (700 mL) was added into the flask\nthrough a cannula while stirring and cooling the flask with an ice\nbath. Then the reaction mixture was saturated with hydrogen again\nand left under stirring in the hydrogen atmosphere for 3 h. The reaction\nmixture was monitored by TLC (EtOAc\u2013hexanes, 3:2) until disappearance\nof dibenzyl ester 8. After completion, the reaction mixture\nwas purged with nitrogen and filtered through a pad of Celite. The\nTHF solution was cooled to 10\u201312 \u00b0C and an ice cold solution\nof anhydrous sodium carbonate (1.235 g; 11.65 mmol) in deionized water\n(240 mL) was added slowly with stirring to keep the temperature below\n18 \u00b0C. Then the solvents were removed on a rotary evaporator\nfollowed by high vacuum evaporation to give a slightly cloudy aqueous\nsolution. The solution was placed into equipment for continuous extraction\nwith dichloromethane and underwent extraction for 72 h. Then the aqueous\nsolution was separated from CH2Cl2 and extracted\nwith ethyl acetate (4 \u00d7 30 mL). Traces of organic solvent were\nremoved by rotary evaporation, and the aqueous solution was passed\nthrough a 0.2 \u03bcm Acrodisc syringe filter to give a clear aqueous\nsolution. The solution was freeze-dried, producing 4 (5.64\ng; 85%). The product includes 6% of triptolide. Purification by preparative\nHPLC eluted with 15% methanol in water provides 99% pure 4 as a colorless hygroscopic powder. 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O) \u03b4 0.81 (d, 3H, J =  6.8 Hz), 1.00\n(d, 3H, J =  6.8 Hz), 1.03 (s, 3H), 1.35 (m, 1H),\n1.50 (m, 1H), 2.00 (dd, 1H, J1 = 14.7\nand J2 = 13.4 Hz), 2.08\u20132.61 (m,\n4H), 2.85 (m, 1H), 3.63 (d, 1H, J =  5.5 Hz), 3.81\n(d, 1H, J =  3.1 Hz), 3.86 (s, 1H), 4.12 (d, 1H, J =  3.1 Hz), 4.92 (m, 2H), 5.07 (m, 2H) ppm; 13C NMR (100 MHz, D2O) \u03b4 12.9, 16.0, 16.3, 16.5, 22.3,\n25.5, 28.9, 35.2, 39.8, 55.4, 56.1, 61.0, 61.5, 65.1, 65.5, 71.9,\n77.6, 91.7, 123.8, 164.2, 177.3 ppm; HRMS calculated for (C21H26O10P) required m/z [M + 1]+ 469.1264, found m/z 469.1267.\n\nApproximately 5 mg\nof each compound was weighed into 2 mL glass vials (in triplicate);\n0.2 mL of Tris buffer (pH 7.4) was added for samples of 4 and 2 mL for triptolide samples. Each buffered solution was saturated\nwith 4 or triptolide. The vials were then capped, sonicated,\nand vortexed prior to submersion in a constant temperature shaking\nbath (100 shakes/min maintained at 25 \u00b0C) for 24\nh after which time excess solid drug was removed from the saturated\nsolution by centrifugation and filtration. The clear filtrates were\nthen sampled and appropriately diluted for quantification by HPLC.\n\nA 4 mM solution of 4 was prepared in 10%\nD2O in an isotonic solution to prepare stock solutions\nof 15 mL volume. Samples of varying pH were prepared by adding small\nvolumes (\u03bcL) of 1 N HCl or 1 N NaOH solution and recording the\nresulting pH (Denver Instrument, Bohemia, NY). Aliquots (0.5 mL) were\nwithdrawn from the stock solution after each alteration of pH and\ntransferred to NMR tubes. Twelve to fifteen such samples for analysis\nwere prepared in the pH range of 3\u201310. Solutions were analyzed\nby 31P NMR spectroscopy using a 400 MHz NMR instrument.\nThe change in chemical shift was recorded as a function of pH. The 31P probe was calibrated using 85% H3PO4 as an external standard for the chemical shift.\n\nIn solution,\ndepending on the pH and the dissociation constant (Ka), 4 exists in its diacidic, monobasic,\nor dibasic fractions as shown in Scheme 3. The fraction of 4 in its diacidic\nfraction may be ignored given the low and unlikely pH of such a solution\nwithin a physiological scenario. The fraction of 4 in\nthe monobasic form (fmb) and the fraction\nin the dibasic form (fdb) can, therefore,\nbe expressed by eqs 1 and 2, respectively:12\n\n[H+] represents\nthe molar hydrogen ion concentration.\nThe observed chemical shift (\u03b4obsd) of the 31P signal is a product of the mole fraction of the prodrug species\nmultiplied by its chemical shift and is expressed by eq 3.3\u03b4mb and\n\u03b4db represent the chemical shifts for the monobasic\nand the dibasic\nfraction of 4, respectively. Substituting eqs 1 and 2 into 3, gives eq 4.4\n\nThe experimental data obtained indicate a shift\nin the 31P chemical shift with a variation in pH. This\nchange in observed\nchemical shift as a function of pH is fit to eq 4 using the GraphPad Prism graphing software\n(Version 5.0, GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA) to estimate the\nsecond dissociation constant (pKa2) of 4.\n\nA 20.0 mg amount\nof 4 was dissolved in Sodium Chloride Injection USP,\nand the volume was\nmade up to 100 mL. Similarly, 3.00 mg of 4 was dissolved\nin Sodium Chloride Injection USP and the volume made up to 100 mL.\nThese two constituted the \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d\nconcentration formulations, respectively. Ampules were sterilized,\nto each ampule was added 0.5 mL of the solution of 4,\nand then they were flame-sealed. Ampules were stored in ovens maintained\nat 70, 60, 50, and 40 \u00b0C. Solutions stored at 70 \u00b0C were\nsampled 4, 8, 10, 14, and 24 h after storage. Solutions stored at\n60 \u00b0C were sampled 8, 14, 24, 32, 48, and 72 h after storage.\nSolutions stored at 50 \u00b0C were sampled 2, 4, 6, 8, and 11 days\nafter storage. Solutions stored at 40 \u00b0C were sampled 4, 8, 13,\n17, and 21 days after storage. The solutions were analyzed by HPLC\nas described in Experimental Section.\n\nSimulated\ngastric fluid (SGF): The fluid was generated by preparing a solution\nof sodium chloride (0.20 g), concentrated HCl (0.70 mL), and pepsin\n(Sigma, P-7000, 0.32 g) in deionized water (95 mL). The final volume\nwas adjusted to 100 mL by addition of deionized water. Simulated intestinal\nfluid (SIF): The fluid was generated by preparing a solution of monobasic\npotassium phosphate (KH2PO4, 0.68 g), 0.1 N\naqueous sodium hydroxide (38 mL), and pancreatin (Sigma, P-1625, 1.0\ng) in deionized water (57 mL). The pH of the solution was adjusted\nto 7.5 by addition of 1 N aqueous sodium hydroxide, and then the final\nvolume was adjusted to 100 mL by addition of deionized water.\n\nThe source\nof cell lines for tumor xenografts was a cryopreserved vial supplied\nby ATCC. The HT-29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line was established\nfrom the tumor tissue of a 44-year old adult female. Cells were grown\nas a monolayer in cell culture-treated disposable flasks and cultured\nin HyClone McCoy\u2019s 5A culture media supplemented with 10% v/v\nfetal bovine serum. The original vial was thawed and cultured to create\na master cell bank (MCB). The MCB vials were tested for contamination\nby mycoplasma organisms and for a panel of selected rodent pathogens\nand confirmed negative prior to culture of cells for implantation\nin research animals. Mice were injected subcutaneously on the right\nflank with 1.74 \u00d7 106 HT-29 tumor cells in a solution\nof 50% Martigel/50% unsupplemented McCoy\u2019s 5A culture medium\nin a volume of 0.1 mL using a 25 gauge needle.\n\nThe A2780 human\novarian cancer cell line was established from tumor tissue from an\nuntreated patient. The source of the cell line for tumor xenografts\nin this study was a cryopreserved vial ordered from the ECACC (European\nCollection of Cell Cultures) via the vendor Sigma-Aldrich. Cells were\ngrown as a monolayer in cell culture-treated disposable flasks and\ncultured in RPMI 1640 culture media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal\nbovine serum. The original vial was thawed and cultured to create\nan MCB. The MCB vials were tested for contamination by mycoplasma\norganisms and for a panel of selected rodent pathogens and confirmed\nnegative prior to culture of cells for implantation in research animals.\nMice were each injected subcutaneously on the right or left flank\nwith 2.5 \u00d7 106 tumor cells in a solution of 50% Matrigel/50%\nunsupplemented RPMI 1640 culture medium in a volume of 0.1 mL.\n\nFemale athymic nude mice, age 7 to 9 weeks, were received from\nTaconic Farms (Albany, NY). The animals were examined and weighed\non the day following receipt, and weights were measured and recorded\ntwice weekly thereafter. All animals were allowed to acclimate to\nthe laboratory environment for at least 7 days prior to subcutaneous\ninjection of cancer cells. The average tumor volume at randomization\nwas 110 mm3 for the HT-29 study and 188 mm3 for\nthe A2780 study. There were 10 mice in each group, and the duration\nof treatment was 28 days for the HT-29 study and 30 days for the A2780\nstudy. The dose concentration for each animal was based on the average\nof the body weight measurement for all of the animals in its respective\ndose group. The carboplatin dose in the A2780 study was 60 mg/kg administered\ntwice each week. The test article was formulated in USP saline and\ndelivered in a volume of 0.2 mL.\n\nThe following parameters and\nend points were evaluated: tumor volume,\ntumor volume changes, tumor weight at study end, clinical signs, survival,\nbody weights, and body weight changes. Tumor measurements were performed\nat least twice weekly following the first appearance of tumors. A\ncalibrated digital caliper was used to measure the length and width\nof each tumor. Tumor volume was calculated by the formula L \u00d7 W2/2, where W is the smallest dimension recorded. Tumor volumes and\ntumor weights are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM."}
