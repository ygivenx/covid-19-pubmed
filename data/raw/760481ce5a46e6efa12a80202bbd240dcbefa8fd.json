{"title": "Evaluating an Upper Respiratory Disease Panel on the Portable MinION Sequencer", "body": "of symptoms, from conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and mild respiratory infections to lifethreatening pneumonias in young adults and blood stream and brain infections in immunocompromised hosts. Enterovirus 68 has recently shown severe respiratory illness in other countries such as the Philippines, the Netherlands, and Japan [13, 19] , and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in the Middle East [33, 34] along with the H7N9 influenza outbreak in China [39] has put focus on new and emerging pathogens that may be introduced into immunologically na\u00efve populations or recombined into novel forms through human-human or human-animal transmission.\n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are now capable of providing a whole genome sequence or metagenomics for a wide range of organisms [16, 36] . NGS is being applied with increasing frequency in clinical microbiology laboratories to detect and characterize pathogens, thereby replacing the currently used Sanger sequencing methods [3, 39] . Sanger sequencing has been a reliable and robust method that has served clinical laboratories well for over several decades; however, it is labor intensive, slow, and not easily adapted for processing large genomes or large samples sets.\n\nOxford Nanopore's MinION may therefore provide us with new opportunities to track infectious disease, for example, rapid sequencing of viral genomes in response to the early phase of influenza pandemics, or for determination of coronavirus virus genotypes during outbreaks. In addition, sequencing will allow for rapid sequencing of viral genomes and provides an opportunity to gain insight into viral genetic drift (single nucleotide polymorphism), emergence of new strains such as SARS-like coronavirus or MERS-CoV, and transmission. To date, a limited number of pathogenic viral studies have been done with the MinION, and all of the published results have focused on sequencing DNA rather than RNA, which is the focus of this The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of using the MinION to sequence URD organisms present in clinical nasal washes using targeted amplification, WGA and whole transcriptome amplification (WTA) of low titer URD samples. \n\nStandard targeted PCR was done per using primers listed in Table 1 and the SuperScript III OneStep RT-PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 ng of DNA-free RNA or RNA-free DNA was used for each 50-\u03bcL reaction. All PCR reactions were accomplished with 1.0 ul of each primer at 10 uM. RT-PCR thermocycling parameters were as follows: 30 minutes at 50\u00b0C, 2 minutes at 95\u00b0C, and then 35 cycles of 30 seconds at 95\u00b0C, 30 seconds at 52\u00b0C, and 75 seconds at 68\u00b0C, followed with a final extension at 68\u00b0C for 5 minutes. PCR thermocycling was accomplished with AccuStartII PCR Supermix of the DNA fragments was completed using barcoding kit (EXP-PBC001). Libraries kit used for each of the sequencing libraries are shown in Table 2 and 3, as well as the amount of starting material and flow cells type. Library preparations were done as described by the manufacturer and were quantified using a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies).\n\nIn each case, the cDNA/DNA was end-repaired in a 100-\u00b5L reaction containing 0.5-2 \u00b5g of nucleic acid (depending on the run) in 80 \u00b5L water, 10 \u00b5L of 10X end-repair buffer (from the NEB Next End Repair Module), and 1 \u00b5L of enzyme mix. DNA and cDNA were quantified using a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies) and resuspended in molecular grade water as the starting material for library preparation per the instruction of the manufacturer. End-repair was performed per the manufacturer's instructions with the exception that the incubation time was increased to 15 minutes. The resulting blunt-ended DNA was cleaned up using 1.0 \u00d7 volume of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the exception that 80% ethanol was used instead of 70%, and the DNA was eluted in 30 \u00b5L molecular grade water. Ten \u00b5L of adapter mix and 2 \u00b5L hairpin (HP) adapter were added to the 30 \u00b5L dA-tailed DNA, then 8 \u00b5L of molecular grade water followed by the addition of 50 \u00b5L Blunt/TA ligase master mix (NEB). The contents were briefly mixed and the reaction was left to proceed at room temperature for 15 minutes. One \u00b5L of HP tether was added, mixed briefly, and incubated 15 minutes at room temperature. The sample was cleaned up using 1.0 \u00d7 by volume AMPure XP beads according to the manufacturer's instructions with the exception that the DNA was eluted into 25 \u00b5L of elution library buffer at 37\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The beads were removed by placing the tube into a 1.5-mL magnet and the supernatant was transferred to a low binding 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube and placed on ice until the sequencing flow cell was loaded.

The sequencing libraries were prepared using either the Illumina TruSeq Nano or Nextera XT library kits (Illumina) with150-bp paired-end sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq.\n\nRead data were extracted from the native HDF5 format (Fast 5) and converted into FASTA using poretools [25] and sequence reads were assess for quality and trimmed with Nanofilt [9] Quality reads with a q-score lower than 7 were omitted. Illumina reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic 0.36 using the following settings: trim reads: Leading: 3, Trailing: 3, and Sliding Window: 4:15.\n\nTaxonomic identification was used to verified for each data set by using bioinformatics packages Burrows-Wheeler Alignment MEM (BWA; aligned to reference and Human GR2) and SAM Tools was used to extract statistics and error rate per 100 bases [21, 22] . Sequence reads were filtered for any human sequence contributions prior to visualization. Tables 2 and 3 listed the analysis tools used for each data set.

All genomes, viral and bacterial were downloaded from NCBI Ref Seq (May, 2015) and were used to build the Kraken database (version 0.10.4) with k=31. Bracken was used for reassign alignments to the species level and visualization was accomplished with Krona [31] using the highest of number of hits (lowest evalue) or Metrichor's WIMP. Viral and bacterial databases were obtained from NCBI viral genomes resource [2] . Read percentage identity is defined as 100 * matches/ (matches + deletions + insertions + mismatches). Fraction of reads aligned are defined as (alignment length + insertions -deletions)/ (alignment length + unaligned length -deletions + insertions) [21] . was used verify the Metrichor WIMP identification. All of the organisms listed above were successfully sequenced on the MinION and identified correctly using the WIMP application, uses a databank of reference sequences for viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Figure 1 shows an a representative example of the data analysis for an influenza A H1N1 isolate listed in Table 1 . All viruses and bacteria listed in Tables 2 and 3 were correctly identified using WIMP. In addition, BWA and SAM Tools was used to verify that the alignment for each of the isolates listed in Tables 2.\n\nAll rights reserved.

For example shown in Table 1 , the Influenza A analysis had 114 high quality sequence reads and 104 reads (87.3%) were classified as Influenza A (Table 2 ).\n\nIn addition, MinION sequence identification was further verified by using the same NA extractions for libarary preparation for the Illumina's Miseq. BWA MEM alignment of the reads were in agreement with Metrichor's identification for each of the nasal wash samples listed in Table 2 ). The Nanopore kits and flow cells used early in this study perform well in regards to identifying the isolates; however, the number of reads that passed were lower than expected probably due improper amplicons to adapter ratios used in the ligation step.\n\nWTA was used with NA extracted from low titer clinical nasal washes and the isolated RNA (Table 3) .\n\nAll rights reserved.

Future barcoding pooling protocols should include a Tapestation (Agilent) quantification in terms of fragment length, which can be used to calculate of the nM concentration; nevertheless, this experiment demonstrated that the use of Qubit quantifications is sufficient for rapid pooling of multiplex libraries.\n\nMetrichor's cloud basecalling WIMP application correctly 2D analyzed, demultiplexed sequences and identified the organisms for each virus and bacteria in the library pool ( Figure   3F ). All of the URD organisms listed in Table 3 were reevaluated using Bracken to verify Metrichor's identification and visualized with KRONA ( Figure 3A -E).\n\nH. influenzae and Coronavirus 229E libraries were prepared using a rapid 1D library preparation.\n\nThis approach is suitable for WGA products and purified DNA with long fragments. The average Coronavirus 229E length from WTA was approximately 10 kb and the H. influenzae was 25 kb prior to library preparation. The H. influenzae sequencing run was allowed to run for 17.5 hours\n\nThe total base yield was 44.85 million and a quality score was centered on 9 (S1). The read length was from 2000 bp and 24050 reads with the majority of the fragments at approximately 5000 bp. H. influenzae was correctly identified by the Metrichor's WIMP ( Figure 4A ) and the read alignment was verified with Bracken and visualization of the output was accomplished with Krona ( Figure 4B ). Coronavirus 229E was also successful identified using Metrichor's WIMP application (S2). The coverage was calculated for both the H. influenzae and Coronavirus 229E with the formula C=LN/G, where C = coverage, L = average sequence read length, average All rights reserved.

Having the ability to sequence amplicons and whole genomes in a mobile, small-footprint platform is attractive when collecting and analyzing samples in the field, and these qualities are also desirable as sequencing methods move toward environmental and surveillance applications. These methods, data, and results represent a practical and novel application for utilizing MinION nanopore sequencing technology. The data in this study were generated with both R7.3 and 9.4 chemistry flow cells, which accurately identified a panel of URD organisms. As the MinION technology improves, sequencing will generally become cheaper, faster, and more accurate as demonstrated in this study with improvements in identity alignment in the >92% range (Tables 2 and 3 ) as compared to earlier experiments that were in the 30% range [38] .\n\nThe discrepancies observed between whole genome followed with RT-PCR and amplicon sequencing were minimal in regards to identity alignment (Tables 2 and 3 ). The base-calling analysis for the MinION nanopore sequencer is an area of active development, as well as flow cell configurations, protocols for kits, and associated kit chemistries. The best quality sequence data are termed 2D reads, while 1D reads are from the template strand. Although the accuracy of MinION sequence data is an area of active development, with recent development of a new nanopore for the flow cells, one should expect increased data quality with each increment in flow cell configuration. Data quality has improved and was demonstrated in this study with each improvement in kit chemistry and flow cell type. This study shows that the platform can be All rights reserved.

As sequencing yield, quality, and turnaround times continue to improve, it is anticipated that nanopore sequencing will challenge mainstays such as PCR for identification of unknown samples. Amplicon and rapid WGS was successfully utilized as an approach for pathogen detection. Low titer viral nasal wash samples were was positively identified after WGA even when samples had high human read counts due to a carry-over human NA contribution. Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, Parainfluenza 3 and adenovirus nasal wash samples had 81%, 90%, 95% and 81% of the read count aligning to human references genomes, respectively.\n\nA comparison of the nanopore and short-read sequencing data (Illumina MiSeq) showed that there was agreement in major taxonomic units identified. Therefore, the methodologies described in this study demonstrate that both whole genome and amplicon sequencing will be useful for rapid, accurate, and efficient detection of microbial and viral diversity in clinical samples. In this study, metagenomic sequencing of organisms in clinical samples were successful with increased sequencing depth when WGS was used over that of amplicon sequencing which is beneficial for studying viral genetic rearrangement. In addition, these data also support the utilization of amplicon sequencing over deep sequencing for field applications where surveillance is needed.\n\nThe rapid 1D kit, defined as a single strand library composed of template strand, was used to evaluate whole genome amplification (WTA or WGA) of viruses and bacterial species. The library preparation utilizes a transposase to fragment the DNA. Analysis in this study was limited in scope but demonstrates it is functionally a game changer when time is of importance in identifying pathogens in acute infections or during surveillance. This approach is especially beneficial when identification is difficult using conventional bacterial culture techniques and in All rights reserved.

Establishing a system for rapid microorganism identification via metagenomic sequencing seems pertinent, especially for field applications.\n\nAlthough long reads generated from the nanopore sequencer were found to have relatively higher error rates when compared with benchtop sequencing reads. MinION sequencing has been shown to have significant advantages, such as portability, low cost, and real-time detection.\n\nThese advantages suggest that it is a potential for identification of infectious microbiota community in situ. Nevertheless, both whole genome low titer sample such as nasal washes (e.g. WTA, WGA) and amplicon sequencing are more desirable over culturing and will provide a method for identification of organisms in clinical samples. Throughout this study, it has been demonstrated that a low number of long reads are sufficient for accurate identification of small genomes. Table 2 and 3). Targeted sequencing is useful even with higher error rates since gigabytes of data are collected for each run and the fragments are longer (range 800-3 kb) with overlapping sequences which can assist in mitigating error rates.\n\nAll rights reserved.
