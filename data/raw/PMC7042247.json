{"title": "Natural selection supports escape from concerted evolution of a recently duplicated CEACAM1 paralog in the ruminant CEA gene family", "body": "Gene families evolve by birth and death evolution1,2. Gene duplication provides new genetic material that can be used to test its benefit for the species without cost for changing the already existing gene3. The new gene may be beneficial by enhancing the gene dose or by acquiring a new function. If the enhancement of gene dosage is beneficial, the sequence of the duplicated gene has to be conserved after gene duplication. Homologous recombination and gene conversion are efficient mechanisms that favor sequence conservation of closely related sequences4. If sequence conservation leads to the situation, that paralogous genes are more closely related with each other than with genes of the same family in another species, even though the gene duplication preceded the speciation event, the genes are considered to evolve in a concerted way. In fact, concerted evolution is observed in many gene families, such as the CEA gene family5.\n\nThe CEA gene family, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is one of the most rapidly evolving gene families in humans6. It consists of several relatively conserved genes for which orthologous genes can be assigned even in more distantly related mammals7 and a group of genes, which we refer to as the \u201cCEACAM1 paralogs\u201d. CEACAM1 paralogs encode closely related extracellular IgC-like and ligand-binding IgV-like N-terminal immunoglobulin domains. Since these genes are usually more closely related within one species than with CEACAM1 paralogs of other mammalian species it is in most cases impossible to assign orthologous genes for them in more distantly related species8. In some species, the CEACAM1 paralogs are composed of two distinguished subgroups, the CEACAM and the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) genes9. The PSG are specifically expressed in the placenta and were predominantly identified in mammals which have hemochorial placentae8,10. The domain composition of PSGs may differ between different species but their function or at least certain functions seem to be conserved10,11. One reason for the homogenization of CEACAM1 paralog IgV-like domains (also called N domains) may be that the inhibitory receptor CEACAM1 is often used by various pathogens as a receptor to enter their host12\u201316 and other CEACAMs function as decoy receptors, either competing for pathogen binding or as activating/endocytic receptors on immune cells8,17,18.\n\nNevertheless, some CEACAMs seem to have successfully escaped from concerted evolution. These genes are called conserved CEACAMs and include CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM207. Gene conversion was not identifiable in human conserved independently evolving CEACAM genes5. Orthologs of these CEACAM genes can be found in all mammals with only a few exceptions19, indicating that their birth and separation from the CEACAM1 paralogs occurred far in the past, hiding mechanisms at work during separation. Thus, the mechanisms used to escape from concerted evolution remain elusive. However, these genes may be of particular interest since some have gained important functions. For example, CEACAM16 was found to play a pivotal role in hearing, as several mutations in CEACAM16 are associated with hearing impairment20\u201322.\n\nBy characterizing the entire CEA gene family in cattle, we identified a gene, which seems to be much younger than the already known conserved CEACAMs. We suggest that this gene, further referred to as CEACAM32 was most likely born in the most recent ancestor of ruminants. The gene is still located near the other bovine CEACAM1 paralogs in the same orientation. Nevertheless, while in phylogenetic analyses N domain exon sequences of CEACAM32 cluster together with CEACAM32 sequences from different ruminant species, other CEACAM1 paralogous sequences cluster together within different ruminant species. Thus, CEACAM32 may help to understand better, how members of a gene family can escape from concerted evolution.\n\nIn order to identify bovine CEACAMs we performed similarity searches using three different bovine genomic sequence databases (Bos taurus, Bos indicus and Bos grunniens) using Blast and Blat algorithms as described previously8. By comparing data from these genomes, we predicted the coding sequence (CDS) of eight CEACAM genes and two pseudo genes. We identified orthologous genes to human CEACAM1, CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19, CEACAM20 and three putatively functional CEACAM1 paralogs, CEACAM32, CEACAM33, and CEACAM35. The two putative pseudogenes have stop codons in multiple exons, indicating that they do not encode functional proteins. According to the current genome assembly in Ensembl (Cow (UMD3.1)) the chromosomal location of the CEA gene family is syntenic to the CEA gene family in other mammals located in the extended leucocyte receptor complex on chromosome 18 (Fig. 1A). CEACAM1 is the only member of the CEA gene family located between TGFB1 and LIPE. All CEACAM1 paralogs including one pseudogene are positioned in one cluster flanked by the CD79A and XRCC1 genes (Fig. 1B). The second pseudogene is a CEACAM18 paralog located next to the CEACAM18 gene within the SIGLEC cluster (Fig. 1B). The location of the orthologous genes CEACAM16, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 is similar as in other mammals7,8.\n\nThe orthologous CEACAM genes CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 have the same exon arrangement as previously described in other mammals8 (Fig. S1). In contrast, CEACAM1 in cattle does not contain a B domain exon (255 bp) commonly found in other mammalian CEACAM1 genes as previously described23. The CEACAM1 paralog CEACAM32 has a unique transmembrane domain which significantly differs from the transmembrane domains found in CEA gene family members with immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) or immune receptor tyrosine-based activation-like motifs (ITAM-like). CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 contain a transmembrane domain, which is very similar to that of human CEACAM3, CEACAM4, and CEACAM21. Human CEACAM3 and CEACAM4 have a cytoplasmic tail with an ITAM-like motif encoded by four exons. Similar exons could be identified in the CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 genes. CEACAM35 is the only CEACAM1 paralog which contains a B domain exon in cattle (Fig. S1). CEACAM34 described in a previous paper8 is no longer in the Whole-genome shotgun contigs (wgs) database at NCBI which is in accordance with our inability to amplify any fragment with CEACAM34-specific primers from cDNA of different tissues or genomic DNA from different cattle. These results suggest that CEACAM34 does not exist as a separate gene in the cattle genome or that the sequence information previously available was incomplete. A detailed depiction of the exon arrangement of all CEACAM genes is shown in Figs. 1C and S1A.\n\nFirst, we designed primers for the bovine housekeeping gene GAPDH. The primer pair was designed to amplify a specific fragment of GAPDH mRNA-derived cDNA and a fragment of genomic DNA from the GAPDH gene but not from a processed pseudogene. Both fragments differ in size and therefore could be used to detect and quantify genomic DNA contamination in the cDNA preparations (Table 1, Fig. 2A).\n\nNext, we designed CEACAM-specific primers (Table 1) complementary to individual leader exon and N domain exon sequences. Using these primers we screened the expression of bovine CEACAMs in different candidate tissues, including liver, lung, skin, kidney, rumen, small intestine, large intestine, spleen, udder, tonsils, lymph nodes, granulocytes and lymphocytes. CEACAM32 mRNA was detected in testis but not in any other tissue tested (Fig. 2B). Expression of CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 was detected in bovine granulocytes isolated from peripheral blood (Fig. 2C) and at low level in other tissues (data not shown).\n\nTo substantiate our prediction of the exon composition of the CEACAM32 gene we performed 3\u2032 RACE experiments starting from the N domain exon to identify the 3\u2032 end of CEACAM32 cDNA. Sequencing of the cDNA obtained by 3\u2032 RACE, revealed that the CEACAM32 mRNA encodes a unique transmembrane domain, which contains a stop codon and a poly A signal, resulting in a very short 3\u2032 untranslated region. Based on the 3\u2032 sequence of CEACAM32 cDNA we designed primers for the amplification of full length CEACAM32 cDNA which was then cloned and sequenced (Table 1). The CEACAM32 mRNA (GenBank accession no. MH684294) codes for a single isoform (Fig. 2D) composed of a leader sequence, an IgV-like domain (N domain), an IgC-like domain (A2 type domain), a transmembrane domain and an extremely short cytoplasmic domain consisting of four amino acids.\n\nAmplification and sequencing of the full length CEACAM33 cDNA indicated that four different splice isoforms exists (Fig. 2D). However, we could only confirm two of these isoforms by cDNA cloning. One CEACAM33 splice variant contains the ITAM-like motif (GenBank accession no. MH684295), while another isoform (GenBank accession no. MH684296) lacks the transmembrane domain indicating that it encodes a secreted protein (Fig. 2E).\n\nCEACAM35 (GenBank accession no. MH684297) exist as one isoform (Fig. 2D) composed of a leader exon, an N domain exon, one IgC-like domain (A1 type) exon, a transmembrane domain exon and four cytoplasmic domain exons. The four cytoplasmic domain exons code for a ITAM-like motif slightly different from the ones found in CEACAM33 cDNA. The B domain exon of the CEACAM35 gene identified as a putatively spliceable exon in the genome (Fig. 1C) was found to be not included in analyzed mRNAs. The putative proteins encoded by bovine CEACAM1 and its paralogous genes are depicted in Fig. 2E.\n\nWe compared the IgV-like (N domain) exon nucleotide sequences of all bovine CEACAMs (Fig. 3A). The CEACAM N domains of CEACAM1 paralogs cluster together with those of the CEACAM1a and b alleles while the N domain exon sequences of conserved CEACAMs are more distantly related. The N domain exon sequence of the inhibitory receptor CEACAM1 was most closely related to that of the activating receptor CEACAM33 followed by the second activating receptor CEACAM35. The N domain exon sequence of CEACAM32 showed the greatest difference to that of the N domain exon of CEACAM1 and of all CEACAM1 paralogs (Fig. 3A). We further determined the relationship of IgC-like domain exons of bovine CEACAMs (Fig. S3). CEACAM1 and CEACAM33 contain two IgC-like domains of the A1 and A2 type. CEACAM35 is composed of an A1 and a B domain. The IgC-like domains of CEACAM32 and the CEACAMps are of the A2 type (Figs. 1C; S3). Next, we analyzed the relationship of the transmembrane exon nucleotide sequences of bovine CEACAM1 paralogs with that of other species (Fig. 3B). As previously observed, two main forms of transmembrane domain exons can be discerned: one cluster is composed of TM domain exon sequences present in genes encoding ITIM motifs and the other containing the transmembrane domain exons associated with exons which encode a ITAM-like signaling motif. The transmembrane domain exon sequence of CEACAM32 is more closely related to the CEACAM1-related transmembrane domain exon sequence but is clearly separated from the CEACAM1 transmembrane exon cluster (Fig. 3B). When we compared all identified N domain exons of CEACAM32 with N domain exons from CEACAM1 and closely related CEACAM1 paralogs of selected mammalian species we found that all CEACAM32 N domain exons cluster together while N domain exons of CEACAM1 and other bovine CEACAM1 paralogs formed a separated cluster (Fig. 3C).\n\nWe used the composition of mobile elements within the different bovine CEACAM genes to analyze the phylogenetic history of bovine CEACAMs (Figs. S4, S5). CEACAM33 contains most of the elements at the same positions as in CEACAM35 indicating that CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 are the result of a duplication event. Interestingly further modifications of CEACAM33 seem to have taken place, since the B domain exon is replaced by an A2 domain exon, which is most closely related to the A2 domain exon of CEACAM1 and/or CEACAMps (Fig. S3). The mobile elements around the N domain exons (i.e. in introns 1 and 2) suggest a close relationship between CEACAM1 and CEACAM32. On the other hand, a similar origin of the transmembrane domain exon of these two genes is not supported by the surrounding mobile elements (Fig. S4). Based on the mobile elements found in the CEACAM1-related pseudogene it is closer related with the ITAM containing CEACAMs, CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 than with CEACAM1 and CEACAM32 (Fig. S4). Mobile elements of conserved CEACAMs indicate that the duplication of CEACAM18 was a rather recent event and that the other conserved CEACAMs evolved separately for quite a while (Fig. S5).\n\nThe loss of the B domain exon in bovine CEACAM1, the integration of different artiodactyl-specific mobile elements (Fig. 4), and the cooption of the transmembrane domain exon of CEACAM32 into the ruminant CEA gene family are additional genetic markers which allowed further analysis of the evolutionary history of the bovine CEA gene family. Previously we have speculated that B domain exon loss is due to the insertion of mobile elements23 (Fig. 4). However, when we analyzed CEACAM1 from other artiodactyls, i.e. pig (Sus scrofa), alpaca (Vicugna pacos), and the Wild Bactrian (Camelus ferus) and Arabian camel (Camelus dromedarus), two old world camelids, we also did not find B domain exons in the CEACAM1 genes (Fig. 5A; data not shown). Thus loss of the B domain of CEACAM1 occurred most likely in the common ancestor of all artiodactyls about 50\u201360 million years ago (mya). On the other hand, similar mobile elements as found in the A1-A2 intron of bovine CEACAM1 were detected in CEACAM1 of goats (Capra hircus), sheep (Ovis aries) and giraffe (Giraffa Camelopardalis tippelskirchi) but not in CEACAM1 of pigs and camelids (Fig. 5A). This suggests that the B domain exon loss occurred before mobile elements were integrated into the A1-A2 intron of the common ancestor of ruminant CEACAM1.\n\nFurthermore, in the data base CEACAM35 has a complete B domain exon while CEACAM33 contains only part of the B domain exon from the 5\u2032 region (Fig. 5B). This indicates that the duplication event which created CEACAM35 took place before the CEACAM1-like ancestor lost its B domain. CEACAM33 seems to be younger than CEACAM35 and may have been evolved by duplication of a CEACAM35 ancestor followed by further modifications.\n\nA close relative of the transmembrane domain exon of bovine CEACAM32 was found in bovidae, cervidae and in some giraffidae i.e. in okapi but not in giraffe and not in suidae and camelidae. This data suggests that the birth of CEACAM32 took place in the most recent ancestor of ruminants.\n\nTwo different CEACAM1 alleles exist in cattle, CEACAM1a (GenBank accession no. AY345127) and CEACAM1b (GenBank accession no. AY487416). The alleles differ mainly in their N exon sequences by a number of non-synonymous mutations and most remarkably by an in frame 9-nucleotide deletion in the CEACAM1a allele. Interestingly, the CEACAM1a allele was found in the wgs database for Bos taurus and Bos indicus but not for Bos grunniens, Bison bison, and Bubalus bubalis. In contrast, the CEACAM1b allele was found in the database of all five bovine species. Taken together, this indicates that the CEACAM1b allele is the original bovine CEACAM1 allele and that the CEACAM1a allele appeared first in the ancestor of domestic cattle 0.2\u20131 mya4 ago.\n\nThe phylogenetic analysis of the N domains of bovine CEACAM1 paralogs indicates that the N domains of CEACAM1, CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 exhibit concerted evolution while the N domain of CEACAM32 evolved independently. To better understand the mechanism that allows the independent evolution of CEACAM32 we analyzed recombination and gene conversion events that may have taken place between bovine CEACAM1 paralogs. First, we searched the protein-coding region of bovine CEACAM1 paralogs using GARD. Three breakpoints were identified one was in the leader sequence one in the N domain and one in the A1 domain exon. When we compared the sequences between these breakpoints, we observed that CEACAM32 differs from CEACAM1, CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 in particular in the N and in the first IgC-like domain exons (Fig. 6A). Next, we used the PipMaker software to compare the whole sequences of the CEACAM1 paralogous genes. As shown in Fig. 6B\nCEACAM32 and CEACAM1 N exon sequences differ strongly. However, high similarity between CEACAM1 and CEACAM32 was found in the intron sequences particular around the N domain exon (Fig. 6B upper panel). In contrast, sequence similarities between CEACAM1 and CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 were most pronounced in the exon sequences (Fig. 6C middle and lower panels). Finally, we used GENCONV to detect putative gene conversion events between CEACAM1, CEACAM32, CEACAM33, CEACAM35 and CEACAMps1. 23 gene conversion events were detected by GENECONV in the region starting at the leader exon and ending after ~1000 nucleotides of the intron following the N domain exon (Fig. 7 and Table 2)). Gene conversion events were detected for all CEACAM1 paralogs at the N domain exon except for CEACAM32 (Fig. 7). Remarkably, gene conversion between CEACAM32 and other CEACAM1 paralogs were detected, but they were restricted to the leader exon and the intron sequence following the N domain exon (Fig. 7). We used only the region of the CEACAM1 paralogs for the analysis of gene conversion where the sequence similarity was high enough to guarantee a high quality alignment. All gene conversion events located around the N domain exon have a high statistical support Table 2. These results demonstrate that CEACAM32 is still involved in gene conversion and, therefore, in concerted evolution of CEACAM1 paralogs, however, since gene conversion only affects noncoding regions and the leader exon of CEACAM32, the mature CEACAM32 protein has escaped concerted evolution.\n\nOne mechanism that may avoid concerted evolution of coding sequences of the ligand-binding N-domain is natural selection as changes in intronic regions are in general better tolerated than changes in exonic regions. We used the SNAP program to calculate the ratio of the rate of synonymous nucleotide substitutions per synonymous site and nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (dN/dS) within the N domain exons, coding for the mature (excluding leader sequences) N domain of CEACAM32 in different species. We used sequences from 14 different ruminant species and calculated dN/dS for all pairwise combinations which resulted in a dN/dS value of 0.65 (ranging from 0.106 Bos taurus vs. Bubalus bubalis to 2.73 Capra aegagrus vs. Ammotragus lervia) which indicates on average purifying i.e. negative selection (dN/dS <1) but positive selection may occur in certain linages. In addition, we found a stretch of codons between positions 36 and 52 where enhanced accumulation of nonsynonymous substitutions was observed (Fig. 8A). In addition, the MEME application was used to analyze the sequence alignment of CEACAM32 sequences to search for episodic positive selection. Only one codon (codon 27) was found to be under episodic positive selection i.e. selection for diversification at a significance level of 0.1 (Fig. 8B). Additional sites were identified, which were indicated to be under positive selection by the LRT (p-value > 0.1), four of them (sites 39, 40, 41, 42) are located in the region between position 36 to 52 (Fig. 8B). Modeling the structure of the CEACAM32 N domain revealed that most the codons putatively selected for diversification are placed in or near to the CFG face (Fig. 8C). The CFG face is known to be the major ligand interaction area of CEACAM N domains. Together these data suggest that natural selection has favored differentiation of the putative ligand-binding face of CEACAM32 from other bovine CEACAMs.\n\nIn the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the bovine CEA gene family and tried to reconstruct its evolutionary history. In contrast to the equine CEA gene family where we could not identify two of the conserved CEACAMs e.g. CEACAM18 and CEACAM2011,19, in cattle all conserved CEACAMs i.e. CEACAM1, CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 could be identified in the NCBI genome database. Interestingly we also identified a CEACAM18 paralog in cattle, however this paralog is most likely a pseudogene, since several stop codons were found in the coding sequence. Thus, the gene duplication of CEACAM18 had let to pseudogenization of one paralog, putatively due to an unfavorable consequence of the enhanced gene dosage and/or the lack of a novel function upon gene duplication2. In cattle, CEACAM1 paralogs have not undergone a substantial expansion as seen in other species8,24,25. Only four CEACAM1 paralogs were detected and one of them seems to be a pseudogene. Two of the expressible paralogs contain an ITAM-like signaling motif in their cytoplasmic tails. Thus, they may form paired receptors with CEACAM1 as described before in other species17,26\u201328. These paired receptors are thought to be a counter measure to the use of CEACAM1 as cellular receptors by various bacterial pathogens8,17,27. Interestingly, CEACAM1 paralogs with ITAM-like signaling motifs in cattle show a preferential expression in granulocytes, as does human CEACAM3, which was found to be an innate pathogen receptor, which mediates uptake and destruction of bacterial pathogens17,27. This is in contrast to the finding in dogs were CEACAMs with ITAM-like signaling motifs were more broadly expressed26. Thus, bovine CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 may also be innate immune receptors for yet unknown pathogens.\n\nWhy do two different ITAM-bearing bovine CEACAMs exist? The maintenance of two ITAM-bearing CEACAMs with a very similar expression pattern may imply that two different pathogens exist that use CEACAM1 as a receptor or that both activating CEACAMs bind to different epitopes of the same pathogen. In addition, the presence of two activating CEACAMs may allow the development of more than one inhibitory receptor without losing the \u201cprotection\u201d by the activating receptor8,17,27. Indeed, we had previously identified two different CEACAM1 alleles in cattle. We assumed that this is due to usurpation of bovine CEACAM1 by a virus as its cellular receptor. However, such a virus has not yet been identified23,29. Here we show, that the CEACAM1a and CEACAM1b alleles are found in certain Bos taurus and Bos indicus breeds, but CEACAM1a is absent from the genomes of Bos grunniens, Bison bison, and Bubalus bubalis. This finding strongly indicates that the three amino acid deletion in the CEACAM1a allele occurred in the common ancestor of Bos taurus and Bos indicus after separation from the ancestor of Bos grunniens and Bison bison about 150\u2013400 kya30. At that time, both ITAM-containing CEACAMs already existed, since their descendants could be found in the genome of both Bos grunniens and Bison bison. Thus it may be speculated that the presence of two ITAM-bearing receptors with different ligand-binding domains favor the evolution of distinct CEACAM1 alleles.\n\nFrom an evolutionary point of view, it is remarkable that CEACAM35 is the only CEACAM1 paralog in cattle which contains a functional B domain exon. Since the B domain exon of CEACAM1 is replaced by a LINE/L1_Art and a CHR1 family SINE interspersed repeat element, duplication of CEACAM1 leading to CEACAM35 may have occurred before this event. Thus, CEACAM1 and CEACAM35 seem to be the original paired receptors of the CEA gene family in artiodactyls. In contrast, CEACAM33 does not have a B domain exon indicating, that CEACAM33 either evolved by duplication of CEACAM1 after the loss of the B domain exon or by duplication of CEACAM35 followed by an independent loss of the B domain exon. The later possibility is supported since CEACAM33 contains a region that exhibits sequence similarity to the sequence comprising the end of the intron between the A1 and B domain exon and the first part of the B domain exon of CEACAM35. In addition, the presence of similar mobile elements in CEACAM35 and CEACAM33 suggests that the CEACAM35 ancestor gave rise to CEACAM33. However, the presence of an A2 domain in CEACAM33 implies the presence of an A2 exon in the CEACAM35 ancestor or requires further modifications of an A2 exon-less CEACAM33 ancestor after gene duplication possibly by recombination or gene conversion.\n\nThere is one member of the bovine CEA gene family which is of particular interest since it has a unique transmembrane domain which was not found previously in other species. Further searches in the NCBI database suggest that CEACAM32 is specific for ruminants. Thus CEACAM32 is an example of a new CEACAM born in the most recent ancestor of all ruminants about 35\u201350 mya31. Although the origin of the transmembrane domain of CEACAM32 is unknown, the novelty of this domain within the CEA gene family indicates that CEACAM32 is the result of a gene duplication and/or exon shuffling event together with the cooption of a novel transmembrane exon. This novel gene encoding a transmembrane anchored cell surface glycoprotein has gained a unique expression pattern within the bovine CEA gene family. An exclusive expression in testis was previously also observed for CEACAM17, which is a muroid-specific CEACAM7. Taken into consideration that CEACAMs could interact with a variety of ligands we speculate that the expression in testis provides a new very specific environment for these testis-specific CEACAMs with a unique repertoire of putative ligands that may favor adaptation of the putative ligand binding domain of CEACAM to bind to a testis-specific ligand. Indeed, the relaxed or even positive selection at the CFG face fits well to the view that the ligand binding face did undergo affinity maturation to this putative new ligand or that adaptation to species-specific ligands took place. Nevertheless, we want to point out that it is well known that transcription is very permissive in testis and, therefore, duplicated genes are often transcribed in this organ32,33. Thus, further analysis of the role of CEACAM32 is needed to support the view that CEACAM32 plays a role in testis.\n\nComparison of the N domains of bovine CEACAM1 paralogs showed that CEACAM1 and the two ITAM-like signaling motif containing CEACAMs (CEACAM33 and CEACAM35) underwent concerted evolution. A similar finding was recently reported for human CEACAM1 paralogs5. Furthermore, concerted evolution of the protein coding sequence of CEACAM1, CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 seems to be due to gene conversion events that affect the exon sequences and only to a minor extend the intron sequences. In contrast gene conversion events of CEACAM32 affecting non-protein coding intron sequences are preferentially maintained during evolution. This indicates that natural selection favors maintenance of the protein sequence of the extracellular part of CEACAM1 and the ITAM-containing CEACAMs while it prevents homogenization of the extracellular part of CEACAM32 and CEACAM1. Gene conversion is supported by both small distance of genes and sequence similarity. Thus, gene conversion at certain places of the intron sequence between CEACAM1 and CEACAM32 may be preferred compared to CEACAM33, CEACAM35 or CEACAMps1. On the other hand, we have noted inversions of the non-CEACAM gene locus present between CEACAM1 and members with ITAM-like motif-encoding exons in cattle and mouse when compared with the human CEACAM gene locus8. This intrachromosomal inversion can be explained by a recombination event between e.g. CEACAM1 and a ITAM-like motif-encoding CEACAM1-like gene with an transcriptionally inverse orientation (which indeed all CEACAM1-like genes exhibit; see Fig. 1B) possibly using a lopping-out mechanism comprising the non-CEACAM gene region. This mechanism could engage even genes with large physical distances, suggesting that the different distance between CEACAM1 and the individual CEACAM1 paralog is probably of minor importance for the frequency of gene conversion events.\n\nIt is of particular importance that concerted evolution within bovine CEACAM1 paralogs is only relevant for the extracellular, ligand-binding part. Due to the contrary signaling capacity of bovine CEACAM1 and its paralogs, functional diversification of the duplicated genes already had taken place1. Thus their transmembrane and cytoplasmic parts are not under concerted evolution due to prominent nucleotide sequence differences. We hypothesize that the ligand-binding domain of inhibitory CEACAM1 and activating CEACAMs evolve in a concerted way in order to maintain the counter measure function of activating CEACAMs against the use of the inhibitory CEACAMs by pathogens. Since the evolution of these CEACAMs is most likely driven by pathogens which evolve very rapidly the ligand binding domains also evolve rather fast. To keep the ligand (probably pathogen adhesins) binding domains similar, these paired receptors evolve by concerted evolution mediated by gene conversion and homologous recombination. On the other hand, duplicated genes that have gained a novel expression pattern face a novel environment and may interact with novel putative ligands. Once they interact to a certain extend with these ligands further optimization by natural selection may exclude concerted evolution with the original parental gene34. According to the Red-Queen-Hypothesis35 this means not moving in concert with its paralogs means separation from them without prominent selection for diversification, as it was observed in the current investigation for CEACAM32.\n\nTaking together analysis of the CEA gene family of cattle and other artiodactyls, provided evidence, that members of the CEA gene family can escape from concerted evolution by excluding protein coding regions of the gene from gene conversion most likely through natural selection. Thus, conserved CEA gene family members are expected to have ligands distinct from their founder gene CEACAM1 ligands.\n\nSequence similarity searches were performed using the NCBI BLAST tools blastn http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi and Ensembl BLAST/BLAT search programs http://www.ensembl.org/Multi/Tools/Blast?db=core using default parameters. For identification of bovine CEACAM exons, exon and cDNA sequences from known CEACAM and PSG genes were used to search whole-genome shotgun contigs (wgs) databases limited to organisms Bovidae. Hits were considered to be significant if the E-value was <e-10 and the query cover was >50%. Once a wgs contig was identified that contained CEACAM-related sequences we confirmed manually the presence of the complete exon by the number of nucleotides and identification of CEACAM-typical splice site sequences. Only sequences which were considered to be complete exons were used for further analyses. In a second step we used the identified exon sequences to search the database again in order to identify all existing paralogous CEACAM genes. Once we had identified individual exons we predicted the gene structure based on the organization of known CEACAM genes. The location of different exons on the same contig was a prerequisite for considering that these exons belong to the same gene. Gene predictions were further supported by the identification of expressed sequence tags (est) and/or predictions in genome builds at NCBI and Ensemble, if available. Short exons, like exons coding for cytoplasmic tails, were identified by alignments of downstream sequences of identified transmembrane exons with cytoplasmic exon sequences of human CEACAMs. Sequence alignments for exon identification were performed using clustalw (http://www.genome.jp/tools/clustalw/). For the identification of CEACAMs from other artiodactyls the following wgs data sets were used: Bos taurus DAAA02 (Genome Coverage (GC): 9\u00d7; Sequencing Technology (ST): Sanger); Bos indicus PRDE01 (GC: 100\u00d7; ST: 454; IonTorrent; Illumina NextSeq; Illumina MiSeq), AGFL01 (GC: 52\u00d7; ST: SOLiD); Bos mututs AGSK01 (GC: 130\u00d7; ST: Illumina HiSeq; Illumina GA); Bison bison bison JPYT01 (GC: 60\u00d7; ST: 454; Illumina HiSeq); Bubalus bubalis AWWX01 (GC: 70\u00d7; ST: Illumina GAIIx; Illumina HiSeq; 454); Giraffa tippelskirchi LVKQ01 (GC: 37\u00d7; ST: Illumina HiSeq); Okapia johnstoni LVCL01 (GC: 30\u00d7; ST: Illumina HiSeq); Sus scrofa LUXX01 (95.5\u00d7; ST: Illumina HiSeq); Camelus ferus AGVR01 (GC: 30\u00d7; ST: Illumina GAIIx; 454 GS-FLX Titanium; SOLid 3); Camelus dromedaries JWIN01 (GC: 65\u00d7; ST: Illumina HiSeq); Vicugna pacos ABRR02 (GC: 22\u00d7; ST: Roche 454; ABI 3730); Capra aegagrus CBYH01; Capra hircus AJPT02 (GC: 175\u00d7; ST: Illumina); Ammotragus lervia NIVO01 (GC: 124\u00d7; ST: Illumina); Ovis aries AMGL02 (GC: 166\u00d7; ST: Illumina GAII; 454; PacBio RSII); Ovis aries musimon CBYI01 (GC: not available; ST: not available); Pantholops hodgsonii AGTT01 (GC: 67\u00d7; ST: Illumina); Odocoileus virginianus texanus MLBE01 (GC: 150\u00d7; ST: Illumina); Capreolus capreolus CCMK01 (GC: not available; ST: not available); Elaphurus davidianus JRFZ01 (GC: 114\u00d7; ST: Illumina HiSeq 2000). The CEA gene family in cattle is not well annotated; therefore, we adopted the nomenclature according to the one previously used for the CEA gene family of other mammals i.e. bovine CEACAM1 paralogs were numbered CEACAM32-CEACAM35 following the canine CEACAM numbers8. Gene names and corresponding sequences are summarized in (Additional File 1). The following databases were used for gene loci analyses: UMD3.1 assembly and Btau_5.0.1.\n\nBovine peripheral blood lymphocytes and granulocytes were isolated from blood of healthy cattle by centrifugation through a Ficoll-Paque gradient 1.077 g/l (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK). Lymphocytes were taken from the interphase of the gradient and separated from monocytes by plastic adherence for one hour. Granulocytes were collected from the top of the red blood cell (RBC) pellet and further purified by RBC lysis with ammonium chloride. Different bovine tissue samples were collected from freshly slaughtered healthy cattle and stored in the RNA stabilization reagent RNAlater\u00ae (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, US) at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h or at \u221280 \u00b0C for long term storage.\n\nTotal RNA was isolated with the RNeasy\u00ae Mini Kit (Qiagen, Langen, Germany) or using the TRIzol\u00ae reagent (Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany). One \u00b5g of total RNA was used for cDNA syntheses by reverse transcription (RT) using the Reverse Transcription System\u00ae (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). The RT product was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with DreamTaq polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA) and gene-specific primers (Metabion, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany) using standard conditions. Primers used are summarized in Table 1. Eight \u00b5l of each PCR were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.8% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.\n\nPrimers used for amplification of full length cDNAs are shown in Table 1. For cDNA cloning the RT product was amplified by PCR with Easy-A High-Fidelity PCR Cloning Enzyme (Agilent) and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Specific bands were extracted from the agarose gel using QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The PCR products were cloned using the StrataClone PCR Cloning Kit (Agilent). Plasmid DNA isolated from various clones were analyzed by PCR and sequencing. Nucleotide sequencing was performed with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany).\n\nFor the amplification of the 3\u2032 end of CEACAM32 mRNA we used the 3\u00b4 RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends from Invitrogen according to the standard protocol. The amplicons were isolated from an agarose gel using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit from Qiagen and sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (PE Applied Biosystems). This sequence was used to design specific primers to amplify full-length CEACAM32 cDNA. The sequences of the PCR products were determined by direct nucleotide sequencing.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses based on nucleotide and amino acid sequences were conducted using MEGA6 or MEGA736,37. Sequence alignments were performed using Muscle implemented in MEGA7. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood (ML) method with bootstrap testing (500 replicates) and the Tamura-Nei substitution model. For comparing sequences by the diagonal plot method we used Dotlet (https://myhits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/dotlet)38. The program PipMaker (http://bio.cse.psu.edu/) was used to identify conserved contiguous stretches of nucleotides between gene pairs and to calculate the degree of identity which is summarized as a \u2018percent identity plot\u201939. For identification of mobile DNA elements we used RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org/). Recombination between bovine CEACAM1 and its paralogs was detected using the genetic algorithm for recombination detection (GARD) software40. Gene conversion was analyzed using the GENECONV program (version 1.81a)41. In order to determine the selective pressure on the maintenance of the nucleotide sequences, the number of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution per nonsynonymous site (dN) and the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) were determined for N domain exons. The dN/dS ratios as well as the cumulative synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions along coding regions of N domain exons from orthologous genes were calculated after manual editing of sequence gaps or insertions guided by the amino acid sequences applying the SNAP program (Synonymous Nonsynonymous Analysis Program; http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/SNAP/SNAP.html), which uses the modified Nei-Gojobori model with Jukes-Cantor correction. We verified the results using the JCoDa software (http://www.tcnj.edu/nayaklab/jcoda). For the detection of individual sites under positive selection we used the mixed effects model of evolution software (MEME)42. 3D modeling was performed with geno3D-release 2 homology modeling software43 and visualized by the PyMOL software (Schr\u00f6dinger Inc., New York, US). The N domain of CEACAM32 was modeled using pdb2qsqA-0 and pdp116zA-0 as templates.\n\nHealthy cattle were slaughtered for meat production at the abattoir \u201cLandWert Hof Sundhagen\u201d, not as part of this study, however we got permission from the abattoir to use the tissues for the present study. Further tissue collection was approved by the animal use committee of local authorities (Landesamt f\u00fcr Landwirtschaft, Lebensmittelsicherheit und Fischerei (LALLF) Rostock, Germany; 7221.3-2.1-011/13). All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations."}
