{"title": "", "body": "In the USA, an estimated 21-37 million episodes of diarrhea occur annually in children younger than 5 years of age. 1 Some 10% of these children are seen by a physician, more than 200 000 are hospitalized and between 300 and 400 die from the illness. Worldwide, the number of childhood deaths from diarrhea is higher than 4 million per year.\n\nKnowledge of diarrheal disease has increased remarkably during the past few decades. 2 Numerous bacterial pathogens and an increasing number of viral pathogens have been demonstrated to cause diarrhea. This increased understanding of pathogenic mechanisms has led to improvements in therapy. This chapter discusses the major viral and bacterial agents of infectious diarrhea, including their epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and therapy.\n\nDiarrheal disease caused by viral agents occurs far more frequently than does similar disease of bacterial origin. In fact, viral gastroenteritis is the second most common illness in the USA, after the common cold. 3 Despite the frequent occurrence of viral enteritides, the identification of a specific virus as causative agent is a relatively recent development. 4 Rotavirus and a number of other small round structured viruses have been identified as a major cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis in children and adults. This discussion focuses on these established pathogens, and then continues with a brief summary of several newer viral enteropathogens and the current status of several candidate pathogens.\n\nRotavirus was first identified as a specific viral pathogen in duodenal cells of children with diarrhea by Bishop and associates in 1973. 5 Subsequent studies indicated that rotavirus is responsible not only for more cases of diarrheal disease in infants and children than any other single cause, but also for a significant portion of deaths caused by diarrhea in both developed and developing countries throughout the world. 6 Rotavirus is responsible for 20-70% of hospitalizations for diarrhea among children worldwide. 7\n\nThe genus Rotavirus is classified as a member of the family Reoviridae of the RNA viruses. Rotaviruses are round parti-cles 68 nm in diameter and are composed of two separate shells (capsids). The capsids surround a 38-nm icosahedral core structure, which in turn encloses the 11 double strands of RNA in the core. This structure gives the virus its characteristic appearance of a wide-rimmed wheel with spokes radiating from the hub, from which its name was derived (rota is Latin for 'wheel'). 8 Rotaviruses are classified based on antigenic properties of various proteins found in the capsid stricture. The VP6 protein on the inner capsid of the virus determines the rotavirus group. 4 Most viruses infecting humans are classified as group A, although rotaviruses from groups B and C have occasionally been associated with human diarrheal disease as well. The next level of classification is the subgroup, which is determined by other antigenic differences among the VP6 proteins. At least two subgroups are known to exist. 4 Subgroup typing has proved important in the study of patients who experience more than one episode of rotaviral infection. In these patients, recurrent infections usually but not necessarily involve agents of different subgroups, which suggests that subgroup antigens are not sufficient for inducing the production of protective antibodies. 9 Finally, the rotaviruses are classified into a variety of serotypes based on the antigenic differences of VP7 glycoprotein or the VP4 protease-sensitive hemagglutinin proteins that are found in the outer capsid. 10 VP7-based serotypes are now referred to as G types (for glycoprotein in VP7); G types 1 through 4 are responsible for most infections in children. VP4 serotypes are called P types (representing protease sensitivity of VP4). Reassortments of VP7 and VP4 have been used in candidate rotavirus vaccines.\n\nRotavirus infection appears to occur throughout the world. In temperate climates, a sharp increase in incidence of cases occurs during the winter months. 6 In the USA, the peak rotavirus season begins in November in the Southwest and ends in the Northeast in April. 6 In the tropics, year-round transmission occurs, with seasonal variation in some areas. 11 Transmission is primarily from person to person, through contact with feces or contaminated fomites. Spread by water is likely. Respiratory transmission has been suggested but not proved. 12 Although the virus may affect all age groups, it most commonly produces disease in children between 6 and 24 months of age. Most children have developed rotavirus antibodies by the age of 2 years, which helps to explain the observed decreased incidence of rotaviral infection in later childhood. 13 The disease does occur in the adult\n\nRichard J. Noel and Mitchell B. Cohen population, however, and has even been known to produce epidemics. 14, 15 Rotavirus infection occurs in adult populations with approximately half the frequency seen in children. 16 In one study, those adults whose children had rotavirus were more likely to be infected than were adults without infected children. Most adults found to have rotavirus infection were asymptomatic; if symptoms were present, they were generally mild. This would seem to indicate that the antibody acquired earlier in life provides protective benefit.\n\nThe other age group that appears to have relative protection from rotavirus infection is the neonate. The virus can be found in stool samples from asymptomatic neonates. Neonatal epidemics of rotavirus excretion have been described in which approximately half of the nursery patients examined were found to have rotavirus. Many of these infants were asymptomatic and those with disease had only mild symptoms. 17, 18 Breast-fed infants are less likely to be infected and, when infected, these infants are apparently less likely than their bottle-fed counterparts to suffer symptoms of disease. This may reflect the protective effect of maternal antibodies in colostrum and breast milk. 19 Nosocomial spread of rotaviral illness among hospitalized infants has also been documented. 20 \n\nOnce a susceptible patient has come in contact with rotavirus, a 48-to 72-h incubation period occurs before the onset of symptoms. 12 Illness typically begins with the sudden onset of diarrhea and vomiting. The diarrhea is usually watery and rarely may be associated with gross or occult blood in the stool. 21 The fluid loss from diarrhea and vomiting is often severe enough to cause dehydration. Fever is present in most patients. 12 Diarrhea caused by rotavirus usually lasts from 2 to 8 days. 22 Shedding of virus into the intestinal lumen begins about 3 days after infection and may persist for as long as 3 weeks. 23, 24 A comparison of the characteristics of rotaviral infections with those of other enteric viruses is presented in Table 36 .1.\n\nIn addition to gastrointestinal symptoms, patients with rotavirus often have respiratory tract symptoms. 12 Of 150 patients hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis and rotavirus infection, 26% had rhinitis, 8% had abnormal breath sounds, 49% had pharyngeal erythema and 18% had palpable cervical adenopathy. 25 In addition, 19% had signs of otitis media. Unlike fever and vomiting, none of these manifestations associated with rotavirus infection were helpful in the recognition of rotaviral disease, because the group infected with non-rotavirus organisms had sim-ilar signs and symptoms. The clinical symptoms of rotavirus infection are more severe in patients with underlying malnutrition. In the malnourished murine rotavirus model, a smaller inoculum is required for infection, less time is required for incubation and the symptoms are more severe. 26 In addition, rotavirus replication can occur in the liver and kidney, at least in immunocompromised hosts. 27 \n\nRotavirus invades the villus intestinal epithelial cells and replicates, causing cell death and sloughing. Histologically, this is manifest as blunting of the intestinal villi. 28 In response to the loss of villus cells, there is crypt hypertrophy. The lytic infection of highly differentiated absorptive enterocytes and the sparing of undifferentiated crypt cells results in both a loss of absorptive capacity with 'unopposed' crypt cell secretion (secretory diarrhea) and loss of brush border hydrolase activity (osmotic diarrhea).\n\nAnother possible mechanism for rotaviral diarrhea also has been demonstrated. The rotavirus non-structural glycoprotein NSP4 has been shown to mediate age-dependent intestinal secretion in mice. 29 The relevance of this novel viral enterotoxin to human rotaviral infection is uncertain. Other models, including vasoactive inflammatory agents, have also been proposed; consistent with this, in rotavirus infection there may be an increase in the number of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria. Disease effects are apparently limited to the duodenum and the proximal jejunum, 12 since studies in patients with known rotavirus disease have yielded normal gastric and rectal biopsies. 30\n\nRotavirus was initially linked to acute gastroenteritis through electron microscopic evidence of viral particles in biopsy specimens of affected patients. 5 This technique continues to be useful in rotavirus detection, especially in conjunction with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies (immunoelectron microscopy). 22 The obvious drawback of this approach is the need for specialized personnel and equipment. Consequently, a variety of immunoassays have been developed for detecting group A rotavirus antigen in stool; 30,31 most immunoassays have sensitivities and specificities in the range of 90%.\n\nCurrently, supportive care with oral or intravenous rehydration is the mainstay of therapy. 32, 33 Although novel antisecretory therapies have been reported 34, 35 no antiviral agents effective against rotavirus have yet been developed.\n\nHowever, probiotic therapy has been shown to be effective in preventing and treating rotaviral infection. Treatment with Lactobacillus GG has been shown to shorten the course of rotaviral diarrhea by at least 1 day. [36] [37] [38] In addition, other probiotic agents (Bifidobacterium bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus) have been shown to prevent diarrheal disease and shedding of rotavirus in a chronic hospital setting when given to formula-fed infants. 39 Oral administration of immunoglobulin has been shown to promote faster recovery from rotaviral infection 40 ; this therapy may be reserved for severely affected hospitalized infants.\n\nIn infants, natural rotavirus infection confers protection against subsequent infection. This protection increases with each new infection and reduces the severity of diarrhea. 41 The strategy for developing effective oral rotavirus vaccine involves the use of live, attenuated strains that should protect an infant by the same mechanism as natural infection. The most extensively studied strategy for rotavirus vaccination has been the Jennerian approach, which uses an antigenically related rotavirus strain from an animal host as the immunogen to induce protection. Attenuated bovine strains were initially tried; 42 these were protective in some populations but not others. This variability was in part attributed to the antigenic differences in circulating strains and the failure of animal strains to elicit heterotypic protection in some studies. To increase the efficacy of the Jennerian approach, second-generation polyvalent reassortment vaccines have been developed. These contain neutralization antigens that can provide homotypic (serotype-specific) immunity against the four epidemiologically important group A rotavirus VP7 serotypes. These vaccines, which are based on attenuated human and rhesus strains, are not highly effective at preventing infection but do have an efficacy of more than 80% in preventing dehydration associated with severe diarrhea. [43] [44] [45] A rotavirus vaccine (Rotashield, Wyeth-Ayerst, St. David's, PA) was approved for use in the USA and was placed on the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommended vaccination schedule. While the vaccine was efficacious, an increased incidence of intussusception within 2 weeks of receiving the vaccine was identified by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), leading to voluntary withdrawal by the manufacturer. 46 While no alternate vaccines are licensed in the USA at this time, several are in clinical trials and have been licensed in other countries. 47\n\nCaliciviruses 'Winter vomiting disease' was thought to be caused by nonbacterial gastroenteritis for decades before an etiologic agent was identified from an outbreak, in 1968, in Norwalk, Ohio. 48 In this outbreak, only some of the patients had diarrhea; the predominant clinical manifestation was vomiting and nausea. 48 Virus particles were visualized by immune electron microscopy on fecal material derived from the Norwalk outbreak. 4 This represented the first definitive association between a specific virus (Norwalk virus) and acute gastroenteritis. Subsequently, a number of similar etiologic agents were identified; before the cloning of the prototype Norwalk virus genome, 49, 50 these viruses, which were a group of morphologically diverse, positive-stranded RNA viruses that caused acute gastroenteritis, were identified as Norwalk-like agents. These organisms were also named for the communities in which they were first isolated (e.g. Montgomery County, Hawaii, Snow Mountain, Taunton, Otofuke and Sapporo viruses). Based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the sequence structure of these viruses has enabled their classification as human calciviruses (HuCV).\n\nWith the use of molecular tools, HuCV have now been preliminarily classified into four genotypes, represented by Norwalk virus, Snow Mountain agent, Sapporo virus and hepatitis E virus. [51] [52] [53] Recently the nomenclature of two genotypes has changed, renaming Norwalk virus as norovirus and Sapporo virus as sapovirus. 54 This HuCV classification system may allow the development of assays based on recombinant HuCV antigens or PCR products rather than the current cumbersome classification schemes that rely on human reagents (convalescent outbreak sera) of varying sensitivity and specificity. Molecular tools have already allowed the identification of HuCV as agents of both pediatric and adult viral gastroenteritis in food-borne outbreaks as well as outbreaks in nursing homes, hospitals and a university setting. Despite the potential for future understanding of the contribution of individual HuCV to outbreaks of nonbacterial gastroenteritis, Norwalk virus still remains the prototypic agent of HuCV and it is described in greater detail in the following section.\n\nEpidemiology Although norovirus has been most extensively studied in the USA, it is apparently worldwide in distribution. 55 Of patients exposed to norovirus either naturally or experimentally, 50% develop clinical symptoms. 56 Studies evaluating the prevalence of antinorovirus antibody among populations of various age groups initially demonstrated that the group from 3 months to 12 years of age had only a 5% antibody-positive rate. More recent epidemiologic studies, using baculovirusexpressed recombinant norovirus antigen in an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), have demonstrated a serologic response in 49% of Finnish infants between 3 and 24 months of age. 57 These data contradict previous beliefs that norovirus most often caused disease in older children and adults.\n\nTransmission of norovirus is most often fecal-oral. Unlike rotavirus, this usually involves the spread of infection to a large population through a common source rather than from direct, person-to-person contact. 58 In one outbreak, an infected bakery employee transmitted the virus through food products to approximately 3000 people. 59 Outbreaks have also been related to ingestion of raw oysters and clams 60 and to contaminated water supplies. Spread of this disease has been documented in closed-in populations such as those in long-term care facilities and cruise ships. 61 In addition to its fecal-oral spread, there is Viral gastroenteritis 559 some evidence that the norovirus is transmitted through a respiratory route in the form of aerosolized particles from vomitus. 62 Although previously referred to as 'winter vomiting disease', 48 norovirus produces outbreaks of disease that can occur throughout the year.\n\nPathophysiology The histologic changes induced by the norovirus in an infected host have been studied in small bowel biopsies from infected volunteers. 63 Those volunteers who remained free of clinical symptoms had normal biopsy specimens, whereas those with symptoms exhibited marked, but not specific, changes, including focal areas of villous flattening and disorganization of epithelial cells. On electron microscopy, microvilli were shortened and there was dilatation of the endoplasmic reticulum. These volunteers had repeat biopsies 2 weeks after the illness and normal histology was again present. Other investigators have demonstrated the presence of normal gastric and rectal histology in patients affected by norovirus as is typical of viral gastroenteritis. 55 \n\nThe clinical manifestations of disease produced by the norovirus include nausea, vomiting and cramping abdominal pain (Table 36 .1). Diarrhea is said to be a less consistent feature of this illness. In the original outbreak, only 44% of patients experienced diarrhea, whereas 84% had vomiting. 48 Other studies, however, have found that diarrhea occurs in most children and experimentally infected adult volunteers who become ill from this virus. 56, 64, 65 Fever occurs in approximately one-third of affected patients, but respiratory symptoms are not typically a part of this illness. An incubation period of approximately 24-48 h has been noted before the onset of symptoms, 48, 56 and symptoms persist for 12-48 h.\n\nDevelopment of techniques for diagnosis of norovirus has been difficult owing to the lack of methods for culturing the virus in vitro and the lack of an appropriate animal model. The use of molecular-based diagnostic assays is likely to improve our ability to recognize these infections and better understand their importance. 51, 66, 67 The treatment for norovirus is supportive; oral rehydration solutions are used if necessary. Significant dehydration is uncommon and the need for hospitalization is rare.\n\nThe enteric adenoviruses are among the more recently recognized viral pathogens that cause acute gastroenteritis. Adenoviruses are a large group of viruses long recognized for their role in the pathogenesis of respiratory infections and keratoconjunctivitis. Most of the 47 serotypes are known to be shed in the feces of infected patients. In patients with predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms, the organisms are detectable by electron microscopy of stool samples; however, they fail to grow in standard tissue culture conditions. 23 Their unique cell culture requirements allow for the differentiation of nonenteric aden-oviruses from the enteric serotypes (Ad40 and Ad41), which are recognized to be among the common causes of viral childhood gastroenteritis. 68, 69 Infection with enteric adenoviruses apparently occurs throughout the year, with only slight seasonal variation. 70, 71 This disease tends to affect predominantly younger children, with most patients being younger than 2 years of age. 71, 72 Enteric adenovirus is spread by the fecaloral route. Transmission of the disease to family contacts is unusual.\n\nDiarrhea is the most commonly reported symptom of enteric adenoviral infection. In contrast with diarrhea from other viral enteritides, diarrhea from enteric adenovirus typically persists for a prolonged period, sometimes as long as 14 days. Viruses may be excreted in the feces of infected patients for 1 to 2 weeks. 70 Vomiting frequently occurs but is usually mild and of a much shorter duration than is the diarrhea. Dehydration has been seen in approximately half of affected patients and hospitalization is sometimes necessary. The frequency of association of respiratory symptoms with enteric adenovirus infection is unclear. 72 The diagnosis of enteric adenovirus is best made by electron microscopy or immunoelectron microscopy of stool samples or from intestinal biopsy specimens. ELISA 73 and PCR 74 techniques have also been used successfully in enteric adenovirus diagnosis. Treatment is mainly supportive and oral rehydration solutions are useful in cases of dehydration.\n\nAstrovirus, similar to HuCV, is a single-stranded RNA virus grouped with the small round structured viruses. However, the recently derived sequence of the astrovirus RNA genome reveals that this agent is sufficiently different to be classified in its own family as Astroviridae. 75 Astrovirus is worldwide in distribution and tends to infect mainly children in the 1 to 3-year age group. In controlled studies in Thailand, astrovirus infection was the second most common cause of enteritis, after rotavirus infection, in symptomatic children. 76 Astrovirus infection occurred in 9% of children with diarrhea, compared with 2% of controls. Comparable findings have been reported in daycare centers in North America and Japan. 77, 78 Most children infected with astrovirus develop symptoms. Vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever all are commonly seen with infection by this agent and symptoms typically last 1 to 4 days. Spread of the virus may occur via the fecal-oral route from person-to-person contact or through contaminated food or water. Asymptomatic shedding of astrovirus has also been reported. 79\n\nA variety of other viruses are being studied to determine what role, if any, they may play in the pathogenesis of human enteric infections. With the exception of those viruses previously discussed in detail, insufficient data are available to ascertain clinical and epidemiologic differences, if any, among the various small round viruses.\n\nPestivirus, a single-stranded RNA virus of the togavirus family, has been found in the feces of 24% of children living on an American Indian reservation who had diarrhea attributable to no other infectious agent. 80 These children experienced only mild diarrhea but had more severe respiratory complaints.\n\nCoronavirus is known to cause an upper respiratory illness in humans and has been shown to cause diarrhea in some animals. 81 The role of this agent in human diarrheal disease is unclear and at least one study found coronavirus more commonly in children without diarrhea than in those who were ill. 82 Coronavirus was implicated in an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis. 83 Toroviruses are pleomorphic viruses recognized to cause enteric illness in a variety of animals. 84 Members of this group, originally described in Berne, Switzerland and Breda, Iowa and named for those cities, have been seen in the feces of humans with diarrheal disease. 85 Because of the pleomorphic structure of toroviruses, electron microscopy was inadequate to prove an etiopathogenic role of these viruses in diarrheal disease. The more recent findings of torovirus-like particles by immunoassay, using validated anti-Breda virus antiserum, lends additional weight to the hypothesis that these are agents of human gastroenteritis. 86 Their causative role in human disease, however, remains unproven. Similarly, picobirnavirus is known to cause disease in animals and has been isolated from stools of humans with diarrheal illness. 87 Cytomegalovirus has been associated with enteritis and colitis. Except for M\u00e9n\u00e9trier's disease, caused by gastric cytomegalovirus infection, enteritis and colitis seem to occur almost exclusively among immunocompromised patients. In this population, cytomegalovirus causes viremia and is carried by the blood stream to a variety of sites, including organs of the gastrointestinal tract. Diagnosis may be made by virus detection in feces, by demonstration of typical cytomegalic inclusion cells, or by in situ hybridization. 88 \n\nFor an infecting bacterial agent to cause diarrhea, it must first overcome the following gastrointestinal tract defenses: (1) gastric acidity, (2) intestinal motility, (3) mucus secretion, (4) normal intestinal microflora and (5) specific mucosal and systemic immune mechanisms. Gastric acidity is the first barrier encountered by infecting organisms. 89 Many studies have demonstrated the bactericidal properties of gastric juice at pH less than 4. 90 In patients with achlorhydria or decreased gastric acid secretion, the gastric pH is higher and this bactericidal effect is diminished. Gastric acidity serves to decrease the number of viable bacteria that proceed to the small intestine.\n\nOrganisms surviving the gastric acidity barrier are trapped within the mucus layer of the small intestine, facilitating their movement through the intestine by peristalsis. If motility in the intestine is abnormal or absent, organisms are more readily able to initiate the infectious process. Some organisms can elaborate toxic substances that impair intestinal motility. Increased intestinal peristalsis, which occurs during some enteric infections, may be an attempt by the host to rid itself of infective organisms.\n\nIn addition to its role in conjunction with intestinal motility, mucus also serves to provide a nonspecific barrier to bacterial proliferation and mucosal colonization. This barrier has been shown to be effective in preventing toxins from exerting their effects. Exfoliated mucosal cells trapped in the mucous layer may trap invading microorganisms. Mucus also contains carbohydrate analog of surface receptors, which may prevent invading organisms from binding to actual receptors.\n\nThe normal endogenous microflora of the gut serves as its next line of defense. Anaerobes, which are a large component of the normal flora, elaborate short-chain fatty acids and lactic acid, which are toxic to many potential pathogens. In breast-fed infants, this line of defense is enhanced by the presence of anaerobic lactobacilli, which produce fermentative products that act as toxins to foreign bacteria. Further evidence in support of the importance of endogenous microflora is the increase in susceptibility to infection after one's normal flora has been reduced by antibiotic administration, as is seen with Clostridium difficile infection.\n\nThe most complex element in the host-defense armamentarium involves the mucosal and systemic immune systems. Both serum and secretory antibodies may exert their protective effects at the intestinal level, even though the serum components are produced outside the gut. An immune response may be specific to a particular infective agent or generalized to a common group of bacterial antigens.\n\nBacteria have developed a variety of virulence factors (Table 36 .2) to overcome host defense mechanisms: (1) invasion of the mucosa, followed by intraepithelial cell multiplication or invasion of the lamina propria; (2) production of cytotoxins, which disrupt cell function via direct alteration of the mucosal surface; (3) production of enterotoxins, polypeptides that alter cellular salt and water balance yet leave cell morphology undisturbed; and (4) adherence to the mucosal surface with resultant flattening of the microvilli and disruption of normal cell functioning. Each of the bacterial virulence mechanisms acts on specific regions of the intestine. Enterotoxins are primarily effective in the small bowel but can affect the colon; the effects of cytotoxins and direct epithelial cell invasion occur predominantly in the colon. Enteroadhesive mechanisms appear to function in both the small intestine and colon.\n\nMembers of the species Salmonella are currently recognized as the most common cause of bacterial diarrhea among children in the USA. Surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that the incidence of disease caused by this bacteria is increasing. 91 Infection caused by Salmonella may result in several different clinical syndromes, including (1) acute gastroenteritis; (2) focal, non-intestinal infections; (3) bacteremia; (4) asymptomatic carrier state; and (5) enteric fever (including typhoid fever). Each of these entities may be caused by any of the commonly recognized species of Salmonella.\n\nSalmonella is a motile, gram-negative bacillus of the family Enterobacteriaceae. It can be identified on selective media because it does not ferment lactose. Three distinct species of Salmonella are recognized: Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella choleraesuis and Salmonella typhi. S. enteritidis is further subdivided into approximately 1700 serotypes. Each serotype is referred to by its genus and serotype names (e.g. Salmonella typhimurium) rather than the formally correct S. enteritidis, serotype typhimurium. S. choleraesuis and S. typhi are known to have only one serotype each.\n\nSalmonella is estimated to cause 1 to 2 million gastrointestinal infections each year in the USA. 91 At Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center salmonellae are the most commonly isolated bacterial enteropathogens ( Fig. 36.1 ). The highest attack rate for salmonellosis is in infancy, with a lower incidence of symptomatic infection in patients older than 6 years of age. 91, 92 Non-typhoidal Salmonella is usually spread via contaminated water supplies or foods, with meat, fresh produce, fowl, eggs and raw milk frequently implicated.\n\nA large outbreak involved contaminated alfalfa sprouts which were shipped worldwide. 93 Most of the eggassociated outbreaks have involved products such as mayonnaise, ice cream, 94 and cold desserts, in which salmonella can multiply profusely and which are eaten without cooking after the addition of, or contamination by, raw egg. Although 'shell' eggs are frequently contaminated, the number of bacteria in infected eggs is often near or below the human infective dose. 95 In contrast, with a generation time of 80 min at 20\u02daC, one bacterium can become a billion in 40 h and with a generation time of 40 min at 25\u02daC, it can do so in 20 h.\n\nAlthough any of these food sources may become contaminated through contact with an infected food handler, the farm animals themselves are often infected. Pets, notably cats, turtles, lizards, snakes and chicks, may also harbor Salmonella. Person-to-person spread of infection also occurs and is especially common in cases involving infants. 96\n\nInocula of fewer than 10 3 salmonellae are probably sufficient to cause disease. 96 Patients in whom host defenses are diminished are more likely to develop clinical manifestations of the disease. This has been demonstrated in patients who have reduced levels of gastric acid. 89 may involve altered macrophage function, defective complement activation, or damage to the bones from thromboses.\n\nHaving overcome host defenses, Salmonella produces disease through a process that begins with colonization of the ileum and the colon. The organisms next invade enterocytes and colonocytes and proliferate within epithelial cells and in the lamina propria ( Fig. 36.2) . 97 From the lamina propria, Salmonella may then move to the mesenteric lymph nodes and eventually to the systemic circulation, causing bacteremia. Because these organisms invade enterocytes and colonocytes, both enteritis, with watery diarrhea and colitis, with bloody diarrhea, may result.\n\nAfter an incubation period of 12-72 h, Salmonella usually produces a mild, self-limited illness characterized by fever and watery diarrhea. Blood, mucus, or both are commonly present in the stool. Bacteremia occurs in approximately 6% of Salmonella infections in children but much less frequently in adults. 98 Patients may develop sequelae after Salmonella infection, including pneumonia, meningitis and osteomyelitis.\n\nEven in those patients in whom no sequelae occur, excretion of the organisms may persist for several weeks. In patients younger than 5 years of age, the median time of excretion is 7 weeks, with 2.6% of patients continuing to shed organisms for 1 year or longer. 99 Studies have also shown a higher incidence of the carrier state among children with salmonellosis than is seen in adults. 99 Localization of Salmonella organisms in chronic carriers is often in the biliary tract and is frequently associated with cholelithiasis.\n\nDiagnosis of Salmonella infection can be made through stool or blood culture. Use of enriched media and culture of material from freshly passed stools, rather than from rectal swab, increase the likelihood of recovering the organism. 99 Owing to the increased risk of developing the carrier state, antimicrobial treatment of uncomplicated cases of Salmonella gastroenteritis is not recommended. 100 Treatment is recommended in patients at high risk for the development of disseminated disease, including those who are immunocompromised, those with hematologic disease, patients with artificial implants, those with severe colitis and pregnant women. Treatment is also recommended for patients at any age who appear toxic.\n\nTreatment of all children younger than 1 year of age with salmonellosis remains controversial because of an increased risk of bacteremia and secondary infections in this age group. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for infants with Salmonella bacteremia. Parenteral antibiotics are recommended for any infant (younger than 3 months of age) with a stool culture that is positive for Salmonella. 101 Most Salmonella are sensitive to a wide variety of antibiotics, including ampicillin (35 mg/kg, max. 1 g, per dose, given every 4 h, i.v., for 14 days); chloramphenicol (20 mg/kg, max. 1 g, per dose, given every 6 h, intravenously or orally, for 14 days); trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (trimethoprim, 5 mg/kg, max. 160 mg, plus sulfamethoxazole, 25 mg/kg, max. 800 mg, per dose, given every 12 h, orally, for 14 days) and the third-generation cephalosporins. 102 Resistance to ampicillin is increasing. 103 Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or a fluoroquinolone (not approved for use in children younger than 18 years of age) are often effective when resistance to other agents is demonstrated.\n\nA follow-up stool culture usually is not warranted unless the patient is employed in the preparation of food. If evidence of a 'cure' is necessary, two to three consecutive negative stool cultures, obtained 1-3 days apart, are sufficient.\n\nAlthough uncommon in the USA, typhoid fever, caused by S. typhi, commonly affects children in developing countries. S. typhi differs from other salmonellae in that it requires a human host. The disease it causes also differs in severity from the typically mild gastroenteritis caused by other members of the genus; S. typhi infection also has a higher case-fatality rate. Typhoid fever typically begins with a period of fever lasting approximately 1 week. Patients then complain of headache and abdominal pain. Diarrhea is not usually a manifestation of typhoid fever and many patients experience constipation. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly have also been frequently noted. 97 The characteristic 'rose spots' (palpable, erythematous lesions), typical in adult cases of typhoid fever, occur with far less frequency in pediatric patients. 104 Patients may become chronic carriers.\n\nDiagnosis of typhoid fever is made on the basis of positive blood cultures. S. typhi is usually sensitive to several antimicrobial agents, including ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. Drug choice is based on site of infection and susceptibility of the organism.\n\nA live oral vaccine from an attenuated strain of S. typhi (Ty21a) has been available in the USA since 1989; one recommended dosing schedule is four doses given every other day. 105 Current efforts are directed toward development of other attenuated strains, which may provide successful immunization in single-dose therapy. 105 Vaccine based on the Vi antigen from the S. typhi polysaccharide capsule produces seroconversion in 90% of subjects, lasting 3 years. 106, 107 Newer oral vaccines based on either different attenuated strains of S. typhi 108 or S. typhi that constitutively express Vi antigen, 109 are currently under study.\n\nBacillary dysentery, an illness caused by Shigella, was described in ancient Greece. Osler, 110 in 1892, referred to the disease as 'one of the four great epidemic diseases of the world'. He further stated: 'In the tropics it destroys more lives than cholera and it has been more fatal to armies than powder and shot'. Despite our increased knowledge of the pathogenesis and treatment of shigellosis, this organism continues to be a significant cause of diarrheal disease.\n\nShigella is a gram-negative, non-motile, non-lactosefermenting aerobic bacillus, closely related to members of the genus Escherichia. The organisms are classified into four species or groups known as Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii and Shigella sonnei (groups A, B, C and D, respectively). Members of groups A, B and C exist in numerous serotypes, but only one serotype of group D is known. 101 S. sonnei is the most commonly recovered Shigella species in the developed world, accounting for 70% of isolates in the USA. S. dysenteriae and S. flexneri are the most commonly recovered species of Shigella in the developing world. 111\n\nShigella is worldwide in its distribution and the incidence and severity of shigellosis span an equally broad range. In Highland Mayan Indian children, the incidence of shigellosis is 1900 cases per 1000 children per year in the third year of life. 112 In the developed world, Shigella occurs much less frequently. However, in some studies Shigella is the second most common pathogen identified in cases of bacterial diarrhea in children aged 6 months to 10 years. 113 It may also be the most common bacterial cause of outbreaks of diarrhea in daycare settings. Outbreaks of shigellosis have also been described in residential institutions and on cruise ships. This disease is endemic on American Indian reservations in the Southwest.\n\nShigella is predominantly spread via the fecal-oral route, with person-to-person contact the most likely method. Secondary spread to household contacts may occur. The infection may be spread through contamination of food and water, as often occurs in areas of poor sanitation and inadequate personal hygiene.\n\nPatients infected with Shigella may experience a mild, selflimited, watery diarrhea that is clinically indistinguishable from gastroenteritis caused by a variety of other agents. The more classic form of shigellosis, however, is bacillary dysentery. This illness usually begins with fever and malaise, followed by watery diarrhea and cramping abdominal pain. By the second day of illness, blood and mucus are usually present in the stools and tenesmus has become a prominent symptom. At this point, in approximately 50% of affected patients, the stool volume decreases, with only scant amounts of blood and mucus being passed. 111 This pattern of bloody, mucus-containing stools is referred to as dysentery. Bacteremia is an uncommon feature of this illness, but several other complications have been reported, including seizures (in children), arthritis, purulent keratitis and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Non-suppurative arthritis is the most commonly occurring extraintestinal complication of shigellosis. Patients who carry the histocompatible locus antigen HLA-B27 may be predisposed to the development of this complication as well as to the development of Reiter's syndrome. 114 The association of seizures with shigellosis was earlier attributed to the neurotoxic effect of the Shigella toxin (Shiga toxin). It now seems likely, however, that the seizures may simply represent a subgroup of common febrile seizures and have no direct relation to the effects of Shiga toxin.\n\nShigella has been found to cause disease only in humans and in the higher apes. 111 The organisms are potent, with as few as 10 organisms being able to cause disease in a healthy adult. 111 Patients infected with Shigella may excrete 10 5 to 10 8 organisms/g of feces. This high rate of excretion and the relatively low number of organisms required to produce disease make possible the widespread distribution of disease.\n\nFor Shigella to exert its pathologic effect on a host, the bacteria must first come into contact with the surface of an intestinal epithelial cell and induce cytoskeletal rearrangements resulting in phagocytosis. 97, 115, 116 The bacteria then secrete enzymes that degrade the phagosomal membrane, releasing the bacteria into the host cytoplasm. Intracytoplasmic bacteria move rapidly, in association with a comet tail made up of host cell actin filaments. When moving bacteria reach the cell margin, they push out long protrusions with the bacteria at the tips that are then taken up by neighboring cells, allowing the infection to spread from cell to cell (Fig. 36.3) . 97 Shiga toxin is elaborated by all species, although in greater amounts by S. dysenteriae than by other species, 111 and may play a role in the pathogenesis of Shigella infection. The toxin has neurotoxic, enterotoxic and cytotoxic effects. 111 Structurally, it is composed of an active, or A, subunit (molecular weight 32 kD) surrounded by five binding, or B, subunits (77 kD). 111 The B subunits bind to cellspecific receptors and are taken up by endocytosis. Within the cells, the B subunits are cleaved away and the remaining A subunit is shortened by proteolysis. This molecule is thought then to bind to the 60S ribosome and inhibit protein synthesis, leading to cell death and sloughing. 117 This is the presumed mechanism for the cytotoxic effect. An enterotoxic effect of Shiga toxin in the ileum may account for the early watery diarrhea.\n\nIn patients with signs and symptoms of colitis, the diagnosis of shigellosis should be considered. Stool culture provides the only definitive means to differentiate this organism from other invasive pathogens. Shigella may be cultured from stool specimens or rectal swabs, especially if mucopus is present, but there may be a delay of several days from the onset of symptoms to the recovery of organisms. Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy typically reveals a friable mucosa, possibly with discrete ulcers. Rectal biopsy may be useful to differentiate shigellosis from ulcerative colitis. 118 In addition to rehydration, antimicrobial therapy has been recommended for Shigella (1) to shorten the course of the disease, (2) to decrease the period of excretion of the organisms 119 and (3) to decrease the secondary attack rate, since humans provide the only reservoir for the organism. However, handwashing, rather than use of antimicrobials, is the most effective method to prevent person-to-person spread. Those clinicians who advise against the routine treatment of shigellosis with antibiotics argue that (1) the disease is most often self-limited and (2) the use of antibiotics may facilitate the development of resistant strains 120 and may increase the likelihood developing HUS as a sequela. 112 We recommend antibiotic therapy only for patients who are severely ill at the time of diagnosis or who remain ill at the time of identification of Shigella in a stool culture.\n\nA wide range of antibiotics has been used to treat Shigella, necessitated by the development of resistant strains. Currently, the agent of choice is trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (trimethoprim, 5 mg/kg, max. 160 mg, plus sulfamethoxazole, 25 mg/kg, max. 800 mg, per dose, given every 12 h, orally or intravenously, for 5 days). Ampicillin (25 mg/kg, max. 500 mg, per dose, given every 6 h, orally or i.v., for 5 days) may be used if local strains are typically susceptible. 102 Amoxicillin is ineffective against Shigella. 121 Nalidixic acid (55 mg/kg per day given every 6 h for 5 days) has also proved effective. Cefixime and ceftriaxone are alternative agents for resistant organisms. 111 Tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin have been used successfully for the treatment of Shigella, but these agents are approved for use only in adult patients. Multidrugresistant strains have occurred in Latin America, Central Africa and Southeast Asia. 122 Development of a vaccine for shigellosis is currently being pursued. These efforts include vaccines using a modified Escherichia coli strain; one using a mutant strain of S. flexneri, which lacks the ability to proliferate intracellularly; and one based on a strain with mutations in its virulence genes. 111\n\nCampylobacter is a gram-negative, motile, curved or spiral-shaped rod, exhibiting a 'seagull' appearance when identified in stained stool smears. 123 Multiple species of Campylobacter have been recognized, including Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter fetus, Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter laridis, with C. jejuni being the one most commonly associated with disease in humans. 124 Campylobacter upsaliensis has been reported as another member of this group that causes diarrhea, 125 and it seems probable that still others may be identified.\n\nCampylobacter is recognized to be worldwide in distribution. In developing countries, Campylobacter is a significant bacterial cause of diarrhea in children younger than 2 years of age, yet it rarely occurs in developing nations in older children and adults. When infection does occur in the population older than 2 years of age it tends to be asymptomatic. 126 It is likely that patients in these countries are infected with Campylobacter early in life and then develop immunity, thus making asymptomatic infection more typical in older children and adults.\n\nIn the industrialized world, most patients infected with Campylobacter develop symptoms. 126 The number of Campylobacter infections in these countries is now recognized to be quite high, with some studies finding this organism to be the most common cause of bacterial diarrhea. Campylobacter tends to infect people in two distinct age groups: children in the first year of life and young adults. 127 Campylobacter may be spread by direct contact or through contaminated sources of food and water. Milk, meat and eggs, especially if undercooked, have been implicated in outbreaks. These sources may be contaminated from human fecal shedding, or the organisms may be harbored in the asymptomatic farm animals. Campylobacter is commonly spread among populations of children in daycare centers.\n\nThe mechanisms through which Campylobacter produces disease are not fully understood but likely involve three potential mechanisms: 124 (1) adherence to the intestinal mucosa followed by the elaboration of toxin; (2) invasion of the mucosa in the terminal ileum and colon; and (3) 'translocation,' in which the organisms penetrate the mucosa and replicate in the lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes. The variety of pathogenic mechanisms may account for the spectrum of disease caused by Campylobacter. It is also conceivable that different strains or serotypes of Campylobacter may demonstrate different pathogenic mechanisms, as is seen with E. coli.\n\nCampylobacter may cause disease ranging from mild diarrhea to frank dysentery. Typically, patients experience fever and malaise followed by diarrhea, nausea and abdominal pain that may mimic appendicitis 92 or inflammatory bowel disease. The symptoms usually resolve in less than 1 week. 128 Bacteremia may rarely occur, with some species implicated more often than are others. 129 Campylobacter is also known to cause meningitis, abscesses, septic abortions, pancreatitis and pneumonia. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syn-drome and Reiter's syndrome are documented to occur as sequelae of Campylobacter infection. Increasing evidence has implicated C. jejuni as the most common antecedent of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and the variant form, Miller-Fisher syndrome, a neuropathy associated with ataxia, areflexia and ophthalmoplegia. 130, 131 Although evidence for molecular mimicry is still preliminary, it is likely that peripheral nerves share epitopes with C. jejuni; therefore, the immune response initially mounted to attack C. jejuni is misdirected to peripheral nerves. 131 After the resolution of symptoms, patients may continue to shed organisms for as long as 7 weeks. 132\n\nCulture of the organisms, the gold standard for diagnosis, is routinely accomplished in most laboratories if selective media are used and cultures are incubated at 42\u02daC. Because disease caused by Campylobacter is usually mild and selflimited, supportive treatment alone should suffice. In cases of severe disease, erythromycin (10 mg/kg, max. 500 mg, per dose, given every 6 h for 5 to 7 days) has been recommended. 102 The need for antibiotic therapy has been questioned, based in part on several studies demonstrating a decrease in the duration of excretion of Campylobacter after antibiotic treatment but no decrease in the duration of symptoms. In general, in these studies, antimicrobial therapy was begun late in the course of the illness. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, Salazar-Lindo and colleagues 133 demonstrated a shortened duration of illness, from 4.2 to 2.5 days, in patients who received erythromycin by day 4 of their illness. For cases of Campylobacter septicemia, gentamicin (1.5-2.5 mg/kg per dose, i.m. or i.v., given every 8 h) is recommended, with chloramphenicol and erythromycin acceptable as alternatives. Tetracycline (250-500 mg per dose, i.v., given every 6-12 h) may be used in patients older than 8 years of age. 102 Ciprofloxacin is an effective alternative agent but is not approved for use in children younger than 18 years of age. Antibiotic treatment is recommended for outbreaks of Campylobacter in daycare settings, because treatment has been shown to eliminate fecal shedding of organisms within 48 h. 124\n\nThe genus Yersinia includes the species Yersinia pestis, which causes plague; Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, known to cause pseudoappendicitis, mesenteric adenitis and gastroenteritis; and Yersinia enterocolitica, recognized with increasing frequency as a cause of bacterial diarrhea. Yersinia is a gram-negative, coccoid bacillus that is facultatively anaerobic. It is non-lactose-fermenting and is observed to be motile at temperatures of 25\u02daC but nonmotile at 37\u02daC.\n\nYersinia was initially thought to occur with greater frequency in countries with cooler climates but is now recognized to be worldwide in distribution. Although the true incidence and prevalence of this organism are not known, in some areas yersiniosis occurs more frequently than does shigellosis. 134 Outbreaks due to Yersinia have been associated with spread through contaminated water and foods, including bean sprouts, tofu and chocolate milk. 134, 135 Pork has also been implicated as a source, as in the Fulton County, Georgia, outbreak in 1990, in which chitterlings were found to be the vehicle of infection. 136, 137 The organism tends to cause disease more frequently in young children, with 24 months the median age in one study. 138 Yersinia may also be spread among household contacts. In addition, there may be an increased incidence in the summer months. 134, 138 Pathogenesis Y. enterocolitica constitutes a heterogeneous group of serotypes with many identified virulence factors. 139 Y. enterocolitica produces disease in the intestine through an invasive route. After penetrating the mucosal epithelium, primarily in the ileum, organisms replicate in Peyer's patches and accumulate in the mesenteric lymph nodes. 134 Most serotypes produce an enterotoxin similar to the E. coli heat-stable toxin but only at temperatures lower than 30\u02daC; therefore, this toxin may not have an important role in disease production by Yersinia in the human intestine. There is speculation on the role of preformed toxin in causing disease, because toxin may be produced when the organisms are present in refrigerated foods. 134 The virulence of Y. enterocolitica has been shown to be plasmid related. Different serotypes exhibit different degrees of virulence. Serotypes O:3 and O:9 are the ones most frequently associated with diarrheal disease in Europe and Japan, whereas a larger number of serotypes are seen in North America. 139 \n\nThe most frequent clinical syndrome caused by Y. enterocolitica is gastroenteritis, which typically affects young children. After an incubation period of 1-11 days, patients develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain. 134 A marked increase in the leukocyte count is common. The symptoms usually resolve in 5-14 days, but have been known to persist for several months. Excretion of organisms occurs for about 6 weeks. 138 Several complications, including appendicitis, have been documented after Y. enterocolitica infection. However, in older children and young adults, Yersinia is more likely to produce the pseudoappendicular syndrome, in which the signs and symptoms mimic appendicitis. 134 In this same age group, there has also been an association of Y. enterocolitica with nonspecific abdominal pain. 140 Radiographic changes in the terminal ileum more often associated with Crohn's disease, namely mucosal thickening and aphthous ulcers, have been seen with yersiniosis in young adults. 92 Yersinia bacteremia occurs and, despite therapy with appropriate antibiotics, has a case-fatality rate of 34-50%. The finding of Yersinia in blood from asymptomatic donors, however, makes the possibility of transient bacteremia seem likely as well. 134 Sequelae of Yersinia infection include erythema nodosum and reactive arthropathy; however, these are more commonly seen in adults. 139 This arthropathy tends to involve the weight-bearing joints of the lower extremities and has been noted to occur most often in Yersinia patients who carry the histocompatibility antigen HLA-B27. 141\n\nYersinia may be cultured with the use of selective media, preferably with 'cold enrichment'. Despite the best of methods, culture of Yersinia may require as long as 4 weeks. In addition to diagnosis by culture, Yersinia may also be detected serologically, through the use of agglutinin titers. These measurements appear to be useful only in conjunction with cultures, because agglutinin titers may be affected by a number of factors, including the patient's age, the underlying disease and previous use of antibiotics and immunosuppressive agents. 142 These titers may also be more useful in Europe and Japan, where infection is caused by a restricted number of serotypes.\n\nAntibiotics have not been proven effective in alleviating symptoms of Yersinia or in shortening the period of its excretion. 134 Pai and associates 143 compared the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs placebo in the treatment of Yersinia gastroenteritis and found no significant difference. It should be noted, however, that therapy was not begun until near the end of the course of the illness. 143 In cases of severe disease and in patients with underlying illness, treatment is recommended. Trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol and third-generation cephalosporins are generally recommended. Tetracycline and quinolones are alternative choices for adult patients. 102 Gentamicin or chloramphenicol is recommended for treatment of septicemia. Because septicemia may be associated with an iron overload state, 144, 145 cessation of iron therapy is also recommended during infection.\n\nAlthough cholera is a disease rarely encountered in developed countries, it remains an important entity. 146, 147 Investigation of the pathogenesis of cholera led to the recognition and understanding of the mechanism of action of cholera toxin, which remains the prototype for bacterial enterotoxins. Cholera is also important, from a therapeutic perspective, in that initial efforts in the use of oral rehydration solutions were carried out in patients with cholera. However, most importantly, on a worldwide basis, cholera continues to be a major public health problem in almost all developing countries. 148, 149 Cholera afflicts both children and adults and cholera exists as an endemic disease in more than 100 countries of the world. The death rate is highly dependent on the treatment facilities; the highest mortality rates are in Africa, where case-fatality rates have approximated 10%, especially during epidemic attacks. It is likely that cholera as an endemic infection causes 100 000 to 150 000 deaths annually.\n\nVibrio cholerae is a gram-negative, motile, curved bacillus that is free-living in bodies of salt water. 150 V. cholerae is classified on the basis of lipopolysaccharide antigens. Until recently, all epidemic strains of V. cholerae were of the O1 serotype. Group O1 is further subdivided into two biotypes: classic and El Tor. Other serotypes were thought to cause sporadic cases of diarrhea but not epidemic disease. This dictum was discarded by the development of an ongoing epidemic in Asia and South America caused by a new serotype, O139, synonym Bengal. 151, 152 Although the pathogenesis and clinical features of O139 cholera are identical to those of O1 cholera, persons having immunity to serotype O1 are not immune to the Bengal serotype. This lack of immunity is primarily a result of the unique O139 cell surface antigen.\n\nV. cholerae is spread via contamination of food and water supplies. There is no evidence of an animal reservoir, but humans may serve as transient carriers. 153 On rare occasions, humans may chronically carry the organism. 154 Owing to the nature of its spread, persons living in areas with adequate sanitation are at minimal, if any, risk for encountering cholera. Cholera does occur in the USA, but usually as a result of imported food brought back by returning international travelers. Travelers from the USA to endemic areas are at low risk (about 1 per 30 000 travelers). 155 Cholera has also been isolated from oysters in the Gulf Coast. 156 However, owing to the frequency of international travel, it is important for the clinician who encounters a patient with severe cholera symptoms (dehydration and rice-water stools) to suspect this infection even in nonendemic areas.\n\nV. cholerae enters its potential host through the oral route, usually in contaminated food or water. Volunteer studies have shown that a relatively large number of organisms (approximately 10 11 ) must be ingested to produce symptoms. 145 Similar to other ingested organisms, V. cholerae must survive the acidic gastric environment. The importance of gastric acidity as a host-protective factor is borne out by the increased occurrence of cholera in patients with absent or reduced gastric acidity. 89, 157 The organisms travel to the small intestine, where they adhere to the epithelium. This process may be aided by production of mucinase. 157 The intestinal epithelium remains intact with normal morphology. 158 Vibrio species produce a toxin that is composed of a central subunit (A) surrounded by five B subunits; the latter bind to a ganglioside, GM 1 , which serves as the toxin receptor. This binding facilitates the transfer of the A subunit across the cell membrane, where it is cleaved into two components, denoted A 1 and A 2 . The disulfide linkage between A 1 and A 2 is reduced to liberate an active A 1 peptide, which acts as a catalyst to facilitate the transfer of adenosine diphosphateribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to a guanyl nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G s ). G s then stimulates adenylate cyclase, located on the basolateral membrane, thereby increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate. This result in turn leads to chloride secretion and a net flux of fluid into the intestinal lumen. 159 Although this mechanism of toxin action adequately explains the clinical symptoms of cholera, similar symptoms have been noted in patients infected with strains that do not produce the classic cholera toxin. This has led to the recognition that V. cholerae harbors additional virulence factors in the bacterial genome that may contribute to diarrheal disease and must be considered in the design of a non-reactigenic vaccine. Newly recognized toxins produced by V. cholerae include zonula occludens toxin and the accessory cholera toxin. 160, 161 \n\nAfter an incubation period, commonly 1-3 days, the symptoms of cholera usually begin abruptly with vomiting and profuse, watery diarrhea. The stool soon becomes clear, with bits of mucus giving it the so-called rice-water appearance. Patients do not experience tenesmus, but rather a sense of relief with defecation. 150 Typically there is no fever. The rate of fluid loss with cholera can be remarkable in severe disease, with purging rates in excess of 1 l/h reported in adult patients. 158 Despite the dramatic presentation and health risk of 'cholera gravis', most patients with cholera infection are asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms. In addition to people with reduced gastric acidity, people with blood group O are at increased risk for more severe disease. Other host factors that predispose to increased purging are less clear.\n\nV. cholerae is identified by colonial morphology and pigmentation on selective agar (e.g. thiosulfate citrate bile salt-sucrose agar). Further identification depends on biochemical markers (e.g. positive oxidase reaction) and motility of the organism. Specific serotyping is used to confirm the identification The mainstay of cholera treatment is rehydration. In cases in which the disease is less severe and is recognized early, oral rehydration solutions are appropriate and effective. When purging is excessive (more than 10 ml/kg per h), intravenous rehydration is required.\n\nAntibiotics have been shown to cause a decrease in duration of the diarrhea, total amount of fluid lost and length of time organisms are excreted. 150 Tetracycline (250-500 mg per dose, given every 6 h for 3 to 5 days) has been recommended as an appropriate antibiotic for adults, 158 and furazolidone (1.25 mg/kg, max. 100 mg, per dose, given every 6 h for 10 days) has been suggested for children and pregnant patients. Ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and doxycycline may also be used. Single-dose ciprofloxacin has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of V. cholerae O1 or O139, 162 although this drug is not approved for use in children.\n\nDespite much progress, an ideal cholera vaccine is not yet available. An ideal vaccine would provide a high level of long-term protection even to those at high risk for severe illness (e.g. people with blood group type O) and this protection would commence shortly after administration of a single oral dose. 163 New oral vaccines have been developed for cholera, including both killed vaccines and live attenuated strains. 164,165 CVD 103-HgR, a vaccine strain with a 94% deletion of the ctxA proved efficacious against experimental challenge with V. cholera El Tor Inaba 3 months after inoculation, suggesting it may be useful for travelers to endemic areas. 166 Unfortunately, CVD 103-HgR was not effective in a field trial. 167 Peru-15, a non-motile strain that colonizes better than CVD 103-HgR, has been shown to be highly effective in volunteer studies. 168 Despite these successes, there remains a need to continue development of non-reactigenic O1 vaccines and vaccines against the new O139 epidemic strain. Neither the killed nor the live O1 vaccines protect against the new serotype O139, since most of the protection is lipopolysaccharide-mediated and the new serotype has a unique lipopolysaccharide. Therefore, the appearance of the new serotype reinforces the need for testing additional vaccine candidates.\n\nThe non-cholera vibrios, V. parahaemolyticus, V. fluvialis, V. mimicus, V. hollisae, V. furnissii and V. vulnificans, have been shown to cause gastrointestinal illness, wound infections and septicemia. 169 Although each organism has its own characteristics, most non-cholera vibrios produce a protein toxin identical to the classic cholera toxin. 138 Some species also produce a heat-stable toxin similar to E. coli heat-stable toxin. 170 Although these organisms produce a choleralike illness, the stool may sometimes contain blood and leukocytes and sepsis can occur. This has led to speculation that some members of this group, namely V. parahaemolyticus, may be capable of invasiveness as well as toxin production. 169 In the USA, gastroenteritis caused by these vibrios is most often associated with the ingestion of raw oysters. 171 Gastroenteritis caused by non-O1 vibrios tends to be far milder than that caused by V. cholerae. In severe cases of diarrhea or septicemia, antibiotics may be helpful, with the agents used for V. cholerae recommended.\n\nE. coli constitutes a diverse group of organisms, including nonpathogenic strains, which are among the most common bacteria in the normal flora of the human intestine and pathogenic strains. Pathogenic E. coli strains that cause diarrheal illness have been recognized since the 1940s. 172, 173 These diarrheagenic E. coli have been studied extensively and are currently classified, on the basis of serogrouping or pathogenic mechanisms, into six major groups: (1) enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), an important cause of diarrhea in infants in developing countries; (2) enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), a cause of diarrhea in infants in developing areas of the world and a cause of traveler's diarrhea in adults; (3) enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), which cause either a watery ETEC-like illness or, less commonly, a dysentery-like illness; (4) Shiga toxinproducing E. coli (Stx-producing; formerly known as enterohemorrhagic E. coli ), which cause hemorrhagic colitis and HUS; (5) enteroaggregative E. coli (EAggEC) and (6) diffusely-adherent E. coli (DAEC), which along with EPEC have been implicated as causes of persistent diarrhea. Each of these groups of E. coli has unique properties (Table 36. 3).\n\nEPEC is a major cause of diarrhea in developing countries. As many as 30-40% of cases of infant diarrhea, particularly in those infants less than 6-months of age, may be caused by EPEC and in some studies the frequency of EPEC infection exceeds that of rotavirus. [174] [175] [176] [177] In North America and the UK, EPEC infections were common during the 1940s through the 1960s; now they are most commonly associated with sporadic cases and nosocomial or daycare outbreaks. 178, 179 However, because of the general unavailability of serotyping, the true incidence of EPEC-associated diarrhea may be underestimated. A 1997 study in Seattle children with diarrhea, in which DNA probes were used to screen E. coli present in stool, found a high incidence of EPEC-like organisms (atypical EPEC) in this population. 180 The hallmark of EPEC infection is the 'attaching and effacing' lesion seen in the intestine. 179 adherence between the bacterium and the epithelial cell membrane. Directly beneath the surface of the adherent organism, there are marked cytoskeletal changes in the enterocyte, including accumulation of actin polymers. Often, the bacteria are raised on a pedestal-like structure as a result of this actin accumulation. A number of steps are probably responsible for the development of this attaching and effacing lesion. As proposed by Donnenberg and Kaper, 182 EPEC pathogenesis consists of three phases: (1) localized adherence, which brings the bacteria in close contact with the enterocyte (e.g. docking); (2) signal transduction, including increases in intracellular calcium and protein phosphorylation; and (3) intimate adherence, a multigene process encoded in the bacterium by a locus of enterocyte effacement. 183, 184 The dramatic loss of absorptive microvilli in the intestine presumably leads to diarrhea via malabsorption. Although this is probably the predominant mechanism, some evidence suggests that a separate secretory mechanism is also involved. Patients with symptomatic EPEC infection typically experience diarrhea, vomiting, malaise and fever. The stool may contain mucus but does not usually contain blood. Symptoms with EPEC infection are more severe than with some other enteric infections and may persist for 2 weeks or longer. 172 In some patients, EPEC has caused protracted diarrhea with dehydration, malnutrition and zinc deficiency as complications; treatment with parenteral hyperalimentation has been required. 179 EPEC can be detected by serotyping of isolated E. coli, 178, 185 by demonstration of the presence of the enterocyte adherence factor or other virulence genes using molecular probes, 186 or by identification of the attaching and effacing phenotype using tissue culture cells. 187 These assays are not commonly used in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Diagnosis of EPEC may be made by demonstrating the presence of adherent organisms on small intestinal or rectal biopsy. 178, 179, 185 Although controlled studies of antibiotic therapy for EPEC have been few, the significant morbidity associated with this agent argues for treatment with antibiotics in most cases. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (trimethoprim, 5 mg/kg, max. 160 mg, plus sulfamethoxazole, 25 mg/kg, max. 800 mg, per dose, given every 12 h) has been used with some success, as have oral neomycin and gentamicin.\n\nETEC are recognized as an important cause of diarrhea in infants in developing areas of the world. In endemic areas, children in the first few years of life may be infected several times each year. 188 In the USA, cases of ETEC among children are uncommon. 189 ETEC is also a major cause of traveler's diarrhea in adults. Fecal-oral transmission and consumption of heavily contaminated food or water are the most common vehicles for ETEC infection.\n\nThe production of disease by ETEC begins with colonization of the small intestine. There the bacteria depend on fimbriae (also called pili) to facilitate attachment to the mucosal surface and overcome the forward motion of peristalsis. This attachment process causes no detectable struc-tural changes in the architecture of the brush border membrane but does allow the bacteria to release their enterotoxins, heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxin (ST), in close proximity to the enterocyte brush border membrane where toxin receptors are present. 190 These toxins in turn stimulate adenylate cyclase (in the case of LT) or guanylate cyclase (in the case of ST) and both ultimately result in a net fluid secretion from the intestine (see the reviews by Cohen and Giannella 191 and by Sears and Kaper) . 192 Two endogenous ligands for the ST receptor, guanylin and uroguanylin, have been identified. 193, 194 This discovery is consistent with the hypothesis that ST is a superagonist and exerts its diarrheal action by means of usurping a normal secretory mechanisms in the intestine (e.g. by molecular mimicry of these less potent endogenous ligands). Uroguanylin may also act as a hormone regulating salt and water excretion in the kidney in response to an oral salt load. 195 Clinically, ETEC infection causes nausea, abdominal pain and watery diarrhea. Stools typically contain neither mucus nor leukocytes. ETEC can be diagnosed with the use of bioassays such as the suckling mouse assay, 196 immunoassays, or gene probes specific for either ST 197 or LT. 198 PCR assays are also available. However, none of these assays is commonly used in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Supportive measures are sufficient therapy for most cases of ETEC diarrhea, with oral rehydration a mainstay of therapy. Antibiotics, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, have been shown to decrease the duration of fecal excretion of the organisms. 199 Quinolone antibiotics may be more effective, 200 but they are not recommended for use in children.\n\nEIEC share many common features, including virulence mechanisms, with Shigella. These organisms preferentially colonize the colon and invade and replicate within epithelial cells, where they cause cell death. 172 In addition, both organisms elaborate one or more secretory enterotoxins. Clinically, both Shigella and EIEC infections are characterized by a period of watery diarrhea that precedes the onset of dysentery (scanty stools containing mucus, pus and blood). More commonly, in contrast to Shigella, only this first phase of watery diarrhea is seen in EIEC infection. 201 This illness is clinically indistinguishable from other causes of bacterial diarrhea (e.g. ETEC) or non-bacterial infectious diarrhea. In a minority of patients with EIEC infections, the dysentery syndrome of characteristic stools, tenesmus and fever is also seen. Bacteremia is not reported.\n\nInfection due to EIEC is uncommon, but foodborne outbreaks of disease have occurred in the USA and aboard cruise ships. Diagnosis is dependent on bioassay (the Sereny test), serotyping, ELISA, or DNA probe techniques. None of these tests is commonly available in the clinical laboratory. Treatment is currently limited to supportive measures, although ampicillin given intramuscularly has been associated with bacteriologic cure and clinical improvement. 201\n\nStx-producing E. coli are a distinct class of organisms that have been identified since 1983 as the cause of two recognizable syndromes: hemorrhagic colitis and HUS. 202, 203 Hemorrhagic colitis is an illness characterized by crampy abdominal pain, initial watery diarrhea and subsequent development of grossly bloody diarrhea with little or no fever. Although there may be more than 100 serotypes in this class of diarrheagenic E. coli, in North America the E. coli serotype O157:H7 is the prototypic member of this family of organisms. E. coli O157:H7 is the most common cause of infectious bloody diarrhea in the USA. 204 Similarly, HUS, which is defined as the triad of acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, is also highly associated with antecedent E. coli O157:H7 infection.\n\nStx-producing E. coli infections may occur in sporadic cases, but they have also been associated with outbreaks of disease in nursing homes, daycare centers and other institutions; several reviews have been published. [205] [206] [207] [208] It is estimated that E. coli O157:H7 causes approximately 10 000 to 20 000 infections per year in the USA alone and may be responsible for 250 deaths annually. 209 Inadequately cooked hamburgers were most likely the source of the first outbreak 186 and remain the most common vehicle of transmission. In 1993 there was a large epidemic in the western USA; inadequately cooked hamburgers were again implicated as the cause. Other, small epidemics have been attributed to apple juice or cider and large-scale outbreaks in Japan have been associated with bean sprouts. Contaminated water has also been a source of infection. 210, 211 Common to all of these outbreaks is a reservoir of Stx-producing E. coli in the intestines of cattle and other animals who are asymptomatic. Infection is spread either by direct contact with intestinal contents or through droppings or water runoff from contaminated pastures. A low infectious dose for Stx-producing E. coli and the resistance of these organisms to gastric acid and to the food preserving process (high salt and drying) contribute to the high attack rate. The low infectious dose also contributes to frequent person-to-person transmission. [205] [206] [207] [208] Both the very old and the very young appear to be at increased risk for Stx-producing E. coli infection and its complications. [205] [206] [207] [208] Clinical features and complications of E. coli O157:H7 infection include bloody diarrhea, nonbloody diarrhea, HUS, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and, uncommonly, asymptomatic infection. 205 Symptoms may persist for several days or, less commonly, for several weeks. Early reports suggested that carriage of the organism was brief and that prompt culture was necessary to recover these organisms. 212, 213 More recently, prolonged shedding has been observed. 214, 215 This has led to the recommendation that two negative stool cultures be obtained before a child is allowed to return to daycare. 214 The identification of Stx-producing E. coli is made difficult because it is not possible to differentiate diseaseproducing E. coli from normal enteric flora on the basis of standard microbiologic techniques. There are currently six techniques for identification of Stx-producing E. coli: biochemical markers with serotyping (most commonly used), serum antibody tests, cytotoxin bioassays, DNA hybridization, PCR-based tests and cytotoxin detection (including ELISAs). Some of these methods (e.g. toxin-based assays) detect the presence of cytotoxin-producing organisms, including non-O157 serotypes. It may be important to use both biochemical markers and toxin-based assays in clinical practice to identify these organisms. 216 Prevention of disease transmission is made difficult by the fact that these organisms colonize the intestine of healthy cattle and other food animals, including beef, pork, lamb and poultry. Therefore, they can survive and multiply in the food chain. Proper cooking destroys these organisms; in hamburgers, an internal cooking temperature of 71\u02daC (160\u02daF) renders the meat safe. Practically, safe cooking most commonly results in a gray hamburger (not pink), with clear juices. Risk can be lowered by educating consumers about cross-contamination, use of warning labels now affixed to meat in the USA and improvements in meat processing and microbial contamination detection.\n\nAt present there is no effective therapy to treat Stxproducing E. coli disease, so prevention is the most important strategy. Hemorrhagic colitis has been confused with a number of other conditions, including ischemic colitis, appendicitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, cecal polyp, pseudomembranous colitis and an acute abdomen (ileitis). Therefore, an important aspect of treatment of Stxassociated hemorrhagic colitis is making the correct diagnosis and avoiding unnecessary diagnostic studies such as angiography and laparotomy. The mainstay of therapy for hemorrhagic colitis is the management of dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities and gastrointestinal blood loss. Antimicrobial agents may help by killing the bacterial pathogens, but they may also cause harm by increasing the release and subsequent absorption of Shiga toxin. 217 Trials of antibiotic treatment of Stx-producing E. coli infection are inconclusive. Although these organisms are uniformly sensitive to antimicrobials in vitro, at present there is no convincing evidence that antimicrobial therapy is helpful in diminishing the severity of illness, shortening the duration of fecal excretion, or preventing HUS. 218, 219 Of greater concern is a study suggesting an increased incidence of HUS in those treated with anti-microbials. 220 An attempt to assimilate findings of published series on the subject via a meta-analysis failed to identify an increased risk of HUS in those treated with antimicrobials. 221 Regardless, until more data is available on this topic, most experts would agree that treatment of Stx-producing E. coli with antimicrobials is not advisable. 222 A multi-center trial failed to demonstrate an improved clinical course in pediatric patients treated with Shiga toxin-binding resin. 223 Other toxin neutralizing therapies are currently under investigation.\n\nEAggEc and DAEC were initially categorized as part of a larger group of enteroadherent E. coli. These strains differed from classical EPEC strains in that they did not showlocalized adherence in the Hep-2 cell assay. 224 The aggregative or 'stacked brick' appearance of EAggEC in this bioassay permitted epidemiological investigation and EAggEc were found to be associated with persistent diarrhea in developing counties. 185, 225 There was uncertainty about EAggEc pathogenicity because these organisms are found in apparently healthy individuals and because some epidemiologic studies failed to show an association with disease. 175, 226, 227 However, evidence from volunteer studies 228, 229 and outbreaks 230 has confirmed the pathogenicity of some EAggEC strains. Recent studies at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center have shown that EAggEC are an important unrecognized cause of acute infant diarrhea. 231 The mechanisms by which these organisms cause disease is thought to involve adherence to the intestinal mucosa, possibly in both the small and large intestine, followed by secretion of one or more enterotoxins and/or stimulation of IL-8 release by a flagellar protein. [232] [233] [234] DAEC are less well characterized but have also been associated with diarrheal disease. Both the HEp-2 cell assay and DNA probes have been used to identify these organisms, but these are not routinely available in the clinical microbiology laboratory.\n\nC. difficile is a gram-positive anaerobic bacillus. Disease caused by this organism can manifest in a variety of ways, ranging from asymptomatic carriage to potentially lifethreatening pseudomembranous colitis. This organism has been primarily, but not exclusively, associated with illness occurring after disruption of the normal intestinal flora by antibiotics.\n\nOf great interest in the study of C. difficile is the difference in the incidence of isolation of the organism and its toxin in various age groups. C. difficile toxin has been found in the feces of 10% of normal-term neonates and 55% of those in a neonatal intensive care unit. 235 Most infants found to have toxin in their stools are asymptomatic. A small group of toxin-positive infants have signs and symptoms of necrotizing enterocolitis, but no clear relation to C. difficile or its toxin has been demonstrated. The presence of C. difficile toxin in these asymptomatic infants may indicate the coexistence of some protective antitoxic substance 236 or may reflect a lack of appropriate toxin receptors in patients in this age group. 237 The incidence of C. difficile toxin positivity decreases beyond the neonatal period. The incidence of asymptomatic carriage in children older than 2 years of age approaches that in healthy adults (about 3%). Furthermore, not all of these organisms are toxin producers. Adults who develop disease from C. difficile infection are also more likely than children to experience severe colitis symptoms.\n\nC. difficile elaborates two important toxins. Toxin A probably mediates human disease; it is called an enterotoxin despite the fact that it causes cytotoxicity with hemorrhage and mucosal destruction in addition to having enterotoxic effects. Toxin A is a large protein (308 kD) that binds to an enterocyte surface receptor and activates an intracellular G protein-dependent signal transduction mechanism. 238 Bound toxin results in altered permeability, inhibition of protein synthesis and direct cytotoxicity. Toxin B is thought not to be an important mediator of human disease. However, this 'cytotoxin' is almost always found with toxin A and toxin B is the basis for the 'gold standard' cytotoxic tissue culture assay.\n\nC. difficile-related diarrhea almost always occurs in the setting of antimicrobial administration. Less commonly, the syndrome of pseudomembranous enterocolitis is seen after surgery (without antimicrobial agents) and after antineoplastic therapy. Any mucosal disease, including inflammatory bowel disease, is thought to be a risk factor, but only 1.7% of pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease were found to have C. difficile toxin in stool while in good control. 239 Hospitalization is a major risk factor for the acquisition of infection. Most patients experience mild, watery diarrhea that lasts only a few days and spontaneously resolves. In some patients, symptoms persist for weeks to months. Pseudomembranous colitis develops in a subset of patients. Patients with this disease are often extremely ill, with high fever, leukocytosis and hypoalbuminemia.\n\nC. difficile should be suspected in cases of colitis or mild diarrhea in which blood and leukocytes are noted in the stools. Concurrent or recent exposure (within several weeks) to antibiotics should increase the suspicion of C. difficile as the causative agent. The use of virtually any antibiotic may predispose to C. difficile disease.\n\nDiagnosis of C. difficile can be made by culture of the organism or by examination for the presence of toxin in feces. The 'gold standard' for laboratory detection of C. difficile toxin requires the use of a tissue culture system, with demonstration of a cytopathic effect that can be neutralized by specific antitoxin. However, this is less commonly used and other assays, including a rapid toxin ELISA assay, have sensitivities and specificities approaching those of the tissue culture system and can be interpreted within hours. However, correct identification of C. difficile disease in children may require use of both toxin A and toxin B ELISA. 240 Sigmoidoscopy in cases of pseudomembranous colitis typically reveals friable white exudate overlying multiple ulcerated areas. 241 The histologic findings of such lesions are depicted in Figure 36 .4. Less commonly, pseudomembranes may not be present in the rectosigmoid but may be present in the more proximal colon.\n\nIn cases of mild diarrheal illness caused by C. difficile, discontinuation of any antibiotics the patient is receiving may be sufficient therapy. In cases of severe illness and especially in cases of pseudomembranous colitis, treatment should also include oral vancomycin (5-10 mg/kg, max. 500 mg, per dose, given every 6 h for 7 days) or metron-idazole (5-10 mg/kg, max. 500 mg, per dose, given every 8 h for 7 days). 242 Compared with vancomycin, metronidazole is much less expensive, does not select for vancomycin-resistant organisms. and has similar efficacy.\n\nThere is a fairly high rate of relapse of illness, generally 15-20%, after treatment of C. difficile. These relapses usually occur within 1 month of completion of therapy and have been thought to result from the activation of C. difficile spores remaining from the primary infection. 243 Most of these cases of relapse are responsive to a second course of vancomycin or metronidazole or to repeated short courses of these drugs. There are reports of multiple relapses in which cholestyramine, given as a slurry (120 mg/kg per dose every 8 h) for 4 weeks and tapered over the following 3 weeks, was effective in eradication of the organism. 243 Intravenously administered gamma globulin is an alternative therapy for chronic C. difficile enterocolitis. 244 Lactobacillus GG has also been used successfully in a few pediatric patients with recurrent or persistent infection and Saccharomyces boulardii has been used effectively in adults. 245 \n\nWithin the past decade, several organisms not previously recognized as enteric pathogens have been linked to diarrheal disease. This includes organisms of the genus Aeromonas and the closely related bacterium Plesiomonas shigelloides (previously classified as Aeromonas shigelloides). These organisms are gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacilli classified in the family Vibrionaceae. They are oxidase-positive, differentiating them from members of the Enterobacteriaceae. 246 \n\nSeveral members of the genus Aeromonas, including Aeromonas hydrophila, are common inhabitants of fresh and brackish water in the USA. These organisms were ini-tially recognized as opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised hosts, especially those with malignant hematologic diseases. The organisms also have been known to cause disease in patients with underlying hepatobiliary disease. 246 Aeromonas has been isolated from healthy persons as well and has therefore been thought to be part of the normal flora. Despite initial studies that yielded conflicting results, 247 it is now generally accepted that A. hydrophila is an enteric pathogen.\n\nStudies in Australian children with diarrhea have found Aeromonas species present in 10% of patients. 248 Infection appears to occur most frequently in children younger than 2 years of age. 249 Of patients with Aeromonas isolated from stool cultures at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center approximately 50% were younger than 3 months. Aeromonas infection is also seasonal, occurring more often in the summer months. 246 Not all Aeromonas species are pathogenic. The method of pathogenesis remains unclear. Both cytotoxic 249 and enterotoxic 246 properties have been observed, but neither these nor other pathogenic mechanisms are found consistently in strains isolated from patients with Aeromonasassociated disease. 247 Aeromonas caviae, a commonly isolated species, demonstrates both adherence and cytotoxin production. 250 Clinical symptoms attributed to Aeromonas can be grouped into three categories: (1) acute watery diarrhea, the most common syndrome; (2) dysentery, which usually is self-limited; and (3) persistent watery diarrhea. Cramping abdominal pain and vomiting may also occur. 249 Symptoms may occasionally be severe and, especially when dysentery is present, have been incorrectly diagnosed as ulcerative colitis. 248 In mild cases of Aeromonas infection, supportive treatment should suffice. In patients who are immunocompromised, are otherwise acutely ill, or have persistent illness, treatment with antibiotics is recommended. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is usually effective (trimethoprim, 5 mg/kg, max. 160 mg, plus sulfamethoxazole, 25 mg/kg, max. 800 mg, per dose, given every 12 h for 14 days), as are tetracycline, chloramphenicol and the aminoglycosides. 246 Most strains of Aeromonas are resistant to the penicillins, including ampicillin. 246 Plesiomonas P. shigelloides, like Aeromonas, is commonly found in the environment, 251 especially in bodies of water, including water from a home aquarium. 252 Unlike Aeromonas, however, Plesiomonas has been reported to occur in epidemics, with contaminated water often found to be the cause. 251 Plesiomonas is also known to be spread through improperly cooked seafood. 253 The pathogenesis of disease caused by P. shigelloides is not well understood. A cytotoxin has been found in some strains 251 but not in others. An invasive mechanism is also suspected, because of the colitis symptoms. 253 In addition to small-volume stools with leukocytes and possible blood, patients may also experience severe abdominal pain. Fever has been seen in approximately one-third of patients. 253 In one group of adult patients, symptoms persisted longer than 2 weeks in 75% and longer than 4 weeks in 32%. 253 Diagnosis of P. shigelloides is made by stool culture. Although this illness is usually self-limited, treatment with antimicrobial agents has been shown to decrease the duration of symptoms, 253 with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or aminoglycosides suggested as appropriate choices. There are no controlled trials of antimicrobial treatment of gastroenteritis caused by this organism.\n\nMycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare, known collectively as Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare or Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), are acid-fast bacilli that have been recognized primarily for their role in cases of atypical tuberculosis. These organisms are now recognized as causative agents of diarrheal symptoms as well. In a review of pediatric cases of atypical mycobacterial infections, Lincoln and Gilbert 254 described two immunocompetent patients whose clinical findings included diarrhea and colonic ulceration.\n\nOf even greater significance than these sporadic cases of MAC infection in immunocompetent hosts is its occurrence among immunocompromised patients. In patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, MAC is among the most commonly isolated agents causing systemic bacterial infections. 255 These patients may also have chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain. 256, 257 MAC has also been noted to cause diarrhea in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation 258 and in a patient with cystic fibrosis. 259 The MAC organisms may be cultured from gastric and duodenal aspirates obtained endoscopically and from the stool, the bone marrow and the blood. 255 Endoscopic examination in patients with MAC may reveal findings similar to those seen in Whipple's disease, with minute superficial ulcerations in the small bowel. 257 Treatment of MAC infections with conventional antituberculosis agents usually is unsuccessful in eradicating the organisms or alleviating symptoms. 255 \n\nBacteroides fragilis is an anaerobic organism that is commonly isolated from normal stool flora. However, some investigators have identified a toxin-producing variant that is enteropathogenic. 260 Enterotoxigenic organisms have been isolated from both healthy persons and those with diarrhea. 261 Epidemiologic associations with diarrhea have been shown for enterotoxigenic B. fragilis in several studies [262] [263] [264] [265] but not others. 266 Additional investigation is required to fulfill Koch's postulates for this organism.\n\nIntestinal spirochetosis, or the colonization of the large bowel by Brachyspira aalborgi and related spirochetes, has recently been implicated as a cause of diarrhea. 267 Some studies have shown an association between this organism and bloody diarrhea, 268 although asymptomatic colonization has also been reported. 269 The potential of this organism to cause diarrhea requires further evaluation.\n\nThis organism has been associated with diarrhea in sporadic cases and in at least one hospital outbreak. Although a causal relation between Hafnia alvei and diarrhea has not been clearly established, a subset of this organism may be enteropathogenic. Organisms isolated from patients with diarrhea typically demonstrate the attaching and effacing lesion seen with EPEC, whereas non-pathogenic isolates do not show this characteristic. 270\n\nInvasive illness caused by Listeria is well known. An outbreak of Listeria gastroenteritis and fever without invasive disease was reported in persons who had consumed contaminated chocolate milk. 271 The importance of L. monocytogenes in outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by contaminated food has yet to be adequately determined.\n\nDespite this chapter's extensive catalog of both bacterial and viral infectious agents, from 20-40% of cases of diarrhea are currently not attributable to any known cause. Undoubtedly, as techniques for identification and culture become more sophisticated, other causative agents will be identified and the percentage of diarrheal illnesses described as idiopathic or nonspecific will continue to decline. Advances in the widespread use of improved oral rehydration solutions have led to a decline in the morbidity and mortality associated with diarrhea. Future advances in preventive measures, including vaccines, may lead to a reduction of the incidence of diarrheal disease."}
