{"title": "In vitro susceptibility of 10 clinical isolates of SARS coronavirus to selected antiviral compounds", "body": "Although the SARS epidemic has been successfully contained with quarantine and infection control measures, the presence of this virus in wild game food animals , stocks in laboratories and possible seasonality of this disease suggest that recurrence of such an epidemic is not unlikely in the coming winters. Since all age groups are affected and a high fatality is noted in the elderly and those with co-morbidities (Donnelly et al., 2003) , there is an urgent need to find a cure. Prospective clinical and viral load studies in nasopharyngeal secretions from SARS patients showed that viral replication peaked at the 10th day after the onset of symptoms with subsequent clinical deterioration in 30% of the cases despite a decreasing viral load (Peiris et al., 2003) . Therefore the key facet of management should include respiratory support, immuno-modulation in selected cases and early institution of an effective antiviral agent. Such an antiviral agent, if given early, may decrease the peak viral load and the associated immuno-dysregulatory damage. At the moment, there are no commercially available antiviral agents tailored-made for SARS coronavirus. There is an urgent need to search for an agent with a known in use clinical and toxicity profile so that a randomised placebo control trial can be conducted if the epidemic recurs in one of the coming winters. We report in this study on the in vitro antiviral susceptibility of 10 isolates of SARS coronavirus to commercially available antiviral agents and pure chemical compounds including baicalin, glycyrrhizin, and chlorogenic acid extracted from traditional Chinese herbs.\n\nTen isolates of SARS coronavirus from 10 different SARS patients who satisfied the revised WHO criteria for SARS are listed in Table 1 . The drugs used for antiviral susceptibility specialists to draw up a \"technical scheme (tentative) for the prevention and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) using traditional Chinese medicine\". In the scheme, a recipe \"Qing Fei Jie Du Tang\" (soup for clearing the lung and detoxification) was recommended which consists of Huang Qi (Astragalus membranaceus) 15 gm, Chai Hu (Bupleurum chinense) 10 gm, Ma Huang (Ephedra sinica) 5 gm, Xing Ren (Prunus armeniaca) 10 gm, Sheng She Gao (Plaster Stone) 30 gm, Sheng Yi Ren (Coix lacryma-jobi) 15 gm, Gua Wei Pi (Benincasa hispida) 15 gm, Jie Geng (Platycodon grandiflorum) 9 gm, Bo He (Mentha haplocalyx) 6 gm, Huang Qin (Scutellaria baicalensis) 10 gm, Sheng Gan Cao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis) 5 gm, Jin Yin Hua (Flos lonicerae) 15 gm, and Qing Hao (Artemisia apiacea) 15 gm. Among them, only Scutellaria baicalensis, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Flos lonicerae and Artemisia apiacea have their pure chemically defined ingredients being extracted, purified and documented to have antimicrobial activities. Consequently, the main bioactive compounds, namely, baicalin (derived from Scutellaria baicalensis), glycyrrhizin (from Glycyrrhiza uralensis), chlorogenic acid (from Flos lonicerae) and artesunate (from Artemisia apiacea) were investigated in the present study.\n\nThe pharmacological properties of baicalin, glycyrrhizin, and chlorogenic acid are summarized in Table 2 . Artesunate is not included in this table since it is already well known as an anti-malarial drug in Western Medicine (Price, 2000) . They were extracted as we have previously reported (Lu et al., 2003) . The concentrations of baicalin, glycyrrhizin, No glycyrrhizin in plasma is found after oral administration of 100 mg glycyrrhizin in healthy persons, presumably glycyrrhizin is metabolized to glycyrrhetinic acid by intestinal bacteria which contain \u2424-d-glucuronidase or the amount consumed is too little\n\nOnly traces expected (1000 mg per person, in human); this may be due also to that the amount consumed is much lower than that for animals Standard doses in oral administration in humans \u223c1500 mg baicalin (as tablets); also can be up to \u223c6000 mg baicalin (calculated from herb, assuming 30 g herb used; the herb may contain up to 20% as baicalin)\n\n\u223c300 mg glycyrrhizin (as tablets) or \u223c1700 mg glycyrrhizin (calculated from the herb assuming that the herb contains 5.65% glycyrrhizin)\n\n\u223c2220 mg (calculated from the herb assuming that the herb contains 7.4% chlorogenic acid)\n\nSerum level (after intravenous administration) chlorogenic acid, and lopinavir in the cell culture system were also monitored by HPLC (Lu et al., 2003) whereas the concentration of others were monitored by neutralization assays with the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Indiana strain and a laboratory strain of Influenza A H1N1.The procedures used for in vitro antiviral susceptibility testing are as follows. Initial screening of all compounds against the prototype SARS coronavirus strain no. 39849 was performed in 96-well microtitre plates seeded with foetal rhesus kidney-4 cells. Two-fold dilutions of antiviral agents starting from more than four times the peak serum concentration after the maximum therapeutic dose to less than one-quarter of the trough serum concentration were tested in quadruplicate against 100 TCID 50 of SARS coronavirus. A corresponding set of cell controls with drug but without virus inoculation was used as controls for drug toxicity. The cells were scored for the inhibition of the cytopathic effect (CPE) at 48 and 72 h. Those compounds with demonstrable in vitro inhibitory activity were re-assayed against the other nine strains of SARS coronavirus collected from different patients from different hospitals of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Their antiviral activities were also compared in both foetal rhesus kidney-4 (fRHK-4) and Vero-E6 cell lines. Those likely to have clinically significant inhibitory activity were tested by the plaque reduction assay. For selected agents with consistent activity in the plaque reduction assay, checkerboard assays for synergy were per-formed for combinations of interferons and ribavirin using the same neutralization test in 96 well microtiter plates seeded with Vero cell line. Cells were not incubated with the interferons before viral inoculation. Vero cells were used instead of Vero E6 and fRhK-4 cell lines because better antiviral effect can be demonstrated in Vero but less so in the other two cell lines for ribavirin and the interferons.\n\nTen isolates of SARS coronavirus from 10 different patients with SARS admitted to different hospitals in HK-SAR showing seroconversion towards the prototype virus infected fRhK-4 cell line were used in this study (Table 1) . They were isolated from the lung tissue biopsy (prototype virus, M39849), urine, and nasopharyngeal aspirates. Initial screening of 20 commercially available antimicrobial agents against the prototype virus grown in fRhK-4 cell line did not reveal inhibitory activities for acyclovir, ganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet, interferon-alpha-2a, interferon-alpha-2b, amantadine, zidovudine, stavudine, nevirapine, abacavir, and ritonavir. Inhibitory activities were not detectable for glycyrrhizin, artesunate and chlorogenic acid in fRhK-4 cell line. Glycyrrhizin was still included for further testing because this was reported to be active in Vero-E6 cell lines (Cinatl et al., 2003a) . Further testing by neutralization tests Table 3 Comparison of antiviral activity of 10 compounds against 10 strains of SARS-CoV in fRhK4 cell line, against the prototype strains (39849) with the other 9 isolates of SARS coronavirus against the active compounds confirmed detectable inhibitory activities for leukocytic interferon-alpha, interferon-beta-1a, ribavirin, lopinavir, rimantadine, and baicalin. The range of their effective concentration of compound required to reduce the plaque forming unit by 50% (EC 50 ) at 48 and 72 h, and their selectivity index are shown in Table 3 .\n\nWhen the same neutralization test on these compounds was run in Vero-E6 cell line, rimandatine, glycyrrhizin, leukocytic interferon-alpha and interferon-beta were more active especially at 72 h. Moreover, pre-incubation of the cell lines with these two interferons for 16 h before adding the virus markedly enhanced the inhibitory activity by three to over 100-fold. But ribavirin, lopinavir, and baicalin were less active in the Vero-E6 cell line (Table 3) .\n\nAs for the plaque reduction assay, Vero cell lines were used instead of Vero E6 or fRhK-4 cell lines because antiviral activity can be demonstrated for most of the agents. Only interferon-beta-1a, leukocytic interferon-alpha, lopinavir, ribavirin, rimantadine, and baicalin were tested. The EC 50 of interferon-beta-1a (8 U/ml), leukocytic interferon-alpha (30 U/ml), lopinavir (6 g/ml), ribavirin (50 g/ml), rimantadine (7 g/ml), and baicalin (11 g/ml) are comparable to the results obtained from CPE assays.\n\nTests for synergism between ribavirin and lopinavir have already been reported (Chu et al., 2004) . No synergism could be demonstrated between rimantadine and ribavirin. The most active compounds are the interferons. Thus further checkerboard assays were performed with combinations of leukocytic interferon-alpha or interferon-beta-1a, and ribavirin. Marked synergism was seen at both 72 and 96 h. The combination of leukocytic interferon-alpha (78 g/ml) and ribavirin (25 g/ml) or interferon-beta-1a (312.5 g/ml) and ribavirin (25 g/ml) were shown to be active at 96 h of incubation (Table 4) .\n\nControl of SARS may be achieved by epidemiological measures, antiviral prophylaxis or treatment, and vaccination. During the last pandemic of SARS, the only available means for control were public health measures such as isolation of suspected cases, quarantine of contacts, and personal protective infection control procedures for high-risk individuals such as health care workers. There is an urgent need to find effective antiviral agents with acceptable side effect profiles. In developing countries such as China, commercially available western antiviral medicine is unlikely to be affordable by most people. Moreover, the SARS mortality of Mainland China was only 7% comparing favourably with the 15% to 27% of other areas (WHO, 2003) . China \n\nis also the only place where traditional Chinese medicinal herbs were extensively used for treatment of SARS. The development of vaccine will take a much longer time. Therefore, we undertook these antiviral susceptibility tests for all commercially available antiviral agents in the HKSAR and pure chemicals purified from traditional Chinese herbs known to have antimicrobial activity. These chosen herbs were included in a standard formula used for the treatment of SARS in China and the HKSAR.\n\nOnly interferon-beta and glycyrrhizin were reported to have significant antiviral activity against SARS coronavirus (Cinatl et al., 2003a,b) . Using the fRhK-4 cell line, we have shown that ribavirin, rimantadine, lopinavir, and baicalin also have detectable antiviral activities. However, like the interferons and glycyrrhizin, their activities tend to decrease with incubation beyond 48 h (Table 3) . Judging from the achievable serum levels with standard oral or parenteral dosing, rimantadine, ribavirin, glycyrrhizin, and even the two interferons are unlikely to have clinically significant in vivo activities. Moreover, lopinavir, and rimantadine have a relatively inferior selectivity index of 4 to 32. Upon subsequent testing with Vero-E6 cell line, both leukocytic interferon-alpha and interferon-beta-1a were more active and especially after pre-incubation for 16 h before viral inoculation. The findings suggest that prophylaxis with the interferons should be considered. Though ribavirin was much less active in the Vero cell line, it is highly synergistic with either two interferons. Therefore, a combination of ribavirin with either of these two interferons should be considered for the treatment of SARS.\n\nInterferon-gamma was reported not to possess antiviral activity against SARS coronavirus (Cinatl et al., 2003b) , whereas interferon-beta was confirmed to be active in this study. What is interesting was the demonstration of activity of leukocytic interferon-alpha despite the lack of activity of the recombinant interferon-alpha-2a and interferon-alpha-2b. This was not unexpected because this preparation of leukocytic interferon-alpha is a multi-subtype natural interferon with predominantly interferon alpha-1 and alpha-2 in contrast to the other commercial preparation with a single subtype of recombinant interferon-alpha-2. In in vitro studies, different subtypes have been found to have different antiviral activities as well as immunological effects (Foster et al., 1996) . It was also demonstrated that leukocytic interferon-alpha had a superior antiviral effect than that of recombinant interferon on Human immunodeficiency Virus infection (Fan et al., 1993) .\n\nIt is important to know that in vitro findings may not correspond with clinical efficacy. Despite its in vitro activity, topical or systemic interferon-alpha did not produce a consistent reduction in symptoms or lesion duration of genital herpes (Eron et al., 1987; Lebwohl et al., 1992) . And interferon-alpha was not effective in preventing CMV infections or treating CMV pneumonia in bone marrow transplant patients (Meyers et al., 1980) . Despite its broad-spectrum antiviral activities against respiratory viruses in vitro, prophylactic intranasal interferon-alpha is only protective against rhinovirus-induced common cold under natural condition (Douglas et al., 1986) . This was unexpected because intranasal leucocyte or recombinant interferon-alpha protect against experimental human infection by rhinovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (Hayden and Gwaltney, 1984; Higgins et al., 1983; Higgins et al., 1990) .\n\nBesides the high cost of interferons, the high incidence of fever and flu syndrome of up to 98% during its initial phase of administration may pose confusions in terms of the response to treatment. The well-known side effect of pancytopenia may also be confused with markers of SARS activity such as a decrease in platelets and occasionally neutrophils (Raanani and Ben-Bassat, 2002) . Although interstitial pneumonitis and bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia are rare complications of prolonged use of interferons (Karim et al., 2001; Ogata et al., 1994) , there is always a fear that their proinflammatory effect may worsen the viral pneumonitis caused by SARS.\n\nAs for the less expensive option, baicalin but not glycyrrhizin may be considered if traditional Chinese medicine is to be used for antiviral prophylaxis or treatment. The serum level after 100 mg of glycyrrhizin orally was not detectable. Even with a 200 mg dose of intravenous administration, the peak serum level is only 80 g/ml which is still below the EC 50 of glycyrrhizin. Although an oral dose of 1.5 gm of baicalin can only achieve a serum concentration of 0.47 g/ml, intravenous administration of a 360 mg dose of baicalin in human can achieve a peak serum concentration of 74 g/ml. Thus intravenous baicalin should be con-sidered for treatment in randomised placebo control trials in developing countries where such formulations are available and affordable. Baicalin was shown to inhibit HIV-1 by two mechanisms (Kitamura et al., 1998; Li et al., 2000) . At the level of cellular entry, baicalin can conjugate with selected chemokines such as MIP-1\u2424 and SDF-1\u2423, and interfere with their capacity to activate cellular receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 respectively. These two co-recpetors are essential elements for HIV-1 infection and therefore baicalin can inhibit Env-protein mediated fusion of HIV with cells expressing CD4/CCR5 or CD4/CXCR4. Baicalin has also been known to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase probably by interfering with the binding of viral RNA to the RT molecule near the active site of the enzyme.\n\nIn terms of prophylaxis against SARS short of an effective vaccine, intranasal leukocytic interferon-alpha or interferon-beta-1a are likely to be effective. However the local side effect of nasal irritation can decrease compliance. It could also be considered for randomised placebo-control trials.\n\nAs for the antiviral treatment of symptomatic SARS, it is important to have a rapid and reliable diagnostic test since early institution of antiviral therapy is important to decrease the peak viral load . Interferon-beta-1a or leukocytic interferon-alpha plus ribavirin appear to be the most effective combination. Since interferons may not be effective in inducing an antiviral state in the uninfected host cells during the first 24 h, a combination with a short course of ribavirin appears to be reasonable. This will also reduce the side effects and fluid volume associated with a full course of ribavirin. Despite the superiority of interferons in the in vitro assays, there is little clinical data of its use in the treatment of acute viral respiratory infection in human. Thus the combination of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir should still be considered since some positive clinical data has already been accumulated in a historical controlled treatment trial (Chu et al., 2004) ."}
