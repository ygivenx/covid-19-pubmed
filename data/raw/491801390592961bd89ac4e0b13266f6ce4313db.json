{"title": "HTCC as a highly effective polymeric inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV 2 3", "body": "Coronaviruses mainly cause respiratory and enteric diseases in humans, other mammals, 50 and birds. However, some species can cause more severe conditions such as hepatitis, 51 peritonitis, or neurological disease. Seven coronaviruses infect humans, four of which (human pangolins were suggested as such 9 . The virus is associated with a respiratory illness that, in a 63 proportion of cases, is severe. The mortality rate varies between locations, but at present, is 64 estimated to reach 3-4% globally. The virus infects primarily ciliated cells and type II severity varying from asymptomatic to potentially fatal acute respiratory distress [14] [15] [16] . To date, 74 MERS-CoV infection was confirmed in 27 countries, with over 2,000 cases and a mortality rate 75 of ~35%. 76 Currently, there are no vaccines or drugs with proven efficacy to treat coronavirus 77 infection, and treatment is limited to supportive care. However, a range of therapeutics have Consequently, broad-spectrum antivirals are essential in long-term perspective. we dissected the mechanism of the HTCC antiviral activity. We showed that the polymer 96 interacts with the coronaviral Spike (S) protein and blocks its interaction with the cellular 97 receptor 22-24 . Here, we analyzed the HTCC activity against SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in 98 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Overall, our 100 data show that HTCC polymers are potent broad-spectrum anticoronavirals and may be very 101 promising drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. 105 Previously, we showed that HTCC with different degrees of substitution (DSs) is a The study on the MERS-CoV using the Vero cells revealed that all HTCC variants 117 inhibit virus replication to a similar extent (~100-1000-time decrease in viral yields), at non-118 toxic concentration (Figure 1A, C) . The inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 119 cells was even more pronounced, and all HTCC variants inhibited virus replication by ~10,000 120 times at non-toxic concentration (Figure 1B, C) . In this case, the HTCC-63 was arbitrarily 121 selected for further studies on MERS-CoV, while HTCC-77 was selected for SARS-CoV-2. 122 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The inhibitory activity of selected 134 polymers was verified for three different concentrations, and obtained data are shown in Figure   135 2. \n\nBased on the data obtained, the basic parameters were calculated and are presented in Table 1 . The parameters observed for the SARS-CoV-2 appear to be favorable with SI above 12. It is 148 also worth to note that HTCC was previously administered by inhalation in rats, and no adverse 149 reactions were observed 25 . In that study, HTCC was used as a carrier for the active substance, 150 and as such, was reported to be promising for local sustained inhalation therapy of pulmonary 151 diseases.\n\n152 author/funder.

We believe that the HTCC can be fine-tuned to target any 241 coronavirus, and this interaction is specific to viruses that belong to the Coronaviridae family. \n\nThe active compound 257 The HTCC was prepared in the same manner as previously described 22,23,28 .
