{"title": "Porcine IL-12 plasmid as an adjuvant improves the cellular and humoral immune\nresponses of DNA vaccine targeting transmissible gastroenteritis virus spike gene in a\nmouse model", "body": "The full-length S gene of TGEV strain PUR46 (GenBank: M94101.1) was used as a polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR) template. PCR for TGEV S1 gene amplification was performed using the\nforward primer (P1) (5\u2032-GGGGAAGCTTATGAAAAAACTATTTGTG-3\u2032) and\nreverse primer (P2) (5\u2032-CCCCGAATTCTTAGTTAGTTTGTCTAATA-3\u2032) carrying\na HindIII (P1) and an EcoRI (P2) restriction enzyme site\n(underlined), respectively. The PCR parameters for TGEV-S1 gene amplification (primers\nP1/P2) were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 45.7\u00b0C for 1 min, and\n72\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Products were purified\nand subjected to restriction enzyme digestion, followed by ligation into the appropriate\npVAX1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) eukaryotic expression vector. A recombinant\nplasmid expressing the entire pIL-12, comprising p40 and p35 genes, was constructed by\noverlap extension PCR. The plasmid was previously constructed in our laboratory [13]. Clones were picked and identified by PCR\namplification, and then named as pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(pIL-12).\n\nAll assays were performed using the previously described methods [13, 19] with some modifications.\npVAX1-(TGEV-S1), pVAX1-(pIL-12), and pVAX1 were resuspended in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS) at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/\u00b5l, and 1\n\u00b5l of each plasmid was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)\ninto BHK-21 cells at about 90% confluence. The cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C for about 24\nhr, fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and incubated with anti-TGEV-S1 or anti-pIL-12\n(p40) antibody (1:200 diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin [BSA]). The samples were\nincubated in the dark with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled secondary antibody\n(1:200 dilution with 1% BSA). The green fluorescence signals were detected using a\nfluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).\n\nSix-week-old Kunming mice (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute) were divided into six\ngroups (Table 1) and injected with 50 \u00b5l 0.8% lidocaine hydrochloride (27\ngauge needles) in the medial vastus muscle. After 15 min, the mice were immunized with 100\n\u00b5g of pVAX1-(TGEV-S1), pVAX1-(pIL-12), pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus\npVAX1-(pIL-12) (100 \u00b5g each), inactivated TGEV vaccine (vaccine control\ngroup; produced by Chengdu TECBOND Biological Products Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China), pVAX1\n(empty vector control), or PBS (no treatment control). A total of three doses of\nimmunization were given to each mouse from all groups at 2-week intervals. Four mice per\ngroup were euthanized at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days after first immunization. Serum\nsamples were collected, and mononuclear cells (MCs) were isolated from the blood and\nspleen of the euthanized animals [12]. The animal\nstudy was performed in compliance with institutional guidelines and animal welfare. All\nanimal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Northeast Agricultural\nUniversity.\n\nLymphocytes were collected from the peripheral blood or spleen of the experimental\nanimals, and lymphocyte proliferation assays were performed using isolated MCs from the\nblood and spleen, as previously described [5, 10, 27]. The MCs\nwere diluted to 105 cells/50 \u00b5l Roswell Park Memorial\nInstitute (RPMI)-1640 medium (Gibco, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) and added to each well of\n96-well plates. Concanavalin A (Sigma, Munich, Germany) and purified recombinant TGEV-S1\nprotein (20 \u00b5g/ml) were added as stimulating agents for\n72 hr. The cells were treated with methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT, 10\n\u00b5l/well) for 4 hr and the reaction was terminated with dimethyl\nsulfoxide (DMSO). The viability of cells was calculated by reading the absorbance at 490\nnm wavelength.\n\nPeripheral blood MCs (PBMCs) and splenic MCs (SMCs) were resuspended at 1 \u00d7\n107 cells/ml and incubated with either phycoerythrin\n(PE)-labeled anti-porcine CD8+ or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled\nanti-porcine CD4+ antibodies (1:1,000 diluted in PBS; Zhongshan, Guangdong,\nChina). The frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ cells were quantified with\nflow cytometric analysis (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, U.S.A.).\n\nThe TGEV-specific antibody from the serum of vaccinated mice was detected with an\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recombinant TGEV S1 protein (50\n\u00b5g/ml diluted with 0.05 M sodium bicarbonate\n[NaHCO3]) [18]. The absorbance was\ndetected at 490 nm wavelength.\n\nTo determine the efficacy of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies from the serum of vaccinated\nmice [21], mouse sera (1:10 doubling dilution) were\ndiluted with a diluent (200 \u00b5l) of TGEV (3.16 \u00d7 106\nTCID50/ml) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. Swine testis (ST) cells were\ninoculated with the pretreated viruses in 24-well plates (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2), and\nthe TGEV-specific cytopathic effects were observed at 48\u201360 hr post-infection. Based on\nthe cytopathic effect (CPE) of the control, the inhibition rate (%) of TGEV focus-forming\nunit (FFU) were calculated as follows: [1\u2212(FFU in the test serum/FFU in negative control\nserum) \u00d7 100]. The neutralizing antibody titer was the serum dilution corresponding to a\nTGEV inhibition rate of 50% and was calculated with the Reed-Muench method as follows:\n[10^{logarithm of serum dilution (inhibition rate <50%)\u2212(inhibition rate\n(>50%)\u221250%)/(inhibition rate (>50%)\u2212inhibition rate (<50%)) \u00d7 (logarithm of serum\ndilution (inhibition rate <50%)\u2212logarithm of serum dilution (inhibition rate\n>50%))}].\n\nInterferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and IL-4 test kits (ExCell Bio., Shanghai, China) were used for\ndetecting cytokine expression levels, as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions [6, 9]. To obtain a\nstandard curve, the standard solution of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 were diluted from 2,000 to 31.3\npg/ml and 500 to 7.8\npg/ml, respectively. The standard solutions and serum\nsamples were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C on ELISA plates. The serum (1:100) from 42 days\npost-immunization (dpi) mice was used to evaluate IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 responses. Horseradish\nperoxidase-labeled goat-anti mouse immunoglobulin (IgG, 1:2,000) was added to each well,\nand IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 levels were detected at 490 nm wavelength. The concentrations of IFN-\u03b3\nand IL-4 in the serum were determined according to the standard curve.\n\nA lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) test kit was used to analyze cytotoxicity. The test was\nconducted according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Jiancheng, Nanjing, Jiangsu,\nChina). The effector cells were obtained from the blood and spleen lymphocytes of 42 dpi\nmice [4, 8],\nand the target ST cells were infected with TGEV (70 PFU) for 36 hr (37\u00b0C, 5%\nCO2). The effector cells and target cells were mixed at a proportion of 25:1\nand incubated in wells of 96-well plates for 6 hr (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2). The\nsupernatants (100 \u00b5l) were mixed with LDH assay reagent (100\n\u00b5l/well) for 15 min (37\u00b0C) in 96-well plates and the results were\nanalyzed at 490 nm wavelength. The maximum release of LDH was that the total of target\ncells were dissolved in Triton X-100 (1% v/v), and the spontaneous LDH release was that\nthe target cells exist single. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were calculated as\n([experimental release\u2212spontaneous release]/[maximum release\u2212spontaneous release]) \u00d7100%\n[3]. All detections were performed in\ntriplicates.\n\nAll analyzes were performed using SPSS V13.0 software; P<0.01 and\nP<0.05 were defined as statistically very significant and\nsignificant, respectively. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparison\nstatistical test were also used.\n\nThe sequences of pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(pIL-12) were analyzed from GenBank, and the\nresults of nucleotide sequence comparison revealed 100 and 99.8% similarity with the\nstrain accession numbers M94101 (PUR46-MAD) (S1) and NM_214013.1 (pIL-12), respectively.\nThe pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(pIL-12) plasmids were successfully transfected and\nexpressed in BHK-21 cells, as indicated from the results of the immunofluorescence assay\n(Fig. 1).\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2A, T lymphocyte proliferation was significantly upregulated at 14, 28, and 42 dpi in\npVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) groups compared to that in the\ncontrol groups (P<0.01). At 14 and 28 dpi, the pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus\npVAX1-(pIL-12) group showed a significant upregulation in T lymphocyte proliferation level\nas compared with the groups treated with the other construct\n(P<0.01).\n\nThe proliferation of spleen T lymphocytes is shown in Fig. 2B. At 28 dpi, the pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) group showed much\nhigher upregulation than any other groups (P<0.01). At 14 and 42 dpi,\npVAX1-(TGEV-S1) group also showed a significant upregulation (P<0.01)\nin spleen T lymphocyte proliferation as compared to the control groups.\n\nChanges in the frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in the blood and\nspleen from experimental animals were evaluated using flow cytometry. The number of\nCD4+ and CD8+ cells in the peripheral blood is shown in Fig. 2C. The number of CD8+ cells in the\npVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) group was significantly higher\n(P<0.01) than that in the other groups at 14 and 28 dpi. The number of\nCD4+ cells in the peripheral blood at 28 dpi was significantly higher\n(P<0.01) in pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12)\ngroups than in the control groups. A similar trend was observed in the number of\nCD4+ and CD8+ cells in the spleen, as shown in Fig. 2D. At 28 dpi, the pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus\npVAX1-(pIL-12) group had significantly higher (P<0.01) number of\nCD4+ and CD8+ cells than other groups.\n\nThe levels of TGEV-specific antibodies in the serum of immunized mice were examined using\nan indirect ELISA (Fig. 3A). In general, starting from 21 dpi, the pVAX1-(TGEV-S1), pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus\npVAX1-(pIL-12), and vaccine-treated groups had a higher proportion of antibodies than the\ncontrol groups (P<0.01). Antibody production reached its peak at 35\ndpi. The pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) group induced higher IgG response than other\ngroups except the vaccine group.\n\nVirus neutralizing assay results revealed the levels of neutralizing antibodies in the\nserum of immunized mice. pVAX1-(TGEV-S1), pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12), and\ninactivated vaccine groups showed better antibody production than the control groups\n(P<0.01). The serum inhibition rates of TGEV FFU were higher for\npVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) and vaccine groups than for other groups at any serum\ndilution (Fig. 3B). The titer of neutralizing\nantibody was 1:35, 1:75, and 1:195 for pVAX1-(TGEV-S1), pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus\npVAX1-(pIL-12), and inactivated vaccine groups, respectively.\n\nIFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 levels in different sera were analyzed with ELISA. As shown in Table 1, IFN-\u03b3 production was 1,222.32 \u00b1 129.37\npg/ml for pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) group, while IL-4 level was\n956.84 \u00b1 122.06 pg/ml for pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus\npVAX1-(pIL-12) group, which were significantly different from those reported for the\ncontrol group (P<0.01). The concentration of IL-4 in pVAX1-(TGEV-S1)\nimmunized groups was higher than that in other groups except pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus\npVAX1-(pIL-12) group. The inactivated vaccine failed to induce IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4\nproduction.\n\nEvaluation of the activity of CTLs was performed with the LDH release assay. Figure 3C shows that the CTL activities in the\nspleen and peripheral blood of the mice treated with pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(TGEV-S1)\nplus pVAX1-(pIL-12) were significantly different from activities in the spleen and\nperipheral blood of the mice from control groups (P<0.01). The\npVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) group showed the highest activity of CTLs both in the\nblood and spleen.\n\nThe S protein of TGEV near the N terminal portion (S1) has four antigenic epitopes [26]. Researchers have reported that the S1 gene could\ninduce better immune responses than the full-length TGEV S gene in mice [24]. Furthermore, the cytokine IL-12 could not only\ninitiate the proliferation of active T cells but also increase the activity of CTLs and\nnatural killer cells [15, 22]. IL-12 has been widely used as an immunological adjuvant in nucleic\nacid vaccine research [3, 17, 23]. DNA vaccines are safer\nand more effective than traditional vaccines [25].\nHerein, we assessed the influence of IL-12 as an immunological adjuvant in combination with\na nucleic acid vaccine comprising the TGEV S gene.\n\nT lymphocytes are significant effectors of the immune response and are vital for the\nactivation of T helper cells (Th), cytotoxic T cells (Tc), and effector T cells (Te) among\nothers. These cells participate and induce cellular and humoral immune responses within most\norganisms. In the present study, T lymphocytes showed a significant change, and\nCD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes significantly increased in the blood and\nspleen of mice from pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) group; a significant difference was\nobserved compared to other groups. These cells reflect the proliferation of lymphocytes\nstimulated with antigens at 14 and 28 dpi. Thus, these plasmids could stimulate the cellular\nimmunity, while pIL-12 exerted a promotional effect. However, all groups showed a decrease\nin immune response at 42 dpi; this observation indicates that the animals were entering\nexhaustion or that the immune effect had worn-off in the absence of stimulation.\n\nTh cells can differentiate into Th1 and Th2 through the secretion of different cytokines.\nTh1 cells are mostly influenced by IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 and regulate cellular immune responses,\nwhile Th2 cells are mainly controlled by IL-10 and IL-4 and activate the humoral immune\nresponses. The analyzes of specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies revealed that\npVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) and inactivated vaccine had similar effects on humoral\nimmune response and developed a much stronger response than other treatments, including\npVAX1-(TGEV-S1). The high titer of neutralizing antibody observed in the inactivated vaccine\ngroup was due to its more complex components. Interestingly, the pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and\npVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) immunized groups had different IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 responses,\nsuggesting that they activate different arms of the immune system [29].\n\nCTLs directly destroy infected cells, and recognize the major histocompatibility complex\nI/antigen complexes. CTLs lyse target cells through the release of cytolytic granules, and\nthe surfaces of these cells express the Fas ligand [7]. CTL activity is assessed using the change in LDH levels [4, 8]. CTLs and neutralizing\nantibodies directly act on viruses and protect the host from viral infection [25]. In the present study, pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) combined with\npVAX1-(pIL-12) exerted positive effects on the activation of CTLs both in the blood and\nspleen and showed a marked advantage over pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) alone, especially in the\nperipheral blood.\n\nIn summary, we report that pIL-12 could act as an immunological adjuvant in the DNA vaccine\nfor TGEV-S1. DNA vaccine developed using TGEV-S1 and pIL-12 could induce excellent\nactivation of both the humoral and cellular immune responses. This study may provide a\nuseful strategy to develop DNA vaccines for the prevention of TGEV in swine. The next step\nwill be to assess its activity in a porcine model.\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest."}
