{"title": "Parallel evolution of influenza across multiple spatiotemporal scales", "body": "Viruses rapidly acquire de novo mutations as they replicate within infected hosts (Andino and Domingo, 2015), but only a small fraction of these variants transmit between hosts and eventually fix on a global scale. Within hosts, a mutation\u2019s impact on viral replication and immunogenicity affect whether it increases in frequency. At larger scales of space and time, transmission bottlenecks (Varble et al., 2014; Poon et al., 2016) and host heterogeneity also shape viral genetic diversity. The selective pressures at these various scales reflect complex molecular, immunological, and epidemiological constraints (Grenfell et al., 2004; Pybus and Rambaut, 2009; Luksza and L\u00e4ssig, 2014; Neher et al., 2016), which have formed the basis of recent efforts to forecast influenza evolution (Luksza and L\u00e4ssig, 2014; Neher et al., 2016, Neher et al., 2014; L\u00e4ssig et al., 2017).\n\nInfluenza\u2019s rapid global evolution has been the subject of intense study (Ghedin et al., 2005; Rambaut et al., 2008), but the origins of this variation within single infected hosts are still poorly understood. Recent deep-sequencing studies of human clinical samples suggest that influenza accumulates relatively limited genetic diversity within hosts during most acute infections (Dinis et al., 2016; Poon et al., 2016; Sobel Leonard et al., 2016; Debbink et al., 2017), in line with earlier studies in dogs and horses (Murcia et al., 2010; Hoelzer et al., 2010). Some within-host mutations may confer novel antigenic properties (Dinis et al., 2016), but most lack clear functional interpretation. Altogether, it remains unclear how influenza\u2019s within-host diversity is transformed into global evolution.\n\nInfluenza infections usually last less than a week and provide limited opportunity for longitudinal study. But among some immunocompromised patients, infections can last weeks or months (Nichols et al., 2004; Memoli et al., 2014), making it possible to examine longer-term within-host evolutionary dynamics (Rocha et al., 1991; McMinn et al., 1999; Rogers et al., 2015). Here, we use deep-sequencing to characterize the evolutionary dynamics of influenza within immunocompromised hosts. We identify a small set of mutations that arise repeatedly within individual patients, across multiple patients in our study, and at the global scale, revealing surprising similarities in evolutionary dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales.\n\nWe deep-sequenced 37 viral samples collected longitudinally from four immunocompromised patients with long-term H3N2 influenza infections in the 2005\u20132006 and 2006\u20132007 seasons (Figure 1). These patients developed influenza infections in the months after receiving hematopoietic cell transplantations when immune cell counts were still low, and nasal wash samples were collected approximately every week. All patients were treated with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir for at least some duration of their infections (Campbell et al., 2015) (Figure 1, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1).\n\nWe sequenced the full viral genome to high coverage directly from patient nasal wash samples by using influenza-specific reverse transcription and PCR (Hoffmann et al., 2001) to enrich for viral genetic material (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1). To limit the impact of library preparation and sequencing errors on estimates of variant frequency (McCrone and Lauring, 2016), we prepared sequencing libraries in duplicate for each sample, beginning from separate reverse-transcription reactions. We excluded from downstream analyses eight low-quality samples for which sequencing coverage was low or variant frequencies differed greatly between replicates (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1).\n\nAcross the influenza genome, de novo mutations arise most commonly in the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) (Figure 2A), which undergo rapid global evolution (Bhatt et al., 2011). These mutations fluctuate in frequency but rarely fix, showing that complex evolutionary dynamics can emerge within single infected individuals (Figure 2B, Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2\u20135). We focused on within-host mutations that reached a frequency of at least 5% in two independent sequencing replicates from any patient sample. Many nonsynonymous mutations occur at sites that affect the antigenicity of HA (Koel et al., 2013) and the antiviral sensitivity of NA (Baz et al., 2006; van der Vries et al., 2013) (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6). In NA in particular, we observe the emergence and persistence of mutations T242I and R292K, which are known to be associated with oseltamivir resistance (Baz et al., 2006; van der Vries et al., 2013), a phenomenon of strong clinical importance (Renaud et al., 2011) (Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2\u20135).\n\nIn several cases, the same mutations arise independently and reach high frequency in multiple patients (Figure 2C). We identified nine sites in the influenza genome where parallel mutations arose in two or more patients in our study: five in HA, three in NA, and one in the nonstructural (NS) segment (Figure 2C, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7; HA: p<0.001; NA: p<0.01; permutation test). In subsequent analyses, we focused primarily on HA because of its prominent role in antigenic evolution (Koel et al., 2013).\n\nAlthough the same HA mutations arise in multiple patients, we found that evolutionary outcomes sometimes diverge. For instance, A138S arises in patients W and Z, but it fixes only in patient Z. In three patients, N225D reaches a detectable frequency, but it fixes only in patient X (Figure 2C).\n\nWe suspected that the complex dynamics of these within-host mutations might arise from competition among mutant lineages. The influenza genome consists of eight linear segments that freely re-assort with one another but do not recombine (Boni et al., 2008), meaning that each segment evolves clonally. In the absence of homologous recombination, lineages carrying beneficial mutations rise and fall in frequency as they compete with one another, making it harder for any one variant to fix. This phenomenon, known as clonal interference, has been characterized extensively in experimental evolution (Hegreness et al., 2006; Kao and Sherlock, 2008; Lang et al., 2013; Neher, 2013) and affects influenza\u2019s global evolution (Strelkowa and L\u00e4ssig, 2012).\n\nWe examined clonal dynamics within individual patients by analyzing patterns of linkage among within-host mutations. We identified read pairs that spanned multiple variable sites to infer linkage, and we summarized these relationships as haplotypes: for instance, \u20180000\u2019 represents ancestral residues at four variable sites, and \u20181100\u2019 represents a double-mutant at the first two sites (Figure 3A).\n\nIn several instances, the same mutations arise in parallel on distinct genetic backgrounds within the same patient\u2014echoing our observation that these same mutations arise in parallel in multiple patients in our study. In patient X, lineages carrying S193Y and N225D initially compete, but a double-mutant carrying both mutations eventually fixes (Figure 3B). The A138S and F193Y mutations also arise multiple times in parallel in patient W: once on the ancestral haplotype \u20180000\u2019 to form the single-mutant \u20181000\u2019 and \u20180100\u2019 lineages; once on these single-mutant lineages to form the double-mutant \u20181100\u2019; and once on the double-mutant \u20180011\u2019 to form the triple-mutant \u20181011\u2019 and \u20180111\u2019 lineages (Figure 3C). These recurrent mutations also contribute to the large number of clonal lineages present. Several weeks into patient W\u2019s infection, we observe at least five distinct HA lineages at a frequency of at least 5%, and the lineages differ from each other by one to three nonsynonymous mutations (Figure 3C). Eventually, all lineages that carry A138S, V223I, and N225D are outcompeted by a lineage that carries F193Y.\n\nOur analysis shows that in large, clonally evolving influenza populations within hosts, a small set of beneficial mutations repeatedly arise and compete against one another in various combinations. Although many of these beneficial mutations are selected in parallel in multiple patients, the unpredictability of clonal competition determines which mutations eventually fix.\n\nWe compared viral mutations that arose within our patients and at the global scale. Strikingly, many of the HA mutations that arise in parallel in multiple patients in our study also reach a high global frequency, which may reflect concordant antigenic selection at the within-host and global scales. We identified all variants that reached a frequency of at least 10% in any given year after 2000 in the GISAID database of global influenza sequences (Bogner et al., 2006) and compared them to variants that we identified in the patients in our study.\n\nIn HA, most sites that varied within hosts also varied in the global influenza population, compared to about a quarter of such sites in the other influenza genes (Figure 4). We tested whether this overlap between sites of variation within patients and globally was greater than expected by chance for HA, NA, and the rest of the viral genome combined. We calculated the expected overlap when the observed number of within-host and global variants were drawn at random from each gene (Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1\u20132). Not all sites are expected to tolerate mutation, so we also performed simulations where we only considered sites for which there was variation in human H3N2 influenza globally between 2000 and 2015: for instance, in HA about 25% of codon sites show no variation within the GISAID database. We found significant parallelism in HA (p<0.01), but not in NA or in the rest of the genome (p>0.05) when we consider all sites of global variation. This parallelism in HA evolution remains statistically significant at a 0.05 threshold until we assume that less than 50% of HA codon sites tolerate variation.\n\nThe parallelism is especially striking at the sites of HA mutations found in multiple patients in our study. In particular, four of the five sites of recurrent within-host mutation in HA are also sites of global influenza variation (Figure 4, Figure 4\u2014source data 1). The V223I and N225D mutations arise in multiple patients, and then fix globally in the decade after the patient infections (Figure 4D). Mutations also reach high global frequencies at sites 138 and 193, although the F193 and S193 variants that spread globally differ from the Y193 variant that arises within our patients. However, the concordance is incomplete. Mutation L427F reaches a frequency of >75% in three patients but is rare or nonexistent in influenza globally (Figure 4D), suggesting that this mutation may have within-host benefits that are not reflected in global evolution. But overall across hemagglutinin, within-host variants tend to arise at sites that vary on the global scale.\n\nIt is remarkable that influenza evolution shows such extensive parallelism at these disparate spatiotemporal scales despite heterogeneity in host immunity, viral genetic background, and the severity and duration of infection. In particular, the immunocompromised patients in our study had complex underlying conditions and diverse immune histories. Notably, the four HA sites that displayed parallel within-host and global evolution in our study (138, 193, 223, and 225) also gave rise to mutations in another study that used Sanger sequencing to analyze laboratory-passaged influenza isolated longitudinally from an immunocompromised child (Baz et al., 2006). Another previous study used hemagglutination inhibition assays to show that antigenic drift of influenza within an immunocompromised patient resembled global antigenic change (McMinn et al., 1999). These similarities further support our finding that influenza evolution shows parallelism across diverse patients.\n\nThe parallel evolution that we observe in influenza at the within-host and global scales contrasts with HIV, where similar mutations can arise within hosts that share an HLA type, but tend to revert upon transmission to recipients with different HLA types (Leslie et al., 2004; Herbeck et al., 2006; Lemey et al., 2006; Zanini et al., 2015). Part of the difference may be that immune epitopes in influenza are broadly similar among individuals, with some exceptions (Li et al., 2013; Linderman et al., 2014), whereas the targets of anti-HIV immunity vary more widely due to patient-specific factors like HLA type.\n\nWe suggest that parallelism in HA evolution may emerge from the confluence of several evolutionary conditions (L\u00e4ssig et al., 2017). First, if selection acts concordantly across environments, it will favor a common set of beneficial mutations. Second, in a constrained evolutionary landscape, this set of beneficial mutations will be relatively small. Finally, given sufficiently large population sizes, high mutation rates, and time, these beneficial mutations will emerge and be selected to detectable frequencies. Our observation that similar mutations arise repeatedly within single patients, within multiple different patients, and at the global scale, suggests that at least some of these conditions may hold true.\n\nThe parallelism and extensive evolution that we observe in long-term influenza infections contrasts with the limited within-host variation found in prior studies, which sample from acute infections of immunocompetent hosts (Murcia et al., 2010; Hoelzer et al., 2010; Dinis et al., 2016; Debbink et al., 2017; Sobel Leonard et al., 2016; Poon et al., 2016). For instance, one recent study deep-sequenced HA from several hundred patients but only found a small number of antigenic variants, and mostly at low frequencies (Dinis et al., 2016). But our study suggests that influenza may experience many of the same selective pressures within acute infections as it does globally, even if the short durations of these infections make it difficult for selected mutations to reach frequencies that are detectable with current methods. We suggest that within-host viral diversity may act as a noisy early measurement of global viral evolution, shaped by some of the same immunological and evolutionary constraints. As high-throughput sequencing continues to improve, detailed characterization of within-host variation will be increasingly valuable for understanding how molecular, immunological, and epidemiological forces interact to shape viral evolution.\n\nA female in the 25\u201344 age group developed upper respiratory symptoms in early 2007, 30 days after receiving a non-myeloablative HCT for Hodgkin\u2019s disease and 18 days following engraftment. Patient nasal wash samples repeatedly tested positive for influenza A for the next 80 days until the patient died of pulmonary failure, with diffuse alveolar damage found on autopsy. The patient received a 12 day course of oseltamivir at 75 mg PO BID approximately 30 days into the infection and was treated continuously with oseltamivir for the last 26 days of her life, first at 75 mg PO BID and then increasing to 150 mg PO BID. The patient was co-infected with coronavirus for the duration of the influenza infection and also tested positive for human metapneumovirus for the last 26 days of her life.\n\nA male in the 65+ age group developed upper respiratory symptoms in early 2006, 45 days after receiving a non-myeloablative HCT for Hodgkin\u2019s disease. Patient nasal wash samples repeatedly tested positive for influenza A for the next 72 days, after which the patient chose to discontinue study participation. The patient was treated with two courses of oseltamivir: a 5 day course at 75 mg PO BID following the first positive nasal wash, and an 8 day course at 75 mg PO BID approximately four weeks into the infection. The patient also tested positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Aspergillus early in the influenza infection.\n\nA male in the 45\u201364 age group developed upper respiratory symptoms in spring 2006, 62 days after receiving a non-myeloablative HCT for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 52 days after engraftment. Patient nasal wash samples repeatedly tested positive for influenza A for the next 77 days, after which the patient began testing negative. The patient was treated with three courses of oseltamivir: an 8 day course following the first positive nasal wash, a 30 day course beginning approximately two weeks into the infection, and a second 30 day course starting approximately seven weeks into the infection, all at 75 mg PO BID. The patient also intermittently tested positive for CMV and coronavirus during the influenza infection.\n\nA male in the 65+ age group developed upper respiratory symptoms in early 2007, 197 days after receiving a non-myeloablative HCT for AML and 175 days after engraftment. Nasal wash samples repeatedly tested positive for influenza A over the next 69 days, after which monitoring ceased due to severe illness, and the patient died 15 days after the last influenza-positive sample from relapsed AML. The patient was treated with two courses of oseltamivir: a 6 day course at 150 mg PO BID following the first flu-positive nasal wash, and a 66 day course starting approximately two weeks into the infection that began at 150 mg PO QD and increased to 150 mg PO BID. The patient also received 30 g of IVIG 46 days into the flu infection. The patient intermittently tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus over the same period and also experienced Epstein-Barr viremia.\n\nTo deep-sequence viral populations, we extracted bulk RNA from nasal wash samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Where possible, we extracted RNA from 560 \u03bcL of sample, the maximum volume recommended for use with the QIAamp kit, to capture as much viral diversity as possible.\n\nTo amplify the influenza genome, we modified the primers designed by Hoffmann et al. (2001) for full-length amplification of the influenza A genome (Figure 2\u2014source data 1). We performed reverse transcription using Superscript III First-Strand Reaction Mix (Thermo Fisher) and an equimolar mix of the 5\u2019-Hoffmann-U12-A4 and 5\u2019-Hoffmann-U12-G4 primers, which bind to the conserved U12 region present on each influenza gene segment. To 6 \u03bcL RNA eluent, we added 1 \u03bcL annealing buffer and 1 \u03bcL of 2 uM primer mix, then incubated at 65 degrees C for 5 min. We added 10 \u03bcL 2X First-Strand Reaction Mix and 2 \u03bcL Superscript III/RNaseOUT Enzyme Mix on ice for a 20 \u03bcL total reaction volume, then incubated at 25 degrees C for 10 min (this initial incubation is designed to help with the binding of short primers), 50 degrees C for 50 min, and 85 degrees C for 5 min.\n\nWe used the entire 20 \u03bcL volume of the reverse-transcription reaction as template in a 100 \u03bcL PCR reaction using KOD HotStart Reaction Mix (EMP Millipore) and a 24-primer cocktail as described in Figure 2\u2014source data 1 at a total concentration of 600 nM. We performed 35 cycles of PCR amplification with an annealing temperature of 55 degrees C and an extension time of 3 min.\n\nWe purified the PCR product using 1X AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter) and prepared libraries for Illumina sequencing using Nextera XT (Illumina). We sequenced the libraries on a NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina) with 150 bp paired-end reads. We performed library preparation and sequencing in duplicate, starting from independent reverse-transcription reactions.\n\nWe first used bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) to filter out reads that mapped to the human genome. Remaining reads are available in the SRA as BioProject PRJNA364676. We used cutadapt 1.8.3 (Martin, 2011) to trim adapter sequences from the remaining reads, remove bases at the ends of reads with a Q-score below 25, and filter out reads whose remaining length was shorter than 20 bases. We locally aligned trimmed reads to the A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) genome (Genbank accessions CY035022 to CY035029) using bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and tallied the counts of each base at each genome position using custom scripts. We discarded reads with a mapping score below 20, as well as bases with a Q-score below 20.\n\nWe calculated average sequencing coverage in 50 bp bins along the viral genome. Because we prepared sequencing libraries using Nextera tagmentation, we expect coverage to be low at the two ends of the eight viral gene segments, corresponding to 16 bins. We discarded samples with more than 16 bins with average coverage below 200x (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A). We also identified sites at which a non-consensus base reached a frequency of at least 1% in both sequencing replicates and compared variant frequencies between replicates. We discarded samples for which the average difference between variant frequencies in the two replicates exceeded 0.05 (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B). In total, we excluded eight samples from downstream analyses. The samples shown in Figure 1B are high-quality samples only.\n\nWe numbered HA codons according to the H3 numbering system. This HA numbering scheme assigns 1 to codon 17 of the full HA gene, which is the beginning of the mature HA protein. The codons for all other genes are numbered sequentially beginning with one at the N-terminal methionine. The M1 and M2 genes have 27 bp of in-frame and 44 bp of out-of-frame overlap, and the NS1 and NEP genes have 30 bp of in-frame and 251 bp of out-of-frame overlap. We annotated variants separately for each gene if they occurred in these regions of overlap.\n\nFor each patient in our study, we determined the viral consensus sequence at the first sequenced time point. We also downloaded the set of 503 sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiFlu database (Bogner et al., 2006) corresponding to all full-length HA coding regions from human H3N2 influenza A isolates collected in the USA from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2007 (GISAID acknowledgement tables provided in Supplementary file 1). We analyzed only sequences with passage annotation \u2018Unpassaged,\u2019 \u2018Original\u2019, or \u2018P0,\u2019 indicating that the strains were sequenced directly from the clinical isolates, leaving 63 unique sequences for phylogenetic inference. We pairwise aligned each sequence to the A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) coding sequence (Genbank accession CY035022) using the program needle from EMBOSS 6.6.0 (Rice et al., 2000), which implements a Needleman-Wunsch alignment. We used RAxML 8.2.3 (Stamatakis, 2014) to infer a phylogeny from this alignment using a GTRCAT codon-substitution model and visualized the tree using the R package ggtree (Yu et al., 2017).\n\nWe identified paired-end reads that spanned n variable sites of interest within a single gene and determined which bases were present at each variable site. We summarized this information as an n-digit binary haplotype, in which each digit represented one variable site, 0 represented the ancestral base, and 1 represented the derived base. We discarded reads that did not span all sites of interest, or that contained genotypes other than the most common derived base. We estimated the rate of PCR recombination as described in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1. In Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3, we show the number of paired-end reads used to infer the haplotypes in Figure 3.\n\nTo identify sites of global variation in influenza, we downloaded all sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiFlu database (Bogner et al., 2006) corresponding to all full-length influenza coding regions from human H3N2 influenza A isolates collected from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2015. Acknowledgement tables are provided as Supplementary file 1. We pairwise aligned each sequence to the A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) coding sequence (Genbank accession CY035022) using the program needle from EMBOSS 6.6.0 (Rice et al., 2000), which implements a Needleman-Wunsch alignment. We calculated the amino-acid distance of each sequence from the Brisbane/2007 reference and excluded outliers whose distance deviated significantly from the other sequences originating from that year, since these sequences may have been misannotated. We tallied the amino acids present at each codon position in each year, discarding sequences that contained indels, and we identified sites at which multiple amino acids were present at a frequency of at least 10% within a single year, or at which the consensus base changed from year to year.\n\nWe sought to test the probability that the parallel emergence of mutations across multiple patients in our study was due to chance. We began with a simple null model in which all sites are equally likely to mutate, and we drew sites from each gene at random without replacement, matching the number of mutations observed in each patient. We calculated the number of unique sites of mutation among all four patients in this simulated data set, and we compared this distribution to the number of unique sites observed in our sequencing data: fewer unique sites of mutation indicates more parallelism (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7A). This null model is overly simplistic, since some sites in a protein experience more evolutionary constraint. To estimate this constraint, we limited the number of sites considered mutable to the sites that show at least two instances of nonsynonymous mutation in the global H3N2 population between 2000 and 2015 (see Analysis of Global Variation) (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7B). The p-values given in the main text are calculated under this more conservative null model. We also performed permutation tests for a range of possible proportions of mutable sites and calculated the fraction of simulations that matched or exceeded the amount of parallelism observed in our data (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7C).\n\nWe used a similar approach to test whether the overlap of mutations observed within patients in our study and in the global flu population was likely to be due to chance. We drew two independent sets of sites from each gene at random without replacement, matching the total number of unique variable sites within all patients and the number of variable sites observed in the global population. We then calculated the overlap between these two sets of sites. We used the approach above to calculate the overlap under a simple null model in which all sites in the gene are equally like to mutate; a constrained null model in which the only mutable sites are ones that show nonsynonymous mutation between 2000 and 2015; and across a range of possible constraints (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2).\n\nThe FASTQ files are available on the SRA as BioProject PRJNA364676.
