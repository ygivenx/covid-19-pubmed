Infected BMDMs were fixed at 12 hpi using 4% formaldehyde (Ted Pella, CA; 18505) for 10 min at room temperature (RT) and permeabilized with PBS/0.2% TritionX-100 (PBSTX) for overnight at 4C. Cells were stained with rabbit anti-propol antibody at 1:1000 dilution in flow blocking buffer (PBS/0.2% TritionX-100/1% normal goat serum/1% normal mouse serum) at RT for 1 hr. Cells were then washed with PBSTX, stained with DyLight 649 Donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Biolegend, CA; 406406) at RT for 1 hr, and washed with PBSTX before data acquisition. Flow data was acquired using FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, CA) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, OR) . Uninfected/stained samples were used as gating controls; infected/stained samples without treatment were used to calculate relative infection for IFN-treated samples.\n\nImmunofluorescence analysis. BMDM cells ( Figure 7F ) were grown on cover glass (Fisher Scientific, PA; and fixed/permeabilized as described above. Cells were then stained with rabbit anti-propol antibody in blocking buffer (PBS/0.2% TritionX-100/1% normal goat serum/10% normal mouse serum) at RT for 1 hr and then stained with Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit antibody. Nuclei were stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Due to the lack of specific antibodies to detect the localization of endogenous proteins in macrophages, plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged Atg5, Atg12, and Atg16L1 were transfected with a modified MNV reverse genetic construct into mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) (Figure 6 ). At 24 hrs after transfection, the cells were fixed/permeabilized as described above. Cells were then stained with mouse anti-FLAG and rabbit anti-propol antibody in blocking buffer (PBS/0.2% TritionX-100/1% normal goat serum) at RT for 1 hr and then stained with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit antibodies. MNV reverse genetic construct was modified to express ORF1 (polyprotein for MNV replication complex) of MNV-1. CW3 (Strong et al., submitted) . In this MEF system, we confirmed that Atg5 is also required for IFN\u03b3 to suppress MNV replication ( Figure S5A ). Images were obtained and analyzed using Olympus BX51 (Olympus America, PA) and SPOT Advanced software (Diagnostic Instruments, MI).\n\nSTORM Setup and Imaging. The STORM microscope was constructed around a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope operating in wide-field epifluorescence mode and using the Nikon Perfect Focus system for focus stabilization. The activation/imaging lasers (CUBE 405nm-50, Sapphire 561nm-150, Sapphire 460-10 from Coherent and Stradus 642nm-110 from Vortran Laser) were individually shuttered by a mechanical shutter (Uniblitz LS3ZM2, Vincent Associates) and an acousto-optical tunable filter (AOTF, PCAOM, Crystal technology). Laser lines were combined, expanded and collimated before being focused at the back focal plane of a 100x objective (100X UPlanSApo NA 1.4, Olympus). A quad band dichroic mirror (zt405/488/561/640rpc from Chroma) and a band-pass filter (ET705/70m, Chroma) separated the fluorescence signal collected by the same objective from the excitation light. Images were recorded with an EMCCD camera (iXon Plus DU897, Andor) and a Dual View system (Photometrics DV2) inserted between the microscope and the camera as an image relay. The Dual View splitting cassette was replaced with a cylindrical lens (1M focal length) to create the astigmatism for 3D imaging. MEF cells were plated on a No. 1.5 coverglass, transfected and processed for immunofluorecense as described above. Secondary antibodies for STORM were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch and custom conjugated with photoswitchable dye pairs as described before (Bates et al., 2007) . Imaging was performed by inverting coverslips onto a glass slide with imaging buffer (80:10:10:1 ratio of DPBS, 1 M mercaptoethylamine (pH 8.5), 50% glucose solution, and an antibeaching oxygen scavenger system (10 mg of glucose oxidase + 25 ml of catalase and 100 ul of DPBS). Excess buffer was drained and edges of coverglass were sealed with nailpolish before image acquisition. Astigmatism STORM imaging (Huang et al., 2008) allowed us to observe the distribution of these proteins in 3D.\n\nPurified RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% formaldehyde gel and transferred onto Nytran SPC membrane using TurboBlotter (GE Healthcare, 10416304). The nt 5,750 to 6,666 (major capsid protein VP1) of the MNV-1.CW3 genome and nt 446-596 of mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; GenBank: GU214026.1) were cloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen; K4650-01). The resulting plasmid was linearized and in vitro transcribed with 32 P-UTP using MAXIscript T7 Kit (Applied biosystems; AM1312) to generate RNA transcript probes.\n\nThe synthesis and/or accumulation of negative strand RNA was analyzed using an twocycle RNase protection assay (RPA) as previously described (Novak and Kirkegaard, 1991) . For synthesis of RNA probes for two-cycle RNase protection assay (RPA), the nt 4,500 to 4,760 (polymerase) of the MNV-1.CW3 genome was cloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector (pCRII4500-4760). A 339 nt plus polarity RNA probe that protects a 261 nt fragment of the negative strand genomic RNA was synthesized with SP6 polymerase from Not I linearized pCRII4500-4760 (MNV probe). A 283 nt minus polarity RNA probe, that protects a 151 nt fragment of mouse GAPDH, was synthesized with T7 polymerase from Hind III linearized pCRII-GAPDH described above (GAPDH probe) and used as a control. Synthesized probes were gel extracted and ethanol precipitated before use and labeled probes were synthesized to a specific activity of ~ 1 x 10 8 cpm/ug (MNV probe) and 1 x 10 6 cpm/ug (GAPDH probe) and used within 2 days. ATP concentration. Macrophages were incubated for 2 hrs with media alone or media containing 25mM 2-deoxyglucose + 3 \u03bcM antimycin to inhibit glycolysis and mitochondrial ATP generation, respectively. The cells were lysed on ice in ATP lysis buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.4, 300mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, + complete protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)). Lysates were plated in duplicate in a white, opaque 96-well flat-bottom plate and mixed 1:1 with CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) for 2 minutes on an orbital shaker before being read on a luminometer. An ATP standard curve was determined by diluted concentrated ATP directly into ATP lysis buffer.\n\nCycloheximide chase. Control and Atg5 deficient bone marrow derived macrophages were infected at MOI=5 after pre-treatment of none or 10 U/ml of IFN\u03b3. At 8 hrs post infection, cells were treated with 40\u00b5M cycloheximide and 10\u00b5M anisomycin and harvested at 0, 2, 3 and 4 hrs after addition of translation inhibitors for western blot. To test effectiveness of translation inhibitors, control macrophages were treated with decreasing concentrations of cycloheximide and anisomycin for 30mins. Cells were pulsed with [ 35 S]-cysteine-methionine for 2hrs and lysates were run on SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by autoradiography. Figure S1 .
