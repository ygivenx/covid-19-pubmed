{"title": "Analysis of Ebola Virus Entry Into Macrophages", "body": "Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium or Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium, supplemented with 5%\u201310% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophages by exposure to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (Sigma). Primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were cultured in monocyte differentiation medium: X-VIVO 10 (Lonza) supplemented with 1% human fibrin-depleted plasma and antibiotics. All cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C and 5% carbon dioxide.\n\nFirst, MDMs were prepared from thrombocyte-depleted blood from healthy human donors by means of Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Subsequently, cells were cultured in monocyte adhesion medium (Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium with 7.5% human fibrin-depleted plasma and antibiotics), nonadherent cells were removed by washing. The next day, cells were detached, reseeded in monocyte differentiation medium, and cultivated for 7 days. Differentiation into MDMs was controlled by analyzing CD14 expression.\n\nExpression plasmids for viral GPs [24, 25], lectins [24, 26], C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A) [27], NPC1 [7], TIM-3 [28], angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [24], and folate receptor \u03b1 [29] were described elsewhere. The plasmid encoding Axl was purchased (ImageGenes). Expression plasmids for human TIM-1, TIM-4, and scavenger receptor A (SR-A) were generated by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cloning of products into plasmid pCAGGS. The integrity of all PCR-amplified sequences was confirmed by automated sequence analysis. Antibodies against entry factors were purchased from R&D Systems.\n\n293T cells, transfected to express entry factors, were incubated with concentrated cellular supernatants containing comparable amounts (as determined by Western blot analysis) of EBOV-GP1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein, subunit S1 (SARS-S1) fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin, as described elsewhere [24]. After washing, cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate\u2013labeled secondary antibody (Dianova) and analyzed by means of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).\n\nFor Mer expression, THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages and small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfected, as described below, and then incubated for 24 hours followed by FACS analysis of Mer expression. For SR-A expression, MDMs were siRNA transfected as described below and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Proteins were then separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hartenstein), and SR-A expression was detected with a SR-A\u2013specific antibody and horseradish peroxidase\u2013coupled secondary antibody (Jackson Research). Signal intensities were quantified using the ImageJ software program version 1.47 (National Institutes of Health).\n\nFor detection of TIM-1, Axl, and NPC1 transcripts with quantitative RT-PCR, RNA was extracted from cell lines and MDMs and analyzed using an ABI 7500 FAST real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), TaqMan gene expression assays (Life Technologies catalog No. 4448892; assays Hs03054852_g1 [TIM-1], Hs01064444_m1 [Axl], Hs00264835_m1 [NPC1] and Hs99999908_m1 [\u03b2-glucuronidase]). The mean cycle threshold (Ct) value for each individual assay was calculated from triplicate measurements and mean Ct values calculated for TIM-1, Axl, and NPC1 were normalized by subtraction from the Ct values obtained for the housekeeping reference \u03b2-glucuronidase. Template-free complementary DNA reactions were analyzed in parallel, and no specific signal was detected in any of these experiments.\n\nLentiviral vectors pseudotyped with heterologous viral GPs (pseudotypes) were generated as described elsewhere [11] and normalized for comparable infectivity for 293T cells. For transduction experiments, target cell lines were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated for 8 hours with vector preparations. The MDMs were spinoculated at 2000 rpm and 21\u00b0C for 2 hours and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 6 hours. Subsequently, the medium was replaced by fresh culture medium. Transduction efficiency was determined by quantifying luciferase activities in cell lysates 72 hours after transduction using a commercial kit (Promega). To assess the impact of siRNA knock-down on transduction, the target cells were Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transfected with 5 pmol siRNAs (Santa Cruz) at 24 hours before transduction. To determine whether U18666A (Biomol), tannic acid, and mannan (both Sigma-Aldrich) modulated transduction efficiencies, the inhibitors were incubated with target cells for 30\u201360 minutes before addition of pseudotypes.\n\nAll experiments with replication competent Ebola virus (EBOV, formerly Zaire ebolavirus), strain Mayinga, were performed in the BSL-4 facility of the Institute of Virology at the Philipps-University Marburg. First, MDMs seeded in 8-well chamber slides (ibidi) were transfected with siRNA in duplicates and infected with EBOV at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Inoculum was replaced by fresh culture medium at 1 hour after infection and infection was stopped after 16 hours by treatment of cells with medium containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). After virus inactivation by PFA, cells were permeabilized and stained for nucleoprotein, and nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. To determine infection efficiency, 100 pictures of each well were taken with an automated microscope, and the number of nucleoprotein-positive cells relative to the total number of cells was determined in every tenth photomicrographs.\n\nTIM proteins and TAM receptor tyrosine kinases are expressed on certain EBOV target cells and were previously implicated in host cell entry of these viruses [10, 14, 16]. To confirm and extend these observations, we compared the ability of lectins, TIM proteins, and the TAM family member Axl to augment EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry into 293T cells, which can be efficiently transfected and are highly susceptible to transduction mediated by ebolavirus GPs [11]. For transduction, we opted for pseudotypes bearing the GP of the highly pathogenic EBOV and an EBOV-GP variant lacking the mucin domain (EBOV-GP\u0394muc), which was reported to yield higher vector titers than the wild-type (WT) protein [30].\n\nExpression of the C-type lectins DC-SIGN, DC-SIGN-Related, asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGPR-1), and liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECtin) increased EBOV-GP\u2013 and EBOV-GP\u0394muc\u2013mediated transduction up to 37-fold but had no effect on entry mediated by vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) (Figure 1A), as expected [10, 11, 24, 26]. An increase in transduction efficiency was also observed on expression of TIM-1, whereas expression of TIM-4 and Axl had no effect on transduction mediated by EBOV-GP but slightly enhanced transduction driven by EBOV-GP\u0394muc (Figure 1B). Finally, expression of folate receptor \u03b1 (which does not augment GP-driven entry [29, 31]), TIM-3, and CLEC5A (a lectin that interacts with dengue virus [32]), did not modulate transduction under all conditions tested. These results demonstrate that expression of certain lectins and TIM-1 on a susceptible cell line can increase EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry, supporting a role for these proteins in host cell entry of EBOVs.\n\n\nWe next tested whether the entry factors examined in our study interact directly with the GP1 subunit of the EBOV-GP. The expression of all entry factors tested was readily detectable on transfected cells (Figure 2A), and binding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein, subunit S1, fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin to DC-SIGN\u2013 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\u2013expressing cells was markedly above the background signal (Figure 2B), as expected [33]. The EBOV-GP1 subunit was also able to bind to DC-SIGN, in keeping with published results [10, 11, 33], but binding to the other proteins tested was within the background range, at least under the conditions used (Figure 2B). Thus, augmentation of GP-driven host cell entry by lectins but not by TIM-1 and Axl might rely on efficient binding to the GP1 subunit, in keeping with the concept that the latter factors augment EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry by binding to PtdSer in the viral envelope [20, 23].\n\n\nDC-SIGN is only expressed on a narrow spectrum of target cells of EBOV infection, including dendritic cells and certain tissue macrophages. Therefore, we focused our subsequent analyses on TIM-1 and Axl, which are broadly expressed on cell lines, as confirmed by FACS analysis (Figure 3A), and primary cells. However, a comparison between endogenous TIM-1 and Axl expression on cell lines and susceptibility to EBOV-GP and EBOV-GP\u0394muc-driven transduction revealed no correlation (Figure 3B). Similarly, the effect of siRNA-mediated knock-down of Axl and TIM-1 expression (Figure 3C) on transduction efficiency was dependent on cell type (Figure 3D). Thus, augmentation of EBOV-GP\u2013mediated transduction by Axl and TIM-1 is restricted to certain cell lines, a finding that matches previous results [15, 16].\n\n\nThe NPC1 protein, an intracellular EBOV entry factor, is ubiquitously expressed. We asked whether NPC1, in contrast to Axl and TIM-1, is universally required for EBOV-GP\u2013mediated transduction. Indeed, knock-down of NPC1 expression (Figure 4A) and treatment of target cells with U18666A, an inhibitor that induces a NPC1 knockout phenotype in treated cells [34], efficiently and specifically reduced EBOV-GP\u2013 and EBOV-GP\u0394muc\u2013driven transduction (Figure 4B). Moreover, we found that NPC1 messenger RNA (mRNA) was readily detectable in C8166 T lymphocytes and Raji B cells (Figure 4C), which were resistant to EBOV-GP\u2013driven transduction (Figure 4D), indicating that lack of NPC1 does not account for the well-documented resistance of lymphocytes to EBOV-GP\u2013mediated entry [35].\n\n\nMacrophages are targeted early and throughout EBOV infection [36, 37]. Therefore, we next asked whether Axl, TIM-1, and NPC1 contribute to GP-driven transduction of MDMs. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that MDMs express only low amounts of Axl and TIM-1 compared with the cell lines HeLa and Huh7 (Figure 5A). In keeping with this finding, siRNA-mediated knock-down of Axl and TIM-1 expression had no appreciable effect on EBOV-GP\u2013driven transduction of MDMs (Figure 5B). In contrast, knock-down of NPC1 significantly reduced MDM transduction mediated by EBOV-GP but not VSV-G. Similarly, transduction of MDMs by EBOV-GP\u2013 but not VSV-G\u2013bearing pseudotypes was reduced efficiently and in a concentration-dependent manner by U18666A (Figure 5C), indicating that NPC1 might be required for EBOV infection of macrophages. Finally, the mannose-polymer mannan, which inhibits ligand binding to DC-SIGN and related lectins, did not inhibit GP-driven transduction of MDMs, although it markedly reduced transduction of 293T cells expressing DC-SIGN (Figure 5D), indicating that mannose-specific lectins do not promote GP-dependent entry into macrophages.\n\n\nThe results obtained so far indicate that, of the previously identified EBOV entry factors, only NPC1 is essential for efficient GP-mediated transduction of MDMs. Notably, 2 factors required for optimal transduction of cell lines, Axl and TIM-1, are intimately involved in the recognition of apoptotic cells [17, 18]. Therefore, we asked whether EBOV-GP might exploit other cellular factors with a comparable activity for macrophage entry. We focused our analysis on integrin \u03b1V, CD14, CD36, LOX-1, SR-A, and Mer, all known to be expressed in macrophages and to play a role in the detection of apoptotic cells [38]. Moreover, integrin \u03b1V and Mer were previously implicated in EBOV-GP\u2013mediated entry [13, 14]. Transfection of siRNAs directed against integrin \u03b1V, SR-A, and Mer expression significantly reduced EBOV-GP\u2013 but not VSV-G\u2013mediated transduction of MDMs (Figure 6A, left). Moreover, a combination of siRNAs against Mer, SR-A and NPC1 reduced transduction more efficiently than the single siRNAs (Figure 6A, right), suggesting that Mer, SR-A, NPC1, and integrin \u03b1V might all be required for robust EBOV-GP\u2013mediated transduction of macrophages.\n\n\nWe next assessed the efficiency and specificity of the siRNA-mediated knock-down of Mer and SR-A expression. We analyzed the effects of siRNA transfection on Mer expression using THP-1 cell\u2013derived macrophages, because Mer protein was readily detected on these cells but not on MDMs, owing to high background signals measured for the latter. Mer expression was modestly reduced upon transfection of Mer-specific but not NPC1- or SR-A\u2013specific siRNA (Figure 6B). Similarly, expression of SR-A in MDMs was reduced by siRNA specific for SR-A but not NPC1. Transfection of siRNA directed against Mer had a slight but reproducible effect on SR-A expression (Figure 6B), suggesting that full expression of SR-A might depend on parallel expression of Mer, a scenario in keeping with published findings [39].\n\nTo assess the specificity of entry modulation by siRNAs, we investigated HeLa cells, which are negative for SR-A [40] and Mer [41]. NPC1-specific siRNA markedly reduced EBOV-GP\u2013 but not VSV-G\u2013driven entry (Figure 6C), as expected. In contrast, siRNA against Mer had no significant effect on EBOV-GP\u2013mediated transduction and slightly augmented transduction driven by VSV-G. Finally, siRNA directed against SR-A reduced EBOV-GP\u2013 but not VSV-G\u2013driven transduction by 45% (Figure 6C), suggesting off-target effects. To further investigate the role of SR-A, we asked whether tannic acid, which blocks ligand binding to SR-A [42], inhibits transduction of MDMs. Indeed, tannic acid reduced EBOV-GP\u2013 but not VSV-G\u2013mediated transduction in a robust and concentration dependent manner (Figure 6D). Collectively, these results are in keeping with a role of SR-A and Mer in EBOV-GP\u2013dependent macrophage transduction, although off-target effects of the SR-A siRNA cannot be excluded.\n\nIt is possible that GP-pseudotyped retroviral particles might not mirror all facets of EBOV entry into host cells. Therefore, we assessed whether the siRNAs directed against Mer and SR-A reduced MDM infection by replication-competent EBOV. We also tested siRNA against integrin \u03b1V and NPC1. Transfection of single siRNAs slightly but reproducibly decreased infection efficiency, and a marked drop in the infection rate was observed upon parallel knock-down of Mer, SR-A and NPC1 (Figure 7), indicating that the expression of NPC1, together with several factors involved in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, is required for efficient EBOV infection of macrophages.\n\n\nThe present study confirms that TIM-1 and Axl can promote EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry into certain cell lines and shows that these proteins do not augment entry into macrophages. In contrast, NPC1 was required for entry into macrophages and all cell lines tested. Finally, evidence was obtained that also Mer, integrin \u03b1V, and possibly SR-A promote EBOV infection of macrophages.\n\nThe comparative analysis of EBOV entry factors revealed that lectins are most efficient at increasing GP-driven entry into already-susceptible 293T cells. However, mannose-specific lectins did not promote GP-dependent transduction of MDMs and have little impact on EBOV infection of monocyte-derived dendritic cells [12]. These in vitro results argue against a major contribution of mannose-specific lectins to EBOV entry into macrophages and dendritic cells in vivo. Nevertheless, one should keep in mind that lectins such as human macrophage C-type lectin specific for galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine, LSECtin, and ASGPR-1, which recognize carbohydrates other than mannose and augment EBOV-GP\u2013driven infection in cell culture [24, 26, 43], might affect viral cell tropism in vivo.\n\nTAM receptor tyrosine kinases and TIM proteins promote entry of ebolaviruses [14, 16] and other enveloped viruses [19, 20, 23, 44] by binding to PtdSer in the viral envelope. Upon expression in 293T cells, TIM-1, but no other TIM proteins or Axl, increased EBOV-GP WT\u2013mediated entry. Augmentation of GP-driven entry upon TIM-1, Axl, and TIM-4 expression was either more pronounced or exclusively observed for EBOV-GP\u0394muc compared to EBOV-GP WT, suggesting that the presence of the mucinlike domain might modulate augmentation of GP-driven transduction by PtdSer-binding proteins. The inability of TIM-3 to augment entry is due to inadequate presentation of its PtdSer-binding domain [45]. In contrast, it is currently unclear why TIM-1 augments entry driven by EBOV-GP but not VSV-G (and a few other viral GPs), a finding also reported by others [19], and several hypotheses have been proposed [19, 23].\n\nOur finding that endogenous expression of TIM-1 and Axl augments GP-driven entry into a subset of susceptible cell lines matches previous reports [16, 22] and raised the questions whether these factors contribute to GP-mediated entry into macrophages. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that less Axl and TIM-1 mRNA is produced in MDMs compared with susceptible cell lines, and siRNA-knock-down showed that expression of these factors is dispensable for GP-driven entry into MDMs. In contrast, Mer but not Axl expression was required for efficient GP-driven transduction and EBOV infection of MDMs. Similarly, Mer but not Axl or Tyro3 was found to be essential for efficient phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages [46], indicating that Mer is the TAM receptor kinase active in macrophages.\n\nSeveral previous reports indicate a key role of NPC1 in host cell entry of ebolaviruses [7\u20139]. Our finding that NPC1 was required for GP-mediated transduction of all target cells tested and was essential for efficient EBOV infection of macrophages suggests that NPC1 may be universally required for host cell infection by ebolaviruses. In this regard, it should be noted that the lymphocytic cell lines examined here expressed robust levels of NPC1 mRNA, suggesting that lack of NPC1 expression does not account for the resistance of lymphocytes to GP-driven entry.\n\nThe relatively modest effect of Mer knock-down on GP-driven entry into MDMs and EBOV infection of MDMs suggested that other factors might contribute to these processes, and we speculated that they may also recognize apoptotic cells. Indeed, we found that siRNAs against integrin \u03b1V and SR-A reduced GP-driven entry and EBOV infection of MDMs. Integrins \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b25 interact with milk fat globule-EGF factor 8, which in turn recognizes PtdSer [47], suggesting that these factors might promote GP-driven entry in a fashion similar to TAM receptor kinases and their PtdSer-binding ligands growth arrest-specific protein 6 or protein S [44]. Such a scenario could be reconciled with a previous study reporting that recombinant \u03b15\u03b21 integrin or antibodies against \u03b21 integrin interfere with GP-driven entry [13]. However, subsequent work indicated that expression of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin is required for full activity of cathepsin L, which processes GP for binding to NPC1 [13, 48]. Integrin \u03b1V expression might thus promote macrophage entry of ebolaviruses via several mechanisms.\n\nSR-A is expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells and contributes to the macrophage uptake of a broad spectrum of ligands, including apoptotic cells [49]. EBOV-GP1 did not bind to cells expressing SR-A and directed expression of SR-A did not augment GP-driven transduction (not shown) but treatment of MDMs with SR-A\u2013specific siRNA consistently reduced EBOV-GP\u2013 but not VSV-G\u2013driven entry as well as EBOV infection. Furthermore, GP-driven transduction of MDMs was also inhibited by tannic acid and fucoidan (not shown), SR-A ligands [42, 50], arguing for a role of SR-A in entry of EBOVs into macrophages. On the other hand, siRNA against SR-A also reduced GP-driven entry into SR-A\u2013negative HeLa cells, and alveolar macrophages isolated from SR-A knockout and WT mice were equally susceptible to GP-driven transduction (not shown). Further studies are therefore required to fully define the potential role of SR-A in macrophage entry of ebolaviruses. Collectively, our results support the concept that ebolaviruses use apoptotic mimicry for infection of cell lines and macrophages and suggest that the set of factors exploited by the viruses for this purpose may be cell type dependent."}
