{"title": "Don\u2019t be the \u201cFifth Guy\u201d: Risk, Responsibility, and the Rhetoric of Handwashing Campaigns", "body": "Personal responsibility may be a cornerstone of public health, but hand hygiene promotion is an especially persuasive vehicle for popularizing an individualistic conception of infection risk. By \u201chand hygiene promotion,\u201d I mean efforts to instruct a broad, lay public in hygiene practices typically used to reduce the transmission of disease-causing pathogens in hospitals and clinics. In this essay, I use \u201chandwashing campaigns\u201d and \u201chand hygiene promotion\u201d interchangeably to describe the discursive encouragement of this habit. I also focus mainly on hand hygiene promotion within North America, where amid H1N1 handwashing campaigns and hand hygiene products alike became endemic. Commenting on this trend in a New Yorker essay, Owen (2013) links the phenomenal success of Gojo Industry\u2019s blockbuster hand sanitizer, Purell, to anxieties about infection risk.5 Today, hand sanitizer is a product category in its own right, and its popularity is sometimes regarded critically as both indicative of and responsible for a distinct shift in cultural perceptions of infection risk.6 In my view, however, Purell\u2019s unprecedented sales figures7 are inextricably tied both to the increased promotion of hand hygiene in recent decades and to the ongoing individualization of public health.\n\nA drawback of undertaking a critique of hand hygiene is appearing to be against hand washing and other expressions of illness etiquette. Hand hygiene is a vital form of infection control, and as such, it is also an ethical practice, particularly during an outbreak. Rather than argue against hand hygiene, I explore the limits of hand hygiene promotion, as well as its implication in the deepening entrenchment of the new public health. In this respect, my essay draws its inspiration from the work of Metzl, who in the introduction to his co-edited multidisciplinary anthology Against Health, writes that health is a \u201cdesired state, but it is also a prescribed state and an ideological position\u201d (2010, 2). The same argument applies to public health, which broadly speaking entails the strategic, organized effort to \u201cpersuade a defined public to engage in behaviors that that will improve health or refrain from behaviors that are unhealthy\u201d (Springston 2013, 713). Hand hygiene promotion especially invites further scrutiny because its prescriptive, ideological qualities far too often go unnoticed. Hence, I focus my attention here on describing how handwashing campaigns benefit the overarching emphasis on personal responsibility for infection risk.\n\nAn important precedent for my critique is Plyushteva\u2019s analysis (2009).8 Plyushteva examines the promotion of hand hygiene in developing countries, which she sees as having applications beyond the potential reduction high mortality rates due to infection. In fact, just as in North America, hand hygiene promotion directed at publics in developing countries aims to empower these publics to protect themselves from the risk of infection. Since 2008, for example, Global Handwashing Day has been celebrated annually on October 5. An initiative of the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap (Global PPPHW), Global Handwashing Day is \u201cdedicated to increasing awareness and understanding about the importance of handwashing with soap as an effective and affordable way to prevent diseases and save lives.\u201d The celebration also presents \u201can opportunity to . . . encourage people to wash their hands\u201d\u2014or, as explained in a Global Handwashing Day press release, to inspire personal responsibility.9 In developing countries, hand hygiene promotion\u2019s emphasis on personal responsibility may affect perceptions of entitlement to care. Indeed, Global Handwashing Day presents infection risk as managed not through the provision of clean water or proper sanitation but rather through the adoption of appropriate personal measures.\n\nUnderwritten by an array of corporate sponsors, Global Handwashing Day also teaches people living in developing countries to become faithful consumers of hand sanitizer and soap, just like their counterparts in developed countries. Current sponsors include Colgate-Palmolive, Procter and Gamble, and Unilever, all companies with a massive stake in the global marketplace for personal hygiene products. (Corporate sponsors may also have influenced the naming of the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap. Even the scholarship produced by the researchers working for this partnership typically includes this addendum.) Global Handwashing Day\u2019s instruction in the consumption of personal hygiene products, too, has ties to the overarching emphasis on personal responsibility that defines the new public health. Hand hygiene is promoted as a \u201cdo-it-yourself vaccine,\u201d a hedge against infection risk (apparently) even in settings in which infection risk often stems from poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water.10\n\nOf course, regardless of context, hygiene habits have a proven impact on the transmission of disease-causing pathogens. Hand hygiene limits the spread of diarrheal and respiratory diseases, which are among the leading causes of child mortality in developing countries.11 Children thus comprise a key audience for Global Handwashing Day, which seeks to transform them into \u201cchange agents\u201d who have the capacity to \u201cpositively influence other people\u2019s health behaviours\u201d (Global PPPHW 2015). However, as Plyushteva observes, Global Handwashing Day\u2019s celebration of the life-saving power of individual behavior change potentially obscures understandings of the structural factors that shape infection risk. In developing countries, for example, the spread of disease stems from lack of access to clean water and adequate waste disposal and not mainly from a lack of agency per se. In tying infection risk to the \u201csuboptimal behaviour of the poor\u201d (2009, 428), handwashing campaigns in developing countries exacerbate longstanding power imbalances, potentially reinforcing rather than removing obstacles to meaningful change. At the same time, hand hygiene promotion in this context expands the global marketplace for personal hygiene products, forging new opportunities to profit from the intractable problem of infectious disease.\n\nPlyushteva\u2019s analysis is helpful to my own because she draws attention to hand hygiene promotion\u2019s insidiousness and stresses its consequent potential to serve a range of motivations. Some of these motivations in fact conflict with the aims of public health, particularly in developing countries. \u201cAt first glance,\u201d she argues, \u201cthe cause of handwashing appears as apolitical and uncontroversial as can be\u201d (428). So unproblematic is hand hygiene, and so important are efforts to promote it, that the very few criticisms of Global Handwashing Day have largely been ignored.12 For her part, Plyushteva takes issue with the celebration\u2019s stigmatizing of people in developing countries \u201cas traditional or backward, or, in a teleological view of development, pre-modern\u201d (424). Hand hygiene\u2019s \u201cuncontroversial fa\u00e7ade\u201d (420) also obscures the reality that individual behavior change is only ever a \u201cpartial solution\u201d (429) to the spread of disease. Efforts to quell the spread of disease through behavior change also depend on the implementation of structural interventions\u2014changes that create an environment supportive of personal responsibility. (I return to these limitations of personal responsibility in my conclusion.)\n\nI quote Plyushteva at length because hers is the most recent scholarly critique of contemporary, globalized efforts to promote hand hygiene promotion.13 Her writing establishes a precedent for my critique of North American handwashing campaigns, which may also do more, politically and economically, than simply diminish the risk of infection. Circulated within workplaces, schools, transit hubs, airports, community centers, groceries stores, and shopping malls, handwashing campaigns portray individual bodies, and body parts, as dangerous vectors of infectious disease. What makes these bodies, and parts, dangerous is both that they spread infection and because the disease-causing pathogens they transmit remain invisible to the individuals who transmit them. As a caption for a handwashing poster created by Yale University\u2019s Emergency Management Department in 2009, in response to H1N1, puts it, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a mystery on your hands.\u201d\n\nTaking the form of pamphlets, posters, transit ads, web infographics, social media campaigns, and public service announcements, these texts caution that the power to prevent (and spread) infection is in our hands. Sales figures for hand sanitizer alone illustrate the impressive new revenue streams generated by this individualization of infection risk. Even in developed countries, where the assumption of personal responsibility is less likely to be impeded by structural issues, hand hygiene promotion may nevertheless skew perceptions of contextual or social determinants of infection risk. Most notable among these factors may be the availability of sick leave or the effects on susceptibility of feelings of anxiety or stress.\n\nHand hygiene promotion invariably serves two distinct purposes. At one level, as exercises in risk communication, handwashing campaigns satisfy the obligation to inform publics about how to diminish the risk of infection. The most effective display of hand hygiene promotion\u2019s function as a form of risk communication may be the infographics, often posted in public restrooms, that illustrate the handwashing procedures practiced by healthcare professionals. These infographics teach handwashing methods, but they also serve to emphasize the need for personal responsibility in public settings. Indeed, at another level, many handwashing campaigns often serve more expressly rhetorical goals. The most effective\u2014and the most problematic\u2014is the use of hand hygiene promotion to exacerbate a whole host of negative emotions, from anxiety, distrust, fear, and doubt to nausea and disgust. Some of the most prominent voices behind the turn to hand hygiene promotion, particularly in developed countries, have emphatically defended the rhetorical utility of public health campaigns that inspire feelings of disgust.14 In my close reading, I focus more on this latter function of handwashing campaign\u2014that is, its use to foster emotional states that predispose audiences to the adoption of personal responsibility.\n\nHand hygiene promotion\u2019s alignment with an axiom of neoliberalism\u2014the emphasis on personal responsibility\u2014is also worthy of further examination. Harvey describes the typical characteristics of the neoliberal state and explains, the \u201csocial safety net is reduced to a bare minimum in favour of a system that emphasizes personal responsibility. Personal failure is generally attributed to personal failings, and the victim is all too often blamed\u201d (2005, 76). Harvey\u2019s account stresses the economic advantages of the neoliberal emphasis on personal responsibility. Indeed, a neoliberal approach to infection risk has both shifted attention away from costlier programs of outbreak management and accorded private stakeholders unparalleled economic advantages. Arguably, the main benefactors of personal responsibility for infection risk are the corporations that develop and distribute products in support of illness etiquette. Yet the recent popularity of hand sanitizer does more than reflect the successful marketing of hand hygiene as an antidote to both uncertainty and infection. Rather, this shift in consumptive patterns also illustrates the tremendous impact of handwashing campaigns on a risk-oriented subjectivity.\n\nAlongside promoting a habit that may reduce the transmission of disease, handwashing texts heighten awareness of those who fail in their duty to limit the spread of infection. Non-compliance with the dictates of hand hygiene promotion becomes grounds not merely for blame but also for suspicion about a person\u2019s moral worth. Contemporary handwashing campaigns thus form a constitutive rhetoric, a mode of rhetorical appeal that calls into existence a shared collective identity. Within hand hygiene promotion, the collectivity identity called into existence is that of the health citizen for whom participation in containing an outbreak is a personal responsibility.15 White describes \u201cconstitutive rhetoric\u201d (a term that he coined) as \u201cthe central art by which culture and community are established, maintained, and transformed\u201d (1985, 28). Scholars use constitutive rhetoric to explain the discursive formation of new social and political subjectivities. In demonstrating how some rhetorics discursively constitute the very subjects they address, many critics follow Charland\u2019s model of constitutive rhetoric (1987).16 Into White\u2019s theory, Charland incorporates Burke\u2019s notion of identification (1969) and Althusser\u2019s idea of interpellation, or \u201chailing\u201d (1971). As Charland observes, constitutive appeals produce and reinforce new subject positions (1987). By responding to these appeals, individuals affirm their membership in the community.\n\nConstitutive rhetoric has been a useful analysis for health humanities scholars and practitioners.17 Anthropologist Joseph Dumit, for example, argues that strategies employed in pharmaceutical discourse create new opportunities for marketing drugs by constituting the individual as a body at risk of disease (2012). The strategic constitution of bodily risk, Dumit argues, is essential to keeping Americans on \u201cdrugs for life.\u201d Scholars of rhetoric of health and medicine have employed constitutive rhetoric to critique the interpellation of headache patients as well as of patients as narrative subjects (Segal 2005). Derkatch has used constitutive rhetoric to account for the maintenance of professional boundaries in medicine (2012), whereas Kopelson has shown in response to breast cancer, public health organizations mobilize citizens as consumer-activists (2013). Majdik and Platt describe the health subject constituted by the marketing campaign for a genetic testing product (2012). Interpellation has also been a productive means for scholars to describe how public health officials shape perceptions of risk and responsibility in response to outbreak (Briggs 2004; Davis, Stephenson, and Flowers 2011). Hand hygiene promotion presents an opportunity to examine the constitutive functions of efforts to foster personal responsibility for infection risk.\n\nHandwashing campaigns transform perceptions of responsibility for disease outbreaks. They do so by situating the risk of infection in individual bodies. The adoption of illness etiquette in response to hand hygiene promotion thus signals at least a partial acceptance of the new public health.18 Because it singles out the individual bodies\u2014and individual body parts\u2014that spread infection, hand hygiene promotion might be understood as both a constitutive rhetoric and a \u201cstigmatizing rhetoric.\u201d Proposed by Metzl in Against Health (2010) and premised on the writings of Goffman ([1963] 1986), a stigmatizing rhetoric derives its conception of the \u201chealthy\u201d from portrayals of the \u201cunhealthy.\u201d In other words, notions of poor health shore up understandings of good health. As Metzl asserts, within a stigmatizing rhetoric, the \u201caffirmation of one\u2019s own health depends on the constant recognition, and indeed the creation, of the spoiled health of others\u201d (2010, 5). Taking up Metzl\u2019s refrain, some of the contributors to the multidisciplinary anthology, Against Health, critique the centrality of stigmatizing rhetoric to a neoliberal model of public health. LeBesco, for example, argues that U.S. anti-obesity campaigns reinforce the valuing of \u201cgood citizens [who] take care of their own health\u201d (2010, 78) at the expense of those classified as overweight or obese. Handwashing campaigns potentially display such a stigmatizing rhetoric whenever their promotion of hand hygiene casts it as a prosocial behavior rather than as merely a method of infection control. According to these stigmatizing texts, the failure to observe hand hygiene has profound consequences in addition to the potential for infection.\n\nCreated by the Florida Department of Health in response to H1N1, the \u201cFifth Guy\u201d campaign illustrates the use of a constitutive, stigmatizing rhetoric to endorse the assumption of personal responsibility for infection risk. I chose this campaign both because of its focus on the workplace and because its messages about risk and responsibility later saw replication in other states (for example, by the Michigan Department of Health).19 The Fifth Guy campaign includes an interactive website that hosts a series of public service announcements (PSAs). Together, these PSAs underscore the need for personal responsibility by dramatizing the tensions that arise when someone in the workplace ignores his duty to limit the spread of infection. Underlying the Fifth Guy, as I argue, is the message that infection risk is exacerbated mainly by the failure to assume personal responsibility. My close reading of the Fifth Guy also reveals an emphasis on feelings of anxiety, fear, and even self-doubt. As a stigmatizing rhetoric, the Fifth Guy foregrounds these negative emotions to shore up the value of personal responsibility\u2014in particular, its role in the maintenance of good health.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health\u2019s campaign employs the notion of the \u201cfifth guy\u201d to single out the person who ignores rather than assumes personal responsibility. (My references to the \u201cFifth Guy\u201d describe the campaign, whereas discussions of the \u201cfifth guy\u201d refer to its main character.) The campaign has a basis in a study conducted by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), which found that four out of five people do wash their hands after using the restroom. In this campaign, the fifth guy is not only male but also young, able-bodied, and white. The Fifth Guy seeks to \u201cillustrate a simple point\u2014most people respect certain hygienic norms.\u201d Those who do not observe these norms become \u201cthat one person everyone whispers about.\u201d Within the campaign\u2019s configuration of personal responsibility, displays of illness etiquette are represented as much measures of moral worth as they are forms of infection control. The \u201cfifth guy,\u201d further, is portrayed as at risk of both sickness and social quarantine\u2014exclusion from the group because he poses a threat to public health.\n\nTo stress the value of personal responsibility, video public service announcements (PSAs) both televised and posted online exaggerate as deviant the fifth guy\u2019s violation ignorance of a workplace\u2019s \u201chygienic norms.\u201d Played by comedic actor Ben Spring, the fifth guy is, not surprisingly, central to the campaign\u2019s narrative of personal responsibility. Two of the three PSAs showcase Ben\u2019s tendency to come to work sick, for him, a point of pride, and for his coworkers, a source of disdain. Ben also coughs and sneezes without covering his mouth and nose with his elbow. The videos \u201cCougher\u201d and \u201cSick at Home\u201d dedicate considerable footage to shots of Ben coughing into his hands, onto food in the lunchroom, during meetings, and in the faces of his fellow coworkers. Ben is quite clearly ignorant of his body as potentially\u2014and, in most instances, quite literally\u2014a source of infection risk to the people around him. However, the Fifth Guy is used to emphasize the necessity of his coworker\u2019s efforts to compensate for his ignorance. \u201cHow would I describe Ben to you? The next Black Plague,\u201d Ben\u2019s manager tells the camera in one PSA: \u201cThey\u2019re gonna say, \u2018How did it happen, was it rats?\u2019 No, it was Ben over at Amalgamated, responsible for the death of Europe.\u201d Ben\u2019s violations of the dictates of illness etiquette make him an object of disgust within his workplace. More importantly, when illness arises within a workplace, his coworkers come to regard Ben\u2019s body as its likeliest source.\n\nIn the Fifth Guy, attention is paid to Ben\u2019s body not as a site of sickness\u2014or, put differently, a site of suffering\u2014but as a site of infection risk. This situating of infection risk in individual bodies teaches the importance of avoidance of certain others as potentially (or, in Ben\u2019s case, it seems, inherently) vectors of infectious disease. Ben\u2019s coworkers leave the lunchroom when he enters, refuse to shake his hand or give him high fives, and send emails and issue prank calls urging him to go home. In other words, Ben is to be avoided because he embodies the risk of infection in public. So, in avoiding Ben, his coworkers assume personal responsibility for infection risk. Ben\u2019s failures in this respect in turn imply that those who succumb to infection have only themselves to blame, perhaps because they, too, ignored the dictates of illness etiquette.\n\nAvoidance and exclusion, however, are not the only strategies endorsed as both infection-control measures and displays of personal responsibility. In the Fifth Guy, hand hygiene represents a hedge against infection risk and its absence a violation of the dictum of personal responsibility. \u201cJust Another Day in the Office\u201d illustrates this dual function. In this PSA Ben\u2019s poor hand hygiene habits graphically come to life in the form of a urinal he carries around the office after leaving the restroom. In one scene, Ben proudly places his urinal on a coworker\u2019s desk while asking for some paperwork. In other scenes, he dances along the office\u2019s corridors, embracing his urinal in a mock tango. Depicting poor hand hygiene as a urinal makes some sense from the perspective of theories of fomite transmission of infection. These theories explain that, unless properly sanitized, inanimate materials or objects can become contaminated with infectious agents such as influenza virus. Similarly, poor hand hygiene\u2014or a lack of hand hygiene\u2014increases the likelihood of the transmission pathogens, both from contaminated surfaces to individuals and between individuals as well.20 Yet, the goal of Ben\u2019s urinal appears not to be to instruct the workers of Florida in the problem of fomite transmission. Instead, by emphasizing ignorance of illness etiquette as akin to intentionality, Ben\u2019s out-of-place urinal serves as an object lesson in hand hygiene as an expression of personal responsibility. Ben is stigmatized\u2014literally marked\u2014to distinguish him from those who observe their obligation to illness etiquette.\n\nCertainly, the Fifth Guy teaches hand hygiene as a display of personal responsibility. Yet the campaign also reveals another expectation of the new public health, and that is the enforcement of individual behavior change among the non-compliant. Frequently lacking the ability to confront him directly, Ben\u2019s coworkers take advantage of the opportunity to make their concerns known to the camera. \u201cYes, I\u2019d say he\u2019s a walking pandemic,\u201d the receptionist comments just seconds after Ben has left the restroom with his urinal-germs in tow. \u201cQuite frankly,\u201d says the coworker whose desk has been sullied by Ben\u2019s metaphorical urinal hands, \u201che scares me.\u201d Acknowledging that it can be difficult to reproach our colleagues, \u201cJust Another Day\u201d ends with the words of a voiceover narrator: \u201cFour out of five people wash their hands in the restroom. Could someone talk to the fifth guy?\u201d Strategies for doing so appear on the page of the \u201cFifth Guy\u201d website on which \u201cJust Another Day\u201d is posted. Tips include emailing your coworker one of the campaign videos with the comment, \u201cHey, sure glad you\u2019re nothing like this\u201d or giving him or her \u201ca new nickname like \u2018Big Loogie\u2019 or \u2018Thunder Cough\u2019.\u201d As these rather passive-aggressive strategies suggest, the assumption of personal responsibility for infection risk also involves participation in its enforcement.\n\nNevertheless, in using stigma to underscore personal responsibility, the Fifth Guy potentially both validates anxieties about infection risk and reassures that risk can always be managed. Those who regularly encounter infection in the workplace or witness hand-hygiene violations in public restrooms may feel vindicated by the campaign\u2019s mockery of Ben, the \u201coffice superspreader.\u201d After all, as the campaign implies, only careless people spread disease. With care, infection can invariably be avoided. The Fifth Guy\u2019s attributions of intentionality may be the campaign\u2019s most problematic feature and not simply because such attributions may be likely to exacerbate interpersonal conflicts within public settings. The use of a constitutive, stigmatizing rhetoric has consequences for shared perceptions of infection risk. It is to these perceptions that I now turn my attention.\n\nThree configurations of infection risk emerge from the Fifth Guy\u2019s encouragement of personal responsibility. First, the most serious risk depicted throughout the campaign is exposure to Ben, who is a \u201cwalking pandemic,\u201d possibly even the source of plague. In implying that infection risk is determined mainly by exposure to others, this configuration places undue emphasis on the need for hypervigilance in interpersonal interactions. In Ben\u2019s story, the assumption of personal responsibility for infection risk takes the form of a kind of citizen-epidemiology, with everyone working to root out sources of infection. Yet shy of engaging in self-quarantine, most people exercise only limited control over their exposure to others. Perhaps in recognition of this fact, the \u201cFifth Guy\u201d instructs in subtle pressures that might be applied to those individuals determined to be the potential source of infection\u2014for example, through stigma. Second, infection risk is determined largely by one\u2019s ability to control and manage certain behaviors. Conversely, failure to change habits increases our risk. Different scenes from the Fifth Guy illustrate this formulation of infection risk. Motivated by the threat of Ben\u2019s behavior, his coworkers more than once demonstrate for the camera different practices for limiting infection risk. In displaying their compliance with illness etiquette to the camera rather than to Ben, his colleagues indicate the necessity of habitual and bodily responses to the management of infection risk.\n\nA third assumption is underscored within the numerous texts that together form the campaign\u2019s overarching message about risk and responsibility. In the Fifth Guy, a lack of knowledge increases one\u2019s risk of infection. Ben, who displays ignorance of his duty to manage risk, teaches that being knowledgeable reduces the risk of infection (not to mention the threat of expulsion from the group). Other elements of the campaign reinforce this equation of knowledge with the assumption of responsibility for infection risk. Visitors to the \u201cFifth Guy\u201d website can, for example, take a quiz that tests their \u201chygiene IQ.\u201d Their scores determine \u201cwhich person\u201d they are in the workplace drama of illness and infection. Yet, as anyone who takes the quiz may quickly realize, it is only possible to either be the \u201cfifth guy\u201d (ignorant) or not the fifth guy (not ignorant). Users who select the incorrect answer to a series of five questions are also goaded to correct their mistakes by the message, \u201cWrong. Who are you, the fifth guy?\u201d Most of these wrong answers correspond with Ben\u2019s behaviors in different scenes from the campaign PSAs.\n\nThe didacticism of the campaign\u2019s testing of hygiene IQ raises the question: What knowledge, exactly, do audiences gain through exposure to the \u201cFifth Guy\u201d and campaigns like it? Perhaps most importantly, the formulation of knowledge as a defense against infection risk teaches an individualistic approach to risk management. Within this conception, the complex problem of emerging infectious diseases is most effectively resolved through personal transformations of our daily habits, not to mention of our relationships to one another.\n\nIn the coming decades, it seems likely that the containment of outbreaks will depend more and more on a program of risk communication that teaches individuals how to protect themselves against infection. Within the new public health, this focus on behavioral change is frequently regarded mainly as an alternative to the implementation of costlier, more comprehensive forms of protection, treatment, and care. Problematically, however, this encouragement of the personal responsibility for infection risk ignores the influence of contextual and environmental factors. Complex economic and social factors, from social support networks to gender, ethnicity, race, and culture, shape and determine the health of populations. Instead, even those campaigns that single out the person who (like Ben) does not adhere to the dictates of illness etiquette imply equality in our susceptibility to (or risk of) infection.\n\n1 For the full text of President Obama\u2019s remarks, see \u201cTranscript: President Obama\u2019s 100th-day press briefing\u201d (2009).\n\n2 See, for example, Ker\u00e4nen (2011); Angeli (2012); Ding (2014a; 2014b).\n\n3 Ker\u00e4nen also stresses a common interest in the formation of publics, not just through the \u201cofficial texts of biomedicine,\u201d but also through the practices they adopt in response to these texts (2014, 104).\n\n4 Wald (2008) in turn proposes the theory of the \u201coutbreak narrative\u201d to describe the influences of both media and popular culture on responses to infectious disease\u2014in particular, those responses that generate stigma or discrimination.\n\n5 In fact, for a decade prior to SARS, Purell languished in obscurity (Owen 2013, 30).\n\n6 See Sadler (2009), which incorporates critiques of hand-sanitizer use from health historians Jacalyn Duffin and Nancy Tomes, both of whom regard the product\u2019s popularity as tied to anxieties about infection risk.\n\n7 While worldwide sales figures vary from one source to another, a CNN story reports that shipments of hand sanitizer tripled during H1N1, from 1 million kilograms to 3 million kilograms (Rooney 2009). A more recent report (Fottrell 2013) states that U.S. sales of hand sanitizer reached $300 million in 2009, and have since averaged nearly $200 million per year.\n\n8 Plyushteva\u2019s (2009) critique of hand hygiene promotion in developing countries documents only the latest stage in a longer arc of handwashing campaigns developed to generate sales for hand soap. Vinikas (1989), for example, chronicles the creation by soapmakers of the 1920s and 1930s of the Cleaning Institute, which worked to increase soap sales by inculcating schoolchildren into personal hygiene habits. See, also, Vinikas (1995), which illuminates the significance to modern advertising of early-twentieth-century efforts to promote personal hygiene.\n\n9 For the full text of this press release, see Royal Society for the Protection of Nature, \u201cGlobal Handwashing Day observed in Yoeseltse MSS in Samtse.\u201d\n\n10 The quotations in this paragraph derive from GlobalHandwashing.org, the website for the Global PPPHW.\n\n11 For a recent systematic review of the impact of hand hygiene promotion in developing countries, see Freeman et al. (2014). Note that many of the researchers who contribute to this study have ties to the Global PPPHW.\n\n12 Sridhar (2003), whom Plyushteva quotes, openly criticizes hand hygiene promotion in Kerala as a poor substitute for structural interventions, such as the improvement of sanitation systems or provision of clean water.\n\n13 Another important historical precursor to Plyushteva\u2019s critique is Tomes, which documents the work of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century public health advocates to transform lay understandings of the spread of infection. Tomes points out that \u201centrepreneurs and manufacturers . . . [quickly realized] that the fear of the microbe could be effectively exploited to sell a wealth of goods and services\u201d (1998, 11).\n\n14 See, for example, Curtis\u2019s (2011) review of the emerging body of scholarship on the use of public health discourse to trigger a disgust response in order to motivate individual behavior change.\n\n15 My view of health citizenship derives mainly from Petersen and Lupton (1996), but it also has loose ties to Rose and Novas\u2019 (2005) notion of biological citizenship.\n\n16 Specifically, Charland (1987) argues that before the 1980 provincial referendum the government of Quebec sought support for Quebec\u2019s separation from Canada by constituting the province\u2019s inhabitants as \u201ca distinct peuple.\u201d By voting in support of separation, inhabitants signaled their interpellation into and identification with the peuple qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n\n17 A constitutive perspective is also consistent with Foucault\u2019s theory of subjectivity formation. For a discussion of Foucault\u2019s significance to health humanities, see Petersen (2003).\n\n18 A persuasive example of constitutive rhetoric is a poster created by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which instructs Americans to \u201cKeep Calm and Wash [their] Hands,\u201d implying that in washing their hands, citizens consent to their duty to cooperate in the event of an outbreak. See \u201cHealth Promotion Materials\u201d (2016).\n\n19 The Fifth Guy campaign has also been the subject of social-marketing case studies. See, e.g., Plourde, et al. (2008).\n\n20 For an example from popular culture, take the deadly virus in Steven Soderburgh\u2019s medical thriller, Contagion (2011), which is transmitted by fomites.
