The average number of days from diagnosis to cure?\n\nAnswer: In the stage of Hubei epidemic, it takes an average of 21 days for patients from diagnosis to cure. (Fig. 1) \uf0fc International epidemic situation except China 8). How to predict the epidemic situation in South Korea?\n\nAnswer: At present, the epidemic situation in South Korea is basically under control. According to the model, South Korea will be basically under control by the end of March. It was found on January 7 that there was infection in South Korea (confirmed by official broadcast January 20. In addition, we found that the basic reproduction number before the control was 4.2 in Korea and 0.1 after the control. Answer: At present, 11,000 people are infected in Iran. Our model predicts that it will reach 20,000 people at the end of March, Through backward inference of the epidemic situation, we found that Iran had an infection on January 13 (officially reporting that two cases died on February 20, and there was no official data before).\n\nThe model found that the basic reproduction number in Iran before the control was 4.0 and after the control was 0.2. (The Iranian government took many measures in early March.) ( Fig. 9) \n\nThe epidemic data of Hubei Province is large [1], more in line with the statistical law, and the statistical model is more able to reflect the process of virus transmission, so we build a statistical model for the epidemic situation of Hubei Province (see the method section later for details). Based on the data provided by National Health Commission of China(NHCC), we have carried out accurate simulation. By comparing the simulation results with the real data, we analyze the propagation process and its influencing factors.\n\nAccording to the comparison between the official epidemic data and simulation data of Hubei Province (see Figure 1 for details), we can see that the model simulation curve of the number of confirmed infections, the number of cured people and the number of dead people matches the official data curve very well. According to the curve of simulated number of infected persons and the curve of official number of infected persons, we can see that there is a certain gap between the number of infected persons before February 12, and the others are basically the same. (after the official announced the method of clinical diagnosis of pneumonia on February 12, the data on that day surged to 14000, indicating that the official data had some omissions before February 12, and our model give a more accurate response to the number of actual cases). \n\nAccording to the curve of simulated infection number, we infer that by the end of March (yellow line + light blue line = dark blue line\uff1a Number of simulated cures+ Number of simulated deaths= Number of simulated infections), all cases will be basically treated, that is to say, more than 10000 cases in Hubei will be basically cured and cleared. Note: the number of cases of infection on December 24 is not zero. Because the data in Figure 1 is too large, small data cannot be displayed. For this reason, according to the same distribution curve, we also give the simulation data results before December 24, and the simulation found that the initial infected people .

The first confirmed infection was reported on December 8 [2].\n\nBackward graph of initial epidemic curve.\n\nAccording to the comparison chart of the average number of people infected with a single infection (The basic reproduction number) (Figure 3 ), we found that the basic reproduction number had a great impact on the spread of the epidemic. With the increase of basic reproduction number, the total number of infected people will be more and more, and the larger the basic reproduction number, the faster the disease will spread. We set the basic reproduction number in the range of 3 -4.6 for simulation. It is found that when the basic reproduction number is 3.8, the simulated curve (yellow line) is better close to the official confirmed number curve (red line), that is to say, the real basic reproduction number in Wuhan should be 3.8. However, some scholars put forward the basic reproduction number between (2.8, 3.9), and others put forward the basic reproduction number of 2.2 [3] . .

We simulated the days in the range of 3-9 respectively, and found that when the average incubation period was set to 6 days, it could better fit the official curve, while the other simulated values are quite different from the official curves. It is also found that the shorter the incubation period, the faster the virus spreads and the greater the total number of infections. David mentioned that the incubation period of the virus is 3-6 days, which is not accurate.\n\nAccording to the previous analysis, the disease develops on average after 6 days of incubation, and it takes an average of 5 days from the morbidity to the diagnosis (data from CHCC)[4], that is, 5 + 6 = 11 days from the initial infection and incubation to the diagnosis and isolation after the morbidity. Obviously, not all 11 days are contagious. Simulations show that when the average time for contagion is set to 8 days, it fits the official curve best. \n\nWe know that epidemic control at different times (such as closing city) will have an important impact on the spread of the epidemic, obviously the earlier the better. Combined with the actual situation of Wuhan's closure from January 23, we simulated the comparison of the spread of the epidemic situation on January 18 and January 28, as shown in Figure 5 . The red curve and the orange curve in the figure respectively represent the official curve and the simulation curve (when the \"cities were closed\" measures were taken on January 23). Obviously, the two curves match well, and the simulated final number of infected people is 69000, which is also close to the actual situation. If the control is started five days in advance, that is, on January 18, the blue line shows that the number of infected people is about 28000, which is 0.42 times of the number of confirmed cases. If the measures are delayed for 5 days, it can be seen from the yellow line that the number of people will be as high as 156000, about 2.26 times of the current number of patients. Zhong Nanshan's team once predicted that if the closure measures were delayed for five days, the number of patients would reach three times of the current number, i.e. 210000 [5] . Our results are more optimistic. It can be seen from this figure that it is necessary to take timely measures to control the spread of the epidemic, which can also be used as a reference for some overseas countries. \n\nWe also studied the curve of the daily increase in the number of people( Figure 6 ). Because the official did not include the imaging features of pneumonia in the clinical diagnosis into the diagnosis conditions for statistics before February 12, 2020, the omission and inaccuracy of the previous data caused the official data to jump on the February 12 (the number of newly diagnosed patients in Hubei was 14840 people).As shown in Figure 6 , our simulation data meet the normal distribution, at this time, the daily new infection data peaked on February 8, with the number of 4500. However, the published data, due to not timely included in the clinical diagnosis image test (red line), many patients were not diagnosed, but the curve has become a downward trend, data deviation. For this reason, we smoothed the clinical diagnosis data on February 12, 13 and 14, and used the Gauss function of latent period. These three days were chosen because of the sudden increase of the number of clinical diagnosis in these three days. It can be seen from the figure that the smooth number of official daily infected persons (black line) and the simulation curve (blue line) fit very well. \n\nFrom March 2, South Korea began to implement large-scale measures to prevent and control the epidemic situation [6] . At present, the epidemic situation in South Korea is basically under control. Our model simulates the actual data well, and it is found through model prediction (Figure 7) . That South Korea will be basically controlled by the end of March. We inferred from the curve and found that there was an infection in South Korea on January 7 (the official broadcast confirmed the diagnosis at January 20). We found that before the control, the basic reproduction number of virus transmission in Korea was 4.2, and the basic reproduction number after control was 0.1. (The basic reproduction number reached 4.2. We suspect that some churches in South Korea ignored the spread of the epidemic in the early stage.) .

Through simulation, we find that (Figure 8 \n\nCurrently, 11000 people are infected in Iran. According to the simulation, as shown in Figure 9 , the infection data is expected to reach 20000 by the end of March, and then it will be basically controlled by the beginning of April. It was found that Iran had infection on January 13 (Officially announced 2 cases died on February 20, no previous official data) [8] . The model found that the basic reproduction number of virus transmission in Iran before control was 4.0, and the basic reproduction number after control was 0.2. (the Iranian government took many control measures in early March. The basic reproduction number after control is 0.2, indicating that the control effect is not ideal.) \n\nMany studies have shown that virological transmission usually satisfies the Gaussian distribution, so this article uses the Gaussian distribution to analyze the transmission of viruses [9] [10] . When we use Gaussian distribution to simulate, the main influence is the average value, but the standard deviation has little influence, so we will take the best accord with the objective fact variance to simulate. The basic reproduction number is the number of people infected by a patient during the average illness period when all are susceptible at the morbidity of the disease. The Gaussian distribution function of D1~N(x1,y1) is used to represent the propagation ability of the virus. This formula indicates that a single infected person can infect x1 person on average in the first stage. At this stage, x1 has a value range of (1,+ \u221e), and a standard deviation of y1=1.5.\n\nWith the development of a series of effective measures, the daily increase of the number of infected people also decreased to a certain extent, and the transmission ability of the disease in the population decreased. For the ability to spread disease through this process, we still use the Gaussian distribution. When a single infected person at this stage is able to infect an average of x2 individuals, the formula for the capacity to transmit is, D2~N(x2,y2). At this stage, the value range of x2 is general (0,1], standard deviation of x2 is y2=2*x2. Because the medical condition of affected area and the degree of people's activity intention directly decide the basic regeneration number in this stage. The better the health care, the less active the population, the smaller the x2.\n\nIn the course of disease transmission, the patient from being infected to the morbidity of disease, we call it incubation period. We assume that it takes x3 days for people to get infected and become aware of the disease, then the incubation period follows D3~N(x3,y3). In this model x3=6.0, the standard deviation y3=2.0. In addition, patients can transmit the virus to other people, so we assume that the average time from infection to transmission is x4 days, which follows D4~N(x4,y4). According to the previous analysis, the disease develops after an average of six days of incubation, and it takes an average of five days from morbidity to diagnosis (according to NHCC) , that is, 5 + 6 = 11 days from the initial incubation of infection to post-morbidity isolation. Clearly, not all 11 days are infectious, and simulations show that setting the average number of infectious days to 8 best fits the official curve. In this model x4=8.0, the standard deviation y4=1.5.\n\nThe cure time of the patient is the difference between the time of hospital discharge and the time of diagnosis, set to x5. During the epidemic period, the cure time of patients was expressed by Gaussian distribution, that is, D5~N(x5,y5), which means that it takes an average of x5 days for a single individual to be cured and discharged from hospital. During the early and late stages of the epidemic, depending on the medical condition and level of vigilance, there will be small changes to the x5. As the epidemic continued, people's awareness of self-protection became stronger, and hospital treatment became more effective in the late stage of the outbreak, the patient's recovery time became shorter and shorter. In Hubei Province, the average time from diagnosis to cure was 21 days.\n\nRelative to the spread of previous diseases, the early mortality rate of this disease is also very high, mainly due to the lack of understanding of the new virus, and secondly, the new crown virus transmission is very strong, leading to the collapse of the medical system in the epidemic area. Due to the continuous improvement of medical conditions and other reasons, the mortality rate of the disease has continued to ease. We assume that the mortality rate is x6, then the mortality distribution follows D6~N(x6,y6). The mortality rate will change in stages depending on medical conditions. According to the CHCC, Hubei Province's current mortality rate is 4.5 percent.\n\nIn this paper, through analyzing the existing data of Hubei epidemic situation [11] , the corresponding model is established, and then the simulation is carried out.

What's more, we predicted the evolution trend of the existing epidemic data, and found that imposing controls would have important impact on the epidemic [12] . In addition, according to the existing data abroad, we also make bold predictions of the epidemic development trends in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, pointing out the possible outbreaks and the corresponding control time, and tracing the earliest transmission dates of countries. Finally, we hope that this article can make some contributions to the world's response to this epidemic and give some references for future research."}
