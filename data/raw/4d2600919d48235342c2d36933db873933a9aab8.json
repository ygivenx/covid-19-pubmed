{"title": "Triage assessment of cardiorespiratory risk status based on measurement of the anaerobic threshold, and estimation by patient-reported activity limitation", "body": "umbrella of \"pre-existing medical conditions\". There is particular concern that as for health insurance, 38 lack of familiarity with rare diseases may lead to an inappropriately negative weighting, with no time 39 to redress in an acute triage setting.\n\nIn pre-operative assessments, anaesthetists increasingly use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) 42 to identify patients who may be unable to appropriately respond to increased cardiorespiratory demands 43 of surgery due to reduced cardiorespiratory reserve. [1, 2] The CPET-derived measure of anaerobic 44 threshold (AT) of <11 ml.min -1 kg -1 has been identified in multiple studies and systematic reviews to 45 be associated with adverse outcomes, mortality, and longer lengths of stay in a variety of surgeries, 46 including intra-abdominal and intra-thoracic procedures. [2] [3] [4] The AT represents the point where ATP generation cannot be met by mitochondrial metabolism. It is considered a good measure as it reflects 48 oxygen delivery and patient conditioning, and is not dependent on the patient's motivation during 49 exercise. [2] 50 51\n\nThe rapid assessment tool selected for evaluation was the Veteran's Specific Activity Questionnaire \n\nPatients with pulmonary AVMs can demonstrate pronounced physiological abnormalities, including 61 significant hypoxaemia, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] increased minute ventilation ( V\u0307E) for given increases in CO2 62 production (V\u0307E/ V\u0307CO2 slope) [16, 17] , high cardiac output states [19] , and often iron deficiency and 63 anaemia due to inadequate replacement of haemorrhagic iron losses from underlying hereditary 64 haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) [20, 21] There is no published guidance on management of individuals with pulmonary AVMs or HHT undergoing anaesthesia, and each year, our service receives 66 requests regarding suitability for surgery and insurance, and/or reports that surgery or insurance has 67 been withheld because of the perceived risks of pulmonary AVMs/HHT.\n\nOur goal was to evaluate commonly used assessment criteria, and examine the potential role for a rapid 70 assessment tool that could distinguish lower risk individuals in an emergency setting, based on usual 71 cardiorespiratory status. The detailed study aims were to explore which variables may be associated 72 with cardiorespiratory risk defined by the anaerobic threshold in order to inform triage and develop 73 approaches to help guide pre-exposure [23] or pre-operative [1] [2] [3] [4] 10] \n\nThe CPET-evaluated total oxygen consumption at peak exercise (peak V\u0307O2) has also been used for high \n\nWe concluded that assuming the study had sufficient power, neither age, nor more surprisingly SpO2 as \n\nOther measurements that were associated with the higher risk status were higher serum bicarbonate and \n\nWe used the derived relationship between and AT and VSAQ to model the expected cut off by age on 231 the VSAQ that might indicate an individual in a lower risk category based on the established AT of 11 232 ml.min -1 .kg -1 . As noted in Figure 4 , this differs by patient age such that a VSAQ of 8 would be 233 All rights reserved.

In younger individuals, lower risk would be assigned even in the setting of more 236 limited exercise capacity, (VSAQ 4-7, NYHA II). In other words, the VSAQ provided sufficient 237 granularity to indicate where age-related physiology would be 'offset' in particularly active older adults, 238 and where there may be more concern for a much less active younger individual.\n\nDiscussion 241\n\nWe demonstrate that high proportions of patients with a label that might be expected to mean \"pre-243 existing cardio-respiratory condition\" do not fall into classical high risk categories when more carefully 244 evaluated. Furthermore, baseline age and SpO2 were not associated with the anaerobic threshold and 245 therefore cardiorespiratory risk status in continuous, or categorical analyses. However, lower 246 haemoglobin, and haemoglobin-dependent indices of arterial oxygen content and delivery were 247 important predictors of lower anaerobic threshold and a higher risk state: our post hoc calculations 248 suggested increasing haemoglobin by 2.5 g.dL -1 could have moved nearly two-thirds of the high risk group into a lower risk category. We also demonstrate that a simple patient-based metric, the VSAQ, 250 could allocate patients to lower and higher cardiorespiratory risk categories as based on the anaerobic 251 threshold of <11 ml.min -1 kg -1 .\n\nThe study numbers are small but notably demonstrated non-overlapping confidence intervals for key 254 variables of oxygen tissue delivery. The current findings build on substantial previously published data 255 and analyses on pulmonary AVM [16, 17] and general population [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is The lowest 10 VSAQ scores and associated exercise limitations are plotted against age. Horizontal bands indicate the respective New York Heart Association (NYHA [25] ) categories of I (no symptoms on ordinary physical activity), II (limited on ordinary activity), III (limited at 20-100m), and IV (limited at rest). To indicate lower and higher risk categories, the regression line is plotted for an anaerobic threshold of 11 ml.min -1 .kg -1 . To provide an indication of confidence limits, and the direction and scale of variation if this threshold scale were to be adjusted, regression lines for anaerobic thresholds of 10 and 12 ml.min -1 .kg -1 are also plotted."}
