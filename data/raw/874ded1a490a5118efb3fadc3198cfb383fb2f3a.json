{"title": "Structure-based design and synthesis of triazole-based macrocyclic inhibitors of norovirus protease: Structural, biochemical, spectroscopic, and antiviral studies", "body": "Noroviruses are the leading cause of foodborne illness in the U.S., accounting for >21 million infections per year and resulting in >70,000 hospitalizations and nearly 800 deaths [1e3] . They are also the primary cause of sporadic and epidemic acute gastroenteritis worldwide [4e5] . The morbidity and mortality associated with norovirus infection impacts disproportionately the elderly, immunocompromised individuals [6] and, in developing countries, children [7] . Combating noroviruses presents a major challenge because noroviruses are highly contagious, genetically diverse, environmentally stable, display prolonged and profuse viral shedding, evolve rapidly, and are capable of spreading in many different ways [8e9] . There are currently no effective vaccines or norovirus-specific antivirals for norovirus infection. Consequently, there is a pressing need for the discovery and development of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment and prophylaxis of norovirus infection [10e13] .\n\nNorovirus is an RNA virus that belongs to the Norovirus genus of the Caliciviridae family. It carries a positive sense single stranded RNA genome (7.7 Kb) that consists of three open reading frames (ORF1-3). ORF1 encodes a 200 kDa precursor polyprotein which is processed by a virus-encoded cysteine endopeptidase to generate at least six mature non-structural proteins [14e16] . Polyprotein processing by norovirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is vital for the replication of the virus, consequently, norovirus 3CLpro has emerged as an attractive target for the discovery and development of antiviral agents against norovirus infections [10e11,17] .\n\nNorovirus 3CLpro is a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease with an active site consisting of the catalytic triad of Cys139, His30 and Glu54 and located in a groove that is sandwiched between a bsheet domain and a b-barrel domain [17e21] . The b-barrel domain accounts for most of the binding interactions involved between a peptide substrate and 3CLpro. A hallmark of norovirus 3CLpro, as well as other related 3C or 3CL viral proteases, is that its primary substrate specificity is dictated by the presence of a P 1 glutamine (and less frequently glutamic acid), at the S 1 subsite [22] . Furthermore, previous studies involving the mapping of the substrate specificity of 3CLpro have revealed that the protease prefers small hydrophobic amino acids such as a leucine residue at P 2 and that the plasticity of its S 3 subsite allows the protease to accommodate His, Gln or Glu [16, 18, 19] .\n\nIn continuing our studies in this area [12, 13, 17, 23] , we describe herein the structure-based design of cell-permeable macrocyclic transition state inhibitors (I) and (II) (Fig. 1 ) of norovirus 3CLpro [23, 24] , as well as relevant structural, biochemical, spectroscopic, and cell-based studies.\n\nInspection of crystal structures of norovirus 3CLpro with peptidyl inhibitors reveals that peptidyl inhibitors of norovirus 3CLpro bind to the enzyme via a network of backbone hydrogen bonds that mimic an antiparallel b-sheet [25, 26] . Among these hydrogen bonds, the backbone NH and carbonyl O of the Ala160 residue forms two hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl O and NH of the P 3 residue of the inhibitor ( Fig. 2A) . In addition, a third hydrogen bond exists between the backbone O of the Ala158 residue and the backbone NH of the P 1 residue of the inhibitor. This hydrogen bonding arrangement resembles the hydrogen bonding pattern found in antiparallel b-sheets and serves to correctly orient and position the inhibitor (or substrate) backbone to the active site.\n\nThe hydrogen bonding associated with an antiparallel b-sheet is more feasible when an inhibitor (or substrate) binds to the active site of a protease in a b-strand conformation, the extended \"saw tooth\" conformation of a peptide (f \u00bc \u00c0120 \u00b1 20 0 and j \u00bc \u00fe120 \u00b1 20 0 ) where the backbone NHs are exposed to the environment [27] . As a consequence, the aforementioned binding mode permits proteases to universally recognize their ligands in the b-strand conformation [25, 26] .\n\nBased on the forgoing, we recently reported the results of preliminary studies related to the design of triazole-based macrocyclic inhibitors of 3C and 3C-like proteases of picornavirus, norovirus and coronavirus [24] . Macrocyclization of linear peptidyl inhibitors was accomplished by tethering the P 1 and P 3 residues of the linear inhibitor by a suitable linker, thereby pre-organizing the macrocycle in a b-strand conformation prior to binding to the enzyme active site (Fig. 2B) [27, 28] . This approach results in the formation of a pre-organized and semi-rigid entity that displays the amino acid side chains in a well-defined vector relationship for optimal binding and enhances the affinity of the inhibitor to the target enzyme by minimizing the entropy loss upon binding. Additional potential advantages of macrocyclic inhibitors include high stability to metabolizing enzymes, high selectivity and, frequently, increased cellular permeability [29e32] . We describe herein the structurebased design of macrocyclic inhibitors of norovirus 3CLpro where the side chain of the P 1 Gln primary substrate specificity residue is tethered to the P 3 residue via a triazole linker to yield macrocycles (I) (Fig. 1) and explore the effect of ring size on conformation and its impact on pharmacological activity using high field NMR and X-ray crystallographic studies. We also report the first examples of macrocyclic inhibitors of norovirus 3CLpro that are cellurarly permeable.\n\nThe synthesis of macrocyclic compounds 1e11 (Table 1) was accomplished by first constructing key intermediates 15aec, 18aee, 19aee, and 20aeb using well-established methodologies (Scheme 1). The commercially available N-Boc protected L-propargylglycine was reacted with L-leucine methylester, L-cyclohexylalanine methyl ester or L-phenylalanine methyl ester, in the presence of EDCI and HOBt to provide the corresponding dipeptide esters. Deblocking of the resulting esters was accomplished by treatment with 4 M HCl in dioxane. The resulting amine hydrochlorides were reacted with benzylchloroformate followed by LiOH to yield the corresponding N-Cbz protected dipeptide acid intermediates 15aec. Preparation of the HCl salts of amino azides 18aee was effected by sequential reaction of commercially available N-Boc protected amino alcohols with methanesulfonyl chloride and sodium azide followed by deprotection with 4 M HCl in dioxane. Coupling of N-Boc protected glutamic acid with the corresponding HCl salts of amino azides 18aee in the presence of EDCI and HOBt gave intermediates 19aee, in good yields.\n\nThe macrocyclization step was effected in two different ways. Specifically, the synthesis of macrocycles 2e3 entailed click chemistry-mediated macrocyclization using intermediates 15aec and 20aeb (Scheme 2), while compounds 1 and 4e11 were obtained through macrolactamization starting with key intermediates 15aec and 19aee (Scheme 3). In general, the macrolactamization methodology was found to be superior, particularly in terms of ease of purification of the resultant cyclized products. Intermediates 15a and 20aeb were coupled in the presence of EDCI and HOBt to yield the corresponding linear precursors 24a and 24b of the macrocyclic esters 25a and 25b. Intramolecular click reactions of the linear precursors 24aeb were carried out using a CuI/DBU mixture in dichloromethane under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature for 24 h to provide macrocyclic esters 25aeb in fairly good yields (45e50%). Intermediates 15aec and 19aee were coupled using intermolecular click reaction in the presence of CuSO 4 and sodium ascorbate in THF/H 2 O solution to obtain the corresponding linear precursors 27aei of macrocyclic esters 28aei. Macrolactamization of compounds 27aei was carried out using EDCI and HOBt in DMF at room temperature for 24 h to yield macrocyclic esters 28aei in good yields (~60%). In both cyclization methods, the dilution factor of the reaction mixture was critical in controlling the intramolecular cyclization reaction over the intermolecular reaction. Reduction of macrocyclic esters using LiBH 4 followed by DesseMartin periodinane oxidation provided the corresponding macrocyclic aldehydes 1e11 in fairly good yields (~50%).\n\nThe orientation of the triazole ring and its effect on pharmacological activity and conformation was probed by synthesizing macrocycle 12, via intermediates 21 and 23, as illustrated in Scheme 4. The acyclic variant of macrocycle 3 was synthesized according to Scheme 5 in order to determine the effect of macrocyclization on antiviral activity. As dictated by the primary substrate specificity of norovirus 3CLpro, the P 1 Gln residue remained invariant in all synthesized inhibitors. Furthermore, norovirus 3CLpro prefers a P 2 Leu or Cha [12,23a-c] , consequently, the convergent nature of the synthetic plan allowed for variations in the P 2 residue via the judicious selection of appropriate natural or unnatural amino acid esters, thereby permitting the targeting of related viral proteases in the and Coronaviridae families.\n\nThe inhibitory activity of compounds 1e12 against norovirus 3CLpro in vitro and norovirus in a cell-based replicon system was evaluated as previously described [12, 13] and the results are summarized in Table 1 .\n\nIn order to establish the precise mechanism of action of inhibitors (I) and gain insight and understanding into the structural determinants that impact potency and permeability that can be used to facilitate the structure-guided optimization of pharmacological activity, high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of NV 3CLpro with bound inhibitors 1, 3, and 10 were determined. Attempts to obtain crystal structures of permeable inhibitors 7 and 8 were unsuccessful, precluding a structural comparison between the permeable and non-permeable macrocyclic inhibitors that might perhaps illuminate the structural determinants responsible for the observed differences in potency and cellular permeability. Examination of the active site revealed the presence of an antiparallel b-sheet-like hydrogen bonding network associated with the backbone of all three inhibitors, covalently bound to the catalytic Cys139 residue (Fig. 3) . The coordinates of the Ramachandran plot (see Fig. S8 in Supporting information) of six f and j angle pairs of the corresponding P 2 and P 3 residues, extracted from the X-ray crystal structures, lie in the upper left quadrant of the plot, indicating that bound inhibitors 1, 3, and 10 assume an extended b-strand conformation. The pseudo f angles of the P 1 residue covalently bound to the Cys139 residue range from \u00c0129.5 to \u00c0137.8 . The electron density maps for the three bound inhibitors are shown in Fig. 4AeC . As expected, the backbones of all three inhibitors are structurally more rigid compared to the atoms forming the macrocyclic linker, which is more flexible. This is evident from an analysis of the B-factors for the inhibitors in each structure, which are slightly lower in the backbone region as shown in the right panels of Fig. 4AeC . The electron density for the \"cap\" phenyl ring was not observed for 1 and 3 due to disorder and could not be modeled, while inhibitor 10 has somewhat weak electron density that permitted modeling of the phenyl ring. The triazole ring of inhibitor 3 has reasonable electron density, however, it is more disordered and its exact orientation is not clearly discernible (Fig. 4) . Perusal of Table 1 indicates that, with the exception of compounds 8 and 11, the rest of the compounds displayed low micromolar IC 50 values. The observed degree of inhibition prompted us to delineate the structural determinants associated with binding in order to gain insight and understanding into the relative potency of the inhibitors. Toward that end, superposition with GESAMT [33] of the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the NV 3CLpro:10 complex (largest ring size) with the NV 3CLPro:1 complex (smallest ring size) shows that the enzyme structures in both complexes are similar, with an RMSD between Ca atoms of 0.76 \u00c5 (167 residues), except for the flexible loop spanning Lys121 to Glu140 (Fig. 5A ). The binding of inhibitor 10 (larger ring size) to the active site is accompanied by the movement of the flexible loop away from the inhibitor resulting in the loss of a hydrogen bond between the P 1 side chain (Gln C]O) of the inhibitor with Thr134 (backbone NH) which forms the S 1 pocket. His157, which is the other constituent of the S 1 pocket but is not a part of the flexible loop, maintains a hydrogen bond interaction with the P 1 Gln C]O (Fig. 5B ). It should be noted that the interaction of NV 3CLpro with acyclic dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl inhibitors involves the formation of two crucial hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl oxygen of the glutamine surrogate C]O in the inhibitor and the Thr134 and His157 residues [12] . These two hydrogen bonding interactions, as well as the flexible backbone of the T123-G133 loop [34] , appear to play a critical role in enzyme-substrate recognition and are conserved in all norovirus proteases. Thus, in the NV 3CLpro:1 complex, the movement of the flexible loop and the shorter linker length of the inhibitor which positions the carbonyl oxygen of the P 1 Gln side chain away from His157 and Thr134, results in the loss of the Thr134 P 1 Gln C]O hydrogen bond (Fig. 5C) . Conversely, the binding of inhibitor 1 allows the flexible loop to move closer to the inhibitor such that a contact can be formed (3.3 \u00c5) between Pro136 and the carbonyl oxygen of the warhead (Fig. 5B ). The compact nature of the inhibitor positions the NH group of the P 1 Gln side chain within hydrogen bonding distance (3.2 \u00c5) of the carbonyl oxygen of the Ala160 residue (see Fig. S1 in Supporting information for distance information related to the hydrogen bonds). The subtle structural shifts associated with the P1 Gln side chain may account for the lower inhibitory activity observed with this series of macrocyclic triazole compounds, as compared to previously reported triazole-based macrocyclic calpain inhibitors [35] specifically and macrocyclic inhibitors generally [29e31]. In the former case, potency is solely dependent on the combined effect of hydrophobic interactions and the network of hydrogen bonding interactions between the inhibitor backbone and the enzyme active site which is facilitated by the b-strand conformation of the inhibitor.\n\nThe enhancement in the IC 50 values associated with the replacement of the P 2 isobutyl side chain with a cyclohexyl group observed with linear dipeptidyl inhibitors [12] is diminished in compound 10 (IC 50 6.1 mM) and is partly due to the loss of the key hydrogen bonding interaction with Thr134, as revealed by the X-ray crystal structure and the larger flexible ring (see discussion of NMR studies). On the other hand, as mentioned above, the compact, rigid ring structure and the additional hydrogen bond with Ala160, discernible from the X-ray crystal structure, may account for the 4fold decrease in the IC 50 value (1.6 mM) of compound 1 as compared to compound 10. The in vitro inhibitory activity of compounds 1 and 3 which form the same number of direct hydrogen bonds with the enzyme (7 hydrogen bonds) was found to be 1.6 mM and 2.4 mM, respectively. Interestingly, compound 34, the acyclic variant of compound 3, was devoid of any inhibitory activity. Finally, the 18membered macrocycle 12 ( Fig. 1 ) in which the triazole ring was constructed in a reverse fashion and presumably assumes a different orientation than inhibitors 1e11, was effective against In summary, the interaction of macrocyclic inhibitors (I) with NV 3CLpro induces conformational changes in the flexible loop and active site of the enzyme which are dependent on macrocycle ring size and structure. These changes result in sub-optimal angles and distances in forming the critical intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the P1 Gln side chain and the active site His157 and Thr134 residues, consequently, maximal binding potency and effective compensation for the energy penalty required to desolvate the molecule, are not attained.\n\nIn order to gain further insight into the solution conformation and binding of the synthesized macrocyclic inhibitors, as well as confirm the absence of alternate structures, NMR studies were carried out using the precursor cyclic esters. Assignment of the proton resonances was done using 1 H, COSY, ROESY and HMBC spectral details. The ROESY spectra of the compounds show H ia to NH (i \u00fe 1) type correlation, where the Gln and Leu NH show correlation to the Leu Ha and carbamate Ha, respectively (see Figs. S1eS5 in Supporting information). This observation is indicative of a prearranged structure within the macrocycle [28] . The temperature dependence of amide NH chemical shifts experiments were performed using compounds 28a (ring size: 17), 28e (ring size: 20) and 28g (ring size: 21), revealing important information about the solution structures of the macrocycles. Solvent shielded NH protons typically have Dd/T values less than 4 ppb/K while solvent exposed NH protons have Dd/T values greater than 4 ppb/K [28] . According to the results, the Gln, Leu, and propargylglycine NH protons have Dd/T values greater than 4 ppb/K in all cases (Table 3) . At larger ring sizes, the carbamate NH shows a higher temperature dependence (\u00c07.0 and 6.4 ppb/K for ring sizes 20 and 21, respectively), indicating greater solvent exposure. However, for smaller ring size it shows comparatively low temperature dependence (4.2 ppb/K at 17 ring size), indicating less solvent exposure. This is further supported by the observed line broadening of the carbamate NH proton at elevated temperatures for compounds 28e and 28g, and the lower line broadening observed for 28a ( Fig. S6 in Supporting information). Previous studies have shown that amide signals exchanging with water impurity present in DMSO solvent show considerable broadening of the line width at elevated temperatures due to the enhanced exchange rate at higher temperatures [28] . At smaller ring size, all three NH protons show less temperature dependence, indicating solvent shielding which is partly due to the compact nature of the compound. The absence of very low temperature dependent NH protons (~2 ppb/K) would appear to rule out the presence of alternative turn structures, such as g-turns. Finally, the conformations of the peptide backbone of macrocycles 28a and 28h were determined based on 1D 3 J NH-CHa coupling constants ( Table 4 ). The coupling constant 3 J NH-CHa correlates with the dihedral angle (j) according to the Karplus equation [28] . For unstructured random coil conformations the coupling constant is around 7 Hz while unusually high coupling constants (>9 Hz) are observed for well-structured b-strands. According to the results shown in Table 4 , the expected b-strand conformation was observed only for the 17-membered ring.\n\nThe studies described herein demonstrate the feasibility of generating cell-permeable triazole-based macrocyclic inhibitors of norovirus 3CL protease. Valuable insights into the mechanism of action, conformation, and pharmacological activity were gained using an array of structural, spectroscopic, and antiviral techniques and methodologies. The interaction of inhibitor (I) with NV 3CLpro results in subtle structural shifts in the active site topography that impair hydrogen bonding interactions between the P1 Gln residue in the inhibitor and key amino acid residues and contribute to lower pharmacological activity. The results of ongoing studies are likely to illuminate further the interplay of ring size, conformation, and cellular permeability, and will reported in due course.\n\nReagents and dry solvents were purchased from various chemical suppliers (Aldrich, Acros Organics, ChemImpex, TCI America, and Bachem) and were used as obtained.

Each compound was evaluated for anti-3CLpro effects up to 100 mM. For the cell based assay, one day old HG23 cells (NV replicon harboring cells) were treated with various concentrations (1.0e100 mM) of each compound, and incubated for 48 h. Then total RNA was extracted from cells for qRT-PCR for norovirus and b-actin. The EC 50 (50% inhibitory concentration in cell based assay) of each compound was calculated by the % reduction of RNA levels to Mock-treated cells after normalized with b-actin levels. Cell cytotoxicity using HG23 was measured by a CytoTox96\u00ae nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with serial dilution of each compound up to 100 mM following the manufacturer's instructions. The CC 50 (50% cytotoxic concentration) was determined for each compound. The IC 50 , EC 50 and CC 50 values were determined by at least two independent experiments.\n\nPurified Norwalk virus 3CLpro (NV 3CLpro) in 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM PBS pH 7.2, 1 mM DTT at a concentration of 10 mg/mL was used for preparation of the NV 3CLpro-ligand complex. A stock solution of 100 mM compound 1, 3, or 10 was prepared in DMSO and each NV 3CLpro:inhibitor complex was prepared by mixing 12 mL of 1, 3 or 10 (3 mM) with 388 mL (0.49 mM) of NV 3CLpro and incubating on ice for 1 h. The buffer was exchanged to 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 using a Vivaspin-20 concentrator (MWCO \u00bc 5 kDa, Vivaproducts, Inc.) and the samples were concentrated to 10, 8.4 and 12.0 mg/mL respectively for crystallization screening. All crystallization experiments were conducted Compact Jr. (Rigaku Reagents) sitting drop vapor diffusion plates at 20 C using equal volumes of protein and crystallization solution equilibrated against 75 mL of the latter. Crystals of NV 3CLpro-ligand 1 and NV 3CLpro-ligand 10 that displayed prismatic morphology were obtained in 1e2 days from the Index HT screen (Hampton Research) condition H12 (30% (w/v) PEG 2000 MME, 150 mM potassium bromide) ( Table 2 ). Samples were transferred to a fresh drop composed of 80% crystallization solution and 20% glycerol and stored in liquid nitrogen. Crystals that displayed a plate morphology formed for NV 3CLpro-ligand 3 in 3 days from the Wizard 3 and 4 screen (Rigaku Reagents) A10 (20% (w/v) PEG3350, 200 mM sodium thiocyanate). The crystals tended to form clusters that needed to be separated in order to obtain a suitable sample for X-ray data collection. Samples were transferred to a fresh drop composed of 80% crystallization solution and 20% PEG 200 and stored in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source beamline 17-ID using a Dectris Pilatus 6 M pixel array detector.\n\nIntensities were integrated using XDS [36, 37] and the Laue class analysis and data scaling were performed with Aimless [38] which suggested that the highest probability Laue class was 2/m and space group C2 for NV CLpro:1 and NV 3CLpro:10. For NV 3CLpro:3, the highest probability space group was P1. The Matthew's coefficient [39] suggested that there was a single molecule in the asymmetric unit (Vm \u00bc 1.8 \u00c5 3 /Da, % solvent \u00bc 32%) for NV 3CLpro:1, NV 3CLpro:10 and two molecules for NV 3CLPro:3 (Vm \u00bc 2.2 \u00c5 3 /Da, % solvent \u00bc 45%). Structure solution was conducted by molecular replacement with Phaser [40] using a previously determined structure of inhibitor bound NV 3CLpro (PDB: 3UR9 [13] ) as the search model and for NV 3CLpro:3, a single solution was obtained for two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. Structure refinement using and manual model building were conducted with Phenix [41] and Coot [42] respectively. Anisotropic atomic displacement parameters were refined for all atoms except solvent molecules for NV 3CLPro:1 and NV 3CLpro:10. Disordered side chains were truncated to the point for which electron density could be observed. Structure validation was conducted with Molprobity"}
