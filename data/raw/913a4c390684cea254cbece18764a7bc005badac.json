The detection wavelength was 254 nm.\n\nThe two enantiomers, eluting at 4.71 min (+) and 7.71 min (-), respectively, were obtained satisfactorily pure on a 100 mg scale of each enantiomer after evaporation of the solvent (3).\n\nYield 76 %; mp >260\u00b0C (dec.) recrystallized from a mixture toluene/acetonitrile. \n\nYield 81 %; mp >260\u00b0C (dec.) recrystallized from a mixture toluene/acetonitrile.\n\nIR \u03bd max (cm -1 ): 3419, 1718, 1658, 1570, 1422, 1367, 1028, 1003 .\n\nYield 78 %; mp 233-235\u00b0C (dec.) recrystallized from a mixture toluene/acetonitrile.\n\nIR \u03bd max (cm -1 ): 3413, 1722, 1659, 1573, 1450, 1366, 1200, 1065, 1025 . \n\nYield 77%; mp 254-256\u00b0C (dec.) recrystallized from a mixture toluene/acetonitrile. \n\nYield 72 %; mp >260\u00b0C (dec.) recrystallized from chloroform. The two non-nitrated derivatives JP42 and JP46 were prepared in their racemic forms starting from the appropriate 4-hydroxycoumarine (8 mmol) and 3-(2-nitrovinyl)-1H-indole (4 mmol) by heating the mixture at 80\u00b0C in dimethylsulfoxide (25 mL) for 16 hours in the presence of potassium carbonate (2.5 mmol) . The reaction was monitored by TLC (eluent hexane/ethyl acetate 8/2). After evaporation of the solvent, the obtained material was taken up with dichloromethane. The solution was washed three times with water and the organic layer was dried (MgSO4). Filtration, followed by evaporation of the solvent under vacuum, provided a crude product which was chromatographed on silicagel (100g, eluent hexane/ethyl acetate 1/1) to afford the wanted product which was further recrystallized (Scheme 1).\n\nYield 40 %; mp 160-161\u00b0C recrystallized from isopropanol. \n\nYield 42 %; mp 254-255\u00b0C (dec.) recrystallized from a mixture heptane/acetonitrile.\n\nIR \u03bd max (cm -1 ): 3394, 1715, 1642, 1421, 1397, 1299, 1266, 1223, 1106, 1018 .
