{"title": "Synthesis, Characterization, Crystal Structure and Antimicrobial Activity of Copper(II) Complexes with the Schiff Base Derived from 2-Hydroxy-4-Methoxybenzaldehyde", "body": "The synthesis of new compounds that are used for the treatment of infections with less secondary effects is a biomedical problem [1,2]. Recently research has focused increasingly on the synthesis of transition metal complexes with Schiff-type ligands, due to the biological properties that they present. Many compounds derived from Schiff bases exhibit antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor and anti-HIV activities [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. Schiff bases derived from salicylaldehyde represent an important class of ligands due to their ability to be used in various fields [15,16,17,18,19]. Having a high capacity chelating and redox potential the positive Cu2+ ion is biologically active, and participates in many processes in the body [20,21,22]. Copper complexes are also among the most potent antiviral, antitumor and anti-inflammatory agents [23]. In addition, it was found that most of benzocaine-containing compounds are biologically active. Recent research has demonstrated that, these derivatives exhibit antimicrobial activity against different species [24,25,26]. Based on these observations and considering research in this area in the present study, we report the synthesis, characterization, antimicrobial studies of some copper(II) complexes containing a Schiff base ligand derived from 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde and ethyl-4-aminobenzoate, with a special impetus on ligand structural investigations. The crystal structures of ligand and complex 6 were studied by X-ray diffraction. The biological properties of these compounds was tested for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Candida albicans strains.\n\nThe ligand HL structure is shown in Figure 3. The planar configuration of HL molecule is stabilized by an intra-molecular O-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bond which is observed in the majority of Schiff base ligands obtained from 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde [28].\n\nThe crystal packing of HL is stabilized by \u03c0-\u03c0 staking and C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O cooperative interactions. Cg1 (the centroid of the C-C9 ring) exhibits a stacking interaction with Cg2 (the centroid of the C11-C16 ring) of the adjacent molecule, related by two-fold axis, with a centroid-to-centroid distance of 3.851(4) \u00c5. The formed dimeric units (Figure 4) are further associated due to the presence of weak C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O intermolecular interactions resulting into the formation of two-dimensional supramolecular ribbons, as the main crystal structure packing motif, depicted in Figure 5.\n\nSelected bond lengths and angles for HL are presented in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\nComplex 6 has a crystal structure formed from the complex binuclear cations [Cu2(L2S)2(ClO4)(H2O)]+, ClO4\u2212 anions and H2O as solvate molecules 1:1:1 molar ratio. The structure of the complex cation is presented in Figure 6.\n\nIn the complex cation two Cu2+ ions, separated by 3.029(1) \u00c5, are coordinated by two mono-deprotonated HL\u2212 ligands, so that the charge balance is in agreement with the formation of species [Cu2(L2S)2ClO4H2O]+. The separate structure of the coordinated ligands along with the atomic labeling scheme is presented in Figure 7a,b. Both the ligands are identical from the chemical point of view and exhibit very close geometric parameters (Table 2). The localization of the hydrogen atoms using the difference density Fourier map has clearly shown that the non-coordinated azomethine atoms N1 and N4 are the sites of protonation associated with the hydrogen bonding towards phenolic oxygen atoms as acceptor (Figure 6 and Figure 7). The copper atoms adopt a slightly distorted octahedral [O4NS] coordination completed by ClO4\u2212 anion and H2O molecule as monodentate ligands for Cu1 and Cu2, respectively (Figure 8).\n\nThe crystal structure of complex 6 is characterized by the parallel packing of two dimensional supramolecular layers consolidated due to the numerous O-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O and C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonding, as shown in Figure 9.\n\nThe ligand and complexes have been characterized in detail by recording their IR spectra. The proposed assignments are based on previous results [28,29,30,31] and pertinent bibliography [32,33,34,35]. The \u028b(C=N) band of the ligand at 1622 cm\u22121 is found to be shifted to lower energies (1603\u20131595 cm\u22121) in the spectra of the complexes, indicating coordination via the azomethine nitrogen. The phenolic \u028b(C\u2013O) stretching vibration in the free Schiff base is observed at 1113 cm\u22121, which is shifted by 10\u201321 cm\u22121 towards lower wave numbers in the complexes, thus indicating coordination of the phenolic oxygen to the Cu2+ ion [36].\n\nIn the IR spectra of complexes 1, 4 and 5, a considerable peak observed in the 3467\u20133420 cm\u22121 range supports the presence of \u028b(H2O) in the complexes [37]. The nitrate complex 1 has two bands at 1433 and 1182 cm\u22121 corresponding to \u028b5 and \u028b1, with a separation of 250 cm\u22121, and a medium band at 930 cm\u22121 assigned to \u028b2 of the nitrato group, values that indicate bidentate coordination [38,39].\n\nThe acetate complex 3 has two strong bands at 1530 and 1442 cm\u22121 corresponding to \u028bas(COO\u2212) and \u028bs(COO\u2212) with a difference between frequencies of 88 cm\u22121. This difference confirms the bidentate nature of the coordinated acetate [40].\n\nThe perchlorate complex 5 shows a band at 1108 cm\u22121 assignable to \u028b3(ClO4\u2212) and a strong band at 1090 cm\u22121 assignable to \u028b4(ClO4\u2212). The splitting of this band in two components indicates the presence of a monodentate perchlorate group [33,38].\n\nThe tentative assignments of the significant electronic spectral bands of ligand and of complexes are presented in Table 3. In these spectra, there is an intense band at 33,330 cm\u22121 which is assigned to a \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* transition originating in the phenyl ring [41]. The band at 28,570 cm\u22121 is attributed to an n\u2192\u03c0* transitions originating in the -CH=N- chromophore [42]. In the spectra of the complexes these bands are shifted to lower energies (Figure S2).\n\nThe electronic spectra for the Cu(II) complexes 2, 3 and 5 exhibit two bands in the region 10,980\u201311,100 cm\u22121 respectively 13,150\u201313,880 cm\u22121, attributed to transitions d\u2013d: 2B2\u21922E, 2B2\u21922B1(2A1), suggesting a distorted tetrahedral geometry [43,44]. The values of the magnetic momentum (1.87, 1.92 and 1.90 BM) indicate the existence of copper complexes under monomers form. The spectrum for complex 1 exhibit three bands at 10,500, 13,420 and 19,410 cm\u22121 corresponding to the transitions: 2B1g\u21922A1g2, 2B1g\u21922B2g, 2B1g\u21922Eg, specific to the octahedral complexes with dx2\u2212y2 ground state [43].\n\nThe magnetic moment value 1.98 BM for complex 1 indicative of a non-bridging copper(II) complex. The electronic spectrum of complex 4 exhibit three bands at 11,000, 12,110 and 16,940 cm\u22121 corresponding to the transitions: 2B1g\u21922A1g, 2B1g\u21922B2g, 2B1g\u21922Eg suggesting a octahedral geometry [43].\n\nThe magnetic moment of the complex 4, measured at room temperature, is 1.07 BM, per copper center. The subnormal magnetic moment indicates that the copper centers are anti-ferromagnetically coupled [45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54].\n\nThe FAB mass spectra of Cu(II) complexes with base Schiff HL have been recorded (Table S1). The mass spectrum of ligand showing a peak at m/z = 300.12 corresponds to the molecular ion [M]+ (Figure S3).\n\n[M]+ peak obtained from the complexes are as follow: m/z = 386.9 (1), m/z = 658.0 (2), m/z = 399.1 (3), m/z = 759.0 (4), m/z = 361.0 (5). The results of mass spectrometry are consistent with the proposed formulas for these compounds as the peaks observed in these spectra correspond to fragments resulting from the expected fragmentations of the compounds.\n\nThe EPR spectra of the complexes in the polycrystalline state at 298 K and 77 K, were recorded at X-band, using 100 kHz field modulation. The g factors were quoted relative to the standard marker TCNE. The spectra of the compounds 1 and 4 in the polycrystalline state (293 K) show typical axial behavior with different g\u01c1 and g\u22a5 values (Table 4). The geometric parameter G which is a measure of the exchange interaction between the copper centers in the polycrystalline compound is calculated using the equation: G = (g\u01c1 \u2212 2.0023)/(g\u22a5 \u2212 2.0023), for axial spectra [55]. In the copper(II) complexes 1 and 4, g\u01c1 > g\u22a5 > 2.0023 and G values (2.77, 3.99) are consistent with a dx2\u2212y2 ground state [56]. The spectra of compounds 2, 3 and 5 show only one broad signal at 2.097, 2.102 and 2.127, respectively, (Figure 10) consistent with tetrahedral geometry [57].\n\nThe solution of complexes were recorded in DMSO at 298 K and 77 K. They present well-resolved four hyperfine lines (Figure 11).\n\nSpectra of the complexes 1, 3 and 5 show three nitrogen superhyperfine lines in the perpendicular component (Figure 12).\n\nThe binuclear nature of 4 was confirmed by the presence of half-field signals at ca.1600 G (Figure 13).\n\nEPR spectral assignments of the copper (II) complexes and orbital reduction parameters are shown in Table 4. The EPR parameters g\u01c1, g\u22a5, A\u01c1 (Cu) and the energies of the d\u2013d transition were used to evaluate the bonding parameters \u03b12, \u03b22 and \u03b42, which may be regarded as measures of the covalency of the in-plane \u03c3 bonds, in-plane \u03c0 bonds and out-of-plane \u03c0 bonds [58,59]. The orbital reduction factors K\u01c1 = \u03b12\u03b22 and K\u22a5 = \u03b12\u03b42, were calculated using expressions reported elsewhere [60]. Hathaway has pointed out that for pure \u03c3 bonding, K\u01c1 ~ K\u22a5 ~ 0.77 and for in-plane \u03c0 -bonding, K\u01c1 < K\u22a5, while for out-of-plane \u03c0-bonding, K\u01c1 > K\u22a5 [61].\n\nThe synthesized compounds and ligand were tested for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus and Candida albicans strains using the paper disc diffusion method [62] (for the qualitative determination) and the serial dilutions in liquid broth method [63] for determination of MIC values. Furaciline and nistatine were used as reference substances.\n\nData from Table 5 confirm the fact that both the ligand HL and the coordinative complexes of copper have a reduced bacteriostatic activity within the limits of concentrations 0.5\u201310.0 mg/mL toward the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. A more nuanced sensitivity toward the searched complexes has been proved by the gram-positive micro-organisms. The experimental data obtained demonstrate that the bacteriostatic activity of the coordinative complexes is influenced by the number of ligand molecules HL found out in the inner sphere and ligand nature. Therefore, growing of the number of ligand molecules and replacing the ions chloro- or acetate- with the perchlorate ion leads to a growing of the antimicrobial activity. The complexes [Cu(L)2] (2), [Cu(L)(ClO4)(H2O)] (5) and [Cu2(L2S)(ClO4)(H2O)]ClO4\u00b7H2O (6) develop bacteriostatic activity also toward Candida albicans in the area of concentrations 0.5\u20130.12 mg/mL, while the initial Schiff base HL which enters the inner sphere of these complexes doesn\u2019t develop antifungal activity.\n\nAll commercially available reagents and chemicals were of analytical- or reagent-grade purity and used as received. The chemical elemental analysis for the determination of C, H, N was done on a Carlo-Erba LA-118 microdosimeter (Lakewood, CA, USA). 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker DRX 400 spectrometer (Billerica, MA, USA) in DMSO-d6, using TMS as the internal standard. IR spectra were recorded on a Specord-M80 spectrophotometer (Leipzig, Germany) in the 4000\u2013400 cm\u22121 region using KBr pellets. The complexes were studied by thermogravimetry (TG) in a static air atmosphere, with a sample heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min using a STA 6000 Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA, USA). Electronic spectra were recorded using the JascoV-670 spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan) in diffuse reflectance, using MgO dilution matrices. EPR spectra were recorded on polycrystalline powders and DMSO solutions at room temperature and 77 K with an MiniScope MS200, (Magnettech Ltd., Berlin, Germany), X-band spectrometer (9.3\u20139.6 GHz), connected to a PC equipped with a 100 KHz field modulation unit. High resolution mass spectra were recorded on a ThermoScientific (LTQ XLOrbitrap) spectrometer using APCI ionization technique and Orbital Ion Trap mass analyzer (Rockford, IL, USA).\n\nThe molar conductance of the complexes in N,N'-dimethylforamide solutions (10\u22123 M), at room temperature, were measured using a Consort type C-533 conductivity instrument. The magnetic susceptibility measurements were done at room temperature in the polycrystalline state on a Faraday magnetic balance (home made).\n\nCrystallographic measurements were carried out on Oxford-Diffraction XCALIBUR E CCD diffractometer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with graphite-monochromated MoK\u03b1 radiation. The single crystals were positioned at 40 mm from the detector and 197 and 273 frames were measured each for 20 and 30 s over 1\u00b0 scan width for HL and 6, respectively. The unit cell determination and data integration were carried out using the CrysAlis package of Oxford Diffraction [64]. Both structures were solved by direct methods using Olex2 [65] software with the SHELXS structure solution program and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F\u00b2 with SHELXL-97 [66]. Atomic displacements for non-hydrogen atoms were refined using an anisotropic model. H atoms were placed at calculated positions and refined as riding atoms in the subsequent least-squares model refinements. The positional parameters of OH and NH hydrogen atoms were found from difference. The oxygen atoms in non-coordinated perchlorate anion were found to be severely disordered and their positional parameters were refined isotopically in combination with PART and SADI tools available in SHELXL Crystallographic data together with refinement details are summarized in Table 6.\n\nA solution of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (0.152 g, 1 mmoL) in ethanol (10 mL) was added to a solution of ethyl-4-aminobenzoate (0.165 g, 1 mmoL) in ethanol (20 mL). The mixture was stirred for 1 h at 25 \u00b0C, then refluxed for 4 h and kept at 4 \u00b0C for several days. The characteristic yellow precipitate obtained by Schiff base condensation was filtered out and kept for crystallization. Fine yellow crystals obtained upon slow evaporation at room temperature were characterized, including single crystal X-ray diffraction. Yield 81%. M.p. 125\u2013127 \u00b0C. Anal. Calc. for C17H17NO4: C, 68.15; H, 5.67; N, 4.67. Found: C, 68.42; H, 5.43; N, 4.41%. The IR spectrum of the obtained ligand confirms the occurrence of the absorption band of 1622 cm\u22121 (st, intense), specific for the azomethinic group [39]. The 1H NMR spectra (CDCl3, d, ppm, J, Hz), recorded in CDCl3, for the ligand has the following signals confirming the structure of the ligand: 1H-NMR (CDCl3, \u03b4, ppm, J, Hz): 1.40 (s, 3H, CH3); 3.84 (s, 3H, OCH3); 4.40 (s, 2H, CH2); 6.13 (d, 8.5, 1H, H-13); 6.50 (d, 8.5, 1H, H-15); 7.26 (s 1H, H-16); 7.60\u20138.15 (m, 4H, benzene); 8.53 (s, 1H, CH=N). 13C-NMR (CDCl3, \u03b4, ppm): 14.48 (CH3); 55.63 (O-CH3); 61.13(OCH2);101.19 (C-13); 107.67 (C-15); 113.07 (C-11); 121.06 (C-8); 128.30 (C-4); 131.10 (C-5); 134.06 (C-9); 152.52 (C-N=CH);162.90 (C-OH); 164.20 (C=N); 164.63 (C-OCH3); 166.30 (C=O). The ligand is soluble in chloroform and dichloromethane.\n\nComplexes 1\u20135 were prepared by direct reaction between the ligand and the corresponding metal salts. Complex 6 was obtained by stirring a mixture of ligand, Cu(ClO4)2\u00b76H2O and NaSCN.\n\nSynthesis of the complex [Cu(L)(NO3)(H2O)2] (1): A methanol solution (15 mL) of the ligand HL (0.299 g, 1 mmoL) was added to Cu(NO3)2\u00b73H2O (0.241g, 1 mmoL) dissolved in methanol (10 mL). The resulting solution was stirring for 6 h at 50 \u00b0C. The green colored solid was filtered, washed with methanol, diethylether and then dried in vacuo. Anal.

The reaction mixture was refluxed for 3 h. Copper(II) perchlorate hexahydrate (0.340 g, 1 mmoL) dissolved in methanol was added and the mixture was refluxed for 1 h. Finally 5 mL methanolic solution of NaSCN (0.162 g, 2 mmoL) was added dropwise, the mixture was refluxed for another 1 h and the resulting solution was then filtered. Reddish brown single crystals suitable for structure determination were obtained from methanolic solution within few days. Anal. Calc. for C68H66Cl2Cu2N4O26S2: C, 50.46; H, 4.08; N, 3.46; Cu, 7.91. Found: C, 50.86; H, 3.82; N, 3.24; Cu, 7.82%. M.wt.: 1617; M.p. > 250 \u00b0C; Yield: 83%; Main IR peaks (KBr, cm\u22121): \u028b(OH) 3450; \u028b(C=O) 1702; \u028b(C=N) 1596; \u028b(Ar\u2013OH) 1095; \u028b(Ar\u2013O\u2013Caliphatic) 1272, 1025; \u028b3(ClO4\u2212) 1106; \u028b4(ClO4\u2212) 1090.\n\nThe antibacterial activity of complexes and also of their prototype furaciline has been determined under liquid nutritive environment [2% of peptone bullion (pH 7.0)] using successive dilutions method [67,68,69]. Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus stems were used as reference culture for in vitro experiment. The dissolution of studied substances in dimethylformamide, microorganisms cultivation, suspension obtaining, determination of minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericide concentration (MBC) have been carried out according to the method previously reported.\n\nAntimycotic properties of the complexes were investigated in vitro on laboratory stem Candida albicans. The activity has been determined in liquid Sabouroud nutritive environment (pH 6.8). The inoculates were prepared from fungal stems which were harvested from 3\u20137 day-old cultures. Their concentration in suspension was (2\u20134) \u00d7 106 colony forming units per milliliter. Sowings for fungi and micelles were incubated at 37 \u00b0C during 7 and 14 days, respectively.\n\nThe analytical and physico-chemical analyses confirm the composition and the structure of the newly obtained complex combinations. In all the complexes, the ligand base Schiff, HL acts as mono-negative bidentate around the metal ion. The structure of the ligand HL and complex 6 has been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. This fact indicates for complex 6 a bi- nuclear system where every atom of Cu(II) is hexacoordinated through the medium of 4 atoms of oxygen, one atom of nitrogen and one atom of sulfur. The two atoms of copper (II) are united each other through the medium of two atoms of oxygen coming from the hydroxyl groups grafted on the aldehyde nucleus.\n\nThe EPR parameters g\u01c1, g\u22a5, A\u01c1 and the energies of d\u2013d transitions were used to evaluate the bonding parameters. The orbital reduction factors indicate the presence of out-of-plane \u03c0-bonding for complexes 1, 3\u20135 and of some in-plane \u03c0-bonding for the complex 2.\n\nThe antimicrobial activity data obtained indicate that the activity of the metal complexes is higher than ligands. The structure of the compounds tested has an effect on antimicrobial activity."}
