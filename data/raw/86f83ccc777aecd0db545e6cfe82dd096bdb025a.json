{"title": "PREVALENCE OF ANTIBODIES TO IBR AND BVD VIRUSES IN DAIRY COWS WITH REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS", "body": "Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) are diseases with a worldwide distribution in domestic and wild r,~minants and result in severe economic losses to the cattle industry.\n\nInfectious bovine rhinotracheitis is caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), which may also cause conjunctivitis, meningoencephalitis, infectious pustular vulvovaginifis and balanoposthitis, abortions and systemic infections (11) . Although there is no definite association between sub-type and the clinical entity, BHV-1 sub-types 1 and 2a are the main causes of the respiratory form of the disease and, frequently, of abortion. However, sub-type 2b is responsible for infectious pusmlar vulvovaginifis and infectious pusmlar balanoposthitis (23) . Abortions mostly occur during the third trimester of pregnancy. Infertility and shortened estrous cycles have been observed in nonpregnant cows inseminated at estrus with semen containing IBR virus.

Usually, both ovaries are affected by IBRV infection, although the most severe lesions begin on the coipus luteum (el; 17, lg, 19, 22) .\n\nThe severity of bovine viral diarrhea in cattle ranges from transient acute infections, which may be unapparent or mild, to a mucosal disease that is inevitably fatal Venereal infection with BVD virus is shown to be an important factor in the transfer of virus to the fetus. Congenital infections can cause abortion, m,mmificatiun, stillbirth, malformation and the development of persistently viraemic calves (7) . Abortions usually occur between 50 and 100 d of gestation. Acute and persistently infected bulls may play a great role in the spread of BVD due to virus excretion by semen. Infection at the time of breeding through using BVDV-infected semen causes reduced conception rate, which is most probably due to reduced fertiliTation. Moreover, BVDV induces inflammation of ovaries and pustular lesions on genital organs, similar to BHV-1 (3, 4, 6, 12) .\n\nThe mucosal disease arises from initial fetal infection with a non-cytopathogenic virus and the subsequent production of persistently viraemic calves. These calves may later develop mucosal disease as a result of superinfection with a \"homologous\" cytopathogenic virus (7) .\n\nConcurrent infections of BVD virus and other respiratory or enteric pathogens may produce a more severe disease than either pathogen alone because of the immlmosuppressive effect of BVD virus (1, 20) .\n\nWith regard to the foregoing, the aim of this study was to determine seroprevalence to IBR and BVD viruses in the group of dairy cows with reproductive disorders and the group with no reproductive disorders. That is to say, in combined infections of IBR and BVD viruses the immunosuppressive effect of BVD virus may be a triggering factor for activation of IBR virus in latently infected carla.\n\nThe sample for this study comprised 120 Holstein-Friesian cows, aged 2 to 9 yr, kept at 4 different dairy farms in the Repubfic of Croatia. Average annual milk production on these farms was 6,000 L per cow.\n\nThese farms were chosen over others because of frequent reproductive problems that had occured over the few last years. We have tested for one group of cows with reproductive disorders and a second group without reproductive disorders from each farm. These groups were made by cluster random sampling, and cows within groups were chosen by systematic random sampling.\n\nBlood samples were collected from all dairy cows by puncture of the jugular vein into tubes without an anticoagulant. All blood samples were centrifuged in the laboratory at 1,200 rpm for 10 min to remove the sera, which were then heat-inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min prior to testing.\n\nSera were examined for IBR and BVD viruses by serum-neutralization test. Antibodies were determined by the micro-method, using Linbro IS-FB-96 plates. Four serial two-fold dilutions of each serum were incubated in 50-#L volumes with equal volumes of the viral suspension containing 100 TCIDso of cytopathic Iowa strain of IBR virus and cytopathic Oregon-C24V strain of BVD virus. After I h of incubation at 37 *C, a suspension of an embryonic bovine trachea (EBTr) cell strain in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM), with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), was added to make up a volume of 100 #L. Each test included a back titration of the vires, positive and negative serum control and cell culture control. The results were evaluated after 5 d of incubation at 37 *C in 5% CO2 in air.\n\nVirus neutralization antibody titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the 50% protection end point, calculated by the Spearman-Kgrber method. Sera with a titre -log10 SNT,o 0,9 or greater to IBR virus and -logto SNTso 1,0 or greater to BVD virus were considered positive.\n\nAll the dairy cows in this study were examined vaginally and per rectum for reproductive disorders. Excluding clinical findings, data on abortions and fetal mortality were taken from reproductive ananmesis.\n\nDifferences in antibody prevalence between groups with and without reproductive disorders for IBR and BVD viruses were tested by the Chi-square test.\n\nAntibody prevalence for IBR virus was 85.8%, and for BVD virus it was 79.2% in the tested cows from all dairy farms. Table 1 presents antthody prevalence for these viruses for each dairy farm. On the basis of the results we are able to say that the presence of anlfoodies to IBR and BVD viruses at these farm was approximately equal. Presence of IBR and BVD in dairy cows was considered in relation to their reproductive status ( Table 2 ). In the group of cows that proved positive for IBR and BVD viruses, a statistically si~ificant difference (P<O.O1) was observed between cows with reproductive disorders and those without reproductive disorders. The likelihood ratio test for the influence of]BR and BVD viruses on reproductive disorders was significant (likelihood ratio X 2 = 3.95, df= 1; P<0.05; Table 2 ).\n\nA reciprocal relation between IBR and BVD positive cows with reproductive disorders and cows without reproductive disorders on single dairy farms bring up Table 3 . Comparison of reproductive disorders in cows fTom the 4 dairy farms are presented in Table  4 . These reproductive disorders occurred at .~imilar rates among the farms. The most f~equently occurring reproductive disorder at all 4 dairy farms was that of repeat breeding, which affected 15 to 35% of the cows. Small percentages of stillbirths, perimetritis and atrophic ovaries were also found, although these disorders were not present at all the farms. \n\nThe percentage of seroposifive animals in this study was 79.2% to BVD and 85.8% to IBR virus. Cows in this study were not vaccinated against IBR and BVD, and showed no symptoms of disease at the time of examination. In a ~mlhr case in nonvaccmated cows, anU~oodies to IBR virus were present in 34.9% of the animals, while BVD virus was present in 68% of the cases (10).\n\nIn an earfier study (21) , seroprevalence of BVD and IBR at 12 dairy farms was 100% for herd seroprevalence, while individual seroprevalence was 50.9% for BVD and 41.0% for IBR.\n\nOur results show that the prevalence of IBR and BVD in dairy cows with reproductive disorders was extremely high (80.8%). There was a sitmificant statistical difference in the number of IBR-and BVD-positive cows betweem the group with reproductive disorders and the group without disorders, suggesting that simultaneous infection with IBR and BVD viruses may have a greater influence on the occurrence of reproductive disorders in dairy cows than monoinfeetion with either IBR or BVD virus. Similar results, with 93% seroposifive to BVD and 40% to IBR virus, have been reported by others (2) . Microbiological and serological investigations of uteri and cervix rinses from cows infected with both BVD and IBR showed a high prevalence of BVD and IBR viruses (5).\n\nOn the studied farms, the average rate of abortions was 7.13%, of endometritis 7.9%, and of stillbirths 3,3%; while the retention of placentas was 23%. Data on the effect of BVD infection on pregnancy rates, stillbirths, mortality of neonatal calves and the size of new-born calves in pers~tently infected cattle was evaluated in 8 herds (14) . At the time of conception, a sis'nificant drop in pregnancy rate to about half the herd average was also found. Moreover, new-born calves were sJ~,nificantly smaller than normal calves (14) . In another study (8) , expe~-huental or natural infection of 4 heifers with BVD virus in early presmancy (from 29 to 41 d) resulted in fetal death; 2 heifers aborted and the fetus was resorbed in two other cases. It is doubtful that early pregnancies are terminated by BHV-I infection, although one study (13) reported a ~iLmificant decrease in the number of successful inseminations in seronegative and seropositive dairy cows. The incidence of abortions between BVDV-infected and control groups of dairy cows, was statistically s/~nificantly different, while the number of stillbirths, weak-born calves and congenital anomalies was not. The percentage of nonreturns, average number of inseminations per cow, and calving intervals showed a trend toward improvement in the BVDV group (9).\n\nIn conclusion our results indicate that the interaction between IBR and BVD viruses could increase reproductive disorders in dairy cows, and thus greatly affect reproductive management practices to implement eradication program for IBR and BVD. The use of marker vaccines offers good prospects for the eradication of herpesvirus infections (15) . Use of vaccinations against IBR and BVD in dairy herds were shown to drop the rate of abortion rate from 30 to 4% (16) ."}
