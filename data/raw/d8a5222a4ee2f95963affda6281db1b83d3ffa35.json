Briefly, indicator bacteria were grown in LB media, and set to final OD of 0.02-0.05. Different concentrations of pure peptides were diluted with precooled PBS buffer, mixed with cell culture in a 96well cell culture plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Thereafter, data were recorded at 600 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (xMarK BIO RAD). Cell culture mixed with PBS was used as positive control, and PBS buffer mixed with LB media was used as a negative control.\n\nFor toxicity assays, IiR515 and IiR915 were used against C. elegans according to previous methods [16] . Pure peptides were spotted onto NGM plates at a final concentration of 100 ng/\u00b5L, and after 24 h of incubation, E. coli OP50 was spotted onto the same place and the plates were again incubated for 12 h. L4 stage C. elegans was placed at the center of the plates at an equal distance from both bacterial lawns. The number of worms was counted after 12 h. Choice index was determined according to following formula: Choice index (%) = (the number of worms counted on the test lawn -the number of worms counted on the OP50 lawn) / the total number of worms * 100%.\n\nThe toxicities of IiR515 and IiR915 on C. elegans were tested. The IiR515 and IiR915 peptides have effects on the food tropism of C. elegans. However, these two peptides did not show any killing effect on C. elegans. Furthermore, the number of offspring and the body length were not influenced by these two peptides.\n\nArabidopsis-oomycete pathosystem: differential interactions with "}
