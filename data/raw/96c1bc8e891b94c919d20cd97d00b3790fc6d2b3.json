{"title": "Superoxide Dismutase 1 Protects Hepatocytes from Type I Interferon-Driven Oxidative Damage", "body": "considered as significantly enriched processes. Genes involved in oxidation-reduction were clustered into 6 distinct groups using k-means clustering method implemented using TM4 Microarray Expression Viewer (www.tm4.org). The significantly differentially regulated genes shown in Figure 1D were selected based on an intersection with a published list of human genes with antioxidant function (Gelain et al., 2009) .\n\nTo detect ROS production, primary mouse hepatocytes were seeded on cover slips pre-coated with collagen and RAW264.7 macrophages were seeded on Chamber Slides Lab-Tek II (Thermo Scientific).\n\nAt the indicated time point, the cells were stained with 5\u00b5M CellROX Deep Red Reagent (Life Tech, Cat. No. C10422) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, washed with PBS, fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde respectively 4 % formaldehyde for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C and counterstained with 5 \u00b5g/ml Hoechst 33258 for 7 min. Finally, the coverslips were mounted onto microscopy slides using Fluoro Mounting Medium. Quantification of immunofluorescence images with CellROX was performed based on the mean fluorescence intensity of cytoplasmic area defined by the distance from the nuclei using the CellProfiler cell image analysis software v2.0 (Carpenter et al., 2006) . The size range for the pipelines was adjusted depending on the cell type.\n\nTissue specimens (liver) were fixed (12-48 hours at 4 \u00b0C) with 4% formaldehyde and subsequently embedded in paraffin as described previously (Bergthaler et al., 2007) . Microtome sections (3 \u00b5m thick) were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin or prepared for immunohistochemistry as follows: Endogenous peroxidases (PBS/3% H 2 O 2 ) were neutralized and unspecific binding blocked (PBS/10% FCS). Sections were stained with primary antibodies: rabbit \u03b1-Phospho-STAT1 (detecting only phosphorylated STAT1 at position Tyrosine 701; Cell Signaling #9167), rabbit \u03b1-cleaved caspase 3 (BD Pharmingen or Cell Signalling) and mouse \u03b1-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) (Millipore, MAB3560) (Kitada et al., 2001) antibody. Bound primary antibodies were visualized using ready-to-use, peroxidase-based EnVision\u2122 (Dako) secondary detection system with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) as chromogen (haemalaun counterstaining of nuclei). Immunostained sections were registered using the slide scanner Pannoramic 250 Flash (3DHistech) at 200x magnification.\n\nImmunostained liver sections were quantified using Tissue Studio 3 software (Definiens AG, Munich, Germany). DAB positive structures were expressed as cells/nuclei per mm 2 . Phospho-STAT1 stained sections were scanned using panoramic 250 flash slide scanner (3D Histech Ltd, Hungary). Phospho-STAT1 positive nuclei in the liver were quantified using Definiens Tissue Studio\u00ae 3 software (Definiens AG, Munich, Germany) and detected nuclei were expressed as cells per mm 2 .\n\nFor fibrosis stainings, 1-2 \u00b5m paraffin sections of livers were de-waxed, hydrated and stained for one hour at room temperature with Sirius Red (Polyscience, USA) and picric acid (Merck, Darmstadt). Sections were washed in acidified water (0.01N HCl), dehydrated, cleared in xylol (Roth, Karlsruhe) and mounted with corbit balsam (Hecht, Kiel). Additionally, liver sections were stained for elastic fibres with Elastica van Gieson staining kit (Merck, Darmstadt) according to manufacturer\u00b4s instructions. Nuclei appear black, elastic fibres purple and collagen red. Images were acquired using an AxioImager Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Jena, Germany) . For quantification of collagen content, five high power fields (hpf; 0.237 mm 2 ) per section were analysed using the module AutMess (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.).\n\nHisto-pathological scoring for MHV infection was performed evaluating the following criteria: i) lobular area inflammation (0 no infiltrating cells, 1 <100 infiltrating cells, 2 >100 infiltrating cells, 3 > 300 infiltrating cells), ii) lobular disarray and hepatocyte ballooning (0 nil, 1 <60%, 2 >60%) and iii) hepatocyte death (0 nil, 1 <20, 2 >20 cells).\n\nProtein concentration of liver lysates were determined by Coomassie Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-Page using NuPAGE\u00ae Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris Gels (Life Tech), Westran\u00ae Clear signal PVDF membranes (Whatman) and the following antibodies: anti-SOD1 (Abcam #ab16831) and anti-ACTIN (Sigma #A2066). The protein size was determined with the PageRuler TM Prestained Protein Ladder (Thermo Scientific). For protein quantification, the secondary antibody donkey anti-rabbit IgG-IRDye800 (Rockland, #611-732-128) was used. The bands were quantified on an Odyssey Imager (model #9120, LI-COR) using the software Image Studio v3.1 (LI-COR).\n\nFor detection of IFN\u03b1, sera were 1:10 prediluted and analysed by ELISA using rat \u03b1-mIFN-\u03b1 capture antibody (PBL Interferon Source 22100-1), rabbit \u03b1-mIFN-\u03b1 detection antibody (PBL Interferon Source 32100-1), \u03b1-rabbit HRP secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch 711-036-152) and TMB solution (Life Tech 002023).\n\nPrimary hepatocytes were isolated from anesthetized mice (Ketamine/Xylazine: 1:3, 0.1 ml/10 g mouse) upon perfusion via the portal vein with washing buffer followed by digestion of the liver using liberase (Roche). Next, the liver was detached and put in a petridish containing liberase buffer. Cells were shaken out of the liver, filtered using a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer (BD Falcon) and suspended in William's E Medium GlutaMAX\u2122 (Invitrogen) containing 10 % FCS and 1 % PSQ. The cells were allowed to settle for 20 min on ice, before the upper 25 ml containing dead cells and debris were discarded. The remaining 25 ml were spun down for 10 min at 500 rpm at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was washed in William`s E Medium/10 % FCS/1 % PSQ and centrifuged at 500 rpm for 3 min. Finally, cells were resuspended in William`s E Medium/10 % FCS/1 % PSQ and seeded at a density of 0.75-1x10 6 cells/well on 6-well plates precoated with 50 mg/l rat tail collagen type I (BD, Cat. No. 354236) containing 8.3 % glacial acetic acid (Merck, Cat. No. 1000632500) . After 3 h the medium was changed to Will E/0.5 % FCS/1 % PSQ and maintained in this medium.\n\nSingle cell suspensions of lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs were prepared by mechanical disruption. Lymphocytes were purified using Histopaque 1083 (Sigma-Aldrich) and density centrifugation (400 g at 20\u00b0C for 30 min). To prevent unspecific binding of mAb, 50 \u00b5g/ml of purified mouse and rat IgG were added to the staining mixture (Jackson Immunoresearch).\n\nDead cells were excluded using fixable viability dye eFluor 780 (eBioscience). Subsequently, the cells were stained with the following mAbs in PBS containing 0.2% BSA and 2 mM EDTA:\n\n(HK1.4) were from BioLegend. \u03b1-CD11b (M1/70) and \u03b1-siglec-F (E50-2440) were from BD Bioscience. Samples were acquired on a FACS LSR Fortessa or FACSCanto II (Becton Dickinson), data was analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star).\n\nCells were treated in vitro with 10\u00b5M Copper (II) 3,5-diisopropylsalicylate hydrate (CuDIPS) (Sigma Aldrich, Cat. No. 341649) (Laurent et al., 2004) . Mice were administered i.p. with 10mg of CuDIPS per kg body weight one day before infection, and received two additional shots of 10mg/kg each at zero and one day after infection. Mice were administered 100ng recombinant mouse IFN-\u03b14 i.v. (PBL Interferon Source 12115-1).\n\nTo neutralize type I IFN signaling, 250\u00b5g of \u03b1-IFNAR1 antibody (clone MAR1-5A3, BioXCell) was administered i.p. one day prior to infection with two additional shots of 250\u00b5g each at zero and one day after infection. The control group was administered with a matched isotype control (clone MOPC21, BioXCell).
