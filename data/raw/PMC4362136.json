{"title": "In this issue", "body": "The current status of beta blockers\u2019 use in the management of hypertension\n\nAkbar & Alorainy review some of the evolutionary changes of clinical uses of beta-blockers, the rationale for their use, some recent controversies surrounding their use for treatment of hypertension, and advantages of newer additions to the group. Current uses of beta-blockers in cardiovascular diseases (CD) include ischemic heart diseases, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure. Other substantial non-cardiac uses include glaucoma, migraine, situational anxiety, benign essential tremors, and cardiac symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. The authors conclude that beta-blockers may no longer be the undisputed leader, however they still hold a special place in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension due to their cost-effectiveness, and a reasonable adverse effects profile.\n\nsee page 1307"}
