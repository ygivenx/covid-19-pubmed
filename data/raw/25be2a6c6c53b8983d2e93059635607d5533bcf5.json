{"title": "THE EMERGENCE OF ARTHROPOD-BORNE VIRAL DISEASES: A GLOBAL PROSPECTIVE ON DENGUE, CHIKUNGUNYA AND ZIKA FEVERS", "body": "Emerging infectious diseases (EID) are defined as infections that have recently appeared in a population, and are quickly increasing in frequency or geographic range (Morse 1995) . For a disease to emerge, several factors are required, including the introduction of a pathogen and its spread into the human population, followed by its ability to be maintained in nature.\n\nMany pathogens require adaptation to emerge into a new environment, while for others adaptation is not necessary. Human behavior and ecology are two other factors that play a role in the emergence of diseases (Schrag and Wiener 1995; Hahn, Shaw et al. 2000 ; May, Gupta et al. 2001) . For example, the geographical expansion of human populations has facilitated the appearance of some emerging viruses, as well as the intensification of agriculture and the disturbance of habitats due to climate change or deforestation (Taylor, Latham et al. 2001; Jones, Patel et al. 2008) .\n\nActually, only a few infectious agents are restricted to humans. The majority of emergent pathogens that affect humans are zoonotic agents that are maintained in enzootic cycles The host range expansion of the zoonotic agents requires multiple factors to establish transmission into the human population. Anthropogenic changes related to agriculture practices and deforestation are two factors that may bring humans in close contact with zoonotic reservoirs. Many wildlife species have been identified as reservoirs of pathogens that can be transmitted to humans (Levins, Epstein et al. 1993 ; Morse 1994) . For example, bats represent a major source of zoonotic viruses (Calisher, Childs et al. 2006 ), including rabies, Nipah (NiV), SARS (SARS-CoV) and Ebola (EBOV) viruses (Taylor, Latham et al. 2001 ; Woolhouse, Haydon et al. 2005 ).\n\nMany other zoonotic viruses are transmitted to humans by hematophagous insects (mosquitoes, sandflies, biting midges and ticks) and are designated arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) (Higgs and Beaty 2005) . In recent years, the prevalence of vector-borne diseases has expanded considerably, due to intensification of human travel and transcontinental commerce. The number of cases has increased in endemic regions, but cases have also spread into new regions where the viruses never existed before (Gubler 2002 \n\nArboviral diseases are caused by viruses that are maintained in transmission cycles between vertebrate hosts and blood-sucking arthropods such as mosquitoes, sandflies, midges and ticks. In order to complete the transmission cycle, the virus must produce a sufficiently high level of viremia in the vertebrate host for a susceptible arthropod to become infected while taking a blood meal (Karabatsos 2001) . There are at least 135 arboviruses that have been known to cause human disease. Arboviral infections can range from asymptomatic to fulminant fatal disease. The clinical symptoms are generally categorized as systemic febrile illness, hemorrhagic fever and invasive neurological disease (Gubler and Vasilakis 2016 In the past few decades, the total number of arboviral epidemics has significantly increased (Gubler and Vasilakis 2016) . In most cases, the emerging arboviral diseases were caused by viruses previously considered to be controlled or of little public health importance (Gubler and Vasilakis 2016) . Introduction of viruses into new geographic areas (i.e. WNV into the Americas), where na\u00efve vertebrate and arthropod hosts were susceptible and able to sustain infection, also contributed to the occurrence of major outbreaks. In other cases, epidemics were associated with the regional spread of viruses previously considered restricted to a specific geographic area, e.g. Rift Valley fever, Ross River and chikungunya fevers, Japanese encephalitis and Venezuelan equine encephalitis.\n\nOne example of an arbovirus that has significantly expanded its geographic range and moved into new territories is chikungunya virus (CHIKV). CHIKV is a member of the genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae; historically it was restricted to the Old World (Jupp and McIntosh 1988) . There are indications that the virus was originated in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is believed that CHIKV was maintained in an enzootic transmission cycle between non-human primates (NHP) and arboreal Aedes mosquitoes ( Zika virus (ZIKV) is another arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus, that is rapidly expanding its geographic distribution and has been recently introduced into areas not previously reported. The disease is characterized by a broad range of clinical symptoms, including fever, rash, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthritis or arthralgia, conjunctivitis and vomiting, which are clinical signs similar to dengue disease and many other diseases of viral (e.g chikungunya and Mayaro fevers) and parasitic (e.g. scrub typhus and leptospirosis) aetiologies (Macnamara 1954 . These reports were interpreted as evidence that ZIKV is maintained in forested areas of tropical Africa in a cycle similar to that of sylvan yellow fever (i.e. arboreal mosquitoes and non-human primates). ZIKV was first isolated from humans in 1954 from a 10 year old Nigerian female (Macnamara 1954) . The virus was isolated from mice inoculated with the patient's serum sample; two other human cases were also confirmed from the same country. In 1969, ZIKV was isolated for the first time outside the African continent from Ae. aegypti mosquitoes collected in Malaya (Marchette, Garcia et al. 1969) ; and in 1977, the first human case was described in Indonesia (Olson, Ksiazek et al. 1981) . The factors associated with the emergence of ZIKV are not understood. On the island of Yap, in Micronesia, where the first large outbreak was reported in 2007, ZIKV was speculated to have been introduced by either viremic travelers or infected mosquitoes originating from the Philippines, since travel exchange between Yap state and Philippines is very frequent.\n\nIn 2013 a major epidemic of ZIKV was reported in French Polynesia, where human subjects were presenting dengue-like symptoms and rash. Interestingly, few of the affected patients presented severe neurological complications and non-vector borne transmission (sexual and transfusion-associated cases) were also described (Laigret, Rosen et al. 1967 In 2015, ZIKV reached the Americas. The first country to report the virus was Brazil, where an outbreak of exanthematic disease was described and affected more than 6,000 people in Northeast region of that country (ECDC 2015b; ProMEDmail 2015; Zanluca, de Melo et al. 2015) . The state of Bahia was the first state to report autochthonous transmission of ZIKV; however, the virus easily spread across the country, where 14 states described autochthonous transmission (PAHO 2015a; WHO 2015a). Several factors may have played a role in the emergence of ZIKV in Brazil. The abundance of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus vectors probably facilitated the virus emergence. There is speculation that ZIKV was introduced in Brazil through people attending in the 2014 World Cup, although many countries with reported cases of ZIKV did not participate in the competition (Salvador and Fujita 2015) . Similarly athletes attending the World canoe championship, which took place in Rio de Janeiro, may also have been responsible for ZIKV's introduction, as many represented countries had major epidemics at the time (e.g. French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Cook Island and Chile). Concurrent phylogenetic analysis identified the Brazilian ZIKV as an Asian strain, suggesting that the virus may indeed have been entered Brazil through Asia or the South Pacific (Musso 2015) . Since ZIKV introduction in Brazil, autochthonous transmission has been reported in 31 countries/territories in the Americas (PAHO/WHO 2016).\n\nThe earliest evidence of dengue-like disease came from reports found in the Chinese medical encyclopedia dating back to AD 265-420 (further edited in AD 610 and AD 992) (Nobuchi 1979) . The disease was linked to the presence of water-associated flying insects and thus named 'water poison'. Other reports of dengue-like disease were described in the West Indies in 1635 and in Panama in 1699 (Howe 1977; McSherry 1982) . Following this period, numerous epidemics of disease resembling dengue were described in the continents of Asia, Africa and North America. In Asia, dengue viruses probably first emerged into the human population during deforestation practices for the establishment of agricultural settlements in areas adjacent to the jungle. The peridomestic Ae. albopictus mosquito was likely the bridge vector in the transmission of DENV in these areas (Gubler 2006) . Consequently, human migration and trade facilitated introduction and establishment of DENV transmission into more populated areas of tropical Asia, where the Ae. albopictus and other peridomestic Stegomyia mosquito species were abundant (Gubler 2006 ).\n\nThe introduction of the anthropophilic African mosquito Ae. aegypti aegypti in Asia, as well as in the New World, was facilitated by the sea-borne and slave trade. Beginning in the 17 th century, a wide distribution of Ae. aegypti was present throughout the tropics, starting in port cities and expanding inwards into the continent as part of the human urbanization expansion. As a result, a favorable environment was established for the transmission of DENV and major dengue epidemics have occurred, which rapidly became pandemics following World War II and continuing until now (Leichtenstern 1896; Halstead 1992; Gubler 1997) . Also, following World War II, a new dengue-associated disease affecting predominantly children was described in endemic areas of Southeast Asia (Gubler 1998 ). An initial outbreak in Manila in 1953/1954, followed by a larger outbreak in Bangkok in 1958, provided the first clinical description of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (Hammon, Rudnick et al. 1960 ).\n\nIn the Americas, DENV (and Yellow Fever virus) epidemics were restricted by a control campaign initiated in 1947 by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) aiming to eliminate Ae. aegypti from Central and South America. However, with the suspension of the control campaign in the 1970s, the region was reinfested with Ae. aegypti and the incidence of dengue started to rise again, reaching the pre-campaign levels by 1995. Since then the geographic distribution of dengue have increased not only in the Americas, but also in other regions of the world, from non-endemic to, in some circumstances, hyperendemic levels \n\nDengue viruses are maintained in nature through two evolutionary and ecologicaly distinct transmission cycles: a sylvatic cycle, where the virus is transmitted among non-human primates by several arboreal Aedes spp mosquitoes, and the urban/human cycle, where virus transmission occurs between humans and mainly the domestic Ae. aegypti mosquito The human transmission cycle is by far the most important cycle, considering its impact to public health and by the fact that it is occurring throughout the tropics. Although the Ae. aegypti mosquito is the major vector, the peridomestic Ae. albopictus and Ae. polynesiensis . Previous studies demonstrated that none or little transmission was achieved when the blood meal titer was below 10 3 viral RNA copies/ml and the level of transmission reached close to 100% when a dose was above 10 9 viral RNA copies/ml (Nguyen, Lee et al. 2013 ).\n\nThe emergence of all four DENV serotypes from a common sylvatic ancestor occurred thousand years ago, congruent with the establishment of early human settlements large enough to sustain transmission and was associated with vector changing from arboreal Aedes to peridomestic/domestic Aedes spp. and human reservoir hosts (Wang, Ni et al. 2000) . Emergence of the serotypes occurred independently and repeatedly in allopatric regions prior to their expansion in sympatric regions, using similar non-human primate hosts ( Ecological factors are also involved in the emergence of DENV. Deforestation is one of the major factors driving sylvatic DENV emergence. As people are exploring new resources deep into the forest, living in areas previously unexplored, the chances of sylvatic DENV emergence are also increasing (Patz, Daszak et al. 2004 ). In regions of Asia and Africa, where rapid and uncontrolled urbanization takes place, the risk of sylvatic dengue emergence is high.\n\nHistorically, flaviviruses were classified into serocomplexes based on serologic relationships, such as the virus neutralization profile (Calisher, Karabatsos et al. 1989 ). Following primary DENV infection, the monotypic immune response generates a full protection against homologous viruses, but partial and transient protection, lasting for only a few months, against heterologous DENV strains (Sabin 1952) . As a result, a single person can potentially be infected with all four DENV serotypes during her lifetime (Rothman 2011) .\n\nTo determine the antigenic relationships among the DENV, it is common to represent their neutralization profile against a panel of several different sera know to react with specific DENV types (Vasilakis, Durbin et al. 2008a ). It has been demonstrated that sera obtained from humans during a primary infection or immunized with DENV exhibit strong homotypic neutralization against different urban and sylvatic DENV, where the heterotypic neutralization is absent or last for a short period of time (Vasilakis, Durbin et al. 2008 ). However, many times these analyses are difficult to interpret due the intrinsic variability among samples derived from different hosts or infection histories (Thomas, Nisalak et al. 2009 ; van Panhuis, Gibbons et al. 2010). More recently, the antigenic relationships of DENV have been studied using antigenic cartography to reduce some measurements errors of neutralization against multiple serotypes (Katzelnick, Fonville et al. 2015) . The analyses of a panel of human and non-human primate sera derived from experimental infection, as well vaccination and natural infection demonstrated that the majority of DENV isolates were clustered into each DENV type classification. However, a number of viruses were located more adjacent to another DENV type than its own type and the distance within and between types was similar. The neutralization profile of antisera demonstrated similar trend, with groups close to the homologous virus type, but also close to a heterologous DENV (Katzelnick, Fonville et al. 2015) .\n\nVector switching from arboreal primatophilic mosquito species to peridomestic mosquito vectors (Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus) may have facilitated the emergence of sylvatic strains into the urban transmission cycle (Wang, Ni et al. 2000) . The expansion of nonhuman primates and human populations in different geographic areas allowed the sustained transmission of DENV into the major tropical regions of the world.\n\nThe possibility of sylvatic strains to enter the human transmission cycle was evaluated by both in vitro and in vivo human models of DENV replication. The purpose of those studies was to verify if any adaptation is required to sylvatic DENV strains been established in a new transmission cycle (Vasilakis, Shell et al. 2007 ). Replication of sylvatic DENV-2 in human monocytes-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) was comparable with human DENV-2 strains, suggesting they can promptly infect human hosts (Vasilakis, Shell et al. 2007 ). Other study using cell lines representing human (Huh-7), monkey (Vero) and mosquito (C6/36) hosts demonstrated that the human strains only have higher level of viral replication in the human cell, but virus titer were similar in the monkey and mosquito cell lines (Vasilakis, Fokam et al. 2008b) . Collectively, these studies demonstrate the ability of sylvatic DENV strains to replicate in a range of host cells, suggesting that their emergence in the human population is not dependent on adaptation to new hosts, but most dependent on the opportunity of the sylvatic virus to infect a wide range of hosts and eventually emerge into a human transmission cycle.\n\nThe impact of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) is not only a public health threat, but also an economic burden, and has both direct and indirect consequences. The total investment for the development of tools for early detection of pathogens, as well as, sustainable surveillance for potential pathogens emerging into a population, are costs that must be considered as a direct consequence of EIDs economic impact (Fig. 2) . These costs are incurred not only in diagnostic laboratory settings, but also directly in the field, in hospitals or other point-of-care (POC) health care facilities. Examples of indirect costs accountable for the economic burden of EIDs are productivity losses from work absence, short-term disability and impairment of patient quality of life (Fig. 2) . Further steps following the introduction of an EID should be considered such as, training of health care and other professionals dealing with the emerging pathogen, reducing the possibility of transmission to a larger population, and treatment responses, if available.\n\nThe World Economic Forum has listed the spread of EIDs as one of the top risk factors to cause potential economic loss to the world population (WEF 2015). Although the economic impact of EIDs is difficult to be accurately determined, several studies have been conducted to estimate their economic burden to society (Newcomb 2003 (CDC 2003) . Its economic impact was estimated between 50 to 100 billion U.S. dollars (Newcomb 2003) . The economic impact of the 2002 outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) in Louisiana, which resulted in 24 deaths of the total 329 reported cases, was estimated to cost approximately 20 million U.S. dollars. These costs included inpatient and outpatient visits, loss of work productivity, costs incurred by public health departments and mosquito control agencies (Zohrabian, Meltzer et al. 2004; Zohrabian, Hayes et al. 2006 ). The spread of WNV in California and an outbreak in Sacramento County in 2005 resulted in 163 human cases, whose economic impact was estimated to be near 3 million U.S. dollars, which included medical visits and treatment, job productivity loss and mosquito control (Barber, Schleier et al. 2010 ).\n\nAdditional studies have also attempted to anticipate the cost of potential outbreaks. In Australia, as one example of an isolated geographic area, the introduction of exotic diseases, as well as, pests and weeds could have a potential cost of over $1 billion Australian dollars (Murray, Skerratt et al. 2012) . A study on the next influenza pandemic in the United States, estimated 89,000 to 207,000 deaths and an economic loss of 71.3 -166.5 billion U.S. dollars. The cost was based on estimations for patient hospitalizations, outpatient visits and expenses for drug treatment and did not account for indirect costs interfering with commerce and community activities in affected areas (Meltzer, Cox et al. 1999 ). Overall, these examples highlight the impact EIDs can create for human populations and demonstrate the importance of controlling these diseases. One example would be the use of immunizations, when a vaccine is available.\n\nThe majority of viruses with potential to produce important epidemics are zoonotic, which means that they are originated in an animal hosts and are driven by several emergence forces, including changes in ecological and social behaviors, supporting the possibility to spill over into the human population. The understanding of the potential for spread of emerging infectious diseases is essential in the prevention and control of large-scale outbreaks and effective use of resources to combat them. Knowing the source and modes to human transmission allows the prediction of disease appearance and implementation of global measures to eliminate the risk. As example, the eradication campaigns initiated in the late 40's to eliminate Ae. aegypti from Central and South America were effective during the time they were in effect because of government support, rigorous compliance and population support, which demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of coordinated global measures to combat diseases. Isolated prevention measures won't have the same results, or even been completely unsuccessful. Nowadays, with the advance of new technologies for detection, treatment and control of diseases and quick and easy dissemination of information, prevention measures should be more effective and time of response should be much shorter. Based on the current knowledge, it seems that a successful program will require the integration of different segments involved in the detection, treatment and prevention of diseases including diagnostic labs, hospitals, and government agencies, among others.\n\nIn the case of dengue as one example of global human threat, to clearly comprehend and anticipate the occurrence of sylvatic DENV emergence is fundamental to clarify the ecological and epidemiological aspects related to this virus cycle. There is enough evidence to support the existence of endemic serotypes as a result of independent events through cross-species transmission of sylvatic DENV. However, there is clear indication that sylvatic DENV come into close contact with humans in Asia and Africa, and possibly in other parts of the world, originating sporadic severe dengue disease that can spillover in the urban environment. The sylvatic cycle of DENV has not being intensively explored and not considerable attention is given to the consequences involved in viruses coming from unexplored habitats. Additionally, different of what was proposed in the past, recent studies indicated that the emergence of sylvatic DENV represent a real threat to people considering the inexistence of an adaptation barrier to sylvatic viruses emerge into the human population. Moreover, the diversity of DENV strains and the emergence of new isolates have important consequences in the development of therapeutics, including vaccines currently in the developmental and clinical trial phases.\n\nThe establishment of preventive measures and surveillance of current and newly identified infectious diseases should be based on several factors, many of them discussed in this review, starting with the knowledge of the disease ecology, human behavior, socio-economic factors of a target population or area, among others. Policy-makers and the distribution of resources must consider not only short-term measures, but also long-term goals to maintain the infrastructure and research programs, from basic science through translational research. Nowadays, human travel and rapid transportation of products, live animals, insects, and so forth, not only locally, but around the world have the potential for quick dissemination or reemergence of diseases. Anthropogenic land-use changes, especially intensification of agriculture and livestock production, increase the risk of pathogen spillover from wildlife hosts to the human population. Knowing the dynamic of diseases allows more effective surveillance and implementation of strategies that are critical for their control as well for the allocation of scarce financial resources. 143 "}
