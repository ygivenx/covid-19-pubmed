Threonine has been identified as the palmhoylation site in one case only, with bovine brain myelin proteolipid apoprotein [90] . All other palmitate linkage sites chen0cally identified are cysteine residues (compare Table n ).\n\npreviously identified that contained fatty acids as part of their covalent structme. These were the proteolipid apoprotein isolated from the myelin membrane, which is also termed lipophilin [5, 6] , the proteolipid component of preparations of the sarcoplasmic Ca2+/Mg 2+-ATPase [7] and the bacterial lipoproteins [8, 9] . The fatty acid species in these above-mentioned proteins more or less reflected the acyl patterns of the. lipi0s of the membrar.e from which they had been isolated. In all these ca, .:s palmitic-, stearic-and oleic acid were the predomiaant acyl species. Although these proteins, due to their solubility in organic solvents, had initially been termed proteolipids, they can be classified as true acylproteins because of their covalently bound fatty acid residues. It should be mentioned that some other proteolipld species have been described. Despite their lack of any covalently hound fatty acid, these are soluble in organic solvents, but insoluble in water [10] .\n\nones. This will, of course influence the interactions between such modified proteins and other molecules present in their vicinity, be it other proteins, lipids or even nucleic acid. Likewise, intermolecular processes may be influenced, such as oligomerisation of polypeptides during biosynthesis or the co-oIgrativity between subanits of a multimeric protein.\n\nThe present review aims at summarizing developments in the field of hydrophobic modifications of proteins since their discovery. Special emphasis will be placed on the acylation of viral and eukaryotic polypeptides with lon~ chain fatty acids. This modification yields what could '~e regarded as a new class of proteins, which by analogy with glyco-or phosphoproteins, I suggest by termed 'acylproteins'. Two types of acylprotein are presently distinguished in the literature, those which contain exclusively the fourteen carbon myristic acid (tetradecanoic acid) in an amide-linkage, and those whirl\" are predominantly modified with palmitic-, stearic-and oleic acid (hexa-and octadecanoic acids) in ester-or thioester-type linkages.\n\nThe various biochemical and cell biological aspects of palmitoylatlon and myristoylation will be discussed.\n\nAnother hydrophobic modification of proteins, the covalent attachment of a glycolipid tail to some membrane proteins (glypiatiGn), will not be described here. CmTent reviews cover this area, which the reader is referred to [1] [2] [3] [4] . Fig. 1 presents a schematic representation of the above-mentioned hydrophobic modifications of proteins.\n\nEven before the term palmitoylation became widely used in the literature, a few protein species had been\n\nAt the time unaware of the above-mentioned acylated proteolipids, Schmidt and Schlesinger [11, 12] observed that typical membrane glycoproteins can be labeled with tritiated long chain fatty acids. Although viral membrane $1ycoproteins were utilized initially, the same authors reported that fatW acylation also occurred with proteins of non.infected cells [131. The first cellular membrane glycoprotein to be identified as fatty acylation was the transferrin receptor [14] . Many other species of acylproteins of viral or cellular origin with covalently bound fatty acids were subsequently identified (Table  I) .\n\nIn most of the proteins listed in Table I acylatlon was detected after labeling the protein with [~H]pulrnltie acid in the appropriate system followed by identification via immunoprecipitation, PAGE-analysis, chromatographic procedures, or combinations thereof. Although not examined in all acylproteins listed, in nearly all cases in which labeled fatty acids were analysed, palmitic acid was found to represent the major species bound to the acylprotein with stearic-and olei~ acid comprising the balance of total radioactive fatty acid recovered from the protein under study. The same ,esuits have also been reported from analysis of acyi chains released from non-labeled acylproteins purified in large scale (for references refer to Table I ). It should be noted that proteins modified by a 81ycolipid will incorporate 3H-labeled fatty acids during metabolic labeling, just like the acylproteins. In order to differentiate such glypiated proteins from acylproteins, labeling with [3H]ethanolamine or [3H]inositol should be applied. Only if such label is incorporated, is the prott:in most likely 81ypiated [3, 4] . The fatty acid linkage in th\u00a2,~ proteins is parlially or to:ally resistant to treatment with mild alkali of hydgoxylanfine. b Veil. M., Heftier. G. and Schmidt, MF.G.. unpublished data. Table I are glycosylated and represent membrane components with widely diverse biological functions. Among these are polypeptid~ which span the membrane once or multiple times. Usually the palmitoylated membrane proteins are oriented with their carboxyterminus towards th*. cytoplasmic side of the membrane or homologously towards the inside of the enveloped virus particles listed. However, reversely oriented proteins may also be palmitoylated, e.g., the hema881utininneuraminidase protein (HN) of mumps virus and of paramyxovirus SV5 [64, 65] as well as the transferrin receptor [14] . Some of the membrane proteins listeo occur as monomers [20] , others as homo-oligomers [11,631 or as hetero-oligomet~, An example for the latter is the insulin receptor, in which only the ~-subunit is palmitoylated [17, 18] . Beside the plasma membrane, internal membranes may also contain proteins with covalently linked fatty acid, e.g., the Golgi-located man. nosidase II and galactosyltransferase [29, 30] as well as the proteolipid component of sarcoplasmic Ca 2\u00f7-ATPase [7, 38] . Recent more generalized studies of the intracellular location of palmitoylated proteins showed that most of them are membrane bound [76] [77] [78] . However, the phenomenon is more complex in a functional sense, since a small group of palmitoylated proteins are secreted by the cells [ [65] (see below) all RNA-and DNA-viruses with a lipid envelope analysed so far contain at least one structural protein with covalently hound palmitic acid. These are all located in the viral envelope, and except for p 37 k of vaccinia virus [70] , are also glycosylated, it is noteworthy ~.hat viral spike proteins with a known low pH-dependent fusogenic activity are palmitoylated (see below).\n\nWith viral non.structural proteins palrnitoylation is not as common a,~ myristoylation (see below). However. cells transformed by the non-enveloped viruses Simian virus 40, adenovirus and with the enveloped Harvey routine sarcoma virus express early proteins which become acylated and are located in the plasma membrane of the infected cells [72] [73] [74] [75] . where they may play a role in the process of cell transformation (see subsection IV-B).\n\nAs is apparent from Table I , palmitoylated acylproteins are found in organisms of different levels of complexity, in their evolutionary ra~)ge of occurrence they reach from the fungi Dictyost,.lium and yeast, across the angiosperma (Spirodela o/ sorrhiza ), across the non.vertebrates (sea urchin) up to the vertebrates. mammals and human. As mention\u00a2,i above, viruses from a variety of hosts as well as prokaryotes contain acylproteins. The latter group will not he dealt with, since it has been covered in a recent review by Wu and Tokunaga [80] . Although the list of palmitoylated proteins is extensive at this point, more acylated species will probably have to be added once the numerous acylproteins detectable after [)H]palmitoylation in vivo o( various vertebrate cells have been identified 113,8t-831.\n\nFrom the early studies of myelin proteolipid [5, 6] and of the a~lproteins present in the viral envelope [11,12.63,84] . it is clear that fatty acids are bound by ester-type linkage, since they can be released by mild alkali and hydroxylamine treatment. Stability studies utilizing these agents have si,z~ been applied routinely to identify ester-type acylation of most of the viral or cellular palmitoylated proteins listed in Table I . However, direct structural analysis of the palmitate linkage site proved to he a formidable task. Due to their unusual and unpredictable properties, peptides with covalendy bound fatty acid moieties derived [tom palmitoylated proteins were extremely difficult to purify [12, 85] . More indirect studies, as for instance limited proteolysis pointed to a location of the fatty acid linkage site close to the membrane spanning segment of acylated membrane proteins [14.63,85-88] . However, despite corn-parative analysis of the stability of the fatty acid linkage i: was initially not even possible, to decide conclusively between an oxygen-and a tbioesfer linkage of thc fatty acid to serine or cysteine, For instance, fatty acids linked to Semliki Forest virus (SFV) El-protein were released with hydroxylamine under the same conditions which cleaved the acetyl-group from o-acetyl serine, suggesting an o-ester linkage between fatty acid and El [89] . However, direct structural analysis has recently revealed a cysteine as the linkage site. and thus a lhioester linkage between protein and fatty acid (see below and gel'. 91).\n\nThe first direct identification of one of the two palmitoyl linkage sites present in myelin lipoprotein by sequence analysis came from Stoffei and co-workers. who had virtually unlimited supplies of this acylprotein from bovine brain. Their results showed that fatty acid is hound to a threonine residue located in the extracytosolic domain of one of the hydrophilic loops between two of the five membrane segments of lipophilin [90] .\n\nA similar protein chemistry approach was also utilized with three other palmitoylated acylproteins, HLA-D associated invariant (il) chain, VSV G.protein and SFV El-protein. In all three cases palmitic acid was found to he bound to cysteine in thioester linkage. The fatty acylated cysteine of the two viral acylproteins was located on the 'Cytoplasmic' (internal) face of the lipid bilayer with SFV-EI [911 and at the base of the carboxyterminal cytoplasmic tall with the VSV G-protein 1921 (compare schematic cl~ in Fig. 1 ). Prior to the biochemical identification of fatty acylation sites, other authors had turned to recombinant DNA technology to locate fatty acids within the primary structure of acylproteins. Replacement of specific cystcine residues suspected to represent the linkage site with serine after site-directed mutagenesis led to a loss of the covalant attachment of fatty acid during in vivo labeling expert. ments with the mutated ras-protein [93,94 I . the ras-like YPTI from yeast 151]. VSV G-protein [95] and the transferrin receptor 1971. The lack of fatty acylation clearly indicated an involvement of the mutated cysteine residues with fatty acid binding. However, it cot, l~ .~ ~,~ stated with certainty, that those cysteines were the actual linkage sites. Fortunately, the hypothesized Cys residues in fas 198] and the G-protein [92] have since been confirmed as fatty acid linkage sites by direct biochemical methods.\n\n\"/'he results of the various analyses of fatty acid av.achment sites in different palmitoylated proteins are summarized in Table II . Mainly from c~mparison of amino acid sequences around suspected a~Tlation sites of the ras family proteins, a consens~ sequence for palmitoylation has been proposed recently [99] . However, this so called CAAX-box (C for Cys, A for aliphatic and X for any amino acid) at the C-terminus is by definition a rather unprecise recognition sequence. It may be valid for the few pulmitoylated ras-type proteins only. When the primmy structures of other acylated and non-acylated membrane gi)~:oproteins are compared. due to the wide variabifty of amino acids around the putative palmitoylation sites, no recognition sequence can be deduced. The only structural theme common to the pahllitoylated spooks is the occumlcc of at least one cysteine residue usually within about four residues from the putative border between the inter leaflet of the lipid bilayer and th= cytoplasm [6~,|00 i. With the VSV G.protein the pulmitoylated cysteine residue was located seven residu~ into the cytoplasm [921. in a r~.~nt report Ovchitmikov and co-workers identified the acylation sites of bovine duxlopsin. The two fatty acylated cysteir~ residu\u00a2~ were located 13 and 14 amino acid residuet away from the membrane border into the cytoplasm. ~ authors suggest thmt using its fatty acids as anchors, this gegion of the protein loops back into the lipid bilaym of the photofeceptog membrane [1011.\n\nFrom early studies of palmitoylation of viral acylproteins in vivo. it has been apparent that this modification is an event which in the presence of ongoing protein synthesis can be detected by metabolic short pulse labeling [102] . in order to define the intracgllular location of palmitoylation, fatty acylation was related to the various stages of oligosaccharide prc~bsing, and to the timing of proteolytic processing and intracellular transport. The results of such experiments revealed that palmitoylation of VSV G-protein and Sindbis El and F,2 occurs shortly after translation and just prior to the acquisition of Endo H resistance [102|. While various trimming inbibitors (swainsonin. deoxynojirimy\u00a2in, castanospermin) either had no effect on palmitoylation (McDowell, W. and Schmidt. M.F.G.. unpublished results) or led to a stimulation [103] . the effect of tonicamycin depended on the 8Jycopwtein under study. While tunicamycin had no effect on the acylation of the HLA invariant-chain [26] , coronavirus E2 [104, 105] and mannosidase l! [30] , it completely abolished palmitoylation of VSV G-protein [12] and of the sodium channel 122l. Thus. it seems that the influence of tunicamycin on acylation is an indirect one. pefltaps by preventing transport of the slycoprotein to the acylation site [106] . This indicates, th~tt glycosylation per sc is not required for fatty acylation. Also other exlx~ments pointed to a crucial intracellular location for paln'itoylation to operate. \"rs-mutants of the G.protein defective in transport between the ER and Golgi couM not be acylated at nonpermtssive temperatures !12] . whereas blockin8 of transport bciwggn the Golli and the plasma membrane with rnonensin had no influence on fatty acylation [107] . partment (e.g., Ref. Ii0). However. mote recent data proved that palm[tic acid binding begins at an even earlier stage. By cell fractionation after extremely sh~ pulses (20 s) with [3H]palmitic acid in SFV infected bP.by hamster kidney cells (BHK), most of the [3H]palmitoylated F-protein was found in the rough ER fraction [111] . After establishing an in vitro system of acylation, which utilizes deacylated exogenous SFV E1acceptor protein [54] , particular membrane fractions could be tested for protein fatty acyltransferase (PAT). Studies with such a cell-free system using viral acceptors revealed the highest specific activity of PAT in the rough ER fraction [111] . The use of transport mutants revealed that early acylation occurs also with yeast cell giycoproteins [112] and different Ts-mutants of the influenza hemagglutin (Veit, M., SchmidL M.F.(3. and Klenk, H.D., unpublished results). Recently a chimeric construct between a fragment of the influenza hemagglutinin joined to the C-terminus of nearly compleie rat growth hormone was shown to be palmitoylated. Since this hybrid protein failed to be transported to the C-olgi apparatus, the authors concluded that fatty acid addition occurs in a fraction of the ER which they termed smoot ER cistemae [113] .\n\nAlthough the evidence for early acylaticn of the above proteins seems quite solid, contrasting results were obtained with other cellular acylproteins, as for instance mucus glycoproteins, myelin apolipoproteins and the SV40 large T-antigen. Utilizing an in vitro assay for palmitoylating mucus glycoproteins from gastric mueosa, SIorniany and co-workers reported the Golgimembrane to be the location of paL'nitoylating ae.fivity [114] [115] [116] . However, the membrane fractions in that study were rather crude and had not been tested for marker enzymes. More recent reports on the detection of nascent peptidyl-tRNA with bound fatty acids by the same group, in contrast to their earlier reports, favor a cotranslational acylation of O-glycosylated mucus glycoproteins [117] .\n\nPalmitoylation in the vicinity of the late Golgi or the plasma membrane was reported for the large T-antigen [118] , the transferrin receptor [119, 120, 121] , myelin lipophilin [122, 123] and bovine rhodopsin [20] . However, with the two latter acylproteins autoacylation was observed [124,125,125a] , so that in these cases a different mechanism of fatty acid attachment may operate. Some non-enzymatic or autocatalytie acylation has also been observed with F_.2-protein in SFV-infected cells [112] . Such a process may not depend on cellular enzymes, but rather on the availability of acyl-CoA and a receptive conformation of the protein acceptor. The plasma membrane as a possible location for palmitoylation of cytoskeletal proteins resulted from studies with ankyrin in rabbit erythrocytes, which are devoid of nuclei and internal membranes [40, 126] . With plant cells, another compartment, the chloroplast, must have palmitoylating activity, since a number of thylakoidal proteins are acylated in that location both in vivo and in vitro (Ref. 58 and Mattoo, personal communication). Only a slight degree of palmitoylation was detected in the fungus Physarium polycep,~alum, but the location of the event was not identified. Interestingly, in this fungus most of the acylated proteins turned out to be myristoylated in amide linkages [127] .\n\nAlthough a definitive general statement on the intracellular location of protein acyltransferase is not yet possible, most data available indicate that enzymatic palmitoylation occurs soon after translation. Most likely this modification of proteins operates in an area which could be designated 'late ER', whatever such a location's cell biological features may be. One could speculate that fatty acylation may occur in the first set of vesicles leaving the ER with a cis-Golgi destination. This would fit with the hypothesis that fatty acylation may enhance vesicular transpor! which depends on fusion and fission of lipid membranes (see subsection IV-A1).\n\nFatty acids bound to acylproteins by ester-type linkage are metabolically dynamic. Omary and Trowbridge [14, 119] observed that the transferrin receptor could be labeled with 3H.fatty acid 48 h after its translation, and that the protein bound fatty acids 'turned over' more rapidly than the protein portion of the receptor. Similar observations were aiso reported for bovine rhodopsin [20, 126] , mannosidase II [30l, ankyrin\n\n[12g], ras-protein [129] and a number of cellular acylproteins with unknown iden'.ity [PI] . Recently, different half lives were repo~ for the acyl groups of different proteins of red blood cells [129a]. In accordance with those observations, Berger and Schmidt [130] detected an enzymatic activity in microsomal membranes of diverse origin, which specifically released fatty acids from exogenously added viral acyiproteins. This protein fatty acylesterase ~quires mild detergents, is completely inhibited at 4 \u00b0 or 60\u00b0C and by sodium dodecylsulfate, and is clearly distinct from the acylating enzyme protein fatty acyltransferase [130] .\n\nThe fact that acyl chains can be metabolically released from. palmitoylated proteins may be of some importance, because it allows the regulation of this hydrophobic modification. Therefore, whatever biological function a given paimitoylated protein may have, it can be switched on and off by fatty acylation or fatty acid release (deacylation by esterase), respectively. In addition to directly modulating biological functions of an acylprotein, specific intracellular locations of an acylprotein could potentially be controlled by acylation and deacylation. Thus, fatty aeylation of proteins could have the same regulatory potential as the well known phosphorylation of polypeptides.\n\nPalmitoylating activity has been measured in various cell-free systems utilizing exogenous or endogenous aceeptor proteins [111, 112, 115, 116, [123] [124] [125] 126, 128, 131, 132] . However, purification of a palmitoylating protein fatty acyltransferase (PAT) has not yet been achieved. Published data on the enrichment of thi~, enzyme are scarce. Partial purification of PAT by cell fractionation and chromatography on hyd.~oxylapatite has been r~.'ported, but no information with regard to structure of the PAT proteins was given [111J30]. In the same reports a PAT assay was used, which required exposure times of several weeks for the det~:t'on of [3H]palmitoylated E1 during SDS-PAGE ~.nalysis and fluorography [111, 130] .\n\nBy improving the cell-free assay for PAT in our laboratory to 500-fold increased sensitivity, fractionation of this activity on various chromatographic colunms is now possible [132a]. The key features of this new assay are threefold. (1) High specific radioactivity [3H]palmitoyI-CoA prepared by enzymatic synthesis with microbial acyI-CoA synthetase was utilized as lipid substrate. (2) Purified deac~lated and hydroxylamine free El-protein from Sen',:'iki Forest virus was used as exogenous acceptor for fatty acid. (3) Microsomal membranes from human placental tissue were identified as a rich source of protein fatty acyltransferase (PAT) (132b). Utilizing this powerful assay, the enzymological characterization of PAT as well as its protein chemical characterization are presently in progress. Initial results show that PAT is an enzyme of complex structure, which is bound to membranes of the rough ER (Schmidt, M.F.G. and Bums, G.IL, unpublished data).\n\nDespite this early state of analysis of ester type acylation of proteins, some information is available on its substrate requirements. It has been established that the activated form of fatty acid, acyl-coenzym\u00a2 A, m~cls to be available to allow the acyltransfer onto protein.\n\nAlternatively, free fatty acid can also be transferred in the presence of ATP, Mg ~+ and coenmjme A, provided the source of PAT has intrinsic acyI-CoA synthetase activity [115, 116, 123, 133, 13, 1] . Since a variety of acyl species have been identified in different 'palmitoylated' acylproteins [65, 83, 135] , fatty acyk *ion into es',er-type linkage was not expected to be very ~l~'\u00a2ific with regard to the fatty acyl species. Nevertheless, comparison of acyI-CoA substrates with different chain lengths in cell-free acylation revealed a preference for palmitoyl-CoA [135] . Studies in our laboratory with enriched preparations of PAT revealed that palmitic acid (16:0) is preferred over shorter as well as longer aeyl chains. Likewise, unsaturated acyl species are less well incorporated into E1 acceptor protein when compared to the saturated species of the same chain length (Schmidt, M.P.G., Qanbar, R. and Burns, G.R.. unpublished data). %imilar results were recently reported for the acylation of the traasferrin receptor. In a study of acylalion of reticulocyte proteins in vivo and in vitro. Adam During several studies of acyi specificity of ester-type acylation of proteins by metabolic labeling, it has become apparent that the fatty acids utilized are subject to interconversion into other fatty acid species or to amino acids [65, 83, 135, 137] . Thus, if radioactivity from [3H]palmitic acid used for labeling is eventually detected in a given protein, this does not necessarily imply that pal, nitic acid is actually bound. A warning example for this feature is provided by the first report on the acylation of the RSV transforming protein pp60 ~\" with 'palmitic acid\" [138] . This acylation was later found to represent the highly specific myristoylation. Thus, the tiny fraction of myristic acid arising from interconversion [135] must have been selectively utilized for incorporation into ppr0 \"~ [139, 140] . Likewise, various viral or cellular acylproteins were labeled when normal and virus-infected cells were grown in the presence of [3H]myristic acid. Yet, when the pmified proteins were analysed for fatty acid [65, 135] , they contained mainly [3H]palmitic and [3Hlstearic acid. The extent of elongation and/or desaturafion of radioactive fatty acids duriog the labeling period was observed to vary considerably when different cell types were compared [831. Likewise, the spike glycoproteins of influenza C virus, after labeling with [~H]palmitic acid. were found to contain predominantly stearic acid (Veit, M., Herrler, O. ,'rod Schmidt, M.F.(3., unpublished data. It wil be of interest to determine whether the stn~cture of these proteins specifies selection for one acyl .~peeies ,~!8:0) or whether these particular proteins follow a different route of maturation. On such a new pathway they might encounter a new type of protein fatty acyltransferase. Alternatively, only restricted pools of acyI-CoA substrate may be available. Further development of cell free assa) systems for palmitoylation and their application with different protein acceptors will help clarify such issues.\n\nThe covalent binding of myristic acid to the Nterminus of a protein was first detected with cAMP-de-pendent protein kinase. When Cart et al. [141] sequenced the catalytic subunit of this kinase they found a blocking group at the N-terminus. Gas chromatographic and fast atom bombardment (FAB)-mass spectrometric analysis of peptides derived from the Nterminus revealed the presence of myristic acid in amide linkage to N-terminal glycine [141] . Shortly thereafter, and employing similar analytical procedures, two further proteins were found to contain N-terminal myristic acid, calcineurin (a Ca ~*-and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase [142] ) and the rough ER-Iocated NADH-cytochrome-/~ s reductase [143] . With the above-mentioned cellular acyl proteins and with the retroviral coded gag-protein p15 [144, 145] , an amide linkage between myristic acid and N.terminal glycine was established by analyzing non-labeled peptide material with a combination of biochemical [146] and the above-mentioned physical techniques. In all other and subsequent reports on myristoylated proteins (see below) a less sophisticated method was employed for identification. This involved metabolic labeling with [3H]myristic acid, PAGE analysis of cell lysates after immunoprecipitation, and (unfortunately not in all cases) fatty acid analysis after HCI-hydrolysis of the gel purified acylprotein. Table III lists all myristolyated proteins reported to date. It reveals that many of these polypeptides are [82, 147] , p56 [148] , p36 [149] , pp60 v .... [138, 140] and p28 coded by 3'orf of the AIDS virus [150, 151] , as well as particular a-subunits of. GTP-binding proteins [152, 153] .\n\nThe biochemistry of myristoylation has been studied in great detail by Gordon, Glaser, Towler and coworkers. These authors have recently achieved the purification of an enzyme from yeast cells, which transfers myristic acid onto synthetic octapeptide acceptors [163] [164] [165] . They designated this enzyme N-myristoyl transferase (NMT). It has been known for some time, that non-acylated proteins can be myristoylated in vivo once they contain the N-terminal region of myristoyiated proteins fused onto their N-terminus [166] [167] [168] [169] . By systematically altering the sequence of synthetic peptides homologous to the N-terminus of myristoylated cAMP-dependent protein kinase, it was possible to get some information on the substrate specificity of NMT in vitro. From their own results [170] , and from those reported by others [171] [172] [173] [174] , Towler and colleagues defined the structural requirements for Nmyristoylation in a recent review article. Accord:as to these data, a glycine residue at position I is an absolute requirement for the peptide to function as lipid acceptor. Proline or amino acids with bulky or charged side chains are not tolerated at positions 2 and 5, whereas a broad spectrum of amino acids is permitted at positions 3 and 4. Position 5 is occupied by serine in almost all myristoylated proteins identified so far. While Buss et al. [175] recently reported evidenc~e that the six aminoterminal amino acids of p60 ~'~ are sufficient for myristoylation, Kaplan et al. [176] find the requirement for a seventh amino acid with the same protein. They report that the seventh position should preferably be a lysine and must not be asparagine [176] . Both these reports utilize fusion proteins in which a short aminoterminal peptide from p60 s'\u00a2 extends the N-terminus of p21 r\"~ [175] or pyruvate kinase [176] . These data indicate that not all proteins with an N-terminal glycine will be subject to myristoylafion. In addition, there is evidence that even proteins with a 'good' recognition region for myristoylation may not be acylated. A prominent example for this is the GTP-binding protein transducin. Its N-terminus fulfills all the structural requirements described above and yet it fails to be myristoylated in vivo [153] . Surprisingly, synthetic peptides of this region of transducin become myristoylated in vitro [177] . It should be noted that prior to the attachment of myristate to the N-terminal glycine of a protein, the initiating methionine has to be cleaved. This cleavage occurs while the growing chain is still attached to the ribosome. It has been shown that NMT reveals no such proteolytic activity [165] , thus two enzymes must operate in concert to yield the myristoylated protein.\n\nA number of recent studies have addr.~.~.d the question of specificity for the lipid substrate of myristoylation. Utilizing the cell free system described above, Towler and Glaser revealed that the cocnzyme A thioester of myristate (14:0), but not of palmitate (16:0) operates as a lipid donor [163] . This observation is in agreement with former studies on the chemical analysis of amide.linked fatty acids [133, [141] [142] [143] 147] and reveals a remarkable specificity of NMT for this rare fatty acid. In a recent comprehensive study (;lover et at. [178] confirmed this exclusive specificity for tetradecanoic acid during transfer in vitro. However, in the same report palmitoyl.CoA, was found to bind to NMT from various rat tissues [178] . This competition in binding to NMT may have regulatory implications.\n\nSimilar enzymes with only slightly different substrate specificities have been partially purified from rat liver and plant cells [151, 177] . Thus, it seems that tlus enzyme is highly conserved throughout evolution, which may indicate a crucial biological function for myristoylation. It should be noted that a myristoylating activity is also present in wheat germ and reticulocyte lysates, which are used for in vitro translation experimcms [z511.\n\nlmmunocytochemical studies regarding the intracellular location of NMT are not available at present. However, after cell ~ractionation the enzyme is distributed between the soluble and crude membrane fraction [163] . Thos, NMT may be only loosely attached to cellular membranes or, more likely, is associaled with ribosomes. The later assumption is supported by the observation that nascent polypeptide chains isolated from ribosomes already contain myri tic acid [179] . This latter finding is compatible with the cotranslational attm,.hment of myristic acid after cleavage of the initiator methionine [180] . Myristoylation during translation had originally been shown by experiments in which myristoylation stops rapidly after addition of inhibitors of protein synthesis [10, 82, 83, 181] . From all these data it appears that myristoylation is dependent on ongoing protein translation. Consequently, the 14: 0 fatty acid at the N-terminus cannot be expected to \"turn-over', but instead remains stably attached to the polypeptide.\n\nRecently, it has been suggested that in macrophages a major substrate of protein kinase C becomes myristoylated after external stimulus with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1182, 183] . This implies that transfer of myristic acid to the 68 kDa target of protein kinase C occurs post-translationally, which is in clear contrast to the above-mentioned results. On the other hand, one of the reports by Aderem et al. [183] contains data indicating that Ireatment with inhibitors of protein synthesis prevznts myristoylalion of this protein. It seems, therefore, that LPS induces de novo synthesis of a myristoylated protein rather than the transfr of myristic acid onto a polypeptide, which has been translated before the stimulus. Alternatively, myristoylation of this particular target protein may be different from the well established N-terminal myristoylation. Future analysis of this substrate of protein kinase C will have to clarify whether myristic acid is really linked to the N-t~mlnus or to some internal lysinc or arginine.\n\nit should be mentioned at this point that some proteins do contain amide-bound fatty acids, which ate not linked to the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain. This was first shown for the acetylcholine receptor [15] . More recently, the same was found to be true for the insulin receptor [16] , the heavy and light chain of immunoglobulin M [154] , and other cellular proteins [48, 149, 184] . The fatty acids bound to these proteins have been analysed and revealed myristate [154] , palmitate [15, 184] or both acyl species [16] . An E-amino group of a lysine residue located near the membrane has been suspected to be the fatty acid binding site in the acetylcholine receptor [15] . N-Amidical acylation of ]gM occurs post-translationally during transit of this protein to the plasma membrane [154] , which is in contrast to the co-translational myristoylation of N-terminal glycine. More information on the biochemistry of this third probable type of acylation will be necessarj before its biological significance can be assessed.\n\nW. The fufmiol d IZmtdz Imm/lztty ~ Although many acylated polypeptides have I-~en identified, experimental studies concerning the function of protein bound fatty acids are still rate. The functional heterogeneity of the acylprotems occurring in phylogenetically distant organisms makes it near to impossible to deduce one or few biological functios of protein bound fatty acids, particularly for the palmitoylated species. Nevertheless, in almost each report on the acylproteins listed in Tables I and llI, potential functions are offered and discussed. However. at this early stage of research on hydropbobic modifications of proteins, most of the biological functions of acylation suggested, are still hypothetical, since they are often not sufficiently backed by experimental data. The most frequently recurring hypotheses for the biological runerio \u00b0 ,ff fatty a~flation of proteins will be discussed separately for palmitoylation and myristoylation.\n\nAddressing the function of palmitoyiated spike glycoproteins of envelope viruses, it has be~t suggested that protein bound fatty acid may be required for the fusion process between viral and cellular membranes [185] and for the release of newly synthesized virus particles from the infected cell [186] . The first experimental data in support of the former hypothesis comes from sl:udies by Lambrecbt and Schmidt, who compared the biological activities of acylated and deacylated influenza hemagglutin [89, 187] . Fusion activity of the glycoprotein was drastically impaired after release of protein bound fatty acids with hydroxylamine, whereas hemagglutinating activity and other properties of the viral surface glycoproteins were not affected.\n\nAlthough control experiments gave no indication of other effects of hydroxylamine than fatty acid release [89, 187] , it should be borne in mind that this agent has been used to cleave peptide bonds [188] . Involvement of protein bound fatty acid in the induction of membrane fusion is also supported by the fact that most acylated protein species found in enveloped RNA or DNA viruses are well known for their fusion-inducing property [189] . On the other hand, there are a few enveloped viruses which lack fatty acylated surface proteins and which are still able 1o enter their host cells by membrane fusion. Therefore acylproteins cannot be the only possible mediators of fusion [65, 79, 100] . To test the above hypothesis further, we are presently following an approach that utilizes the expression of mutated clones of the influenza hemagglutinin and of a paramyxovirus fusion protein both of which lack their fatty acid linkage sites (Veit, M., Klenk, H.-D. and Schmidt, M.F.G., unpublished data).\n\nFollowing our idea about the participation of protein bound fatty acids in triggering membrane fusion [185], Glick and Rothman suggested an involvement of fatty acylation in the fusion-driven transport of glycoproteins along the secretory pathway [190] . These authors investigated the transfer of VSV G-protein between Golgi vesicles in vitro. They observed that addition of palmitoyl-CoA to their cell-free transport assay had a highly stimulatory effect on the rate of glycoprotein transport from cisto medial Golgi-vesicles. Glick and Rothman, therefore, hypothesize that c>.cles of acylation and deacylation of an as yet unknown protein may facilitate protein transport by enhancing membrane fusion between the different populations of transport vesicles [190] .\n\nA potential contribution of acylation to the morphogenesis of virus particles has been drawn from experiments by Schlesinger and Mailer [186] in which vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infected cells were treated with cerulenin [191] , a putative inhibitor of protein fatty acyltransferase (PAT). The release of progeny virus particles was prevented by this antibiotic, although fatty acid-free glycoprotein was still transported to the cell surface, the location where new VSV particles assemble [87,1891. It is interesting to note that the maturation of viral spike glycoproteins includes an oligomerization step which yields, for instance, trimers in the case of the influenza hemagglutinin. It has recently been shown, by site-directed mutagenesis experiments, that this process requires the full membrane spanning segments of the respective glycoprotein (VSV G-protein, influenza HA) down to the carboxyterminns [192, 193] . A contribution. by hydrophobic interaction of fatty acids present in that area, to this process of trimerization is a likelihood. Experiments are under way to test this hypothesis (Veit, M., Schmidt, M.F.G. and Klenk, H.-D., unpublished; J. Kruppa, personal communication). Results which point to fatty acid involvement in protein-protein interactions have also been obtained with cellular acylproteins. When nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was synthesized without its fatty acids (i.e., in the presence of cerulenin) its five subunits failed to assemble to the heterooligomeric functional receptor [15] .\n\nWhile these above cases concern non-covalent interactions between polypeptides, Koch and Haemmerling [26] found that fatty acylafion of the invariant chain (il) prevents it from forming S-S linked dimers. This may be important for the essential non-covalent association of the il-polypeptide with MHC class II antigens (la in the moire and HLA-D in human).\n\nAlthough potential links between acylation and morphogenetic events based on p~'otein-protein interactions are now well documented, some resevervation with studies involving Ceruleinin as an inhibitor of acylation are due. Since this drug has an inhibitory influence not only on de novo synthesis of fatty acids, but also on the synthesis of lipids, RNA and proteins (Refs. 186 and 194 and Schmidt, M.F.G., unpublished observation), its effects on fatty acylation are difficult to interpret. Because of this lack of specificity of cerulenin, alternative ways of generating fatty acid free acylproteins for functional studies in vivo will have to be developed.\n\nAs stated above, some palmitoylated proteins are not membrane bound, but occur in the cytoplasm or in the extracellular space. As an example for secreto~ palmitoylated proteins Slomiany and co-workers reported that covalently linked fatty acids protect human gastric mucus 81ycoprotcin from proteolytic digestion [33,195. Interestingly, the stoichiometrie amount of covalently bound fatty acids in mucus glycoproteins is 2-or 3-fold higher in patients with cystic fibrosis compared to healthy individuals [196[ . The authors conclude that the increased fatty acid content may prevent normal turnover of these glycoproteins. Accumulation of such viscous and poorly soluble proteins may therefore lead to an obstruction of the various secretory glands, which is a characteristic clinical featu, e of cystic fibrosis [196] . Recently, the presence of fatty acids in mucus glycoproteins reported by Slomiar, y and co-workers [114-11\"/] has been challenged. Hans.son et ai. were not able to detect any stoichiometric fatty acid in highly purified preparations of porcine and human mucus glycoproteins [196al. It will be important to clarify whether the latter group might have cleaved the fatty acids during their elaborate purification procedure or whether Slomiany's group was operating with lr~,~parations of mucus glycuproteins which still contai:.~-~ other fatty acylated proteins.\n\nRecently' there is debate about the participation of GTP-bindin8 proteins in the transport of glycoproteins along the secretory pathway [197] . For instance, the yeast ras-like YPT 1 protein, which plays a role in trar, sport phenomena, is palmitoylated [511. Furthermore, acylation and deaeylation of a retroviral ras-prorein has been shown [129] . However, the question of whether or not this modification of ms (and/or the myristoylated OTP-binding proteins, see below) is actually involved in the transport process, has not yet been addressed. Since quite a number of cell surface receptors and the Na + channel [198] are palmitoylated, a regulatory involvement of protein-bound acyl chains in signal transduction can be regarded as a serious possibility. Impairment of coupling to the adenylate cyelase system has recently been reported for non-palmitoylated Cys--mutants of the human/~2-adrenergic recep-\n\nFor the ras-oncogene product it has been proposed that thioester.linked palmitate may serve the function of binding this peripheral membrane protein to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, where it may initiate the process of cell transformation. After changing the fatty acid binding cysteine residue (which is located near the terminal end of the polypeptide and conserved in all viral, mammalian and yeast ras proreins, see Table II ) to serine by site-directed mutagenesis, Willumsen and co-workers observed that the mutated protein is neither palmitoylated nor associated with membranes. Furthermore, the mutated ras-protein had lost its celbtransforming abilities [92, 94] .\n\nIn contrast to the hydrophilic ras-protein, palmitoylatecl integral membrane glycoproteins do not require covalently bound fatty acid for membrane attachment. Further, the transferrin receptor and VSV G-protein, do not require fatty acylation for intracellular transport. After replacing the acylation site by site.directed mutagenesis, these fatty acid-free glycoproteins are still transported to and stably attached to the plasma membrane [95, 97, 199] . The only report with a positive correlation between fatty acylation and transport of a protein from the Golgl apparatus to the cell surface was by Zilherstein et at. [2001, who utilized mutant strains of VSV in VERO-cells. in this study the possibili:y has not been fully excluded, that I~.ck of transport was due to other defects of the mutant protein than deficient acylation.\n\nThe above ideas on functions of protcin-linked fatty acids can only be valid if the acyl chains have the physical potential to interact with components in their environment rather than being packed inside the protein. A number of physical experiments reported in the literature indicate that this is indeed the case. In an early biophysical study, Petriet al.\n\n[201] labeled VSV G-protein with 16-(9-anthroxyloxy)palmitate and reconstituted it into phospholipid vesicles. Fluorescence anisotrophy measurements revealed that the labeled fatty acid is not buried inside the molecule, but is located in a phospholipid domain which does not undergo temperature-dcpendent phase transition. Thus, with this viral acylprtJtein, covalently bound fatty acids can influence their micro environment. In such an exposed position, acyl chains will also have the potential to interact with heterologous membranes in close proximity, or with any other hydrophobic surface.\n\nRecently, Joseph and Nagaraj [202] compared a 13 amino acid synthetic peptide which constitutes part of the membrane spanning segngnt of VSV G-protein before and after chemical palmitoylation; They find no direct modulation of peptide conformation with circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, but fatty acylation ap-~.~,,ly ~romotes self-association and a~sociation of the acylpeptide with miceUes [202] . Unfortunately, palmitie acid was bound amidically to the ~-amino group of a lysine located towards the N-terminus of the membrane segment, and not to the physiological cysteine linkage site just outside the lipid bilayer towards the C-terminus (Ref. 92; compare also Table I1 ). Thus, the peptide studied [202] may not allow any valid conclusion for the segment of G which is naturally fatty acylated.\n\nA different approach was followed by Bizzozero and Lees [203] who deacylated myelin proteolipid proteins by treatment with hydroxylamine for spectroscopic comparison with the fatty acyh.ted form. While the conformation of the acylated and deacylated for, n of lipoprotein in organic solution was about the fame, clear differences in folding emerged during spectroscopic analysis in an aqueous mileu. Although no deftaidve anchor fnncdon could be proven, the authors hypothesize from experiments with liposomes, that fatty acids attached to one of the external loops of this protein [90] could be important for maintenance of the lamellar structure of the normal myelin sheath [203] .\n\nIf acylation affects the conformation of a protein, it should also affect its biological activity. This was the case with fug~enic spike proteins of viruses. These proteins lost their fusion activty upon deacylation by hydroxylamine treatment of complete virus and of solubilized spikes although the overall conformation of the proteins was not affected to any detectable extent [187, 204] . Likewise, with deacylated mucus glycoproteins, sensitivity towards proteolytic digestion was much increased [33, 115, 195] . This latter phenomenon has also been observed with bee venom phospholipase A2. Utilizing an approach the reverse of that with virus spikes and mucus glycoproteins, McLeod and colleagues [205] chemically acylated phospholipase A z. By this well controlled modification, they rendered this enzyme much more stable against treatment with thiols and proteinases when compared to the fatty acid-free counterpart. Along with this protective effect resulting from covalent acylation, the authors found an activation of enzymatic activity [205, 206] .\n\nIt seems reasonable that a potentially exposed fatty acid in covalent linkage would promote interaction of an acylprotein wi'~h a hydrophobic environment in its vicinity. Experimental data emphasize this view. By chemically acylating IgG, Eueng et al. [207] were able to stably anchor this usuall~ g ater-soluble protein into liposomes, a technique of potential use in drug targeting. Likewise, the hydrophobic protein a-bungarotoxin was partitioned into a lip;.d bilayer by chemical addition of a single palmitoyl residue [208] . Not only that, 'artificial' acylation of this toxin reduced its receptor affmity to one twentieth of that of the non-acylated (natural) counterpart [208] . This implicated the potential of acylation and deacylation to modulate the biological activity of any given acylprotein (see subsection II-C2).\n\nWater-soluble enzymes may acquire the abifity not only for binding to vesicles, but also for complete translocation across lipid membranes. This has recently been shown elegantly by Levashov et al. [209] for stearoylated proteinases. The authors found that only after chemical stearoylation could trypsin or thymetrypsin reach a substrate enclosed in muitilameilar liposomes [210] . This finding indicates the potential of protein.bound fatty acids, to aid in the translocation of proteins across lipid bilayers. Although all these latter data may point to an anchor function of protein bound acyl chains (see next subsection) or to similar protein-lipid interactions, one should bear in mind that many palmitoylated proteins (unlike the glypiated polypeptides [1] [2] [3] [4] ) already have a membrane spanning segment to keep them insterted in the ER membrane during synthesis. Nevertheless, additional fatty acids inside or close to this hydrophoblc segment may still have an influence on the structure and biological activity of these limited regions. Furthermore, any structural changes in these areas may well be relevant to the overall three-dimensional structure of the respective acylprotein.\n\nFrom the previous subsection it has become apparent that fatty acids do modify the physical properties of a protein. Therefore it seems reasonable to expect that an otherwise quite hydrophilic protein develops a general affinity for membranes once it is myristoylated. However, the surprise comes with the fact, that a number of myristoy~,ated proteins are associated specifically with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane only, and not with any of the other intracellular membranes. The crucial involvement of N-terminal myristic acid in this specific interaction comes from a series of studies mainly with the transforming retroviral src-kinase (p60\"c). By replacing or deleting the amino-terminal glycine residue of this protein Kamps, Buss, Sefton and others were able to show that the mutated proteins are neither myristoylated nor membrane-bound. Furthermore, they show that the mutated molecules have lost their celltransforming abilities, although the protein's kinase activity is not affected [171, 172, [166] [167] [168] .\n\nThe abifity of N-terminal myristic acid to bind otherwise soluble proteins to the inner surface of the plasma membranes has also been confirmed for the gag-protein precursor (Pr65 s=s) of manuae!i~ relrovi.ms~. In this case the recombinant mutant proteins failed to b\u00a2 transported to the membrane, and as a result the release of progeny virus particles was prevented [176, 177] . In related experiments, Pellman and co-workers showed that a 14 amino acid peptide derived from the Nterminus of the src-kinase can direct myristoylation and membrane binding of the non-myristoylated and soluble protein product of the fps-gene [169] . Analogous results have also been reported for hybrids between tl~ myristoylated N-terminus of p60 \"'~ and both p21 \"\u00b0\" [175] and pyruvate kinase [176] . On the basis of such data, it has been speculated that amide-bound myristic aicd is a transport signal, which can target polypeptides to the inner surface of the plasma membrane [173, 211] . At that location the myristoylated protein (e.g., p60 ~'c) is believed to interact with putative receptors for N-terminal myristic acid. Due to the specific topological positioning of this protein, its intrinsic kinase activity will ensure phosphorylation of the 'right' target protein [140, 1471 . Although this attractive hypothesis may be valid for myristoylated retroviral src-kinases, it is difficult to reconcile with the fact that some myristoylated proteins are either Soluble (e.g., cAMP-dependent protein kinase, [141] ), bound to the ER (e.g., cytochrome reductase, [147] ) or accumulate in the cell's nucleus (e.g., VP2 of polyoma viruses, [155] ). Two more exceptions need to be mentioned. While the myristoylated src-gene products of the transformation-defective mutants ts NY 68 [147] and NY 18-3 occur in the cytoplasm [212] , the avian src-gene product is not myristoylated at all, but is nevertheless located on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane [213] .\n\nThe use of site-directed mutagenesis allowed assay for the involvement of myristoylation in processes other than membrane anchorage. On the basis of such comparative studies, myristoylation of structural proteins of tumor and other non-enveloped viruses was suggested to be important for intracellular transport of retroviral gag-proteins [174] and for the assembly process of different viruses [166, 119, 120, 170, 214] . In this respect, the report by Streuli and Griffin [155] is noteworthy. These authors found myritoylated VP2 protein in the nucleus of cells infected with polyma and SV40 virus. They suggest that myristoyl-VP2, while an:hored in the nuclear membrane, could position the newly made viral DNA for nucleation of capsid assembly [155] . Involvement in capsid packaging was also proposed for myristoyl chains bound to VP4 pro'ein of the RNA containing polio and foot and mouth disease virus [157, 158] . Although the myristoylated polio virus VP4 it packaged inside the capsid, it possibly participates in the entry of virus particles into the host cell. Since a cellular membrane has to be passed during this process, myristic acid linked to the amino terminus of VP4 could well serve a function similar to the one suggested for palmitoylated fusogenic proteins of enveloped viruses [215] . VP4 is the first protein to vanish during entry of this virus into the cell [216] [217] [218] , which may be indicative of its prime involvement in this crucial process. However, only future research will clarify whether a general mechanism for fusion-mediated entry of viruses into host cells operates in nature, which is enhanced by protein-bound fatty acids.\n\nFatty acylation of proteins is a modification as di. verse and complicated in many respects as glycosylation or phosphorylation. Owing to a number of distinct biochemical features, two major types of this hydrophobic modification can be distinguished, palmitoylation and myristoylation. Both are enzymatic processes which covalently modify proteins mainly on internal cysteine and N-terminal 81ycine residues. Both types of aeylprotein occur in many different organisms as well as in many different intracellular locations. This fact and the sc, arcity of experiments ~vhich assess fatty acid function make it difficult at present to offer any unified theories on the biolosical function of palmhoylation or myristoylation. What emerges from the literature in this respect is perhaps that protein bound acyl chains contribute to a variety of different biological functions rather than to just on~ The unifying concept in all of these are the interaction of the covalently fir ked fatty acids with hydrophobic components present in their immediate environment. The dynamic nature of palmitoylation, which is mainly found in membrane glycoproteins, may mean that this modification plays a role in modulating the structure and function of the membrane spanning segments of such proteins, as for instance in signal tra.n.sd,_,,:_!i_on and mem.,brane fusion. The 'once and for ever\" myristoylation of a prolein seems to be mainly responsible for anchoring this \u2022 '.cylprotein to specific membrane locations, often to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Only in such a topological orientation can the myristoylated protein exert its function, which may be, \"or instance, to phosphorylate particular target proteins to initiate a cascade leading to various biological consequences. This is not the place to discuss the many exception from these two 'major' hypothetical functions of palmitoylation and myristoylation. It seems, once again nature does not follow our simplyfying ideas. However, with the recent purification of N-myristoyl transferase (NMT) and progress in the characlerization of the palmitoylating enzyme, protein fatty acyltransferase (PAT), we may soon be able to gain a deeper insight into this hydrophobic modification of proteins."}
