{"title": "Structural characterization by transmission electron microscopy and immunoreactivity of recombinant Hendra virus nucleocapsid protein expressed and purified from Escherichia coli", "body": "Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a constantly evolving threat and a significant burden on public health and the global economy. In today's transient society, EIDs represent a serious public health concern due to their high potential to cause widespread epidemics and pandemics. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (>60%), characterized by ''species-jumping pathogens'', the majority of which originate in wildlife and are able to replicate in humans [1] . The most pathogenic of the zoonotic diseases are those caused by RNA viruses, which have an unmatched ability to replicate in the new host species' cytoplasm [2, 3] . Bats have been identified or implicated as the natural host reservoir for an increasing number of new and often deadly zoonotic viruses [4, 5] . Examples (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Japanese Encephalitis virus, Ebola filovirus, Rabies lyssavirus, and the Paramyxoviridae including Hendra and Nipah virus [6] .\n\nIn 1994, Hendra virus (HeV) was first described as the causative agent for an outbreak of a severe and fatal respiratory disease occurring in horses in Northern Australia, followed by the fatal transmission of the disease to two humans working in close contact with these animals [4, [7] [8] [9] . Since then there has been more than 48 sporadic Hendra virus outbreaks in Australia, killing four of the seven humans known to be infected with the virus and many horses [9] . In 1998, a deadly outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs and abattoir workers in Malaysia was caused by the very closely related henipavirus species, Nipah virus (NiV) [4, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Outbreaks of NiV continue to occur throughout South-East Asia, India and Bangladesh. Both HeV and NiV are highly pathogenic in a wide variety of mammals, with mortality rates approaching 60%. Symptoms include; pulmonary hemorrhage and edema, encephalitis and meningitis.\n\nA number of pteropid bat species, including flying foxes (fruit bats) have been identified as the natural wildlife reservoir for dispersing HeV and NiV [6] ; however, these animals tend to be asymptomatic when infected with the virus and little is known about the factors that trigger viral spill-over to humans or other animals. Our colleagues have recently identified the existence of a closely related, but non-pathogenic henipavirus; Cedar virus (CedPV), which is also transmitted by pteropid bat species [14] . Laboratory studies utilizing guinea pigs have demonstrated that CedPV can replicate in these animals, develop neutralizing antibodies, but remain clinically well [14] . The absence of therapeutic treatments for HeV and NiV, together with the susceptibility of humans to both viruses and their high virulence, has led to the classification of HeV and NiV as Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) pathogens [8, 9, 15] . A vaccine for HeV (Equivac \u00d2 ) has recently been developed for use in horses that is effective at protecting them from HeV infection, breaking the only known transmission mechanism from bats to humans [9, [16] [17] [18] .\n\nHeV and NiV are members of the genus Henipavirus, and belong to the RNA virus family Paramyxoviridae, order Mononegavirales (non-segmented negative sense single-stranded RNA viruses (nsNSRV)). The close relatedness of both HeV and NiV is further demonstrated by the observation that antibodies produced against one virus can neutralize the other in serum neutralization assays, albeit with reduced efficiency [16] . The genomic RNA from HeV and NiV along with other nsNSRV (e.g. Measles virus) encodes the six major viral structural proteins; nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), attachment glycoprotein (G), and the large protein (L) (RNA polymerase) [8, 11, 19, 20] , the most abundant protein being the N protein [21] [22] [23] . The size of both the HeV genome (18.234 kilobases) and NiV genome (18.246 kilobases) are considerably larger than other paramyxoviruses (average size 15.6 kilobases), and fit the ''rule of six'', which stipulates that the paramyxovirus RNA polymerase will only replicate efficiently if the viral genome is a multiple of six nucleotides (6n + 0 nucleotides) [20, 24, 25] . Interestingly, the length of these genomes is somewhat closer to the length of the genomes of family Filoviridae viruses (18.9-19.1 kilobases), which includes Ebola and Marburg viruses [26, 27] . The N protein of NSRV forms a complex with viral RNA (N-RNA), which then associates with P and L to form a stable ribo-nucleocapsid protein complex (RNP) required for the transcription and replication of viral RNA [28, 29] .\n\nThe C-terminal region of recombinant NiV N is the most immuno-reactive domain of this protein. Previous studies have indicated that only the C-terminal region of a series of deletion mutants of NiV N was recognized by sera from humans and pigs naturally infected with NiV [23] . In this study, we have expressed and purified recombinant full-length HeV N (HeV N FL ) and a C-terminally truncated form, HeV N CORE using an Escherichia coli protein expression system. Both recombinant HeV N proteins self-assembled into the classic morphological RNP structures previously observed with other recombinant paramyxovirus N proteins in the absence of viral genomic RNA and viral proteins. Furthermore, both recombinant HeV N proteins were immuno-reactive with sera from HeV and NiV naturally or laboratory infected humans and animals.\n\nAll transformation steps were carried out using the E. coli strains XL1 Blue F 0 and BL21 AI using chemical or electro-competent cells and standard procedures. The production of plasmid DNA was in XL1 Blue F 0 cells and the production of recombinant protein in BL21 AI, cells were cultured in 2\u00c2 YT Medium [1.6% (w/v) tryptone, 1.0% (w/v) yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl] or Terrific Broth [1.2% (w/v) tryptone, 2.4% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.4% glycerol buffered with 1/10th volume of 0.17 M KH 2 PO 4 , 0.72 M K 2 HPO 4 ], respectively. The media was supplemented with 100 lg/mL ampicillin for both XL1 Blue F 0 and BL21 AI.\n\nViral genomic RNA was extracted from inactivated virus pellet using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). The TimeSaver cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia) was used to make total cDNA using random hexamer primers. The construction of fusion protein expression plasmids has been described previously [19, 30] . Briefly, the HeV N FL gene coding sequence (amino acids residues 1-532; GenBank: AAC83187.1) was amplified directly by PCR from cDNA template with forward primer 5 0 -TTCAAGATCTCAA-AATGAGTGATATATT-3 0 and reverse primer (5 0 -CTCTTGAATTC-ATTTATAAGAGTGTGTC-3 0 with the underlined regions representing recognition sites for the restriction endonucleases BglII and EcoRI respectively. The PCR product of HeV N fragment was purified through QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen) and digested with BglII and EcoRI under standard conditions and ligated using T4 DNA ligase (Promega) into the linearized T7 expression vector pRSET-C (Life Technologies) previously digested with the same two enzymes [31] . The HeV N CORE coding sequence (amino acid residues 1-402; GenBank: AAC83187.1) was chemically synthesized as an E. coli codon-optimized sequence (GeneArt \u00d2 , Life Technologies). BamHI and NheI restriction endonuclease sites were engineered at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of the HeV N CORE coding sequence to facilitate cloning into a pET43.1a (Novagen) protein expression vector that we had previously modified. This modified pET43.1a protein expression vector had the 5 0 NusA and S tags replaced with a His x6 tag, and the Enterokinase and Thrombin protease cleavage sites replaced with a TEV protease cleavage site followed by a 5 0 BamHI and 3 0 NheI restriction sites to facilitate gene cloning. The HeV N CORE pET43.1a expression plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing.\n\nSmall-scale recombinant protein expression studies were performed by inoculating a single colony into 10 mL 2\u00c2 YT media containing ampicillin (100 lg/mL) and glucose (2.0%) overnight at 37\u00b0C, with shaking at 160 rpm. The overnight cultures were used to inoculate 10 mL fresh 2\u00c2 YT media (HeV N FL ) or Terrific Broth (HeV N CORE ) containing ampicillin (100 lg/mL) and glucose (0.1%) at a starting OD 600nm of 0.1 and the culture was grown at 37\u00b0C, 160 rpm, until an OD 600nm of 0.5 was reached, at which point the temperature was reduced to 26\u00b0C for HeV N FL and 18\u00b0C for HeV N CORE . At an OD 600nm of 0.8, the expression of both HeV N constructs was induced by the addition of 1.0 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, GoldBio) and 0.25% arabinose (Sigma-Aldrich) and protein expression monitored over \n\nLarge-scale recombinant protein production was performed by inoculating a single colony into 150 mL 2\u00c2 YT media containing ampicillin (100 lg/mL) and glucose (2.0%), and cultured at 37\u00b0C, overnight with shaking at 200 rpm. The overnight culture was used to inoculate 1.0 L media containing antibiotics in a 2.5 L baffled plastic Erlenmeyer flask [HeV N FL (2\u00c2 YT media) and HeV N CORE (Terrific Broth) ]. The cultures were grown at 37\u00b0C, 200 rpm, until an OD 600nm of approximately 0.5 was reached and the temperature was reduced to 26\u00b0C (HeV N FL ) and 18\u00b0C (HeV N CORE ). At an OD 600nm of 0.8 protein expression was induced with the addition of 1 mM IPTG (GoldBio) and 0.25% arabinose (Sigma-Aldrich) and the cells grown for a further 4 h at 26\u00b0C (HeV N FL ) or 20 h at 18\u00b0C (HeV N CORE ). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 4\u00b0C, 15 min), and cell pellets stored at \u00c080\u00b0C.\n\nCell pellets (50 g) were resuspended in 500 mL ice cold His A buffer [20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 500 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole] containing 50 mg lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich), five EDTA-Free cOmplete Protease inhibitor tablets (Roche) and 2500 Units Benzonase \u00d2 (Merck Millipore). Additional protease inhibitors were added to the lysis buffer for HeV N FL : 2 mM AEBSF PefaBloc (Roche), 2 mg/mL Benzamadine (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 lg/mL Aprotinin (GoldBio). Following resuspension, the E. coli cells were ruptured by passage three times through an EmulsiFlex-C5 cell homogenizer, (15,000 psi at 4\u00b0C, Avestin) and centrifuged (Beckman JA 16.250, 12,000 rpm, 15 min, 4\u00b0C). The lysate was then loaded at 2.5 mL/min onto a 5 mL IMAC column (HisTrapFF, GE Healthcare) that had previously been equilibrated with His A buffer. The column was washed with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 500 mM NaCl and 40 mM imidazole to remove weakly bound proteins, and HeV N proteins were eluted with step gradients of His A buffer containing 300 and 500 mM imidazole.\n\nFractions eluted from the IMAC column containing HeV N were pooled and concentrated using a centrifugal Ultra-15, 10,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane (Merck Millipore). The concentrated protein was then fractionated by SEC using a HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) for HeV N FL and a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) for HeV N CORE. These columns were previously equilibrated in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 500 mM NaCl and 5% glycerol. Peak fractions containing either HeV N FL or HeV N CORE proteins were pooled and then concentrated and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at \u00c080\u00b0C.\n\nAnalytical expression studies and the large scale production of recombinant HeV N were monitored by both SDS-PAGE and Western blotting under reducing conditions on 4-12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels (Life Technologies) using MES electrophoresis buffer. Samples were incubated with SDS sample buffer and heated to 95\u00b0C for 5 min prior to loading onto gels. Protein gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Replicate gels were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting. The membrane was blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) skim milk powder for 30 min, followed by incubation with an anti-polyHistidine Peroxidase Conjugate antibody (A7058, Sigma-Aldrich) to detect His x6 -tagged proteins. The membranes were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (v/v) before being developed using the chromogenic substrate a-chloronaphthol (Sigma-Aldrich).\n\nPurified HeV N FL and HeV N CORE were desalted by reverse-phase HPLC (Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC) using a C18 Jupiter column (Phenomenex), and the proteins eluted directly onto a microTOF-QII electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (Bruker) using a gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. The mass of the resulting peaks were determined by maximum entropy-based deconvolution algorithms.\n\nCarbon-coated 300-mesh copper grids were glow-discharged in nitrogen to render the carbon film hydrophilic. A 4 lL aliquot of each HeV N protein (0.03 mg/mL) was pipetted onto separate grids. After a 30 s adsorption time, excess liquid was drawn off using Whatman 541 filter paper, a 5 lL water wash applied, followed by staining with 2% phosphotungstic acid for 10 s. Grids were air-dried before use. The samples were examined using a Tecnai 12 Transmission Electron Microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at an operating voltage of 120 KV. Images were recorded using either a Megaview III CCD camera and AnalySIS camera control software (Olympus), or a FEI Eagle 4k \u00c2 4k CCD camera. Measurements were made using ImageJ software (http:// rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).\n\nMicrosphere coupling was carried out using 20 lg of HeV N FL or HeV N CORE coupled to 1 \u00c2 10 6 carboxylated MagPlex \u00d2 microspheres (Luminex Corporation) using the standard coupling procedure [32] . Control microspheres for HeV, NiV and CedPV soluble-glycoproteins (sG) were coupled by the same method and the assay carried out as described [32] . Briefly, the assay was performed in 96-well micro-titre plates where 1000 coupled microspheres were added to each test well. The beads were blocked with 2% skim milk and mixed with the test sera diluted 1:100 in phosphate-buffed saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich). The bound antibodies were then detected using biotinylated Protein A (Pierce) and biotinylated Protein G (Pierce) and streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Qiagen). The beads were interrogated by the lasers in a BioPlex \u00d2 200 suspension array system (BioRad) and the results recorded as the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of 100 beads.\n\nAll normal control sera were generated from healthy individuals. The horse natural infection sera were obtained from horses infected in the field in Queensland, the exact time post-infection was uncertain, however, the animals were recovering from the acute disease prior to euthanasia. Experimental horse sera were from animals infected with HeV at AAHL and euthanized 9 days post-infection. Vaccinated horses were prepared by intramuscular (IM) injection of Equivac \u00d2 HeV vaccine (Zoetis). Day 0 sera was taken prior to injection and day 42 sera was taken 42 days post the initial vaccination. Human HeV positive serum was derived from an infected human patient. Positive NiV pig antiserum was generated from a laboratory infection and taken 21 days post-infection. Rabbit recombinant HeV N antiserum was derived from a rabbit injected IM with 3 doses of HeV N protein with serum harvested 7 days after the third injection.\n\nThe plasmids pRC-HeV N FL and pET43a-HeV N CORE (Fig. 1) were transformed into E. coli BL21 AI for recombinant HeV N production. Protein expression was induced with the addition of 1.0 mM IPTG and 0.25% arabinose at 26\u00b0C (HeV N FL ) and 18\u00b0C (HeV N CORE ). The expressed proteins were analyzed at 4 and 20 h post-induction by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.\n\nA Coomassie Blue-stained protein band was observed migrating with an apparent molecular weight of $63 kDa which corresponded to the molecular weight expected for HeV N FL . This band was present at both 4 and 20 h time points in both soluble and insoluble fractions (Fig. 2A) . The identity of this band was confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-polyHistidine Peroxidase Conjugate antibody (Fig. 2B) . Increasing the time of protein expression to 20 h did not contribute to higher levels of soluble protein production, but resulted in increased levels of proteolysis and the formation of insoluble HeV N FL . As a result of these analytical experiments, a 4 h induction at 26\u00b0C was chosen for optimal HeV N FL protein production.\n\nThere was no detectable expression of the HeV N CORE (at the expected molecular weight of $46.5 kDa) on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel in either the soluble or insoluble fractions for both 4 and 20 h post-induction time points (Fig. 2C) . Western blotting of a replicate gel using the anti-polyHistidine Peroxidase Conjugate antibody revealed a faint band of the correct molecular weight in the soluble fraction from the 20 h time point, although the majority of this protein was found to be in the insoluble fraction at 20 h (Fig. 2D) .\n\nLarge-scale protein expression of recombinant HeV N FL and HeV N CORE was undertaken at 26\u00b0C or 18\u00b0C respectively, protein expression was induced with the addition of 1.0 mM IPTG and 0.25% arabinose, and cells harvested by centrifugation at 4 h post-induction for HeV N FL and 20 h post-induction for HeV N CORE . Both recombinant HeV N FL and HeV N CORE were purified Fig. 3A and B respectively) . This observation was consistent with both proteins forming higher order soluble oligomers. Western blotting using the anti-polyHistidine Peroxidase Conjugate antibody confirmed peak fractions eluting near the void volume were the His x6 -tagged HeV N proteins ( Fig. 4B and D) . Western blot analysis of HeV N FL indicated that the major dominant band was the full-length protein ($65 kDa), this was susceptible to proteolysis in E. coli (Fig. 4B ). Four C-terminally truncated forms of HeV N were identified by the anti-His-HRP antibody which identified the N-terminal His x6 tag on the protein. It is interesting to note that one of the smaller protease resistant fragments of HeV N FL migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 40 kDa (Fig. 4B) , which was very similar to the expected size of our expressed HeV N CORE (Fig. 4D) .\n\nThe gel filtration profile of the HeV N proteins was monitored at two wavelengths; 260 and 280 nm (A 260 and A 280 ) to enable us to simultaneously observe the nucleic acid and protein profiles of the preparation. The peaks which registered a high level of absorbance at 260 nm were the peaks from the chromatograms (Fig. 3A and B) containing fractions identified on the Western blots as containing His x6 tagged protein ( Fig. 4B and D) . The high level of absorbance at 260 nm indicates the presence of heterologous nucleic acids from E. coli, which have been purified in association with both the full-length and C-terminally truncated form of HeV N.\n\nThe HeV N FL fractions were pooled and concentrated to 2.5 mg/mL before freezing in liquid nitrogen. We reproducibly obtained 4.8 mg of purified HeV N FL from 6 \u00c2 1.0 L cultures grown in 2.5 L shake flasks with a yield of 0.8 mg/L of culture. The purified HeV N FL could be concentrated to between 1 and 2.5 mg/mL in the presence of 500 mM NaCl and 5% glycerol using a centrifugal concentrator with a 10,000 Da concentrating membrane without protein precipitation or aggregation occurring. We obtained lower yields for HeV N CORE ; with 2.0 mg purified from 6 \u00c2 1.0 L cultures in 2.5 L shake flasks with a yield of 0.35 mg/L of culture. The purified HeV N CORE could only be concentrated to approximately 0.3 mg/mL before precipitating out of solution.\n\nA mass of 63339.8 Da was observed for recombinant HeV N FL by ESI-TOF-MS.\n\nThis value was very close to the theoretical mass of 63339.4 Da, and was within the measureable experimental error attributed to the instrument. Purified HeV N CORE had a mass of 46453.7 Da, obtained by ESI-TOF-MS, which was 130 Da less than the expected mass of 46584.4 Da. The resultant difference could be attributed to the loss of a methionine residue from the N-terminus of the protein.\n\nNegative stain TEM analysis of recombinant HeV N FL and HeV N CORE was used to demonstrate their inherent property to spontaneously self-assemble and form helical chains of nucleocapsid proteins in the presence of heterologous nucleic acids.\n\nThe HeV N helical-like particles displayed similar widths but formed stacks of variable lengths (Fig. 5) . The width of individual particles were measured and averaged; HeV N FL particles ( Fig. 5A(a) ) was found to have a width of 20.6 \u00b1 2.4 nm (n = 46) and a central dark hollow pore with a diameter of approximately 6.83 \u00b1 1 nm (n = 31); the HeV N CORE particles (Fig. 5B(b) ) had similar dimensions with a width of 21.9 \u00b1 1.97 nm (n = 19) and a central pore diameter of approximately 6.5 \u00b1 0.86 nm (n = 16).\n\nThe antigenic recognition of these recombinant HeV N proteins to antibodies present in serum samples from animals and humans infected with either HeV or NiV through either natural or laboratory acquired infections as well as vaccinated and immunized animals were measured using a Luminex bead-based assay that is capable of detecting multiple analytes in a single assay.\n\nAn indirect bead-based assay was developed for testing reactivity of HeV N to a range of naturally infected or laboratory infected animal sera. The bead-based assay used in this study was based on Luminex technology and was similar to the binding assay described previously for HeV and NiV sG [32, 33] . The multiplexed Luminex assays included both, HeV N FL and HeV N CORE in addition to sG from HeV, NiV and CedPV. A number of different antisera were tested to determine the reactivity and specificity towards each protein (Fig. 6) . Animals infected either naturally or in the laboratory showed significant serological response to both forms of HeV N as well as the sG proteins for NiV and HeV but were negative for the closely related henipavirus, CedPV. Most of the normal non-immune sera from non-infected animals and humans displayed minimal reactivity to the HeV N proteins; however, there was some low level reactivity with both antigens to the vaccinated horse sera at both day 0 and day 42, neither of which would be expected to show specific reactivity. There was also some low level reactivity of normal pig and human sera with the HeV N CORE protein.\n\nThere are many reports on the expression of full-length or truncated constructs of NiV N [23, 31, [34] [35] [36] , however, there have only been limited studies on the production of recombinant, full-length HeV N [34, 36] . In this report, we describe the expression and purification of soluble full-length HeV N (HeV N FL ) and a C-terminal truncated core domain (HeV N CORE ) lacking the IDR using a bacterial expression systems. Size exclusion chromatography analysis of both HeV N FL and HeV N CORE suggest they are able to self-assemble into high order oligomeric complexes, possibly aided by the presence of bacterial nucleic acid which is acting as a substitute for viral RNA when these proteins are expressed in E. coli.\n\nThe SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and chromatographic analyses have shown that it is possible to express and purify from E. coli soluble HeV N for bead-based immune-assays and electron microscopy studies. Analysis of our expression results have indicated that the expression levels of the two HeV N constructs was significantly different. The C-terminally truncated HeV N CORE construct was expressed at levels at least 30% lower than HeV N FL . We have attempted to improve the expression levels and the solubility level of the HeV N CORE construct by changing the expression media to TB and reducing the expression temperature to 18\u00b0C. The expression level and solubility of a truncated version of the HeV N protein; HeV N CORE in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has also been reported to be lower than the full-length construct [34] . This observation is also consistent with the results for the expression of the homologous NiV N in E. coli from other studies [23] .\n\nTransmission electron microscopy studies on negative stained images of E. coli expressed HeV N FL and HeV N CORE reveal they have retained the ability to self-assemble into herringbone-like structures in the absence of both viral RNA and viral proteins. Similar observations have previously been made for NiV N expressed in E. coli and negative stain EM analysis indicated the presence of nucleocapsid-like herringbone particles of different lengths, morphologically resembling the structure of RNPs isolated from virus particles [23, 37] . EM analysis of HeV and NiV N expressed in S. cerevisiae also demonstrated that these proteins are able to form nucleocapsid-like herringbone structures and rings [34] . Detailed biophysical characterization studies have been undertaken on the N protein of another paramyxovirus, Measles virus (MeV) [38] [39] [40] . Full-length MeV N protein (MeV N FL ) was expressed and purified from E. coli, C-terminally truncated MeV N (MeV N CORE ) was prepared by limited proteolysis [38] . Negative-stain EM studies on these proteins revealed that MeV N CORE polymerizes into very long and extremely rigid helices [29, 38] , similar to the structures we observed for our HeV N CORE . Interestingly, their studies demonstrated that MeV N FL protein assembled into short and much less rigid helices or mostly only ring structures as we also observed with the HeV N FL images. They postulated that the intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail was responsible for the restricted of polymerization N monomers in full length N proteins [38] .\n\nAnalysis of the amino acid sequences of both the HeV and NiV N reveal that they do not contain any cysteine residues and subsequently disulfide bonds cannot be responsible for maintaining the tertiary structure of the protein complex. This suggests that the oligomerization of the paramyxovirus N protein is maintained by intra-or intermolecular, non-covalent bonds or by the viral or host expression system nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) or both [23, 41, 42] . Amino acid alignments identified four highly conserved hydrophobic regions in Paramyxoviridae N proteins [43] . The construction of a series of amino acid deletion mutants has enabled the identification of four small continuous stretches of amino acids responsible for the self-assembly of the N protein [37] . The removal of any of these domains prevented oligomerization of N monomers; however, the replacement of these deleted regions with the same conserved amino acid region from Newcastle Disease Virus N protein restored oligomerization [37] . These studies further demonstrated that the deletion of more than 129 amino acids from the C-terminus of the NiV N protein inhibited the formation of herringbone-like capsid molecules (NiV N and NiV N ), whereas the deletion of less than 128 amino acids did not prevent oligomerization or capsid formation (NiV N ) [37] . Contrary to those observations, our results indicated that HeV N CORE(1-402) is able to still able to form oligomers even with the deletion 130 amino acids, indicating the construct contains all the necessary amino acid residues for self-assembly. Detailed biophysical validation techniques such as analytical ultracentrifugation and multi-angle light scattering are needed to confirm whether HeV N FL and HeV N CORE exist as a stable multimer in solution.\n\nThe N proteins from other paramyxovirus, notably Measles virus (MeV) have been studied extensively, the C-terminal tail region has been observed to be extremely sensitive to trypsin digestion, leaving a protease-resistant N-terminal core region of approximately 43 kDa [29] . Further studies on MeV N protein have indicated that the hypervariable C-terminal tail appears to be at the surface of the N assembly with a structure that is not well-visualized by electron microscopy [38, 39] . This observation is also a potential indicator that the accessibility of the C-terminal tail region increases the susceptibility of the domain to proteolysis and likelihood of intracellular proteolysis when over-expressed in E. coli or other heterologous expression systems. These observations have been made for preparations of HeV N FL protein and NiV N FL expressed in E. coli and S. cerevisiae [34, 35, 44, 45] . Utilizing bioinformatics proteolysis prediction tools, it has been demonstrated that the proteolytic degradation of E. coli expressed NiV N could be reduced by the choice and concentration of specific serine protease inhibitors [35] . Our bacterial expression studies reveal a high level of proteolysis in the E. coli preparations of HeV N FL , despite the addition of an extensive cocktail of general and serine specific protease inhibitors to the cellular lysis buffer.\n\nThe N protein is the most abundant protein detected in infected cells; amino acid sequence alignments of NiV and HeV N FL indicate 92% sequence identity [11] . The N CORE(1-402) region of HeV and NiV is highly conserved (97% sequence homology), whereas the C-terminal tail is more variable, (75% sequence homology). It has been reported for other paramyxoviruses that the C-terminal tail region of the N protein harbors the majority of the antigenic epitopes [46] . The high level of sequence homology between the HeV and NiV N indicates that the HeV N is potentially a valuable antigenic reagent to enable the identification of potential animal hosts carrying either HeV or NiV serum antibodies which may or may not present acute symptoms following henipavirus infection.\n\nThe Luminex bead-based fluorescent microsphere assay has been developed for antibody detection and differentiation of HeV and NiV [33] , using a method described previously [32] . One of the complications with Luminex bead-based detection assay is the requirement for highly-purified and correctly folded proteins. The Luminex assay results from this study indicate that bacterially-expressed HeV N appear to provide both the purity and the quality of reagent suitable for the Luminex multiplex format, as both forms of the HeV N protein investigated are recognized by serum antibodies from animals or humans infected with either HeV or NiV.\n\nThe release of the HeV horse vaccine (Equivac \u00d2 ) presents a significant challenge for diagnosis of natural HeV infections in the field. The current assays utilize the vaccine antigen (HeV sG) and as such are unable to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). The gold standard diagnostic assay is the virus neutralization test which is also ineffective in determining if an animal has been infected or vaccinated. The Luminex assay results from this study indicate that either format of recombinant HeV N expressed and purified could be used equally well to detect antibodies in HeV-infected animals, as well as those infected with the closely related NiV, but are able to differentiate from other known henipaviruses (Cedar Virus (CedPV)), providing an important component of a DIVA assay. The low-level immunoreactivity seen with the HeV N CORE to normal horse, vaccinated horse, normal human and normal pig and to the vaccinated horse sera for the HeV N FL is most likely due to cross-reactivity to related paramyxoviruses, since the N protein of paramyxoviruses is highly conserved. There has only been limited optimization of the antigen coupling process in this assay and further adjustment may also increase the differentiation of positive and negative HeV sera lowering the threshold for negative sera. These proteins would need to be tested against large numbers of normal sera and against control sera for other paramyxoviruses to determine the levels of cross reactivity prior to their validation in DIVA assays. Despite this low-level reactivity, the promising results from the Luminex assay indicate that both forms of recombinant HeV N would be valuable antigens to differentiate animals which had been naturally infected with HeV from those vaccinated with the HeV soluble Glycoprotein (sG) vaccine. Additionally, they will also be valuable reagents for serological surveillance of henipaviruses in wildlife and domestic livestock when used along with the sG in multiplex assays. When used in combination they will provide an opportunity for the identification of antibodies to related viruses that would otherwise be missed by the specificity of the sG proteins.\n\nWe have successfully over-expressed and purified soluble recombinant HeV N FL and HeV N CORE using a bacterial expression system without the need of a solubility tag or fusion partner. Both HeV N FL and HeV N CORE form higher order oligomers as demonstrated by SEC and negative-stain TEM. Furthermore, monitoring the SEC profile at A 260 demonstrated that the higher order oligomers of both the HeV N FL and HeV N CORE retained the ability to bind E. coli nucleic acids in vitro, immunoblots with the anti-His x6 antibody confirmed that the proteins in these peaks were HeV N. TEM analysis revealed both forms of HeV N assembled into helical ring-like structures that very closely resembled paramyxovirus-like particles Using a Luminex bead-based immunoassay, we were able to demonstrate both recombinant HeV N FL and HeV N CORE were highly immuno-reactive towards sera from animals and humans infected with either HeV or its' very close relative, NiV, but not with sera from animals infected with a non-pathogenic Henipavirus, CedPV. Furthermore, by incorporating this antigen into the current assays we are now able to distinguish between animals infected with HeV (or NiV) and those vaccinated against this virus. The ability to identify infected from vaccinated animals will be a very useful tool for undertaking epidemiological studies and understanding infection and transmission dynamics of HeV between its' natural host reservoir pteropid bats and spillover targets domestic livestock and humans. The availability of correctly folded recombinant HeV N proteins, will also allow us to enhance the rapid, specific, and ultra-sensitive detection systems that do not require the use of live virus for detecting specific HeV antibodies in virus neutralization assays. \n\nAll the authors declare no competing financial, personal or other relationships with other people or organizations that could inappropriately influence, or be perceived to influence, the research within this study.\n\nAll authors declare that; the work described within this manuscript has not been published previously and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the studies were carried out, and that, if . Immunoreactivity of recombinant henipavirus nucleocapsid protein and soluble glycoprotein towards different anti-sera from infected and non-infected organisms in a Luminex bead-based assay.
