{"title": "Putative Receptor Binding Domain of Bat-Derived Coronavirus\nHKU9 Spike Protein: Evolution of Betacoronavirus Receptor Binding\nMotifs", "body": "The plasmids used for protein\nexpression were individually constructed by insertion of the coding\nsequences for HKU9-RBD (S residues S355\u2013N521, GenBank accession\nnumber EF065513), MERS-RBD (S residues E367\u2013Y606, GenBank accession number JX869050), SARS-RBD\n(S residues R306\u2013F527, GenBank accession number NC_004718), human\nCD26 (residues S39\u2013P766, GenBank accession number NP_001926), and\nhuman ACE2 (residues S19\u2013D615, GenBank accession number BAJ21180) into\nthe EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites\nof a previously modified pFastBac1 vector47 that was engineered to include an N-terminal gp67 signal peptide\ncoding sequence. For each protein, an engineered C-terminal hexahistidine\ntag was utilized to facilitate protein purification. To prepare mouse\nIgG Fc fragment (mFc)-fused proteins, the coding sequences of MERS-RBD,\nSARS-RBD, and HKU9-RBD were fused with the mFc sequence and then introduced\ninto the pCAGGS vector.35\n\nThe proteins used\nfor crystallization and SPR analysis were prepared with the Bac-to-Bac\nbaculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions.48 In brief, the verified\npFastBac1 recombinant plasmid was transformed into the DH10Bac competent\ncells to generate the recombinant bacmid. The bacmid was then extracted\nand transfected into Sf9 cells to prepare the baculovirus stocks.\nSf9 cells were further used to amplify the baculoviruses, while High5\ncells were used to express the protein.\n\nThe cell culture of\nHigh5 was collected 48 h postinfection. In total, 4 L of cell culture\nof each protein was collected and centrifuged at 6500 rpm for 1.5\nh to remove cell debris. After the samples had been filtered with\na 0.22 \u03bcm membrane, the supernatant was passed through two 5\nmL HisTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare) to capture the individual protein\nof interest. For MERS-RBD, SARS-RBD, human CD26, and human ACE2, the\nbound proteins were detached from HisTrap with 20, 50, and 300 mM\nimidazole in 20 mM Tris-HCl and 150 mM NaCl buffer (pH 8.0). After\nsodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE)\ndetermination, fractions detached with 300 mM imidazole were pooled\nand further purified with a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). For\nHKU9-RBD, the bound proteins were detached from HisTrap with 20, 50,\nand 300 mM imidazole in 20 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl buffer (pH 7.0).\nFractions detached with 50 and 300 mM imidazole were pooled and dialyzed\novernight against 5 L of 20 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl buffer (pH 7.0)\nto remove imidazole. The dialysates were concentrated and further\npurified with a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). Each protein\nwas stored in the buffer that was used for purification.\n\nTo\nprepare mFc-fused proteins with the mammalian cell expression\nsystem, the recombinant pCAGGS plasmids were confirmed with Sanger\nsequencing and then prepared with the EndoFree Maxi Plasmid Kit (Tiangen,\nBeijing, China). Each recombinant plasmid was transfected into 293T\ncells with 50 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA per T75 plate using polyethylimine\n(PEI, Polysciences Inc.). After being incubated for 5 h, the transfected\ncells were washed with PBS twice and then replaced with DMEM without\nserum. The cells were maintained for 3 days, and the supernatant was\nharvested and replaced with fresh DMEM medium and then maintained\nfor an additional 4 days. The harvested supernatants were pooled and\nconcentrated and then mixed with 2 volumes of 20 mM trisodium phosphate\n(pH 7.0). The mixture was passed through a 5 mL HiTrap Protein A HP\nprepacked column (GE Healthcare) to capture the individual protein\nof interest. After removal of impure proteins with 20 mM trisodium\nphosphate (pH 7.0), the bound protein was detached from the column\nwith 100 mM glycine (pH 3.0). Each fraction was neutralized with 1\nM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). After SDS\u2013PAGE determination, the detached\nfractions with the protein of interest were pooled and concentrated.\nThe buffer of each protein was then changed to PBS (pH 7.0) for further\nexperiments.\n\nThe BIAcore experiments\nwere performed at\n25 \u00b0C using a BIAcore 3000 or BIAcore T100 machine with CM5 chips\n(GE Healthcare). For all the measurements, an HBS-EP buffer consisting\nof 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20 was\nused, and all proteins were exchanged into this buffer in advance.\nFirst, the HKU9-RBD, MERS-RBD, and SARS-RBD proteins expressed in\ninsect cells were used for the SPR assay using a BIAcore 3000 machine.\nBSA (negative control), HKU9-RBD, MERS-RBD, and SARS-RBD proteins\nwere immobilized on the chip at \u223c1000 response units (RU),\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s amine coupling chemistry protocol\n(GE Healthcare). Gradient concentrations of human CD26 (0, 19.5 to\n5000 nM) or human ACE2 (0, 39 to 625 nM) were then passed over the\nchip surface. After each cycle, the sensor surface was regenerated\nvia a short treatment with 10 mM NaOH. The equilibrium dissociation\nconstants (binding affinity and KD values)\nwere analyzed using BIA evaluation (BIAcore software). To exclude\nthe possibility that HKU9-RBD could be nonfunctional because of immobilization\nor could be missing some important post-translational modifications\non the protein, we purified the mFc-fused HKU9-RBD proteins in mammalian\ncells and assessed the abilities to bind CD26 or ACE2 proteins using\na captured SPR method by a BIAcore T100 system. The CM5 chip was immobilized\nwith the anti-mouse antibody for flow cells 1 and 2 (FC1 and FC2,\nrespectively). The mFc-fused RBD proteins were then injected and captured\non FC2, while FC1 was used as a negative control. Human CD26 or human\nACE2 proteins were then injected, and the binding responses were measured.\nThe immobilized anti-mouse antibody was regenerated with 10 mM glycine\n(pH 1.7) (GE Healthcare).\n\nThe crystallization\ntrials were performed\nwith 1 \u03bcL of protein being mixed with 1 \u03bcL of the reservoir\nsolution and then equilibrating against 100 \u03bcL of the reservoir\nsolution at 4 \u00b0C by the vapor-diffusion sitting-drop method.\nThe initial crystallization was screened using the commercially available\nkits. Diffractive crystals of the HKU9-RBD protein were finally obtained\nunder 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate (pH 7.0) and 12% PEG\n20000 with a protein concentration of 2.2 mg/mL. Derivative crystals\nwere obtained by soaking the crystals in the reservoir solution containing\n1 mM KAuBr4\u00b72H2O for 48 h at 4 \u00b0C.\n\nFor data collection, all crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen\nafter a brief soaking in the reservoir solution with the addition\nof 20% (v/v) glycerol. The diffraction data for the native (wavelength\nof 1.03906 \u00c5) and Au derivative crystals (wavelength of 1.03906\n\u00c5) of HKU9-RBD were collected at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation\nFacility (SSRF) BL17U. All data were processed with HKL2000.49 The ice rings that form in the crystal flash\ncooling process were excluded from data processing, and the final\noverall completeness for the data set is 97.1%.\n\nThe structure\nof HKU9-RBD was determined by the SAD method. After location of Au\nsites by SHELXD50 with the Au-SAD data,\nthe identified positions were then refined and the phases were calculated\nwith the SAD experimental phasing module of PHASER.51 The real space constraints were further applied to the\nelectron density map in DM.52 The initial\nmodel was built with Autobuild in the PHENIX package.53 Additional missing residues were added manually in COOT.54 The final model was refined with phenix.refine\nin PHENIX53 with energy minimization, isotropic\nADP refinement, and bulk solvent modeling. The stereochemical qualities\nof the final model were assessed with MolProbity.55 The Ramachandran plot distributions for the residues in\nthe HKU9-RBD structure were 94.64, 5.36, and 0% for favored, allowed,\nand outlier regions, respectively. Data collection and refinement\nstatistics are summarized in Table 1. All structural figures were generated using PyMol\n(http://www.pymol.org).\n\nWe first\ncharacterized the sequence of BatCoV HKU9 S by using a series\nof bioinformatic methods. This 1274-residue protein exhibits typical\nfeatures of coronavirus S proteins (e.g., the presence of characteristic\nheptad repeats 1 and 2 in the S2 subunit), though the S1/S2 cleavage\nsite potentially processed by furin-like proteases was not detected\n(Figure 1A). Along\nthe full-length protein, the amino acid sequence identity between\nBatCoV HKU9 S and other betaCoVSs is rather limited (e.g., 27.9% identical\nto MERS-CoV S, 28.0% identical to HKU4 S, and 30.4% identical to SARS-CoV\nS). Nevertheless, we were able to identify the RBD region based on\nthe characteristic cysteine residues of the core subdomain (Figure 1B), which were shown,\nin the thus-far available RBD structures,35,38,39,56 to form three\nconserved disulfide bonds stabilizing the core fold. The subsequent\nHKU9-RBD was allocated to the S region spanning residues 355\u2013521\n(Figure 1A). In comparison\nto other RBD sequences, the HKU9-RBD exhibits a comparable length\nin the core subdomain (Figure 1B) but is dramatically shortened in the external region (Figure 1C).\n\nTo test if HKU9-RBD could react with either SARS-CoV receptor\nACE242 or MERS-CoV receptor CD26,34 the RBD and the receptor\u2013ectodomain proteins\nwere\nindividually prepared in insect cells and purified to homogeneity.\nThe ligand\u2013receptor interaction was then characterized via\nSPR BIAcore by passing ACE2 or CD26 over the immobilized RBD proteins.\nAs expected, potent interactions were observed for both the SARS-RBD\u2013ACE2\n(KD = 0.265 \u03bcM) (Figure 2A) and MERS-RBD\u2013CD26\n(KD = 52.8 nM) (Figure 2B) binding pairs. The revealed kinetics were\nvery similar to those reported previously,35,39 validating the integrity of our testing system. Under the same condition,\nhowever, neither ACE2 (Figure 2C) nor CD26 (Figure 2D) interacted with HKU9-RBD. To exclude the possibility that\nHKU9-RBD could be nonfunctional because of immobilization or because\nof the absence of some important post-translational modifications\non the protein, we purified the mFc-fused HKU9-RBD proteins in mammalian\n(293T) cells and assessed the abilities to bind CD26 or ACE2 proteins\nusing a captured SPR method. In the same way, there was no detectable\nbinding of mFc-fused HKU9-RBD to ACE2 or CD26 (Figure 2G), while the mFc-fused SARS-RBD protein\nbound to ACE2 (Figure 2E) and the mFc-fused MERS-RBD bound to CD26 (Figure 2F) well. BatCoV HKU9, therefore, could utilize\nneither the SARS-CoV receptor nor the MERS-CoV receptor for cell entry.\nRather, it must utilize a unique cellular receptor for entry.\n\nWe further set out to\ninvestigate the structural features of HKU9-RBD via crystallography.\nThe protein was successfully crystallized; a 2.1 \u00c5 data set was\ncollected (Table 1),\nand the structure was determined by using the single-wavelength anomalous\ndiffraction (SAD) method. The determined structure, with an Rwork of 0.1700 and an Rfree of 0.2006, contains a single molecule in the crystallographic\nasymmetric unit. Clear electron densities were traced for 176 consecutive\nHKU9-RBD residues, extending from S355 to A520. These amino acids fold\ninto a compact structure, which can be further divided into two subdomains\nas shown schematically in the other RBD structures.35,38,39 The core subdomain comprises eight \u03b2-strands\nand six helices (\u03b1 or 310). Five long strands (\u03b2c1\u2212\u03b2c5)\nare arranged in an antiparallel manner, forming the scaffold center\nof the core (core-center). This core-center sheet is further wrapped\nby the surface helices and loops. It is notable that the six helices\n(H1\u2013H6) are sporadically distributed on the two sheet faces,\nthereby leading to an overall globular fold for the core subdomain.\nOn one lateral side of the core-center sheet, the external subdomain\ncovers the core like a hat, while on the distal opposite side, three\nsmall strands (\u03b2p1\u2212\u03b2p3) constitute a parallel peripheral\nsheet (core-peripheral), ensuring that the N- and C-termini of HKU9-RBD\nare in the proximity. As expected, the characteristic cysteine residues\n(Figure 1B) form three\ndisulfide bonds in the core subdomain, further stabilizing the core\nstructure from the interior. Of these, two (C357\u2013C381 and C411\u2013C517)\nare located in core-peripheral, contributing to the orientation of\nthe RBD termini; one (C399/C452) resides in the core-center, linking\nstrands \u03b2c2 and \u03b2c4 (Figure 3). Overall, the residue\nboundaries of the core subdomain observed in the structure are quite\nconsistent with those deduced from the results of sequence alignment\n(Figure 1B).\n\nThe external subdomain of HKU9-RBD\nconsists of 42 residues from\nL458 to V499 (Figure 1C). These amino acids extend out of strand \u03b2c4 of the core-center\nsheet, first orient as a loop along the core subdomain like a clamp,\nthen fold back to form a solvent-exposed \u03b1-helix (H1\u2032),\nand finally proceed into core strand \u03b2c5 (Figure 3). This observed structure differs dramatically\nfrom those of SARS-RBD and MERS-RBD, which are shown to be devoid\nof any helical components in the external region.38,39 The unique external fold of HKU9-RBD could well explain its inability\nto bind either ACE2 or CD26.\n\nPreviously, three betaCoV RBD structures have\nbeen reported, including\none lineage B structure (SARS-RBD38) and\ntwo lineage C structures (MERS-RBD39 and\nHKU4-RBD35). These structures indicated\nan interspecies conservation in the core fold among betaCoVs.39 BatCoV HKU9 is a representative member of betaCoV\nlineage D.11 We therefore compared the\ncurrently available RBD structures with the HKU9-RBD structure determined\nin this study. As expected, a significant similarity was observed\nin the core subdomain (Figure 4A\u2013D). Superimposition of the core structures revealed\nthe root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) values ranging from 0.66 to\n2.82 \u00c5 (Table 2), demonstrating the quite similar core folds (though with a low\nlevel of sequence identity) among the four RBDs. The most conserved\npart was seen in the core-center sheet. This five-stranded scaffold\nelement as well as the single interstrand disulfide bond is invariably\nreserved in all the structures. In the core-peripheral region, however,\na small variance in strand composition is noted. In HKU9-RBD, it contains\nthree short \u03b2-strands, arranged in a small parallel \u03b2-sheet.\nBoth SARS-RBD and MERS-RBD retain two of these strands, whereas HKU4-RBD\nis devoid of any detectable strand elements in this region. Despite\nthe observed difference in strand formula, the core-peripherals of\nthe RBDs exhibit a similar orientation and present the same scheme\nin which the domain N-terminus is in the proximity of its C-terminus.\nExtra common features in core-peripheral strands lie in the two disulfide\nbonds in the region, which are structurally and topologically conserved\nin the four structures (Figure 4A\u2013D).\n\nIn contrast to the core conservation, the external\nsubdomains of\nthe four RBDs are divergent in structures. HKU9-RBD presents a single\nH1\u2032 helix in the external region, whereas SARS-RBD is loop-dominated\nbut contains two extra small \u03b2-strands. The external subdomains\nof MERS-RBD and HKU4-RBD, however, resemble each other and are predominantly\na rigid \u03b2-sheet composed of four \u03b2-strands. Despite the\nstructural irrelevance, the external subdomains are clearly topological\nequivalents in these structures, being present as an insertion between\ntwo core-center strands (Figure 4A\u2013D).\n\nBy superimposing the available RBD\nstructures, we unexpectedly identified two major elements in the external\nsubdomain that could be well-aligned (Figure 5A). The first element (element 1) spans approximately\nseven residues (Y464\u2013F470 in HKU9-RBD, Y438\u2013R444 in\nSARS-RBD, Y497\u2013C503 in MERS-RBD, and Y501\u2013C507 in HKU4-RBD)\n(Figures 1C and 5C) and proceeds along the core subdomain surface\nto be lodged between helices H2 and H6 (based on the secondary element\ndefinition of HKU9-RBD) (Figure 5A). The second element (element 2) contains eight amino\nacids (P471\u2013Q478 in HKU9-RBD, K447\u2013D454 in SARS-RBD,\nL517\u2013S524 in MERS-RBD, and Y522\u2013S529 in HKU4-RBD) (Figures 1C and 5C), extending as a curved loop covering helix H6 of the core\nsubdomain (Figure 5A). It is interesting that these two elements are \u201csaddled\u201d\nupon the core helices, anchoring the external subdomain to the core\nsubdomain (Figure 5A). We therefore further explored the amino acid interaction details\nat this core\u2013external interface.\n\nEach element residue was scrutinized for both the side-chain\norientation\nand the intersubdomain interactions. To facilitate the analyses and\ncomparison, the two elements were assigned a position marker for each\namino acid (a\u2013g for element 1 and a\u2013h for element 2)\n(Figure 5B,C). In element\n1, residue a is invariably a tyrosine in the four RBDs. This amino\nacid orients its bulky side chain toward the core subdomain, providing\nstrong hydrophobic contacts. An extra side-chain H-bond is also observed\nat this position in HKU9-RBD. Residue b extended away from the core\nsurface and exhibited little conservation. The residue, however, invariably\ncontributes to the subdomain anchoring by providing a main-chain H-bond.\nFollowing residue b, the amino acids are preferably facing toward\nthe core at position c and spreading parallel to the core surface\nat position d. Multiple van der Waals (vdw) contacts and conserved\nmain-chain H-bonds are observed at these two positions, respectively.\nA small discrepancy is seen in SARS-RBD, which orients its c residue\noutward for the bulky solvent region. The remaining three element\n1 amino acids at positions e\u2013g are distant from the core subdomain\nand completely solvent-exposed, therefore contributing little to the\ncore\u2013external interactions (Figure 5B,C).\n\nIn element 2, both residues a\nand d are oriented parallel to the\nsurface of the core subdomain. The configuration allows the amino\nacids to provide apolar vdw contacts to strengthen core\u2013external\nsubdomain binding. A certain extent of amino acid conservation was\nobserved at position d where a proline is favored to facilitate the\nturning of the loop. Following these two positions, residues b and\ne insert their side chains into two surface pockets of the core subdomain.\nAt position b, the residue is conservatively hydrophobic and has a\nmiddle-sized side chain (Val/Ile/Leu). It is accommodated in a shallow\napolar pocket, creating strong stacking forces bonding the core and\nexternal subdomains. In addition, the residue also contributes a main-chain\nH-bond to the subdomain binding. For residue e, its accommodating\npocket is deep and large, therefore allowing for amino acid variance\nat the position (Gly in HKU9- and HKU4-RBD, Phe in SARS-RBD, and Asn\nin MERS-RBD). In the four RBDs, this residue e invariably forms H-bonds\nwith the core subdomain residue via the main-chain atom but may also\nprovide side-chain H-bond interactions (e.g., in MERS-RBD) or multiple\nvdw contacts (e.g., in SARS-RBD). Extra core\u2013external interactions\nin this region were further observed at position g, where the residue\nis oriented parallel to or toward the core subdomain and thereby contributes\nto the binding via hydrophobic and side-chain H-bond interactions.\nIt is also of interest that these important interface residues of\nelement 2 are regularly interspersed by amino acids at positions c,\nf, and h, which are solvent-exposed and rarely interact with the core\nsubdomain (Figure 5B,C).\n\nIn summary, the four coronaviral RBD structures show\nhomologous\namino acid interaction patterns for intersubdomain binding. The binding\nrelies mainly on two elements in the external subdomain, which are\noriented similarly in these structures (Figure 5A). Despite the lower level of conservation\nin the element sequences, the side-chain orientation and the interaction\nmodes (hydrophobic, vdw, or H-bond contacts) at each position are,\nin most cases, similar or homologous (Figure 5C).\n\nBats\nhave been found to harbor the largest natural genetic pools\nfor new coronarivuses or coronaviral genes. The origin of a majority\nof the betaCoVs could be traced back to bats;57 e.g., a recent study isolated, in Chinese horseshoe bats, a live\nSARS-like coronavirus that can utilize the SARS-CoV receptor of ACE2\nfor cell entry,22 thereby providing the\nstrongest evidence of the bat origin of this pandemic human pathogen.\nIn addition, two studies reported the identification of gene fragments\nin bats that are almost identical to those of MERS-CoV,26,29 indicating that MERS-CoV likely also originates from bats. Noting\nthe recent reports showing the adaptation of batCoV HKU4 for binding\nto human cells by recognizing CD26,35 we\nbelieve that preparing for the unforeseeable events of potential interspecies\ntransmission by other bat-derived betaCoVs is an urgent need. BatCoV\nHKU9 is an important lineage D betaCoV11 and has been demonstrated to be widespread and circulating in different\nbat species.43\u221246 Noting the determinative role of the coronaviral S RBD in the process\nof crossing species barriers (as has been structurally illustrated\nin other coronaviruses35,38,39), we characterized the structural and functional features of the\nhomologous RBD protein of batCoV HKU9 S. The determined structure\nrevealed a core subdomain that resembles those observed in SARS-,\nMERS-, and HKU4-RBD but a unique external subdomain that is composed\nof a single helix. Because the RBD external subdomain contains the\nkey motifs [denoted the receptor binding motif (RBM)], interfacing\nwith the receptor,35,38,39 the unique external fold of HKU9-RBD therefore is in accord with\nour functional data showing its inability to react with either ACE2\nor CD26. Which host molecule could be recognized by HKU9-RBD as a\nfunctional cell entry receptor remains to be investigated. Nevertheless,\ntaking into account the single helical component in the external subdomain\nof HKU9-RBD, we expect the RBM to be located on the solvent-access\nside of the helix, which might facilitate future attempts to identify\nthe receptor.\n\nIt should be noted that coronavirus RBDs are not\nnecessarily located\nin the C-terminal half of the S1 subunit. Previous structural and\nmutagenesis data showed that the RBD of MHV S is located in the S1\nN-terminal half (NTD).41,58 Nevertheless, the current data\nseem to favor the notion that the CTD is prioritized over the NTD\nto function as the receptor binding entity, as the majority of the\ncoronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV,38 MERS-CoV,39 batCoV HKU4,35 human\ncoronavirus NL63,59 transmissible gastroenteritis\nvirus,60 etc.) harbor a CTD as the RBD.\nIt is interesting that the current available betaCoV CTD/RBD structures35,38,39 all keep the N- and C-termini\non the same side opposite from the location of the external subdomain.\nThis arrangement mode would lead the S1 N-terminal half to being sterically\nunderneath the C-terminal half, thereby projecting the CTD distant\nfrom the viral envelope for a trans-interaction with the receptors.\nOur structural study demonstrated that HKU9-RBD retains the same character\nand therefore stands a better chance of being the authentic receptor\nbinding entity.\n\nIn comparison to SARS-, MERS-, and HKU4-RBD\nwhose structures are\navailable,35,38,39 HKU9-RBD differs in the external fold but reserves a resembled core\nsubdomain structure. The most conserved part lies in the core-center\nsheet that is composed of five antiparallel strands and functions\nas the scaffold of the core subdomain. The sheet is sterically and\nstructurally conserved in all the RBD structures. Additional conserved\nelements include the core-center helices and core-peripheral structures.\nNevertheless, these elements could vary in their secondary element\ncompositions. For example, a recent study of the structure of HKU4-RBD35 showed that its N-terminal-most part does not\nfold into a characteristic helix as observed in the structures of\nSARS-RBD38 and MERS-RBD.39 For core-peripheral, the number of strands was found to\nvary from zero (as in HKU4-RBD) to three (as in HKU9-RBD) (Figure 4). This has added\ndramatic complexities to the nomenclature of the RBD secondary elements.\nThe situation would be even worse were the external subdomains that\ncould vary significantly in structure taken into account. We therefore\nsuggest that the core-center strands and helices be designated as\n\u03b2cs (\u03b2c1\u2212\u03b2c5) and Hs (H1, H2, etc.), respectively,\nand that the core-peripheral strands be designated as \u03b2ps (\u03b2p1,\n\u03b2p2, etc.) and the external elements as H\u2032s (H1\u2032,\nH2\u2032, etc.) or \u03b2\u2032s (\u03b21\u2032, \u03b22\u2032,\netc.). This terminological strategy should be able to facilitate the\ncomparison of homologous RBD structures and to reflect the fact that\nthe external subdomain is topologically an insertion between two equivalent\ncore-center strands.\n\nThe long evolutionary history, high mutation\nrates, and many genetic\nartifices of RNA viruses often lead to conundrums in the study of\nthe origin of viruses. It would be even more difficult to track the\nevolutionary traces in the viral surface proteins that are normally\nunder great evolutionary pressure. The evolutionary records, however,\nare more likely to be conserved in the tertiary structures than in\nthe amino acid sequences. In betaCoVs, the interlineage sequence identity\nin the S RBD is rather limited. Nevertheless, we observed several\nconserved features in the betaCoV RBD structures. These include (1)\na conserved core-center as the scaffold of the core subdomain, (2)\na similar core-peripheral where the RBD termini are clinched in the\nproximity, (3) a similar topological arrangement of the external subdomain\nas an insertion between two core strands, and (4) a homologous intersubdomain\nbinding mode anchoring the external subdomain to the core subdomain.\nThe features indicate a common ancestor S protein that divergently\nevolves into different species. During evolution, the core subdomain\nis structurally reserved, whereas the external subdomain folds into\nvariant structures to engage different receptors. It is also noteworthy\nthat the aforementioned core features have been structurally validated\nin betaCoV lineages B (SARS-RBD), C (MERS- and HKU4-RBD), and D (HKU9-RBD)\nbut not yet in lineage A. Structural studies of the equivalent S RBDs\nof the lineage A members should be conducted in the future."}
