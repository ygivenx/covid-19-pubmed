{"title": "Can routine laboratory tests discriminate 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia from other community-acquired pneumonia?", "body": "Chinese people are facing unprecedented panic induced by the outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) infected pneumonia (NCIP) in Wuhan, China since December 2019 [1] . Currently, during Spring Festival travel rush, millions of people leave Wuhan city, and the 2019-nCov would spread quickly especially along with people coming out from Wuhan. By 10 Feb 2020, a total of 3,7626 people have been confirmed NCIP in China [2] .\n\nThe NCIP is considered a relative of the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses. They are characterized by pneumonia symptoms, such as fever, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, respiratory symptoms and possibly transmitted from animal to human [3] [4] [5] . The public health authorities proposed NCIP definitions that combined clinical features (e.g., fever, cough, and anhelation) with epidemiological factors (e.g., travel to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market in Wuhan or direct contact with another patient with NCIP) to improve diagnostic accuracy [6, 7] . Unfortunately, these epidemiological features are not specific and have poor positive predictive value during the outbreak.\n\nThe NCIP appears to cause symptoms similar to other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) based on clinical data from 41 NCIP patients [3] , and can spread from humans to humans [3, 8] . Distinguishing NCIP from other etiologies of CAP is one of the major challenges of the NCIP outbreak. Despite recommendations that examining hematological and biochemical parameters as part of the diagnostic workup for NCIP [3, 9] , it is urgent to evaluate the ability of these features to accurately discriminate cases of NCIP from cases of CAP. Thus, we conducted the current study aiming to evaluate the ability of routine laboratory tests for distinguishing NCIP from All rights reserved.

Fasting whole blood from every patient was collected in an EDTA anticoagulant-treated tube and analyzed within 30 minutes of collection.\n\nRoutine peripheral blood cells, including hemoglobin, lymphocytes, and monocytes, were analyzed.

Statistical analysis for the results was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test for only two groups or using one-way analysis of variance when there were more than two groups. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability [10] . Higher AUC were considered to show better discriminatory ability as follows: excellent, AUC of \u22650.90; good, 0.80 \u2264 AUC<0.90; fair, 0.70 \u2264 AUC< 0.80. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nThe mean values of laboratory indexes at the time of hospital admission in NCIP patients and CAP patients were demonstrated in table 1 and figure 1.\n\nBoth NCIP patients and CAP patients had lower mean lymphocyte counts and platelet counts than healthy control. NCIP patients had significantly lower mean values for WBC, neutrophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet counts, and ALP than did patients with CAP. NCIP patients had significantly higher mean values for hemoglobin, hematocrit, ALB, ALT, and AST than did CAP patients.

Possibly, the Spring Festival travel rush that millions of people were on the way home and 2019-nCov would spread fast especially along with people coming out from Wuhan. Because the confirmation diagnosis of NCIP now mainly relies on PCR assays for the detection of 2019-nCov [13] , initial medical examination of potential NCIP depends primarily on clinical, radiographic, and epidemiological features [9] . Physicians and public health workers keep struggling with the difficult task of evaluating patients for NCIP presenting with unknown febrile respiratory illnesses. As a result, public health authorities went on revising NCIP definitions to improve the accuracy of diagnosis.\n\nOur findings demonstrated that nine laboratory features independently predictive of discernibility between NCIP and CAP. The identification of the RDW, HGB and RBC count as the best discriminatory ability, with an AUC of 0.89, 0.81 and 0.78, respectively. The discriminatory ability likely results from elevated RBC and HCB while low RDW seen in NCIP. Our study also highlighted laboratory parameters that are common in both NCIP and CAP and therefore not useful in differentiating the 2 diseases. Lymphocytopenia is characteristic and of similar magnitude for both NCIP and CAP. However, lymphocytopenia in NCIP was also accompanied by depletion of EO and normal BASO, whereas it was accompanied by reduced RBC, elevated neutrophil count and monocyte count in CAP.\n\nBecause the CAP cohort did not have laboratory indexes over time, trends in laboratory values were unable to perform after hospital admission.\n\nTherefore, more significant differences in the laboratory indexes might occur All rights reserved.

Our findings indicate that simple laboratory tests may help to distinguish NCIP from CAP. Application of these tests together with epidemiological data may be helpful to avoid misdiagnosis of NCIP as CAP, shorten the time of isolation of patients with respiratory symptoms.\n\nWe acknowledge all health-care workers involved in the diagnosis and treatment of patients in Wuhan.\n\nAll rights reserved.
