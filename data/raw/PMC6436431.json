{"title": "Hemozoin\u2010induced activation of human monocytes toward M2\u2010like phenotype is partially reversed by antimalarial drugs\u2014chloroquine and artemisinin", "body": "Malaria is one of the leading causes of morbidity affecting around 212 million individuals and 4, 29,000 deaths in endemic regions according to WHO 2015. Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria with complications that include cerebral malaria, pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, or severe anemia (Buffet et al., 2011; Das, 2008; Medana & Turner, 2006; Mohan, Sharma, & Bollineni, 2008). P. falciparum malaria is frequently associated with immunosuppression and increased secondary infections (Hu, 2013; Ihekwereme, Esimone, & Nwanegbo, 2014; Orf & Cunnington, 2015; Troye\u2010Blomberg & Perlmann, 1988). Immunosuppression enhances parasitemia and reduces immune responses to not only malaria parasite proteins but other pathogens as well. Accumulating evidence suggests that a combination of parasite and host factors is involved in the pathogenesis of severe malaria.\n\nDuring the intra\u2010erythrocytic stages, P. falciparum parasites digest hemoglobin in the food vacuole, resulting in the production of potentially toxic heme metabolites (Francis, Sullivan, & Goldberg, 1997), which the parasite detoxifies by converting it to an insoluble crystal called malarial pigment or hemozoin (Hz) (Arese & Schwarzer, 1997). During schizogeny, Hz is released into blood and avidly phagocytosed by human phagocytic cells including monocytes (MO) (Shio, Kassa, Bellemare, & Olivier, 2010). As a result of Hz uptake, several functions of MO such as repeated phagocytosis (Schwarzer et al., 1992), bactericidal abilities (Fiori et al., 1993), oxidative burst, MHC Class II expression, antigen presentation (Scorza, Magez, Brys, & De Baetselier, 1999), and maturation to dendritic cells (Urban & Todryk, 2006) are severely affected. MO actively respond to ingested natural Hz by secretion of pro\u2010 and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20101RA, IL\u201010, IL\u20108, and chemokines, CCL2, CCL3 CCL4, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3 and CXCL5 (Deshpande & Shastry, 2004; Giribaldi et al., 2010). Hz stimulates IL\u20101\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and CCL3 production via NF\u2010\u03baB and p38 MAPK kinase in human MO (Polimeni et al., 2012). Purified Hz isolated from parasitized RBCs stimulates TLR9 signaling and induces production of cytokines\u2014TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20106, IL\u201012p40, CCL2 in MYD88\u2010dependent manner in murine spleen and dendritic cells (Coban et al., 2005). In murine MQ cell line B10R, NF\u2010\u03baB has been shown to be involved in chemokine production of CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and CXCL2 induced by Hz (Jaramillo, Godbout, & Olivier, 2005). Hz\u2010induced activation of NOD\u2010like receptor containing pyrin domain 3 inflammasome and IL\u20101\u03b2 production is mediated through Src kinase Lyn and the tyrosine kinase Syk pathways in mice (Olivier, Van Den Ham, Shio, Kassa, & Fougeray, 2014; Shio et al., 2009).\n\nMO are heterogeneous innate immune cells that play a pivotal role in primary response to pathogens, tissue homeostasis, inflammation, resolution, and repair (Shi & Pamer, 2011). MO are highly plastic and polarize toward M1 phenotype in the presence of inflammatory environment such as LPS and IFN\u03b3, while the anti\u2010inflammatory M2 phenotype is driven by TH2 cytokines IL\u20104, IL\u201013, IL\u201010, and TGF\u2010\u03b2. IL\u201012\u2010producing M1 phenotype is associated with antiparasitic and tumor\u2010resistance capabilities, and IL\u201010\u2010producing M2 phenotype is related to wound healing, immune regulation, and resolution of inflammation (Mantovani et al., 2004; Martinez & Gordon, 2014; Sica & Mantovani, 2012). M1 and M2 MO have an indirect role in the activation of Th1 and Th2 responses, respectively (Mantovani et al., 2004). A study by Murray et al. (2014) described different types of MQ phenotypes generated by different activating agents and referred to them as M(IL\u20104), M(Ig), M(IL\u201010), M(GC), M(IFN\u03b3), and M(LPS); however, a phenotype may not fall into specific categories but may show a spectra related to particular phenotype. The M2 phenotype displays high expression of mannose\u2010binding receptor CD206, high arginase activity, and low nitric oxide (NO) production (Gordon, 2003; Kobayashi et al., 2010; Mosser, 2003; Tsuchimoto et al., 2015). The M2 type MO are divided into M2a, M2b, and M2c subtypes that produce specific chemokines CCL17, CCL1, and CXCL13, respectively (Edwards, Zhang, Frauwirth, & Mosser, 2006; Mantovani et al., 2004; Sironi et al., 2006).\n\nMultiple signaling pathways including JAK/STAT, PKC/ERK, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR are involved in the maintenance of M2 phenotype. The pathways may act individually or in combination to drive MO toward M2 polarization (Gordon & Martinez, 2010; Martinez & Gordon, 2014).The p38 MAPK and PI3K\u2010AKT pathway mediated IL\u20104\u2010induced M2a polarization in mice model (Jimenez\u2010Garcia, Herranz, Luque, & Hortelano, 2015). Notch1 signaling via NF\u2010\u03baB, p38 MAPK, and AKT pathways has been demonstrated in M2b polarization of murine lupus mouse model (Zhang, Xu, & Xiong, 2010). Recent studies have enhanced our understanding and importance of phenotypic changes in MO by modulating immune responses in several infectious diseases (Buchacher, Ohradanova\u2010Repic, Stockinger, Fischer, & Weber, 2015; Kobayashi et al., 2010; Nakamura, Ito, Kobayashi, Herndon, & Suzuki, 2015; Tsuchimoto et al., 2015) and highlighted their potential for development of new therapeutics. Phenotypic changes in MO have been reported in parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis, filariasis, and trypanosomiasis (Babu et al., 2009; Cabal\u00e9n et al., 2016).\n\nWhile accumulating experimental and clinical data support the significant contribution of Hz in immunosuppression, its role in driving the MO toward specific MO phenotypes and the implications therein remains to be unraveled. In the present study, we aimed to (a) investigate the effect of Hz in the activation of human MO toward M2 phenotype, (b) examine the signaling pathways involved in the process, and (c) explore the potential of antimalarial drugs\u2014chloroquine (CHQ) and artemisinin (ART)\u2014in reversion of Hz\u2010driven activation of MO.\n\nSterile tissue culture plastics were purchased from corning. RPMI 1640 media was purchased from Sigma. The parasite and MO cultures were ensured to be mycoplasma free and endotoxin low (<0.125). Inhibitors SB203580 (SB), parthenolide (PAR), LY294002 (LY), and drugs CHQ diphosphate and ART were purchased from Sigma.\n\nNatural Hz from P. falciparum was isolated as described previously with slight modifications (Barrera et al., 2011; Bujila et al., 2016; Schwarzer et al., 1992; Skorokhod, Alessio, Mordmuller, Arese, & Schwarzer, 2004). Briefly, P. falciparum (3D7 strain; MR4/ATCC, mycoplasma free) culture was maintained in candle jars at 37\u00b0C (Trager & Jensen, 1976). Parasites were cultured in O\u2010positive RBCs at 5% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 4.5 g/L glucose and 2.1 g/L NaHCO3, 0.5% AlbuMAX II (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and gentamicin (50 mg/ml). The medium was replenished every 24 h. Parasite cultures with >25% rings were synchronized by 5% aqueous sorbitol and cultured for 50 h until the rupture of mature schizonts and release of Hz. Culture supernatants containing Hz were carefully aspirated and collected and centrifuged, and the blackish\u2010brown Hz\u2010containing pellet was washed three times with sterile ice cold PBS (pH 7.2). Pigment isolated from different batches of parasite cultures was pooled, aliquoted, and stored in PBS at \u221220\u00b0C. The total heme content in isolated Hz was determined as previously described (Polimeni et al., 2012). Hz isolated from the supernatants of synchronized parasite cultures after schizont rupture is mostly devoid of parasite material. P. falciparum DNA was not detected in natural Hz (at concentration used in our experiments) on agarose gel (Supporting Information Figure S1).\n\nThe study for use of human blood MO was approved by the ethics committee of National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India. Buffy coats were obtained from healthy donors recruited for blood collection at government\u2010recognized blood bank, Pune. Informed consent from donors was not essential as discarded buffy coats obtained after plasmapheresis were used. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from buffy coats by Histopaque 1077. CD14+ MO were enriched from PBMCs by positive selection using magnetic beads (MACS) (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purity of MO obtained was 85%\u201390% CD14+ and viability >95% (Supporting Information Figure S2). Adherent MO for phagocytosis was obtained as previously described with some modifications (Polimeni et al., 2012). Briefly, 2 \u00d7 106 MO/2 ml was seeded per well in six\u2010well tissue culture plates and incubated for 1 h at 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM glutamine, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml Penicillin G, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma St Louis, MO). Cells were washed with RPMI 1640 medium, and the adherent MO obtained was incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. The adherence step applied after MACS and before phagocytosis further enriched the MO population to contain >95% MO. Culture medium was replaced with fresh medium before the start of experiments.\n\nPhagocytosis of Hz and latex particles was carried out as previously described (Polimeni et al., 2012). Parasite Hz (50 \u03bcg/ml) and latex beads (0.114 \u03bcm diameter; 10 \u03bcl of a 100\u2010fold dilution of the 2.5% V/V) were exposed to 106 MO. The dose of pigment used was based on Hz amounts detected during P. falciparum infection and previous in vitro and in vivo studies (Deshpande & Shastry, 2004; Jaramillo et al., 2005). The latex beads were used as phagocytic control (Giribaldi et al., 2010). The plates were incubated in 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C for 2 h to allow phagocytosis. Un\u2010phagocytized Hz and beads were removed by media washes, and the cells were incubated for indicated time intervals. In cell signaling experiments, the MO were pretreated with different pharmacological pathway inhibitors, SB203580 (10 \u03bcM), parthenolide (10 \u03bcM), and LY294002 (10 \u03bcM) 1 h prior to phagocytosis. Antimalarial drugs\u2014ART (20 \u03bcM) and CHQ (20 \u03bcM)\u2014were added 2 h after exposing the MO to Hz pigment.\n\nThe MO fed with Hz and latex beads were collected after 24 h by gentle scraping in 5 mM EDTA, washed with 1\u00d7 PBS (without Ca\u2212/Mg\u2212), supplemented with 2% FBS on ice. The cells were passed through cell strainer (40 \u03bcM) and incubated with human TruStain FcX blocking reagent (Biolegend) to inhibit nonspecific binding of antibodies. The cells were stained with PE anti\u2010human CD14 (M5E2) and FITC anti\u2010human HLA\u2010DR (Clone G46\u20106), APC anti\u2010human CD206 (19.2) (Biolegend), and respective isotypes (Biolegend) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Cells were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS (without Ca\u2212/Mg\u2212) supplemented with 2% FBS, and data were acquired on BD FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FACS DIVA software and FlowJo software (BD Biosciences). All parameters measured were based on SSC versus MO\u2010specific CD14+ gated cells.\n\nThe MO fed with Hz/latex were collected after 12 h and stored in Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted using the Purelink RNA kit (Ambion, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol of Trizol plus Purelink columns. The purified total RNA was resuspended in RNase\u2010free water and quality was analyzed using Nanodrop (ND\u20101000 spectrophotometer). 600 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed with ImProm\u2010II\u2122 Reverse Transcription System (Promega) as per manufacturer's instructions.\n\nqPCR analysis of mRNA expression of M1 and M2 phenotype\u2010specific marker genes in Hz and latex fed MO was performed using Power syber green (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and gene\u2010specific primers. The primers related to M1/M2 phenotype for real\u2010time PCR analysis were designed using NCBI primer 3 Software and were custom synthesized from Sigma and IDT technologies. Oligo sequences are listed in Supporting Information Table S1. The cycling parameters were as follows: Initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min to activate the AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase followed by 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 60 s, and then 72\u00b0C for 30 s for a total of 40 cycles. The comparative threshold cycle (C\nt) value for GAPDH was used to normalize loading variations in the real\u2010time PCR. The extent of mRNA expression for a given condition was represented by the relative value to the lower DDCT between those estimated for the different conditions: the control DDCT value was fixed at 1.0. The specificity of PCR was confirmed by melting curve analysis. Real\u2010time PCR was done on thermocycler Applied Biosystems 7300 (Applied Biosystems).\n\nCytokines TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, IL\u201010, and IL\u201012p70 and chemokines, CCL1, CCL17, and CXCL13 levels were quantified in the cell free\u2010culture supernatants using ELISA kits according to manufacturer's instructions. Human ELISA kits for CCL1 and CXCL13 were purchased from R&D Biosystems; CCL17, IL\u201012, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and IL\u20106 were purchased from Biolegend; and IL\u201010 and IL\u20101\u03b2 were purchased from BD Biosciences.\n\nThe MO fed with Hz were washed with PBS and lysed with equal volumes of RIPA buffer containing 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail on ice and then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C. Lysates with equal amounts of protein were separated by 10% SDS\u2010PAGE and then transferred onto PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), blocked with 5% Milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies. Phospho\u2010AKT, phospho\u2010P38, phospho\u2010p65 (NF\u2010\u03baB), total p65 (NF\u2010\u03baB) were purchased from Abcam; total P38 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; AKT from Cell signaling technology, I\u03baB\u03b1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and GAPDH from Sigma. The membranes were exposed to HRP\u2010labeled anti\u2010rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:5,000) (BioRad) for 1 h at RT and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence detection system and visualized using GE image quant 4000 chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare Lifesciences).\n\nAdherent MO were prepared and exposed to Hz and latex as described above, and autologous lymphocytes previously collected were added in the ratio of 1:4\u20131:8. The cells were incubated for 72 h in a total volume of 200 \u03bcl of complete media (RPMI + 10%FCS) with 5 \u03bcg/ml of PHA\u2010L (Sigma) mitogen. Cells were pulsed with 1 \u03bcCi/well [methyl\u20103H] Thymidine (Amersham) for 18 h before harvesting. The CPM counts were recorded in liquid beta\u2010scintillation counter (Packard). (3H) Thymidine incorporation was measured as CPM and compared with untreated cells.\n\nArginase activity was determined by colorimetric assay (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, MO fed with Hz and latex were lysed with 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.4 containing 1 \u03bcM pepstatin A, 1 \u03bcM leupeptin, and 0.4% (w/v) Triton X\u2010100. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min to remove insoluble material. The samples were incubated with substrate buffer containing arginine buffer and manganese (Mn) solution for reaction to occur for 2 h at 37\u00b0C along with appropriate sample blank and urea standard in separate wells. The reaction was terminated by adding urea reagent and incubation for 1 h. The absorbance was recorded at 430 nm and arginase activity was calculated as units/L.\n\nThe NO production in the culture supernatants of Hz and latex fed MO was measured as stable end product of NO, that is, nitrite using the Griess reagent. Briefly, 100 \u03bcl of cell culture supernatant was added to 96\u2010well plate in triplicates, followed by 50 \u03bcl sulphanilamide and 50 \u03bcl N\u20101\u2010napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride. The plate was incubated in dark for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. Absorbance at 540 nm was measured by microplate reader, and nitrite concentration was estimated using a sodium nitrite standard curve. RPMI1640 media without phenol red dye was used for this assay.\n\nReactive oxygen species (ROS; including superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and other reactive oxygen intermediates [ROI]) was estimated by H2O2\u2010sensitive probe H2DCFDA (Thermofisher scientific) by flow cytometry. Briefly, Hz and latex fed MO were incubated with H2DCFDA (10 \u03bcg/mL) and PE\u2010anti\u2010human CD14 at RT for 20 min in the dark. PE\u2010labeled anti\u2010human CD14 was used to gate MO. Fluorescent DCF in the MO emitting green fluorescence and proportional to intracellular ROS was acquired on BD FACS Canto II, and data were analyzed using FACS DIVA software.\n\nAll values (expressed as M \u00b1 SEM) were obtained from three or more independent experiments. Comparison between groups was done with the one\u2010way ANOVA (Bonferroni correction). Statistical comparisons were made as indicated, significance levels: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. GraphPad Prism6 software was used for statistical analysis.\n\nThe effect of Hz on activation of MO toward the M2 phenotype was examined in CD14+ sorted cells and analyzed for a panel of M1\u2010 and M2\u2010associated markers. IL\u201010, a well\u2010characterized anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine implicated in M2 polarization, was elevated at transcript level following Hz exposure (Figure 1a). Consistent with our previous work (Deshpande & Shastry, 2004), a strong induction of secreted and cellular IL\u201010 was observed (Figure 1b and Supporting Information Figure S3a). The transcript and secreted level of IL\u201012p70 was assessed in Hz\u2010fed MO, and treatment with LPS + IFN\u03b3 was used as positive control. Interestingly, Hz phagocytosis did not alter the IL\u201012p70 level. As expected, the production of IL\u201012 was increased in MO exposed to LPS + IFN\u03b3 (Supporting Information Figure S3b,c). M1 phenotype is also induced by microbial products through TLR ligands (Murray & Wynn, 2011; Murray et al., 2014; Wang, Liang, & Zen, 2014). Therefore, additional experiments were conducted to examine TLR engagement in Hz\u2010driven MO activation. MO exposed to natural Hz were analyzed by flow cytometry and western blotting for expression of TLR9. \u03b2\u2010Hematin (sHz) was used as a reference for flow cytometry analysis (Coban et al., 2005). As shown in Supporting Information Figure S4a,b, natural Hz had no effect on TLR9 expression, suggesting that it might not be involved in Hz\u2010mediated MO activation. In this study, MO fed with Hz displayed strong upregulation of mannose\u2010binding lectin receptor (CD206), a M2\u2010associated surface marker with increase in percent positive cells and MFI in comparison with controls (Figure 1c). HLA\u2010DR, a M1 phenotype\u2010related marker, was significantly down\u2010regulated as observed by decrease of MFI in response to Hz exposure (Figure 1c). Recent reports employing differential gene expression and chemokine profiles have ascribed three subtypes in the M2 phenotype. To identify the M2 subtypes generated following Hz phagocytosis, we assessed the expression of subset\u2010specific chemokines\u2014CCL17 (M2a), CCL1 (M2b), and CXCL13 (M2c). Hz\u2010fed MO robustly elevated transcript level of CCL17 and CCL1 (Figure 1d). Also, a significant increase in secreted chemokines was observed for CCL17 and CCL1 in supernatants of Hz\u2010fed MO (Figure 1e). In addition, Hz phagocytosis elevated transcript level and secretion of M2b\u2010associated cytokines\u2014TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101 \u03b2, and IL\u20106 (Supporting Information Figure S5a,b). The amount of Hz in the range of 25\u201375\u03bcg/ml significantly elevated the secreted levels of IL\u201010, CCL17, CCL1, and surface expression of CD206 in MO (Supporting Information Figure S5c). Interestingly, CXCL13 and CD163 (markers related to M2c phenotype) were unaltered under similar experimental conditions (Supporting Information Figure S6).\n\nMO polarization endows subtypes with specific biochemical and functional properties. M1 MO are characterized by elevated production of NO and ROI that are essential for clearance of pathogens. Conversely, M2 MO lack the ability to generate oxidative intermediates, synthesis of ornithine and polyamines through the arginase pathway. We found that Hz\u2010fed MO robustly elevated arginase activity (Figure 1f) and significantly reduced the NO (Figure 1g) and ROS levels (Figure 1h) compared with untreated and latex\u2010ingested MO controls. Furthermore, Hz\u2010fed MO displayed a significant suppression of PHA\u2010stimulated lymphocyte proliferation when compared with control and latex\u2010ingested MO (Figure 1i), indicating an immunosuppressive response. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the malarial pigment\u2013Hz induced M2\u2010like phenotype and more specifically toward M2a\u2010 and M2b\u2010like subtypes in human MO.\n\nThe role of p38 MAPK, PI3K\u2010AKT, and NF\u2010\u03baB pathways has been implicated in IL\u201010 synthesis and M2 polarization; however, their relevance in Hz\u2010induced M2\u2010like phenotype is not reported. In this study, exposure to Hz led to a significant surge in the phosphorylation status of p38 MAPK (pP38\u2010Y182), PI3K\u2010AKT (pAKT\u2010S473), and NF\u2010\u03baB (p P65\u2010S276) in MO, indicating the activation of these pathways. Moreover, the decrease in I\u03baB\u03b1 further confirmed the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB (Figure 2a and Supporting Information Figure S7). Furthermore, pharmacological inhibitors of these pathways, SB203580 (p38 MAPK), parthenolide (NF\u2010\u03baB p65), and LY294002 (PI3K\u2010AKT) dramatically down\u2010regulated the expression and secretion of IL\u201010 (Figure 2b,c), implicating the involvement of these pathways in Hz\u2010induced IL\u201010 production in MO. Furthermore, we observed significant attenuation of M2\u2010associated CCL17 and CCL1 at the transcript and secreted levels in Hz\u2010fed MO pretreated with SB203580 (SB), parthenolide (PAR), and LY294002(LY) (Figure 2d,e). Moreover, decrease in surface expression of CD206 with reduction in percent positive cells and MFI corroborates the results of chemokine profiles confirming attenuation of M2\u2010like phenotype by the inhibitors (Figure 2f). The levels of TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, and IL\u20106 were markedly reduced with Hz in the presence of SB203580 and parthenolide. In contrast, IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20106 cytokines were further elevated in presence of LY294002 (Supporting Information Figure S8a,b). LY294002 can act on other pathways along with PI3K kinases that may be responsible for the regulation of IL\u20106 and IL\u20101\u03b2 (Gharbi et al., 2007). To confirm the role of PI3K\u2010AKT pathway, we used another inhibitor\u2014wortmannin in similar experiments. Wortmannin effectively reduced the level of IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, and IL\u201010 in supernatants of MO fed with Hz, signifying the role of PI3K\u2010AKT pathway in inhibiting M2\u2010like phenotype (Supporting Information Figure S8c).\n\nEstablishing the role of p38 MAPK, PI3K\u2010AKT, and NF\u2010\u03baB pathways in Hz\u2010driven MO activation toward M2\u2010like phenotype encouraged us to evaluate M2\u2010specific biochemical and functional properties in the presence of specific inhibitors. The enhanced effect of Hz on arginase activity was abrogated with inhibitors to p38 MAPK\u2010AKT, PI3K, and NF\u2010\u03baB pathways (Figure 2g). Moreover, blocking of these pathways prevented the Hz\u2010induced inhibition of NO (Figure 2h) and ROS (Figure 2i) production. Surprisingly, LY294002 did not affect the ROS levels reduced by Hz (Figure 2i). It is noteworthy that proliferation of PHA\u2010stimulated lymphocytes cultured with Hz\u2010fed MO was restored in the presence of SB203580, parthenolide, and LY294002 (Figure 2j). These results strongly implicate the role of p38 MAPK, PI3K\u2010AKT, and NF\u2010\u03baB pathways in Hz\u2010induced skewing of MO toward M2\u2010like phenotype and suppression of mitogen\u2010stimulated proliferation of lymphocytes.\n\nAntiparasitic activity of ART and CHQ coupled with the reported immunomodulatory roles suggests their possible effect on the activation of MO toward M2\u2010like phenotype during malaria pathogenesis. The concentrations of drugs used in the current experiments were based on previous studies on MO (Jang, Choi, Byun, & Jue, 2006; Wang et al., 2011). ART in concentrations ranging from 5 to 400 \u03bcM did not affect the viability of MO as assessed for cytotoxicity by MTT assay (Supporting Information Figure S9a). In our study, we found that treatment of MO preexposed to Hz with ART resulted in dramatic reduction of IL\u201010 levels (Figure 3a) and expression of the surface marker CD206 in terms of percent positive cells and MFI (Figure 3b). ART also exhibited the ability to significantly diminish secretion of other M2 cytokines\u2014CCL17, CCL1, IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and IL\u20101\u03b2 (Figure S9b)\u2014but did not significantly alter arginase activity, NO, and ROS production (Figure 3c\u2013e). Importantly, ART partially reversed Hz\u2010induced immunosuppression as demonstrated by partial restoration of mitogen\u2010stimulated lymphocyte proliferation (Figure 3f). ART in the dose range of 5\u201320 \u03bcM decreased secretion of phenotypic markers IL\u201010, CCL17, CCL1, and CD206 surface expression in Hz\u2010fed MO (Supporting Information Figure S9c). The Hz\u2010induced NF\u2010\u03baB activation was inhibited by ART as indicated by decreased p65 phosphorylation and increased I\u03baB\u03b1 in MO (Supporting Information Figure S9d). These results suggest the contribution of NF\u2010\u03baB in inhibition of M2 phenotypic markers by ART. CHQ showed similar effect on the Hz\u2010driven M2\u2010like phenotype in MO, inhibited NF\u2010\u03baB p65 phosphorylation, and increased I\u03baB\u03b1 levels (Figure 4a\u2013f and Supporting Information Figure S10). Taken together, these results suggest that ART and CHQ treatment partially reverse Hz\u2010induced M2\u2010like MO activation.\n\n\nP. falciparum infection manifests itself as varying degrees of severity in malaria, inclusive of uncomplicated, mild, severe, and cerebral malaria. Variable susceptibility to the parasite is governed by a constant conflict between immunoprotection and immunopathology. The immune system acts like a double\u2010edged sword, wherein interplay among anti\u2010 and pro\u2010inflammatory responses dictates disease outcome. Hence, studies on interactions between host and parasite components are important to provide a better understanding of factors affecting directionality of immune response. MO, an important constituent of mononuclear phagocytic system, plays an important role during parasite infection. Parasite components, including Hz, released during the erythrocytic cycle are readily taken up by patrolling MO. The ingested Hz is accumulated and affects the accessory functions of MO and other immune cells, which in\u2010turn may contribute to immunosuppression seen in malaria. We show here that Hz drives MO toward M2\u2010like phenotype and is mediated by PI3K\u2010AKT, NF\u2010\u03baB, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Antimalarial drugs\u2014CHQ and ART\u2014partially reversed Hz\u2010induced M2\u2010like phenotype, thereby supporting their immunomodulatory role.\n\nBlood mononuclear phagocytes display plasticity and have the ability to polarize toward M1 or M2 phenotypes in response to environmental stimuli. Findings from our study demonstrate that Hz drives human MO toward M2\u2010like phenotype, as characterized by the expression of phenotypic markers including elevated IL\u201010, mannose receptor expression CD206, and arginase activity. Hz\u2010induced M2\u2010like MO comprise of M2a and M2b subtypes based on the expression of CCL17 and CCL1. Since chemokines, CCL17 and CCL1, function as agonists for CCR4 and CCR8 receptors, respectively (Mantovani et al., 2004), it is likely that Hz might facilitate recruitment of CCR4 and CCR8\u2010bearing TH2 cells and regulatory T cells of TH2 immunity which contribute to immunosuppression. It is noteworthy in this context that regulatory T cells suppress T\u2010cell responses in malaria (Hisaeda et al., 2004). Furthermore, Hz induces production of M2b\u2010specific cytokines\u2014TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, and IL\u20106 in human MO. These data corroborate with reports demonstrating the presence of inflammatory cytokines IL\u20101\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and IL\u20106 along with high level of anti\u2010inflammatory IL\u201010 in plasma of malaria patients (Perera et al., 2013; Weinberg et al., 2016).\n\nFunctionally, M1\u2010type MO are characterized by elevated production of NO and ROI that are essential for clearance of pathogens (Mantovani et al., 2004). Conversely, M2\u2010type MO express high arginase activity which is due to production of arginase\u20101, the enzyme that converts arginine to ornithine and urea causing depletion of arginine and reduction of NO (Biswas & Mantovani, 2012; Galv\u00e1n\u2010Pe\u00f1a & O'Neill, 2014; Martinez & Gordon, 2014). In malaria, depletion of NO results in low NO bioavailability that affects adherence of parasites to endothelium and is associated with severity of the disease. High arginase activity and an inverse relation between disease severity and NO production are recently reported in malaria (Weinberg et al., 2016). In this context, MO fed with Hz demonstrate elevated arginase activity compared with untreated and latex\u2010ingested MO. These data along with the findings from studies that plasmodium parasites (Olszewski et al., 2009) and lysed infected erythrocytes (Reiter et al., 2002) release arginase suggest that cumulative elevation of arginase activity from these sources might contribute to M2\u2010like activity. Recent studies have reported Hz\u2010induced production of ROS (Jaramillo et al., 2005) and NO (Jaramillo, Gowda, Radzioch, & Olivier, 2003) in MO. In contrast to these reports, we found that Hz significantly reduced production of NO and ROS levels compared with untreated and latex\u2010ingested MO. The difference in the results may be attributed to the nature of Hz used; while the earlier studies were performed with delipidized Hz and \u03b2\u2010hematin, our experiments were conducted with natural Hz. In addition, mitogen\u2010stimulated lymphocyte proliferation was significantly suppressed in the presence of Hz\u2010fed MO compared with control and latex\u2010ingested MO. This observation is in agreement with the study that malaria patients have suppressed T\u2010 and B\u2010cell functions (Zander & Butler, 2013).\n\nThe signaling pathways p38 MAPK, PI3K\u2010AKT, and NF\u2010\u03baB have been implicated in IL\u201010 synthesis (Saraiva & O'Garra, 2010) and M2 polarization (Zhang et al., 2010)\u2010(Liu et al., 2017). In this study, Hz activated p38 MAPK, PI3K\u2010AKT, and NF\u2010\u03baB pathways and pharmacological inhibitors for these pathways dramatically down\u2010regulated the expression and secretion of IL\u201010, thus, over\u2010riding the induction triggered by Hz exposure. In line with this observation, the inhibitors effectively reduced Hz\u2010induced M2\u2010like phenotypic, biochemical, and functional properties. While these findings implicate the role of p38 MAPK, PI3K\u2010AKT, and NF\u2010\u03baB pathways, we cannot rule out the possibility of other signaling pathways in Hz\u2010driven activation of MO toward M2 phenotype. Since Hz does not induce a specific phenotype subset but drives the MO toward M2a and M2b types, it may be postulated that Hz stimulates atypical activation mediated through PI3K\u2010AKT, p38 MAPK, and NF\u2010\u03baB pathways.\n\nWe next aimed to identify strategies that could aid in reversing the effect of Hz in driving the MO to an M2\u2010like phenotype. In this regard, we conducted experiments with CHQ and ART for three reasons; first, they are reported to inhibit pathways crucial for polarization to M2 type; second, they are widely used for treatment of malaria; and third, they possess immunomodulatory properties. ART have been reported to decrease IL\u201010, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels (Shakir, Hussain, Javeed, Ashraf, & Riaz, 2011; Wu et al., 2016) through MAPK (Wang et al., 2009), NF\u2010\u03baB (Prato, Gallo, Giribaldi, Aldieri, & Arese, 2010; Wang et al., 2011), and PI3K\u2010AKT (Kim et al., 2013) pathways. CHQ has also been demonstrated to act through MAPK (Kono et al., 2008; Weber, Chen, & Levitz, 2002) and NF\u2010\u03baB(Long, Liu, Wang, Zhou, & Zheng, 2015; Yang et al., 2013) pathways and decrease IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 in mononuclear phagocytes in different diseases (Jang et al., 2006; Long et al., 2015). In another study, CHQ has been shown to be an effective anticancer drug in mice by inhibiting tumor resistant MQ (M2 MQ) and decreasing TGF\u2010\u03b2 and IL\u201010 production. The effect was accompanied by decreased myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells (MDSC), Tregs, and increasing CD8+ T cells in tumor milieu (Zhang et al., 2017). The ability of these drugs to inhibit crucial pathways and production of cytokines/chemokines that are signature for M2 type MO has extended their use for other parasitic diseases, rheumatic diseases, and cancer. In our study, the drugs were found to be more effective in reducing the expression of phenotypic markers\u2014cytokines, chemokines, and surface marker\u2014CD206 associated with M2\u2010like phenotype than reversing altered biochemical and functional properties. ART did not reverse arginase activity in Hz\u2010fed MO. Our finding is supported by an earlier report that ART did not significantly alter arginase activity in leishmania donovani\u2010infected MQ though it enhanced protective immune responses by reversing NO levels (Sen, Ganguly, Saha, & Chatterjee, 2010). These observations are not surprising as CHQ and ART are known for their antimalarial action through multiple modes on their target, but their mechanism of action as immunomodulators is not clearly elucidated. The M2 phenotype is previously related to abnormal autophagy and angiogenesis (Li et al., 2016). We speculate that CHQ, a known autophagy inhibitor, may attenuate Hz\u2010induced M2\u2010like MO activation by inhibiting autophagy. Previously, falciparum malaria pathogenesis has been related to upregulated angiogenic factors VEGF, Ang\u20102, and sFLT\u20101 along with dysregulated and excessive immune responses (Muehlenbachs, Mutabingwa, Edmonds, Fried, & Duffy, 2006; Silver, Higgins, McDonald, & Kain, 2010). The antiparasitic action of ART is accompanied with disruption of parasite proteins, alteration of mitochondrial functions, and angiogenesis (Ak, 2015; Shakir et al., 2011). In relation to ability of M2 phenotype to stimulate angiogenesis, ART may attenuate Hz\u2010induced M2\u2010like phenotype by altering the release of angiogenic factors.\n\nThe schematic diagram (Figure 5) summarizes the Hz\u2010induced alterations in M1\u2010 and M2\u2010associated markers, the pathways involved and partial reversal by CHQ and ART in human MO. Hz released after schizont rupture is readily ingested by circulating MO in blood; activates PI3K\u2010AKT, NF\u2010\u03baB, and p38 MAPK pathways resulting in increased expression of M2 markers; and drives the MO toward M2 (M2a and M2b)\u2010like phenotype. Antimalarial drugs\u2014ART and CHQ\u2014partially reverse the process of activation of MO toward M2\u2010like phenotype. In conclusion, the findings from this study add a new dimension to the understanding of mechanism/s underlying Hz\u2010induced immunosuppression by demonstrating its ability to drive the MO toward M2\u2010like phenotype. Though antimalarial resistance poses a major challenge and discourages the continuation of CHQ and ART, we propose that these drugs may be re\u2010examined for their potential as immunomodulators and candidates for adjunctive treatment in malaria.\n\nD.B. performed research experiments, analyzed data, and wrote the paper; A.K. and M.D. performed experiments; P.D. conceived, designed, supervised, performed research experiments, analyzed, and wrote the paper; P.S., conceived, designed, analyzed, and wrote the paper.\n\nResearch was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
