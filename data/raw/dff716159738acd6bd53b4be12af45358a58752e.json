{"title": "MYCOPLASMA FAUCIUM AND BREAST CANCER", "body": "Viruses and bacteria are the cause of a large number of different human diseases. It is believed that some of them may even contribute to the development of cancer. We assume that the bacterial and viral infections may be one of the causes of breast cancer. This assumption is evidenced by published data showing that in the tumor tissue of breast cancer patients Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human mammary tumor virus (HMTV) are often detected [1] .\n\nWe have analyzed the possibility to detect a number of viruses and bacteria in tissues from patients with breast cancer. Preliminary tissue analysis of 10 patients with breast cancer has been carried out by and Mycoplasma complex were detected in the tissues after analyzing all these viruses and bacteria.\n\nThese pathogens were analyzed in a more detailed study. The results of analysis of Gardnerella vaginalis were previously published [2] .\n\nThe present work is dedicated to the identification of mycoplasmas in patients with breast cancer.\n\nMycoplasma is a genus of bacteria, which is formed by a large group of microorganisms different from the conventional bacteria by a small size and the lack of cell wall. Lack of a rigid cell wall allows a close contact with the cytoplasmic membrane of Mycoplasma cell. Under these conditions, mycoplasma is hardly recognized by the immune system as a foreign organism. In addition, mycoplasma is capable of penetrating into the cell and in this way becomes an intracellular parasite.\n\nThe intracellular location is a niche in which the mycoplasma is well protected from the immune system and the effect of many antibiotics. Mycoplasmas have a very small genome and, therefore, their survival depends on the host. Mycoplasmas have to use proteins, nucleic acids, cholesterol, fatty acids, etc., received from the host cells, to survive. At the same time, a disproportionately large number of mycoplasma genes are involved in cell adhesion problem and genes that contribute to the maintenance and care of parasitism surveillance by the immune system (for example, genes responsible for the synthesis of membrane antigens). Apparently, one of the main directions of mycoplasma's evolution in resolving the problem of survival is to become invisible to the immune system of the host organism. Mycoplasmas may participate in the development of several human diseases including chronic fatigue syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, psoriasis, scleroderma, atypical pneumonia, cystitis, and Alzheimer's disease, etc. Moreover, there is a reason to believe that mycoplasma can participate in the development of cancer, leukemia and lymphoma [3] .\n\nDNA samples from blood, saliva and tumor tissues of the Oncology Institute of Moldova patients diagnosed with breast cancer were analyzed. Blood and saliva collection from breast cancer patients performed in the Institute of Oncology of Moldova 1 -2 hours before tumor resection, and tissue samples -after tumor resection. All samples were stored and transported at +4\u00b0C. Time between sample collection and DNA isolation did not exceed 24 hours.\n\nDNA from blood and saliva and tumor tissues was isolated using lysis buffer containing 5M guanidinium thiocyanate, 50mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, then extracted with equal volume of phenol:chlorophorm and then chlorophorm. DNA was precipitated by 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 96% ethanol in the presence of 0.3M ammonium acetate. Tumor was grinded in liquid nitrogen with addition of lysis buffer before extraction.\n\nMycoplasma testing was performed using nested PCR method. For Mycoplasma spp. detection, we used primers from the region of the 16S-23S RNA genes and primers for the RNA polymerase beta subunit gene (Table 1) . Both rounds were 30 cycles, with 60\u00b0C annealing temperature. Each of the samples was analyzed twice. The amplification products were analyzed in 2% agarose gel. 100 bp. ladder (Fermentas) was used as a molecular marker.\n\nIdentification of Mycoplasma spp. in patients with breast cancer was carried out using primers from the region of the 16S-23S RNA genes. This region includes 16S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence;\n\n16S-23S ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer, complete sequence; and 23S ribosomal RNA gene, partial analysis. In this, more detailed analysis we used primers for RNA polymerase beta subunit gene. Figure   1A shows the result of analysis of DNA samples for blood, saliva and tumor tissue of four patients using 16S -23S primers. Figures 1B, 1C and 1D show results of analysis of saliva samples with primers, specific for RNA polymerase gene.

Unfortunately, almost nothing is known about molecular biology of M.faucium, but its properties may be similar to those of other mycoplasmas.\n\nFor example it is known that mycoplasmas trigger the secretion of cytokines, including IL-1b (interleukin-1b), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1), interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [5] . However, most of these cytokines are growth factors. This means that when they interact with appropriate receptors, D cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (cdk 4/6) appear in the cell, which in turn initiate cell division. If the growth factor receptors located on the cell membrane, which are present in breast tissue, it may mean that such cytokines may promote cell division in a mammary gland. At the same time, cell division which is not controlled by the organism is one of the main (if not the main) symptom of cancer. Thereby mycoplasmas theoretically are able to participate in the development of cancer by activating cell division. Data presented in the Table 3 show that some cytokines can participate in the development of cancer. * IL-1\u03b2 -activates T cells. IL-2 -T-cell growth factor, stimulates IL-1 synthesis, activates B-cells and NK cells. IL-4growth factor for activated B cells, resting T cells, and mast cells. IL-6 -stimulates Ig synthesis, growth factor for plasma cells. TNF-a -a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, TGF-\u03b1 is a mitogenic polypeptide. GM-CSF -it is a white blood cell growth factor."}
