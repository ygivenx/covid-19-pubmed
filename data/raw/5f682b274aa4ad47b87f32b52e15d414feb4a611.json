[1] [2] [3] [4] Visitor restriction policies are implemented as part of multifaceted approaches to reduce health careacquired infection, especially in high-risk areas such as intensive care units (ICUs), bone marrow transplant wards, and oncology wards. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] There are limited data, however, on the efficacy of these restrictions in the reduction of health care-related respiratory viral transmission. The purpose of this study was to describe the incidence of health care-acquired respiratory viral infections following changes to the visitation policy at a pediatric quaternary care hospital.\n\nCincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is a freestanding academic medical center that houses dedicated neonatal, pediatric, and cardiac ICUs totaling 119 beds. The remaining 408 beds are distributed amongst the non-ICU floors, including the general medicine and surgical wards, a bone marrow transplant ward, and an inpatient psychiatric unit. During fall 2015, a universal hospitalwide visitor policy allowing families to identify a fixed list of up to 6 nonparent, nonlegal guardian persons as visitors was adopted with the approval of a family advisory group in an effort to standardize practice across the hospital and reduce the potential risk of acquiring community pathogens during hospitalization. Nonsibling child and ill visitor restrictions continued during the winter respiratory viral season.\n\nTo determine the influence of this policy change on hospital respiratory viral transmission, health care-acquired respiratory viral infections were identified during the preintervention season (December 1, 2014-March 31, 2015) and the postintervention season (December 1, 2015-March 31, 2016). Health care-acquired respiratory viral infections were defined as a positive nasopharyngeal respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction panel (detects respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1-3, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus), respiratory syncytial virus antigen, or influenza A or B antigen obtained on or after hospital day 5 in a child without a previous positive test either during or in the 30 days preceding his or her hospitalization. Positive tests obtained before hospital day 3 were defined as infections present on admission. Testing obtained between hospital day 3 and 5 were excluded to account for incubating viruses present on admission. Of note, no viral surveillance screening programs exist at CCHMC; all testing performed is at clinicians' discretion guided by clinical symptoms. No additional infection control interventions directed against respiratory pathogen transmission were implemented between the pre-and postintervention seasons.\n\nIncidence rates of health care-acquired respiratory viral infections were calculated based on total at-risk patient-days, defined as hospital days on or after hospital day 5. Rates were calculated separately for the ICUs, where existing restrictions were liberalized, and for the non-ICU floors, where new restrictions were placed. Rates were compared using the 2-sample Poisson exact test. Proportions were compared using a 2-tailed \u03c7 2 or Fisher exact test. All analyses were performed using R version 3.1.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) (http://www.r-project.org).\n\nRespiratory viral testing results obtained on admission and during hospitalization are displayed in Tables 1 and 2 . Seventy-six children developed health care-acquired respiratory viral infections (60 in non-ICUs and 16 in ICUs) in the preintervention season compared with 52 (37 in non-ICUs, 15 in ICUs) during the postintervention season. The proportion of health care-acquired infections and infections present on admission due to influenza decreased during the postintervention season (P < .01). The incidence rate of health care-acquired respiratory viral infections due to any viral pathogen significantly decreased in the non-ICU floors (3.37-2.14 infections per 1,000 at-risk patient days; rate ratio, 0.63; confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.97; P = .03) during the postintervention season but not in the ICUs (1.95-1.57 infections per 1,000 at-risk patient days; rate ratio, 0.81; CI, 0.37-1.74; P = .67).\n\nHealth care-acquired respiratory viral infections can prolong hospital stays and increase mortality in critically ill children. 1 Visitor restriction policies during the respiratory viral season are implemented in many pediatric hospitals to reduce patient exposures to infectious individuals; however, there are few data on the efficacy of these interventions. By limiting direct access to the support network of patients and their families, these policies may create additional stress without providing benefit.\n\nWe report a 37% reduction in the incidence rate of suspected health care-acquired respiratory viral infections following standardization of the visitor restriction policy to limit the number of visitors during a patient's hospital stay. No significant changes in the incidence rate occurred in the ICUs where the restriction policy was liberalized, although functionally changed little. The postintervention respiratory season was milder, particularly for influenza, as illustrated by national surveillance data as well as the reduced number of children with positive admission tests that may have overestimated the effectiveness of the visitor restriction policy changes in both the ICU and non-ICU floors. 10 When excluding influenza testing, the incidence rate remained decreased on the non-ICU floors, although the effect size was not significant.\n\nThis study is limited by its observational design and by potential indication bias (where the criteria for viral testing may have differed among providers). Because this was an institutional quality improvement project, individual patient-level data were not collected and adjustment for potential confounding variables in the analysis was not performed. These findings can be used to guide institutional visitor restriction policies and to help convey to families and other visitors the potential risks of respiratory viral transmission within the hospital during periods of high community prevalence. Prospective controlled studies involving the collection of samples from both patients and bedside visitors are needed to more completely assess the role that visitors play in transmission of viral infections in hospitalized children.
