{"title": "Archives of Virology Protein Synthesis in Cells Infected by Murine Hepatitis Viruses JHM and A 59: Tryptie Peptide Analysis", "body": "The Coronaviridae is a family of RNA viruses which cause a wide variety of diseases in many species of animals, including man. The murine hepatitis virus (MttV) group includes viruses which cause diseases in mice, including hepatitis, chronic and acute neurological diseases, enteritis and nephritis (15) . The JHM strain of MHV is a strongly neurotropic agent which produces an acute encephalomyelitis in mice a few days after intraeerebral or intranasM inoculation (It, 15, 17, 29) . The A59 strain of 3/IHV is strongly hepatotropie, but weakly neurotropic (15, 17) .\n\nMHV particles contain a large (6.1 \u00d7 106 dMtons) single-stranded I~NA genome with positive polarity (t2, t3, t5). Cells infected by MHV contMn The sources and conditions for growing the murine cell lines 17 CI-t and DBT have been described (3, 7, 16, 28) . The sources and preparation of the stocks of MttV-JHM and MHV-A59 have also been described (3) . Cells were infected in suspension at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0,3 plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell, and virus was adsorbed at 37 \u00b0 C for 30 minutes at a concentration of 107 cells per rot. Infected cells were centrifuged, resuspended in prewarmed Dulbcceo's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 percent fetal bovine serum (DME 2) at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 106 cells per ml, plated into plastic culture dishes at a concentration of 3 \u00d7 105 cells per cm 2, and incubated at 37 \u00b0 C.\n\nCells (17 C1-1) were infected with MHV-JHM or MHV-A59 as described above and incubated at 33 \u00b0 C. At 6 hours postinfection (PI), the infected cells were washed twice with DME 2 containing 1/5 the normal amount of methionine and labeled with asSmethionine (50 ~Ci/ml) in the same medium. The cell culture fluid was harvested at 16--18 hours p.i. and cell-associated virus was released by 2 cycles of freeze-thawing. The virus particles were purified (12) , disrupted and prepared for SDS-PAGE.\n\nThe infected monolayers of DBT cells or 17C1-1 cells were washed twice with methionine-free DME 2, and radiolabeled withssS-methionine (200 ~Ci/ml) in methionine-free DME 2 from 6 to 8 hours p.i. Then, the cell layers were washed twice with serumfree complete medium (DME 0) and lysed in situ at 0 \u00b0 C with buffer B 10 [t0 m~ Tris-HC1 (pI-I 7.4), 5 m~ 2\u00a2IgCl~, 0.5 percent (vol/vol) NP40, 0.1 percent (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 percent (vol/vol) Aprotinin, 50 ~g/ml ribonuclease, 50 ~g/ ml deoxyribonuelease]. The cytoplasmic lysates were prepared for SDS-PAGE.\n\nSDS-PAGE was done as described by LAE~MLI and FAVaCE (9) . The analytical gets were processed for fluorography using EN3HANCE (New England Nuclear) and exposed to preflashed Kodak XAt~-2 X-ray film (10). Preparative gels of infected t7 C1-1 cell lysates for tryptie peptide mapping were dried without fixation and exposed directly to Kodak XAR-2 X-ray film to locate the bands of interest. The bands were excised from the dried gel, rehydrated and electroeluted (32) . A portion of each Muted protein was reanalyzed by SDS-PAGE to ensure that the band was free of crosscontamination from adjacent bands. The purified proteins were digested with trypsin and peptide maps were prepared (6, 13) . T h e v i r u s was d i s r u p t e d a n d a n M y z e d b y S D S -P A G E (Fig. 1 ). T h r e e p r o t e i n s of 180, 90 a n d 60 Fig. 1 . Autoradiogram of the structural proteins of MHV-A 59. The a, utoradiogram was overexposed to detect the E 2-90 K species and to demonstrate that no other methionine containing proteins were evident kilodaltons and a heterogeneous protein of 22 to 26 kilodaltons were resolved. The gel was overexposed to demonstrate that no other major methionine-containing proteins were detectable in the virus particles. On the basis of molecular weight, the 180 and 90 kilodalton proteins were equivMent to the E2 peplomerie complex described by STU~MA~-and HOL~ES (25, 26, 27) . The 22 to 26 kilodalton complex was equivalent to the E 1 envelope protein complex (25, 26, 27) . In repeated experiments, the 22 kilodMton protein was resolvable from the 24 to 26 kilodalton complex. However, the latter complex could not be resolved into discrete bands. The 60 kilodalton protein was equivalent to the nucleocapsid wotein, N (25, 26, 27) . Virus particles were purified from the eutture fluids of 17CI-i cells infected by MHV-JHM and analyzed in the same manner (data not shown). Similar results were obtNned, except the N protein of 3IHV-JH2~I was 63 kilodaltons instead of 60 kilodMtons. \n\nMHV-specifie proteins radiolabeled with asS-methionine were excised and eluted from SDS-polyacrylamide gels of purified virus particles or of lysates of 17Cl-1 cells infected by either MHV-A59 or MHV--JH~[. The eluted proteins, which were homogeneous by SDS-PAGE, were digested with trypsin and tryptic peptide maps were prepared.\n\nThe structure of E2-150K from MHV-A59 infected cells was compared to E2-180K and E2-90K from purified MHV-A59 particles (Fig. 3) . The tryptie maps of the E2-180K (panel B) and E2-90K (panel C) species were essentially the same. The tryptic map of the E2-150K (panel A) species was similar to the former species, but appeared to be more complex.\n\nThe nueleocapsid protein of MHV-A59 (N-60K) was smaller than t/he nucleocapsid protein of MHV-JHM (N-63K) (Fig. 2, ref. 2, 3) . Two proteins that migrated slightly faster than the nueleocapsid proteins (MHV-A59: p57, p54; MItV-JHM: p61, p56) were regularly detected in infected cell lysates (Fig. 2, ref. 2, 3) . The structures of the three intraeellular proteins N-60K, p57, p54 and the virion nucleocapsid protein N-60K were compared by tryptic peptide mapping (Fig. 4) as were the corresponding proteins of MHV-JHM (Fig. 5) . The tryptic peptide maps of the virion and intraeellular nueleoeapsid proteins were nearly identical. The same conclusion was drawn from the tryptie peptide maps of the corresponding MHV-JHM proteins. Although the molecular weights of the MHV-nueleocapsid proteins differed by a significant amount, the positions of the peptides in the maps were remarkably similar. The structure of the E 1-22 kilodMton protein from MHV-A59-infected cells was compared to the structure of the E 1 proteins of the MHV-A59 virus particle (Fig. 6) . The virion-associated E 1 protein was heterogeneous by S D S -P A G E (Fig. 1) . F o u r fractions of the E 1 complex from virus particles corresponding to 22, 24, 25 and 26 kilodMtons were analyzed (Fig. 6, panels A, B, C, D respectively) . The peptide map of the intracellular E 1-22K protein (panel E) was similar to the peptide map of the structural E i -2 2 K protein (panel A) suggesting t h a t the peptide structure of the proteins were the same. The E 1 proteins of M H V -J H M were analyzed in the same m a n n e r (Fig. 7) . The E 1 -2 3 K and E 1 -2 2 K intraeellutar proteins were b o t h analyzed (panels E, F). The peptide maps of these two proteins were similar. The maps of the 4 size classes of structural E 1 proteins (panels A, B, C, D) were similar to each other and to the 2 intracellular species. The peptide maps suggest that the intraeellular E1 protein(s) was the precursor to the structural E 1 proteins in the MHV virus particles. The differences in size of the E 1-22K protein compared to the larger E 1 species (24 to 26 kilodaltons) may be due to differential glyeosylation of the E 1-22K protein. The positions of the peptides in the maps of the MHV-A59 E 1 proteins (Fig. 6) were similar to those of the MHV-JHM E 1 proteins (Fig. 7) . The peptide maps of the MHV-A59 specific intraeellular proteins p14 and p35 (Fig. 8, panels b, d) demonstrated that the 2 proteins were unrelated to each other or to any of the other MHV-A59 specific proteins. The peptide maps of the corresponding MHV-JHM specific proteins (Fig. 8 , panels a, c) indicated that these proteins were also unrelated to each other or to any of the other MHV-JHM specific proteins. However, the positions of the peptides in the maps of p i 4 (Fig. 8, panels a, b) and p35 (Fig. 8 , Origins are indicated by asterisks panels c, d) suggested that the peptide structures of the corresponding proteins of the two strains of MHV were similar.\n\nCells infected by MHV-A59 or MHV-JHM have been reported to synthesize from five to nine virus-specific proteins (1, 3, 5, 18, 2t) . In this study, we compared the structures of the intracellular and structural proteins of MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 by tryptie peptide mapping of 35Smethionine-labeled proteins purified by SDS-PAGE.\n\nThe tryptic peptide maps shown in Fig. 3 indicated that the structural proteins E2-90K and E2-180K share common peptides with the intracellular protein E2-150K. The map of E2-t50K was somewhat more complex than the maps of E2-90K or E2-180K, suggesting that the protein E2-150K may be processed by cleavage during maturation. A 180 kilodalton protein was detected in MHV-infected DBT celt lysates (Fig. 2) . We have not detected this species in MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cell tysates (2, 3) . The reason for this observation is not known. LEIBOWlWZ et al. (13) demonstrated by immunoprecipitation with a monospecific antiserum that a 120 kilodalton protein synthesized in a cell-free system primed with MHV-A59 mRNA shared determinants with E2-150K. A 120 kilodalton protein has been detected in immunoprecipitates of MHVinfected cells treated with tunieamyein, an inhibitor of dolichol-mediated glycosylation (8, 18, 21) . STU~MA~ and HOL~Es (27) demonstrated that the MHV-A 59 structural proteins E 2-t 80 K and E 2-90 K shared peptides on the basis of tryptic peptide maps. ]?urthermore, these workers have suggested that treatment of MHV-A 59 particles with trypsin results in the cleavage of E2-180K to two 90 kilodalton species (25, 26, 27) . This result indicates the presence of a trypsin-sensitive site near the midpoint of the molecule. The results of this study coupled with the results of others (8, 13, 18, t9, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27) suggest two possible mechanisms for the maturation of the E2 protein. The 120 kilodalton primary gene product is glycosylated to the E2-150K species, cleaved to the E2-90K species and dimerized to the E2-180K species. In the alternative mechanism, the 120 kilodalton primary gene product may be glyeosylated to the E2-150K species, further glyeosylated to the E2-180K species and then cleaved at the trypsin-sensitive site near the midpoint of the molecule to form two E2-90K species with different primary structures. Resolution of the mechanism will require an analysis of the primary structure of each species of protein. The extensive glyeosylation of the primary gene product may prevent complete tryptic digestion of the proteins for the mapping studies. This suggestion is supported by the observation that a large proportion of the sample remained at the origin of the maps in Fig. 3 , panels A, B and C. C.W. BOND, K. ANDERSON, and J. L. LEIBOWITZ:\n\nThe tryptic peptide maps of the nucleocapsid proteins of MHV-A59 (N-60K) (Fig. 4) and MHV-JHM (N-63K) (Fig. 5 ) demonstrated that the corresponding proteins from the virus particles and from the lysates of infected cells were essentially the same. In addition, 2 more rapidly migrating species (MHV-A59: p57, p54; MItV-JHM: p61, p56), which were found only in infected cells, had tryptic peptide maps similar to the nucleocapsid proteins. There was also tryptic peptide homology between the N-60K nucleocapsid and p57 proteins synthesized by cell-free translation of MHV-A59 mRNA (13) . The more rapidly migrating species may be a result of proteolysis following celt lysis (1, 2t), prematur.e termination of transcription (13) or a result of posttranslational processing of the nucleocapsid protein. The function of the more rapidly migrating species related to the nucleocapsid proteins is not known.\n\nThe virion-associated E t proteins of MHV-A59 were heterogeneous in size (Fig. 1) . The tryptic peptide maps of the E 1 proteins of MHV-A59 shown in Fig. 6 demonstrated that the intracellular E 1-22K was related to the four fractions of structural E 1 from the virus particles. The tryptic peptide maps of the E 1 proteins of MHV-JHM shown in Fig. 7 demonstrated that the intracellular E 1-23K and E i-22K species were related to the four fractions of structural E 1 from the virus particles of MHV-JHM.\n\nPulse-chase studies have demonstrated that the E t-23K protein of both MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM is processed posttranslationally to the E 1-22 K species (2) . It has been shown that the larger E 1 species (E 1-24K to E 1-26K) are glycosylated (14, 18, 26) . Since the tryptic peptide maps of these E 1 species are similar and coupled with the data from our other study (2), a model for the maturation of the E 1 species may be proposed. The primary gene product, E 1-23K is translated, cleaved to the E 1-22K species and then differentially glycosylated to the heterogeneous E 1 complex found in the virion. The glycosylation is resistant to tnnicamycin (8, 14, 18) and has been found to be of the O-linkage type (14) . The corresponding proteins in the virions of avian infectious bronchitis virus also have a common primary sequence and are differentially glycosylated (4, 23) .\n\nA glycoprotein of 65 kilodaltons has been described as a surface protein of the MHV-JHM virus particle purified from infected Sac(-) cells (19, 21, 30) . There is no evidence of this protein in the virus particles of MHV-A59 (Fig. i, ref. 2, 3 , 18, 25, 26, 27) or in preparations of MHV-JHM from other laboratories (2, 3, 24) . An explanation of this paradox is that the strain of MHV-JHM used by these investigators (19, 21, 30) is either capable of synthesizing an unique glycoprotein of 65 kilodaltons in Sac(-) cells or a cellular protein may be specifically assembled into the virus particle. No in vitro MttV-specific translation product related to this protein has been described to date (t3, 20) .\n\nThe tryptic maps of the p35 and p14 proteins shown in Fig. 8 demon-strated that these proteins were not related to each other or to any of the other MHV-speeific proteins. These proteins have been detected previously in cells infected by MHV-JHM (3, 19, 2i) or MHV-A59 (3, 18). The proteins p35 and pt4 have been shown to be primary gene products by cell-free translation of MHV-A59 or MHV-JHI~I specific mRNAs (13, 20) . The functions of these proteins are not known at present.\n\nThere is extensive nucleic acid homology between the genomes of MHV-A59 and MItV-JHM (31). However, there is a major difference in the degree of neuropathogenicity between the 2 strains of MHV (17). The tryptic peptide maps of 35S-methionine labelled nucleocapsid-related proteins (Fig. 4, 5) , E 1-related proteins (Fig. 6, 7) and the intraeellular proteins p35 and p 14 (Fig. 8) demonstrated that substantial homology existed between the structural and intraeellular proteins of the two strains of MHV."}
