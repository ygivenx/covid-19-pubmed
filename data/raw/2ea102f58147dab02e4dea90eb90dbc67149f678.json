Their spike protein is comprised of S1 and S2 subunits, which are responsible for host receptor recognition and membrane fusion, respectively 12, 13, 18, 19 . 2019-nCoV has recently been confirmed to use the human ACE2 as receptor 20 .\n\nAlthough the fatality rate of 2019-nCoV is lower and the symptoms are milder than those of SARS, the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV appears to be higher 7 . The molecular mechanisms responsible for such rapid transmission and spread of the 2019-nCoV still remain elusive. Here, we have analyzed 120 2019-nCoV genome sequences including 11 novel strains isolated from patients to determine the viral evolution and divergence. 10 Our studies suggest that 2019-nCoV may increase its infectivity through the receptor binding domain recombination and a furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site insertion. author/funder.

Considering potential sequencing errors at both ends, the genome sequence variations among different strains of 2019-nCoV isolated from patients located in different cities were low considering only 5 several mutations in about 30kb genome per isolate. Based on the nucleotide positions 8517 and 27641, the 2019-nCoV strains can be divided into two major groups (Figs 2A and S2). All the group 1 strains have thymine at 8517 and cytosine at 27641, which are same as corresponding nucleotides in SARS, whereas the group 2 stains have cytosine at 8517 and thymine at 27641 (Figs 2A and S3) . Epidemiological data G1 and G2 strains 10 revealed that the collection date and location of the earliest G1 strain (EPI_ISL_406801) was January 5 th , 2020 in Wuhan, whereas the earliest G2 strain was isolated in December 24 th , 2019 in Wuhan (Fig 2A) . The existence of both genetic groups in the same city indicated co-circulation, but evolved convergently at the early outbreak. Within each group, we also observed additional shared mutations added to multiple strains. Based on 15 these potentially inheritable mutations and the identifying times and locations, we generated a mutation tree map to track individual shared mutations and show the relationships among different isolates (Fig 2A and S2 ). For example, five strains identified in Guangdong from Jan. 10-15 all share the same mutation in nucleotide position 28578 on the background of group 1 might be transmitted by the same person. The similar strain 20 may transmit to three patients identified in Japan on Jan. 29-31 with additional mutation at nucleotide position 2397 and to a patient identified in USA on Jan. 22 with additional mutation at nucleotide position 10818.

It is not clear if the common mutation both in group 1 and group 2 strains at 10818 site has any growth advantage but pangolin and bat CoV have L3606V substitution at the same position ( Fig S3) . When the group 1 and group 2 strains were placed onto geographic map (Fig 2B) , it seems that 5 both groups have been transmitted to most countries and regions with reported 2019-nCoV cases with few exceptions, suggesting these two groups are rapidly transmissible.\n\nThe most closely related strain, betacoronavirus RaTG13, was isolated from Rhinolophus affinis 15 (Fig 3A) . We performed additional phylogenetic analyses using nucleotide sequences for specific viral proteins such asorf1a, spike, matrix and (Table S1 ). The clade II viruses include 49 of bat SARS viruses (bat SARS CoV II) such as ZXC21 and ZC45, which share about 90% overall nucleotide and amino acid identity as the 2019-nCoV (Table S2 ). The major difference between these two clades is author/funder. All rights reserved.

Previous structural analysis have demonstrated that the 13-14 amino acid region of the SARS RBM forms a distinct loop structure, which is stabilized with a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues 9,15,16,21 . Although the amino acid sequences of 2019-nCoV within this loop region are very different from those 5 of human SARS, the two cysteine residues are conserved (Fig. 4B) . Interestingly, all the CoV viruses known to use ACE2 as entry receptor are within the clade I, including the 2019-nCoV, which can also infect cells through ACE2 receptor-based on recent studies 22 (Fig. S5 ). On the other hand, there is no report on using ACE2 as entry receptor for the clade II viruses, despite their overall genome sequence homology with 2019-nCoV.\n\nTherefore, our studies not only emphasize the critical role of the RBM in determining the specificity of entry receptors but also raise the question on how homologous strains of betacoronavirus switch tropism through mutations such as indel or recombination in the RBM.\n\nOur study also revealed that the 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion 15 (681-PRRA-684) within the spike protein, or within nucleotide position 23,619-23,632 ( Fig   4C) . Interestingly, such an insertion (PRRA) within the spike protein of 2019-nCoV creates a potential cleavage site RRAR for the mammalian furin protein, which the consensus sequence is RXXR. The potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site is inserted at the boundary between the S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, and the first proline 20 residue of the PRRA insertion may introduce a beta turn into the polypeptide chain. To understand the uniqueness of this insertion, we performed sequence comparison using represented SARS-CoV strains from human, civet and bat. Our study showed that this author/funder.

We have systematically analyzed and tracked the genome mutations among 120 different strains of 2019-nCoV. Although most substitutions are de novo mutations, we have identified 2019-nCoV as a member of the betacoronaviruses, shares similar genome structures as bat SARS, human SARS, MERS with nucleotide identity over 88%, 79%, about and 50%,respectively 23 . Its closest relative is the Beta CoV RaTG13, isolated from 20 bat in Yunnan province, China, in 2013, which shares more than 96% identical nucleotides throughout the genome of over 30 kb 15,24 . Our evolution clock analysis estimated that 2019-nCoV diverged from RaTG13 and human SARS-CoV at about 12 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Beside point mutations, there is also a potential evidence of recombination as a mechanism for the evolution of 2019-nCoV. We found that 2019-nCoV shares high identity with RaTG13 throughout the genome except for the RBD of spike protein, which is closer to Pangolin-CoV isolated in Guangdong 17 . Based on these findings we hypothesized that recombination in the RBD of the spike protein may happen 5 between RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV like strains during the evolution of 2019-nCoV.\n\nBat is believed to be the original host for the 2019-nCoV but its intermediate host before transmitting to human is not known whereas civets and camels are widely author/funder.

It has been shown that CoV may undergo a protease cleavage to trigger the viruscell membrane fusion 10,14 . This flexibility in priming and triggering the fusion machinery greatly modulates the viral pathogenicity and tropism of different coronaviruses 18,19 .\n\nHowever, such protease cleavage has not been detected in SARS-CoV 19 . Introducing a cleavage site into SARS-CoV resulted in spike protein cleavage and potentiated the membrane fusion activity 11 . In addition, introducing a cleaved spike protein into a SARS-CoV pseudotype virus allowed it to directly enter host cells 31 . Based on previous sequencing and structural analysis, the 2019-nCoV spike protein were predicted to 10 interact with the ACE2 receptor to trigger the fusion with the host cell membrane and initiate infection 29 . Therefore, mutations or indels altering the S1-S2 subunits should significantly impact viral infection. We hypothesize that the PRRA insertion may render the spike protein to cleavage process, which triggers the viral fusion event.\n\nAlthough the exact mechanisms responsible for such a high infection rates remains 15 to be further investigated, our data on both recombination in the RBD and the unique furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site insertion between the S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein may explain why the transmission of this newly emerged virus is significantly increased compared to the related beta-coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS. Further tracking the genome mutations with additional strains of 2019-nCoV isolated from patients in 20 different locations at different time points will provide insights to understand the molecular evolution of this rapid spreading viruses.

We For the spike protein, given the whole genomes of 2019 nCoVs (118 strains) and other SARS-like viruses isolated from Bat(1 strains) and Pangolin (6 strains), the genes was predicted by GeneMarkS (version 3.36). The predicted genes were then against the proteome of SARS-CoV by BLAST (version 2.2.25+). After that, Spike surface 20 glycoprotein (S) were picked, and RBD domain in Spike was also discriminated.

Finally, three phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software (version 10.0.5) by the maximum likelihood method with the bootstrap tests (100 replicates), and Fasttree software (version 1.43) were used to visualize these trees.\n\nThe SNPs of each sequence were defined as the sites variant from the reference sequence. The ancestral sequence of the phylogenetic tree was used as the reference sequence, which was estimated by python package TimeTree using Jukes-Cantor model and default settings. Site with the unsolved nucleotide N and gap was ignored. The site 10 number of the SNP was decided by sequentially combined the CDS sequences in the whole genome. The phylogenetic tree and the matching SNP for the tips was plotted by ggtree. The geo-distribution and genotype of strains with SNP sites in Wuhan and other areas were plotted by ggplot2. The SNP sites of 2019-nCoV were compared with SARSlike virus in one bat and eight pangolin genome sequences. The pangolin sequences 15 EPI_ISL_410543 and EPI_ISL_410544 were removed for too many unsolved nucleotides. The adjacent nucleotide of the two SNP sites 8517 and 27641 were extracted from the alignment. The translation-reading frame was inferred by using the GenBank annotations for the EPI_ISL_402125 strain.\n\nThe divergent evolution of G1 and G2 was tracked with the help of shared mutations as following steps.

In total, we divided all the genomes in G1 and G2 separately into three groups with 1, 2 and 3 varied nucleotides.
