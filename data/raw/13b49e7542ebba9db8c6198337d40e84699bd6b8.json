{"title": "Original Article", "body": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease associated with airway inflammation. 1 This disease affects approximately 334 million people worldwide and its prevalence is increasing. 2 According to the latest World Health Organization estimates released in December 2016, there were 383,000 asthma-related deaths in 2015. 3 Most of these deaths occur in low-and middle-income countries. 3 Exacerbations play an important role in asthma morbidity and mortality. 4 An exacerbation is defined as acute or subacute episodes of progressive worsening respiratory symptoms. 5 A severe exacerbation corresponds to an emergency consultation or hospitalization. 6 Asthma is an increasingly common cause of emergency department consultations. 7 Twenty percent of patients with asthma have experienced exacerbations requiring treatment within the emergency department or hospitalization and these patients account for more than 80% of the total direct costs of asthma. 8 Mortality among patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbations accounts for one-third of all asthma-related deaths. 9 Abbreviations used COPD-Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Infections with pulmonary tropism are very frequently involved in triggering asthma exacerbations (40%-80% of cases) 10 and are more often associated with failure of conventional treatments in patients with asthma. 11 Rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus are the most common viruses found in asthma exacerbations. 12 Rhinovirus is particularly related to asthma exacerbations and is found in 60% of children experiencing asthma exacerbations. 12 In adults, rhinovirus also seems to be frequently involved in asthma exacerbations. 13 Regarding virus-induced asthma exacerbations, the antiviral response is complex and involves immune cells leading to the release of inflammatory mediators. 14, 15 Immunoglobulins play a key role in the antiviral response, but knowledge remains limited about their involvement in virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Interestingly, it has recently been shown that patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia are more likely to suffer from viral infections, including rhinovirus, compared with healthy subjects, in spite of intravenous immunoglobulin replacement. 16 The prevalence of asthma appears to be higher in patients with various immune deficiencies including hypogammaglobulinemia, with an estimated prevalence of 15% in the studies. 17 The mechanism causing the increased prevalence of viral infections in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia is unknown. Secretory IgA deficiency in the bronchial mucosa has been suggested. 16 To our knowledge, the link between viral infections and serum immunoglobulin in patients with asthma is poorly understood.\n\nThe purpose of this project was to compare the serum IgG concentrations between patients with an upper airway specimen that tested positive for a virus and those with a negative viral specimen at the time of hospitalization for asthma exacerbations.\n\nAn observational study was conducted from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015 . Patients with asthma were recruited from the Department of Respiratory Medicine of the University Hospital of Tours, located in the center of France, as well as from the Department of Respiratory Medicine of the University Centre of Reunion, a French island located in the Indian Ocean. The socioeconomic statuses of the patients are very close because both locations are managed in the same way by the French government. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 years or older and hospitalized for an asthma exacerbation. An exacerbation was defined as the increase in respiratory symptoms for more than 24 hours or the use of oral corticosteroid therapy. Asthma diagnoses were established on a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing associated with variable expiratory airflow limitation before hospitalization according to the Global Initiative for Asthma. 1 Exclusion criteria were smoking more than 10 packs of cigarettes a year, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pregnancy. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de pneumologie de langue Fran\u00e7aise. Each patient gave an informed written consent to take part in the study.\n\nDemographic data such as age, sex, body mass index, smoking status quantified in packs per year (P/A), inhaled treatment prescribed before exacerbation, as well as the use and duration of oral steroids during the exacerbation were collected. The total serum IgE concentration (immunoassay technique, ImmunoCAP IgE total, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden), blood eosinophilia (Beckman Coulter LH 780 Controlled Analyzer), and C-reactive protein (Beckman Coulter LH 780 Controlled Analyzer, Holliston, Mass) were also collected. The severity of exacerbations was characterized by the length of the hospital stay including the time spent in the emergency room and if the patient needed to be treated in the intensive care unit. Controlled asthma was defined as an asthma control test score greater than or equal to 20 points in the month preceding the consultation. \n\nPatients received a follow-up visit 3 months after exacerbation. Functional respiratory tests were performed via flow-volume curves using a plethysmograph (SensorMedics Vmax Encore, Carefusion, San Diego, Calif). The values of both forced vital capacity and FEV 1 were expressed as a percentage of predicted values according to age, sex, weight, and height. Airway obstruction was defined by a postbronchodilator FEV 1 /forced vital capacity ratio of less than 70%. Measurements were taken according to ATS/ERS 2006 recommendations using the predicted values published by the ERS. 18, 19 Prick tests to aeroallergens (house dust mites [Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae at both sites and Blomia tropicalis in Reunion]), mold (Alternaria alternata), animal dander (cat and dog), cockroaches (Blattella germanica), tree pollens (olive tree, birch), and herbaceous plants (ragweed, ambrosia, wormwood, and grasses) were also carried out.\n\nQuantitative data with a normal distribution were expressed as mean and SD, and quantitative data with no normal distribution were expressed as median deviation (interquartile range). Qualitative data were expressed as frequencies (%). A Student t test (parametric) was used to compare continuous variables with normal distribution. The Mann-Whitney test was used for quantitative data and had no normal distribution. Statistical significance was defined as a P value of less than .05. Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to assess serum IgG concentrations as a potential marker of a positive virus specimen. The best IgG cutoff was determined using the Youden index. Sensitivity and specificity of IgG cutoff for a positive virus sample were also defined. A Spearman test was used to assess the correlation between serum IgG concentrations and other continuous variables. The linearity of these relations was then tested using linear regression. The statistical analysis was carried out using the Graph Pad Prism 5 software (license reference: GPW6-222441-RILS-2C3D1).\n\nEighty-two patients were included in this study. The patients' characteristics are summarized in Table I . The median age was 49.5 (28.8-63.3) years. Patients were predominantly female (76.8%) and overweight, with a median body mass index of 26.3 (22.1-31.2) kg/m 2 . Inhaled corticosteroid treatment was used in 61% of patients before asthma exacerbation, and 14.6% of all patients required intensive care at the time of exacerbation. The median duration of oral corticosteroid therapy and the median length of stay for the exacerbation were 7.0 days and 4.0 days, respectively.\n\nNasopharyngeal aspirations were positive for viruses in 48.8% of patients. The most common viruses were rhinovirus (38%), myxovirus influenza (18%), metapneumovirus (12%), and enterovirus (10%) (Figure 1) .\n\nPatients with a positive or negative viral sample showed no statistically significant difference in terms of demographic and biological data (Table II) . Patients with positive nasopharyngeal aspiration for viruses were slightly younger than patients with negative nasopharyngeal aspiration for viruses (43.5 vs 50.5 years, respectively) with no statistical significance (P > .05). Patients with positive viral specimens also seemed to be hospitalized in intensive care units more often compared with patients harboring negative viral specimens (20% vs. 9.5%, respectively); however, the difference was not significant.\n\nPatients with a positive viral sample had significantly lower serum IgG concentrations than patients hosting a negative viral specimen (10.1 AE 2.3 g/L vs 11.5 AE 3.6 g/L; P < .05) (Table III) . No difference was found for serum IgA and IgM concentrations in both groups. IgG subclasses were similar between groups. An inverse correlation was observed between age and serum IgG concentrations (P \u00bc .016). No other correlation was shown for the other demographic characteristics.\n\nReceiver operating characteristic curve analyzing the serum IgG concentrations as a marker for predicting a specimen positive for a virus is presented in Figure 2 . According to Youden index, the best cutoff value of serum IgG to predict a positive virus sample is 12.30 g/L, and the optimal sensitivity and specificity were 80.0% and 40.5%, respectively.\n\nThe median serum concentration of IgG was significantly lower in patients hospitalized for more than 3 days than in those whose hospital stay was less than or equal to 3 days (10.0 g/L [8.2-12.4] vs 11.4 g/L [10.1-12.8]; P < .05) (Figure 3, B) . Patients receiving oral corticosteroids for more than 5 days had lower median serum IgG concentrations than patients who were given corticosteroid therapy for 5 days or less (10.1 g/L [8.3-12.2] vs 11.6 g/L [10-13.8], respectively; P < .05) (Figure 3, C) . The median serum concentration of IgG was not significantly different if patients were hospitalized in intensive care units or not (Figure 3, A) . An inverse correlation was observed between the length of stay and the serum J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT VOLUME 7, NUMBER 5\n\nIgG concentration (P \u00bc .022 with the Spearman test) (Figure 4) . No correlation was found between oral steroids and serum IgG concentrations. Receiver operating characteristic curves have been created according to the length of stay and the steroid duration to know the reliability of serum IgG concentrations as a predictive biomarker of exacerbation severity. For the length of stay prediction ( 3 days or >3 days), the best sensitivity and specificity of IgG concentrations are 80.00% and 50.00%, respectively, for a cutoff value of 11.05 g/L (see Figure E1A , in this article's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org). Regarding the steroid duration prediction ( 5 days or >5 days), for a cutoff value of 9.99 g/L, the best sensitivity and specificity of IgG concentrations are 62.07% and 66.67%, respectively ( Figure E1B ). If a positive virus sample is combined with the IgG serum concentrations, for a cutoff of 10.75 g/L, the best sensitivity and specificity of the length of stay prediction are 79.17% and 61.11%, respectively. Regarding a cutoff of 11.05 g/L, the best sensitivity and specificity of the steroid duration prediction are 82.76% and 55.00%, respectively ( Figure 5 ).\n\nPatients with asthma with a positive nasopharyngeal viral sample had a lower serum IgG concentration, at the time of exacerbation, than those with a negative viral sample. Moreover, the median serum IgG concentration was lower in patients hospitalized for more than 3 days as well as in those who were given oral steroids for more than 5 days compared with their counterparts. In our study, the epidemiology of viruses found in patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbations was similar to data observed in the literature. Indeed, herein, rhinovirus was the most frequently observed pathogen (38%). This virus is known to be more often associated with asthma exacerbations in children, [20] [21] [22] and some works suggest that it is also the most incriminated virus in severe asthma exacerbations in adults. 13, 23, 24 Our patients also presented with other viruses such as myxovirus influenzae. Myxovirus influenza, particularly influenza A H1N1, is responsible for a significant morbidity and mortality in patients with asthma. [25] [26] [27] Enterovirus appears to be less frequently found in the literature. 28 In our cohort, enterovirus was always found in coinfection with rhinovirus and this represented 5 of 10 patients who had coinfections. The 5 remaining patients were coinfected with rhinovirus/myxovirus influenza A (n \u00bc 3), metapneumovirus A and B/myxovirus influenza A H1N1 (n \u00bc 1), adenovirus/myxovirus influenza A (n \u00bc 1), and coronavirus 229E/myxovirus influenza A (n \u00bc 1). No relationship between coinfection and serum IgG concentrations or the severity of exacerbations was found.\n\nNo demographic differences were found between the patients with positive virus samples and those with negative virus samples. However, although the difference was not statistically significant, patients with a positive virus sample were slightly younger compared with their negative counterparts (43.5 vs 50.5 years, respectively). The lack of significance is probably due to the small sample size. It is well known that asthma exacerbation in young people is associated with virus infections. 29 Body mass index appears to be a bit higher in patients with positive virus samples compared with patients with negative virus samples (29 kg/m 2 vs 25 kg/m 2 , respectively), but the difference is also not significant. The risk of viral infections in obese patients with asthma has been identified elsewhere in the literature. Indeed, asthma and obesity have been found as independent risk factors of pandemic influenza hospitalization. 30 In our study, more patients in the positive virus group required intensive care although there was no significant difference. Data from the literature suggest that respiratory viruses may trigger severe asthma exacerbations, particularly in young people. 31 The link between viral infections and asthma exacerbations is widely recognized and the impairment of viral immunity may partly explain the development of viral infections in patients with asthma. 32, 33 In influenza infections, IgG has been identified as being particularly involved in protecting the respiratory tract against viruses and its role seems to be superior to that of IgA. 34 Rhinovirus-specific IgG appears to prevent and control reinfection and a high concentration of specific IgG antibodies is correlated with the attenuation of respiratory symptoms and a reduction in viral shedding. 35 A decrease in specific viral antibodies in patients with asthma has been suggested. 36 However, in another study, higher antibody responses to rhinovirus have been shown in patients with asthma compared with controls without asthma. 37 Given the study conducted by Johnston et al 10 on rhinovirus involvement in asthma exacerbations in children, we may also speculate that the admitted patients had less exposure to school-age children in the past and therefore had not generated a sufficient antibody response to the current virus(es). Other mechanisms beyond adaptive immunity dysfunction are involved in virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Indeed, an altered innate immune antiviral response has been observed in patients with asthma compared with those without asthma. [38] [39] [40] Our study does not add a mechanistic explanation for the low level of serum IgG in patients with a positive virus sample.\n\nOur results may suggest that serum IgG concentrations at the time of asthma exacerbation would be a marker of severity. Indeed, patients with a hospitalization length of more than 3 days or a steroid course of more than 5 days show lower IgG concentrations at the time of exacerbation. Among patients with stable COPD, reduced total IgG levels have been linked to an increased risk of exacerbations and hospitalizations. 41 In that study, patients with serum IgG level of less than 7 g/L had a higher risk of COPD exacerbations compared with patients with the highest quartile of serum IgG. We assessed the predictive ability of serum IgG concentrations as a biomarker of exacerbation severity. However, it does not seem to be a useful predictor based on modest sensitivity and poor specificity. If we combine serum IgG concentrations and a positive virus sample, the prediction of exacerbation severity was not improved, and further studies are needed to specifically assess IgG level as a marker of severity in asthma exacerbations. The prediction of next hospitalizations with IgG levels would also be interesting, but we cannot answer this question with our study because it was not designed to answer this question. However, we may speculate that a low IgG level particularly at baseline would predispose patients to virus infection and consequently increase their risk of hospitalization.\n\nOur study does have several limitations. The difference in IgG concentrations between patients with positive and negative viral samples is statistically significant, but it remains uncertain whether this difference is clinically relevant or not. More robust studies on the role of IgG are needed. In addition, the change in IgG concentrations or other immunoglobulins over time was not assessed in our study. We did not measure IgG in patients in a stable condition. It would have been interesting to know if the IgG decline is transient or longer-lasting. Indeed, in patients with COPD, low IgG serum concentrations at baseline seem to be associated with more severe exacerbations per year. 41 However, in this study, no virus analysis was performed. Finally, our study is based on multiplex PCR for virus identification. Nevertheless, the list of viruses, though very extensive, is not exhaustive; therefore, emerging viruses cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe results of our study show that serum IgG level was significantly lower when severe asthma exacerbations were associated with a positive viral sample. Serum IgG levels were lower in patients with a longer length of stay and when a course of oral steroids was prescribed for a longer duration. Further studies are requested to know the exact usefulness of IgG concentrations as a severity marker of severe asthma exacerbations. The understanding of immunologic mechanisms of viral infection in severe asthma exacerbations may be an interesting lead for the development of new therapies in patients for whom severe exacerbations are a source of significant morbidity and mortality. .
