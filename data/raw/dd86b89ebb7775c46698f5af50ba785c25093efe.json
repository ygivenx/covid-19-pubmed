The study was supported by the team of physicians, researchers and nursing 27 staff at NCID and in particular we will like to acknowledge the support from research Of the 17 patients recruited, none presented with ocular symptoms. However, 1 patient 81 developed conjunctival injection and chemosis during the stay in the hospital (Table 1 82 available at www.aaojournal.org). 14 patients presented with upper respiratory tract 83 symptoms including cough, rhinorrhea and sore throat. 84 6 A total of 64 samples were taken over the study period, with 12, 28 and 24 samples taken 85 from first, second and third week of initial symptoms respectively. All were tested negative 86 for the SARS-CoV-2 on viral isolation and RT-PCR. Tear results were compared with NP 87 results as shown in Figure 1 . Ct values of NP swabs were featured. 88 To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing viral shedding in tears with NP results 89 during the course of COVID-19 infection. A previous study showed positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-90 PCR results from a patient's tears, but isolation of the virus was unsuccessful 5 . In this study, 91 there was no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in tears through the course of the disease. 92 Viral load detected in nasal and throat swabs are elevated for a period of approximately 2 93 weeks from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms 6 . In this study, the tear sampling timepoints "}
