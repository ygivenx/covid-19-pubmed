{"title": "APPLICATION OF RADIOIMMUNOLOGICAL METHODS FOR CHECKING THE QUALITY OF CLASS-SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES AGAINST BOVINE AND PORCINE IMHUNOGLOBULINS", "body": "A number of immunological methods make current use of anti--immunoglobulin antibodies for the needs of both research and practical diagnosis. Labelled with radioactive isotope or conjugated with enzyme, these antibodies are also used in a number of radioimmunoassays (RIA) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). However for more detailed immunological studies on the dynamics and character of the immune response, it is necessary to use specific antibodies to individual immunoglobulin classes.\n\nSince suitable class-specific antibodies to bovine and porcine immunoglobulin classes are not currently available, we decided to prepare our own monospecific antisera and to isolate antibodies suitable for labelling with 125I or conjugation with enzyme.\n\nThe class specificity of the antibodies wae assessed by radioimmunoelectrophoresis and double antibody sandwich RIA. These methods are highly specific, sensitive, do not require the use of purified immunoglobulins, but can be performed using normal serum or colostrum. The results obtained in our study confirmed good quality of the antibodies and their suitability for a wide range of use including RIA and ELISA.\n\n~re,paration of a,ntisera and isola,tion o,f immunoglobulins\n\nThe animals employed were chinchilla rabbits weighing 2 to 3 kg. Antisera against various immunoglobulin classes were prepared by repeated immunization of the rabbits with purified immunoglobulins or antigen-antibody complexes in Freund\u00b0s adjuvant (Duncan et al., 19721 Nansen et al., 1971 ).\n\nIsolation of bovine and porcine immunoglobulins was carried out according to standard procedures (Masseyeff et al., 1965~ Bourne 1969~ Butler and Maxwell, 1972~ Cambier and Butler, 1974 .\n\nThe antisera prepared were freed from non-specific antibodies by affinity chromatography on Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) with covalently bound bovine or porcine immunoglobulins of the corresponding classes (Hatch et al., 1974) o The same method was used to isolate specific antibodies against individual immunoglobulin classes from the monospecific antisera. The yields depended on the quality of the antisera, ranging from 1 to 3.5 mg antibody/ml antiserum. After elution with 0\u00b01M glycine-HC1 buffer, pH 2.8, and dialysis, the antibodies were lyophilized and stored in sealed ampoules until use.\n\nSpecific antibodies were labelled by means of chloramine T iodination (Mc Conahey and Dixon, 1956) , More than 98 ~j of non--dialysable activity was precipitated with lO ~j trichleracetic acid. Specific activity of the labelled proteins ranged between 18.5 and 185 MBq/mg. The labelled antibodies were kept in phosphate buffered saline (PDS) supplemented with lO mg/ml rabbit serum albumin (RSA) or with lO ~ rabbit serum obtained from non--immunized animals.\n\nElectrophoretlc separation of pig and bovine sera and bovine colostral whey was carried out in 1,5 ~ agar (Noble agar, Difco) containing 0.05 N veronal buffer, pH 8.6, on glass plates (ReJnek and Bedna~ik, 1960) . After the separation was completed, rabbit precipitating antisera against porcine (RASw) or bovine (RAB) serum and colostrum proteins were placed into troughs, Antiserum in individual troughs contained supplements of l25I-labelled anti--immunoglobulin antibodies of different class specificity with an activity of 30 to 70 KBq/ml antiserum. After precipitation lines had been formed, the plates were thoroughly washed in PBS for 2 days, air-dried and covered with x-ray film (Hedix Rapid, Foma). The film was developed after exposure for 2 to 3 days, the plates were stained with amido black lOB and the precipitation lines in agar were compared with the lines exposed on the film.\n\nWith this method, serum and colostral proteins are precipitated with rabbit antisera (RASw or RAB) which form precipitation lines with individual proteins. 1251-1abelled antibodies added to these antisera have only a share in the formation of precipitation lines. !!! i J J Labelled monospecific antibodies are required to incorporate only into a single, precisely determined precipitation line and not to react with other protein antigens. Presence of non-specific antibodies is manifested by radioactivity binding also in other precipitation lines. The results obtained (Fig, 1 and 2) show that 125I-labelled antibodies against bovine and porcine immuneglobulins are strictly class-specific because they react only with the required immunoglobulln classes and their precipitation lines are the only ones exposed in X-ray film.\n\nThe higher sensitivity of radioimmunoelectrophoresis as compared with electrophoresis was demonstrated by checks on the quality of rabbit antiserum against porcine IgM (RASwIgN). On immunoelectrophoretic examination this antiserum was monospeclfic end formed precipitation lines only with serum and colostral IgM (Fig, 3A) . The crude immunoglobulin fraction of this antiserum obtained by precipitation with ammonium sulphate (twice at 45 % saturation) and labelled with 125I was used for radioimmunoelectrophoretic examination (Fig. 3B) , The lines exposed on X-ray film (Fig. 3C) show that the labelled antibodies reacted not only with porcine IgH but also with IgO and serum alpha 2-macroglobulin.\n\nchecks on the spe,ctfi,,c,!t Y ,of antibodies by do,uble, an,tlbody sandwich RIA\n\nThe quality of the antibodies obtained was also checked by double antibody sandwich RIA. However, only the results of evaluation of antibodies against porcine immunoglobulin classes are presented here in detail.\n\nDisposable polystyrene flat-bottomed microtubes in piasttc plate holders were employed (the size and arrangement of the wells were the same as in the plates for the microtitre ELISA). In each of three plates employed, four of the 12 vertical rows of wells were filled with one of the solutions of the tested rabbit antibodies against porcine immunoglobulln classes (RASwIgG, RASwIgM, RASwIgA). A lO0/ul amount of antibody soiutton in 0.1 mol carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, having the antibody concentration of lO/ug/ml, was pieced in each well. After adsorption of the antibodies overnight at 20 \u00b0C and subsequent washing, all the wells were filled with 100/ul amounts of normal pig serum diluted threefold in the range of 1:100 to 1:218 700 with PBS containing 0.5 ~ bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.02 ~ Tween 20.\n\nEach horizontal row of 12 wells contained one serum dilution.\n\nAfter incubation for 2 hours at 20 \u00b0C and subsequent washing the plates were incubated with the solution of the tested 1251--labelled class-specific antibodies under the same conditions, All the wells of one plate were filled with labelled antibodies of one class specificity. To each well, lO0/ul of the antibody solution in PB3 supplemented with 0.5 o~ RSA and 0.02 ~j Tween, having the activity of 15 KBq/ml, was added, After final washing (each washing three times with PBS) the activities bound in individual wells were measured with an NE 1600 counter for 1251 (Nuclear Enterprises, Ltd, Edinburgh) and mean activities and standard deviations were calculated from groups of four squally incubated wells (Fig, 4) . On the third incubation with 1251--labelled specific antibodies during this procedure, the binding of antibodies and therefore also of radioactivity occurred only in those wells that contained the specifically bound pig serum immunoglobulin. In other words, the radioactivity of the wells ( Maxwell, 1972~ Duncan et al., 1972) . Antibodies or antisera that prove satisfactory by these methods are generally of sufficient quality also for other immunological studies. The presence of non-specific antibodies, however, may not be demonstrated, particularly if the non-specific precipitation activity was removed by dilution or insufficient immunosorption of the antiserum. Therefore agglutination method is used for more exact purposes (Hirota et al., 1980) . In this method monospecific antiserum agglutinates only those erythrocytes on the surface of which immunoglobulin of the corresponding class has been adsorbed\n\nThe disadvantage of this test is that accurate results can be obtained only with highly purified immunoglobulins and that it is not possible to reveal the presence of antibodies against proteins of non-immunoglobulin nature. On the analogous principle of the direct reaction of antibody with the corresponding antigen (immunoglobulin), a check on the cias$ specificity of antibodies was developed using an enzyme linked immunoeorbent assay (Franz and Corthier, 1981) .\n\nThe antibodies prepared by us were therefore evaluated by meane of the radioimmunoelectrophoretic method, This method is highly specific and has the advantage over the latter test in that it uses normal serum or colostrum as the source of antigens. In this method, i251-1abelled specific antibodies participate in the formation of a certain precipitation line. The presence of non-specific antibodies is manifested in that the radioactivity is demonstrated also in other precipitation lines.\n\nThe fact that 125z-labelled antibodies have only a share in the formation of the precipitation lines makes it possible to demonstrate even low non-specific activity which is not revealed by common precipitation methods (e.g, immunoelectrophoresis). The results presented here (Fig. 1, 2 and 3 ) confirm that the antibodies tested are strictly class-specific and that low concentrations of non--specific antibodies in insufficiently saturated monospecific sera cannot be detected by immunoelectrophoresls where considerable disproportion between the antigen and antibody concentrations makes formation of the respective precipitation lines\n\nimpossible.\n\nThe quality of the antibodies prepared was also assessed by means of double antibody sandwich RZA. This method, too, uses normal serum or colostrum as the source of antigen. We presumed that class-specific antibodies bound to the microtube walls would react only with immunoglobulins of one class on incubation with the serum. The binding of these immunoglobulins would be demonstrated by 125I-labelled antibodies, The actlvity demonstrated in wells incubated repeatedly with solutions of antibodies of the same class specificity would be significantly higher than that found in wells incubated with antibodies of different class specificity, In our experiments this presumption was confirmed ( Fig. 4 ) and the activities for same-class were as much as 23.1 to g3,9 times higher than for different-class specificity.\n\nIn RIA demonstration of anti-virus antibodies using triplicate determinations, even a double increase in activity as compared with control samples was regarded as highly significant (Rod&k etal,, 19810 1982) . Antibodies that proved satisfactory by this method can therefore also be regarded as class-specific, After labelling with radioactive isotopes or conjugation with enzyme such antibodies can be used even for radio-and enzymoimmunological studies. Their usefulness was confirmed in a study by RIA of the dynamics of the production of class-specific antiviral antibodies in cattle (Rod~k etal., 1983) .\n\nThe skilled technical assistance of Mrs. A.
