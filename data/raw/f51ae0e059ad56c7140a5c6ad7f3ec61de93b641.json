With bibliography, introduction, and summary hhttp://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/department/i This paper was published as a result of the Action Programme for the Millennium, which committed the Irish government to examine the issues involved with introducing a basic income payment and the work of a Steering Group on Basic Income, reporting its study in 2001. This study involved replacing the existing social welfare and income tax systems with a universal payment to all adults, a flat rate of income tax, and a social solidarity fund to compensate low-income people. The objectives of this green paper are to facilitate and encourage further debate and discussion by a further examination of the implications of the introduction of a basic income system in Ireland. It also discusses a possible framework for the development of a basic income system, with alternative policy options, and provides background for the discussion and a history of the basic income concept for Ireland. There are links to the full text of the three study reports commissioned by the Steering Group as well as its overview report (2001) , which are also available on the Department of the Taoiseach Web site, and the parameters used in the studies. Furthermore, it assesses the possible impact of a basic income approach in Ireland. Summary and conclusions complete the green paper. The key findings of the Steering Group on Social and Equality Statistics during the period April-November 2002 are reported in this study. The group's charge was to study what was needed to be done to develop Irish social and equality statistics to meet current and pending needs and to identify the specific data needs to build social statistics that more efficiently support the policy needs of decision-makers. Twelve recommendations are made, especially in reference to the Central Statistics Office and the National Statistics Board, which describe a larger vision for social statistics in a national framework. The report recommends that a formal data/statistics strategy be devised within each department and more standardization used in coordination and classifying data collection and maintenance. Availability of the data on the Internet in a user-friendly form is also a recommendation.
