{"title": "APOBEC3-mediated restriction of RNA virus replication", "body": "Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like type 3 (APOBEC3) proteins are Zn2+ - dependent cytidine deaminases that belong to the APOBEC superfamily. APOBEC3 enzymes are considered to be part of the intrinsic defense system in eukaryotic cells, and can inhibit replication of some viruses and restrict mobile genetic elements. All APOBEC3 proteins share a cytidine-deaminase domain, which is identifiable by the primary amino acid motif His-Xaa-Glu-Xaa23\u201328-Pro-Cys-Xaa2\u20134-Cys, in which Zn2+ is coordinated. Deamination of cytidine results in its conversion to uridine. During this process, the ammonium group on C4 of cytidine undergoes nucleophilic attack by an activated water molecule and the APOBEC3 glutamate residue.\n\nA single copy of a gene encoding APOBEC3 is found in the genomes of rodents, cats, pigs and sheeps, with two genes in the genomes of cows, three the genomes of dogs and horses and seven genes in the human genome, encoding A3A, A3B, A3C, A3D, A3F, A3G and A3H1. The mechanisms and selective pressures that led to the APOBEC3 gene expansion in humans are unclear, but it is believed that all the genes originated from duplication of a single-copy primordial APOBEC3 gene. This multiplication may have provided protection from genomic instability caused by human endogenous retroviruses and retrotransposons2.\n\nThe best-studied protein within the human APOBEC3 family is A3G. Its function as an antiviral factor was discovered in 2002 through cDNA-transfer experiments that were designed to identify a cellular suppressor of an HIV-1 accessory protein, the virion infectivity factor (Vif). The primary antiretroviral activity of A3G requires its encapsidation into HIV-1 particles, and involves cytidine deamination of the reverse-transcribed first viral DNA strand, with mutations becoming fixed as G to A changes upon second-strand synthesis. Mutational frequencies can exceed 10% of all G residues (hypermutation), and may result in inhibition of viral replication. This activity is blocked by Vif protein, which specifically binds to and ubiquitinates A3G, directing it for degradation in the proteasome1,3,4. Other APOBEC3 proteins have been found to affect a wide variety of viruses, including other retroviruses (e.g., simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), foamy viruses), and DNA viruses (e.g., hepatitis B virus, parvovirus)5\u201314. As well as the inhibition of viral replication by hypermutation, APOBEC3-induced mutations also cause degradation of viral genomic material, mediated by cellular DNA-repair mechanisms15.\n\nThe RNA-editing capability of APOBEC3 proteins was identified in 200416, since when extensive mutational activity of A3A on RNA transcripts in monocytes and macrophages has been demonstrated17. Our current understanding of the APOBEC3 proteins suggests that they may also constitute an innate defense system against RNA viruses. For example, A3G known to be involved in restriction of three RNA pathogens (the mumps, measles and respiratory syncytial viruses), but whether this effect is associated with cytidine deamination is not yet known18.\n\nMembers of the family Coronaviridae are positive-strand RNA viruses with large genomes, ranging in size from 27 to 32 kb. Six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified, four of which (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) circulate continuously in human populations. These four viruses cause the common cold in otherwise healthy adults, and may cause more severe symptoms in young, elderly and immunocompromised individuals19\u201322. Other coronaviruses that infect humans can cause severe and life-threatening diseases. In 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged and affected ~8,000 individuals, causing ~800 deaths23,24. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the most recently identified coronaviruse that infects humans. MERS-CoV was isolated in 2012 and is associated with severe pneumonia and renal failure, with a mortality rate of ~30%25,26.\n\nHCoV-NL63 was identified in 2004 and is distributed worldwide, with highest prevalence during winter and early spring in temperate climate27. HCoV-NL63 accounts for a considerable number of hospitalisations among children <18 years of age, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals19. A notable characteristics of coronaviruses is that their genomes are highly U/A-rich and C/G-poor. For example, HCoV-NL63 has 39% U and 27% A content, with only 14% C and 20%, G nucleotides28. The explanations for this bias is not yet known28,29. One possibility is that, over an evolutionary timescale, genomes of coronaviruses might have been shaped by cytidine deamination. Our aim, therefore, was to determine whether APOBEC3 proteins might be responsible for this modification. Our results demonstrate that three of the APOBEC3 proteins (A3C, A3F and A3H) can inhibit coronaviral infection in vitro.\n\nModulation of human APOBEC3-family transcript levels in human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures during coronavirus infection was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) with primers and standards developed in our lab. The level of each APOBEC3 mRNA was analysed in fully differentiated cells from healthy adults, and a high level of expression was observed for six out of seven human APOBEC3 genes (Fig. 1a). The same six genes (APOBEC3A, APOBEC3C, APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G and APOBEC3H) were expressed during HCoV-NL63 infection, and these genes were analysed in subsequent experiments.\n\nHAE cultures were infected with HCoV-NL63 and cultured for 5 days at 32 \u00b0C. As a control, HAE cultures were infected with influenza A H3N2 virus, which induces considerable upregulation of APOBEC3G30. RT-qPCR analysis of total RNA extracted from infected cells revealed upregulation of APOBEC3A, APOBEC3C, APOBEC3D and APOBEC3F transcripts in HCoV-NL63-infected cells relative to mock-infected cells, with an almost 100-fold increase in APOBEC3A expression (Fig. 1b). As anticipated, APOBEC3G was upregulated in the influenza-infected cells, and APOBEC3H expression also increased (Fig. 1c).\n\nPlasmids encoding individual APOBEC3 proteins were prepared and transfected into 293T cells, which were cultured and analysed for protein expression by western blotting (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Figure 1). For expression in the naturally permissive LLC-Mk2 cell line, in which the DNA transfection efficiency is very low (data not shown), mRNA transcripts encoding APOBEC3 proteins or green fluorescent protein (GFP) were prepared by in vitro transcription. Transfection of LLC-Mk2 cells was efficient, reaching ~80% for the control GFP mRNA (Fig. 2b). Expression of HA-tagged APOBEC3 proteins in mRNA transfected LLC-Mk2 cells, measured by flow cytometry, was similar for all proteins (Fig. 2c).\n\nmRNA-transfected LLC-Mk2 cells were infected with HCoV-NL63 and cultured for 5 days at 32 \u00b0C. No cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in cells expressing A3C, A3F and A3H proteins, but CPE was observed in untransfected or GFP-transfected cells, and in cells expressing A3A, A3DE and A3G (Fig. 3a). Analysis of HCoV-NL63 replication showed a 1.5\u20132 log reduction in virus yield in cells expressing A3C, A3F and A3H, relative to the control sample. By contrast, HCoV-NL63 replication was not inhibited in cells expressing GFP, A3A, A3D or A3G (Fig. 3b).\n\nBecause HCoV-NL63 infection resulted in upregulation of expression of A3A, A3C, A3D and A3F and A3C, A3F and A3H all inhibited HCoV-NL63 replication, we tested whether this inhibition was the result of the catalytic activity of the APOBECs. Plasmids encoding variants of A3C, A3F and A3H with Glu \u2192 Gln substitutions in the catalytic site were prepared31 and mRNAs encoding active or inactive proteins were transfected into LLC-Mk2 cells, which were infected with HCoV-NL63 and cultured prior to visualisation of viral proteins with specific antibodies. The percentages of HCoV-NL63-infected cells were measured by flow cytometry. Wild-type APOBEC3 proteins resulted in pronounced reductions in HCoV-NL63 infection rates, whereas catalytically inactive proteins produced moderate inhibition, with infection rates that were not significantly different from those in controls (Fig. 4a). Western blot analysis showed an even expression of all proteins, showing that the inhibitory effect did not result from unequal mRNA translation (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Figure 2). This level of inhibition of HCoV-NL63 replication by catalytically inactive proteins required transfection of 3 \u00b5g of mRNA, whereas for active proteins, inhibition was achieved with transfection of 1 \u00b5g of mRNA.\n\nNext, we tested the activity of APOBEC3 proteins in vitro. A DNA template containing several possible sites for cytidine deamination (GC-rich domains) was used for in vitro transcription, producing RNA that was incubated with lysates from 293T cells overexpressing A3C protein or GFP. The RNA was then isolated, reverse transcribed, amplified by PCR and sequenced, revealing several C \u2192 C/T changes following incubation with A3C (but not GFP) cell lysate (Fig. 4c). However, hypermutation did not occur, and no pattern was identified in the nucleotide changes.\n\nTo examine the progressive accumulation of mutations, we performed a series of virus passages on cells expressing A3C, A3F or A3H. Notably, after the first passage, the inhibitory effect of the three APOBECs diminished, and no decline in virus yield was seen (data not shown). Cell-culture supernatants were collected after four passages of HCoV-NL63, and several regions of the viral RNA genome were sequenced. Point mutations (G \u2192 A or C \u2192 T) were identified in the genes encoding the 1ab polyprotein and spike protein in virus passaged in APOBEC3-expressing cells, but not in wild-type cells. These mutations were not specific to virus collected from cells expressing A3C, A3F or A3H, but were also identified in virus passaged in cells expressing A3A, ADE or A3G.\n\nTo identify whether APOBEC3 protein were capable of inducing hypermutation, we used a recombinant GC-rich HCoV-229E virus (ic229E-GC), into which we had introduced silent mutations (either A \u2192 G or T \u2192 C) in the A/T-rich region of nsp6, resulting in a potential \u2018hot-spot\u2019 for cytidine deamination. The virus was propagated and titrated to determine the 50% tissue-culture infective dose (TCID50) in naturally permissive Huh-7 cells. The effectiveness of mRNA transfection in Huh-7 cells was confirmed by detection of green fluorescence in cells transfected with GFP mRNA. Huh-7 cells were then transfected with mRNA encoding an APOBEC3 protein, infected with ic229E-GC at 400 TCID50 per ml and cultured for 5 days. Pronounced inhibition of viral infection occurred in cells expressing A3C, A3F or A3H (data not shown). After four passages of ic229E-GC, viral RNA was sequenced. No G \u2192 A or C \u2192 T mutations were identified within the GC-rich region in any of the samples. However, ic229E-GC passaged in cells expressing A3F protein showed considerable sequence heterogeneity, compared with passaged in GFP-positive cells, indicating a possible A3F deaminase activity (Fig. 4d).\n\nOur results demonstrated that, although cytidine deamination was involved in inhibition of coronavirus by APOBEC3 proteins, deaminase mutants retained some anti-coronaviral activity, suggesting that an additional mechanism may be involved in APOBEC3-mediated coronavirus restriction. We therefore analysed the interactions between APOBEC3 proteins (A3C, A3F and A3H) and HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein (HCoV-NL63-N), which is the most abundant viral structural protein. Human 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA constructs for expression of individual HA-tagged APOBEC3 proteins (or their catalytically inactive derivatives) or GFP. Cell lysates containing the expressed proteins were incubated with purified HCoV-NL63-N, and protein complexes were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-HA-tag resin. Western-blot analysis demonstrated co-immunoprecipitation of HCoV-NL63-N with A3C, A3F and A3H, whereas no HCoV-NL63-N could be detected in samples incubated with GFP lysate. Notably, the catalytically inactive derivatives of A3C, A3F and A3H also bound to HCoV-NL63-N protein (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Figure 3). On the other hand, we could not observe the same effect with other APOBEC3 proteins (A3A, A3D and A3G).\n\nCo-localisation of A3C with HCoV-NL63-N was investigated by co-transfection of LLC-Mk2 cells with mRNAs encoding A3C and HCoV-NL63-N, followed by immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. The analysis showed several clearly visible foci of co-localisation (Fig. 5b). Calculation of Manders\u2019 coefficient gave a value of 0.459, indicating the existence of an interaction between the two proteins.\n\nAPOBEC3-mediated cytidine deamination has been described as an interim antiviral mechanism. Although APOBEC3 proteins were initially shown to primarily modify DNA templates, it has subsequently been demonstrated that they also use RNA as a substrate. The finding that APOBEC3 deaminases can mutate the HIV RNA genome first expanded their possible specificity16. Thereafter, it was shown that A3G impairs the replication of mumps, measles and respiratory syncytial viruses. This antiviral activity is not an effect of APOBEC3 enzymatic activity, but is thought to result from the interaction of A3G with viral transcripts18. A3A has been shown to act as a mRNA-editing factor in human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages17. However, APOBEC3-mediated deamination of viral RNA genomes has not previously been demonstrated for viruses that do not replicate through DNA intermediates. Here, we investigated the antiviral effects of APOBEC3 proteins on human coronaviruses. HCoV-NL63 was selected as the model pathogen because of its prominent bias in nucleotide composition (low GC content), suggesting the possible shaping of the genome by cytidine deamination.\n\nWe studied the interaction between HCoV and HAE cultures, as an in vitro model of the human airways, the primary entry site for human respiratory viruses. mRNA levels of genes encoding A3A, A3C and A3D were upregulated in HCoV-NL63-infected cultures. Upregulation of APOBEC3 protein expression was previously shown to be dependent on interferon alpha, and it is associated with non-cytolytic clearance of human hepatitis B virus in primary hepatocytes32. Cytoplasmic DNA triggers production of type I interferon, leading to massive upregulation of APOBEC3A33,34. Here, we investigated the effects of different APOBEC3 proteins, and found that expression of A3C, A3F or A3H limits coronavirus infection. Notably, some infectious progeny were produced in the presence of these proteins, and serial passaging of virus was possible. Surprisingly, if cells overexpressing A3C, A3F or A3H were infected with the progeny virions, no restriction of virus replication occurred. Possible explanations for this effect are that the first viral passage results in selection of viral subspecies that are not affected by APOBEC3 activities, or that viral passage activates a viral factor or mechanism that can counteract APOBEC3 activities.\n\nSerial passage of HCoV in APOBEC3-expressing cells did not result in hypermutation in progeny viruses. It is possible that HCoV-NL63 has reached a maximum level of AT content, so that new C \u2192 T or G \u2192 A changes in the genome result in a drastic drop in viral infectivity. However, incubation of an RNA transcript containing potential deaminase hot-spots17 with A3C-enriched cell lysates did not result in hypermutation.\n\nThe lack of hypermutation might have resulted from limited accessibility of the template or instability of A3C in the lysate. We were not able to develop a HCoV-NL63 molecular clone containing GC-rich elements, most likely because of low stability of the reverse genetics system for this virus (data not shown). We therefore developed a HCoV-229E clone containing a GC-rich region35,36. Replication of this virus was inhibited in cells expressing A3C, A3F or A3H, but no mutations were observed in the modified region. The lack of observed hypermutation may result from proofreading and repair of the coronavirus RNA genome37, and suggests that inhibition of coronaviral replication by APOBEC3 proteins does not result from deamination of viral RNA.\n\nIt was previously shown that, for some RNA viruses, APOBEC-mediated inhibition is deamination-independent. In our system, catalytically inactive A3C, A3F and A3H proteins only had marginal inhibitory effect on virus replication. We suggest that APOBEC3 proteins may affect coronavirus replication by two mechanisms: first, by deamination of yet unidentified cellular targets or deamination of single sites in the coronaviral genome; and second, by direct, non-catalytic interaction with viral RNA and/or proteins. APOBEC proteins may interact with the coronaviral N protein, which is an essential structural protein for formation of the viral ribonucleocapsid, and which also has a role in virus replication38\u201342. Our results demonstrated that all APOBEC3 proteins with inhibitory activity bound to the N protein. The direct, editing-independent mechanism by which APOBEC3 proteins inhibit HCoV-NL63 replication is still to be elucidated, but it is possible that interaction with the N protein interferes with virus replication and progeny production.\n\nIn conclusion, our results show that three APOBEC3 proteins (A3C, A3F and A3H) inhibit coronaviral replication. The molecular mechanism of deaminase-dependent inhibition of coronavirus replication remains elusive and may depend on deamination of single sites in the coronaviral genome, or in a cellular target or targets. Passage of HCoV-NL63 in cells expressing APOBEC3 proteins results in virus that is resistant to APOBEC-mediated inhibition, possibly indicating the presence of an unidentified factor that counteracts APOBEC3 activity. The deaminase-independent component of viral inhibition may result from interaction between viral N protein and APOBEC3 proteins.\n\nLLC-Mk2 cells (Macaca mulatta epithelial kidney cells; ATCC: CCL-7) were cultured in H/E MEM (Hanks\u2019 MEM: Earle\u2019s MEM, 2:1 ratio; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland) with 3% fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland) and antibiotics: penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml), and ciprofloxacin (5 \u03bcg/ml). Human hepatocellular carcinoma Huh-7 (kindly provided by dr Lia van der Hoek, UvA, The Netherlands) and 293T (ATCC: CRL-3216; kidney epithelial) cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland) with 10% fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland) and antibiotics: penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml), and ciprofloxacin (5 \u03bcg/ml). Cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2.\n\nHuman epithelial cells were isolated from conductive airways resected from transplant patients. The study was approved by the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland (approval no: KNW/0022/KB1/17/10 dated on 16.02.2010). A written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Tissues were procured at the Silesian Center for Heart Diseases, Zabrze, Poland. No organs/tissues were procured from prisoners. Cells were dislodged by protease treatment, and later mechanically detached from the connective tissue. Resulting primary cells were first cultured in selective media to proliferate. Further, cells were trypsinised and transferred onto permeable Transwell insert supports (\u03d5 = 6.5). Cell differentiation was stimulated by media additives and removal of media from the apical side. In such a manner cells were cultured for 6\u20138 weeks to form well-differentiated, pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium43. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.\n\nFor the virus infection, HAE cultures were washed thrice with 100 \u03bcl of 1 \u00d7 PBS, following inoculation with HCoV-NL63 (isolate Amsterdam 1) or influenza A virus (IVA, strain H3N2) or mock (cell lysate). After 2 h incubation at 32\u00b0 (for HCoV-NL63) or 37 \u00b0C (for IVA) unbound virions were removed by washing with 100 \u03bcl of 1 \u00d7 PBS and HAE cultures were cultured at an air - liquid interphase until the end of the experiment.\n\nThe stock of HCoV-NL63 (isolate Amsterdam 1) was prepared using LLC-Mk2 cells. Six days post-infection (p.i.) infected cells were lysed by freeze-thawing and the resulting supernatant was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Mock sample was prepared in the same manner, from non-infected cells. Virus yield was determined according to the method described by Reed and Muench44. Briefly, cells infected with serially diluted virus were incubated at 32 \u00b0C for 6 days and the appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored.\n\nViral DNA/RNA Kit (A&A Biotechnology, Poland) was used for nucleic acid isolation from cell culture supernatants, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cellular RNA was isolated using Fenozol reagent (A&A Biotechnology, Poland), followed by DNase I treatment (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland). cDNA samples were prepared with a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nRecombinant HCoV-229E containing a GC-rich region was generated using the vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system as described previously36,45. In short, vaccinia virus containing the full-length HCoV-229E cDNA in which an Escherichia coli guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (GPT) was inserted between HCoV-229E 10098 and 10930 nucleotides was used to recombine with a plasmid containing HCoV-229E 9398\u201311580 nucleotides with a number of silent mutations (GC-rich region)46. The resulting vaccinia virus was used to rescue the mutant HCoV-229E, as described previously36,45. Plasmid DNA, recombinant vaccinia virus and recombinant HCoV-229E identities were confirmed by sequencing.\n\nRNA yields were assessed using real-time PCR (7500 Fast Real-Time PCR; Life Technologies, Poland). HCoV-NL63 cDNA was amplified in a reaction mixture containing 1 \u00d7 TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland), in the presence of FAM/TAMRA (6-carboxyfluorescein/6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) probe (100 nM specific) and primers (450 nM each)47. Reaction was carried out according to the scheme: 2 min at 50 \u00b0C and 10 min at 92 \u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 92 \u00b0C and 1 min at 60 \u00b0C. Cellular cDNA was amplified in a reaction mixture containing 1 \u00d7 SYBRGreen Ready PCR Master Mix (Sigma-Aldrich, Poland) in the presence of primers (500 nM each). TATA-box binding protein gene (TBP) was used as a household gene control and Rox was used as the reference dye. Primer sequences are provided in Table 1. Reaction was carried out according to the scheme: 10 min at 50 \u00b0C and 5 min at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 sec at 95 \u00b0C, 30 sec at 56 \u00b0C and 45 sec at 75 \u00b0C. In order to assess the copy number for each gene, DNA standards were prepared, as described before47.\n\nLLC-Mk2 cells cultured in 6-well plate format (TPP) were washed with sterile 1 \u00d7 PBS, trypsinised, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1 \u00d7 PBS and incubated for 1 h with blocking buffer (10% BSA in 1 \u00d7 PBS with 0.5% Tween 20).\n\nTo visualise HA-tagged APOBEC3 proteins after mRNA transfection, cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with mouse anti-HA-tag antibody (1 \u03bcg/ml, Antibodies-online, Germany) in 1 \u00d7 PBS with 3% BSA and 0.5% Tween 20, followed by 1 h incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (2.5 \u03bcg/ml, Molecular Probes, Poland).\n\nTo evaluate HCoV-NL63 infection using flow cytometry, cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with mouse anti-HCoV-NL63-N antibody (1 \u03bcg/ml, Ingenansa, Spain) in 1 \u00d7 PBS with 3% BSA and 0.5% Tween 20, followed by 1 h incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (2.5 \u03bcg/ml, Molecular Probes, Poland). Cells were then washed, re-suspended in 1 \u00d7 PBS and analysed with FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson, USA) using Cell Quest software.\n\nSequence verified, C-terminal HA-tagged pTracer CMV2 plasmids (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland) encoding human A3A (GeneBank accession number (GB) NM_145699), A3C (GB: NM_014508), A3DE (GB: NM_152426), A3F (GB: NM_145298), APOBEC3G (GB: NM_021822) and A3H (GB: NM_181773) were prepared. Catalytic mutants of A3C (A3C_E68Q = mA3C), A3F (A3F_E251Q = mA3F) and A3H (A3H_E56Q = mA3H) were prepared using Quick Change mutagenesis with Phusion polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland)48. Sequences of oligonucleotides used are listed in Table 2.\n\nPlasmid construct containing several GC-rich domains was ordered at GeneArt Gene Synthesis (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany). The region was sequenced with primers 5\u2032-CTG TGG AAA ACC TTT GGC ATC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTG TGG AAA ACC TTT GGC ATC-3\u2032. The plasmid was amplified in E. coli TOP10 strain and further used as a template in in vitro transcription reaction using T7 promoter, as described below.\n\nAPOBEC3 plasmids described above were used as templates for amplification of APOBEC3 genes with forward primer containing the T7 promoter region (5\u2032-TCG GCC TCG TAG GCC TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA GAC TGA GAG AAC CCA CTG CTT AC-3\u2032) and specific reverse primer (listed in Table 2, 500 nM each). Reaction was carried out with Phusion polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA templates were purified using GeneJET PCR Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland) and further used for in vitro transcription with T7 RiboMAX Express Large Scale RNA Production System and Ribo m7G Cap Analog (Promega, Poland). Resulting RNA was precipitated with LiCl, purified with 70% ethanol and polyadenylated using Poly(A) Tailing Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA was then precipitated with lithium chloride (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland) and its concentration was assessed using a spectrophotometer.\n\n293T cells were seeded on 10 cm2 dishes, cultured for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 and transfected with 8 \u00b5g of plasmid per dish using polyethylenimine (Sigma-Aldrich, Poland). LLC-Mk2 and Huh-7 cells were seeded on 6-wells plates (TPP, Switzerland), cultured for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 and transfected with 3 \u00b5g mRNA per well (transcripts encoding APOBEC3 proteins or control GFP) using TransIT mRNA Transfection Reagent (Mirus, USA). Efficiency of transfection was assessed 24 h post-transfection in GFP-transfected cells using EVOS fluorescent microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland).\n\nCells were trypsinised, centrifuged and resuspended in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5) followed by lysis in RIPA buffer for 30 min on ice. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged (10 min at 12,000 \u00d7 g) and the pelleted cell debris was discarded. Resulting supernatants were mixed with sample buffer (0.5 M Tris pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50 mg/ml DTT), boiled for 5 min, cooled on ice, and separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels alongside dual color Page Ruler Pre-stained Protein size markers (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland). The separated proteins were then transferred onto a Westran S PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare, Poland) by wet blotting (Bio-Rad, Poland) for 1 h, 100 Volts in transfer buffer: 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol at 4 \u00b0C. The membranes were then blocked by overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C in TBS-Tween (0.1%) buffer supplemented with 5% skimmed milk (BioShop, Canada). A rabbit anti-HA Taq antibody (1 \u03bcg/ml; Antibodies-online, USA) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (0.35 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Poland) were used to detect the HA-tagged APOBEC3 proteins in cell lysates. Mouse anti-HCoV-NL63-N protein antibody (500 ng/ml; Ingenansa, Spain) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (65 ng/ml; Dako, Denmark) were used to detect the HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein. A rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody (1:5000 dilution; Cell Signalling Technology, Poland) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (0.35 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Poland) were used to detect the GAPDH in cell lysates. All antibodies were diluted in 1% skimmed milk/TBS-Tween (0.1%). The signal was developed using the Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, USA) and visualised by exposing the membrane to an X-ray film (Kodak, Poland).\n\nAPOBEC3-expressing and control 293T cells were harvested 3 days post transfection in deaminase activity buffer, containing 0.2% Surfact-Amps NP-40 (Sigma-Aldrich, Poland), 30 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine-ethane-sulfonic acid (HEPES; pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 25 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 \u00d7 Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, and 10% glycerol17. Samples were centrifuged (10 min at 12,000 \u00d7 g), pelleted cell debris was discarded and resulting supernatants were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. HCoV-NL63 N protein was prepared as described previously39. Cell lysates were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C with the purified N protein in 1 \u00d7 activity buffer, containing 100 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 \u00b5M ZnCl2, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA17. Subsequently, 15 \u00b5l of agarose spheres coated with anti-HA antibodies (Pierce, Poland) was added and samples were loaded onto co-immunoprecipitation columns. After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C on a rotary shaker, proteins were eluted, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nLLC-Mk2 cells were seeded on 6-wells plates and cultured for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. 1.5 \u03bcg of HCoV-NL63 N mRNA and 1.5 \u03bcg of A3C mRNA was co-transfected using the mRNA-In reagent (AMS Biotechnology, United Kingdom). After 72 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1 \u00d7 PBS and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with 10% BSA in 1 \u00d7 PBS with 0.5% Tween 20. To visualise HCoV-NL63 N molecules, cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-HCoV-NL63-N serum (1:100 dilution, kindly provided by dr Lia van der Hoek, UvA, The Netherlands) in 1 \u00d7 PBS with 3% BSA and 0.5% Tween 20, followed by 1 h incubation with Atto 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (5 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Poland). To detect HA-tagged A3C protein cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with mouse Alexa Fluor 647-labeled anti-HA-tag antibody (10 \u03bcg/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific; Poland) in 1 \u00d7 PBS with 3% BSA and 0.5% Tween 20. Nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI (0.1 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Poland). Immunostained cultures were mounted on glass slides with ProLong Gold antifade medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Poland). Fluorescent images were acquired under a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH). Images were acquired using ZEN 2012 SP1 software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH) and processed using ImageJ 1.47 v (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).\n\nAll the experiments were performed in triplicate and the results are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Student\u2019s t-test was used to determine significance of the obtained results. P values < 0.05 were considered significant."}
