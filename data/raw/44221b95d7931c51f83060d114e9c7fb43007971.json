Production of IFN-g and TNF-a did not differ from values observed in the control group, and titers of sIL-2R were not increased in the patient group either. Additionally, MS patients with stable disease showed a 1 significantly lower number of CD8 T-cells.\n\nIn previous publications, low IFN responses to various viral antigens have occasionally been described for MS patients (Neighbour et al., 1981; Salonen et al., 1982) . of the disease activity.
