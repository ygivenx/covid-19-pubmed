{"title": "Highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 by digital PCR", "body": "However, RT-qPCR is reported to have issues of low positive rates for throat swab samples (5) and there were 3% of patients who had negative RT-qPCR test results at initial presentation while chest CT checks indicated typical symptoms of viral pneumonia(6). In order to identify and hospitalize COVID-19 patients in time, more sensitive and accurate tests are required.\n\nDigital PCR (dPCR) is a technology which partitions nucleic acid molecules across a large number of smaller reactions and acquires amplification data of each partition at end point based on the intensity of fluorescence (7-9). Quantification is performed by applying Poisson statistics to the proportion of the negative partitions to account for positive partitions that initially contained more than one target molecule. dPCR can offer greater precision than qPCR and is far simpler to use for copy number quantification due the binary nature in which the partitions are counted as positive or negative. Additionally, dPCR is more tolerant of PCR inhibition compared with qPCR due to partitioning and because it is an end-point PCR measurement and consequently less dependent on high PCR efficiency (10, 11) .\n\nwere provided by BJCDC. Extracted RNA was stored at -80 .\n\nThe primer and probe sequences for detecting N and ORF1ab gene target of the SARS-CoV-2 published by Chinese CDC were used for this study (12) . for 30 sec. The cycled plate was then transferred to the QX200 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using the QuantaSoft droplet reader software (V1.7.4, Bio-Rad).

Briefly, a 25-\u03bcL reaction containing 7.5 \u03bc L of PCR reaction buffer, 5 \u00b5L of primer and probe mixture and 5~11 \u03bc L of RNA was prepared. Thermal cycling was performed at 50 \u00b0C for 15 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95\u00b0C for 5 min and then 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 55 \u00b0C for 45 s in ABI 7500 RT-PCR thermocycler. Data analysis was performed using software of ABI 7500 RT-PCR thermocycler.\n\nThe linear range was investigated by varying the mean copy number per droplet, denoted as \u03bb (16). The precision or relative error of RT-dPCR is related to \u03bb gene assay. To determine the lower limit of all three assays, serial dilutions of each RNA transcript were prepared (Supplemental Table 1 ). The measured targets matched the anticipated values in each tested interval. A good linearity (0.93<slope<1.02, R 2 \u2265 0.9997) between the measured RNA target and the prepared value was observed over the range from approximately 10 4 to 10 0 copies/reaction (Fig. 1 ). Reactions containing a mean of 60 E, 66 N or 11 ORF1ab copies fulfilled the criterion for an LoQ with a CV lower than 25%.\n\nSixty blank measurements obtained from 3 blank samples were analyzed to determine the LoB. As the distribution of the 60 blank measurements is skewed (Supplemental Table 2 . The 95th percentile corresponds to the 57.5 ordered observation (=60*(0.95/60+0.5))(15). Linear interpolation between the 57th and 58th observation yields a LoB estimate of 1.6, 1.6, and 0.8 copies/reaction for E, ORF1ab and N, respectively.\n\nFor determining the LoD of ORF1ab gene assay, 76 measurements were performed on five samples in 3 different runs on three different days to ensure the total assay variation is reflected. The distribution of the 76 measurement results from low concentration samples is not Gaussian (Supplemental Fig. 2A ) and so that All rights reserved.

Consequently, the LoD is determined to be 2 copies/reaction, the lowest level material where the \u03b2 -percentile is 5 %.\n\nTo determine the LoD of N and E assay, 83 measurements of E assay on 5 samples and 71 measurements of N assay on 4 samples were performed in 4 different runs. Similar to ORF1ab gene, the distribution of the 71 measurements for N gene and 83 measurements are not Gaussian (Supplemental Fig. 2B and 2C ), and so that nonparametric statistics was used. Consequently, the LoD is determined to be 2 copies/ reaction.\n\nThe Specificity of the assays for ORF1ab and E gene has been tested in a previous report (13). To further validate the specificity of all assays, Influenza virus and other human coronavirus were collected. All assays were tested on human clinical nucleic acid samples at National institute of Metrology, China. All tests returned negative results (see Supplemental Table 3 ).\n\n103 pharyngeal swabs were collected from febrile suspected SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and the relevant information is listed in Table 1 .

Firstly, the criteria claimed by the H&R kit author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . determined to be SARS-CoV-2 positive based on parallel test with a commercial kit and Chinese CDC assays. Therefore, these 15 samples were reported positive by BJCDC. 8 qPCR negatives for ORF1ab were positive tested by RT-dPCR, showing high sensitivity for ORF1ab by RT-dPCR. Only 3 negatives for ORF1ab which can be complemented by E gene targets.\n\nAmong the 103 specimens, 29 positive, 25 negative and 49 suspected were reported by RT-qPCR. However, 61 samples including 17 negative and 44 suspected tested by qPCR were confirmed to be positive by RT-dPCR, thus 90 patients in total whose SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid were positive tested can be diagnosed with COVID-19. All the 103 patients were confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection according to a follow-up survey. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% to 87.4% for the 103 patients ( Fig. 2A and 2B ).\n\n75 specimens were collected from contacts and close contacts. 48 specimens from contacts were reported negative based RT-qPCR test by BJCDC on Feb 6 and were confirmed by RT-dPCR on Feb 7 in Supplemental Table 4 . According to a follow-up survey, all of them were in good health and isolation was lifted after 14 days.\n\ndetect the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids due the low viral load at the early stage for the close contacts. However, 15 out of 16 equivocal and one negative can be determined positive by RT-dPCR. The suspect rate was significantly decreased from 21% down to 1% according to the detection of RT-dPCR. Consequently, except 6 patients can not be tracked, the rest 10 RT-dPCR positive were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infected patients based on a follow-up survey.\n\nFurthermore, among the 16 specimens corrected by RT-dPCR, 6 persons (P14,18-21and P23 in Supplemental Table 5 ) were directed for secondary testing following an initial negative test 2 to 10 days prior. Based on RT-qPCR results, further isolation and observation was still needed to be conducted as the testing result is suspect or negative and no clinical symptoms were observed for them. However, if based on RT-dPCR, all the six patients can be diagnosed with COVD-19 infected by SARS-CoV-2 and treatment could be conducted earlier. This indicates RT-dPCR is more sensitive and suitable for low viral load specimens from the patients under isolation and observation without clinical symptoms, which is in agreement with the very recent online report (18).\n\nAdditionally, 16 pharyngeal swabs were collected from convalescent patients (Table 3) . 12 positive, 3 suspect and 1 negative were reported by qPCR. However, all of these 16 patients are diagnosed to be positive by RT-dPCR, indicating that all of them still need to be observed in hospital. Regardless the sampling time, correlation between age and the RNA virus copy number was analyzed (Fig.3) . Interestingly, confirmatory method is of particular importance for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in this outbreak.\n\nCurrently, besides RT-qPCR, other methods such as next generation sequencing The overall sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-qPCR in our study were 36% and 53%, respectively, according to our follow-up survey on the 188 samples(6 out of 194 can not be tracked). The RT-qPCR sensitivity is in agreement with the previous report for the throat swab samples (5). However, both sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR dramatically increased to 90 % and 93%, respectively. Furthermore, it is very sensitive for the very low viral load in close contacts and suitable for monitoring the change of the viral load in the convalescent patients. An additional advantage of quantification of SARS-CoV-2 copy number by RT-dPCR is that comparisons can be conducted between different dates and different laboratories as absolute quantitation of targets by RT-dPCR provides high concordance between All rights reserved.

However, it is not possible to compare Ct values on different runs or different machines. Thus, RT-dPCR is an ideal method to for measuring the change of virus load in the convalescent patients.\n\nThis work demonstrates that RT-dPCR significantly improves accuracy and reduces the false negative rate of diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2, which could be a powerful complement to the current RT-qPCR. Furthermore, RT-dPCR is more sensitive and suitable for low virus load specimens from the patients under isolation and observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms.\n\nSupplemental material is available. \n\nAll rights reserved.
