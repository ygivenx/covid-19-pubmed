{"title": "The impact of rapid molecular diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses on outcomes for emergency department patients", "body": "The health and economic burdens associated with acute respiratory infections by influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) are significant in Australia and overseas.1, 2, 3 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is effective for confirming respiratory viral infections.4 Multiplex PCR can detect numerous respiratory viruses, including influenza and parainfluenza viruses, RSV, adenovirus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus, bocavirus and coronavirus with very high sensitivity and specificity.5 Although the results of standard multiplex PCR are accurate and comprehensive, it has traditionally been performed in a central laboratory with a lengthy turnaround time, which may be inconvenient in settings where test results are urgently required, including emergency departments (EDs).\n\nRapid, easy\u2010to\u2010use PCR\u2010based respiratory virus diagnostic tests have been introduced in recent years;6, 7 the GeneXpert system (Cepheid), for instance, was introduced in New South Wales in July 2017. Rapid PCR tests were expected to facilitate timely and appropriate initiation of treatment, improve outbreak prevention and infection control measures, and expedite the assessment of patients in EDs.\n\nIn this study, we analysed routinely collected data to determine whether rapid PCR testing for influenza and RSV infections in EDs is associated with improved patient and laboratory outcomes. We compared data for patients tested for influenza A/B viruses and RSV immediately after rapid PCR diagnosis was introduced (July\u2013December 2017) with data for patients tested with a standard multiplex PCR system during July\u2013December 2016.\n\nWe undertook a before\u2010and\u2010after study in four metropolitan public hospital EDs in Sydney, NSW: three general hospitals (EDs A, B and C; 76 228, 54 443 and 50 025 annual ED presentations respectively) and one children's hospital (ED D; 36 700 annual ED presentations; all data for January\u2013December 20168). The four hospitals were served by a single pathology laboratory provider.\n\nWe analysed data for all patients tested for influenza virus or RSV. During July\u2013December 2016, patients were tested with the standard PCR system, a central laboratory\u2010based multiplex PCR test for sixteen respiratory viruses (including RSV and influenza viruses A and B), available as a referral test at the central laboratory in Hospital B. During July\u2013December 2017, patients were tested with the rapid PCR system, a hospital laboratory\u2010based test specific for RSV and influenza viruses A and B. Hospitals A, B and D have onsite laboratories that perform rapid PCR testing; Hospital C sends samples to the nearby Hospital A.\n\nAll tests were conducted in virology laboratories by trained staff, and test results were entered into laboratory information system datasets. We obtained relevant patient characteristics and laboratory data by linking the ED and laboratory information system datasets. Detailed information about the datasets and the linkage process have been described previously.9\n\n\nThe primary outcomes were admission to hospital, ED length of stay (LOS), test turnaround time, and the patient receiving their test result before leaving the ED. ED LOS was defined as the time from arrival in the ED to discharge or admission to hospital. Turnaround was defined as the time from when the sample was received by the laboratory to when the test result was available in hospital electronic records. As secondary outcomes, we compared ordering of typical biochemistry and haematology tests (full blood count; electrolyte, urea, creatinine levels; liver function test; blood gas analysis; C\u2010reactive protein level) and microbiology tests (blood culture; urine microscopy, culture and sensitivity analysis; sputum culture; respiratory bacteria and virus serology) during the two study periods.\n\nAnalyses were conducted in Stata 15 (StataCorp). Descriptive statistics are reported (medians with interquartile ranges [IQRs], means with standard deviations [SDs], numbers with proportions). Baseline characteristics were compared in \u03c7\n2 tests (categorical outcomes) or Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum tests (continuous outcomes). Logistic regression analyses of binary outcomes (eg, hospital admission: yes/no) and quantile regression analyses of continuous outcomes (eg, ED LOS) were undertaken. All analyses were adjusted for baseline characteristics.\n\nSensitivity analyses limited to data for children (under 18 years of age) or older patients (over 60 years of age) were conducted. P < 0.05 (2\u2010tailed) was deemed statistically significant.\n\nEthics approval for the investigation was granted by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District (reference, HREC/16/POWH/412).\n\nWe analysed data for 3741 patients presenting to the four EDs during two periods: 1491 consecutive patients during July\u2013December 2016 (standard PCR) and 2250 during July\u2013December 2017 (rapid PCR). Baseline characteristics for the two groups were similar in terms of sex, triage category, and arrival day of the week, but differed significantly for age, arrival time, and mode of arrival (Box 1). Among those tested by rapid PCR, supplementary standard PCR tests were ordered for 133 patients (5.9%), and standard PCR tests for respiratory viruses other than influenza viruses A/B and RSV were requested for a further 320 patients (14.2%).\n\nA total of 134 people in the standard PCR group (9.0%) were positive for influenza A/B (37 patients), RSV (96 patients), or both (one patient); a further 333 people (22.3%) were positive for at least one other respiratory virus (but not influenza A/B or RSV). Of the patients in the rapid PCR group, 790 (35.1%) were positive for influenza A/B (732 patients), RSV (56 patients), or both (two patients). In the children's hospital (ED D), 53 children in the standard PCR group (18%) were positive for RSV (49 children) or influenza A/B (five children); a further 144 (48%) were positive for at least one other respiratory virus. Of those tested by rapid PCR, 54 children (35%) were positive for influenza A/B (46 children) or RSV (eight children).\n\nA smaller proportion of patients tested by rapid PCR were admitted to hospital (73.3% v 77.7%; P < 0.001 after controlling for baseline characteristics) and a larger proportion received their test result before leaving the ED (67.4% v 1.3%, P < 0.001) than of patients tested by standard PCR. The median turnaround for rapid PCR tests was shorter (rapid PCR, 2.4 h [IQR, 1.6\u20133.9 h]; normal PCR, 26.7 h [IQR, 21.2\u201337.8 h]), but the median ED LOS was similar for the two groups (rapid PCR, 7.4 h [IQR, 5.0\u201312.9 h]; normal PCR, 6.5 h [IQR, 4.2\u201311.9 h]; P = 0.27) (Box 2).\n\nAmong patients with positive test results, 105 patients tested by standard PCR (78.4%; 95% CI, 70.4\u201385.0%) and 532 patients tested by rapid PCR (67.3%; 95% CI, 63.9\u201378.6%) were admitted to hospital (after adjusting for baseline characteristics: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.0; 95% CI, 2.3\u20136.8). For patients with negative results, 1054 people tested by standard PCR (77.7%; 95% CI, 75.4\u201379.9%) and 1117 of those tested by rapid PCR (76.5%; 95% CI, 74.2\u201378.7%) were admitted to hospital (after adjusting for baseline characteristics: aOR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2\u20131.8) (Box 3).\n\nThe overall numbers of tests per patient were similar in the standard PCR (mean, 7.2 tests; SD, 3.8) and rapid PCR groups (mean, 7.1 tests; SD, 3.4). The mean number of microbiology tests per patient was significantly lower for the rapid PCR group (1.5 tests; SD, 1.8) than for the standard PCR group (2.0 tests; SD, 2.1; P < 0.001 after controlling for baseline characteristics).\n\nThe 16 265 biochemistry/haematology and microbiology tests comprised 71.1% of the 22 876 other tests (that is, not including PCR virus testing) ordered for patients in the study. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, the proportions of patients for whom full blood count, electrolyte/urea/creatinine levels, liver function, or C\u2010reactive protein were assessed were similar, as were the proportions for urine microscopy, culture and sensitivity tests. Significantly fewer blood culture, blood gas, sputum culture, and respiratory bacterial and viral serology tests were ordered for patients in the rapid PCR group (Box 4).\n\nOf the 452 patients under 18 years of age in the standard PCR group, 301 (66.6%; 95% CI, 62.0\u201370.9%) were admitted to hospital, as were 158 of the 312 children (50.6%; 95% CI, 44.9\u201356.3%) in the rapid PCR group (standard v rapid PCR: aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3\u20132.4). Of the 670 patients over 60 years of age in the standard PCR group, 615 (91.8%; 95%, 89.4\u201393.8%) were admitted to hospital, as were 1167 of the 1384 patients of this age (84.3%; 95% CI, 82.3\u201386.2%) in the rapid PCR group (standard v rapid PCR: aOR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.5\u20132.9) (Supporting Information, figure 1).\n\nED LOS was similar for the standard PCR and rapid PCR groups in both age\u2010based subgroups (Supporting Information, figure 2A). The differences in test turnaround time identified in the main analysis were also evident for each age\u2010based subgroup (Supporting Information, figure 2B).\n\nThe strengths of our study include its relatively large sample size; further, unlike many similar investigations, ours was a multicentre study in four hospital EDs, enhancing the generalisability of our findings. However, our analyses were not adjusted for comorbid conditions, as this information was not available. Because our study was an uncontrolled before\u2010and\u2010after study, our results cannot be interpreted as indicating causal relationships. As with all non\u2010randomised trials, we could not fully account for all potential confounding variables, nor for temporal trends and other unmeasured factors, such as changes in clinician testing practices or differences in the prevalence and severity of disease during the two study periods.22 For example, a shortage of inpatient beds caused by a high prevalence of influenza could influence decisions in a busy ED about admitting patients to hospital. However, we attempted to reduce seasonal effects by selecting similar time frames for the two study periods, to reduce selection bias by including all ED patients tested for influenza virus and RSV, and to control for differences in baseline patient characteristics by applying multivariate modelling. As medications data were not available to us, we were unable to assess the impact of rapid PCR testing on antibiotic and antiviral drug use. Similarly, the cost\u2013benefit balance of rapid testing was not evaluated because relevant data were not available. The cost per patient of rapid PCR testing is generally higher than for central laboratory testing, but our findings suggest potential savings through lower numbers of hospital admissions and reduced resource use. This question could be evaluated in a further study.\n\nRapid PCR testing for influenza virus and RSV infections in patients attending EDs was associated with significant improvements in a range of patient and laboratory outcomes, suggesting potential benefits for both the patients and the health care system. A cost\u2013benefit analysis could examine the impact of rapid PCR testing on bed management and antimicrobial drug prescribing.\n\nNo relevant disclosures."}
