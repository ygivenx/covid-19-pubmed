These data suggest that the increased replication of P250 173 viruses relative to WT-MHV is not fully accounted for by increased RNA synthesis. In addition 174 to RNA synthesis defects, ExoN(-) CoVs have up-to 20-fold increased mutation frequencies and 175 profoundly increased sensitivity to nucleoside and base analogs relative to WT CoVs (13, 14, 16, 176 17, 38). To determine whether nucleoside analog sensitivity of MHV-ExoN(-) was altered by 177 long-term passage, we treated cells infected with parental and passaged viruses with the base 178 analog, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU is converted intracellularly into a nucleoside analog that 179 incorporates into growing RNA strands and causes A:G and U:C mutations. For simplicity, we 180 hereafter refer to 5-FU as a nucleoside analog. Incorporation of 5-FU is increased in the absence 181 of ExoN activity (16). All viruses displayed a concentration-dependent decrease in viral titer but 182 differed greatly in their susceptibility to 5-FU (Fig. 4C ). At 120\u00b5M, WT-MHV P3 titers were 183 reduced by ~1 log 10 , while MHV-ExoN(-) P3 titers were undetectable (> 5 log 10 -fold reduction). 184\n\nWT-MHV 5-FU sensitivity was not altered by passage. MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was less susceptible 185 than MHV-ExoN(-) P3 to 5-FU treatment, with only a ~1.5 log 10 decrease in titer at 120 \u00b5M. replication cycles in which 5-FU can be incorporated (59) . MHV-ExoN(-) P250 had multiple 193 mutations in the spike glycoprotein, including one in the spike furin cleavage site that reduced 194 syncytia formation. To test whether the spike mutations manifested in resistance to 5-FU, we 195 All rights reserved.

Within nsp14, 4 NS mutations 215\n\nwere identified in the ExoN domain, and 2 NS mutations were in the C-terminal N7-216 methyltransferase domain (Fig. 6B ).

The model predicts that five 220 mutations are located close to surface of the protein (Fig. 6B ). All three modeled zinc finger 221 domains contain one NS mutation (F216Y, Y248H, L473I). Two mutations, D128E and F216Y, 222 are located near the interface between nsp10 and nsp14, though neither site has previously been 223 implicated in nsp10-nsp14 interaction (15, 64, 65). One NS mutation resulted in a D272E 224 substitution in ExoN motif III, a metal-coordinating active site residue. We previously reported 225 that alanine substitution of D272 results in an ExoN(-) phenotype (14), but the viability or 226 phenotype of a D272E substitution was not tested in that study. These data suggest that a 227 network of residues evolved to regulate nsp12 and nsp14 activity or stability in the ExoN(-) 228 background. 229 230 Fixed mutations in nsp12 and nsp14 in MHV-ExoN(-) P250 directly correlate with 231 increased resistance to multiple nucleoside analogs. To determine approximately when the 232 mutations in nsp12 and nsp14 arose, we performed di-deoxy sequencing across these protein-233 coding regions roughly every 20 passages (P10, 31, 50, 72, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, 234 240) . By this method, we detected consensus NS mutations at P10, P50, and P160 for nsp12, and 235 at P50 and P160 for nsp14 (Fig. 6) . Both nsp12 and nsp14 carried their full complement of P250 236 consensus mutations by P160, except for a minority variant (D913E) in nsp12 maintained at 237 <50% of the population between P200 and P250. These passage levels correlated with increased 238 replication of MHV-ExoN(-) (Fig. 2B ) and with decreasing sensitivity to 5-FU (Fig. 7A ). Neither 239 replication nor 5-FU sensitivity of MHV-ExoN(-) changed substantially between P160 and P250. 240\n\nTo determine whether MHV-ExoN(-) evolved increased resistance to multiple nucleoside 241 All rights reserved.
