{"title": "Glucose Trimming and Mannose Trimming Affect Different Phases of the Maturation of Sindbis Virus in Infected BHK Cells", "body": "glycoproteins of Sindbis virus each contain two glycosylation sites (Hsieh et al., 1 983a) . Whether a particular glycosylation site carries complex or high-mannose oligosaccharides is presumably determined to a large extent, if not exclusively, by the folding of the polypeptide chain, since accessibility to the processing enzymes determines the amount of processing that can take place (Hsieh et al., 1 983b) . One glycosylation site on E1 and E2 carries exclusively complex-type oligosaccharides irrespective of whether the virus is grown in avian or mammalian cells (Hsieh et al., 1983a) .\n\nComplex-type oligosaccharides are generated via the trimming pathway (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) .\n\nTrimming of the precursor oligosaccharide GIc 3 -Mang(GIcNAc) 2 , of the complex and high-mannose oligosaccharides characteristic of N-linked glycoproteins, is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum by the removal of the three glucose residues by glucosidases I and II INTRODUCTION (Grinna and Robbins, 1979 ; Burns and Touster, 1982) .\n\nSome mannose trimming may also occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (Bischoff and Kornfeld, 1983 ) .\n\nSubsequently, the action of mannosidase I in the Golgi apparatus completes the removal of up to four mannose residues (Tabas and Kornfeld, 1979) . Addition of GIcNAc by GIcNAc transferase I (Harpaz and Schachter, 1980) , the subsequent removal of two more mannose residues by mannosidase II (Tulsiani etal., 1982a) , and the addition of the peripheral GIcNAc, Gal, and NeuAc residues by specific glycosyltransferases results in the formation of complex-type oligosaccharides (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) .\n\nThe biological significance of the trimming pathway and the relative importance of high-mannose and complex oligosaccharides for the proper functioning of glycoproteins can be studied with specific inhibitors of the trimming glycosidases (Schwarz and Datema, 1984) . Several inhibitors of the trimming glycosidases are now available and proteins glycosylated in the presence of the glucosidase inhibitors 1-deoxynojirimycin (Saunier et al., 1982) , N-methyl-l-deoxynojirimycin (Romero et al., 1983) , or castanospermine (Pan mannojirimycin (dMM) ,z inhibits Golgi mannosidase I (Fuhrmann et al., 1984 ; Bischoff and Kornfeld, 1984) and proteins are equipped with oligosaccharides of the composition Man e (GIcNAc) z (Elbein et al., 1984) . Swainsonine, on the other hand, inhibits Golgi mannosidase II (Tulsiani et a!, 1982b) leading to the formation of hybrid-type structures .\n\nIn Sindbis virus-infected BHK cells in which glucose trimming is inhibited by bromoconduritol (Datema et al., 1984) , 1-deoxynojirimycin, or castanospermine (Schlesinger et al., 1985) , the cleavage of pE2 to E2 is inhibited . As expected from the requirement of cleavage of pE2 for virus formation, the release of virus particles is decreased in the inhibitor-treated cells . This effect can be reversed by lowering the incubation temperature from 37 to 30\u00b0 (Schlesinger et at, 1985) . This infers that pE2 equipped with glucosylated high-mannose oligosaccharides has a conformation resistant to proteolytic cleavage . It was therefore of interest to determine whether glucose trimming alone was sufficient to allow virus maturation or whether mannose trimming is also required . Thus the relative roles of glucose and mannose trimming in Sindbis virus maturation in BHK cells were investigated by the use of glucosidase (MdN) and mannosidase I (dMM) inhibitors .\n\nVirus and tissue culture Confluent monolayers of BHK cells were grown in Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 6% fetal calf serum . The cells were infected with Sindbis virus strain Sa-AR-86 at a multiplicity of infection of 50 plaqueforming units per cell . After infection the cells were maintained in either Earle's medium or Dulbecco's medium containing 10 mMfructose instead of glucose as indicated in the text . When labeling with [35 S]methionine was performed, Dulbecco's medium lacking methionine was used . After labeling the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and either suspended in chloroform-methanol (2 :1 v/v) for extraction of lipids or lysed with a buffer comprising 62 .5 mM Tris-HCI, pH 6 .8, 3% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol for SDS-PAGE . Virus in the medium was quantitated by plaque assay and by the incorporation of [35 S]methionine into virus particles 'Abbreviations used : MdN, N-methyl- isolated by sucrose density centrifugation (Schwarz et a!, 1976 ) .\n\nN-Methyl-l-deoxynojirimycin (MdN) was prepared by methylation of 1-deoxynojirimycin (supplied by Dr . E . Truscheit, Bayer AG, Wuppertal, FRG) (Romero et al., 1983 ) and 1-deoxymannojirimycin (1 ,5-dideoxy-1,5imino-D-mannitol) was obtained from Dr . G . Kinast (Bayer AG) . MdN and dMM were added to the culture medium at final concentrations of 1 and 2 mM, respectively . Swainsonine was from Dr . P . Dorling, Murdoch University, Western Australia, and was used at a final concentration of 0 .5,ug/ml . Tunicamycin was purchased from Calbiochem (Frankfurt am Main, FRG) and used at a final concentration of 2 \u00b5g/ml . Inhibitors were added to cultures 1 hr after infection and maintained throughout the incubation period .\n\n[2 3H]Mannose (19 Ci/mmol), U-14 C-labeled protein hydrolysate (57 mCi/mAtom) and [35 S]methionine (1100 Ci/mmol) were bought from Amersham Buchler (Braunschweig, FRG) . Pronase, endo j4-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, and Jack Bean a-mannosidase (type III) were purchased from Serve (Heidelberg, FRG), Seikagachu Kogyo Co ., Ltd . (Tokyo, Japan), and Sigma (Munich, FRG), respectively . Rat liver microsomal aglucosidase was prepared and assayed according to Grinna and Robbins (1979) . Oligosaccharide standards labeled in their glucose or mannose moieties were prepared as described previously (Datema and Schwarz, 1981 ; Schwarz and Datema, 1 982a) and characterized by chromatography on columns of Bio-Gel P4 and their resistance or susceptibility to digestion with a-glucosidase and a-mannosidase (Datema and Schwarz, 1981 ; Datema et al., 1982) .\n\nColumns of Bio-Gel P4 and P6 were calibrated and eluted as described previously (Datema et al., 1980 (Datema et al., , 1982 . SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of labeled viral glycoproteins was performed in 10% gels using the Laemmli discontinuous system (Schwarz and Klenk, 1974) .\n\nExtraction of lipid-linked oligosaccharides and the preparation of glycopeptides have been described elsewhere (Datema etal., 1982 ; Schwarz and Datema, 1982a) . Pronase digestion and a-mannosidase diges-tion were carried out as described earlier (Datema and Schwarz, 1981) . Electron microscopy was performed using published procedures (Scholtissek et at, 1978) .\n\nIt was necessary to determine whether the two inhibitors MdN and dMM were specific trimming inhibitors in Sindbis virus-infected BHK cells . Chick embryo cells were not used because in our hands dMM inhibited the formation of lipid-linked oligosaccharides in these cells (Elbein et at, 1984) . However, no effect on ROLES OF GLUCOSE AND MANNOSE TRIMMING ]mannose from 4 to 5 hr postinfection, and then chased for 2 hr . The cells were extracted with chloroformmethanol (2 :1 v/v) and chloroform-methanol-water (10 :10:3 v/v) to remove lipid-linked oligosaccharides and the lipid-free residue was digested with Pronase . The resulting glycopeptides were then desalted by passage through a column of Bio-Gel P6, treated with endo H, and analyzed by gel filtration through Bio-Gel P4 . Vo signifies the void volume and the arrows indicate the elution positions of (1) GIc,Man\u00b0GIcNAc and (2) Man,GlcNAc reference compounds . Peaks 1-6 were characterized following digestion with a-glucosidase and a-mannosidase as described by Datema et at (1982) and are as follows: (1) GIc,Man,GIcNAc ; (2) and (6) Man,GlcNAc ; (3) Man,GtcNAc ; (4) Glc,Man\u00b0GIcNAc; (5) Glc,Man,GlcNAc. 39 the assembly of GIc,Man a (GIcNAc) 2 -PP-Dol was observed in BHK cells in the presence of 2 mM dMM . At higher concentrations (5 mM) an inhibitory effect was observed (data not shown) . The structures of the oligosaccharides of the Sindbis viral glycoproteins synthesized in the presence of either 1 mM MdN or 2 mM dMM were analyzed, after labeling with [3 H]mannose, pronase digestion, and endo H treatment, by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P4 (Fig . 1) . It can be seen that both inhibitors blocked the formation of complex-type oligosaccharides . Analysis of the oligosaccharides formed in the presence of MdN showed the occurrence of Glc,Man a , 9 (GIcNAc) 2 ( Fig . 1 B) , whereas in the presence of dMM ( Fig . 1 C) only one major oligosaccharide of the composition Man 9 (GIcNAc)2 was detected . Therefore the inhibitors exert specific blocks in the trimming pathway in infected BHK cells .\n\nTo assess the effects of MdN and dMM on the release of virus into the extracellular medium, the infectivity was determined by plaque assay and in addition the incorporation of [35 S]methionine into virus particles, isolated by sucrose density centrifugation, was measured . Both inhibitors significantly suppressed virus particle formation (Table 1 ; Student's t test P < 0 .001 for MdN and P < 0 .02 for dMM) . In contrast to dMM the mannosidase II inhibitorswainsonine had no inhibitory effect on virus formation . To check for possible toxic (nonspecific) effects of MdN or dMM, BHK cells were infected with a strain of influenza virus adapted to growth in these cells, and treated with MdN or dMM . Previous studies had shown that MdN (Romero et al., 1983) and dMM (Elbein et al., 1984) do not affect the formation of influenza virus . Indeed, no change in the hemagglutination titer in MdN-or dMM-treated cultures with respect to the untreated control was observed (data not shown) . When the infected cells were incubated at 33\u00b0 instead of 37\u00b0, the inhibitory effects of MdN on the yield of virus were reduced (Table 1) , thus confirming that the block induced by inhibiting glucose removal is temperature sensitive (Schlesinger et al., 1985) . However, this was not so for the inhibition caused by dMM treatment (Table 1) .\n\nProteolytic cleavage of pE2 to E2 is a late event, occurring just prior to budding of the virus, either in the Golgi or during transport to the cell surface or at the cell surface itself, and is necessary for virus particle production (Garoff et al., 1982) . Previous studies (Datema etal., 1984 ; Schlesingeretal., 1985) have shown that in Sindbis virus-infected BHK cells treated with the glucosidase inhibitors bromoconduritol and 1-deoxynojirimycin, the pE2 to F2 cleavage is blocked, resulting in a reduction in the yield of virus . To investigate if proteolysis was blocked in cells treated with the trimming inhibitors in the present study, treated cells were labeled with 14C-labeled amino acids for 2 hr at 4 hr postinfection and the cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig . 2) . Untreated cultures showed the formation of pE2, El, and E2 glycoproteins and the capsid protein C (Fig . 2, lane 1) . In the presence of 1 mM MdN it appeared that no E2 was present (Fig . 2 , lane 2), indicating that the pE2 to E2 cleavage was impaired in these cells . In the presence of 2 mM dMM no block is evident (Fig . 2, lane 3) . The E1 and E2 proteins synthesized in the presence of dMM migrate very close together on SDS-PAGE due to alterations in the oligosaccharide side-chains of these glycoproteins induced by the mannosidase inhibitor . Under normal conditions in virus produced in BHK cells the El protein contains two complex oligosaccharides, whereas the E2 protein contains one complex oligosaccharide and one high-mannose oligosaccharide (Hsieh et al ., 1983a) . In the presence of dMM both proteins are glycosylated exclusively with high-mannose oligosaccharides (Man 9 (GIcNAc)z) as shown in Fig . 1 . It was to be expected that the change in molecular weight of El due to the conversion of two complex oligosaccharides to two high-mannose oligosaccharides would be greater than that in E2 in which only one complex oligosaccharide is converted . Cultures treated with the mannosidase II inhibitor swainsonine also showed no or 500 ng/ml SW (lane 4) and were labeled with 10 \u00b5Ci'\"C-labeled protein hydrolysate at 37\u00b0 for 2 hr from 4 hr postintection . Lysates were prepared (see Materials and Methods) and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% gels (Schwarz and Klenk, 1974) . effect on the pE2 to E2 cleavage (Fig . 2, lane 4) . The suspected impairment in the pE2 to E2 cleavage in MdN-treated cultures was further investigated by pulse-chase labeling with [ 35S]methionine in the absence and presence of the trimming inhibitors (Fig . 3) . Thus in the untreated cultures and in those treated with dMM and SW the pE2 precursor formed during the pulse is absent after chasing with unlabeled medium for 60 min (Fig . 3, lanes 1, 3, and 4) . However, in the MdN-treated culture (Fig . 3, lane 2) , pE2 is still present after the 60-min chase . Thus in the presence The cells from one set of plates were then harvested and prepared for SDS-PAGE (p) . In the other set the medium was removed, the cells were washed three times with warm phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh medium containing the appropriate inhibitor and 1 mM unlabeled methionine was added . The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0f or 60 min and then harvested for SDS-PAGE (c). Lanes 1-4 refer to the lysates from cultures treated as follows : (1) untreated, (2) treated with 1 TIM MdN, (3) treated with 2 mM dMM, (4) treated with 500 mg/ml SWK p, pulse ; c, chase . of MdN the proteolytic cleavage of pE2 to E2 is impaired, like with the other glucosidase inhibitors, and as result the formation of virus is inhibited . dMM, however, does not affect the pE2 to E2 cleavage and therefore the inhibition of virus release observed in the presence of dMM must be due to another cause .\n\nIn a similar experiment Sindbis-infected cells were labeled with [ 3 H]palmitic acid to investigate whether acylation of the viral glycoproteins was affected by the trimming inhibitors . No effects on acylation were observed since all the Sindbis viral glycoproteins were labeled (data not shown) .\n\nIs there intracellular budding of Sindbis virus in the presence of dMM?\n\nOne possible cause of the reduction in virus release into the extracellular medium in dMM-treated cultures is that virus is budding intracellularly . This phenomenon occurs in the presence of monensin (Johnson and Schlesinger, 1980) and is the major route for Sindbis virus production in insect cells (Gliedman et al ., 1975) . In order to test for this possibility, the yields of infectious virus in the medium alone and in the medium plus cells taken together after freezing and thawing three times to release any intracellular virus particles were determined ( Table 2) . Comparison of the virus titers between untreated and dMM-treated cultures shows that when only the medium is considered, the yield of virus in the dMM-treated cultures is significantly lower than that in the control (Student's t test P < 0 .05) . However, there are no significant differences between untreated and dMM-treated cultures when the yield of virus in medium plus cells is considered (Student's t test P > 0 .1) . Tu- Sindbis virus-infected BHK cells were treated with inhibitor from 1 hr postinfection as indicated . After 15 hr incubation virus in either the medium alone or the medium and cells together (after freezing and thawing three times) was determined by plaque assay . The lowered titer in the medium + cell control is probably a consequence of the sensitivity of the virus to the freezing and thawing treatment .\n\nnicamycin which inhibits protein glycosylation by blocking the assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor (Schwarz and Datema, 1 982b) does not show this effect (Table 2 ) . It is significant that only freeze-thaw treatment of the dMM-treated cultures resulted in an increase in virus titer . These results are suggestive of the presence of intracellular virus particles in the cultures treated with dMM . However, a similar result would be obtained if virus was adhering to the cell surface . Therefore to distinguish between these two possibilities electron microscopy of untreated and dMM-treated Sindbis virus-infected BHK cells was performed (Figs . 4a-4d) . In the untreated cells virus was seen budding from the cell surface (Fig . 4a) , whereas in the dMM-treated cells intracellular virus particles were seen (Figs . 4b-4d ) . In addition, nucleocapsids were found lining intracellular membranes (Fig . 4d ) providing evidence that virus assembly is actually taking place at the intracellular site . These findings coupled with those of the plaque assays intimate that in the presence of dMM Sindbis virus buds preferentially from intracellular membranes .\n\nAs previously observed (Datema et al., 1984 ; Schlesinger et al., 1985) , glucose trimming is essential for the effective maturation of Sindbis virus in infected BHK cells . At least one critical step is impeded when glucose trimming does not occur, the proteolytic cleavage of pE2 to E2 . This cleavage has been previously shown to be required for virus release (reviewed by Garoff et al., 1982) and it has been postulated that pE2 equipped with glucosylated high-mannose oligosaccharides does not go through a conformational rearrangement which makes the protein susceptible to cleavage (Schlesinger et al., 1985) . The question remained, where in the trimming pathway does this conformational change take place? Here it has been shown that when glucose trimming is allowed to occur and mannose removal is prevented by inhibiting Golgi mannosidase I, pE2 is cleaved to E2 . This is an example of the essential role for glucose trimming in glycoprotein biosynthesis . Allowing glucose trimming, but preventing subsequent mannose trimming, restores the yield of infectious virus to control levels, although the virus in dMM-treated cultures appears to bud from intracellular membranes to a greater extent than virus in untreated cultures as demonstrated by a decrease in the yield of cell-free virus and by electron microscopy . These findings support the proposal (Rots et al, 1975 ) that intracellular membranes represent a site of second choice for the formation of enveloped viruses as has been demonstrated for influenza virus (Rott et al., 1975 ; Stitz et at, 1977 Rc . 4 . Electron microscopy of untreated and 1-deoxymannojirimycin-treated Sindbis virus-infected BHK cells . Virus-infected cells either untreated (a) or treated (b-d) with 2 mM dMM from 1 hr postinfection were incubated for B-15 hr, and harvested and prepared for electron microscopy (Scholtissek et af., 1978) . (b-d) Virus particles (arrows) inside dMM-treated Sindbis virus-infected BHK cells at 8 hr (b) and 15 hr (c, d) postinfection . Viral nucleocapsids (N) are seen lining the internal membranes in (d), an effect reminiscent of that observed in monensin-treated cells (Johnson and Schlesinger, 1980) . (a) Virus particles budding from the cell surface in untreated cultures . The bar represents 0 .2 AM. thatt small alterations in carbohydrate structure of the Sindbis viral glycoproteins, as brought about by an inhibitor of oligosaccharide processing, can lead to the choice of such a second site . The oligosaccharide composition of the glycoproteins from virus budding from intracellular membranes in untreated cultures is not known, but it is possible that such virus contains a higher proportion of glycoproteins with less processed oligosaccharide than virus released by budding from the plasma membrane .\n\nThe phenomenon of intracellular budding virus has been observed in cultures treated with the ionophore monensin (Johnson and Schlesinger, 1980) , which blocks intracellular transport between the cis and trans compartments of the Golgi apparatus (Tartakoff, 1983) . It is interesting that when mannose trimming is blocked later in the pathway by inhibiting the action of Golgi mannosidase II with swainsonine (Table 1 ) or by growing the virus in mutant cells lacking GIcNAc transferase I (Schlesingeretal., 1976 ), no effect on virus maturation was observed . Thus it would appear that the initial stages of mannose trimming may be important for determining the final destination of the Sindbis viral glycoproteins in infected BHK cells . This apparent observation of preferential intracellular budding when preventing mannose trimming may be analogous to the result that in Sindbis virus-infected mosquito cells, the virus buds from internal membranes (Gliedman et al., 1975) . Mosquito cells lack the terminal glycosyltransferases necessary for the formation of complex-type oligosaccharides (Butters and Hughes, 1981 ; Butters et al., 1981) and the glycoproteins are equipped with oligosaccharides of the composition Man 3(GIcNAc)2 at the glycosylation sites which would carry exclusively complex oligosaccharides in avian or mammalian cells (Hsieh and Robbins . 1984) . The remaining glycosylation sites carry high-mannose oligosaccharides containing five to nine mannose residues (Hsieh and Robbins, 1984) .\n\nThe essential role of glucose trimming for Sindbis virus formation observed in this study corresponds with observations made with vesicular stomatitis virus (Schlesinger et al., 1984) and mouse hepatitis virus (Repp et at, 1985) and a consensus suggests that removal of glucose residues is essential for the establishment of a functional conformation for some viral glycoproteins . Thus the formation of some influenza A viruses (Romero et at, 1983 ; Elbein et al., 1984) and Rous sarcoma virus (Bosch and Bosch et at, 1985) is not affected by either glucosidase or mannosidase inhibitors with the exception of the influenza A virus, fowl plague virus (H 7 N,) , which has a cleavable hemagglutinin (Bosch et at, 1981) . When equipped with GIc,Man 9 (GIcNAc) 2 oligosaccharides, the hemagglutinin is metabolically unstable (Datema et al., 1982 (Datema et al., , 1984 , but it is stable with oligosaccharides of the composition Glc 3 Nlan 9 (GlcNAc) 2 (Romero et al., 1983) . Clearly, as the biological role of trimming cannot be predicted, each system must be examined in its own right .\n\nWe thank Kirstin Schallner and Ulrike Klein for technical assistance, Dr . C . B .
