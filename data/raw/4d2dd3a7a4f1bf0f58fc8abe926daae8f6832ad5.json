{"title": "Bartonellosis", "body": "The most common Bartonella species isolated from cats is B. henselae. Less commonly, cats are infected with Bartonella clarridgeiae or Bartonella koehlerae, which also have been linked to human disease. 5, 8 Young cats (\u22641 year) are more likely than older cats to be bacteremic, and stray or feral cats are more likely to be bacteremic than pet cats. 5, 9, 10 Older cats are more likely to be seropositive than young cats, which likely reflects the increased chance of exposure over time. The prevalence of Bartonella bacteremia in cats is also highest in warm, humid climates (e.g., 68% in the Philippines), whereas it is low in colder climates (e.g., 0% in Norway). 5 At least two genotypes of B. henselae infect cats, type Houston-1 (type I) and type Marseille (type II). B. henselae type Marseille predominates among cats in the western United States, western continental Europe, the United Kingdom, and Australia; type Houston-1 is dominant in Asia (Japan and the Philippines). 5 However, within a given country, the prevalence of these types varies among cat populations, and type Houston-1 is more often isolated from humans with bartonellosis, even when type Marseille is more prevalent in the cat population. Some molecular typing methods reveal an even broader genetic diversity among feline strains, and most of the strains that infect humans cluster in a limited number of groups.\n\nDogs are most commonly infected with Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii or B. henselae. Domestic and wild dogs are thought to be the natural reservoir for B. v. berkhoffii, because B. v. berkhoffii establishes prolonged bacteremia in dogs. In California, 35% of coyotes (Canis latrans) tested were seropositive, and 28% of coyotes from a highly endemic region were bacteremic. 5 Other Bartonella species have also been detected in dogs (see Table 52 -2). Novel species also have been identified in dogs from Thailand, Sri Lanka, and the Mediterranean. [11] [12] [13] Because it is often difficult to culture Bartonella from domestic dog blood, prevalence studies in dogs are usually based on antibody detection. Unfortunately, this correlates poorly with bacteremia. In addition, serologic cross-reactivity occurs among Bartonella species so seroprevalence studies cannot be Bartonella species-specific. The prevalence of antibodies to B. v. berkhoffii in dogs is highest in tropical or subtropical regions. For example, seroprevalences as high as 47% were detected in stray dogs from Morocco. 14 In the southeastern United States, the prevalence of B. henselae antibodies in healthy dogs was 10%; a higher prevalence (27%) was found in sick dogs. 15 Risk factors identified in dogs in the southeastern United States were tick exposure, residence in a rural environment, roaming, and outdoor exposure. 16 The prevalence of B. henselae antibodies in sick dogs from the western United States is less than 2%. 17 \n\nAfter infection, Bartonella replicates in erythrocytes and can also infect endothelial cells and bone marrow progenitor cells. 18 It then establishes chronic, often subclinical bacteremia, which can last for weeks, months, or even more than a year and may be a specific adaptation to a mode of transmission by blood-sucking 19 Infection of endothelial cells may be more likely to occur in incidental hosts and appears to be necessary for the development of disorders such as vasculoproliferative disease and endocarditis. Bartonella is thought to cause vasculoproliferative disease via cytokine-induced stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation and inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis. Virulence factors characterized in Bartonella species include adhesins, heme acquisition mechanisms, type IV secretion systems, and a lowpotency lipopolysaccharide, among others. 20 Host immunocompromise, such as due to genetic susceptibility (e.g., breed-related immunodeficiency syndromes), poor nutrition, overcrowding, co-infections with other pathogens, immunosuppressive drug treatment, or defects in normal host barriers (such as congenital valvular disease in dogs with endocarditis), may also influence whether disease ultimately develops in infected dogs and cats. The vast majority of infected dogs and cats show no overt clinical signs of illness when bacteremic. In some situations, disease manifestations that occur in Bartonella spp.-infected dogs and cats are otherwise uncommon to rare and/or known to be associated with Bartonella infection in human patients; organisms may also have been visualized with silver stains using light microscopy in affected tissues (e.g., endocarditis or myocarditis lesions). In other situations, nonspecific clinical signs are present (e.g., uveitis, gingivostomatitis, chylothorax, polyarthritis, chronic rhinitis, idiopathic lower urinary tract disease, lymphadenopathy, reproductive disease, or neurologic disorders), and it has been impossible to clearly assign a role to Bartonella in disease causation. A clear understanding of the role of Bartonella in disease causation has also been thwarted by limitations of diagnostic tests available for detection of infection.\n\nExperimental infections of specific pathogen free cats with Bartonella have shed light on disease processes that can follow infection of cats with Bartonella. Cats infected with B. henselae develop a small papule at the site of inoculation, and transient fever and lymphadenopathy. [21] [22] [23] [24] Transient neurologic signs (such as staring and behavioral abnormalities) and reproductive disorders can also occur. Some cats infected with B. henselae and/or B. clarridgeiae show no clinical signs, and gross lesions are lacking at necropsy. However, histopathology reveals peripheral lymph node hyperplasia, splenic follicular hyperplasia, lymphocytic cholangitis/pericholangitis, lymphocytic hepatitis, lymphoplasmacytic myocarditis, and/or interstitial lymphocytic nephritis. 21, 23 In naturally infected cats, Bartonella can rarely cause endocarditis and myocarditis. Generally speaking, infective endocarditis is rare in cats, but a few of the reported cases have been associated with Bartonella infection. B. henselae DNA has been amplified from aortic valvular vegetative lesions of cats, with visualization of the organism in lesions using silver stains. 25, 26 Dramatic pyogranulomatous myocarditis and diaphragmatic myositis were associated with B. henselae infection in two cats that died in a North Carolina shelter, and organisms were detected in lesions with silver stains and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Figure 52-1) . 27 Carpal and metacarpal osteomyelitis was also associated with a B. v. berkhoffii infection in a cat; Bartonella DNA was detected in bone lesions as well as in the blood. 28 The DNA of B. v. berkhoffii and B. henselae was also detected in cardiac tissues of several cats with systemic reactive angioendotheliomatosis. 29 Bartonella has been investigated for its role in a large number of idiopathic conditions in cats (see Table 52 -3). [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] These include uveitis, 30-32 caudal gingivostomatitis, 32-37 fever of unknown origin, 38 lower urinary tract disease, 32,36,39 chronic kidney disease, 32,36 pancreatitis, 40 lymphadenopathy ( Figure 52 -2), 37 neurologic disease, 32, 41, 42 pododermatitis, 43 and chronic idiopathic rhinosinusitis. 44 There is currently no convincing and repeatable scientific evidence that Bartonella infection causes any of these conditions. Studies have varied in the methodology used to detect infection (serology, culture, and/or PCR assays), and many of the conditions investigated likely have multifactorial etiologies. An understanding of the significance of Bartonella in these conditions will probably require prospective study of large numbers of cats with clearly defined clinical illness using Bartonella culture and/ or PCR assays.\n\nBartonella spp. are important causes of blood-culture-negative endocarditis in dogs (see Box 52-1). 25, 29, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] Infection with Bartonella was identified in 6 (19%) of 31 dogs with culturenegative endocarditis in California. 61 Worldwide, the DNA of several Bartonella species has been detected in the heart valves of dogs with endocarditis. The most common species identified has been B. v. berkhoffii. In dogs, Bartonella endocarditis usually involves the aortic valve, although the mitral valve is occasionally affected, so the possibility of bartonellosis should not be ruled out in dogs with mitral valve endocarditis. Dogs with Bartonella endocarditis are more likely to be afebrile and more likely to have congestive heart failure than dogs with other causes of endocarditis, and their median survival time is shorter (Figure 52 -3). 61 Complications of Bartonella endocarditis include thromboembolic disease and neutrophilic polyarthritis.\n\nBartonella, or Bartonella DNA, has been detected in lesions from dogs with a variety of chronic pyogranulomatous or granulomatous inflammatory and vasculoproliferative diseases (see . Bartonella was detected in a dog with peliosis hepatis and a dog with bacillary angiomatosis, rare conditions that are strongly associated with Bartonella infection in humans. 54, 60 Peliosis hepatis and bacillary angiomatosis are vasculoproliferative diseases characterized by the presence of blood-filled proliferations of vascular tissue in the liver and skin, respectively. Based on case reports and seroprevalence studies, Bartonella is suspected to cause polyarthritis, epistaxis, thrombocytopenia, and/or splenomegaly in dogs. 17 However, these associations could also reflect the presence of other detected or undetected, co-transmitted vector-borne pathogens that cause these disorders. Bartonella has been investigated for its role in canine lymphoma 62 ; neurologic disease 63 ; splenic disorders including lymphoid nodular hyperplasia, hemangiosarcoma, and fibrohistiocytic nodules 64 ; idiopathic cavitary effusion 65 ; and idiopathic rhinitis. 66 As for cats, the role that Bartonella plays in these conditions, if any, is unclear and requires further study.\n\nIn dogs with Bartonella endocarditis, physical examination findings include lethargy, inappetence and thin body condition; lameness or recumbency due to thromboembolic complications, weakness, or polyarthritis; joint effusion; and, uncommonly, fever (as high as 104.9\u00b0F [41\u00b0C]). Evidence of cardiac disease and congestive heart failure is often present, including respiratory distress, cough, increased lung sounds, and systolic and/or diastolic heart murmurs, cardiac arrhythmias, and pulse deficits. Neurologic signs such as anisocoria and obtundation can occur in dogs with thromboembolism that involves the central nervous system. There may also be evidence of flea or tick infestations in some dogs. Other physical examination findings that might be present in dogs with other manifestations of bartonellosis are mass lesions that involve the nasal cavity, lymph nodes, or salivary glands; splenomegaly or hepatomegaly; cavitary effusions; peripheral edema; epistaxis; or nodular skin lesions. Physical examination findings in cats with Bartonella endocarditis or myocarditis have included fever, lethargy, respiratory distress, cardiac murmurs, and arrhythmias. 26, 27 Diagnosis Diagnosis of bartonellosis is based on the presence of consistent clinical abnormalities (especially endocarditis or myocarditis, but also other systemic inflammatory or vasculoproliferative diseases), histopathologic findings, and positive culture or PCR FIGURE 52-2 Lymph node of a 1-year-old, retrovirus-negative, flea-ridden cat with a 3-month history of fever, mild lethargy, and generalized peripheral lymphadenopathy but a normal appetite. The right axillary and both mandibular lymph nodes measured 3 cm in diameter; the remaining peripheral lymph nodes were 2 cm in diameter. A serum chemistry profile revealed hyperglobulinemia (6.5 g/dL). Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a polyclonal gammopathy. Histopathology of the right axillary, right mandibular and right popliteal lymph node showed lymphofollicular hyperplasia and marked neutrophilic, lymphocytic, and histiocytic capsulitis and perilymphadenitis. Note the florid capsulitis to the right of the arrows, which indicate the outer extent of the lymph node parenchyma. Silver stains (Warthin-Starry and Steiner stains) showed a small amount of granular staining within cells, which possibly represented intracellular agyrophilic bacteria. The DNA of Bartonella henselae and Bartonella clarridgeiae was detected in the lymph node using PCR, and blood cultures were positive for B. henselae. Interestingly, the cat was seronegative to B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae. assay results on blood and affected tissues (Table 52-4) . It may be impossible to identify Bartonella as the cause of disease if the organism is detected only in the blood and if affected tissues (e.g., valvular vegetations) cannot be obtained for analysis, because healthy dogs and especially cats can be bacteremic.\n\nOther possible causes of disease must also be investigated, and a response to antibiotic treatment could be evaluated (see Case Example). 67 It is even more difficult to establish a definitive diagnosis based on serology, but when culture and PCR assay results are negative, positive serologic test results in dogs may be of some value in the presence of consistent clinical abnormalities. More specifically (and as occurs in humans), dogs with Bartonella endocarditis usually have high antibody titers to Bartonella spp. Organism detection tests are insensitive in dogs because dogs tend to have very low levels of bacteremia when compared with cats.\n\nHematologic and biochemistry abnormalities in dogs and cats with Bartonella endocarditis are nonspecific and often mild. The CBC may show a mild nonregenerative anemia (31% to 39%), variable leukocytosis primarily due to neutrophilia (up to 43,000 neutrophils/\u00b5L), and mild thrombocytopenia (usually above 100,000 platelets/\u00b5L). In a few dogs, low to moderate numbers of circulating band neutrophils, lymphocytosis, and/ or monocytosis are present. 49, 68, 69 The biochemistry panel may reveal mild azotemia (creatinine <3 mg/dL), mild hypoalbuminemia, and, less often, hyperglobulinemia. Isosthenuria, proteinuria, cylindruria, and slightly increased urine protein-tocreatinine ratios have been present in the urine of some affected dogs. Dogs with hepatic disorders associated with Bartonella infection have had moderately increased activities of serum ALT and/or ALP. 51,54\n\nThoracic radiographs in dogs with Bartonella endocarditis often show evidence of congestive heart failure, with venous engorgement and pulmonary edema (Figure 52-4) . Lung lobe consolidation and hilar lymphadenopathy were described in a dog with systemic granulomatous disease and sialometaplasia. 55\n\nUltrasound of dogs with systemic granulomatous or pyogranulomatous disease may reveal lymphadenomegaly and organomegaly, 52 and mixed echogenic patterns within the liver. 51 The dog with peliosis hepatis had ascites and multiple, small nodular masses and hypoechoic cystic lesions within the liver. 54 \n\nEchocardiography in dogs and cats with Bartonella endocarditis reveals oscillating valvular vegetations or thickened and hyperechoic valve leaflets, which usually involve the aortic valve ( Figure 52-5 ). There may be evidence of aortic regurgitation or insufficiency and eccentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle in some dogs.\n\nCulture of blood or other tissues for Bartonella allows definitive diagnosis of infection. However, blood culture requires special techniques and can be insensitive because of the relapsing nature of bacteremia. In contrast to the situation in cats, culture has especially low sensitivity in dogs because of the low level of bacteremia in dogs (especially when they act as incidental hosts and develop disease). Blood for culture should be obtained using sterile technique and the blood placed in EDTA-containing tubes, and then chilled or frozen during shipment. Collection of blood into plastic EDTA tubes allows the tubes to be frozen directly, which releases organisms from erythrocytes after which they are plated onto special media. Blood should be sent to laboratories familiar with the culture of these fastidious organisms, and the laboratories should be contacted for specific instructions regarding specimen collection and submission. Special media (such as fresh chocolate agar, or brain-heart infusion agar enriched with 5% to 10% blood) and culture conditions (5% CO 2 , temperatures of 35\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C) are used to enhance the likelihood of isolation of Bartonella. 62 diagnosis of Bartonella infections of dogs. It also has the potential to yield other fastidious organisms not cultured under routine conditions that may play a role in endocarditis. 70\n\nA variety of PCR-based assays have been developed for rapid detection of Bartonella DNA in blood or other tissues. Some veterinary diagnostic laboratories offer real-time PCR assays for detection of Bartonella species as a component of vectorborne PCR panels. Some assays detect all species of Bartonella, whereas others are species-specific. Genetic analysis of the resultant PCR products can also be performed to identify the infecting species. The clinical performance of many of these assays when compared with culture has not been well studied. When used directly on blood specimens, PCR assays may be no more sensitive than culture for detection of Bartonella, and detection of DNA does not always equate to detection of living organisms. False-positive PCR assay results due to laboratory contamination have the potential to occur.\n\nImmunofluorescent antibody (IFA), ELISA, and Western immunoblot assays are available for detection of antibodies to Bartonella species. Some degree of cross-reactivity occurs among Bartonella species, but multiple species-specific assays still should be performed to increase the chance of antibody detection. Paired titers are not valuable because disease typically results from chronic and persistent infection. If serologic testing is performed in dogs, at a minimum it should include testing for B. henselae, B. v. berkhoffii, B. rochalimae, and B. clarridgeiae. Measurement of serum antibodies to Bartonella has a limited ability to help determine whether a sick animal has an active Bartonella infection. In both cats and dogs, bacteremia can occur in the absence of detectable antibodies (see Figure 52 -2), and seropositive cats and dogs are not always bacteremic. Fewer than half of antibody-positive cats are bacteremic, and 3% to 15% of antibody-negative cats are bacteremic. 67 Because of this, serology is not recommended for routine diagnosis of Bartonella infection in cats. Because of the low sensitivity of PCR and culture in dogs, serology could be considered when these assays and routine blood cultures are negative (or in conjunction with PCR and culture) to support a diagnosis of Bartonella endocarditis (which is usually associated with high antibody titers).\n\nGross necropsy of dogs and cats with Bartonella endocarditis may reveal evidence of congestive heart failure, with lung congestion and edema. Single or multiple, variably sized nodules are typically present on the periphery of valvular leaflets, which may be small and firm or large, granular, and friable ( Figure 52-6) . White plaques may be found adherent to the adjacent endocardial surfaces. Histopathology reveals chronic inflammation, with fibrous tissue and extensive mineral deposits. The presence of valvular mineralization should raise suspicion for Bartonella endocarditis, because mineralization is uncommonly associated with endocarditis caused by other bacteria. 61 Small bacilli may be seen within lesions with silver stains or immunohistochemical stains for B. henselae. 26, 27, 60 Silver stains must be interpreted with caution, because necrotic debris and nuclear material can mimic positive staining. Gross lesions in the dog with peliosis hepatis consisted of multiple, 0.1-to 0.3-cm cysts in the liver that were filled with cloudy, serosanguineous fluid. 54 The cysts were lined with endothelial cells, and there was evidence of telangiectasia scattered through other parts of the liver. Nodular granulomatous or pyogranulomatous lesions in lymphoid or other tissues (such as the liver, lymph nodes, and nasal cavity) have also been described in dogs with bartonellosis, 47, 51, 71 and nodular pyogranulomatous inflammatory lesions with intralesional bacteria were described in the myocardium and diaphragm of cats with Bartonella myocarditis and diaphragmatic myositis. 27\n\nEfficacy has not been established for any antimicrobial that could be used to eliminate Bartonella bacteremia in cats or dogs. In humans, doxycycline, erythromycin, and rifampin are the most frequently recommended antimicrobials for treatment of Bartonella infection, but clinical improvement has been reported after the use of penicillin, gentamicin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, or azithromycin. Treatment for 2 weeks is recommended for immunocompetent patients (e.g., for CSD), and for a minimum of 6 weeks in immunocompromised humans. Relapses in bacteremia, fever, or other disease manifestations have been reported in immunocompromised humans, despite a 6-week treatment regimen. The prognosis for Bartonella endocarditis in dogs and cats is generally poor. Supportive care and medications such as furosemide to manage congestive heart failure are often required. A combination of a \u03b2-lactam and an aminoglycoside or doxycycline is recommended for treatment of Bartonella endocarditis in human patients, and valve replacement is usually indicated (see Chapter 86). 72 Oral antimicrobial alternatives for dogs that are stable include high-dose doxycycline, alone or in combination with rifampin; azithromycin; or fluoroquinolones, alone or in combination with amoxicillin (Table 52-5). Resistance of B. henselae to azithromycin and fluoroquinolones has been documented. 73 Data from experimentally or naturally infected cats indicate that a high dose of doxycycline may be necessary to eliminate Bartonella infection in cats. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid may also be an appropriate choice for treatment of infected cats when a definitive diagnosis is not known. If there is no response after 7 days, a change to a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin could be considered. 67 Extreme care should be taken to avoid scratches or bites when administering drugs to bacteremic cats.\n\nThere are no vaccines for prevention of bartonellosis in cats or dogs. Bartonella evades the host immune system and establishes a persistent intracellular infection. Dogs and cats can be coinfected with multiple different Bartonella species and genotypes. Vaccination and challenge with the same or different Bartonella species results in variable protection, and protection is generally species specific. [74] [75] [76] Prevention Prevention of Bartonella infections in cats and dogs is best accomplished by avoiding exposure to arthropod vectors. Flea control measures, such as use of ectoparasiticides, can interrupt transmission of B. henselae among cats and should be maintained year-round. 67, 77 Housing cats indoors may also reduce exposure to fleas. B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae have been transmitted through inoculation of infected cat blood; therefore, cats of unknown Bartonella status or cats that are positive by culture, serology, and/or PCR for Bartonella should be excluded as blood donor cats.\n\nCats are the major reservoirs for B. henselae, the principal cause of CSD in immunocompetent humans. CSD is characterized by formation of a pustule at the site of inoculation (a cat scratch) within 14 days, followed by development of local lymphadenopathy and malaise 1 to 3 weeks after the scratch (or bite), which can persist for weeks to months. Most cases of CSD are self-limiting after several months and respond minimally to antimicrobial drug treatment. Occasionally CSD is complicated by other disorders such as encephalopathy, relapsing bacteremia, osteomyelitis, neuroretinitis, or endocarditis, which require antimicrobial drug treatment. Vasculoproliferative diseases such as bacillary peliosis (e.g., peliosis hepatis) and bacillary angiomatosis ( Figure 52-7) are among the most common complications in immunocompromised humans. 20 Young cats are most often implicated in transmission to humans, because young cats are more likely to be bacteremic than older cats. Dogs are less likely to act as reservoirs for human disease when compared with cats, because the prevalence of Bartonella infection and the magnitude of bacteremia in dogs are lower than that in cats. Nevertheless, dogs have occasionally been implicated in transmission of Bartonella to humans through bite wounds or scratches, and to date, all Bartonella species identified in sick dogs are also pathogenic or potentially pathogenic in humans. Immunocompromised humans should preferably choose adult, well-socialized cats over kittens as pets and should be properly educated in regard to the need for flea prevention. Cats' claws should be trimmed regularly, but there is no evidence that declawing prevents transmission. Animal scratches or bites should be avoided, and if they occur, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water, after which prompt medical attention should be sought. The Guidelines for Preventing Opportunistic Infections among HIV-Infected Persons (United States Public Health Service and Infectious Diseases Society of America) state \"No evidence indicates any benefits to cats or their owners from routine culture or serologic testing of the pet for Bartonella infection.\" 78 There is also no antimicrobial drug treatment that reliably eliminates bacteremia from cats, and administration of antimicrobial drugs to cats may result in unnecessary bites, scratches, and contact with cat saliva. Pros and cons for the testing of healthy cats for Bartonella infection are shown in Box 52-2. 67 Bartonella has the potential to be transmitted to veterinarians as a result of scratches or bite wounds as well as needlestick injuries. 79, 80 Because of the high prevalence of Bartonella bacteremia in stray and young cats, veterinarians should take care to avoid these injuries (consider use of sedation whenever possible if necessary), thoroughly wash wounds that occur, and seek medical attention early if necessary. Gloves should be worn if skin contact with animal blood or saliva is anticipated.\n\nAlthough cats and dogs are important reservoirs of Bartonella, humans can also develop bartonellosis through other routes of transmission, such as via other arthropods and possibly through blood transfusions. 81 Human body lice primarily transmit B. quintana among humans (especially the homeless), which causes relapsing fever (trench fever) and endocarditis. Treatment: Pesto was treated with l-lysine (500 mg PO q12h), for possible FHV-1 infection, and doxycycline (10 mg/kg PO q24h, immediately followed by a bolus of water), for possible chlamydiosis or mycoplasmosis. The owner could not administer the l-lysine, only the doxycycline, and reported improvement in Pesto's activity level and appetite several days after starting the doxycycline.\n\nAdditional Diagnostics and Outcome: Pesto was evaluated again 2 weeks later for possible lymph node aspiration or biopsy under sedation. Abdo minal ultrasound showed persistent abdominal lymphadenomegaly. Cytologic examination of an ultrasound-guided aspirate of a mesenteric lymph node revealed mild to moderate lymphoid reactivity. Plasma cells were increased in number and were admixed throughout the specimen with rare mast cells and eosinophils. Low numbers of vacuolated macrophages and nondegenerate neutrophils were also observed. RT-PCR for feline coronavirus RNA on the lymph node aspirate was negative. IFA serology for antibodies to B. clarridgeiae was negative, whereas serology for antibodies to B. henselae was positive at 1:64. B. henselae was cultured from the blood. Treatment was changed from doxycycline to azithromycin, and again there was mild improvement in Pesto's attitude. However, several days later the cat became lethargic again, and her appetite decreased further. Comments: Bartonella infection in this cat was initially suspected because of fever and lymphadenopathy, and infection with B. henselae was confirmed with Bartonella culture. Ultimately, an alternate diagnosis (FIP) was made based on the presence of the combination of marked hyperglobulinemia, a very high feline coronavirus titer, and histopathology of a mesenteric lymph node and IHC for coronavirus antigen. There was also minimal response to antimicrobial drugs with activity against Bartonella. Thus, the Bartonella bacteremia was an incidental finding. Bartonella bacteremia was detected in the face of doxycycline treatment, which highlights the fact that antimicrobial drug treatment does not always clear bacteremia. The cat was fractious and the owner could not effectively administer the l-lysine twice daily, but assured the veterinarian that Pesto had received the doxycycline. The owner may have been exposed to Bartonella during treatment. Treatment with azithromycin was followed by a single negative culture, but antibody titers increased, so the Bartonella infection may have been relatively recent."}
