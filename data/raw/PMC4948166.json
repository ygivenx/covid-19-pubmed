{"title": "Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic: What Can the World Learn and Not Learn from West Africa?", "body": "With the death of the first patient in the US, subsequent infection of the nurses who cared for him, and the fears that more infections lay ahead, the US, and overall healthcare system in the Western world, has come at the center of global scrutiny and debate. For the US and Spain, the events around the EVD cases have raised fundamental questions about the preparedness of the healthcare systems in advanced countries to handle the EVD epidemic, should that occur, despite the rhetorical presentation of their sophistication and invincibility. In Spain, federal authorities have asked for explanations on how the nurse contracted the virus.[3] In the US, the Ebola patient was released from hospital even after he reported that he had travelled from Liberia only to be readmitted when his condition worsened. Hospital and health officials have scrambled to advance such reasons ranging from human error, software malfunction, down to the assertion, in some quarters, that the patient was turned away because he did not have health insurance\u2014the traditional gateway to getting into the healthcare system in the US.[4]\n\nAs part of its response, the US has deployed a contingent of about 4,400 soldiers to the affected West African countries to help them in setting up healthcare facilities to treat Ebola patients. The fact that these soldiers were deployed by the President without the usual political arguments demonstrates the magnitude of risk perception among US law makers of the epidemic. The US has also instituted increased screening for airline passengers in the US and Africa,[13] a practice that had been in place since the outbreak started by the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, and Nigeria. The US has also dispatched a team of public health officials to learn how Africa\u2019s most-populous country, Nigeria, and Senegal, among the world\u2019s poorest nation, were able to mitigate the spread of the virus in their countries.[14] The US spends far more on healthcare than the Ebola-hit West African countries combined (see Table 1/Figure 1). The fact that the US is learning from Nigeria and Senegal is instructive.\n\nNonetheless, the turn of events with the Ebola outbreak and matters arising therefrom raise a number of issues pertinent to our past and ongoing knowledge of global health.\n\nFirst, from the Ebola virus we must learn that there is no geographic monopoly of the fountain of knowledge. Learning can come from anywhere: the global South can teach the global North something. In 2011, when the International Journal of MCH and AIDS (IJMA) was established, one of the driving forces behind the nascent academic journal was predicated upon the fact that there is no geographic supremacy in the fountain of knowledge. IJMA was founded to be \u201ca fertile ground to cultivate a global intellectual coalition to highlight the issues in hinterlands of developing countries.\u201d[15] It is interesting that the US is sending health experts to Nigeria, the global South, to learn from their experience on handling the EVD outbreak. This development buttresses the impetus for knowledge sharing across the geographic boundaries of global North and South.\n\nSecond, the outbreak teaches us that public and population health can no longer be defined in terms of national boundaries. There is no longer a global or local/national health. Global health is local health. It is often disappointing to come across public health experts, policy makers, or academics, who put an artificial divide between population health for those living within and those living beyond their national shores. The realities of the current Ebola epidemic and past disease outbreaks such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome), Bird flu (H5N1 Avian flu), BSE (aka the mad cow disease), etc., present some of the profound reasons to agree that \u201clocal health is global health\u201d and \u201cglobal health is local health.\u201d This theme has not been lost in human ideologies. In 1969, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the first International Health Regulations (IHR), the all-hands-on system designed to prevent national public health emergencies from becoming international crises. The present Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), while implementing the IHR strive to pool human and technical resources in member states from the global North and South.\n\nThird, the handling, or mishandling, of the outbreak both in the developing and the developed world teaches us the critical importance of putting the \u201cP\u201d (public) back in public health. It is very often that we see policy makers and public health officials deal with public health issues in the abstract, reeling out mere numbers, policies and layers of guidance, but unfortunately relegating to the background, the public which is the very essence of public and population health. As depicted in the US experience, a sophisticated healthcare system is important in handling an outbreak such as Ebola, but it is not a panacea to dealing with the attendant manageable fallouts of a rapidly unfolding outbreak. The people are. Nigeria\u2019s ability to mitigate the catastrophic outbreak in Africa\u2019s most-populous country was benchmarked on the nation\u2019s ability to mobilize the entire citizenry to participate in the national effort, a practice referred to in the language of epidemiologists as \u201ccontact tracing.\u201d While the country was battling the outbreak, every citizen became the guard and guardian of the entire society.\n\nNigeria\u2019s example typifies a community united in a fight against an outbreak with all that it has in its arsenal. People reported those in their neighborhoods who showed signs of EVD and asked them to seek medical help. People were part of the overall \u201ccontact tracing\u201d by using text messages to contact health officials. The role of the people was so instrumental that, at one time, the country was agog with the notion of a cure for EVD by \u201cbathing with salt.\u201d The fake cure started from a message sent out a local traditional ruler to his by subjects. This single communication went viral on the social media and everyone was bathing with salt water to prevent and or cure EVD. Even as unscientific as this incident is, the fact that this practice went viral within a few hours bears testimony to the level of communal sharing between people, friends, families, colleagues and even strangers during such emergency. This is the \u201cP\u201d in public health in action. It is this \u201cP\u201d in public health that the western health officials must learn from their Nigerian and Senegalese counterparts.[16, 17]\n\nIt is easy to pontificate and write pages of protocols on how to handle a public health emergency. But the reality and effectiveness of planning is only evaluated when a healthcare system is confronted by the magnitude of an outbreak such as Ebola. Only then can we see the shortcomings of human planning vis-\u00e0-vis implementation and the need to understand that global health is local health, that the world can learn from each other, and finally that there is an urgent need to put the \u201cP\u201d back in public and population health. Even as it puts in place multiple strategies to address the Ebola in the country, the US, and other developed countries, must learn from history and resist attempts to use the outbreak to further alienate minorities and immigrant communities within their shores. As the world\u2019s global leader, the US must not allow what happened in its dealing with the first Ebola virus disease patient to repeat itself and or obliterate its efforts to address racial and ethnic disparities in health.[18]\n\nThe numerous missteps, misspeaks, and misdeeds of the public health system in the handling of the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the US and the western countries must stop. An efficient public health system must be color and status-blind and offer equal opportunities to all peoples regardless of their nationalities, racial/ethnic, or economic or social conditions.[6,7] For example, the governments must engage the public especially minorities, population characterized health disparities, and front line healthcare workers and reassure them that it is rolling out concrete steps to handle the outbreak. The public health system must take immediate actions to stem its failings in the handling of this volatile virus and its aftermath which is quickly eroding and putting a wedge in the public\u2019s trust of the entire public health system. Above all, the global health community, led by the\n\nWorld Health Organization, must urge wealthy nations to afford equal access and opportunities to public health and clinical trials products to all peoples within their shores irrespective of ability, or socioeconomic status."}
