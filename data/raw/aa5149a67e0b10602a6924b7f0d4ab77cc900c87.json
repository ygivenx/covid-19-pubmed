Dynamic clinical samples including nasal swabs, blood, fecal, urine, saliva and tears were collected from each patient for surveillance. What's more, we recorded synchronous clinical and epidemiologic information with oral consent. Total RNA was extracted from clinical samples and we performed RT-PCR tests targeting SARS-CoV-2. The continuous variants were described by mean when they conform to Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\n\nWe did analysis of Chi-square tests and Mann-Whitney tests to compare differences among groups. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses and figures were conducted using the Stata 14 and GraphPad Prism 8.\n\nFrom Table 1 , the thirty-two patients include eight ICU and twenty-four non-ICU patients, their age ranged from 34-54 years old. A proportion of 43.8% (14/32) patients were from Wuhan and none come back from other cities of Hubei province.\n\nThree patients had not been to Hubei province but infected by people from Hubei.\n\nNine of thirty-two patients were identified as family clustered infection. Seven patients had no clear contact history. For the enrolled patients, 40.6% (13/32) of them carried underlying diseases, of which the common diseases were hypertension (5 patients) and diabetes (4 patients). The average onset days was five days and the most common initial symptom was cough (75. 0%, 24/32). Surprisingly, only 53.1% (17/32) patients presented with fever in the beginning. The other symptoms encompassed fatigue, headache, diarrhea, sore throat, muscular soreness and anhelation. Four patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 without symptoms.\n\nAs indicated by RT-PCR results, we obtained positive rate and nucleic acid conversion time of different samples in ICU and non-ICU patients. The positive rate of nasal swab in these patients was 100.0% (32/32) and three patients experienced negative result at the first tests. The positive rate of saliva (78.1%, 25/32)was significantly higher than that of tears (15.6%, 5/32) in enrolled patients (p<0.001). All the urine samples from thirty-two patients were negative. In the tests of blood, the positive rate was 87.5% (7/8) in ICU and 66.7% (16/24) in non-ICU patients respectively.\n\nWhat's more, we performed consecutive analyses of nasal swab, blood and saliva in non-ICU and ICU groups. As shown in Figure 1A , the nucleic acid conversion time (from positive to negative) of SARS-CoV-2 of nasal swab was significantly longer than that of blood (p=0.000) and saliva (p=0.05). Though shorter time of conversion in blood samples than saliva was observed, no significant p value was detected What's more, in our study, we categorized patients into two groups: ICU and non-ICU. In ICU patients, the conversion time of blood, nasal and saliva sample all exceeded two weeks, illustrating a relatively longer period than non-ICU patients.\n\nThese differences of conversion time in ICU and non-ICU patients might be correlated with virus load, severity and invasive operations of patients.\n\nIn conclusion, our study originally illustrated that nasal swab samples consumed more time to turn negative than blood and saliva samples. What's more, nucleic acid conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 in ICU patients was longer than that of non-ICU patients, especially nasal swab samples. A combination tests of different samples might provide us with further information concerning the transmission characteristics of COVID-19 patients.\n\nAll authors report no potential conflict of interest.
