{"title": "Live-attenuated bivalent measles virus-derived vaccines targeting Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus induce robust and multifunctional T cell responses against both viruses in an appropriate mouse model", "body": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a member of the Coronaviridae family and emerged in 2012 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Zaki et al., 2012) . Coronaviruses typically cause mild infections of the upper respiratory tract, but already in 2002, the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) with a mortality rate of about 10% among infected patients was introduced in the human population. SARS-CoV spread world-wide and caused more than 8000 diagnosed infections, but was contained within a year after its emergence (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/ en/).\n\nIn contrast, infections with MERS-CoV are ongoing for more than 5 years, with 2103 laboratory-confirmed cases distributed over 27 countries with at least 733 deaths that were reported to the WHO by November 2017 (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). This apparent case-fatality rate of 35% is of grave concern, because epidemic spread as has been observed for SARS-CoV could result in a disastrous death toll. MERS-CoV has been introduced zoonotically by transmission from dromedary camels to human patients (Alagaili et al., 2014; Haagmans et al., 2014; Reusken et al., 2013a) and serological studies indicate wide-spread and early distribution among this animal host (Alagaili et al., 2014; Reusken et al., 2013b) . Therefore, a continuous risk of transmission especially to persons in close contact to camels is evident. Fortunately, the human to human transmission rate has remained low. Aside of individuals with regular contact to camels, only health care workers or relatives of MERS-CoV patients have a considerable risk of infection (Alraddadi et al., 2016; Drosten et al., 2014) , but still at a modest level. Nonetheless, the high case fatality rate, the recurrent outbreaks of MERS-CoV infections, and especially the risk of virus adaptation potentially resulting in epidemic or even pandemic spread make the development of an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV an international priority.\n\nThe efficacy of several vaccine candidates has been demonstrated in different animal models up to even dromedary camels (reviewed in (Okba et al., 2017) ). One of these candidates, MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) (Malczyk et al., 2015) , is based on the measles virus (MV) vaccine platform technology (M\u00fchlebach, 2017) , and encodes the MERS-CoV spike protein (S) as an additional antigen in the backbone of recombinant MV vac2 (del Valle et al., 2007) resembling vaccine strain Moraten that is authorized and in use in the US since 1968. This candidate induces both robust humoral and functional cellular immuneresponses against MERS-CoV. Moreover, MERS-CoV viral load and inflammation of the lung were significantly reduced in challenged mice that had been vaccinated with MV vac2 -MERS-S(H), before (Malczyk et al., 2015) .\n\nWhile these experiments provided proof of concept for efficacy of this vaccine candidate, further mechanistic insights into the nature of the induced T cell responses remain to be elucidated. These are of special interest, since it has been shown that T cells are essential for clearance of the infection (Coleman et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2014) : Depletion of CD8 + T cells increased overall inflammation, bronchiolar inflammation, lymphocyte infiltration, and pleuritis at day 7 post-infection in mice (Coleman et al., 2017) , while MERS CoV-susceptible mice depleted of all T cells were unable to clear the virus . As an alternative to the spike glycoprotein, conserved (internal) structural proteins such as the nucleocapsid protein N are of special interest as putative target of anti-viral T cell responses to be triggered by future MERS vaccines .\n\nTherefore, we have also generated and characterized MERS-CoV N protein-encoding vaccine candidates based on the MV vac2 vaccine platform, in this study. To further characterize the induction of MERS CoV-specific immune responses, we first analyzed the necessity for viral replication for the induction of MERS CoV-and MV-specific immune responses using the highly immunogenic MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) vaccine candidate. In addition, we characterized the functionality of CD8 + and CD4 + T cell responses in juvenile (6-12 week old) and adult (7 months of age) mice using flow cytometry and functional assays.\n\nVero (African green monkey kidney) (ATCC# CCL-81) and 293 T (ATCC CRL-3216) cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Biowest, Nuaill\u00e9, France) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and 2 mM L-glutamine (L-Gln; Biochrom). JAWSII dendritic cells (ATCC CRL-11904) were purchased from ATCC and cultured in MEM-\u03b1 with ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides (GIBCO BRL, Eggenstein, Germany) supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM L-Gln, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Biochrom), and 5 ng/mL murine GM-CSF (Peprotech, Hamburg, Germany). DC2.4 murine dendritic cells (Shen et al., 1997) were cultured in RPMI containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Gln, 1% non-essential aminoacids (Biochrom), 10 mM HEPES (pH 7,4), and 50 \u03bcM 2-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). Cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 6% CO 2 for a maximum of 6 months of culture after thawing of the original stock.\n\nThe codon-optimized gene encoding MERS-CoV-N (Genebank accession no. JX869059) flanked with AatII/MluI binding sites in plasmid pMA-RQ-MERS-N was obtained by gene synthesis (Invitrogen Life Technology, Regensburg, Germany). The antigen and the immediate early cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (Martin et al., 2006) were inserted into plasmids p(+)BR-MV vac2 -ATU(P) (del Valle et al., 2007) or p(+)MV vac2 -GFP(H) via MluI/AatII and SfiI/SacII, respectively, to generate p(+)PolII-MV vac2 -MERS-N(P) or p(+)PolII-MV vac2 -MERS-N (H). For construction of lentiviral transfervectors encoding MERS-CoV-N, the ORF of MERS-N was amplified by PCR with primers encompassing flanking restriction sites NheI/XhoI and template pMA-RQ-MERS-N. Details on primers and PCR are available upon request. PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen Life Technology) and fully sequenced. Intact antigen ORF was cloned into pCSCW2gluc-IRES-GFP (Hewett et al., 2007) using NheI/XhoI restriction sites to yield pCSCW2-MERS-N-IRES-GFP.\n\nLentiviral vectors were produced and used for the generation of antigen-expressing dendritic cell lines as described, before (Malczyk et al., 2015) . In short, HIV-1-derived vectors were generated using a standard 3 plasmid system and the transfer vector plasmid pCSCW2-MERS-N-IRES-GFP by PEI transfection. Subsequent purification after harvest of transfected 293 T cells yielded virus stocks used to transduce DC cell lines, which were single cell-sorted by FACS and selected for antigen expression.\n\nMERS-N encoding vaccine candidates MV vac2 -MERS-N(P) and MV vac2 -MERS-N(H) were rescued as described (Malczyk et al., 2015; Martin et al., 2006) . Single syncytia were picked and overlaid onto 50% confluent Vero cells cultured in 6-well plates and harvested as \"passage 0\" (P0) by scraping and freeze-thaw cycle of cells at the time of maximal infection. Subsequent passages were generated as described for the following viruses. MERS-N encoding vaccine viruses in P3 were used for characterization, viruses in P4 for vaccination. MERS-S encoding vaccine virus MV vac2 -MERS-S(H), and control virus MV vac2 -ATU(P) (Malczyk et al., 2015) were also used in P4 for vaccination. Both as well as MV vac2 -GFP(P) and MERS-CoV (isolate EMC/2012) (Zaki et al., 2012) used for neutralization assays were propagated and titrated on Vero cells by the method of Spearman and Kaerber (Hubert, 1984; K\u00e4rber, 1931) . MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) was inactivated by UV-irradiation using a CL-1000 UV crosslinker (UVP, Cambridge, UK). 100 \u03bcL of virus suspension in 48-well-plates on ice were exposed to UV light of 254 nm at 3 cm distance from the UV source of 1,85 \u00d7 10 5 \u03bcJ/cm 2 for 30 min. Inactivation of virus was controlled by incubation of Vero cells with a control aliquot inactivated, in parallel. All virus stocks were stored in aliquots at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nCells were lysed and immunoblotted as previously described (Funke et al., 2008) . A rabbit anti-MERS-CoV serum (1:1000) was used as primary antibody for MERS-CoV-N and a rabbit anti-MV-N polyclonal antibody (1:25,000) (Abcam) for MV-N detection. A donkey HRP-coupled anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) polyclonal antibody (1:10,000) (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) served as secondary antibody for both. Peroxidase activity was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) on Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany).\n\nAll animal experiments were carried out in compliance with the regulations of German animal protection laws and as authorized by the RP Darmstadt. Six-to 12-week-old or 7 months old IFNAR -/--CD46Ge mice (Mrkic et al., 1998) deficient for type I IFN receptor and transgenically expressing human CD46 were inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 of recombinant viruses or UV-inactivated vaccine preparations on days 0 and either on day 21 or 28. Mice were bled on days 0, 28, and 49 post initial infection (p.i.). Serum samples were stored at \u2212 20\u00b0C. Mice were euthanized on days 32, 42, or 49 p.i., and splenocytes were harvested for assessment of cellular immune responses.\n\nQuantification of VNTs was done as described, before (Malczyk et al., 2015) . In brief, mouse sera were serially diluted in 2-fold dilution steps in DMEM in duplicates. A total of 50 PFU of MV vac2 -GFP(P) or 200 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV (strain EMC/2012) were mixed with diluted sera and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Virus suspensions were added to 1 \u00d7 10 4 Vero cells seeded 4 h prior to assay in 96-well plates and incubated for 4 days at 37\u00b0C. VNTs were calculated as the reciprocal of the highest mean dilution that abolished infection.\n\nMurine gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays (eBioscience, Frankfurt, Germany) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using multiscreen immunoprecipitation (IP) ELISpot polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) 96well plates (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). 5 \u00d7 10 5 isolated Medium inoculated mice served as mock control. VNTs were calculated as the highest dilution abolishing infectivity. Dots represent single animals (n = 6); horizontal lines represent mean per group. The y-axis starts at the detection limit; all mice at the detection limit had no detectable VNT.

(Right) To analyze cellular responses directed against MV, splenocytes were stimulated with 10 \u03bcg/mL MV bulk antigen (MV bulk) or left unstimulated (sham). The reactivity of splenocytes was confirmed by ConA treatment (10 \u03bcg/mL). TCID 50 , tissue culture infectious dose 50; One-way-ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison. *: p < 0,05; **: p < 0,01; ***: p < 0001; ****: p < 0,0001. splenocytes were co-cultured with different stimuli in 200 \u03bcL RPMI + 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Gln, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 36 h. For re-stimulation of MERS N-specific T cells, splenocytes were co-cultivated with 5 \u00d7 10 4 JAWSII, DC2.4 dendritic cells, or clones of either cell line encoding MERS-N. On the other hand, splenocytes were stimulated with 10 \u03bcg/mL MV bulk antigen (Serion Immunologics, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany), 10 \u03bcg/mL MERS S-derived peptide S1165 (Biosynthesis Inc., Lewisville, TX, USA, (Channappanavar et al., 2014) ), or 10 \u03bcg/mL SIINFEKL control peptide (SIN) of ovalbumin (aa 257-264) (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA), as appropriate. For general T cell stimulation, 10 \u03bcg/mL Concanavalin A (ConA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used. As negative control, splenocytes were left untreated. After 36 h, cells were removed from the plates, and plates were incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-IFN-\u03b3 antibodies and avidin-HRP according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3-Amino-9ethyl-carbazole (AEC; Sigma-Aldrich) substrate solution for development of spots was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions using AEC dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (Merck Millipore) and used for peroxidase-dependent staining, afterwards. Spots were counted using an Eli.Scan ELISpot scanner (AE.L.VIS, Hamburg, Germany) and ELISpot analysis software Eli.Analyse V5.0 (AE.L.VIS).\n\nFor flow cytometry-based determination of cytokine expression by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), splenocytes of vaccinated mice were isolated, and 2 \u00d7 10 6 splenocytes per mouse were cultivated in 200 \u03bcL RPMI1640 + 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Gln, 1 \u00d7 non-essential amino acids (Biochrom), 10 mM HEPES, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 50 \u03bcM \u03b2mercaptoethanol, 10 \u03bcg/mL Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich), and one of the stimuli also used for ELISpot analysis. For general T cell stimulation, 0.25 \u03bcg/mL tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA, Sigma Aldrich) and 0.5 \u03bcg/mL Ionomycin (Iono, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as positive control, and only medium was used as negative control. Splenocytes were stimulated for 5 h at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, cells were stained with fixable viability dye eFluor450 (eBioscience), CD4-PE (1:2000) (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), CD8-FITC (1:500) (BD), and, after permeabilization with Fixation/Permeabilization Solution (BD) and Perm/ Wash Buffer (BD), stained with IFN-\u03b3-APC (1:500) (BD) and TNF-\u03b1-Pe-Cy7 (1:500) (BD). Cells were fixed with ice-cold 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and analyzed via flow cytometry using an LSRII SORP flow cytometer (BD) and FCS Express software (De Novo Software, Glendale, CA, USA).\n\nSince the nucleocapsid protein (N) of CoV is quite conserved, it is regarded as an appropriate target to induce anti-viral T cells. Therefore, MERS-CoV N was chosen as an alternative antigen to be expressed by the recombinant MV vaccine platform. Full-length MERS-N was cloned into two different additional transcription units (ATUs) either behind P (post P) or H (post H) cassettes of measles vaccine strain MV vac2 genome, and virus clones were successfully rescued and amplified in Vero cells with titers of up to 2 \u00d7 10 8 TCID 50 /mL. The essential verification of antigen expression by Western blot analysis of Vero cells infected with the MV vac2 -MERS-N vaccines revealed expression of the N antigen with only little impact of the genomic position of the transgene cassette (Fig. 1A) , while growth kinetics showed no impairment of virus replication compared to the respective MV vac2 -GFP(P) control virus ( Fig. 1 B, C) .\n\nTo test the efficacy of the MV vac2 -MERS-N candidate in vivo, genetically modified IFNAR -/--CD46Ge mice were chosen, since they are the prime small animal model for analysis of MV-derived vaccines (Mrkic et al., 1998) . Thus, 6 mice per group were inoculated via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route on days 0 and 28 with each time 1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 of MV vac2 -MERS-N(P), MV vac2 -MERS-N(H), or empty control virus MV vac2 -ATU(P). Medium-inoculated mice served as negative controls. 21 days or four days after boost immunization, sera or splenocytes of immunized mice were sampled, respectively (Fig. 1D) . As expected, all mice immunized with recombinant MV (including the control virus) developed high MV virus neutralizing titers (VNT) (512-2048 VNT, Fig. 1F ). Little evidence for induction of neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV was found in all mice, as expected for the intra-particular antigen (Fig. 1E) . No VNTs against MV or MERS-CoV were detected in control mice inoculated with medium alone.\n\nTo analyze splenocytes of animals vaccinated with MV vac2 -MERS-N (H) or control animals inoculated with medium or MV vac2 -ATU(P) by ELISpot assay for antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3 secretion, the antigen-specific T cells were re-stimulated in vitro by syngeneic murine DC cell lines (JAWSII and DC2.4), which had been genetically modified by lentiviral vector transduction to stably express MERS-N protein and thereby to present the respective T cell epitopes on MHC. Single cell clones were derived by flow cytometric sorting of single GFP-positive cells. Antigen expression by transduced DCs was verified by Western Blot analysis (data not shown). ELISpot assays using splenocytes of vaccinated animals in co-culture with JAWSII-MERS-N or DC2.4-MERS-N revealed about 200 IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells per 1 \u00d7 10 6 splenocytes after immunization with MV vac2 -MERS-N(H) (Fig. 1G) , which was significant over controls. Additionally, cellular immune responses targeting MV antigens were detected upon stimulation with MV bulk antigens in vaccinated mice that had received any recombinant virus, as expected. However, MV bulk antigens stimulated about 930-1500 IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells per 1 \u00d7 10 6 splenocytes of MV vaccinated animals, as described, before (Malczyk et al., 2015) . Finally, splenocytes of all mice revealed a similar basic reactivity to unspecific T cell stimulation, as confirmed by similar numbers of IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells upon ConA treatment (Fig. 1G) . Thus, the generated MV-based vaccine platform expressing MERS-N induces significant MERS N-specific cellular immune responses, as desired. In any case, humoral and cellular responses induced by vaccine candidate MV vac2 -MERS-S had been considerably higher in previous analyses under similar conditions (Malczyk et al., 2015) . Therefore, further characterization of anti-MERS-CoV immunity induced by MV vac2 -derived vaccines proceeded with this MERS-S encoding vaccine candidate, which yielded approximately 5-fold higher numbers of reactive T cells after vaccination.\n\nSince the MERS vaccine candidate MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) induced robust protective humoral and cellular immune responses in IFNAR -/--CD46Ge mice (Malczyk et al., 2015) , we were interested in the necessity of viral replication of this life-attenuated vaccine for the induction of MERS CoV-specific immunity. For these analyses IFNAR -/--CD46Ge mice were chosen as the animal model, again, since these mice are the standard animal model for analysis of MV-derived vaccines (M\u00fchlebach, 2017) , their genetic composition is compatible with an established MERS-CoV challenge model , as shown, before (Malczyk et al., 2015) , and their size allows housing under regularly available conditions opposed to dromedary camels, the only know natural host of MERS-CoV, to date.\n\nAs all morbilliviruses, the MV-based vaccine virions are highly cellassociated, and transfer of antigenic protein within the vaccine preparation cannot be excluded. Therefore, we vaccinated these MV-susceptible mice with either 1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 of live or of the same formulation and quantity UV-inactivated MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) in a primeboost regimen ( Fig. 2A) . MV vac2 -ATU(P), which does not encode any additional antigen, was included as vector control. Blood was drawn from na\u00efve mice on day 0 before vaccination, and on days 28 and 49 post-immunization. Serum samples were tested for their ability to neutralize MV vac2 -GFP(P) (Fig. 2B , D, F) or MERS-CoV (Fig. 2C, E, G) . Sera of na\u00efve mice had no neutralizing antibodies against either virus (Fig. 2B, C) . After the first immunization, both live virus preparations induced neutralizing antibodies against MV, with MV vac2 -ATU(P) triggering significantly higher titers (1280-1920 VNT) than MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) (480-640 VNT). After the second immunization, anti-MV VNTs increased to titers of 640-2560 in both cohorts. In contrast, only one out of four animals in the UV-inactivated vaccine group had a borderline neutralizing antibody titer of 20 after the first immunization, and another animal had a titer of 30 after the boost. While MV vac2 -ATU(P) and the UV-inactivated MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) vaccine did not induce neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV above background levels over the course of the experiment, the group vaccinated with live MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) developed titers around 50 after the first immunization and 40-320 (mean of 300) after the boost. Taken together, these data reveal that replication of the vaccine is necessary to induce functional antibody responses against MV and the additional antigen MERS-S.\n\nTo assess the capacity of the different MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) vaccine preparations to induce MERS-CoV S-specific cellular immune responses, splenocytes of mice, which had already been tested for humoral responses ( Fig. 2A) , were isolated and analyzed 49 days after immunization for antigen(Ag)-dependent IFN-\u03b3 secretion using ELISpot assay. The isolated splenocytes were re-stimulated with MERS-S immunodominant peptide S1165 (Channappanavar et al., 2014) or MV bulk antigen (MV bulk) to analyze MV-specific cellular immune responses. Ovalbumin-derived SIINFEKL-peptide (SIN) served as peptide negative control, or cells were left untreated (mock). Stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA) was used to confirm general T cell reactivity in splenocyte preparations (Fig. 2H) . While splenocytes of all mice responded to ConA with 1000 to 1500 spots per 1 \u00d7 10 6 splenocytes, only those from animals vaccinated with live MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) could be stimulated with MERS S-specific peptide S1165 reaching mean values of 1040 spots per 1 \u00d7 10 6 splenocytes. In contrast, splenocytes of the UV-inactivated group or control virus MV vac2 -ATU(P) could not be restimulated to secrete IFN-\u03b3. Furthermore, only replication-competent vaccine viruses induced MV-specific cellular immune responses in vaccinated mice. Re-stimulation with MV bulk Ag induced a mean of 800 and 970 spots per 1 \u00d7 10 6 splenocytes for MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) or MV vac2 -ATU(P) vaccinated mice, respectively. Consequently, replication of the vaccine candidate is essential to induce both arms of the immune system with responses against MV as well as the additional MERS-S antigen.\n\nUsually, 6-12 weeks old juvenile mice are used for our MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in sera of (B, C) na\u0457ve mice, or in sera of mice after (D, E) prime-or (F, G) boost-immunization.

IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot analysis using splenocytes of mice vaccinated on days 0 and 28 with indicated vaccines isolated 21 days after boost immunization and after incubation with indicated stimuli (MERS-S peptide S1165, MV bulk antigen (MV bulk), immunodominant ovalbumin-derived SIINF-EKL-peptide (SIN) as a peptide negative control) or untreated (mock). The reactivity of splenocytes was confirmed by Concanavalin A (ConA) treatment (10 \u03bcg/mL).

To evaluate if there is an age-dependent change in vaccination efficacy, approximately 7 months-old mice were vaccinated with MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) in a prime-boost vaccination scheme with 3 weeks between prime and boost vaccination (Fig. 3A ). Mice were sacrificed at day 42 post-immunization, and splenocytes were re-stimulated with MV-antigens or MERS-S peptide S1165. We found that reactive IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells were also specifically induced in mice of this age (Fig. 3B) . A mean of 520 spots per 1 \u00d7 10 6 splenocytes was detected upon re-stimulation with MV bulk antigen, whereas 900 spots per 1 \u00d7 10 6 splenocytes were induced by re-stimulation with the MERS S-derived peptide S1165, illustrating that MV-and MERS-CoV-specific cellular immune responses are effectively induced in adult mice.\n\nTo gain more detailed insights in the quality of the observed T cell responses, we further characterized the responsive T cell populations by flow cytometry, determining the expression of CD8 + and CD4 + surface markers as well as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 upon re-stimulation with S1165 or MV bulk antigen. As a positive stimulus for T cell activation tetradecanoylphorbol-acetate and ionomycin (TPA/Iono) were used. Exocytosis of cytokines was blocked by addition of brefeldin A (10 \u03bcg/ mL) during stimulation. Cells were permeabilized, labelled, and fixed for flow cytometry. The gating strategy excluded duplicates (not shown), selected for living cells (Fig. 4A, upper panel) , and separated CD8 + and CD4 + T cells (Fig. 4A, lower panel) . Selected CD8 + T cells were then analyzed for their expression of IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4B left panel) , TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 4B middle panel) , or both ( Fig. 4B right panel) as exemplarily shown for splenocytes re-stimulated with MERS-S peptide S1165. Likewise, CD4 + T cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4C, left panel) , TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 4C, middle panel) , or both (Fig. 4C , right panel) are depicted after re-stimulation with MV bulk antigen.\n\nVaccination with MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) induced a significant amount of MERS S-specific CD8 + T cells expressing either IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4D, left  panel) or TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 4D, middle panel) , with means of 0.6% and 0.4% of total positive cells, respectively. Among those, a significant fraction of cells revealed to be multifunctional, with a mean of 0.3% of all CD8 + cells or 75% of the TNF-\u03b1 \u2212 responsive cells being positive for both cytokines (Fig. 4D, right panel) . Moreover, vaccination induced a significant fraction of vector-specific CD4 + T cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4E, left panel) , or TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 4E , middle panel) upon re-stimulation with MV bulk antigen. Among those, multifunctional CD4 + T cells expressing both cytokines were induced with a mean of about 0.1% (Fig. 4E, right panel) . To conclude, vaccination with MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) induces not only IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1 expressing T cells directed against MERS-CoV and MV, but also a significant fraction of multifunctional cytotoxic T cells specific for MERS-S and CD4 + T cells specific for MV antigens, illustrating that a broad and robust MERS-CoVspecific immune response is induced by vaccination with MV vac2 -MERS-S(H).\n\nIn this study, we aimed to understand the induction of immunity and the functionality of induced T cell responses after vaccination with MV vac2 -MERS-S(H), a vaccine candidate that induces protective immunity against MERS-CoV in an appropriate animal model. In parallel, we generated and tested also alternative MV-based vaccine candidates expressing MERS-CoV N protein as conserved T cell antigen. MV vac2 -MERS-N vaccine candidates indeed induced significant antigen-specific cellular immune responses in vaccinated transgenic mice, revealing that also MERS N-expression by recombinant MV may have a useful role to combat MERS-CoV. Since the immune responses induced by MERS-S expressing candidates had been nevertheless considerably higher, we proceeded with S-expressing vaccine virus to characterize the induction of anti-MERS-CoV immunity by MV-based vectors.\n\nUsing MV vac2 -MERS-S(H), robust anti-MERS CoV immune responses were induced also in older mice, while replication of the vaccine vector was necessary to induce either arm of adaptive immunity against vector or pathogen. Furthermore, vaccination with MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) triggered significant numbers of multifunctional MERS S-specific CD8 + T cells and MV-specific CD4 + T cells, simultaneously producing IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 upon stimulation with respective antigens.\n\nSince not only numbers, but also the quality of the induced MERS CoV-specific T cell responses might be relevant for protection against MERS-CoV, it is quite encouraging to see that approx. 50% of IFN-\u03b3 reactive CD8 + T cells also expressed TNF-\u03b1, whereas in reverse 75% of TNF-\u03b1-reactive CD8 + T cells co-expressed IFN-\u03b3 upon stimulation with the immune-dominant MERS-S peptide. This induction of multifunctional T cells is quite in accordance with previous studies, since the potential of MV during natural infection or the recombinant MV to induce multifunctional, antigen-specific T cells has already been demonstrated. Infection of macaques with wild-type MV induces polyfunctional T cells specific for MV proteins with increasing numbers of cells secreting IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, as well as IFN-\u03b3 over time (Nelson et al., 2017) , and polyfunctional T cells directed against MV-H can be expanded from PBMC of human donors (Ndhlovu et al., 2010) . Likewise, HIV-vaccine candidates MV1-F4, which encode Gag, RT, and Nef of an HIV-1 clade B or a clade C strain as foreign antigen, induce antigenspecific multifunctional T cells simultaneously expressing IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2 in mice and also macaques (Stebbings et al., 2013 (Stebbings et al., , 2012 . While the combination of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 indicates functional T cells Fig. 3 ) were re-stimulated and subjected to intracellular staining (ICS) for IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 and stained for extracellular T-cell markers CD4 and CD8 for flow cytometry analysis.

Duplicates (not shown) and dead cells (A) were excluded from analysis. (B, C) CD8 + and CD4 + cells were separately subjected to analysis for IFN-\u03b3-(left panels), TNF-\u03b1-(middle panels) or double-positive cells (right panels).

Dots represent individual animals, horizontal bars mean. Repeated-measures one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison. *: p < 0,05. with higher potency, in general, expression of IL-2 is a sign of the induction of CD8 + memory T cells (Williams et al., 2006) . In our study, the strong correlation of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 expression thus indicates a high functionality of induced T cell responses. Extension of the antibody panel for IL-2 detection could yield further insight into the durability of these T cell responses induced by the MV vaccine platform in future studies.\n\nSuch multifunctional CD8 + T cells specific for MERS-CoV may become especially important, since mouse studies have shown that CD8 + T cells are crucial for clearance of MERS-CoV infection (Coleman et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2014) . Noteworthy, for other viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), or cytomegalovirus (CMV) the amount of just IFN-\u03b3 producing T cells does not correlate with CTL killing effectivity, but the multifunctionality of antigen-specific T cells inversely correlated with viral load (Betts et al., 2006; Lichterfeld et al., 2004; Precopio et al., 2007; Sandberg et al., 2001) , further underlining the importance of multifunctionality.\n\nBesides these cellular immune responses, also considerable humoral immunity was induced in vaccinated animals, here. The mean VNT was somewhat lower than expected (Malczyk et al., 2015) , but still quite high. An alternative vaccine candidate derived from modified vaccinia virus Ankara, MVA-MERS-S, revealed protection in dromedary camels, the natural host for MERS-CoV (Haagmans et al., 2016) . Passive immunotherapy with dromedary immune sera significantly reduced MERS-CoV titers in lung tissue of challenged mice, starting with a VNT of 160 (Zhao et al., 2015) . Neutralizing antibody titers in reconvalescent plasma of human patients diagnosed with MERS were determined by microneutralization tests in two previous studies, and were on average at 175 (Arabi et al., 2016) or 58.3 (Zhao et al., 2017) . Furthermore, a PRNT 50 titer of at least just 50 was required to lower virus titers by more than 0.5 log in mice challenged after transfer of human reconvalescent plasma (Zhao et al., 2017) . These titers were exceeded in this study. In addition, MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) induced higher anti-MERS-S titers in C57/BL6 mice than MVA-MERS-S in Balb/c mice, when comparing studies that used similar virus titers for vaccination (Malczyk et al., 2015; Volz et al., 2015) , thus indicating an at least comparable efficacy. Thus, also VNT determined here indicate efficacy and were anyway not statistically different from those published before for MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) (Malczyk et al., 2015) . Nevertheless, the exact correlates of protection for MERS-CoV remain to be determined in future studies, since it will be essential to evaluate the efficacy of the different vaccine candidates against this most important benchmark.\n\nIn contrast, UV-inactivated MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) did not induce any antibodies able to neutralize MERS-CoV or MV. While neutralizing antibodies can in principle also be induced by inactivated vaccines or proteins, e.g. full-length or truncated MERS-S protein in combination with adjuvant (Wang et al., 2015) . Obviously, the amount of MERS-S antigen within the MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) vaccine formulation or the adjuvant effect of the inactivate were not sufficient during application. Therefore, replication of the MV-derived MERS vaccine candidate is necessary for the induction of immune responses both against vector and antigen of interest in vaccinated animals. Indeed, the induction of cellular immunity is usually more efficient by de novo expression of antigen after immunization. Consequently, the application of a replication competent vaccine platform is justified here to robustly induce potent responses of both arms of the adaptive immune system.\n\nThese powerful immune responses were not only induced in juvenile mice 6-12 weeks of age, but also in adult mice older than half a year of age. This is quite of interest, since adult vaccinees are also the target group for vaccination in response to the MERS-CoV outbreak, as defined in the target product profile by the WHO (http://www.who.int/ blueprint/what/research-development/MERS_CoV_TPP_ 15052017.pdf). Remarkably, MV vaccine strain virus encoding Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) antigens was already tested in a phase I clinical trial in adult human vaccinees (18-45 years old) (Ramsauer et al., 2015) . These adult test subjects all developed significant humoral immunity against CHIKV, despite their adult age and most interestingly also independent from measles pre-immunity.\n\nTaken together, these study shows that MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) induces surprisingly high numbers of multifunctional T cells specific for MERS-S also in adult test subjects, as a result from replication of the recombinant vector. Therefore, high quality cellular immune responses are induced in addition to the robust antibody responses by this vaccine candidate, further qualifying MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) for evaluation as vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV. In parallel, MERS-N encoding MV can be a further option to generate protection against MERS in future studies and constructs."}
