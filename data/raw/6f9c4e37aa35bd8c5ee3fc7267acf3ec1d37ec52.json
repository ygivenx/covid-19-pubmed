Since apparently normal Fallopian tubes are frequently obtained in gynaecological surgery we have studied the growth of viruses in them; we thought they might be useful in addition to, or instead of the respiratory epithelium.\n\nFallopian tubes were obtained at operation and quickly placed in cold Hanks' saline or in culture medium. Within a few hours tissue which had not been clamped or bruised was dissected out and cut into pieces about 3 mm square. These were planted or scratched areas on the bottom of a 60 mm plastic Fetri dish containing 4 ml of medium. Two pieces of tissue were used in each dish. The medium was usually that shown to be optimum in earlier studies by TY~RELL and BLA~R~ (2), namely, 0.2~o bovine plasma albumin in Eagle's medium. The dish cultures were incubated 1 In receipt of a Fellowship from the World Health Organization. 2 In receipt of a Fellowship from the Wellcome Trust.\n\nin 5% CO s in air, the tube cultures in air, and both were held at 33 ~ or at 37~ depending upon the virus tested. Cultures were only used if distinct ciliary activity was seen one or two days after they were prepared. It was found that ciliary activity ecas retained for several weeks after the cultures were set up.\n\nMost of the viruses were standard laboratory strains, but some were in the form of nasal washings collected from experimentally infected volunteers; a few were tissue culture fluids from early passages of field strains.\n\nOrgan culture fluids were mixed with an equal volume of broth and stored at --70~ as soon as ~hey were harvested. They were thawed la~er and titrated, usually by standard endpoint titrations using 10-fold dilutions in roller tube tissue cultures and two to four tubes per dilution. Influenza B was titrated in primary monkey kidney cells, adenovirus, parainfluenza and ECHO virus in L 132 cells. \n\nAltogether thirteen growth curves of varying degrees of completeness were performed. A representative example of a successful attempt to grow a virus in organ culture of Fallopian tube is shown in Fig. 1 . A volume of 0.2 ml of diluted virus was dropped onto the tissue. After about 2 hours the medium was changed 3 times to reduce the amount of unadsorbed virus. It can be seen that virus was shed into the medium and that more virus was recovered than was added. The cilia continued to beat as well in the infected cultures as in the uninoculated controls and virus continued to appear in the medium for sixteen days.\n\nThe results of further experiments of this type are shown in Table 1 . This indicates that viruses of several different biologicalgroups multiplied in the cultures. The form of the growth curves was roughly similar to that shown in Fig. 1 , but most experiments were discontinued after 7 days. It can be seen that although myxoviruses such as influenza and parainfluenza virus multiply freely as in respiratory epithelium, only one of the two rhinoviruses did so. It was rather surprising that although one enterovirus, ECHO virus type 11, multiplied a vaccine strain of poliovirus did not, even though a substantial inoculum (10 a TCDs0 ) was given. It was not surprising that the\"eoronavirus\" did not multiply since these are well known to be very fastidious organisms (3). J. CASAL, D. RUBENSTEIN, ~r VOTAVA, and D. A. J. TYRR]~LL:\n\nIn further studies we attempted to grow the virus present in clinical specimens by inoculating nasal secretions (about 0.2 ml per culture) by dropping them onto the pieces of tissue. Table 2 summarizes the results of these and the growth of rhinovirus type 2 is shown in Fig. 1 . This indicates that virus isolation from clinical specimens is possible. Rhinovirus type 2 (H.G.P.) l0 S 4. Discussion It is technically quite easy to set up cultures of Fallopian tubes, provided the tissue is not damaged at or after surgery. On the other hand, it seems to be less useful for growing a wide range of respiratory viruses than nasal or tracheal epithelium. It has been found possible to propagate mycoplasmas in similar cultures (4) ."}
