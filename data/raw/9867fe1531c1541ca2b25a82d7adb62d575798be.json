{"title": "The SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome The architecture of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome The SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome", "body": "From the full-length genomic RNA (29, 903 nt) which also serves as an mRNA, ORF1a and ORF1b are translated. In addition to the genomic RNA, nine major subgenomic RNAs are produced. The sizes of the boxes representing small accessory proteins are bigger than the actual size of the ORF for better visualization. The black box indicates leader sequence. Note that ORF10 is not included here because our data show no evidence for ORF10 expression. (Warkocki et al., 2018) . 98 In this study, we combined two complementary sequencing approaches, DRS 99 and SBS. We unambiguously mapped the sgRNAs, ORFs, and TRSs of A, Read counts from nanopore direct RNA sequencing of total RNA from Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. \"Leader+\" indicates the viral reads that contain the 5 \u2032 end leader sequence. \"No leader\" denotes the viral reads lacking the leader sequence.\n\n\"Nuclear\" reads match to mRNAs from the nuclear chromosome while \"mitochondrial\" reads are derived from the mitochondrial genome. \"Control\" indicates quality control RNA for nanopore sequencing. \n\nTo delineate the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, we first performed DRS runs on 106 a MinION nanopore sequencer using total RNA extracted from Vero cells 107 infected with SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020). The virus was 108 isolated from a patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 26, 2020, 109 after traveling from Wuhan, China (Kim et al., 2020) . We obtained 879,679 110 reads from infected cells (corresponding to a throughput of 1.9 Gb) (Figure 2A ). 111\n\nThe majority (65.4%) of the reads mapped to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that viral 112 transcripts dominate the transcriptome while the host gene expression is 113 strongly suppressed. Although nanopore DRS has the 3 \u2032 bias due to directional 114 sequencing from the 3 \u2032 -ends of RNAs, approximately half of the viral reads still 115 contained the 5 \u2032 leader.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 genome was fully covered, missing only 12 nt from the 5 \u2032 117 end ( Figure 2B ). The longest tags (111 reads) correspond to the full-length 118 gRNA ( Figure 2B ). The coverage of the 3 \u2032 side of the viral genome is substantially 119 higher than that of the 5 \u2032 side, which reflects the nested sgRNAs. This is also 120 partly due to the 3 \u2032 bias of the directional DRS technique. The presence of the 121 leader sequence (72 nt) in viral RNAs results in a prominent coverage peak at the 122 5 \u2032 end, as expected. We could also clearly detect vertical drops in the coverage, 123 whose positions correspond to the leader-body junction in sgRNAs. All known 124 sgRNAs are supported by DRS reads, with the exception of ORF10 (see below). 125\n\nIn addition, we observed unexpected reads reflecting noncanonical 126 recombination events. Such fusion transcripts resulted in the increased coverage 127 towards the 5 \u2032 end ( Figure 2B , inner box). Early studies on coronavirus mouse 128 hepatitis virus reported that recombination frequently occurs (Furuya and Lai, exhibits a high coverage as expected for the nested transcripts.\n\nThe depth of DNB sequencing allowed us to confirm and examine the 138 junctions on an unprecedented scale for a CoV genome. We mapped the 5 \u2032 and 139 3 \u2032 sites at the fused junctions and estimated the recombination frequency by 140 counting the reads spanning the junctions ( Figure 3A ). The leader represents the 141 most prominent 5 \u2032 site, as expected ( Figure 3A , red asterisk on the x-axis). The 142 known TRSs are detected as the top 3 \u2032 sites ( Figure 3A , red dots on the y-axis).\n\nThese results confirm that SARS-CoV-2 uses the canonical TRS-mediated 144 mechanism for discontinuous transcription to produce major sgRNAs ( Table S3 ). The second cluster shows a long-distance fusion 160 between sequences that do not have similarity to the leader ( Figure 3F , The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.988865 doi: bioRxiv preprint Figure 3 (previous page) | A, Positions of recombination sites determined by using junction-spanning reads from DNBseq data. The x-axis and y-axis show the positions of the 5 \u2032 sites and their joined 3 \u2032 sites, respectively. The frequency of the recombination was estimated by the read counts of the junction-spanning reads. The red asterisk on the x-axis is to indicate that the leader sequence. Please note that the left-most bins containing the leader TRS was expanded horizontally on this heatmap to improve visualization. The red dots on the sub-plot alongside the y-axis denote local peaks which coincide with the 5 \u2032 end of the body of each sgRNA. B, Transcript abundance was estimated by counting the DNBseq reads that span the junction of the corresponding RNA. C, Top 50 sgRNAs. The asterisk indicates an ORF beginning at 27,825 which may encode the 7b protein with an N-terminal truncation of 23 amino acid. The grey bars denote minor transcripts that encode proteins with an N-terminal truncation compared with the corresponding overlapping transcript. The black bars indicate minor transcripts that encode proteins in a different reading frame from the overlapping major mRNA. D, Canonical recombination. E, TRS-L-dependent noncanonical recombination between the leader TRS and a noncanonical 3 \u2032 site in the body. F, TRS-L-independent long-distance (>5,000 nt) recombination. G, TRS-L-independent local recombination yielding a deletion between proximal sites (20-5,000 nt distance).\n\nOf note, the junctions in these noncanonical transcripts do not contain a numerous signal level changes corresponding to 5mC modification, even with 225 the unmodified controls ( Figure S1C ). We obtained highly comparable results 226 from the viral RNAs from infected cells ( Figure S1D ), demonstrating that the 227 5mC sites detected without a control may be false positives. 228 We, however, noticed intriguing differences in the ionic current (called 229 \"squiggles\") between negative control and viral transcripts ( Figure 5A ).
