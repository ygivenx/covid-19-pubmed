{"title": "Single Fluorescence Channel-based Multiplex Detection of Avian Influenza Virus by Quantitative PCR with Intercalating Dye", "body": "PCR mixture consisted of 6\u03bcL Roche LightCycler TaqMan Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics, Germany), 1 \u03bcL 20X EvaGreen Dye in water (TATAA, Sweden) as well as forward and reverse primers15 (Table 1)(MWG Eurofines, Germany) at a final concentration of 1.8 \u03bcM. To this solution synthetic complementary DNA (cDNA) templates (ATG Biosynthesis, Germany) for haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) for the avian influenza virus (H7N9) were added at different concentrations (see Table 1). Lastly the solution was adjusted to a volume of 20 \u03bcL using water obtained from a Milli-Q ProgradT3 column (Millipore, Germany).\n\nA droplet with a volume of 150 nL of the PCR solution was placed on a hydrophobically coated microscope glass cover slip and covered with 1.5 \u03bcL of mineral oil 9405 (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) thus forming a VRC. This glass was then placed on a micromachined silicon chip integrated with both a heater and a sensor, similar to a design shown earlier13. Here the silicon chip has a size of only 15 \u00d7 15 mm to better fit a handheld PCR device we are developing (see Fig. 1). The small thermal mass of the VRC together with the silicon heater resulted in heating rates >20 \u00b0C/s and similar cooling rates achieved only by passive cooling. The PCR protocol consisted of a hot start for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C followed by 40 cycles each consisting of two steps, denaturation for 5 s at 95 \u00b0C and annealing/extension for 30 s at 60 \u00b0C.\n\nFluorescence amplitude was continuously monitored using an Axiotron II microscope (Zeiss, Germany). We have used a blue LED model M470L3-C4 LED with principal wavelength of 470 nm (Thorlabs, Germany) for excitation. The LED was powered with square wave pulses at a frequency of 2710 Hz and a duty cycle of 5%. Light from the LED as well as emitted light from the specimen was filtered with a filter set model 49002 - ET - EGFP (FITC/Cy2) (Chroma Optical Corp, USA). Emitted light was captured by a PMT photosensor module H10722-20 (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Germany). The PMT signal was processed by a lock-in amplifier 7230 DSP (Ametek, USA) and its output recorded by a digital oscilloscope model DPO 3014 (Tektronix, Germany) with data rate of 2500 measurements per second. The temperature of the PCR chip was also recorded by the oscilloscope at the same data rate.\n\nFor comparison, samples were also analyzed using the Roche LightCycler Carousel-Based system (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) followed by a standard melting curve after thermal cycling.\n\nCaptured fluorescence data were analyzed using a custom written Matlab-script. First the data were filtered by a fast Fourier transform filter (FFTF). Subsequently, the fluorescence signal was divided into the individual cycles based on the captured temperature profile. The fluorescence amplitude during transition from extension/annealing step to denaturation step was then extracted for each cycle and fluorescence as function of temperature was plotted with cycle number as a parameter. MCA was formed by numerical differentiation of the fluorescence with respect to temperature and its negative value was plotted as a function of temperature. The melting curve captured at the first cycle was subtracted from all melting curves to suppress a background fluorescence effect we have observed. This background fluorescence could be caused by autofluorescence from the adjacent printed circuit board as well as fluorescence of the temperature dependence of the fluorophore as well as unspecific binding of the dye onto single stranded DNA16. PCR amplification curves were created by plotting amplitudes at the MCA of each amplicon as a function of the cycle number.\n\nWe have run a 40 cycle PCR using the master mix manufacturer\u2019s specifications. A typical fluorescence profile was obtained (see Fig. 2A). In Fig. 2B we show the single cycle number 23 to demonstrate the extracted data for the MCA.\n\nThis procedure was applied to a sample containing only a single amplicon (HA) with melting temperature of 76 \u00b0C (see Fig. 3A,B). We have then added to the sample a second amplicon (NA) with a melting temperature of 68 \u00b0C. A second peak corresponding to this amplicon can be observed in the respective MCA (Fig. 3C,D). Increasing the amount of NA added compared to HA lead to an even faster increase of the magnitude of peak at 68 \u00b0C (Fig. 3E,F). Extracting the fluorescence amplitude from the derived curves for each cycle at 68 \u00b0C and 76 \u00b0C respectively, results in two PCR amplification curves. Figure 4A shows the two amplification curves extracted for the experiments with a higher concentration of NA than HA (experiments A1 to A5 in Table 2).\n\nThe sample spiked with the cDNA of the HA gene yielded only a single amplification curve with melting temperature of 76 \u00b0C, which was expected. For all other experiments we were able to extract two amplification curves, one at a temperature of 68 \u00b0C and the second one at temperature of 76 \u00b0C. Threshold cycles (CT) were defined in the usual way. It was found that the difference in CT (\u2206CT) of the two curves corresponded to the expected difference according to the ratio of concentrations of HA and NA. An overview of all conducted experiments is presented in Table 1. The results indicate that \u2206CT corresponds to the expected values. We can then conclude that the method can be used for multiplexed quantitative PCR. As an example, (see Table 1) sample A5 has the concentration of NA 19 times higher than the concentration of HA. With 100% PCR efficiency one would expect a \u2206CT of 4.25 (log219). We have found the \u2206CTvalue to be 4.0 \u00b1 0.4 which is efficiency of 84%, reasonably close to the ideal value.\n\nWe have observed MCA peak broadening in our experiment due to applied conditions. It is necessary to run several replicates of the same experiment to suppress random errors and improve the result precision. The MCAs are recorded at a scanning rate of over 20 \u00b0C/s while the commercial systems for high resolution melting curve analysis (HRMCA)17 are usually operating with low temperature scan rates between 0.1 \u00b0C/s and 0.5 \u00b0C/s. Differentiation of amplicons with melting point differences \u0394Tm as small as 1.2 \u00b0C have been demonstrated in HRMCA. However the method presented in this contribution requires greater \u0394Tm due to peak broadening caused by the high heating rate.\n\nWe assume that a difference in amplicons melting temperatures\u2019 of at least 5 \u00b0C would be sufficient to differentiate them from each other. This could be achieved by primer design since the melting temperature is a function of amplicon length and ratio of CG/AT content. Therefore an extension temperature of 60 \u00b0C and a denaturation temperature of 95 \u00b0C would allow for 6 different amplicons to be detected in the same droplet, assuming a \u0394Tm of 5 \u00b0C.\n\nFurthermore, the temperature measured by the sensor in HRMCA corresponds practically to the sample temperature due to the slow scanning rate. In our approach the sample temperature lags behind the temperature measured by the sensor underneath the sample18. This can be seen from the comparative end point HRMCA done with the LightCycler, Fig. 4B shows the fluorescence amplitude plotted as function of temperature with a temperature gradient of 0.1 \u00b0C/s. In Fig. 4C the first negative derivative of this curve with respect to temperature is shown, displaying two distinct peaks. Both melting temperatures found on the LightCycler are 8 \u00b0C higher than the temperatures we measured in our system. Nevertheless this Tm offset has no influence on quality of the results especially when this lag is known and the resulting temperature offset is calibrated.\n\nIdeally the test should be performed with a clinical sample containing H7N9 virus starting with sample preparation followed with reverse transcription. VRC-based RT-PCR demonstrating almost all those steps was shown earlier, detecting both RNA from H5N1 avian influenza virus19 as well as from virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)20. Processing clinical sample containing virus of avian influenza or SARS would also require laboratory classified as biosafety hazard level 3 which we do not have available. In previous work we developed the system based on spiking blood sample with RNA, here in this work we spiked PCR master mix with two types of cDNA.\n\nWe have developed a method for quantitative, multi target PCR using only a single intercalating dye and thus only one fluorescence channel. Our approach allows researchers to perform affordable multiplex PCR using simple tools as well as reagents. Another advantage compared to conventional methods is small consumption of reagents due to small sample volume. Fluorescent amplitude sampling at rate above 100 samples per second is, however, required for constructing MCA during transition from annealing/extension to denaturation. This method might be particularly interesting for determination of serotype of virus such as dengue fever or an avian influenza. Other potential applications include measurement of viral loads in a sample, differentiation between H7N9 and H7N5, and quantitative detection of co-infections. We have experimentally verified the method using a homemade PCR system primarily for convenience as we have 100% control of the tool. In principle any commercial real-time PCR device would be capable of performing the same protocol as long as it has available fluorescent amplitude sampling rate of 1kHz or higher and can process samples with small volume of a 1 \u03bcL or below.\n\nHow to cite this article: Ahberg, C.
