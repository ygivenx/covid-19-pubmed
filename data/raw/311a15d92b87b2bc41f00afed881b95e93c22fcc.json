{"title": "Comparative analysis reveals adaptive evolution of bat IFITMs and a novel 1 antiviral determinant", "body": "Host interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are broad-spectrum antiviral restriction 28 factors. Of these, IFITM3 potently inhibits viruses that enter cells through acidic endosomes, many 29 of which are zoonotic and emerging viruses with bats (order Chiroptera) as natural hosts. We (Fig. 2B) . The amino acids at codon 70 for the 31 functional mammalian IFITMs, as well the 176 likely ancestral codons at this site at key nodes in the phylogeny inferred using a parsimony 7 distinct amino acid at codon 70 (P, T and W, respectively). A further three amino acids occur in 179 IFITM proteins with confirmed antiviral activity: F (in mouse IFITM3 and IFITM1), A (in mouse 180 IFITM2) and G (in mouse IFITM6; not used in the phylogenetic analysis). Assessing novel IFITM3 181 sequences we obtained using RACE and RT-PCR for 4 species of microbat also highlighted codon 70 182 as the only non-conserved residue within the CD225 domain of microbat IFITM3, and it was notable 183 that two microbat species encode valine (V) at this position (Fig. 2C ).\n\nWe next performed a site-specific selection analysis using the phylogeny of the 31 functional IFITMs 186 shown in Fig. 2A The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/737841 doi: bioRxiv preprint expressing mbIFITM3 P70W compared to wt mbIFITM3. Expression levels of wt mbIFITM3 and 213 mbIFITM3 P70W were comparable when analyzed by western blotting (Fig. 3A , 3B, S1A) and flow 214 cytometry (Fig. S1B ). Using multicycle IAV infection, we investigated the impact on infectious yields 215 and found that cells expressing mbIFITM3 P70W gave 8-fold greater IAV titres than cells expressing 216 wt mbIFITM3 (Fig. 3D) . Overall, the P70W substitution in mbIFITM3 significantly reduces restriction 217 of three different families of viruses that enter cells via pH-dependent fusion from endosomes.

Together, these data suggest that mbIFITM3 P70W 248 showed increased association with the Golgi apparatus and reduced trafficking to the cell surface 249 compared to the wt mbIFITM3 protein and the huIFITM3 proteins. Moreover, huIFITM3 P70W did 250 not show any obvious alteration in its trafficking properties and behaved similarly to the wt protein.\n\nThese properties correlated with the reduced viral restriction observed for mbIFITM3 P70W (Fig. 3) .

To 280 investigate S-palmitoylation in mbIFITM3, cysteine-to-alanine substitutions were made at 281 conserved cysteine residues (C71, C72 and C105). A549 cells stably expressing single mutants C71A, 282 C72A and C105A, the double C71A-C72A mutant and the triple C71A-C72A-C105A mutant were 283 generated. Two methods were used to assess S-palmitoylation: (i) the acyl exchange gel shift 284 method described above ( Fig. 5 and 6A ), and (ii) visualisation of palmitoylated proteins by in-gel 285 fluorescence (Fig. 6B ). For this, cells were metabolically labelled with a 'clickable' alkyne palmitate 286 analogue followed by further modification of the palmitoylated proteins via copper-catalyzed 287 azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction (i.e. 'click chemistry') using a TAMRA-labelled capture reagent.\n\nThe described metabolic labelling approach has been extensively used to successfully quantify a 289 variety of PTMs [57] [58] [59] .
