{"title": "Using a Pan-Viral Microarray Assay (Virochip) to Screen Clinical Samples for Viral Pathogens", "body": "Primer A 5'-GTTTCCCAGTCACGATA-(N9)-3'\n\nPrimer B 5'-GTTTCCCAGTCACGATA-3'\n\nWhen the protocol is done correctly, a smear should be seen on agarose gel electrophoresis after the Rd B step (Figure 2A). The Virochip microarray on the Agilent platform will be difficult to analyze visually (Figure 2B), but if a virus is present it should be readily identified by visual inspection, cluster analysis, and / or E-Predict (Figure 1C). Samples can be spiked with measured quantities of nucleic acid from a known virus (e.g. tobacco mosaic virus; MS2 bacteriophage) to serve as a positive control for the assay.\n\nFigure 1. Schematic of Virochip microarray processing and analysis. Extracted nucleic acid from clinical samples are randomly amplified, labeled with fluorescent dyes, and hybridized to the Virochip microarray. Microarrays are scanned at 2 \u03bcm resolution and analyzed using a variety of computational tools, including E-Predict.\n\nFigure 2. Steps in the Virochip assay. After amplification by random PCR, a smear of 200 - 1000 bp can be visualized by gel electrophoresis (A). (B) Three Virochip microarrays out of the 8 arrays / glass slide are shown, with a small region of one microarray blown-up in the inset on the bottom right corner. (C) Automated microarray viral analysis using E-Predict revealing the presence of influenza A virus in the clinical sample. The high similarity score (s=0.55) corresponds to a p-value that is close to zero, thus making this an extremely significant prediction.\n\nThe Virochip protocol as described here is complex and requires a meticulous and skilled research technician. Correct reagent concentrations and conditions for PCR, labeling, and hybridization are critical. The Virochip protocol can be easily modified to accommodate analysis of diseased tissues by use of a tissue extraction method such as TRIzol (Invitrogen) for nucleic acid extraction. Probes can be added or deleted as necessary to obtain the desired spectrum and breadth of coverage; for instance, probes for detection of nonviral targets such as bacteria and fungi can be designed and added \"on-the-fly\". Some applications of the Virochip assay currently under development include broad-spectrum viral diagnostics in the clinical laboratory, outbreak investigation, purity screening of drugs and vaccines, and novel viral pathogen discovery.\n\nNo conflicts of interest declared."}
