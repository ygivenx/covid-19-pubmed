{"title": "Mechanisms of Innate Immune Evasion In Re-Emerging RNA Viruses", "body": "Several emerging and re-emerging RNA viruses have been the cause of several national and international epidemics within the past few years. These pathogens are no longer confined within national or even regional boundaries, and have become cause for global concern. In the summer of 2012, an outbreak of the flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States, which since its discovery in 1937 has become endemic to all continents on earth except Antarctica, resulted in over 1,800 cases in the state of Texas alone [1] . Moreover, recent epidemiological evidence has distinguished the emergence of novel Lineage 2 WNV isolates as the cause of several human outbreaks in Europe, which prior to 2011 was thought Immunoelectron microscopy revealed viral replication and virus budding occur within viroplasm and VLSs in Dengue virus (DENV) -infected mosquito cells [8] , thus indicating these sites to be important for viral replication. Moreover, WNV, DENV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genomic RNA becomes sensitive to nuclease treatment after disruption of these membrane vesicles [9] , which indicates these structures shield the viral genome from endogenous RNA degrading processes in the cytosol. It has also been suggested that membrane vesicle protection of viral RNA delays onset of IFN responses, but has not been definitively shown. A recent study utilizing flaviviruses JEV and DENV correlated high amounts of cytosolic JEV RNA with robust IFN\u03b2 production and low amounts of cytosolic DENV RNA with weak IFN\u03b2 production [10] . However, this work still does not directly address whether flavivirus viroplasms prevent IFN production. Interestingly, the Influenza virus (IAV), which causes annual seasonal epidemics worldwide, replicates within the nucleus of infected cells away from cytosolic RLRs and TLRs [11] . Nonetheless, additional studies are warranted to elucidate the significance of viroplasm and VLSs to viral pathogenesis.\n\nThe RLRs RIG-I and MDA5 are activated upon recognizing non-self dsRNAs consisting of unmethylated 5\u2032 tri-or di-phosphate ends [12] . Multiple RNA viruses have evolved enzymatic processes that catalyze post-translational modification of nascent mRNAs that effectively masks viral PAMPs by mimicking eukaryotic RNA structures. These processes include the addition of 5\u2032 cap structures similar to eukaryotic \"Type 1 caps\" composed of a GMP-bound diphosphate moiety bound to the N-terminus of the transcribed mRNA molecule (GpppN-RNA) with methyl groups at guanine residues at the N-7 and ribose 2\u2032-O position (m7GpppNm-RNA). These post-translational modifications are catalyzed by phosphatases and methyltransferases (MTases). Studies examining various viral pathogens have demonstrated that loss of these post-translational modifications via mutating virally encoded phosphatases and MTases leads to decreased viral replication and enhancement of host antiviral responses. Notably, a recent study using SARS-CoV lacking Nsp16, which acts as a 2\u2032 O-MTase, showed that loss of 2\u2032 O-methylation of the SARS-CoV genome enhanced host type I IFN production [13] . Moreover, mutant JEV strains lacking the 2\u2032-O MTase are attenuated compared to wildtype JEV strains [14] . Therefore, post-translational modification of viral mRNA is an effective immunoevasion strategy that prevents induction of host antiviral processes. Table 1 summarizes other known cap-binding enzymes found in various RNA viruses. Some RNA viruses lack the catalytic enzymes to generate their own RNA cap. These viruses hijack the host's cellular mRNA by expressing viral endonucleases and utilize these caps to mask viral RNA PAMPs. In particular, IAV and other negative-strand segmented viruses such as Bunyaviruses have been shown to utilize this mechanism of \"cap snatching\" [15] . IAV RNA polymerase complexes with PB1, an endonuclease with cap binding activity that captures a N7 methylguanosine 5\u2032 cap from host cellular pre-mRNA transcribed by host RNA Polymerase II as a means to generate primers required for initiation of viral RNA transcription [16] . A similar endonuclease is also found in Bunyaviruses encoded by the Lprotein [15] . The presence of this 5\u2032 cap is important for initiation of viral transcription during replication, maintaining RNA stability, and cap-dependent translation as well as evading detection by cytosolic PRRs.\n\nRLRs preferentially bind and detect double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), leading to downstream production of type I IFN and activation of other antiviral genes. Within the three RLRs, RIG-I has been studied in the best detail in the context of host-pathogen interactions and signaling. Specifically, RIG-I (and MDA5) signal through mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein to activate Tank Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1) and I-kappa-B kinase \u03b5 (IKK\u03b5), leading to activation of transcription factors Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) 3 and 7 as well as NF\u03baB. In contrast, recognition of RNA PAMPs by endosomal TLRs signals through adaptors TRIF in TLR3 and MyD88 in TLR7/8. Similar to RLRs, triggering endosomal TLR3/TRIF results in both NF\u03baB and IRF3/7 activation, the latter leading to production of Type I IFN other antiviral genes, yet few viral proteins that directly antagonize TLR signaling adaptor proteins have been identified. In this section, we highlight common antiviral signaling molecules targeted by various emerging and re-emerging RNA viral pathogens ( Figure 1 ).\n\nIAV NS1 complexes with 5\u2032-phosphorylated ssRNA and RIG-I [17] , but also interacts with RIG-I and MAVS [18] . Mutant NS1 that is unable to bind RNA does not co-precipitated with RIG-I [17] , supporting the notion that NS1 may require RNA intermediates to associate with RIG-I. More recently, subunits of the IAV RNA polymerase complex, basic polymerase 1 and 2 (PB1, PB2), the acidic polymerase (PA) and nucleoprotein (NP) were found to directly complex with RIG-I, yet the physiological effects of these interactions have not been identified [19] . Interestingly, interactions between RIG-I and the IAV RNA Polymerase complex occurred in the absence of RNA and were not competitively inhibited by IAV NS1, illustrating that these interactions do not require RNA intermediates and that IAV may indeed directly inhibit RIG-I.\n\nAfter recognizing viral dsRNA, RIG-I undergoes conformational changes and posttranslational modification that includes K63-linked polyubiquitinated on lysine residues of their CARD and C-terminal domains. This reaction is catalyzed by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 [20] . The multifunctional NS1 protein of IAV and NS protein of Bunyavirus Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus (SFTSV) both target TRIM25. IAV NS1 interacts directly with TRIM25, thus reducing RIG-I polyubiquitination [21, 22] . Studies by Rajsbaum et al. also implicated NS1 in interacting with and inhibiting Riplet, an E3 ligase that polyubiquitinates the C-terminal region of RIG-I [22] . Thus IAV NS1 exerts multiple mechanisms in suppressing RIG-I ubiquitination. In contrast, SFTSV exerts a different mechanism to antagonize RIG-I. SFTSV encodes NS protein that sequesters RIG-I, TRIM25 and TBK1 into cytoplasmic structures similar to the aforementioned viroplasms to inhibit RIG-I triggering of Type I IFN [23] [24] [25] . SFTSV NS proteins can inhibit IFN\u03b2 promoter activation, and was shown to induce re-localization of RIG-I, TRIM25 and TBK1 into cytoplasmic structures that resemble inclusion bodies. Therefore RNA viruses are able to directly suppress PRR activation as a mode of immune evasion. Inhibition of mitochondrial-associated signaling molecules: MAVS and STING/MITA ER protein stimulator of IFN genes, or STING (also known as MITA) is responsible for activation of TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of cytosolic IRF3 and turning on production of type I IFN. Flaviviruses DENV and YFV as well as SARS-CoV can directly inhibit STING and its downstream constituents, albeit through distinct mechanisms. The DENV NS2B/NS3 protease complex can directly cleave human STING, but not its mouse homologue MPYS [26] [27] [28] . YFV NS4B, like DENV NS4B, displays similar homology to the catalytic domain found on the N-terminus of STING that is required for its function, and by association it was speculated that YFV NS4B also inhibits STING [29] . Indeed, YFV NS4B was found to co-localize with human STING via confocal microscopy, but functional inhibition of STING by YFV NS4B has still yet to be confirmed. In contrast, NS4B of another flavivirus, Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was experimentally demonstrated to inhibit STING [30, 31] . It is unclear whether HCV NS4B also cleaves STING, yet it is likely that STING inhibition via NS4B is conserved among all flaviviruses, including YFV.\n\nHuman CoV and SARS-CoV also encode an inhibitor of STING through expression of papain-like protease (PLP) domains within nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) that function as both proteases and deubiquitinating enzymes [32, 33] . Inhibition of STING through PLPs in SARS-CoV and PLP2 in human CoV occurs via protease-dependent and -independent mechanisms. CoV PLPs can inhibit the dimerization of STING, which is required for its activation, as well as inhibit its ability to form complexes with MAVS and IKK\u03b5 [33] . CoV PLPs can also decrease the ubiquitination of STING as well as RIG-I, TBK1 and IRF3, but interestingly does not require ubiquitin catalytic activity to reduce ubiquitinylation on STING [32, 33] . Likewise inhibition of proteolytic activity does not affect CoV PLPs from inhibiting Type I IFN production. Thus the exact mechanism of how PLP domains within CoV nsp3 can antagonize cytosolic STING and inhibit IFN production requires further investigation.\n\nAlthough no known inhibitors of STING have been characterized in IAV, PB1-F2 and PB2 proteins have been shown to interact with and inhibit MAVS [34, 35] . Both PB2 and PB1-F2 are characterized as inhibitors of IFN\u03b2 production via direct interaction with MAVS. A recent study illustrated that a single Threonine to Isoleucine mutation at position 588 (T588I) increased IAV PB2 ability to bind MAVS and inhibit type I IFN production [36] . These mutations were originally isolated in swine IAV variants, but also found in the H1N1 influenza virus that caused the 2009 pandemic. This implicates PB2 as a potent antagonist of MAVS that may have broader functions in determining the virulence of IAV strains. MAVS is also inhibited by the actions of HCV protease NS3 and its required cofactor NS4A [37, 38] . HCV NS3/NS4A was shown to cleave MAVS at Cysteine-508 and is a potent inhibitor of IFN\u03b2. Therefore inhibition of MAVS and STING are effective viral mechanisms of immune evasion.\n\nActivation of dsRNA via TLRs and RLRs involve distinct players that converge downstream of PRR activation. Recognition of dsRNA through TLR3, RLRs RIG-I/MDA5 or the broad-spectrum dsRNA responder protein kinase RNA (PKR) converges upon activation of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, which phosphorylates IRF3 and IRF7, respectively, and allows translocation into the nucleus to mediate IFN gene transcription. In addition, TLR3 and RLR pathways both activate IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 kinases that activate NF\u03baB the former via TRIF recruitment of TRAF6/RIP1 and the latter via MAVS. Several inhibitors of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 and IKK\u03b5 have been identified among RNA viruses. DENV NS2B/3, which we have discussed as a human STING protease, and the multifunctional EBOV VP35 can inhibit IKK\u03b5 and production of type I IFN by preventing translocation of transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. Both DENV NS2B/3 and EBOV VP35 bind directly to IKK\u03b5 to disrupt complex formation with IRF3 [39, 40] .\n\nIn contrast, suppression of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 will lead to inhibition of NF\u03baB expression of NF\u03baBdependent genes that regulate a myriad of biological processes, spanning survival to surface molecule expression. IAV and CoV have been shown to target IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 resulting in NF\u03baB inhibition. IAV and CoV have been shown to target IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 resulting in NF\u03baB inhibition. IAV NS1 interacts with the N-terminal kinase domain of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 and IKK\u03b2 [41] and also inhibits phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, the kinase responsible for phosphorylating NF\u03baB and allowing its translocation to the nucleus. SARS-CoV membrane glycoprotein (M) physically interacts specifically with IKK\u03b2 but not with IKK\u03b1 [42] . Interaction with IKK\u03b2 correlates with SARS-CoV inhibition I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation required for its degradation resulting in sustained inhibition of NF\u03baB nuclear translocation. Moreover, SARS-CoV M glycoprotein directly complexes with TRAF6, TBK1, and IKK\u03b5 but does not inhibit IRF3 activation [43] .\n\nThe genome of CoV contains several open reading frames (ORFs) that encode accessory proteins. These accessory proteins play no role in replication or release of infectious viruses, but may have immunoevasion functions. The SARS-CoV genome contains ORFs 3b and 6, and along with nucleocapsid (N) protein, was shown to be potent inhibitors of IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation; N protein was also able to inhibit NF\u03baB activity [44] . MERS-CoV Membrane (M), ORF 4a, ORF 4b, and ORF 5 are also potent antagonists of IFN production [45] . ORF 4a, ORF 4b, ORF 5, and M inhibit the activation and translocation of IRF3, while ORF4a also inhibits the activity of NF\u03baB. The exact mechanism by which these CoV accessory proteins abrogate IRF3/NF\u03baB activity remains to be determined.\n\nEBOV VP35 and IAV NS1 both interact with PKR activating protein (PACT), a dsRNA binding partner involved with eukaryotic RNAi as well as activating RIG-I and PKR (Protein Kinase R). PKR is a nonspecific dsRNA sensor that can turn on TBK1/IKK\u03b5 and downstream IFN production, among other functions. IAV NS1 can inhibit PKR-mediated type I IFN production in two manners: 1) binding to PACT and preventing its interaction with PKR [46, 47] or 2) directly binding to PKR [46, 48] . In addition, PACT directly activates and sustains RIG-I activation independent of Dicer and PKR via binding to the Cterminal domain of RIG-I and stimulating its ATPase activity [49] . Both IAV NS1 and EBOV VP35 have also been shown to block RIG-I activation through interaction with PACT. IAV NS1 binds PACT directly through its RNA binding domain, and is able to interfere with PACT interactions with RIG-I, thus reducing IFN\u03b2 production [47] . Similarly, EBOV VP35 binds to PACT via its C-terminal IFN inhibitory domain, which is sufficient to disrupt PACT:RIG-I interactions and subsequent IFN production [50] . Therefore, IAV NS1 and EBOV VP35 interactions with PACT interfere with type I IFN production by suppressing dsRNA-binding proteins PKR and RIG-I. Thus viral inhibition of type I IFN production via PACT can occur through PKR-dependent or -independent means.\n\nRNAi is an important gene regulation pathway that negatively regulates gene expression via short nucleotide RNA molecules. The generation of small RNAs is mediated by an RNase called Dicer that digests dsRNA into siRNA, which then become a part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The RISC includes 1) the endonuclease Argonaute 2 (Ago2); 2) dsRNA binding partners Transactivation response RNA binding protein (TRBP) and PACT; and 3) the unwound strand of siRNA serving as the \"guide strand\" that identifies ssRNA transcripts with complementary sequence as a target for degradation [51] (Figure 1 ). Several RNA viruses encode proteins that antagonize the mammalian RNAi pathway. EBOV nonstructural proteins VP30, VP40 and VP35 have been identified as mammalian RNAi suppressors, with VP35 exhibiting the most potent antagonistic function [52, 53] . VP35 readily immunoprecipitates with Dicer, TRBP and PACT, while VP30 only interacts with Dicer and TRBP. The ability of VP35 and VP30 to interact with TRBP and PACT also implicated their participation in inhibiting RIG-I signaling and the IFN production pathway, as both TRBP and PACT regulate PKR [54] . IAV NS1 has also been identified as a suppressor of eukaryotic RNAi. Similar to EBOV VP35, IAV NS1 can also bind PACT within the RNAi pathway, but also affects type I IFN production by disrupting PACT:RIG-I interactions [46, 47] . Recently, DENV NS4B has also been implicated in suppressing Dicerdependent RNAi activation [55] . Specifically, NS4B could inhibit in vitro conversion of dsRNA to siRNA by Dicer. Transient knockdown of the central components of endogenous RNAi (e.g. Dicer, Argonaute) enhanced DENV replication in Huh7 cells, which supports that mammalian RNAi limits viral pathogenesis of DENV.\n\nAlthough there have been various siRNAs directly involved in antiviral functions in plants and invertebrates, a similar function in the mammalian immune system has been difficult to discern. Few mammalian siRNA/microRNAs (miRNAs) specific to viral mRNA have been identified, and there is conflicting evidence as to whether RNAi components are directly required to limit viral pathogenesis. A previous study by Schopman et al. conducted deepsequencing of HIV-infected T cells to identify various HIV-specific siRNAs that inhibited HIV replication, representing the first convincing report of mammalian RNAi as an antiviral mechanism [56] . Two studies identified mammalian RNAi mechanisms from cells infected with mosquito-borne Nodamura virus (NoV) [57, 58] . Specifically, NoV encodes a suppressor of mammalian RNAi, B2, and functional B2 was required for NoV replication in hamster and mice [57] . However, a study by Seo and colleagues observed that mammalian RISC formation was inhibited by poly I:C and other viruses that triggered TLRs and RLRs, which argues that at least in some contexts, mammalian RNAi may not function as an antiviral process [59] . Thus to date, it is still unknown whether mammalian RNAi is a primary antiviral pathway to curtail virus replication.\n\nType I IFN signaling is a crucial component to control of viral replication, and is initiated upon IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 binding of interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR). This leads to recruitment of janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), which phosphorylate transcription factors signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 and 2. STAT1 and STAT2 form a complex with IRF9, which translocates to the nucleus to initiate transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) (Figure 2 ). IFN antagonists have been well-characterized in a number of RNA viruses, and target multiple components of the IFNAR signaling pathway. Flaviviruses JEV and WNV inhibit phosphorylation and activation of JAK1 via NS5 and NS4B, respectively [60, 61] . WNV NS4B also inhibits phosphorylation and activation of TYK2 [60] . Viral IFN antagonism is also mediated through induction of the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1 and 3 that negatively regulate JAK1. Flaviviruses WNV and JEV both induce transcriptional expression of SOCS1/3 early after infection [62, 63] in addition to other mechanisms. Likewise, CHIKV and EBOV both induce increased expression of SOCS1 [64, 65] . Finally, IAV NS1 also induces upregulation of SOCS1/3 [66, 67] .\n\nNumerous RNA viral pathogens antagonize STAT1 and/or STAT2. The nonstructural proteins of multiple flaviviruses have been shown to suppress STAT1/2 activity. Specifically, NS5 (JEV, WNV, DENV; [61, 68, 69] ) NS4B (WNV, DENV; [70, 71] ) and NS4A (JEV; [72] ) can inhibit STAT phosphorylation and their subsequent activation. DENV NS5 has also been shown to also promote the proteosomal degradation of STAT2 [69, 73, 74] . Specifically, DENV NS5 directly binds STAT2 to UBR4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, to initiate the proteolytic degradation of STAT2 [74] . This suggests that other NS proteins may contribute to NS5-mediated targeting of STAT2 for proteolytic cleavage. Additionally, the structural (core and envelope, E) and nonstructural NS1-5 proteins of a pathogenic WNV strain (Tx-HC 2002) inhibits STAT1/2 phosphorylation and IFN production, and introduction of these proteins into a non-pathogenic strain of WNV (Madagascar 78) enhances IFN inhibition and virus-induced cytopathology [75] . This indicates that STAT1/2 suppressor function is a major determinant of virulence within WNV strains, which is likely to be the case for other RNA viruses that target STAT signalisng.\n\nSeveral RNA viruses suppress STAT1/2 function by inhibiting phosphorylation in addition to nuclear translocation. CHIKV nsP2 inhibits phosphorylation of STAT1/2 and their nuclear translocation [76] , which was similar for another alphavirus Sindbis virus nsP2 [77] . CHIKV nsP2 does not induce degradation of STAT1/2 as observed in other viruses like DENV, and the mechanism for how CHIKV nsP2 inhibits STAT nuclear accumulation is unclear. IAV NS1 is also capable of downregulating STAT1/2 phosphorylation and inhibiting the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT1/2 [66, 78] . NS1 may hinder nuclear accumulation by disrupting phospho-STAT:DNA complexes that form and migrate to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription [66] . Interestingly, H5N1 and H1N1 IAV NS1 proteins can also downregulate expression of IFNAR 1 and 2 to inhibit Type I IFN signaling [66] . Thus IAV NS1 mediates three modes of IFN signaling antagonism: 1) upregulation of SOCS1/3 to diminish activation of JAK1/TYK2; 2) inhibition of STAT1/2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation; and 3) downregulation of IFNAR1/2 expression.\n\nEBOV VP24 prevents the nuclear accumulation of STAT1 by binding to karyopherin \u03b11 protein (importin \u03b11). Karyopherin \u03b11 belongs to a group of nuclear transport carriers that upon recognition of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of a nascent protein recruits Karyopherin \u03b21 (importin-1) to the complex. Ultimately the complex containing the nascent protein, Karyopherin \u03b11 and Karyopherin \u03b21 can cross the nuclear membrane. VP24 specifically binds to Karyopherin \u03b11 and other members of the Karyopherin \u03b1 subgroup and inhibits its interaction with phosphorylated STAT1 [79, 80] . This function was not observed for EBOV VP35, nor did VP24 affect upregulation of STAT1 expression. Therefore VP24 interactions with Karyopherin \u03b1 proteins limit STAT1 accumulation in the nucleus.\n\nSARS-CoV is capable of suppressing IFN signaling via three distinct mechanisms that all target STAT1. First, SARS-CoV nsp1 inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation, but has little or no effect on STAT2, JAK1 or TYK2 phosphorylation [81] . This study did not examine whether nsp1 affects STAT1 nuclear transport, but two independent studies showed that SARS-CoV open reading frame 6 (ORF6) encodes accessory proteins that inhibit STAT1 nuclear translocation [44, 82] . Similar to EBOV VP24, SARS-CoV ORF6 also inhibited nuclear accumulation of STAT1 by sequestering Karyopherin \u03b12 at the ER/Golgi and preventing its interaction with cytosolic phospho-STAT1 [82] . ORF6 also relocalizes Karyopherin \u03b21 at the ER/Golgi membrane, thus inhibiting the formation of the STAT1:Karyopherin complex required for nuclear transport. Importantly, infection with MERS-CoV, which does not encode ORF6, does not inhibit nuclear translocation of phospho-STAT1 [83] . This illustrates a clear distinction between SARS and MERS-CoV, which may reflect differences in virulence and pathogenesis between these viruses.\n\nFinally, SARS-CoV also mediates a third mechanism of IFN signaling inhibition via PLPs. SARS PLP upregulates the expression of cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase E2-25k, which is upregulated by IFN\u03b1 signaling [84] . PLP transfection into human pro-monocytes significantly induced expression of cellular E2-25k. Increased E2-25k correlated with significantly decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) 1, but not Erk2, protein in the cell, which was mediated through ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic degradation of Erk1. The degradation of Erk1 was concomitant with decreased IFN\u03b1-dependent STAT1 and c-Jun phosphorylation. Thus SARS-CoV antagonizes STAT1 activity through three distinct mechanisms: 1) nsp1-dependent inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation; 2) ORF6-dependent sequestration of karyopherin \u03b1 1 and STAT1 translocation; 3) PLP-dependent induction of E2-25k to promote Erk1 degradation and decreased STAT1 phosphorylation.\n\nThe emergence and re-emergence of RNA viruses continues to pose a significant public health threat worldwide. However, few vaccines for use in humans or specific antiviral therapeutics exist for several emerging/re-emerging viruses, including SARS, MERS-CoV, WNV, or BUNV. Thus, it is crucially important to understand the virus-host interactions that govern immunity, disease severity, and infection outcome. Recent findings have found that several viruses utilize multifaceted strategies to evade multiple arms of the innate immune response. Functionally pleiotropic suppressors such as IAV NS1 and EBOV VP35 reveal the complexity and level of sophistication by which these viral pathogens have developed as immune escape artists, but their nature as multifunctional antagonists also makes them attractive candidates in vaccines and therapeutics. For example, interventions that target IAV NS1 would suppress multiple IAV immunoevasion mechanisms, increasing the potential effectiveness of a candidate vaccine or therapy. Indeed, deletion mutants of IAV have already been tested in live attenuated vaccines in Phase I/II clinical trial, resulting in enhanced IAV-specific antibody responses [85] . With the ongoing Ebola epidemic in West Africa, it is tempting to imagine that targeting the multifunctional EBOV VP35 may lead to the development of effective therapeutics and even a possible vaccine. Most importantly, studies aimed at expanding our understanding of viral evasion strategies undoubtedly reveal new insights into innate immune signaling and host antiviral defenses. Indeed, discovery of the RIG-I signaling pathway led to the identification of viral factors that antagonize RLR signaling. As viral pathogens continue to cause threat of global epidemics, improved understanding of host defenses will be crucial to limiting the burden of human disease.\n\n\u2022 RNA viruses passively evade host detection by masking viral PAMPs and replicating within vesicles.\n\n\u2022 Many emerging viruses harbor multiple strategies for innate immune evasion.\n\n\u2022 Viral antagonists have been found to target the pattern recognition receptor and interferon signaling pathways.\n\n\u2022 Knowledge of host-pathogen interactions is essential for vaccine/therapeutic development and understanding innate immunity. \n\nBinding of IFNAR by Type I IFN (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2) initiates downstream kinases, JAK1 and TYK2. JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylates STAT1 and STAT2, which leads to the formation of the STAT1:IRF9:STAT2 complex. This complex translocates to the nucleus and initiates transcription of IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE). SOCS1 and/or SOCS3 negatively regulate JAK-STAT signaling by interacting with JAK1/TYK2. Nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated STAT1 also depends on Karyopherins. Karyopherin \u03b11 (or \u03b12) complexes with phosphorylated STAT1, which then recruits Karyopherin \u03b21. The complex of phospho-STAT1: Karyopherin \u03b1:Karyopherin \u03b21 is able to cross the nuclear membrane and regulate gene expression. Viral proteins that either inhibit or degrade host signaling factors are indicated. \"+\" denotes upregulation of expression.
