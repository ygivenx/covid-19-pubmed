To elaborate on our oligodendrocyte differentiation and inhibition of coronavirus expression (Beushausen and Dales, 1985; Beushausen et al., 1987; Wilson et al., 1986) led us to question whether PK inhibitors can counteract the dbcAMP effect and alleviate the restriction on virus replication. The answer was sought by pretreating WF oligodendrocytes with two isoquinoline sulfonamide derivatives, H-8 and HA1004 (Hidaka et al., 1984) , which are able to inactivate cAMP-dependent PKs by binding to the C subunits.\n\nAs a confirmation of our previous findings and a control for the inhibition of infection due to differentiation, cultures of oligodendrocytes were pretreated with 1 mM dbcAMP before inoculation. It is evident in Fig. 1A that due to pretreatment, JHMV titer was reduced by 80% within 24 hr and over 90% in 48 hr. Application of 3 mM the untreated controls (Fig. 1A) . After similar treatment with 3 mM dbcAMP the addition of 25 mM H-8 was able to relieve the inhibition only partially, as shown in Fig.  1B . The other inhibitor of PK, HA1004, when added at 50 mM together with 1 mM dbcAMP reversed the dbcAMP effect during the initial 24 hr of the experiment (Fig. 1A) . However, simultaneous treatment with 3 mM dbcAMP and HA1004 affected the inhibition of JHMV replication very little (Fig. 1B) .\n\nTo ascertain independently whether reversal of the inhibitory effect due to dbcAMP on JHMV replication by H-8 involves the PK's, oligodendrocytes were treated with either the inducer or the inhibitor or with both compounds. It is evident from lanes 2 and 4 of the autoradiogram in Fig. 2 that, as predicted from Beushausen et al. (1987) , dbcAMP induced the synthesis of large amounts of R1. Treatment with H-8 alone did not appreciably decrease the quantity of R1 present in controls (lane 2 vs 3). When both H-8 and dbcAMP were added R1 induction was abrogated (lane 5), demonstrating that in oligodendrocytes presence of low amounts of R1 appears to be The above results led us to extend our enquiry into changes in phosphorylation of N during virus penetration, specifically whether dephosphorylation is required for initiating JHMV replication. For this purpose, we employed calyculin A, a reversible inhibitor of PPPases (Ishihara et al., 1989) . L-2 cells were treated with the drug for 30 min either before inoculation or 2 hr after initiating penetration. As a measure of JHMV replication, titers of virus released by 10 hr postinfection into the medium were determined. As evident from Fig. 4 , when 100 nM calyculin A was applied in advance of inoculation, the JHMV titer was reduced about 1.5 log 10 PFU/ml as compared with virus generated by cells treated with calyculin A commencing 2 hr postinfection. These data are consistent with the idea that dephosphorylation by a PPPase activity may be re- of N, L-2 cells were treated with various concentrations of the inhibitor prior to inoculation as described for Fig. 4 . Samples taken 1 hr postinoculation were subjected to Evidence that MW modulation of N is related to the immunoblotting employing anti-N antibodies. As evident state of phosphorylation from Fig. 5 , conversion of N from the 56-to 50-kDa MW form was reduced by calyculin A in a concentration-de-A relationship between the 56-kDa N present within virions and a related 50-kDa protein was previously es-pendent manner, as was to be anticipated if dephosphorylation of N was being affected. From these combined re-tablished using 2-D tryptic peptide mapping (Cheley and Anderson, 1981) and anti-N monoclonal antibodies (MAb) sults, it was concluded that dephosphorylation of N is an early event during virus-cell interactions which may be (Coulter-Mackie et al., 1985) . Upon its synthesis, N becomes phosphorylated at serine residues (Stohlman et essential for commencement of replication.\n\nTo connect more directly dephosphorylation of the 56-al., 1983; Wilbur et al., 1986) . To determine whether MW modulation of N following its synthesis is due to phos-kDa form of N with an endosomal PPPase activity, in vitro assays were conducted. As shown in Fig. 6 , after phorylation, the nutrient medium of infected cultures was varied in the phosphate concentration. The 50-kDa species of N was reduced in proportion to increasing phosphate concentration, being absent when phosphate was at 5 mM (data not shown), demonstrating a regulation of the relative amounts of 50-and 56-kDa N protein in infected cells by phosphate concentration in the growth medium. The 56-kDa MW of N is the predominant form within mature JHMV particles.\n\nFrom previous evidence suggesting that N is modified during JHMV penetration, MW of the inoculum N protein was ascertained by immunoblotting at intervals for the first 120 min. The results shown in Fig. 3 indicated that between t0 and 30 min after warming to 37\u040a, N existed predominantly as the 56-kDa species. At 45 min, there was some processing of the 56-kDa antigen evident as several lower MW bands, including one at 50 kDa and some below 40 kDa. At 60 min, the 56-kDa material was completely absent and only a faint 50-kDa band remained while the remainder of N was at lower MW. By 120 min, the N antigen had disappeared altogether. increased according to the quantity of endosomes used. When 32 P-labeled N was reacted with endosomes in the same manner, about one-half of the protein bound [ 32 P] culin A, acting as a specific inhibitor of neutral PPPases, was solubilized (Mohandas and Dales, 1991) .

Since inducers of differentiation, among them cAMP, can regulate PK expression and suppress JHMV replication in oligodendrocytes at an early stage (Beushausen and Dales, 1985; Beushausen et al., 1987) , it was hypothesized that PK, or one of the holoenzyme components, can influence the endosomal PPPase. This idea is consistent with the wellrecognized interplay between PKs and PPPases in metabolic pathways involving these enzymes (for reviews, see inhibition of N dephosphorylation (data not shown).

At the standard concentration of 3 mg per reaction mixture, the rabbit and rat subunits inhibited endosomal PPPase to the same extent (data not shown).\n\nThe consequence of overexpressing R1 on the MW of PPPase activity in vitro and may affect virus replication and Flintoff, 1987; Yokomori et al., 1993) and facilitation of the uncoating process (Asanaka and Lai, 1993; Beushausen et al., 1987; Flintoff and van Dinter, 1989; Kooi et al., 1988) . Other evidence from several laboratories supports the view that MHVs, including JHMV, can penetrate by receptor-mediated endocytosis into vesicles possessing the structure of ''coated pits'' (David-Ferreira and Manakar, 1965; Flintoff and van Dinter, 1989; Krzystyniak and Dupuy, 1984; Mizzen et al., 1985) . The current study reveals that dephosphorylation of N from inoculum virions is most probably catalyzed by a PPPase associated with endosomes. Combined evidence from this study and a previous investigation (Mohandas and Dales, 1991) characterized the relevant PPPase as one which functions optimally at neutral pH and is sensitive to okadaic acid and calyculin A, two inhibitors of phosphatases type 1 and 2A. These observations led us to the hypothesis that JHMV uncoating may be initiated within early endosomes. The uncoating process whereby the RNA genome dissociates from the capsid N protein, follows dephosphorylation and subsequent breakdown of N. Presumably, the relevant endosomal PPPase is maximally active at neutrality, the pH milieu likely to prevail on the cytosolic face of the membrane, regardless of the pH optimum for virus-cell membrane fusion (Gallagher et al., 1991; Kooi et al., 1988) . Latency of this PPPase, i.e., it becomes more active after solubilization of membranes, as demonstrated in Mohandas and Dales (1991) , implies that in host cells the enzyme occurs in membranes at a site where it can function to dephosphorylate N as the N-RNA complex is released from inoculum viri- PPPase becomes directly relevant to interference with the uncoating process of JHMV.\n\nBased on the assumption that dephosphorylation of N showing that application of specific PK inhibitors can counteract the dbcAMP effect so as to maintain the oligo-and release of the viral genome are connected, it is quite possible that JHMV uncoating is depressed in mature dendrocytes in a permissive state, depending on both the concentration of dbcAMP inducer used and inhibitor oligodendrocytes because R1 synthesis is upregulated, as demonstrated by Beushausen et al. (1987) . This con-affinity for the PKs.
