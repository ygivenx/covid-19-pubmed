O0 (iv + 444 pages) ISBN 0 12 039233 X Ten years or so ago the 'biotechnological revolution' was embodied in the formation of companies dedicated to the production of a new generation of biologicals, including vaccines. There was a lot of hype. A decade on, how many novel vaccines have been produced? Of course, not many. The questions are 'do we know why?' and 'can we expect to see the situation reversed in the next decade?'\n\nIn addition to noting scientific and technological advances, a book on vaccine technology should be candid, analysing past disappointments, emphasizing the gaps in our knowledge and objectively appraising future prospects for novel vaccines.\n\nIt has become clear that the rational, as opposed to the empirical, approach to vaccine design requires a great deal of knowledge from diverse sources. The more that a virus or bacterium is reduced to its major protection-inducing components, the more ingenious the formulations required to fashion an effective vaccine must be. Identification and cloning of the major immunogens will clearly not be the hardest part for some pathogens although, in some cases, that is difficult enough. In addition, it will often be necessary to discover which immune responses are induced by the pathogen, which of those are essential for protection and, subsequently, how these responses may be induced by the novel vaccine.\n\nAll this and more is recognized in Vaccine Biotechnology, which is more interesting and readable than its title would suggest. Much of the book is devoted to the different types of novel vaccine under development, including: modified live viruses; infectious recombinant vectors; bio-synthetic subunit immunogens; and peptides. The potential of Salmonella species as live vectors has a chapter to itself, as do parasitic infections and vaccines for tumour antigens. The key and complex role of the immune response is not ignored in these chapters and also features prominently in chapters on immune responses and on immunomodifiers (immunostimulators and vehicles for prolonging antigen release), All this is sandwiched neatly between an account of the vaccine status quo {conventional vaccines) and two chapters dealing with viruses which have largely defied vaccine development and may continue to do so (lentiviruses and feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus).\n\nI particularly like the note of caution that sounds in many chapters, although the tenor is one of optimism. Economic and safety considerations are not ignored. One quibble .I have is the frustrating absence of page references in the contents page at the beginning of each chapter. "}
