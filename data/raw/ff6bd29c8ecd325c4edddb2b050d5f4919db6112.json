Between 3-5 million cases of severe influenza-related illness and over 250 000 deaths are 44\n\nreported every year. In addition to constant seasonal outbreaks, highly pathogenic avian influenza 45 (HPAI) strains, such as H5N1, remain an ongoing pandemic threat with recent WHO figures showing 46 454 confirmed laboratory infections and a mortality rate of 53%. It is important to note that humans 47 have very little pre-existing immunity towards avian influenza virus strains. Moreover, there is no 48 commercially available human H5N1 vaccine. Given the potential for H5N1 viruses to trigger a 49 pandemic (1, 2), there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic interventions to combat known 50 deficiencies in our ability to control outbreaks. Current seasonal influenza virus prophylactic and 51 therapeutic strategies involve the use of vaccination and antivirals. Vaccine efficacy is highly variable 52 as evidenced by a particularly severe 2017/18 epidemic and frequent re-formulation of the vaccine is 53 required to combat ongoing mutations in the influenza virus genome. In addition, antiviral resistance 54 has been reported for many circulating strains, including the avian influenza H7N9 virus that emerged 55 in 2013 (3, 4) . Influenza A viruses have also been shown to target and hijack multiple host cellular 56 pathways to promote survival and replication (5, 6). As such, there is increasing evidence to suggest 57 that targeting host pathways will influence virus replication, inflammation, immunity and pathology (6, 58 7). Alternative intervention strategies based on modulation of the host response could be used to 59 supplement the current prophylactic and therapeutic protocols. 60\n\nWhile the impact of influenza virus infection has been relatively well studied in animal models 61 (8, 9) , the human cellular responses are poorly defined due to the lack of available human autopsy 62 material, especially from HPAI virus-infected patients. In the present study, we characterized influenza 63 virus infection of primary human alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells isolated from normal human 64 lung tissue donated by patients undergoing lung resection. ATII cells are a physiologically relevant 65 infection model as they are a major target for influenza A viruses when entering the respiratory tract 66 (10). Human host gene expression following HPAI H5N1 virus (A/Chicken/Vietnam/0008/04) 67 infection of primary ATII cells was analyzed using Illumina HiSeq deep sequencing. In order to gain a 68 better understanding of the mechanisms underlying modulation of host immunity in an anti-69 inflammatory environment, we also analyzed changes in gene expression following HPAI H5N1 70 infection in the presence of the reactive oxygen species inhibitor (ROS), apocynin, a compound known 71 to interfere with NADPH oxidase subunit assembly (5, 6). 72\n\nOur HiSeq analysis described herein focused on differentially regulated genes following H5N1 73 infection and identified carcinoembryonic-antigen (CEA)-related cell adhesion molecule 1 74 (CEACAM1) as a key gene of interest. CEACAM1 (also known as BGP or CD66) is expressed on 75 epithelial and endothelial cells (11), as well as B cells, T cells, neutrophils, NK cells, macrophages and 76 dendritic cells (DCs) (12) (13) (14) . Human CEACAM1 has been shown to act as a receptor for several 77 human bacterial and fungal pathogens, including Haemophilus influenza, Escherichia coli, Salmonella 78 typhi and Candida albicans, but has not as yet been implicated in virus entry (15) (16) (17) . There is however 79 emerging evidence to suggest that CEACAM1 is involved in host immunity as enhanced lymphocyte 80 expression was detected in pregnant women infected with cytomegalovirus (18) and in cervical tissue 81 isolated from patients with papillomavirus infection (19) . 82\n\nEleven CEACAM1 splice variants have been reported in humans (20). CEACAM1 isoforms 83 (Uniprot P13688-1 to -11) can differ in the number of immunoglobulin-like domains present, in the 84 presence or absence of a transmembrane domain and/or the length of their cytoplasmic tail (i.e. L, long 85 or S, short). The full-length human CEACAM1 protein (CEACAM1-4L) consists of four extracellular 86 domains (one extracellular immunoglobulin variable-region-like (IgV-like) domain and three 87 immunoglobulin constant region 2-like (IgC2-like) domains), a transmembrane domain, and a long (L) 88 cytoplasmic tail. The long cytoplasmic tail contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory 89 motifs (ITIMs) that are absent in the short form (20) Table S1 ). HPAI H5N1 infection of ATII cells 124 activated an antiviral state as evidenced by the up-regulation of numerous interferon-induced genes, 125 genes associated with pathogen defense, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metabolism (Table 1; Table  126 S2). In the apocynin alone-treated (HA) group, a large number of genes were also significantly up-127 regulated (509 genes) or down-regulated (782 genes) ( Fig. 1A ; Table S1 ) relative to the control group. 128\n\nWhilst a subset of genes was differentially expressed in both the HD and HA groups, a majority of 129 Genes down-regulated by apocynin include those that are involved in cell adhesion (GO:0007155), 135 regulation of cell migration (GO: 0030334), regulation of cell proliferation (GO:0042127), signal 136 transduction (GO: 0007165) and oxidation-reduction processes (GO:0055114) (Table S2 , \"ND vs HA 137 Down\"; Down, down-regulation). 138 A total of 623 genes were up-regulated following H5N1 infection (\"ND vs HD Up\", Fig. 1D ). 139\n\nBy overlapping the two lists of genes from \"ND vs HD Up\" and \"HD vs HA Down\", 245 genes were 140 shown to be down-regulated in the presence of apocynin (Fig. 1D ). By overlapping three lists of genes 141 from \"ND vs HD Up\", \"HD vs HA Down\" and \"ND vs HA Up\", 55 genes out of the 245 genes were 142 present in all three lists (Fig. 1E ), indicating that these 55 genes were significantly inhibited by 143 apocynin but to a level that was still significantly higher than that in uninfected cells. The 55 genes 144 include those involved in influenza A immunity (hsa05164; DDX58, IFIH1, IFNB1, MYD88, PML, 145 STAT2), Jak-STAT signaling (hsa04630; IFNB1, IL15RA, IL22RA1, STAT2), cytokine-cytokine 146 receptor interaction (hsa04060; CX3CL1, IFNB1, IL15RA, IL22RA1) and RIG-I-like receptor 147 signaling (hsa04622; DDX58, IFIH1, IFNB1) (Table S3 and S4) . Therefore, critical immune responses 148 induced following H5N1 infection were not dampened following apocynin treatment. The remaining 149 190 of 245 genes excluded from the \"ND vs HA Up\" list were those significantly inhibited by apocynin 150 to a level that was similar to uninfected control cells (Fig. 1E ). The 190 genes that were reduced by 151 apocynin to basal levels were those involved in PI3K-Akt signaling (hsa04151; CCND1, GNB4, 152 IL2RG, IL6, ITGA2, JAK2, LAMA1, MYC, IPK3AP1, TLR2, VEGFC), cytokine-cytokine receptor 153 interaction (hsa04060; VEGFC, IL6, CCL2, CXCL5, CXCL16, IL2RG, CD40, CCL5, CCL7, IL1A), 154 TNF signaling (hsa04668; CASP10, CCL2, CCL5, CFLAR, CXCL5, END1, IL6, TRAF1, VEGFC) 155 and apoptosis (hsa04210; BAK1, CASP10, CFLAR, CTSO, CTSS, PARP3, TRAF1) (Table S3 and 156 S4) . This is consistent with the role of apocynin in reducing inflammation and apoptosis (29).\n\nBy overlapping the three lists of genes from \"ND vs HD Up\", \"HD vs HA Down\" and \"ND vs 158 HA Down\", eleven genes were found in all three comparisons. This suggests that these 11 genes are 159 upregulated following H5N1 infection and are significantly reduced by apocynin treatment to a level 160 lower than that observed in uninfected control cells (Fig. 1F ). Among these were inflammatory 161 cytokines/chemokines genes, including CXCL5, IL1A, AXL (a member of the TAM receptor family of 162 receptor tyrosine kinases) and TMEM173/STING (Stimulator of IFN Genes) ( Table S4) . and qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2E ). Apocynin treatment further increased SOCS1 mRNA expression (Fig. 172 2E) . Although HiSeq analysis did not detect a statistically significant increase of SOCS1 following 173 apocynin treatment, the Log2 fold-changes in SOCS1 gene expression were similar between the HD 174 and HA groups (4.8-fold vs 4.0-fold) (Fig. 2E) . SOCS3 transcription was also found to be significantly 175 increased following H5N1 infection alone following HiSeq analysis and was further increased after 176 apocynin treatment (Fig. 2F ). In contrast, SOCS3 mRNA was only slightly increased when samples 177 were analyzed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2F) . 178\n\nApocynin, a compound that inhibits expression of ROS, has been shown to influence influenza-179 specific responses in vitro (5) and in vivo (6). Although virus titers are not affected by apocynin 180 treatment in vitro (5), some anti-viral activity is observed in vivo when mice have been infected with a 181 All rights reserved.

Our HiSeq analysis of HPAI H5N1 virus gene 182 transcription ( Fig. 2G ) showed that although there was a trend for increased influenza virus gene 183 expression following apocynin treatment, with only influenza non-structural (NS) gene expression 184 statistically significant. 185 186 Enrichment of antiviral and immune response genes in HPAI H5N1-infected ATII cells. 187 GO enrichment analysis was performed on genes that were significantly upregulated following HPAI 188 H5N1 infection in ATII cells in the presence or absence of apocynin to identify over-presented GO 189 terms. Many of the H5N1-upregulated genes were broadly involved in defense response 190 (GO:0006952), response to external biotic stimulus (GO:0043207), immune system processes 191 (GO:0002376), cytokine-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0019221) and type I interferon signaling 192 pathway (GO:0060337) ( Table 1; Table S2 ). In addition, many of the H5N1-upregulated genes mapped 193 to metabolic pathways (hsa01100), cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (hsa04060), Influenza A 194 (hsa05164), TNF signaling (hsa04668) or to Jak-STAT signaling (hsa04630) (Table S3 ). However, not 195 all the H5N1-upregulated genes in these pathways were inhibited by apocynin treatment as mentioned 196 above ( Table 2; CEACAM5, were not affected by H5N1 infection (Fig. 3B ). It is also worth noting that more reads were 203 obtained for CEACAM5 (>1000 FPKM) than CEACAM1 (~ 7 FPKM) in uninfected ATII cells (Fig. 3A  204 and B), which is consistent with their normal expression patterns in human lung tissue (30).

Apocynin treatment 207 significantly reduced transcription levels of both CEACAM1 (Fig. 3A) and CEACAM5 (Fig. 3B ). 208\n\nExpression of 11 CEACAM1 variants in ATII and/or A549 cells was further characterized using qRT-209 PCR using primer pairs designed to specifically detect each variant (Table S5) difference in CEACAM1 protein levels were observed at various MOIs (2, 5 or 10), CEACAM1 222 protein expression at 48 hpi was significantly higher than that at observed at 24 hpi (Fig. 3E) . 223\n\nAfter confirming the upregulation of CEACAM1 protein expression following infection with 224 the low pathogenic PR8 virus in A549 cells, CEACAM1 protein expression was then examined in 225 primary human ATII cells infected with HPAI H5N1 and compared to PR8 virus infection (Fig. 3F) . 226\n\nLower MOIs of 0.5, 1 and 2 HPAI H5N1 were tested due to the strong cytopathogenic effect it causes 227 at higher MOIs. Endogenous CEACAM1 protein levels were significantly elevated in H5N1-infected 228 ATII cells at all three MOIs tested.

HPAI H5N1 virus 230 infection at MOIs of 0.5, 1 and 2 stimulated higher endogenous levels of CEACAM1 protein 231 expression when compared to low pathogenic PR8 H1N1 virus infection at a MOI of 2 (a maximum 232 23-fold increase induced by H5N1 at MOIs of 0.5 and 1, 48 hpi when compared to PR8 at MOI of 2), 233 suggesting a possible role for CEACAM1 in influenza virus pathogenicity (Fig. 3F) . (data not shown).

Increasing doses of 254 siCEACAM1 (10, 15 and 20 pmol) did not further down-regulate CEACAM1 protein expression in 255 A549 cells. As such, 15 pmol of siCEACAM1 was chosen for subsequent knockdown studies in both 256 ATII and A549 cells (Fig. 4C) . 257\n\nThe functional consequences of CEACAM1 knockdown were then examined in ATII and A549 258 cells following H5N1 infection. IL-6, IFN-\u03b2, CXCL10, CCL5, and TNF production was analyzed in 259 H5N1-infected A549 and ATII cells using qRT-PCR.

These host 279 targeting strategies will offer an alternative to current interventions that are focused on targeting the 280 virus. In the present study, we analyzed human host gene expression profiles following HPAI H5N1 281 infection and treatment with the antioxidant apocynin. As expected, genes that were significantly 282 upregulated following H5N1 infection were involved in biological processes including cytokine 283 signaling, immunity and apoptosis. In addition, H5N1-upregulated genes were also involved in 284 regulation of protein phosphorylation, cellular metabolism and cell proliferation, which are thought to 285 be exploited by viruses for replication (36). Apocynin treatment had both anti-viral (Table S2 , S3, S4) 286 (6) and pro-viral impact (Fig. 2G) , which is not surprising as ROS are potent microbicidal agents, as 287 well as important immune signaling molecules at different concentrations (37). In our hands, apocynin 288 treatment reduced H5N1-induced inflammation, but unavoidably impacted the cellular defense 289 response, cytokine production and cytokine-mediated signaling. Importantly, critical antiviral responses 290\n\nwere not compromised, i.e. the expression of pattern recognition receptors (e.g. DDX58 (RIG-I), TLRs, 291 IFIH1 (MDA5)) was not down-regulated (Table S1 ). Given the significant interference of influenza 292 viruses on host immunity, we focused our attention on key regulators of the immune responses. 293\n\nThrough HiSeq analysis, we identified the cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1 as a critical regulator of 294 immunity. Knockdown of endogenous CEACAM1 not only reduced H5N1-stimulated inflammatory 295 cytokine/chemokine production but also inhibited virus replication. 296 H5N1 infection resulted in significant upregulation of a number of inflammatory 297 cytokines/chemokines genes, including AXL and STING, which were significantly reduced by 298 apocynin treatment to a level lower than that observed in uninfected cells (Table S4 ). It has been 299 previously demonstrated that treatment of PR8 H1N1-infected mice with anti-AXL antibody 300 significantly reduces lung inflammation and virus titers (38).

Reduction of STING gene expression or other anti-viral factors (e.g. 303 IFNB1, MX1, ISG15; Table S1 ) by apocynin, may in part, explain the slight increase of the 304 transcription levels of all influenza genes (NS gene was significantly upregulated) following apocynin 305 treatment (Fig. 2G) . These results also suggest that apocynin treatment may reduce H5N1-induced 306 inflammation and apoptosis. Indeed, the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of apocynin have 307 been shown previously in a number of disease models, including diabetes mellitus (40) could suggest the possibility that upregulation of CEACAM1 (to inhibit NK activity) may be a novel 324 and uncharacterized immune evasion strategy employed by influenza viruses.

In support of this notion, we did not observe a difference in apoptosis of PR8-infected A549 cells 338 following transfection with siCEACAM1, siNeg, or mock-transfected cells using flow cytometry-based 339 Annexin V/7AAD staining (data not shown). Our study, together with the CEACAM6 findings, serve 340 to highlight the emerging role of CEACAMs in influenza virus infection. 341\n\nThe molecular mechanism of CEACAM1 action following infection has also been explored in 342 A549 cells using the low pathogenic PR8 virus (51) (18) and 359 papillomavirus (19), it will be important to determine whether a common mechanism of action can be 360 attributed to CEACAM1 in order to determine its functional significance. If this can be established, 361 CEACAM1 could be used as a target for the development of a pan-antiviral agent. Furthermore, it has 362 been shown that CEACAM1-S isoforms and soluble isoforms (CEACAM1-4C1, -3, -3C2) also have 363 regulatory effects (stimulatory or inhibitory) on CEACAM1-L isoforms (20, 52). Although 364 CEACAM1-Ls are the dominate isoforms, the involvement of other CEACAM1 isoforms in influenza 365 immunity should also be further investigated, especially as H5N1 infection increased mRNA 366 expression levels of several CEACAM1 variants (Fig. 3C) . 367\n\nIn summary, molecules on the cell surface such as CEACAM1 are particularly attractive 368 candidates for therapeutic development, as drugs do not need to cross the cell membrane in order to be 369 effective. Targeting of host-encoded genes in combination with current antivirals and vaccines may be 370 a way of reducing morbidity and mortality associated with influenza virus infection. Our study clearly 371 demonstrates that increased CEACAM1 expression is observed in primary human ATII cells infected 372 with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus.

ATII cells from three individual 422 donors were used for HiSeq analysis. Total RNA was extracted from cells using a RNeasy Mini kit 423 (Qiagen). Influenza-infected cells were washed with PBS three times and cells lysed with RLT buffer 424 supplemented with \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (10 \u03bcL/mL; Gibco). Cell lysates were homogenized with 425\n\nQIAshredder columns followed by on-column DNA digestion with the RNase-Free DNase Set 426 (Qiagen), and RNA extracted according to manufacturer's instructions. Initial QC was conducted to 427 ensure that the quantity and quality of RNA samples for HiSeq analysis met the following criteria; 1) 428 RNA samples had OD260/280 ratios between 1.8 and 2.0 as measured with NanoDrop TM 429 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific); 2) Sample concentrations were at a minimum of 100 ng/\u03bcl; 3) 430 RNA was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA integrity and quality were validated by the 431 presence of the sharp clear bands of 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA, with a 28S:18S ratio of 2:1, along 432 with the absence of genomic DNA and degraded RNA.
