{"title": "Sequence variation among SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Taiwan Keywords: 4 0", "body": "Twelve full viral genomes were resolved in this study either from virus isolates or 1 8 0 directly from specimens. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that these sequences were in 1 8 1 different clades, indicating that no major strain is currently circulating in Taiwan. A deletion in 1 8 2 ORF8 was found in one isolate, which has also been detected in patients in Singapore (10). Four 1 8 3 or fewer nucleotide differences were observed in the 5 genomes from clustered infections. author/funder. All rights reserved.

The genome 1 9 1 variation of these viruses is thought to facilitate successful adaption to the environment of 1 9 2 various hosts. However, previous studies showed that the mutation rates of RNA viruses vary in CoV-2 isolated from 5 patients from February 26 to March 9, 2020 in CGMH Taiwan revealed 1 9 5 only 4 mutations in their 29,903-nt genomic RNA. This suggests that the nucleotide substitution 1 9 6 rate is controlled during viral RNA replication. The nsp14 exoribonuclease encoded by several 1 9 7 coronaviruses plays a role in proofreading during genome replication (13, 14) ; further studies are 1 9 8 required to investigate the function of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 in replication fidelity.
