Naturally occurring antibody to DEA 1 is not present. a. Transfusion of DEA 1-positive blood into a DEA 1-negative recipient will result in anti-DEA 1 alloantibody synthesis and shortened lifespan of the transfused erythrocytes. b. Subsequent transfusions mismatched at that allele will result in an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. C. DEA 3 and 5 are present in low incidence, and naturally occurring antibody to these antigens can occur (Swisher et al., 1962; Hale, 1995) . D. DEA 4 is a high-incidence antigen with no naturally occurring antibody. A hemolytic transfusion reaction has been described in a DEA 4-negative dog given repeated transfusions of DEA 4-positive blood (Melzer et al., 2003) . E. DEA 7 is a soluble nonerythroid antigen that is adsorbed onto the RBC surface (Bull et al., 1975) , and dogs that are negative for DEA 7 may have naturally occurring anti-DEA 7 alloantibodies (Bull, 1990; Hale, 1995) .\n\nI. Transfusion medicine is a multidisciplinary science concerned with the proper use of blood or blood products in the treatment or prevention of disease. II. Optimal transfusion therapy requires knowledge of blood types and crossmatching procedures, blood sources and donor selection, blood collection and administration techniques, component therapy, transfusion reactions, and red blood cell (RBC) substitutes.\n\nI. Erythrocytes possess characteristic cell-surface glycolipid or glycoprotein antigens. A. A blood group system is a group of antigens produced by allelic genes located at a single locus and inherited independently of any other genes. Blood group systems are species specifi c. B. Animals commonly make antibodies against foreign blood group antigens. Naturally occurring alloantibodies may be a result of exposure to common environmental antigens that are similar or identical to foreign blood group antigens. C. The importance of any particular blood group system depends on both the frequency with which alloantibodies of the system occur and the characteristics of the alloantibody, such as titer, class, temperaturedependent activity, and ability to activate complement or agglutinate RBCs. II. Canine blood groups have the following characteristics:\n\nA. Current nomenclature uses the prefi x dog erythrocyte antigen (DEA) to describe canine blood types. 1. Antibodies or typing sera for some of the originally identifi ed canine blood groups are no longer available, and commercial typing sera currently test for six blood types in dogs (DEA 1.1, 1.2, 3, 4, 5, and 7). 2. Several of these blood types can occur together on the erythrocyte and may vary in frequency with breed, geographic location, and antisera used (Table  71 -1) (Bull, 1976; Giger et al., 1995; Hale, 1995) . B. DEA 1 is a four-allele system.\n\n1. Dogs can be DEA 1 negative, DEA 1.1 positive or DEA 1.2 positive. -Wenk et al., 1996) . C. The frequencies of feline blood types vary geographically and within breeds. 1. Type A is most common, with more than 95% of domestic shorthair (DSH) and domestic longhair (DLH) cats being typed as blood type A (Giger et al., 1989 ). 2. Type B is seen in a variety of cat breeds (Table 71-2) and is seen with higher frequency in DSH and DLH cats on the west coast of the United States (Giger et al., 1991) . D. Cats with type B erythrocytes have strong, naturally occurring anti-A hemagglutinins and hemolysins, consisting primarily of immunoglobulin (Ig) M and a lesser amount of IgG (Bucheler and Giger, 1993) . Transfusion of type A blood into a type B recipient will result in an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction following the fi rst transfusion. E. Cats with type A erythrocytes have a low titer of naturally occurring anti-B alloantibodies, consisting of IgM hemagglutinins and IgG and IgM hemolysins (Wilkerson et al., 1991 is available from Diamed North America, Inc. V. Crossmatching is very important.\n\nA. Crossmatching in dogs is advised, even at fi rst transfusion, to detect the presence of antibodies to blood groups. B. Crossmatching is imperative in dogs that have been transfused previously. C. Crossmatching in dogs does not indicate that the donor and recipient are the same blood type, and thus does not prevent sensitization. D. Crossmatching does not guarantee that a transfusion reaction from white blood cell, protein, or platelet incompatibility will not occur. E. Crossmatching is crucial in cats because of the high prevalence of naturally occurring alloantibodies. F. Crossmatching is divided into two parts (Box 71-1).\n\n1. In the major crossmatch, the recipient's plasma is mixed with the donor's RBCs. 2. In the minor crossmatch, the donor's plasma is mixed with the recipient's RBCs. G. A major crossmatch kit that uses gel tubes to detect a positive/incompatible response is commercially available (Midwest Animal Blood Services, Inc. (Wardrop, 2005) .\n\nCrossmatching Procedure\n\nObtain an anticoagulated (EDTA) and nonanticoagulated specimen of blood from animal and donor. 2. Centrifuge at 1000 \u03bc g (2500 to 3500 rpm) for 10 minutes and separate serum from RBCs. 3. Wash RBCs by adding 2 to 4 drops of EDTA blood to three quarters of a tube (12 \u03bc 75-mm size) of saline or phosphate-buffered saline, mixing and centrifuging for 1 minute at 1000 \u03bc g. Decant the saline and repeat three times. 4. After last wash, decant supernatant and resuspend cells with saline to give a 2% to 4% suspension (0.1 mL of RBCs in 2.4 mL saline gives a 4% suspension). 5. Make the following mixtures by adding the indicated amount of the well-mixed RBC suspension and serum to 12 \u03bc 75-mm tubes and mixing gently: a. Major crossmatch: 2 drops patient sera, 1 drop donor 2% to 4% RBC suspension b. Minor crossmatch: 2 drops donor sera, 1 drop patient 2% to 4% RBC suspension c. Include controls: 2 drops patient sera, 1 drop patient 2% to 4% RBC suspension and 2 drops donor sera, 1 drop donor 2% to 4% RBC suspension 6. Incubate tubes 15 to 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. 7. Centrifuge for 15 seconds (1000 \u03bc g). 8. Examine tubes for hemolysis and agglutination.\n\na. Rotate gently to observe cells coming off the red cell \"button\" in the bottom of the tube. b. In a compatible reaction, there is no hemolysis and the cells should float off freely, with no macroscopic or microscopic clumping/hemagglutination (compare to the control tubes). 9. Rouleaux formation can be falsely interpreted as agglutination. If rouleaux is suspected, a saline replacement technique can be used (replace serum with saline, mix, recentrifuge, and re-evaluate).\n\n5. Keep canine donors current on routine immunizations (distemper, adenovirus, parvovirus, coronavirus, rabies, leptospirosis, parainfl uenza). 6. Donor dogs should test negative for Dirofi laria immitis, and dogs in endemic areas should be on preventative therapy. 7. Fecal fl otation, hemograms, and chemistry profi les should also be performed to ensure the health of the donor. 8. Iron supplementation is advisable with frequent donation. D. Selection and maintenance of feline donors is as follows:\n\n1. Use feline donors in good physical condition, >3.5 kg, 1 to 7 years old, and having a PCV >35%. 2. Blood type A donors are essential, and ideally blood type B cats are also available for use. 3. Cats must be negative for feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodefi ciency virus, and Mycoplasma spp. 4. Screening for Bartonella spp. should also be considered (Wardrop, 2005) . 5. Keep feline donors current on routine immunizations (feline parvovirus, viral rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, rabies, FeLV). 6. Annual fecal fl otation, hemograms, and chemistry profi les are performed. 7. Consider iron supplementation with frequent donation.\n\nI. Canine blood collection A. Jugular venipuncture is performed with the dog sitting, or in lateral or sternal recumbency. B. Blood is collected by gravity or with the aid of a vacuum system into anticoagulant, such as ACD, citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) or derivatives. C. For whole blood, a single ACD, CPD or citratephosphate-dextrose-adenine (CPDA-1) plastic bag is used. D. For components, a CPD or CPDA-1 bag is used with sterilely attached satellite bags or an additive solution (e.g., Adsol, Optisol) system. E. If sedation is required, butorphanol (0.1 mg/kg IV) may be administered 15 minutes before collection (Hohenhaus, 2000) .\n\nA. Blood collection in cats generally requires sedation, and a combination of ketamine (1 to 2 mg/kg), diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) and atropine (0.01 mg/kg) can be administered IV (Griot-Wenk and . B. Inhalant anesthesia with sevofl urane has also been described (Troyer et al., 2005) . C. With the cat in sternal, lateral, or dorsal recumbency, blood is collected from the jugular vein into a syringe containing ACD, CPD, or CPDA-1 solutions (1 mL/9 mL blood), or heparin (5 units/mL blood). \n\nI. Whole blood is often centrifuged and processed into blood components, such as packed RBCs, plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate, by using multiple, sterilely connected plastic bags. II. Advantages to blood component therapy include better conservation of blood resources, longer storage of components, more specifi c therapy, and fewer complications from circulatory overload because of the minimal volume administered. III. Component types and indications are as follows:\n\nA. RBCs 1. Fresh whole blood provides coagulation factors, other proteins (albumin and globulins), RBCs, and platelets. a. It is used where multiple components are needed. b. Stored whole blood does not provide viable platelets or suffi cient labile coagulation factors. 2. Packed RBCs are the best product for most RBC needs and can be supplemented with plasma or platelets if needed. 3. The shelf life or expiration date of RBCs may vary with the anticoagulant-preservative used. 4. Whole blood can generally be stored for 3 to 4 weeks at 1\u00b0 to 6\u00b0 C, whereas packed RBCs in additive can be stored for 5 weeks (Wardrop, 1995) . B. Plasma 1. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is plasma that has been frozen within 6 hours of collection and stored at \u221218\u00b0 C or colder. a. It contains labile (V and VIII) and stable ( II, VII, IX, and X) coagulation proteins. b. It is used to treat hemophilia A, hemophilia B, von Willebrand disease, warfarin toxicity, or other factor defi ciencies."}
