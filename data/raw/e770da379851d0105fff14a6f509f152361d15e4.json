{"title": "Corresponding author(s): Michael Diamond", "body": "Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form is intended for publication with all accepted life science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. Every life science submission will use this form; some list items might not apply to an individual manuscript, but all fields must be completed for clarity.\n\nFor further information on the points included in this form, see Reporting Life Sciences Research. For further information on Nature Research policies, including our data availability policy, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist.\n\nPlease do not complete any field with \"not applicable\" or n/a. Refer to the help text for what text to use if an item is not relevant to your study. For final submission: please carefully check your responses for accuracy; you will not be able to make changes later.\n\nExperimental design 1. Sample size Describe how sample size was determined.\n\nWe used a power calculation (80% power, 0.05 type I error) to see an 3 to 5-fold effect in vivo (depending on data distribution), which was an n =10.\n\nDescribe any data exclusions.\n\nNo data were excluded\n\nDescribe the measures taken to verify the reproducibility of the experimental findings.\n\nAll cell culture experiments were repeated three independent times. In vivo experiments were performed by multiple laboratory members again with independent repeat experiments. Binding data (SPR and ELISA) were performed by different laboratories and achieved the same result.\n\nDescribe how samples/organisms/participants were allocated into experimental groups.\n\nNot randomized. There was no need to randomized animals for this study. However, the animals were purchased commercially, age-and sex-matched.\n\nDescribe whether the investigators were blinded to group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.\n\nNot blinded. Although the study was not blinded, key experiments were repeated independently by multiple members of the laboratory Note: all in vivo studies must report how sample size was determined and whether blinding and randomization were used.\n\nFor all figures and tables that use statistical methods, confirm that the following items are present in relevant figure legends (or in the Methods section if additional space is needed).\n\nThe exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement (animals, litters, cultures, etc.)\n\nA description of how samples were collected, noting whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly A statement indicating how many times each experiment was replicated\n\nThe statistical test(s) used and whether they are one-or two-sided Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section. For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the paper but not yet described in the published literature, software must be made available to editors and reviewers upon request. We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). Nature Methods guidance for providing algorithms and software for publication provides further information on this topic.\n\nPolicy information about availability of materials 8. Materials availability Indicate whether there are restrictions on availability of unique materials or if these materials are only available for distribution by a third party.\n\nThere are no restrictions. These will be available by MTA.\n\nDescribe the antibodies used and how they were validated for use in the system under study (i.e. assay and species).\n\nAnti-Mxra8 antibodies were validated by Western blotting, binding to recombinant protein, and binding to transfected cells.\n\n10. Eukaryotic cell lines a. State the source of each eukaryotic cell line used.\n\nMEFs were generated from C57BL/6 mouse embryos (Diamond laboratorty). Vero, NIH-3T3, HEK 293T, A549, HeLa, and HFF-1 were purchased from ATCC, Hs 633T was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (#89050201), Huh7 were provided by the Rice Laboratory, RPE were provided by M. Mahjoub, Washington University), JEG3 were provided by the Mysorekar laboratory (Washington University). U2OS cells were provided by the Cherry Laboratory (University of Pennsylvania). Primary human keratinocytes (KE, #102-05n), synovial fibroblasts (SF, #408-05a), osteoblasts (OB, #406-05f), chondrocytes (CH, #402-05f), and skeletal muscle cells (SMC, #S150-05f) were purchased from Cell Applications. Primary human dermal fibroblasts (DF, #CC-2509) were obtained from Lonza.\n\nAdditional cell lines used were HTR8/SV (provided by I. Mysorekar, Washington University), MRC5 (provided by D. Wang, Washington University), hCMEC/D3 (provided by R. Klein, Washington University), Jurkat (ATCC), Raji (ATCC), K562 (ATCC), HT1080 provided by J. Cooper, Washington University), and Hs 633T (#89050201, Sigma-Aldrich).\n\nb. Describe the method of cell line authentication used. None c. Report whether the cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination.\n\nAll cell lines were tested and judged free of mycoplasma contamination using a commercial kit. Primary cells were not tested d. If any of the cell lines used are listed in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by ICLAC, provide a scientific rationale for their use.\n\nNone"}
