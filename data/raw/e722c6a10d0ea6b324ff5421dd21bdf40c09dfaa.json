Among such sensors with different working principles, nanomechanical sensors have attracted much attention because of their remarkable features; high sensitivity, wide target range from small molecules to macromolecules, compatibility with industrial technologies, and so on [1] . A number of biological species such as viruses, proteins, bacteria, and cells have been investigated by means of nanomechanical sensors [2] .\n\nIn this chapter, we will briefly review the basics of nanomechanical sensors, focusing on a microcantilever, which is known as a representative geometry of nanomechanical sensors. In addition to the conventional cantilever, a nanomechanical sensor with a membrane-type geometry will be highlighted as a newly developed sensing platform with various notable features [3] [4] [5] . Since affinity of sensors to sensing targets is affected by the type of functional layers, so-called \"receptor layers,\" coated onto the sensor surface, it is important to properly design receptor layers depending on applications. Therefore, we will also discuss a strategy to realize an optimized receptor layer in terms of sensitivity and selectivity. Finally, the biological species measured by nanomechanical sensors will be summarized.\n\nA nanomechanical sensor is a mechanical structure that transduces analyte-induced stimuli into a signal via its structural change with nanometer precision. The definition of a nanomechanical sensor can also cover a mechanical transducer with nanometer scale. In either sense, a cantilever sensor is a representative example among various geometries.\n\nThe first chemical sensing application using a cantilever sensor was demonstrated by Gimzewski et al. in 1994 . They revealed that the static bending of a cantilever can be used as a calorimeter, which can detect the catalytic reaction taking place on the surface of a cantilever [6] . In the same year, Thundat et al. demonstrated a mass detection with picogram resolution using a cantilever. They focused on the shifts in cantilever resonance frequency induced by the exposure of a metal-coated cantilever to humidity or vapors of mercury [7] . Then, the target of cantilever sensors expanded to various phenomena, such as the formation of self-assembled monolayers [8] and the hybridization of DNA [9] .\n\nAs demonstrated by various groups, nanomechanical sensors are applicable to a wide variety of targets. To take advantage of their attractive feature, it is important to understand the basics of nanomechanical sensors. In the following sections, we will briefly review working principles and readout methods of cantilever sensors [10] . Then, recent developments in the field of nanomechanical sensing will be highlighted.\n\ncantilever sensors can detect the following two physical parameters: volume and/or mass of target molecules. Since all substances have volume and mass, we can measure almost any kind of substance by using cantilever sensors. To measure volume and mass of target molecules, there are basically two operation modes of cantilever sensors: static mode and dynamic mode (Fig. 4.3.1 ). Details will be described in the following sections.\n\nThe static mode is known as one of the representative operation modes of cantilever sensors; it measures surface stress, which is not easily measured with other sensing techniques. The major advantage of the static mode is that a cantilever is not affected by damping because the bending motion caused by the analyte-induced surface stress is slow enough, minimizing the damping in most cases. Since the damping of liquid media severely decreases the sensitivity in the dynamic mode, the static mode is a better option for measurements in a liquid environment. It does not require any complicated peripheral devices, such as actuators or high-frequency readout setups, which are usually necessary for dynamic mode measurements. however, there are several issues to be addressed in static mode operation. The longstanding issue is the difficulties in interpreting obtained signals. At present, there is no well-accepted consensus on the origin of surface stress. Although it is roughly regarded as a result of an increase in electrostatic or steric interactions between the adsorbed analytes on the surface of a cantilever, a comprehensive model is still missing. even for a model system of alkanethiols on a gold (111) surface, several explanations have been reported so far. Thus, the proper calibration should be performed for each application before the actual measurements.\n\nFor solid coating layers, a simple analytical model is proposed. It provides general reference values in terms of the strain induced in the coating layer [11, 12] . It will help toward analyzing the static behavior of cantilever sensors and various nanomechanical sensors in conjunction with physical properties of coating films as well as optimizing the films for higher sensitivity. The details of the analytical model will be discussed later.\n\nAnother difficulty in the interpretation of a signal is the time-dependent complicated behavior, especially in the cases of polymer coatings [13] possibly due to viscoelastic effects [14] .\n\nThe concept of dynamic mode operation is same as that for various resonators, such as a quartz crystal microbalance. In this mode, the resonance frequency shift is measured. This shift is due to the change in effective mass induced by the adsorption of analytes on a cantilever. Since signals can be directly correlated to the basic property of adsorbates, that is, mass, the dynamic mode is a useful and powerful technique to derive quantitative information. As the sensitivity generally depends on the resonance frequency determined by the size of a cantilever, a nanometer scale cantilever operated at very high frequency bands (\u223c30\u223c300 mhz) marked several milestones, such as \u223c7 zeptogram (10 -21 g) resolution (equivalent to \u223c30 xenon atoms) in a cryogenically cooled, ultrahigh vacuum (below 10 -10 torr) apparatus [15] , and the mass resolution less than 1 attogram (10 -18 g) in air at room temperature [16] . It is important to note that the bending of a cantilever is caused by the adsorbate-induced surface stress in the case of static mode (the gravity effect is almost negligible). Reproduced from Ref. [10] , with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\nThe induced mass change (\u2206m) for a rectangular cantilever with the length of l, thickness of t, width of w, and Young's modulus of E, can be calculated by the following eq. (4.3.1):\n\nwhere k = Ewt 3 /(4l 3 ) is a spring constant of the cantilever, and f 0 and f 1 are the eigenfrequencies before and after the mass change. This equation is derived through pure mechanics, assuming the ideal condition. Thus, in practical situations, several issues still remain. one of the most important issues is the damping effect induced by the surrounding media, as briefly described in the previous section. The damping severely lowers the performance of a cantilever sensor in terms of a low quality factor Q, especially in a liquid environment where Q becomes one-tenth of that in air, resulting in low resolution to track the resonance frequency. Braun and Ghatkesar et al. proposed and demonstrated an elegant way to circumvent the damping effect in a liquid environment using higher flexural modes [17] [18] [19] . They succeeded in detecting protein-ligand interactions in a physiological environment at a sensitivity of 2.5 pg/hz [17] , and demonstrated the significant improvement in quality factor of up to \u223c30 times with the 16th flexural mode [19] . other factors affecting the signals in the dynamic mode are adsorption-induced effects, such as surface stress and position dependence, which can either stiffen or soften the cantilever, thereby varying the spring constant. The relationship between the surface stress and stiffness of a cantilever has been intensively discussed [20] [21] [22] . lee et al. visually demonstrated the dependence of resonance frequency on a pattern of a gold layer on the surface of a cantilever [23] . In any case, we have to be careful about these effects when we analyze the signals obtained with the dynamic mode.\n\nThere are several readout methods to record responses of cantilever sensors [1] . In this section, we will introduce two representative readout methods: optical readout with a laser and electrical readout with a piezoresistor.\n\nThe most commonly used readout method is the so-called optical readout, which utilizes laser light emitted from, for example, a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VcSel). The laser is reflected on the surface of a cantilever and then the position is measured by a position-sensitive detector (PSD) (Fig. 4.3 .2). It gives high sensitivity in terms of signalto-noise ratio because of its relatively low noise. Another practical advantage of this method is that there is no requirement for wiring on a cantilever array sensor chip because both the source and detector of laser light are placed at remote positions. however, optical readout has several drawbacks when we consider actual applications. First of all, laser-related peripherals are bulky and expensive in most cases. For multiple cantilevers such as a cantilever array, the same number of laser sources must be prepared. While highly integrated VcSel or multiple optical fiber systems might be able to solve this problem, each laser light should be always aligned on each cantilever precisely. Thus, optical readout is not suitable for large one-or two-dimensional arrays. Another critical problem is the difficulty in measurements in opaque liquids, such as blood. In such a liquid, the optical signal is significantly attenuated owing to low transmission or refractive index change.\n\nPiezoresistive readout can be utilized by using a piezoresistive cantilever, in which a sensing element (piezoresistor) is embedded at the clamped end; thereby it is sometimes called a \"self-sensing\" cantilever ( Fig. 4.3 .3). In contrast to the optical readout method, no bulky and complex peripherals are required because a piezoresistive readout electrically measures the change in resistance of a piezoresistor with a simple circuit ( Fig. 4. 3.4). By means of the piezoresistive readout, it is also possible to perform measurements even in It is important to cover the piezoresistor with a passivation layer, such as silicon nitride, to prevent leakage of current, especially in the case of measurements in a liquid environment. Reprinted from Ref. [24] , with permission from Elsevier B.V. opaque liquids. In addition, because of its complementary metal-oxide semiconductor compatibility, the whole sensor unit including readout parts can be integrated into common semiconductor devices, such as mobile phones. It is also technically feasible by mass production to produce inexpensive disposal chips, which are important for various applications, especially for medical diagnosis. Thus, the piezoresistive readout has been regarded as one of the most promising approaches to overcome the problems arising from the optical readout. In spite of these inherent advantages, piezoresistive cantilevers have not been widely utilized for sensing applications because of their critically low sensitivity. In other words, they will open the door to the applications of nanomechanical sensors if the sensitivity of a piezoresistive cantilever can be significantly improved. Therefore, various trials have been made for more than a decade to improve the sensitivity of a piezoresistive cantilever toward practical uses. however, significant improvement in sensitivity has not been achieved to make piezoresistive detection comparable to the optical approach.\n\nVarious strategies have been proposed to improve the sensitivity of a piezoresistive cantilever by structural modification, such as making a through-hole [25, 26] , patterning of the cantilever surface [27] , or variation of geometrical parameters (e.g., length, width, and overall shapes) [28, 29] . Although these approaches gained some improvements in sensitivity (typically, a few tens of a percent, while up to \u223c5 times in some cases [29] ), significant enhancement has not been achieved. In this configuration, the differential signal is given as an output of the Wheatstone bridge, while it is also possible to place measurement and reference cantilevers in individual Wheatstone bridges and obtain differential signals by subtracting the output of the reference lever bridge from that of measurement lever bridge. Reproduced from Ref. [10] , with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\nTo realize the appropriate scheme for the enhanced sensitivity, it is important to note the basic properties of a piezoresistive cantilever for surface stress sensing [3] . one notable parameter is piezocoefficient. P-type piezoresistors created by boron diffusion onto a single-crystal silicon (100) surface can be effectively utilized because of its high piezocoefficient [30] [31] [32] . Plain stress (i.e., \u03c3 z = 0) is assumed because of the intrinsically two-dimensional feature of surface stress. In this case, relative resistance change can be described as follows [32, 33] :\n\nwhere \u03c0 44 (\u223c138.1 \u00d7 10 -11 Pa -1 ) is one of the fundamental piezoresistance coefficients of the silicon crystal. \u03c3 x , \u03c3 y , and \u03c3 z are stresses induced on the piezoresistor in the [110], [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , and [001] directions of the crystal, respectively. Based on this equation, both enhancement of \u03c3 x (\u03c3 y ) and suppression of \u03c3 y (\u03c3 x ) are required to yield a substantial amount of \u2206R/R. however, in the case of surface stress sensing, the stress is basically isotropic. In other words, \u03c3 x is almost equal to \u03c3 y , resulting in \u2206R/R \u223c0. Therefore, the resultant signal is virtually zero on the whole surface. Because of this intrinsic material property, it is difficult to significantly improve sensitivity as long as we consider simple cantilever-type structures.\n\nThrough a detailed structural investigation, a new geometry with high sensitivity was developed. This structure is called a membrane-type surface stress sensor (mSS, Fig. 4 .3.5a) [3] . In addition to the geometry, mSS was also optimized in terms of electric circuit. For p-type silicon (100), the relative resistance change with a current flow in the x-direction is given by eq. (4.3.2). In case all four resistors (R 1 \u223c R 4 ) are practically equal and that the relative resistance changes are small with \u2206R i /R i << 1 (i = 1 \u223c 4), the total output signal V out of the Wheatstone bridge can be approximated by:\n\nwhere V B is a bias voltage of the Wheatstone bridge. Thus, if the sign of the resistance changes \u2206R 1 and \u2206R 3 are opposite to those of \u2206R 2 and \u2206R 4 , the full Wheatstone bridge yields an amplification of another factor of 4. If we configure the mSS structure (i.e., membranetype structure), this condition is fulfilled since the dominant stresses induced on the membrane are \u03c3 x in R 1 , R 3 , and \u03c3 y in R 2 , R 4 , resulting in opposite signs for the relative resistance changes in each set of resistors. Therefore, the whole induced surface stress is efficiently utilized, and thus mSS realizes the following properties: high sensitivity, self-compensating low-drift operation with full Wheatstone bridge, and stable operation without a free end.\n\nIn this section, we focus on the fabrication of receptor layers. Nanomechanical sensors are usually coated with various kinds of materials, so-called \"receptor layers,\" where analytes are captured. The adsorbed/absorbed analytes then cause surface stress, which results in the deflection of nanomechanical sensing units. Therefore, the sensing features depend on the quality of the coating (i.e., surface roughness, a coffee ring, etc.) as well as physical/ chemical properties of receptor layers. A major factor that affects the quality of the coating is a coating method. Thus, we briefly review common coating techniques for the functionalization of nanomechanical sensors. effects of the coating quality will be discussed using a cantilever and mSS, focusing on reproducibility of measurements. We also show guidelines to design receptor layers; the structural optimization strategy for high sensitivity.\n\nconstant sensing performance is a crucial factor for the manufacture of sensors. loizeau et al. investigated the reproducibility of mSS comparing with a typical cantilever-based sensor [34] . For the practical coating methods such as inkjet spotting and spray coating, the coated receptor layer has a certain amount of roughness in thickness. Such roughness causes inhomogeneous surface stress on the sensors. The stability of the sensing signals for such inhomogeneous surface stress is investigated by means of finite element analysis (FeA), and the results are also confirmed experimentally [34] . The surface stress simulation was conducted for both the cantilever-based sensor and mSS. The surface stress of 0.2 N/m was nonuniformly applied to the sensors with the standard deviation of 5, 10, and 20%. one hundred cases were simulated for each sensor. Figure 4 .3.6 shows the distribution of the output signals. In the case of the cantilever-based sensor, the distribution of the output signals had almost the same standard deviations as the surface stress. on the other hand, the standard deviations of the output signals dramatically decreased for the mSS; approximately 50 times smaller than the standard deviations of the surface stress. These results indicate that the mSS has a higher stability for the inhomogeneous surface stress compared to a cantilever-based sensor. As the inhomogeneous surface stress is mainly caused by the roughness of the receptor layers, these results suggest that the mSS is less influenced by the quality of the coatings, leading to the higher uniformity of the sensing performance. The results of the FeA simulations were also confirmed experimentally (Fig. 4.3.7) . on the basis of the FeA simulation and the experimental results, the higher reproducibility of the mSS compared to a cantileverbased sensor was demonstrated; the output signal of the mSS is less influenced by the roughness of the receptor layer. This enhanced sensor-to-sensor repeatability leads not only to accurate and reliable data acquisition in research, but also to the mass production of nanomechanical sensors.\n\none of the important challenges of nanomechanical sensors is how to prepare receptor layers in a reproducible manner without any complicated apparatus. Drop casting and dipcoating are examples of fast and convenient coating methods. These methods, however, lead to coatings on both sides. In the case of a cantilever-based sensor with the optical (laser) readout method, the double-side coating does not work because the cantilever does not have measurable vertical deformation as shown in Fig. 4 .3.8b. In contrast to the optical readout case, signals are obtained with a double-side-coated piezoresistive cantilever sensor [35, 36] . An in-plane elongation caused by the surface stresses on both sides can be detected by the piezoresistor embedded at the clamped end (Fig. 4.3.8d) . however, only a local stress induced at the surface where the piezoresistor is embedded can be detected, leading to low sensitivity. Taking account of the conventional cantilever-type geometry and the material property of silicon, it is difficult to realize high sensitivity with the double-side coating.\n\nThe mSS geometry is an effective solution to overcome this issue [5] . The in-plane stress induced in the membrane can be detected at the four beams. (Fig. 4.3 .8g) or both sides (Fig. 4.3.8h) . The distribution of the relative resistance change (\u2206R/R) is presented by light and shade. large relative resistance changes can be observed for the singleside-coated mSS [3] . Although the signal is not as large as the single-side-coated mSS, the double-side-coated mSS also exhibits notable relative resistance changes. The doubleside-coated mSS yields approximately 37% of the relative resistance change observed with the single-side-coated mSS.\n\nTo demonstrate the feasibility of the double-side coating method, the mSS membrane was functionalized by simply dipping it into an aqueous solution containing polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Figure 4. 3.9a shows a photograph of a simple hand-operated dipping process. An mSS chip was dipped into the PVP aqueous solution, and then dried in air. The coated mSS was used to measure water vapor. Fig. 4 .3.9b shows the results of the measurements. Sufficient signal outputs are obtained with a good reproducibility. Such consistent signals from different channels would compensate the decreased sensitivity compared to the single-side-coated mSS because consistent signals from N channels improve the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of N 1/2 .\n\nAccording to a recent study [11] , deflection (signal intensity) of a nanomechanical sensor strongly depends on the thickness of a receptor layer. In this section, we focus on the analytical model that describes the relationship between deflection of a cantilever and various physical parameters of a cantilever itself and receptor layer on it. This analysis provides a practical guideline to optimize the thickness of a receptor layer. The Stoney's equation is widely used to estimate the deflection of a cantilever [37] . According to the Stoney's equation, the deflection of a cantilever (\u2206z) caused by surface stress (\u03c3 surf ) is written as: where E c and \u03bd c are the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, and l c and t c correspond to the length and thickness of a cantilever, respectively. Although this equation has been widely used, no parameters relating to a receptor layer are included. It leads to a large discrepancy for a cantilever with a relatively thick receptor layer.\n\nTo consider the effect of a receptor layer, Timoshenko beam theory, which was originally developed to analyze a bimetal strip, can be used [38] . Based on the Timoshenko beam theory, an analytical model for the static deflection of a cantilever sensor coated with a solid layer was derived. In a simple cantilever coated with a solid receptor layer as shown in Fig. 4.3 .10, the deflection of the cantilever is described as: where E f , \u03bd f , and t f are the Young's modulus, the Poisson's ratio, and the thickness of a receptor layer, and w c and w f are the width of a cantilever and a receptor layer, respectively. By replacing the strain of a coating film (\u03b5 f ) using the relations \u03b5 f = \u03c3 f (1 \u2212 \u03bd f )/E f or \u03c3 f = \u03c3 surf /t f , the deflection of a cantilever (\u2206z) can be described as a function of internal stress in the receptor layer (\u03c3 f ) or surface stress (\u03c3 surf ). In the case of t c \u226b t f and w c = w f , eq. (4.3.5) reduces to the Stoney's equation.\n\nTo verify this analytical result, FeA simulation was also performed for a cantilever with the same geometry. The results are shown in Fig. 4 .3.10b. The values obtained from the FeA simulation show a good agreement with the analytically derived curves. The Stoney's model and Sader's model are also drawn in Fig. 4 .3.10b, both of which show significant deviations from the FeA analysis [39] .\n\nThe thickness of a receptor layer can be optimized based on eq. (4.3.5). The deflection reaches maximum at t t-op , at which d\u2206z/dt becomes zero. In the case of w c = w f , t t-op can be written as: (4.3.8) where U c = E c (1 -\u03bd f ) and U f = E f (1 -\u03bd c ). Thus, one can easily find the optimum thickness of a receptor layer by using eqs. (4.3.7) and (4.3.8). \n\nAnalytes adsorbed/absorbed on a cantilever sensor can induce two-dimensional stress on the surface of the receptor layer (type A) or on the interface between the receptor layer and the cantilever (type B) as depicted in Fig. 4 .3.11. The type A stress is induced when the surface of a cantilever is modified by functional groups including self-assembled monolayers. Analytes that induce charge distribution at the interface by dipole interactions can cause the type B stress. here, we focus on these two cases [12] . The deflection of a cantilever sensor is investigated by FeA simulation. The length, width, and thickness of the cantilever are set at 500, 100, and 1 mm, respectively. The results are depicted in Fig. 4.3 .11c and d. The deflection is plotted as a function of thickness. As we have seen in the previous section, the deflection increases by decreasing the Young's modulus for the type A stress. There is an optimal thickness t t-op written as eq. (4.3.7). The Reprinted from Ref. [12] , with permission from the American Scientific Publishers. type B stress gives rise to even lower deflections compared to the type A stress. In contrast to the type A, the deflection monotonically decreases with increasing thickness regardless of Young's modulus.\n\nDetection of biomolecules is an important issue in various fields. For example, detection of biomarkers for cancer in an early stage could significantly reduce the mortality of the patients. Detection of glucose in blood enables us to monitor the blood sugar level, which is essential for diagnosis of diabetes. Biosensors that can detect infectious viruses in real time with high sensitivity are highly required with regard to the control of epidemics. In fundamental science, detection of physical forces generated by a single cell or a number of cells, which are known to show collective motion, is a major challenge to investigate various stimuli-responsive behaviors of cells. here, we focus on the sensing techniques for biomolecules using nanomechanical sensors. First, we give an overview of previous nanomechanical sensing studies related to the detection of biomolecules. Then, we describe the nanomechanical approach to detect cellular forces.\n\nmany biomolecules and microorganisms have been detected by means of nanomechanical sensors. Table 4 .3.1 summarizes the reported studies [40] . molecular recognition techniques play an important role in biosensing applications. Antigen-antibody interaction is one of the most powerful tools to detect biomolecules, making it possible to detect targets with high sensitivity and selectivity. Not only peptides including antigens and antibodies themselves, but also microorganisms such as viruses and fungi can be detected by antigen-antibody binding. Another promising technique to detect biomolecules is enzyme reactions. enzyme reactions can be applied to detect smaller biomolecules such as hydrogen peroxide and glucose.\n\nmechanobiology is a discipline at the interface of biology and engineering [88] . It focuses on how cells or tissues respond to mechanical stimuli. Since some diseases are known to closely correlate with mechanical changes in cellular systems, advances in mechanobiology lead to the development of mechanical therapies. moreover, it is reported that biomechanical forces trigger stem cell differentiation, implying its possible control [89] . Thus, mechanobiology has a great potential for the discovery of fundamental biological concepts as well as the development of mechanical therapies.\n\nTo investigate the mechanics in cellular systems, measuring the mechanical properties of living cells such as Young's modulus, surface tension, and force distribution is an important challenge [90] . Nanomechanical sensors have a distinct advantage over measuring the mechanical properties of cellular systems as the principle of nanomechanical sensors is based on the detection of strain/stress and the resultant deflection. maloney et al. reported the monitoring of single Aspergillus niger spore growth by means of functionalized cantilevers [91] . They detected the growth of single spores as changes in resonant frequency. It has been reported by Bischofs et al. that cell migration causes surface tension of \u223c2 mN/m, which is larger than the detection limit of the nanomechanical sensors with high sensitivity, such as optical readout cantilevers (typically 0.15-0.90 mN/m) and mSS (<0.1 mN/m) [3] . Thus, nanomechanical sensors would provide new grounds for exploring the mechanical properties of living cells. \n\nIn this chapter, we briefly overviewed the basics of nanomechanical sensing, focusing on the working principles and representative readout methods. Then, we reviewed a recently developed nanomechanical sensing platform; mSS, which has various practical advantages over conventional nanomechanical sensors. The analytical approach to designing a receptor layer with optimized sensitivity was explained. Since they can detect volume and/ or mass of analytes, nanomechanical sensors are promising devices for the measurements of diverse biomaterials, ranging from small molecules (e.g., volatile organic compounds, amino acid) to microorganisms (e.g., viruses, cells) as summarized in this chapter. In addition, application of nanomechanical sensors to mechanobiology, an emerging field of science, would provide new biological concepts; clarifying the mechanics in cellular systems and mechanical basis of tissue regulation."}
