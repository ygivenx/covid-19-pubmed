It is 3 important to address if the current infection control instructions based on active 4 ingredients are sufficient. We therefore determined the virucidal activity of two 5 alcohol-based hand rub solutions for hand disinfection recommended by the World 6\n\nHealth Organization (WHO), as well as commercially available alcohols. Efficient 7 SARS-CoV-2 inactivation was demonstrated for all tested alcohol-based disinfectants. 8\n\nThese findings show the successful inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 for the first time and 9 provide confidence in its use for the control of COVID-19.

As of March 6 th 2020 there are 1 101604 globally confirmed cases and related 3460 deaths 5 . Health care experts suspect 2 that a global pandemic is inevitable mainly because human-to-human transmission of 3 SARS-CoV-2 is very efficient and infected individuals can transmit the virus without 4 or with only mild symptoms 4 . Given that so far, no therapeutics or vaccines are 5 available, virus containment and prevention of infection are of highest priority. 6\n\nEffective hand hygiene is crucial to limit virus spread. Therefore, easily available but 7 efficient disinfectants are crucial. The World Health Organization's 'Guidelines for 8\n\nHand Hygiene in Health Care' suggests two alcohol-based formulations for hand 9 sanitization to reduce pathogen infectivity and spreading. These recommendations are 10 based on fast-acting and broad-spectrum of microbicidal activity, as well as easy 11 accessibility and safety 3 . We have previously shown that WHO formulation I and II 12 were able to inactivate the closely related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 6 Results 20 SARS-CoV-2 was highly susceptible to the WHO formulations (Fig. 1) . WHO 21 formulation I, based on 85 % ethanol, efficiently inactivated the virus with reduction 22 factors (RFs) of \uf0a3 5.9 and concentrations between 40 % -80 % (Fig. 1A) . Subsequent 23 regression analysis revealed similar inactivation profiles compared to SARS-CoV, 24 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

WHO formulation II, which is based on 75 % 2 isopropanol, demonstrated a better virucidal effect at low concentrations, with 3 complete viral inactivation and RFs of \uf0a3 5 at a minimal concentration of 30 % (Fig.  4   1B) . The regression analysis showed an inactivation profile of SARS-CoV-2, which 5 was in between SARS-CoV, BCoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 1B) . 6\n\nNext, we addressed the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 against the individual 7 components of the WHO recommended formulations which are also the main 8 ingredients of commercially available hand disinfections. Both alcohols, ethanol (Fig.  9 2A) and 2-propanol ( Fig. 2B) were able to reduce viral titers in 30 s exposure to 10 background levels with RFs between \uf0a3 4.8 and 5.9 after 30 sec. Furthermore, we could 11\n\nshow that a minimal concentration of 30 % ethanol or 2-propanol is sufficient for viral 12 inactivation (Fig. 2) .
