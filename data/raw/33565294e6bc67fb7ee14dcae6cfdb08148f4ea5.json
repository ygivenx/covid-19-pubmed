{"title": "and transmission of dengue across Pakistan", "body": "* Author for correspondence: moritz.kraemer@zoo.ox.ac.uk or rcreiner@indiana.edu\n\nAbstract: 25 26\n\nMacroscopic descriptions of populations commonly assume that encounters between 27 individuals are well mixed; i.e., each individual has an equal chance of coming into contact with 28 any other individual. Relaxing this assumption can be challenging though, due to the difficulty 29\n\nof acquiring detailed knowledge about the non-random nature of encounters. Here, we fitted a 30 mathematical model of dengue virus transmission to spatial time series data from Pakistan and 31 compared maximum-likelihood estimates of \"mixing parameters\" when disaggregating data 32\n\nacross an urban-rural gradient. We show that dynamics across this gradient are subject not 33 only to differing transmission intensities but also to differing strengths of nonlinearity due to 34 differences in mixing. We furthermore show that neglecting spatial variation in mixing can lead 35 to substantial underestimates of the level of effort needed to control a pathogen with vaccines 36 or other control efforts. We complement this analysis with relevant contemporary environmental 37 drivers of dengue.\n\nKeywords: dengue, epidemiology, heterogeneity, mixing, nonlinearity, spatial dynamics, Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease with a strong potential for spatial variation in mixing 93 (Brady et al. 2012; Bhatt et al. 2013) . The dominant vectors of dengue viruses (Aedes spp.) 94 thrive in areas where they are able to associate with humans, as humans provide not only a 95 preferred source of blood but also water containers that the mosquitoes use for egg laying and 96 for larval and pupal development (Morrison et al. 2008) . Two additional aspects of Aedes 97 ecology -limited dispersal distance of the mosquito (Harrington et al. 2005) and daytime biting 98 (Akram et al. 2009 ) -imply that human movement should be the primary means by which the 99 viruses spread spatially (Stoddard et al. 2009 ). Indeed, analyses of dengue transmission 100 dynamics at a variety of scales have strongly supported this hypothesis (Allicock et al. 2012; 101 Stoddard et al. 2013; Bhoomiboonchoo et al. 2014; Reiner et al. 2014) . To the extent that 102 human movement in dense urban environments is more well-mixed than elsewhere, there are 103 likely to be differences in the extent of inhomogeneous mixing in peri-urban and rural areas. 104 This is also presumably the case for directly transmitted pathogens, but with a potentially even 105 stronger discrepancy for dengue due to the urban-rural gradient in mosquito densities. 106\n\nTo assess the potential for spatial variation in the inhomogeneity of mixing as it pertains 108 dengue transmission, we performed an analysis of district-level time series of dengue 109 transmission in the Punjab province of Pakistan using a TSIR model with separate mixing 110 parameters for urban and rural districts. We likewise made estimates of the relationships 111 between density-independent transmission potential and putative drivers thereof, such as 112 temperature, to allow for the relative roles of extrinsic and intrinsic factors to be teased apart. 113\n\nFinally, we performed mathematical analyses of the fitted model to assess the significance of 114 spatial variation in mixing inhomogeneity for how time series data are interpreted and used to 115 Environmental conditions are instrumental in defining the risk of transmission of dengue (Bhatt 131 et al. 2013) . Transmission is limited by the availability of a competent disease vector. Due to a 132 lack of resources and political instability no comprehensive nation wide entomological surveys 133 have been performed in Pakistan. Therefore we use a probabilistic model to infer the 134 probability of occurrence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in Pakistan derived from a globally 135 comprehensive dataset containing more than 20,000 records for each species (Figure 1a and  136 b). Such model outputs have proven useful in identifying areas of risk of transmission of 137 dengue as well as malaria (Gething et al. 2011; Sinka et al. 2012; Bhatt et al. 2013) . Other 138 important environmental conditions defining the risk of transmission of dengue are 139 temperature, water availability, and vegetation cover (Messina et al. 2015) . To account for such 140 variation, raster layers of daytime land surface temperature (LST) were processed from the 141 MOD11A2 satellite, gap-filled to remove missing values, and then averaged to a monthly 142 temporal resolution for all four years (Weiss et al. 2015) . The density of vegetation coverage 143 has been shown to be associated with vector abundance (Eisen & Lozano-Fuentes 2009) . 144\n\nMoreover, vegetation indices are useful proxies for precipitation and may be used to derive the 145 author/funder.

The same method was again applied to derive the Enhanced Vegetation 147 Index (EVI) from the MOD11A2 satellite to produce 16 day and monthly pixel based estimates 148 for 2011-2014 ( Figure 1g ) (Weiss et al. 2014a) . Due to the inherent delay between rainfall and 149 daily temperature influencing mosquito population dynamics and those mosquitoes contributing 150 to an increase in DENV transmission, we consider both, the influence of the current 151 temperature, vegetation indices and precipitation, data on current transmission as well as the 152 values of those covariates the time step before (Figure 1f ). 153\n\nWe used population count estimates on a 100m resolution that were subsequently aggregated 154 up to match all other raster layers to a 5 km x 5 km resolution for the year 2015 155 (http://www.worldpop.org) (Figure 1e ). In a follow-up analysis to our primary investigation into 156 the climatological drivers of dengue transmission we included several density-based 157 covariates. We derived a weighted accessibility metric that includes both, population density 158 and urban accessibility, a metric commonly used to derive relative movement patterns (Uchida 159 & Nelson 2008; Tatem et al. 2012) . This map shows a friction surface, i.e. the time needed to 160 travel through a specific pixel (Figure 1d ). We also used an urban, peri-urban and rural 161 classification scheme to quantify patterns of urbanicity based on a globally available grid 162 \n\nwhere It,i is the number of infected and infectious individuals and St,i the number of susceptible 170 individuals, at time t in district i, Ni is the population of district i, and !,! is the covariate driven 171 contact rate. The mixing parameter for the ith district is given by ! ; when ! is equal to 1, the 172 population has homonegeous mixing where values less than one can either indicate 173 inhomogeneous mixing or a need to correct for the discretization of the continuous-time 174\n\nprocess. Finally, the error terms !,! are assumed to be independent and identically log-175 normally distributed random variables. For more details please see SI. 176\n\nModel selection: 178 author/funder.

The time-varying climatological covariates are all fit as 180 a smooth spline, while all other covariates enter !,! linearly. Additionally, unexplained 181 seasonal variation is accounted for using a 12-month periodic smooth spline. 182\n\nModel selection was performed using backwards selection. Two base models were 184 investigated. First, a climate only model was created using only the climatological and climate 185 suitability covariates. Second, a \"full\" model using the density-dependent covariates as well as 186 the climatological covariates were combined into a single model which was then subjected to 187 backwards selection. For both models the mixing coefficient was initially set equal for each 188 district and once a final model was arrived upon, the mixing coefficient for Lahore was allowed 189 to vary separately from the other coefficients. All model fitting was conducted using R (R Core To explore the potential significance of spatial variation in mixing parameters, we conducted an 197 analysis to probe the inherent mathematical tradeoff between the mixing parameter and the 198 density-independent transmission coefficient . Specifically, to answer the question, what 199 difference in local transmission would be necessary to account for a difference in mixing while 200 achieving identical transmission dynamics. To explore this, we used eqn. (1) to establish: 201 \n\nDescription of case distribution: 210 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Ongoing 211 transmission seems to be focal in three (Vehari, Rawlpindi and Lahore) districts and spread 212 through infective sparks to smaller more rural provinces. In early investigations, all hospitals 213 that reported dengue cases are located in areas with high EVI values indicating a clear 214 environmental signal (Figure 1b) . 215 216\n\nTo disentangle the different aspects of dengue dynamics and their drivers we used a model 218 containing only the climatological covariates and performing backwards model selection until 219 each covariate in the model was significant at a 5% level resulted in a model that explained 220 76.9% of the deviance and whose adjusted R-squared was 0.746. Amongst the yearly-221 averaged covariates, EVI and precipitation remained in the model as well as the derived Ae. To understand these differences the final model was then compared to a nested model where 235 the coefficient for Lahore was allowed to vary independently of all other districts. Deviance 236 explained increased to 77% and adjusted R-squared increased to 0.753. Further, the mixing 237 coefficient for Lahore ( = 0.74) was significantly larger than the mixing coefficient for the 238 other districts ( = 0.59, p-value=0.0068) ( Figure S1 ). The median R0 for Lahore was 239 estimated at 3.28, the highest for all districts. 240\n\nIn assess how far the variation of mixing coefficients can be explained by other covariates we 242 consider the possibility that movement accounts for the differences in the mixing coefficient 243 between Lahore and the other districts.

The resulting model 245 explained 78.6% of the variance, had an adjusted R-squared of 0.763 and is superior to the 246 final climatological model based on AIC (699.23 versus 714.83). Yearly averaged EVI, NDVI 247 and precipitation were all significant (p-values of 8.7 x 10 -5 , 0.00024, and 0.00028, 248 respectively). Again, the derived Ae. albopictus map was significant (p-value = 0.008163).

This regional 279 variability in mixing has direct implications for estimates of the basic reproductive number of 280 dengue in our study region and elsewhere. Although the potential for such bias in estimates of 281 the basic reproductive number has been shown in a theoretical context (Hu et al. 2013; Perkins 282 et al. 2013) , we provide quantitative estimates of the extent of this problem in interfacing 283 models with a rich spatio-temporal data set. Such analyses have implications for estimates of 284 population-level parameters not only for dengue but also for other infectious diseases (Bartlett 285 1960; Keeling & Grenfell 1997; Bj\u00f8rnstad et al. 2002; Smith et al. 2002; Keeling & Eames 286 2005; Kiss et al. 2008 ) and possibly even more broadly in ecology. 287\n\nWe revealed significant differences in mixing components between urban and rural settings 289 and found that a population-weighted urban accessibility metric was able to absorb differences 290 in mixing between these settings indicating that this specific covariate accounts for aspects 291 influencing mixing. Mixing is presumably influenced directly by human behavior and has been 292 shown to be highly unpredictable, largely dependent on the local context and the spatial and 293 temporal scale (Yang et al. 2014) . In this study however we could show that the density-294 dependent covariate selected was able to capture the influence of these key encounters on a 295 district level. Once differences in mixing were accounted for, estimated R0 values indicated 296 considerably larger differences between transmission potential in Lahore versus all other 297 districts. Synchronizing more accurate geo-referenced data would allow to assess the 298 importance of spatial scale on the relationship between \"mixing parameters\" and urban The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/018481 doi: bioRxiv preprint in rainfall, temperature, vegetation coverage or mosquito abundance will help guide 312 surveillance and control efforts targeted mostly towards the ecological aspects of mosquito 313 dispersal (Johansson 2015). Once infection occurs much debate has been focused around 314 optimizing intervention strategies to reduce disease incidence, which is largely determined by 315\n\nR0. The presented framework shows that the interaction between mixing parameters and force suggests that spread happens along major transport routes from Lahore to Karachi and north 332 to Rawalpindi. Using results presented here on mixing components and environmental drivers 333 will help pinpoint areas of major risk of importation more accurately especially in the case of 334 recurring epidemics. Using the fitted relationships of the environmental drivers of transmission 335 and R0 will enable future analyses and comparisons between diseases and geographic regions. 336\n\nIn this context it will be instrumental to integrate a variety of movement and social network 337 models with the evidence presented here to infer more accurately how the geographical spread 338 of dengue is determined.
