{"title": "Synthesis of benzopolycyclic cage amines: NMDA receptor antagonist, trypanocidal and antiviral activities", "body": "Amantadine and its dimethyl derivative memantine, are two low-affinity, uncompetitive NMDAR antagonists, clinically used to treat Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, respectively. 1 Amantadine and its analogue rimantadine also target the M2 ion-channel protein of the influenza A virus, having prophylactic and therapeutic activities in influenza A virus infections. However, many influenza virus strains have developed resistance to amantadine and rimantadine. 2 Finally, amantadine, rimantadine and related polycyclic amines possess trypanocidal properties (Fig. 1) . 3 Considering the interesting pharmacological profile of amantadine, rimantadine and memantine, these compounds are ideal leads in the development of new agents to treat excitotoxic NMDAR channel mediated neurodegenerative diseases, influenza infections or African trypanosomiasis.\n\nRecently, we started a research project directed to the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of new analogs of amantadine, memantine and rimantadine. So far, we have synthesized ring-contracted analogs of these drugs and found that they showed NMDA receptor antagonism, many of them being more potent than amantadine but less potent than memantine. 4 Moreover, several of these compounds displayed an anti-influenza activity very similar to that of amantadine. 5 We also found that oxapolycyclic amines such as 3-alkyl(2-oxadamantyl)-1-amines and 1,2,3,5,6,7-hexahydro-1,5:3,7-dimethano-4-benzoxonin-3-amines of general structures 1 and 2, respectively, were also active as NMDA receptor antagonists. While these compounds lacked anti-influenza activity, several of them displayed trypanocidal activity (Fig. 2) . 6 Although several 1,2,3,5,6,7-hexahydro-1,5:3,7-dimethano-4benzoxonin-3-amines, 2, displayed low micromolar activity as NMDA receptor antagonists, the presence of an hemiaminal subunit in these compounds may raise serious concerns about their stability and thus of their further development as therapeutical agents. In fact, it is known that NGP1-01, a micromolar NMDA receptor antagonist containing an hemiaminal unit, 7 decomposes easily in aqueous medium. In this Letter we wish to report the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of several benzopolycyclic amines derived from 3 (Fig. 2) . Several of these derivatives, that are devoid of the hemiaminal unit, show low micromolar NMDA receptor antagonist activity, although with higher IC 50 than the previously described oxa-analogues. Interestingly, several of the new derivatives are endowed with low micromolar trypanocidal activity while only one compound has anti-influenza activity.\n\nInspired by the work of Bishop et al., we prepared amine 3 from known diene 4. 9 Thus, Ritter-type transannular cyclization with chloroacetonitrile in acidic medium, 10 and subsequent cleavage of the chloroacetyl group in the resulting chloroacetamide 5 with thiourea led to amine 3 in medium overall yield. 11 Starting from amine 3 we have prepared several secondary and tertiary amines using classical methods in amine chemistry. Briefly, reductive alkylation of 3 with benzaldehyde and NaBH 3 CN led to 6 in 59% while reductive alkylation of 3 and 6 with formaldehyde and NaBH 3 CN furnished 7 and 11 in 55% and 75% yield, respectively. Hydrogenolysis of amine 7 led to secondary amine 8 in 74% yield. Alternatively, 8 was obtained by reaction of 3 with methyl chloroformate followed by LiAlH 4 -mediated reduction of the intermediate carbamate, in 28% overall yield. Alkylation of 3 with propargyl bromide led to a mixture of 9 and 10 that were separated by column chromatography. Finally, alkylation of 3 with 1,5-dibromopentane gave the piperidine derivative 12 in 35% yield (Scheme 1).\n\nTo evaluate if the synthesized compounds were able to antagonize NMDA receptors, we have measured its effect on the increase in intracellular calcium evoked by glutamate or NMDA (both 100 lM, in the presence of 10 lM of glycine) on rat cultured cerebellar granule neurons. 12 Inspection of the results shown in Table 1 reveals that piperidine derivative 12 had a value of IC 50 (NMDA) very similar to that of amantadine, while compounds 3, 8, 9 and 11 had values of IC 50 (NMDA) that were in the micromolar order, lower than amantadine but higher than memantine (Table 1) .\n\nBenzyl derivatives 6 and 7 were devoid of activity, in agreement with our previous results with derivatives of general structures 1 and 2, 6 but in striking contrast with NGP1-01, a low micromolar 6,7,8,9,10,11-hexahydro-5,7:9,11- NMDA receptor antagonist that features a benzyl group in its structure. 7 In our previous work with amines of general structure 2 we found that the NMDA receptor antagonist activity increased in going from the primary amine to the tertiary lower alkyl amine (R 1 @R 2 @R 3 @H; IC 50 = 35 lM; R 1 @R 3 @H, R 2 @CH 3 ; IC 50 = 6 lM; R 1 @R 2 @CH 3 , R 3 @H; IC 50 = 6 lM). However, the activity did not improved in going from 3 to 8 and 11.\n\nWe had previously found that the replacement of the methylene unit of C-2 in amantadine by an oxygen atom, as in compound 1 (R 1 @R 2 @R 3 @H), led to less potent NMDA receptor antagonists. 6a Taking into account the good activity of several of our oxapolycyclic amines of general structure 2, we expected that the replacement of the oxygen atom on these derivatives by a methylene unit, as in the newer derivatives herein reported, would lead to more potent NMDA receptor antagonists. In fact, amine 3 (IC 50 = 13.6 lM) is much more potent than the previously described amine 2 (R 1 @R 2 @H, R 3 @CH 3 ; IC 50 = 98 lM). However, this trend is not general, and, for example, amine 11 is 3 times less potent (IC 50 = 12 lM) than tertiary amine 2 (R 1 @R 2 @R 3 @CH 3 ; IC 50 = 4 lM).\n\nWorthy of note, the IC 50 of compound 8 as NMDA receptor antagonist is more than 20 times lower than its IC 50 as glutamate receptor antagonist, in a similar manner than has been found for memantine.\n\nHuman African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is caused by infection with protozoan parasites of the Trypanosoma brucei species complex. The disease is endemic in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, with upwards of 60 million people at risk. A process of antigenic variation prevents elimination of the parasite by the immune system, and the prospects of developing a vaccine are thought to be remote. New drugs against HAT are therefore a major priority. Drugs currently available against HAT are characterized by problems including toxicity, limited efficacy, cost and the need to administer under medical supervision.\n\nThe anti-influenza virus drug rimantadine has been shown to be active in vitro against bloodstream form T. brucei and other adamantane derivatives have even greater activity. 3,4,13 Moreover, very recently, we found that several derivatives of general structures 1 and 2 showed significant activity against bloodstream form T. brucei. 6 We therefore investigated if the newly synthesized polycyclic cage amines reported here also displayed significant activity against this parasite.\n\nA total of 7 compounds were tested. Of these, 11 displayed little or no inhibitory activity against cultured bloodstream form T. brucei at 5 lg mL \u00c01 (15-20 lM). However, compound 10 inhibited parasite growth, at a level comparable to memantine. More interestingly, compounds 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9 significantly inhibited parasite growth, at levels lower than rimantadine and memantine ( Table  2 ). The IC 90 of the more active compound, 9, was more than 4 times lower than that of rimantadine. Inspection of the results shown in Table 2 reveals that secondary amines 6, 8 and 9 were more potent than tertiary amines 7, 10 and 11.\n\nNone of the synthesized compounds was found to have antiviral activity against the enveloped DNA viruses herpes simplex virus (type 1 or type 2) or vaccinia virus; the enveloped RNA viruses feline coronavirus, parainfluenza-3 virus, respiratory syncytial virus, sindbis virus or Punta Toro virus; or the non-enveloped RNA viruses Coxsackievirus B4 and Reovirus-1.\n\nCompound 10 was active against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in HeLa cells, with an EC 50 (50% antiviral effective concentration) of 4 lM and a selectivity index (ratio of cytotoxic to antiviral concentration) of 25. Another compound, 12, was only weakly active (EC 50 = 54 lM). The antiviral data obtained by microscopy were confirmed by a colorimetric cell viability assay. However, both compounds were not active against VSV in HEL cells, which suggest that the anti-VSV activity may be cell type-dependent.\n\nIn the influenza virus assays, all compounds proved to be inactive against the A/H3N2 subtype and influenza B virus. Interestingly, benzyl derivative 6 displayed reasonable activity against the influenza A/H1N1 subtype (antiviral EC 50 = 10 lM). N CH 3 R' R Addition of the benzene ring to the adamantane nucleusis compatible with anti-trypanosoma and NMD Areceptor antagonist activities but detrimental for anti-influenza activity.\n\nA benzyl substituent is compatible with anti-trypanosoma activity but detrimental for NMDA antagonism.\n\nNMDA receptor antagonist activity is better when R=R'=H and R=R'=CH 3 .\n\nIntroduction of this methylene unit instead of the oxygen atom previously studied, improves the anti-trypanosoma activity. (IC 50 = 11.8 \u00b1 3.1 lM), and 9, the most potent compound as trypanocidal (IC 50 = 1.99 \u00b1 0.46 lM; IC 90 = 3.14 \u00b1 0.10 lM). It is well-known that the target of amantadine and rimantadine is the influenza A virus M2 channel protein and that a single S31N mutation in M2 renders the virus resistant to both drugs. 2, 14 As most of the currently circulating subtypes of influenza A virus, A/H3N2 and A/H1N1, carry the S31N mutation in M2, there is an urgent need for the development of novel anti-influenza drugs that are effective against the most common amantadine-resistant mutants. 15 The influenza A/PuertoRico/8/34 strain used for testing the activity of amine 6 has an M2 channel carrying two substituions associated with amantadine resistance, that is S31N and V27T. In order to assess if the target of 6 was the M2 protein, the inhibitory activity of 6 was tested on A/M2 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamps (TEV) technique. Amine 6, at 100 lM, was unable to inhibit the activity of the wild-type (amantadine-sensitive) and the S31N and the V27A (amantadine-resistant) mutants, thus suggesting that 6 interacts with a different target in the virus. Neither 3 nor 11 were able to inhibit the activity of the wild-type and the S31N and the V27A mutants.\n\nIn summary, we have synthesized and fully characterized several benzopolycyclic amines. Several of the derivatives were more potent than amantadine against NMDA-induced calcium increase in cerebellar granule neurons, although they were less potent than memantine. Several amines displayed a significant level of trypanocidal activity, being up to four times more potent than rimantadine. Figure 3 summarizes the main features of the SAR of these new compounds, including the most potent compounds.\n\nRegarding antiviral activity, compound 10 displayed anti-VSV activity in HeLa cells, but not in HEL cells, suggesting that its antiviral activity can be cell type-dependent. Finally, benzyl derivative 6, that is not active as NMDA receptor antagonist, is a low micromolar inhibitor of the influenza A/H1N1 subtype. Interestingly, this anti-viral activity is not mediated by M2 channel blocking.\n\nThe synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of more polycyclic cage amines are in progress.\n\nMelting points were determined in open capillary tubes. Unless otherwise stated, NMR spectra were recorded in CD 3 OD in the following spectrometers: 1 H NMR (500 MHz), 13 C NMR (100.6 MHz). Chemical shits (d) are reported in ppm related to internal tetramethylsilane (TMS). Assignments given for the NMR spectra are based on DEPT, COSY 1 H/ 1 H, HETCOR 1 H/ 13 C (HSQC and HMBC sequences for one bond and long range 1 H/ 13 C heterocorrelations, respectively) and NOESY experiments for selected compounds. For the MS and GC/MS analyses the sample was introduced directly or through a gas chromatograph. For GC/MS analyses a 30-meter column [5% diphenyl-95% dimethylpolysiloxane, conditions: 10 psi, initial temperature: 35\u00b0C (2 min), then heating at a range of 8\u00b0C/min till 300\u00b0C, then isothermic at 300\u00b0C] was used.

Accurate mass measurements were obtained using ESI technic. Absorption values in the IR spectra (KBr) are given as wave-numbers (cm \u00c01 ). Only the more intense bands are given. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel 60 \u00c5 (35-70 mesh).

Cells were loaded with 6 lM Fura-2 AM (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) for 45 min.\n\nAfterwards, the coverslip was mounted on a quartz cuvette containing a Locke-Hepes buffer using a special holder. Measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer LS-50B fluorometer equipped with a fast-filter accessory, under mild agitation and at 37\u00b0C. Analysis from each sample was recorded real-time during 1200 s. After stimulation with NMDA or glutamate (100 lM, in the presence of 10 lM glycine), increasing cumulative concentrations of the compound to be tested were added. The percentages of inhibition at every tested concentration were analyzed using a non-linear regression curve fitting (variable slope) by using the software GraphPad Prism 4.0.\n\nThe antiviral activity of the compounds was determined in established cell culture assays using a selection of DNA and RNA viruses, including three subtypes of influenza virus [A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1); A/Hong Kong/7/87 (H3N2) and B/Hong Kong/ 5/72]. 16 The compounds' inhibitory effect on virus replication as well as their cytotoxicity were monitored by microscopical examination, and confirmed by the colorimetric MTS cell viability assay.\n\nThe cDNA encoding the influenza A/Udorn/72 (A/M2) was inserted into pGEM3 vector for the expression on oocyte plasma membrane. A/M2 S31N and A/M2 V27A mutants were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The synthesis of mRNA and microinjection of oocytes have been described previously. 17 Macroscopic membrane current was recorded 48-72 h after injection as described previously. 18 The tested compounds were applied at pH 5.5 at various concentrations when the inward current reaches maximum. The compounds were applied for 2 min, and residual membrane current was compared with the membrane current before the application of compounds. Membrane currents were analyzed with pCLAMP 10.0 software package (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA).\n\nCultures of bloodstream form T. brucei (strain 427) were maintained at 37\u00b0C in modified Iscove's medium (pH 7.4). 19 Trypanocidal activity was assessed by growing parasites for 48 h in the presence of various drug concentrations and determining the levels which inhibited growth by 50% (IC 50 ) and 90% (IC 90 ). In the case of untreated cultures (volume 4 mL), cell densities increased from 0.25 \u00c2 10 5 to 1 \u00c2 10 6 cells mL \u00c01 over this period. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Cell densities at each drug concentration were determined using a hemocytometer (Weber Scientific International Ltd), and drug sensitivity was expressed as a percentage of growth of control cells."}
