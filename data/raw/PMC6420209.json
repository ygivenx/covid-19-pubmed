{"title": "Principles for targeting RNA with drug-like small molecules", "body": "The vast majority of small-molecule therapeutics in clinical use target proteins. Successful protein-targeted drugs include small molecules that bind proteins expressed by humans (Fig. 1) or those expressed by bacteria, viruses and other infectious organisms. If small-molecule therapeutics could be extended to modulate RNA, the landscape of targetable macromolecules would be expanded by more than an order of magnitude. For example, only roughly 1.5% of the human genome encodes proteins1,2. Within the roughly 20,000 expressed human proteins, 10\u201315% of these are thought to be disease-related3,4,5, meaning that disrupting or altering their activity is likely to have a therapeutically useful consequence. Within the group of disease-related proteins, many are termed 'undruggable', meaning that these molecules lack distinctive cleft-like motifs into which small molecules can bind with high specificity and affinity5. The net implication of this analysis is that de novo human-designed small-molecule drugs target a sliver (the 3.5% of drugged proteins) of a sliver (1.5% of the human genome that encodes proteins) of the human genome. Currently approved protein-targeted drugs interact therapeutically with fewer than 700 gene products6, meaning that only 0.05% of the human genome has been drugged (Fig. 1).\n\nRNA functions as a central conduit of information transfer in all biological systems7,8 and, in principle, there are numerous opportunities for creating small-molecule therapeutics targeting RNA. If mRNAs could be targeted, protein gene products could be modulated by upregulating or downregulating translation efficiency or by altering mRNA abundance or stability. By directly targeting mRNAs, activities of proteins that are very difficult to drug or undruggable might be modulated before or during their biogenesis. In addition, a large fraction of the human genome (~70%) is transcribed into non-coding RNAs (RNAs that function directly as RNA)9 (Fig. 1). One class of non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, are now well-validated therapeutic targets10,11. Humans probably produce more than 15,000 long non-coding RNAs12, and a subset of these may eventually prove to be good drug targets. In summary, if a fraction of the tens of thousands of mRNAs and non-coding RNAs were targetable, the extent of the druggable human genome could increase considerably.\n\nStrong proof of principle for RNA-targeted drugs has been provided by experiments and clinical trials using antisense oligonucleotides (several of which have gained regulatory approval), as well as preclinical studies with synthetic RNAs that redirect the cellular RNA interference (RNAi) machinery or that activate CRISPR-based systems10,11,13,14,15,16. Depending on the approach employed, it is possible to inhibit or to upregulate expression13,14 of particular mRNAs and to inhibit non-coding RNA function by targeting specific RNA sequences. However, these nucleic-acid-based approaches involve large, often highly charged molecules and present delivery challenges. Given the choice between an oligonucleotide-based therapy and a (currently hypothetical) small-molecule-based therapy that targets RNA, the small-molecule therapy would be preferred in many cases.\n\nA number of small molecules that alter RNA function have been identified, providing encouraging evidence that RNA-targeted small-molecule therapeutics could be developed. Some of these studies are based on molecules identified in natural systems. For example, many RNA riboswitch regulatory elements that bind diverse small-molecule metabolites and regulate gene expression have been characterized17, and small-molecule antibiotics produced by numerous bacterial species bind ribosomal RNA and interfere with translation18. Furthermore, a growing number of synthetic monovalent and multivalent molecules that bind to secondary structure elements or repeat-containing RNAs have been shown to modulate biological function19. This progress is helping to address scepticism that RNA could be a viable small-molecule drug target, but key challenges remain to be addressed.\n\nAny discussion of how to target RNA with small molecules needs to immediately acknowledge that no one currently knows how to create drug-like, RNA-targeted small molecules in a repeatable and scalable way. There is currently only a single human-designed and approved drug class that functions by binding RNA alone \u2014 the linezolid antibiotics, linezolid and tedizolid (Fig. 2). In our view, successful targeting of RNA in therapeutically useful ways with small molecules requires three distinct components: (1) identification of RNAs and RNA motifs with disease-related function, (2) use of screening approaches and libraries likely to identify drug-like molecules with appropriate pharmacological properties and (3) identification of and focus on RNA motifs with sufficient structural sophistication that make it likely that high affinity and specificity in small-molecule binding can be achieved. To date, most work has focused on therapeutically well-validated targets (component 1), and there has been a notable recent focus on screening against RNA targets with drug-like lead compounds (component 2). However \u2014 and critically in our view \u2014 considerations of target complexity and achievable selectivity (component 3) have been largely neglected. With this in mind, after overviewing the current state of small-molecule ligand discovery for RNA targets and some instructional examples, we present a set of hypotheses regarding how to target RNA with small molecules and guidelines for achieving this goal. This article is intended to be provocative, and we look forward to the feedback and responses that our ideas will engender.\n\nWe first reiterate that no one currently knows how to target RNA with drug-like small molecules in a scalable and reproducible way. Proof-of-principle examples exist (Figs. 2,3), but the most drug-like of these molecules were discovered based on phenotypic assays and were only later found to target RNA. The molecules discovered to date via strategies intentionally designed to target RNA generally suffer from trade-offs in drug-likeness and potency due to low information content and low pocket quality. Nonetheless, current examples are supportive of the fundamental targetability of RNA. We suspect that a wide variety of screening strategies \u2014 including phenotypic assays, high-throughput screening, fragment-based screening, small-molecule microarrays, other biophysical partitioning approaches, and structure-inspired and computationally assisted design \u2014 will eventually prove useful. In this light, we would like to propose the following guidelines for future efforts directed at RNA-targeted drug discovery.\n\n\u2022 Focus on RNA motifs of sufficient complexity that they will be unique, able to form high-quality pockets and capable of binding small-molecule ligands with high affinity. We think that good RNA targets should have 30 bits and a pocket. Such motifs are likely to be common in large RNAs. We posit that few good targetable pockets exist in the absence of high information content.\n\n\u2022 Be cautious of early attempts to define specialized privileged chemical scaffolds for targeting RNA. These might exist, but a lot more information is likely to be required before promising scaffolds can be defined. Instead, emphasize rules derived from decades of development of protein-targeted drugs. Most are likely to apply to RNA-targeted drugs as well.\n\n\u2022 De-emphasize 'lessons' from the ribosome. Due to their uniquely high concentration in cells, ribosomal RNAs are a special case. The only engagement expected for a ligand with micromolar affinity is a target that is present at micromolar concentration. Drugs targeting ribosomal RNAs thus achieve a unique kind of specificity by binding relatively weakly to the ribosome.\n\n\u2022 Be cautious in interpreting the results of studies focused on compounds that are highly basic, intercalating, strongly stacking and/or highly hydrophobic. These kinds of compounds may bind RNA with high affinity but are unlikely to show strong discrimination between target and off-target sites and are likely to be difficult to improve in a medicinal chemistry campaign.\n\n\u2022 Target RNA\u2013protein interactions or RNA elements stabilized by protein binding, as branaplam and SMA-C5 appear to do32,33. It is easy to imagine that recognition of a target-specific RNA element in conjunction with a general protein component of cellular metabolism or regulatory network might be a highly productive strategy for achieving both specificity (via a selective RNA-targeted component) and affinity (owing to the high information content of a protein interface).\n\n\u2022 Use methods that enable rapid identification of RNA motifs with high-information-content structures and high-quality pockets. A clear advantage of RNA over proteins is that tools, such as quantitative chemical probing approaches55,75,87, already exist that make it possible to identify high-information-content72,73 and structurally well-determined (low-entropy) target sites54,55, to examine the influence of the cellular environment on a specific RNA structure and to ensure that simplified screening constructs recapitulate the native RNA motif.\n\n\u2022 Develop additional tools and new refinements of current tools, including advanced structural biology and modelling strategies for RNAs with complex structures88,89,90. These technologies can then be leveraged to identify and rapidly characterize the subset of complex RNA structures with high-quality ligand-binding pockets and to rapidly assess the impact of ligand binding on the functions of these sites.\n\n\u2022 Implement reproducible strategies for connecting ligand binding to complex targets with clear therapeutic mechanisms. There is modest-to-good evidence that disrupting or stabilizing RNA structures near translation initiation sites can modulate gene expression in therapeutically useful ways13,64,91. There is some evidence that the binding of small molecules to mRNAs can modulate the efficiency of translation92,93. Both disrupting and stabilizing RNA\u2013protein interactions are therapeutically promising. Covalent drugs are gaining acceptance in the protein-targeting field; analogously, ligands that can form covalent linkages or induce cleavage at an RNA target site44,94 also hold promise.\n\nThree key components are necessary to enable effective, repeatable and scalable RNA-targeted drug discovery: (1) a therapeutically compelling RNA target, (2) a screening approach that will identify drug-like lead molecules with appropriate pharmacological properties and (3) the identification of RNA motifs with sufficient information content such that high-specificity and high-potency binding to a high-quality pocket is achieved. We are arguing for a broad change in strategy for creating RNA-targeted drugs. Much greater emphasis needs to be placed on the quality of the RNA target (component 3). Biologically well-validated RNA targets are important, of course, but much greater effort needs to be placed on ensuring the 'ligandability' of these targets. Ultimately, as we learn more about what constitutes a high-quality RNA target, RNA might prove to be no more difficult to drug than proteins. Indeed, given that targetable RNA motifs appear to be ubiquitous (Refs 17, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66 and Fig. 7d,e) and that the principles of RNA structure and folding are simpler than those for proteins95, we wonder if RNA might eventually prove to be more generically targetable than proteins. Success of RNA-targeted therapeutic discovery efforts would open up vast opportunities (Fig. 1) for modulating the functions of currently undruggable protein-mediated pathways and the non-coding transcriptome.\n\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations."}
