{"title": "", "body": "Recently infectious diseases have dramatically increased and become a major threat to public health, despite tremendous progress in medicinal chemistry. The impact is more acute in developing countries due to non availability of desired medicines and emergence of widespread drug resistance [1] . Infections caused by fungal species are common in immunocompromised patients and carry significant treatment cost and mortality [2] . Antibacterial resistance is a growing problem which necessitates the discovery of newer antibiotics with activity against resistant strains [3] .\n\nHydrazide derivatives have been claimed to possess antimicrobial [4] , antimycobacterial [5] , antitumour [6] , anti-inflammatory [7] , trypanocidal [8] , antimalarial [9] and anti-HIV activities [10] .\n\nQuantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR), one of the most important area in medicinal chemistry, gives information that is useful for drug design. QSAR models are mathematical equations relating chemical structure to a wide variety of physical, chemical and biological properties. The derived relationship between molecular descriptors and activity is used to estimate the property of other molecules and/or to find the parameters affecting the biological activity [11] .\n\nDiseases caused by herpesviruses play an important role in viral infections of humans especially the incidence of infections by herpes simplex virus (HSV) is high throughout the world. Clinical manifestations of diseases due to HSV range from mucosal ulcerations with HSV-1 (Herpes labialis) to ulcerating vesicular lesions with HSV-2 (Herpes genitalis). More rarely, HSV infections can result in keratoconjunctivitis, eczema herpeticatum, herpes encephalitis, generalized disseminated diseases in neonates and immunosuppressed patients [12] . Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a member of the Rhabdoviridae family, is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus that causes an economically important disease in cattle, horses and swine [13] .\n\nThe alphaviruses are pathogenic viruses with worldwide distribution. Infection can result in fever, rash, arthralgia or arthritis, lassitude, headache and myalgia. The prototypic alphavirus is Sindbis virus, which is transmitted to humans through mosquito bites [14] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a paramyxovirus, is an important cause of respiratory tract infection in infants, young children and adults [15] .\n\nThe enterovirus, Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) is considered to be the most important etiological agent of virus-induced acute and chronic myocarditis. Since, more than 65 enterovirus serotypes exist, it was not possible to generate a vaccine until now and considerable interest exists to develop antiviral compounds. So far, these virus infections are treated symptomatically because there are no virus-specific prophylactics and drugs available for clinical use [16] .\n\nInspired by the above facts and in continuation of our ongoing research program in the field of synthesis, antimicrobial activity and QSAR studies of medicinally important compounds [17e26], we hereby report the synthesis, antimicrobial activity, QSAR studies and antiviral evaluation of benzylidene hydrazides.\n\nThe synthesis of target compounds was carried out as depicted in Schemes 1 and 2. The different carboxylic acids were refluxed with ethanol in presence of sulphuric acid to yield their ethyl esters. The ethyl ester was refluxed with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol to yield the corresponding hydrazide which was then refluxed with benzaldehyde/o-chlorobenzaldehyde to yield the target acid hydrazones. The products were separated out by evaporating ethanol and recrystallized from ethanol to yield the pure compounds. The completion of reaction was monitored by single spot TLC on Merck silica gel G plates. All the compounds were obtained in appreciable yield and their physicochemical characteristics are presented in Table 1 .\n\nThe structures of the synthesized compounds (1e20) were ascertained on the basis of their consistent IR and NMR spectral characteristics. The presence of C]O functional group was marked by the appearance of stretching band around 1700 cm \u00c01 , which is the characteristic of an amide linkage. The appearance of stretching band around 3200 cm \u00c01 indicated the presence of NH linkage of amide bond of hydrazone. The presence of peaks slightly above and below 3000 cm \u00c01 indicated the presence of aromatic and aliphatic portion in synthesized compounds respectively. The appearance of aliphatic eC]Ce stretching band at 1658.5 cm \u00c01 in compound 5 indicates the presence of unsaturated sorbic acid moiety in its structure. In compound 9, the ArOCH 3 stretching at 1270.9 cm \u00c01 reveals the presence of methoxy group of veratric acid. The aromatic nitro stretching around 1350 cm \u00c01 (symmetric NO 2 stretching) and 1540 cm \u00c01 (asymmetric NO 2 stretching) depicts the presence of nitro functional group in synthesized compounds 10 and 20. The appearance of singlet signal ranging from d 8.10e10.47 ppm in compounds 1e20 confirms the presence of NH of hydrazide. The presence of aromatic hydrogens was confirmed by the multiplet signal in the range of d 7.0e8.0 ppm. The appearance of triplet signal at d 0.82e0.89 ppm in compounds 1 and 13 reveals the presence of terminal methyl group. Further, in compound 9, singlet signal at d 3.92 ppm depicted the presence of methoxy group.\n\nBenzylidene hydrazides [1e20] were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Gram-negative Escherichia coli and antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger by serial dilution method [27] using ciprofloxacin and fluconazole as reference standards for antibacterial and antifungal activity respectively and the results are presented in Table 2 .\n\nFor antifungal activity against A. niger compounds 9, 10, 16 and 18 have shown marked antifungal potential having pMIC value greater than 1.60 as compared to other synthesized derivatives. In case of C. albicans compounds 4, 13, 19 and 20 were found to be most active with pMIC value 2.09, 2.10, 2.01 and 2.05 respectively.\n\nIn case of S. aureus compounds 13 and 14 emerged as effective antibacterial agent having pMIC value 1.50 and 1.53 respectively. In case of E. coli compounds 4 and 11 have shown good antibacterial capability at a pMIC value 1.79 and 1.80 respectively. For antibacterial activity against B. subtilis, compounds 4, 13 and 14 had shown good antibacterial potential with pMIC value of 1.49, 1.49 and 1.53 respectively. It can be seen from Table 2 that synthesized benzylidene hydrazides have higher antifungal potential as compared to their antibacterial activity.\n\nThe minimum bactericidal concentration/minimum fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC) ( Table 3 ) determination results revealed that the synthesized compounds were fungistatic against both fungi and bacteriostatic against S. aureus, but bactericidal against E. coli and B. subtilis. In general, the MBC and MFC of synthesized benzylidene derivatives were 3-fold higher than the MIC values which indicated that the synthesized compound were bacteriostatic and fungistatic in action except for B. subtilis and E. coli (a drug is considered to be bacteriostatic/fungistatic when its MBC and MFC values are 3-fold higher than its MIC values) [28] . In case of B. subtilis compounds 13 and 14 and for E. coli compounds 11e13 were found to be active bactericidal agents. on theoretical basis, we established a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) between their in vitro activity and descriptors coding for lipophilic, electronic, steric and topological properties of the molecules under consideration using the linear free energy relationship model (LFER) described by Hansch and Fujita [11] . Biological activity data determined as MIC values were first transformed into pMIC values and used as dependent variable in QSAR study. The different molecular descriptors (independent variables) like log of octanolewater partition coefficient (log P), molar refractivity (MR), Kier's molecular connectivity ( 0 c, 0 c v , 1 c, 1 c v , 2 c, 2 c v ) and shape (k 1 , ka 1, ka 2, ka 3 )\n\ntopological indices, Randic topological index (R), Balaban topological index (J), Wiener topological index (W), Total energy (Te), energies of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), dipole moment (m) and electronic energy (Ele.E), calculated for benzylidene hydrazides are presented in Table 4 [29e34]. Units of the energies and dipole were electron volts (eV), and atomic units (a.u.), respectively [35] .\n\nIn the present study, a data set of 20 benzylidene hydrazide derivatives was subjected to linear free energy regression analysis for model generation. The reference drugs were not included in model development as they belong to different structural series. Preliminary analysis was carried out in terms of correlation analysis. A correlation matrix constructed for antibacterial activity against S. aureus is presented in Table 5 . The correlations of different molecular descriptors with antibacterial and antifungal activity are presented in Table 6 . In general, high colinearity (r > 0.8) was observed between different parameters. The high interrelationship was observed between 0 c and Ele.E (r \u00bc 0.999), and low interrelationship was observed between 1 c and LUMO (r \u00bc 0.002). The correlation matrix indicated the predominance of topological parameters in describing the antibacterial and antifungal activity of synthesized compounds.\n\nThe antibacterial activity of synthesized benzylidene hydrazides against S. aureus is explained by the topological parameter, zero order molecular connectivity index (Eq. (1)).\n\nQSAR model for antibacterial activity against S. aureus Here and thereafter, n e number of data points, r e correlation coefficient, q 2 e cross-validated r 2 obtained by leave one out method, s e standard error of the estimate and F e Fischer statistics.\n\nAs the coefficient of 0 c in Eq. (1) is positive, therefore the antibacterial activity against S. aureus will increase with increase in value of 0 c. This is clearly evident from Table 4 (Table 2) respectively. Similarly, compounds 5, 7 and 8 having minimum 0 c values 11.64, 12.79 and 12.79 (Table 4) , have minimum antibacterial activity against S. aureus (Table 2 ). Topological indices are numerical quantifier of molecular topology and are sensitive to bonding pattern, symmetry, content of heteroatom as well as degree of complexity of atomic neighborhoods [36] . The zero order molecular connectivity index, 0 c, represents the molecules with unbranched structure.\n\nThe QSAR model expressed by Eq. (1) was cross-validated by its high q 2 values (q 2 \u00bc 0.953) obtained by leave one out (LOO) method. The value of q 2 greater than 0.5 is the basic requirement for qualifying a QSAR model to be valid one [37] . The comparison of observed and predicted antibacterial activities is presented in Table  7 . It can be seen from the results that the observed and predicted antibacterial activities lie close to each other as evidenced by their low residual values (Table 7) .\n\nEqs.\n\n(2)e(5) were developed to predict the antibacterial and antifungal activity of benzylidene hydrazides against B. subtilis, E. coli, C. albicans and A. niger.\n\nQSAR model for antibacterial activity against B. subtilis pMIC bs \u00bc \u00c00:000012 Ele:E \u00fe 1:084\n\nQSAR model for antibacterial activity against E. coli pMIC ec \u00bc 0:025 ka 1 \u00fe 0:975\n\nQSAR model for antifungal activity against C. albicans\n\nQSAR model for antifungal activity against A. niger pMIC an \u00bc \u00c00:046 ka 3 \u00fe 1:832\n\nIn case of B. subtilis, the developed QSAR model indicated the predominance of electronic energy in describing the antibacterial activity. The coefficient of electronic energy (Ele.E) is negative, which shows that the antibacterial activity will increase with the decrease in electronic energy of the synthesized compound, which can be clearly seen from the results of antibacterial activity against B. subtilis ( Table 2 ) and values of electronic energy presented in Table 4 . For antibacterial activity against E. coli, the developed QSAR model (Eq. (3)) describes the importance of Kier's alpha shape topological index (ka 1 ). In this case, the positive correlation was observed between ka 3 and antibacterial activity against E. coli. The model described by Eq. (4) depicted the importance of second order molecular connectivity index, 2 c, in describing the antifungal activity against C. albicans.\n\nThe model described by Eq. (5) demonstrated the importance of Kier's alpha shape topological index (ka 3 ) in describing the antifungal activity against A. niger. The negative correlation of molecular descriptor with antifungal activity reveals that decrease in value of ka 3 ( Table 4 ) will lead to increase in antifungal activity against A. niger. The low residual values presented in Table 7 are in agreement with the models expressed by Eqs. (2)e (5) .\n\nAs in case of Eq. (1), the high q 2 values supported the validity of developed QSAR models described by Eqs. 2, 3 and 5. It is important to note that Eqs. (2)e(5) were derived using the entire data set as there were no outliers in the data set. Even though the sample size and the 'Rule of Thumb' allowed us to go for development of tetraparametric model in multiple linear regression analysis, the high colinearity [21] among the parameters restricted us to go for monoparametric model only. The 'Rule of Thumb' gives information about the number of parameters to be selected for regression analysis in QSAR based on the number of compounds [38] . According to this rule for QSAR model development one should select one parameter for a five-compound data set.\n\nGenerally for QSAR studies, the biological activities of compounds should span 2e3 orders of magnitude. But in the present study the range of antibacterial and antifungal activities of the synthesized compounds is within one order of magnitude. But it is important to note that the predictability of the QSAR models developed in the present study is high evidenced by their low residual values. This is in accordance with results suggested by the Bajaj et al. [39] , who stated that the reliability of the QSAR model lies in its predictive ability even though the activity data are in the narrow range. Further, recent literature reveals that the QSAR have been applied to describe the relationship between narrow range of biological activity and physicochemical properties of the molecules [24,40e42] . When biological activity data lies in the narrow range, the presence of minimum standard deviation of the biological activity justifies its use in QSAR studies [24, 25] . The minimum standard deviation (Table 2 ) observed in the antimicrobial activity data justifies its use in QSAR studies. Some of the other statistically important ot-QSAR models are given in Table 8 .\n\nAccording to the above ot-QSAR models one should use five different equations with different errors to predict the activity of a new compound against the five microbial species. The ot-QSAR models, which are almost in all the literature, become unpractical or at less complicated to use when we have to predict to each compound results for more than one target. In these cases we have to develop one ot-QSAR for each target. However, very recently the interest has been increased in development of multi-target QSAR (mt-QSAR) models. In opposition to ot-QSAR, the mt-QSAR model is a single equation that considers the nature of molecular descriptors which are common and essential for describing the antibacterial and antifungal activity [43e47].\n\nIn the present study we have attempted to develop three different types of mt-QSAR models viz. mt-QSAR model for Table 4 Values of selected descriptors used in the regression analysis.\n\nComp.\n\nlog P Table 5 Correlation matrix for antibacterial activity of benzylidene hydrazides against S. aureus. Table 2 . These average activity values were also correlated with the molecular descriptors of synthesized compounds ( Table 6) .\n\nThe mt-QSAR model for antibacterial activity displayed the importance of both electronic energy (r \u00bc 0.925) and zero order molecular connectivity index, c 0 (r \u00bc 0.923), in describing the antibacterial activity of substituted benzylidene hydrazides, as the value of correlation coefficients in developed models (Eqs. (6) and (7) The mt-QSAR model for antifungal activity revealed the importance of third order molecular connectivity index ( 3 c) in describing antifungal activity. Table 9 Comparison of observed and predicted antimicrobial activity obtained by mt-QSAR models.\n\nComp. pMIC b (Eq. (6)) pMIC f (Eq. (8)) pMIC am (Eq. (9)) pMIC am MLR (Eq. (10) Further, in case of mt-QSAR model for antimicrobial activity higher regression coefficient was obtained when we go for multiple linear regression analysis. In multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis, the coefficient of regression (r) increases to 0.719 from 0.609 (in linear regression), thus leading to an increase in predictability of mt-QSAR models, which can be observed by the low residual values (Table 9 ). It was observed from mt-QSAR models (Eqs. (6)e(10)) that the antibacterial, antifungal and overall antimicrobial activity of synthesized substituted benzylidene hydrazides is governed by second order molecular connectivity index ( 2 c) and third order Kier's alpha shape index (ka 3 ).\n\nFrom the results of antimicrobial activity, the following structure activity relationship can be drawn:\n\n1. The compounds have shown marked antifungal potential as compared to antibacterial activity, which shows that different structural requirements are essential for antibacterial and antifungal activity. These results are similar to Sortino et al. [48] . 2. The synthesized compounds derived from o-chlorobenzaldehyde have shown higher activity as compared to those derived from benzaldehyde. This observation reveals the fact that presence of chloro substituent at ortho position increases the antibacterial and antifungal potential of the compounds. This fact is supported by the observations of Guven et al. [49] . 3. It can also be seen from the results of antibacterial and antifungal activity that the activity increases with increase in chain length of acid portion of synthesized compounds (1e4, 11e14) . This is similar to one of our previous reports [23] . 4. Compounds 6 and 16 derived from cinnamic acid have shown better activity as compared to other synthesized compounds. This may be due to the presence of extended conjugation in cinnamic acid portion and aromatic nucleus of aldehydes, which may be involved in binding of synthesized compound with the target site. This fact is supported by one of our earlier studies [24] . 5. The presence of electron withdrawing group (NO 2 ) in compounds 10 and 20 makes them highly active antibacterial and antifungal agents. The role of electron withdrawing group in increasing the antibacterial and antifungal activity is similar to the results of P. Sharma et al. [50] . The SAR results are summarized in Fig. 1 .\n\nThe antiviral screening of benzylidene/2-chlorobenzylidene hydrazides (1e20) was performed using an MTS-based CPE reduction assay [51] Compounds 5, 16 and 20 also have shown some antiviral potential but they have got high cytotoxic concentration values.\n\nA series of benzylidene hydrazides (1e20) were tested for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, B. subtilis, E. coli, C. albicans and A. niger. The results of antimicrobial activity indicated that compounds having chloro and nitro substituents were the most active ones. The results of MBC/MFC revealed that some of the compounds viz. 13, 14 and 11e13 were bactericidal against B. subtilis and E. coli respectively. The antiviral evaluation depicted that compounds 9 and 19 were active against Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in HeLa cell cultures. To understand the relationship between physicochemical parameters and antibacterial and antifungal activity of substituted benzylidene hydrazide derivatives, QSAR investigation was performed by development of one-target and multi-target models. The multi-target model was found to be effective in describing the antimicrobial activity of substituted hydrazides in comparison to the onetarget models. Further it indicated the importance of the topological parameters, second order molecular connectivity index ( 2 c) and third order Kier's alpha shape index (ka 3 ) in describing the antimicrobial activity of substituted hydrazides.\n\nMelting points were determined in open capillary tubes on a sonar melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Reaction progress was monitored by thin layer chromatography on silica gel sheets (Merck silica gel G) and purity of compounds was ascertained by single spot on TLC sheet. 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance II 400 NMR spectrometer using appropriate deuterated solvents and are expressed in parts per million (d, ppm) downfield from tetramethylsilane (internal standard). Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on Perkin Elmer FTIR spectrometer using KBr pellets.\n\nThe mixture of corresponding acid (0.08 mol) and ethanol (0.74 mol) was heated under reflux in the presence of sulphuric acid till the completion of reaction. Then, the reaction mixture was added to 200 mL ice cold water and the residual acid was removed by treatment with sodium bicarbonate. The ester formed was extracted with ether (50 mL). The ether layer was separated which on evaporation yielded the crude ester that was recrystallized from alcohol.\n\nHydrazine hydrate (99%) (0.015 mol) was added in ethanolic solution of ester (0.01 mol) and refluxed for 5 h. The reaction mixture was then cooled and the precipitates were filtered off, washed with water, dried and recrystallized from ethanol.\n\nThe solution of acid hydrazide (0.01 mol) and appropriate aldehyde (0.01 mol) in ethanol was refluxed for 4e5 h. The precipitates obtained were filtered off, washed with water and recrystallized from ethanol. \n\nThe antimicrobial activity was performed against Gram-positive bacteria: S. aureus, B. subtilis, Gram-negative bacterium: E. coli and fungal strains: C. albicans and A. niger. The standard and test samples were dissolved in DMSO to give a concentration of 100 mg/mL.\n\nThe minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by tube dilution method [27] . Dilutions of test and standard compounds were prepared in double strength nutrient broth e I.P. (bacteria) or Sabouraud dextrose broth I.P. [52] (fungi). The samples were incubated at 37 C for 24 h (bacteria), at 25 C for 7 days (A. niger) and at 37 C for 48 h (C. albicans), respectively, and the results were recorded in terms of MIC (the lowest concentration of test substance which inhibited the growth of microorganisms).\n\nThe minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and fungicidal concentration (MFC) were determined by subculturing on fresh medium 100 mL of culture from each tube that remained clear in the MIC determination. MBC and MFC values represent the lowest concentration of compound that produces a 99.9% end point reduction [53] .\n\nThe details of molecular descriptors are available in literature and therefore they are not discussed over here [29e34] . The structures of benzylidene hydrazide derivatives are first pre-optimized with the Molecular Mechanics Force Field (MM\u00fe) procedure included in Hyperchem 6.03 [54] and the resulting geometries are further refined by means of the semiempirical method PM3 (parametric Method-3). We chose a gradient norm limit of 0.01 kcal/ A for the geometry optimization. The lowest energy structure was used for each molecule to calculate physicochemical properties using TSAR 3.3 software for Windows [55] . Further, the regression analysis was performed using the SPSS software package [56] . The predictive powers of the equation were validated by determination of cross-validated r 2 (q 2 ) using leave one out (LOO) cross-validation method [57] . 50 ). Cells, grown to confluency in 96-well plates, were infected with 100 CCID 50 of virus, one CCID 50 being the 50% cell culture infective dose. After an adsorption period of 2 h at 37 C, virus was removed and serial dilutions of the compounds were added. The cultures were further incubated at 37 C for 3 days, until complete CPE was observed in the infected and untreated virus control.\n\nThe cytotoxicity of the compounds was evaluated in parallel with their antiviral activity in uninfected cells, and is expressed as minimum cytotoxic concentration to cause a microscopically detectable alteration of normal cell morphology (HEL cells, HeLa cells, CRFK cells, MDCK cells and Vero cells)."}
