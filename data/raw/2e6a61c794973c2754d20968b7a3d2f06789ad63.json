{"title": "ADIS R&D PROFILE Mismatched Double-Stranded RNA", "body": "Hemispherx has entered into a collaboration with RED Laboratories, and RED Laboratories NV expects that this will facilitate the continued development of Ampligen \u00ae . Hemispherx has also entered into an agreement with Schering Plough to use a Schering facility as its principal manufacturing platform in the US. This agreement may be expanded to include other territories.\n\nHemispherx and AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals have signed a marketing agreement for Ampligen \u00ae for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome for Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary.\n\nIn an arrangement between Hemispherx and Bioclones, Bioclones has certain marketing rights for Ampligen \u00ae in the Southern Hemisphere, UK and Ireland.\n\nIn the US, Ampligen \u00ae has been granted orphan drug status for the treatment of AIDS, renal cell carcinoma (phase II, completed), chronic fatigue syndrome (phase III) and invasive/metastatic malignant melanoma (phase II).\n\nIn August 2004, Hemispherx announced that it intends to use the proceeds from the private placement of company stock to complete the clinical work for its immunotherapeutics/ antivirals Ampligen \u00ae and Oragens\u2122.\n\nPreviously, Hemispherx submitted an application to the EMEA for the approval of Ampligen \u00ae for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome; the first stage of the regulatory review has been cleared. In 2000, Hemispherx Europe (Hemispherx) obtained orphan drug status for Ampligen \u00ae for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in the EU, providing Hemispherx with 10 years of marketing exclusivity following the launch of the drug, as well as potential financial research benefits for the agent.\n\nIn February 2000, Crystaal Corporation (now Biovail Pharmaceuticals Canada) acquired exclusive marketing rights to Ampligen \u00ae in Canada, where it submitted an NDA for the agent for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. In the meantime, Ampligen \u00ae has been available since May 1996 under the Canadian Emergency Drug Release Programme for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome and immune dysfunction syndrome by Rivex Pharma (Helix BioPharma).\n\nBioclones has initiated clinical studies with Ampligen \u00ae for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in Australia. The active substance for Ampligen \u00ae is manufactured by F.H. Faulding Ltd. Clinical treatment programmes for chronic fatigue syndrome in other Pacific Rim countries are planned. Ampligen \u00ae is available for severe chronic fatigue syndrome on a named patient, cost-recovery basis in South Africa.\n\nHemispherx has developed a 'ready-to-use' liquid formulation of the drug and has begun treating patients with chronic fatigue syndrome in ongoing clinical trials. Hemispherx has also developed an oral version of the drug (Oragen \u00ae ), which is undergoing preclinical evaluation.\n\nIn February 2001, Hemispherx Biopharma announced that it was initiating phase II/III trials of Ampligen \u00ae in the treatment of late-stage, multidrug-resistant strains of HIV in the European Union. Patients treated in these studies will have exhausted all other treatment options.\n\nIn July 2001, Hemispherx stated that Ampligen \u00ae was being evaluated in a phase IIb trial in patients with HIV in the US. The trial, comprising two studies, REARMI and REARMII (Research/Evaluation of Ampligen \u00ae for Retroviral Mutations I and II), will evaluate the ability of Ampligen \u00ae to prevent the emergence of mutated, drug-resistant strains of the virus. 'Several hundred' patients currently on antiretroviral therapy and at risk of viral relapse will be enrolled at centres in Connecticut, New York, Florida and California. A second phase IIb study evaluating the effect of Ampligen \u00ae on structured treatment interruptions (STI) is also underway. Final results from this study were reported in December 2002.\n\nNIH sponsored studies of potential therapies for SARS have identified Ampligen \u00ae as having unusually high and consistent antiviral activity against human coronavirus, the pathogen implicated as the causative agent of the disease. Ampligen \u00ae demonstrated very high potency at very low concentrations (0.4 \u03bcg/ mL) and had a favourable safety profile. [4] In October 2003, Hemispherx announced that, based on these promsing new results, the company will stockpile injectible and/or oral formats of Ampligen \u00ae and Alferon N \u00ae . [5] Independent researchers have demonstrated the antiviral activity of Ampligen \u00ae against flaviviruses (West Nile virus, Equine Encephalitis virus, Dengue fever virus and Japanese Encephalitis virus) as well as virus classes associated with bioterrorism. In an animal study, Ampligen \u00ae was shown to prevent destruction of nerve cells, reduce virus concentrations in the brain and blood stream and increase survival rates. [6] Researchers at the Rega Institute in Belgium have published results from an animal study demonstrating that Ampligen \u00ae was superior at protecting mice against coxsackie B3 virus-induced myocarditis compared with pegylated interferon. [7] In May 2004 Hemispherx announced that it had filed an expanded US patent application covering the use of Ampligen \u00ae for the potential treatment and prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and dreaded emerging viruses.\n\nDuring combination therapy with zidovudine and Ampligen \u00ae , toxicity was similar to that caused by zidovudine alone.
