{"title": "THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY AND IMPACT OF BACTERIAL tRNA 1 MODIFICATIONS 2", "body": "Compared to the total complement of 61 sense codons, most bacterial genomes contain only 25 -46 2 unique tRNA species (Grosjean, de Cr\u00e9cy-Lagard, & Marck, 2010) . This apparent shortfall in 3 decoding ability is mitigated by G::U wobble base pairing that allows a single tRNA to decode non-4 complementary codons (Crick, 1966) . Additionally, specific modifications to the first anticodon To address these gaps, we traced the evolutionary history of the five known bacterial tRNA 23 modifications at the first wobble base of the anticodon: (c)mnm5(s2)U (5-24 carboxymethylaminomethyl 2-thiouridine and its variants), cmo5U (uridine-5-oxyacetic acid), k2C 25\n\n(2-lysyl-cytidine), Q (Queuosine) and I (Inosine) (Bj\u00f6rk & Hagervall, 2014) . We first determined 26 the occurrence of each modification pathway in 1093 sequenced bacteria that represent the diversity 27 of eubacteria, and then used ancestral reconstruction to infer the major evolutionary gain or loss 28 events in the bacterial phylogeny. To determine the causes and impacts of change in tRNA 29 modification, we analyzed two other key components of translation: tRNA gene pools and codon 30 bias, thought to coevolve under translational selection (Ikemura, 1985; Kanaya, Yamada, Kudo, & 31 Ikemura, 1999) .

We suggest that the expanded tRNA set weakened selection 24\n\nfor MEs, allowing their repeated loss via drift. Conversely, in rare cases, a shrinking of tRNA 25 diversity may have favored the evolution of a novel modification; alternatively, the chance 26 evolution of a new modification may have relaxed selection on the tRNA pool. Our work represents 27 the first systematic analysis of the joint evolutionary history of tRNA modifications, genome GC 28 content and tRNA genes, and elucidates the role of tRNA modifications in the evolution of the 29 bacterial translation machinery. 30\n\n.

This relative evolutionary instability of QueG 24 corroborates a recent report suggesting that Tgt alone may be enough to generate the Q 25 modification (Zallot, Yuan, & de Cr\u00e9cy-Lagard, 2017). 26\n\nTo determine the key evolutionary changes in major tRNA modification pathways across bacteria, 27\n\nwe performed ancestral reconstruction with stochastic character mapping for each ME ( Fig. 1A ; 28 Table S1 ). We used a posterior probability value of \u2265 0.7 to assign the ME state at each internal 29 node in the bacterial phylogeny. Four of the five modification systems -MnmE-MnmG, Tgt-QueA-30\n\nQueG, TadA and TilS -were predicted to already occur at the root of the phylogenetic tree, i.e. 31\n\nwere present in the eubacterial ancestor (Fig. 1B) . In contrast, CmoA-CmoB were gained/evolved 32 much later: once at the root of \u03b3-proteobacteria, once in \u03b5-proteobacteria, and once in some species 33 of \u03b4-proteobacteria (Fig. 1B) .

These ancient modifications were then independently lost multiple times, 1 with a total of 12 major losses (on branches with at least 5 descendant bacterial species in our 2 phylogeny; Fig. 1B ) and 19 minor loss events (in lineages with fewer than five descendants; Fig.  3 S1). The only exception to this pattern of repeated ME gains/losses is the k2C modification (TilS), 4 which appears to be evolutionarily stable across bacteria. Overall, our analysis demonstrates a 5 highly dynamic evolutionary history of tRNA modifications that is dominated by repeated 6 secondary losses and only a few gains (a total of 44 loss events and 13 gains across the phylogeny; 7\n\nFig. S1). 8 9 tRNA modification loss is associated with more non-target tRNAs 10\n\nThe early evolution of nearly all tRNA modifications suggests that the eubacterial ancestor should 11 have been able to decode most sense codons using only a subset of all possible tRNAs. Indeed, 12 ancestral reconstruction of tRNA genes suggests that the eubacterial ancestor did have all target 13 tRNAs (excepttRNA Leu UUU ), but did not possess non-target tRNAs for the Q, k2C and I modifications 14 ( Fig. 1C ; note that 1C; note that the state of tRNA Arg UCG is ambiguous). Interestingly, for the 15 (c)mnm5(s2)U modification, both target and non-target tRNA were present in the eubacterial 16 ancestor. Thus, a subsequent loss of any of these modifications should be strongly associated with 17 the gain (or retention, in case of (c)mnm5(s2)U) of the respective non-target tRNA. Both 18 predictions were supported when we observed that the proportion of species that have non-target 19 tRNA is significantly different between bacteria with vs. without a specific modification (p < 0.05, 20 2-sample proportions test; Fig. S2 ). Overall, these patterns suggest that the loss of tRNA 21 modifications was associated with the retention or secondary gain of non-target tRNAs, and the 22 gain of MEs was associated with the loss of non-target tRNAs. 23\n\nTo account for phylogenetic relationships between analysed bacteria, we compared the tRNA gene 24 content of sister clades with contrasting modification status; i.e. following a major modification 25 gain or loss event (see Methods; Fig. 2 ). For instance, since the (c)mnm5(s2)U modification was 26 lost at the root of Actinobacteria (MnmE/MnmG enzymes, Fig. 1B) , we compared the tRNA gene 27 content of species within the Actinobacteria clade with that of species in the sister group: the 28 Cyanobacteria-Deinococcus-Thermus (CDT) clade. Similarly, we compared the target and non-29 target tRNA gene copy numbers for descendent sister clades for 14 of the 15 major modification 30 gain and loss events highlighted in Fig. 1B (we did not analyze Thermotogae, because its sister 31 clade would consist of all other bacteria). Of these, 4 cases involving the Q modification are not 32 informative with regard to non-target tRNAs because these are absent in all bacteria ( Fig. 2F-2I) . 33 .

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/251322 doi: bioRxiv preprint However, we describe these comparisons below since they are useful for understanding the 1 evolution of target tRNAs. 2\n\nIn most of the informative sister clade comparisons (8 out of 10 cases), species were more likely to 3 have non-target tRNAs if the modification was absent (compare bottom left vs. bottom right bar 4 plots within each panel of Fig. 2 ), supporting our hypothesis that modification loss (gain) is 5 associated with the presence (absence) of non-target tRNAs. For instance, in three out of the five 6 comparisons made for the (c)mnm5(s2)U and cmo5U modifications, at least 5 of the 6 non-target 7 tRNAs were present in a significantly higher proportion of species without the modification (Fig.  8 2A, 2C and 2D; p < 0.05, 2-sample proportions test). The two exceptions to this pattern occur in 9 clades with relatively low sample sizes ( Fig. 2B and 2E) , and may potentially reflect low statistical 10 power. Alternatively, these may be biologically interesting exceptions that require further 11 examination. Additionally, in all five comparisons made for the I modification, at least one non-12 target tRNA (in most cases both) was present in significantly more species without the 13 modification, compared to species with the modification (Fig. 2J -2N ; p < 0.05, 2-sample 14\n\nproportions test) . 15 In contrast to the wide variation in the occurrence of non-target tRNAs, we found that target tRNA 16 genes were largely stable irrespective of species' modification status (top row in each panel of Fig.  17 2). Contrary to expectation, the gain or loss of the (c)mnm5(s2)U and cmo5U modifications does 18 not appear to have any impact on target tRNAs ( Fig. 2A-2E ; p > 0.05, 2-sample proportions test); 19\n\nlikely because the corresponding codons are still used in these species and cannot be decoded by 20 non-target tRNAs. In the case of the Q modification, target tRNAs were always present; but in 2 of 21 4 comparisons their copy number was lower in clades that had lost the ME ( Together, these results suggest that except for the I modification, the evolution of modifications had 27 no impact on the evolution of target tRNA genes. 28 29 Modification status is associated with tRNA diversity, GC content and genome size 30\n\nTo identify the cause and impact of evolutionary changes in tRNA modifications, we compared key 31 translation-associated genomic features of sister clades with contrasting modification status.

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/251322 doi: bioRxiv preprint shown above, we found that in 11 of 14 comparisons, the tRNA diversity of sister clades was 1 significantly different (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test; Fig. 3 Fig. S3 ), indicating a strong 2 association between the evolution of modifications and the tRNA gene pool. However, in four of 3 these cases the direction of association opposed our initial expectation, and clades without the 4 modification had lower tRNA diversity (Figs. 3G, 3I, 3M and 3N). In three of these cases involving 5\n\nTenericutes and the endosymbiotic species from Enterobacterales (Figs. 3G, 3I and 3M), we also 6 observed a significant reduction in the total number of tRNA genes (Fig. S3G , S3I, S3M), 7\n\nsuggesting wide-ranging gene loss that is potentially a result of genome reduction in these clades. Bessho, 2013). Thus, overall half the sister clade comparisons supported our initial prediction that 11 the lack of modifications should be associated with greater tRNA diversity. Next, we tested whether 12 changes in modification status and tRNA genes were also associated with changes in GC content 13 and codon use. 14 In most cases showing altered tRNA diversity (8 out of 11), we found that the change in diversity 15 was also associated with significant shifts in GC content, so that species in clades without the tRNA 16 modification typically had more extreme GC3 values (i.e. GC content in the third base of codons, 17 biased codon use (measured as relative synonymous codon use RSCU for all proteins; p < 0.05, 20\n\nWilcoxon rank sum test; we observed similar results for RSCU of highly expressed ribosomal 21 proteins; Fig. S3 ). Finally, in five of the eight cases we observed significant differences in genome 22 size across sister clades (Fig. 3 ). Of these, in the two comparisons that involved Actinobacteria 23 (Figs. 3A and 3F) we observed that larger genomes were associated with the absence of the 24 modification. As mentioned above, in the other three cases involving Tenericutes and 25\n\nEnterobacterales (Figs. 3G, 3I and 3M), the lack of modification may reflect overall genome 26 reduction. Note that in every comparison where codon use and genome size were different, GC 27 content was also skewed significantly. Thus, to test the overall effect of genome size and GC 28 content on modification status, we carried out a phylogenetic regression. We found that both GC 29 content and genome size had a significant effect on the presence/absence of the Q modification 30 alone ( Fig S4) . These results suggest that except for the Q modification, modifications were lost in 31 only a few instances of shifts in GC content. Thus, GC content may be the major ultimate driver of 32 changes in tRNA gene content and the subsequent loss of modification may generate selection to fix 33 these changes. Altogether, three of the 14 major changes in modification status were not associated 34 with significant shifts in either tRNA or GC content, and remain unexplained. These included one 35 .

As expected, following major GC shifts, non-target tRNA showed several gain/loss 5 events whereas target tRNA were more stable (Figs. 4-6). As suggested by our sister clade 6 comparison, in some cases modification gain or loss was also preceded by a GC shift (8 out of 14 7 independent lineages). Moreover, a phylogenetic regression to test the impact of GC and MEs on 8 tRNA genes revealed that GC content had the strongest impact on the dynamics of non-target tRNA 9 genes (Fig. 7) . However, as observed in the sister clade comparison, the phylogenetic regression 10 and mapping also reveal clear instances of GC-independent impacts of modification status on tRNA 11 genes (Figs. 4-7). The strongest impact of tRNA modification is observed the case of the Inosine, 12\n\nwhere the target tRNA was present in all species when the modification was present (Fig. 6) ; and 13 the non-target tRNA were absent in most of these species (Fig. 2D ). On the other hand, the loss of 14 target tRNAs and presence of non-target tRNAs is strongly associated with the loss of the Inosine 15 modification (Fig. 2D, Fig. 6, Fig. 7) . Thus, the bacterial tRNA repertoire is strongly affected by 16 evolutionary changes in GC content as well as tRNA modifying enzymes. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/251322 doi: bioRxiv preprint in Proteobacteria, such a process may have led to the evolution of the novel cmo5U modification. 1\n\nAlternatively, Proteobacteria may have evolved the new modification by chance, secondarily 2 weakening selection on the non-target tRNAs. Interestingly, we also uncovered instances where 3 changes in tRNA or GC content could not explain the evolution of tRNA modifying enzymes. In 4 some of these cases, we suspect that overall genome reduction may have led to the loss of the 5 modification; but three major cases of modification loss remain unexplained (loss of (c)mnm5(s2)U 6\n\nin Leuconostoc and I in Spirochaetes and \u03b5-proteobacteria). Nonetheless, our results strongly 7 support the conclusion that ME evolution was dominated by frequent losses driven by weakened 8 selection. Note that reversing the direction of causality in our arguments would not make logical Our results were generally consistent with the prediction that a lack of specific tRNA modifications 17 should result in strong positive selection favoring the relevant non-target tRNAs. However, we also 18 observed some instructive exceptions to this pattern. For instance, comparing across sister clades, 19\n\nwe found that ~33% of the species that do not have the cmo5U modification also lack at least one 20 non-target tRNA. This should pose a problem because codons recognized by the missing non-target 21 tRNAs cannot be decoded efficiently. However, we observed that these codons were significantly 22 depleted in these genomes, compared to species that retained the non-target tRNA (Fig. S5) . Thus, 23 these relatively rare codons may not pose a major problem even if they are inefficiently translated. 24\n\nIt is also possible that these codons are decoded by the respective U-starting target tRNAs that can 25 pair with A, G or U ending codons (Grosjean et al., 2010) . This scenario is especially likely in 26 species where the Q modification is absent. Recall that all bacteria lack the non-target tRNA for this 27 modification; hence species without the Q modification should be unable to translate many codons. 28 We hypothesize that in species where both the Q modification as well as the non-target tRNA are 29 missing, there is an as yet undiscovered G::U wobble base pairing between the target tRNA and 30 codons complementary to the non-target tRNA in these species. 31\n\nOur analysis quantifies the role of specific tRNAs in the evolutionary dynamics of bacterial 32 translation, both as drivers of selection on tRNA modifications and as a means to rapidly respond to 33 shifts in genomic GC content. Specifically, we found that target tRNAs are evolutionarily largely 34 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

This 1 phylogeny was generated using an alignment of the 400 most conserved protein sequences across 2 all prokaryotes. We downloaded the phylogeny 3 (https://bitbucket.org/nsegata/phylophlan/wiki/bs_tree.reroot.nwk) and removed all archaea, as well 4 as bacteria whose genomes have not been fully sequenced. We pruned the tree further using a 5 distance based pruning function. Briefly, when closely related species had a pairwise phylogenetic 6 distance \u22640.03, we randomly sampled only one of these species. This allowed us to remove the 7 excessive representation of some highly sequenced genomes, such as several Escherichia coli 8 strains. This led to the final set of 1093 bacterial genomes that we used in our subsequent analyses. 9\n\nWe downloaded the tRNA gene copy numbers for each of these genomes from the Genomic tRNA 10 database (Chan & Lowe, 2009) . For genomes where this information was not available, we 11 determined the tRNA gene copy numbers by running the program tRNAscan-SE (Lowe & Eddy, 12 1996) using the default parameters for bacterial genomes. The information for each of these 13 genomes was represented using different identifiers in the various databases that we used. This 14 information is consolidated in Table S1 , consisting of: i) species name according to NCBI 15 taxonomy, ii) NCBI accession number, iii) Phylogenetic tree tip label in the tree, iv) IMG database 16 identifier and v) Genomic tRNA database abbreviation.

However, tRNA with GNN anticodons (where N is any nucleotide) in each of these codon 3 boxes can also recognize NNU codons via G::U wobble pairing. Thus, we only focused on the non-4 target tRNA that have CNN anticodons (indicated in Fig. 1C) . 5\n\nHomology search for tRNA MEs 6 We determined the presence/absence of all known tRNA MEs in the 1093 bacterial genomes using 7\n\nHidden Markov Model (HMM) searches (S. Eddy, 1998) . First, we downloaded all available 8 reviewed protein sequences for each of the MEs from the UniProt-KB database. We created a 9 multiple sequence alignment using the t-coffee program (Notredame, Higgins, & Heringa, 2000) 10 with default parameters. We used this alignment to build an HMM profile, and then used the 11 \"hmmsearch\" command in the HMMER suite (S. R. Eddy, 2009 ) to detect the presence/absence of 12 each ME. We used the amino acid sequences of all proteins from the 1093 genomes (downloaded in 13\n\nNovember 2016 from the NCBI ftp site) as the sequence search space, and set all other parameters 14 to default. Each search generated a table with accession numbers of potential homologous hits with 15 a corresponding e-value and bit-score. There is no consensus in the field with respect to setting an 16 e-value cut-off to detect true homologs. Here, we present a slightly informative method of deciding 17 e-value cut-offs for detecting true homologs. To infer presence/absence with precision, we 18 implemented a dynamic e-value cut-off to eliminate spurious hits. We did this by plotting the 19 number of species in which the ME would be detected as we increased the e-value cut-off (Fig. S6) . 20 We observed stable plateaus where the number of species in which an ME was detected did not 21 change despite changing the e-value cut-off, suggesting that these represent robust e-value 22 thresholds. Thus, for each enzyme we set an enzyme-specific e-value cut-off as the first e-value at 23 the beginning of the most stable plateau (see Fig. S6 ). For each ME, homologous hits that had e-24 values lower than this cut-off were considered true homologues. However, in our initial analysis we did not find CmoA and CmoB homologs in these or related 28 species. A closer inspection of the Bacillus subtilis genome also did not reveal these enzymes, as 29 indicated in a previous report (Grosjean et al., 2014) . Instead, there were a few entries for these 30 enzymes in the UniProt database (each with a poor annotation score). We therefore tested whether 31 these enzymes are true homologs of the proteobacterial CmoA and CmoB, using homology 32 detection (using 'jackhmmer'). We observed that only the query organisms showed the presence of 33 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

A survey of the SEED database (Overbeek et al., 2005 ) also 1 revealed the absence of CmoA and CmoB in all but one Bacillus species. When we carried out a 2 blastp analysis using CmoA and CmoB enzymes from Escherichia coli in Mycobacterium bovis str. 3 BCG, we observed no significant hits for CmoA and no hits for CmoB with e-values < 5e-3. Thus, 4\n\nalthough the modification may exist in several species, we could not reliably identify homologs of 5 the proteobacterial CmoA and CmoB in other bacteria. 6\n\nAncestral reconstruction of tRNA modifications, genomic GC content, and tRNA genes 7\n\nWe built a presence-absence matrix for each ME and used the binary state of each ME to infer gain 8 or loss events along the phylogeny. We used the stochastic character mapping (Bollback, 2006) 9 function in the phytools package in R, with the following parameters: transition rate matrix 10 determination method -Bayesian MCMC, prior distribution on the root node of the tree -11 estimated, number of simulations -500. We fixed the number of simulations such that the posterior 12 probability that an enzyme is present for 100 randomly sampled nodes did not change (Fig. S7) . We 13 used the enzyme with the most variable presence/absence state (queG) for this analysis, and 14 assumed that calculations for all other enzymes would be more stable. The mapping resulted in 500 15 enzyme states at each node of the tree. We determined probabilities of each state at each node and 16 assigned the state that had a posterior probability of \u2265 0.7 (Fig. S8 ) as the state of the enzyme at that 17 node. In case the probability was < 0.7, we assumed the same state at the node as the preceding 18 node. To determine gain and loss of tRNA modification pathways, we marked the branch that 19 succeeded the gain or loss of all MEs for a given modification as the focal branch. Only these 20 events are described in this study; however, all data for each enzyme are shown in Fig. S1 . 21 We determined the GC content at each ancestral node in the bacterial phylogeny using the 22\n\nStableTraits program (Elliot & Mooers, 2014) with 10 million iterations and all other parameters set 23 to default. We then determined 20 nodes whose two immediate descendants had the largest 24 difference in GC. Each of these nodes had at least 10 descendant species. These nodes representing 25 major GC shifts are shown on the phylogeny along with the ancestral GC content (Figs. 4 -6) . 26 We determined the evolutionary history of tRNA gains and losses using a similar method as 27 described for MEs. However, in this case we carried out the ancestral reconstruction separately for 28 each bacterial family, which allowed us to account for family-specific rates of evolution of tRNA 29 genes. We used the ancestral state of each tRNA at the root of each bacterial family to infer the 30 tRNA gene content of the eubacterial ancestor. Briefly, we converted tRNA gene copy numbers for 31 all species into a binary vector by changing the state of tRNA genes with multiple copies to \"1\" i.e. 32 .

We then carried out ancestral reconstruction using stochastic character mapping and noted 1 evolutionary transitions on the phylogenetic tree as before. 2\n\nWe identified clades where crucial enzymes for each tRNA modification were gained or lost, and 4 determined the closest sister clade where the state of modification was opposite to that of the focal 5 clade. We determined the sister clade agnostic of its taxonomic classification. We checked if there 6 were at least 5 descendant extant species in this clade for each gain or loss event. If this criterion 7\n\nwas not met, we picked the next closest sister clade neighboring the common ancestor of the above 8 two clades. Within each clade, we excluded species that had an opposite state for any of the MEs 9 involved in each modification. We assigned the identity of the comparison group using the lowest 10 level of taxonomic classification that encompassed the focal species. inferred that the reduced model was sufficient to explain tRNA presence/absence, and hence had a 23 significant impact on the evolution of the tRNA.
