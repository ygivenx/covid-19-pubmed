{"title": "Early Spread of SARS-Cov-2 in the Icelandic Population", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused clusters of severe respiratory illness in Wuhan, China in late 2019 1 should be characterized as a pandemic 6 . At great economic cost, many countries have adopted unprecedented measures to curb the spread of the virus such as large-scale use of isolation and quarantine, closing their borders, limits of public gathering and nation-wide lockdowns.\n\nEarly reports on COVID-19 case series from China and Italy indicate that SARS-CoV-2 causes a varying degree of illness 7, 8 with females and children being underrepresented among cases, in particular among severe and fatal cases. It is unclear if this is because females and children are less likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 or to develop COVID-19.\n\nThe first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Iceland was confirmed on February 28 2020 and by March 23, 588 individuals had been tested positive 9 . Iceland is an island with 364,000 inhabitants, with only one major gateway into the country, the international airport with 7 million passengers per year.\n\nHere, we show how SARS-CoV-2 entered Iceland and began to spread within the country. We used two strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing in Iceland, targeted testing of individuals at high risk of infection and a population screening of those who accepted an offer of free testing.\n\nThe genome of SARS-CoV-2 has been sequenced 2 , revealing close relationship to corona viruses such as SARS-CoV-1 10, 11 and MERS 12 and researchers have deposited 1034 SARS-CoV-2 sequences in GISAID 13 . We sequenced the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from those who tested positive to establish the origin of the virus and how it spreads in the population.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were identified in Iceland through both targeted testing of high-risk individuals and population screening. The targeted testing started on January 31 2020, and has focused on individuals at high risk of infection because they were symptomatic (cough, fever, aches, and shortness of breath) or coming from ski areas in Austria and northern Italy, their contacts and those who contacted the The registration for the test was online and during sample collection recent travels, contacts with positive individuals, and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 were registered. Over a six-day period 5,502 Icelanders were tested for SARS-CoV-2. All newly positives were placed in isolation and those who had been in contact with the positives, in quarantine for 2 weeks. All symptomatic individuals in quarantine were also tested. In addition to isolating positives and quarantining those at high risk of infection, on March 16 the Icelandic authorities initiated a ban on mass gathering above 100 people and stated that a social distancing of at least 2 meters should be maintained. On March 24, the ban on mass gathering was extended to 20 people. For .

RNA from all samples was isolated within 24 hours.\n\nAll individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were contacted by phone by a team designated by the authorities to track their infection. They were asked about their symptoms and when they started, recent travels and previous contacts with infected individuals. They were also asked to identify everyone whom they had been in contact with 24 hours before noticing their first symptom and for how long they interacted with each individual and how intimate the interaction was. All registered contacts were contacted by phone, requested to go into 2 weeks quarantine and asked about symptoms. Those with symptoms and those who developed them in quarantine were tested for SARS-CoV-2. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\n(which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044446 doi: medRxiv preprint run) using the Chemagic Viral RNA kit on the Chemagic360 instrument from Perkin Elmer, with 300/100 \u00b5L input/output volume(s), respectively. Each step in the workflow was monitored using an in-house LIMS (VirLab) with 2D barcoding (Greiner, 300 \u00b5L tubes) of all extracted samples.\n\nTesting for SARS-CoV-2 was performed either at LUH or deCODE using similar quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) methods. TaqMan\u2122 Fast Virus 1-step Master Mix, 2019-nCoV Assay kits v1 and 2019-nCov control kits were obtained from Thermo Fisher.

In addition, each assay mix contained VIC\u2122 dye labelled probes for human RNase P as internal control. Samples from 96-well RNA sample plate(s) were dispensed into three wells each in a 384 plate layout, in addition to three negative (no template) and three positive controls.

All of the negative samples tested negative at deCODE and 102 of the 104 positive tested at LUH were also positive at deCODE. Two samples that tested positive at LUH were negative at deCODE. Upon subsequent sequencing (see below) viral genome could not be detected in these samples, probably because very few viral particles were present.\n\nWe used Fisher's exact test to test for differences in frequency of positives below (or equal to) 10 years of age compared to older than 10 years of age and above 80 years of age compared to below (or equal to) 80 years of age. We used a likelihood ratio test based on logistic regression to calculate P values for differences in frequency of positives between sexes, using age and age squared as covariates. We used variance estimates based on binomial distribution to calculate 95% confidence intervals of fractions of positives.\n\nReverse transcription (RT) and multiplex PCR was performed based on information provided by the Artic Network initiative (https://artic.network/) to generate cDNA. In short, extracted viral RNA was pre-incubated at 65 \u00b0C for 5 min in the presence of random hexamers (2.5 \u00b5M) and dNTP\u00b4s (500 \u00b5M). Sample cooling on ice was then followed by RT using SuperScript IV (ThermoFisher) in the presence of DTT (5 mM) and\n\nRNaseOUT inhibitor (Thermo Fisher) for 10 min at 42\u00b0C, followed by 10 min at 70 \u00b0C.\n\n.

The primers were generously provided by Dr. David Stoddard at Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Two PCR reactions were done for each sample using primer pools A and B, respectively (Table S1) , Table S2 ).\n\nLigation reactions were incubated for 15 min at 20 \u00b0C.

Samples were diluted appropriately and denatured to a final loading concentration of 10 pM. All samples were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq sequencers using 300-cycle MiSeq v2 reagent kits (Illumina). Each pool was sequenced using dual indexed paired-end sequencing of 150*8*8*150 bp cycles of data acquisition and imaging with a run time of approximately 24 hrs. Basecalling was done in real time using MCS v3.1 and FASTQ files were generated using MiSeq Reporter. At least 15M PF reads (>4.5Gb) with base qualities of >Q30 for at least 90% of bases were collected for each run.\n\nAmplicon sequences were aligned to the reference genome of the SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) 2 using bwa mem 14 , possible PCR duplicates were marked with markduplicates from Picard tools 15 and reads with less than 50 bases aligned were omitted from the alignment. The resulting aligned filtered reads were used for variant calling with bcftools 14 . For consensus sequence generation only variants reported as homozygous were used. In regions targeted with primers we allowed variants to have allele frequency below one in individual. The consensus sequence was masked with ambiguous nucleotides (N) at positions if the depth of coverage was strictly less than 5 reads after restricting to bases of quality 20 or higher. Consensus sequences with more than 10,000 ambiguous nucleotides were discarded from analysis. The mutations in Table S3 were used to define haplogroups/clades. .

Less than a month later, March 22 2020, 528 individuals had tested positive for the virus out of 4,551 targeted for testing (11.6%) and 50 out of 5,502 participants of the population screening (0.9%) ( Table 1) Table 1 ). In the early targeted testing 40.1% of positives reported contact with a known infected individual, compared to 55.6% in the later. Of the positives from the population screening, 34.0% had recently traveled outside of Iceland, which is substantially more than the 13.7% of the negatives (P=0.00025), and only 6% of them reported contact with an infected person. This low number of contacts is most certainly because known contacts of infected persons were in quarantine and were not eligible for the population screening.\n\n.

For both sets, the positives are older and have a narrower age distribution (Table S1 ).\n\nSpecifically, out of the 354 and 433 individuals under the age of 10 only 10 (2.8%) and 0 (0.0%) tested positive in the targeted testing and population screening groups, respectively. This is substantially lower than the fraction of 12.3% (P=1.6e-9) and 1.0% (P=0.031) among the 4,551 and 5,502 individuals over 10 years of age in the targeted testing and population screening, respectively.

However, the fraction of males that tested positive was greater than the fraction of females: 14.6% vs 9.5% in the targeted testing were positive (P=6.8e-9 after adjusting for age) and 1.1% vs 0.7% in the population screening (P=0.070 after adjusting for age, Figure 2 ).\n\nWe sequenced RNA extracted from 378 positives and managed to cover more than 90% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome from 343 samples and 67% from 355 samples. We called 251 sequence variants, 128 of which were not found in the GISAID database ( Figure 3A) . We used clade informative mutations (Table S3) Figure 3B shows that several virus lineages (clades) have emerged during the 3-4 months since the original outbreak in China, with an average of 5 mutations separating them from the founding haplotype from Wuhan .

Most haplotypes from the early targeted testing were of the A2 clade (143 out of 157 haplotypes) (Figure 4) . By the time we initiated the population screening, all travelers returning from ski resorts in the Alps were requested to self-quarantine and were not eligible for participating, which resulted in a substantially different composition of haplotypes. For example, the A2a2 haplotype which was most commonly seen in travelers coming from Austria in the early targeted testing was much rarer in travelers in the population screening and completely absent from those who had not traveled.\n\nInterestingly, the A1a haplotype was more common in the population screening than the targeted testing with a total of 18 out of 39 haplotypes in the population screening compared to only 8 out of 157 haplotypes in the early targeted testing. It was one of the most common haplotypes in travelers in the population screen and it was by far the most common haplotypes seen in those who had not traveled.\n\n.

The A2a1 and A2a2 haplotypes which had collectively made up 103 out of 157 haplotypes (65.6%) in the early targeted testing were reduced to 44 of 144 haplotypes (30.6%) in the late targeted testing, mostly because of the increased frequency of the A1a and A2a haplotypes, the two most common haplotypes in the population screening. This is probably because the population screening identified clusters of infected individuals who seeded from areas that had not been designated as high-risk e.g. the UK. The later targeted testing was then more likely to find new individuals from these clusters, both because the targeted testing was extended to include more high-risk areas and because the population screening had identified cases that could be used to inform further contact tracking efforts.\n\nHaplotype analysis based on SARS-CoV-2 sequences overlaid on contact tracing networks show good concordance between the contacts identified by the tracing team and those based on viral sequences ( Figure 5A) . Of the 219 pairs of individuals found through contact tracing, 183 were consistent with the sequencing data. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044446 doi: medRxiv preprint through individual T48. Haplotype analysis showed that these individuals were infected by viruses with the A2a1 haplotype, which has more commonly been imported from northern Italy than Austria ( Table 2) Additionally, two individuals were also associated with this cluster (T110 and T111).\n\nHowever, they carry a distinct strain from the rest of the cluster, potentially acquired from travel to Denmark.\n\nThe rare mutations (24054C>T and 25958A>G) that we identified in the cluster outlined in Figure 5B are highly informative about domestic spread in Iceland. We searched for individuals carrying these mutations who were not reported to associate with this cluster. This resulted in two individuals who had probably been infected by someone in the cluster through an unknown contact: T347 who tested positive in targeted testing and T388 discovered through the population screening.\n\n.

They then through tracking identified other positive individuals whom they had been in contact with. For example, the top two individuals in Figure 5C tested positive in the population screening with a distinct A clade (A9) after travel to the UK. Their contacts were traced and three later tested positive through targeted testing with the A9 clade. Overall, our extensive genomic tracking adds resolution of tracing transmission routes.\n\n.

The conditions in Iceland are favorable for a study of this kind.\n\nThere is only one major gateway into the country and a single payer healthcare system with universal access. SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were identified both through targeted testing of individuals at high risk of infection and by population screening.\n\nAs of March 19, 5,502 individuals had participated in the population screening and of those 50 tested positive for the virus (0.9%). There are weaknesses in the design of this screening: the sample is not random as all residents of Iceland were invited to participate and those concerned about potential infection are more likely to participate than others. We asked people with symptoms of COVID-19 not to participate but to seek help in the healthcare system. However, close to half of participants reported symptoms, most commonly a rhinorrhea and coughing.\n\nThe healthcare system began testing of individuals considered to be at risk of infection on January 31 2020 and tested 65 before the first infected was identified on February 28. By March 22, 4,511 had been tested and 528 (11.6%) were positive. Hence those at high risk of infection were eleven times more likely to test positively.\n\nWe show here that young children and females are less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than adults and males, respectively. Others have shown that children and females are less likely to develop severe disease than adults and males, respectively 7,8 .\n\nThese results are consistent and suggest that children and females are less vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nTo further our understanding of the spread of the virus and to determine how the virus mutates as it spreads, we sequenced the virus from 357 individuals who had tested positive before March 19. The haplotype composition of the viruses from individuals identified through the population screening was different from those tested in the early targeted testing; more had the A1a haplotype and fewer had the A2a haplotypes. Hence, it looks like the haplotypes of the virus that are propagating in the general population come from a different source, perhaps brought in by people coming from countries that had not yet been designated high-risk areas. Furthermore, the sequence diversity in the virus from the population screening is greater than in the original targeted screening that was focused on people coming home from skiing in the Alps. Hence, it is likely that the virus has been carried into Iceland from many countries. The 0.9% frequency of the infection in the population screening indicates that the virus is spreading to the extent that unless we increase the screening effort we are likely to fail in our efforts to contain it.\n\n.
