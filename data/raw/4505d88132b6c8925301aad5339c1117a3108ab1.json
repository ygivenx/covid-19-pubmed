T he r eview is of great int erest in D. O. WHITE gives an excellent review of the discoveries about the proteins of influenza virus during the y ears 1971-1973. Most of the gene products can now be tentatively assigned to a structural or functional role in the virion or in the infected cell. The review gives the background information on the proteins of the virion, the hemagglutinin, the neuraminidase, the membrane protein and the nucleoprotein. The aspects of the synthesis of viral proteins and the gene: gene-product relationships are discussed. It is clearly pointed out which questions in influenza research rem a in to b e answered in the future.\n\nThe chapter on immunology and the melanomas by M. G. LEWIS deals with a problem about which much less is known than on the other topics in this volume. The present research in this field of tumour immunology gives rise to many questions without answering them and it seems that it is too ea rly to write a review on this matter .\n\nThe coronaviruses which are classified as a s eparate virus genus, primarily with respect to the morphological and chemical characteristics, are reviewed by K. McINTOSH. The review is concentrated on the comparative aspects of coronavirus virology. The examination of the nature of virus-cell interaction of animal coronavirus species, such as MHV, may elucidate factors leading to more successful cultivation of huma n strains. ROSE G. MAGE gives a r eview on altered quantitative expression of immunoglobulin allotypes in rabbits with background information on major allotypes and their structural correla t es and localization. Studies on the suppression of one allelic allotype in he terozygotes and in homozygotes and cellular studies of allotype suppression are reported. The report on the approaches to the determination of the mechanism is very interesting.\n\nThe excellent chapter on the SV. o (,S\u00bb antigen and other papovavirus-induced surface antigens by J.
