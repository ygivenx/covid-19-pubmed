{"title": "Prevalence, Severity and Mortality associated with COPD and Smoking in patients with COVID-19: A Rapid Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Authors contributions", "body": "The emergence in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China of a novel pneumonia of unknown origin on the 31 st of December, 2019 was the start of an outbreak which would later be declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) (1). The name COVID-19 (acronym for \"coronavirus disease 2019\") was coined on the 11 th of February 2020 to describe presentation with severe acute respiratory disease (2). COVID-19 is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus belongs to the family of single stranded RNA viruses some of which have been previously described to be responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (3, 4) . Although the symptoms and clinical presentation of COVID-19 is similar to SARS and MERS, the rate of spread is greater (5) . As of 25 th of March 2020, the total number of confirmed case of COVID-19 stands at 459,419 with 20,818 deaths globally and the number is projected to increase (6) .\n\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common, persistent and preventable dysfunction of the lung associated with limitation in airflow. COPD is a complex disease associated with abnormalities of the airway and/ or alveoli which is predominantly caused by exposure to noxious gases and particulates over a long period (7). With a global prevalence of 251 million cases in 2016, and 3.17 million (5%) deaths in 2015 alone, COPD was ranked by the WHO as the third leading cause of death especially with a particular burden in low-and middle-income countries (8, 9) . This burden is predicted to grow due mainly to increased global exposure to tobacco, aging populations, poor awareness and inadequate access to diagnosis (10) . COPD exacerbations are a major event in the natural history of the disease associated with worsening of symptoms often resulting in hospitalisation and poor prognosis (11) . Various factors have been described to contribute to acute worsening of COPD, however, viral infection remains the main trigger, including seasonal coronaviruses (12) (13) (14) .\n\n.

While over 150 papers,   editorials and comments have been written about COVID-19 as of 24 th of March 2020, there is none dedicated to the specific risk posed to patients with a previous history of COPD. This review addresses this gap in knowledge with the aim of assisting clinicians to assess the prognosis of COVID-19 infection in patients with COPD and those with smoking history.\n\nThis systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (15) . We prospectively submitted this review to Prospero (ID: 175518).\n\nWe searched MEDLINE and Google scholar from inception date to March 16, 2020. The search was updated on March 24, 2020. We used an extensive search strategy developed by a specilaised librarian for retrieving this type of evidence, which included the reference list of eligible papers and published pre-print papers (see supplementary Table S1 ). All retrieved studies were exported into EndNote to remove duplicates. The remaining studies were exported to Rayyan software for title, abstracts and full text screening by two independent reviewers.\n\nEligible studies were those that investigated: epidiomolgical, clinical charcterstics and features of COVID-19 and prevelance of chronic diseases specifically COPD in their analysis. We excluded the following: studies that did report COPD, studies that included respiratory diseases but did not specifically analyse COPD, only children, editorials, correspondence letters, reviews, qualitative studies, theses, non-English manuscripts and non-full text articles.\n\n.

Full-text articles of potential studies were then independently read by two authors to identify studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The reference lists from all identified studies and reviews were scrutinized for eligible articles.\n\nDisagreement on selected papers was resolved through discussion with a third author.\n\nTwo authers independently evaluated the methodological quality of included studies using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) (16). It includes seven domains, each one of these domains was scored from 0 (high risk of bias) to 3 (low risk of bias) and we took a mean of the domains to result in a score between 0 and 3, where a higher score represents a lower risk of bias. Any disagreement in the quality assessment was resolved by discussion with a third author.\n\nWe completed meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence of COPD and current smokers among those patients with confrmed COVID-19. The output was generated using the Stata procedure Metaprop. Owing to heterogeneity within and between studies, we used the random-effects model in Stata/SE 15. Data were displayed using forest plots. We examined between-study heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic. A narrative synthesis of the results was conducted considering the prevelance, disease severity and mortality among COVID-19 COPD patients and smoking status. We defined COVID-19 severity as those who were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), had severe, oxygenation, needed mechanical ventilation or death.\n\n.

After the first screening of title and abstracts, 61 papers were potentially relevant according to the inclusion criteria. An additional 46 papers were excluded after full-text review, which resulted in 15 studies that satisfied all criteria. The reference list of the relevant papers was also examined (see Figure 1 , PRISMA flow diagram).\n\nA summary of the included studies is presented in Table 1 , which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Of those patients, only 58 (2.3%) had COPD as a comorbidity. The sample size of the included studies ranged from 21 to 1099 patients. Most of the studies were retrospectively conducted and all were studied in China, except one in the United States. The risk of bias ranged from 0.4 to 2.7; nine studies scored \u2265 2, which indicates low risk of bias (see, Table S2 ). The overall crude mortality rate for COVID-19 was 7.4% (184/2473). There were no reports of the baseline characteristics of the 58 COPD patients that described their age, or severity of COPD airflow limitation. Smoking status was reported in eight studies, in which 221 confirmed COVID-19 cases were current smokers.\n\n.

We provide an updated report in relation to smokers (32) . Our main outcomes show that the prevalence of COPD in COVID-19 patients was low, but that the risk of severity (63%) and mortality (60%) were high, which indicates COPD patients with confirmed COVID-19 are at a greater risk of severe complications and death.\n\nFurthermore, the prevalence of current smokers in COVID-19 patients was 9% (95% CI, 4%-14%), and this was also associated with greater severity (22.30%) and mortality (38.5%).\n\nWe report a low prevalence of COPD patients in COVID-19 case series compared to the latest COPD prevalence rate in China, which was 13.6% (95% CI 12\u00b70-15\u00b72) and the global prevalence of COPD (9-10%) (33, 34) . We speculate that patients may have not been diagnosed. Having a reliable estimate of the prevalence of COPD in COVID-19 cases, and likely outcomes, is crucial to ensure specific successful global preventive and treatment strategies for COPD patients. Bearing this in mind, in the included studies there was no report on COPD severity data and COPD-related comorbidities, which prevents us from assessing the impact of such essential information.\n\nAlthough the COPD prevalence was not high in the included confirmed COVID-19 cases,\n\nThis summary agrees with other results currently available only in pre-print (35, 36) . Viral infections in COPD patients increase systemic inflammation with slow recovery of reported symptoms (37, 38) . In addition to the effects of COVID-19, patients with COPD have various comorbidities, some of which are associated with increased risk of hospitalisation (39) (40) (41) .\n\nAccording to recent systematic reviews, the prevalence of comorbidities in COVID-19\n\n.

Most of the studies that reported COPD severity defined severe cases as those who were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), had severe oxygenation, needed mechanical ventilation or death (18, 19, 22, 23, 27, 29) . These studies did not give details about the underlying COPD. It would have been interesting to know if the frequency of previous exacerbations was linked to increased complications in COPD patients diagnosed with COVID-19. In general, those with severe case of COVID-19 were older and had more coexisting comorbidities than those with mild illness.\n\nData from two studies (28, 30) describing COPD patients with confirmed COVID-19 show a higher mortality rate at 60%. This concurs with pre-print studies that found similarly high mortality rates (35, (44) (45) (46) (47) . Despite the small number of patients that were analysed, this increases concerns about the prognosis of this vulnerable population. However, this high mortality rate could be attributed to several factors. The majority of COPD patients have various comorbidities that may also be associated with mortality and related conditions may have been underreported because of the difficulties finding the specific cause of mortality (48) . Moreover, in patients with severe COPD, respiratory failure is the principal cause of mortality and this demands ICU intervention. It is possible that limited access to respiratory support as part of COVID-19 management may be contributing to this mortality, dependent on critical care capacity in each hospital or region. According to a recent COVID-19 report from Italy, the surge in patients requiring intensive care has been unmanageable, with 12% of positive cases requiring ICU admission (49) , more than that reported in China (18, 28). As a consequence, patients were dying because mechanical ventilation could not be offered, on top of acute shortage of clinicians who were able to manage those patients (50, 51) . Until now, the particular mechanisms of how COVID-19 increases COPD severity and mortality is .

(18, 29) . The impact of smoking history on vulnerability to COVID-19 has been explored but there is limited data on the contribution of tobacco smoking to the spread of and poor outcome in COVID-19. A recent systematic review on COVID-19 and smoking including five studies found that smoking was most likely associated with the negative outcomes. This recommended further research to explore this in more detail due to limited studies (32) . Evidence from other respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, has shown that inhaled tobacco smoke raises the transmission rate and severity of viral respiratory tract infections (53) . It seems there is underlying mechanisms behind this prevalence, as smoking has been related to higher expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) (pre-print) (54) . However, as more reports globally from diverse racial and genetic contexts become available, differences in the production of ACE2 can be further evaluated and linked to how they lead to COVID-19 vulnerability in different groups (55) .\n\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to systematically evaluate existing literature with a focus on risk of COVID-19 on COPD. For the first time, we conducted a meta-analysis using a random effects model to calculate the pooled prevalence of COPD in confirmed COVID-19 and examined outcomes. This increased the generalisability of our findings, as .

We showed that COPD and smoking in COVID-19 is associated with greater disease severity and higher mortality. This review has some limitations. Few studies were eligible for inclusion and most of them come from China. Second, heterogeneity exists in location, setting, and design. The reported clinical characteristics were not available in most of the studies at the time of analyses. This work has a number of clinical and research implications. It highlights the global prevalence and the clinical effects of COVID-19 on COPD patients and smokers.\n\nAs COPD patients are at an increased risk of severe outcomes if they became infected with COVID-19, it is recommended that patients and clinicians establish effective plans for ensuring prevention, such as using tele-medicine to ensure that COPD receive the best care (56, 57) . We strongly advocate public awareness campaigns concentrating on ways to achieve smoking cessation among smokers, and it is possible that an improvement in cessation rates will help to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms between COPD, smoking and COVID-19 infection.\n\nThough COPD prevalence in reported COVID-19 cases is low, COVID-19 infection is associated with significant severity and mortality in COPD. There was also increased risk of severe disease and mortality in current smokers. Effective preventive measures are urgently required to reduce COVID-19 risk on COPD patients and current smokers.\n\n.
