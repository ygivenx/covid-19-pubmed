The main driver of companies that specialize in genomics is human genome sequencing and most of the technology breakthroughs have been achieved to improve the speed and quality of human genome sequencing and to reduce its cost. Sanger sequencing was used for the 13-year-long Human Genome Project, which resulted in the first whole-genome sequence in 2003 for a budget of $2.7 billion. Five years later, the same result was obtained in 5 months for just $1.5 million (Voelkerding et al., 2009) . The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) part of the NIH awarded in 2008 more than $20 million in grants (the $1,000 Genome grants) to develop innovative sequencing technologies inexpensive and efficient enough to sequence a person's DNA as a routine part of biomedical research and health care for less than $1000. The 1000 Genomes Project, a China, Germany, UK, and US collaboration, is currently sequencing the whole genome from 2000 individuals worldwide to identify genetic variations (Via et al., 2010) . In the 1990s, microarray technologies have been developed to address mostly needs of human genomics. As of May 2010, 21,520 scientific papers using the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) proprietary microarray technology have been listed on the web site of the company (www.affymetrix.com). Microarrays have also been used for resequencing or gene expression monitoring of infectious agents. New sequencing technologies and instruments, referred to as Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), have appeared during the last 5 years and interestingly were first used to sequence the whole genome of human pathogens Mycoplasma genitalia (Margulies et al., 2005) and Escherichia coli (Shendure et al., 2005) .\n\nUnderstanding hosts, vectors, and pathogens' genomes, as well as their transcriptomic and epigenomic modifications following infection, during the course of the disease and under treatment will ultimately lead to personalized medicine for which genome characteristics will be important to tailor treatments (Snyder et al., 2010) .\n\nSeveral biotech companies have been created in the last 15 years to develop and market systems for the analysis of genomes, many of them by scientists issued from universities. Since then, they have often been acquired by larger companies that are major players in the field of in vitro diagnostics.\n\nCustomers of companies involved in genomics are both public and private organizations. Research laboratories from universities or institutes have different needs, which were, up to now, impossible to address with a single technology or instrument. Due to high prices of equipment and maintenance and frequent needs for instrument upgrade, platforms serving the needs of several research laboratories and providing services to the scientific community have emerged, which provide a full set of equipments and dedicated human resources.\n\nThe Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Cambridge, UK) is an example where such a platform, linked to bioinformatics resources serves different research projects, including a pathogen genetic group exploring parasites especially malariaand viruses genomics. The Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA, USA) is another example with a genome-sequencing platform that also considers fungi, bacteria, and virus genomes. The J. Craig Venter Institute, a not-for-profit private organization based in Rockville, Maryland (USA), has more than 500 scientists and staff, more than 250,000 square feet of laboratory and operates several resource centers (sequencing, genotyping, functional genomics, bioinformatics) for infectious disease genomics. In China, the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) from the Chinese Academy. of Sciences, based in Shenzhen and Hong Kong will have 3500 staff by the end of 2010 and has acquired 128 HiSeq 2000 NGS machines from Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) for sequence service and its own research projects, some of them on infectious diseases like the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus (Cyranoski, 2010) .\n\nSuch large institutes are not very numerous worldwide. However, they attract large international budgets that generate important sells for genomics companies in terms of instruments, maintenance, and reagents.\n\nGenomics platforms often provide services to remain competitive through return on investment. Thus, they represent potential customers for genomics companies. A list of companies and public facilities that provide DNA-sequencing services in different parts of the world can be found at http://www.nucleics.com/ DNA_sequencing_support/sequencing-service-reviews.html. It is quite complete, although it does not mention organizations like Illumina, Beckman Coulter, or the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. It is a very useful tool for scientists who need to choose a service company and includes, when available, prices, DNA-sequencing instruments used by each facility, specific DNA template and primer requirements, sample shipping and sequencing facility contact details, whether the DNA-sequencing facility is GLP/FDA certified, and the other DNA-sequencing-related services offered by the facility. There are more than 230 such facilities worldwide, including many universities in the USA and Canada. Many of them are compliant with good clinical practices (GCP), good laboratory practices (GLP), and good manufacturing practices (GMP) or, for clinical diagnostic services to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations.\n\nPharmaceutical companies also have needs for complex genomic data for R&D purposes-new molecules or vaccine developments, toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies-although there is a trend for outsourcing upstream research to public laboratories or biotechnology companies.\n\nAt the other extremity of data complexity, high-level public or private laboratories, such as those in hospitals, use technologies based on genomic information for diagnostic, forensic, or surveillance needs. Although currently very centralized due to the requirement for sophisticated equipments and relatively high skills, these techniques will probably reach more and more customers in a near future. Finally, pharmaceutical and agro-food companies also use low-complexity data for quality control purposes ensuring product biosafety.\n\nWhole-Genome Sequencing, Comparative-Genome Sequencing, and Targeted Resequencing\n\nThe first need of scientists is to sequence microbe genomes. The whole-genome sequence of 1987 viruses, 916 bacteria, and 67 archeal species were deposited to GenBank release 2.2.6 (Wooley et al., 2010) , and these numbers grow rapidly, the emphasis being on species that are pathogenic for animals or plants. Sequencing will identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, and deletions (indels) and large chromosomal rearrangements (structure or copy number changes).\n\nOnce a reference sequence as been established for a given species, the need is for resequencing (i.e., comparison of the sequence of new isolates to this reference sequence to identify differences) (Herring and Palsson, 2007) . This comparison concerns the whole genome or targets genes of interest where modifications are expected to have consequences on the phenotype. Scientists will use these data for fundamental research: to annotate all genes, understand genome organization, classify species, and study their evolution. The knowledge of genome organization, combined with functional genomics is the basis to understand pathobiological mechanisms of infectious agents. Among downstream applications are the development of new drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics including the establishment of resistance and escape profiles. Surveillance networks will also use genomic information to monitor pathogens evolution: resistance to treatment, crossing of host speciation barriers, increased transmissibility, and virulence.\n\nA new field of investigation is the study of microbiomes or metagenomics (Wooley et al., 2010) , which consists in the systematic sequencing of all nucleic acids in a given ecological \"niche\"-gut, upper respiratory tracts, and skin-to identify all microbes. This allows us to characterize the \"normal\" flora, for example at different ages in life, and interactions between this flora in pathogenic agents during infection, in particular the exchange of genetic material conferring resistance and virulence. Applications by pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and agro-food companies are very important. The study of microbiomes also have a potential application for forensics: sequencing the \"bacteriome\" in traces left on can be used to identify people as the flora present on the skin is a signature depending on food habits, environment, and diseases.\n\nTranscriptome analysis is the characterization of all coding and noncoding transcriptional activity in any organism without a priori assumptions through annotation of SNPs and mapping to reference genomes, characterization of transcript isoforms, regulatory RNAs, or splice junctions and determination of the relative abundance of transcripts (gene expression analysis). Analysis of differential gene expression is important in hosts and pathogens as well as in vectors of transmissible diseases (mostly insects). Human, plant, or animal cells can be studied when they are confronted to infection to identify the mechanisms targeted by the pathogen and those by which they resist infections. Pathogens' gene expression during infection of the cell is an important area of investigation as it may reveal pathobiological mechanisms and targets for new drugs. Epigenome analysis is the study of chromatin structure and gene regulation by CpG methylation, histone modifications, or DNA\u00c0protein interactions. Besides fundamental research, functional genomics can find applications in pharmaceutical companies for new anti-infection drugs and diagnostic companies to identify new biomarkers for diagnostic or disease or treatment monitoring.\n\nGenomics research generates tremendous amount of information. Among this are sequences that can be used to detect infection by a pathogen species by simple molecular techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), which, if quantitative, can also help monitor treatment efficacy against, for example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis viruses. A syndrome-based approach (i.e., the detection of multiple pathogens responsible for a disease, such as pneumonia, fever, neurological diseases, diarrhea) may also be useful. Signature sequences can identify infection by a variant with a specific phenotype with given virulence, host specificity, or resistance to treatment and help patient care or epidemiological surveillance. The latter signatures can be entire genes (acquired by horizontal transmission, either plasmid or recombination), individual SNPs, groups of SNPs carried by a unique or different genes, indels, or even modified expression of a gene. A comprehensive assay associating pathogen identification, pathogen typing, identification of virulence, or resistance markers may prove valuable in chronic infections like HIV, hepatitis virus infections, or tuberculosis.\n\nMicroarrays, Sanger sequencing, and NGS generate large quantities of data necessary for whole-genome resequencing, targeted resequencing, gene copy number variations, gene expression analysis, chromosome structural changes, or protein\u00c0DNA interactions. However, microarray analysis, by definition, requires a priori knowledge of sequences and only sequencing allows determination of unknown sequences. Only NGS allows rapid and low-cost whole-genome sequencing and metagenomics, as well as massive parallel processing of multiple specimens. Less complex technologies like pyrosequencing or low-to medium-density microarrays can be used for targeted sequencing or resequencing of one or a few genome regions which is of interest for patients management or for molecular epidemiology. Molecular diagnostics using PCR, TMA, NASBA, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) have many more applications for infectious diseases research, epidemiological surveillance and treatment. However, we will not address this domain of activity which exploits data issued from genomics research.\n\nAt least 36 companies providing microarrays have been identified in 2009 in the USA and Europe (North Shore LIJ Research Institute; http://www.nslij-genetics. org/microarray/). Most of them propose low-to medium-density custom arrays, which are glass plates or beads with DNA probes either spotted or synthesized in situ using a variety of technologies, including printing with fine-pointed pins onto glass slides, photolithography using premade masks, photolithography using dynamic micromirror devices, ink-jet printing, or electrochemistry on microelectrode arrays. For a recent review on the use of microarrays for clinical microbiology, see Miller and Tang (2009) . We will focus on companies providing high-density microarrays.\n\nThe Affymetrix GeneChip s technology, based on photolithography to synthesize probes in situ on the array, was invented in the late 1980s. More than 1500 publications can now be retrieved from the Affymetrix database with the key words \"virus,\" \"bacteria,\" \"parasite,\" and \"fungi.\" The current company platform GCS 3000Dx v.2 is 510(k) cleared and CE marked for in vitro diagnostic use and consists of a scanner, a fluidics station, and the Affymetrix Molecular Diagnostics Software (AMDS) for data interpretation. The Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array analyzes over 47,000 transcripts from human genome and allows gene expression profiling of cells infected by various pathogens. Several commercial arrays address human pathogens. The E. coli array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. It includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, over 700 intergenic regions as well as probe sets for various antibiotic resistance markers. The Staphylococcus aureus Genome Array allows the analysis of the expression of sequences in four strains of S. aureus. It contains probe sets to over 3300 S. aureus ORFs and to study both forward and reverse orientation of over 4800 intergenic regions. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa Genome Array represents the annotated genome of P. aeruginosa strain PA01 and includes 5549 protein-coding sequences, 18 tRNA genes, a representative of the ribosomal RNA cluster, and 117 genes present in strains other than PA01. In addition, 199 probe sets corresponding to all intergenic regions exceeding 600 base pairs have been included. The Plasmodium/Anopheles Genome Array includes probe sets to over 4300 Plasmodium falciparum transcripts and approximately 14,900 Anopheles gambiae transcripts.\n\nThe SARS Resequencing Array provides a standard assay for complete sequence analysis of the SARS coronavirus.\n\nBioM\u00e9rieux (Marcy-l'Etoile, France) has developed several resequencing microarrays covering pathogens genomes. A Mycobacterium tuberculosis array is based on two sequence databases: one for the species identification of mycobacteria (82 unique 16S rRNA sequences corresponding to 54 phenotypical species) and the other for detecting M. tuberculosis rifampin resistance in rpoB (Troesch et al., 1999; Sougakoff et al., 2004 ). An S. aureus array tiles 16S rDNA sequences to identify staphylococcus species (Couzinet, 2005a) , grlA, gyrA, grlB, and gyrB genes for the presence of mutations involved in fluoroquinolone resistance (Couzinet, 2005b) , and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of S. aureus strains (van Leeuwen et al., 2003) . An HIV microarray was designed to detect 204 antiretroviral resistance mutations simultaneously in Gag cleavage sites, protease, reverse transcriptase, integrase, and gp41 of HIV1 (Gonzalez et al., 2004) . Similarly, a hepatitis B virus (HBV) microarray was designed to detect 245 mutations, 20 deletions, and 2 insertions at 151 positions and to determine the genotype of the HBV (Tran et al., 2006; Pas et al., 2008) .\n\nRoche NimbleGen (Madison, WI, USA) manufactures custom, high-density DNA arrays based on its proprietary Maskless Array Synthesizer (MAS) technology using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) combined with DNA synthesis chemistry allowing 385,000 to 2.1 million unique probe features in a single array. Arrays are synthesized on standard-sized glass microscope slides and are compatible with a range of hybridization, washing, and scanning instrumentation. With the new generation of HD2 arrays, oligos between 50 and 75 bases in length can be synthesized, increasing sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.\n\nRecently, Roche NimbleGen introduced Sequence Capture arrays to produce targeted, sequencing-ready samples for use with NGS instruments. High density NimbleGen arrays with long oligonucleotides are used to hybridize either the whole human exome or human genomic regions of interest are hybridized. The purified human sequences are then eluted, amplified and sequenced. Although currently restricted to human the genome, and more recently, to wheat and rapeseed, this technology may prove valuable for infectious diseases genomics. Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Febit (Heidelberg, Germany) also market capture microarrays.\n\nNGS is parallel sequencing of clonally amplified or single DNA molecules by iterative cycles of polymerase-based extension or oligonucleotide ligation that takes place in flow cells. These technologies have revolutionized all aspects of genomics: whole-genome sequencing, targeted resequencing, metagenomics, gene expression profiling, epigenomics, and DNA\u00c0protein interactions study (ChIP-Seq). For a recent review on NGS, see Holt and Jones (2008) and Voelkerding et al. (2009) 454 Life Sciences platform, the Genome Sequencer FLX system, is using the 454's sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) technology for de novo sequencing, resequencing of whole genomes, and target DNA regions, metagenomics, and RNA analysis. The chemistry used for sequencing is described in Figure 19 .1A. Automation using a magnetic beads technology simplifies emulsion-PCR and allows library preparation of genomics samples in hours in a single tube, eliminating cloning, and colony picking. The recognized advantage of the FLX system compared to other NGS platforms is that it generates the longest single reads (400 bp) and long paired end reads of 20 kb, 8 kb, or 3 kb. In May 2010, the company introduced the GS Junior System which provides an integrated sequencing and bioinformatics solution, all in the size of a typical desktop laser printer. The company announces improvements of its sequencing chemistry to \n\nNext Next Base Base Original DNA samples are first fragmented, the DNA double-helix is melted into single strands and a polyA tail is added to these DNA molecules. Billions of these single DNA molecules are captured on a proprietary surface within a flow cell and serve as templates for the SBS process. Genomic DNA is fragmented, polyA tail are added, and DNA molecules captured by oligo dT primers inside the flow cell. The tSMS process is a cyclical process involving multiple rounds of (1) synthesis using labeled nucleotides, (2) washing, (3) imaging, and (4) cleaving the fluorescent label until the desired read length is achieved.

There have been 748 published studies using the 454 technology, among which 219 concern infectious diseases. The technology has found applications in metagenomics, such as identification of a new arenavirus in transplantation patients (Palacios et al., 2008) or the characterization of microflora in oral cavity or guts (Keijser et al., 2008; Turnbaugh et al., 2009) .\n\nIllumina was created in 1998 to exploit rights on the BeadArray technology developed at Tufts University. The HiSeq TM 2000 platform is based on the SBS chemistry, which generates reads of 100 bp and paired end reads allowing the assembly of long scaffolds (Figure 19 .1B). After library preparation, cluster generation is done on the cBot automated cluster generation system, which significantly reduces hands-on time compared to emulsion-PCR. Sequencing a genome can be done on one flow cell while, simultaneously, the other flow cell can analyze its epigenome and transcriptome. More than 500 publications illustrate the versatility of Illumina NGS technology. Recent publications on infectious diseases include Trichinella spiralis (Webb and Rosenthal, 2010) , P. falciparum (Jiang et al., 2010) , virus discovery in Drosophila cells and adult mosquitoes (Wu et al., 2010) , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) molecular epidemiology (Harris et al., 2010) , Burkholderia cenocepacia therapeutic targets (Yoder-Himes et al., 2010) , and Pasteurella multocida virulence factors (Steen et al., 2010) . The Illumina platform is the most versatile of the three NGS platforms requiring clonal amplification because it associates gigabases outputs and read lengths of 100 bp.\n\nLife Technologies was created by the combination of Invitrogen Corporation and Applied Biosystems Inc. in 2008. Applied Biosystems commercializes a NGS platform called SOLiD 4. The chemistry used in this platform is described in Figure 19 .1C. It is based on emulsion-PCR and oligonucleotides ligation. The SOLiD 4 platform has two flow cells allowing two independent experiments at the same time and can multiplex up to 96 samples. Applied biosystems proposes automated solutions for reproducible templated bead preparation with less than 1 h of hands-on time (EZ Bead\u2122 System). The SOLiD platform generates the shortest read lengths among the three platforms, which makes it less versatile for the various applications. However, future evolutions of the SOLiD platforms, SOLiD 4hq, and SOLiD PI will generate longer reads (75 bp).\n\nHelicos Biosciences Corporation (Cambridge, MA, USA) is commercializing the first platform that allows sequencing from single DNA molecules, thereby avoiding biases due to amplification. As the three companies described earlier, Helicos is a recipient of the \"$1000 Genome\" grant. The chemistry used on the Helicos Genetic Analysis System is based on tSMS technology (Figure 19 .1D) in which single-stranded DNA molecules generated from a library and tagged with a polyA tail are attached to a proprietary surface at a density of up to 100 3 10 6 molecules per square centimeter and sequenced by synthesis. This system is now installed in several research centers in the USA and Europe. The Helicos platform was used for the first single-molecule whole-genome sequencing in 2009 (Pushkarev et al., 2009 ). This study achieved 283 average coverage of the human genome and detected over 2.8 million SNPs, of which over 370,000 were novel. Validation with a genotyping array demonstrated 99.8% concordance. The unbiased nature of the single-molecule sequencing approach also allowed the detection of 752 copy number variations in this genome.\n\nThe NGS technologies generate a much higher amount of data than the wellestablished ABI Sanger platform. The analysis of gigabases or terabases requires complex software solutions. A list of software used with NGS platforms can be found in Voelkerding et al. (2009) . However, performances claimed by manufacturers may be overestimated. Harismendy et al. (2009) have compared the platforms of 454 Life Sciences, Illumina, and Applied Biosystems on a 260 kb human genome sample. Although the Illumina and Applied Biosystems produce the largest amounts of data, only 43% and 34% of them, respectively, are usable after quality filtration. In contrast, 95% of the data generated by the 454 platform are usable. All three technologies have biases that induce heterogeneous coverage of bases along the sequence: the 454 platform shows the lowest variability among unique and repetitive sequences, whereas the ABI and Illumina platforms tend to be affected by high Adenine/ Thymine contents. NGS platforms tend to better detect indels than ABI Sanger platform as they sequence single strands. As expected, ABI Sanger sequencing has an error rate of approximately 7% and careful comparison with NGS reveals false positive and false negative rates of 0.9% and 3.1%. The overall sequencing accuracy of NGS platforms was very high (.99.99%), but the ability to detect variant was 95% for the 454 platform (which has the lowest sensitivity), 100% for the Illumina platform, and 96% for the ABI platform, the last two technologies being less specific. Overall, NGS platforms need to improve their uniformity of per-base sequence coverage as accuracy is lower in poorly covered regions.\n\nNew technologies based on nanopores are currently being explored to develop platforms for single-DNA molecule sequencing (Branton et al., 2008) . A nanoporebased device provides single-molecule detection and analytical capabilities that are achieved by electrophoretically driving molecules in solution through a nano-scale pore. The nanopore provides a highly confined space within which single nucleic acid polymers can be analyzed at high throughput by one of a variety of means, and the perfect processivity that can be enforced in a narrow pore ensures that the native order of the nucleobases in a polynucleotide is reflected in the sequence of signals that is detected. Kilobase length polymers (single-stranded genomic DNA or RNA) or small molecules (e.g., nucleosides) can be identified and characterized without amplification or labeling, a unique analytical capability that makes inexpensive, rapid DNA sequencing a possibility. Further research and development to overcome current challenges to nanopore identification of each successive nucleotide in a DNA strand offers the prospect of third-generation instruments that will sequence a diploid mammalian genome for approximately $1000 in approximately 24 h. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (http://www.nanoporetech.com; Oxford, UK), our first generation of DNA-sequencing technology, uses a protein nanopore combined with a processive enzyme, multiplexed on a silicon chip. This elegant and scalable system has unique potential to transform the speed and cost of DNA sequencing. Future generations may interrogate single strands of DNA and may use \"solid-state\" nanopores for further improvements in speed and cost. Lingvitae (http://www.lingvitae.com; Oslo, Sweden) and Eid et al. (2009) from Pacific Biosciences (Menlo Park, CA, USA) have designed a prototype instrument able to sequence a single DNA molecule using DNA polymerase based on the observation of the temporal incorporation of labeled nucleotides, which takes place in a nanophotonic structure. This can drastically reduce the volume of observation. Currently, this prototype is able to multiplex 3000 such structures, allowing sequencing of small viral or bacterial genomes with high accuracy.\n\nMicroarrays and NGS have revolutionized genomics because they drastically increased scientists' access to tremendous amounts of information on genomes and gene expression and decreased time-to-result, hands-on time, and costs. Research needs for these technologies are well understood but still represent small (although rapidly growing) markets. The total market of NGS was evaluated to be $484 million in 2008 (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reportinfo.asp?report_id5614823) and the market of functional genomics was about $2.2 billion in 2007 with an annual growth rate of 18% (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reportinfo.asp? report_id55545). The real development of sales of companies proposing technologies for genomics will mostly come from diagnostic applications in human or animal health. Genomics research can be translated into molecular diagnostics in the fields of human genetic, oncology, and infectious diseases. Several in vitro diagnostic companies propose instruments and reagents to detect sequence signatures for diagnosis or treatment monitoring applications. However, the current clinical needs mostly require low-complexity genetic information that can be covered by multiplex realtime amplification, reverse hybridization-based line probe assay, low-density microarrays or simple sequencing platforms like the PyroMark Q24 platform. The place of technologies generating more complex datasets in clinical applications is still to be defined. Developing such applications will require clinical validation of the value of complex sequence information and strong efforts for clinician education on its benefit. It will also require that costs of instruments and reagents further decrease and that the technologies become easier to use and more robust. All the major companies cited in this chapter make efforts to simplify equipments and reduce costs per analysis. Affymetrix recently launched a new, more affordable and smaller platform, GeneAtlas, along with a microarray strip format, which enables users to process up to two strips per day or eight strips per week. 454 Life Sciences announced the release of the GS Junior System scaled to suit the needs of individual laboratories for rapid sequencing of amplicons, targeted human resequencing studies, de novo sequencing of microbial and other small genomes, and for pathogen detection. Illumina recently launched the Genome Analyzer IIe with a lower cost, making the technology more accessible to laboratories of various sizes. Similarly, Applied Biosystems announces a less expensive, low-throughput benchtop platform (50 Gb per run) will allow shorter times-to-results. Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) is marketing a relatively simple, low footprint platform (PyroMark Q24) for real-time, sequence-based detection and quantification of sequence variants and epigenetic methylation that uses pyrosequencing technology. The instrument can process 1\u00c024 samples in 15 min. This platform, which is affordable to mid-sized laboratories, allows analysis of CpG methylation, SNPs, insertion/deletions, short tandem repeats (STRs), and variable gene copy number."}
