{"title": "Retrospective Analysis of Clinical Features in 101 Death Cases with COVID-19", "body": "By Feb 16, 2020, 101 cases died of COVID-19 in ICU of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, among them 57 (56.44%) patients were confirmed by RT-PCR, and 44 (43.6%) were consistent with clinical diagnostic criteria. In the death cases, 47 went directly to the ICU because of critical condition, and 54 were transferred to ICU with aggravated condition. All cases died in the end. Among them, 1 patient died of acute coronary syndrome, while the rest died of respiratory failure and multiple organ failure caused by COVID-19. The cases included 64 males and 37 females, with the age range of 24-83 and average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). The majority had underlying diseases with hypertension(42.57%), diabetes (22.77%), neurological disease (9.90%), malignant tumor (4.95%), and respiratory disease( 4.95%). The cases with more than two underlying diseases reached 25.74%. In detail, 10 patients had contact history in South China Seafood Market, and 10 patients had close contact history with infections. The blood type distribution was significantly different, with type A (44.44%), type B (29.29%), type AB (8.08%) and type O (18.19% ). The median time from onset to hospital was 11.00 days ( IQR8.00- 13.50 ) . The median time from onset to death was 21.00 days ( IQR17.00-27.5)( Table 1) .\n\nThe relative frequencies of all reported symptoms at the time of admission are All rights reserved.

The disease initially showed scattered plaque-like ground glass in the lungs. Dynamic imaging showed progressive multi-spot patchy shadows in both lungs. Pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema occurred in 3 (2.97%) patients.\n\nBlood routine, biochemical reports and inflammation of cases during admission to ICU and 48h before deaths were collected.

It was found that the count of patient's platelets(PLT) decreased, D-dimer and Prothrombin time(PT) increased correspondingly during disease progression by dynamic analysis of coagulation-related indicators. Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most patients at admission(83 [82.18%] of 101 patients). With the progress of the disease, myocardial damage indicators were significantly increased. It also indicated that there was a high proportion of myocardial damage in the early stage. We also found that liver and kidney damages were not significant at the time of admission and when transferred to ICU, and it significantly turned to be worse 48h before deaths. Experiment data can be seen in Table 3-5 and   Figure1 .\n\nNinety seven patients were transferred to the hospital based on laboratory diagnosis or deterioration after treatments in other hospitals.

The median time from ARDS to invasive mechanical ventilation was 3.00 days(IQR0.00-6.00), of which 21 patients were intubated 2 days before deaths.\n\nThe duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 1-31 days (median 5 days [IQR2.00-8.00]). Seven patients were treated with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation(ECMO) and eight with Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy(CRRT).\n\nThe present analyses revealed the clinical characteristics of 101 deaths caused by COVID-19 in China. Based on our knowledge, this is the largest sample among the reports on the clinical characteristics of dead patients although some studies described a limited number of deaths.\n\nUp to 5 th March, 2020, the cumulative number of infected victims was 95,333, and the number of deaths reached 3,282 in many countries of the world. The mortality was up to 3.4%, which is significantly high compared with that of common pneumonia. Among the 101 deaths, males dominated and the proportion of elderly patients with underlying diseases was relatively high. Importantly, we found that the blood group distribution of the deaths (A-42.57%, B-30.69%, O-17.82%, AB-8.91%) remarkably differred from that of Han population in Wuhan [12] . Type O was relatively low but Type A was relatively high.\n\nABO blood group antigen substances are widely distributed in the human respiratory , digestive tract , and reproductive systems [13] .

In the study of various susceptible genes in SARS-CoV, individuals in the blood group O had a lower infection rate [16] . Guillon et al. found that type A antibody can provide protection by inhibiting interaction between the virus and ACE2 receptor [17] . However, the higher proportion of patients with type A blood remains unclear although the lack of antibody A protection might be involved. Further research is needed to explore the mechanism by which the patients of type A is more susceptibe to COVID-19 infection.\n\nThe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are non-specific, which is consistent with previous studies [10] , the most common symptom is fever. However, not all patients had fever, for instance, no fever was noted in 10(9.90%) patients on the onset of disease.\n\nMoreover, 21(20.79%) of the patients had no respiratory symptoms in the begining of the disease, and fever and chest tightness gradually occurred with the disease progressed.\n\nTherefore, the delay of fever and respiratory symptoms may affect the early identification of COVID-19 .\n\nThe mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients is high, but its mechanism is not clear at present, and it may be related to the virus-induced acute lung injury, inflammatory factor storm, multiple organ damage and secondary nosocomial infections.\n\nWe collected laboratory examination results of patients at admission, at the time of transfer to the ICU, and at 48h before deaths, and found that 71(70.30%) of patients had an elevated level of IL-6 when they were admitted to the hospital, and it gradually increased with the disease progressed and was up to 26.21pg/mL(IQR11.68-205.92) 48h\n\nAll rights reserved.

Thirty one percent of ICU patients were found to have significant abnormalities in Troponin I(TNI) [8] . We noted that TNI was significantly elevated in the ICU patients or before deaths compared with primary admission to hospital. Further analysis revealed that patients who were hospitalized with elevated troponin underwent a fast progress from onset to ICU and to death. The results suggest that heart is a potential targeted organ by 2019-nCOV in the disease process. Thus monitoring and prediction of heart injury would be needed at early stage as well as in the course of disease.\n\nAdditionally, we found that with the disease progressed, counts of leukocytes, author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033068 doi: medRxiv preprint\n\nAll rights reserved.
