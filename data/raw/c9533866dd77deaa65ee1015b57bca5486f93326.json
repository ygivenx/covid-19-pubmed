{"title": "The impact of traffic isolation in Wuhan on the spread of 2019-nCov", "body": "In Figure 1d , we also observed that the reported cases are relatively small, although Wuhan CBMI in Henan Province is large (5.6%, Figure 1b) . We speculate that Henan Province's earlier intervention measures (such as traffic control and designated hospitals) effectively reduced the proliferation of 2019-nCov 4 .\n\nIn addition, the total number of reported cases in Zhejiang Province was higher than expected ( Figure 1d ). In Zhejiang Province, Wenzhou was the city most frequently traded with Wuhan, had the highest number of reported cases. From January 19th to January 23rd, 2020, Wenzhou's Wuhan CBMI (0.11) ranked first in Zhejiang Province. We speculated that some patients returned to Wenzhou before (Figure 1g ). We found that the mortality rate in Hubei Province (3.24%; Wuhan: 5.45%) was much higher than that in other regions of mainland China (0.19%). We have also found that the investigation of potential cases in Wuhan was far behind other provinces in Mainland China (Figure 1h ). We speculated that this might be related to a large number of patients, limited medical resources, and the lack of manpower to track suspected cases. .
