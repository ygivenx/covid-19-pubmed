According to your inclusion criteria, child can participate in this trial. However, there is no mention about consent for child participant. 8. line 212: Does the wording \"confirm patient eligibility\" means that screening test? You should confirm eligibility of patient \"after\" obtaining consent. 9. line 214: This is a duplicate of the previous sentence at line 187. -Please shorten the abstract -it should be around 400 words. Response: Thank you very much for your kind comments, we have shortened the abstract in our manuscript.\n\n-We have implemented an additional requirement to all articles to include 'Patient and Public Involvement' statement within the main text of your main document. Authors must include a statement in the methods section of the manuscript under the sub-heading 'Patient and Public Involvement'. This should provide a brief response to the following questions: How was the development of the research question and outcome measures informed by patients' priorities, experience, and preferences? How did you involve patients in the design of this study? Were patients involved in the recruitment to and conduct of the study? How will the results be disseminated to study participants? For randomised controlled trials, was the burden of the intervention assessed by patients themselves?\n\nResponse: Thank you very much for your kind comments, we have added the \"Patient and Public Involvement'' in the methods section and provide a response to the questions. As followed: Patient and Public Involvement The relevance and necessity of the research question, study design and development of patient facing documents including the consent forms, participant information sheets, symptom diary, all follow-up forms and promotional materials have been reviewed by members of the public. The public involvement group included a mixture of research experienced and inexperienced people. We will try to work with patient advocacy groups to ensure that plain language summaries of study findings are shared to both participating service users and wider patient groups. And through the communication of participants and researchers, the burden of the intervention will be assessed in a comprehensive and rational way. Trial participants will not be informed of the trial results directly. However, the final results will be published. But each patient will be informed of their own influenza virus test results during follow-up. There had been no direct patient involvement in the design of this study.\n\nPatient advisers should also be thanked in the contributorship statement/acknowledgements. Response: Thank you very much for your kind comments, we have added the thank to Patient advisers in the acknowledgements.\n\nIf patients and or public were not involved please state this. Response: Thank you very much for your kind comments, we have added the statement in the section of \"Patient and Public Involvement''.\n\n[ [Methods and Analysis_Subject screening and selection] 4. line 186: In the aspect of blinding, the roles of statisticians and personnel who participate in the study was not described clearly in the manuscript. Please add \"blinding\" section and describe in detail.\n\nResponse: Thank you very much for your kind comments. We have added the Blinding section as followed: Blinding\n\nThe randomisation system will be implemented and managed by the Chinese Evidenced-based Medicine Center. The randomisation codes will be maintained by a specifically appointed independent custodian. Researchers, participants, inspectors, and data entrants will all be blinded. The drugs were randomly coded according to the randomization protocol, and the code number will be the unique identification code for the participants. According to the order of the patients visits, they will be randomly divided into different groups. The test drugs, the control drugs and the placebo are in the same dosage form and the same dose, so the double-blind method can be used. Preparation of the drug requires uniform packaging for each group and uses the same drug label. Data lock will be performed after CRF data review, duplicate data entry verification, outlier data collection and processing, issue of question form, and researcher's Q&A. After the completion of the blind review meeting (Pioneer Investigator(PI), biostatistics experts, sponsors are required to be present on all three parties) and make a blind review resolution, after the signature of the three parties, an unblinding can be carried out. After the statistics of the unblinded data are completed, the biostatistics experts will issue statistical reports, and the PI will compile a summary report based on the statistical reports.\n\n[Methods and Analysis_Inclusion, exclusion and rejection criteria and termination standards] 5. line 191: What is the reason why you set the range of age as 14-65? Is there a special reason for setting the lower limit as 14?\n\nResponse: Thank you very much for your kind comments. We consider to set the range of age as 14-65 which is based on following aspects: 1. Both Chou-ling-Dan granules and Oseltamivir could be applied to all age groups including 14-65. It is indicated in the Chou-ling-dan granules instructions that it can be used for children younger than 14. The Chou-ling-dan granules have been approved as OTC drugs for many years in the use of children under the guidance of doctors, and no serious adverse reactions were reported. And many of clinical trials of Chou-ling-dan on children and oseltamivir treatment for influenza in children had been reported1,2. 2. Besides, issue of patient compliance should be considered since the subjects of this study are outpatients. Their age should not be too young or too old, otherwise it would be hard to follow up and drop out easily. Moreover, children over the age of 14 are basically enrolled in secondary schools and can communicate well with doctors.\n\n3. Ideally, we hope to conduct this study among all age groups. However, the public acceptance of this study were contrary to the implementation of this project, which narrowed down the age range to 14-65 12. line 218-220: It's better to combine the two sentences. ex) A materials consent will be obtained to specifically address the collection of biological samples for future use such as serum and plasma specimens. Response: Thank you very much for your kind comments. We have adopted your suggestion and combined the sentences as\uff1a\"A materials consent will be obtained to specifically address the collection of biological samples for future use such as serum and plasma specimens.\"\n\n[Methods and Analysis_Randomisation] 13. line 224-226: Central allocation is well described. But, how will the random number be generated? Will the number be computer-generated in the Chinese Evidenced-based Medicine Center? Response: Thank you very much for your kind comments. We have added the description about randomization as followed:\n\nFollowing informed consent, patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to the three groups [oseltamivir treatment (positive control), CLD treatment (test) and placebo group]. The randomisation allocation number will be provided by the Chinese Evidenced-based Medicine Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China. Randomisation will be stratified by the trial center in different region. Randomisation is performed using STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SYSTEM to generate random numbers and corresponding drug and case allocation schemes (enclosed by opaque envelopes) The trial doctor will distribute drugs in the order that was originally arranged.\n\n[ Detailed information on drug use will be registered in the CRF. All of the rescue medicine will provided by Pan-long-yun-hai Pharmaceutical Company and the doctor issues the drug according to the patient's needs. In the event of symptoms that the patients cannot tolerate, such as severe headache or myalgia, the attending doctor will treat the patient according to the actual situation and decide whether to terminate the experiment. The cost will be provided by the research team.\n\n16. line 252: What is the treatment for headache or myalgia? It is not listed at line 252-254. Response: Thank you very much for your kind comments. In the event of symptoms that the patients cannot tolerate, such as severe headache or myalgia, the attending doctor will treat the patient according to the actual situation and decide whether to terminate the experiment. The cost will be provided by the research team. If the headache or myalgia is not serious and the patients don't ask for additional treatment, the patient will not receive additional treatment.\n\n[Methods and Analysis_Evaluation_Secondary outcomes] 17. line 310: I think the character \"D\" should be modified to \"iv\".\n\n2. What is the purpose of syndrome differentiation in this study? Response: According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, CLD may has a better effect on the wind-heat type cold. However, considering the syndrome differentiation of traditional Chinese medicine is mostly based on empirical medicine and lacks of modern evidence-based evidence, in this study, we not only want to evaluate the safety and effect of CLD in influenza treatment, but also hope to know a Chinese herbal medicine in a Chinese medicine way through the method of syndrome differentiation.\n\nIn this study, we are expanding the exploration about the evidence-based study of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment. It is hoped that the traditional Chinese medicine theory and evidencebased medicine would be combined in a reasonable way and the evaluation of Chinese herbal medicine would be more comprehensively.\n\n3. In the selection criteria, no syndrome differentiation is included. What kind syndrome Chou-ling-dan is suitable? Response: This study is mainly based on the evidence-based medicine, so each indicator used in the criteria can be quantified in modern medicine. The data of syndrome differentiation is used to explore the feasibility of quantifying TCM symptoms. According to TCM theory and long clinical observation, it was believed that CLD was more suitable for wind-heat type cold or influenza, but the result was lack of evidence. So we also hope to find out whether there are differences in the treatment of different syndrome type influenza besides evaluating the safety and efficacy."}
