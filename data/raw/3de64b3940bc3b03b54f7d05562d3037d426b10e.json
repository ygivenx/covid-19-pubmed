{"title": "", "body": "The opening of the twenty-fi rst century was marked by a wave of terrorist attacks, outbreaks of disease and devastating natural phenomena. Many of these incidents had local, regional and global repercussions and prompted tourism crises at corporate, industry and destination levels. Although some events were unprecedented, crisis and disaster have acquired greater prominence in recent years and the modern world appears to be one of heightened uncertainty and insecurity. Tourism cannot isolate itself from these forces and developments in the external environment have the capacity to precipitate tourism crises, as do industry and organizational circumstances. Some notable examples of tourism crises in the last decade are listed in Table 1 .1, and this pattern seems set to continue in the years ahead.\n\nA growing awareness of the threat of tourism crises and their potential to infl ict harm is refl ected in the number of academic publications devoted to the topic, including special editions of journals, many of which are referred to in the course of this book. More manuals and handbooks for practitioners are available and industry associations, offi cial agencies and government bodies have been involved in their production. It is also an increasingly popular conference theme for both business and academic communities, with a strong emphasis on understanding crises and being prepared to meet them. These themes are central to this book, which deals with causes of crises, their dynamics, consequences and approaches to management.\n\nThis fi rst chapter provides an introduction to tourism crises and tourism crisis management. It discusses the features of such crises, their origins and evolution and recommended responses within the context of the wider literature on crisis management. Distinguishing characteristics of the tourism industry, comprising public and private actors, are outlined and shown to heighten its vulnerability to crisis, which assumes a variety of forms and is provoked by assorted catalysts. The overview stresses the signifi cance of planning and management and sets the scene for the remainder of the book, which explores a multiplicity of tourism crises and the manner of their resolution.\n\nIndividual chapters cover tourism crises related to economic, political, sociocultural, environmental and technological issues with additional separate chapters dedicated to questions of terrorism, health and commercial crises. The fi nal chapter reviews the principal themes which emerge from the accounts and examines the lessons to be learned, highlighting examples of best practice and considering the challenges of implementation in an era of rapid change when the future is unknown and unpredictable. It is hoped that the book will afford new insights into the important topic of managing tourism crises, which cannot be ignored by anyone with an interest in tourism.\n\nThere is no universally accepted defi nition of what constitutes a crisis and different writers present their own interpretations. These do, however, frequently correspond and it appears that \"three elements must be present: a triggering event causing signifi cant change or having the potential to cause signifi cant change; the perceived inability to cope with this change; and a threat to the existence of the foundation of the organization\" (Keown-McMullan, 1997, p. 4) . A distinction can be drawn between disasters which owe their origins to factors such as extreme weather, yet impinge on industrial activity, and crises which are products of institutional stresses (Faulkner, 2001) . The latter are more amenable to control, but the two have qualities in common and are connected when catastrophes outside an organization provoke a crisis within it. Emergency is another term sometimes employed interchangeably with crisis, but it refers to a less serious and therefore more easily managed event or threat. An associated concept is that of risk pertaining to latent, rather than actual, individual or sets of conditions which can become crises if realized and of suffi cient gravity. Risk assessment is a key stage in planning for crisis, involving the anticipation of what might go wrong and identifi cation of the reasons for divergences from expectations (van Waldbeek, 2005) .\n\nEvery crisis is unique, yet characteristics generally cited include unexpectedness, urgency and danger (Hermann, 1972) . They are precipitated by catalysts powerful enough to undermine structures and modes of operation, with repercussions for the profi tability of commercial ventures which might even be destroyed (Shrivastava and Mitroff, 1987) . Lives and company and individual reputations may be put in jeopardy, thereby eroding staff morale. Participants are taken by surprise and have little time to make diffi cult decisions in an atmosphere of tension and instability. Crises also reach a crucial point when change, for the better or worse, is unavoidable and the experience may prove benefi cial for people and organizations .\n\nTourism crises usually share these attributes, although certain crisis situations can be predicted and lack immediacy such as those facing destinations suffering from rising sea levels due to global warming. They are also not restricted to the corporate arena and the phrase can be extended to describe circumstances in which tourists and members of the tourism industry individually or collectively, including destinations, are faced with change, which is potentially destructive for every, or certain, parties (a concept defi nition which is repeated at the end of the chapter). Generalizations may, however, be misleading and tourism crises display a remarkable range and variety, which it is the intention of this book to convey.\n\nExisting typologies of corporate crises as a whole are founded on root causes (Shrivastava and Mitroff, 1987) , time (Booth, 1993) , gravity (Brecher, 1978) and facets of business operation (Meyers, 1986) . Specifi c tourism crises can be classed in these ways and domain of origin or cause is a relatively straightforward method which permits comprehensive analysis. It represents the rationale for this book's organization and a conceptual framework is presented in Figure 1 .1.\n\nCauses of many tourism crises can be traced to developments in the economic, political, socio-cultural and environmental domains, which affect demand and supply in generating and destination countries. Economic downturn and recession, fl uctuating exchange rates, loss of market confi dence and withdrawal of investment funds can all engender a tourism crisis. Political events such as war, military coups, deteriorating international relations, the imposition of sanctions and terrorism will have a similar outcome. Civil unrest and growing crime and violence may act as triggers and natural disasters of earthquakes, typhoons, volcanic eruptions and fl ooding will almost inevitably do so. Deterioration in public hygiene and infectious disease also lead to tourism crises. Crises generated within the industry too can be analyzed under the headings of economic, socio-cultural and environmental when tourism has adverse impacts in these fi elds.\n\nTechnological is a fi fth domain in which crises are initiated when technology in an assortment of manifestations fails to perform as expected and crises of competition and industrial relations are born of corporate affairs, the sixth domain. Human error is often a compounding factor, or even a principal cause, in these and all forms of tourism crises. Table 1 .2 contains a list of threats of crisis by domain and whether they are external or internal to the tourism industry. There may be overlap across the domains and the demarcation between internal and external worlds is also not always clearly discernible. A crisis beyond the industry could be a rigorous test of management competence and the fi nancial health of an organization, with corporate and industrial commercial crises ensuing if these are found to be defi cient. The cause and source of a crisis will help to decide its consequences and severity can be assessed on a scale from major to minor, measured by items such as number of people implicated and costs incurred. Duration is a dimension of magnitude which embraces a short to long-term continuum, from a temporary computer systems collapse to a slowly mutating crisis linked to environmental degradation. Some crises have been likened to cobras when they erupt without warning and pythons if they reveal themselves more stealthily (Seymour and Moore, 2000) . Spatial and industrial scope is another facet to take into account. The zone of crisis may be local, national, regional and international with regard to geographical area and corporate, industrial (domestic and overseas) and government (local, national and international) with regard to decision makers.\n\nAn isolated case of food poisoning at a restaurant principally concerns the manager and staff and, if managed well, will be quickly forgotten with limited fi nancial damage. In comparison, the tourism industry and governments worldwide must respond to a pandemic of a deadly disease which could resonate for many months and have serious balance of payments implications. This range in crisis scope and, by implication, gravity is depicted in Figure 1 .2.\n\nCrises are thus rooted in a multiplicity of intrinsic and extrinsic causes originating in various domains. They occupy a spectrum, from short-lived situations confi ned to single enterprises to those which involve the global industry over a prolonged period, and the manner in which crises are handled can determine their extent and life. Such observations suggest a propensity to crisis in the tourism industry which is partly derived from its distinctive features, which are summarized below.\n\nFirst, the tourism industry's relative immaturity and dramatic expansion are noteworthy. Tourism has a long history, but modern mass tourism and the industry which supports it date from after the Second World War. International arrivals rose from 25 million in 1950 to 760 million by 2004, although geographical imbalances persist and most tourists and their spending circulate within the developed world (WTO, 2005) . The World Tourism Organization (WTO) predicts that there will be 1.6 billion international tourists in 2020 (WTO, 1999) and domestic tourism, estimated to be 10 times greater in volume (Weaver and Lawton, 2002) , must not be overlooked. Growth has been fueled by new product development, aggressive marketing and intense competition.\n\nLooking to the future, the WTO is not alone in its optimistic forecasts and analysts concur that tourists demonstrate considerable resilience in the face of setbacks. Any downturns ahead for whatever reason, including crises, could therefore be quickly overcome. However, there is also an appreciation that tourists can be fi ckle in their decision making and behavior. Leisure tourism demand is renowned for its elasticity, seasonality and volatility whereby a change in price will produce a disproportionate change in demand, movement is often heavily concentrated in certain months and fl ows can fl uctuate wildly (Bull, 1998) . It is driven by economics, subject to fashion trends and deterred by social and political upheaval. Tourists are unlikely to cease traveling in reaction to negative forces, but could shift their direction of travel and choice of destination. Business tourism is more stable, as perhaps is tourism for purposes of education and health care, but most markets are sensitive to uncertainties.\n\nThe tourism industry, which has grown to meet the needs of all these travelers, is unusual because of its size and structure, with a number of components playing a part. It consists of all the commercial and non-commercial enterprises and agencies which make tourism possible, encourage it and deal with the consequences. Collectively, they form a network made up of inputs from a series of individual industries, rather than a discrete and homogenous industry, and some of the participants may have customers who are not tourists such as excursionists and local residents.\n\nCore industry sectors are tourism administration and development, passenger transportation, hospitality, attractions, tour operation and retail travel. The tourism administration segment determines the environment within which the overall industry works while transport, hospitality and attractions sell the services essential to the tourist experience. These may reach tourists directly or indirectly through intermediaries of tour operators, who combine separate ingredients into single products, and travel agents, who are the retailers in the distribution chain. An additional miscellaneous category includes providers of travel insurance, currency exchange and travelers' checks and travel literature.\n\nConventional structures and ways of doing business are, however, changing. Intermediaries are being challenged by new channels of distribution and especially Internet technology, which facilitates direct communications and transactions between customers and suppliers. This has resulted in the threat of disintermediation, raising questions about the prospects of \"bricks and mortar\" travel agents in particular. Vertically integrated giant travel groups are another power reshaping industry systems, especially in Europe where companies like TUI have their own hotels, airlines, travel agents and tour operators. Nevertheless, the various functional elements still depend on one or more of the others to a greater or lesser degree and are bound together by assorted ties, represented by alliances and partnerships. Any signifi cant occurrence in one unit and country of tourist arrival or departure thus has implications for them all.\n\nThe tourism industry caters to nationals traveling within their country of residence (domestic tourists), residents crossing international borders (outbound tourists) and visitors entering from another country (inbound tourists). Transport, hospitality and attractions sectors supply domestic and inbound tourists, and tour operators and travel agents deal mainly with residents going overseas, with some sales of domestic products. However, outbound and inbound tourists travel by foreign air and surface transport carriers and the latter may buy from overseas agents and operators. Linkages thus transcend national boundaries to create an international network or industry. Some of the largest organizations operate globally and the tourism industry is an outcome of globalization as well as a vehicle for its diffusion, creating opportunities and constraints.\n\nIt is not only markets that exhibit great diversity, but also tourism products. While encompassing some physical elements, tourism also has a psychological and sociological meaning (Krippendorf, 1987) and the industry has to aim to understand and satisfy both emotional and material requirements. In addition, its products possess the inseparability, variability, perishability and intangibility which characterize all services (Kotler et al., 1999) . They comprise encounters among individuals in which the tourist is part of the production process. Maintaining the desired standard and consistency is thus made diffi cult, aggravated by the fact that suppliers of one constituent rely on others to deliver the complete experience. Sales and marketing are further complicated by perishability whereby lost revenue from unsold airline seats and hotel rooms cannot be recovered at a later date so that yields must be managed effectively.\n\nThe above comments indicate why and how the tourism industry is prone to crisis. It has a complex structure and sells experiential products which are the collective work of several suppliers, leading to possible problems of fragmentation and control. Relationships of mutual dependence among components also mean that a crisis for one may spread to another. Such contagion is evident in destination crises when a precipitating event leads to a sudden fall in arrivals which has repercussions for accommodation, attraction and transport providers as well as government agencies and tour operators and travel agents at home and abroad.\n\nThere is fi erce competition among destinations and within sectors, with a trend toward concentration and consolidation. Extremely large and powerful companies have emerged and commercial pressures can result in corporate crises, often related to fi nancial matters. It must also be remembered that the industry is not the preserve of large corporations and small businesses are very active; some of these are particularly vulnerable and may be ill equipped to handle crises (Cushnahan, 2004) .\n\nThere are striking contrasts between tourist products and other consumer goods which elevate the probability of crisis. The industry must move people to the primary place of consumption and accommodate and entertain them on arrival, the journey itself being one aspect of production. These visits could be marred and tourist safety compromised by a host of incidents which may or may not be the fault of those making the practical arrangements. Examples include transport accidents, hotel fi res, street riots in which tourists are caught up and their victimization by criminals. Destinations where there are doubts about safety and security are near to a crisis of a tarnished image, offi cial warnings against travel and a decline in visitors.\n\nTourism has also expanded at a rapid rate to become one of the world's leading industries, but movement on such a scale and development at such a pace have had economic, socio-cultural and environmental impacts. These impacts have inspired debate about the costs and benefi ts of tourism, not least for Third World countries, and strong opposition in some instances. The industry has been criticized for its pursuit of short-term economic gains and exploitation of resources which have impeded progress toward more sustainable tourism (Tourism Concern, 2005) . The presence of tourists and their capacity to act as an instrument of destructive change are reasons underlying certain types of destination crises.\n\nAt the same time, national and international events unconnected to tourism can curtail demand and the working of the industry, and it has been argued that the result is a state of \"dynamic chaos and turbulence\" (Laws et al., 1998, p. 5) . Given this apparent predisposition to many types of crises, warnings about the inevitability of confrontation (Blaikie et al., 1994; Kash and Darling, 1998) are especially apposite for the tourism industry. The question is not whether a crisis will have to be faced, but when and what the reaction should be. Investment in planning and management are therefore vital and the next section outlines key tasks to be performed before and during the evolution of a crisis.\n\nCrisis management is perhaps a self-explanatory term and there is, again, no standard defi nition. Santana (2004, p. 308 ) did, however, capture its scope and intentions when he wrote of an \"ongoing integrated and comprehensive effort that organizations effectively put into place in an attempt to fi rst and foremost understand and prevent crisis, and to effectively manage those that occur, taking into account in each and every step of their planning and training activities, the interests of their stakeholders.\" Such an outline is applicable to tourism crisis management, which is described in the list of concept defi nitions at the end of the chapter as planning for and managing tourism crises in order to protect the interests of the industry, tourists and other stakeholders involved and contain any long-term damage. It should be stressed that the industry incorporates public bodies with tourism planning, development and promotion functions as well as commercial operators.\n\nGeneral theories postulate that crises advance in stages which have been labeled prodromal (warning), acute (at the height of the crisis), chronic (aftermath), and resolution (Fink, 1986) . They can be conceived of as circular journeys which begin and end at normality after moving through incubation; precipitating event; immediate consequences; rescue, salvage and fi rst stage of adjustment; and full cultural adjustment (Turner, 1976) . Essentially, these authors depicted three intervals of pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis which are likely to be of varying lengths. There may be no, or very little, time for action prior to crises which arrive without warning and duration will depend on the particular case, as will the speed of recovery. Nevertheless, complete restoration of the status quo may be impossible because people and organizations are permanently altered by crisis and sometimes do not survive.\n\nThe evolution of a crisis can also be viewed as a set of tasks for managers who must detect signals, prepare and try to prevent, contain, limit damage and pursue recovery (Pauchant and Mitroff, 1992) . These tasks imply the assumption of either a reactive or proactive stance while interactivity permits learning, knowledge gained helping to ensure that organizations are better placed to withstand or avert future crises (Burling and Hyle, 1997) . Practical measures to reduce the chances of a similar crisis recurring or another emerging should also be seen to be taken in order to reassure and restore confi dence amongst tourists, industry partners and investors. Managers must anticipate and evaluate the likelihood of crises, devise policies designed to prevent them and formulate strategies for coping when they do happen (Regester and Larkin, 1998) . The main aims are therefore to reduce risks, get ready, respond and recover (Heath, 1998) .\n\nDocumented and tested crisis plans, detailing actions and staff roles and responsibilities, occupy a central place in crisis management (Smith, 1990; Smith and Sipika, 1993) . Teams need to be identifi ed in advance and duties allocated accordingly. Plans should be informed by comprehensive research into, and understanding of, national and global trends of relevance to operations. Risk awareness is fundamental to preparation and prevention and more serious situations require mechanisms for industry-wide and perhaps international cooperation. Internal and external communications is a key area, with many audiences to address. The plan does not end with publication and circulation and it should be monitored and revised in the light of new circumstances. It also cannot be relied on alone and organizations should strive to foster a suitable culture with competent staff able to rise to the most diffi cult and demanding of occasions.\n\nSpecifi c studies of tourism organizations, industry sectors and destinations in crisis echo these conclusions about crisis evolution and management while acknowledging tourism's distinctiveness as a human, administrative and commercial activity (Atkas and Gunlu, 2005; Brewton, 1987; Doeg, 1995; Evans and Elphick, 2005; Henderson, 1999; Pottorff and Neal, 1994) . For example, the parameters of initial risk assessment or environmental scanning exercises must be comparatively broad for the tourism industry in view of the importance of developments in outside arenas. Marketers cannot recall faulty tourism products and lives are endangered in the worst examples of service failure, necessitating appropriate safety procedures. Tourists may have to be repatriated or moved from destinations struck by crisis and arrangements made for those whose departure is imminent, with logistical and resource implications to be planned for. There is also recognition that certain tourism crises unfold in ways that cannot be forecast. Reality is more confused than logical models imply, those in charge may be unable to adhere to prearranged programs and managers have to struggle with formidable dilemmas for which they have no instructions. Faulkner's (2001) conceptual framework pertains to a tourist destination hit by a natural disaster and is one of the most commonly quoted. It has been employed, with and without amendment, in analyses of other types of tourism crises. The process commences with an initial pre-event phase, when avoiding a disaster or containing its consequences is still feasible, and moves on to a prodromal state in which this is no longer an option. The emergency period is a time for action to protect life and property and is followed by intermediate and long-term recovery before ultimate resolution. A list of responses to match each phase is presented, alongside management strategies founded on thorough and continuously reviewed and updated risk assessment and contingency plans. Overall, prerequisites of success in managing a tourism crisis are maximum preparedness, a willingness to accept responsibility, rapid action, transparency and good communications. Realizing these objectives is facilitated by a plan setting the direction for all personnel; some examples are discussed in the fi nal chapter.\n\nResearch exploring tourism crises and their management is often grounded in the wider literature about corporate crises which is extensive (Barton, 2001; Booth, 1993; Mitroff, 2004; Shiva, 2000) . This draws on empirical data and personal experience, commentators coming from different management sciences and other disciplines such as psychology, sociology and economics. The strong interest in communications means that it is now a sub-fi eld, indicative of the crucial infl uence of the media on the intensity and duration of crises (ten Berg, 1990; Bland, 1998; Ogrizek and Guillery, 1999) . Many publications are targeted at business executives and several cite illustrations from the tourism industry, especially transport accidents (Harvard Business School, 2004; Lagadec, 1993; Laye, 2002; Levitt, 1997) .\n\nHowever, the spate of tourism crises in the past decade and predictions of more to come have meant that the subject is attracting much greater attention among tourism academics (Beirman, 2003; Faulkner and Russell, 1997; Glaesser, 2005; McKercher, 1999; Nankervis, 2000; Ritchie, 2004; Santana, 2001; Wilks et al., 2005) alongside practitioners (PATA, 2003; WTO, 1996 and WTO and WMO, 1998) . Indeed, it appears to be emerging as a distinct stream in the tourism literature. Much of this work is centered on case studies and concentrates on recovery marketing and management, demonstrating both good and bad practice. There is perhaps an emphasis on extrinsic causes of crisis rather than intrinsic organizational weaknesses and on destination perspectives. Tourism crises are shown to generate widespread, and potentially very damaging, publicity (Gonzalez-Herrero and Pratt, 1998; Lehrman, 1986) .\n\nFindings reveal some evidence of reluctance on the part of the tourism industry in the past to accept the possibility of crisis and prepare for it. Actual and potential hazards facing tourists have tended to be downplayed because of fears about adverse media coverage and commercial losses. For example, a Pacifi c Asia Travel Association (PATA) survey undertaken in 1991 disclosed that only a minority of members included crisis management in strategic planning, despite the 40% chance of them facing a crisis (Cassedy, 1991) . The formulation and execution of crisis management strategies do not seem to have become universal in the intervening years (Prideaux, 2003) and plans that do exist have their limitations (de Sausmarez, 2003; Drabek, 1995) .\n\nHowever, the major tourism crises experienced recently and described in this book are leading to a re-assessment of attitudes toward crisis management planning and the topic is now taken more seriously within the tourism industry. It is being allocated a much higher priority with a search for fl exible plans which strike a balance between being too precise and overly generic and are capable of accommodating envisaged scenarios.\n\nCrises and their management are thus matters of great importance generally and with specifi c reference to tourism. Tourism crises display a striking diversity and have a variety of causes founded in economic, political, socio-cultural, environmental, technological and corporate domains. Patterns of evolution differ in terms of speed and the duration of each crisis stage and consequences are felt at multiple levels of industry and geographical area, with corresponding contrasts in gravity. It appears that the tourism industry is susceptible to crisis, with defi ning qualities which set it apart from other industries, and that the incidence of crisis will intensify.\n\nKnowledge about crises and preparing for them is advancing and those responsible have perhaps more information at their disposal than ever before to assist in decision and policy making. However, despite the enlarged body of literature devoted to theoretical and more practical themes, there is still a lack of quantitative and qualitative data about the extent, composition and effectiveness of formal crisis management planning within the tourism industry.\n\nOpportunities for research are likely to grow as both crises and crisis management activity increase. Avenues for further study are discussed in the fi nal chapter of this book, which also returns to questions of the effi cacy of tourism crisis management plans. Nevertheless, it is hoped that the following chapters on the separate domains of crisis will contribute to an improved understanding of the reasons underlying tourism crises, the ensuing results and processes of resolution.\n\nTourism crisis: Circumstances in which tourists and members of the tourism industry individually or collectively, including destinations, are faced with change which is potentially destructive for every, or certain, parties. Tourism crisis management: Planning for and managing tourism crises in order to protect the interests of the industry, tourists and other stakeholders involved and contain any long-term damage. The tourism industry: The public and private organizations which provide tourist products and services, market them and deal with development and planning."}
