{"title": "", "body": "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immune mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that produces multiple inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord, particularly in the white matter. ADEM should be distinguished from other central inflammatory demyelinating disorders of children, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated syndromes that include optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, and neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease). Most of these disorders are thought to be caused by immune system dysregulation triggered by an infectious or other environmental agent in a genetically susceptible host.\n\nADEM is often preceded by a viral or bacterial infection, usually in the form of a nonspecific upper respiratory infection. In 3 previous studies, an antecedent infection was identified in 72 to 77 percent of ADEM patients [1] [2] [3] . In general, patients will present within 1 month of this initial illness. Numerous [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Other organisms associated include Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia, Leptospira, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Rickettsia, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus 4, 12) .\n\nLess than 5 percent of all ADEM cases follow immunization. Postvaccinal ADEM has been associated with immunization for rabies, hepatitis B, influenza, Japanese B encephalitis, diphtheria/ pertussis/tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, pneumococcus, polio, smallpox, and varicella 12) . No infectious agent is isolated in most cases. Currently, measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination are most often associated with postvaccination ADEM. It is important to recognize the significant difference between the incidence of ADEM associated with the live measles vaccination (1 to 2 per million) and the incidence of ADEM previously associated with the measles virus infection (1 in 1,000) 13) .\n\nThe pathogenesis of ADEM is incompletely understood. The proposed mechanism of ADEM is that myelin autoantigens, such as myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and myelin oligodendrocyte protein, share antigenic determinants with those of an infecting pathogen 12) . This model is supported by studies of lymphocytes in children with ADEM. In 1 report, the frequency of T cell reactivity to myelin basic protein was 10 times higher in patients with ADEM than in those with encephalitis or normal controls 5) .\n\nMS is usually thought to be a disease of young adults. However, pediatric MS, defined as onset of MS before the age of 16, is being increasingly recognized. MS presents before the age of 16 in approximately 5 percent of patients 14, 15) . In less than 1 percent of patients, the onset of MS occurs before the age of 10 years 16) . In addition, pediatric MS affects girls more than boys, with a female to male ratio of 2.8 17) . Since pediatric MS is rare, a child with recurrent episodes of acute neurologic symptoms and white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be originally misdiagnosed with one of several other disorders, including leukodystrophies, vasculopathies, lymphoma, mitochondrial defects, and other metabolic disorders, rather than MS.\n\nNeurologic symptoms of ADEM commonly appear 4 to 13 days after the infection or vaccination [1] [2] [3] . Fever, headache, vomiting, and meningismus are often seen at the time of initial presentation and may persist during hospitalization 2, 18) . Encephalopathy is a characteristic feature and may progress rapidly in association with multifocal neurologic deficits 4) . Progression of initial neurologic signs to maximum deficits usually occurs within 4 to 7 days 1, 3) . The level of consciousness ranges from subtle lethargy to frank coma. The altered mental status often raises concern regarding the risk of seizures, although these occur in only one-third of patients 3, 19) .\n\nIn addition to encephalopathy, the most common neurologic features of ADEM include long tract (pyramidal tract) signs, acute hemiparesis, cerebellar ataxia, cranial neuropathies, including optic neuritis, and spinal cord dysfunction (transverse myelitis) [2] [3] [4] 18, 19) . Symptoms of optic neuritis include vision loss, pain with eye movement, and an afferent pupillary defect. Inflammation of the optic disc may be seen by direct funduscopic examination if there is extensive involvement of the optic nerve. The imaging of the optic nerve with a gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain and orbits is a more sensitive means to diagnose optic neuritis in these patients. Symptoms of transverse myelitis include flaccid paralysis of the legs with a change in sensory level on examination. Bowel and bladder involvement secondary to spinal cord disease results in constipation and urinary retention. The arms can be involved if the demyelinating lesion affects the cervical cord. Respiratory failure may appear with high cervical lesions that extend into the brainstem. Aphasia, movement disorders, and sensory deficits are unusual. The severe phase of ADEM generally lasts from 2 to 4 weeks. Children may show deterioration in their condition after hospital admission, and most of them develop new neurologic signs. Patients usually recover completely from the acute illness, although some have neurologic sequelae.\n\nMS is a clinical diagnosis and is characterized by spatially and temporally distinct recurrent episodes of demyelination in the CNS.\n\nAcute inflammation and demyelination in a critical area of the brain, optic nerves, or spinal cord can induce a corresponding neurologic deficit. There are no clinical signs that are unique to this disorder, but some are highly characteristic (Table 1) 20) . Common symptoms of MS are listed in Table 2 20) . A European observational study of 394 children with pediatric-onset MS and 1,775 patients with adult-onset MS showed that children were more likely than adults to present with isolated optic neuritis, an isolated brainstem syndrome, or symptoms of encephalopathy 17) .\n\nA clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) is defined as a single monosymptomatic attack compatible with MS, such as optic neuritis. An episode of CIS can produce diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas ( Fig.  1) , since the vast majority of children will not have a recurrence after a single demyelinating event of the CNS. The value of examinations, including brain MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses, and other laboratory studies to identify those at high risk of recurrence, is unclear 21) .\n\nThe diagnosis of ADEM is based on clinical and radiological features 4) . There is no specific biological marker or confirmatory test. ADEM should be suspected in a child who develops multifocal neurologic abnormalities with encephalopathy (e.g., confusion, excessive irritability, or an altered level of consciousness), especially if onset occurs one to two weeks after a viral infection or vaccination.\n\nThe MRI abnormalities seen in ADEM are best defined using T2weighted images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences (Fig. 2 ). Contrast enhancement is sometimes seen in acute lesions. Lesions associated with ADEM are typically bilateral but may be asymmetric and tend to be poorly marginated. Almost all patients have multiple lesions in the deep and subcortical white matter, while the periventricular white matter is generally spared. The thalami and basal ganglia are frequently affected (Fig. 2) , and lesions in these locations are often symmetrical 3, 22) . Brainstem and spinal cord abnormalities on MRI are common in ADEM 12) . The number of lesions varies, and their diameters range from <5 mm to 5 cm 1,3) . Values are presented as %.\n\nIn the spinal cord, large confluent intramedullary lesions that extend over multiple segments are common 3, 12) , and the degree of contrast enhancement is variable. Abnormal findings on MRI may progress over a relatively short period of time, consistent with progression of the disease. Sequential imaging by MRI is sometimes required to confirm the diagnosis of ADEM, as the occurrence of relapses, with new lesions on MRI, is not compatible with a diagnosis of monophasic ADEM, and suggests that the correct diagnosis is either multiphasic ADEM or MS, based upon the clinical symptoms and neuroimaging findings 4) . Analysis of CSF reveals pleocytosis and/or increased protein concentration in the majority of patients with ADEM 1,2) . However, the CSF can also be normal. Oligoclonal bands in CSF are seen in some patients with ADEM, but are a nonspecific finding more often associated with multiple sclerosis. Evaluation for infectious agents includes viral cultures of samples from the throat and nasopharynx, stool, and CSF, and serologic testing for influenza, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes, varicella, mycoplasma, cytomegalovirus, and rubella. These studies are rarely positive 12) .\n\nDiagnostic criteria for ADEM in children have been proposed by the International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group (Table  3) 23) . The major criteria are a clinical attack of CNS demyelinating disease with acute or subacute onset, polysymptomatic neurologic features, and encephalopathy. Encephalopathy as a presenting symptom is essential for a diagnosis of ADEM, according to the Study Group criteria 23) . Encephalopathy is defined as including either behavioral changes, such as lethargy or irritability, or more severe alterations in the level of consciousness, such as coma. The onset of occurring within three months of the inciting ADEM episode are considered part of the same acute event. In addition, ADEM relapses that occur during a steroid taper or within four weeks of completing a steroid taper are considered part of the initial inciting ADEM episode. Lesion Characteristics on MRI FLAIR and T2 weighted images Large (>1 to 2 cm in size) multifocal, hyperintense, bilateral, asymmetric lesions in the supratentorial or infratentorial white matter. Rarely, brain MRI shows a single large (\u22651 to 2 cm) lesion predominantly affecting white matter. Gray matter, especially basal ganglia and thalamus, may be involved Spinal cord MRI may show confluent intramedullary lesion(s) with variable enhancement, in addition to the abnormalities on brain MRI No radiologic evidence of previous destructive white matter changes Encephalopathy is a required feature for the diagnosis of ADEM, but is not a typical feature of multiple sclerosis. In addition, a cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis \u226550 white blood cells/mm can be observed in ADEM, whereas this finding is highly atypical for multiple sclerosis. CNS, central nervous system; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; FLAIR, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. encephalopathy almost directly corresponds to the occurrence of the disease state. This feature helps to differentiate ADEM from other clinically isolated syndromes that are related to recurrence of MS and will lead to a subsequent MS diagnosis. Brain MRI criteria for ADEM diagnosis include focal or multifocal lesions predominantly involving the white matter, without evidence of previous white-matter changes.\n\nThe diagnostic criteria can also distinguish between monophasic ADEM with early relapses, and recurrent forms of ADEM 23) on the basis of the following conditions:\n\n-A single clinical episode of ADEM, monophasic ADEM, may evolve over as long as 3 months 23) . Any new and fluctuating symptoms occurring within 3 months of the initial event are con sidered to be part of the same event. In addition, symptoms that appear during tapering of glucocorticoid therapy, or within 1 month of completing a glucocorticoid taper, are considered to be part of the same episode.\n\n-Recurrent ADEM refers to the recurrence, 3 or more months after the first ADEM event, of the same symptoms that occurred at the time of the initial presentation. The MRI findings are similar to those seen at the initial event and are without new lesions, although there may be enlargement of the original lesions.\n\n-Multiphasic ADEM describes recurrent disease that fulfills criteria for ADEM but involves new anatomic areas of the CNS upon recurrence. Symptoms and signs are different from those in the initial event. The MRI must show new lesions not present during the first attack and demonstrate complete or partial resolution of the lesions associated with the first ADEM episode.\n\nUntil 2006, the Poser criteria were considered the most useful in making a diagnosis of pediatric MS 24) . In 2007, the Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group proposed new working definitions for pediatric MS and related demyelinating diseases such as ADEM 23) . Dissemination in space, demonstrated by: \u22659 T2 lesions in the brain or 2 or more lesions in the spinal cord or 4 to 8 brain plus 1 spinal cord lesion or abnormal visual evoked potential (delay with a well preserved wave form, typical of MS) associated with 4 to 8 brain lesions or with fewer than 4 brain lesions plus 1 spinal cord lesion demonstrated by MRI and Dissemination in time, demonstrated by: MRI \u2020 or continued progression for 1 year MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; MS, multiple sclerosis. *MRI criteria include 3 or 4 of the following: 1 gadolinium enhancing lesion or 9 T2 hyperintense lesions if there is no gadolinium enhancing lesion; at least 1 infratentorial lesion; at least 1 juxtacortical lesion; at least 3 periventricular lesions; 1 spinal cord lesion can be substituted for 1 brain lesion. \u2020 For MRI dissemination in time criteria, see Table 3 .\n\nwhile the 2007 pediatric MS criteria demand that a minimum of 3 months must pass between clinical events or the appearance of new MRI lesions 23) .\n\nA characteristic pattern of MS on MRI would include multiple well-demarcated lesions in the periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord white matter. These areas of demyelination are best recognized using T2-weighted sequences. T2 FLAIR image sequences are the most sensitive in this evaluation, especially for periventricular lesions (Fig. 3) . T1-weighted sequences may reveal \"black holes\" that represent complete tissue loss resulting from a previous inflammatory event (Fig. 3) . Enhancement of active areas of inflammation and blood-brain barrier compromise can be seen using T1 gadolinium contrast sequences. Retrospective studies suggest that children with MS onset have more T2 bright lesions in the posterior fossa and more gadolinium-enhancing lesions than adults 27) . Further, the lesions in children were more likely to show reversibility on follow-up MRI than lesions in adults, suggesting better recovery of demyelination in children.\n\nDetection of increased specific immunoglobulins present only in the CSF is often useful for supporting the diagnosis of MS in adult patients. A CSF sample is considered potentially positive for MS based upon the finding of either oligoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) bands or an increased IgG index 25) . In children, the utility of CSF oligoclonal bands in MS diagnosis has been questioned 1) . However, positive CSF findings, when associated with new lesions on follow-up MRI, can be used to make the diagnosis of MS even in the case of a single clinical attack 25) .\n\nIn the case of a child who presents with neurologic abnormalities, If there is no enhancing lesion at this time, a follow-up scan is required (recommended to be performed 3 months later). A new T2 or gadoliniumenhancing lesion on the follow-up scan demonstrates dissemination in time.\n\nFirst scan less than three months after onset of clinical evenofft A second scan should be performed 3 months after the onset of the clinical event. A new gadolinium-enhancing lesion on this scan demonstrates dissemination in time.\n\nIf there is no new enhancing lesion on the second scan, another followup scan is required (at least 3 months after the first scan). A new T2 or enhancing lesion on this third scan demonstrates dissemination in time.\n\nMRI, magnetic resonance imaging. Fig. 3 . Axial T2-weighted (A) and axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) (B) images show multiple, ovoid shaped, hyperintense foci in the periventricular area, consistent with multiple sclerosis plaques. Sagittal FLAIR (C) image also shows these lesions to be radiating out from the corpus callosum. Axial precontrast T1-weighted (D) image shows that many of these lesions are hypointense, consistent with black holes. Axial postgadolinium fat saturated T1-weighted (E) image shows that some of these plaques enhance in a ring-like fashion consistent with active plaques.\n\nincluding signs of encephalitis, bacterial and viral meningitis or encephalitis must be considered and ruled out. In the setting of nonspecific CSF abnormalities and identification of white-matter lesions on MRI, other inflammatory demyelinating disorders should be considered. These include ADEM, MS, optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, neuromyelitis optica, and other rare disorders. At initial onset, ADEM and MS cannot be distinguished absolutely. In children, subsequent attacks of MS may not occur for months or years. Furthermore, a small number of children with ADEM may finally develop MS, but it is difficult to accurately predict in which patients this will occur. Therefore, prolonged follow-up is required to establish a diagnosis."}
