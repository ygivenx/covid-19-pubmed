{"title": "\u2022 REVIEW \u00b7 Endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis in the development of reproduction", "body": "chaperones in the ER facilitate the proper folding of individual proteins and the formation of macromolecular complexes. The disruption ofER functions by depletion ofER Ca 2 + stores, inhibition ofasparagine (N)-linked protein glycosylation, disturbance ofdisulfide bond formation, or viral infection, leads to protein misfolding and subsequent protein aggregation. Over the last decades, it has become clear that the accumulation of misfolded proteins contributes to a number ofneurodegenerative, immune, and endocrine pathologies, as well as other agerelated illnesses!'! In large part, the misfolding of proteins takes place during synthesis of free ribosomes in the cytoplasm or of ER ribosomes.\n\nIn fact, even under optimal conditions, approximately 30% of all newly synthesized proteins are rapidly degraded, most likely because of improper folding. Accordingly, stresses that perturb the folding ofproteins during or soon after synthesis can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and to potential cellular dysfunction and pathological consequences. To avert such outcomes, cells have developed elaborate protein quality-control systems for detecting misfolded proteins and making appropriate adjustments to the machinery responsible for protein synthesis and/or degradation. For experimental purposes, chemicals such as thapsigargin (which depletes Ca 2 + from ER), tunicamycin (which inhibits protein N-linked glycosylation), and dithiothreitol (which disrupts protein disulfide bonds) are used to induce ER stress (ERS) in cultured cells or animals. There are three distinct signaling pathways that are triggered in response to ERS, initiated by protein kinase activated by ds RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring enzyme-I (IREI)( Figure I ). IREI has at least two different actions. First, the endoribonuclease activity oflREI cleaves XBP-I mRNA, converting it into a potent transcriptional activator that, in tum, induces gene expression of proteins involved in protein degradation'v\". Second, recent studies from several laboratories have shown that IRE I links ERS to the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. Specifically, IREI binds to tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and through its kinase activity couples ERS to activation of JNK[5J. The activation of JNK by ERS requires the presence of apoptosis signal regulating kinase-l (ASK1Y6,7]. It has therefore been proposed that ERS induces the formation of IREI-TRAF2 complex that leads to ASKI-JNK activation'?', Some studies have reported that the ERS response occurs several physiological and pathological process, including inflammationl\", the immune responselv'?' in SH-SY5Y cells!'!', and RNA viruses!\", in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease'!\".\n\nIn addition, some recent researches have suggested that the ERS response is also involved in reproduction. This paper mainly introduced the research progress of ERSinduced apoptosis ofreproductive (preimplantation embryos, placenta and in testicular germ) cells, providing important insight into the molecular mechanisms ofERS induced reproductive disease. or XBPI null mice are unable to produce functioual placentas, which is lethal to the embryo, implying that the IRE lOtarm ofthe UPR coping response is essential for placental development and embryonic viability''\". Furthermore, ERS-induced coping responses in the maternal decidua and placenta may counteract developmental problems during implantation and postimplantation development. The findings ofLuo et al. [17] provided the first evidence that GRP78\n\nis essential for embryonic cell growth and pluripotent cell survival.\n\nMaterual exposure to cadmium resulted in activation of PERK, phosphorylation of placental eIF2Ot,and an increase in CHOP, indicating that UPR signaling is activated in the placenta due to cadmium-induced toxicityl'v. Among UPR constitoents, p-eIF2Ot, GRP94, and CHOP are increased in the placenta from intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and\n\npreeclampsia, indicating that ERS responses are also inducible under diseased conditionsl'Pl,\n\nThe function ofthe placenta is impaired by both loss ofERS response and excessive ERS [20] , in absolute values there is general agreement that apoptosis is increased in IUGR placentas, and even more so in those from cases of IUGR+PE. This increase in cell death could also contribute to the smaller placental phenotype, but more importantly may underlie the shedding of trophoblastic microparticles that occurs in preeclampsia but not in IUGR alonel-\".\n\nThis debris has been implicated in the activation of the maternal endothelial cells that characterise the maternal syndromel'\". and FGR + PE. It will be important to elucidate the relationship between alteration of the decidua function and late pregnancy in future studies. Interestingly, passive cigarette smoke during pregnancy, which was reported to induce an ERS response, increases the mean relative area of spongiotrophoblast cells in the placenta and causes IUGR with a reduction in placental blood flOW [30] . Further study demonstrated the formation of a cluster of spongiotrophoblast cells in the labyrinth zone of the placenta of Tun-treated mice. The glycogen content of the fetal liver and placenta from Tun-treated mice was lower than that from control mice. Tun treatment decreased mRNA expression of Slc2al/glucose transporter (GLDT)-l, which is a major transporter for glucose, but increased placental mRNA levels of Slc2a3/GLUT3. Moreover, maternal exposure to Tun resulted in a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-l, VEGFR-2, and placental growth factor. The results suggest that excessive and exogenous ERS may induce functional abnormalities in the placenta, at least in part, with altered GLDT and vascular-related gene expression, resulting in low infant birth weightl\"! Some other researchers observed that lead exposure significantly induced ER apoptosis compared with that of the controls accompanied with increased caspase-12 mRNA expression.\n\nIn lead-exposed groups, trophoblast cells underwent degeneration and fibrin deposition, mitochondria were swollen and decreased in number ER swelling expansion and vacuolization.\n\nLead exposure contributes to placental apoptosis, as well as increased caspase-12 mRNA expression, which in turn promoted ER [32] . \n\nER, one of the major organelles of eukaryotic cells, is an important place for protein folding and modifying. The homeostasis of ER can be broken and ERS will caused by many physiological and pathological factors.\n\nAt the same time, an ERS coping response are expressed in reproduction (preimplantation embryos, testicular germ cell), suggesting that ERS as a normal physiological coping mechanism plays a pivotal role in the development of reproduction.\n\nIn the presence ofERS, the data provide a theoretical reference to reveal the mechanism ofthe clinical early embryonic development stagnation, abortion, abnormal placenta treatment, such as: I) the increased ERS in decidual tissue has been shown to be implicated in FGR in pregnancy; 2) the major ERS pathway constituents are present at all stages of preimplantation development; 3) the reproductive toxicants exposure significantly caused elF2a and JNK phosphorylation in testes; 4) the development ofnovel targeted drugs that inhibit pathological apoptosis and maintain cellular homeostasis."}
