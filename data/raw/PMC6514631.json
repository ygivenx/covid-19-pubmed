{"title": "Glycosylation of the viral attachment protein of avian coronavirus is\nessential for host cell and receptor binding", "body": "Avian coronaviruses of poultry cause significant disease with subsequent economic\nlosses in several commercially farmed bird species. Avian infectious bronchitis\nvirus (IBV)2 is a gammacoronavirus\nthat predominantly affects domestic fowl, primarily chickens (Gallus\ngallus). The virus initially infects upper airway epithelium tissues,\nand depending on the IBV strain, disease outcomes range from mild respiratory\ndisease to kidney failure and death (1).\n\nThe viral envelope of IBV contains the highly-glycosylated spike (S) protein that is\npost-translationally cleaved into two domains, S1 and S2. This S glycoprotein is the\nmajor adhesion molecule of the virus. It is a class I viral fusion protein, in which\nthe variable S1 domain is involved in host cell receptor binding, and the more\nconserved S2 domain mediates the fusion of the virion with the cellular membrane\n(2, 3). The role of spike in host cell attachment and the induction of\nprotective immunity has been reviewed (4). The\nspike protein monomer is a transmembrane glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 128\nkDa before glycosylation (3). A cleavable\nN-terminal signal peptide (5) directs the S\nprotein toward the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is extensively modified with\nN-linked glycosylation (6, 7). After glycosylation in the ER,\nthe monomers oligomerize to form trimers (6\u20139).\n\nThe N-terminal 253 amino acids of S1 were shown to encompass the receptor-binding\ndomain (RBD) of IBV strain M41 (10), which\ninteracts with sialyl-\u03b12,3\u2013substituted glycans present on the host's\ncell surface (11, 12). Ten N-linked glycosylation sites are\npredicted to exist on the M41\u2013RBD (5),\nof which most are highly conserved (Fig.\nS1). It is interesting that 8 of the 10 sites are 95\u2013100%\nconserved. Sites Asn-33 and Asn-59 were less conserved at 80 and 25%. However, each\nhad a nearby alternative site that was also highly conserved. Alternative site\nAsn-36 was conserved 50% of the time, and one or both Asn-33 and Asn-36 was present\nin 94% of the sequences. Site Asn-57 was conserved at 73%. In 97% of the sequences,\neither Asn-59 or Asn-57 was present but never together. Therefore, all 10 sites,\nincluding the alternatives, likely serve important functions.\n\nThe N-glycosylation of viral glycoproteins is known to modulate the\nability of viruses to infect host cells and to be recognized by the host's immune\nsystem (13). Recently, Zheng et\nal. (14) studied extracted spike\nproteins and mutant viruses with Asn-to-Asp (asparagine to aspartate) and Asn-to-Gln\n(asparagine to glutamine) mutations at 13 predicted glycosylation sites in the S\nprotein of the Beaudette IBV strain (14).\nTheir results indicate that glycosylation at some sites on the Beaudette S1-RBD was\nimportant for viral fusion and infectivity, which may include host recognition.\nHowever, the Beaudette strain is a cell culture\u2013adapted strain, is\nnonvirulent in chickens (15), and does not\nbind chicken tissues known to be important for infectivity (11), making it difficult to extrapolate these results to\nclinically relevant IBVs.\n\nTo characterize and assess the role that glycosylation plays when interacting with\nhost tissues through the RBD of pathogenic IBV strain M41, we used a combination of\nmolecular and analytical techniques, including histochemistry, ELISA, circular\ndichroism (CD), MS, and docking analyses as listed in Table 1. Systematic deletion of each glycosylation site and\nhistochemical analysis of each variant revealed which of the 10 glycosylation sites\naffect the binding of IBV S protein to host epithelial tissue. Site occupancy\nanalysis by LC/MSE indicated that at least 9 of 10 predicted\nN-glycosylation sites in the M41\u2013RBD domain are\nglycosylated. Analysis of site occupancy and signature N-glycan\npatterns at each site in combination with single glycosylation site deletions\nprovided insight toward the biological relevance of each of those sites in binding\nto host tissue receptors. Overall, our data confirm that\nN-glycosylation plays a critical and likely unique role in binding\nof the IBV spike domain to its host tissue receptors.\n\nTo analyze the role of glycosylation of M41\u2013RBD in receptor binding,\nmissense mutants (Asn\u2013to\u2013Ala) were generated on a\nsite\u2013by\u2013site basis at each of the predicted\nN-glycosylation sites. Recombinantly produced glycovariant RBD\nproteins migrated with the same electrophoretic mobility as unmodified\nM41\u2013RBD (Fig. 1). The RBD proteins\nwere evaluated by CD spectroscopy to assess similarity to the WT secondary\nstructure. WT M41\u2013RBD, all 10 glycosylation-site variants, and two\nnonglycosylation variants, V57A and V58A, were analyzed for secondary structure\ndifferences at 25 \u00b0C. Thermal melts were performed on each construct from\n25 to 95 \u00b0C followed by full scans collected at 95 \u00b0C and again at 25\n\u00b0C after the melt. Overlays of all the CD spectra can be found in Fig.\nS2. Visually, all spectra at all temperatures follow the same\ncurve. The N85A spectra were generated at higher protein concentrations but\naligned well to CD spectra of all other variants when normalized to the percent\nof maximum signal. Likewise, all the proteins had analogous broad melting curves\nsuggesting the proteins were similarly stable. Protein folding was reversible\nfor all proteins, with comparable recovery rates (see CD\u201325\n\u00b0C\u2013aftermelt\u2013normalized in Fig.\nS2). Dichroweb (16) was\nused to calculate the percent of \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-strand, turn, and\nunordered portions of the protein in the initial 25 \u00b0C spectra to estimate\nsecondary structure differences between the proteins (Fig. 2). The percent of \u03b1-helix varied with the\nextremes being unmodified RBD and N145A. N145A exhibited 19.5 \u00b1 0.3%\n\u03b1-helix character as compared with WT, which has 31.6 \u00b1 2.4%.\nInterestingly, N145A gave a very strong signal in the histochemical assay (Fig. 3A) and had the most\nnotably different released glycans' signature compared with the other\nconstructs. We conclude that all proteins maintained a very similar structure\nand therefore suggest that single N-glycosylation sites are by\nthemselves not indispensable for protein folding or stability.\n\nBecause we established that all variant M41\u2013RBD proteins are folded, we\ninvestigated their abilities to bind tissue receptors. Recombinant proteins were\nincubated with chicken trachea tissue sections and examined by histochemical\nanalysis. N145A, N219A, N229A, N246A, V57A, and V58A bound ciliated epithelial\ncells of the chicken trachea with similar staining intensity as the unmodified\nRBD with the most intense staining associated with the N145A construct (Fig. 3A). In contrast,\nbinding of constructs N33A, N59A, N85A, N126A, N160A, and N194A to trachea\ntissue was not detectable. Removal of sialic acids by treatment of the trachea\ntissues with Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase (AUNA)\nabrogated binding of all constructs as shown in Fig.\nS4. These results demonstrate that glycosylation on the RBD\naffects binding to sialyl ligands on chicken trachea tissue.\n\nThe interaction of the variants with\nNeu5Ac(\u03b12\u20133)Gal(\u03b21\u20133)GlcNAc, a previously established\nligand for M41 (11), was assayed by\nELISA. N145A, N219A, N229A, and N246A variants were able to bind the ligand in a\nconcentration-dependent manner (Fig.\n3B) like unmodified RBD. Binding affinities of N33A,\nN59A, N85A, N126A, N160A, and N194A were significantly reduced compared with\nunmodified RBD and comparable with that of a negative control protein, the S1 of\nturkey coronavirus, with specificity for nonsialylated diLacNAc glycans (17). Fig.\n3C shows the ELISA absorbance at the 75 nmol of\nligand concentration for each construct. No significant difference was observed\nfor variants N145A, N219A, N229A, and N246A compared with unmodified RBD (shown\nin dark gray bars in Fig.\n3C). All other variants (shown in light gray\nbars in Fig.\n3C) demonstrated significantly lower affinity for\nthe receptor, consistent with histochemistry and ligand titration plot\nresults.\n\nSix of the 10 single glycosylation site variants lost the ability to bind ligand.\nTo investigate whether global changes in glycosylation may have affected\nbinding, we analyzed release glycans from each protein. Matrix-assisted laser\ndesorption/ionization\u2013time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS)\nanalysis of enzymatically released and permethylated glycans allows for\nsemi-quantitative analysis of glycan compositions. The method is particularly\nuseful for samples containing sialylated glycans because they are stabilized by\npermethylation. The percent abundances of glycans identified in each sample are\nshown in Fig. 4.\n\nThe majority of the Asn\u2013to\u2013Ala variants, as well as the V57A and\nV58A control variants, had similar MALDI-TOF-MS permethylation profiles (Fig. 4). Over 100 glycan compositions were\nidentified ranging from high-mannose glycans to large complex ones. Nearly half\nof the glycans contained at least one and up to three sialic acid molecules in\nall samples. The most intense glycoforms clustered in five groups with\nincreasing amounts of complexity as reflected by the number of\nN-acetyl glucosamines (HexNAcs). These include\nhigh-mannose, complex, and hybrid forms as follows: I,\nHex5\u20139HexNAc2 (high mannose); II,\nNeuAc0\u20131Hex5\u20136dHex0\u20131HexNAc3\n(complex and hybrid); III,\nNeuAc0\u20132Hex5dHex1HexNAc4(complex);\nIV, NeuAc0\u20131Hex6dHex1HexNAc5\n(complex); and V,\nNeuAc2Hex7dHex1HexNAc6\n(complex). High-mannose glycans were less abundant in unmodified M41 than in\nvariant RBDs. The N194A, N219A, and N229A variants contained diminished amounts\nof the group V high-mass complex glycans. The N145A variant was the most\natypical with less defined clustering in the common clustering regions of the\nspectrum and higher abundances in spectral regions where compositions had less\nHex and more HexNAc overall. For instance, cluster IV was shifted from glycans\nwith 6 hexoses\n(NeuAc0\u20131Hex6dHex1HexNAc5)\nto glycoforms with 3\u20134 hexoses\n(NeuAc0\u20131Hex3\u20134dHex1HexNAc5).\nMore abundance was observed in regions containing 6 HexNAc residues\n(NeuAc0\u20132Hex3\u20136dHex1HexNAc6).\nTo better understand the difference between N145A and the other constructs, we\ncalculated the monosaccharide percent mass and average mass for each construct.\nThe average mass percent for glycans across all released glycan pools was Hex\n(45.8%), HexNAc (42.0%), dHex (5.0%), and NeuAc (7.2%). The N145A construct had\nthe lowest amount of Hex (38.6%) and the highest amounts of HexNAc (46.0%) and\nNeuAc (9.8%). The former two were 2 S.D. or greater from the mean (see Table\nS2). This indicates that the N145A construct likely had shorter,\nmore branched, and more highly-charged glycans on average than the other\nconstructs. Two other variants had values more than 2 S.D. from the mean. N229A\n(normal binding) was most abundant in Hex (53.6%) and least abundant in HexNAc\n(37.5%) and dHex (3.8%), probably due to its higher high-mannose content. N246A\n(normal binding) had the lowest amount of NeuAc (3.6%). This is perhaps a\nreflection of the missing sugars in this variant because site Asn-246 in other\nvariants was populated with many sialylated glycoforms based on site-specific\nanalysis (Table\nS1).\n\nTo assess the differences in glycosylation on a site\u2013to\u2013site basis,\nglycopeptide LC/MS analysis was carried out on unmodified M41 and two single\nglycosylation site variants, N59A and N145A, that represented a nonbinder and a\nbinder of trachea tissue, respectively. M41\u2013RBD had 10 predicted\nglycosylation sites, whereas the variant RBDs had nine each. N145A was also of\nspecific interest due to the unique glycosylation pattern observed in its free\nglycan profile. As cleavage with trypsin alone resulted in glycopeptides with\nmore than one glycosylation site, we also analyzed glycopeptides after an\nadditional treatment with chymotrypsin, which resulted in one glycosite per\npeptide, the identification of more glycopeptides, and decreased ambiguity\nconcerning glycosylation site assignment.\n\nAlthough a protein may contain the sequence (NX(S/T)), where\nN-glycosylation is known to occur, it may not actually be\nglycosylated, or it may be glycosylated only part of the time. Potential\nglycosylation sites, their predicted glycosylation state, and their measured\nsite occupancy are shown in Table 2. Of\nthe 10 glycosites, all but Asn-246 were predicted to be glycosylated (occupied)\nbased on NetNGlyc analysis (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc-1.0/).3 Percent occupancy was analyzed\nby LC/MS; however, a poor signal was obtained for the Asn-219 site in M41 and\nN59A, and therefore, occupancies were not calculated. All other sites were\nestimated to be occupied at 89% or greater in M41 and N59A. The N145A variant\nexhibited site occupancy at all expected sites, including Asn-219, although\nsignal intensity at that site was low. Two sites had much lower occupancy in\nN145A as compared with the other samples. Site Asn-126 dropped to 61% occupancy\nand site Asn-246 to 79% occupancy compared with nearly complete occupancy in the\nN59A and M41 proteins. Overall site occupancy was high for all sites. The\ndifficulty in detecting some of the peptides, particularly Asn-219, may be due\nto hydrophobicity. Ionization is partially driven by hydrophobicity, and Asn-219\nonly had 20% hydrophobic character after the two digestions, which may, in part,\nexplain its low detectability. By comparison, glycopeptides containing Asn-85,\nAsn-145, and Asn-160 were short and between 21 and 33% hydrophobicity, whereas\nglycopeptides containing other sites had predicted hydrophobicity ranging from\n37 to 61% and tended to produce higher intensity spectra.\n\nGlycoform relative abundances at each site are listed in Table\nS1. Fig. 5 shows the\nlocation of each glycosylation site on the RBD of M41. Overall compositions at\neach site were similar in charge and size across the three constructs. A\nrepresentative glycan is shown at each site based on peak intensity. The N145A\nconstruct had glycoforms like those identified by MALDI-TOF MS with more HexNAc\nand fewer Hex compared with M41 and N59A.\n\nFewer overall glycan compositions were detected on glycopeptides by LC/MS\ncompared with the free glycans observed by MALDI-TOF MS (63\nversus 100 compositions). This can be expected because the\ntechnology of instrumentation used and the physiochemical characteristics of\npermethylated glycans and glycopeptides differ significantly. The forms detected\noverlapped between the two analyses.\n\nDuring our investigation, the first structure of the M41 spike protein was solved\nusing electron microscopy (EM) (18).\nMapping the glycosylation sites onto the structure did not lead to a clear\nunderstanding of how the mutations affect binding. Although EM structural\nresolution is limited, and the precise coordinates for the attached glycans are\nnot known, an attempt was made to dock a series of potentially sialylated\nligands to a glycan-stripped structure of the RBD and a structure that was\npopulated with glycans based on our data. The glycan chosen for each site on the\nRBD was based on the predominant glycans identified at each site by LC/MS (see\nFig. 5).\n\nSeventeen oligosaccharide ligands were chosen based on a previous glycan array\nstudy of M41 (11) and ELISA data (this\nwork). Both strong and weak binders were selected (Fig. 6). Each ligand was docked 20 times against both the\nsugar-stripped and in silico glycosylated M41\u2013RBD\ncoordinates. There was no statistically significant difference between the\ndocked binding energies of ligands that did and did not bind on the array. All\noligosaccharide ligands, except for 1, 3, 9, 13, 15, and 17, docked seven or\nmore times to one or more of the four sites on the M41 sugar-stripped structure\nwith no clear pattern differentiating between them (Fig. 6). In the sugar-stripped structure, all binding\noccurred at sites A and B. Site A is under the galectin fold near site Asn-194,\nand site B encompasses Asn-85 and Asn-59. All three glycosylation sites are\nrequired for binding to trachea tissue. The docking pattern changed dramatically\nwhen glycans were modeled onto the structure. The most dramatic change was seen\nat site D where eight ligands bound seven or more times, whereas interactions at\nall other sites decreased. There were no binders at site A, only two at site C\n(3 and 16) and three at site B (6, 9, and 17). All of the ligand\noligosaccharides that docked at site D were sialylated, consistent with ligands\nidentified by array and ELISA. No control ligand (1 and 2 uncharged; 3 and 4\nKDN-charged) bound at site D. The interaction at site D involved both\nsugar\u2013protein and sugar\u2013sugar contacts, and in some docking runs,\nthe interaction was completely sugar\u2013sugar. Site D is in the center of a\ncircle of glycosylation sites that showed altered binding profiles when mutated;\nN59A, N85A, and N160A lost the ability to bind, whereas N145A gave a very strong\nsignal in the histochemical assay.\n\nOf note, no ligands docked in the site at the top of the galectin fold where many\nstructural homologs of M41 are thought to bind sugars, such as the bovine\ncoronavirus RBD (19). For comparison, we\ndocked Neu5Ac(\u03b12\u20136)Gal(\u03b21\u20133)GlcNAc(\u03b2-OMe)\nagainst the crystal structure of the bovine RBD. Twenty five of 25 times the\nglycan docked in the proposed binding site at the top of the galectin fold in\nthe negatively-charged area of the bovine RBD control near Asn-198 (Fig. 7B).\n\nPreviously, we established that the IBV M41 S1 protein binds sialic acid-substituted\nglycoconjugate ligands in chicken trachea and lung tissue (11). Intriguingly, the M41 RBD is highly-glycosylated with 10\npotential glycosylation sites, and glycosylation appears to be necessary for binding\nto host tissues because treating the protein with a neuraminidase diminishes binding\n(11). This study extends our\ninvestigation toward determining the role of glycosylation in the function of the\nRBD, which encompasses the N-terminal region of the native protein. Each of the\npotential glycosylation sites was individually ablated, and each construct was\nexamined for its ability to bind tissue and an ELISA-presented ligand. In addition,\nthe global glycosylation profile of every construct was surveyed, and glycosylation\nof three representative constructs was examined on a site-specific basis.\n\nSix of the 10 glycosylation sites in the RBD domain of IBV M41 were essential for\nbinding to chicken trachea tissue and an ELISA-presented sialylated oligosaccharide\nligand. CD analysis demonstrated that both secondary structure and stability were\nsimilar across all the RBD constructs indicating the proper fold was likely retained\nfor all. Globally, percent abundances of sialylated glycans differed across mutants,\nbut the differences were not associated with loss of binding. For example, 51 and\n20% of the glycans in binding mutants N145A and N246A, respectively, and 46 and 51%\nof the glycans in the nonbinders N126A and N160A, respectively, were sialylated\n(summed from Fig. 4). By comparison, 40% of the\nglycans in the unmodified RBD construct were sialylated. On a site-specific basis,\nsome glycosylation sites had more sialylation than others (Table\nS1). On average, each of glycosites Asn-126, Asn-194, Asn-229, and\nAsn-246 were sialylated at least 50% of the time. Sites Asn-229 and Asn-246 were in\nthe less-ordered region of the protein away from the galectin fold where binding is\nassociated in the docking study. Site Asn-194 is at the bottom of the galectin fold\nand is required for ligand binding. Site Asn-126 is at the top of the galectin fold\nand is also required for binding. Although we cannot conclude that sialylation is\nrequired at Asn-194 and Asn-126, it is clear that glycosylation at these sites\nserves a role in ligand binding.\n\nThe publication of the cryo-EM structure of M41 (18), the first structure of a spike protein from a gammacoronavirus,\nmade it possible to visualize the distribution of the glycosylation sites in the\ntertiary structure of the protein. The study verified the site occupancy we observed\non M41\u2013RBD because 9 of 10 of the glycosylation sites in the EM structure\nwere occupied. Site Asn-246, not occupied in the EM structure, is on a\n\u03b2-strand in the EM structure, and it forms close contacts with the S1\nC-terminal domain in the native protein. The C-terminal domain was not part of our\nconstruct. Therefore, Asn-246 in the recombinant constructs was likely in an\nenvironment much different from that found in the full-length protein.\n\nMany human galectins, and also the bovine \u03b2-coronavirus spike protein (18), bind sugars at what is the top of the\n\u03b2-sandwich near site Asn-126 in the RBD constructs (see Fig. 5). The bovine RBD site Asn-198 closely aligns with site\nAsn-126 of M41 (see Fig. 7). In the bovine\nprotein, this demarks the region of proposed ligand binding. Loss of Asn-126 in the\nM41 RBD abrogates binding to trachea tissue. Although ablation of Asn-126 diminishes\nligand binding, our docking study gave no evidence that this is the sialyl\nligand-binding site in M41. Evaluation of the charge distribution in the proposed\nbinding sites indicates that the bovine site is negatively charged, whereas the\nnegative charge in the same region in M41 is sparse (Fig. 7). This difference in charge near Asn-126 may explain the lack of\nligand docking in this region (gray \u03b2-strands in Fig. 6B) during docking\nsimulations.\n\nThe precise ligand-binding region of proteins with a galectin fold varies. Rotavirus\nprotein VP4, for example, binds sialic acid in a groove between the \u03b2-sheets\nof the sandwich (20). The clustering of five\nof six required N-glycosylation sites suggests the location of the\nligand-binding site may be on the right of the galectin fold as shown in Fig. 5. Our docking experiments studying 17\npossible oligosaccharide ligands to M41 were not conclusive in terms of binding\nenergies but did identify four potential saccharide-binding regions (Fig. 6). Docking also demonstrated that\nglycosylation affects binding in silico because one potential site\n(site A; see Fig. 6) lost favor, whereas\nanother one, site D, dramatically gained favor when the protein was glycosylated.\nSite D is in the center of three glycosylated asparagines required for binding\n(Asn-59, Asn-85, and Asn-160), and one whose loss results in a very strong\nhistochemical signal and has a protein-wide effect on glycosylation with increased\nsialylation (Asn-145). In addition, the site D region is negatively charged (see\nFig. 7A) like the proposed\nsialyl ligand-binding site on the bovine protein (Fig.\n7B) (19). All the\nligands that interacted with site D were sialylated and included the glycan that\nbound in our ELISA studies. Interestingly, carbohydrate\u2013carbohydrate contacts\nwere detected in the RBD\u2013ligand interactions at site D. This is an intriguing\nresult because carbohydrate\u2013carbohydrate interactions, although not common,\nhave been reported between nonfucosylated antibodies and their receptor, in\ncell\u2013cell adhesion interactions, between tumor antigens, and between\nbacterial receptors and mucin (21\u201325). A literature search did not uncover any reported\ncarbohydrate\u2013carbohydrate interactions between virus and host. Although our\ndocking study must be evaluated in the context of the higher root mean square\ndeviations typical of EM structures, and the inexactness of modeled\noligosaccharides, results suggest that a combination of\ncarbohydrate\u2013carbohydrate and carbohydrate\u2013protein interactions should\nbe considered in the binding mechanism.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that glycosylation of six sites on the M41 IBV RBD are\nnecessary for the interaction of M41 with both trachea tissue and\nNeu5Ac(\u03b12\u20133)Gal(\u03b21\u20133)GlcNAc ligand in ELISA. Based on\noccupancy data, at least nine sites were glycosylated in the recombinant\nM41\u2013RBD. Deletion of individual glycosylation sites had little effect on\nsecondary structure, but it did have some effect on overall glycosylation profiles\nof some variants, especially N145A. Some differences can be expected because one\nsite, with specific glycans, is lost from each variant, thus mildly altering overall\nprofiles. In silico docking suggests that glycosylation may guide\nligand binding. Especially intriguing is site D, where glycosylation is required for\nin silico docking at that site. The interaction of M41 IBV with\nsialyl ligand may prove to be a unique interaction involving both carbohydrates and\nprotein. Further investigation is warranted.\n\nThe tissues used for this study were obtained from the tissue archive of the\nVeterinary Pathologic Diagnostic Center (Department of Pathobiology, Faculty of\nVeterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, The Netherlands). This archive is\ncomposed of paraffin blocks with tissues maintained for diagnostic purposes; no\npermission from the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiment is\nrequired.\n\nThe pCD5 vector containing IBV M41\u2013RBD in-frame with a C-terminal GCN4\ntrimerization motif and Strep-Tag has been described previously (10). Site-directed mutagenesis using the Q5\ntechnology (New England Biolabs) was performed to mutate the asparagine-encoding\nresidues of the N-linked glycosylation sequence motif\nNX(S/T) into alanine or valine using the primers in Table 3. Sequences of the resulting RBDs\nwere confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Macrogen, The Netherlands).\n\nHEK293T (ATCC CRL-3216) cells were transfected with pCD5 plasmids using\npolyethyleneimine at a 1:12 ratio. The recombinant proteins were purified using\nStrep-Tactin\u2013Sepharose beads, as described previously (11), and their production was confirmed by\nWestern blotting using Strep-Tactin HRP antibody (IBA, Germany).\n\nRecombinant M41 and its variants were prepared for CD spectroscopy by buffer\nexchange and concentration with four centrifugation cycles through 10-kDa MWCO\nAmicon Ultra 0.5-ml centrifugal filters (UFC 501024) into 10 mm sodium\nphosphate, pH 7.75. Final concentrations were measured with a Thermo Fisher\nScientific Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer. CD spectra were collected on a JASCO\nJ-810 spectropolarimeter with a Peltier thermostated fluorescence temperature\ncontroller module. Samples were diluted to 0.06 mg/ml and four scans accumulated\nfrom 285 to 190 nm with a scanning speed of 10 nm/min, digital integrated time\n1-s, bandwidth 1 nm, and standard sensitivity at 25 \u00b0C. A thermal melt was\ndone from 25 to 95 \u00b0C with a ramp rate of 1 \u00b0C/min. Measurements were\ntaken every 2\u00b0 at 222, 218, 215, 212, 208, 205, 196, and 194 nm. A full CD\nscan was collected at 95 \u00b0C. The temperature was then lowered to 25\n\u00b0C. After allowing the protein to refold for 20 min at 25 \u00b0C, a third\nCD scan was taken at 25 \u00b0C to measure recovery. A Savitzky-Golay filter was\nused to smooth CD data at different temperatures for visual comparison\n(Fig.\nS2).\n\nSecondary structure calculations for the CD data collected at 25 \u00b0C before\nthe thermal melt were processed by Dichroweb (16) using the CDSSTR (26),\nSelcon3 (27), and Contill (28) algorithms with protein reference set\n7. Results from the three algorithms were averaged and plotted in Fig. 2.\n\nHistochemistry was performed as described previously (11). Briefly, chicken trachea tissues from a 7-week-old\nbroiler chicken were sectioned at 4 \u03bcm before incubation with RBD proteins\nat 100 \u03bcg/ml. Desialylated tissues were prepared by pre-treatment with 2\nmilliunits of neuraminidase (sialidase) from A. ureafaciens\n(AUNA, Sigma, Germany) in 10 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mg/ml Triton\nX-100, pH 4.2, at 37 \u00b0C overnight before protein application. Chicken\ntrachea tissues were from a 7-week-old broiler chicken (G.\ngallus) obtained from the tissue archive of the Veterinary\nPathologic Diagnostic Center (Department of Pathobiology, Faculty of Veterinary\nMedicine, Utrecht University, The Netherlands).\n\nSialic acids (Neu5Ac\u03b12\u20133Gal\u03b21\u20133GlcNAc-PAA, 3-SiaLc-PAA,\nGlycoNZ, Russia) were coated (1 \u03bcg/well) in a 96-well Maxisorp plate\n(NUNC, Sigma) at 4 \u00b0C overnight, followed by blocking with 3% BSA (Sigma)\nin PBS-0, 1% Tween. RBD proteins (100 \u03bcg/ml) were preincubated with\nStrep-Tactin-HRPO (1:200) for 30 min on ice, before applying them to the plates\nfor 2 h at room temperature. 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine\nsubstrate was used as a peroxidase substrate to visualize binding, after which\nthe reaction was terminated using 2 n H2SO4.\nAbsorbances (A450 nm) were measured in a FLUOstar\nOmega (BMG Labtech) microplate reader, and MARS data analysis software was used\nfor analysis. Protein samples of each recombinant protein were measured at each\nconcentration in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by comparing\neach protein to the unmodified RBD using two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple\ncomparisons test where \u03b1 was set to 0.05.\n\nThe workflow is shown in Fig.\nS3. Aliquots between 200 and 400 \u03bcg of M41, N59A, and N145A\nand 50 \u03bcg of the remaining proteins were digested with trypsin as per An\nand Cipollo (29). Approximately\n25\u2013100-\u03bcg aliquots of protease-digested proteins were processed for\ndeglycosylated glycopeptide and permethylated glycan analyses. Samples were\nresuspended in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. Glycans were\nreleased by digestion with 10 units/\u03bcl PNGase F (glycerol-free from New\nEngland Biolabs) for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C. The samples were adjusted to pH 5.0 with\n2\u20134 \u03bcl of 125 mm HCl. To maximize glycan release, samples\nwere further digested with 0.15 milliunits/\u03bcl PNGase A overnight at 37\n\u00b0C. Free glycans and deglycosylated peptides were separated using C18 SPE\ncartridges (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Intact glycopeptide analyses were\nperformed using 175\u2013300 \u03bcg of HILIC-enriched glycopeptides as per\nAn and Cipollo (29). Following data\ncollection on the trypsinized glycopeptides, the remainder of the M41, N59A, and\nN145A samples were digested with chymotrypsin at a ratio of 1:20 overnight at 25\n\u00b0C, and HILIC was enriched a second time (for the M41 and N59A samples\nonly) prior to LC/MS analysis.\n\nLC/MSE data were collected on trypsinized peptides deglycosylated with\nPNGase F as described under N-glycan release. Asparagines that\nare deglycosylated by PNGase F are converted to aspartate with a mass gain of\n0.984 Da due to the replacement of \u2013NH2 with \u2013OH. The\npercent occupancy for each site is calculated by comparing the intensity of\npeptides with Asn to those with Asp. However, spontaneous deamidation of\nunmodified Asn to Asp can also occur. 18O-Water, which results in\nmass shift of 2.984 Da, was used to ensure calculated percent occupancy was not\nskewed due to spontaneous deamidation. This experiment allows for examination of\nboth spontaneous and enzymatically catalyzed deamidation, and therefore,\naccurate estimations of percent occupancy of glycosites can be determined.\nPercent occupancy was calculated by comparing the intensities of the\ndeglycosylated (DG) and nonglycosylated (NG) peptides using the equation: DG/(DG\n+ NG)\u00b7100.\n\nPNGase-released N-glycans were applied to C18 SPE and eluted\nwith 0.1% formic acid leaving the deglycosylated peptides bound to the C18\ncolumn. The glycan eluate fractions were combined, and butanol was added to a\nfinal concentration of 1%. The samples were then loaded onto 100-mg porous\ngraphite columns prepared first by sequential washes of 1 ml of 100%\nacetonitrile (ACN), 1 ml of 60% ACN in water, 1 ml of 30% ACN in water, and 1 ml\nof water. All solutions contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The loaded\ncolumns were washed three times with 1 ml of 0.1% TFA in water, then eluted with\n30% ACN, 0.1% TFA, water, followed by 60% ACN, 0.1% TFA, and water. The eluents\nwere pooled and dried in glass vials by rotary evaporation. Permethylation was\ndone following the method of Cincanu and Costello (30) and Cincanu and Kerek (31). MALDI-TOF analysis of permethylated N-glycans\nwas performed on a Bruker AutoflexTM speed mass spectrometer in\npositive polarity reflectron mode. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid was used as a\nmatrix, and malto-oligosaccharides were used as an external calibrant. Data were\nprocessed using FlexAnalysisTM. Each sample was spotted three times,\nand scans were collected in positive reflectron mode. Peaks were picked and\nassigned, and intensities were averaged across each set of spots using in-house\nsoftware. Assignments were based on glycans known to be present in HEK293T\ncells.\n\nEach peptide or glycopeptide sample was analyzed three times. A C18 column (BEH\nnanocolumn 100 \u03bcm inner diameter \u00d7 100 mm, 1.7-\u03bcm particle,\nWaters Corp.) was used for nanoLC/MSE analyses. A nanoAcquity UPLC\nsystem (Waters Corp.) was used for automatic sample loading and flow control.\nLoad buffer was 3% ACN, 97% water. Peptides were eluted via a 60-min gradient\nfrom 3 to 50% ACN with a flow of 0.4 \u03bcl/min. All chromatography solutions\nincluded 0.1% formic acid. The eluent flowed to an uncoated 20-\u03bcm inner\ndiameter PicoTip Emitter (New Objective Inc., Woburn, MA). The mass spectrometer\nwas a SYNAPT G2 HDMS system (Waters Corp.). Applied source voltage was 3000 V.\nData were collected in positive polarity mode using data-independent\nMSE acquisition, which consists of a starting 4-V scan followed\nby a scan ramping from 20 to 50 V in 0.9 s. To calibrate internally, every 30 s\n400 fmol/\u03bcl Glu-fibrinopeptide B with 1 pmol/\u03bcl leucine enkephalin\nin 25% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, 74.9% water was injected through the\nlockmass channel at a flow rate of 500 nl/min. Initial calibration of the mass\nspectrometer was performed in MS2 mode using Glu-fibrinopeptide B and\ntuned for a minimum resolution of 20,000 full-width at half-maximum.\n\nNanoLC/MSE data were processed using BiopharmaLynx 1.3 (Waters Corp.)\nand GLYMPS (in-house software) (32, 33) to identify specific glycans on each\npeptide. The search settings included trypsin digest with up to one missed\ncleavage, fixed cysteine carbamidomethylation, variable methionine oxidation,\nand variable N-glycan modifications based on a building block\nglycan library. Assignment inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) the presence\nof a core fragment (peptide, peptide + HexNAc, peptide + HexNAc2,\npeptide + dHex1HexNAc1, and peptide +\nHex1HexNAc2); 2) the presence of three or more peptide\nfragments; 3) the presence of three or more assigned glycopeptide fragments; 4)\nassignment is made in at least 2 of 3 injections; and 5) the existence of the\nglycan in GlyConnect (https://glyconnect.expasy.org).3\n\nResidues 21\u2013268 of the M41 spike EM structure were extracted from the\npublished structure (PDB code 6cv0) (18). This corresponds\nto the M41\u2013RBD used in this paper. Glycam-web's glycoprotein-builder\nprogram (34) was used to add the major\noligosaccharide found at each glycosylation site onto the protein in\nsilico. All glycosites in the M41 EM structure were occupied except\nAsn-246; however, Asn-246 was occupied in our data and was populated\naccordingly. All glycosites were glycosylated in the new PDB file based on best\nevidence from our MS data. The coordinates of M41\u2013RBD without glycans,\nM41\u2013RBD with modeled glycans, and bovine RBD (PDB code 4H14) were used in docking experiments. A\nvirtual library of 17 oligosaccharides representing a variety of binding\nepitopes was created based on the CFG array version 4.2 (see Fig. 6 for a list). Raw models of the\noligosaccharide ligands were created with the AMBER tool tleap (www.ambermd.org)3\nutilizing the GLYCAM06 force field (35),\nthen energy minimized using YASARA (36).\nDock screening of the library was performed with the YASARA implementation of\nAutodock Vina (37) with default\nparameters. A molecular dynamics simulation with explicit water (TP3) but with\nfixed coordinates for the backbone atoms was run on the glycosylated M41 RBD\nmodel to allow the amino acid side chains to accommodate the added glycans and\nto find low energy conformations. Two models were extracted from the\nglycosylated MD RBD run at 5 and 10 ns, which were used for dock screening with\nthe virtual library. Each oligosaccharide ligand was docked against the\nstructures 20 times. Docking results shown in Fig.\n6 are for the 10-ns model. Results were similar in the 5-ns\nmodels.\n\nL. M. P., K. M. B., R.
