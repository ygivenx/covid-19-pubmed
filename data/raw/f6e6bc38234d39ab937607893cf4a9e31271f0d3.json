{"title": "Validation of Assays to Monitor Immune Responses in the Syrian Golden Hamster (Mesocricetus auratus)", "body": "Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus; hereafter referred to as hamster) have been used in numerous studies as infection and disease models (Table 1) due to their ease of handling and disease development, which often mimics the natural course of human diseases. In particular, hamsters have been recognized as valuable animal models for studying emerging and high consequence acute human viral diseases caused by bunyaviruses (Niklasson et al., 1984; Hooper et al., 2001; Milazzo et al., 2002; Fisher et al., 2003) arenaviruses (Smee et al., 1993; Sbrana et al., 2006) , henipaviruses (Wong et al., 2003) , flaviviruses Xiao et al., 2001; Siirin et al., 2007) and SARScoronavirus (Roberts et al., 2005) . For some of these pathogens, such as Andes virus, a New World hantavirus and a causative agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, hamsters are the only lethal disease model (Hooper et al., 2001) . However, due to a lack of available reagents and specific assays to monitor host responses in hamsters, including disease-decisive acute and early innate immune responses, investigators are currently limited to studies on disease progression (clinical symptoms), humoral immune responses (antibodies) and pathology. For other disease models using rodents, nonhuman primates and ferrets, expression microarray proteome and luminex technology-based quantification assays have been developed and utilized (Kayo et al., 2001; Datson et al., 2007; Bruder et al., 2010; Ierna et al., 2010) . However, for Syrian (golden) hamsters similar specific assays are not available due to the lack of a complete genome sequence.\n\nHere, we describe the testing of a large panel of ELISA and luminex based assays for crossreactivity against hamster proteins and the development of an extended panel of real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays which was based on hamster mRNA sequences currently registered in Genbank. Due to limited crossreactivity in ELISA and luminex based assays, the development of qRT-PCR assays seemed the most practical and useful strategy to quantify specific host responses in the hamster model. A few qRT-PCR assays for the quantification of a limited number of immunological responses have been previously reported (Melby et al., 1998; Muller et al., 2001; Vernel-Pauillac and Merien, 2006) . We developed a unique extended panel of TaqMan\u00ae primer/ probe assays for 51 different genes targeting specific markers in the pro-inflammatory, antiinflammatory, innate immunity, apoptosis, cell junction and coagulation responses of the hamster. With ribosomal protein L18 we identified a more suitable and stable housekeeping gene. The assays were validated by monitoring host responses to treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and infection with vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSV), both of which are known to strongly activate host responses in the hamster (Fultz et al., 1981b; Muller et al., 2001) . The new assays will allow for a broader monitoring of host responses against infection and an advanced utilization of the hamster model.\n\nRecombinant VSV was rescued from cloned cDNA and infectivity was titered by conventional plaque forming assay, as described previously (Lawson et al., 1995; Garbutt et al., 2004) . Three groups of six hamsters (female, 4-6 weeks old Harlan Laboratories Inc, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were injected intraperitoneally (ip) with either 50 \u03bcg LPS (Sigma, St. Louis, MO USA), 10 6 plaque forming units (pfu) of VSV (both diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)), or DMEM only (control) in a total volume of 400 \u03bcL. Three of the controls and VSV infected, and six of the LPS treated hamsters were euthanized by exsanguination while under deep anesthesia (inhalational isoflurane) one day post inoculation. The remaining control and VSV inoculated hamsters were euthanized at 3 days post inoculation. Whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture into EDTA Vacutainers, after which plasma was separated by centrifugation and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. Lung, liver and spleen samples were harvested from euthanized hamsters, cut into approximately 50-100 mg pieces and submerged in 1 mL of RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day RNAlater was removed and the tissues were frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. Approximately 30 mg of the tissue samples were mechanically homogenized in RLT buffer and the RNA was extracted from the homogenate using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of the extracted RNA was determined using a NanoDrop 8000 instrument (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and adjusted to a final concentration of 10 ng/\u03bcL. All experiments were conducted under BSL2 conditions, and approval for animal experiments was obtained from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animal work was performed by certified staff in a facility approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.\n\nRat TNF\u03b1, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10, mouse CXCL10/IP-10, IL-13 and IL-1\u03b2/IL-1F2, and mouse/rat/porcine/canine TGF\u03b21 ELISA kits were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and tested according to manufacturer's instructions with individual hamster plasma (Table 2) . Individual control and VSV infected and pooled LPS hamster plasma were sent to Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA) for analysis by Milliplex\u00ae MAP Mouse (32 plex) and Rat (23 plex) Cytokine panels ( Table 2 ).\n\nOver 800 hamster mRNA sequences have been registered in Genbank. Of those, 51 target genes related to host immunological responses elicited by pathogen infections were selected. These included pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, innate immune (primarily Type I IFNrelating genes), and T-cell-mediated responses, as well as apoptosis, cell junctions and coagulation markers (Table 3) (Adler, 2008) .\n\nOf the available hamster sequences on Genbank, the following four \"housekeeping\" genes were selected as internal reference genes: Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), \u03b2-actin, \u03b2-2-microglobulin (\u03b22M) and ribosomal protein L18 (RPL18). \u03b2-actin and HPRT were chosen as these are seen as classical housekeeping genes and have been previously utilized by other researchers performing quantitative RT-PCR on hamster tissues (Melby et al., 1998) . \u03b22M and RPL18 were selected based on the work of Dheda et al. (Dheda et al., 2004) . All 4 genes were tested in qRT-PCR experiments to determine which had the most stable expression in the tissues of infected/treated and control hamsters.\n\nqRT-PCR primers and probes were either designed with the aid of Primer Express\u00ae Software v3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), or were directly designed and synthesized by TIB MOLBIOL (Adelphia, NJ, USA) based on the sequence information of target transcripts. Sequence information of primers and probes are shown in Table 3 . Prior to use in qRT-PCR assays all the primer sets were tested to ensure the primers can amplify target transcripts by conventional reverse transcriptase PCR; amplicons were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Briefly, using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and random hexamers, cDNA pools were generated according to manufacturer's instructions from RNA derived from hamster spleen, lung or liver. The cDNA was used as template for conventional PCR. All PCR reactions were carried out using Taq polymerase (Qiagen Cat. No. 201203 ) at a denaturation temperature of 95 \u00b0C for 30 sec, annealing temperature of 50 \u00b0C for 30 sec, and an extension temperature of 72 \u00b0C with an extension time of 30 sec for 40 cycles. If a band was evident at the correct size on an agarose gel, the primers were used for subsequent qRT-PCR runs. In total, 51 different primer/probe sets were validated on lung, liver and spleen tissues (Table 3) . All experimental gene probes were labeled with 5' 6FAM dye and quenched by 3' BlackBerry Quencher (BBQ), and all internal control gene probes were labeled with Yakima Yellow (Yak) and quenched by BBQ (TIB MOLBIOL).\n\nThe limit of detection and efficiency of cDNA amplification was determined by selecting a few representative cloned genes. The clones were altered to contain a T7 promoter directly upstream to the qRT-PCR forward primer binding site. Following amplification the PCR fragments were gel purified and in vitro transcribed by Riboprobe Combination System T3/ T7 RNA Polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Transcripts were DNase I digested and the RNA purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. The purified RNA was diluted from 5\u00d710 1 to 5\u00d710 \u22128 ng RNA and used as a template for qRT-PCR reactions. To determine the minimum amount of total hamster tissue RNA required for the experiments, representative genes were selected and run in a 2-fold dilution series (from 200 ng to 50 ng total RNA per reaction).\n\nTo test whether the efficiency of the primer/probe sets was suitable for direct comparison between reactions, approximately one third of the available genes were selected and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The inserts were verified by sequencing and entire plasmids were diluted in series of log 10 from 5\u00d710 1 to 5\u00d710 \u22129 ng of total DNA. Quantitative PCR and qRT-PCR were carried out on the plasmid and RNA dilution series, respectively, the crossing threshold (C T ) values plotted and efficiency determined by measuring the slope of the best fit line through the C T values. If the efficiencies were within 10% of each other the primer/probe sets were considered as being comparable (Ling et al., 2008) .\n\nAll qRT-PCR experiments were performed on the Rotor-Gene 6000 thermal cycler (Corbett, San Francisco, CA, USA) using Rotor-Gene Probe RT-PCR kits (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Each reaction was multiplexed with RPL18 as the internal reference, using 50 ng of template RNA. The final concentration of each test primer and probe set was 0.4 \u03bcM and 0.1 \u03bcM, respectively. The final concentration of the internal control primer and probe set was 0.2 \u03bcM and 0.05 \u03bcM, respectively. Cycling conditions were as follows: 10 min at 50 \u00b0C (initial reverse transcription), 5 min at 95 \u00b0C (denaturation and HotStarTaq activation), and 40 cycles of 5 sec at 95 \u00b0C (denaturation), followed by 10 sec at 60 \u00b0C per cycle (annealing/amplification). Data acquisition was carried out at the end of the annealing/amplification step in the green (510 nm) and yellow (555 nm) channels.\n\nThe data were analyzed using the \u0394\u0394CT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) . Briefly, the C T of each test gene in a treated hamster was first normalized to the RPL18 C T (\u0394CT) and then compared to the same normalized gene in a mock-treated (calibrator) hamster to determine the \u0394\u0394CT. The final value is displayed as the relative fold increase between the infected/treated and mock treated hamsters.\n\nMany important genes are highly conserved between species; therefore cross-reactivity of antibodies isolated against other rodents may detect hamster proteins. First, we compared amino acid sequence homologies of representative cytokines and chemokines between hamsters, rats, and mice. We selected target proteins showing >90% homology at the amino acid level (data not shown) and tested cross-reactivities of ELISA kits for their detection. In total 64 antibody-based (55 luminex, 8 ELISA) assays were tested for cross-reactivity with hamster proteins and only 14 were determined to display cross-reactivity (Table 2) . The mouse and rat ELISA kits tested in this study had limited cross-reactivity with hamster proteins. Of the eight ELISA kits tested, only three (mouse IL-1\u03b2, rat IL-10 and rat/mouse/ porcine/canine TGF\u03b21) displayed cross-reactivity against the hamster homologues (Fig 1A,  Table 2 top panel). Additional problems with the ELISA results are the unusually high (roughly 1000-fold higher than to be expected) levels of TGF\u03b21 detected in comparison to mice. Therefore, we concluded that the tested ELISA kits are unreliable and of limited use for monitoring proteins involved in immune responses of hamsters. Similarly, the luminex rat and mouse panel data suggests that of the 55 different proteins tested only mouse IL-13 and MIG, and rat GMCSF, IL-1\u03b1, Leptin and GRO/KC were detected with confidence in hamster plasma ( Fig 1B, Table 2 bottom panel). In addition, mouse Eotaxin, MIP-1\u03b2 and IL-12 p40 as well as rat RANTES and IL-10 showed weak cross-reactivity for hamster proteins ( Fig 1C) . All other cytokine analyses failed to show values above the limit of detection. These data suggest that, as with the ELISA kits, the tested luminex panels for rat and mouse cytokines/chemokines, with the exception of the six mentioned previously, are unreliable for the detection of immune responses in hamsters.\n\nGiven the limited cross-reactivity (Table 2 ) and high costs of mouse and/or rat ELISA and luminex based assays, qRT-PCR assays were considered and selected as the most practical detection system of choice to analyze hamster immune responses until further genome sequences become available. For this we analyzed specific hamster sequences registered on Genbank. Of the ~800 sequences available, 51 hamster specific genes involved in proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, innate immunity, apoptosis, cell junction and coagulation responses, and four constitutively expressed reference genes were selected and TaqMan based qRT-PCR assays developed (Table 3) .\n\nThe identification of a suitable reference gene was of paramount importance for the assay development. Studies focusing on human tissues previously concluded that commonly used reference genes such as HPRT and \u03b2-actin may not be suitable as internal references due to large variations in expression between tissues and in responses to stresses (Dheda et al., 2004) . Hamsters are outbred animals and therefore variability is inherent between individual animals. This makes selection of an appropriate internal reference critical (Dheda et al., 2004) . \u03b2-actin, \u03b22M, HPRT, and RPL18 were selected as potential housekeeping genes and individually evaluated for their expression levels in lung, liver and spleen tissues of treated/ infected and control hamsters (n=17 per tissue, n=51 total). Figure 2 shows the distribution of the fluorescence curves within representative tissues of infected, treated and untreated hamster tissues. \u03b22M and RPL18 vary less than HPRT and \u03b2-actin (\u03b22M standard deviation (SD) \u22641 cycle within tissues, 1.29 cycles between all samples; RPL18 SD \u22640.5 cycles within tissues, 0.87 cycles between all samples; HPRT SD \u22644.6 cycles within tissues, 3.4 cycles between all samples; \u03b2-actin SD \u22647.2 cycles within tissues, 7.5 cycles between all samples). Though previous work in hamsters has used HPRT and \u03b2-actin as reference genes (Melby et al., 1998; Muller et al., 2001; Vernel-Pauillac and Merien, 2006) , in this study these internal reference genes showed some variation between infected/treated and untreated hamsters and in comparison of different tissues (Fig 2) . The variation of \u03b22M and, especially, RPL18 was much less in all instances. Therefore we chose to use RPL18 as the most reliable internal reference gene and propose that it should be strongly considered for future work.\n\nThe average efficiency or E value of the primers was determined to be 3.112 (range 2.904-3.321, n=15,) (Fig 3A) , i.e. 3.112 cycles per log 10 dilution, when used on DNA template and 3.178 (range 2.727-3.414, n=12) (Fig 3B) , i.e. 3.178 cycles per log 10 dilution, when used on RNA template. The average r 2 values of the slopes were determined to be 0.9969 (range 0.9911-0.9996) from the DNA template ( Fig 3A) and 0.9616 (range 0.8148-0.9995) ( Fig  3B) from the RNA template. The signal generated per target template between the control and reference primer/probe sets was considered to be comparable as the efficiencies of the primer/probe sets were within 10% of the average (Ling et al., 2008) . The limit of detection for the assayed primer/probe sets was determined to be between 10 \u22126 to 10 \u22128 ng genespecific RNA which corresponds to 9-900 copies of the target RNA. The lowest amount of total RNA which could be used in these sets of experiments was determined to be 50 ng/25 \u03bcL reaction. The advantage of the approach is the sheer number of available assays and the diverse aspects of the immune system that can be analyzed, as well as the low amount of RNA necessary to perform each of the assays. Together, this allows for detailed analysis of several important genes even with lower RNA isolation yields.\n\nPrevious studies using hamsters as a sepsis model reported complete fatality within three days post inoculation of E. coli (Steinwald et al., 1999) . Hamsters used in our study developed severe \"sepsis-like\" symptoms (lethargy, ruffled fur, hunched posture, labored breathing) within one day following LPS treatment (50 \u03bcg) and were therefore euthanized and their tissues harvested. Hamster immune modulation was studied in selected tissues on day 1 post treatment (Fig 4) . The expression of pro-inflammatory genes was up-regulated with high transcript levels detected in the spleens and livers of the treated animals. Upregulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression was less pronounced in lung tissue. Antiinflammatory and immunoregulatory genes were up-regulated in all three tissues examined with liver being the strongest. The cell regulatory response was enhanced in spleen and liver tissues, but the anti-apoptotic gene expression was unaltered in all three tissues. Cell junction and integrity responses appeared to be minimally altered in the spleen, increased in the lung and nearly unaffected in the liver in response to LPS treatment and the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was strongly decreased in the three tissues examined, suggesting a lack of endothelial cell proliferation (Ferrara and Davis-Smyth, 1997) . A previous study focusing on LPS induced sepsis in the hamster model noted that liver and spleen showed higher levels of gene expression than lung and other tissues (Muller et al., 2001) . In our study here the responses to LPS inoculation were also more pronounced in liver and spleen than in lung tissue suggesting a much greater impact on these organs.\n\nHamsters are especially susceptible to VSV infection. Previous studies report that, in hamsters, as few as 10 pfu of VSV inoculated i.p. will result in uniform lethality within 72 hours (Fultz et al., 1981b; Fultz et al., 1981a) . Upon infection with VSV (10 6 pfu) proinflammatory, innate and anti-inflammatory responses were largely up-regulated in all three organs examined with some being down-regulated (Fig 5) . Down-and up-regulation were especially pronounced in liver and spleen tissue (Fig 5A and C) . Proapoptotic genes were minimally up-regulated in expression in all tissues, but anti-apoptotic gene expression was increased only in the livers of infected animals. Expression of genes encoding for cell junction proteins was generally unaffected by VSV infection in liver, increased in the lungs, and reduced in the spleen of infected hamsters. Expression of fibrinogen was increased initially followed by a substantial decrease in expression in spleen and liver in final stages of the disease. This suggests that after infection with VSV there is a deregulation of cytokine and chemokine expression, which may precede or induce coagulation abnormalities in spleen and liver tissues of hamsters. Interestingly, the opposite was found for lung tissue (Fig 5B) . VEGF expression was strongly reduced in all tissues monitored during both early and terminal stages of infection. Overall the data imply that hamsters mount more robust immune responses in the liver and spleen than in the lung during VSV infection. Previous work identified the spleen and liver as the organs displaying pathological changes during VSV infection without notable involvement of the lungs, kidney, brain or intestinal tract (Fultz et al., 1981b) . The similarities between our results and previous studies demonstrate the usefulness of our assays for more in depth evaluation of host responses to infection in an important animal model for which tools are largely lacking.\n\nMouse and rat ELISA and luminex panels tested in these studies were found to be of limited value for detecting hamster host responses. Instead, qRT-PCR assays for selected host response genes were established and validated on LPS-treated and VSV-infected hamsters. The assays allow for broad range monitoring of hamster immune and other cellular activities in host response to stress factors and the identification of RPL18 as an internal reference gene allows for accurate standardization. Thus, the developed assays will be instrumental in future applications of the hamster as a disease model until the full genome sequence is available allowing for the development of large scale RNA microarrays or deep sequencing.
