{"title": "Distinct spread of DNA and RNA viruses among mammals amid prominent role of domestic species", "body": "Pathogen spillover and cross-species transmission between animals and humans is a major 52 source of infectious diseases and a considerable global public health burden [1, 2] . 53 Understanding the factors that enable or facilitate these processes is a crucial step for such 54 events to be predicted. Host shifting, that is the colonization of a new host species by a 55 pathogen, requires a certain level of overlap in species traits ('ecological fitting') in order to 56 overcome barriers of cross-species transmission and for survival and reproduction within 57 novel host species [3] [4] [5] . In the search for mechanisms and enabling conditions that may help 58 to predict the future emergence of infectious diseases from animal populations, the necessity 59 of considering entire host species communities amongst underpinning biogeographic 60 structure and connectivity have been recently emphasized [6] [7] [8] [9] . 61 Network analyses that describe the connections of different host species in terms of 62 parasite sharing have proven useful in analysing host specificity and parasite spread [10, 11] , 63 particularly since they offer the opportunity to explore community-wide pathogen spread (the 64 distribution of a pathogen among host species, a pattern emerging from past and 65 contemporary host shifting events that connect host species as nodes in a network). Such 66 approaches may lead to increased predictability of future pandemics; for example, some 67 recent \"big data\" studies of mammal-virus associations have explored whether host traits and 68 geographic distribution can predict those species to most likely harbour undiscovered viruses 69 that may cause future pandemics [11] [12] [13] .

The challenge of assessing different 76 animal species in their role for virus spread is understandable, as detailed information about 77 virus sharing across entire communities became only recently available [12, 15] amid the 78 challenge that many virus species remain unknown [16] . 79 We address this knowledge gap by exploring the role of different mammalian species 80 in the spread of viruses through entire host communities. In particular, we tested whether proposed to likely increases their host range through more frequent host shifting and 92 adaptation to distantly related host species, whereas DNA viruses and retroviruses are 93 assumed to be more host-specific due to codivergence with their hosts over much longer to showcase possible differences in pathogen sharing, while we are aware that there are some 142 additional species that may be considered to be domestic animals. 143 We generated four different measures of sampling effort for each mammalian host species, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/421511 doi: bioRxiv preprint distribution of records among different virus species, i.e. higher overall sampling coverage 151 [24]. We generated these multiple indices as proxies of sampling intensity, as the true 152 sampling effort is not known. This is because records of species interactions in the literature 153 are arguable 'presence-only' records and rarely report the lack of interactions that would 154 reduce the number of pseudo-absences in biotic interaction data [25, 26] . The primary focus of this paper was to explore which mammalian host species might be the 193 most important for spreading viruses due to their sharing of viruses with others, and we were 194 interested in the phylogenetic and functional diversity of host species infected by different 195 virus species. We addressed these aims using three different statistical approaches, which we 196 describe in detail in the SI Appendix. In brief, we used the following statistical approaches: We used the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test to assess whether the eigenvector centrality 208 measures differed between wildlife and domestic species and among host orders. We applied 209 Dunn's test for multiple comparisons [36] . To account for sampling bias that could bias 210 centrality measures [37] , we randomly removed subsets of interaction records from the The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/421511 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nWe used the logit-link function to model variation in \uf06a(i,j ) as\n\nHere, \uf068(i) is the species-specific intercept, which is further modelled with a hierarchical The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/421511 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nHere, \u00b5order denotes the order-specific average according to the taxonomic order of species i, 250 which were modelled with a Gaussian error structure and a common 'average' hyperprior 251 mean, i.e. \u00b5order ~ \u019d(H, \u03c3 2 ).
