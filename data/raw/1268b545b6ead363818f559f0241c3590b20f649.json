{"title": "MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY Full-length genome sequencing analysis of avian infectious bronchitis virus isolate associated with nephropathogenic infection", "body": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis (IB) in chickens. It is clinically characterized by respiratory distress, tracheal rales, decreased feed intake, and poor egg quality and quantity (Cook et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012) . In 1931, Schalk and Hawn first identified the respiratory disease of chicken in America; and in 1936 the virus was identified as the causative agent of infectious bronchitis (Cook, Jackwood and Jones, 2012) .\n\nIBV is a member of the family Coronaviridea, order Nidoviridae, and belongs to Gamma-coronavirus group 3 (Gonzalez et al., 2003; Zaher and Girh, 2014) . The virus particle is enveloped, and has positive sense with single-strand RNA of approximately 27.6 Kb. The full-length genome consists of about 10 open reading frames (ORFs) (Liu et al., 2009b) .\n\nThe proximal two-thirds of the genome encode 2 overlapping ORFs 1a and 1b. The remaining one-third genome consists of 4 structural proteins, spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N) (Cavanagh, 2007; Li et al., 2013) . The S glycoprotein is cleaved into S1 and S2 sub-units. The S1 gene is involved in attachment to the host cell receptors, transferring viral genome, neutralizing, and haemagglutination inhibition of antibodies (Liu et al., 2006b; Cavanagh, 2007; Liu et al., 2008) .\n\nNew IBV isolates have been identified by diversity and evolutionary changes in the amino acids (aa) (Jia et al., 1995; Abro et al., 2012a; Hussein et al., 2014; Najafi et al., 2016; Seger et al., 2016) . In China, the first IBV isolate was identified in 1982, and several later IB outbreaks have been reported in spite of proper vaccinations (Liu et al., 2006b; Liu et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2012; Afifi et al., 2015) . Consequently, new IBV QX and LX4 genotypes have been identified (Liu et al., 2009b; Zeshan et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010b; Zou et al., 2010b; Zhou et al., 2014b) . Therefore, there is a need for surveillance of recently circulating IBV strains showing genetic, antigenic, and virulence diversity.\n\nIn this study, we reported a novel IBV strain, named CK/CH/XDC-2/2013, which was isolated from a vaccinated chicken flock. In order to test a possible relationship between genetic variation and pathogenicity in chickens, the isolate was sequenced and analyzed.\n\nThe IBV CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 strain was isolated from a chicken flock from Jiangsu province of China in 2013 by using 10-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken embryonated eggs (Nanjing Tech-Bank Bio-Industry Co. Ltd., Nanjing, China). The dead embryos had shown IBV like lesions, and their allantoic fluids were collected, titration calculated, and stored at \u221270 \u2022 C.\n\nThe viral RNA was extracted from the IBV CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 strain using RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript TM III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with oligodeoxynucleotide primers (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China). A total of 21 fragments, covering the whole genome, were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA Polymerase (Stratagene Corp., La Jolla, CA). All primers used for PCR amplification were designed based on the IBV A2 strain (GenBank accession number EU526388) shown in Table 1 . Race PCR was performed using the 5-full race kit (TaKaRa, Shuzo, Japan), adopting primers and protocol described previously (Zhao et al., 2013) . All amplified fragments were cloned into the pEASY-Blunt cloning vector (Beijing TransGen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). The full-length genome sequence of the viral strain was assembled from the acquired fragments using the Primer Premier Version 5.0 software program (Premier Biosoft International, 3786 Corina Way, Palo Alto, CA), Nucleotide Blast (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), and the ORF finder program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ gorf/gorf.html).\n\nThe full-length genome nucleotide sequence of CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 was aligned and analyzed for nucleotide homology and divergence percentage (Table 2) using the MegAlign 6 and DNASTAR software programs (Madison, WI). \n\nPhylogenetic analysis of CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 was performed using MEGA version 6 (Tamura et al., 2013) . The sequence of 46 IBV strains was downloaded from GenBank ( Table 2 ). The 25 IBV full-length genome, S gene, E gene, M gene, and N gene sequences, and 46 S1 partial genome sequence were used for phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses using the Neighbor-Joining method and Kimura-2 parameter method with bootstraps (1,000 replicates).\n\nTo assess the selective pressure on the spike gene, a codon based Morkov model of substitution was applied by using the PAML package (ver.14) (Yang et al., 2000) . The calculations were performed by using synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dNS) substitutional differ-ences among the codons to estimate the substitution rate.\n\nTo analyze the recombination events in spike glycoprotein, IBV spike gene sequences were aligned pairwise using the MegAlign program, DNASTAR software (version 6, Madison, WI). The recombination events were confirmed using the Recombination Detection Program (RDP V.3.44) (Martin and Rybicki, 2000; Posada and Crandall, 2001) , at the highest P-value as 0.05.\n\nEighty one-day-old SPF chickens of white leghorns (Nanjing Tech-Bank Bio-Industry Co. Ltd., Nanjing, China) were randomly divided into 4 groups with 20 chickens per group. Groups A, B, and C were inoculated with 100 \u03bcl allantoic fluid containing 10 3 EID 50 of IBV CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 per chicken by oral, ocular, and nasal routes, respectively. Group D was inoculated with PBS orally as a control. The animals were kept in cages and provided food and water ad libitum. The chicks were observed daily for 15 d for clinical signs, morbidity, and mortality rates. Dead chickens were examined for gross and histopathological lesions, and the lung and kidney tissues were preserved in 4% buffered formalin. These samples were routinely processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of Nanjing Agricultural University (permit number IACECNAU20130905).\n\nThe full-length genome sequence of IBV CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 strain was submitted to GenBank under accession number KM213963. The sequence was 27,714 nt in length, excluding the poly (A) tails, including: 529 nt for the 5 UTR, 11,918 nt for ORF1ab, 7,958 nt for ORF1b, 3,509 nt for the S structural gene (1,651 nt for S1 and 1,658 nt for S2), 173 nt for ORF3a, 188 nt for ORF3b, 308 nt for E gene, 677 nt for M gene, 197 nt for ORF5a, 248 nt for ORF5b, 1223 nt for the N gene, and 508 nt for the 3 UTR, while, a non-coding region of 364 nt was identified in between the M gene and ORF5a.\n\nThe genome sequence analysis of CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 showed high identities (86.6%) of the spike (S) glycoprotein (S1 = 85.7 and S2 = 91.7%) with nephropathogenic IBV BJ strains (Table 3) . All genes and 5 end and 3 end compared nucleotide similarity indices are summarized in Table 3 . The CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 strain full-length genome pair wise nucleotide similarity was closely related to BJ and A2 strains (92.2 and 91.9%, respectively). In contrast, maximum divergence (16.6 and 16.4%, respectively) was found with H52 and H120 vaccine strain ( Table 4) .\n\nThe deduced amino acid sequence of the S gene when compared with the H120, H52, and Ma5 vaccine strains showed that the new strain had an insertion of 8 aa (YSNGNSDV) from position 73 to 80 and a deletion of 3 aa at position 126 to 128 (Figure 1 ).\n\nPhylogenetic trees were constructed based on the complete genome, and of the S, S1, E, M, and N genes of IBV CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 ( Figure 2 ). This indicated that the CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 strain was closely related to the Chinese strains BJ and A2 based on the full-length genome, and S, M, and N genes. However, the phylogenetic tree of the partial S1 gene indicated that the IBV isolates were distributed into 5 clusters (Figure 2c ). CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 belongs to the second group with BJ and A2 strains. \n\nThe spike glycoprotein pairwise comparison results showed that most of the S1 sub-unit had positive codon selection of non-synonymous amino acid substitutions at specific regions encompassing positions 141 to 210, 236 to 303, 254 to 378, and 421 to 452. In contrast, most codon regions of the S2 sub-unit were highly conserved at regions 452 to 460 (Figure 3 ).\n\nThe recombination hot spots of the complete S protein gene sequence of CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 were analyzed by the recombination detection program (RDP). The results showed true recombination be-tween BJ (major parent) and KM91 (minor parent) with the break point at nucleotide position 2341 and the end point at nucleotide position 2566, using RDP, Geneconv, Chimaera, MaxChi, Bootscan, Siscan, and 3Seq analyses with average P-values of 1.040 \u00d7 10 \u221207 , 7.686 \u00d7 10 \u221206 , 3.637 \u00d7 10 \u221201 , 2.358 \u00d7 10 \u221202 , 1.070 \u00d7 10 \u221207 , 5.068 \u00d7 10 \u221206 and 1.070 \u00d7 10 \u221207 , respectively (Figure 4) .\n\nThe infected chickens showed the earliest clinical signs 2 d after inoculation, and died between 4 and 6 days. The clinical manifestations included depression, decrease in feed intake, and ruffled feather with rapid body weight loss. The morbidity and mortality were more than 75 and 60% respectively (Table 5) .\n\nAt necropsy, the chicken kidneys were prominently inflamed, and hyperemic renal tubules were distended with uric-acid crystal deposits ( Figure 5 ). Histopathologically, there was hyperemia of the nephrons, accumulation of red blood cells, necrosis, and prominent monocytes infiltration in the epithelial cells ( Figure 5 ). Meanwhile, no lesions were observed in the control group. In addition, IBV was detected in the kidneys and lungs from all infected chickens, using RT-PCR.\n\nInfectious bronchitis is the most important devastating disease of the poultry industry throughout the world. Many vaccines (W93, 28/86, H52, Ma5, and H120) are widely used, but they cannot provide complete protection against IBV infection .\n\nIn our study, we found a recombinant nephropathogenic IBV strain from an IBV-vaccinated chicken flock. The full-length genome sequence analyses of the IBV CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 isolate showed structural similarity (5 UTR-1ab+1b-S-3a+3b+E-M-5a+5b-N-3 UTR) to previously identified strains (Liu et al., 2009a; Zhang et al., 2010a) . However, a non-coding region of an approximately 364 nt was identified as reported before (Liu et al., 2009a; Abro et al., 2012b) . Phylogenetic analyses showed that the full-length genome and spike gene of CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 were closely related to the nephropathogenic IBV BJ strain, the E gene was close to the nephropathogenic GX-YL5, and the S1 gene revealed its relation to LX4 type cluster , which was circulating in more than 50% IBV strains in China (Zou et al., 2010a; Han et al., 2011) . In addition, no part of the full-length genome was similar in nucleotides identity with any available vaccines (H120, H52, Connecticut, and 4/91), indicating that CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 was relatively close to previously identified clusters of Chinese strains identified between 2000 and 2012 (Liu et al., 2009b; Zou et al., 2010a; Ji et al., 2011) . The spike glycoprotein gene always remains under pressure of mutational changes, and approximately 2 to 3% amino acid difference can decrease immune protection (Cavanagh, 2005) . In this study, the S gene nucleotide identity of the CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 isolate was more dissimilar (37 and 36.6%) than those of H120 and H52 vaccine strain, respectively. Furthermore, the spike gene had an 8 amino acid insertions at the 73 to 80 site near or within HVR1 position in the S1 gene, and a 3 amino acid deletion as compared to IBV vaccines strains.\n\nComparison of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates provides vital information related to mechanisms of DNA sequence evolution. In the present study, there was evidence for positive selection in the regions of the S1 sub-unit. In contrast, no evidence for positive selection was found in the S2 sub-unit. These selective constraints in the spike gene of IBV are in accordance with a previous report (Abro et al., 2012b) .\n\nThe recombination events mostly occur naturally or mutationally in the IBV S gene (Wang et al., 1993) . Here, the results showed that the S gene of CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 came from the recombination of the major parent BJ and minor parent KM91 strains, which suggested that more genotypic evolutionary and recombination events can occur under the pressure of widespread use of live attenuated IBV vaccines (Zhou et al., 2014a) .\n\nIBV isolates had been classified as nephropathogenic or respiratory, depending on clinical manifestations and lesions. Thus, gross and histopathological kidney lesions and mortality were used to assess nephropathogenicity (Chong and Apostolov, 1982; Ignjatovi\u0107 and Sapats, 2000; Ignjatovic et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2006a; Zaher and Girh, 2014) . In this study, the chicken challenge experiment showed high morbidity (85%) and mortality (80%) in one-day-old chickens, with similar clinical signs to field outbreak. All virus challenged chickens did not show prominent respiratory infection signs, such as sneezing, gasping, or coughing. At necropsy, there was no presence of pus or mucous clogging visually at the bronchi bifurcation region or in the trachea, as described (Grgiae et al., 2008) . The kidneys were highly inflamed and distended with uric acids deposits, indicating that this isolate had strong tropism to kidneys, as previously reported . Histopathological examination showed nephritis, necrosis, and monocytes infiltration in epithelial tissues in the kidneys, which were similar to previous reports (Benyeda et al., 2009) . This demonstrated that this new isolated IBV strain belongs to high a nephropathogenic strain emerging from circulating field IBV strains.\n\nThe new IBV CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 isolate demonstrated characteristic features of nephropathogenic IBV in chickens. At necropsy, the chicken kidneys were prominently hyperemic, inflamed, and distended with uric-acid crystal deposits. The nucleotide sequence of the isolate showed recombination, insertions, and deletions in the spike gene, and apparent genetic variations in the ORFs regions of the genome.\n\nThis work was supported mainly by the National Natural Science Foundation (31230071), grants from the Ministry of Education, China (20120097110043), and the priority academic program development of Jiangsu higher education institutions (PAPD).
