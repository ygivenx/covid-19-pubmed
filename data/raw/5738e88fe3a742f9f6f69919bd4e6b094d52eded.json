{"title": "Complete List of Authors Promoting Postgraduate year-1 (PGY 1 ) residents' ACGME six core competencies using a structured clinical teachers' training program: one 2-year study", "body": "The outbreak of the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in 2003 exposed serious deficiencies in Taiwan's health care and medical education systems. 1 The Department of Health (DOH), Executive Yuan therefore focused effort on implementation of the \"Project of Reforming Taiwan's Medical Care and Public\n\nHealthcare System\" which includes strategies and methods for improving resident education and the quality of medical care. A project entitled the \"Postgraduate General Medical Training Program\" was further announced by the DOH in August 2003. In this project, each PGY 1 resident is required to complete a six-month training program before entering his or her subspecialist courses. 2 In 2006, Taiwan Association of Medical Education helped many teaching hospitals to establish \"General Medical Training Demonstration Centers\" as a means of improving medical education of clinical teachers, residents, and medical students. Additionally, the DOH arranged to extend the current six-month postgraduate general medicine training program to a one-year program, in which all PGY 1 residents receive one year of holistic health care-centered training. 3 After 2009, the DOH added a \"Training Program for Clinical Instructors\" to the \"General Medical Training\" program to prepare the clinical instructors needed to train more than 1300 PGY 1 residents every year in one-year PGY 1 programs. 5 6 The goal of the Training Program for Clinical Instructors is to help teaching hospitals implementing the \"General Medical Training Demonstration Center\" program to train clinical instructors who have the ability to teach ACGME core competencies, including medical knowledge, interpersonal and communication skills, system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and patient care for PGY 1 residents (http: //www.acgme.org). 7 Taipei Veterans General Hospital (VGH) is a regional medical center providing primary and tertiary care to active-duty and retired military personnel and their dependents, and is the primary teaching hospital for its general medicine residency program.\n\nOur hospital has continuously received economic support from the DOH for the General Medicine Training Demonstration Center program since 2006. Over the past few years we have deployed teaching resources and training programs at VGH for the sake of establishing a patient-centered health care system. 8 Since 2009, Taipei VGH has aggressively implemented a \"Clinical Instructor Competencies\" training program and sought to boost the skills of clinical teachers teaching competencies to PGY 1 residents.\n\nThis study employs data collected from the questionnaires given to all participants in this training program, and in it we seek to evaluate the efficiency of the 5 \"ACGME Competencies Training Program for Clinical Teachers\" Moreover, we explore the contributions of the different activities of this program to instilling ACGME competency teaching abilities in participants. Finally, we assessed the degree of application of the abilities learned from this program by participants. 8 and demonstrate their instructional skills at the one-hour EBM meetings.\n\nThe OSCE consisted of 15 minutes at each of 12 competency-based stations, and was held once every mouth. The OSCE had neither a written component nor technical skills stations, but was entirely performance-based. PGY 1 residents were scored using detailed checklists tailored to the content of each station. The items on the OSCE checklists were developed from the core competencies defined during three hours of OSCE instruction. Lecturers, arrangements, and OSCE data analysis were provided by the hospital's OSCE committee. All participants observed and practiced serving as monthly PGY 1 OSCE raters during the second hour. Finally, clinical teachers (participants) reviewed the PGY 1 OSCE videos and discussed problems concerning OSCE application with members of the OSCE committee during the third hour of the OSCE instruction.\n\nMini-CEX demonstrations were provided four times every month by lecturers from the General Medicine Training Demonstration Center. Mini-CEX items included medical interviewing, physical examination and counseling skills, humanistic qualities/professionalism, clinical judgment, and organizational efficiency. After lecturers first demonstrated core competency-based evaluation of medical student mini-CEX, participants then practiced evaluating medical student mini-CEX by watching videos. Participants finally discussed problems in competency-based mini-CEX with lecturers. 9 short video clips were produced for each patient, and demonstrated the application of competencies. The average length of these clips was two minutes. The first clip usually consisted of competency-based medical consultations demonstrated by a trained physician. Subsequent clips usually consisted of the patient's physical examination and follow-up medical consultations focusing on the discussion of investigation results and treatment options. When videos are used in the \"competencies teaching skills\" tutorials, no written information was given to the participants. In other words, the only materials presented to the clinical teachers were the video clips.\n\nAn anonymous 38-item questionnaire evaluating the effectiveness of the competency teaching skills training course was designed by the program directors and approved by the VGH educational committee (Tables 2-1 and 2-2). The questionnaire was pilot tested with physicians, who were asked if any of the questions were confusing or misleading. 11 The final questionnaire was adjusted to reflect feedback from the pilot session. Before respondents answered the questionnaire, we provided written definitions of the six competencies to participants.\n\nIn the first part of questionnaire, a five-item Likert scale was used to rate the degree of respondents' agreement with the teaching skills provided by different activities in the competency training program for clinical teachers. 9 In the second part, respondents were asked to indicate which of the corresponding six areas were learned in each of the structured activities of the training courses. Recognizing that the language of the competencies is rather general, we encouraged participants to use their judgment when deciding whether a particular teaching activity provided training in one or more area ( Table 2 ). The questionnaires were filled out after participants completed the basic 40-hour training course, training workshops, and video instruction. To assess the degree of application of skills learned from different activities, respondents were asked to fill out a follow-up questionnaire three months after completion the training course. In the questionnaires, participants were requested to rate the frequency of their application of competencies using a five-point scale [1: always (100% of their teaching time), 2: frequently (75-100% of their teaching time), 3 : often (50-75% of their teaching time), 4: occasionally (25-50% of their teaching time), 5: rarely (0-25% of their teaching time)].\n\nThe average application of and attitudes toward competency instructional skills were analyzed by two t tests of sample students. Differences in the application of activity-orientated instructional skills, attitudes, familiarity and teaching ability between different groups were analyzed by ANOVA. The effectiveness of the training follow-up familiarity and teaching ability of participants were analyzed with paired t-tests, and the p-values of trends were also calculated. Furthermore, the effect of previous training and teaching experiences on the average application of competencies in teaching PGY 1 residents was analyzed using the Chi-square test.\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Taipei Veteran General Hospital and complied with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinski Guidelines. In agreement with these standards, written informed consent was obtained from each participant. \n\nA total of 117 clinical teachers (physicians) completed the full \"competency training program for clinical teachers,\" and a total of 110 participants responded to the post-course and follow-up questionnaires. It can be seen from Table 1 . The average degree of application of competency instructional skills was markedly higher for participants from internal medicine than for participants from other specialties. Interestingly, the degree of application of skills learned from training showed a significant decrease with years as an attending physician (Table 1 , P value for trend: 0.0028). In other words, the application of competency teaching skills was negatively correlated with the years as an attending physician.\n\nIn addition, the degree of application of competency instructional skills was significantly higher in participants with previous experience of being a PGY 1 clinical teachers than those without such previous experience. However, there were no differences in the degree of application of skills learned from training attributable to gender, presence or absence of PGY 1 mentors, or TAME course experience (Table 1) .\n\nAverage degree of application of skills learnt from activities of training program in participant , s teaching. It can be seen from Table 3 that the clinical teachers reported that always (100% of teaching times) used teaching skills were mainly learned from itinerant bedside teaching demonstrations; frequently (75-100% of teaching times) used skills were mainly learned from circuit bedside teaching demonstration; often (50-75% of teaching times) used skills were mainly learned from the post-course video watching; occasionally (25-50% of teaching times) used skills were mainly learned from mini-CEX teaching demonstrations; and rarely (<25% of teaching times) used skills were mainly learned from OSCE teaching demonstrations. After addition of the percentages of always, frequently, and often applied instructional skills, it was found that the most (>80% teaching times) commonly used skills were chiefly learned from itinerant and circuit bedside teaching demonstrations, post-course workshop and video watching . Teaching skills connected with medical knowledge domain were mainly (47\u00b15%) learned from OPD teaching demonstrations (Table 4) . Teaching skills connected with interpersonal and communication abilities were chiefly (60\u00b12%) learned from circuit bedside teaching demonstrations. system-based practice and problem-based learning and improvement , teaching skills were chiefly (29 \u00b12% and 49 \u00b111%) learned from CbD teaching demonstrations. Professionalism , teaching skills were mainly (42\u00b112%) learned from itinerant bedside teaching demonstrations. Patient care , teaching skills were mainly (48\u00b19%) learned from mini-CEX demonstrations. On the whole, participants learned the most competency instructional skills from OPD and CbD teaching, and post-course workshops of \"how to teach competencies\".\n\nIt can be seen from Figure 1 that the training workshops effectively improved the participants , attitude regard to agreement with the aspects of \"should be learned,\" \"should be taught,\" and \"should be evaluated.\" However, attitudes concerning \"meeting social expectations\" of competencies were not changed by post-course workshops.\n\nEffects of post-course workshop and video watching on the participant , s familiarity to ACGME competencies Figure 2A shows that both training workshops and video watching significantly improved familiarity with teaching and the definitions of competencies among participants. In addition, the post-course video instruction also significantly improved familiarity with assessment of competencies. Furthermore, familiarity with teaching and assessment of competencies improved progressively with completion of the 40-hour basic training course, post-course training workshops, and video watching. Figure 2B suggests that most of the participants were familiar with instructional skills in the areas of patient care, interpersonal and communication skills, and medical knowledge after the 40-hour basic training course. Conversely, participants were still not very familiar with the instruction in system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, and professionalism areas. Notably, familiarity with SBP, PBLI, and P competencies improved progressively with the completion of post-course training workshops and video watching. Figure 3A suggests that both post-course workshops and video watching significantly improved the participants' ability to teach, assess, and improve the PGY 1 residents , competencies. Moreover, the ability to teach PGY 1 residents , ACGME competencies was improved progressively with the completion of the 40-hour basic training course, post-course training workshops, and video watching.\n\nFurthermore, post-course workshops and video watching significantly improved the participants' ability to train PGY 1 residents' system-based practice (SBP), problem-based learning and improvement, and professionalism domains (Fig. 3B) .\n\nNevertheless, the post-course workshops and video watching did not significantly improve the participants' ability to teach PGY 1 residents participants' medical knowledge and patient care competencies.\n\nPercent change from baseline on the degree of participant , s application (> 50% of teaching times) of skills learnt from activities in the follow-up questionnaire.\n\nThe frequency of application of skills learned from itinerant and circuit bedside, PE teaching demonstration, post-course workshops and video watching of \"how to teach competencies\" increased significantly on the follow-up questionnaire ( Figure 4 ). \n\nThis study observed that degree of the application of instructional skills learned from the competencies training program was did differ between male and female participants. Clinical teachers with specialties other than surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, or emergency medicine had degrees of application of competency instructional skills similar to those of participants from the foregoing specialties.\n\nAfter completion of the 40-hour basic training course, most of participants agreed (Likelart scale > 3) that they should teach and evaluate the PGY 1 residents' competencies. However, participants did not agree strongly that they should learn ACGME competencies. This is probably due to the fact that clinical teachers considered that the ACGME competencies taught in our program did not meet social expectations very well. 12, 13 In addition, most participants agreed that they were particularly familiar with the assessment of domains of patient care, interpersonal and communication skills, and medical knowledge after the 40-hour training program. Taken together, the training program mainly improved the attitudes, familiarity and training abilities in the three domains. In other words, participants did not acquire the instructional skills in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning, and improvement, and professionalism very well after 40-hour basal training course. It can be seen from Table 4 that the participants' familiarity on teaching and assessment of PGY 1 residents' system-based practice (SBP) and problem-based learning and improvement (BPLI) domains was mainly improved by CbD teaching demonstrations. Further, clinical teacher' familiarity to teach and assess PGY 1 residents' professionalism domain was chiefly improved by itinerant bedside teaching demonstrations. Accordingly, the program directors in the General Medicine Training Demonstration Center should consider extending the essential hours of CbD and itinerant bedside teaching demonstrations. This change might improve the effectiveness the program to train participants' instructional skills in SBP, PBLI, and professionalism domains. 14 On the other hand, we also observed that clinical teacher' familiarity and teaching ability on PGY 1 residents' SBP and PBLI domains were improved significantly after post-course training workshops and video watching of \"how to teach competencies\" (Fig 2 and 3) . However, training workshops and video watching did not effectively improve participants' teaching ability in professionalism domain.\n\nThese observations also suggested that future post-course training workshops and video watching should emphasize on training of teaching ability of participants' on the domain of professionalism. 15 In comparison with post-course training workshops, video watching further increased the participants' familiarity with teaching and assessment skills in the 15 domains of SBP, PBLI, and professionalism. Previous studies had suggested that video watching consistently enhances trainees' observational powers, improves their ability to integrate different information, and motivates them to learn. 6 16 17 18 Another strategy is therefore to make up for the lack of training in the domains of SBP, PBLI, and professionalism by increasing the hours of post-course video watching in the future. Table 3 shows that participants chiefly learned instructional skills through circuit bedsides, PE, itinerant teaching demonstrations, post-course workshop and video watching of \"how to teach competencies\". Moreover, the increase in frequency of competency instructional skills application was mainly attributable to itinerant and circuit bedsides, PE teaching demonstrations, post-course workshop and video watching. Conversely, the participants rarely used instructional skills learned from CbD teaching concerning teaching and assessment skills in the domains of SBP and PBLI. The lack of application of CbD instructional skills might have been caused by the low familiarity with CbD instructional skills after completion of the program. This study had several limitations. First, the questionnaire used to track and assess the effectiveness of the training program may have had information and recall bias. The effectiveness of training should therefore be assessed immediately after each individual teaching activity demonstration by persons other than the program directors. 8 In addition, this study had a small sample size and did not contain a control group. There are as yet no controlled educational trials on this subject. 16 Finally, this study had a short follow-up period. As a result, the study's findings may represent only short-term changes in attitude, familiarity, and teaching skills. 10 Despite these limitations, the present study confirmed the effectiveness of the Competency Training Program for Clinical Teachers designed and organized by the VGH educational committee. To date, there are no well-established standards that specifically address the competency teaching and assessment skills of clinical teachers. 4\n\nThis study provides a possible framework for constructing an effective training program for clinical teachers. Although these preliminary findings require replication, the results of this study suggest that adding training workshops and video watching to Competency Training Program for Clinical Teachers may increase familiarity with and promote maturation of competency teaching and assessment skills. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47 o n l y 21 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46 \n\nRarely(1) Occasionally (2) Often (3) Frequently (4) Always (5) -outpatient department (OPD) teaching demonstration 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47 o n l y 23 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41 \n\nIn order to train PGY 1 residents, we should help PGY 1 clinical teachers to become familiar with the teaching and assessment that form the ACGME six core-competencies.\n\nOur study used questionnaires based analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the training activities of our faculty development program, which is aimed at the teaching and assessment skills of PGY 1 clinical teachers for six core-competencies.\n\nThe 40-hour basic training course effectively improved the attitudes, familiarity and training abilities of participants in the domains of patient care, interpersonal and communication skills, and medical knowledge. Post-course training camp and video watching further enhanced the familiarity and teaching ability of clinical teachers in the domains of system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, and professionalism. Data from questionnaires after finishing the basal 40-hour training course, the post-course training camp and video watching and 3-month follow-up suggested that the degree of the application of teaching skills learnt from different activities had increased progressively.\n\nThis study finds that a competency-based faculty development program can effectively establish training and instructional skills among clinical teachers, ensuring that PGY 1 residents , competencies are taught effectively. This study was limited by the fact that questionnaire used to track and assess the effectiveness of the training program may have had information and recall bias. In addition, this study had a small sample size and did not contain a control group. There are as yet no controlled educational trials on this subject. \n\nThe outbreak of the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in 2003 exposed serious deficiencies in Taiwan's health care and medical education systems. 1 The Department of Health (DOH), Executive Yuan therefore focused effort on implementating \"Project of Reforming Taiwan's Medical Care and Public Healthcare System\", which includes strategies and methods for improving resident education and the quality of medical care. A project entitled the \"Postgraduate General Medical Training Program\" was further announced by the DOH in August 2003. In this project, each PGY 1 resident is required to complete a six-month training program before entering his or her subspecialist courses. 2 In 2006, Taiwan Association of Medical Education helped many teaching hospitals to establish \"General Medical Training Demonstration Centers\" as a means of improving medical education of clinical teachers, residents, and medical students. Additionally, the DOH arranged to extend the current six-month postgraduate general medicine training program to a one-year program, in which all PGY 1 residents receive one year of holistic health care-centered training. 3 After 2009, the DOH added a \"Training Program for Clinical Instructors\" to the \"General Medical Training\" program to help prepare the clinical instructors needed to train more than 1300 PGY 1 residents every year during the one-year PGY 1 programs. 5 6 The goal of the Training Program for Clinical Instructors is to help teaching hospitals implementing the \"General Medical Training Demonstration Center\" program to train clinical instructors such that they have the ability to teach to PGY 1 residents the ACGME core competencies, including medical knowledge, interpersonal and communication skills, system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and patient care (http: //www.acgme.org). 7 Taipei Veterans General Hospital (VGH) is a regional medical center providing primary and tertiary care to active-duty and retired military personnel and their dependents, and is the primary teaching hospital for its general medicine residency program.\n\nOur hospital has continuously received economic support from the DOH for the General Medicine Training Demonstration Center program since 2006. Over the past few years we have deployed teaching resources and faculty development programs at VGH to help establish a patient-centered health care system. 8 Since 2009, Taipei VGH has aggressively implemented a \"Clinical Instructor Competencies\" faculty development program and sought to boost the skills of clinical teachers teaching competencies that target PGY 1 residents; the aim is to establish an excellent patient center medical system. This study employs data collected from the questionnaires given to all \n\nThis study involved 134 clinical teachers (physicians) in ten specialties at Taipei\n\nVeterans General hospital and other cooperative hospitals between January 2009 and January 2011. All clinical teachers participated in the training course voluntarily.\n\nThe program consisted of two parts. These were a training course for ACGME competency teaching abilities, and the post-course training camp and general medicine video watching for clinical teachers. Accordingly to the rules of Taiwan Association of Medical Education (TAME), the Competency Training Program for Clinical Teachers must be implemented at a qualified \"General Medicine Teaching Demonstration Center\" and requires at least five days (40 hours) of training. The course can be implemented intermittently or continuously over period of three months. The content of the training course must include the activities requested by TAME. 1. Outpatient department (OPD) teaching demonstration 2. Itinerant bedside teaching demonstration 3. Physical examination (PE) teaching demonstration 4. Circuit bedside teaching demonstration 5. Case-based discussion (CbD) teaching demonstration 6. Evidence-based medical (EBM) teaching demonstration 7. Objective structural clinical examination (OSCE) teaching demonstration 8. Mini-clinical evaluation exercise (min-CEX) teaching demonstration 9. Training camp on \"how to teach ACGME competencies?\" 10. Video watching on \"how to teach ACGME competencies?\"\n\nOverall, the design of the content of faculty development program by TAME was based on the coherent educational theory proposed by Hewson et al. 10 It has been suggested that the program should include video watching, mini-lecture, group discussions, demonstrations, role plays, and simulated teaching experiences in order to promote a change in the attitudes, values, beliefs and assumptions about teaching of 10 Accordingly, Taiwan Association of Medical Education (TAME) announced that the faculty development program consisted of two parts, namely the ACGME competencies-based 40-hour basic clinical practice training course and post-course training camp with or without video watching. In general, the second part of training course is designed to re-enforce the efficiency of faculty development program. The post-course training camp for clinical teachers was held under the monitor of TAME. The lectures at training camp emphasized teaching skills related to the competencies and lasted at least 7 hours. The aims of training camp and video watching were to teach in issues associated with and allow discussion of the ACGME competence-related teaching and assessment skills. At the same time as the training courses, we design portfolios for all participants to allow then to record and certify their training courses. Finally, TAME certificated their teaching ability with respect to ACGME competencies according to the records within the portfolios. 11\n\nThe application of competencies in OPD teaching was demonstrated by a senior professor who is a member of the VGH educational committee. OPD teaching skill demonstration and practice opportunities were provided once every week. During the three hours of OPD teaching, the participants observed a demonstration of OPD teaching skills during the first hour, and then practiced these instructional skills and discussed problems concerning OPD teaching with senior professors over the following two hours.\n\nItinerant bedside teaching was provided three times every week by different senior professors. Core competency-based teaching skills including clinical reasoning, communication, problem-solving, knowledge application ability, diagnostic test and medical literature interpretation ability, and synthesis of information were taught by senior professors. All participants had chances to demonstrate and practice the teaching skills learned in the 2.5-hours of itinerant bedside teaching. \n\nCircuit bedside teaching was demonstrated five times every week by different trained lecturers. The lectures conveyed teaching skills concerning the application of core competencies during routine bedside runs. Demonstration and practice of \n\nSenior professors and trained lectures also hosted CbD meetings five times each\n\nweek. Core competency-related CbD teaching skills were demonstrated for one hour every morning. All participants were invited to actively participate in these meetings.\n\nCore competency-related EBM meetings were hosted by trained lecturers from the educational committee once every week. During the first week of each month, a lecture was given to PGY 1 residents and participants, and PGY 1 residents presented the application of EBM skills in solving difficult clinical problems presented by their patients starting during the second week. Participants were invited to comment and demonstrate their instructional skills at the one-hour EBM meetings.\n\nThe OSCE consisted of 15 minutes at each of 12 competency-based stations, and was held once every mouth. The OSCE had neither a written component nor technical skills stations, but was entirely performance-based. PGY 1 residents were scored using detailed checklists tailored to the content of each station. The items on the OSCE checklists were developed from the core competencies defined during three hours of OSCE instruction. Lecturers, arrangements, and OSCE data analysis were provided by the hospital's OSCE committee. All participants observed and practiced serving as monthly PGY 1 OSCE raters during the second hour. Finally, clinical teachers (participants) reviewed the PGY 1 OSCE videos and discussed problems concerning OSCE application with members of the OSCE committee during the third hour of OSCE instruction.\n\nMini-CEX demonstrations were provided four times every month by lecturers from the General Medicine Training Demonstration Center. Mini-CEX items included medical interviewing, physical examination and counseling skills, humanistic qualities/professionalism, clinical judgment, and organizational efficiency. After lecturers first demonstrated core competency-based evaluation of medical student mini-CEX, participants then practiced evaluating medical student mini-CEX by watching videos. Participants finally discussed problems associated with competency-based mini-CEX with lecturers.\n\n(B):The contents of the training camp on \"how to teach ACGME competencies?\" This training camp was held once every two months by the VGH educational committee. Lecturers gave 45 minutes of instruction on teaching skills in each of six 9 competencies, and discussed teaching problems with all participants during the last 15 minutes of each session. After seven lecture/ discussion sessions, participants were invited to share their teaching and competency application experiences during the last hour. The organizers also tried to establish a consensus concerning an adequate methodology for competencies evaluation and teaching of PGY 1 residents. Finally, all participants were asked to fill out questionnaires in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the training course as a whole.\n\n(C): The contents of the video watching on \"how to teach ACGME competencies?\"\n\nThe VGH educational committee has produced videos of actual and simulated patients for use in \"competency instructional skills\" tutorials. The video-based tutorials were provided by General Medicine Training Demonstration Center. Patients consented to the filming, which was done by a professional audio visual team in actual clinical settings, including outpatient clinics and hospital wards. Three to four short video clips were produced for each patient, and demonstrated the application of competencies. The average length of these clips was two minutes. The first clip usually consisted of competency-based medical consultations demonstrated by a trained physician. Subsequent clips usually consisted of the patient's physical examination and follow-up medical consultations focusing on the discussion of investigation results and treatment options. When videos are used in the \"competencies teaching skills\" tutorials, no written information was given to the participants. In other words, the only materials presented to the clinical teachers were the video clips.\n\nAn anonymous 38-item questionnaire evaluating the effectiveness of the competency teaching skills training course was designed by the program directors and approved by the VGH educational committee (Tables 2-1 and 2-2) . Evaluation approaches including objectives-oriented, expertise-oriented, management-oriented, and participant-oriented aspects of the training program have been described previously. 11 In our study, the Kirkpatrick theory based-questionnaires was to evaluate the effectiveness of our training program. Kirkpatrick has described four levels of training program outcomes that may be assessed. This first level is a measure of participants, initial reaction to the program. The second level is to assess the amount of knowledge and skill that participants learned, while the third level evaluates the amount of knowledge and skills learned that participants actually use in everyday work. The fourth level is an evaluation of the impact of the program on the institution and society. It has been suggested that educational institutions should develop an 10 institution-specific evaluation model to meet their particular needs including educational processes and outcomes. Therefore, although we chose Kirkpatrick , s four level model as a guide for the evaluation, we adapted it to suit our needs. We interpreted the levels to be:\n\nLevel 1-reaction, an evaluation of participants , initial attitude and familiarity with the ACGME competencies, and ability to train ACGME competencies, which is target of our program. These questions are provided in supplement table 2-1. The final questionnaire was adjusted to reflect feedback from the pilot session. To estimation the reliability of our questionnaires, Cronback's alpha coefficient was calculated and our questionnaires found to have a reliability of 0.81. Additionally, the re-evaluation reliability of our questionnaires was around 0.85.\n\nBefore respondents answered wach questionnaire, we provided written definitions of the six competencies to participants. In the first part of questionnaire, a five-item Likert scale was used to rate the degree of respondents' agreement with the teaching skills provided by different activities in the competency training program for clinical teachers. 9 In the second part, respondents were asked to indicate which of the corresponding six areas were learned in each of the structured activities of the training courses. Recognizing that the language of the competencies is rather general, we encouraged participants to use their judgment when deciding whether a particular teaching activity provided training in one or more area ( Table 2 ). The questionnaires were filled out after participants completed the basic 40-hour training course, training 11 camp, and video watching. To assess the degree of application of skills learned from different activities, respondents were asked to fill out a follow-up questionnaire three months after completion the training course. All the activities in our program were divided into three parts, namely teaching activities, evaluation activities, and post-course training camp/video watching ( Table 2- \n\nThe average application of and attitudes toward competency instructional skills were analyzed using paired t tests. Differences in the application of activity-orientated instructional skills, attitudes, familiarity and teaching ability between different groups were analyzed by ANOVA. The degree of changes in the participants , attitude and familiarity to teach and train ACGME competence after 40-hour basic training course, post-course training camp and video watching were analyzed using paired t-tests and the p-values of trends. Furthermore, the effect of previous training (years as an attending physician and whether the participant had taken the TAME course) and teaching experiences (being a PGY 1 clinical teacher or mentor) on the average degree of application of competencies in teaching was analyzed using the Chi-square test.\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Taipei Veteran General Hospital and complied with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinski Guidelines. In agreement with these standards, written informed consent was obtained from each participant. \n\nAmong the original 134 clinical teachers, 17 clinical teachers were not included in the study because they did not complete all aspects of the training and additional 7 clinical teachers did not complete the questionnaire; this yielded a final total of 110 study subjects. It can be seen from Table 1 Table 1 showed that 42% and 66% of the clinical teacher in our study had experience of being PGY 1 mentor and clinical teacher, respectively. The average degree of application of competency instructional skills was markedly higher for participants from internal medicine than for participants from other specialties.\n\nInterestingly, the degree of application of skills learned from training showed a significant decrease as the individual , s years as an attending physician (Table 1 , p value for trend: 0.0028). In other words, the application of competency teaching skills was negatively correlated with how many years the person had been an attending physician.\n\nIn addition, the degree of application of competency instructional skills was significantly higher in participants with previous experience of being PGY1 clinical teachers than those without such previous experience. However, there were no differences in the degree of application of skills learned from training attributable to gender, presence or absence of PGY 1 mentors, or TAME course experience (Table 1) .\n\nAverage degree of application of skills learnt from activities of faculty development program in participant , s teaching. In Table 3 , a comparison between teaching activities showed that clinical teachers reported that the always (100% of teaching times) used skills were mainly learned from itinerant bedside teaching demonstrations, while the frequently (75-100% of teaching times) used skills were mainly learned from circuit bedside teaching demonstration. Only rarely (<25% of teaching times) were skills were mainly learned from PE teaching demonstrations. On the other hand, a comparison between evaluation activities revealed that clinical teachers reported that the always (100% of teaching times) and frequently (75-100% of teaching times) used skills were mainly learned from CbD evaluation demonstrations, while rarely (<25% of teaching times) used skills were mainly learned from OSCE evaluation demonstration. After addition of the percentages of always, frequently, and often applied instructional skills, it was 13 found that the most (>80% teaching times) commonly used skills were chiefly learned from itinerant teaching demonstration, circuit bedside teaching demonstration and mini-CEX evaluation demonstration.\n\nIn teaching activities, teaching skills involving medical knowledge and system-based practice domains were mainly learned from OPD teaching demonstrations, while teaching skills involving interpersonal and communication skills domain was mainly learned from circuit bedside teaching demonstrations.\n\nFurthermore, teaching skills involving practice-based learning and improvement domain were mainly learned from EBM teaching demonstrations and teaching skills involving professionalism domain were mainly learned from itinerant bedside teaching demonstrations. Finally, teaching skills involving patient care domain were mainly learned from PE teaching demonstrations (Table 4) .\n\nWhen evaluation activities were examined, evaluation skills involving interpersonal and communication skills and patient care domains were mainly learned from mini-CEX demonstrations, while evaluation skills involving system-based practice and practice-based learning and improvement domains were mainly learned from CbD evaluation demonstrations. In addition, the evaluation skills involving professionalism domain were mainly learned from OSCE evaluation demonstrations.\n\nIt can be seen from Figure 1 that the training camp effectively improved the participants , attitude in respect of agreement with the aspects of \"should be learned,\" \"should be taught,\" and \"should be evaluated.\" However, attitudes concerning \"meeting social expectations\" of competencies were not changed by post-course training camp.\n\n, s familiarity to ACGME competencies Figure 2A shows that both training camp and video watching significantly improved familiarity with teaching and definitions of competencies among participants. In addition, the post-course video watching also significantly improved familiarity with assessment of competencies. Furthermore, familiarity with teaching and assessment of competencies improved progressively as the 40-hour basic training course, post-course training camp, and video watching were completed. Figure 2B suggests that most of the participants were familiar with instructional skills in the areas of patient care, interpersonal and communication skills, and medical knowledge (Likerts , scale >3.5) after the 40-hour basic training course. However, participants were still not very familiar with the instruction in system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, and professionalism domains. Notably, familiarity with system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, and professionalism competencies improved progressively as the post-course training camp and video watching.\n\nEffects of post-course training camp and video watching on the participant , s training abilities with respect to ACGME competencies Figure 3A suggests that both post-course training camp and video watching significantly improved the participants' ability to teach, assess, and improve the PGY 1 residents , competencies. Moreover, the ability to teach PGY 1 residents , ACGME competencies was improved progressively as the 40-hour basic training course, post-course training camp, and video watching.\n\nFurthermore, post-course training camp and video watching significantly improved the participants' ability to train PGY 1 residents' system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement, and professionalism domains (Fig. 3B) . Nevertheless, the post-course training camp and video watching did not significantly improve the participants' ability to teach PGY 1 residents' medical knowledge and patient care competencies.\n\nPercent change from baseline in the degree of participant , s application (> 50% of teaching times) of skills learnt from activities in the follow-up questionnaire.\n\nIn terms of teaching activities, the frequency of application of skills learned from itinerant bedside teaching increased the most based on the results of the follow-up questionnaire ( Figure 4 ). Among the evaluation activities, the frequency of application of skills learned from CbD evaluation demonstration was increased the most on the follow-up questionnaire ( Figure 4) . Finally, the degree of the improvement in the application frequency of skills learnt from post-course training camp and video watching were similar. \n\nIn term of participants, this study observed that degree of the application of instructional skills learned from the competencies faculty development program did differ between male and female participants. Clinical teachers with specialties other than surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, or emergency medicine had degrees of application of competency instructional skills similar to those of participants from the above specialties.\n\nAfter completion of the 40-hour basic training course, most of participants agreed (Likelart scale > 3) that they should teach and assess the PGY 1 residents' competencies. However, participants did not agree strongly that they should learn ACGME competencies. This is probably due to the fact that clinical teachers considered that the ACGME competencies taught in our program did not meet social expectations very well. 13, 14 In addition, most participants agreed that they were particularly familiar with assessment in the domains of patient care, interpersonal and communication skills, and medical knowledge after the 40-hour training program. Taken together, the training program mainly improved the attitudes, familiarity and training abilities in the three domains. In other words, participants did not acquire better instructional skills in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning, and improvement, and professionalism domains to a significant degree after 40-hour basal training course.\n\nOn the other hand, we also observed that clinical teacher' familiarity and teaching ability in the PGY 1 residents' system-based practice, problem-based learning, and improvement, and professionalism domains were improved significantly after post-course training camp and video watching (Fig 2B and 3B ). [15] [16] Accordingly, the program directors in the General Medicine Training Demonstration Center should consider extending the hours allocated to itinerant bedside teaching demonstration, CbD evaluation demonstration, post-course training camp and video watching. These changes are likely to improve the effectiveness the program in term of participants' instructional skills in system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement, and professionalism domains. 15 When compared with post-course training camp, video watching further increased the participants' familiarity with teaching and assessment skills in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement, and professionalism. Previous studies had suggested that video watching consistently enhances trainees' observational powers, improves their ability to integrate different information, and motivates them to learn. 6 17 18 19 Another strategy is therefore to make up for the lack of training in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement, and professionalism by increasing the hours of post-course 16 video watching in the future. Table 3 shows that participants chiefly learned instructional skills through circuit bedsides, PE, itinerant teaching demonstrations, post-course training camp and video watching. Moreover, the participants also response in the follow-up (3-months) questionnaires that the most skills that they applied in teaching had been mainly leant from itinerant and circuit bedsides, PE teaching demonstrations, post-course training camp and video watching. Conversely, the participants rarely used instructional skills learned from CbD evaluation demonstration. At the same time, our study suggested that CbD evaluation demonstration mainly establishes teaching and assessment skills in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement.\n\nThe lack of application of CbD instructional skills might have been resulted from the low familiarity with CbD instructional skills after completion of the program. Thus, the program directors should consider extending the hours of CbD evaluation demonstration in future.\n\nThis study had several limitations. Firstly, the questionnaire used to track and assess the effectiveness of the faculty development program may suffer from information and recall bias. The effectiveness of training should therefore be assessed immediately after each individual teaching activity demonstration by persons other than the program directors. 8 After finishing the program, our study did not assess the degree of the improvement of participants , teaching skills by PGY 1 residents. Furthermore, a self-reported questionnaire might not reflect behaviors in authentic setting. Secondly, we only assessed levels 1 to 3 of Kirkpatrick of our program. In other words, we did not evaluate of the basal attitude and familiarity with ACGME six core competencies of participants in the beginning of faculty development program. In order to validate our program, basal assessment of participants is needed in the future.\n\nThirdly, according to the \"original\" definition, Kirkpatrick , s third level evaluates \"the amount of knowledge and skills learned that participants actually use in everyday work\". In our study, we modified the third level to be the \"degree of participants , application of skills leant from different teaching and training activities\". Furthermore, in order to effectively validate the results of our faculty development program, a clear definition of the desirable teacher , s behaviors needs be given to participants in future works. The behaviors perhaps should include: create an appropriate learning climate; be learner-centered; facilitate participants, learning; encourage self-awareness through reflection; tailor teaching to participants , needs and wants, etc. suggested by Hewson et al. 10 Additionally, it is well-established that when one goes through an evaluation process, the evaluation process becomes more difficult and time-consuming as one moves from Kirkpatrick level 1 to level 4, 17 although higher level provides information that is of increasingly significant value than lower level. Thus, the level 4 needs to be assessed in the future for our program. 11 Tit should be noted that, as yet, no controlled educational trials on this subject have been published and this type of trail would be useful. 17 Finally, this study involved only a short follow-up period and a result, the study's findings may represent only short-term changes in attitude, familiarity, and teaching skills. 11 Despite these limitations, the present study confirms the effectiveness of \"the faculty development program about competency for clinical teachers\" designed and organized by the VGH educational committee. To date, there are no well-established standards that specifically address the competency teaching and assessment skills of clinical teachers. 4\n\nThis study provides a possible framework for constructing an effective training program for clinical teachers. Although these preliminary findings require replication, the results of this study suggest that adding training camp and video watching to Competency faculty development Program for Clinical Teachers may increase familiarity with and promote maturation of competency teaching and assessment skills.

In addition, this study had a small sample size and did not contain a control group. There are as yet no controlled educational trials on this subject. \n\nThe outbreak of the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in 2003 exposed serious deficiencies in Taiwan's health care and medical education systems. 1 A project entitled the \"Postgraduate General Medical Training Program\" was announced by the Department of Health (DOH), Executive Yuan in August 2003. In this project, each PGY 1 resident is required to complete a six-month of holistic health care-centered training program before entering his or her subspecialist courses. 2 In 2006, Taiwan Association of Medical Education (TAME) helped many teaching hospitals to establish \"General Medical Training Demonstration Centers\" as means of improving medical education of clinical instructors, residents, and medical students. Additionally, the DOH arranged to extend the current six-month postgraduate general medicine training program to a one-year program. 3 After 2009, the DOH added a \"Training Program for Clinical Instructors\" to the \"General Medical Training\" program to help prepare the clinical instructors needed to train more than 1300 PGY 1 residents every year during the one-year PGY 1 programs. 5 6 The goal of the program is to help clinical instructors such that they have the ability to teach to PGY 1 residents the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies, including medical knowledge, interpersonal and communication skills, system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and patient care (http: //www.acgme.org). 7 Taipei Veterans General Hospital (VGH) is a regional medical center providing primary and tertiary care to active-duty and retired military personnel and their dependents, and is the primary teaching hospital for its general medicine residency program.\n\nOur hospital has continuously received economic support from the DOH for the \"General Medicine Training Demonstration Center Program\" since 2006. Over the past few years we have deployed teaching resources and faculty development programs at Taipei VGH to help establish a patient-centered health care system. 8 Since 2009, Taipei VGH has aggressively implemented a \"Clinical Instructor Competencies\" faculty development program and sought to boost the skills of clinical instructors teaching competencies that target PGY 1 residents.\n\nThis study employs data collected from the self-reported questionnaires given to all participants in this faculty development program, and in it we seek to evaluate the participants , feeling about the value of the various training sessions. Moreover, we explored the contributions of the different activities of this program in instilling ACGME competency teaching abilities in participants. Finally, we assessed the degree to which the abilities learned within this program by participants are applied. \n\nThe system for early year's postgraduate training of doctor is similar to American model, which was developed by the ACGME. The early year's postgraduate training of doctor is regulated by DOH, Executive Yuan of Taiwan ROC.\n\nThe expectations of the early year's postgraduate training of doctor are that residents are competent in the six-core competencies.\n\nThis study involved 134 clinical instructors (physicians) in ten specialties at Taipei VGH and other cooperative hospitals between January 2009 and January 2011.\n\nAll clinical instructors participated in the training course voluntarily.\n\nOverall, the design of the content of faculty development program by TAME was based on the coherent educational theory proposed by Hewson et al. 10 It has been suggested that the program should include videotapes, mini-lecture, group discussions, demonstrations, role plays, and simulated teaching experiences in order to promote a change in the attitudes, values, beliefs and assumptions about teaching of clinical instructors. 10 Accordingly, TAME announced that the faculty development program consisted of two parts, namely the ACGME competencies-based 40-hour basic clinical practice training course and post-course training workshop and videotapes. In general, the second part of training course is designed to re-enforce the efficiency of faculty development program. The post-course training workshop for clinical instructors was held under the monitor of TAME. The lectures at training workshop emphasized teaching skills related to the competencies and lasted at least 7 hours. The aims of training workshop and videotapes were to teach in issues associated with and allow discussion of the ACGME competence-related teaching and assessment skills. At the same time, we design portfolios for all participants to allow them to record and certify their training courses. Finally, TAME certificated their teaching ability according to the records within the portfolios. 11 The course can be implemented intermittently or continuously over period of three months. All participants had chances to demonstrate and practice the teaching and evaluation skills learned in the course. \n\nThe application of competencies in OPD teaching was demonstrated once every week by a senior professor who is a member of the VGH educational committee. In the first hour, senior professor demonstrated the teaching skills of seeing the patients, talking to families, interviewing and physical examination. In the second hour, PGY 1 residents visited a real patient independently, made a short case presentation and completed the charts writing. In the last hour, senior professor demonstrated the teaching skills to determine care plan, administrative details and charges, review the sign, orders and write notes on the charts of PGY 1 resident.\n\nItinerant bedside teaching was provided three times every week by different senior professors whose are not the physician that in charge of the patients that discussed.\n\nIn the first 0.5 hour, PGY 1 residents did a case presentation in the consulting room and discuss clinical reasoning, communication, and problem-solving skills with senior professor and other clinical instructors. With the agreement of patient, the bedside teaching team visited the patients to confirm the physical signs, make a provisional diagnosis and decides on the best diagnostic and therapeutic options in the following 1 hour. Finally, the bedside teaching team returned to the consulting room and discussed the knowledge application ability, diagnostic test and medical literature interpretation ability, and synthesis of information skills in the last hour.\n\nCircuit bedside teaching was demonstrated five times every week. Circuit bedside teaching involved a medical team including medical students, interns, PGY 1 residents and in-charge physician who's continuously taking care of the patients that they want to discuss. Circuit bedside teaching was done in the routine ward rounds. Before visiting the patients, in-charge physicians demonstrated the teaching skills of history taking, physical examination and communication abilities in first 0.5 hour. The medical team and participants demonstrated and practiced the teaching skills of evidence-based medicine and self-directed learning ability in the following 1-hour of ward runs. Finally, the teaching skills of administrative time management and record keeping abilities were demonstrated and practiced by all participants. residents visiting real patients to verify the special physical signs reported by PGY 1 residents. In the last 0.5-hour, all participants discussed the meaning and significance of physical findings elicited by members of PE teaching team. Senior professors and trained lectures also hosted CbD meetings five times each\n\nweek. CbD mainly assess the clinical reasoning and decision making abilities of PGY 1 residents. The detail aspects of evaluation including medical record keeping, clinical assessment, investigation and referrals, treatment, follow-up and future planning, professionalism, and overall clinical judgment abilities of PGY 1 residents. In the first 0.5-hour, the PGY 1 residents performed a case presentation to show their above abilities. Then, senior professor, trained lectures and clinical instructors discussed and rewarded directly to PGY 1 residents about their performance in the last 0.5-hour.\n\nCore competency-related 1-hour EBM meetings were hosted by trained lecturers once every week. During the first week of each month, a lecture was given to PGY 1 residents and participants. In the second and third week, PGY 1 residents presented the application of EBM skills in solving difficult clinical problems presented by their patients in weekly EBM meeting. In the EBM meeting of last week, participants were invited to comment and demonstrate their instructional skills in the EBM meetings.\n\nThe OSCE consisted of 15 minutes at each of 12 competency-based stations, and was held once every month by the hospital's OSCE committee as our previous report. 12 All participants observed and practiced serving as monthly PGY 1 OSCE raters during the first two hours. Finally, participants reviewed the PGY 1 OSCE videos and discussed problems concerning OSCE application with members of the OSCE committee in the third hour of OSCE instruction.\n\nMini-CEX demonstrations were provided four times every month by trained lecturers as our previous report. 13 After brief lecturers concerning about the core competency-based mini-CEX evaluation in 0.5-hour. Trained lecturers and participants then practiced and discussed in evaluating PGY 1 residents mini-CEX by watching videos in the 0.5-hour.\n\nThis training workshop was held once every two months. Lecturers gave 45 minutes of instruction on teaching skills in each of six competencies, and discussed teaching problems with all participants during the last 15 minutes of each session. After seven lecture/ discussion sessions, participants were invited to share their teaching and competency application experiences during the last hour. The organizers also tried to establish a consensus concerning an adequate methodology for \n\nThe Taipei VGH educational committee has produced videos of actual and simulated patients for use in \"competency instructional skills\" tutorials. The video-based tutorials were provided by General Medicine Training Demonstration Center. Patients consented to the filming, which was done by a professional audio visual team in actual clinical settings, including outpatient clinics and hospital wards. Three to four short video clips were produced for each patient, and demonstrated the application of competencies. The average length of these clips was two minutes. The first clip usually consisted of competency-based medical consultations demonstrated by a trained physician. Subsequent clips usually consisted of the patient's physical examination and follow-up medical consultations focusing on the discussion of investigation results and treatment options. When videos are used in the \"competencies teaching skills\" tutorials, no written information was given to the participants. In other words, the only materials presented to the clinical instructors were the video clips.\n\nEvaluation approaches including objectives, expertise, management, and participant-oriented aspects of the training program. 11 In our study, an anonymous 38-item questionnaire Kirkpatrick theory-based participant-oriented questionnaire was designed to evaluate the clinical instructors , perception of our training program (Tables 2-1 and 2-2). Kirkpatrick has described four levels of training program outcomes that may be assessed. 14 This first level is a measure of participants, initial reaction to the program. The second level is to assess the amount of knowledge and skill that participants learned, while the third level evaluates the amount of knowledge and skills learned that participants actually use in everyday work. The fourth level is an evaluation of the impact of the program on the institution and society. It has been suggested that educational institutions should develop an institution-specific evaluation model to meet their particular needs including educational processes and outcomes. Therefore, although we chose Kirkpatrick , s four level models as a guide for the evaluation, we adapted it to suit our needs. We interpreted the levels to be:\n\nLevel 1-reaction, an evaluation of participants , initial attitude and familiarity with the ACGME competencies, and ability to train ACGME competencies, which is target of our program. These questions are provided in supplement table 2-1. Before respondents answered each questionnaire, we provided written definitions of the six competencies to participants. In the first part of questionnaire, a five-item Likert scale was used to rate the degree of respondents' agreement with the teaching skills provided by different activities in the competency training program for clinical instructors. 9 In the second part, respondents were asked to indicate which of the corresponding six areas were learned in each of the structured activities of the training courses. Recognizing that the language of the competencies is rather general, we encouraged participants to use their judgment when deciding whether a particular teaching activity provided training in one or more area ( Table 2 ). The questionnaires were filled out after participants completed the basic 40-hour training course, training workshop, and videotapes. To assess the degree of application of skills learned from different activities, participants were asked to fill out a follow-up questionnaire three months after completion the training course. All the activities in our program were \n\nThe average application of and attitudes toward competency instructional skills were analyzed using paired t tests. Differences in the application of activity-orientated instructional skills, attitudes, familiarity and teaching ability between different groups were analyzed by ANOVA. The degree of changes in the participants , attitude and familiarity to teach and train ACGME competence after 40-hour basic training course, post-course training workshop and videotapes were analyzed using paired t-tests and the p-values of trends. Furthermore, the effect of previous training (years as an attending physician and whether the participant had taken the TAME course) and teaching experiences (being a PGY 1 clinical instructors or mentor) on the average degree of application of competencies in teaching was analyzed using the Chi-square test.\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Taipei Veteran General Hospital and complied with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinski Guidelines. In agreement with these standards, written informed consent was obtained from each participant. \n\nAmong the original 134 clinical instructors, 17 clinical instructors were not included in the study because they did not complete all aspects of the training and additional 7 clinical instructors did not complete the questionnaire; this yielded a final total of 110 study subjects. It can be seen from Table 1 Table 1 showed that 42% and 66% of the clinical instructors in our study had experience of being PGY 1 mentor and clinical instructors, respectively. The average degree of application of competency instructional skills was markedly higher for participants from internal medicine than for participants from other specialties. Interestingly, the degree of application of skills learned from training showed a significant decrease as the individual , s years as an attending physician ( Table 1 , p value for trend: 0.0028). In other words, the application of competency teaching skills was negatively correlated with how many years the person had been an attending physician.\n\nIn addition, the degree of application of competency instructional skills was significantly higher in participants with previous experience of being PGY 1 clinical instructors than those without such previous experience. However, there were no differences in the degree of application of skills learned from training attributable to gender, presence or absence of PGY 1 mentors, or TAME course experience (Table 1) .\n\nAverage degree of application of skills learnt from activities of faculty development program in participant , s teaching. In Table 3 , a comparison between teaching activities showed that clinical instructors reported that the always (100% of teaching times) used skills were mainly learned from itinerant bedside teaching demonstrations, while the frequently (75-100% of teaching times) used skills were learned from circuit bedside teaching demonstration. Rarely (<25% of teaching times) used skills were learned from PE teaching demonstrations. In the evaluation activities, clinical instructors reported that the always (100% of teaching times) and frequently (75-100% of teaching times) used skills were learned from CbD evaluation demonstrations, while rarely (<25% of teaching times) used skills were learned from OSCE evaluation demonstration. After addition of the percentages of always, frequently, and often applied instructional skills, it was found that the most (>80% teaching times) commonly used skills were learned \n\nIn teaching activities, participants reported that skills involving medical knowledge and system-based practice domains were mainly learned from OPD teaching demonstrations, while skills involving interpersonal and communication skills domain was learned from circuit bedside teaching demonstrations. Furthermore, skills involving practice-based learning and improvement domain were learned from EBM teaching demonstrations and skills involving professionalism domain were learned from itinerant bedside teaching demonstrations. Finally, skills involving patient care domain were learned from PE teaching demonstrations (Table 4 ).\n\nIn term of evaluation activities, participants reported that skills involving interpersonal and communication skills and patient care domains were mainly learned from mini-CEX demonstrations, while skills involving system-based practice and practice-based learning and improvement domains were learned from CbD evaluation demonstrations. In addition, the skills involving professionalism domain were learned from OSCE evaluation demonstrations.\n\nParticipants reported that post-course training workshop effectively improved their agreement with the aspects of \"should be learned,\" \"should be taught,\" and \"should be evaluated.\" (Fig. 1) . However, attitudes concerning \"meeting social expectations\" of competencies were not changed by post-course training workshop.\n\nParticipants reported that both training workshop and videotapes significantly improved their familiarity with teaching and definitions of competencies among participants ( Fig. 2A) . In addition, the post-course training videotapes also significantly improved participants , familiarity with assessment of competencies. Furthermore, participants felt that their familiarity with teaching and assessment of competencies improved progressively as the 40-hour basic training course, post-course training workshop, and videotapes were completed.\n\nParticipants reported that most of them were familiar with instructional skills in the domains of patient care, interpersonal and communication skills, and medical (Fig. 2B) . However, participants felt that they were still not very familiar with the instruction in system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, and professionalism domains. Notably, participants felt that they were familiar with system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, and professionalism competencies progressively after finishing post-course training workshop and videotapes. 15, 16 Effects of post-course training workshop and videotapes on the participant , s training abilities with respect to ACGME competencies\n\nAfter finishing 40-hour basic training course, post-course training workshop and videotapes, participants felt that their ability to teach, assess, and improve the PGY 1 residents , ACGME competencies were improved progressively (Fig. 3A) . Furthermore, participants felt that post-course training workshop and videotapes significantly improved their ability to train PGY 1 residents' system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement, and professionalism domains (Fig. 3B) . Nevertheless, participants reported that post-course training workshop and videotapes did not further change their ability to teach PGY 1 residents' medical knowledge and patient care competencies.\n\nPercent change from baseline in the degree of participant , s application (> 50% of teaching times) of skills learnt from activities in the follow-up questionnaire.\n\nIn terms of teaching activities, participants reported in the follow-up questionnaire that the highest degree of improvement in the application frequency of skills were learned from itinerant bedside teaching (Fig. 4) . Among the evaluation activities, participants reported that highest degree of improvement in the application frequency of skills were learned from CbD evaluation demonstration. Finally, participants reported that the degree of improvement in the application frequency of skills learnt from post-course training workshop and videotapes were similar. \n\nAfter completion of the 40-hour basic training course, participants did not agree strongly that they should learn ACGME competencies. This is probably due to the fact that clinical instructors considered that the ACGME competencies taught in our program did not meet social expectations very well. 5, 16 In addition, participants felt that they did not acquire better instructional skills in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning, and improvement, and professionalism domains to a significant degree after 40-hour basal training course. Nonetheless, participants felt that the post-course training workshop and videotapes (Fig 2B and 3B ) significantly improved their familiarity and teaching ability in the PGY 1 residents' system-based practice, problem-based learning, and improvement, and professionalism domains. 17, 18 Accordingly, our program directors should consider extending the hours of activity including itinerant bedside teaching and CbD evaluation demonstration that mainly trained the participants' instructional skills of above three domians. 17 Clinical instructors felt that both post-course training workshop and videotapes markedly improved their familiarity and instructional skills of above three domains. Previous studies had suggested that training videotapes consistently enhances trainees' observational powers, improves their ability to integrate different information, and motivates them to learn. 6 19 20 21 It is probably that our program director should increase the hours of post-course training workshop and videotapes session to improve training in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement, and professionalism in the future. Alternatively, program director can also eliminate the training sessions such as PE teaching and OSCE evaluation demonstrations that were not prefer by participants and spend more time on those training methods preferred by participants.\n\nIn addition, the participants also response in the follow-up (3-months) questionnaires that the most skills that they applied in teaching had been mainly leant from itinerant and circuit bedsides, and PE teaching demonstrations, post-course training workshop and videotapes (Table 3) . Conversely, participants answered that they rarely used instructional skills learned from CbD evaluation demonstration. At the same time, our study suggested that CbD evaluation demonstration mainly establishes teaching and assessment skills in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement. The lack of application of CbD instructional skills might have been resulted from participants , low familiarity with CbD instructional skills after completion of the program. Thus, the program directors should also consider extending the hours of CbD evaluation demonstration in future.\n\nThis study had several limitations. Firstly, the questionnaire used to track and assess the participants , perception of the faculty development program may suffer Thirdly, according to the \"original\" definition, Kirkpatrick , s third level evaluates \"the amount of knowledge and skills learned that participants actually use in everyday work\". In our study, we modified the third level to be the \"self-reported degree of participants , application of skills leant from different teaching and training activities\". Furthermore, in order to effectively validate the results of our faculty development program, a clear definition of the desirable teacher , s behaviors needs be given to participants in future works. The behaviors perhaps should include: create an appropriate learning climate; be learner-centered; facilitate participants, learning; encourage self-awareness through reflection; tailor teaching to participants , needs and wants, etc. suggested by Hewson et al. 10 Additionally, it is well-established that when one goes through an evaluation process, the evaluation process becomes more difficult and time-consuming as one moves from Kirkpatrick level 1 to level 4, although higher level provides information that is of increasingly significant value than lower level. Thus, the level 4 needs to be assessed in the future for our program. 11, 14 It should be noted that, as yet, no controlled educational trials on this subject have been published and this type of trail would be useful. 19 Finally, this study involved only a short follow-up period and a result, the study's findings may represent only short-term changes in attitude, familiarity, and teaching skills. 11 Despite these limitations, the present study provide a survey about the participants , perception of the various training sessions of our \"faculty development program about competency for clinical instructors\" designed and organized by the Taipei VGH educational committee. To date, there are no well-established standards that specifically address the competency teaching and assessment skills of clinical instructors. 4\n\nThe participants of our \"faculty development program of ACGME competencies 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47 o n l y 23 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46 6.

In addition, this study had a relatively small sample size and did not contain a control group. However, no controlled educational trials on this subject have been published as yet. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Training\" program to help prepare the clinical instructors needed to train the more than 1300 PGY 1 residents every year during the one-year PGY 1 programs. 5 Taipei Veterans General Hospital (VGH) is a regional medical center that provides primary and tertiary care to active-duty and retired military personnel and their dependents, and is the primary teaching hospital for its general medicine residency program.\n\nOur hospital has continuously received economic support from the DOH for the \"General Medicine Training Demonstration Center Program\" since 2006. Over the past few years we have deployed teaching resources and faculty development programs at Taipei VGH to help establish a patient-centered health care system. 8 Since 2009, Taipei VGH has aggressively implemented a \"Clinical Instructor Competencies\" faculty development program and sought to boost the skills of clinical instructors teaching competencies that target PGY 1 residents.\n\nThis study employs data collected from the self-reported questionnaires given to all participants in this faculty development program, and in it we have sought to evaluate the participants , feeling about the value of the various training sessions. Moreover, we have explored the contributions of the different activities of this program to instilling ACGME competency teaching abilities in the participants.\n\nFinally, we have assessed the degree to which the abilities learned within this program by participants are applied. At the same time, we design portfolios for all participants to allow them to record and certify their training courses. Finally, TAME certificated their teaching ability according to the records within the portfolios. 11 The course can be implemented intermittently or continuously over period of three months. All participants had chances to demonstrate and practice the teaching and evaluation skills learned in the course.\n\n(A): First part: 40-hour basal training course\n\nThe application of competencies in OPD teaching was demonstrated once every week by a senior professor who is a member of the VGH educational committee.\n\nIn the first hour, senior professor demonstrated the teaching skills of seeing the patients, talking to families, interviewing and physical examination. In the second hour, PGY 1 residents visited a real patient independently, made a short case presentation and completed the charts writing. In the last hour, a senior professor demonstrated the teaching skills needed to create a care plan, how to carry out appropriate administrative activities and needs and how to review the signs, orders and written notes placed on a chart by a PGY 1 resident.\n\nItinerant bedside teaching was provided three times every week by different senior professors whose are not the physician that in charge of the patients that discussed.\n\nIn the first 0.5 hour, PGY 1 residents did a case presentation in the consulting room and discuss clinical reasoning, communication, and problem-solving skills with senior professor and other clinical instructors. With the agreement of patient, the bedside teaching team visited the patients to confirm the physical signs, make a provisional diagnosis and decides on the best diagnostic and therapeutic options in the following 1 hour. Finally, over the last hour, the bedside teaching team returned to the consulting room and discussed how to apply the knowledge gained including diagnostic test results together with the ability to interpret medical literature as well as the synthesis of information skills in the last hour. \n\nSenior professors and trained lectures also hosted CbD meetings five times each\n\nweek. CbD mainly assess the clinical reasoning and decision making abilities of PGY 1 residents. The detail aspects of evaluation including medical record keeping, clinical assessment, investigation and referrals, treatment, follow-up and future planning, professionalism, and overall clinical judgment abilities of PGY 1 residents. In the first half hour, the PGY 1 residents performed a case presentation to show their abilities. Next, the senior professors, trained lectures and clinical instructors discussed and interacted directly with the PGY 1 residents about their performance over the last half hour.\n\nOne hour EBM meetings to train core competency were hosted by trained lecturers once every week. During the first week of each month, a lecture was given to PGY 1 residents and participants. In the second and third week, PGY 1 residents presented the application of EBM skills in solving difficult clinical problems presented by their patients in weekly EBM meeting. In the EBM meeting of last week, participants were invited to comment and demonstrate their instructional skills with respect to EBM meetings.\n\nThe OSCE consisted of 15 minutes at each of 12 competency-based stations, and was held once every month by the hospital's OSCE committee as our previous report. 12 All participants observed and practiced serving as monthly PGY 1 OSCE raters during the first two hours. Finally, participants reviewed the PGY 1 OSCE videos and discussed problems concerning OSCE application with members of the OSCE committee in the third hour of OSCE instruction.\n\nMini-CEX demonstrations were provided four times every month by trained lecturers as our previous report. 13 In the first half hour there were brief lecturers on core competency-based mini-CEX evaluation. Over the next half hour, trained lecturers and participants then practiced and discussed evaluating PGY 1 residents\uf0a2 mini-CEX by watching videos. After seven lecture/ discussion sessions, participants were invited to share their teaching and competency application experiences during the last hour. The organizers also tried to establish a consensus concerning an adequate methodology for competencies evaluation and teaching of PGY 1 residents. Finally, all participants were asked to fill out questionnaires in order to evaluate their perception of the training course as a whole.\n\nThe Taipei level models as a guide for the evaluation, we adapted it to suit our needs. We interpreted the levels to be:\n\nLevel 1-reaction, an evaluation of participants , initial attitude and familiarity with the ACGME competencies, and ability to train ACGME competencies, which is target of our program. These questions are included in supplement table 2-1. Before respondents answered each questionnaire, we provided written definitions of the six competencies to participants. In the first part of questionnaire, a five-item Likert scale was used to rate the degree of respondents' agreement with the teaching skills provided by different activities in the competency training program for clinical instructors. 9 In the second part, respondents were asked to indicate which of the corresponding six areas were learned in each of the structured activities of the training courses. Recognizing that the language of the competencies is rather general, we encouraged participants to use their judgment when deciding whether a particular 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 10 teaching activity provided training in one or more area ( Table 2 ). The questionnaires were filled out after participants completed the basic 40-hour training course, after the training workshop, and after the videotape session. To assess the degree of application of skills learned from different activities, participants were asked to fill out a follow-up questionnaire three months after completion the training course. All the activities in our program were divided into three parts, namely teaching activities, evaluation activities, and post-course training workshop/video session ( Table 2-2) .\n\nThe average application of and attitudes toward competency instructional skills were analyzed using paired t tests. Differences in the application of activity-orientated instructional skills, attitudes, familiarity and teaching ability between different groups were analyzed by ANOVA. The degree of changes in the participants , attitude and familiarity to teach and train ACGME competence after 40-hour basic training course, post-course training workshop and videotapes were analyzed using paired t-tests and the p-values of trends. Furthermore, the effect of previous training (years as an attending physician and whether the participant had taken the TAME course) and teaching experiences (being a PGY 1 clinical instructors or mentor) on the average degree of application of competencies in teaching was analyzed using the Chi-square test.\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Taipei Veteran General\n\nHospital and complied with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki Guidelines.\n\nIn agreement with these standards, written informed consent was obtained from each participant. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 It can be seen from Table 1 Table 1 shows that 42% and 66% of the clinical instructors in our study had experience of being a PGY 1 mentor or a clinical instructor, respectively. The average degree of application of competency instructional skills was markedly higher for participants from internal medicine than for participants from other specialties. Interestingly, the degree of application of skills learned from training showed a significant decrease as the individual , s years as an attending physician (Table 1 , p value for trend: 0.0028). In other words, the application of competency teaching skills was negatively correlated with how many years the person had been an attending physician.\n\nIn addition, the degree of application of competency instructional skills was significantly higher in participants with previous experience of being PGY 1 clinical instructors than those without such previous experience. However, there were no differences in the degree of application of skills learned from training attributable to gender, having experience as a PGY 1 mentor, or having TAME course experience 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 (Table 1) .\n\nAverage degree of application of skills learnt from activities of faculty development program in participant , s teaching. In Table 3 , a comparison between teaching activities showed that clinical instructors reported that the always (100% of teaching times) used skills were mainly learned from itinerant bedside teaching demonstrations, while the frequently (75-100% of teaching times) used skills were learned from circuit bedside teaching demonstration. Rarely (<25% of teaching times) used skills were learned from PE teaching demonstrations. In the evaluation activities, clinical instructors reported that the always (100% of teaching times) and frequently (75-100% of teaching times) used skills were learned from CbD evaluation demonstrations, while rarely (<25% of teaching times) used skills were learned from OSCE evaluation demonstration. After addition of the percentages of always, frequently, and often applied instructional skills, it was found that the most (\uf03e80% teaching times) commonly used skills were learned from itinerant teaching, circuit bedside teaching and mini-CEX evaluation demonstration.\n\nIn teaching activities, participants reported that skills involving medical 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   13 their agreement with the aspects of \"should be learned,\" \"should be taught,\" and \"should be evaluated.\" (Fig. 1) . However, attitudes concerning \"meeting social expectations\" of competencies were not changed by post-course training workshop. (Fig. 2B) . However, participants felt that they were still not very familiar with the instruction in system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, and professionalism domains. Notably, participants felt that they were familiar with system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, and professionalism competencies progressively after finishing post-course training workshop and videotape session. 15, 16 Effects of post-course training workshop and videotapes on the participant , s training abilities with respect to ACGME competencies After finishing 40-hour basic training course, post-course training workshop and videotapes, participants felt that their ability to teach, assess, and improve the PGY 1 residents , ACGME competencies were improved progressively (Fig. 3A) . Furthermore, participants felt that post-course training workshop and videotapes significantly improved their ability to train PGY 1 residents' system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement, and professionalism domains (Fig. 3B) .\n\nNevertheless, participants reported that post-course training workshop and videotapes did not further change their ability to teach PGY 1 residents' medical knowledge and patient care competencies.\n\nPercent change from baseline in the degree of participant , s application (> 50% of teaching times) of skills learnt from activities in the follow-up questionnaire.\n\nIn terms of teaching activities, participants reported in the follow-up questionnaire that the highest degree of improvement in the application frequency of 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\nAfter completion of the 40-hour basic training course, participants did not agree strongly that they should learn ACGME competencies. This is probably due to the fact that clinical instructors considered that the ACGME competencies taught in our program did not meet social expectations very well. 5, 16 In addition, participants felt that they did not acquire better instructional skills in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning, and improvement, and professionalism domains to a significant degree after 40-hour basal training course. Nonetheless, participants felt that the post-course training workshop and videotapes (Fig 2B and 3B ) significantly improved their familiarity and teaching ability in the PGY 1 residents' system-based practice, problem-based learning, and improvement, and professionalism domains. 17, 18 Accordingly, our program directors should consider extending the hours of activity including itinerant bedside teaching and CbD evaluation demonstration that mainly trained the participants' instructional skills of above three domians. 17 Clinical instructors felt that both post-course training workshop and videotapes markedly improved their familiarity and instructional skills of above three domains.\n\nPrevious studies had suggested that training videotapes consistently enhances trainees' observational powers, improves their ability to integrate different information, and motivates them to learn. 6 19 20 21 It is probably that our program director should increase the hours of post-course training workshop and videotapes session to improve training in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement, and professionalism in the future. Alternatively, program director can also eliminate the training sessions such as PE teaching and OSCE evaluation demonstrations that were not prefer by participants and spend more time on those training methods preferred by participants.\n\nIn addition, the participants also response in the follow-up (3-months) questionnaires that the most skills that they applied in teaching had been mainly leant from itinerant and circuit bedsides, and PE teaching demonstrations, post-course training workshop and videotapes (Table 3) . Conversely, participants answered that they rarely used instructional skills learned from CbD evaluation demonstration.

In other words, the evaluation of participants , perception to training should therefore be assessed immediately after each training session by persons other than the program directors. 8 In fact, a self-reported questionnaire might not reflect behaviors in authentic setting. Thus, instead of participants feeling about the value of the various training sessions, we should assess the improvement in teaching ability of participants , for PGY 1 residents competencies.\n\nSecondly, we only assessed the participants , perception about levels 1 to 3 of Kirkpatrick approach re our program. In other words, we did not evaluate of the participants , basal attitude and familiarity with ACGME six core competencies in the beginning of faculty development program. In order to validate our program, basal assessment of participants , perception is needed in the future.\n\nThirdly, according to the \"original\" definition, Kirkpatrick , s third level evaluates \"the amount of knowledge and skills learned that participants actually use in everyday work\". In our study, we modified the third level to be the \"self-reported degree of participants , application of skills leant from different teaching and training activities\". Furthermore, in order to effectively validate the results of our faculty development program, a clear definition of the desirable teacher , s behaviors needs be given to participants in future works. The behaviors perhaps should include: create an appropriate learning climate; be learner-centered; facilitating participants, learning; encouraging self-awareness through reflection; tailor teaching to participants , needs and wants, etc. suggested by Hewson et al. 10 Additionally, it is well-established that when one goes through an evaluation process, the evaluation process becomes more difficult and time-consuming as one moves from Kirkpatrick level 1 to level 4, although higher level provides information that is of increasingly significant value than lower level. Thus, the level 4 needs to be assessed in the future for our program. 11, 14 It should be noted that, as yet, no controlled educational trials on this subject have been published and this type of trail would be useful. 19 Finally, this study involved only a short follow-up period and a result, the study's findings may represent only short-term changes in attitude, familiarity, and teaching skills. 11 Despite these limitations, the present study provides information about the participants , perception of the various training sessions of our \"faculty development program about competency for clinical instructors\" designed and organized by the Taipei VGH educational committee. To date, there are no well-established standards that specifically address the competency teaching and assessment skills of clinical instructors. 4\n\nThe participants in our \"faculty development program of ACGME competencies 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 6.
