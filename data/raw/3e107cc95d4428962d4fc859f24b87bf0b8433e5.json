{"title": "", "body": "The recent paper of Dr. Jong-Myon Bae, \"Quaternary Prevention and Public Health\" [1] , in your journal has attracted my interest. The spread of this concept is beyond all expectation, and I am quite happy that the paper contributes to analytic thinking about the complexity of health care.\n\nThis particular application of the quaternary prevention (QP) concept is brilliant. Nevertheless, I would propose some slight modifications to Table 1 suggested by Dr. Bae, which I have taken the liberty to reproduce here with the due authorization of Dr. Bae after several rounds of correspondence with him.\n\nThe QP concept was born in Belgium in 1986. Leavell and Clark's preventive medicine framework did not mention QP [2] . In fact, the QP concept started to diffuse at the World Organization of Family Doctors (Wonca) congress in Hong Kong in 1995. Therefore, I have added a red line to the table to distinguish the origin of each concept in the framework. "}
