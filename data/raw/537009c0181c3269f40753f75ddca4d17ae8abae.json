{"title": "Estimating the cure rate and case fatality rate of the ongoing epidemic COVID-19", "body": "In December 2019, an epidemic caused by the new coronavirus COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of infected people and the spread of the virus have continued to increase, putting pressure not only on China but also the public health security worldwide (1) . The rapid research on COVID-19 virology, epidemiology, and clinical medicine has played a positive role in the prevention and treatment of the disease (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Considering the similarity of coronaviruses, the public habitually compares COVID-19 with SARS, especially regarding the data on cure rate (p) (CR) or case fatality rate (q) (CFR). In 2003, SARS emerged. The cumulative number of SARS diagnoses in Mainland China was 5,327, and the cumulative death toll was 349, with a CFR of 6.5 %; meanwhile, its cumulative number globally was 8,096, and the cumulative death toll was 744, with a CFR of 9.6 % (12).\n\nHowever, \"there is currently no clear formula for the CR of patients with new pneumonia,\" said by Jiao Yahui, the deputy director of the National Health and Medical Commission's Medical Affairs and Hospital Administration Bureau (13). The popular method of calculating the ratio of cumulative deaths to cumulative diagnosed cases to determine the CFR is accurate to confirm that an epidemic has ended, such as in the case of SARS. However, this estimation method has major flaws when applied in COVID-19, resulting in wrong judgments made by decision-makers regarding its future situation.

Clearly, the current CR and CFR is not the true CR and CFR caused by NOVID-19, nor it can accurately represent the current treatment trend of such a large number of hospitalized patients; if the cumulative discharge and the cumulative death are directly calculated, the CR and CFR would be 85.97 % and 14.03 %, respectively, which also cannot provide enough useful information. Therefore, we designed a method to calculate the CR of the new coronary pneumonia and then estimated the current CR and CFR to provide reference for the diagnosis, treatment, and control decision of this epidemic disease.\n\nData were acquired from various provinces, municipalities, and the country from January 20 to February 14. These data included the number of confirmed diagnoses, deaths, and discharges according to the National Health Commission of Wuhan, the National Health Commission of Hubei Province, and the COVID-19 Working Group of the State Council.\n\nHowever, few missing data from January 20 to January 23 were noted. The supplementary principle of the missing data is as follows: when the intermediate data are missing, the average of the two data (before and after) fills the missing data; when the data of Wuhan and the national data are missing, the data of Hubei Province are used as replacement (see Supplement Table S1 ). \n\nConsidering the occurrence of the epidemic situation of the novel pneumonia, some of patients have been cured and discharged, while some are still sick, some died, and some were All rights reserved.

The insight into whether the patients in the hospital will be cured or die remains unclear. Therefore, speculating the future trend while the epidemic is still ongoing by using the abovementioned formula to calculate the CR or the CFR directly is inappropriate.\n\nAccording to the results of clinical studies, the novel pneumonia is a self-limiting disease with mild early symptoms, which may worsen after a week, and after the most dangerous period of time, the patient may recover gradually. According to the treatment plan, the patient must wait for all the symptoms to disappear, with two negative results of COVID-19 nucleic acid test, and be isolated for several days before discharge. In other words, the daily reported deceased patients were not the same batch as discharged patients. Hence, confirmers of the same period should consider that a time difference (j day) exists between the cured and death cases.\n\nTherefore, the estimated CR (p ) should be the ratio of the cumulative number of discharges on the i thday (\n\nwhere i J y \u2212 is the number of cumulative deaths on the (i-j)th day and j is the parameter that needs to be estimated. The estimated CFR (q ) should be the ratio of\n\nThe empirical value j needs to be estimated before the estimation of the CR and CFR. In statistics, if we do not consider the discovery of specific drugs and medical means in the near future, the best estimates for each rate should be very close to its true value. In other words, these daily estimates are stable, and their variation is minimal. Thus, in this study, the empirical value j was determined according to the minimum variance (or coefficient of variation) among the daily estimates.\n\nBecause of the change in diagnostic criteria on February 12, resulting in a surge in All rights reserved.

Taking the national data as an example, starting from February 11 and backtracking, in Equation (2), j = 1, 2, 3, ..., 15 was calculated, and the CR was calculated daily. When j = 10, the value of CR was the most stable among the days, and the coefficient of variation was the smallest.\n\nAccording to the published data, in addition to calculating the national CR, the same calculations were performed according to the division data of Wuhan, Hubei, Hubei except Wuhan, and the country except Hubei (Fig.1) . The coefficient of variation of the estimated cure rate of wuhan, national, Hubei except Wuhan, Hubei and country except Hubei reached the minimum value at j =8,10,10,10,12, respectively, indicating that this is the smallest difference in the estimated value of each day.\n\nAccording to the published data, j = 8, 9, 10 were selected. As shown in Fig. 2 , the day-to-day CR from February 16 was calculated according to the division of the country, Wuhan, Hubei, Hubei except Wuhan, and the country except Hubei (see Table S2 -4).\n\nThe average CR is shown in Table 1 .\n\nAccording to Table 1 , when j=9, if no specific drugs and better treatments emerge later and the pathogenicity of NOVID-19 is not significantly different, the CR of the new coronary pneumonia is approximately 93 %, while its CFR is approximately 7 %, which is relatively close to the CFR of SARS (6.6 %) in Mainland China. In Wuhan, the CR of COVID-19 is approximately 90 %, while its CFR is approximately 10 % or more.\n\nProvince is lower than the national average, with only approximately 90%. The results of Hubei except Wuhan are similar to the national average. The CR in Hubei is the highest in the country, possibly related to factors such as the large number of imported cases, the different age structure of imported cases, relatively few patients, and better treatment conditions in provinces outside Hubei.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Hence, no treatment experience has been recorded, and no special drugs are currently known. It is mainly managed by symptomatic support treatment, all relying on enhanced immunity.\n\nAssuming that the COVID-19 epidemic event satisfies the statistical randomness, the virus has no variation, and the daily CR and CFR should be basically stable, with approximately the same medical means and measures in a certain period of time and the estimated value of j = 9 able to meet this condition.\n\nAccording to clinical experience, the time point of exacerbation was more concentrated on the 9th to 12th day of the disease course. After the exacerbation of the patient's condition, a rapid progress process takes place, and death easily occurs (14). In this article, j = 9 was consistent with the development of the disease course.\n\nCommission's press conference on February 4, the average length of hospitalization for discharged patients in country except Hubei is more than 9 days, whereas that in Hubei Province is 20 days (13). In this article, j= 9 was consistent with the actual treatment interval of the disease.\n\nThe CR estimate positively correlated with the j value size. The larger the j value, the greater the CR estimates; the smaller the j value, the smaller the CR estimates. In relation to the estimated value of CR, CFR will vary with the value of j. Therefore, to obtain accurate estimates of CR and CFR, we need to choose a j value, which is also worthy of further study.\n\nHowever, using this strategy and method is certainly more reasonable than directly \"calculating the CR and CFR for the COVID-19 in the country with the ratio of cumulative discharge (\u2211x) and cumulative death (\u2211y) to cumulative confirmed cases.\" (2) is not only appropriate and applicable during the epidemic; it is also an accurate estimate. The result estimated by Equation (2) is the same as that provided by Equation (1) at the end of the epidemic.\n\nThis study corrects the current problems in calculating the CR of COVID-19. The CR nationwide is estimated to be 93%, and the CR of Wuhan is approximately 87%, which is considerably higher than the current official data. However, the official CR nationwide on February 16 was only 15.37%. The higher CR we estimated not only helps to boost morale in All rights reserved.

Considering that the epidemic source is Wuhan, the estimated CFR of Wuhan exceeds 10%. According to the clinical analysis data of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital, the CFR of the first 41 patients was 15% (9, 15) , and the CFR of the first This article predicts this high CFR and death toll based on the current medical level and existing data. This result reminds us that we cannot be blindly optimistic. Governments at all levels and people from all walks of life must not take it lightly and must grasp the final \"window period.\" The patients should be separated and receivable and should receive care and treatment in the best way possible. Identifying high-risk personnel in the treated population, strengthening treatment, and minimizing the CFR should be taken into account. In particular, we need to continue to actively provide medical resources to Wuhan and Hubei Province to control the rate of severe illness and reduce the number of deaths.
