{"title": "Title: HOPS-dependent endosomal fusion required for efficient cytosolic delivery of therapeutic peptides and small proteins", "body": "Protein and peptide therapeutics-biologics-comprise a rapidly growing sector of the modern pharmacopeia (1) . Seven of the top ten highest grossing therapeutic agents in 2017 are biologics used to treat cancer (2, 3) , diabetes (4) , and autoimmune inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease (5) (6) (7) . In each case, the biologic acts by stimulating, inhibiting, or replacing a protein located within plasma or on an external membrane surface (1) . Not one acts within the cell cytosol or nucleus, in large part because most proteins cannot effectively breach the barrier defined by the plasma membrane (8, 9) . The well-known early exceptions to this rule discovered by L\u00f6wenstein (10) , Pabo (11) , and Derossi (12)-the HIV trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein and the Antennapedia homeodomain-have inspired the synthesis, study, and (in some cases) clinical evaluation (13) of literally hundreds of arginine-rich \"cell-penetrating peptides\" (CPPs) (14) . The problem is that when added to cells, most CPPs remain trapped in endosomes and fail to achieve significant concentrations in the cytosol or nucleus (15) . The inefficient delivery of proteins, peptides, and their mimetics into the mammalian cell cytosol limits their potential as therapeutics and research tools.\n\nRecently we discovered that, when added to cells, certain small, folded miniature proteins (16, 17) derived from avian pancreatic polypeptide (aPP) or an isolated zinc-finger (ZF) domain are taken up by the endocytic pathway and released into the cytosol with unprecedented efficiencies (18, 19) . The most effective molecules are defined by a discrete array of five arginine residues on a folded \u03b1-helix (20); we refer to these molecules as cell-permeant miniature proteins (CPMPs). Treatment of HeLa cells in culture with the CPMP ZF5.3 leads to a ZF5.3 concentration in the cytosol that is roughly 67% of the extracellular incubation concentration; this value is at least ten-fold higher than that achieved by HIV-Tat 48-60 peptide (21) or octaarginine (Arg8) and equal to that of hydrocarbon-stapled peptides under development as protein-protein interaction inhibitors (22). Comparable improvements in cytosolic access are observed when the CPMP ZF5.3 is fused to protein cargos with significant molecular mass (23).\n\nHere, we describe experiments that seek to understand how CPMPs like ZF5.3 traffic from endosomes into the cytosol and what factors contribute to the efficiency of endosomal release. First, using two complementary cell-based assays, we exclude endosomal rupture as the primary means of endosomal escape. Next, using a broad spectrum of techniques, including an RNA interference (RNAi) screen, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), genetic knockdowns, and confocal imaging, we identify VPS39-a gene encoding a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex-as a critical determinant in the trafficking of CPMPs and hydrocarbon-stapled peptides to the cytosol. HOPS activity is essential for cytosolic access; the closely related class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) complex is not required. CPMPs neither inhibit nor activate HOPS activity, and we find no evidence for a direct HOPS-CPMP interaction. Subsequent multi-color confocal imaging studies identify CPMPs within the endosomal lumen, particularly within the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of Rab7 + and Lamp1 + endosomes that are the products of HOPS-mediated fusion (24). We propanebetaine (iTOP) (42), and evaluate cell-permeant peptide-polymer complexes (35). However, the effects of CPPs or CPMPs on the extent of galectin-recruitment to damaged endosomes have not previously been studied.\n\nTo evaluate whether CPMPs such as aPP5. 3 (1) and ZF5.3 (2) lead to the recruitment of galectins to endosomal compartments, we made use of eGFP fusions of human galectin-3 (eGFP-hGal3) and human galectin-8 (eGFP-hGal8), both of which have been used previously to detect endosomal damage (31, 39, 40) . Human osteosarcoma (Saos-2) cells transiently expressing eGFP-hGal3 or eGFP-hGal8 were first treated for 1 hour with two known endosomolytic agents at concentrations reported to induce endosomal rupture and imaged using confocal microscopy to assess galectin recruitment from the cytosol to damaged endosomes ( Figure S2B ). These positive control reagents included Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (referred to as RNAiMAX henceforth) (16 \u03bcL/mL) and L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe) (1 mM). RNAiMAX is a cationic lipid formulation known to induce endosomal rupture to deliver siRNAs for targeted gene knockdown (40, 43). To induce visually detectable levels of endosomal rupture, we chose a concentration that is 3-fold higher than the average recommended concentration for siRNA transfection. For LLOMe, we chose a concentration, which had previously been reported to induce the desired galectin recruitment phenotype (31). Even though we routinely evaluate CPMP delivery after a 30-minute incubation period, we chose to evaluate endosomal rupture after a 60-minute incubation period to ensure detection of even low levels of rupture and galectin recruitment. The amount of endosomal recruitment was quantified using ImageJ (44) by calculating an endosomal recruitment coefficient (ERC), which was defined as the %-area of punctate fluorescence observed in a single cell divided by the total cell area, multiplied by 100 ( Figure S2C ). As expected (36, 40, 45), expression of eGFP-hGal3 or eGFP-hGal8 in untreated Saos-2 cells led to uniform eGFP fluorescence throughout the cytosol and nucleus with negligible punctate staining ( Figure S2B ). The average ERC values calculated in untreated Saos-2 cells expressing eGFP-hGal3 or eGFP-hGal8 were 2.0 \u00b1 0.6 and 3.4 \u00b1 0.7, respectively ( Figure S2D ). By contrast, treatment of Saos-2 cells with either RNAiMAX or LLOMe, both of which stimulate Gal3 and Gal8 recruitment to endolysosomal membranes in multiple cell lines (31, 33, 39, 40), led to significant punctate staining ( Figure S2B ). As previously reported, galectin recruitment occured within minutes and persisted for several hours (39). The average ERC values calculated when Saos-2 cells were treated with RNAiMAX were 62 \u00b1 8 (Gal-3) and 42 \u00b1 5 (Gal- 8) , values that represent increases of 30-and 14-fold over untreated cells ( Figure S2B and S2D). The effects of LLOMe were even more dramatic: the average ERC values in Saos-2 cells expressing eGFP-hGal3 or eGFP-hGal8 treated with LLOMe increased 147-and 68-fold compared to untreated cells, respectively. These data confirm the utility of eGFP-hGal3 and eGFP-hGal8 for monitoring CPP or CPMP-induced endolysosomal damage in Saos-2 cells.\n\nWe next examined the effects of CPMPs aPP5. 3 (1) and ZF5. 3 (2) on the endosomal recruitment of eGFP-hGal3 and eGFP-hGal8. Side-by-side experiments were performed with SAH-p53-8 (3), D-Arg8 (4), and CPP12 (5) . Each CPMP or CPP was tagged with a lissamine rhodamine B fluorophore (R) to enable its selective visualization alongside the eGFP-fused galectins. Galectin-expressing Saos-2 cells were treated with 600 nM 1 R -5 R (60 min), washed, and incubated for 30 min in CPMP/CPP-free media prior to imaging with confocal microscopy. This analysis revealed punctate red fluorescence throughout the cytosol, indicating endocytic uptake of CPPs 1 R -5 R , and a uniform distribution of eGFP-hGal3 and -8 throughout the cytosol and nucleus ( Figure S2B ). The average ERC values calculated when Saos-2 cells expressing eGFP-hGal3 or eGFP-hGal8 were treated with 600 nM CPPs 1 R -5 R were all less than 15 ( Figure S2D ), which is not significantly above the ERC of untreated Saos-2 cells. These data suggest that 1 R -5 R cause little or no galectin-positive endosomal damage at a treatment concentration of 600 nM.\n\nAlthough monitoring galectin recruitment reports on endolysosomal damage characterized by the cytosolic display of \u03b2-galactosides, it does not necessarily capture transient damage that can result in partial or complete endosomal leakage. To explore whether treatment of cells with CPMPs or CPPs causes endosomal leakage, we developed an assay to detect the release of lissamine rhodamine B-tagged Lys9 (Lys9 R ) from endosomes into the cytosol in the presence of CPPs or CPMPs. The nonapeptide Lys9 is internalized via endocytosis but not released into the cytosol under normal physiological conditions (46, 47). We verified this finding, and then used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (19) to quantify the concentration of Lys9 R that reached the cytosol in the presence of CPMPs or CPPs ( Figure S3A ). Control experiments confirmed that Saos-2 cells treated with increasing concentrations of RNAiMAX (0 to 16 \u03bcL/mL) exhibited a dose-dependent increase in Lys9 R , which was detected in the cytosol and nucleus using FCS. The highest concentration of RNAiMAX (16 \u03bcL/mL) yielded a 39-fold increase in the cytosolic (806 \u00b1 87 nM) and a 46-fold increase in the nuclear (1212 \u00b1 129 nM) concentrations of Lys9 R ( Figure S3B ). Similar titration experiments with LLOMe yielded no detectable endosomal leakage of Lys9 R , even at the highest tested LLOMe concentration (1 mM) ( Figure S3C ). LLOMe selectively induces lysosomal permeabilization (48, 49); it is possible that Lys9 R leakage can only occur efficiently from endosomes that precede the lysosome-an observation that has also been made for the endosomal escape of siRNA lipoplexes (40) and a disulfide-bonded dimer of Tat (dfTat) (50).\n\nAdditional control experiments using FCS confirmed that the cytosolic access of each CPMP or CPP was similar in the presence and absence of unlabeled Lys9 (Lys9 UL ) ( Figure S4A ). As reported previously for experiments performed in HeLa cells, CPMPs 1 R and 2 R and the hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 3 R reached the cytosol and nucleus with significantly greater efficiency than CPPs 4 R and 5 R , although cytosolic delivery was generally about 2-fold lower in Saos-2 cells than in HeLa cells (19) . Miniature proteins 1 R and 2 R , and the hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 3 R were present in the cytosol at 3-to 9-fold higher concentrations than D-Arg8 4 R . We were unable to perform conclusive FCS experiments with CPPs 4 R and 5 R . Specifically, in cells treated with 4 R and 5 R , we observed diffusion times that were between 50-to 150-fold longer compared to their respective in vitro diffusion times ( Figure S4B and Table S2 ). Diffusion times in cultured cells reportedly increase between 2-and 10-fold compared to their corresponding in vitro diffusion times (51). Increases greater than 10-fold may indicate intracellular aggregation or binding to a cellular component, preventing us from extracting meaningful parameters from the FCS data. To circumvent this problem, we performed biochemical fractionation experiments (19) to estimate the cytosolic concentrations attained by 4 R and 5 R .\n\nAfter confirming that the presence of Lys9 had no significant effect on the ability of CPMP/CPPs 1 R -5 R to reach the cytosol, we evaluated the extent to which Lys9 R leaked from endosomes into the cytosol or nucleus after treatment with an unlabeled CPMP or CPP (1 UL -5 UL ) at concentrations between 0.3 and 2.4 \u03bcM. No significant leakage of Lys9 R into the cytosol or nucleus was observed at CPMP or CPP concentrations below 2 \u03bcM ( Figure S3D -H). At 2.4 \u03bcM, CPMPs 1 UL and 2 UL induced low levels of Lys9 R endosomal leakage ( Figure S3D and S3E ), corresponding to a 6-and 10-fold increase above background for 1 UL and 2 UL , respectively. A similar increase in intracellular Lys9 R concentration was observed at 8 \u03bcL/mL treatment with RNAiMAX ( Figure S3B ), a concentration that is commonly used for efficient siRNA transfection (43). The remaining polypeptides 3 UL -5 UL did not induce significant Lys9 R leakage at any concentration tested in this assay ( Figure S3F-H) . Taken together, the galectin recruitment and Lys9 leakage assays demonstrate that CPMPs and CPPs 1 R -5 R /1 UL -5 UL do not induce endosomal rupture at concentrations below 2 \u03bcM. Above 2 \u03bcM, 1 UL and 2 UL induce low levels of galectin recruitment and Lys9 R leakage, indicating that they are causing endosomal damage. Toxicity studies that monitored metabolic activity over an extended 4 h timeframe by detecting cellular ATP (CellTiter-Glo) revealed EC 50 values for 1 UL , 2 UL , 4 UL , 5 UL that were >20 \u00b5M; the value for SAH-p53-8, 3 UL , was 4.0 \u00b5M ( Figure S4C ).\n\nThe observation that sub-micromolar concentrations of CPMPs aPP5.3 (1) and ZF5.3 (2) can efficiently access the cytosol without significantly perturbing endosomal membranes raised the possibility that CPMP release from endosomes exploits a distinct cellular mechanism. To characterize this mechanism, we designed a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify candidate genes whose knockdown increase or decrease the ability of CPMP 1 to reach cytosol ( Figure  2A ). To quantify cytosolic delivery of 1, we made use of a previously reported glucocorticoidinduced eGFP translocation (GIGT) assay (18, 20, 52 ) that couples the cytosolic delivery of a molecule tagged with dexamethasone (Dex) to the nuclear translocation of a reporter protein consisting of a glucocorticoid receptor variant with exceptional affinity for dexamethasone (GR*) (53, 54) fused to eGFP (GR*-eGFP) ( Figure S5A ). The effect of the Dex-tagged molecule on the ratio of GFP fluorescence in the nucleus and cytosol, termed the translocation ratio (TR), can be measured with precision using an Opera High-Content Screening System and thereby provides a quantifiable readout of cytosolic access (18, 20) . Previously, we demonstrated that the GIGT/Opera combination assay is associated with robust Z-factors of \u22650.5 and is therefore suitable for quantifying the cytosolic delivery of Dex-labeled CPMPs aPP5.3 Dex (1 Dex ) and ZF5.3 Dex (2 Dex ) in a high-throughput setting (20). Saos-2 cells stably expressing GR*-GFP (Saos-2(GIGT) cells) were prepared as described previously (20).\n\nBefore conducting the RNAi screen in a genome-wide format, we optimized cell density and siRNA transfection conditions to integrate the GIGT assay with high-content RNAi screening in Saos-2(GIGT) cells ( Figure S5B) . We then performed a duplicate pilot screen with 320 randomly chosen siRNAs from the Dharmacon human genome library. With this subset of siRNAs, we assessed assay performance in Saos-2(GIGT) cells treated with the CPMP 1 Dex at 1 \u00b5M concentration, which yielded the highest S/B ( Figure S5C ). This concentration is also well below 2.4 \u00b5M, the lowest concentration at which some endosomal leakage was detected. Performance was robust across this siRNA test panel, with a mean signal-to-background (S/B) ratio of 2.3 when comparing the translocation ratios (TR) of Saos-2(GIGT) cells treated with 1 Dex to untreated cells; the S/B ratio of an average siRNA screen is 2.9 (55). The observed coefficient of variation (CV), a measure of data variability, was also excellent; the 11.2% value observed was below the average observed in both small-molecule and siRNA screens (55). The calculated Z-factor (Z') was 0.3, within the acceptable range for siRNA screens (55), and the reproducibility between replicate wells was high (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.8) ( Figure  S5C ). Collectively, these statistics are modestly better than the average of representative RNAi screens (55) and highlight the suitability of the GIGT/Opera combination assay for high-content RNAi screening.\n\nWe then used the GIGT/Opera combination assay to evaluate the effects of siRNAs targeting the majority (18, 118) of human genes on the cytosolic localization of aPP5.3 Dex (1 Dex ). Saos-2(GIGT) cells were transfected in triplicate for 72 hours with pools of four siRNAs targeting different regions of the same human mRNA, serum-starved overnight, and treated with 1 \u03bcM 1 Dex for 30 minutes. The cells were fixed, stained with the nuclear dye Hoechst 33342, and the relative amounts of GR*-eGFP in the cytosol and nucleus quantified to generate a translocation ratio (TR) (Figure 2A ). The raw TR of each experimental well was converted to a normalized percent effect value (Equation 10, see Supplementary Information). The average TR of Saos-2(GIGT) cells transfected with a non-targeting siRNA (RISC-Free) and treated with 1 \u03bcM 1 Dex was defined as 0% effect, while that of Saos-2(GIGT) cells without 1 Dex transfected with nontargeting siRNA was defined as 100% effect.\n\nHits were identified from the data set by applying a strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD, \u03b2) threshold of 2.0 (56). This SSMD threshold identified 428 candidate genes that altered the GR*-eGFP translocation in the presence of 1 Dex across three replicates (Figure 2A and 2C). The set of 428 candidate genes consisted of 165 genes whose knockdown inhibited and 263 genes whose knockdown enhanced GR*-eGFP translocation with 1 Dex (Table S4) . Genes whose knockdown inhibited GR*-eGFP translocation in the presence of 1 Dex displayed average percent effect values between -26 and -100% (average = -44 \u00b1 10%) compared to positive control cells treated with a non-targeting siRNA and 1 Dex ( Figure 2B : siRNA hit type 1).\n\nGenes whose knockdown increased GR*-eGFP translocation displayed average percent effect values between +50 and +250% (average = +96 \u00b1 29%) higher than controls ( Figure 2B : siRNA hit type 2). Genes whose knockdown failed to alter the GR*-eGFP translocation induced by 1 Dex displayed mean percent effect values that remained unchanged when compared to control cells ( Figure 2B : no siRNA hit). The primary hit rate of 2.4% ( Figure 2C ) falls within the range typically observed during cell-based RNAi screens (median primary hit rate of 2.3%) (57) and reflects the conservative nature of the SSMD value used for thresholding hits from the primary screen. While genes implicated in endocytosis (58) were enriched among the set of 428 initial hits (102 genes, 24% of the total), a protein-protein interaction analysis using the String database (59) revealed many interactions but no singular enriched mechanism or pathway.\n\nTo focus our attention on genes involved in the endosomal release of CPMP 1 Dex , we prioritized the set of 428 initial hits to focus on genes of unknown function (29 genes) and those implicated previously in endocytic trafficking (102 genes) (Table S5) . Unknown genes were identified using the publicly available GeneCards and Rat Genome Database (RGD) databases (60, 61). Genes implicated in endocytic trafficking were identified using a previously reported systems-level survey of endocytosis (58). The 297 genes lost in this filtering step encompass diverse functions. To confirm that we had successfully prioritized genes of unknown function and those implicated previously in endocytic trafficking, we cross-referenced the set of 131 prioritized genes with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (62, 63). We specified the gene ontology classification \"cellular compartment\" to evaluate the \"enrichment\" of this set of 131 genes with respect to categories of subcellular organelles. The most enriched organelle categories, according to the database analysis, were the Golgi stack, the lysosomal membrane, and the late endosome. This analysis provides confidence that the set of 131 prioritized genes were worthy of subsequent study.\n\nWe recognized that some of the remaining siRNAs could be associated with the GR signaling pathway and affect the cytosolic to nuclear distribution of GR*-eGFP even in the absence of Dex or 1 Dex . To identify these genes, we evaluated the individual effect of each of the four genespecific siRNAs targeting the remaining 131 candidate genes on the distribution of GR*-GFP in non-treated Saos-2(GIGT) cells. We discarded a gene if three of the four gene-specific siRNAs significantly increased the TR compared to that measured in Saos-2(GIGT) cells transfected with a non-targeting siRNA, indicating that the gene knockdown primarily affects GR*-GFP distribution independent of the cytosolic presence of Dex or a Dex-labeled peptide. This process eliminated 61 genes from consideration (Table S6) , leaving 70 genes for subsequent validation.\n\nNext, focusing on these remaining 70 genes, we evaluated the individual effect of each of the four gene-specific siRNAs on the TR measured in Saos-2(GIGT) cells treated with either CPMP 1 Dex or 2 Dex , which both carry the discrete arginine array that exemplifies a penta-arg motif. We reasoned that this siRNA deconvolution procedure would identify those genes involved in cellular trafficking of both 1 Dex and 2 Dex , and simultaneously minimize false positives that result from siRNA off-target effects (64). Genes were retained if at least two of the four siRNAs in the pool led to significant TR changes (by one-way ANOVA test with Dunnett post hoc test) in the presence of either 1 Dex or 2 Dex when compared to that observed in Saos-2(GIGT) cells transfected with a non-targeting siRNA; 28 of the 70 candidate genes passed this filter (Table  S7 ). This final set of 28 genes displayed significant enrichment for membrane compartments (19 of 28 genes) when specifying the gene ontology term \"cellular compartments,\" but did not exhibit enriched protein-protein interaction networks (59).\n\nPrioritizing hits based on mechanism: genetic knockdowns that selectively mediate endosomal escape\n\nAlthough the GIGT/Opera combination assay is useful for analyzing the effect on siRNA knockdowns on cytosolic access in a high-throughput mode, it is inherently qualitative and does not differentiate between knockdowns that alter CPMP/CPP uptake from those that only affect endosomal escape. To further validate and differentiate between the remaining 28 candidate genes on the basis of these criteria, we turned to two quantitative methods: flow cytometry (FC) and FCS (19) . When used together, FC and FCS effectively discriminate knockdowns that alter overall CPMP/CPP uptake (quantified by FC) from those that affect endosomal escape (quantified by FCS). To evaluate the effects of each siRNA knockdown on the trafficking of CPMPs using FC and FCS, we chose to focus on CPMP 2 R -while CPMPs 1 R and 2 R follow a similar endocytic trafficking pattern into the cell interior (18), 2 R is more stable and reaches the cytosol more efficiently (19) .\n\nTo evaluate the effect of the 28 candidate genes on CPMP uptake and endosomal release, Saos-2 cells were treated with pooled gene-specific siRNAs for 72 h. Transfected Saos-2 cells were then treated with 600 nM 2 R for 30 minutes, lifted with trypsin to remove plasma membrane-bound peptide (18) , and analyzed using FC and FCS to quantify both overall cellular uptake and the concentration of 2 R that reached the cell interior ( Figure 3A ). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) experiments confirmed that the knockdown efficiency of each siRNA pool was >70% in Saos-2 cells ( Figure S6A ). Additional control experiments confirmed that neither RNAiMAX nor knockdown of the housekeeping gene GAPD affected overall CPMP uptake by Saos-2 cells (as determined by FC) or intracellular delivery of 2 R (as determined by FCS) ( Figure S6B ).\n\nKnockdown of the 28 candidate genes led to significant differences in the overall uptake and intracellular delivery of 2 R . Knockdown of only four of the 28 candidate genes (VPS39, SCAMP5, PIGW, and DOCK4) significantly decreased the overall uptake of 2 R , as determined using FC (left axis in Figure 3B -D); none of the siRNAs significantly increased overall uptake when measured in this way ( Figure 3B-D) . Different trends emerged when siRNA knockdown effects were evaluated using FCS (right axis in Figure 3B -D); in this case 19 of 28 knockdowns led to a significant decrease in the concentration of 2 R in the cytosol or nucleus. Knockdown of six of the 28 candidate genes strongly reduced (>70%) the delivery of 2 R to the nucleus and cytosol: these genes include VPS39, SCAMP5, PXN, PIGW, MS4A4A, and LYPLA1 ( Figure  3B ). Knockdown of an additional 13 candidate genes moderately reduced (40-70%) the delivery of 2 R to the nucleus and cytosol: these genes include TAS2R45, CASC1, KLHDC10,  CSGALNACT2, INA, IL17REL, RAB2A, ZYX, INADL, ABPA3, GNG13, AVL9 , and TVP23A ( Figure 3C) . Notably, knockdown of one candidate gene, ARHGAP9, led to a significant (+49%) increase in the delivery of 2 R to the nucleus and cytosol ( Figure 3D ); this finding suggests that inhibitors of ARHGAP9 could improve endosomal release. It is also notable that genes whose knockdown strongly reduced the delivery of 2 R encompass multiple cellular activities related to membrane homeostasis, including membrane tethering (VPS39, RAB2A), glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis (PIGW), thioesterases (LYPLA1), and cytoskeletal genes (PXN, ZYX). The remaining eight genes consisted of DOCK4 and seven olfactory receptors (ORs: OR4C6, OR4F15, OR51E1, OR51Q1, OR52N1, OR5M8, OR8D1) , which were eventually classified as false positives ( Figure 3C ). In summary, of the 28 genes identified in the GIGT high-throughput screen, knockdown of six strongly inhibited cytosolic access, knockdown of 13 moderately inhibited cytosolic access, and knockdown of one gene promoted cytosolic access ( Figure 3E ). These data provide evidence that we successfully screened and prioritized genes that primarily regulate intracellular trafficking-with 20 out 28 genes affected by FCS-and not overall uptake-with only four genes affected by FC.\n\nHydrocarbon-stapled \u03b1-helical peptides are a promising class of therapeutic candidates because they can exhibit improved pharmacological properties-such as increased binding affinity, proteolytic resistance, and cell permeability-compared to staple-free analogs (65-67). Although hydrocarbon-stapled peptides lack the defined array of arginine side chains that characterizes CPMPs 1 and 2, they reach the cytosol with high efficiency. In particular, the hydrocarbon-stapled peptide SAH-p53-8 R (3 R ) achieves average intracellular concentrations (as determined by FCS in HeLa or Saos-2 cells) that are only 10-50% lower than those attained by ZF5.3 R (2 R ), depending on the cell line used (19) . To investigate whether 2 and 3 share a common mode of endosomal release, Saos-2 cells were treated with pooled siRNAs targeting the set of 20 candidate genes, treated with 3 R (600 nM), and both whole-cell uptake and cytosolic delivery were quantified with FC and FCS as described above ( Figure S6C ).\n\nA plot showing the percent effect of each statistically significant knockdown (that is, significant for both 2 R and 3 R by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett post hoc test) on the cytosolic localization of 2 R or 3 R showed moderate correlation (Pearson r = 0.47, P = 0.17) ( Figure S7A ). Knockdown of five genes-VPS39, INA, LYPLA1, KLHDC10, and CASC1 strongly (>50%) inhibited the appearance of both 2 R and 3 R in the cytosol (blue open circles). Knockdown of another four genes-MS4A4A, TAS2R45, RAB2A, and APBA3-resulted in a moderate (30-50%) decrease in the appearance of both 2 R and 3 R in the cytosol (green dots). Knockdown of AVL9, although statistically significant, did not have a strong %-effect on the ability of either 2 R or 3 R to reach the cytosol ( Figure S7A ). When the effects of these gene knockdowns on overall uptake of 2 R and 3 R are plotted, the effects are small, as expected ( Figure S7B ). Overall, the observed correlation between the effects of gene knockdowns on the cytosolic localization of CPMP 2 R and hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 3 R suggests that these genes play common roles in the intracellular trafficking of these two molecular families. The five genes that most strongly regulate cytosolic delivery of both 2 R or 3 R can be divided into four categories: (1) genes with known roles in endocytic trafficking (VPS39); (2) genes involved in the processing of post hoc translational protein modifications (LYPLA1), (3) genes involved in RNA processing (CASC1), and (4) genes with poorly characterized or unknown functions (INA and KLHDC10).\n\nThe goal of the RNAi screen was to identify candidate genes that significantly enhance or inhibit the intracellular localization of multiple CPMPs and CPPs. One gene transcript, when depleted, strongly inhibited the cellular uptake and cytosolic delivery of both CPMP 2 R and stapled peptide 3 R : the VPS39 gene, also known as hVamp6. VPS39 encodes an 875-residue protein that is conserved in eukaryotes (68) and is one of six protein subunits comprising the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) membrane tethering complex ( Figure 4A ). Working with VPS41 and various effector proteins (69, 70), VPS39 recruits the HOPS complex to endosomes positive for the small GTPase Rab7, such as maturing (Rab5 + /Rab7 + ) and late (Rab7 + ) endosomes. The remaining four core HOPS subunits, VPS11, VPS16, VPS18, and VPS33A, serve primarily a structural role (70). A fully assembled HOPS complex is required to initiate fusion of Rab7 + maturing and late endosomes as they are converted into lysosomes ( Figure  6B ). Depletion of any subunit delays lysosome maturation and inhibits cargo degradation ( Figure 4B ) (70-72). HOPS is closely related to a structurally similar complex, the CORVET complex ( Figure 4A ), that precedes HOPS along the endocytic pathway by promoting the fusion of Rab5 + early and maturing endosomes (73). CORVET shares four core subunits with HOPS but contains TGFBRAP1 and VPS8 (73) in place of VPS39 and VPS41.\n\nHaving identified VPS39 as a key regulator of the cytosolic delivery of 2 R and 3 R , we next asked whether the observed effect was dependent on VPS39 alone or on the other unique protein subunit of the HOPS complex: VPS41. Saos-2 cells transfected with a non-targeting (RISC-Free) or a pool of four VPS41-targeting siRNAs were treated with 2 R or 3 R (600 nM) for 30 minutes and analyzed using both FC and FCS as described above ( Figure 4C and 4D). In our primary screen, we found that siRNAs against VPS41 displayed a mild inhibitory effect on GR*-eGFP translocation in the presence of 1 Dex (27% mean percent effect, 1.58 Z-score, 1.65 SSMD), which was below our hit threshold. Here, upon VPS41 depletion, we observed a moderate decrease (-27%) in overall uptake and a strong (-71%) decrease in the average intracellular concentration for 2 R ( Figure 4C ); these changes are comparable to those observed after VPS39 knockdown. In VPS41-depleted cells treated with hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 3 R , we also observed a significant decrease in overall uptake (-27%) and in the average intracellular delivery (-55%) by FCS ( Figure 4D ); these changes are also similar to those observed after VPS39 knockdown. By contrast, no significant decreases in overall uptake or cytosolic localization of 2 R or 3 R were observed upon depletion of the CORVET-specific subunits TGFBRAP1 and VPS8 ( Figure 4C and 4D); in fact, depletion of the TGFBRAP subunit led to significant increases in both overall uptake and cytosolic concentration of 2 R and 3 R ( Figure 4C and 4D). Taken together, these data support a hypothesis in which both unique components of the HOPS complex, VPS39 and VPS41, are required to allow cytosolic access of both CPMP 2 R and hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 3 R . Similar trends were observed in comparable experiments performed using CPMP 1 R ( Figure S8A ) implying that HOPS-dependent membrane tethering is also necessary for the efficient delivery of CPMP 1 R to the cytosol.\n\nBecause of the unusual diffusion dynamics observed for CPPs 4 R and 5 R in cultured cells ( Figure S4B ), we were unable to perform FCS experiments to evaluate whether their delivery to the cytosol required HOPS subunits or activity. We were able to estimate their relative delivery into the cytosol on the basis of fluorescence intensity values obtained during FCS measurements (without autocorrelation); these values are proportional to the intracellular concentration in the confocal volume ( Figure S8E ). Knockdown of either VPS39 or VPS41 led to a significant (23-35%) decrease in whole-cell uptake of 4 R or 5 R (as determined by FC) and a 46-62% decrease in their average cytosolic fluorescence intensity (as determined by FCS without autocorrelation) ( Figure S8B and S8C). In contrast, knockdown of the CORVET subunits TGFBRAP1 or VPS8 led to either no change (5 R ) or a 30% increase (4 R ) in overall uptake (as determined by FC) ( Figure S8B and S8C). Knockdown of TGFBRAP1 led to no change in the average cytosolic fluorescence intensity of 4 R or 5 R (as determined by FCS without autocorrelation), while knockdown of VPS8 either stimulated (4 R ) or had no effect (5 R ) on the average cytosolic fluorescence intensity as determined by FCS without autocorrelation.\n\nTaken together, these data show that HOPS-specific subunits VPS39 and VPS41, but not CORVET-specific subunits TGFBRAP1 and VPS8, are required for the cytosolic delivery of all CPMP/CPPs tested herein. These CPMPs and CPPs differ significantly in their intrinsic ability to reach the cytosol ( Figure S4A ), but in all cases this ability demands an active HOPS complex. Importantly, the more active CPMPs 1 and 2 are significantly more sensitive to knockdown of the HOPS subunit VPS39 than hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 3 or CPPs 4 and 5; knockdown of VPS39 led to 79% and 74% decrease in the cytosolic concentrations of CPMPs 1 and 2, whereas the decreases observed for hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 3 and CPPs 4 and 5 ranged from 49-56%. These data suggest that even though all peptides require HOPS-dependent fusion of late endosomes to access the cytosol, CPMPs 1 and 2 may be more strongly dependent on this pathway-or make more efficient use of it-than hydrocarbon-stapled peptides and CPPs 3-5.\n\nAlthough the experiments described above indicate that efficient cytosolic delivery of CPMP/CPPs 1-5 demands the presence of a fully assembled HOPS complex, they do not discriminate between two limiting explanations for this dependence: one in which cytosolic access demands the activity of the HOPS complex and another in which cytosolic access demands the inhibition this activity. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we monitored HOPS activity in the presence of CPMPs 1 UL -5 UL using a previously reported fluorescence colocalization protocol that quantifies HOPS-dependent delivery of dextran to .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/374926 doi: bioRxiv preprint lysosomal compartments (71, 72). In this assay, the endocytic system is flooded with Alexa Fluor 488-tagged dextran for 2 h, after which the cells are washed and stained with Hoechst 33342, re-plated in dextran-free media, incubated for 1 h, stained with Magic Red, and imaged immediately by confocal microscopy ( Figure S9A ). Magic Red is a dye that becomes fluorescent in the presence of active cathepsin B-an enzyme exclusively localized to mature lysosomes. Dextran is only delivered to lysosomal compartments if endosomal fusion of Rab7 + endosomes occurs. This process requires a fully assembled and functional HOPS complex (71, 72).\n\nTo validate this assay, we first measured the effect of HOPS-specific subunit depletion on the colocalization of Magic Red with dextran. Saos-2 cells were transfected with siRNA pools targeting either VPS39 or VPS41, or with a non-targeting siRNA as a negative control. After 72 hours, cells were treated as described above and the colocalization of dextran and Magic Red was calculated using ImageJ (44). In untreated and non-targeting siRNA-treated Saos-2 cells, the colocalization of Alexa Fluor 488-dextran and Magic Red was characterized by Manders coefficients of 0.30 \u00b1 0.030 and 0.23 \u00b1 0.020, respectively; these values represent the fraction of dextran-containing vesicles that also contain cathepsin B and are comparable to those measured previously (74) ( Figure S9B and S9C). As expected, depletion of HOPS-specific subunits VPS39 and VPS41 significantly reduced the colocalization of Alexa Fluor 488-dextran and Magic Red, leading to significantly lower Manders coefficients of 0.11 \u00b1 0.024 and 0.12 \u00b1 0.016, respectively ( Figure S9B and S9C).\n\nWith a validated assay in hand, we next asked whether addition of CPMPs or CPPs 1 UL -5 UL had an observable effect on the intrinsic activity of the HOPS complex. Saos-2 cells were pre-treated with unlabeled CPMPs 1 UL -5 UL at 600 nM for 30 min and labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-dextran and Magic Red as described above ( Figure S9D ). In cells treated with CPMPs/CPPs 1 UL -5 UL , the colocalization of Alexa Fluor 488-dextran and Magic Red was characterized by Manders coefficients that ranged from 0.27 \u00b1 0.03 (when treated with 5 UL ) to 0.33 \u00b1 0.03 (when treated with 1 UL ), well within the range of values measured in cells that had not been treated with CPMPs or CPPs ( Figure S9E and S9F). We conclude that the treatment of Saos-2 cells with CPMPs 1-5 neither inhibits nor enhances the intrinsic function of HOPS-mediated endosomal fusion. As a whole, our studies suggest that the endosomal escape of all CPMPs and CPPs tested is dependent on the presence of a functional, active HOPS complex.\n\nHOPS is required for the fusion of Rab7 + endosomes, a process initiated by HOPS-mediated membrane tethering and completed by the mechanical action of SNAP (soluble NSF(Nethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) attachment protein) receptor (SNARE) proteins and the HOPS complex itself (75). Depletion of HOPS-specific subunits significantly decreases the cytosolic and nuclear concentrations of all CPMP/CPPs tested. Three limiting models are consistent with these experimental findings. The first invokes a direct interaction between a CPMP/CPP located within or on the surface of a Rab7 + late endosome and a component of the HOPS complex, perhaps VPS39 or VPS41, that effectively shuttles the CPMP or CPP from an endosome into the cytosol (model 1). The second model also positions the CPMP/CPP within or on the surface of a Rab7 + late endosome but lacks a direct HOPS-CPMP/CPP interaction; in this case HOPS facilitates escape of the CPMP/CPP during the fusion process (76, 77) (model 2). In the third model, the CPMP or CPP escapes after HOPS-dependent fusion is complete, when maturing and late endosomes have fused into compartments containing intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) (model 3). In this case, interactions between CPMPs and ILVs in the late endosome may facilitate endosomal escape; indeed, some evidence for CPP-ILV interactions have been reported (50). Implicit in models 1 and 2 is the colocalization of a CPMP/CPP with or upon the membrane of a Rab7 + late endosome. Confocal microscopy of Saos-2 cells expressing either the early endosomal (EE) marker Rab5-GFP, the late endosomal marker (LE) Rab7-GFP, or the lysosomal (LY) marker Lamp1-GFP and treated with 2 R (300 nM, 30 min) revealed low colocalization between 2 R and EEs (Pearson r = 0.20 \u00b1 0.019) but high colocalization of 2 R with LEs (r = 0.55 \u00b1 0.034) and LYs (r = 0.58 \u00b1 0.027) ( Figure 5A , 5B, 5D). However, these experiments could not resolve whether the fluorescence of 2 R was localized to the endosomal lumen or the membrane. To better resolve the location of 2 R , we treated Saos-2 cells with the small molecule YM201636, an inhibitor of the phosphoinositide kinase PIK-fyve that enlarges Rab7 + endolysosomes (78, 79). Again, in cells expressing GFP-labeled endosomal markers, we observed virtually no colocalization between 2 R and EEs (r = 0.034 \u00b1 0.025), good colocalization with LEs (r = 0.57 \u00b1 0.043), and excellent colocalization with LYs (r = 0.73 \u00b1 0.023) ( Figure 5C and 5D). Line profiles across these enlarged vesicles provide no evidence for accumulation of 2 R on the LE or LY membrane; instead, plots of fluorescence intensity as a function of position show clearly separable distributions of fluorescence due to GFP (green) and lissamine rhodamine B (red) ( Figure 5E and 5F). These distributions suggest that 2 R resides primarily within Rab7 + and Lamp1 + vesicles and not on their surface and is inconsistent with models 1 or 2 as the primary means of endosomal escape.\n\nCloser examination of enlarged endosomes in Rab7-or Lamp1-GFP-expressing cells revealed the presence of smaller vesicles within the boundaries of late endosomal membranes, as shown in Figure 5G and 5H and in two movies of cells expressing Lamp1-GFP and treated with 2 R (white arrows in Figure 5G and 5H and Movies S1 and S2). Late endosomes are characterized, among other properties, by the presence of ILVs. To determine whether the smaller 2 Rcontaining vesicles observed in late endosomes represent ILVs, we used a known ILV marker, the lipid N-Rh-PE, a lissamine rhodamine B-tagged version of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoethanolamine (80) ( Figure S10A ). N-Rh-PE is internalized via the endocytic pathway into ILVs (81-83) before it is eventually secreted in exosomes (80, 82, 84). As expected (80), N-Rh-PE localizes to the luminal side of Rab7-GFP + late endosomes (r = 0.39 \u00b1 0.050) and Lamp1-GFP + lysosomes (r = 0.45 \u00b1 0.031), but not to Rab5-GFP + early endosomes (r = 0.104 \u00b1 0.004) ( Figure S10B and S10D). To image N-Rh-PE and CPMP 2 simultaneously, we tagged 2 with a silicon-rhodamine (SiR) dye that emits at 660-670 nm (85) (lissamine rhodamine B emits .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/374926 doi: bioRxiv preprint at 585-595 nm). Saos-2 cells treated with 2 SiR alone showed a colocalization profile that mirrored that of 2 R , as expected (compare Figure 5B /5D to S10C/S10E). Saos-2 cells treated with both N-Rh-PE and 2 SiR showed significant colocalization (r = 0.53 \u00b1 0.028) ( Figure S10F and S10G) providing evidence that CPMP 2 SiR indeed localizes to ILVs or to LEs and LYs that contain ILVs, providing support for model 3.\n\nWe also performed a four-color confocal microscopy experiment to visualize Saos-2 cells expressing either an EE, LE, or LY marker (as a GFP fusion) and treated with N-Rh-PE, 2 SiR , as well as Hoechst 33342. As expected, we observed virtually no colocalization of 2 SiR with EEs (r = 0.071 \u00b1 0.014) but good colocalization with LEs (r = 0.35 \u00b1 0.036) and LYs (r = 0.41 \u00b1 0.037). Also as expected, we observed minimal colocalization of N-Rh-PE with EEs (r = 0.078 \u00b1 0.023) and good colocalization with LEs (r = 0.39 \u00b1 0.039) and LYs (r = 0.43 \u00b1 0.045). Good colocalization between 2 SiR and N-Rh-PE was observed in Saos-2 cells regardless of which endosomal marker was present ( Figure S11A and S11C). To enlarge Rab7 + endolysosomes for better resolution, we again treated Saos-2 cells with YM201636 (78, 79) ( Figure S11B ). Pearson r values were similar in cells with and without YM201636 present ( Figure S11D ). By generating line profiles of endosomes displayed in Figure S11B , we again observed minimal overlap between GFP markers for Rab7 or Lamp1 and either CPMP 2 SiR or ILV marker N-Rh-PE ( Figure  S11E and S11F). These results further support the conclusion that CPMP 2 localizes within (as opposed to on the surface of) late endosomes and lysosomes along with a marker for ILVs and provides additional support for model 3.\n\nThe observation that 2 colocalizes with N-Rh-PE, a lipid marker for ILVs, along with the absence of evidence that CPMP 2 localizes within the late endosomal membrane, provided circumstantial evidence for model 3, in which HOPS is required to deliver CPMPs into a cell compartment that then facilitates endosomal escape. If so, then knockdown of HOPS components (but not CORVET components) should reduce trafficking of 2 SiR to LEs and LYs. To test this hypothesis, we transfected Saos-2 cells with siRNAs against HOPS subunit VPS39 and CORVET subunit TGFBRAP1. In control cells transfected with a non-targeting (RISC-Free) siRNA, we measured virtually no colocalization between 2 SiR and EE marker Rab5-GFP (r = 0.05 \u00b1 0.01), moderate colocalization with LE marker Rab7-GFP (r = 0.25 \u00b1 0.016), and good colocalization with LY marker Lamp1-GFP (r = 0.57 \u00b1 0.027) ( Figure 6A and 6D). In HOPS-deficient cells, we also observed virtually no colocalization of 2 SiR with EEs (r = 0.05 \u00b1 0.01) and moderate colocalization with LEs (r = 0.21 \u00b1 0.016). The colocalization with LYs (r = 0.35 \u00b1 0.026), on the other hand, was significantly lower compared to control cells ( Figure 6B and 6D). No such changes were observed in CORVET-deficient cells (virtually no colocalization of 2 SiR with EEs (r = 0.083 \u00b1 0.013); moderate colocalization with LEs (r = 0.21 \u00b1 0.015), high colocalization with LYs (r = 0.47 \u00b1 0.021) ( Figure 6C and 6D). These data suggest that knockdown of HOPS but not CORVET inhibits trafficking of 2 SiR to Lamp1 + LEs and LYs and is consistent with model 3, in which CPP/CPMPs require HOPS to reach a favorable environment for escape.

There is compelling evidence that this journey often involves endocytosis (86, 87), the natural cellular process by which extracellular material is taken up into vesicles formed from the plasma membrane. However, the pathway into the cytosol requires not just uptake into endocytic vesicles, but also endosomal release, and this second step is widely recognized as the bottleneck hindering the efficient delivery of peptidic materials into the cytosol and nucleus (18, (88) (89) (90) (91) (92) (93) (94) (95) (96) . We discovered several years ago that CPMPs such as ZF5.3 (18, 97, 98) overcome this bottleneck to reach the cytosol with exceptional efficiency, both with (23) and without (19) an appended protein cargo. Here, we sought to understand the cellular processes that support the trafficking of CPMPs into the cytosol. First, using two complementary cell-based assays, we ruled out the most obvious mechanism of endosomal release-a partial or complete disruption of endosomal integrity. Next, using a spectrum of tools, including a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen, quantitative fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and live-cell, multicolor confocal imaging, we identified VPS39-a gene encoding a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex-as a critical determinant in the trafficking of CPMPs to the cytosol. CPMPs neither inhibit nor activate HOPS activity; indeed, HOPS activity is essential for the cytosolic access of CPMPs as well as other CPPs and hydrocarbon-stapled peptides. Subsequent multi-color confocal imaging studies identify CPMPs within the endosomal lumen, particularly within the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of Rab7 + and Lamp1 + endosomes that are the products of HOPS-mediated fusion. These results suggest that CPMPs require HOPS to reach ILVs-an environment that serves as a prerequisite for efficient endosomal escape.\n\nThe activity of the HOPS complex has also been implicated in the cytosolic trafficking of numerous bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens, including coronavirus (CoV) (99, 100), the Ebola virus (101), Fusarium graminearum (102), Candida albicans (103, 104), Cryptococcus neoformans (105), and Aspergillus nidulans (106). In particular, although their genomes lack sequences encoding a canonical penta-arg motif, both CoV and Ebola require HOPS during the later steps of their postulated mechanism of cell entry: after the viral particle has been endocytosed but before it reaches the cytosol. Passage of CoV into the cytosol requires processing of viral proteins by lysosomal proteases to enable fusion with lysosomal membranes and release into the cytosol; HOPS depletion prevents CoV from reaching the lysosome and thus fusion and release cannot occur (100). Passage of Ebola virus is regulated by HOPS in a similar manner: Ebola viral particles are unable to fuse with the lysosomal membranes in HOPSdeficient cells (101). It is important to note that, in all cases where HOPS is a required cytosolic entry factor, no direct interactions between HOPS and the pathogen have been identified. HOPS operates in a supporting role by allowing the pathogen to escape during HOPS-mediated endosomal fusion, or by providing the pathogen with access to a favorable environment for .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/374926 doi: bioRxiv preprint escape, fully consistent with the model proposed for the cytosolic trafficking of CPMPs and hydrocarbon-stapled peptides (model 3).\n\nSignificant experiments performed in vitro and in cultured cells provide additional support for an endosomal escape pathway that relies on the fusogenic activity of ILVs (26, 50, 78, 107). Experiments performed in vitro indicate that Tat 48-60 translocates efficiently across liposomal membranes whose lipid components resemble those of late endosomal ILVs (lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA)/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC)/1,2-dioleoylsn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PE), 77:19:4), but not across those that resemble the late endosomal membrane (PC/PE/phosphatidylinositol (PI)/LBPA, 5:2:1:2), and not at all across those whose lipids resemble the plasma membrane (PC/PE/sphingomyelin (SM)/cholesterol, 1:1:1:1.5) (107). Similarly, a disulfide-bonded dimer of Tat (dfTat) induces leakage of the green fluorophore calcein from liposomes composed of ILV-like lipids (LBPA/PC/PE, 77:19:4), but not from liposomes that mimic EEs or the plasma membrane (PC:PE:cholesterol, 65:15:20) (50). The nuclear delivery of dfTat (as estimated by counting cells with nucleolar fluorescence staining from dfTat) is also significantly reduced in cells pre-incubated with an antibody against LBPA. LBPA is highly abundant in ILVs (108, 109) and its fusogenic activity is thought to be responsible for ILV back-fusion with endosomal membranes (110). Finally, certain cyclic CPPs, such as CPP12 (5), induce inward and outward membrane budding when added to giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) composed of LE lipids (PC/PE/PI/LBPA, 5:2:1:2) (26). The observed budding behavior is reminiscent of the dynamic nature of multivesicular LEs in live cells, for which ESCRT-dependent ILV inward budding and exosome outward budding are tightly connected to the unique LBPA-enriched lipid mixture observed in LEs (111). Finally, cellpermeant phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides (PS-ASO) also colocalize with LBPA-containing ILVs inside LEs, and knockdown of ALIX protein-known to cause a reduction in cellular LBPA levels (110, 112, 113)-reduces cytosolic delivery of PS-ASO (78). Together, these data provide additional support for a model for cytosolic trafficking that requires HOPS to reach a favorable environment for endosomal escape: LEs and LYs containing ILVs enriched in the fusogenic lipid LBPA. The identification of ILVs as a portal for passing proteins into the cytosol will aid the development of next-generation biologics that overcome the limitations imposed by cellular membranes.\n\nThis work was supported by US National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants R01 GM74756 and CA 170741 (to A.

All arginine, cysteine, and histidine residues were coupled at 50 \u00b0C. All arginine residues were coupled twice. To couple olefinic residues, DMF (4.5 mL), PyClocK (3.75 equiv.), Fmoc-protected olefinic amino acids (Fmoc-S 5 -OH or Fmoc-R 8 -OH, 3.75 equiv.) were combined and allowed to stir at room temperature (RT) for 2 hours (h). Residues following olefinic amino acids were coupled twice. Fmoc deprotections were performed using 20% piperidine in DMF (4.5 mL) with microwave assistance (70 \u00b0C for 3 min, twice). For peptides containing aspartate or glutamate, 0.1 M HOBt was added to the deprotection solution to minimize aspartimide formation. The resin was washed thoroughly with DMF (four times, 4.5 mL/wash) between each coupling and deprotection step. Following synthesis, the resin was transferred to a custom glass reaction vessel containing a stir bar. Both vessel and stir bar were coated with SigmaCote before the resin was transferred.\n\nPeptide Modifications: N-terminally SDex-Labeled Peptides. 1 Dex and 2 Dex CPMPs were synthesized and purified as described before (4) . Briefly, Boc-Lys(Fmoc)-OH was coupled onto the N-terminus of a resin-bound peptide in a custom glass vessel using the peptide coupling conditions described above. The Fmoc-protected Lys sidechain was . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/374926 doi: bioRxiv preprint S4 deprotected with 20% piperidine in DMF containing 0.1 M HOBt. Following Fmoc deprotection, dexamethasone-21-thiopropionic acid (SDex) (2.5 equiv.), 1-hydroxy-7azabenzotriazole (HOAt) (2.5 equiv.), 1-[Bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxid hexafluorophosphate (HATU) (2.5 equiv.), DIEA (10.0 equiv.) and 2,6-lutidine (7.0 equiv.) in DMF (3.0 mL) were added to the resin. The resincontaining glass vessel was shaken for 18 h at RT on an orbital shaker. The resin was then thoroughly washed with DMF, dichloromethane (DCM), and methanol (MeOH), after which it was dried under a stream of nitrogen overnight.\n\nPeptide Modifications: Hydrocarbon-Stapled Peptides. Hydrocarbon-stapled peptide variants of SAH-p53-8 (3) bearing an N-terminal acetyl group or an N-terminal lissamine rhodamine B linked at a Lys side chain were synthesized and purified as described before (5, 6) . Briefly, to couple olefinic residues, DMF (4.5 mL), PyClocK (3.75 equiv.), and Fmoc-protected olefinic amino acids (Fmoc-S 5 -OH or Fmoc-R 8 -OH, 3.75 equiv.) were combined and allowed to stir at RT for 2 h. Residues following olefinic amino acids were coupled twice. Following automated peptide synthesis, resin-bound stapled peptides were washed three times with dichloroethane (DCE) (10 mL) and cyclized on resin in a custom glass vessel, immediately prior to acetylation or rhodamine labeling, using Grubbs Catalyst I (20 equiv.) in DCE (4 mL) for 2 h under a constant stream of nitrogen. This cyclization step was repeated an additional time. Peptide Modifications: N-Terminal Acetylation. N-terminally acetylated peptides were generated by treating the terminally Fmoc-deprotected resin-bound peptide with a mixture containing acetic anhydride, DIEA, and DMF (2 mL, in a 85:315:1600 volumetric ratio) and stirring at RT for 45 min in a custom glass vessel.\n\nTo label polypeptides with lissamine rhodamine B, Boc-Lys(Fmoc)-OH or-for stapled peptides-Fmoc-\u03b2-Ala-OH was appended to the N-terminus of the respective sequence by combining the N-terminally deprotected resin with 7-azabenzotriazol-1yloxy)trispyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyAOP) (5 equiv.), HOAt (5 equiv.), and DIEA (10 equiv.) in DMF (4 mL) under microwave irradiation in a MARS-5 microwave-accelerated system (CEM Corporation) for 20 min or at RT without microwave irradiation for 45 min. Then, the N-terminal residue was deprotected twice with 25% piperidine in DMF (5 mL) for 10 min each at RT. Following deprotection, the resin was washed thoroughly with alternating DMF (5 mL) and DCM (5 mL), three times, and then with DMF (5 mL), six times. Finally, the peptide synthesis vessel was purged with nitrogen and the resin was washed an additional five times with anhydrous DMF (4 mL) under nitrogen atmosphere. Lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl chloride (10 equiv.) was solubilized in anhydrous DMF (3 mL) and added directly to the resin after the final anhydrous DMF wash, followed by the addition of anhydrous DIEA (10 equiv.). The reaction vessel was purged with nitrogen, sealed, and covered with aluminum foil to minimize light exposure. The labeling reaction was occur overnight at RT while shaking .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/374926 doi: bioRxiv preprint S5 on an orbital shaker. After labeling, the resin was washed thoroughly with alternating DMF (10 mL) and DCM (10 mL), three times, then extensively with DMF until no excess lissamine rhodamine B was observed in the wash solution. To shrink the resin, it was washed with MeOH (5 mL) twice. Finally, the resin was dried under a stream of nitrogen overnight.\n\nPeptide Modifications: N-to-C Cyclization. N-to-C cyclized peptide CPP12 (5) was synthesized and purified as described before (7) . Briefly, the cyclization of the peptide was achieved by incorporating a main chain alloc-protected glutamic acid residue at the C-terminus of the peptide. The allyl group was removed selectively by treatment with Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 (0.1 equiv.), phenylsilane (10 equiv.) in anhydrous DCM (three times, 15 min each) releasing the C-terminal carboxylate. After allyl deprotection, the N-terminal Fmoc group was removed with piperidine (25%) in DMF and the peptide was cyclized by treatment with (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) (5 equiv.), HOBt (5 equiv.) and DIEA (10 equiv.) in DMF overnight (16 h).\n\nPeptide Cleavage from Resin. Once peptide synthesis was complete, the resin was washed thoroughly with alternating DMF (10 mL) and DCM (10 mL), three times, and with MeOH (5 mL), after which it was dried overnight under nitrogen. The peptide was cleaved from the resin using 4 mL (per 50 \u03bcmol) of a cocktail containing trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (88%), phenol (5%), water (5%), and triisopropylsilane (TIPS) (2%) for 3 h at RT. For peptides containing cysteines, the cocktail consisted of TFA (81.5%), thioanisole (5%), phenol (5%), water (5%), ethanedithiol (2.5%), and TIPS (1%). SDex-labeled peptides were cleaved with a cocktail consisting of TFA (92.5%), water (2.5%), TIPS (2.5%), and 3,6-dioxa-1,8-octanedithiol (2.5%). Cleaved peptides were precipitated in diethyl ether (40 mL, chilled to -80 \u00b0C), pelleted by centrifugation, redissolved in a mixture of water and acetonitrile (ACN) (max. 20% ACN), frozen, lyophilized to dryness, and reconstituted in 1-2 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) prior to purification by highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\nPeptide Purification by HPLC. Peptide solutions in DMSO were filtered through nylon syringe filters (0.45 \u03bcm, 4 mm from Thermo Fisher Scientific) prior to HPLC purification. All peptides were purified using an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system, a reverse phase Triaryl-C18 (YMC-Triaryl-C18, 150 mm x 10 mm, 5 \u03bcm, 12 nm) column (YMC America, Inc.) and eluent gradients of water in ACN containing 0.1% TFA. Peptides were detected at 214 and 280 nm. For lissamine rhodamine B (R)-and silicon rhodamine (SiR)-labeled peptides were also detected at 560 nm and at 645 nm, respectively. Peptide purity was verified using a Shimadzu Analytical ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (ES Industries, Shimadzu Corporation) and a C8 reverse phase (Sonoma C8(2), 3 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5, 2.1 x 100 mm) or a C18 reverse phase (Agilent Poroshell 120, 2.7 \u03bcm, 4.5 x 50 mm) analytical column. Analytical samples were eluted using solvent gradients of .

The molecular mass of each peptide was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), using a Waters XEVO Q-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 \u03bcm column (for Chemdraw structures and mass spectrometry data of all peptides see Figure S1 and Table S1 , respectively).\n\nPurified, unlabeled peptides containing tyrosine or tryptophan were dissolved in water and the concentration of the solution was determined using the extinction coefficient of the peptide at 280 nm (\u03b5 280 ), which was estimated using the ProtParam peptide properties calculator on the ExPASy Proteomics Server. For SDex-labeled peptides, concentrations were measured using an SDex extinction coefficient of 12,000 cm -1 M -1 at 242 nm in water, as described previously (4, 8) . For R-labeled peptides, the extinction coefficient for lissamine rhodamine B diethylamine was determined in DPBS (pH 7.4) at 25 \u00b0C to be 112,000 \u00b1 2,000 cm -1 M -1 at \u03bb max (569 nm). This extinction coefficient was used for all rhodamine-labeled peptides. For unlabeled cyclic peptide CPP12, the extinction coefficient of naphthylalanine (3,936 cm -1 M -1 at \u03bb max (280 nm)) was used (9) . For SiRlabeled peptides, the reported extinction coefficient was used (1). Purified zinc finger CPMPs (2 UL , 2 Dex , and 2 R ) were dissolved in argon-purged 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4. To reduce cysteines, DTT (2 equiv.) was added and the solution was left to react for 15 min. Then, ZnCl 2 (2 equiv.) was added to the solution to induce the typical zinc finger fold. Zinc finger peptides were stored in solution at 4 \u00b0C. Repeated freeze-thawing cycles of zinc finger and aPP-based miniature proteins were avoided due to peptide aggregation and precipitation. All other peptides (3) (4) (5) were stored as a lyophilized powder or in solution at -20 \u00b0C and tolerated repeated freeze-thaw cycles. All peptides were routinely assessed for identity and purity by LC-MS and UPLC analyses. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Alexa 594 standards and lissamine rhodamine B-labeled peptides were excited at 561 nm, and the fluorescence filters were set to 570-660 nm. Measurements were made in 8-well chambered Lab-Tek 8-well coverglass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #155411). In vitro standards with Alexa 594 were measured at 25 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C in Milli-Q water. In cellulo experiments were performed at 37 \u00b0C in serum-free DMEM without phenol red containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.2). Autocorrelation data were collected over 5-s intervals with 10 repeats. Prior to FCS measurements in cells, the microscope was calibrated using Alexa 594 dye. The coverglass thickness of each 8-well microscopy dish was measured with a digital micrometer (Mitutoyo) to adjust the correction collar of the C-apochromat 40x N1.2 water immersion objective to the correct thickness. The pinhole of the 561 nm laser was aligned in both the x and the y direction. A standard solution of Alexa 594 dye (100 nM) was measured at 37 \u00b0C in the same 8-well coverglass slides used for in cellulo FCS experiments with one well reserved for Alexa 594 standard (no fibronectin coating). Autocorrelations were fit to diffusion equations described below, using custom scripts Matlab (Version R2017a, MathWorks), as described before (5, 10) .\n\nAutocorrelation curves from in vitro measurements were fit to a 3D diffusion equation (Equation 1):\n\nN is the average number of diffusing molecules in the effective confocal volume (V eff ) and \u03c4 diff is the diffusion time, the average time a molecule takes to transit the laser focus. The shape factor S of the effective confocal volume V eff was determined from the fit of the autocorrelation function of Alexa 594 (12.5 nM) in water at 25 \u00b0C (S = 0.2 \u00b1 0.007) and was fixed for all subsequent analyses at S = 0.2.

Autocorrelation curves from in cellulo measurements were fit to an anomalous diffusion model:\n\nG(\u221e) represents the level of background autocorrelation at long time scales and \u03b1 is the anomalous diffusion coefficient, which represents the degree to which diffusion is hindered over long distances (12) .\n\nThe fit autocorrelation traces from live-cell measurements were then evaluated and filtered as described before (5) . Briefly, for follow-up analysis, we selected traces displaying diffusion times (\u03c4 diff ) of up to 10-fold of the observed value for the identical CPMP/CPP in buffer. We discarded traces that displayed poor signal with counts per molecule (cpm) below 1 kHz and/or low anomalous diffusion coefficients (\u03b1 < 0.3) (13). With these parameters, we typically retained at least 75% of the collected data points.\n\nThe theoretical diffusion coefficient of a spherical, globular macromolecule can be determined from its respective molecular weight.

HEK 293T cells (ATCC, CRL-3216) were cultured in complete growth medium (DMEM containing 4.5 g/L glucose, phenol red, 10% FBS, 5 mM sodium pyruvate, without antibiotics). Lentiviral particles were prepared in HEK 293T cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, #L3000) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 293T cells were seeded (1.2 Mio/well) into tissue-culture treated 6-well dishes in 2 mL packaging medium (Opti-MEM I containing 5% FBS and 1 mM sodium pyruvate) and left to adhere overnight. For transfection, a 1:1 mixture of solution A containing Lipofectamine 3000 in Opti-MEM I (250 \u03bcL) and solution B containing P3000 reagent, psPAX2 (3 equiv. 1688 ng/well), pDM2.G packaging plasmids (536 ng/well), and either eGFP-hGal3 or eGFP-hGal8 in pLenti CMV GFP puro plasmids (750 ng/well) in Opti-MEM I (250 \u03bcL), was prepared and incubated for 10 min at RT. The 1:1 mixture was added dropwise to the plated HEK 293T cells (total 500 \u03bcL/well) in 6-well plates. The medium was replaced with packaging medium 6 h after transfection. Lentiviral particles were harvested 24 h after transfection by carefully collecting the 2 mL cell supernatant from each well. Wells were replenished with fresh packaging medium, which was collected a second time 52 h post transfection. All lentivirus-containing fractions were stored at 4 \u00b0C for two days, combined, filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm pore syringe filter, and concentrated using spin-filter concentrators (Amicon Ultra-15, 100 kD MWCO, EMD Millipore, #UFC910024). The concentrated lentiviral stock solutions were split into aliquots and frozen at -80 \u00b0C until used. To determine the viral titer, cells were transduced with increasing amounts of the lentiviral solution and the fluorescence intensity at 509 nm was measured and compared to untreated cells using an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Life Technologies).

Cells were transduced with eGFP-hGal3 or eGFP-hGal8 at a lentiviral particle concentration determined to yield >50% transduced cells as measured by by flow cytometry compared to a mocktransduced cell population. After a 16-h transduction period, the medium was removed, cells were washed with DPBS (2x), and incubated with pre-warmed clear McCoy's 5A medium without phenol red (without FBS, without sodium pyruvate, without P/S) containing medium only (control), Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (16 \u03bcL/mL), LLOMe (1 mM), or CPP/CPMPs 1-5 (600 nM) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Cells were washed with prewarmed DPBS (3x) and incubated with HEPES-containing clear DMEM without phenol red (25 mM HEPES, without P/S, without FBS, without sodium pyruvate) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 , after which they were imaged by confocal microscopy at 37 \u00b0C on a Zeiss laser scanning microscope (LSM 880). For galectin recruitment assays, careful attention was paid not to overexpose cells to allow detection of even small amounts of galectin recruitment to endosomal membranes. The endosomal recruitment coefficient (ERC) was determined by measuring the area of punctate fluorescence in each cell, dividing it by the overall area of the same cell, and then multiplying it by 10,000 ( Figure S2C ) using ImageJ (14) . The ERC represents the %-area of punctate fluorescence in each cell multiplied by 100.\n\nCellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. Saos-2 cells were seeded into 96well plates (Corning, #3603; 3000 cells/well, 100 \u03bcL/well) in complete McCoy's 5A medium without phenol red (10% FBS, without P/S, 1 mM sodium pyruvate) and left to adhere overnight (16 h). The next day, the medium was replaced with clear McCoy's 5A medium without phenol red (100 \u03bcL/well, without FBS, without P/S, without sodium pyruvate) and peptides 1 UL -5 UL were added in triplicate to each well at increasing concentrations (0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 4.8, 9.6, 19.2 \u03bcM). Cells were left to incubate at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 for 4 h. CellTiter-Glo (Promega, #G7571) luminescent substrate was added to each well (50 \u03bcL/well). The plates were orbitally shaken for 15 min and the resulting luminescence was recorded with a Biotek Synergy 2 plate reader.\n\nOne day prior to the experiment, Saos-2 cells were seeded in tissue culture-treated 6-well plates (100,000 cells/well) in complete McCoy's 5A medium without phenol red (2 mL/well, 15% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, without P/S). The day of the experiment, the medium was removed and cells were washed twice with DPBS. Cells were incubated with Lys9 R (600 nM) in clear McCoy's 5A without phenol red (1 mL/well, without FBS, without sodium pyruvate, without P/S) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . While cells were incubating, an 8well microscopy slide (Thermo Scientific, #155411) was coated with fibronectin from bovine plasma in DPBS (1:100 dilution, 200 \u03bcL/well) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C (200 \u03bcL/well). The fibronectin solution was removed by aspiration and the dish was washed with DPBS (3x) before use. After the 30-min incubation period, cells were washed thoroughly with DBPS (3x) and incubated with increasing concentrations of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (0, 4, 8, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/374926 doi: bioRxiv preprint S11 12, 16 \u03bcL/mL medium), LLOMe (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mM), or unlabeled peptides 1 UL -5 UL (300, 600, 1200, 2400 nM) in clear McCoy's 5A without phenol red for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33342 (300 nM) for 5 min at the end of the 1h incubation period by adding the nuclear stain directly to the reagent-containing medium. To remove exogenously bound peptide, cells were washed with DBPS (3x) and treated with TrypLE (500 \u03bcL/well) for 10 min until all cells were lifted from the culture dish. The cells were transferred to 15-mL Falcon tubes, each well was rinsed twice with complete McCoy's 5A without phenol red (twice, 1 mL each), and the cell suspensions, including media used for rinsing, were pooled and pelleted at 200 g for 3 min. The supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in HEPES-containing clear DMEM without phenol red (1 mL, 25 mM HEPES, without FBS, without sodium pyruvate, without P/S) to wash the pellet. The cells were pelleted again at 200 g for 3 min. The supernatant was removed and the cells were resuspended in HEPES-containing clear DMEM without phenol red (600 \u03bcL). Of this suspension, one third (200 \u03bcL) was plated into the prepared fibronectin-coated microscopy dish. The cells were left to adhere at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 for 20 min before FCS experiments were performed.\n\nBefore beginning experiments at the LSM 880, the live-cell chamber was equilibrated to 37 \u00b0C, and the 561-nm (0.5%) laser line was warmed up, both for approximately 30 min. After in vitro calibration with Alexa 594, confocal images of Saos-2 cells were obtained. FCS measurements were obtained by positioning the 561-nm laser's crosshair in the nucleus or the cytosol of Saos-2 cells. A minimum of 20 cells was measured for each experimental condition. To minimize background fluorescence and artifacts from diffusion, the laser's confocal volume was placed in a cytosolic area devoid of bright endosomes. Measurements in the nucleus were less prone to diffusional artifacts. For each FCS measurement, ten consecutive five-second time intervals were recorded. These ten traces were converted to their corresponding autocorrelation curves using a custom Matlab script (5) . Low quality traces were discarded as described above, the remaining traces were averaged, and the averaged trace was fit to an anomalous diffusion model (Equation 6 ). From the fit of the averaged autocorrelation curve, we obtained the number of Lys9 R molecules in the focal volume of the laser. This number of Lys9 R molecules was converted to the effective cytosolic or nuclear Lys9 R concentration using the laser's measured focal volume, as described in equations 2-5 above. Evaluation of the correlation curves revealed that cells generally displayed wide variation in the maximal autocorrelation signal, indicating an equally wide variation in the concentration of each molecule in the cytosol.\n\nExcept for two modifications, the same experimental protocol was followed as for the experiment with labeled Lys9 R , described above. Instead of Lys9 R , cells were incubated with or without Lys9 UL (600 nM), and instead of unlabeled peptides 1-5, cells were incubated with RhoB-tagged peptides 1 R -5 R (300, 600, 1200, 2400 nM) ( Figure S4A ).

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/374926 doi: bioRxiv preprint S12 Cytosolic Fractionation to Quantify Cytosolic Access of D-Arg8 R (4 R ) and CPP12 R (5 R ). When we incubated Saos-2 cells with D-Arg8 R (4 R ) and CPP12 R (5 R ), and performed FCS experiments similar to the ones described above, we observed in cellulo diffusion times that were more than 25 times longer compared to diffusion times commonly observed for aPP5.3 R (1 R ), ZF5.3 R (2 R ), or SAH-p53-8 R (3 R ) (Table S2 and Figure S4B ). An increase in diffusion time may be a sign of supramolecular aggregation or binding to intracellular factors, which renders FCS data analysis impossible. Therefore, we turned to our previously described cytosolic fractionation assay to calculate the cytosolic concentration of 4 R and 5 R relative to 2 R . We performed the same incubation protocol as described for the Lys9 FCS-based assays above, but with a larger population of Saos-2 cells. One day prior to the experiment, Saos-2 cells were plated in tissue culture-treated 100-mm dishes (1.5 x 10 6 cells/dish) in complete McCoy's 5A without phenol red (5 mL/dish, 15% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, without P/S). The next day, the medium was removed and cells were washed twice with DPBS. The cells were incubated with or without Lys9 UL (600 nM) in clear McCoy's 5A without phenol red (5 mL/well, without FBS, without sodium pyruvate, without P/S) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . After the 30-min incubation, cells were washed thoroughly with DBPS (3x), and incubated with increasing concentrations of RhoB-tagged peptides 1 R -5 R (300, 600, 1200, 2400 nM) in clear McCoy's 5A medium without phenol red for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . To remove exogenously bound peptide, cells were washed with DBPS (3x) and treated with TrypLE (1 mL/dish) for 10 min until all cells were lifted from the culture dish. Cells were transferred to 15-mL Falcon tubes, each well was rinsed twice with complete McCoy's 5A without phenol red (twice, 1 mL each), and the cell suspensions, including the media used for rinsing, were pooled and pelleted at 200 g for 3 min. The cells were washed with DPBS (1 mL) twice and pelleted at 200 g for 3 min. The cells were resuspended in 1 mL pre-cooled buffered isotonic sucrose buffer (290 mM sucrose, 10 imidazole pH 7.0, added immediately prior to use: 1 mM DTT and 1 cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail per 10 mL buffer). A 20-uL aliquot was removed for counting, then the suspension was pelleted again at 200 g for 3 min. Saos-2 cells were counted using an automated cell counter (Auto T4, Cellometer). The supernatant was removed and cells were suspended in pre-cooled buffered isotonic sucrose to reach a concentration of 10,000 cells/\u03bcL. For each experimental condition, 1.5 x 10 6 cells were suspended in 150 \u03bcL isotonic sucrose, transferred to a 0.5-mL microtube containing 1.4mm ceramic beads (Omni International, #19-626), and stored on ice for transport. Cells were homogenized using a Bead Ruptor 4 (Omni International) at speed 1 for 10 seconds. The homogenized cells were transferred to Beckman polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tubes (0.2 mL, Beckman Coulter, #343775) and sedimented using a Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge at 350 Kg for in an ultracentrifuge (TL-100; Beckman Coulter) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C using a TLA-100 rotor (20 x 0.2 mL). The supernatant (= cytosolic fraction) was analyzed in a 96-well plate (NBS-treated, low-protein binding, Corning, #3651) on a fluorescence plate reader (infinite F500, Tecan) with excitation at 535 \u00b1 25 nm and an .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/374926 doi: bioRxiv preprint emission at 590 \u00b1 20 nm. The concentration of the protein conjugate in the cytosol was calculated using a calibration curve. For the calibration curve, known concentrations of peptides 2 R , 4 R , and 5 R between 1.0 and 1000.0 nM were added to cytosolic extracts of the untreated negative control cells. For background subtraction, several wells containing cytosolic extracts from untreated cells were averaged. The average background was subtracted from each well.\n\nScreen Optimization: Seeding Density and Growth Medium. To evaluate the effect of seeding density and the choice of RNAi growth medium on the TR of Saos-2(GIGT) cells, Saos-2(GIGT) cells were plated at various seeding densities in either 50 \u03bcL of complete growth medium (McCoy's 5A, with pen/strep, 15% FBS) or transfection medium (complete growth medium/Opti-MEM/RNAi duplex buffer, 3:1:1) in 384-well plates (#1052, Nexus Biosystems). Saos-2(GIGT) cells were allowed to adhere and remain in the respective media for 48 h, after which the cells were serum-starved overnight (16 h), by replacing the media with 40 \u03bcL of serum-free DMEM. The following morning, cells were treated with DMEM containing either 1 \u03bcM Dex or Dex-peptide conjugate (1 Dex or 2 Dex ) for 30 min, after which cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT, stained with the nuclear stain Hoechst 33342 (300 nM) for 20 min at RT, and imaged on an Opera high-throughput imaging system. Control cells containing no peptide were treated with media only. Robust TRs between 3.5-4.0 were detected for Dex-treated cells under all plating densities and media tested. For 1 Dex and 2 Dex , TRs were higher in transfection media (around 3.0 for both) compared to complete media (around 2.0 for both). For RNAi screening, 2,500 cells per well were plated in transfection medium, as these conditions resulted in a high number of cells per well (150-250 per image) without overcrowding and the highest TRs for Dex alone (TR = 3.4 \u00b1 0.40), dex-peptide conjugates 1 Dex (TR = 3.0 \u00b1 0.40), and 2 Dex (TR = 3.0 \u00b1 0.090) ( Figure S5B ).\n\nRNAi screening was performed in 384-well format. To each well, siRNA duplex buffer (10 \u03bcL) with or without siRNA (20 nM), Opti-MEM (10 \u03bcL) containing Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (0.1 \u03bcL), and Saos-2(GIGT) cells (2500 per well) in complete McCoy's 5A medium without phenol red (30 \u03bcL per well, 10% FBS, without antibiotics) were added using a Multidrop Combi reagent dispenser (Thermo Scientific). The outer four columns of each 384-well plate contained experimental controls, while the inner 20 columns contained variable siRNAs, with 4 duplexes targeting a single gene within each well (SMARTpool siRNA). Background GR*eGFP translocation ratios (TRs) were determined from column 24, which contained untreated GR*eGFP cells transfected with RISC-Free non-targeting siRNA, while 1 Dex TRs were represented in columns 2 and 23. Plate-wide transfection efficiency was determined from column 1, which contained alternating buffer-only and Kif11 siRNA control wells. Knockdown of Kif11 results in mitotic arrest, phenotypically observable enlarged nuclei, and dead cells (15) . The significant loss in S14 cell number upon Kif11 transfection, relative to RISC-Free transfection, is commonly used as a measure of siRNA transfection efficiency during high-throughput screens. In a pilot screen, we identified that siRNAs targeting the SYNJ2BP gene enhanced GR*eGFP translocation in the presence of 1 Dex and yields a hit-like phenotype. We therefore included SYNJ2BP siRNA in columns 2 and 23 of every plate, to provide a representation of a hit candidate. Cells were reverse-transfected as follows: siRNA (20 nM) in sterile duplex buffer (10 \u03bcL) were first dispensed into each well, followed by Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (0.1 \u03bcL) in Opti-MEM (10 \u03bcL). After siRNAs and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX were allowed to complex for 20 min, Saos-2(GIGT) cells in McCoy's 5A without phenol red (30 \u03bcL, 10% FBS, without antibiotics) were dispensed into each well. Saos-2(GIGT) cells were allowed to settle for 30 min at RT, prior to placement into a 37 \u00b0C humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 for 56 h. After 56 h of reverse-transfection, cells were serum-starved for 16 h by replacing the media in each well with McCoy's 5A medium, without phenol red (30 \u03bcL, without FBS, without antibiotics).\n\nHigh-Content Imaging of Saos-2(GIGT) Cells. After serum starvation, 10 \u03bcL clear McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with ligand at 5X concentration was overlaid onto wells, and Saos-2(GIGT) cells were incubated in the presence of Dex-peptide conjugates for 30 min. Following treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT, washed twice with DPBS, stained with Hoechst 33342 (300 nM) for 45 min at RT, washed twice more, and imaged on an Opera high-throughput spinning disk confocal microscope.\n\nNext, the reproducibility of GIGT assay was tested across two identical panels of 320 siRNAs targeting genes across the Dharmacon Human Genome Library. Non-treated Saos-2(GIGT) cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA displayed a mean TR of 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 while identical cells treated with 1 \u03bcM 1 Dex for 30 min displayed a mean TR of 2.4 \u00b1 0.3. Across a panel of 320 test siRNAs, this system yielded a mean signal-tobackground of 2.3, coefficient of variation (CV) of 11.2%, Z-factor of 0.30, and Pearson R correlation coefficient of 0.80 between two replicate plates ( Figure S5C ). Collectively, these results underscore the adequacy of the GIGT system towards high-content RNAi screening.\n\nScreening system: Opera (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences) using a 20x 0.45 NA lens. GR*-eGFP fluorescence was detected using a solid state 488 nm laser and a 540/75 band-pass filter, while Hoechst 33342 was detected using a 405 nm laser and a 450/50 band-pass filter. Three images were taken per well, and each image typically contained ~200-300 cells. GR*-eGFP TRs were determined using Acapella high content imaging and analysis software (Perkin Elmer). S15 treated with 1 \u03bcM 1 Dex and negative cells transfected with RISC-Free and left untreated, which was calculated using Equation 9 :\n\nWhere \u03bc + and \u03c3 + refer to the mean and standard deviation of Saos-2(GIGT) cells transfected with RISC-Free siRNA and treated with 1 \u03bcM 1 Dex , while \u03bcand \u03c3refer to the mean and standard deviation of nontreated cells transfected with RISC-Free nontargeting siRNA.\n\nRNAi Translocation Data Normalization. Raw TRs were converted to normalized percent effect values using Equation 10 . Data were normalized with respective controls per-plate (16) .\n\nWhere X i is the mean GR*-eGFP TR of the respective RNAi knockdown, \u03bc + is the mean TR of cells transfected with RISC-Free siRNA and treated with 1 \u03bcM 1 Dex and \u03bcis the mean TR of nontreated cells transfected with RISC-Free siRNA. The normalized %effect of Saos-2(GIGT) cells transfected with RISC-Free siRNA and treated 1 \u03bcM 1 Dex was defined as 0%, while that of nontreated Saos-2(GIGT) cells transfected with RISC-Free siRNA was defined as 100%.\n\nCalculation of Z-Score. The Z-score, or the number of standard deviations between each knockdown and the mean TR of Saos-2(GIGT) cells transfected with RISC-Free siRNA and treated with 1 \u03bcM 1 Dex (\u03bc + ), were calculated using Equation 11 :\n\nWhere \u03bc + is the mean TR of Saos-2(GIGT) cells transfected with RISC-Free siRNA and treated with 1 \u03bcM 1 Dex , and \u03c3 + is the standard deviation of this population. \u03bc x refers to the mean TR of the respective RNAi knockdown.\n\nTo assign hits within the data set, normalized %-effect values from triplicate knockdowns were converted to strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD or \u03b2) values with Equation 12 (17) : McCoy's 5A medium without phenol red (1 mL/well, without FBS, without sodium pyruvate, without P/S) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 followed by a 1-h chase period in dextran-free McCoy's 5A medium. While cells were incubating, an 8-well microscopy slide (Thermo Scientific, #155411) was coated with fibronectin from bovine plasma in DPBS (1:100 dilution, 200 \u03bcL/well) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C (200 \u03bcL/well). The fibronectin solution was removed by aspiration and the dish was washed with DPBS (3x) before use. During the hour-long chase period, cells were rinsed with DPBS (3x) and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (300 nM) for 5 min. To remove exogenously bound dextran, cells were then washed with DBPS (3x) and treated with TrypLE (500 \u03bcL/well) for 10 min until all cells were lifted from the culture dish. Cells were transferred to 15-mL Falcon tubes, each well was rinsed twice with complete McCoy's 5A without phenol red (twice, 1 mL each), and the cell suspensions, including media used for rinsing, were pooled and pelleted at 200 g for 3 min. The supernatant was removed and cells were re-suspended in HEPES-containing clear DMEM without phenol red (1 mL, 25 mM HEPES, without FBS, without sodium pyruvate, without P/S) to wash the pellet. Of this suspension, half (300 \u03bcL) was plated into the prepared fibronectin-coated microscopy dish. Cells were left to adhere at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 for the remainder of the hour-long chase period at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Cells were then incubated in a 1:2600 dilution of Magic Red Cathepsin B substrate (ImmunoChemistry Technologies, #937) in clear DMEM without phenol red for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Cell images were recorded on an LSM 880 microscope. The degree of colocalization of two channels reflecting the fraction of dextran Alexa Fluor 488 colocalizing with Magic Red was measured by Pearson correlation coefficient (19) using ImageJ software (version 1.48s, NIH).

To remove exogenously bound CPMPs, cells were washed with DBPS (3x) and treated with TrypLE (500 \u03bcL/well) for 10 min until all cells were lifted from the culture dish. Cells were transferred to 15-mL Falcon tubes, each well from the tissue culture dish was rinsed twice with complete McCoy's 5A media without phenol red (twice, 1 mL each), and the cell suspensions including media used for rinsing were combined and pelleted at 200 g for 3 min. The supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in HEPEScontaining clear DMEM without phenol red (1 mL, 25 mM HEPES, without FBS, without sodium pyruvate, without P/S) to wash the pellet. Of this suspension, half (300 \u03bcL) was plated into the prepared fibronectin-coated microscopy dish. To enlarge Rab7 +endosomes, Saos-2 cells were incubated with YM201636 (800 nM) in clear DMEM without phenol red for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Cell images were recorded on an LSM 880 microscope (Zeiss) using the following imaging settings: Hoechst excitation: 405 nm (Diode 405-30 laser) and emission: 410-496 nm. eGFP excitation: 488 nm (Argon laser), emission: 490-526 nm. Lissamine RhoB excitation: 561 nm (DPSS 561-10 laser), emission: 570-607 nm. Silicon rhodamine excitation: 633 nm (HeNe633 laser), emission 650-747 nm. The degree of colocalisation of two channels was measured by Pearson r correlation coefficient (19) using ImageJ software (version 1.48s, NIH).\n\nAll the data were presented as mean \u00b1 standard error from at least three independent trials.

(C) Procedure for calculating an endosomal recruitment coefficient (ERC). In the example shown, Saos-2 cells expressing eGFP-hGal3 were treated with LLOMe (1 mM) for 1 hour to induce endolysosomal damage. Before LLOMe treatment, cells displayed diffuse cytosolic eGFP-hGal3 fluorescence. After LLOMe treatment, the eGFP-hGal3 fluorescence became predominantly punctate. To calculate the ERC, we measured the area (A) of each cell in the bright field channel using ImageJ. Second, we manually set a threshold to mark vesicular structures and generated a binary image thereof. Third, we measured the area of the punctate vesicles (V). Lastly, the ERC was calculated as the ratio of V over A multiplied by a factor of 10 4 . We routinely obtained ERC values around 0.0 in untreated cells and 400.0 in LLOMe-treated cells, which corresponds to 0% and 4% vesicular staining compared to the total cell area.

FCS data was obtained using a commercial Zeiss LSM 880 microscope. Images of cells were acquired in the x-y plane, and the laser's crosshair (= confocal volume) was placed in the nucleus or cytosol of cells, avoiding areas with high, punctate endosomal signal. Fluorescent fluctuations over time were recorded on a GaAsP detector and traces were converted to autocorrelation curves using a custom MATLAB script. Individual autocorrelation traces were averaged prior to fitting to a 3D diffusion model containing parameters for anomalous diffusion and background autocorrelation as described in LaRochelle et al., 2015. The fitted data points were assessed individually and filtered for data quality by evaluating diffusion time (\u03c4), signal intensity, and the anomalous diffusion coefficient (\u03b1). The inflection point of the autocorrelation fit is proportional to the cubic root of the molecular mass. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Control experiments to support and accompany Figure S3 .\n\n(A) To investigate the effects of Lys9 on the intracellular delivery of peptides 1-5, we incubated Saos-2 cells that had been pre-treated with or without unlabeled Lys9 (Lys9 UL ) (600 nM) with Lissamine Rhodamine B (RhoB)-tagged peptides 1 R -5 R (300, 600, and .

We were unable to perform FCS experiments at CPMP/CPP concentrations above 1200 nM because the concentration of fluorescent molecules in the confocal volume was too high-especially for CPMP 2 R and hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 3 R -to obtain satisfactory fits to their corresponding autocorrelation curves. For FCS, concentrations were calculated for n cells in the cytosol (Cyt) and nucleus (Nuc) and error bars represent the standard error of the mean. For fractionation, concentrations were calculated for n biological replicates of 1.5 x 10 6 homogenized cells and normalized to an equal population of cells treated with 2 R at the same concentration. The cytosolic concentration of 2 R is known because it was measured using FCS. For fractionation, nuclear concentrations are not available (N/A). The delivery efficiency (DE) is the ratio of the measured intracellular (Cyt or Nuc) Lys9 R concentration to the Lys9 R incubation concentration (600 nM) multiplied by 100%. (B) Representative traces of unusually long diffusion times observed for CPP12 R (4 R ) and D-Arg8 R (5 R ) in live cells. Saos-2 cells were treated with 4 R or 5 R (600 nM) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Then, cells were lifted with TripLE Express, washed, pelleted, and re-plated in a glass microscopy slide for FCS measurements. N: number of molecules detected in the confocal volume. (A) Overview of the glucocorticoid-induced eGFP translocation (GIGT) assay. Saos-2 cells stably expressing GR(C638G)-eGFP (= GR*-eGFP) were treated with dexamethasone (Dex) or a Dex-labeled peptide to induce the nuclear translocation of GR*-eGFP. The extent of nuclear translocation was quantified by a translocation ratio (TR), defined as the ratio of the nuclear to cytoplasmic (N/C) signal due to GR*-eGFP as determined using fluorescence microscopy and high content image analysis software (CellProfiler35 and Acapella). (B) Optimization of seeding density and RNAi growth medium in Saos-2(GIGT) cells. Saos-2(GIGT) cells were plated at various seeding densities in either complete growth medium (McCoy's 5A, with pen/strep, 15% FBS) or transfection medium (complete growth medium/Opti-MEM/RNAi duplex buffer, 3:1:1). After 72 h, cells were treated with DMEM containing either 1 \u03bcM Dex or a CPMP-Dex conjugate (1 Dex or 2 Dex ) for 30 min, after which cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, stained with Hoechst 33342, and imaged on an Opera High Content Screening System. Control cells (Non) were treated with media only. The RNAi screen was performed using 2,500 cells per well plated in transfection medium, as these conditions resulted in a high .

(C) Reproducibility of a RNAi pilot screen of 320 randomly chosen, duplicate siRNAs from the Dharmacon Human siGENOME siRNA Library (SMARTpool). Across this siRNA test panel, the GIGT system yielded a mean signal-to-background ratio of 2.3, coefficient of variation (CV) of 11.2%, Z-factor (Z') of 0.3, and Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) of 0.8. (A) RT-qPCR to confirm gene knockdown: Saos-2 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and siGENOME SMARTpool siRNAs (Dharmacon). Total RNA was extracted 72 h (unless noted otherwise) after transfection. RNA was reversetranscribed with gene-specific primers according to the manufacturer's protocol. For RT-qPCR, cDNA was amplified using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix assay. Each biological replicate was run in triplicate, and assayed for both the siRNA-targeted gene and GAPDH (endogenous reference gene). (B) Negative transfection controls for FC and FCS. Saos-2 cells were transfected with siGENOME SMARTpool siRNAs (Dharmacon) for 72 hours according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were treated with CPMP 2 R (600 nM) for 30 minutes and exogenously bound peptide was removed with TrypLE Express. Whole-cell fluorescence intensities were measured by FC and cytosolic and nuclear concentrations were measured by FCS in untreated (without Lipofectamine RNAiMAX, without siRNA) cells, in cells treated with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX, in cells treated with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and a non-targeting (RISC-Free) siRNA, and in cells treated with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and an siRNA against the GAPD housekeeping gene. No significant differences were detected among all controls.

Saos-2 cells were transduced with Rab5-, Rab7-, or Lamp1-GFP for 18 h using CellLight Reagents (BacMam 2.0). To label ILVs, cells were incubated with N-Rh-PE (5 \u03bcM) for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. Cells were washed and incubated with CPMP 2 SiR (600 nM) for 30 min and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (300 nM) for 5 min. Cells were trypsinized and re-plated into microscopy slides, after which they were incubated in media with or without YM201636 (800 nM) for 1 hour.
