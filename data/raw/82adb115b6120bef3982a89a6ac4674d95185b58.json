{"title": "Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic", "body": "We consider the standard susceptible-infected-removed/recovered (SIR) epidemic model [1, 2] to represent the current covid-19 pandemic:\n\nwhere the parameter k characterises the probability of transmission of infection from the infected (I) to the susceptible (S) fraction of the population, and \u03b3 is the rate of recovery, which is assumed to lead to immunity or death; see Fig. 1 (a). The behavior of the model depends on a single nondimensional parameter R 0 = k/\u03b3 which is the number of new infections caused by a single infected in a fully susceptible population. The condition for an epidemic outbreak is R 0 > 1 otherwise the infection dies out monotonously. Typical estimates of R 0 for the covid epidemic are roughly in the range 1.5 \u2212 3.5 [3] [4] [5] . We will use \u03b3 = 0.1 consistent with a typical recovery time of around 1 \u2212 2 weeks [3] [4] [5] . A few example solutions of the model (1) for different values of R 0 are shown in Fig. 1 (b).\n\nThe so called \"social distancing\" strategy aims to reduce social interactions within the population decreasing the probability of transmission of the infection, represented by the parameter k in the model. A strong reduction of social interactions may thus lead to R 0 < 1 when the infection dies out monotonously, or otherwise, when the reduced R 0 is still larger than unity, it leads to a reduction of the total infected fraction of the population I total = 1 \u2212 S(\u221e), and a lower peak infected fraction. A side effect of this reduction, however, is that the duration of the epidemic outbreak increases significantly. The dependence of the peak infected fraction and the time to maximum infected are shown in Fig. 1 (c). The total infected fraction at the end of the epidemic as a function of R 0 is shown in Fig. 1(d) . For example, starting with a reference value R 0 = 2.4 with time to peak infection around 65 days, reducing R 0 by factor 2 to R 0 = 1.2, extends the time to peak infection to \u223c 320 days, while reducing the maximum infected fraction from \u223c 22% to \u223c 1.5% and the total infected by the end of the epidemic decreases from \u223c 90% to \u223c 30%. Why reducing R 0 by social distancing reduces total infections and the peak infected fraction, which is critical due to the limited hospital infrastructure, (or termination of the epidemic if R 0 < 1) it has the following possible problems:\n\n\u2022 since the Covid-19 infection results in mild or no symptoms in a large majority of the population and often remains undetected it is difficult to prevent further transmission (this may be one of the reasons why drastic social distancing introduced in Western Europe had limited success so far)\n\n\u2022 if R 0 remains > 1 the social distancing can significantly extend the duration of the epidemic making it difficult to maintain the reduced transmissions over a long time period in a large population\n\n\u2022 perhaps the most important problem is that there is no clear exit strategy until large scale vaccination becomes available. Since at the end of the epidemic a large proportion of the population remains susceptible to infection, after relaxation of social distancing, the population is highly susceptible to recurrent epidemic outbreaks due to remaining undetected or imported infections from other regions/countries where the infection has not been eliminated yet\n\n\u2022 social distancing measures over extended period of time applied uniformly to a large population leads to widespread disruption of the functioning of the society and economy therefore it has a huge long term cost\n\nTo address these issues we consider an alternative or complementary strategy. An essential feature of the Covid-19 epidemic is that it produces mild transient symptoms in the large majority of the population (around \u223c 95%) comparable to the usual flu, while it leads to very serious respiratory problems mainly in the older population (> 70), or in younger individuals with serious pre-existing chronic diseases [6] To take into account the markedly different age-dependent outcome of the Covid-19 infection we extend the standard SIR model by separating the population into two compartments: the majority population with mild symptoms, and a vulnerable older population where infection is likely to lead to hospitalization and death. Both sub-populations follow the SIR dynamics with the important difference that while in the majority population the infections are primarily caused by transmission within this subpopulation from infected to susceptible individuals; in the vulnerable minority the dominant route is via transmission from infected in the majority population to susceptible vulnerable. (We neglect transmission within the vulnerable population and the infection of majority susceptible due to infected vulnerable) See diagram in Fig. 1(a) .\n\nThus the majority population follows the same SIR dynamics (1) as described above independently of the vulnerable population. The infection rate of the vulnerable population is described by\n\nwhere the parameter \u00b5 represents the rate of transmission from infected individuals of the majority population (I) to vulnerable susceptible population (S V ). Thus the relative proportion of newly infected vulnerable individuals (requiring hospitalization and possibility of death) per unit time is determined by the product \u00b5I(t).\n\nWe can calculate the proportion of the vulnerable population infected over the whole course of the epidemic as\n\nAccording to (3) reducing the loss in S V requires reducing the product \u00b5I total . While social distancing aims to reduce the total infected by decreasing R 0 (see continuous curve showing I total vs R 0 in Fig. 1D ), this model highlights the possibility of an alternative or complementary measure based on reducing the parameter \u00b5 by isolating/shielding the vulnerable population from infections in the majority population. This could be achieved by targeted measures providing free homedelivery of food, medication etc. combined with targeted support addressing communication and healthcare needs, support with creating separated living space where needed. Since the isolation strategy targets a small portion of the population which is less socially active and has a low participation in the economy, a radical isolation is likely to be much more efficient than uniform social distancing, with smaller cost for the economy and the functioning of the society.\n\nIt is also apparent that the integral in (3) can be reduced by decreasing \u00b5 in a time-dependent manner. This can be linked to monitoring the progression of the infection I(t) by statistically representative testing of different regions and cities, and intensifying/relaxing the isolation of the vulnerable population accordingly. According to our model the social distancing (represented by the horizontal arrow in Fig. 1(d) ) and targeted isolation (vertical arrow in Fig. 1(d) ) could be used together in combination to reduce the overall death and hospitalisation rate. However, social distancing extends the duration of the epidemic (which may affect the sustainability of efficient isolation) and results in insufficient overall immunity of the majority population against a recurrence of the epidemic outbreak triggered by hidden or newly imported infection. On the other hand when the strategy is primarily based on drastic targeted isolation over a shorter time, the end result is a collectively immune population resistant to further infections. Therefore, when targeted isolation is implemented with high efficiency, it is preferable to avoid or apply moderate social distancing only to allow a large proportion of the majority population to become infected and develop immunity, at the cost of mostly minor symptoms similarly to a conventional flu season.\n\nOur model and conclusions relies on the separation of the population based on age and health into two compartments with very different outcomes. Of course there could be a certain grey area where the separation between the two subpopulations is not always clear. In this case the separation should be determined as a usual trade-off between resources available and risk. The immunity may not be complete but from the limited information currently available on Covid-19, it appears to be fairly robust. In the absence of alternative options available the development of population level immunity could be the optimal resolution of the global pandemic at least in regions where the infection is already widespread, e.g. in Western Europe. Some countries, for example Italy and Spain, implemented severe social distancing, but so far seems to be unable to stop the progress of the epidemic and may in fact be on track towards achieving large scale immunity in the population. However, with too much focus on the implementation of uniform social distancing and no clear targeted measures for identifying and efficiently protecting the vulnerable sub-population can lead to a very dangerous scenario with high mortality in spite of the high social and economic costs of an extended and potentially recurrent epidemic.
