{"title": "The expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens in the brain differs markedly in acute and persistent infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)", "body": "Infections of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) provide useful models for virus-induced neurologic disease (Buchmeier et al., 1980; Lehmann-Grube, 1984; Oldstone et al., 1985 Oldstone et al., , 1986 . In immunocompetent mice, intracranial inoculation of LCMV leads to an acute fatal neurologic illness which is dependent on LCMV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) (Cole et Correspondence to: L. Mucke, Division of Virology, Department of Neuropharmacology, The Scripps Research Institute, 10666 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA. al., 1972; Zinkernagel and Doherty, 1973; Dixon et al., 1987; Klavinskis et al., 1989) . Inoculation of LCMV into neonatal or immunosuppressed mice, on the other hand, establishes a persistent infection in which viral antigens are expressed but not detected by host CTL (Hotchin and Cinits, 1958; Gilden et al., 1972; Mires and Blanden, 1972) . The recognition of viruses, such as LCMV, by CTL is critically dependent on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (Doherty and Zinkernagel, 1974; Doherty, 1974, 1983) . The level of MHC class I expression by infected cells correlates with the degree of effectiveness of CTL-mediated lysis (Plata et al., 1981; Flyer et al., 1985; Gairin et al., 1991; Joly et al., 1991) . While in the normal CNS only low levels of MHC class I antigens are found, MHC class I expression can be upmodufated on some brain cells by cytokines and viruses (Wong et al., 1984; Main et al., 1985; Lampson and Hickey, 1986; Suzumura et al., 1986 Suzumura et al., , 1988 Hickey and Kimura, 1987; Joly et al., 1991) . The current paper compares amount and distribution of MHC class I molecules, inflammatory infiltrates and viral antigens in brains of mice with acute and persistent LCMV infections to assess the roles of these factors in immune-mediated neurologic disease and viral persistence.\n\nTwenty-four 3-to 4-month-old immunocompetent C57BL/6 (H-2 b) and C3H (H-2 k) mice were untreated or inoculated intracranially (i.c.) with 30 Ixl of: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), or 1000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the Armstrong CA 1371 clone 53B of LCMV (Dutko and Oldstone, 1983) in medium or LCMV inactivated by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and heating. Total body irradiation (900 rads) from a cobalt source given just before i.c. inoculations was used to suppress CTL responses in eight C57BL/6 mice. Each experimental paradigm was tested on groups of 3-4 mice. Typical signs of acute LCMV infection developed in non-irradiated mice inoculated with live virus after 5-6 days whereas none of the other mice showed signs of illness. All mice were killed 6-7 days after the acute i.c. inoculations together with three age-matched C57BL/6 mice persistently infected with LCMV by i.c. inoculation at birth (Oldstone et al., 1986) . Serial cryostat-cut sections of snap-frozen brains (10 txm) were air-dried at room temperature (RT) for 1 h, fixed in ice-cold acetone for 10 min and stored at 4\u00b0C overnight. Subsequent incubations and washes were carried out at RT in 2% fetal bovine serum/1 \u00d7 PBS (pH 7.3). After 30 rain of incubation in buffer alone sections were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h: mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) B22-249. R1 directed against D b (Lemke et al., 1979 ) (dilution 1 : 50) or mouse mAb 1-1.3 specific for LCMV nucleoprotein (Buchmeier et al., 1981) (dilution 1:100). This was followed by a 1 h incubation with peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse IgG2a secondary antibodies (Bioproducts for Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) at a 1:200 dilution. Sections were developed with HzOz/diaminobenzidine (DAB) for 10-15 min and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin.\n\nIn unmanipulated and sham-injected (uninfected) C57BL/6 mice (H-2 b) only low levels of MHC class I were identified in restricted brain regions. Specifically, faint immunostaining of cell surfaces for D b was seen in choroid plexus, meninges and blood vessel walls but not on neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or microglia. No inflammatory infiltrates or immunostaining for LCMV antigens were found in the brains of control animals. Mice infected acutely by i.c. inoculation with LCMV showed dense inflammatory infiltrates of the meninges ( Fig. 1A and C) . Inflammatory cells were also seen along the ependymal lining of the ventricles and around the choroid plexus. The brain parenchyma showed no obvious abnormalities. Viral antigens were identified in the choroid plexus, the meninges, the ependymal epithelium and in some of the inflammatory cells that infiltrated these structures (Fig.  1B) . These findings are all consistent with previous observations (Gilden et al., 1972; Walker et al., 1975; Doyle and Oldstone, 1978) .\n\nImmunostaining for D b in the acute infection revealed a substantial increase in the expression of MHC class I over control levels in specific sites. Intense O b expression was found in choroid plexus, meninges and ventricular ependyma as well as on the cells that comprised the inflammatory infiltrates whereas no increase in MHC class I expression was found within the brain parenchyma ( Fig. IC and D) . In some areas a close topologic overlap was documented between the expression of viral antigens and host MHC class I molecules in adjacent sections ( Fig. 1B  and D) .\n\nTotal body irradiation prevented the marked increase in MHC class I expression, the neurologic illness and the inflammatory infiltrates that were seen in acutely infected immunocompetent mice whereas the amount of viral antigen in irradiated and non-irradiated mice was similar (Table 1 ). This suggests that the upmodulation of MHC class I by acutely infected host cells is induced primarily by the cellular immune response rather than directly by the LCMV infection itself. It is tempting to speculate that the increased MHC class I expression is mediated by cytokines released from infiltrating immune cells.\n\nThe increased expression of MHC molecules by acutely infected cells would be expected to enhance their interaction with immune cells and may contribute to the immunopathology. In brains of mice persistently infected with LCMV no inflammatory cells were found despite the presence of LCMV antigens in most brain regions. Consistent with previous observations (Buchmeier et al., 1980; Rodriguez et al., 1983) LCMV antigens were seen primarily in cells with neuronal morphology. In some cases LCMV antigen was also found in cells of the choroid plexus and the ventricular ependyma confirming earlier results (Gilden et al., 1972; Lampert and Oldstone, 1974; Fazakerley et al., 1991) . In contrast to the acute infection, in which LCMV antigens co-localized with upmodulation of D b, the presence of LCMV antigens was not accompanied by focal increases in the expression of host MHC class I molecules ( Fig. 1E and F) .\n\nLCMV can be cleared from the brain parenchyma of persistently infected mice by adoptive transfer of LCMV-specific CTL from immunocompetent H-2 matched donors (Oldstone et al., 1986) . However, this clearance is not accompanied by inflammatory infiltrates and there is no evidence that LCMV-infected neurons can be lysed by LCMV-specific CTL in vivo (Klavinskis et al., 1989; Joly et al., 1991) . In vitro LCMV-infected neuronal cells can be lysed by LCMV-specific CTL but only after treatment with interferon-y or following expression of exogenous MHC class I . Our current results suggest that LCMV infection by itself does not induce detectable MHC class I expression on neuronal cells in vivo. Why LCMV-infected neurons fail to express MHC class I molecules in vivo is unclear. While activated T cells are able to traverse the blood-brain barrier (Wekerle et al., 1986 (Wekerle et al., , 1987 they may not be able to interact with infected neurons in sufficient numbers because of the relatively sheltered location of neurons within the neuropil. It is also possible that other brain cells, such as astrocytes, produce factors that interfere with MHC induction on neurons. Further, differentiated neurons in vivo may be inherently unable to express MHC class I at significant levels as suggested by recent studies on cultured neuronal cells . This may provide a selective advantage by excluding these irreplaceable cells from destruction by CTL. The escape of neurons from CTL surveillance would, however, also allow non-lyric viruses to persist in neurons over the animal's life span. Results reflect immunocytochemical findings in brain sections from 3-month-old female C57BL/6 mice (n = 4/group for Nos. 1-3; n-3/group for No. 4). (+) Dense immunostaining by peroxidase reaction (see brown labeling in Fig. 1B-E) . (-) No immunostaining above background levels (see Fig. 1A and F). Groups 1-3 were acutely inoculated as adults whereas group 4 was persistently infected at birth. Mice were killed for histologic analysis 7 days after the acute i.c. inoculations. At this time all mice in group 1 were ill, whereas all the other mice appeared normal. "}
