{"title": "Neutrophils and viral-induced neurologic disease", "body": "Intracranial infection of susceptible mice with the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) causes an acute encephalomyelitis followed by a chronic demyelinating disease similar to the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Early following JHMV infection of the CNS, the virus targets ependymal cells lining the ventricles, replicates, and rapidly disseminates into the brain parenchyma at which point the virus infects and replicates within astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and microglia throughout the brain and spinal cord [45] . In response to viral infection of glial cells, a rapid and orchestrated expression of chemokines occurs that contribute to attracting inflammatory cells into the CNS. In terms of host defense, secretion of chemokines derived from the CNS, including CXCL10 and CCL5, promote the migration and accumulation of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that control viral replication via secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and cytolytic activity. While inflammatory T cells are effective in eliminating virus, sterile immunity is not achieved; viral protein and/or RNA persist within astrocytes and oligodendroglia resulting in chronic expression of chemokine genes leading to chronic neuroinflammation and demyelination. Histological features associated with viral persistence include the development of an immune-mediated demyelinating disease similar to the human demyelinating disease MS in that both T cells and macrophages are critical mediators of disease severity and contribute to myelin damage [5, 32] .\n\nThrough the course of both acute and chronic JHMV-induced neurologic infection, there is a coordinated expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors that regulate inflammation contributing to both host defense and disease exacerbation. Among the chemokines expressed during infection are members of the ELR(+) chemokine family CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5. CXCL1 and CXCL2 are potent chemoattractants for neutrophils via binding and signaling through the receptor CXCR2 [28, 39, 48] . Moreover, PMNs have been shown to enhance CNS inflammation by disrupting blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity in various animal models of chronic neuroinflammation including spinal cord injury (SCI) [9, 44] and autoimmune demyelination [4] while blocking or silencing of CXCR2 signaling mutes inflammation and tissue damage in mouse models in which PMN infiltration is critical to disease initiation [2, 4, 9, 18, 24, 25, 43, 47] .\n\nNeutrophils represent a component of the innate immune response and provide an essential role in killing invading pathogens through an arsenal of defense mechanisms including release of microbicidal granules and release of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species [3, 30] . While a clear role for neutrophils in combating bacterial pathogens is documented [3, 30] , how these cells contribute to host defense and disease in response to CNS viral infection is less well characterized. McGavern et al. [19] employed two-photon microscopy to elegantly demonstrate that neutrophils, along with monocytes, were responsible for vascular leakage and acute lethality following lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection of the CNS. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection of monocyte-derived macrophages increases expression of CXCL5 that serves to attract neutrophils that may augment neuropathology by contributing to neuron death [10] . Experimental \n\nClinical Immunology j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / y c l i m infection of mice with West Nile virus (WNV) in which neutrophil trafficking to the CNS is impaired results in increased protection from WNV encephalitis by limiting immune cell access to the CNS thus diminishing neuropathology [46] . With regards to JHMV-induced encephalomyelitis, early work by Stohlman et al. [50] highlighted a previously unrecognized role for neutrophils in effectively controlling viral replication within the CNS. The underlying mechanisms by which neutrophils contribute to an effective host defense are related to neutrophil-mediated permeabilization of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) through release of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) [50] although other factors independent of MMP-9 may also be involved [37] . In addition, monocytes can also enhance T cell accumulation within the CNS of JHMV-infected mice through the glia limitans [37] . Neutrophils are rapidly mobilized from the bone-marrow and into the blood in response to CNS infection by JHMV and this most likely reflects the precipitous increase in expression of the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 that all bind to their cognate receptor CXCR2 with high binding [12] . Indeed, treatment of JHMV-infected mice with a blocking antibody specific for CXCR2 resulted impaired migration of CXCR2-bearing neutrophils to the CNS and this resulted in increased mortality that was associated with impaired ability to control viral replication within the CNS [12] . Blocking neutrophil accumulation within the CNS resulted in reduced expression of MMP-9, limited permeabilization of the BBB, and diminished infiltration of virus-specific T cells [12] . Collectively, these findings illustrate that neutrophils are an important component of an effective host defense following CNS infection with a neurotropic virus.\n\nNeutrophil infiltration into the CNS has been associated with neurologic disease in pre-clinical animal models [6, 14, 34, 38, 40] . Herz et al. [11] have recently demonstrated that CXCR2 antagonization reduced neurological deficits and infarct volumes following middle cerebral artery occlusion and this was associated with reduced neutrophil infiltration into the CNS. Similarly, depletion of neutrophils following subarachnoid hemorrhage was found to improve memory in a model of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) [33] . Additionally, Zenaro et al. [49] have demonstrated a role for the adhesion molecule lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) in promoting neutrophil accumulation within the CNS and amplifying AD-like pathology in transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Depletion of neutrophils and/or a deficiency in LFA-1 resulted in protection from cognitive decline and reduced gliosis arguing that blocking neutrophil trafficking may be beneficial in AD [49] . Within models of spinal cord injury/ trauma, neutrophils are among the first cells to accumulate within the site of injury and a number of studies argue for a pathogenic role for these cells through limiting tissue sparing and motor recovery while increasing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [1, 36] . Collectively, these studies demonstrate that in animal models of chronic neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration neutrophils can amplify the severity histologic disease and argue that blocking entry into the CNS may limit the severity of neurologic disease.\n\nA role for neutrophils in immune-mediated demyelination remains to be well characterized. Ransohoff et al. [22] , have shown that CXCR2-positive neutrophils are essential for cuprizone-induced demyelination and potentially contribute to oligodendrocyte cell loss. Questions remain regarding the importance of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of MS given the paucity of these cells in active lesions; however, elevated neutrophil numbers within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients have been correlated with clinical relapse [20] . Administration of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a neutrophil activating molecule, to MS and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients resulted in disease exacerbation arguing for a role for these cells in amplifying disease severity [16, 31] . Additionally, neutrophils have been reported to be more numerous and exhibit a more primed state in MS patients [29] . Recent studies [15, 35] highlight the importance of CXCL1 as well as other myeloid-chemoattractant molecules as having a possible role in potentiating disease in patients with either relapsing-remitting or progressive forms of MS, suggesting that soluble factors that attract neutrophils and/or neutrophil-related molecules may be important therapeutic targets for MS patients. Support for this notion is derived from studies employing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as a model for MS in which disease onset is mute when neutrophil trafficking to the CNS is disrupted [4, 27] . More recently, Stoolman et al. [42] have expanded on these findings to show that enriched expression of CXCL2 within the brainstem attracts neutrophils that substantially contribute to atypical EAE. Similarly, mice in which neutrophils lack suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) exhibit an increase in susceptibility to the atypical EAE and this correlates with preferential recruitment of neutrophils into the cerebellum and brainstem [23] . The site of neutrophil recruitment may be critical in terms of amplifying histopathology as neutrophil accumulation within the brain, but to a limited extent in the spinal cord, contribute to tissue injury [41] . Collectively, these findings indicate that neutrophils can affect the severity of clinical disease and neuroinflammation in EAE.\n\nIn attempt to better understand how neutrophils influence both host defense and disease following CNS viral infection, we have recently engineered transgenic mice to utilize the tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation system in which the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (hGFAP) promoter drives expression of a modified version of the reverse tetracycline transactivator protein (rtTA*M2) [26] (Fig. 1A) . Astrocytes were chosen for targeted expression of CXCL1 as previous studies [7, 8, 17] have shown that JHMV-infected astrocytes express CXCL1 [13, 21] . In the presence of doxycycline (Dox), transcription initiates at a tet-operon and leads to production of recombinant CXCL1 mRNA transcripts. Double transgenic (tg) mice (pBI-CXCL1-rtTA) and single tg mice (pBI-CXCL1) were generated; characterization of double tg mice revealed Dox-dependent expression of CXCL1 from cultured astrocytes as determined by ELISA (Fig. 1B) [26] . I.c. infection of Doxtreated double tg mice with JHMV resulted in a selective increased expression of CXCL1 mRNA transcripts and protein within the brain and spinal cords when compared to Dox-treated single tg mice infected with JHMV (Fig. 1C) [26] . Dox-induced overexpression of CXCL1 did not enhance control of viral replication within the CNS as both infected double and single tg mice exhibited similar viral titers at defined times post-infection (p.i.) nor were there differences in either frequency or numbers of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells within the CNS of double tg mice compared to single tg mice [26] . However, Doxtreatment of JHMV-infected double tg mice resulted in increased clinical disease and mortality when compared to infected single tg mice [26] .\n\nIn conjunction with increased expression of CXCL1 initiated within the CNS of Dox-treated double tg mice infected with JHMV, there was a rapid increase in CXCL1 protein levels in serum [26] . Correspondingly, there is a rapid increase in neutrophils within the blood at days 4 (p b 0.05) and 7 (p b 0.001) in double tg mice compared to infected single tg controls [26] . Dox-induced CXCL1 production in JHMV-infected double tg mice also resulted in an increase in neutrophil frequency within the brain at days 4 and 7 p.i. [26] . Similarly, there was an increase in neutrophil frequency within spinal cords of double tg mice at days 4 (p b 0.01) and 7 (p b 0.05) p.i. compared to single tg mice [26] . Immunofluorescence staining for neutrophils (Ly-6B.2) supported the flow cytometric data and revealed increased numbers of neutrophils accumulating within the meninges of double tg mice at day 7 p.i. [26] . The increased presence of neutrophils within the CNS of double tg mice suggested that there would also be a corresponding increase in blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability. Surprisingly, no differences were observed in BBB permeability within the brain or spinal cord at day 4 p.i. as measured by sodium fluorescein (NaF) uptake [26] . Examination of spinal cords from JHMV-infected Dox-treated double tg mice revealed an overall increase (p b 0.05) in the severity of demyelination when compared to infected single tg animals ( Fig. 2A ) [26] . The increase in demyelination in double tg mice was associated with a significant (p b 0.05) loss of mature oligodendrocytes (as determined by expression of GST-\u03c0) within the spinal cords and increased numbers of microglia in Dox-treated JHMV-infected double tg mice compared to infected single tg mice [26] . Flow cytometric data indicated that neutrophil frequencies within the spinal cords of infected double tg were significantly increased (p b 0.01) as well as their total numbers (p b 0.001) at day 12 p.i. compared to single tg mice (Fig. 2B) [26] . Additionally, neutrophils were detected within the spinal cord parenchyma of double tg mice compared to single tg mice (Fig. 2B) [26] . Elimination of neutrophils via administration of anti-Ly6g monoclonal antibody injection into JHMV-infected double tg mice treated with Dox resulted in a reduction in the severity of demyelination when compared to mice treated with isotype control antibody (Fig. 2C ) thus demonstrating that neutrophils are capable of augmenting the severity of white matter damage [26] .\n\nAlthough a role for neutrophils in host defense following infection with bacterial pathogens has been appreciated for a number of years, how neutrophils affect host defense in response to viral infection of the CNS has not been as well studied. However, it is now clear that neutrophils are capable of enhancing control of viral replication within the CNS through increasing the permeabilization of the BBB thereby allowing antigen-specific lymphocytes access to sites of infection. Equally interesting is how neutrophil infiltration into the CNS contributes to neuropathology e.g. demyelination. Compelling new information derived from clinical studies from MS patients as well as preclinical animal models of MS have emphasized a potential role for these cells in amplifying white matter damage opening the possibility of targeting neutrophil migration into the CNS as a therapeutic strategy to limit CNS damage."}
