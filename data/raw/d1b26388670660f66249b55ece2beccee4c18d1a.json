A cleanup after library synthesis was performed using a 1.8 ratio of Agencourt Raw Illumina reads were trimmed for quality and adapters using Trimmomatic (23), and were 1 5 2 1 9 4 assigned genotypes G30 (BatLi09, BatLi10 and BatLy17) and G31 (BatLi08) by the RCWG.\n\nFor VP4, VP1 and VP3, all five Cameroonian bat RVAs strains were distantly related to other 1 9 6\n\nknown RVA strains, including the Kenyan and Chinese RVA strains and were therefore 1 9 7 assigned to novel genotypes according to the RCWG classification criteria (Fig. 3) Additionally, to determine if any of these bat RVAs could cross species and infect humans, genotype constellations, as has been previously described for humans, and cats/dogs (10, 39).\n\nHowever, this needs to be further confirmed by identification of a larger number of RVAs 3 4 8 from bats from different age groups and different geographical locations.\n\n.
