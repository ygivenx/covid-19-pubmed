{"title": "Development and evaluation of a four-tube real time multiplex PCR assay covering fourteen respiratory viruses, and comparison to its corresponding single target counterparts", "body": "Demonstrating the presence of a viral pathogen in patients with respiratory symptoms has long been challenging. Traditional methods like viral culture and antigen detection have moderate sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the relative long turnaround time for some of these techniques makes them less useful for diagnosis of acute clinical problems. With the development of real time (RT) reverse transcriptase (rt) PCR, direct detection of amplified nucleic acids became possible, minimizing cross-contamination and reducing hands on time. In addition, RT rtPCR provides the possibility of easy quantitation of the amplified target. This progress has led to the development of a large number of rtPCR assays for the detection of individual viral pathogens. The introduction of multiplex RT rtPCR assay has increased the efficiency of routine molecular diagnostics of respiratory viruses and has been shown to be cost effective. [1] [2] [3] Past studies have extensively proven superior sensitivity of (real time) multiplex PCR over traditional methods. [4] [5] [6] However comprehensive analysis of analytical sensitivity and specificity of a multiplex PCR as compared to single-target assays has not been described for respiratory viruses. Puppe et al. 7 compared a multiplex assay with corresponding single-target PCR assays and showed a mean loss of 1.3 log for the multiplex assay. However their PCR was qualitative and did not use a real time format. Gunson et al. 8 reported similar median crossing-point (Cp) values when comparing duplex versus triplex real time assays.\n\nIn the study described here, a systematic analysis of multiplex RT rtPCR was performed. Sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex assay were compared to its single-target counterparts. This was done in serial dilutions of plasmids, samples with mixed plasmid input and in prospectively gathered nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). \n\nDNA targets controls were constructed by elongation of oligonucleotide linkers followed by amplification with specific primers, as described before. 9 The PCR products were ligated into PCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The sequences of all plasmids obtained were confirmed by sequencing using the BigDye sequencing kit (ABI, Nieuwerkerk a/d lJssel, The Netherlands).\n\nEquine arteritis virus (EAV) was used as internal control (IC) 10 and was measured during multiplex PCR in respiratory viral package (RVP) number one.\n\nSpecific primers and probes for all targets (Table 1) were designed using published sequences from Gene Bank. Primers and 6FAM and HEX labeled probes were obtained from Biolegio (Nijmegen, the Netherlands), CYAN500, LCRED610, and LCRED670 labeled probes from TIB Molbiol (Berlin, Germany) and MGB probes from ABI (6FAM or VIC labeled).\n\nExtraction of nucleic acids (NA) from 200 l of NPA was performed by MagNA Pure LC extraction using the total nucleic acid extraction kit (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). cDNA synthesis was performed as described earlier. 11 All PCR (multiplex and single-target) reactions were performed on a Roche LC480 (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) using exactly the same conditions. Reactions contained 10 l of 2\u00d7 Probes Master (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany), 900 nM of primer (each) 200 nM of probe (each), and 5 l of a cDNA in a total volume of 20 l. Cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50 \u2022 C and 10 min at 95 \u2022 C, followed by 45 cycles each consisting of 15 s at 95 \u2022 C and 1 min at 60 \u2022 C.\n\nData were analyzed using the LC480 software. Color compensation and calculation of Cp-values was done using LC480 software. The crossing point (Cp) value, which is comparable to a cycle threshold (CT) value, was used as an approximation of the amount of virus present. The Cp-value reflects the cycle at which a positive PCR signal is detected (the lower the Cp-value the more target DNA or RNA is present in the sample). The LC480 software obtains a Cp-value using the second derivative maximum of the amplification curve, which is more precise than cycle tresholds or crossing point algorithms with normalized, proportional, arithmetic or no background adjustment. 12 However small differences between Cp value of mono and multiplex pcr seem inevitable, since PCR reaction mixture between single and multiplex intrinsically different and to some degree will influence outline of amplification curves used to determine Cp value.\n\nA sample was considered positive if the results showed Cpvalues \u2264 40. Samples were considered negative if Cp-values were above 40 and the Cp-value for the corresponding IC was \u226432.8 (i.e. two times the standard deviation) above the mean IC for the negative samples).\n\nWe have recently described an internally controlled multiplex RT rtPCR for the detection of influenzavirus A (InfA) and B (InfB), enterovirus (EV), and adenovirus (AdV) which will be referred to as respiratory virus package 1 (RVP1). 7 In the current study we have broadened our diagnostic repertoire by designing three additional RVP's: RVP2 for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV) and human-metapneumovirus (hMPV); RVP3 for the detection of parainfluenzavirus 1-4 (PIV1-4) and human-parechovirus (hPeV); RVP4 for the detection of human-coronavirus (hCoV: HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43), and human-bocavirus (hBoV).\n\nSensitivity and specificity of the multiplex assay was analyzed using the single target PCR's as the gold standard.\n\nThis was done in four ways. One; dynamic ranges of the multiplex and single-target PCR's were assessed by testing serial dilutions of plasmids. Two; testing of mixed plasmid solutions containing different viral DNA targets. Each target was tested by spiking one target in an end dilution of 10 5 copies/reaction (i.e. 10 7 copies/ml) in a background of 10 3 copies/reaction (i.e. 10 5 copies/ml) of all other targets for respectively RVP1, RVP2, RVP3 and RVP4. Samples were analyzed by multiplex PCR and singletarget PCR and Cp-values were determined and compared. Three; testing of prospectively gathered clinical samples. A panel of 133 NPA's was taken from cohort of children who were admitted for a suspected respiratory tract infection to the Academical Medical Centre of Amsterdam, during the winter season of 2007-08. The study was approved by the local ethical committee and participants were included after written informed consent by one of the parents. A basic population description is presented in Table 2 . Four; for viruses species that were detected in less than 4 NPA samples, QCMD (Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics, Glasgow Scotland) control panels were run (Table 3 ). These samples consisted of cultured virus in various concentrations.\n\nAssessment of specificity was done by analyzing potential \"crosstalk\" (i.e. the fluorescence of a single target influencing detection of one of the others targets, generating a false positive signal) and potential false positivity due to unspecific primer-primer combinations (some multiplex packages contained up to 10 primers) in prospectively gathered NPA. \n\nDynamic ranges were determined to be linear between 500 and 10 8 copies/PCR of target plasmid for both multiplex and single target assay's. The lower limit of detection for the multiplex assay was between 40 and 50 copies/reaction for every target, which was similar to the individual single-target PCR's (data not shown).\n\nWhen analyzing mixed plasmid input, median Cp-values in the multiplex PCR were never higher than the single-target assay's, and in most cases the median Cp-value of multiplex analyses was even statistically lower than its single-target counterpart (Fig. 1) . Variation was slightly higher for the multiplex analysis, with a coefficient of variation (CV) range for the multiplex assay between 0.4% (hCoV) and 3.3% (PIV3), compared to the CV range for single-target assay's between 0.3% (hPeV) and 1.0% (hBoV).\n\nOverall, good concordance was observed between the multiplex PCR in comparison with the single-target PCR assays for clinical samples (Table 3 and Fig. 2 Table 4 . Opposed to plasmid analysis, the multiplex assay failed to detect EV in clinical samples with low EV loads, since Cp-values \u2265 33 in the single-target PCR were not 3) which did not differ statistically from the median Cp-value of the multiplex assay 28.8 (IQR 26.9-32.0) (p = 0.2). Species specific analyses did also not show statistical differences for median Cp-values. However, somewhat lower Cp-values for the multiplex assay were observed for InfB, RSV and RV in samples with high Cp-values (Fig. 2) .\n\nAnalyses of quality controls was performed to test viral targets that were less prevalent (i.e. PIV 1, 2, 3, 4, InfB and hCoV) in the clinical samples. Results are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 2 . Complete concordance was observed between the multiplex assay and the individual single-target assays for quality controls.\n\nReal time multiplex PCR is a technique that has been shown to be fast and cost effective for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections. Most papers on respiratory multiplex PCR's use traditional methods like virus culture, antigen tests or direct immune fluoresce as comparison, 8 hence questions can be raised about their diagnostic accuracy compared to sensitive single-target assays. We report the development and the extensive validation of an internally controlled four-tube RT rtPCR for the detection of 14 different viruses associated with respiratory infections.\n\nCombining primers and probes in a single reaction can influence the sensitivity of the assay as primer-primer interactions may lead to a lower availability of specific primers. In addition, the presence of multiple targets in one reaction may result in competition for enzymes and nucleotides. Analysis of dynamic ranges and mixed input of plasmids, revealed no loss of sensitivity. In fact, for most viruses Cp-values were slightly, but significantly, lower in the multiplex analyses. Most likely, this difference is due to the algorithm used by the LC480 software to calculate crossing point. The LC480 software calculates the second derivatives of the entire amplification curve and determines where this value is at its maximum. This value is the Cp-value and represents the cycle at which the increase of fluorescence is highest (i.e. the start logarithmic phase of the PCR). Using Cp values by the second derivative maximum of the amplification curve is known to be more precise than cycle thresholds values or other crossing point algorithms. 12 We have observed that in our multiplex reactions the total fluorescence is slightly lower and the slope of the amplification curve is less steep as compared to the corresponding single-target PCR's (which is most likely due to inevitable minute differences in PCR reaction mixtures of singleplex versus multiplex pcr's). This difference could lead to slightly lower Cp-values for the multiplex reactions, but does not represent a difference in absolute sensitivity.\n\nIn prospectively collected clinical samples the multiplex PCR showed concordant results to the single-target PCR's. For InfA, hCoV, PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, PIV 4, hMPV, AdV and hPeV Cp-values were nearly identical for multiplex and single-target assays. However for certain viruses (InfB, PIV 1, 2, 3 & 4, hPeV, and hCoV) the number of clinical samples was relatively small and extensive comparisons could be merely performed in the mixed input of plasmids analysis, but not by clinical samples. For RSV, RV and InfB multiplex showed slightly lower Cp-values than the single target PCR, particularly when single-target Cp-values were \u226530. This is probably due to a comparable phenomenon as described for slightly lower multiplex Cp-values in the plasmid evaluation. Discrepancies in clinical samples were mostly seen for hBoV and EV. Samples with a very low hBoV load (Cp-value > 36) were variable positive in either multiplex or single-target assay. This seems to represent a stochastic process around the detection limit for both multiplex and singletarget assays. Most of the EV positive respiratory samples, with Cp-values higher than 33 in single-target assays were negative in the multiplex assay, suggesting reduced sensitivity of EV detection of our multiplex assay. Additional analysis of dilution series of 4 different EV subtypes (representing group A, B, C and D EV's) showed concordant results for EV Cp-values in the multiplex and the singleplex assay (data not shown). However the fluorescence plateau's of the EV multiplex assay was notably lower compared to its singleplex equivalent. It might be possible that in samples with low abundance of multiple viral targets this lower fluorescence could lead to false-negativity. In this respect, it is noteworthy that all clinical EV samples that were \"missed\" by the multiplex PCR were samples positive two or three respiratory viruses (Table 4) .\n\nAnother explanation the missing EV in the multiplex PCR could be due to possible cross reactivity between EV PCR and RV. The EV primers and probes we used were previously developed in our department and described by Beld et al. 9 EV specificity was assessed in this publication and did not show any cross-reactivity with a panel of culture typed rhinoviruses. Since then, we have also tested the EV PCR against a panel of RV type C virus isolates (N = 9) which showed absent of cross reactivity against these viruses as well. Morever extensive in silico analysis (data not shown) did not show cross reactivity between our EV primers and RV sequences. However, as RV comprises over a hundred subtypes we cannot completely rule out cross reactivity with less common HRV strains. In literature cross-reactivity of molecular test between rhinovirus and enterovirus is not uncommon 13 and some authors even suggest that complete specificity for Rhinovirus and Enterovirus in impossible. 14 Yet the ongoing discovery of new respiratory EV's implies that separate analyses of EV in respiratory samples is of clinical importance 15 and optimization RV and EV pcr specificity is an important topic for future study.\n\nIn addition when addressing specificity issues in multiplex PCR: false positive results due to fluorescence cross-talk from one detection channel into other detection channels one was not seen in analysis with mixed plasmid input. Furthermore false positivity in the multiplex by other causes, like non-specific primer-target interactions, was studied by analyzing prospective clinical samples (including viral negative samples) of which the results were not known before testing. Some discrepancies were seen in which positive multiplex results were not confirmed by single-target testing. Most of these samples were hBoV positive samples with Cp-values > 36 and are probably due to a stochastic process at the detection limit, as mentioned earlier.\n\nIn summary, we present here an extensively evaluated multiplex PCR assay for the detection of 14 major causative agents of respiratory tract disease. Good concordance was observed between multiplex and single target analysis, except for clinical samples with low level of enterovirus. The assay is internally controlled, does not need post-PCR manipulations and can be used in routine diagnostic laboratories, providing a fast and proper validated way for the detection of respiratory viruses.\n\nNone."}
