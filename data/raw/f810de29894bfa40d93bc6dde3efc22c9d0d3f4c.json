The bats were identified morphologically by field-trained experts during 114 sampling and confirmed by partial mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene sequencing [31] of 115 representative individuals in every colony (S1 Table) . The bats were insectivorous except for one 116 fruit bat species Rousettus leschenaultii in the family Pteropodidae, and were captured in diverse 117 habitats, including natural and artificial caves, orchards and human-made structures (S1 Table) . 118 Archived tissues from individual bats had previously been sampled for zoonotic virus 119 surveillance, including for group A rotaviruses (RVA) [32] and hantaviruses [33] . 120 As part of the regional viral surveillance of a bat-borne zoonosis program, the lungs and rectal 121 tissue of 208 bats of 9 bat species from colonies 1-4 (S1 Table) collected in Yunnan province 122 were pooled and subjected to viral metagenomic analysis, as previously described [34] .

Four clones derived from each amplicon were sequenced to detect 152 potential co-infection of multiple PyVs in each positive sample. As a result, 180 of 186 bats were 153 confirmed to harbor one PyV, while the remaining 6 had a co-infection with two distinct PyVs 154 (detailed in S1 Table) . A total of 192 non-redundant partial VP1 sequences were obtained and 155 phylogenetically compared with VP1 sequences of known PyVs. Results showed that the 192 156 VP1 sequences had extensive diversity and could be classified into 44 clusters within the Alpha- 157 and Betapolyomavirus genera (Fig 2 and S1 Fig), 198 Among the newly identified single-host PyVs (Fig 3) , 19 PyVs shared 68-83% nt sequence 199 identities with the closest-known species or with each other in the LTAg coding sequences, Table) . They could therefore be considered novel PyV species, a proposal 206 further reinforced by additional correlation provided by the genetic selection analysis described The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

A qPCR protocol designed to detect both the previously 263 described rat PyV and the P. pipistrellus PyV was employed to screen samples comprising spleen, 264 kidney, lung, liver, rectal and brain tissues in all P. pipistrellus bats (n=158) Correlation of genetic divergences between PyVs and bat hosts. 274 As shown in Fig 3 and (LC269980) also identified in Zambian bats (Alpha 6). These last two instances showed that 283 PyVs from Chinese and African horseshoe bats were remarkably similar despite the geographical 284 separation.\n\nTo investigate further the factors potentially influencing the divergence between PyVs with 286 high nt sequence identities, Mantel's correlation tests were performed to compare the divergence 287 among PyV genome sequences with those among cytb genes of their corresponding hosts and to 288 control the putative effects of the geographic location on the bat collection. As shown in Table 3 , 289 correlation analysis was performed using three groups of data: 1) a total of 42 PyVs with full 290 genomes from the present study; 2) a total of 48 PyVs including the 42 PyV genomes described The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Other host-switching events inferred earlier in the 356 divergence among PyVs were more difficult to corroborate with the available tMRCA data.\n\nDivergence in the genus Betapolyomavirus involved 6 co-speciations, 2 lineage duplications, 7 358 lineage losses and 7 host-switching events (Fig 6B) .

Previously, short-range intra-genus 393 host-switching events of PyVs were identified in African horseshoe bats, occurring between Rh. Another ICTV criterion is the allowable genetic distance of the LTAg coding sequence (\u2265 449 15%) to demarcate PyV species. This cut-off value is not strict, as exemplified by two PyVs 450 identified in two different species of squirrel monkeys which shared 89% sequence identity but .

Further qPCR assay also detected the virus in lung tissue of another 524 P. pipistrellus bat but not from any brown rat (n=51) collected in the same Xinjiang area. This 525 preliminary observation provides an impetus to investigate potential PyV host-switching between 526 mammal species beyond families.\n\nThe host-switching events identified in this study were strongly associated with the ecological 528 environment of the hosts, with host-switching only identified between different bat species in one 529 to two colonies. Our study suggests that PyVs can transmit between different mammalian hosts 530 between two different animal families by frequent contact of hosts within specific environments, 531 such as the densely packed bat populations that occur in large hibernacula in caves.

MHC class I acts as a 536 co-receptor and SV40 employs the ganglioside GM1 as receptor [61] . The finding that 537 gangliosides are also primary receptors for human PyVs via VP1 [62] suggests that this may be a 538 general property for primate PyVs although whether this is applicable to other mammalian PyVs, 539 including bats, is unknown.

In 583 addition, the PCR was expanded to screen genomic DNA extracts from rectal tissues of bats 584 collected from other Chinese provinces.\n\nGenomic DNA from each bat tissue sample was extracted manually using the TIANamp Table. 595 Oligonucleotide primers for inverse PCRs for amplification of the 5 kb PyV genomes were 596 design based on the partial VP1 sequences. Multiple pairs of hemi-nested degenerate primers 597 were subsequently designed for VP1 clusters which showed close phylogenetic relationships (see 598 S6 Table) .

The cytb and LTAg gene multiple sequence alignments were used to infer 627 the divergence times among hosts and PyVs, respectively. The general time-reversible 628 substitution model with gamma-distributed rate variation across sites and a proportion of 629 invariable sites (GTR+G+I) were assumed for both models. Other settings were: uncorrelated 630 lognormal relaxed molecular clocks for host and PyV models with a Bayesian skyline population 631 and exponential population models, respectively. These models chosen had the highest likelihood 632 when compared to other models with the PathSampler application in BEAST v2.4.6 package. The 633 host model was calibrated with divergence times between genera as inferred by Agnarsson [40] 634 and the PyV model was calibrated following Buck et al. [17, 76] . \n\nThe divergence correlation between the hosts and PyVs in the Alpha-and Betapolyomavirus 638 genera was assessed by applying Mantel's correlation tests to the pairwise evolutionary distance 639 matrices for hosts and viral samples in both genera with 10 4 repetitions. Additionally, the 640 matrices were also analysed against the geographical distance between sampling points, and 641 partial correlations between host and polyomavirus distance matrices were estimated controlling 642 for the correlation with the geographical distance. The correlation analysis was performed 643 considering three sets of data per genus: 1) considering only samples identified in China, 2) .
