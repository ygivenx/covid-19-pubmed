The use of antibiotics as a treatment for bacterial infections and as a prophylactic additive in feed has dramatically improved cattle production in the last century, however, the rise of antibioticresistant bacteria and pressure to reduce or eliminate use of antibiotics has collectively driven livestock industries to seek appropriate alternatives.\n\nHost Defense Peptides (HDPs; also known as antimicrobial peptides or innate defense regulators) are natural compounds present on skin and in secretions such as tears, saliva and milk in cattle and other animals. HDPs are naturally anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-parasitic, and they can also stimulate the immune system to combat infectious diseases [1] [2] [3] . Unlike antibiotics, HDPs are not disease-specific and can at once potentially protect against multiple bacterial, viral and parasitic challenges. In this report, we selected four HDPs (Indolicidin (Indol), Lactoferricin (LFn), Bovine Myeloid Antimicrobial Peptide-27 (BMAP-27), and Protegrin-1 (PG-1)) which have individually been shown to possess anti-microbial, antiinflammatory or immunomodulatory activities [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] . We evaluated their synergistic effects in induction of IL-8 expression, and indicator of innate immune activation, and their anti-microbial activity.\n\nSupplementation of HDPs such as Lactoferrin into diet has been shown to protect calves against bacterial diseases suggesting that HDPs may be an effective replacement for antibiotics in feed [8] . However, adding synthetic peptides directly to feed or water as a prophylactic treatment and/or to treat disease is cost-prohibitive. To circumvent these costs, we devised a novel HDP delivery system: We intend to manipulate the cow's mammary glands to secrete significant quantities of select HDPs into milk using adenovirus gene delivery system. Through consumption of HDP-enriched milk, the calf will be supplemented with HDPs, which can then act directly as antimicrobial agents as well as influence the calf gastrointestinal immune system to protect against Neonatal Diarrheal Disease.\n\nThe bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T cells) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-10274; Rockville, MD, USA) and cultured as indicated in [9] .\n\nThe following peptides were purchased from ChemPep (Wellington, Fl, USA): Indol (N-ILPWKWPWWPWRRG-C; GenBank: NM_174827), BMAP-27 (N-GRFKRFRKKFKKLFKKLSPVI-PLLHLG-C; GenBank: NM_174832), and PG-1(N-RGGRLCYCRRRFCVCVGR-C; GenBank: NM_001123149).\n\nLFn (N-IEGRFKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVRRAF-C; GenBank: AAQ98614.1) was synthesized in-house on a PIONEER\u2122 solid-phase peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Life Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA) using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxy carbonyl) chemistry. Peptide chains were synthesized from the carboxyl terminus to the amino terminus onto [5-(4-Fmoc-aminomethyl-3,5dimethyloxyphenoxy) valeric acid]-polyethylene glycol-polystyrene (PAL-PEG-PS) resin (OVA (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd, Oakville, ON, Canada). Fmoc-protecting groups at the amino terminus were deprotected with piperidine. The peptides were cleaved from the resin with concurrent deprotection of the side chain-protecting groups by treating the resin-bound peptide with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Sigma) (9.3 parts) in the presence of scavengers (anisole-ethyl-methyl sulfide-1,2-ethanedithiol [3:3:1]), for 4 h. The crude peptides were filtered from the resin, and the TFA was evaporated. Diethyl ether (Sigma) was added to the residues to precipitate the crude peptide. The peptides were isolated and purified by highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on VYDAC \u00ae protein C 4 \n\nEnterotoxigenic E. coli strain B44 (O9:K30;K99:H-) [10] was grown in minimal media (Vogel Bonner media; VB [11] ) or Brain-Heart Infusion (BHI; Fisher) as indicated at 37 o C in a shaking incubator until it reached log phase. A concentration of 10 5 cfu/ml was plated into a round-bottom, Nunc 96-well plate (Fisher Scientific) then incubated with the peptide cocktail (each peptide was included at 50 \u00b5g/ml, 12.5 \u00b5g/ml, 6.25 \u00b5g/ml, 1.5 \u00b5g/ml or 0 \u00b5g/ml (media alone)) for 18 hrs at 37 o C . The E. coli was then plated onto MacConkey agar plates (Fisher) the next day. Results were recorded as follows: (-) = no growth, (+) = low growth (very few colonies), (++) = medium growth, (+++) = heavy growth, (++++) = (very heavy growth).\n\nA Trypan blue exclusion assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of the peptides on MAC-T cells. Cells were cultured in the presence of the peptides for 24 h before incubation with 0.025 % Trypan Blue (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, CAN). The number of viable (clear) and dead (blue) cells were assessed by flow cytometry and presented in Table 1 as a percentage of viable (clear) cells in the presence of media or increasing concentration of HDPs.\n\nIL-8 expression was quantified using DuoSet\u00ae ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nUsing their proprietary OptimumGene TM technology, we purchased a gene designed to code for the active regions of Indol, Lactoferrin, BMAP-27, PG-1 and FLAG ( N-DYKDDDDK-C) from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ USA) ( Supplementary Fig 1) and the gene (5'Signal-Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1-FLAG 3') was cloned into a CpG-free vector (pCpGfree-mcs Invivogen, San Diego, CA, USA) using BglII and NcoI restriction endonuclease sites (New England Biolabs Ltd., Pickering, ON, Canada). The gene was designed such that it had minimal CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and was optimized for high expression in sheep (i.e. sheep were chosen as our animal model of choice instead of calves due to lower costs).\n\nE1-substituted Ad5 Adenovirus cloning was performed by O.D.260, Inc. as detailed in [12] . Recombinant adenovirus vectors were amplified in 293 cells (ATCC; CRL-1573). Cells were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Sigma), 4 mM glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies), and 4.5 mg glucose/L. CsCl-purified virus was dialyzed against GTS buffer (2.5% glycerol, 25 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0; (Sigma)) and filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m Millex-GV membrane (Fisher Scientific, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Infectious virus titres were determined using TCID50 assay [13] .\n\nThe 293 cells were plated in 6 well Nunc plates (Nalgene) for 18 hr prior to transduction with 2 \u00b5l crude extract of Adenovirus coding for Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1-FLAG in 2 ml total volume. Seventytwo hours later, supernatants were collected and frozen at -80 o C. Supernatants were evaporated by Speed-Vac to approximately 200 \u00b5l volume and 10 % was added to methanol-treated, dried, PVDF membrane. Five \u00b5g of 293 cellular supernatants which had previously been transfected with bacterial plasmid expressing FLAG (a kind gift from McFie and Stone [14] ) was also blotted onto the membrane and was allowed to dry at room temperature. The blot was blocked with 1 % skim milk in 0.05 %Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBST). TBST buffer for 1 hour. Primary rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (1 \u00b5g/ml; Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was incubated with the blot at room temperature with gentle shaking for 2 hr. After washing 3 times with 5 ml of 1% skim milk/TBST, the secondary Alkaline-phosphataseconjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature gentle shaking. Blots were washed 3 times with 1% skim milk in TBST for 5 minutes each followed by three washes in TBST. Blots were washed 4 times with ddH 2 O then 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT/BCIP) (Sigma) insoluble alkaline substrate solution was added as per manufacturer's instruction.\n\nBecause our ultimate goal is adenovirus-mediated HDP expression into cow milk for consumption by the calf, we anticipate that there will be a significant dilution effect in the milk and the large surface area of the gut. Therefore, we sought to identify a cocktail of HDPs which are effective at low concentrations. We evaluated the microbicidal activity of Indol, LFn, BMAP-27, and PG-1 alone and in combination against an E. coli K99 bovine field isolate known to cause Neonatal Diarrheal Disease in cattle [10] . Individually and in the majority of combinations, Indol, LFn, BMAP-27, and PG-1 were poorly microbicidal at 1.5 \u00b5g/ml (Table 1) . However, when Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1-FLAG were introduced to the bacteria at 1.5 \u00b5g/ml each, the cocktail proved to be strongly anti-microbial. A trypan blue exclusion assay determined that even when Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 were at 12. 5 \u00b5g/ml, they were not cytotoxic to MAC-T cells (Table 2 ). Next, we evaluated the effect that Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 had on IL-8 protein expression, a chemokine known to induce both chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils [15, 16] and an indicator or innate immune activation. Although this experiment needs to be repeated to establish whether these results are statistically significant, Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 (1.5 \u00b5g/ml) prompted a moderate induction of IL-8 expression in MAC-T cells. In the presence of LPS, Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 showed a strongly synergistic effect with production of > 3,000 pg/ml IL-8 after 48 hours. Thus, we have chosen to clone Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 into adenovirus for further analysis.\n\nTo circumvent the costs associated with HDP production, we devised a procedure where-in the mammary glands of the cow will act to produce the HDPs which will be supplied to the suckling calf through the milk. We designed a gene such that Indol's natural signal peptide sequence was in-frame to the active region of Indol which was also in-frame with the active sequences for LFn, BMAP-27, PG-1 and FLAG. Because there are no commercially available antibodies against Indol, LFn, BMAP-27 or PG-1, we included the FLAG epitope as part of the gene product. Detection of FLAG using anti-FLAG antibodies could be used to infer expression of Indol, LFn, BMAP-27 and PG-1. The gene was designed so that each HDP were separated from each other by four codons coding for Arginine. When translated into a protein, the HDPs will be freed from each other through trypsin digestion. This gene was synthesized as indicated in Materials and Methods and cloned into a CpG-free expression plasmid. In turn, the gene was sub-cloned into a replication defective adenovirus. When 293 cells were transduced with the modified adenovirus, we detected FLAG expression through dot-blot analysis suggesting that the peptides were also being expressed.\n\nIn future experiments, we intend to evaluate whether adenovirus-derived HDPs, like their synthetic counterparts, are strongly anti-microbial and promote IL-8 expression from MAC-T cells when costimulated with LPS. Once satisfied that the adenovirus-derived peptides are functional, we will transduce udders directly through the teat canal and then monitor the milk for the HDP/FLAG protein using antibodies against FLAG. Once consumed by the calf, the HDP/FLAG protein will travel to the trypsinrich gut and, through enzymatic digestion, Indol, LFn, BMAP-27 and PG-1:FLAG will be released. Calf's will be infected with E. coli K99 to establish whether continuous exposure to adenovirus-derived HDPs protects them against Neonatal Diarrheal Disease.\n\nIn this study, Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 were shown to be strongly antimicrobial against E. coli K99 but not cytotoxic to bovine mammary epithelial cells. The peptide cocktail synergized with LPS to promote robust quantities of IL-8 protein from MAC-T cells. Together, these results suggest that Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 are strongly immunomodulatory and anti-microbial. Our next steps will be to establish adenovirus-mediated expression of Indol/LFn/BMAP-27/PG-1 in cow milk, and to determine whether it protect calves against Neonatal Diarrheal Disease. Supernatants were blotted onto PVDF membrane and hybridized with anti-FLAG antibody. Adenovirus transduced 293 cells expressed FLAG and therefore must also produce the HDP active regions. The active portion of Indol/LFn/BMAP-27 and PG-1 were cloned in-frame to an bacteriallike plasmid which was in turn be introduced to an adenovirus vector. The gene includes a sequence corresponding to the Sequence Recognition Particle (Signal) to ensure secretion of the protein outside of the cell and a FLAG tag for detection and quantification purposes. The adenovirus will be injected into the mammary tissue through the teat canal with the intent that it will transduce the mammary epithelial cells which will, in turn, generate the HDP protein into the milk. Upon consumption by the calf, the HDP protein will travel to the gut where trypsin will cleave the HDP protein to release the active peptides.
