{"title": "A rare cause of acute flaccid paralysis: Human coronaviruses", "body": "Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) is a clinical entity characterized by areflexia and/or hyporeflexia and weakness which reaches a maximum within days or weeks.[1] Polioviruses, enterovirus 71, flavivirus, herpes virus, and rabies virus are well-known as viral etiologic agents.[2] In this article, who presented with lower respiratory tract infection and AFP, and was detected to have co-infection of human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E and OC43 is reported. AFP associated with HCoV infections has not been reported previously in the literature, and has been reported for the first time in this article.\n\nA 3-year-old girl hospitalized due to the development of shortness of breath and inability to walk 1-day after the beginning of fever, rhinorrhea, cough, and weakness. On the same day, respiratory distress increased, she was intubated, and mechanical ventilation started. On physical examination, she was conscious but swallowing, chewing and speech functions damaged, muscle strength was 0/5 and deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) were absent, the plantar response was flexor. Physical examination of other systems was normal. Complete blood count, electrolytes and blood biochemistry and urinalysis were normal, C-reactive protein was negative and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 20 mm/h. Chest radiography was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, glucose, and protein were normal. Blood, urine, and CSF cultures were negative. Stool and nasal swab cultures were taken. Electroneuromyography (ENMG) revealed no pathological findings. No abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging were detected - so intracranial and spinal pathologies were excluded.\n\nIntravenous antibiotherapy was given for 10 days. After 48 h of hospitalization, a total of 2 g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in 3 days was given. Mechanical ventilation lasted 7 days. At the end of this period, muscle strength improved to 2\u20133/5, DTR became norm active, bulbar paralysis and respiratory distress had regressed. At the end of the 2nd week, she could mobilize and walk with a guide. Lumbar puncture and ENMG repeated in the 3rd week did not reveal any pathological findings and Gullian\u2013Barre syndrome (GBS) was completely excluded. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of nasal swab samples was reported to be positive for HCoV 229E and OC43 and HCoV co-infection was diagnosed.\n\nNil.\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest."}
