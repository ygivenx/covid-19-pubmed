{"title": "Novel halogenated 3-deazapurine, 7-deazapurine and alkylated 9- deazapurine derivatives of L-ascorbic or imino-L-ascorbic acid: Synthesis, antitumour and antiviral activity evaluations", "body": "Numerous nucleoside derivatives are being used in treatment of viral, tumoural, bacterial as well as other diseases. Purine nucleoside antiviral drugs carbovir, didanosine and its prodrug 2 0 ,3 0dideoxyadenosine are currently used in treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) caused disease (AIDS), while acyclovir, ganciclovir [1] , penciclovir [2] and (S)-9-(2, 3-dihydroxypropyl) adenine ((S)-DHPA) [3] are used as nucleoside antiherpetic drugs. Moreover, 6-mercaptopurine and thioguanine have been used as antitumoural drugs, azathioprine as an immunosuppressive drug used in organ transplant recipients and cladiribine in treatment of systemic mastocytosis [1] .\n\nWith the aim to synthesize better and selective substances, modifications in the sugar moiety or its analogue replacement and alterations in nucleoside bases were investigated synthetically and biologically. Thus, 3-deazaadenosine, a potent inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and an attractive target for the design of antiviral drugs, has shown significant activity against HSV-1, HIV and oncogenic DNA viruses [4] . 3-Deazaadenine derivatives of cyclopentyl adenine drugs aristeromycin and neoplanocin A retained their strong activity against HSV-1, vaccinia virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV) with lower cytotoxicity [5e8]. Also, 3-deazaguanosine has shown a wide spectrum of activity against DNA and RNA viruses as well as antitumoural activity [1] . C-2 and C-3 halogenated 3-deazapurine derivatives showed anti-HBV activity, a broad spectrum of antitumour properties [9] and strong ability of subtracting Mycobacterium tuberculosis adenosine kinase [4] . C-7 fluorinated and C-2 0 methylated derivatives of the naturally isolated antibiotic tubercidin (7-deazaadenosine) have shown strong inhibition of NS5B, a nonstructural hepatitis C protein, while C-7 halogenated also exhibited substantial activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [10e12] . Acyclic derivatives of sangivamycin (7-deazapurine broad spectrum antibiotic) showed the same antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HCMV as the reference drug ganciclovir, without cytotoxic effects. In addition, compound BMK-Y101 and its prodrug are preclinical candidates for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [12] . Furthermore, C-2 fluorinated, C-7 alkylated and 2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxy derivatives of 9-deazaadenosine have shown a broad spectrum of antitumoural activities with lower cytotoxicity in relation to 9deazaadenosine [13, 14] .\n\nOur research group has synthesized numerous nucleoside derivatives of L-ascorbic acid which have demonstrated a broad spectrum of antiproliferative activity, as well anti-HCMV, anti-VZV and anti-CMV activity at micromolar concentrations [15e19]. Alterations of the sugar moiety in natural or synthetic nucleosides with L-ascorbic acid succeeded from its antioxidant properties and antitumoural properties of its stearate and palmitate derivatives [20e23] . These findings prompt us to synthesize new types of variously halogenated 3-deazapurine, 7-deazapurine and alkylated 9-deazapurine derivatives of L-ascorbic or imino-L-ascorbic acid ( Fig. 1 ) with a primary aim to evaluate their antiviral potency and cytotoxic activity.\n\nThe 3-deazapurine derivatives of L-ascorbic acid (1e4) were prepared under modified Vorbr\u00fcggen reaction conditions (Scheme 1). The 3-deazapurine bases (3-DP) (A, B and C) were silylated with either 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and catalytic amount of ammonium-sulphate (2,6-difluoro-3-chloro-3deazapurine, B or 6-chloro-3-deazapurine, C) or bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (BSA) (3-bromo-3-deazapurine, A). Condensation reaction in situ of silylated 3-deazapurine bases (A, B and C) and 5,6-di-O-acetyl-2,3-di-O-benzyl-L-ascorbic acid (dAd-BAA, synthesized as previously described [15] ) with FriedeleCrafts catalyst, trimethylsilyltrifluoromethane sulphonate (TMSOTf) afforded the new 3-deazapurine derivatives of L-ascorbic acid (1e4, Scheme 1) containing ethylenic spacer between two moieties. 2,6-Difluoro-3-chloro-3-deazapurine base (B) was synthesized in six steps as previously described by Liu, M.-C. et al. [9] while 3-bromo-3-deazapurine base (A) was synthesized by cyclization reaction of 3,4-diamino-5-bromopyridine with diethoxymethyl acetate (DEMA). 3-Bromo-3-deazapurine derivative of L-AA (1) was isolated as N-9 regioisomer and as a mixture of Z and E isomers in the ratio 4:1, while reaction between 3-deazapurine base B and dAd-BAA resulted in two regioisomers, N-9 as a Z isomer (2) and N-7 as a mixture of Z and E isomers (3) in the ratio 3:1. 6-Chloro-3deazapurine derivative of L-AA (4) was isolated as N-7 regioisomer in equal Z and E isomer amounts. Ammonolysis of compounds 1, 2 and 4 in dioxane and methanol gave compounds 5e7, bearing a hydroxy group at the C-4 of now imino-L-ascorbic acid (imino-L-AA). Also, substitution of the fluorine atom with amino group at the C-6 position of the 3-deazapurine base occurred in the synthesis of 3-deazapurine derivative of imino-L-AA (7) . Compound 4 underwent debenzylation with boron-trichloride (1 M in dichloromethane) which yielded the compound 8, 3deazapurine derivative of L-AA with free hydroxy groups at the C-2 and C-3 positions of L-AA, as mixture of Z and E isomers in the ratio 10:1.\n\nThe 7-bromo-7-deazapurine derivative of L-AA (9) was prepared in a similar manner as compounds 2e4. Condensation reaction of 7-deazapurine base (7-DP) D and dAdBAA in Vorbr\u00fcggen reaction conditions gave N-1 regioisomer of compound 9 (Z:E \u00bc 3:1) (Scheme 2). 6-Chloro-7-iodo-7-deazapurine derivative of L-AA (10) was not isolated under Vorbr\u00fcggen conditions, but was successfully obtained via reaction under Mitsunobu reaction conditions. Reaction between 7-deazapurine base E and 6-hydroxy-2,3-di-Obenzyl-4,5-didehydro-L-ascorbic acid (HdBAA) with triphenylphosphine (PPh 3 ) and diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) afforded compound 10, 6-chloro-7-iodo-7-deazapurine substituted with 4,5-didehydro-5,6-dideoxy-L-ascorbic acid at N-9 position in the isomer ratio Z:E \u00bc 9:1 (Scheme 2). Ammonolysis of compounds 9 and 10 in similar procedures as for the synthesis of 3-deazapurine derivatives of imino-L-AA (5e7) gave 7-deazapurine derivatives of imino-L-AA 11 and 12, bearing the amino group at the C-4 chiral position of the lactame moiety (Scheme 2). As opposed to the structure of analogue derivatives of deazapurines and imino-L-AA described in this paper (5e7, 11 and 16e19) which contain ethyl spacer between deazapurine and lactame moieties, compound 12 contains ethylenic spacer between those two moieties with the double bond between C-5 and C-6 atoms. Structural difference of the products 11 and 12 may be explained by the mechanism from which these lactams arise. The mechanism of the formation of the lactams from L-ascorbic acid involves nucleophilic attack of the ammonia to the carbonyl group at C-1 of the lactone moiety with concomitant lactone ring opening and formation of the keto-enolic tautomers that subsequently close to form lactams [24] . Thus, our findings of the two structural different compounds 11 and 12 may be in accordance to that mechanism; the keto tautomer undergoes the nucleophilic attack of the amino group, followed by ring closure and formation of the lactame derivative 11, whereas the enolic tautomer undergoes the same nucleophilic attack followed by a consecutive shift of the double bond and formation of imino-L-AA derivative 12.\n\nThe 9-deazapurine derivatives of L-AA (13e15) were prepared under Mitsunobu reaction conditions, via similar synthetic method for obtaining 7-deazapurine derivative of L-AA (11) (Scheme 3). Reaction of 2,6-dimethoxy-9-deazapurine base (F) and HdBAA gave N-7 regioisomer 13 in equal isomer ratio (Z:E \u00bc 1:1), while reaction of 9-deazahypoxanthine base (G) and HdBAA yielded two condensated derivatives, 9-deazahypoxanthine monosubstituted with 4,5-didehydro-5,6-dideoxy-L-ascorbic acid at position N-1 (Z-14) and 9-deazahypoxanthine disubstituted with L-AA (15) at positions N-1 and N-7 (Z, Z 00 related to both double bonds in 15). Ammonolysis of compound 13 produced 2,6-dimethoxy-9deazapurine derivative of imino-L-AA (16) while ammonolysis of 14 gave the 9-deazahypoxanthine derivative of imino-L-AA (17) (Scheme 3). When subdued to ammonia, the disubstituted 9deazahypoxanthine derivative of L-AA (15) yielded two derivatives of 9-deazahypoxanthine and imino-L-AA (18 and 19) that presumably are in diasteroisomeric relation (Scheme 3).\n\nThe chemical identities of deazapurine derivatives of L-ascorbic acid (1e4, 8e10, 13e15) and imino-L-ascorbic acid (5e7, 11, 12, 16e19) were confirmed by 1 H, 13 C, 15 N, 19 F and 2D NMR measurements, as well as mass spectrometry spectra analysis (HPLC/MS/MS and MALDI-TOF/TOF). NMR chemical shifts are reported in Table 1 ( 1 H), Experimental section ( 1 H and 13 C) and Supplementary data 1 and 2 ( 19 F and 15 N). 1 H decoupled 13 C NMR spectra showed CeF coupling constants that enabled straightforward identification of fluorinated carbon atoms and their neighbours. Notably, C-4 0 and C-5 0 displayed different multiplicity pattern due to the long-range coupling constants with two fluorine atoms in 2 and 3; C-4 0 is coupled to both fluorine atoms over three bonds ( 3 J \u00bc 4e12 Hz), whereas C-5 0 showed coupling constants over two ( 2 J \u00bc 27e34 Hz) and four bonds ( 4 J \u00bc 3e4 Hz). Furthermore, 2D 19 Fe 13 C NMR spectra allowed unambiguous assignment of C-2 0 and C-6 0 in difluorinated deazapurines 2 and 3 (Fig. 2) . N-7 and N-9 regioisomers 2 and 3 were distinguished on the basis of heteronuclear 1 He 13 C and 1 He 15 N correlation signals in 2D HMBC spectra. H-6 methylene protons in 2 (d 5.39 ppm) showed correlation signal with C-4 0 (d 141.67 ppm), which suggested that benzyl-protected ascorbic acid is attached to N-9 position of deazapurine scaffold. 15 N chemical shifts of N-7 and N-9 in deazapurine 2 were observed at d 240 and 163 ppm, respectively. In contrast, perusal of 2D NMR spectra of 3 showed a correlation signal between H-6 methylene protons (d 5.25 ppm) and C-5 0 (d 116.37 ppm) indicating that the reaction proceeded at the N-7 position of the deazapurine moiety. 15 N chemical shifts in deazapurine 3 corroborated that ascorbic acid is attached at N-7 position. N-7 and N-9 were observed at d 158 and 243 ppm, respectively.\n\nDistinct shielding of C-4 0 and C-5 0 as well as N-7 and N-9 atoms in regioisomeric pair of 2/3 facilitated the assessment of structural features of the remaining regioisomers (Fig. 3) .\n\nVicinal coupling constant 3 J H5H6 \u00bc 14.3 Hz suggested an Econfiguration along C4]C5 double bond in compound 12. Some NMR spectra exhibited two sets of signals, which were attributed to Z-and E-isomers. The configurations along C4]C5 double bond in 1e4 and 13e15 were evaluated through long-range 3 J C13H11 coupling constants, which were determined by J-HMBC NMR experiments. Small values between 2 and 3 Hz are in agreement with Z-configuration along C4]C5 double bond, whereas 3 J C13H11 between 7 and 8 Hz correspond to E-isomers (Table 2 ). Conformational study of compounds 2 and 4 showed only trivial NOESY cross-peaks. Consequently, no particular conformational preferences could be established for these compounds.\n\nNewly synthesized 3-, 7-and 9-deazapurine derivatives of Lascorbic (1e4, 8e10 and 13e15) and imino-L-ascorbic acid (5e7, 12 and 16e19) have been evaluated in vitro for their cytostatic effects on malignant human tumour cell lines including cervical carcinoma (HeLa), colorectal adenocarcinoma (SW620), murine leukemia (L1210/0), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CEM/0), pancreatic carcinoma (MiaPaCa-2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as well as their cytotoxic effects on embryonal murine fibroblasts (3T3) ( Table 3 and Supplementary data 3). Compound 9 was tested on pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, CFPAC-1.\n\nAmong the tested compounds that exhibited the most prominent antitumour activities, only compounds 1 and 19 showed low cytotoxic effects on fibroblasts 3T3 (Table 3) . Several deazapurine derivatives of L-AA and imino-L-AA expressed antiproliferative activity against L1210/0 cell lines in the micromolar concentration range:\n\n(IC 50 \u00bc 6.8 \u00b1 0.1 mM), 2,6-dimethoxy-9-deazapurine derivative of L-AA (13) (IC 50 \u00bc 4.7 \u00b1 0.1 mM) and 9-deazahypoxanthine derivatives (15, 18, 19) (IC 50 \u00bc 4.5 \u00b1 0.5; 4.4 \u00b1 0.3 and 7.6 \u00b1 3.8 mM, respectively). Compounds 13, 15 and 18 were not cytotoxic for 3T3 cells. 3-Deazapurine derivative of L-AA (1), as well as 9-deazapurine derivatives of L-AA (13) and imino-L-AA (19) showed the most pronounced activity against CEM/0 cell lines (IC 50 \u00bc 5.7 \u00b1 1.4; 4.1 \u00b1 1.8 and 4.9 \u00b1 0.3 mM, respectively) while amongst them, only 2,6dimethoxy-9-deazapurine derivative of L-AA (13) did not exhibit cytotoxic effects on fibroblasts 3T3. N-1 regioisomers of 7-bromo-7-deazapurine derivative of L-AA (9) and 9-deazahypoxanthine derivative of L-AA (14) have shown moderate effects against L1210/0 (IC 50 \u00bc 15 \u00b1 0; 28 \u00b1 5 mM, respectively) and against the CEM/0 cell line (IC 50 \u00bc 12 \u00b1 0; 16 \u00b1 2 mM, respectively) without Scheme 2. Synthesis of novel halogenated 7-deazapurine derivatives of L-ascorbic (9, 10) or imino-L-ascorbic acid (11, 12) . The 9-deazapurine derivatives of L-AA (13) and the imino-L-AA derivatives (15 and 18) , which exhibited the most prominent antitumoural activities, will serve as model molecules for developing more selective and more active antitumoural substrates in this class of compounds.\n\nThe newly synthesized 3-, 7-and 9-deazapurine derivatives of Lascorbic (1e4, 8e10, 13e15) and of imino-L-ascorbic acid (5e7, 12, Table 4 ). The EC 50 's for compound 3 were in the same order as those found for the reference anti-HCMV drug ganciclovir and without cytotoxic effects on normal human embryonal lung (HEL) cells. The removal of benzyl protection groups of C-2 and C-3 hydroxyl groups of L-AA moiety in compound 8 resulted in the imino-L-AA analogue derivative 7, which lost anti-HCMV activity compared to the most active compound 3. The 2,6-dimethoxy-9deazapurine derivative of L-AA (13) exhibited lower EC 50 values against both HCMV strains (EC 50 \u00bc 4.99 mM for AD-169 strain and EC 50 \u00bc 1.99 for Davis strain) but also cytotoxic effects on HEL cells\n\nThe 9-deazahypoxanthine derivative substituted with two L-AA moieties (15) exerted very weak activity against both strains of VZV (TK \u00fe and TK \u00c0 ) (EC 50 \u00bc 13.8; 7.6 mM, respectively) with cytotoxic effect on HEL cells (CC 50 \u00bc 20.0 mM) ( Table 5 ).\n\nThe 2,6-difluoro-3-chloro-3-deazapurine derivatives of L-AA substituted at the N-9 position of the deazapurine moiety (2) and at the N-7 position (3) exhibited the same potency against Punta Toro virus (EC 50 \u00bc 12 mM), but had strong cytotoxic effects on Vero cells (2: MCC ! 20 mM; 3: MCC \u00bc 20 mM). Besides that, compound 2 showed moderate activity against Coxsackie B4 virus in Vero cells with an EC 50 value of 14.5 mM, while when tested on HeLa cells, it did not exhibit any activity against this virus (EC 50 > 100 mM) ( Table 5 ).\n\nThe 9-deazahypoxanthine derivative disubstituted with two L-AA moieties at the N-1 and N-7 positions (15) exhibited stronger activity against Punta Toro virus (EC 50 \u00bc 6.7 \u00b1 3.1 mM) compared to compounds 2 and 3. The effective concentration needed for reducing Punta Toro virus replication by 50% for compound 15 was 3-and 22-folds lower compared to, respectively, dexstran-sulphate (DS-10000) and ribavirin. However, compound 15 proved to be cytotoxic to Vero cells (MCC ! 20 mM) ( Table 5 ).\n\nAmongst the 3-deazapurine derivatives of L-AA (1e4, 8) and imino-L-AA (5e7), 2,6-difluoro-3-deazapurine derivative of Lascorbic acid (3) showed important activity against human cytomegalovirus (AD-169 and Davis cell strain), at inhibitory concentrations similar as those for the reference anti-HCMV drug ganciclovir. Also, compound 3 did not show any cytostatic effects on normal human embryonal lung (HEL) cells, embryonal murine fibroblasts (3T3) nor against immortalized cells, i.e. cervical carcinoma (HeLa), Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK), Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells (CRFK). However, removal of benzyl protection groups at C-2 and C-3 positions of L-AA moiety as in compound 8 Scheme 3. Synthesis of novel alkylated 9-deazapurine derivatives of L-ascorbic (13e15) or imino-L-ascorbic acid (16e19). Reagents and conditions: (i) DEAD/PPh 3 /THF/Ar/\u00c050 to \u00c040 C/3 h/r. t./24 h/40 C/24 h; (ii) NH 4 OH/MeOH/1,4-dioxane/0 C/r. t./24 h. Table 1 1 H NMR chemical shifts (d/ppm) a and HeH coupling constants (J/Hz) of compounds 1e19 (for numeration of atoms in molecular skeleton cf. Fig. 1 ). and conversion of L-AA into imino-L-AA as in analogue 7, resulted in loss of anti-HCMV activity. Compound 3 and its N-9 regioisomer (2) have exhibited comparable effects against Punta Toro virus, but concomitantly showed cytostatic effects on the monkey cell line Vero. In addition, compound 2 exerted moderate activity against Coxsackie B4 virus in Vero cells and no cytostatic effects on cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) used in the antiviral assays. The 7deazapurine derivatives of L-AA (9, 10) and of imino-L-AA (12) showed no marked cytostatic nor antiviral activities. In contrast, the 9-deazapurine derivatives of L-ascorbic acid (13, 15) and of imino-L-ascorbic acid (18) exhibited marked effects against the murine leukemia cell line (L1210/0) at micromolar concentrations (IC 50 ), while the 2,6-dimethoxy-9-deazapurine and L-ascorbic acid derivative (13) also displayed effects against CEM/0 cells. In addition, the 9-deazahypoxanthine derivative disubstituted with two Lascorbic acid moieties (15) had strong activity against HeLa cells.\n\nConversion of L-ascorbic acid moiety of compound 15 into imino-Lascorbic acid, resulted in gaining compound 18 which showed activity against the pancreatic carcinoma cell line (MiaPaCa-2). The 9deazapurine derivatives 13, 15 and 18 did not shown any cytotoxic effects on embryonal murine fibroblasts (3T3). Furthermore, the 9deazahypoxanthine derivative disubstituted with two L-AA moieties at N-1 and N-7 positions (15) exhibited even stronger activity against Punta Toro virus than compounds 2 and 3, with 3-and 22folds lower EC 50 's than dexstran-sulphate (DS-10000) and ribavirin, respectively. However compound 15 is also cytotoxic to uninfected Vero cells.\n\nCommercially available chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Germany) and Acros (Belgium) and where used without purification. All solvents used in synthesis were analytical grade purity and dried. Acetonitrile (CH 3 CN) was refluxed over calcium hydride (CaH 2 ), distilled and stored over 3 \u00c5 molecular sieves. 1,2-Dichloroethane (C 2 H 4 Cl 2 ) and dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2 ) were distilled from phosphorus pentoxide (P 2 O 5 ) and stored over 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves. 1,4-Dioxane was dried with sodium and also stored over 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves. Methanol (CH 3 OH) was stored over 3 \u00c5 molecular sieves without distillation. 1,4-Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was pre-dried over calcium hydride and refluxed over sodium benzophenone ketyl (sodium wire and benzophenone), distilled and stored over sodium. Melting points were determined on a Kofler micro hot-stage instrument (Reichter, Wien) and were uncorrected. Precoated Merck silica gel 60 F 254 plates were used for thin-layer chromatography and spots were visualized by shortwave UV light (254 nm). Column chromatography was performed on Fluka silica gel (0.063e0.200 mm), with petroleum ether:ethylacetate, dichloromethane:methanol and dichloromethane as mobile phases. Additional purification by rechromatography afforded the analytical samples.\n\nNMR spectroscopy 1 H, 13 \n\nGeneral method for the preparation of 3deazapurine derivatives of 4,5-didehydro-5,6-dideoxy-L-ascorbic acid (2e4) Suspension of anhydrous 3-deazapurine base (B or C, 1 eq.) and (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 (0.1 eq.) in HMDS (25e30 ml) was refluxed overnight under inert atmosphere of argon. Excess HMDS was evaporated under reduced pressure (0.1 mmHg) and silylated base was obtained as a solid. 5,6-di-O-acetyl-2,3-di-O-benzyl-L-ascorbic acid (dAdBAA, 0.7 eq.) and silylated base were dissolved in dry 1,2dichloroethane (20e25 ml) and stirred at room temperature under argon atmosphere. TMSOTf (1.5 eq.) was added to the reaction Table 3 Inhibitory effects of selected 3-and 9-deazapurine derivatives of L-ascorbic (1, 13 and 15) or imino-L-ascorbic acid (17e19) on the growth of malignant cell lines (HeLa, SW260, L1210/0, CEM/0, MiaPaCa-2 and HepG2) as well as their cytotoxic effects on embryonal murine fibroblasts (3T3). \n\nAmmonia was induced in a stirred solution of compounds 1, 2 or 4 (0.11e0.25 mmol), in anhydrous methanol (5e10 ml) and 1,4dioxane (5e10 ml) in ice-cold bath (0 C). After saturation of ammonia, mixture was additionally stirred overnight at room temperature. Methanol, 1,4-dioxane and surplus ammonia were removed at reduced pressure. Purification of crude residue by silica gel column chromatography using dichloro methane:methanol \u00bc 10:1 gave the desired compounds 5e7, respectively as solids. 3.2.6. Procedure for the preparation of 6-chloro-7-iodo-7deazapurine derivative of 4,5-didehydro-5,6-dideoxy-L-ascorbic acid (3,4-di-O-benzyl-5-(9-(6-chloro-7-iodo-7H-pyrrolo [2,3-d] pyrimidine-9-yl)ethylidene)furan-2(5H)-one, 10)\n\nSolution of triphenyl-phosphine (PPh 3 , 241.3 mg; 0.92 mmol), diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD, 0.18 ml; 0.92 mmol) in absolute dry tetrahydrofuran (THF, 3.8 ml) was stirred under inert argon atmosphere for one hour at \u00c040 to \u00c050 C. Solution of 6-chloro-7iodo-7-deazapurine (E, 140.0 mg; 0.50 mmol) and THF (1.5 ml) was then added to reaction mixture and stirred for another 1 h at \u00c040 to \u00c050 C temperature, under inert atmosphere of argon. 6-Hydroxy-2,3-di-O-benzyl-4,5-didehydro-L-ascorbic acid (HdBAA, 185.4 mg; 0.55 mmol) was dissolved in absolute dry THF (1.8 ml) and added to the mixture which was then stirred at \u00c040 to \u00c050 C which was risen gradually to room temperature and stirred overnight.

Method C. General procedure for the preparation of 7deazapurine derivatives of imino-L-ascorbic acid (11, 12) Ammonia was induced in stirred solution of compounds 9 or 10 (0.13e0.14 mmol) and anhydrous methanol (2.0e2.25 ml) and dioxane (2.0e2.25 ml) in ice-cold bath (0 C). After saturation with ammonia, mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. Methanol, 1,4-dioxane and surplus ammonia were removed in vacuum.

Solution of 7-deazapurine bases (F or G, 1 eq.) and THF (4.5 ml) was then added to reaction mixture and stirred an hour at \u00c040 to \u00c050 C, under inert atmosphere of argon. 6-Hydroxy-2,3-di-O-benzyl-4,5-didehydro-L-ascorbic acid (HdBAA, 0.9e1.0 eq.) was soluted in absolute dry THF (5.0 ml) and was added to the mixture and stirred at \u00c040 to \u00c050 C which was gradually risen to room temperature and stirred overnight. Crude reaction product was retained by evaporation of the raw reaction mixture in vacuo and was purified by silica gel column chromatography (nhexane:ethyl-acetate \u00bc 2:1, dichloromethane:methanol \u00bc 175:1) and rechromatography (n-hexane:ethyl-acetate \u00bc 1:1, dichloromethane:methanol \u00bc 120:1) which gave compounds 13e15.\n\n3.2.8.1. 3,4-di-O-benzyl-5-(7-(2,4-dimethoxy-5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine-7-yl)ethylidene)furan-2(5H)-one (13) . According to procedure D, solution of 2,6-dimethoxy-9-deazapurine (F, 250.0 mg; 1.4 mmol), PPh 3 (587.5 mg; 2.24 mmol), DEAD (0.44 ml; 2.24 mmol) and HdBAA (410.0 mg; 1.2 mmol) in THF (13.5 ml) was stirred under inert argon atmosphere at \u00c040 to \u00c050 C for 3 h and then at room temperature overnight. Crude reaction product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (n-hexane:ethylacetate \u00bc 2:1) and rechromatoraphy (n-hexane:ethylacetate For the HCMV assays, confluent human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts were grown in 96-well microtiter plates and infected with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strains, AD-169 and Davis at 100 PFU per well. After a 2-h incubation period, residual virus was removed and the infected cells were further incubated with medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds (in duplicate). After incubation for 7 days at 37 C, virusinduced cytopathogenicity was monitored microscopically after ethanol fixation and staining with Giemsa. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity by 50%. EC 50 's were calculated from graphic plots of the percentage of cytopathogenicity as a function of concentration of the compounds.\n\nThe laboratory wild-type VZV strain Oka and the thymidine kinase-deficient VZV strain 07-1 were used for VZV infections. Confluent HEL cells grown in 96-well microtiter plates were inoculated with VZV at an input of 20 PFU per well. After a 2-h incubation period, residual virus was removed and varying concentrations of the test compounds were added (in duplicate). Antiviral activity was expressed as EC 50 , or compound concentration required to reduce viral plaque formation by 50% after 5 days as compared with untreated controls.\n\nThe cytostatic activity measurements were based on the inhibition of cell growth. HEL cells were seeded at a rate of 5 \u00c2 10 3 cells/ well into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to proliferate for 24 h. Then, medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After 3 days of incubation at 37 C, the cell number was determined with a Coulter counter. The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC 50 , or the compound concentration required to reduce cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls. CC 50 values were estimated from graphic plots of the number of cells (percentage of control) as a function of the concentration of the test compounds. Alternatively, cytotoxicity of the test compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology.\n\nCell lines HeLa (cervical carcinoma), SW620 (colorectal adenocarcinoma, metastatic), MiaPaCa-2 (pancreatic carcinoma), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), CFPAC-1 (pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells) and 3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line), were cultured as monolayers and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 at 37 C.\n\nThe panel cell lines were inoculated onto a series of standard 96-well microtiter plates on day 0, at 5000 cells per well. Test agents were then added in five, 10-fold dilutions (0.01e100 mM) and incubated for further 72 h. Working dilutions were freshly prepared on the day of testing in the growth medium. The solvent (DMSO) was also tested for eventual inhibitory activity by adjusting its concentration to be the same as in the working concentrations (DMSO concentration never exceeded 0.1%). After 72 h of incubation, the cell growth rate was evaluated by performing the MTT assay: experimentally determined absorbance values were transformed into a cell percentage growth (PG) using the formulas proposed by NIH and described previously [25] . This method directly relies on control cells number at the day of assay because it compares the growth of treated cells with the growth of untreated cells in control wells on the same plate e the results are therefore a percentile difference from the calculated expected value. The IC 50 values for each compound were calculated from doseeresponse curves using linear regression analysis by fitting the mean test concentrations that give PG values above and below the reference value. If, however, all of the tested concentrations produce PGs exceeding the respective reference level of effect (e.g. PG value of 50) for a given cell line, the highest tested concentration is assigned as the default value (in the screening data report that default value is preceded by a \">\" sign). Each test point was performed in quadruplicate in three individual experiments. The results were statistically analysed (ANOVA, Tukey post-hoc test at p < 0.05). Finally, the effects of the tested substances were evaluated by plotting the mean percentage growth for each cell type in comparison to control on dose response graphs.\n\nIn this paper we describe the synthesis of new types of 3-, 7-and 9-deazapurine derivatives of L-ascorbic (1e4, 8e10 and 13e15) or imino-L-ascorbic acid (5e7, 11, 12 and 16e19) and their in vitro effects on the growth of tumour cell lines, normal fibroblasts as well as their antiviral activities. Compounds with the most pronounced antitumoural activities, the 9-deazapurine derivative of L-AA (13) and the 9-deazapurine derivatives of imino-L-AA (15 and 18) will serve as leading molecules for synthetic structure modifications with the aim to develop more selective and more active antitumoural substrates in this class of compounds. In addition to that, compound 3 will also be a model skeleton for developing even more effective anti-HCMV substrate."}
