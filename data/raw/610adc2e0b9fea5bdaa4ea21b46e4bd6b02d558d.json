{"title": "METHODS Orientation of helices with respect to the lipid phase probed by paramagnetic relaxation", "body": "To ETM in DPC, we added the lipid analogue 16-DSA, bearing a doxyl paramagnetic radical (spin electron) at position 16 of the alkyl chain. This resulted in a measurable PRE effect that was linearly proportional to the concentration of 16-DSA in the range 1 mM to 5 mM. In this calculation, the ETM system can be described as a pentameric \u03b1-helical bundle (Fig. S3 , A), represented by a cylinder with radius R b , aligned with the z-direction of the laboratory coordinate frame. This cylinder is embedded in a spherical micelle of radius R, and integration should be limited to the volume of the micelle accessible to the probe, V. This volume comprises the core and inner layers of the micelle, i.e., a fraction a of the total micelle volume. The nuclear spin is localized at the immersion depth d (Fig. S3, B) from the surface of the bundle accessible to the paramagnetic probe. For the sake of simplicity, Eq. (1) can be approximated as PRE = a/d 3 , where a is a collection of various fundamental constants. R b is defined by a rolling-sphere approach, with sphere radius of 3 \u00c5, corresponding to the size of the doxyl radical (Fig. S3, D) . Alternatively, PRE can be calculated using a distance from the amide proton to the axis of the pentamer (Fig. S3, C) . The position of this axis can be defined with greater precision than the immersion depth from the surface of the pentamer. In this case the equation can be simplified to PRE = a/(D/2-l) 3 , where a is a collection of various fundamental constants, D is the diameter of the cylinder representing the pentamer and l is the distance from the C 5 symmetry axis to the amide proton.
