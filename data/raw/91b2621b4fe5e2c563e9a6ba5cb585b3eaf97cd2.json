{"title": "Estimation and tests for power-transformed and threshold GARCH models $", "body": "The autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) model proposed by Engle (1982) has led to considerable interest in models in which the conditional variance (volatility) of the current observation, s 2 t , is a function of the past observations. Engle's ARCH model formulated the conditional variance of the process as ''linear'' in squared past values. Bollerslev (1986) generalized ARCH model to allow the conditional variance to depend additionally on its past realizations. Since then many empirical and theoretical aspects of the ARCH/GARCH model have been developed. Shepard (1996) and Rydberg (2000) gave excellent surveys of ARCH/GARCH modelling for financial data. Weiss (1986) and Berkes et al. (2003) established consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimators for ARCH and GARCH model, respectively. The former assumes that the errors have finite fourth moment and the latter requires a moment of errors slightly higher than the fourth. Hall and Yao (2003) showed that when the error is heavy tailed (without finite fourth moment), quasi-maximum likelihood estimators (QMLE) are not asymptotically normal and suffer from slow convergence rate and complex asymptotic distribution, which do not facilitate, among others, statistical tests and interval estimation in the standard manner; see Hall and Yao (2003) , and Mikosch and Straumann (2006) . Peng and Yao (2003) pointed out that a kind of least absolute deviations estimator (LADE) has asymptotic normality if the error distribution has finite second moment.\n\nMany extensions and generalizations of the ARCH model have appeared (see Engle and Bollerslev, 1986; Higgins and Bera, 1992; Li and Li, 1996; Hwang and Kim, 2004; Hwang and Basawa, 2004) . Among all the extensions, the functional form for s 2 t is of great importance (see Higgins and Bera, 1992) . Even Engle (1982) has acknowledged that ''it is likely that other formulations of the variance may be more appropriate for the particular applications''. Hsieh (1989) found that the GARCH models cannot fit some exchange rates satisfactorily; Scheinkman and LeBaron (1989) found evidence that volatility in stock market data cannot be captured completely by linear ARCH models; Gourie\u00b4roux (1997, p. 90) indicated that the heteroscedasticity varies depending on whether the error is positive or negative. This leads to asymmetric threshold ARCH modelling. The study of Li and Li (1996) has showed that threshold-asymmetric modelling provides better fitting compared with symmetric ARCH in the field of financial time series. Therefore, combining the above ideas, Hwang and Kim (2004) proposed a broad class of power-transformed and threshold ARCH model:\n\nwhere d40, a 0 40, a 1i X0, a 2i X0 are unknown parameters, i \u00bc 1; . . . ; p. Here, f t g is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, and t is independent of fX t\u00c0k ; kX1g for all t. They studied the geometric ergodicity and existence of moments of the model, and investigated a large sample test for ARCH structures based on the uniform local asymptotic normality approach. However, the s t in Hwang and Kim's (2004) model is only a function of the past p observations. Hwang and Basawa (2004) introduced a Box-Cox transformed threshold GARCH(1,1) model by allowing s t to depend on s t\u00c01 and studied the stationarity and moment structure of the model. Liu (2006) investigated the tail behavior of the Box-Cox transformed threshold GARCH(1,1) model. We consider a more general power-transformed and threshold GARCH model, in which s t is a function of not only the past p observations but also the past q values of s t itself. A power-transformed and threshold GARCH\u00f0p; q\u00de model (PTTGARCH\u00f0p; q\u00de) is defined as\n\nwhere d, a 0 , a 1i , a 2i , t are the same as those in model (1.1), and b j X0; j \u00bc 1; . . . ; q. As we can see, besides the standard GARCH model (Bollerslev, 1986) i.e., d \u00bc 1 and a 1i \u00bc a 2i ; i \u00bc 1; . . . ; p, model (1.2) includes diverse nonlinear and asymmetric models as special cases. For example, it becomes a Box-Cox transformed ARCH model (Higgins and Bera, 1992) when d \u00bc 2; q \u00bc 0, a TARCH model (Li and Li, 1996) when d \u00bc 1 2 ; q \u00bc 0, a power-transformed and threshold ARCH model (Hwang and Kim, 2004) when q \u00bc 0, a Box-Cox transformed threshold GARCH(1,1) model (Hwang and Basawa, 2004) \n\nThe main goal of this paper is to study the estimation and tests for model (1.2). We differ from Hwang and Kim (2004) and Hwang and Basawa (2004) in the following ways:\n\n(a) Our model is not a pure ARCH model or a simple GARCH(1,1). There are q GARCH terms in model (1.2). (b) Instead of the uniform local asymptotic normality approach of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we consider Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) for PTTGARCH\u00f0p; q\u00de model and obtain asymptotic normality of QMLE under the condition that the error distribution has finite fourth moment. (c) Our LADE approach relaxes the moment condition for the error distribution to the minimum. Its asymptotic normality enables us to do statistical inference on PTTGARCH\u00f0p; q\u00de model with heavy-tailed errors.\n\nWe also give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a strictly stationary solution of model (1.2), and study the existence of the moments and the tail behavior of the model. Furthermore, an order selection method is established by using the Wald statistic based on the asymptotic normality of LADE for a heavy-tailed PTTGARCH\u00f0p; q\u00de model. A simulation study indicates that the LADE is more accurate than the QMLE when the errors are heavy-tailed. We give a real data example to illustrate the practicality of our theory. Our results in this paper is relevant because much empirical evidence shows that financial data often have heavy tails (see Adler et al., 1997; Mittnik and Rachev, 2000) .\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, asymptotic normality of QMLE and LADE is established. Section 3 investigates tests for GARCH structures and the order selection problem. Section 4 presents a simulation study and a real data example. All the proofs of the main results in Sections 2 and 3 are presented in Section 5. The Appendix presents the stationarity and existence of moments for PTTGARCH\u00f0p; q\u00de model.\n\nIn the sequel, ! L , ! P and ! a:s: denote convergence in distribution, in probability and almost surely, respectively. A 0 denotes the transpose of a vector or a matrix A, k \u00c1 k denotes the Euclidean norm unless declared otherwise and C is a constant which may be different at different places.\n\nSuppose that the data generating process is model (1.2). To avoid pathological cases, we assume that a 1p or a 2p 40, and b q 40 if q40. Let f \u00bc \u00f0d; a 0 ; a 11 ; a 21 ; . . . ; a 1p ; a 2p ; b 1 ; . . . ; b q \u00de 0 be the parametric vector with true value f 0 \u00bc \u00f0d 0 ; a 0 0 ; a 0 11 ; a 0 21 ; . . . ; a 0 1p ; a 0 2p ; b 0 1 ; . . . ; b 0 q \u00de 0 . Define\n\nOur basic assumptions are as follows.\n\n(A1) t is non-degenerate and symmetrically distributed. Furthermore, Ej t j D o \u00fe 1 for some D40, and lim t!0 t \u00c0m Pf 2 t ptg \u00bc 0 for some m40.\n\n(2.1) (A2) Y is a compact subset of R d , d \u00bc 2p \u00fe q \u00fe 2 f 0 is in the interior of Y, and the Lyapunov exponent g\u00f0f\u00deo0 for all f 2 Y (see (A.4) in the Appendix).\n\nRemark 1. Because of the compactness of Y, there exist positive constants d 1 ; d 2 ; r 0 such that 0od 1 od; a 0 od 2 , d 1 p P q i\u00bc1 b i pr 0 o1 for any f 2 Y.\n\nUnder assumptions (A1) and (A2), it may be deduced that (1.2) implies that\n\n. \u00f02:7\u00de\n\nIn the above expressions, we set \u00f0X \u00fe t \u00de 2d log\u00f0X \u00fe t \u00de 2 \u00bc 0 if X t p0 and \u00f0X \u00c0 t \u00de 2d log\u00f0X \u00c0 t \u00de 2 \u00bc 0 if X t X0. In practice, however, s t \u00f0f\u00de cannot be computed using Eq. (2.2), since X t is only observed for 1ptpn. We have to use the following approximation for s t \u00f0f\u00de based on fX 1 ; . . . ; X n g. In this subsection, we deal with QMLE of the parameters. The logarithm of the quasi-likelihood function (omitted some constant) is defined as\n\nwhere s t \u00f0f\u00de is defined by (2.2). The QMLE of f isf n \u00bc argmax f2Y L n \u00f0f\u00de. Define\n\nIn order to obtain the consistency and asymptotic normality off n , we need an additional condition, namely (A3) E 2 t \u00bc 1, and E 4 t o1.\n\nRemark 2. If t has density at 0, then (2.1) is satisfied for any mo 1 2 .\n\nThe following theorem shows thatf n is consistent and asymptotically normal.\n\nTheorem 1. Under assumptions (A1)-(A3), it follows that\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we can only observe X 1 ; . . . ; X n in practice. So we replace L n \u00f0f\u00de b\u1ef9\n\nSimilarly, we definef n \u00bc argmax f2YLn \u00f0f\u00de. Let\n\nwherel t \u00f0f\u00de are defined similar to l t \u00f0f\u00de by replacing s t \u00f0f\u00de bys t \u00f0f\u00de. The next theorem shows that our results for f n are the same as those forf n , andL\u00f0f n \u00de and\u00d5\u00f0f n \u00de are consistent estimators of L 0 and O 0 , respectively.\n\nTheorem 2. Under assumptions (A1)-(A3), it follows that \n\nwhere G is a s \u00c2 d constant matrix with rank s, and y is s \u00c2 1 constant vector. By Theorems 2 and 4 in the next section, the asymptotic distributions of the likelihood ratio (LR) test statistic, the Lagrange multiplier (LM) test statistic and the Wald test statistic are w 2 .\n\nRemark 3. From the above discussion, it can be seen that if we apply QMLE, we need Assumption (A3), which is quite restrictive on the parameter vector and excludes the heavy tailed cases.\n\nWe have seen from the above that the QMLE requires stringent moment conditions on t and X t . However, empirical evidence indicates that financial data may have heavy tails. In recent years, the problem of statistical inference about GARCH-type models with weak moment conditions on x t and t has attracted much attention (see Hall and Yao, 2003) . We introduce LADE for PTTGARCH\u00f0p; q\u00de model, which only requires conditions for strict stationarity and assumption (A4). Define an objective function as in Peng and Yao (2003) \n\nwhere u \u00bc u\u00f0n\u00de is a positive number satisfying u\u00f0n\u00de ! 1 and u\u00f0n\u00de=n ! 0 as n ! 1. The LADE is a minimizer of the objective function on the parameter spac\u00ea\n\n, wherev is a minimizer of\n\n(2.12)\n\nWe need the following condition on the error distribution instead of Assumption (A3).\n\n(A4) log j t j has zero median and a differentiable positive density function f \u00f0x\u00de such that sup x2R jf \u00f0x\u00dejo B 1 o1 and sup x2R jf 0 \u00f0x\u00dejoB 2 o1.\n\nTheorem 3. Suppose that conditions (A1), (A2) and (A4) hold. Then for any given positive random variable M with P\u00f00oMo1\u00de \u00bc 1, there exists a local minimizerf ofS n \u00f0f\u00de which lies in the random region\n\n.\n\nHere x is a normal random vector with mean 0 and covariance matrix \u00f01=4f 2 \u00f00\u00de\u00deS \u00c01 .\n\nThe LR test, the LM test and the Wald test are the three standard approaches to constructing test statistics for parametric hypotheses. However, the first two depend on the likelihood function and MLE, which are very sensitive to heavy tails (see Hall and Yao, 2003) . Therefore, we use a Wald test statistic based on LADE for the heavy-tailed case. We consider a general form of linear null hypothesis (2.10). A Wald test statistic is defined as\n\n\u00f0Gf n \u00c0 y\u00de.\n\nWe reject H 0 for large values of W n \u00f0s\u00de. In the above expression,\n\nwhereD t \u00f0f n \u00de is defined similar to D t \u00f0f n \u00de by replacing s t \u00f0f\u00de bys t \u00f0f\u00de, K\u00f0\u00c1\u00de is a density function on R, and b n 40 is a bandwidth. The following theorem gives the limiting distribution of W n \u00f0s\u00de under H 0 .\n\nTheorem 4. Suppose the conditions of Theorem 3 hold. If the kernel function K and the bandwidth b n satisfy the following assumptions:\n\n(i) K is Lipschitz continuous and of finite first moment;\n\n(ii) b n ! 0 and nb 4 n ! 1 as n ! 1, then W n \u00f0s\u00de ! L w 2 s under H 0 .\n\nFor testing an order \u00f0p; q\u00de against a higher order \u00f0p; Q 0 \u00de or \u00f0P 0 ; q\u00de with P 0 4p and Q 0 4q, we can take a G in (2.10) such that\n\nand y \u00bc \u00f00; . . . ; 0\u00de 0 \u00f0Q 0 \u00c0q\u00de\u00c21 or y \u00bc \u00f00; . . . ; 0\u00de 0 2\u00f0P 0 \u00c0p\u00de\u00c21 . Notice that a GARCH\u00f0p; q\u00de model cannot be tested directly against an GARCH\u00f0P 0 ; Q 0 \u00de using the standard technique because of the identification problem already discussed by Bollerslev (1986) , and the situation is the same for PTTGARCH \u00f0p; q\u00de models. As pointed out by Ling (2005) , the above test procedure is very useful in model building. In fact, we can use it to select the order. Suppose that the order of model (1.2) does not exceed \u00f0P 0 ; Q 0 \u00de. For a given significant level Z, we can take the above test in order for p \u00bc P 0 \u00c0 1; . . . ; s 0 and q \u00bc Q 0 \u00c0 1; . . . ; r 0 in (3.2) until p \u00bc s 0 and q \u00bc r 0 such that W n \u00f0s\u00de4w 2 s \u00f0Z\u00de. Then we can declare that the order of model (1.2) is \u00f0s 0 ; r 0 \u00de.\n\nBecause model (1.2) is a very general framework, we can test whether some special case is true or not. In the following, we mainly discuss testing problems about GARCH structures for fX t g:\n\n. . . ; 0; 1\u00de 0 p\u00fe2 ; y 3 \u00bc \u00f00; . . . ; 0\u00de 0 p ; y 4 \u00bc 1. Then the above four testing problems can be written in the form with\n\nSo the Wald test provides a simple way to test the null hypothesis of a particular specification against wider nonlinear alternatives. For example, we can determine whether Bollerslev's standard model provides an adequate description of the data by testing H 10 .\n\nIn this section, we perform a simulation study to demonstrate the accuracy of LADE in heavy-tailed case and apply the theory in Sections 2 and 3 to the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index (HSI) series.\n\nFirstly, we compare numerically LADE and QMLE for the PTTGARCH(1,1) model. The data are generated by the PTTGARCH(1,1) model\n\n, with the true parameter \u00f0d 0 ; a 0 0 ; a 0 11 ; a 0 21 ; b 0 1 \u00de 0 \u00bc \u00f00:8; 0:2; 0:2; 0:1; 0:4\u00de 0 . We take the errors t to have either a standard normal distribution or a standardized Student's t-distribution with degrees of freedom d \u00bc 2, 3, 4, 5. The sample size is n \u00bc 600 and we draw 1000 independent samples. For LADE, u was set to be u \u00bc 10. Fig. 1 presents the boxplots of the average absolute error (AAE) \u00f0jd \u00c0 0:8j \u00fe j\u00e2 0 \u00c0 0:2j \u00fe j\u00e2 11 \u00c0 0:2j \u00fe j\u00e2 21 \u00c0 0:1j \u00fe jb 1 \u00c0 0:4j\u00de=5 for both LADE and QMLE. For samples with heavy-tailed errors, i.e., t\u00f02\u00de, t\u00f03\u00de and t\u00f04\u00de, LADE performs better than QMLE especially for t\u00f02\u00de and t\u00f03\u00de. As expected, QMLE is better when the errors are t\u00f05\u00de and N\u00f00; 1\u00de.\n\nThen we apply the PTTGARCH model to daily HSI from 2001 to 2003, which has a total of 738 observations. The return series X t is defined as the percentage of the log difference of the index. Figs. 2 and 3 are the time plots of the index and the return, respectively. They display some drastic shocks, which are caused by the 11/9 terrorist attack on 11-09-2001 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China erupted in March 2003.\n\nWe first study whether or not fX t g is heavy-tailed. The Hill estimator and the QQ-plot are used for this. The Hill estimator is defined as\n\nwhere X \u00f01\u00de XX \u00f02\u00de X \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 XX \u00f0n\u00de are the order statistics of X 1 ; . . . ; X n . We plot f\u00f0m; H n;m \u00de; 1pmp600g in Fig. 4 , which suggests that X t has an infinite fourth moment or even probably infinite variance, since the estimator is less than 4 for mX20 and less than 2 for mX200. Fig. 5 presents the QQ-plot for fX t g, which suggests that fX t g is very heavy-tailed. To test whether fX t g is white noise, we use the Wald test statistics based on the weighted least absolute estimators with the weight function\n\n( where a t \u00bc P p i\u00bc1 jX t\u00c0i jI\u00f0jX t\u00c0i jXC\u00de and C is the 90 percent quantile of the data fX t g (see Ling, 2005 for details), since the Box-Pierce statistic is not applicable for the heavy-tailed case. Here and in the following we take the kernel function K\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc e \u00c0x =\u00f01 \u00fe e \u00c0x \u00de 2 and b n \u00bc 1:06n \u00c01=5 (Silverman, 1986, p. 40) . We obtain that W n \u00f08\u00de \u00bc 2:31 and W n \u00f012\u00de \u00bc 2:76. Both are not significant at 0.05 level. However, for the squared series fX 2 t g, we obtain that W 2 n \u00f08\u00de \u00bc 105:85 and W 2 n \u00f012\u00de \u00bc 108:55, which are highly significant at the level 0.05. This suggests that the series fX t g has conditional heteroscedastic structure. For the standardized residuals, we obtain W n \u00f08\u00de \u00bc 4:88 and W n \u00f012\u00de \u00bc 7:28; for the squared standardized residuals, we obtained W 2 n \u00f08\u00de \u00bc 15:21 and W 2 n \u00f012\u00de \u00bc 17:64. Based on the 5% significance level of the w 2 \u00f08\u00de and w 2 \u00f012\u00de distribution, the PTTGARCH(1,1) model fits the data adequately according to both statistics W 2 n \u00f08\u00de, W 2 n \u00f012\u00de, W 2 n \u00f08\u00de, and W 2 n \u00f012\u00de. Fig. 6 shows the Hill estimator of the standardized residuals, which indicates that the residuals may have infinite fourth moment since the Hill estimator is less than 3:5 when mX80. The QQ-plot in Fig. 7 also shows that the residuals are heavy-tailed. Thus, we fit a PTTGARCH model to the data with LADE.\n\nFor order selection, we assume that p; qp3 for simplicity. Using the procedure for order selection in Section 3, we test p \u00bc 3, q \u00bc 2 vs p \u00bc 3, q \u00bc 3; p \u00bc 3, q \u00bc 1 vs p \u00bc 3, q \u00bc 2; and p \u00bc 2, q \u00bc 1 vs p \u00bc 1, q \u00bc 1 in order, and all the Wald statistics are less than 1, namely not significant. Then we test p \u00bc 1, q \u00bc 1 vs p \u00bc 1, q \u00bc 0, To check the adequacy of the estimated PTTGARCH(1,1) model, we conduct the white noise test for the residuals and the squared residuals using the same method as for X t before. We have W n \u00f08\u00de \u00bc 2:60 and W n \u00f012\u00de \u00bc 3:41 for the residuals and W 2 n \u00f08\u00de \u00bc 11:99 and W 2 n \u00f012\u00de \u00bc 17:46 for the squared residuals, which are all not significant at 0.05 level. Hence, the estimated PTTGARCH(1,1) model is adequate for the data fX t g. Notice that for both the residuals and the squared residuals, all the Wald statistics based on LADE are less than those based on QMLE, which suggests that the fitted model based on LADE is the more adequate. For the fitted model using LADE, we also test the hypotheses d \u00bc 1 and a 11 \u00bc a 21 , respectively. The Wald statistic for the former is 14.24 and is highly significant. The Wald statistic for the latter is 2.41 and is not significant, which may be caused by the small values of a 11 and a 21 . In fact, as we can see from the estimators,\u00e2 21 is about five times\u00e2 11 . This example illustrates that the data are asymmetric and nonlinear and the PTTGARCH model is capable of capturing these characteristics.\n\nWe use the same notation as in Section 2 and Section 3. Before we prove Theorems 1-4, we introduce some lemmas first. Proof. Denote\n\nBy Lemma 3.1 of Berkes et al. (2003) , there exist some constants C40 and 0oro1 such that 0od it pCr t ; i \u00bc 1; 2; t \u00bc 0; 1; . . . , where C and r are both independent of f.

We only prove the case m \u00bc 1. The proof of the case m41 is similar. From (2.11) and (2.12), it is sufficient to prove that E sup By the definition of s 2d t , we have s 2d t 4a 0 Xd 1 , where d 1 is the positive constant in Remark 1. Notice that for any given positive integers h, there exists M 1 40 such that \u00f0log x\u00de h pxh for x4M 1 , whereh \u00bc minf1; t=\u00f02d 2 \u00deg, t and d 2 are defined, respectively, in Theorem 6 and Remark 1. By Lemma 1, it follows that \n\nwhere r 0 is the same one as in Remark 1 and L \n\nIt can be easily verified that\n\n; for any x 1 ; x 2 ; y 1 ; y 2 40.\n\nLet I 1 \u00bc Ifj log X \u00fe t\u00c0i\u00c0j\u00c0j 1 \u00c0\u00c1\u00c1\u00c1\u00c0j k jp1g and I 2 \u00bc 1 \u00c0 I 1 . Noticing (2.1) holds, We obtain E sup Proof. By Lemmas 2 and 3, it is obvious that L\u00f0f\u00de is well defined. Maximizing L\u00f0f\u00de is equivalent to minimizing L\u00f0f 0 \u00de \u00c0 L\u00f0f\u00de.

(i) Our proof is similar to that of Bougerol and Picard (1992) . Firstly, we prove that E log \u00fe kA 0 ko \u00fe 1, which ensures that the Lyapunov exponent g\u00f0f\u00de is well defined.

Then fY t ; t 2 Zg defined by (A.1) is a strictly stationary solution of (A.3). From (A.3), we have, for all t40\n\nThen for any t40, P t\u00c01 k\u00bc0 A 0 \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 A \u00c0k BpY 0 by the nonnegativity of all elements of A t , Y t and B. This indicates that P t\u00c01 k\u00bc0 A 0 \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 A \u00c0t B converges almost surely, as t ! 1. Therefore, A 0 \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 A \u00c0t B ! a:s: 0 as t ! 1. By Lemma 2.1 of Bougerol and Picard (1992) , it is sufficient to prove A 0 \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 A \u00c0t ! a:s: 0. Let fe i g be the canonical basis of R k , and we only need to prove that lim t!1 A 0 \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 A \u00c0t e i \u00bc 0; i \u00bc 1; . . . ; k. (A.6) Since B \u00bc de 1 and d40, (A.6) holds for i \u00bc 1. Notice that A \u00c0t e q \u00bc b q e 1 , A \u00c0t e j\u00c01 \u00bc b j\u00c01 e 1 \u00fe e j ; 2ojpq, A \u00c0t e k \u00bc a 2p e 1 , A \u00c0t e k\u00c01 \u00bc a 1p e 1 , A \u00c0t e q\u00fe2j \u00bc a 2;j\u00fe1 e 1 \u00fe e q\u00fe2j\u00fe1 ; 1pjpp \u00c0 2, A \u00c0t e q\u00fe2j\u00c01 \u00bc a 1;j\u00fe1 e 1 \u00fe e q\u00fe2j ; 1pjpp \u00c0 2, we obtain (A.6) holds for 1pipk. Sufficiency: Assume g\u00f0f\u00deo0. Then (A.4) implies that the series P 1 k\u00bc0 A t \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 A t\u00c0k B converges almost surely for all t. Define fY t ; t 2 Zg as follows:\n\nIt is easy to verify that fY t ; t 2 Zg is a nonnegative solution of (A.3). Let s t \u00bc \u00f0Y 1 t\u00c01 \u00de 1=2d , where Y 1 t\u00c01 is the first component of Y t\u00c01 . Then X t \u00bc s t t is a solution of model (1.2). The strict stationarity and ergodicity of X t can be derived by noticing that f\u00f0A t ; t \u00de; t 2 Zg is strictly stationary and ergodic. In the following, we will prove ARTICLE IN PRESS Y t is the unique solution of (A.3).
