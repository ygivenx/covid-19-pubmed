{"title": "Paramyxovirus Infections in Ex Vivo Lung Slice Cultures of Different Host Species", "body": "Ex vivo models provide an important bridge between in vitro and in vivo experiments. The use of agarose-inflated lung slices for respiratory virus pathogenesis studies has been described previously [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Here, we describe a protocol in which agarose-inflated lung slices can be kept viable in culture for at least seven days post-necropsy of an experimental animal. The combination of these viable lung slices with recombinant viruses expressing fluorescent reporter proteins [7,8,9] allows for accurate, sensitive and reproducible assessment of respiratory virus infection and dissemination over time. Furthermore, use of these recombinant viruses allows for real time monitoring of infection processes, using multiple methods for measurement of fluorescence (e.g., flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy). Lung slices are also suitable for analysis by immunohistochemistry, thereby visualizing virus cell tropism and spatial localization of infected cells within the tissue. We have validated this technique by infecting lung slices of multiple host species (cotton rats, ferrets, dogs and macaques) with various paramyxoviruses expressing fluorescent reporter proteins (measles virus (MV), canine distemper virus (CDV), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV)) [10]. This technique, however, is directly transferable to different host species and different viruses [11]. \n\nIn addition to using lung slices as an ex vivo culture and infection system, the method can also be used to screen the lungs of in vivo virus-infected animals for infection and determine the viral tropism (e.g., see reference [3]). Two approaches are possible: instead of inflating lungs with the 1:1 mixture of 4% (w/v) low-melting point agarose and lung slice medium, prepare a 1:1 mixture of 4% (w/v) low-melting point agarose and 4% (w/v) PFA in PBS. The rest of the protocol is identical, after preparing lung slices these can be screened by fluorescence microscopy directly, virus-positive slices can be processed further as desired (immunohistochemistry, staining for confocal laser scanning microscopy, preparation of single cell suspensions for flow cytometry). As an alternative, slices can be inflated with 1:1 mixture of 4% (w/v) low-melting point agarose and lung slice medium and kept in culture for a period of time after necropsy, to evaluate viral tropism and dissemination [4].\n\nWith the protocol described here, dependent on the size of the species used in the experiment, viable lung slices from potentially any species can be obtained for ex vivo experiments. We have observed viability of these slices for up to seven days post resection; however, this could be dependent on the species and culture conditions. Infections with respiratory viruses of lung slices are normally relatively successful: Figure 2 and Figure 3 show examples of ex vivo paramyxovirus-infected lung slices. In these experiments, macaque lungs were inflated and infected with MV, which is clearly able to infect the macaque lung slices. Of course, viruses corresponding to the target species should be chosen to obtain positive results. In the family of Paramyxoviridae for example, viruses exclusively infecting primates or carnivores exist. Measles virus, a virus of primates, successfully infected non-human primate but not dog lungs, whereas CDV, a virus of carnivores, behaved vice versa. Using viruses expressing fluorescent reporter proteins allows for sensitive detection of virus-infected cells in these experiments; however, these experiments can also be performed with non-fluorescent viruses. Staining should still make infected cells visible in immunohistochemistry, confocal laser scanning microscopy or flow cytometry.\n\nThe model described here of course has some limitations, as a single region of the lung is directly infected, often with a relatively high inoculum. Therefore, in vivo experiments in animal models of disease are of crucial importance for viral tropism and pathogenesis studies. However, these experiments must be complemented with proper in vitro and ex vivo experiments, indicating the potential of ex vivo experiments in these cultured lung slices."}
