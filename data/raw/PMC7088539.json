{"title": "Solvent/detergent plasma: pharmaceutical characteristics and clinical experience", "body": "The decontamination of S/D plasma is guaranteed by the treatment with both the solvent and the detergent, immunological neutralisation (due to the physiological presence of neutralising antibodies in the pool of plasma for fractionation), as well as by double filtration, which removes cells, cell fragments, and bacteria. S/D treatment is highly effective in disrupting lipid membranes and, therefore, guarantees a high level of safety with regards to all viruses with a lipid envelope (including human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C virus, and emerging ones such as the West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, new influenza strains, and severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus), bacteria, protozoa and intracellular viruses, such as cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and human T cell leukaemia virus I and II [6].\n\nIn addition, the treatment has a high reserve capacity provided by the 4-h incubation time; in fact, it reduces the virus load below detection levels in less than 2 min [6]. While the S/D process effectively destroys more than 5 logs of most enveloped viruses, the vaccinia virus is relatively resistant; this pathogen reduction technique is also less effective against non-enveloped viruses such as hepatitis A and parvovirus B19. The risk of transmitting these infectious agents is reduced by the dilution of any initial viral load, the presence of neutralising antibodies in the plasma pools, the size of plasma pools (60\u2013380 L in comparison to 4,000\u201330,000 L of the pools from which plasma-derived medicinal products are produced) [6], the hydrophobic chromatography to which the product is subject, and by testing each plasma pool for the presence of genomic material [17].\n\nThe concentrations of anti-hepatitis A antibodies in S/D plasma are 30 times the prophylactic dose and should warrant an adequate protection from this infection. The concentrations of antibodies against parvovirus B19 are similar to those of intra-venous immunoglobulins used to treat chronic infections [12] but transfusion transmission of B19 has been reported with S/D plasma [18] and in the 1990s an outbreak of hepatitis A occurred with a factor VIII product [12].\n\nIn conclusion, preclinical virus validation studies, clinical safety virological assessments, and extensive post-marketing clinical experience have clearly shown that the S/D treatment achieves a rapid, irreversible, and thorough inactivation of enveloped viruses. Moreover, the efficacy of the S/D treatment is highlighted by the fact that between 1991 and 2009 approximately 10 million units of S/D plasma were transfused without any documented case of transmission of HBV, HCV or HIV [6].\n\nNevertheless, the \u201ctraditional\u201d S/D pathogen inactivation has only a limited prion clearance capacity as it is able to reduce the PrPSc by only 2.5 logs whereas a further extension of this removal capacity (more than 5 logs) has been recently warranted by the above mentioned \u201cmodified\u201d manufacturing process that includes a specific prion reduction step [6, 15, 16].\n\nAlthough bacteria rarely contaminate FFP because of its storage conditions [19], the impact of S/D on bacterial growth and on the capacity of the complement to kill bacteria has been recently investigated and showed that the S/D treatment of plasma does not alter the bactericidal activity of the complement, and inactivates some gram-positive bacteria [20].\n\nThe dilution and neutralisation of antibodies and allergens during the industrial process of S/D plasma pooling can reduce the incidence of allergic reactions in recipients and also result in a high level of final standardisation of the concentrations of labile and stable clotting factors and other plasma proteins, thus eliminating the biological variability between single units of FFP [9, 17, 21\u201323].\n\nNeither anti-human leucocyte antigen (HLA) nor anti-human neutrophil antigen (HNA) antibodies are detectable in S/D plasma as they are diluted and neutralised by the presence of leukocytes or their fragments, which are then removed by the S/D treatment [24\u201326]. For this reason countries using S/D FFP have not reported any transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) case due to the transfusion of plasma [27, 28].\n\nIn addition, the double filtration of S/D FFP removes residual cells and many of their fragments, thus reducing the possibility of allo-immunisation and cell-mediated adverse immunological reactions in the recipient [17].\n\nRecently, 100 plasma samples obtained from voluntary blood donors in Germany were compared to six aliquots of different lots of S/D plasma through tandem mass spectrometry to assess the presence of drug residues. In 12 % of the analysed specimens, residues of diuretics, beta-receptor blocking agents, stimulants, or contraceptives were detected and they were all within or below levels commonly reported in cases of therapeutic usage. On the contrary, the analysis of the aliquots of S/D plasma preparations yielded no findings of drug residues. These results are attributed to the dilution and the liquid\u2013liquid and solid-phase extraction, which are included in the industrial production process of pathogen inactivated plasma [29].\n\nOther methods for pathogen reduction of plasma currently in use exploit different mechanisms of actions and, consequently, generate a large quantity of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS have a key role in the damage of red blood cells and recently fostered an approach to improving the quality and efficacy of stored red cells focused on reducing oxidative damage by removing oxygen at the beginning of storage and maintaining the anaerobic state throughout the storage period [30]. Very recently Feys et al. [31] revealed the mechanism of damage to plasma constituents by riboflavin and light and showed that generated ROS played a direct role in adversely affecting the biomolecular integrity of relevant plasma constituents such as ADAMTS13, factor VIII and fibrinogen. In this case, plasma product integrity could be maintained by applying hypoxic conditions during the pathogen inactivation process. It is important to note that the formation of singlet oxygen upon illumination is part of the mechanism of action also of the methylene blue (MB) pathogen reduction system [32] whose efficacy is indeed increased in the presence of oxygen [12].\n\nS/D plasma deriving from FFP units prepared and frozen through optimal collection and production procedures [33] has a moderate reduction of clotting factor and inhibitor activities and a final composition similar to FFP. Moreover, thanks to the filtration process, the high molecular weight multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF) are absent. The metalloprotease ADAMTS13, implicated in the pathogenesis of TTP, is normal and stable up to 5 h, even after thawing and storage at room temperature [17]. S/D plasma also contains normal levels of factor H [34], a plasma glycoprotein involved in the control of the complement cascade and with a pathogenic role in atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome. The percentage retention of selected factor is reported in Table 1. The content of factor VIII is about 20 % lower compared to the source FFP and the activity of protein S (PS) is reduced by about 35\u201340 % [6, 10]. Reductions in this order of magnitude are not clinically significant due to the wide reference range (50\u2013200 %) for most clotting factors and inhibitors in single plasma units.\n\n\nThe level of plasmin inhibitor (\u03b12-antiplasmin) is influenced by the duration of the S/D treatment, the size of the plasma pool and the quality of the plasma. It ranges from 20\u201324 to 33 % of normal values in S/D plasma deriving from pools of 200 (South Africa) to 380 (Europe) L [6, 10]; it increases up to 37\u201342 % in French S/D plasma, derived from pools of 60 L, approximately up to 66 % in the above mentioned prion-depleted version of S/D plasma, whose S/D treatment lasts 2\u20133 h less, and up to 80\u201390 % in mini-pools of plasma, where also the activity of PS is less reduced (10\u201320 % of normal).\n\nHowever, there is no evidence supporting a possible role of reduced levels of plasmin inhibitor in the pathogenesis of bleeding from hyperfibrinolysis in patients with altered haemostasis treated with plasma [17]. In fact, in Europe, a retrospective observational study of patients who had undergone orthotopic liver transplantation revealed a higher incidence of laboratory signs of hyperfibrinolysis in patients treated with S/D FFP than in those treated with FFP; the red cell transfusion requirements were not, however, significantly different between the two groups of patients [35]. The hyperfibrinolysis, which was initially attributed to reduced levels of \u03b12-antiplasmin in S/D FFP, was subsequently correlated to the amount of bleeding. Following modifications of the surgical technique and the introduction of low doses of aprotinin no further thrombotic or haemorrhagic complications occurred [36]. In Norway 208 liver transplants were carried out between 1993 and 2001 using S/D FFP and aprotinin, with no reports of thrombotic or haemorrhagic complications [36]. Furthermore, there have been no descriptions of persistent bleeding in patients with congenital or acquired deficiency of plasmin inhibitor treated with S/D plasma-based replacement therapy [22, 37]. Therefore, clinical studies did not confirm the initial concerns due to the low levels of \u03b12-antiplasmin or antitrypsin activity in S/D plasma [6, 22].\n\nBleeding problems in liver transplantation case reports following the use of S/D plasma produced from USA plasma [38] may have been caused by the remarkable differences in the production process of North American plasma with much larger pool sizes and less strict quality requirements regarding separation and freezing.\n\nSignificant differences in the manufacturing processes between PLAS + SD, which was produced in the USA from 1998 to 2002, and the S/D plasma products used in Europe have been reported [17, 22]. These differences include: (i) the way plasma was obtained and the pool size; (ii) the citrate concentration; (iii) the storage time before freezing methods of source plasma, iii) the stabilizing plasma proteins, and (iv) the oil used to extract the solvent-detergent chemicals [39].\n\nThe USA plasma derived from (much larger) pools of 650 L of plasma obtained by fractionation and not by apheresis, had a low citrate concentration that could have been insufficient to avoid coagulation activation, and was separated and frozen 15 h after collection [6, 17, 22, 40]; coagulation factors were stabilized with 2 mM calcium chloride while sodium hydrogen phosphate (5 mM) at pH 6.0\u20137.4 is used in the European manufacturing process; furthermore, TNBP and Triton X-100 were extracted with soybean oil while castor oil is used in Europe; finally, PLAS + SD underwent concentration and ultrafiltration passages not used in the European product.\n\nTherefore, the North American plasma showed a greater decrease in the activities of antitrypsin, plasmin inhibitor activity, and plasmin activator inhibitor, contained residues of TNBP, and had high concentrations of lipoprotein (a), fibrin monomers and C3a des-Arg, a complement activation marker. Moreover, the American product had almost no PS activity, whereas European S/D plasma has a moderate reduction of PS activity and antigen [6, 17, 22, 40, 41].\n\nCollectively, these differences could be responsible for the adverse effects reported after the use of S/D plasma produced in the USA [17, 40, 42], which led to its withdrawal from the market following the notification of six deaths caused by thromboembolic complications after orthotopic liver transplantation [40] and three cases of deep vein thrombosis in patients with TTP treated with plasma-exchange using S/D plasma as the replacement fluid [42]. However, in January 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration approved an S/D plasma product manufactured with plasma collected from US donors as an alternative to single-donor FFP.\n\nBy contrast, in Europe there have been no reports of thromboembolic episodes directly related to treatment with S/D plasma. In a retrospective analysis of 68 patients with TTP treated with plasma-exchange using S/D plasma produced in Europe eight thromboembolic events were found in seven patients, all of whom, however, had additional risk factors [43]. Thrombotic complications were also described after the use of standard FFP and plasma cryosupernatant [44, 45].\n\nIn conclusion, thrombosis or hyperfibrinolytic bleeding triggered by reduced protein S or low plasmin inhibitor potencies in European S/D plasma have not withstood critical review [6, 22].\n\nThe other pathogen reduction technologies for plasma currently in use target nucleic acids, involve the use of visible or ultraviolet light, and are designed for use in blood establishments. They exploit MB, amotosalen, and riboflavin as additives [46]. A novel system exploitable for pathogen inactivation in plasma and platelets is based on short-wave ultraviolet C without photoactive substances and is currently undergoing clinical efficacy and safety testing [32]. A detailed description of these products has been recently addressed by several review articles [32, 46\u201349]. In Table 1 the mechanism of actions of the pathogen reduction systems for plasma currently in use and the main characteristics of the inactivated plasma products are summarised [10, 32, 34, 46\u201358].\n\nAs regards the clinical use of S/D plasma in congenital bleeding disorders, the most important study was published by Horowitz and Pehta [60], who described the effective use of S/D plasma in 48 patients with hereditary deficiencies of factors II, V, X, XI, and XIII treated in 137 transfusion episodes for active bleeding (51 episodes), surgical prophylaxis (47 episodes), or routine prophylaxis (39 episodes). More recently, Santagostino and colleagues reported on 17 patients with recessively inherited coagulation disorders (1 afibrinogenemia, 4 factor V, 6 combined FV and FVIII, 1 factor X, and 5 factor XI deficiencies) [61]. In 13/16 cases (81 %) S/D plasma was fully effective, while in the remaining three cases it was partially effective as the post-surgical mild bleeding was controlled by continuing or increasing treatment with S/D plasma. As was the case in recent studies [62, 63] and also recommended by international guidelines on the appropriate usage of non-inactivated FFP [64\u201366], this article clearly shows that also the dosages of S/D plasma to be used to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment are greater than the traditional ones of 10\u201315 mL per kilogram and frequently are approximately 30 mL per kilogram.\n\nAs regards the use in patients with acquired coagulation deficits, a randomized, double-blinded study assessed the ability of S/D plasma and FFP to reduce a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) to 15 s or less [67]. No differences between S/D plasma and FFP were seen with regard to the mean dose of plasma infused, percentage of patients with corrected PT to \u226415 s (32 % for S/D plasma vs 26 for FFP, p = 0.67) or percentage of patients whose bleeding stopped (27 % for S/D plasma vs 22 % for FFP). Clinical response to plasma therapy was similar between the groups. Similar results were found in another randomized trial conducted by Beck et al. [68] on 40 patients with severe coagulopathy. The efficacy of S/D plasma in patients with coagulation defects associated with liver disease was examined in comparison to standard FFP through a prospective randomized trial [69]. Forty-nine patients with liver disease or undergoing liver transplantation were randomly assigned to receive FFP or S/D plasma prior to procedure (liver biopsy or transplantation) or for severe coagulopathy. The dose of plasma infused was similar between the groups. Results showed that correction of clotting factor levels and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was equal with FFP and S/D plasma. The greater decrease in the International Normalized ratio (INR) seen in the S/D plasma group was attributed by the authors to the higher baseline INR of those patients compared to those in the FFP group. Notably, use of S/D plasma in patients undergoing liver transplantation did not increase the need for other blood components. Two randomized trials analysed the use of S/D plasma in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). In the first study, by Freeman and colleagues [73], 28 patients with coagulopathy following OLT showed equal correction with S/D plasma or FFP. In the second, more recent, study conducted by Bindi and colleagues on 63 OLT patients [74], the use of S/D plasma in association with the monitoring of haemostasis by means of thromboelastography gave the same therapeutic results as FFP but with a significant reduction in the amount of plasma transfused (2,617 \u00b1 1,297 mL in the FFP group vs 1,187 \u00b1 560.6 mL in the S/D plasma group, p < 0.0001). A similar finding (1,549 mL in the FFP group vs 503 mL in the S/D plasma group) emerged also in a case\u2013control study conducted by our group on critically ill patients [75].\n\nAs regards the use of S/D plasma in patients with complex coagulopathy associated with cardiac surgery, a prospective trial found that 36 patients treated with 600 mL of S/D plasma showed a similar rise in factor VIII, fibrinogen, antithrombin, protein C, free PS, alpha-1 antitrypsin and plasminogen as well as a decrease in PT and aPTT as compared with 31 patients treated with 600 mL of FFP [76]. On the other hand, significant differences between these products were found for levels of total PS and plasmin inhibitor. However, clinical haemostasis evaluation revealed no significant difference between the two treatment regimens. These results were in agreement with the previous findings from a randomized clinical trial conducted by Wieding et al. [77] comparing S/D plasma and MB light virus-inactivated plasma in 71 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. A prospective randomized study by Tollofrsud et al. [78] also reported positive experience on the use of S/D plasma in open-heart surgery. Finally, on the basis of the finding that S/D plasma lacks the highest molecular weight vWF multimers [56], which have been involved in the pathogenesis of TTP, some investigators have assessed S/D plasma in the treatment of patients with acute TTP with reported rates of remission between 90 and 100 % [43, 79\u201382]. Furthermore, these studies documented that S/D plasma dramatically reduces [81] or even eliminates [80] allergic reactions.\n\nWhile S/D plasma was withdrawn from the US market more than 10 years ago and only recently has been reintroduced, in Europe it continued to be widely utilized after the laboratory evidence of a markedly different composition from the US product and studies that failed to detect thrombotic complications in similar patient groups [40]. Indeed, haemovigilance national programs clearly demonstrate the safety of S/D plasma in all clinical settings [6]. Clinical experience from France, after the transfusion of more than 1.9 million units of S/D plasma since 1994, and from Finland, after more than 150,000 units since 2005, show a significant reduction in the rate of serious adverse events (approximately 85 %) as compared with standard FFP [83, 84]. Since 1993, in Norway, more than 250,000 units of S/D plasma have been successfully transfused to all categories of patients, including neonates and liver transplant patients, with no cases of transmission of viral diseases, thrombotic complications or TRALI [27, 28]. Similar findings emerged in a Belgian retrospective analysis of 5,064 S/D plasma units transfused in 894 recipients [85]. In the UK more than 350,000 units of S/D plasma have been transfused after the introduction of the Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) haemovigilance system without reports of serious problems [86]. Supporting data was also provided by the Austrian haemovigilance registry, which, in 2004, reported 19 allergic reactions after FFP and only 1 after S/D plasma [87], and by the Italian haemovigilance registry, which reported a significantly lower rate of adverse reactions to S/D plasma compared with non-pharmaceutical FFP [adverse reactions/units \u00d7 1000: 0.06 with PlasmaSafe (Kedrion SpA, Castelvecchio Pascoli, Lucca, Italy) vs 0.48 with FFP, p < 0.01] following the transfusion of over 250,000 units from 2009 to 2011 [88].\n\nThe availability of systems for inactivating pathogens in FFP for clinical use raises the question of whether and, if so, to what extent, these treatments, notoriously used to reduce the risk of post-transfusion infections, should be introduced. The current level of transfusion safety makes the cost-benefit ratio of introducing the use of pathogen-inactivated FFP unfavourable, even in the most economically developed countries, if the benefit is measured only in relation to the residual risk of infection.\n\nThe first cost-effectiveness analysis of S/D-treated plasma was published in 1994 by Aubuchon and Birkmeyer and concluded that \u201cfrom a public health perspective, the relatively high costs and small benefits of reducing enveloped virus infection risks with S/D plasma (and the additional risks of non-enveloped virus transmission)\u201d did not appear \u201cto justify widespread implementation of this technology\u201d [89]. Another two studies assessed the cost-effectiveness of S/D plasma [90, 91]. All three studies yielded a wide range of cost/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimates ($ 289,300 [89], $ 2,156,000 [90], and $9,743,000 [91]) and concluded that the increased level of safety of S/D plasma did not justify its considerable additional cost.\n\nHowever, as these studies did not consider several relatively common non-infective transfusion-related complications, they greatly underestimated the cost-effectiveness of this blood component.\n\nWhen Riedler and co-workers considered various infective and non-infective transfusion-related complications, such as TRALI, S/D plasma proved to be a cost-effective treatment for all patients aged 48 and under (the cost per life-year saved remained below \u00a3 50,000) and in older patients with good clinical prognosis [92].\n\nvan Eerd et al. [93] confirmed the cost-effectiveness of S/D plasma also in critically ill patients through an analysis based on a model structure originally developed by the Canadian Agency of Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). However, differently from the CADTH study [94], which highlighted incremental cost per each QALY gained of $79,100 and incremental cost per life-year saved of $95,700, they also included severe allergic reactions in their cost-utility analysis model. Treatment with inactivated plasma resulted in 0.03 QALYs and 0.03 life-years saved compared to FFP and pathogen-reduced plasma was considered to be cost-effective at a threshold of \u00a3 30,000 ($ 47,548) per QALY.\n\nThe latest published cost-effectiveness and budget impact study includes the risk of (severe) allergic reactions, bacterial infections, prion disease and two unknown viruses in the analysis [95]. S/D plasma resulted in 0.021 QALYs gained in comparison with FFP and the probability of being cost-effective at a CA$ 30,000 per QALY threshold was greater than 98 %. Therefore, it can be considered cost saving and is also able to provide additional benefits in terms of safety in comparison to FFP, which is the current standard of care.\n\nIn conclusion, as cost-effectiveness analyses relate the costs of a programme/technique to its key outcome or benefits, we deem that when the projected benefits of S/D plasma usage also include the elimination/reduction of complications such as TRALI and (severe) allergic reactions as well as the prevention of complications caused by emerging/unknown infectious agents the computed cost-effectiveness ratio can really be able to support a (robust) recommendation aiming at including this therapeutic tool in the current standard of care.\n\nS/D plasma is a pharmaceutical product with a standardised content of clotting factors, devoid of antibodies implicated in TRALI pathogenesis, and with a very high level of decontamination from transfusion-transmissible infectious agents that has been in production for thirty years now. Many clinical studies have confirmed its efficacy in congenital and acquired bleeding disorders and several cost-effectiveness analyses show that its use is justified as it can decrease health care expense for plasma transfusions and improve the already high level of transfusion safety."}
