{"title": "", "body": "Vaccination plays a key role in the modern poultry industry. Without vaccination its productivity would not have progressed so successfully and as rapidly as it has over the last few decades. Th e reason for this is quite simple. Many infectious diseases are ubiquitous worldwide and airborne pathogens are diffi cult to control even with very good biosecurity measures. For the poultry industry the main practical method of controlling infectious diseases is vaccination.\n\nTh e primary reason for vaccinating poultry is to reduce the losses due to morbidity and mortality caused by infectious agents. In addition, layer and breeder birds need protection against diseases causing egg production drops and eggshell deformities.\n\nVaccination of breeders can also reduce vertical transmission of certain pathogens from breeders to progeny, thus preventing early outbreaks of diseases. Vaccinated breeders can pass maternal antibodies to their progeny to protect them against infections during the fi rst weeks of their life. Increasingly, the aim of vaccination will be to prevent dissemination of zoonoses such as salmonellosis.\n\nVaccines can contribute greatly to the welfare of domestic and wild animals as well. However, vaccination can never provide 100% protection against infectious diseases. It is only one but a very important part of a complex preventive policy, of which biosecurity and hygiene are equally essential components.\n\nTh ere are now a large number of vaccines available for poultry. Disease control by vaccination is more eff ective for some diseases than others and programmes and requirements may vary considerably in diff erent parts of the world. Th e diseases for which vaccines are available are: Newcastle disease (ND), infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), fowl pox (FP), infectious avian encephalomyelitis (AE; epidemic tremor), Marek's disease (MD), egg drop syndrome (EDS 76), viral arthritis (reovirus), turkey avian rhinotracheitis (TRT/SHS), infectious bronchitis (IB), infectious bursal disease (IBD), chicken infectious anaemia (CIA), infectious coryza (Haemophilus paragallinarum), fowl cholera (Pasteurella multocida), mycoplasmosis (Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma synoviae), erysipelas (Erysipelothrix insidiosa), salmonellosis (Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Gallinarum), colibacillosis 66 Tibor Cserep\n\n(Escherichia coli), coccidiosis, haemorrhagic enteritis, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale and avian infl uenza.\n\nAt present there are two main types of vaccine available for poultry: live or killed. Vaccines against diff erent diseases are combined in a programme to give protection against a number of viral or bacterial diseases.\n\nKilled vaccines consist of a high dose of inactivated antigens combined with an oil emulsion or aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. Th ey give high and prolonged levels of immunity, especially when used after 'priming' with live vaccine. Th ey must be injected in each individual bird and often antigens of two or more diff erent disease organisms are included in one vaccine (multivalent vaccine).\n\nLive vaccines, on the other hand, usually contain only one antigen and may be administered by spray (aerosol), via drinking water, eye drop or in some cases by injection. Th e antigen may either be the disease organism, which has been deliberately attenuated, i.e. made less virulent by some suitable means (e.g. H120 strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)) or a naturally occurring mild strain of the organism (e.g. B1 strain of Newcastle disease virus (NDV)).\n\nA smaller amount of antigen is required in live vaccines because the organism will multiply rapidly in the target organ(s). Th is organ is the respiratory tract for viruses such as TRT and IB, or the intestine for AE and the bursa of Fabricius for IBD. Live vaccines may stimulate the production of local or mucosal immunity as well as general (systemic) immunity. Multiplication of the vaccine organism in vaccinated birds is important and excretion may be helpful in producing a good fl ock immunity by bird to bird transmission. For example, cycling of vaccine virus is advantageous in achieving good fl ock immunity to IBD, ND and IB. However, cycling is undesirable with TRT or ILT. Lateral spread of vaccine virus can be very undesirable on multiage sites. For example, if AE or IB H52 strain spread into older, unvaccinated groups of birds in lay, the vaccine itself may then cause production problems. Occasionally, birds show a reaction after the administration of live vaccine, for example mild coughing or 'snicking' after NDV vaccination, indicating that the vaccine has 'taken'. Unless concurrent bacterial or mycoplasma challenge is present this mild reaction disappears in a few days time and is not a cause for concern.\n\nVaccination programmes are designed to prevent or reduce losses caused by disease in vaccinated birds and/or their progeny. In devising a vaccination programme, both immunological and commercial factors must be considered, including the following:\n\n\u2022 Th e general health of the fl ock and the local pattern of disease -vaccine must not be administered to sick birds \u2022 Th e genetic type and function of the bird \u2022 Th e cost-benefi t of vaccination against potential loss \u2022 Th e short-or long-term protection required \u2022 Th e vaccinations or diseases that occurred in the previous generation and would infl uence maternal antibody status. Maternal antibody may have a signifi cant eff ect on the design of a vaccination programme. For example, the level of maternal antibody against IBD virus determines the timing of vaccination with diff erent types of IBD vaccines. For TRT, maternal antibody has no eff ect on vaccination. Having decided on the types of vaccine required, the method and frequency of administration must be considered, and how these can be integrated into a vaccination programme.\n\nVaccination programmes are not universal. Th ey have to be designed individually according to the type of birds, production systems and local disease conditions of an area or of a country.\n\nLive vaccines are usually supplied in vials in freeze-dried form. Th ey should be kept at 4-8\u040aC and protected from heat and light. Cell-associated MD vaccine is stored and supplied in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, it is a suspension of living cells containing the MD virus ('wet' vaccine).\n\nMost live vaccines are applied by mass application techniques such as drinking water and spray.\n\nVaccines should be reconstituted in clean, cold water. If the water contains chlorine, skimmed milk powder should be dissolved in it at the rate of 2 g/L or skimmed milk added in the ratio of 2:100. Th e milk powder or milk should be mixed with the water 20-30 min before adding the vaccine to give time for neutralization of any damaging components in the water such as chlorine or metallic ions. Th ere are also various 'water stabilizer' tablets and powders available that neutralize the chlorine in the drinking water and at the same time change the colour of water to light blue or green. It is not recommended that vaccine solution is put into metal storage tanks. It is essential to ensure that the whole drinking water system is clean and does not contain any debris such as rust or dirt and that there are no residues of any sanitizer, which may inactivate the vaccine viruses. Plastic header tanks or bins are therefore preferred as they can be thoroughly cleaned.\n\nTh e vaccine should be used as soon as possible after reconstitution and certainly within 2 h. Th e procedure of administration is critical as uptake of one full dose (protective dose) by the individual bird is essential. Th e most eff ective uptake of vaccine from nipple drinkers can be achieved as follows:\n\n1. Th e day before vaccine is due to be administered, the water meter should be read hourly to determine the pattern of drinking, especially in relation to the timing of the feeders. Th is will give an idea of the best time to vaccinate the birds and also the volume of water required. In the absence of a water meter, the water consumption can be estimated by measuring the water level in the header tanks, or by other methods. (On farms where bell or trough drinkers are used the drinkers should be cleaned but not disinfected.) Water sanitizers should be withdrawn from the drinker system 2 days before vaccine is administered. 2. On the morning of vaccination the main tap to the drinker system should be turned off and the drinker system should be raised and drained. If this is not possible the birds should drink as much water out of the system as possible. It is advisable to remove the fi lters from the water line where vaccine passes through. Slime and dirt building up on fi lters can concentrate residue of sanitizers, which can reduce the effi cacy of the vaccine. When the drinkers are dry they should be raised, preferably 30-60 min prior to feeder activation. Th e vaccine should be mixed in the calculated volume of water, which is treated with milk or alternative neutralizing products if mains water is used, plus the volume of residual water within the lines (the drinker lines in a shed may contain as much as 250 L of water). Once the vaccine is mixed, each drinker line should be drained until the milk or dye-stained water is visible at the end of each line (priming of the lines). Th e vaccine can be made more visible by adding colouring food dye tablets to the mix. 3. When all the lines have been drained and primed, they should be lowered to bird level to coincide with the feeders activating. Preparation of the lines in this way ensures that birds at the far end of the water lines also receive vaccine and not just plain water. 4. Walk along the sides of the shed to stimulate birds to move towards feeders and drinkers. 5. Ensure that the main tap of the water system is reopened when vaccinated water is consumed just before the header tank runs dry. Dosing machines (proportioners) are also used for administering vaccine and are more useful where ad libitum feeding is practised, as the water consumption tends to be constant over time. If timed feeding is practised it is more eff ective to use the method described above to ensure that the majority of birds receive vaccine timed to coincide with maximum water consumption. Proportioners have their advantages and disadvantages but for certain types of poultry sheds they are the only way in which vaccines or medications can be administered. Unfortunately, the recommended concentration of milk necessary to protect the vaccine virus in the water cannot be achieved using proportioners. To achieve the recommended 2% milk concentration in the drinker lines one has to use pure skimmed milk for stock solution. Alternatively, the recommended amount of neutralizing powder or tablets per litre needs to be mixed into the stock solution.\n\n(Where bell or trough type drinkers are used, the freshly prepared vaccine solution should ideally be poured into clean drinkers within a short period of time, ensuring that each bird in the shed has an opportunity to take the protective dose of vaccine.)\n\nTh e appropriate volumes of vaccine-containing water to be used for broilers are given in Table 5 .1.\n\nTh e other method of mass administration of live vaccine involves application by spray or aerosol. An aerosol generally contains mainly particles of less than 5 \u03bcm diameter at bird level (approx. 50 \u03bcm when they leave the sprayer), which can penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract. Th is may initiate a severe vaccine reaction with bacteria such as E. coli, resulting in septicaemia. Th erefore, in certain circumstances a coarser spray with particles greater than 100 \u03bcm diameter when they leave the sprayer is generally preferable to an aerosol and is less likely to cause an adverse reaction. Aerosol vaccination is recommended for vaccinating birds in areas where ND is endemic but only after 'priming' with ND vaccine in the form of coarse spray.\n\nIt is very diffi cult to measure droplet size accurately under fi eld conditions but with watersensitive paper (WSP) a good enough assessment for vaccination purposes can be made. WSP is a rigid paper with a specially coated, yellow surface. Th is surface is stained a dark blue colour when aqueous droplets come into contact with it.\n\nAfter application of a spray, the WSP is retrieved from the target area and, once dry, the droplet pattern can be examined. Th e size of the blue spots refl ects the size of spray droplets landing on the target area. Comparison can be made with known standards or the spots can be assessed manually using a pen microscope ( Fig. 5.1 ).\n\nSuitable sprayers for on-farm use are knapsack sprayers or sprayers based on the spinning disc system ( Fig. 5 .2). Th ere are also specially designed sprayer cabinets for use in hatcheries for the administration of IB, and ND, TRT or coccidiosis vaccines to day-old chicks ( Fig. 5.3 ). Vaccine should be reconstituted in distilled or deionized water, not tap water, as the latter can contain sanitizer (chlorine), dissolved solids and salts, which concentrate rapidly as spray droplets evaporate and this can be harmful to the vaccine virus. Th e volume of water is determined by the age of the birds and type of sprayer. For day-old vaccination 200-400 mL of water per 1000 chicks or poults is generally suffi cient. If knapsack sprayers are used during rearing or lay 500-1000 mL of water per 1000 birds may be required to achieve uniform vaccine cover. Th e volume of water for spinning disc sprayers is much less than this and the manufacturer's recommendations should be followed.\n\nSpray vaccine is generally more eff ective in a controlled environment than in open-sided houses. In closed houses, fans should be turned off with the inlets and outlets closed, the lights should be dimmed and the birds allowed to settle quietly before spraying commences. \n\nOf all the methods of administration of live vaccine, the eye drop or intranasal route is probably the most eff ective, although very time-consuming and labour intensive. Accuracy is important and the vaccine must disappear after a blink (eye drop) or inhalation (intranasal) before the bird is released.\n\nTh is method is extremely eff ective for the administration of TRT vaccine, where it is important that each bird receives a full dose of vaccine. It is also used for ILT vaccine and for ND where this is endemic.\n\nLive vaccines may have to be administered by injection as in the case of MD vaccines (Fig. 5.4) , certain Chicken anaemia virus (CAV) and reovirus vaccines. Th e injection route, either intramuscular or subcutaneous, is the only one used for inactivated (killed) vaccines ( Fig. 5 .5). Automatic syringes are used to a preset dosage. It is important that the equipment is regularly checked to ensure that the dosage is correct and also that the needles are changed regularly (e.g. after each bottle of vaccine or every 500 birds) to minimize the spread of contaminants. A needle sanitizer sleeve containing a biocide-treated sponge can be fi tted on to the syringe to ensure aseptic injections up to 500 times. Injection may be subcutaneous in the back of the neck or, more usually, intramuscular into breast or leg. Th e breast off ers a safer target area than the 'drumstick' of the leg where tendons, nerves or blood vessels can be hit above the hock joint, leading to unnecessary suff ering and lameness. Th e tip of the keel bone gives a very good orientation point for breast vaccination. Ideally the needle should be inserted laterally on either side of the breast, approximately 2-3 cm away from the tip of the keel (Fig. 5.6 ). If the needle is inserted too far from the keel into the fl ank area or at the tail end of the keel bone, vital organs such as heart or liver can be hit and the bird may die.\n\nIn certain countries inactivated vaccines are administered into the muscular part of the tail or subcutaneously into the inguinal fl ap.\n\nAccuracy is important as incorrect needle placement can result in head swelling, granulomata, liver punctures or lameness, depending on the injection site. Th e most frequently used needles for inactivated vaccines are 12.5 mm (half inch) long and 1.1 mm (19 gauge) thick. \n\nVaccination via the wing web is the principal method of administration of fowl pox (FP) vaccine. Epidemic tremor vaccine is compatible and sometimes the two products are combined. It is important to use a two-pronged applicator. Th is provides twice the area inoculated and results in better protection. Care should be taken to avoid the vaccine coming into contact with the bird's eyes or mouth. Th e application site on the wing web should be examined 5-7 days postvaccination to ensure a 'take'. Th is should appear as a slightly raised and swollen area.\n\nTh is method has been used for the distribution of live thermostable ND vaccine to widely dispersed small backyard fl ocks in areas such as India, Ethiopia and south-east Asia. Results have been rather erratic.\n\nTh is system is now being used in a number of countries for the administration of MD and other live vaccines. Fertile chicken eggs are inoculated at 18 days on transfer to the hatchers. It is hoped that this system will ultimately be suitable for administration of a number of live vaccines.\n\nVaccination programmes vary considerably from area to area and country to country, according to the local pattern of disease.\n\nBroilers may be killed at any time between 35 and 80 days of age, so vaccine requirements may vary considerably depending on slaughter age. Th e virulent strain of IBD virus is endemic in many countries now and two doses of intermediate strain vaccine are usually required, given at about 17 and 24 days, depending on levels of maternal antibody. Alternatively, one dose of 'intermediate plus' strain vaccine may be given on farms where there is a history of acute IBD with high mortality. Th is vaccine is given in the drinking water at about 14 days of age but should not be given to birds without maternal antibody. Th e timing of IBD vaccinations with intermediate plus type vaccine can be more accurately determined using the Kouwenhoven or other formula based on measurement of maternal antibodies by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. To get meaningful results at least 20 serum samples from 1-day-old chicks from each breeding fl ock need to be tested. ELISA kit and vaccine manufacturers provide customers with computer software for calculating ideal times for IBD vaccination.\n\nwhere 22.36 \u03ed \u038a350 Index units (the threshold at which vaccination is possible); 2.82 \u03ed halflife of antibody in days; 1 \u03ed birds placed on farm on fi rst day of life.\n\nIB vaccine is required in most countries to control both variant and classical IB. It is usually administered by coarse spray in the hatchery to day-old chicks or on arrival at the farm while the chicks are still in the boxes (Fig. 5.7) and then a second dose of IB vaccine is given at around 20 days by spray or via drinking water. In most countries the vaccine is of Massachusetts serotype, but local conditions may require the use of other serotypes as well, such as Connecticut, Arkansas, Dutch variants or the UK variant IB 4-91.\n\nNDV challenge is still important in many countries too. Th e fi rst vaccination can be given as coarse spray in the hatchery. However, if there is a possibility that day-old chicks are infected with M. gallisepticum or pathogenic E. coli, postvaccinal reaction can occur, particularly if the spray contains fi ne (\u03fd5.0 \u03bcm at bird level) droplets. Th e second dose of ND vaccine can be given via drinking water or fi ne spray around 21 days of age. Severe challenge conditions may demand the use of live ND vaccine (spray or eye drop) and a killed oil emulsion ND vaccine (injection) at 1 day old. Th is combined vaccination usually gives suffi cient protection for the short life of broilers. However, in heavy-challenge areas, particularly on multiage farms, a second spray vaccination at 18 days may be necessary. MD vaccine is given routinely by injection at 1 day old or in ovo to 18-day-old embryos in countries which reuse litter and therefore have a high residual challenge, or where birds are to be kept to 55 days of age or more.\n\nAs a general rule two live vaccines should not be given at the same time but separated ideally by 14 days (minimum 7 days) to avoid the phenomenon of interference.\n\nA vaccination programme for broilers in the UK is given in Table 5 .2.\n\nAll breeders receive MD vaccine at 1 day old. Generally the cell-associated 'wet' vaccine is considered the most eff ective and it may be either attenuated Marek's disease virus (MDV) or Turkey herpes virus (THV) or a combination of both. Rispens (serotype 1) is widely regarded as a very eff ective vaccine but in some countries SB1 (serotype 2) or various combinations of two or three serotypes may be used. Sometimes a second dose of vaccine is given at around 7-14 days of age and is considered an eff ective means of preventing disease in areas of high challenge. Breeding birds are always vaccinated for IB and ND. Live vaccines are administered initially to give protection from disease during the rearing period but also to act as primers for the inactivated vaccine given later. In the UK the fi rst live ND vaccine (B1) is usually given at about 3 weeks and this may be followed by one or more doses of B1, Clone 30, or other strains depending on the local level of challenge. Killed ND vaccine is given around 16-18 weeks of age to provide protection through lay and to give maternal antibody to the progeny. Th e fi rst dose of IB vaccine (H120 or Ma5) is usually given at 3 weeks of age in the UK. Further doses of H120 or Ma5 vaccine may be used every 6-8 weeks during the laying period if IB infection pressure or challenge is high.\n\nTh ere are a number of live variant strains of IB vaccine available in diff erent countries and these may be used if permitted by the authorities. ND, IB, IBvariant, reovirus, TRT and IBD killed vaccines are used in various combinations and are given at between 16 and 18 weeks, normally as one injection. Live and killed TRT vaccines are part of most breeder vaccination programmes and are essential to reduce the impact of challenge by avian pneumovirus, the cause of swollen head syndrome. IBD vaccine is required in areas of high challenge. Usually an intermediate strain is used at around 3-5 weeks of age. Killed IBD vaccine is given at 16-18 weeks to provide even levels of maternal antibody in the progeny chicks. Th is helps to plan the timing of IBD vaccin ation of broilers and layers.\n\nCIA virus live vaccine is now available in many countries and immunization of breeders is very important in preventing the devastating eff ects of this condition in the progeny. A single dose of live vaccine is given after 6 weeks of age.\n\nBreeders all over the world are given a single dose of live infectious avian encephalomyelitis (IAE) vaccine at around 14 weeks in the drinking water. Again this gives protection to the progeny.\n\nIn the UK all broiler breeders have to be vaccinated against S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium. Th is can be done by two doses of the combined SE \u03e9 ST inactivated vaccine or by various regimen of live SE and ST vaccines.\n\nDepending on the conditions in the country FP, fowl cholera, ILT, infectious coryza, avian rhinotracheitis, infl uenza, viral arthritis (reovirus) and EDS vaccines may be required and have to be fi tted into the vaccination programme.\n\nLive coccidiosis vaccines are now available worldwide and used successfully in the prevention of coccidiosis. Some of these vaccines are based on precocious strains of Eimeria species; others contain more virulent strains. Th ey can be applied in the hatchery by spray at 1 day old, during the fi rst week of life via drinking water or sprayed on feed (Fig. 5.8) .\n\nS. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium killed and live vaccines are valuable recent developments and are very eff ective in reducing transmission of these pathogens from breeders to progeny and further on to humans.\n\nReovirus vaccine (live and killed) is used in many countries and appears to reduce the incidence of reovirus-associated infections (malabsorption syndrome, viral arthritis and femoral head necrosis) in breeders and their progeny. Vaccination programmes for breeders in the UK, Asia and South America are given in Tables 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 respectively.\n\nTh e requirements for commercial layers are similar to those for breeders, but there are some diff erences.\n\nYoung egg-laying strains of bird are very susceptible to the virulent forms of IBD infection. Th us up to three doses of intermediate strain vaccine may be given at 14, 21 and 28 days by drinking water. If the level of challenge is very high, a single dose of 'intermediate plus' vaccine has been shown to give protection. Requirements for ND, IB, AE, TRT and MD vaccines are similar to those of breeders. Live respiratory disease vaccines may be sprayed on to birds in cages (Fig. 5.9 ).\n\nLaying birds are usually kept on multiage sites, so the level of biosecurity is not as good as for breeders. Extra attention should be paid to prevent the spread of certain live vaccines to susceptible birds on the same farm. EDS vaccine may be required and is given by injection at 16 weeks of age as a single dose. EDS immunity is unusual in that it requires only one dose of killed vaccine and no live primer is required. Live ILT vaccine is given by eye drop in areas where ILT is endemic. Is some countries live or killed M. gallisepticum and/or M. synoviae vaccines are used, where these diseases have not been eradicated or eradication would be expensive and impractical.\n\nAs with breeders, infectious coryza, fowl cholera and pox vaccines are used in endemic areas. \n\nIn certain European countries, TRT has become endemic and live vaccine is needed as an essential part of the control programme. It can be given by spray or eye drop and is best applied at 1 day old in the hatchery. Sometimes a second dose is given by spray at about 6-10 weeks for birds destined for heavier weights. Fowl cholera vaccine may be required on certain problem farms. Where haemorrhagic enteritis is a problem, in countries such as France, the USA and now in the UK, the impact of the disease can be reduced by a single dose of live vaccine given at 4 weeks of age in drinking water. ND vaccine may be required in endemic areas.\n\nTurkey breeders are normally immunized against ND but this requires more doses of vaccine than for broiler breeders as the turkey seems to be less responsive. Depending on the epidemiological situation at least three doses of live vaccine may be required. Th e spray method gives a better response than the drinking water route. La Sota or Clone 30 can be used as a primer in turkeys and their 'take' is better than B1. At least two doses of killed vaccine are required. Th e most diffi cult problem for immunization is fowl cholera, caused by P. multocida. Two doses of killed vaccine are normally given 4 weeks apart during the rearing period, usually between 10 and 24 weeks. In areas of very high challenge it may be necessary to start immunization as early as 8 weeks, with two initial doses of vaccine given 4 weeks apart followed by a third before lay and even a fourth during lay. Two priming doses of live vaccine given orally are used in some countries (e.g. USA) but live cholera vaccines are not licensed in the UK. Pox vaccination is often required for turkeys in hotter climates (e.g. California and Australia). Two doses are given by wing web stab; the timing will depend on when challenge is likely to occur. Vaccines for rhinotracheitis are now available in the USA, where this condition is caused by Bordetella avium, while in Europe TRT, which is a clinically similar disease, is caused by avian pneumovirus. To protect against TRT infection, breeders require live priming vaccine given by spray at 1 day old and about 6 weeks, followed by killed vaccine given at 14 and 22 weeks. Th e current live TRT vaccines seem to be capable of giving cross-protection against the new 'type C' pneumovirus isolated recently from turkey fl ocks in the USA.\n\nParamyxovirus (PMV-3) vaccine is often used to prevent drops in egg production due to this infection. Table 5 .6 gives a vaccination programme for turkey breeders in the UK.\n\nFor breeders and commercial birds, duck virus hepatitis (DVH) vaccine and duck viral enteritis (DVE) are needed. In some countries they are also vaccinated against fowl cholera (Tables 5.7 and 5.8).\n\nTh e DVH vaccine referred to here is for DVH type 1. Th ere may be a requirement in some areas for DVH type 2 vaccine.\n\nQuail, pheasants and partridges may need ND vaccine in areas of risk. If so, a similar programme to that given for broiler breeders may be followed. Pheasants can carry viruses such as IB and TRT, which are present in chickens or turkeys too. Challenge with these viruses can sometimes result in pheasant mortality as a result of so-called coronavirus-nephritis or respiratory disease similar to swollen head syndrome of chickens. Vaccination of pheasant fl ocks against these diseases has proved to be successful in certain game units in the UK and might be necessary in the future. \n\nMolecular biology has now developed to the extent that techniques are available that make it possible to insert into a vector (either a nonpathogenic virus or bacterium) those genes from a pathogenic organism that are known to be important in conferring protection. Following inocu lation into an animal, the vector will replicate and, in so doing, the inserted gene is also replicated and its product is expressed, which can then stimulate an immune response to the insert in addition to the vector. Th eoretically, this opens up the possibility of a new generation of vaccines, often called recombinant DNA vaccines, in which the advantage of the safety of killed vaccines is combined with the effi cacy of live ones. Th e choice of suitable vectors is important. Th ey must be capable of being given by mass application methods and frequently must replicate in the face of maternally derived immunity. Two existing poultry vaccines, herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) and fowl pox virus (FPV), are suitable for use as vectors and experimental studies have shown that, for example, the F gene of either NDV or TRT virus can be inserted into these vectors and be expressed in the birds following inoculation of the vector and also confer protection against experimental challenge with pathogenic NDV or TRT virus respectively. Th us, the system has potential for commercial use and it is certainly attractive that protection against both the vector (HVT or FPV) and the inserted genes can be achieved in a single vaccination. However, it is still unclear whether these vaccines will have any significant advantages over existing conventional ones in, for example, the type or duration of immunity which they confer. One recombinant DNA vaccine (FPV containing the protective genes of NDV) has recently been licensed for use in poultry in the USA so the performance of such a vaccine can now be assessed under fi eld conditions."}
