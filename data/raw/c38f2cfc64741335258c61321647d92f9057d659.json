{"title": "Asthma", "body": "irritants, exercise, cold air, or a combination of these factors. An asthma exacerbation involves either a slow onset of symptoms or a rapid decline in respiratory status. Persistent or acute allergen or irritant exposure promotes inflammation, bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperresponsiveness on an ongoing basis. Allergen exposure triggers a biphasic response. The \"early response\" occurs within minutes of allergen exposure and results in rhinorrhea, sneezing, itching of the eyes and nose, and bronchospasm secondary to release of histamine and other preformed mediators of inflammation. The \"late-phase response\" peaks 6 to 8 hours after allergen exposure with the development of eosinophilic inflammation and T-cell infiltration of the airway. During an exacerbation of asthma as a result of allergen exposure, both phases must be treated with medications to treat the symptoms of the early phase, as well as the subsequent inflammation of the late phase. 9 Viral infections cause asthma symptoms by promoting eosinophilic or neutrophilic airway inflammation. 4 Viralinduced asthma exacerbations are common in children, and in fact a majority of acute asthma admissions are associated with viral infections in children and adults. 10, 11 The risk for exacerbation of asthma can be modified by a patient's underlying inflammatory state and level of airway hyperreactivity. A patient with reduced airway inflammation because of adequate controller therapy is less likely to have a severe asthma flare when exposed to offending agents.\n\nThe presentation of acute asthma may vary, but all patients experience worsening airflow obstruction associated with respiratory distress. Patients often complain of shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing. Some patients describe chest pain, cough, or fatigue. Caregivers may report observations of breathlessness, trouble speaking, decreased activity, retractions, rapid breathing, wheezing noises, or relentless cough. 12 On physical examination, tachypnea is present, often accompanied by tachycardia. Pulse oximetry may reveal decreased oxygen saturation. There is evidence of increased respiratory effort, such as intercostal, supraclavicular, or subcostal retractions. Infants and young children may demonstrate nasal flaring or head bobbing. Paradoxical motion of the thoracoabdominal wall (i.e., expansion of abdominal girth with inspiration) is another useful sign of increased work of breathing. Auscultation of the chest frequently reveals wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase. Rales or crackles are often heard and may shift in location over a period of minutes to hours (\"migratory atelectasis\"). Assessment of air movement is determined by the loudness of breath sounds in various areas of the chest and may also vary over time. Patients with poor air movement may have minimal wheezing because the passage of air through the airway is what generates wheezing sounds. As air exchange improves, wheezing may become more pronounced. Conversely, patients with a deteriorating clinical course may have diminishing wheezing indicative of worsening air movement and perhaps respiratory insufficiency. Agitation and somnolence are worrisome signs and may indicate hypoxemia or hypercapnia with impending respiratory failure.\n\nSome patients present without significant wheezing but with prominent cough as their manifestation of asthma, often referred to as \"cough-variant\" asthma. It is believed that the pathophysiology and response to treatment are similar to that for classic asthma.\n\nMany conditions result in acute or chronic respiratory symptoms that mimic an asthma syndrome. Some of these conditions are discussed in the following text.\n\nAnatomic abnormalities should be considered in young children with frequent episodes of cough or wheezing. Inhaled foreign bodies are most common in toddler-aged children (Chapter 79). These problems may manifest as cough, stridor, or wheezing. In all age groups, gastroesophageal reflux can mimic or contribute to underlying asthma (Chapter 101). 13, 14 Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that can also present with chronic cough or recurrent episodes of wheezing (Chapter 78).\n\nViral infections often cause wheezing in childhood as well. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of infantile bronchiolitis, but other respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and influenza viruses are also common infectious agents. 15 Viral bronchiolitis is associated with edema, bronchospasm, and increased mucus production of the smaller airways, features that overlap with asthma (Chapter 66). Because these respiratory viral infections are known to precipitate asthma exacerbations, it may be difficult to determine whether the wheezing represents an isolated episode of bronchiolitis or an asthma exacerbation triggered by the respiratory virus.\n\nAtypical respiratory infections with agents such as Mycoplasma, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis or parapertussis can present with chronic cough. Coughing associated with these infections can persist for several months.\n\nFunctional disorders can coexist with or mimic asthma and include vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) and psychogenic cough. VCD usually presents in adolescence with upper airway (laryngeal) inspiratory or expiratory stridor, or both, which may be difficult to distinguish from lower airway wheezing. The diagnosis of VCD is confirmed by laryngoscopy demonstrating paradoxical adduction of the vocal cords during inspiration. [16] [17] [18] [19] Psychogenic cough is a habitual cough that can also persist for months, and it often occurs after an acute respiratory illness. 20 Habitual cough has a characteristic sound described as barky or honking. The cough is exaggerated by stress or attention to the cough and disappears with sleep. 20 These features help distinguish this entity from cough-variant asthma. A key feature of VCD and psychogenic cough is lack of response to asthma therapy. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] In addition, they are not associated with hypoxia.\n\nThe initial evaluation of a patient presenting with an asthma exacerbation should include assessment of the acute respiratory symptoms, signs or symptoms of coexisting or precipitating conditions, and treatments initiated before presentation. A history should be obtained of the characteristics of the patient's asthma symptoms, the pattern and frequency of the symptoms, and any precipitating or aggravating factors, as well as features indicative of the severity and level of control of the asthma (Tables 75-1 and  75 -2). 4 The physical examination provides clues to the severity of the current illness, as well as the presence of comorbid conditions. Important physical parameters include the respiratory rate, work of breathing, air entry, wheezing, and oxygen saturation. Work of breathing refers to the use of accessory muscles of respiration and involves nasal flaring, abdominal retractions, and depth of respiration.\n\nDuring an exacerbation of asthma, physical findings may vary and evolve with treatment or progression of the acute condition. A quiet or silent chest is a worrisome sign because \n\nHow often do they have flares of their asthma? How many times in the last year? How many times have they used oral steroids? How many times in the last year? How many emergency room visits? How many visits to the hospital? Have they ever been in the intensive care unit? poor movement of air can be associated with respiratory insufficiency or failure. Asymmetry of auscultatory findings may indicate other conditions. Unequal breath sounds can be found with pneumonia, pleural effusion (especially in dependent regions of the lung), or atelectasis. Unilateral breath sounds may indicate an aspirated foreign body or pneumothorax on the side with diminished breath sounds 4 and may be accompanied by hyperresonance on that side, especially if significant air trapping is present. Chest radiographs are not typically needed for patients with known asthma and a straightforward asthma exacerbation. 21 Typical radiographic findings include hyperinflation, peribronchial thickening, and atelectasis ( Fig. 75-1) . Chest radiographs may be helpful when there is concern for pneumonia, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or foreign body aspiration.\n\nA classification system for determining the severity of an asthma exacerbation in children 5 years of age or older is provided in Table 75 -3. Patients in mild distress typically have slightly increased respiratory rates, may not use accessory muscles of respiration, and have end-expiratory wheezes with good air entry. Patients in severe distress are working hard to breathe, with inspiratory and expiratory wheezing, and are often hypoxic. Signs of impending respiratory failure are provided in Table 75 -4. For infants and children younger than 5 years of age, clues to breathlessness include difficulty or reluctance to feed and changes in crying pattern (e.g., softer or shorter). Changes in vital signs in these younger patients must be interpreted in the context of normal values for the age range. Interestingly, paradoxical thoracoabdominal movement, a sign associated with severe respiratory distress in older children, may be seen in young children and infants, even in states of mild or moderate respiratory distress.\n\nObjective measures for evaluation of acute asthma include pulmonary function testing, pulse oximetry, and arterial blood gases. Patients with exacerbations of asthma are at risk for hypoxemia. As a result, patients require frequent monitoring to ensure adequate oxygenation. Continuous pulse oximetry is recommended during a severe exacerbation, whereas intermittent oximetry may be acceptable as the clinical course improves.\n\nArterial blood gas parameters are typically obtained in critically ill patients and those with clinical deterioration or signs of respiratory insufficiency or failure. Arterial blood gases may reveal hypoxemia from ventilation-perfusion mismatch and respiratory alkalosis with hypocapnia secondary to hyperventilation. A normal or elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Paco 2 ) may be the harbinger of respiratory failure 22 and may be associated with decreased blood pH because of respiratory acidosis.\n\nPulmonary function tests can be used to assess lung function even during an asthma exacerbation. Spirometric indices such as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) or the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) are most useful to assess the severity of asthma. However, because spirometry is often not readily available in the acute care setting, PEFR can be used instead. The hand-held peak flowmeter measures PEFR, and normal values have been established according to age, gender, and height 23 (Table 75-5) . PEFR provides a measure of large-airway flow by measuring the rate of airflow in liters per minute. As a flare or asthma exacerba- tion worsens, PEFR typically becomes lower than baseline and may reflect the severity of the exacerbation. In patients presenting to an emergency room with an asthma exacerbation, FEV 1 is typically 30% to 35% of normal 24 and PEFR is less than 50% of normal. Monitoring PEFR can also assist in tapering medication during the recovery phase of an acute hospitalization. PEFR is effort and technique dependent, and therefore reliability remains a concern. It should be used in conjunction with other parameters of severity for assessment of patients (see Chapter 80) .\n\nExacerbations of asthma are treated with a combination of supportive therapy and pharmacologic interventions. Treatment is tailored to the severity of symptoms and adjusted according to the patient's response to therapy. Adequate hydration should be established and maintained either orally or with intravenous fluids. Physiologic monitoring should include vital signs and pulse oximetry. Oxygen supplementation is provided to maintain oxygen saturation in a safe range. This range is widely debated, but most agree that levels greater than 91% are needed, and many target levels to greater than 93% to 95%.\n\nThis class of medications works by stimulating the \u03b2 2adrenergic receptor and causing activation of adenyl cyclase, which increases the production of cyclic 3\u2032,5-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This increase in cAMP, depending on the site of stimulation, results in relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, stimulation of skeletal and cardiac muscle, and inhibition of the release of inflammatory mediators through stabilization of the mast cell membrane. Albuterol is one of the short-acting \u03b2 2 -adrenergic agents used as firstline therapy for an acute asthma exacerbation because of its ability to rapidly open the airways. Albuterol can be administered by nebulizer, either continuously or intermittently, or by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer device. Studies have compared the amount of medication delivered to the lungs when given by MDI with spacer versus nebulizer. [25] [26] [27] The two modes are considered equivalent if the patient can use proper technique with the MDI-spacer method of delivery. Dosing information is provided in Table 75-6. Paradoxical and transient worsening of hypoxia because of increased ventilation-perfusion mismatching can be seen with the administration of albuterol. The medication causes increased cardiac output, which leads to increased perfusion of unventilated lung. 28 Other side effects include sinus tachycardia, tremor, palpitations, headache, agitation, and ventricular irritability (e.g., ventricular premature contractions, ventricular tachycardia). In addition, because frequent or continuous dosing with adrenergic agents can lead to hypokalemia, patients receiving such treatment should have serum potassium levels checked periodically. Nonselective adrenergic agents (e.g., epinephrine) can also cause transient hyperglycemia and elevations in the neutrophil count as a result of demargination.\n\nAlbuterol is actually a racemic mixture of R-albuterol and S-albuterol, with a 50:50 ratio of these two stereoisomers. Levalbuterol (Xopenex) is made up of the R-isomer, which is thought to be the active component of the racemic product. However, S-albuterol has been found to have some bronchoconstrictive activity in select studies, but not in others, and demonstrates activation of eosinophils in vitro. In addition, S-albuterol is cleared much less rapidly, which can cause buildup of this isomer in vivo as opposed to the L-isomer. However, the vast majority of clinical studies and in vitro pharmacology data have shown no significant differences in cardiopulmonary side effects and tremor when comparing racemic with R-isomer albuterol. [29] [30] [31] One study found decreased rates of admission from an emergency department with the use of levalbuterol versus racemic albuterol. 32 Another study showed improved bronchodilation, 33 but these findings have not been confirmed in other studies. 29, 30, 34 Terbutaline, a selective \u03b2 2 -adrenergic agonist, and epinephrine, a nonselective adrenergic agonist, are used in asthmatics not responding to albuterol and corticosteroids or those who are deteriorating. These medications are given by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. Bronchodilation is seen within 5 minutes of administration and can persist for 3 to 4 hours. 35, 36 Terbutaline can also be given via continuous intravenous infusion by starting with a bolus and titrating the dose to the desired effect.\n\nDosing of \u03b2 2 -adrenergic agonists and other bronchodilators is shown in Tables 75-6 and 75-7.\n\nCorticosteroids are indicated for the initial treatment of status asthmaticus. They are potent anti-inflammatory medications that have been shown to hasten recovery, prevent recurrence, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] and prevent hospitalizations. 42 Because of their mechanism of action, the effect of corticosteroids is not immediate. Steroids bind to the intracytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor and translocate to the nucleus, where they effect RNA transcription in both positive and negative fashion through the transcription factors NF-\u03baB and AP-1. In general, steroids lead to down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. Corticosteroids also activate histone deacetylase, which inhibits DNA transcription. 43 This change in transcription leads to increased expression of the \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptor and decreases in airway inflammation and mucus secretion. It can take several hours to reverse airway inflammation, and benefits are typically seen within 4 hours after the administration of corticosteroids. 38, 39, 44 Studies comparing oral and intravenous corticosteroids have found no sig-nificant differences in efficacy. 45, 46 Oral steroids are typically preferred because intravenous access is not required. 45, 47 Suggested dosing of corticosteroids is provided in Table 75 -8.\n\nAnticholinergic agents work by competitively inhibiting acetylcholine at the muscarinic junction to relieve the cholinergic-mediated bronchoconstriction. Nebulized atropine is associated with significant systemic absorption, but anticholinergic medications such as ipratropium bromide have fewer side effects and less systemic absorption. 48 The use of inhaled ipratropium in the initial phase of treatment has been shown to be effective in reducing the need for hospitalization. A few studies have found no benefit in comparison to \u03b2 2 -agonists alone, whereas others have shown a slight advantage of one to three doses in the initial phase of an acute asthma exacerbation. 49 The role of ipratropium in hospitalized patients is less clear, but an initial study did not show clinical benefit. 50 Combined administration of anticholinergic and \u03b2 2agonist medications increases bronchodilation, although some controversy about this effect persists. 49, 50 Nonetheless, many institutions use a combination of \u03b2 2 -agonists and anticholinergic medications during the initial phase of acute asthma exacerbations. Studies examining the use of anticholinergic medications as monotherapy have also been controversial. Dosing is listed in Table 75-6.\n\nIf initiation of the aforementioned standard therapies does not improve the level of respiratory distress or if symptoms progress, additional interventions may be necessary. The clinical experience and expertise available at the particular institution should be considered in such decisions. Safe transfer to a facility able to provide critical care management should be anticipated, and arrangements should be expedited.\n\nMagnesium sulfate has been studied as a bronchodilator in severe asthma, with conflicting results. [51] [52] [53] [54] Magnesium is thought to inhibit mast cell degranulation and increase bronchial dilation because of a decrease in calcium uptake by bronchial smooth muscle. 55 Its use is considered when a patient fails to improve or worsens despite treatment with continuous inhaled \u03b2 2 -agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and inhaled anticholinergic agents.\n\nIntravenous methylxanthines, such as aminophylline, were commonly used in the past to manage asthma exacerbations because of their ability to act directly on \u03b2-adrenergic receptors and relax bronchial smooth muscle. Concern regarding the toxicity and efficacy of this class of medication and the availability of newer agents have limited its use. Methylxanthines may help prevent acute airway hyperresponsiveness but do not appear to produce these effects chronically. [56] [57] [58] However, life-threatening events such as cardiac arrhythmia and seizures are associated with toxic levels of theophylline (>30 \u00b5g/mL). As a result, methylxanthines are recommended only as adjunctive therapy with close monitoring of serum concentrations and cardiac monitoring.\n\nStudies examining the use of intravenous methylxanthines in children and adults with severe asthma have shown mixed benefit. [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] A recent Cochrane review found that theophylline in addition to \u03b2 2 -agonists and glucocorticoids (with or without anticholinergics) improves lung function within 6 hours of treatment. However, there is no apparent reduction in symptoms, number of nebulized treatments, and length of hospital stay. 65 Aminophylline requires a loading dose followed by a continuous infusion to reach and maintain a therapeutic level (see Table 75 -9). Dosing is titrated according to serum level, clinical efficacy, and side effects.\n\nHeliox is a mixture of helium and oxygen used for inhalation. This agent is thought to improve airflow by creating gas with similar viscosity to air but with lower density, which in turn can increase ventilation and decrease work of breathing. [66] [67] [68] Heliox is indicated in patients with a refractory exacerbation of asthma in whom respiratory failure is impending. Patients with high oxygen requirements may not be able to tolerate heliox because they need a higher Fio 2 than a helium-oxygen mixture can provide. Heliox can also lower body temperature because of the high thermal conductivity of the mixture. Therefore, patients need to have their temperature monitored closely.\n\nDosing of nonstandard therapies is shown in Table  75 -9, and adverse effects of medication are listed in Table  75 -10.\n\nThe initial therapy for status asthmaticus has been outlined by the NHLBI guidelines ( Fig. 75-2) . In brief, patients are first treated with inhaled \u03b2 2 -adrenergic agonists (e.g., inhaled albuterol), corticosteroids either orally or intravenously, and if needed, oxygen. Inhaled anticholinergics, such as ipratropium bromide, may be added for patients who do not demonstrate prompt improvement. Patients with significant improvement after these initial interventions may not require hospitalization.\n\nHospitalization is recommended for patients who continue to have moderately severe or severe symptoms after initial intervention. Treatment with inhaled albuterol (either every 1 to 2 hours by nebulizer or MDI with spacer or delivered continuously by nebulizer) and corticosteroid therapy (orally or, if not tolerated, intravenously) should be continued. Continuation of inhaled anticholinergic agents may be considered, although their benefit remains unproven.\n\nIf patients continue to deteriorate, they must be monitored for respiratory insufficiency and failure. An arterial blood gas measurement can be used to confirm the condition and should reveal decreased pH, elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Paco 2 ), and an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient. Pulse oximetry remains a poor monitoring device for early detection of respiratory failure. Oxygen saturation is initially maintained despite a significant degree of hypoventilation, and the addition of supplemental oxygen would further obscure evidence of respiratory failure from this device (Chapter 66). Patients with impending respiratory failure often need mechanical ventilatory support.\n\nAfter patients are stabilized and demonstrate improvement, therapies can be gradually reduced and withdrawn. Ongoing assessment of clinical parameters is performed, including the respiratory rate, work of breathing, auscultatory findings, and requirement for supplemental oxygen. If the patient remains comfortable with minimal signs of respiratory distress, the dosing of inhaled \u03b2 2 -agonists is decreased. For patients receiving continuous inhaled \u03b2 2agonist therapy, the dose may be reduced and then subsequently transitioned to intermittent treatments, usually every 2 hours. As the patient continues to improve, the interval between treatments can be extended. Similarly, the amount of supplemental oxygen is titrated to maintain oxygen saturation above the desired level and eventually discontinued. Systemic corticosteroids are continued throughout the exacerbation and maintained for several days after discharge from the hospital. If inhaled anticholinergic agents have been instituted, they are usually discontinued when albuterol begins to be tapered.\n\nMany hospitals use clinical pathways, which are tools that detail a sequence of assessments and treatments for patients with various conditions. 69 Studies have shown that asthma clinical pathways shorten hospitalization and decrease the need for readmission for up to 2 weeks after discharge. 70, 71 An asthma clinical pathway allows multiple caregivers, including nurses, respiratory therapists, and doctors, to modify treatment based on structured assessments. The NHLBI guidelines (see Fig. 75 -2) outline specific criteria that can be used to determine a patient's severity and frequency of therapy. It also provides criteria to assist in weaning treatments.\n\nPEFR measurements may be useful to determine readiness for reduction in medication. If PEFR is at least 70% of baseline before a bronchodilator treatment (see Table 75 -5), it is appropriate to space the frequency of the \u03b2 2 -adrenergic agonist treatments. Technique and effort will affect measurement of PEFR; therefore, it should be used in conjunction with other clinical indicators of improvement.\n\nPatients should be sent home on a regimen of oral corticosteroids, the duration of which depends on the length and severity of illness and the patient's frequency of exacerbations. In general, an isolated exacerbation is treated with oral corticosteroids for 5 days. However, if a patient was admitted to the hospital for an extended period, a prolonged course of corticosteroids will be required, followed by taper-ing doses. A taper is prescribed to prevent relapse of symptoms, as well as to prevent an addisonian crisis from adrenal suppression. The risk for an addisonian crisis is hypothetical and has not been demonstrated in any study. [72] [73] [74] In addition, patients receiving their second course of steroids in a month should undergo prolonged tapering as well. A typical taper involves keeping the patient at a full daily dose of corticosteroids until stable clinical status is achieved and then decreasing the dose by 30% to 50% daily. Patients who required admission to the hospital may not have been on an adequate treatment plan. Thus, hospitalization offers an opportunity to assess the overall treatment regimen. Patients should be evaluated according to the NHLBI guidelines shown in Table 75 \n\nOutpatient referral to an asthma specialist (e.g., pulmonologist, allergist) is associated with reduced rates of emergency department visits 75 \u2022 Life-threatening asthma requiring admission to intensive care or a step-down unit \u2022 Severe persistent asthma in a patient who has required a prolonged course of steroids or multiple courses of corticosteroids in 1 year \u2022 Not meeting the goals of asthma therapy or not responding to treatment so that additional testing can be performed if necessary Asthma specialists may be available to assist in the management of an acute asthma exacerbation as needed. Involving the specialist during a hospitalization may assist in transition after discharge. Critical care physicians should be contacted for all patients who may need management in an intensive care setting.\n\nAdmission to the hospital is individualized and based on many factors. Hospitalization should be considered in patients with the following: \n\nPatients are ready to go home when they have been successfully weaned to albuterol treatments every 4 to 6 hours. Before receiving a treatment, they should be able to breathe comfortably during ambulation or speaking. Wheezing may persist on examination, but it should not be audible without a stethoscope. A plan of care should include ongoing management of the current acute exacerbation and transition to maintenance therapy. Additionally, patients should leave with a plan of action for management of subsequent asthma exacerbations. Efforts should be coordinated with the primary care clinician and, if involved, the asthma specialist.\n\nBefore discharge, it is important to consider the environment to which the patient will return. Preventive management plans should be reviewed with the family, including identification of any potential comorbid conditions and triggers present in the environment. Table 75 -15 highlights a discharge checklist that was created by the NHLBI panel.\n\nEducating the family about the pathogenesis of asthma, triggers, and medications is crucial for preventing exacerbations and admissions to the hospital. A patient who requires frequent admissions needs to have the treatment plan reassessed and be evaluated for comorbid conditions. Assessment of adherence to therapy and review of relevant drug delivery systems are important as well. For children experiencing symptoms on a daily basis, there are certain controllable environmental factors, such as exposure to allergens assessing for infection Note \u2022 The stepwise approach is intended to assist, not replace, the clinical decisionmaking required to meet individual patient needs. \u2022 Classify severity: assign patient to most severe step in which any feature occurs. \u2022 There are very few studies on asthma therapy for infants.\n\n\u2022 Gain control as quickly as possible (a course of short systemic corticosteroids may be required); then step down to the least medication necessary to maintain control. \u2022 Minimize use of short-acting inhaled beta 2 -agonists.

[81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] As a result, no smoking should be permitted around asthmatics or in their home or family car. Physicians should provide assistance for caregivers to quit smoking. Appropriate preventive medications based on daily symptoms and frequency of exacerbations should be maintained on a daily basis. These medications are essential for the prevention of asthma flares. Multiple studies have shown a strong negative correlation between hospital admission for asthma and the use of daily inhaled corticosteroids. Suggested doses and regimens have been established through national and worldwide collaboration between primary physicians, allergists, pulmonologists, and others. An example is seen in Tables 75-12 through 75-14. Peak flowmeters can be helpful in managing asthma, if used appropriately. 89 However, studies comparing peak flow monitoring with symptom recognition show no benefit of peak flow-based action plans over those based on symptoms alone. [89] [90] [91] Peak flowmeters have numeric indicators that allow the creation of green, yellow, and red zones (see Table  75 -5). Green represents the \"good\" or \"all clear\" zone and is 80% to 100% of a child's personal best. The yellow zone is 50% to 80% of the personal best and indicates a time when the family should be \"cautious\" because the child may be having or is at risk for asthma symptoms. Asthma reliever medications should be started and contact with the physician considered. The red zone is indicated by a PEFR less than 50% of normal; it is cause for concern and requires a visit to the emergency room or a call to the doctor. 4 Peak flow monitoring is typically helpful for children who are not good at recognizing symptoms of asthma. Current NHLBI guidelines recommend either a symptom-based or peak flow-based management plan.\n\nAdditional sources of support for families can include the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America and Mothers of Asthmatics.\n\n\u2022 Asthma is a chronic disorder that results in airway inflammation and smooth muscle dysfunction and is manifested as recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, and chest tightness.\n\n\u2022 Exacerbations can be triggered by a variety of stimuli, including respiratory infections, exposure to allergens or irritants, exercise, and cold air.\n\n\u2022 Treatment of flares must be directed at decreasing airway inflammation and relieving bronchospasm while providing supportive care.\n\n\u2022 The mainstay of pharmacologic therapy includes inhaled short-acting \u03b2 2 -adrenergic agonist therapy and systemic corticosteroids. Supportive care includes supplemental oxygen if needed and maintenance of hydration.\n\n\u2022 Many of the pharmacologic agents have significant side effects, and therefore appropriate monitoring is required.\n\n\u2022 Patients with severe symptoms or those with moderately severe symptoms that fail to improve after initial therapy are candidates for admission to an intensive care setting.\n\n\u2022 At the time of discharge, patients should have a clear plan for ongoing treatment of the acute exacerbation and transition to maintenance therapy. In addition, an action plan for subsequent exacerbations should be in place.\n\n\u2022 Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects many Americans, and researchers are actively investigating new drugs and therapies to improve the quality of life of asthmatics. Drugs that modify the immune response are currently under active investigation. An example of one of these drugs is omalizumab, a recombinant humanized anti-IgE antibody. This drug binds circulating free IgE and consequently reduces the level of free IgE in the bloodstream and prevents it from binding to mast cell membrane receptors, thus curtailing the early and late asthmatic responses. Omalizumab has been found to reduce symptoms, exacerbations, 92 and the use of corticosteroids. "}
