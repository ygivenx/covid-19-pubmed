{"title": "The multifaceted biology of plasmacytoid dendritic cells", "body": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were originally described in human lymph nodes in the 1950s 1 . These cells were later found to secrete high amounts of type I interferon (IFN; i.e. IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2) in response to viruses 2, 3 , thereby corresponding to the enigmatic natural IFNproducing cells identified in human peripheral blood 4, 5 . pDCs specialize in producing type I IFNs following their recognition of viruses or self nucleic acids through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR9 [6] [7] [8] . However, pDCs can also secrete other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-12, CXC-chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), CXCL10, CC-chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) and CCL4. Moreover, expression of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules enables pDCs to present antigens to CD4 + T cells. Thus, the biology of pDCs is multifaceted (Figure 1 ).\n\nThe identification of pDCs in mice in 2001 [9] [10] [11] has bolstered research in the pDC field, permitting exploration of the mechanisms involved in their development and their roles in innate and adaptive immunity. In addition to contributing to innate antiviral immunity, pDCs can participate in the priming of both immunogenic or tolerogenic adaptive immune responses. Human pDCs also continue to be extensively studied with a view to understanding their potential roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, cancer and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In this Review, we discuss the recent progress that has been made in these areas of mouse and human pDC biology. We begin by discussing the phenotype of pDCs and the mechanisms that control their development.\n\nHuman pDCs lack expression of the lineage-associated markers CD3, CD19, CD14, CD16 and CD11c and selectively express the C-type lectin BDCA2 (also known as CLEC4C), and the Ig-superfamily receptor ILT7 12 . Human pDCs also express CD4, CD68, ILT3 and the receptor for IL-3 (also known as CD123). Accordingly, IL-3 mediates human pDC survival in vitro 3 . CD2 is a cell adhesion molecule that is expressed by a subset of human pDCs 13 . CD2 hi pDCs produce lysozyme, but whether this endows them with the capacity to lyse bacteria is unknown. The markers most commonly used to identify pDCs in mice are CD11c, B220, Ly6C, bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2) and SIGLEC-H. In contrast to human pDCs, which are CD11c \u2212 , mouse pDCs express intermediate levels of CD11c . BST2 (also known as Tetherin 14 ) is fairly specific to pDCs and plasma cells in steady-state conditions but is induced on many cell types following exposure to type I and type II IFNs 15 . In cell suspensions from primary and secondary lymphoid organs, SIGLEC-H expression is mainly confined to pDCs 16, 17 and is downregulated upon activation 18 . However, specialized macrophage subsets in the spleen, lymph nodes and brain also express SIGLEC-H 17, 19 . In addition, studies in reporter mice have confirmed Siglech mRNA transcription in progenitor cells 18, 20, 21 . Mouse pDCs can also express CD8\u03b1 and, like human pDCs, CD4. In peripheral tissues, the majority of mouse pDCs express CC chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9), Ly49Q and SCA1; however, in the bone marrow these markers distinguish pDC subsets that differ in developmental stage and/or activation state (Box 1).\n\nWhile CCR9, SCA1 and Ly49Q are expressed on the majority of mouse pDCs in the periphery, in the bone marrow these markers have unequal distribution, identifying pDC subsets that differ in their degree of maturation and their capacity to produce IFN-I or pro-inflammatory cytokines. CCR9 \u2212 cells are pDC-like common DC precursors, whereas CCR9 + cells are fully differentiated pDCs. CCR9 \u2212 pDC-like common DC precursors can respond to TLR stimulation and produce type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines better than mature CCR9 + pDCs 29 . While CCR9 \u2212 pDC-like common DC precursors are SCA1 lo , CCR9 + pDCs in the bone marrow can be further divided into SCA1 lo and SCA1 hi subsets. SCA1 lo pDCs are more efficient at producing IFN-\u03b1 than SCA1 hi pDCs and give rise to SCA1 hi pDCs after activation or exposure to type I IFN 217 . Ly49Q \u2212 and Ly49Q + pDCs secrete type I IFN in response to the synthetic TLR9 ligand CpG or herpes simplex virus (HSV), a DNA virus, but Ly49Q \u2212 pDCs respond poorly to stimulation with influenza virus, a RNA virus. Ly49Q \u2212 pDCs also appear to produce lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after TLR stimulation compared to Ly49Q + pDCs 218 . Two pDC subsets have been defined by CD9 expression 219 . The CD9 + subset has high type I IFN producing and T cell stimulatory capacities and may partially overlap with the nonplasmacytoid, high type I IFN producing DC subset described in the bone marrow 220 and CCR9 \u2212 pDC-like common DC precursors.\n\nIn general, studies on bone marrow pDC subsets concur that newly generated pDCs or their close precursors may be more efficient at producing type I IFN than mature pDCs in the bone marrow and in the periphery, at least in response to TLR agonists. However, it has also been reported that pDCs in the periphery and not in the bone marrow are the major source of type I IFN in mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) 221 . Most likely, the relative importance of bone marrow versus peripheral pDCs as sources of type I IFN depends not only on their intrinsic capacity but also on the degree of exposure to viruses or other stimuli that elicit a type I IFN response.\n\nIn conclusion, pDC subsets in bone marrow reflect different stages of development and/or activation and differ in their capacity to produce type I IFN versus proinflammatory cytokines as well as their impact on T cell activation and T cell effector or regulatory functions. Clonogenic assays and consistency among gating strategies and markers used to define pDCs will be essential to determine which populations contain mature pDCs versus those that are heterogeneous and can give rise to different subsets.\n\nsubsequently can differentiate into both Rag1-positive and Rag1-negative mature pDCs. pDCs of lymphoid origin may be distinct from pDCs of myeloid origin, but it has been reported that both myeloid-and lymphoid-derived pDCs can activate lymphoid-specific genetic programs 31 such as nonproductive rearrangements of immunoglogulin or TCR genes and expression of pre-T cell receptor alpha 32-34 . FLT3 and its ligand (FLT3L) are crucial for pDC development 35 . In the absence of FLT3 signaling, pDCs are reduced in number in the lymphoid organs and bone marrow of mice 36, 37 . FLT3L promotes pDC development through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 38, 39 . LAMTOR2 is a member of the Ragulator complex known to inhibit mTOR signaling. Conditional deletion of LAMTOR2 in CD11c + cells (which include cDCs and pDCs) causes accumulation of FLT3 on the cell surface and massive expansion of pDC and cDC populations in older mice 40 . Recently, it was shown that FLT3L and type I IFN act synergistically to promote pDC development from common lymphoid progenitors by inducing upregulation of FLT3 41 . In addition to FLT3 signaling, M-CSF (also known as CSF1) may support the generation of pDCs 42 . Indeed, pDCs can be derived from M-CSFR + CDP 23, 27 and Csf1 \u2212/\u2212 mice have reduced numbers of both pDCs and cDCs 43 . By contrast, the growth factor GM-CSF inhibits FLT3L-driven pDC development 44 . GM-CSF-induced STAT5 signaling abolishes pDCrelated gene expression in FLT3 + progenitors and inhibits the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), which is crucial for pDC development, as discussed below 45 .\n\nE2-2 is the transcription factor essential for committing CDPs to the pDC lineage in both mice and humans 28, 46 (Figure 2 ). E2-2, along with the transcription factors E12, E47 and HEB (also known as TCF12), make up the E family of class I basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors 47 . E proteins form homodimers or heterodimers with each other and bind to conserved E box sequences, a process that can be perturbed by inhibitor of differentiation (ID) proteins. E2-2 binds to a large fraction of pDC-enriched genes and continuous expression of E2-2 in pDCs is required to maintain cell fate 28, 48 . Deletion of E2-2 in mature pDCs causes the loss of pDC-associated markers, spontaneous differentiation into cDC-like cells, upregulation of MHC class II molecules and, ultimately, an increase in the ability to prime T cells 48 . These cDC-like cells are similar to the steadystate noncanonical CX3CR1 + CD8\u03b1 + DC population that is related to pDCs 49 . CX3CR1 + CD8\u03b1 + DCs require E2-2 for development, harbor Ig heavy-chain (IgH) D-J rearrangements and are enriched for pDC-specific genes; however, they do not produce type I IFN in response to influenza virus and lack surface expression of classical pDC markers like B220 and BST2. Thus, noncanonical CX3CR1 + CD8\u03b1 + DCs may represent an alternative fate of pDC-committed cells that are unable to reach or maintain high enough levels of E2-2.\n\nID2, a repressor of E2-2, is essentially absent in pDCs, but is prominently expressed in cDCs and supports CD8\u03b1 + DC development from CDPs 28, 50 . pDC numbers are increased in Id2 \u2212/\u2212 mice 50 STAT3 and STAT5 help to regulate the balance between E and ID proteins during DC development by controlling the expression of E2-2 and ID2, respectively 52 . STAT3 stimulates FLT3L-dependent expression of E2-2, whereas STAT5 induces GM-CSFdependent expression of ID2 ( Figure 2) . A recent study also identified a transcriptional cofactor of the ETO family, MTG16, as a key factor that represses ID2, thereby driving pDC differentiation and restricting cDC development (Figure 2 ) 53 .\n\nTranscriptional targets of E2-2 in pDCs encode proteins involved in the development, homeostasis and function of pDCs, including the transcription factors SPIB, BCL11A, IRF8, RUNX2 and CIITA; the cell surface markers BDCA2, ILT7, SIGLEC-H; and the nucleic acid sensors TLR7, TLR9 and PACSIN1 28,48,54 ( Figure 2 ).\n\nSPIB is a transcription factor critical for the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors into pDCs and controls the survival of pDCs and their progenitors through induction of the antiapoptotic gene BCL2-A1 [55] [56] [57] [58] . pDC numbers are reduced in the bone marrow of Spib \u2212/\u2212 mice but are increased in the periphery, suggesting impaired retention in the bone marrow 59 . Furthermore, Spib \u2212/\u2212 pDCs exhibit attenuated expression of pDC-specific genes and display defects in type I IFN production following TLR7 or TLR9 stimulation. SPIB was also recently shown to be a novel immunohistochemical marker for the identification of human blastic pDC neoplasms 56 .\n\nBCL11A is necessary for the expression of IL-7R and FLT3 in early hematopoietic progenitor cells and wildtype mice reconstituted with Bcl11a \u2212/\u2212 fetal liver have severely reduced numbers of pDCs 60 . Moreover, genome-wide analyses of DNA binding has revealed that BCL11A regulates transcription of E2-2, Id2 and Mtg16 61 , thereby inducing a positive feedback loop for pDC development. IRF8 is essential for pDC and CD8\u03b1 + DC development: IRF8 deficiency results in the absence of pDCs and a reduction in the numbers of CD8\u03b1 + DCs 62 , as well as a decrease in all splenic DC subsets after competitive reconstitution of irradiated mice with wildtype and Irf8 \u2212/\u2212 bone marrow 63 . Loss of pDCs, cDCs and monocytes in an individual with an IRF8 mutation that impairs DNA binding and transactivation has also been reported 64 .\n\nfactor independent 1 (GFI1) and nuclear polyadenylated RNA-binding protein 2 (NAB2). Mice that express low levels of IKAROS lack peripheral pDCs, but not other DC subsets, and are impaired in their ability to produce type I IFNs in response to TLR7 or TLR9 ligands 222 . PU.1 directly regulates FLT3 expression in a concentration-dependent manner and is necessary for both pDC and cDC development 223 . XBP1 is a target of the unfolded protein response sensor IRE-1\u03b1 that maintains endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and prevents activation of cell death pathways 224 . XBP1 deficiency results in impaired survival and reduced numbers of pDCs and cDCs 225 . Treatment of pDCs with the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib reduces the active form of XBP1 and suppresses pDC survival and immunostimulatory functions by targeting ER homeostasis and the intracellular trafficking of TLRs 226 . Hypoxia-inducible factors influence hematopoiesis and maintain HSC function. Recently, it was shown that low oxygen content upregulates ID2 and suppresses FLT3L-induced pDC development, in a manner dependent on HIF1\u03b1 227 . GFI1 controls the development and functions of pDCs and cDCs in a STAT3dependent manner 228 and represses Rag transcription in pDCs 229 . NAB2 is a transcriptional corepressor that induces TRAIL expression in activated pDCs 230 . TRAILexpressing pDCs are tumoricidal 231 and induce apoptosis of CD4 + T cells in HIV viremic patients or after exposure to HTLV1 [232] [233] [234] .\n\nMicroRNAs represent another class of regulatory molecules that control different aspects of pDC development and function. miR-22 is induced in progenitor cultures by GM-CSF and it targets Irf8 mRNA for post-transcriptional repression 235 . Overexpression of miR-22 during DC development promotes the expansion of CD11b + cDC populations at the expense of pDCs. Epigenetic or chromatin modifiers may also have a prominent role in DC lineage commitment and development. In support of this, histone deacetylation is required for PU.1 recruitment to target genes (including Flt3, Irf8 and PU.1 itself) and for pDC differentiation from progenitors 236 .\n\nIn conclusion, while E2-2 is the master transcription factor for pDC development, it is becoming clear that E2-2 is a component of a multi-protein complex that includes both positive and negative regulators. More studies are required to define the various components of this complex as well as the genomic regions that interact with this complex and drive the expression of molecules that define pDC phenotype and function.\n\nInitial studies showed that pDC migration is quite different from that of cDCs. Following their development in the bone marrow, pDCs circulate in the blood and reach T cell areas of lymph nodes mainly through high endothelial venules (HEVs) and not through afferent lymphatics 67, 68 . In addition to secondary lymphoid organs, pDCs also migrate from blood into peripheral tissues. pDC migration involves CD62L, PSGL1, \u03b21 and \u03b22 integrins and multiple chemokine receptors, such as CXCR4, CCR7, CXCR3, CCR5, CCR2, CCR6, CCR10 and CCR9 ( Figure 3 ) 68, 69 .\n\nCXCR4 is required for the retention of pDCs in the bone marrow stromal niche and their development 70 . CXCR4 and CCR7 mediate the migration of pDCs into the splenic white Swiecki pulp 71 . CXCR4 also promotes pDC recruitment to tumors that produce CXCL12 72 . During inflammation, CXCR3 and CCR5 drive pDC migration into inflamed tissues 73,74 . CCR2, which is expressed with a bimodal distribution on pDCs 65 , drives recruitment of pDCs to the skin following inflammation induced by topical application of imiquimod 75 . CCR6 and CCR10 are expressed by a subset of pDCs in human tonsil and facilitate migration to inflamed epithelia in response to CCL20 and CCL27 76 . pDC recruitment to the thymus and small intestine requires CCR9 77,78 , whereas pDC migration into the colon is CCR9independent 79 . MAdCAM-1 and \u03b27 integrin were recently shown to promote pDC trafficking into the intestinal intraepithelial compartment 80 . pDCs can also migrate in response to engagement of receptors for chemerin (ChemR23), adenosine, as well as C3a and C5a, which are released at sites of tissue damage 68 . CX3CR1 is expressed by pDCs; however, its role in pDC migration and homeostasis is not well characterized.\n\nSeveral studies have recently identified intracellular proteins that selectively impact pDC trafficking in the steady-state and in disease. Human and mouse pDCs express CD2associated protein (CD2AP) 81 , an intracellular protein that regulates actin dynamics and promotes pDC migration to lymph nodes during inflammation 82 . DOCK2, a hematopoietic cell-specific CDM (Caenorhabditis elegans Ced-5, mammalian DOCK180 and Drosophila melanogaster myoblast city) protein, is necessary for migration of pDCs to lymph nodes and the periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths of the spleen 83 . Chemokine-induced Rac activation is severely impaired in Dock2 \u2212/\u2212 pDCs, resulting in the reduction of motility and the loss of polarity during chemotaxis 83 .\n\nThe recognition of viruses or self nucleic acids by pDCs is mainly mediated by TLR7 and TLR9, which are located in endosomal compartments. Activation of these receptors in pDCs results in secretion of type I IFNs via the MyD88-IRF7 pathway as well as production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines via the MyD88-NF-\u03baB pathway (reviewed in [6] [7] [8] Whether engagement of TLR7 or TLR9 results in the production of type I IFN or proinflammatory cytokines depends on the type of compartment in which these TLRs encounter their ligands ( Figure 4 ) 93, 94 . Multimeric CpG-A oligonucleotides aggregate in early endosomes where they activate the MyD88-IRF7 pathway that induces type I IFNs. In contrast, monomeric CpG-B is transferred to an endolysosomal compartment, where it activates the MyD88-NF-\u03baB pathway that triggers expression of costimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. IkappaB kinase-alpha (IKK\u03b1) 95 , osteopontin 96 and mTOR 97 are key components of the MyD88-IRF7 signaling pathway, while IRF5 is essential for MyD88-NF-\u03baB signaling 98, 99 . Trafficking of TLR9 to the subcellular compartment for type I IFN production is dependent on adapter protein 3 (AP3), as virus-or CpG-induced type I IFN expression is abolished in the absence of AP3 100, 101 . Forward genetic approaches have further identified Slc15a4, which encodes the peptide/histidine transporter 1 (PHT1), and BLOC1 and BLOC2 Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome proteins as key components required for TLR9 signaling in pDCs but not in other cell types 101 . However, TLR9-mediated recognition of large DNA-containing immune complexes is independent of AP3 102 and requires the convergence of phagocytic and autophagic pathways. This process is called microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)associated phagocytosis (LAP) and involves autophagy-related proteins but not the conventional autophagic pre-initiation complex. Recognition of live, single stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses by TLR7 in pDCs also occurs in a distinct subcellular compartment that requires transport of cytosolic viral replication intermediates into the lysosome by autophagy 103 .\n\nSeveral additional molecules involved in TLR7/9 signaling have been identified in pDCs. The scavenger receptor SCARB2/LIMP-2 is highly expressed in pDCs and regulates TLR9dependent type I IFN production by mediating TLR9 endosomal translocation and IRF7 nuclear translocation 104 . Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is a TLR9-interacting protein that regulates TLR9 trafficking to endosomal compartments and type I IFN production in pDCs 105 . PACSIN1 is an endocytic adapter specifically expressed in mouse and human pDCs that is essential for TLR9-induced type I IFN secretion but not pro-inflammatory cytokine production 54, 106 . VIPERIN is an IFN-inducible antiviral protein that promotes TLR7 and TLR9 signaling in pDCs by recruiting IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) to lipid bodies and inducing nuclear translocation of IRF7 107 . In addition to having a role in pDC migration, DOCK2 is essential for TLR7-and TLR9-mediated type I IFN production in pDCs, most likely because of its influence on actin cytoskeleton and vesicular trafficking 108 . In the absence of DOCK2, phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1 and nuclear translocation of IRF7 are impaired in pDCs, but the capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines is maintained. TLR9, but not TLR7, signaling is also dependent on Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) 109 . Blocking BTK inhibits all TLR9-induced responses in pDCs, including cytokine production and expression of costimulatory molecules. Additional studies are required to provide an integrated view of how all these molecules coordinate the trafficking and signaling properties of TLR7/9containing vesicles in pDCs.\n\nAlthough TLR7 and TLR9 are important for pDC detection of viruses and self nucleic acids, recent evidence indicates that mouse pDCs also express TLR12 and TLR2, which permit detection of Toxoplasma gondii profilin 110 and bacterial polysaccharide A (PSA) 111 , respectively. Although TLR11 and TLR12 can both recognize profilin, TLR12 is sufficient for profilin detection in pDCs and triggers the production of IL-12 and type I IFNs, which activate NK cells 110 . Furthermore, in contrast to Tlr11 \u2212/\u2212 mice, Tlr12 \u2212/\u2212 mice are highly susceptible to T. gondii infection, which suggests a critical role for pDCs in the induction of the innate immune response and host resistance. PSA is an immunomodulatory molecule expressed by the ubiquitous gut microorganism Bacteriodes fragilis 112 . pDCs exposed to PSA via TLR2 express MHC class II, inducible costimulatory ligand (ICOSL) as well as CD86, and stimulate IL-10 production by CD4 + T cells, all of which are required for protection against colitis 111 .\n\nAlthough TLRs have been established as the main innate receptors involved in pDC activation, the impact of cytosolic nucleic acid sensors on type I IFN or pro-inflammatory cytokine production by pDCs has just begun to be explored. CpG-A oligonucleotides selectively bind to the DExD/H-box helicase 36 (DHX36) and this is associated with the nuclear translocation of IRF7 and type I IFN production in pDCs 113 . By contrast, CpG-B oligonucleotides are bound by DHX9, and this results in NF-\u03baB activation and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in pDCs. Additionally, in the absence of type I IFN signaling, viruses can replicate in pDCs, producing viral nucleic acid that can be detected in a RIG-I-like helicase-dependent manner 85 . Major cytosolic sensors of nucleic acids, such as cGAS and STING 114 , are likely to be investigated in pDCs in the near future as well.\n\nHuman and mouse pDCs express cell surface receptors that control the amplitude of type I IFN production and pDC activation state in response to TLR7 or TLR9 ligands 115 . Many of these receptors either contain intracellular tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) or they deliver intracellular signals through an associated adaptor, usually DNAX activation protein 12 (DAP12) or the \u03b3 chain of Fc receptors (FcR\u03b3), which have an intracellular tyrosinebased activation motif (ITAM \n\nMicroRNAs and hormones can also impact TLR7 and TLR9 signaling and pDC functions. Expression of miR-146a is induced upon engagement of TLR7 and TLR9, and this suppresses NF-\u03baB activation and TLR-mediated signaling in pDCs 128 . miR-155 and its starform partner miR-155* are expressed in pDCs after TLR7 signaling and have opposing effects on type I IFN production 129 . Shortly after TLR7 stimulation, miR-155* is induced and augments type I IFN expression by inhibiting IRAKM, whereas miR-155 induction occurs later and shuts down type I IFN production by targeting TAB2. miR-126 has a prominent role in promoting the survival and function of pDCs 130 . miR-126 targets the mTOR pathway and regulates the expression of genes including Tlr7, Tlr9, Nfkb1 and Kdr, which encodes the growth factor receptor VEGFR2. pDC homeostasis and the capacity to respond to TLR ligands are impaired in both miR-126 \u2212/\u2212 and Kdr \u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating a role for VEGFR2 in supporting type I IFN production 130 .\n\nRecently, it was shown that TLR7-mediated signaling in pDCs is enhanced by estrogen 131 .\n\nNotably, this would provide a mechanistic basis for the observation that pDCs from women produce more type I IFN in response to HIV than pDCs from men 132 .\n\nBecause pDCs express MHC class II molecules as well as the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86, they can present antigens to CD4 + T cells, albeit not as efficiently as cDCs (reviewed in 133, 134 ) . Antigen presentation by pDCs can lead to CD4 + T cell activation or tolerance induction, depending on the context (Figure 1 ). When pDCs receive activation signals through TLRs or other pattern recognition receptors, they act as immunogenic cells. When pDCs are either unstimulated or alternatively activated such that they express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) [135] [136] [137] [138] , ICOSL 139 , OX40L 140 , programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) 141 and/or granzyme B 142 , they promote tolerance to tumor cells, alloantigens and harmless antigens. Recent studies have proposed that pDCs that capture antigens in peripheral tissues utilize CCR9 to migrate to the thymus, where they induce deletion of antigen-specific thymocytes, thus contributing to immune tolerance 77 . It has also been reported that CCR9 + pDCs are potent inducers of regulatory T (T Reg ) cell function and can inhibit acute graft-versus-host disease induced by allogeneic CD4 + donor T cells in irradiated recipients 143 . This study defined pDCs as being either B220 + CD11c + CCR9 + or B220 + CD11c + CCR9 \u2212 , the former being the tolerogenic subset; however, a later study argued that B220 + CD11c + CCR9 \u2212 cells are not a subset of pDCs, but rather precursors of lymphoid tissue-resident cDCs 144 . In a mouse model of lung inflammation, adoptive transfer of CD8\u03b1 + pDCs suppressed the development of airway hyper-reactivity by inducing T Reg cells 145 ; however, it has been reported that CD8 subunit expression by mouse pDCs is variable and does not define stable subsets 146 . Corroborating this, earlier studies found that CD8\u03b1 is expressed by a fraction of pDCs in the steady-state but is induced on the majority of pDCs after activation 9, 147 . Thus, the role of pDC subsets in tolerance remains to be further explored.\n\nTo selectively examine pDC antigen presentation capacity, antigens have been specifically targeted to pDCs by conjugating them to antibodies specific for pDC cell surface molecules.\n\nA recent study found that targeting antigens to BDCA2 promotes immunological tolerance by suppressing antigen-specific CD4 + T cell and antibody responses upon secondary exposure to antigen in the presence of adjuvant, a process that involves both preservation of TReg cells and a decrease in effector CD4 + T cells 148 . Antigens targeted to pDCs through DCIR are also presented to T cells 120 . In mice, it was shown that targeting a T cell epitope derived from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) to pDCs via SIGLEC-H delays onset and decreases disease severity in a model of MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by reducing the expansion and polarization of Th1 and Th17 cell populations 149 . In contrast, antigen delivery to pDCs via BST2 in combination with TLR agonists generates robust cellular and humoral immunity and protects mice against subsequent viral infection or tumor growth 150 . Thus, targeting antigen to pDCs can either promote or inhibit antigen-specific immune responses, depending on the antigen formulation and mode of stimulation or delivery.\n\nWhile in mouse models, pDCs have been mostly studied for their impact on antigen presentation to CD4 + T cells, human studies have focused on pDC antigen presentation to CD8 + T cells 151, 152 . Human pDCs have recycling endosomes in which peptides can be continuously loaded on to MHC class I molecules, which enables efficient presentation of viral antigens to CD8 + T cells 153 . Through this mechanism, pDCs may contribute to adaptive responses during viral infections. 155 . Only in the case of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and HSV-2 infections has pDC-derived type I IFN been shown to be critical for viral control in mice, reducing both morbidity and mortality [156] [157] [158] . A recent study found that individuals carrying inactivating mutations in the IRF7 gene have a severe defect in pDC function and are selectively susceptible to influenza virus infections 159 . It remains to be determined whether the pDC defect is sufficient to cause susceptibility to influenza or if IRF7 has a more general impact on the capacity of all cells to respond to the virus. Paradoxically, pDC responses to acute viral infections may not always be beneficial. Recent evidence indicates that excessive production of type I IFNs, probably by pDCs, during influenza virus infection in 129 mice can result in uncontrolled inflammation and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis of bronchial epithelium 160 . Thus, the impact of pDCs on acute viral infections may vary considerably depending on the virus, route of infection and genetic background.\n\nThe role of pDCs in chronic viral infections, such as HIV-1, is even more complex, involving pDC activation, trafficking, type I IFN production and interaction with CD4 + T cells (reviewed in 161 ). HIV induces pDC activation through TLR7 but can also directly infect pDCs as they express CD4, CXCR4 and CCR5, which are co-receptors for viral entry.\n\nHIV promotes pDC trafficking to peripheral lymph nodes, and this is reflected by the reduced numbers of pDCs found in the blood of patients with HIV 161 . Moreover, new evidence indicates that pDCs upregulate the gut-homing markers \u03b14\u03b27 and CD103 and accumulate in the gut mucosa during SIV and HIV infections 162, 163 . Interestingly, pDCs from elite controllers also maintain a gut-homing phenotype, suggesting that gut trafficking of pDCs is independent of viral load 164 .\n\npDCs may contribute to the chronicity of HIV infection through dysregulated activation and type I IFN production (reviewed in 165 ). HIV-stimulated pDCs express low levels of maturation molecules, induce weak T cell responses and persistently secrete type I IFNs, due to HIV trafficking to early endosomes 166 . In addition, HIV-stimulated pDCs produce chemokines and express TRAIL, thereby promoting recruitment and apoptosis of T cells.\n\nHIV can also activate the noncanonical NF-\u03baB pathway in pDCs, resulting in the expression of IDO and induction of TReg cells 167 . Noncanonical NF-\u03baB signaling and induction of a tolerogenic pathway in pDCs stimulated with high doses of CpG has also been reported 168 . Studies in humanized mice have shown that depletion of pDCs prior to or during chronic HIV-1 infection severely reduces type I IFN production and increases viral replication 169 . However, HIV-1-induced CD4 + T cell death is curbed despite elevated viral loads, suggesting that pDCs suppress HIV-1 replication but also contribute to HIV-1 immunopathogenesis. Conversely, studies in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection have provided a different view. Blockade of TLR7-and TLR9-mediated IFN-\u03b1 production by pDCs did not diminish immune activation during SIV infection 170 , suggesting that other sources of type I IFN may contribute to immunopathology.\n\nThe beneficial or detrimental effects of pDCs and type I IFNs in chronic viral infections may also depend on the timing of their action. During SIV infection, the timing of type I IFN production has a marked effect on the disease course 171 . Exogenous administration of IFN-\u03b12a early on augments expression of antiviral genes and prevents systemic infection;\n\nhowever, sustained IFN-\u03b12a treatment induces type I IFN desensitization, decreases antiviral gene expression, increases viral load and accelerates CD4 + T cell loss. In mouse, constitutive absence of pDCs or loss of their ability to signal through TLR7 and TLR9 in chronic LCMV infection appears to negatively impact T cell priming and viral clearance 157, 172 . Moreover, early administration of exogenous type I IFN prevents chronic LCMV infection. However, late type I IFN administration has no beneficial effects 173 . In fact, blockade of type I IFN signaling during chronic LCMV infection improves T cell function and diminishes viral persistence 174, 175 . Thus, there is a window of opportunity -i.e. early during infection -when type I IFNs and pDCs can be both beneficial and necessary to prevent or control chronic viral infection and preserve T cell numbers and functions. Sustained activation of pDCs is also detrimental in SLE because it results in the resistance of pDCs to therapeutic glucocorticoids (GC), which are often administered to patients with SLE to control inflammation 182, 183 . Bioinformatics and functional analyses have suggested that TLR activation prevents GC-induced pDC apoptosis by inhibiting miR-29b and miR-29c, which promote pDC apoptosis by targeting MCL1 and BCL2 184 . Endogenous GC also have an impact on pDC homeostasis and survival 185 . Regulation of endogenous GC concentrations involves conversion of inactive substrates to active 11hydroxyglucocorticoids by an enzyme complex containing 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2HSD1) and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH). Under physiologic conditions, 11\u03b2HSD1-H6PDH increases the sensitivity of pDCs to GC-induced apoptosis; however, following activation with TLR ligands, the effects of enzyme activity are overridden. Genetic models that specifically address the contribution of pDCs in autoimmunity have been lacking until recently. Deletion of Irf8 in NZB mice and a mutation in Slc15a4 in C57BL/6.Fas lpr mice abolish production of autoantibodies and disease manifestations 188 .\n\nWhile this study provides compelling evidence that pDCs and their TLR7/TLR9-mediated responses are damaging in SLE, IRF8 and SLC15A4 are not exclusively expressed by pDCs.\n\nIn fact, B cell expression of SLC15A4 appears to be necessary for TLR7-induced expression of type I IFN and pathogenic antibody production in a mouse model of lupus 189 . Analysis of MRL.Fas lpr mice lacking MyD88 showed that MyD88-dependent production of IFN-\u03b1 by pDCs contributes to SLE pathogenesis, particularly B lymphopenia, but not to nephritis 190 . Two recent studies using lupus-prone mice that specifically lack pDCs have confirmed that pDCs are pathogenic in SLE. Global or CD11c-specific Tcf4 haplodeficiency in lupus-prone mice nearly abolishes autoantibody production and glomerulonephritis 191 , whereas transient depletion of pDCs prior to disease initiation in BXSB mice impairs expansion and activation of B and T cells and reduces antinuclear antibodies and expression of type I IFN-induced genes in tissues 192 . Taken together, these studies validate pDCs as a therapeutic target in SLE.\n\nChronic activation of pDCs and dysregulated type I IFN production also appear to be contributing factors in initiating and/or promoting psoriasis and type I diabetes (T1D). In psoriasis, self nucleic acids form complexes with antimicrobial peptides which activate pDCs through TLR7 and TLR9 [193] [194] [195] . Interestingly, the Vitamin D analogue calcipotriol, which is used to treat psoriatic skin lesions, triggers tolerogenic responses in cDCs and was recently shown to impair the capacity of both human and mouse pDCs to induce T cell proliferation and effector T cell differentiation 196 . In the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of T1D, activated B-1a cells produce DNA-reactive antibodies that stimulate release of cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) from neutrophils; CRAMP subsequently binds to self DNA and activates pDCs through TLR9 197 .\n\nThe deleterious role(s) of pDCs in psoriasis and T1D have not been confirmed yet in genetic models, but blockade of type I IFN or antibody-mediated depletion of pDCs appears to confer protection in mouse models of these diseases [197] [198] [199] . Future studies will be necessary to address whether either blockade of type I IFN or depletion of pDCs are potential therapeutic avenues for intervention in psoriasis and T1D in human.\n\nAs mucosal immunity and microbiome research is rapidly progressing, pDCs that reside within gut and gut-associated lymphoid tissues are also becoming the focus of increasing interest. In the TNBS-induced colitis model, PSA-induced protection is highly dependent on the ability of pDCs to induce the generation of IL-10-producing T Reg cells 111 . pDCs from the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes are also important for suppression of T cell responses and induction of oral tolerance 200 . In contrast to splenic pDCs, pDCs from Peyer's patches are unable to produce type I IFN after TLR7 or TLR9 stimulation 201 . pDCs that have been developed in the presence of type I IFN resemble Peyer's patch pDCs, produce inflammatory cytokines, stimulate Th17 cell generation and fail to secrete IFN\u03b1 after TLR engagement 202 . Therefore, factors expressed at mucosal sites inhibit type I IFN secretion by pDCs, but do not block the ability of pDCs to prime na\u00efve T cells and trigger T Reg and Th17 differentiation 203, 204 .\n\nGut-associated pDCs are also efficient at generating mucosal B cell responses under normal conditions and during infection with a gut-tropic virus. In the steady-state, pDCs from Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes induce T cell-independent IgA production 205 . Specifically, the microbiota activates stromal cells to produce type I IFN, which drives pDC expression of BAFF and APRIL that facilitate IgA responses in the gut. Viral clearance and protection against reinfection with rotavirus, an intestinal pathogen, is highly dependent on B cells 206 . Type I IFN production by human and mouse pDCs exposed to rotavirus appears to be necessary for B cell activation, virus-specific antibody secretion and viral clearance during infection 206 . How the microbiota influences pDC functions is largely unknown, but an earlier study found that colonization of the intestine with a restricted microflora resulted in lysis of pDCs by activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes 207 . Therefore, specific microbial communities are likely to have a profound impact on pDC homeostasis and function through both direct and indirect mechanisms.\n\nAlthough many immune functions of pDCs have now been described, many questions still remain concerning their complex biology. Tuberculosis in humans is associated with a type I IFN signature 208 and pDC accumulation in lymph nodes 209 . So what is the role of pDCs in tuberculosis and in bacterial infections in general? Can bacterial products activate pDCs and what are the sensors for these products? Although pDCs accumulate in the microenvironment of some tumors, they are reduced in other cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 210 . What is the impact of pDCs in anti-tumor immune responses and can we exploit them to generate effective T cell responses (Box 3)?\n\nThe recruitment of pDCs to tumors is often associated with poor prognosis as tumorinfiltrating pDCs tend to be tolerogenic rather than immunogenic. Unstimulated or alternatively activated pDCs can induce T Reg cells through expression of IDO [135] [136] [137] [138] or ICOSL 139 . The accumulation of IDO-expressing cells in tumor draining lymph nodes has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with malignant tumors including breast carcinoma 137 . The infiltration of pDCs in primary tumors of patients with invasive nonmetastatic breast cancer correlates with shorter survival times, suggesting that pDCs contribute to the progression of breast cancer 237 . Breast tumor-associated pDCs are poor producers of type I IFN and favor the expansion of T Reg cells 238 . The mechanisms suppressing type I IFN production and immunogenic capacity of breast tumor infiltrating pDCs include tumor cell-derived TGF-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 239 , both TGF-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 inhibit type I IFN secretion by pDCs 201, 240 . ICOSL expression on pDCs also appears to correlate with breast cancer progression by supporting amplification of IL-10 producing T Reg cells 241 .\n\nRecruitment of pDCs to ovarian tumors is driven by CXCL12 and is associated with impaired T cell responses and poor prognosis 72,242 . Compared to pDCs in blood or ascites, ovarian tumor-associated pDCs produce less type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in response to TLR stimulation and induce IL-10 production from allogeneic naive CD4 + T cells, suggesting that they play a critical role in the induction of immune tolerance and progression of ovarian cancer 243 .\n\nHuman pDCs may also contribute to cancer progression via the production and release of the pro-apoptotic molecule granzyme B 12 , which suppresses T cell proliferation. Activation of pDCs through TLR agonists and CD40 ligand negatively regulates granzyme B expression and the ability of pDCs to suppress T cells 142 . In contrast to NK cells, pDCs do not release the pore-forming protein perforin, and therefore are unable to kill tumor target cells by release of lytic granules.\n\nOn the other hand, pDCs can promote immunogenic anti-tumor responses if appropriately stimulated. Injection of activated pDCs loaded with tumor-associated peptides into metastatic melanoma patients leads to favorable CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, indicating that vaccination strategies employing activated pDCs might be an attractive therapeutic strategy to overcome immune tolerance in certain types of cancer 244 . In an orthotopic murine mammary tumor model, intratumoral administration of a TLR7 ligand results in tumor-associated pDC activation and has a potent anti-tumor effect 245 . In the B16 melanoma mouse model, TLR-stimulated pDCs mediate tumor killing through expression of TRAIL and granzyme B 75 as well as through the activation of NK cells 246 . The ability of pDCs to produce cytolytic mediators and the functional relevance of this capacity in the elimination of target cells and immune regulation has been extensively debated; however, it has been shown that the FSME-IMMUN vaccine against tick-borne encephalitis stimulates pDCs to upregulate neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1, also known as CD56) and TRAIL expression, thereby generating a subset of pDCs that combines the abilities of interferon production and antigen presentation with that of lysing target cells 247 . CD56 expression is also typical of several neoplastic human pDC tumors 248 .\n\nAlthough SLE is generally associated with a type I IFN signature, it has been recently shown that pDC production of type I IFN is impaired in patients carrying a variant of the PTPN22 gene predisposing to SLE 211 . This observation raises the question of whether pDC and type I IFN depletion is a valid strategy for all SLE patients or should be adopted after stratification of the patients for pDC activity. Recent studies suggest that pDC dysfunction in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases may extend to scleroderma 212 , Sj\u00f6gren syndrome 213 , Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome 214 and atherosclerosis 215 . Is there a role for pDCs in other inflammatory diseases such as IBD? Is manipulation or elimination of pDCs a feasible therapeutic strategy for some of these diseases? Whether pDCs are valid targets during viral infections remains a matter of debate. While pDC activation may be beneficial at early stages of infection, depletion of pDCs may be considered during chronic viral infections, such as HIV, when type I IFN may exert negative effects.\n\nAddressing these and other questions in mouse models will require advanced tools to deplete pDCs in vivo. The development of CLEC4C-DTR transgenic mice has provided a method for specific but transient pDC depletion 216 . Conditional targeting of E2-2 in CD11c + cells has enabled constitutive depletion of pDCs 157 , although CX3CR1 + CD8\u03b1 + DCs 49 , which are closely related to pDCs, and possibly B cell subsets expressing CD11c may also be affected. It will be important to continue to identify pDC-specific genes that can be used for development of pDC lineage-specific deficient mice and pDC-specific Cre deleters. With the recognition of pDC involvement in human pathologies, it is predicted that these cells will be more extensively evaluated for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Indeed, it will be interesting to explore the therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies that selectively target pDCs in many of the disease scenarios discussed above.\n\nThe less abundant of the two strands of microRNA (miRNA) that are generated during miRNA biogenesis. Star-form miRNAs may have important functions in miRNA regulatory networks noncanonical NF-\u03baB pathway\n\nNuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling that is induced by certain members of the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily and predominantly activates p52-RELB NF-\u03baB complexes. By contrast, canonical (or classical) NF-\u03baB signaling typically involves the activation of p50-RELA dimers and is induced by a wider range of pro-inflammatory stimuli The development of pDCs from CDPs is regulated by specific cytokines and transcription factors. FLT3L-STAT3 signaling promotes expression of E2-2, which is the master transcription factor required for pDC development. The absence of E2-2 or its deletion in mature pDCs results in the complete loss of pDCs or the differentiation of pDC-committed cells into cDC-like cells, respectively. In contrast, GM-CSF-STAT5 signaling blocks pDC differentiation during DC development by inducing expression of ID2, which is an antagonist of E2-2. The transcriptional cofactor MTG16 promotes pDC differentiation and restricts cDC development in part by repressing ID2. Transcriptional targets of E2-2 encode proteins associated with pDC development, homeostasis and function. SPIB, BCL11A and IRF8 are necessary for pDC differentiation and/or survival while RUNX2 controls pDC homeostasis through expression of the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5, which permit egress from the bone marrow. CIITA promotes MHC class II expression. BDCA2, ILT7 and SIGLEC-H are markers that are selectively expressed by human or mouse pDCs and are involved in regulation of type I IFN production. TLR7, TLR9 and PACSIN1 enable pDC recognition of nucleic acids and pathogens (i.e. RNA and DNA viruses), resulting in type I IFN secretion and/or pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Swiecki pDCs express chemokine receptors and homing molecules that promote recruitment in the steady-state and during inflammation. Development of pDCs in bone marrow (BM) stromal cell niche requires CXCR4 expression, while pDC egress from the BM into the blood is dependent on CCR5 and CCR2. pDCs are attracted to tumors that produce CXCL12 (not shown) and the splenic white pulp via CXCR4. DOCK2, a hematopoietic cell-specific CDM family protein involved in CXCR4 signaling, is also necessary for pDC migration to spleen and lymph nodes (LNs). pDCs express CD62L, PSGL-1, \u03b21/\u03b22 integrins and the chemokine receptors CCR5, CXCR3 and CCR7 which mediate adhesion and chemotaxis to peripheral LNs and the splenic white pulp under normal and/or inflammatory conditions. Blood pDCs express the chemerin receptor, ChemR23, as well as A1-R, C3aR and C5aR, which may guide them to peripheral LNs and damaged tissues. CD2AP is an intracellular protein that regulates actin dynamics and promotes pDC migration to LNs under inflammatory settings. CCR2 drives the recruitment of pDCs to the skin following inflammation induced by the TLR7 agonist, Imiquimod. CCR6 and CCR10 are expressed by a subset of human tonsil pDCs and enable migration to inflamed epithelia producing CCL20 and CCL27 (not shown). CCR9 and its ligand CCL25 (not shown) promote trafficking of peripheral pDCs to the thymus and are required for pDC recruitment to the small intestine under both normal and inflammatory conditions. MAdCAM-1, \u03b27 integrin and CD103 also influence pDC trafficking to the gut. Finally, pDCs express CX3CR1 (not shown), which may impact their homeostasis. pDCs sense DNA viruses, synthetic CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODN) and endogenous DNA through TLR9. All TLR9 signaling requires MyD88 but additional factors determine whether TLR9 engagement will result in type I IFN (IFN-I) or pro-inflammatory cytokine production. These factors include mode of ligand entry, and the intracellular compartment where TLR9 encounters its ligand. TLR9 is transported to appropriate intracellular compartments by UNC93B 249, 250 and requires cleavage in order to recruit MyD88 251, 252 . DNA viruses, CpG ODN and small DNA immunecomplexes (DNA-ICs) enter pDCs through endocytosis and meet TLR9 in the early endosome. In contrast, large DNA-ICs are internalized by phagocytosis and encounter TLR9 and UNC93B in the early phagosome. If AP3 or LC3 are recruited then the IRF7 endosome or IRF7 phagosome is formed which leads to IFN-I production. Several molecules/pathways are involved in this process including IKK\u03b1, osteopontin (OPN), SLC15A4, BTK, BLOC1, BLOC2, DOCK2, PACSIN1, PLSCR1, VIPERIN, SCARB2 and the mTOR pathway. Alternatively, TLR9containing compartments can form NF-\u03baB endosomes or NF-\u03baB phagosomes resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (i.e. IL-6, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, etc). This process requires IRF5, BTK and SLC15A4. CpG ODN have different structures which results in trafficking to different compartments: CpG-A is transported to the IRF7 endosome and is a strong inducer of IFN-I, while CpG-B aggregates in the NF-\u03baB endosome and is a potent stimulator of maturation and cytokine/chemokine production. CpG-C exhibits properties of both CpG-A and CpG-B in that it can induce both IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokines. TLR7 stimulation by viral and endogenous RNA may follow similar pathways."}
