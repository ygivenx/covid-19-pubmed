The mixture was filtered through a pad of celite and the filtrate concentrated. The resultant reddish brown oil was dried under vacuum to give a brown solid in quantitative yield. 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3, \u03b4 = 7.24 ppm); \u03b4 9\uf0203 9 \uf020\uf020s \uf020\uf020\uf020H\uf020\uf020\uf0208 \uf020\uf0209 \uf0208 \uf020\uf0206 \uf020m \uf020\uf020\uf020H\uf020\uf020\uf0207 \uf0203 3\uf0207\uf0202 8 \uf020\uf020m \uf020\uf020\uf020H\uf020\uf020\uf0207 \uf0202 \uf020\uf0207 \uf020\uf0206 \uf020\uf020m \uf020\uf0202 H\uf020\uf020\uf0207 \uf020\uf020\uf0206 \uf0209 2 \uf020\uf020m \uf020\uf020 3H\uf020\uf020\uf020 6 \uf0207 \uf020\uf020 \uf020t, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 3.83 (s, 3H). To synthesize 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1Hbenzoimidazole-2-thiol (substance (5) in supplement 1), a solution of substance (4) (7.0g, 32.7 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 (100.0 ml) at 0\u00b0C was combined with 1,1-thiocarbonyldiimidazole (5.83g, 35.9 mmol) and the mixture stirred for 30 minutes. The cold-bath was removed and the mixture stirred for a further two hours before adding water (50 ml). The organic layer was separated and washed with water (50.0 ml), dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and concentrated. The residue was triturated with CH 2 Cl 2 and hexanes to give a grey solid (6.5 g 88% yield). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3, \u03b4 = 7.24 ppm); \u03b4 10.7 (s, 1H), 7.46-7.42 (m, 2H), 7.28-7.09 (m, 5H), 6.95(d, J = 7.6 Hz, 1H), 3.93 (s, 3H).\n\nTo generate 2-bromo-N-(2-chloro-4-methylphenyl)propanamide (substance (6) in supplement 1), a solution of 2-chloro-4-methyl-aniline (3.0g, 24.8 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 (100.0 ml) at 0\u00b0C was treated with i-Pr 2 NEt (6.5 ml, 37.3 mmol) and 2-bromo propionyl bromide (3.3 ml, 29.6 mmol) and the mixture stirred for one hour. The organic layer was separated and washed with 1N NaOH (2 x 30.0 ml), dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and concentrated to give a white solid (5.1g, 74% yield) that was dried under vacuum and used without further purification. 1 To synthesize 2-(1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)thio-N-(2-chloro-4-methylphenyl) propanamide (substance (8) in supplement 1), a solution of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole (500.0 mg, 3.33 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (30.0 ml) was treated with NaH (150.0 mg, 3.75 mmol) and the mixture stirred for 10 minutes. Substance (6) (supplement 1) (920.0 mg, 3.33 mmol) was added to the reaction and the mixture stirred for six hours. Water (15 ml) was added and the product extracted using ethylacetate, the organic layer then dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and concentrated. The crude product was purified by silica column chromatography (hexanes/ethylacetate; 2:1) to give 740.0 mg of substance (8) in 64% yield. The product was used in consecutive steps without characterization. For synthesis of JMN5-165, a solution of substance (8) (supplement 1) (100.0 mg, 0.29 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 (3.0 ml) was mixed with benzenesulfonyl chloride (40.0 mL, 0.31 mmol) and i-Pr 2 NEt (80.0 mL, 0.46 mmol) and the reaction stirred for eight hours. NaHCO 3 (2.0 ml) was added to the reaction mixture, the organic layer separated and washed with brine (2.0 ml), then dried over Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated. The crude product was purified by silica column chromatrography (hexanes/ethylacetate) to give a white solid that was dried under vacuum. 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3, \u03b4 = 7.24 ppm); "}
