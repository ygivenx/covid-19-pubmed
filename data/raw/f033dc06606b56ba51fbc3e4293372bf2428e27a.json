{"title": "To appear in: Current Opinion in Environmental Science & Health", "body": "Sewage sludge is a product of wastewater treatment which can contain metals, pharmaceuticals, organic compounds such as phthalates, pesticides, phenols, polychlorinated biphenyls, personal care products, and pathogens [1] . Due to low capacity of current wastewater processing systems, the escalating amount of sewage sludge from wastewater treatment facilities has become a notable concern [2] . In the US, 79 million dry tons of liquid organic waste including sewage sludge was produced every year [2] . Furthermore, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicts a cost of 2% of global GDP to treat all of the human waste currently generated [3, 4] .\n\nHydrothermal processing (HTP), where water serves as an important solvent and reactant, uses sub-and super-critical water (and sometimes organic co-solvents) to convert sewage sludge into valuable end products in absence of free oxygen (i.e., a thermochemical deoxygenating process ) [2] . Because HTP can directly use water as a reaction medium, there is no need for moisture removal prior to processing, thus significantly reducing the energy usage of HTP as compared to other waste conversion mechanisms (e.g., oil extraction and pyrolysis) [2] .\n\nHTP is a promising method to manage sewage sludge as it can concurrently convert sewage sludge into useful products while also reducing the environmental and health risks posed by excess sewage sludge in the environment. Products from HTP are normally biocrude oil, aqueous products (containing fertilizer precursors), and hydrochar [5, 6] . Yields from the process depend on the reaction temperature [6] , reaction time [6] , feedstock characteristics (e.g., biochemical compositions, physicochemical properties, ash contents [2, 6, 7] , initial pressure [8, 9] , total solid content [7] , co-solvents [9, 10] , and catalyst composition [6, 9] .\n\nHydrothermal processing can be classified into hydrothermal carbonization [11] , hydrothermal liquefaction [6] , and hydrothermal gasification [12, 13] based on reaction parameters including temperature, pressure and time.\n\nThis perspective focuses on recent publications (within the last two years) about hydrothermal carbonization and liquefaction of sewage sludge. Literature regarding the use of hydrothermal gasification to treat sewage sludge in the past two years is limited and thus was not included. Table 1 also identifies the key literature on HTP of biowaste within the last two years. \n\nHTC decomposes organic matter under high temperatures and in the presence of water to produce solid products (225-320\u00b0C, Table 1 ). Products resulting from HTC are primarily hydrochar (a solid phase enriched in carbon content), some liquid products containing phenolic compounds, and a small quantity of gas (mostly CO 2 ) [18] . HTC shares similar working temperatures with HTL [14] . However, HTC mainly generates solid products, while the major product from HTL is a viscous liquid: biocrude oil.\n\nHTC is mainly governed by dehydration, decarboxylation and decarbonylation mechanisms [19] . In the last five years, HTC has been extensively used for phosphorus recovery. Thus, this perspective focuses on recent publications about recovering phosphorus from sewage sludge via HTC.\n\nIn the context of HTC, the phosphorus speciation is important so it is critical to understand the mechanism of phosphorus transformation during HTC. Selective transfer and conversion of phosphorus in sewage sludge has been investigated in two ways. Standard measurements and testing methods were used to understand the speciation and bioavailability of phosphorus. NMR and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis were also used to characterize the transformation of phosphorus [11, 14] . The addition of hydrogen chloride was used to achieve a high-efficiency transfer of phosphorus into the aqueous phase [14] . Precipitation of phosphorus by struvite was conducted to recover the phosphorus originated from sewage sludge [11] .\n\nHTL requires elevated temperatures (260-450 o C) and pressures , at which water is present in the sub-or super-critical state [6, 13, 17] . Ionic and free radical reactions are believed to be the major reactions in HTL. The kinetics of these reaction pathways have been studied to investigate the relationship between temperature and pressure on reaction yield, with temperature showing a large effect on the output of the process [13] . Sub-critical water exhibits limited interaction with sewage sludge due to low diffusivity and, therefore, acts mainly as a reaction medium [13] . In contrast, super-critical water exhibits higher diffusivity and increases the rate of interaction between solvent and sewage sludge. This conclusion is based on growing evidence that the rate constants of HTL reactions are heavily dependent on pressure in the critical pressure point where water reaches super-critical conditions (i.e., the nearcritical region of water) [20, 21] . The conversion efficiency is highly enhanced when water reaches the super-critical point [12] .\n\nWhen water changes from the normal conditions (20 o C/0.1 MPa) to its critical point (374 o C/22 MPa), the density, viscosity, and dielectric constants of the liquid change significantly [22] . In fact, the density of water can be changed by adjusting temperature and pressure in the sub-and super-critical states. In the near-critical water region, hydrogen bonding in water is weaker and thus water can serve as a hydrogen donor for sewage sludge conversion. In the super-critical region, however, free radical reactions are dominant because the possibility of generation of radicals from a series of elemental reaction steps grows at high temperatures [13, 20, 21] . In short, the effect of pressure is different on sub-critical and supercritical water. For sub-critical water, temperature is the dominant factor affecting the reaction efficiency while for super-critical water both temperature and pressure play a key role promoting the conversion efficiency.\n\nHTL converts various types of sewage sludge into biocrude oil [2, 7, 22] . In addition, HTL has also been used to achieve dechlorination [23] , denitrogenation [24] , and the removal of chemicals of emerging concerns (CECs) [25, 26] . This perspective focuses on using HTL for environmental health promotion.\n\nDechlorination is necessary for treating chlorinated waste (e.g., sewage sludge containing polyvinyl chloride, PVC) [23] . Currently established chlorine (Cl) removal technologies mainly focus on inorganic Cl removal. Alkaline bases or ammonia are usually added to promote Cl transformation from the organic to the inorganic state [27] . Hydrochloric acid (HCl) produced in HTL can be neutralized by alkaline bases (e.g., KOH), resulting in inorganic salts (e.g., KCl) that can be removed easily from the solid phase by washing. Results show that up to 96 % of inorganic chlorine can be removed by HTL and one-time washing with a water to product ratio of 1:1 [28] .\n\nSewage sludge usually contains around 3% of nitrogen, with the majority as organic nitrogen in complex molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, and low nitrate (NO 3 \u2212 ) content [24] . Burning of sewage sludge can release nitrogen oxides (NO x ). These NO molecules have highly disruptive potential in the environment and can contribute to environmental issues including the greenhouse effect, photochemical smog, acid rain, acidification of aquatic system and visibility degradation. Thus, denitrogenation of sewage sludge is necessary.\n\nAnalysis of the significant factors in denitrogentation yield gives three main steps in the reaction.\n\nFirst, denitrogenation process yields typically increase with temperature and reaction time in HTL. These conditions likely increase the opportunity for dissolution and hydrolysis of proteins and thus release more nitrogen. Second, Nitrogen yield also varies markedly with changes in pH in the reaction medium,\n\nindicating that denitrogenation occurs readily under acidic or basic conditions during HTL [29] . Finally, more Nitrogen can be removed by increasing the basicity of alkaline metals used to separate nitrogen from the mixture through ionic reaction pathways. Identification of these factors leads to a theory that denitrogenation happens via an ionic reaction path catalyzed by OHions in aqueous alkaline solutions [29] .\n\nHowever, denitrogenation is still a key challenge of HTL biocrude oil converted from high-protein sewage sludge because traditional petroleum upgrading techniques mostly focus on deoxygenation, desulfurization, or cracking reactions which fails to deal with problems related to high nitrogen content [6, 17, 21] . HTL biocrude oil converted from high-protein feedstocks typically has a 3-7% nitrogen content, which is inappropriate for fuel application [8] . To date, denitrogenation of HTL biocrude oil has been investigated with hydrotreating [30, 31] , cracking [31, 32] , chemical extraction/separation from HTL biocrude oil [33, 34] , and super-critical fluid treatment [35] [36] [37] . However, the high nitrogen content of biocrude oil generated by HTL would result in fouling of conventional catalysts (e.g., zeolites) because of the high basicity caused by the nitrogen-heterocyclic compounds [15, 34, 38] . Developing catalysts suitable for denitrogenation represents a knowledge gap in this area.\n\nHowever, upgraded HTL biocrude oil can be used a s a 5-10% drop-in fuel (e.g., blending 10%\n\nupgraded HTL biocrude with 90% petroleum fuel) such that the nitrogen content would be highly diluted and therefore less of a concern. In addition, identifying which nitrogen-containing compounds negatively affect combustion processes is also essential (e.g., nitrogen-heterocyclic compounds versus nitrogencontaining alkyl compounds). Further combustion tests are needed to examine the effect of nitrogencontaining compounds on combustion performance and emissions of HTL biocrude oil. Consolidation and concentration of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and other wastewater solids are also significant causes of concern. Antibiotics, for example, are particularly scrutinized as they increase the risk of antibiotic resistance through genetic mutation of bacterial strains present in wastewater treatment facilities. Antibiotics and their metabolites can enter sewage through feces, urine or direct medication disposal and will enter the environment if not removed during sewage treatment.\n\nRemoval of bioactive compounds (by tracking radiolabeled 14 C) can be done with HTL [25] , where biocrude oil can be produced simultaneously. With the addition of granular activated carbon in a mixed algal-bacterial bioreactor, HTL can also be used to remove estrogenic hormones [26] .\n\nIn the last two decades, HTL has attracted a large amount of interest in the area of converting sewage sludge and high water content biomass into valuable products. Because of the operational simplicity, the [41] . Table 2 shows that most of the continuous HTL reactors used were operated in plug flow (PFR) mode. The reactor size varied from lab (0.05 L) to pilot scale (35 L). The largest flow rate available in literature was 90L/h from the University of Sydney [10] . A continuous-flow pilot plant reactor was operated at temperatures of 300-350\u02daC. The process was a fast HTL process (residence time 3-5 min) so the reactor size was not big (estimated to be 4.5-7.5 L). In comparison, the largest flow rate documented in the literature was 60 L/h from Aarhus University (Denmark) [42] . The residence time was 20 min, which led to a 20 L of reactor volume. Recently, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign also developed a 35 L continuous PFR using swine manure and food processing waste as feedstock [2, 22] .\n\nThe biocrude oil products were proven to be suitable for powering transportation machinery after modest refinement (below 100 \u00b0C) [2, 22] .\n\nSummarizing from the available literature, it is generally agreed that possible peripheral bottlenecks to the scale-up (continuous or pilot-scale) of HTL include 1) continuous feeding/pumping mechanism, 2)\n\nhigh-pressure pumping, 3) reactor corrosion caused by salts, 4) fouling/clogging of the continuous reactor, 5) product collection system, and 6) technology suitable for abating strong odors [6, 22, 40, [42] [43] [44] . Detailed discussion of each possible bottleneck is described below:\n\n(1) Continuous feeding/pumping mechanism.\n\nThe continuous feeding mechanism is identified as one possible peripheral bottleneck because of two reasons. First, phase separation may occur in sewage sludge. This would be a serious issue especially in the winter, given that sewage sludge may contain high amounts of water (water would freeze in the winter and thus an external heating source is needed for the feeding tank). Secondly, the viscosity of the sewage sludge could be very high and thus slow down its flow rate. Preferably, a 20-25 wt.% of solid content is favored to achieve a net positive energy gain [7, 44] . However, increasing the solid content may decrease the flowability of sewage sludge. The viscosity of the sewage sludge slurry dictates if the pumping system can be stably operated with a constant feedstock flowrate to the reactor. Possible solutions include the development of efficient pumping methods and pretreatments to reduce the viscosity of sewage sludge [40, 45] .\n\nSewage sludge can be very viscous and may contain solid particles (e.g., gravel) and other compositions (e.g., plastic waste) that cannot be well homogenized before entering the up-scaled HTL system. In this case, specialized high-end pumps such as metering pump (i.e., a valveless rotary piston pump) are required to avoid possible blockage and undesired backflow (caused by flaky particles) in the sewage sludge feedstock [43] .\n\nSewage sludge feedstock may contain corrosive contents. For instance, dechlorination and debromination would be necessary for treating chlorinated and brominated waste (e.g., sewage sludge may contain polyvinyl chloride, PVC, or brominated flame-retardants that may exist in electronics) [27, 28] .\n\nUnwanted restriction of flow in continuous-flow reactors can result in serious clogging. In particular, the sewage sludge feedstock may contain highly volatile content (e.g., food waste), semi-volatile content (e.g., paper or plastic), and non-volatile content (e.g., metals and minerals) [22] . Because of a huge difference of their volatility (which indicates their convertibility under HTL), possible clogging may occur. How to mitigate or prevent the clogging when running a continuous pilot-scale HTL reactor is especially important because even a small clogging would build up the pressure and lead to safety problems. To resolve this issue, a recent study in Aarhus University (Denmark) has used a hydraulic oscillator to enhance the mixing of sewage sludge by increasing the turbulence in the reactor system [42] .\n\nThe products from HTL may be flowable at relatively high temperature (e.g., >100\u00b0C) but not at ambient conditions (i.e., 20-25\u00b0C). Without a proper collection system, the HTL products may also lead to clogging of full-scale continuous-flow reactors. Furthermore, how to safely reduce the pressure from the reactor system to the product collection end is another issue. Last but not least, optimization of heat exchanger represents an important aspect of the product collection system and a significant factor in the overall energy efficiency of a continuous HTL system [40] .\n\nSewage sludge typically contains certain amounts of proteins, which would be converted into odorous compounds such as nitrogen-containing (e.g., ammonia and pyridines) and sulfur-containing (e.g., H 2 S) compounds under HTL. Removal of these odorous compounds would be critical for a large scale HTL operation to meet industrial hygiene and safety standards.\n\nAdditionally, catalysis has also been recently used in continuous HTL reactors to increase the oil yield and oil quality [42] . These improvements of the continuous HTL reactor design are the foundation for the future commercial implementation of HTL with economically feasible business scenarios. \n\nAn energy analysis of HTP is critical because innovations in wastewater treatment technologies and clean energy are interdependent. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimated that about 4% of the nation's electricity use goes to moving and treating water and wastewater [55] . A recent report to the U.S. Congress expected that the demand for electricity at drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities (WWTF) will increase by 20% as populations grow and environmental requirements become more severe [55] . For instance, in Massachusetts alone, 20 million MWh energy (0.5% of the nation's electricity consumption) is used by WWTF and 54% of this energy is related to aeration operation for sludge treatment ( Figure 1A ) [55, 56] .\n\nBiochemical and thermochemical processes are two main technologies for management of sewage sludge.\n\nTraditionally, incineration was used to dispose of sewage sludge. Conventional incineration systems generally consume more energy than they produce because of the high moisture content in sewage sludge. Alternatively, anaerobic digestion (AD), an oxygen-free microbial fermentation of organics for biomethane generation, could be considered to cope with the increasing quantity of sewage sludge. AD is generally more effective than incineration for energy recovery. AD is also the most common method for sewage sludge stabilization, resulting in the reduction of volatile solids. However, AD usually suffers from poor conversion efficiencies (<50%), slow reaction rates (several weeks), and high capital costs. Moreover, a large volume (>50%) of the wet residual digestate (or AD sludge) would be generated after AD [57] .\n\nHTP is an emerging technology for AD sludge conversions with considerably faster reaction times (minutes) and high conversion efficiencies (>50%). Herein, we have provided an estimated energy process input, energy output/input for processes, and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of different sewage sludge treatment methods ( Figure 1B ; more details are included in Table S1 in Supplementary Data). As Figure 1B shows, HTP can recover at least four-times the amount of energy put into in a lab-scale reactor, primarily because HTL can directly treat wet feedstock without drying (but not other methods). Compared to similar technologies for AD sludge management (e.g., landfilling), HTP not only sterilizes the sludge but also converts it into valuable end products with 11-times higher energy recovery and emissions in GHG decreased by 78-85% [2] . Multiple published studies also suggest that an integration of AD and HTP could benefit a resilient water-energy nexus [2, 5] .\n\nEnergy consumed by different sectors in WWTF (the data was from prior publication, see more details in [55, 56] ); and (B) Comparison of (a) process energy input, (b) energy output/energy input, and (c) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of HTL and the current solutions, as well as competitive technologies (Notably, we only compared the energy demand and GHG emissions during the production process. Energy demand and GHG emissions for implementing the entire system are excluded.) (the data was from previous publications, see more details in [2, 5] and supplementary data). \n\nLiterature showed that using algal feedstock to produce biocrude oil via HTP was costly with more than 70% of total cost attributed to algae harvesting ( Figure 2) (Figure 2 ). If combined improvements in the analyses are considered, cost of HTP fuel could be significantly reduced. Moreover, it should also be pointed out that by recycling the soluble organics into the HTP process, the main energy vector (i.e., biocrude oil) would be increased, instead of being distributed out of the system. \n\nMore research on low-temperature sewage sludge treatment is required to reduce the environmental impact of HTP. For instance, co-solvent HTP has been shown as an effective way in increasing the biocrude oil yield and enhancing the process efficiency of HTP [10] . Various organic solvents with different solvent to water ratios may lead to an effective co-solvent mixture for HTP to maximize reaction yields at lower temperatures. Kinetic study of HTP will also give a better understanding of generic reaction pathways and the formation of HTP products.\n\nBefore commercializing HTP, techno-economic analysis of the process along with energy calculations should be examined. Further research should be done with continuous flow reactors using different types of sewage sludge and co-solvents. Particularly, increasing the sewage sludge concentration to around 20-25% without losing the flowability of the slurry for continuous HTL is critical in terms of process development to industrial scale [40] . A higher solids content of sewage sludge (with a maximum of 35% from a batch scale study) typically can lead to a higher biocrude oil yield. As a result, the energy balance of continuous HTL systems would be improved because energy lost to a volume of water would decrease with a reduction in water content and therefore the production costs can be reduced [9] . One possible method to increase the sewage sludge concertation is pretreatment of sewage sludge. For instance, several pretreatment methods using acid hydrolysis, alkaline treatment , liquid hot water, ammonia and steam explosion were applied to the slurries for enabling their pumpabilty for continuous HTL systems [40, 45, 60] . It was also found that an alkaline environment was preferable for preparing pumpable woody biomass for continuous HTL reactions [45, 60] . Of course, further pretreatment also would further increase overall process costs.\n\nThe primary objective of sewage sludge management is to develop more environmental-friendly processes to reduce environmental pollution risks of sewage sludge to human. Hydrothermal processing (HTP), including hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and liquefaction (HTL), is a promising method to sustainably manage sewage sludge because it can convert sewage sludge into useful products while mitigate the environmental risks of sewage sludge simultaneously. HTC has been extensively used for phosphorus recovery, while HTL can effectively remove chemicals of emerging concerns. Energy analysis of HTP indicated that HTP has a 11 times higher energy recovery than landfilling. Further research on techno-economic analysis, environmental impact, and commercialization potential of HTP technology is recommended.\n\nCorrespondence and requests for materials should be addressed to Prof. Wan-Ting Chen (WanTing_Chen@uml.edu)."}
