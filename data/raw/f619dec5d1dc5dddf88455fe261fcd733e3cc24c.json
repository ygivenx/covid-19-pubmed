{"title": "Innate immune response to arenaviral infection: a focus on the highly pathogenic New World hemorrhagic arenaviruses", "body": "Arenaviruses are a family of RNA viruses that often establish chronic infection in their natural rodent hosts 1 . The geographic distribution of each arenavirus is determined by the range of habitats of its natural rodent hosts 2 (Table 1) . Infection in humans is believed mainly through respiratory exposure to virus containing aerosols or by direct contact of abraded skin with infectious materials, and may cause severe morbidity and mortality in humans 1; 3 . Studies involving intragastric infection of rhesus macaques and mice experimentally as well as serological survey in rodent consumers suggest that gastric mucosa could also be targeted by the virus 4; 5; 6 . Based on the antigenicity, phylogeny, and geographical distribution, arenaviruses can be divided into the Old World (Lassa-The S segment encodes for the viral NP (nucleoprotein) and the GPC (glycoprotein precursor). The GPC is cleaved into the SSP (stable signal peptide) by signal peptidase and the mature glycoproteins GP1 and GP2 by the host subtilase SKI-1/S1P (subtilisin kexin isozyme-1/site 1 protease) 1; 25; 26 . SSP association is required for the transport of GPC through the Golgi compartment, in which the active form of SKI-1/S1P resides 26; 27 . GP1 and GP2 form the viral spikes on the surface of virion and mediate receptor recognition and virus entry. The SSP is also assembled with GP1 and GP2 into virus particles, which is unique for arenaviruses.\n\nPathogenic Clade B NW arenaviruses (i.e. JUNV, MACV, GTOV and SABV) use the hTfR1 (human transferrin receptor 1) and the TfR1 orthologs of their natural host as the cellular receptor for viral entry of host cells. For example, the pathogenic NW JUNV can use both hTfR1 and the TfR1 ortholog of its natural host, Calomys musculinus. Meanwhile, non-pathogenic Clade B NW arenaviruses (i.e. AMAV and TCRV) use TfR1 orthologs but not the hTfR1 as the cellular receptor 28; 29; 30; 31; 32 . The OW and the clade A and C NW arenaviruses use the \u03b1DG (\u03b1-dystroglycan) as their cellular receptor 33; 34 . Exposure to the low-pH environment of the late endosome is required to enhance membrane fusion by GPCs, which are reported to be unusually resistant to low pH 35 \n\nThe race between virus infection and host innate immune response often determines the outcome of virus infection. Type I IFNs (interferons) including different species of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, are the essential components for host mucosal innate defense 39; 40; 41; 42 . Type I IFNs are rapidly secreted from virus-infected cells and act to establish an antiviral state in infected cells and uninfected neighboring cells. Additionally, IFNs also stimulate and regulate cells involved in innate and adaptive immunity such as NK cells, NKT cells, T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Different cytokines, chemokines and innate immune cells (e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells and NK cells) also play critical roles in host innate response to virus infection.\n\nHost germline-encoded PRRs (pattern recognition receptors) have broad specificity and can potentially bind to numerous PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns), including PAMPs present in microbes 43 . Upon recognition of PAMPs, PRRs are rapidly activated and stimulate host cells to counteract virus infection by mounting the early innate immune response in order to prevent further infection and virus growth. Induction of type I IFN expression is controlled by three different classes of PRRs 44; 45; 46 : RLRs (retinoic acid inducible gene-I like receptors), TLRs (Toll-like receptors), and NOD (nucleotide oligomerization domain)-like receptors 43; 47; 48 . RLRs are comprised of RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene-I), MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5) and LGP2 (laboratory of genetics and physiology 2) that are cytosolic helicases sensing features unique to viral RNA 49 . RIG-I detects 5\u2032-triphosphate ssRNA (single-stranded RNA) as well as short (<2 kbp) dsRNAs (double-stranded RNAs) in most cell types, whereas MDA5 is responsible for recognition of virus derived long (>2 kbp) dsRNA as well as a synthetic dsRNA [poly(I:C)] 46; 50; 51 . Upon binding to viral RNA, activated RIG-I and MDA-5 transduce the signal to the downstream IPS-1 (IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator-1) (also known as MAVS, VISA, or CARDIF) 52 on mitochondrial membranes. IPS-1 serves as a scaffold to recruit the signal adapter, TRAF-3 (tumor necrosis factor-receptor associated factor-3); the activated complex activates the IKK-\u03b5/TBK-1 (serine/threonine kinases I\u03baB kinase-\u03b5/ TANK-binding kinase-1) complex and the IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 complexes 53; 54; 55 (Fig 1) . Activated IKK-\u03b5/TBK-1 complex phosphorylates IRF-3 (IFN regulatory factors-3) and/or IRF-7, while the IKK\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3 complex phosphorylates NF-\u03baB. These transcription factors undergo nuclear translocation and initiate the expression of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b1 and other proinflammatory cytokines 44; 56; 57; 58 .\n\nTLRs are a group of transmembrane proteins contributing to the recognition of various pathogen-specific molecules. Most TLRs are expressed on cell surfaces, while TLR7, TLR8, TLR9 and in some cases TLR3 are located in intracellular endosomal compartments 59 . TLR3 and TLR7/8 play critical roles in recognizing viral dsRNA and ssRNA, respectively 60 . TLR2 detects measles virus hemagglutinin protein 61 and TLR4 is implicated in the detection of envelope proteins of respiratory syncytial virus and mouse mammary tumor virus 62; 63 . All TLRs, with the exception of TLR3, rely on MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88) as the adaptor molecule to activate the downstream TAK1 (transforming growth factor-r-activated kinase 1) 64; 65 . Activated TAK1 phosphorylates and activates the IKK complex, followed by activation of NF-\u03baB and expression of various proinflammatory cytokines 66; 67 . TLR3 and TLR4 pathways are dependent on TRIF (Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing INF\u03b2) 68; 69 as the downstream adaptor molecule, which activates the TRAF3-TBK-1/IKK\u03b5 cascade and mediates the phosphorylation of IRF-3 to initiate IFN-\u03b2 expression 70 . Expressed Type I IFNs are secreted from infected cells and interact with the IFN receptor on cell surface in an autocrine or paracrine manner 71 . This triggers the expression of a spectrum of ISGs (IFN stimulated genes) 72; 73 , which ultimately execute the IFN-induced antiviral activities in a collaborative manner by targeting various steps of viral life cycle 74 . Expression of some ISGs could also be mediated directly by IRF-3/IRF-7 independent of IFN production, particularly in dendritic cells and macrophages 75; 76 .\n\nOW LCMV infection in its natural host, Mus musculus, has been extensively studied as an important model in elucidating the immune response of natural hosts to arenaviruses. LCMV causes either an acute infection followed by virus clearance or a chronic/persistent infection in described murine models. The difference in the disease outcome is largely determined by the IFN response at the early stage of virus infection 77; 78; 79 . A potent IFN response may inhibit virus replication at early stage and induce virus-specific CD8+ T cell, resulting in virus clearance. However, a modest level of IFN production at early stage could eventually allow persistent infection, as IFN response is unable to suppress virus multiplication to the level that is required for virus clearance by CD8+ T cells later during infection 80; 81; 82; 83 . On the other hand, the details of the immune response to other arenaviruses in their natural hosts are largely unknown. Experiments using NW JUNV and NW Catarina virus to infect of their natural hosts, Calomys musculinus and Neotoma micropus, respectively, showed age-dependent antibody elevation and persistent infection 84; 85; 86 . It is possible that arenaviruses may be maintained in their natural hosts by suppression of both innate and adaptive antiviral responses.\n\nIt is known that LASV infection causes immunosuppression in patients, as evidenced by the lack of induction of IFN production, proinflammatory response or T cell activation in vitro or in vivo 1; 87; 88; 89; 90 . Lymphopenia and lymphoid depletion in spleen and lymph nodes has been reported in Lassa fever patients 91; 92; 93 . Furthermore, it has been reported that the level of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor) and IL-1\u03b2 (interleukin-1\u03b2) are low in human macrophages and dendritic cells infected by LASV in vitro 94; 95 . Lack of induction of costimulatory molecules, such as CD86, has been reported in LASV-infected dendritic cells 94; 95 . In addition, LASV-infected dendritic cells fail to activate virus-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells 96 . Thus, insufficient immune responses in macrophages and dendritic cells probably contribute to severe disease progression of Lassa fever, particularly in fatal cases.\n\nImmune responses to LASV have been studied in NHPs (non-human primates). Lymphopenia has been identified in LASV-infected cynomolgus monkeys 97; 98 , meanwhile depletion or reduction of T cells and B cells has also been found in livers and spleens of LASV-infected marmosets 99 . Thus, lethal LASV infection in NHPs seems to be accompanied with weak innate and cellular immune responses, and uncontrolled viral replication, which are similar to that usually found in patients 24; 97; 98; 99\n\nFor NW arenaviruses that cause VHF in humans, very few clinical studies are available regarding the innate immune response in humans, with the exception of AHF. Nevertheless, AHF clinical studies have revealed dysregulated IFN and cytokine production in patients. High levels of endogenous IFN-\u03b1 (2,000-64,000 IU/mL), along with elevated levels of cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1, are present in serum of patients in the acute stage of disease, whose cytokine levels are correlated with disease severity 100; 101 . IFN induction has also been found in animal models of AHF 102; 103 . IFN likely contributes to the AHF diseases as IFN-\u03b1 level was linked to the severity of symptoms such as fever, chills and backache 100 . Also high levels of endogenous IFN-\u03b1 in AHF patients have been linked to low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and platelet abnormality 104 . This abnormality has been also demonstrated experimentally in an in vitro study showing that JUNV infection of human hematopoietic progenitor CD34+ cell and human megakaryocyte impairs platelet formation and function via type I IFN pathway 105 . Induction of type I IFNs has also been reported in the rhesus macaque model during JUNV and MACV infections 102; 106 , although it is still unclear if increased IFN is related to disease progression and time to death. Rodent animal models have been used to study the pathogenesis of NW arenaviruses as well 18; 107 . Adult mice are generally resistant to infection by VHF-causing NW arenaviruses. JUNV and TCRV cause diseases in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice with some histopathological changes similar to that found in AHF patients 108 used as a model to study the pathogenesis of the OW LASV. While the non-pathogenic P2 strain of PICV causes mild disease, the P18 strain, which has been serially passaged in guinea pigs, causes lethal hemorrhagic fever in guinea pigs 113 . Elevated levels of TNF in serum and spleen are initially observed in inbred guinea pigs during the late phases of the pathogenic P18 strain infection 21 . However, a later study reported that P18 strain-infected peripheral blood leukocytes had decreased transcripts for cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) relative to that of P2 straininfected cells, meanwhile reduced TNF-\u03b1, IL-8 and IL-12p40 mRNAs have also been observed in peritoneal cells from P18 strain-infected guinea pigs relative to that of mockinfected animals 23 . The result of latter is also consistent with previous studies showing that JUNV and LASV infection either inhibit or fail to induce these cytokines in human macrophages 90; 114 . Intriguingly, these IFNs and inflammatory cytokines seem to be basically elevated in human pathogenic NW arenavirus (e.g. JUNV and MACV) infections in patients and animal models but not in OW arenavirus (e.g. LASV) infection.\n\nThe innate immune response to NW JUNV infection has been studied in cultured cells. Monocytes, macrophages, dendritic and epithelial cells involved in innate immune response are also suggested as the initial target cells for JUNV and other arenaviruses 115; 116; 117; 118 . TLR2, but not TLR4, has been shown to recognize JUNV GPs and initiate IFN-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 production in mouse macrophages 119 . Similarly, some strains of non-pathogenic OW LCMV are also recognized by TLR2 and MyD88/Mal pathway in murine central nervous system glial cells and macrophages 120; 121 . However, no elevation in the levels of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, or TNF-\u03b1 was detected in cultures of human monocytes and macrophages infected with the pathogenic Romero strain of JUNV, suggesting these cells might not be the cellular source of IFN and cytokine production in vivo or the cytokine production in vitro is different from the one detected in vivo 114 . Meanwhile IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 were expressed in non-pathogenic NW TACV-infected cells in the same study 114 , indicating its inability to suppress innate immune response in these cells. On the other hand, RIG-I mediated IFN production and ISG expression are readily detected in human lung epithelial A549 cells during the infection of both pathogenic and vaccine strains of JUNV 122 , which also suggests that JUNV-infected parenchymal cells could be a cellular source of IFN in vivo. OW LCMV infection induces type I IFN responses in HEK293 cells and murine embryonic fibroblast cells in a RIG-I-and MDA5-dependent manner 123 . Further studies are required to clarify the involvement of MDA5 in IFN response during JUNV and other NW arenavirus infections.\n\nThe non-pathogenic PICV P2 strain has been shown to induce higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in murine monocyte-like cells than the pathogenic P18 strain 124 . PICV P2 infection produces an increased amount of the transcription-activating NF-\u03baB p65/p50 heterodimer, whereas P18 strain infection induces accumulation of the transcription-repressing NF-\u03baB p50/p50 homodimer 124; 125 . Infection by the PICV P2 strain is also accompanied with enhanced activation of JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT signaling pathway in murine monocytelike cells 126 . These data suggest that a more potent innate immune response could possibly contribute to the protection of guinea pigs from PICV P2 strain infection.\n\nArenaviruses have utilized several strategies to evade host innate immune response, particularly to subvert the IFN pathway. NPs from almost all arenaviruses examined are capable of interfering with type I IFN induction in vitro 123; 127; 128; 129 . In a co-transfection assay, NPs of LCMV, LASV, PICV, JUNV, and MACV inhibited the Sendai virus-induced nuclear translocation of IRF-3 in Vero cells 128 (Fig 1) . Sendai virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 and IRF-3 promoter expression is dose-dependently inhibited by different arenavirus NPs in 293T cells 128 . LCMV NP has been shown to directly interact with RIG-I and MDA5 123 . However a mutant NP lacking IFN inhibitory activity is still able to bind to both RIG-I and MDA5 proteins, suggesting that NP binding alone is not sufficient to interfere with RIG-I/ MDA5 function. The IFN antagonist activity is mapped to the C terminal DIEGR motif (D382, G385, E384 and R386) of the LCMV NP 127; 128; 129 . Interestingly, this DIEGR motif also partially overlaps in amino acid sequence with the five amino acids (D382, E384, D459, H517 and D552) that are critical for NP 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity as determined by structure studies 130; 131 . Mutation of these five amino acids that are required for exonuclease activity diminishes the NP exonuclease activity and also coincidentally abolishes the NP IFN antagonistic activity in reporter assays 131 . It has been proposed that the exonuclease activity could reduce the opportunity of viral RNA to be exposed to RIG-I or MDA5, a hypothesis that still remains to be confirmed in virus-infected cells (Fig 1) . LASV with mutations of these key amino acid residues shows enhanced IFN and cytokine production in infected cells, supporting a link of exonuclease activity and NP-mediated suppression of IFN response 132 . Additionally, NP directly interacts to and blocks IKK\u03b5 to interfere with IRF-3 phosphorylation and activation 133 (Fig 1) . Meanwhile NPs from NW and OW arenaviruses (e.g. LCMV, LASV, PICV, JUNV, and MACV) inhibit the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB 134 . This could allow arenavirus to down-regulate the NF-\u03baB pathway that is required for expression of many proinflammatory cytokines and IFN.\n\nUntil recently, the NP of non-pathogenic TCRV was believed to be unable of inhibiting the IRF-3 pathway and the NF-\u03baB pathway 128 due to its sequence variation in the DIEGR motif. However, it has been found that some TCRV isolates actually contain the important NP residues required for IFN antagonism 135 as NPs of other arenavirus, suggesting that at least some of the TCRV strains might also retain the IFN antagonistic activity of NP.\n\nThe arenavirus Z protein is another viral protein that contributes to the virus suppression of type I IFN response 136 . The Z proteins from NW arenaviruses (i.e., JUNV, MACV, GTOV and SABV), but not from the OW arenaviruses (i.e., LCMV and LASV), bind to RIG-I and interfere with the interaction between RIG-I and IPS-1, resulting in inhibition of nuclear translocation of IRF-3 and IFN-\u03b2 expression in A549 cells 136 (Fig 1) .\n\nFurthermore, the short double-stranded RNAs with the overhanging 5\u2032ppp-G residue present at the 5\u2032-end of arenavirus genomic and antigenomic RNA species are poor substrates for RIG-I binding and therefore are proposed to contribute to virus evasion from RIG-I recognition 137; 138 .\n\nIt seems that the IFN antagonistic activities of arenavirus NP and Z proteins could not absolutely abolish host innate immune response: infection by many OW and NW arenaviruses still induces IFN and cytokine production in the context of virus infection as shown in different studies 78; 79; 100; 101; 119; 120; 122; 139 . It is possible that in the early stage of virus infection, when viral NP and Z protein are at low level and mostly engaged in viral replication, host cells still could sense virus replication and activate the innate immune response.\n\nTaken together, both NW and OW arenaviruses use several strategies to evade or subvert the host innate immune response by inhibiting IFN and inflammatory cytokine production. These activities might help the virus to counteract host innate immune response and contribute to viral pathogenesis.\n\nThe NW arenaviruses include many important human pathogens. The impact of innate immune response on arenavirus infection and its role in pathogenesis varies remarkably depending on the virus, host, age, infection dose, infection route and immune conditions. Based on studies on many non-pathogenic viruses, such as TACV 114 , Mopeia virus (a nonpathogenic OW arenavirus closely related to LASV) 139 and some less virulent strains of PICV 126 or LCMV 77; 78; 79 , it is tempting to conclude that the viral pathogenicity is often inversely associated with a higher level of cytokine or IFN response, indicative of the inhibitory effect of potent innate immune response against virus infection. In contrast, the pathogenic OW arenaviruses, such as LASV and LCMV, utilize several strategies to efficiently subvert or evade host innate immune response and cause severe diseases. However, the infection by VHF-causing NW arenavirus JUNV is distinct; JUNV triggers strong cytokine and IFN response in humans, which is associated with high mobility and mortality 100; 101 . It is worthy to note that many arenaviruses (e.g. JUNV and MACV) are relatively resistant to IFN treatment in vitro 122; 140 . As the innate immune response could be either beneficial or detrimental to the host, future studies are required to investigate whether dysregulated innate immune response could contribute to the pathogenesis of VHFcausing NW arenaviruses, similar to influenza virus 141 and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus infection in humans 142; 143 . Also studying the role of the innate immune response during the NW arenavirus infection will help us to design new strategies to develop vaccines and treatments against VHF-causing NW arenavirus infection.\n\nThe authors' research is supported by Public Health Service grant R01AI093445 to S.P..

Arenavirus NPs possess 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity and are proposed to degrade viral dsRNA or ssRNA to reduce the exposure of viral RNA to RIG-I and MDA-5. Z protein of the New World arenavirus, but not of the Old World arenavirus, inhibits RIG-I signaling cascade probably as a result of its direct binding to RIG-I protein. NP further interacts with IKK\u03b5 and inhibits TBK-1/ IKK\u03b5 activation to interfere with phosphorylation and activation of IRF-3 or IRF-7. NP prevents activation of NF-\u03baB. It is still unclear whether suppression of TBK-1/ IKK\u03b5 complex by NP could directly lead to inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation. On the other hand, New World arenavirus JUNV GP is recognized by TLR2 pathway and triggers IFN and cytokine production in mouse macrophages."}
