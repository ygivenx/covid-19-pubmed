The third aim was to describe the funding structure and major contributing sectors, 114 such as government, industry, non-governmental organizations, or academia, behind these 115 publications. 127 In MEDLINE we performed a highly sensitive search solely using the term \"Zika\". A 128 complementary search in EMBASE used a more specific ontology: \"Zika AND (forecasting OR 129 prediction OR model OR modeling OR modelling OR risk OR estimating OR dynamics) NOT 130 mouse\". Both database searches were limited to articles published as of March 1, 2017, and the 131 MEDLINE searching was restricted to those publications released between February 1, 2016 and 132 March 1, 2017.

This finding reflects not only the availability but also 268 the importance of such data. Case count data in particular are often hard to access but critical 269 to many modeling approaches. Rapid sharing of case count data during international public 270 health emergencies, as well as open, curated, rapidly accessible baseline demographic, human 271 mobility, climate, and environmental datasets are essential to quickly leverage modeling and 272 forecasting efforts (109). Our review also identified several relatively underused data streams.\n\n273 First, socioeconomic and behavioral data were conspicuously absent. The lack of behavioral 274 components in these models is concerning given the importance of these factors on disease 275 dynamics. Second, real-time internet-based data-streams, such social-media and internet 276 search-engine data, were used in a minority of ZIKV prediction studies identified in this 277 systematic review. The limited use of internet 'big data' in the models suggests that either 278 these data are of lower value for epidemic forecasting or that methods have yet to be 279 developed to efficiently extract important information from them. Such data streams may be 280 more commonly used in forecasting in the future as their strengths and weakness become 281 clearer (117).\n\n283 Genomic data were absent from these published models. During the pandemic, sequencing 284 platforms were employed to generate data critical to diagnostic and countermeasure 285 development (118), but our systematic review revealed that these data were not incorporated 286 into prediction frameworks during the first year of ZIKV pandemic. This may reflect that early This article is a US Government work.

In the future, as new methods are 296 developed, and genomic data become more readily available, the use of these data will likely 297 become more common in prospective forecasting frameworks.\n\n299 Our systematic review did not delve deeply into modeling approaches, but did identify a 300 preponderance of deterministic as opposed to stochastic models. Both categories of models 301 have pros and cons and their use is often informed by the specific question being addressed, in 302 addition to data availability (123). Deterministic models may generally be easier to produce, but 303 they do have limitations for intrinsically stochastic processes like epidemics, such as 304 underestimating uncertainty (124). Uncertainty is particularly important in this context where 305 uncertainties are generated by the epidemic itself, data collection, and analytical approaches.\n\n306 Moreover, forecasts are ideally used to inform the mobilization of resources to save lives, a 307 context in which clearly characterizing uncertainties is paramount. This is also a clear area for 308 improvement in model output reporting; only 43% of studies completely reporting uncertainty. This article is a US Government work.

To the extent permissible with ethical and privacy constraints, publishing the 326 aggregated data used to fit and validate models is critical. Not only would sharing data support 327 full reproducibility, but sharing would also enable other researchers to use data in their own 328 complementary modeling efforts. Modelers could therefore help answer calls for increased 329 data sharing during public health emergencies (103, 109, 130) . Exploring how data can be This article is a US Government work.

Second, we found that only 30% of studies were made available as preprints prior 347 to peer review despite endorsements of preprints by major public agencies, funders, and 348 journals. Those posted were available a median of 119 days prior to peer-reviewed publication.\n\n349 An analysis of preprints for all Zika publications over a similar time period found similar 350 publication delays but much lower overall preprint use compared to the studies analyzed here 351 (3.4% versus 30%) (131). This greater adoption may indicate a changing preprint culture which This article is a US Government work.

Addressing 376 these areas can improve our understanding of Zika and other outbreaks and ensure that 377 forecasts can inform preparedness and response to future outbreaks, epidemics and 378 pandemics.
