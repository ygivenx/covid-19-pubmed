{"title": "The genome of the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis: a model for animal 2 development, regeneration, immunity 3 and lignocellulose digestion 4 United Kingdom Molecular and Cell Biology", "body": "5.4kb, similar to intron size in H. sapiens (5.9kb) but dramatically longer than introns in D. pulex (0.3kb), 208 D. melanogaster (0.3kb) and C. elegans (1kb) ( Figure 5B ). 209 For downstream analyses of Parhyale protein coding content, a final proteome consisting of 28,666 210 proteins was generated by combining candidate coding sequences identified with TransDecoder [57] from 211 mixed stage transcriptomes. Almost certainly the high number of predicted gene models and proteins is 212 an overestimation due to fragmented genes, very different isoforms or unresolved alleles, that will be 213 consolidated as annotation of the Parhyale genome improves. We also included additional high 214 confidence gene predictions that were not found in the transcriptome ( Figure 4C ). The canonical 215 proteome dataset was annotated with both Pfam, KEGG, and BLAST against Uniprot. Assembly quality which are fragments that do not contain a large ORF, also mapped to the assembled genome. Together 221 these data suggest that our assembly is close to complete with respect to protein coding genes and 222 transcribed regions that are captured by deep RNA sequencing.\n\nHigh levels of heterozygosity and polymorphism in the Parhyale genome 224 To estimate the level of heterozygosity in genes we first identified transcribed regions of the genome by 225 mapping back transcripts to the assembly. Where these regions appeared in a single contig in the 226 assembly, heterozygosity was calculated using information from mapped reads. Where these regions 227 appeared in more than one contig, because haplotypes had assembled independently, heterozygosity was 228 calculated using an alignment of the genomic sequences corresponding to mapped transcripts and 229 information from mapped reads. This allowed us to calculate heterozygosity for each gene within the 230 sequenced individual (Supplemental Data 9). We then calculated the genomic coverage of all transcribed 231 regions in the genome and found, as expected, they fell broadly into two categories with higher and lower 232 read coverage ( Figure 6A ; Supplemental Data 9). Genes that fell within the higher read coverage group 233 had a lower mean heterozygosity (1.09% of bases displaying polymorphism), which is expected as more 234 reads were successfully mapped. Genes that fell within the lower read coverage group had a higher is not substantially different between genes from the higher (0.88%) versus lower coverage group genes 244 (0.73%; Figure 6C ). This analysis suggests that within captive laboratory populations of Parhyale there is 245 considerable additional polymorphism distributed across genes, irrespective of whether or not they have 246 relatively low or high heterozygosity in the individual male we sequenced. In addition the single male we 247 have sequenced provides an accurate reflection of polymorphism of the wider laboratory population and 248 the established Chicago-F strain does not by chance contain unusually divergent haplotypes. We also 249 performed an assessment of polymorphism on previously cloned Parhyale developmental genes, and To further evaluate the extent of polymorphism across the genome, we mapped the genomic reads to a set 256 of previously Sanger-sequenced BAC clones of the Parhyale Hox cluster from the same Chicago-F line 257 from which we sequenced the genome of an adult male. [18] . We detected SNPs at a rate of 1.3 to 2.5% 258 among the BACs (Table 3) and also additional sequence differences between the BACs and genomic 259 reads, confirming that additional polymorhism exists in the Chicago-F line beyond that detected between 260 in the haplotypes of the individual male we sequenced. 261 Overlapping regions of the contiguous BACs gave us the opportunity to directly compare Chicago-F 262 haplotypes and accurately observe polynucleotide polymorphisms, that are difficult to detect with short 263 reads that do not map when polymorphisms are large, but are resolved by longer Sanger reads. (Figure   264 7A). Since the BAC clones were generated from a pool of Chicago-F animals, we expected each 265 sequenced BAC to be representative of one haplotype. Overlapping regions between BAC clones could 266 potentially represent one or two haplotypes. We found that the genomic reads supported the SNPs 267 observed between the overlapping BAC regions. We found relatively few base positions with evidence 268 supporting the existence of a third allele. This analysis revealed many insertion/deletion (indels) with 269 some cases of indels larger than 100 base pairs ( Figure 7B ). The finding that polynucleotide with Scr in the first maxillary segment where they are co-expressed ( Figure 10A-A\") . As a negative 359 control, we detected no linkage between engrailed1 (en1) and Ubx or abd-A transcripts ( Figure 10B -B\" 360 and C -C\"). We then demonstrated the tightly coupled transcripts of lab with Dfd (co-expressed in the 361 second antennal segment, Figure 10D The ParaHox and NK gene clusters encode other ANTP class homeobox genes closely related to Hox 371 genes [83]. In Parhyale, we found 2 caudal (Cdx) and 1 Gsx ParaHox genes. Compared to hexapods, we 372 identified expansions in some NK-like genes, including 5 Bar homeobox genes (BarH1/2), 2 developing 373 brain homeobox genes (DBX) and 6 muscle segment homeobox genes (MSX/Drop). Evidence from 374 several bilaterian genomes suggests that NK genes are clustered together [84] [85] [86] [87] . In the current assembly 375 of the Parhyale genome, we identified an NK2-3 gene and an NK3 gene on the same scaffold 376 (phaw 30.0004720) and the tandem duplication of an NK2 gene on another scaffold (phaw 30.0004663).\n\nWithin the ANTP class, we also observed 1 mesenchyme homeobox (Meox), 1 motor neuron homeobox 378 (MNX/Exex) and 3 even-skipped homeobox (Evx) genes. catabolites is largely restricted to terrestrial species such as ruminants, termites and beetles. These 386 animals rely on mutualistic associations with microbial endosymbionts that provide cellulolytic enzymes 387 aquatic animals despite the fact that lignocellulose represents a major energy source in aquatic 389 environments, particularly for benthic invertebrates [93] . Recently, it has been suggested that the marine 390 wood-boring Isopod Limnoria quadripunctata and the amphipod Chelura terebrans may have sterile 391 microbe-free digestive systems and they produce all required enzymes for lignocellulose digestion 392 [30, 31, 94] . Significantly, these species have been shown to have endogenous GH7 family enzymes with 393 cellobiohydrolase (beta-1,4-exoglucanase) activity, previously thought to be absent from animal genomes.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, it is likely that GH7 coding genes were acquired by these species via 395 horizontal gene transfer from a protist symbiont.\n\nParhyale is a detrivore that can be sustained on a diet of carrots ( Figure 11C ), suggesting that they too 397 may be able to depolymerize lignocellulose for energy ( Figure 11A and B). We searched for GH family 398 genes in Parhyale using the classification system of the CAZy (Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes) database changes under specific conditions [111] . POs are involved in several biological processes (like the melanization immune response, wound healing and cuticle sclerotization) and we identified 7 PO genes in 464 Parhyale. Interestingly, hemocyanins and PO activity have been shown to be highly abundant together 465 with glycosyl hydrolases in the digestive system of Isopods and Amphipods, raising a potential 466 mechanistic link between gut sterility and degradation of lignocellulose [30, 33] . From a functional genomics perspective, the Parhyale immune system appears to be a good representative 486 of the malacostrocan or even multicrustacean clade that can be studied in detail with existing tools and 487 resources.\n\nmajor small RNA pathways, including 4 argonaute family members, 2 PIWI family members, and 499 orthologs of D. melanogaster Dicer-1 and Dicer-2, drosha and loquacious, (Figure 14 , Supplemental 500 Figure 1 ). Among Argonaute genes, Parhyale has 1 AGO-1 ortholog and 3 AGO-2 orthologs, which is 501 presumably a malacostraca-specific expansion. While Parhyale only has 2 PIWI family members, other 502 crustacean lineages have clearly undergone independent expansions of this protein family. Unlike in C. 503 elegans, many mammals, fish and insects (but not D. melanogaster), we did not find any evidence in the 504 Parhyale genome for the SID-1 (systemic RNA interference defective) transmembrane protein that is 505 essential for systemic RNAi [125] [126] [127] . Species without a SID-1 ortholog can silence genes only in a 506 cell-autonomous manner [128] . This feature has important implications for future design of RNAi 507 experiments in Parhyale. 508 We also assessed the miRNA and putative long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) content of Parhyale using The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

In the Parhyale genome and Hox BAC 538 sequences, we found that mir-10 is also located between Dfd and Src on BAC clone PA179-K23 and 539 scaffold phaw 30.0001203 ( Figure 14, Supplemental Figure 2 ). However, we could not detect mir-iab-4 540 near the Ubx and AbdA genes in Parhyale, the location where it is found in other arthropods/insects [143] .\n\nPreliminary evidence regarding the presence of PIWI proteins and other piRNA pathway proteins also 542 suggests that the piRNA pathway is likely active in Parhyale, although piRNAs themselves await to be 543 surveyed. The opportunity to study these piRNA, miRNA and siRNA pathways in a genetically tractable Figure 15A ). 558 We used genome wide bisulfite sequencing to confirm the presence and also assess the distribution of 559 CpG dinucleotide methylation. Our results indicated that 20-30% of Parhyale DNA is methylated at CpG 560 dinucleotides ( Figure 15B ). The Parhyale methylation pattern is similar to that observed in vertebrates, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/065789 doi: bioRxiv preprint Parhyale has already emerged as a powerful model for developmental genetic research where the 572 expression and function of genes can be studied in the context of stereotyped cellular processes and with 573 a single-cell resolution. Several experimental approaches and standardized resources have been 574 established to study coding and non-coding sequences (Table 1 ). These functional studies will be 575 enhanced by the availability of the assembled and annotated genome presented here. As a first application 576 of these resources, we tested the efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas system for targeted genome editing in 577 Parhyale [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . In these studies, we targeted the Distal-less patterning gene (called PhDll-e) [24] that 578 has a widely-conserved and highly-specific role in animal limb development [154] . 579 We first genotyped our wild-type laboratory culture and found two PhDll-e alleles with 23 SNPs and 1 PhDll-e alleles modified by Cas9 in their germlines. We tested this by genotyping individual G1s from 596 two of these crosses and found that embryos bearing truncated limbs were homozygous for 597 loss-of-function alleles with out-of-frame deletions, while their wild-type siblings carried one The non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair mechanism operating in the injected cells can be 601 exploited not only for gene knock-out experiments described above, but also for CRISPR knock-in 602 approaches where an exogenous DNA molecule is inserted into the targeted locus in a 603 homology-independent manner. This homology-independent approach could be particularly useful for 604 Parhyale that exhibits high levels of heterozygosity and polymorphisms in the targeted laboratory The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Parhyale, like limnoriid 661 Isopods, encodes and expresses all enzymes required for lignocellulose digestion, suggesting that it is 662 able to \"digest wood\" by itself without symbiotic microbial partners. Of course, a lot of work still needs with Malacostraca), we noted the presence of GH7 genes and the absence of PGRP genes in branchiopod 675 and multicrustacean genomes supporting the Vericrustacea hypothesis. It still remains to be proven how 676 reliable these two characters will be to distinguish between these alternative phylogenetic affinities.

Likewise, we expect that 855 For the identification of Dscam in the Parhyale, we used the Dscam protein sequence from crustaceans D. Scientific and thermal cycling was done as the following: 98\u00b0C 30s, followed by 30 cycles of 98\u00b0C 10s, 878 67\u00b0C 30s, 72\u00b0C 1m30s, and then 72\u00b0C 5m. PCR products were cloned into pGEMT-Easy vector and a 879 total of 81 clones were selected and Sanger sequenced and in silico translated in the correct reading frame 880 using Geneious (R7; [173] for multiple sequence alignment.\n\nParhyale non-protein-coding RNAs were identified using two independent approaches. Infernal 1.1.1\n\n[178] was used with the RFAM 12.0 database [130] to scan the genome to identify potential non-coding 884 RNAs. Additionally, MiRPara [129] was used to scan the genome for potential miRNA precursors. These 885 potential precursors were further filtered using small RNA read mapping and miRBase mapping [179] . Parhyale is a direct developer and a sexually dimorphic species. The fertilized egg undergoes stereotyped total cleavages and each blastomere becomes committed to a particular germ layer already at the 8-cell stage depicted in (D). The three macromeres Er, El, and Ep give rise to the anterior right, anterior left, and posterior ectoderm, respectively, while the fourth macromere Mav gives rise to the visceral mesoderm and anterior head somatic mesoderm. Among the 4 micromeres, the mr and ml micromeres give rise to the right and left somatic trunk mesoderm, en gives rise to the endoderm, and g gives rise to the germline.\n\n.
