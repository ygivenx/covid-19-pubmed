{"title": "Awareness of MERS-CoV among Staff Members of Prince Sultan Military Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia", "body": "The coronavirus that causes acute respiratory infection in humans is known as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and was discovered in 2012 [1] .\n\nReports indicate that two-thirds of the infection that effect humans are not related to camels. Kharma and colleagues thus suggested that another species could act as an intermediary to human infection. Since fragments of the human MERS-CoV RNA sequence was isolated in a Taphozous bat [2] , [3] they have since been suspected as a possible source of viral transmission to humans. However, the rare contact between humans and bats implies hypothetically that they are the least responsible for the human infection. For deeper investigation to find the role that bats play as MERS-CoV risk factor of viral transmission, more research is needed [4] .\n\nHuman-to-human transmission is an increasingly public health concern since more than fifty percent of the confirmed secondary cases have been identified within hospitals and healthcare center boundaries [2] . Most of this coronavirus infections reported in Saudi Arabia were transmitted through human interactions within the health center boundaries, that might have been due to inadequate infection control within these areas [5] . symptoms in patients included fever, cough, shortness of breath and gastrointestinal symptoms, associated with a mortality rate of 65% [6] . Most patients infected with MERS-CoV show signs of pneumonia and ARDS, as well as acute kidney injury in some of the cases [9] . Whether the severity of MERS-CoV in patients depends on other conditions is still not clear [10] . One study in Saudi Arabia reported that an overwhelming majority of patients with MERS-CoV had underlying comorbidities [6] . Previous studies suggest that patients with diabetes, chronic lung diseases, renal failure, or immunocompromised are prone to greater risk of severe coronavirus onsets, however, there is little evidence to suggest that such underlying comorbidities contributed to disproportionate infection of MERS-CoV [8] . The WHO estimated the mortality rate of the coronavirus to be approximately 30% [2] , [11] . Currently, the treatment is rather non-specific and there are no recommended antiviral agents [2] . Though, Nitazoxanide which is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug is being tested against influenza and other viral respiratory infections and it exhibited appreciable activity against MERS-CoV and other viruses by inhibiting their N protein expression [12] , [13] . Since human-to-human transmission is said to occur in more than 60% of the total infections, mostly involving medical staffs, inpatients prone to and are at an increased risk of MERS-CoV infection. The WHO suggested that infection in healthcare settings were due to overcrowding and insufficient control measures [14] . Secondly, it would be necessary for the patients to avoid contact with camels or to eat properly cooked camel meat [15] . Sufficient knowledge of the etiology and prevention of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus among healthcare professionals is essential in combating the virus.\n\nSignificant improvement in patients administered with a combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a was seen, in comparison with controls that received only supportive medical care [16] . However, further evaluation of the therapy regimen is required to enable the conclusive use of the therapy in the management of the disease.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/474205 doi: bioRxiv preprint Several preventive measures to control infections in healthcare settings, to expedite management of the disease is essential, such as developing of an emergency department visual triage scores for early detection of the MERS-CoV [17] . It has been shown that the use of triage for early detection of various types of disease had positive outcomes. Earlier studies had speculated this and suggested that it might play major roles in the early detection of this disease [18] , [19] . \n\nThis study is a cross-sectional Study that used a survey to assess the awareness level of MERS-CoV among staff members of Prince Sultan Military Medical city in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A structured questionnaire on the disease was prepared in both English and Arabic, based on a review of the literature and consultation with regional community health teams in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe questionnaire was administered through the various departments in the health city and was distributed through manual approaches. The participants of this study were selected from the whole staff of the medical city, including all groups of staff workers. All participants in this manuscript has given written informed consent, approved by the IRB (Institutional Research Board and Research Ethics Committee) to publish this research study.A total of 570 responses were targeted to increase the reliability and validity of this study.\n\nThe data collected from the participants were entered into SPSS software (version 20) for analysis. A range of descriptive and inferential statistics were carried out to explore the awareness of the staff about MERS-CoV.\n\n.

These data were collected and compiled in tables. In Q3, also the participants could choose more than one to answer 'How did you hear about MERS-COV?', and their answers were in the following order: 'Physician/ health-care worker' had the first and highest (360, 75.5%); 'Internet/social media' was second high (305, 63.9%); next record (290, 60.8%) was 'TV/radio/newspaper'; next (211, 44.2%) was 'Ministry of health pamphlets'; whilst, 'Seminars' and 'Others' were the last and least, with records of (95, 19 .9%) and (15, 3.1%), respectively.\n\nQ4 showed that the majority (256, 53.7%) of participants got the answer 'Wearing a protective mask', regarding the query 'one of the measurements to prevent getting infected by MERS-CoV in the waiting area'. Next, were those who chose (138, 28.9%) the answer 'Avoid touching any surface in waiting rooms'. Whilst, those who chose (53, 11.1%) the answer 'Leaving at least a distance of 2 meters between patients in the waiting area', and (24, 5%) the answer 'Avoid interacting with patients until they are fully recovered' were the last, and there were (6, 1.3%) missing.\n\nQ5 reflects answers of participants to the query 'one of the following might be a symptom of MERS-CoV infection' where a majority (409, 85.7%) of participants gave 'Diarrhea' as an answer. Next, (30, 6.3%) were those who gave 'Fainting spells' as an answer, whilst those who recorded (28, 5.9%) gave the answer 'Nose bleed'. Those who gave 'Constipation' as an answer were the least (6, 1.3%) and 4 (0.8%) were missing. Table 3 reflects the use of protective equipment profile. In Q1, choosing 'The right order to put on personal protective equipment is', a majority (373, 78.2%) chose 'Wash hands, put on gown, put on mask, wear eye protection, put on gloves'. The rest chose 'Wash hands, put on mask, put on gloves, wear eye protection, put on gown' with a record of 50 (10.5%); 'Wash .

In choosing 'The correct order to take off personal protective equipment', the majority (228, 47.8%) chose 'Take off gloves, take off eye protection, take off gown, wash hands'. The rest chose 'Take off gloves, take off gown, wash hands, take off eye protection' with a record of 101 (21.2%); 'Take off gloves, wash hands, take off gown, take off eye protection' with a record of 81 (17.0%); 'Take off gloves, wash hands, take off eye protection, take off gown' with a record of 59 (12.4%); and 8 (1.7%) were missing.

Ratios of different groups of HW characteristics like gender, jobs and educational levels reflected a gradual increase approaching higher learning degrees, with Bachelors as a majority, whilst fresh employees were a majority but, the most experienced (>10 years) were the least in number. This situation of demographic group counts order had been noticed before [23] , [24] .\n\nWith respect to information about the viral diseases, the participants' knowledge regarding basic terminologies like MERS-CoV and viral transmission, the majority got the right answer (Middle east respiratory syndrome). Whilst, the highest score recorded by participants, regarding their multiple choice answer about viral transmission of MERS was the unhygienic .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/474205 doi: bioRxiv preprint spread of coughing and sneezing droplets. Other methods of spread of this virus were also highly appreciated, as has been reported by previous studies [8] .\n\nThe spreading of information about MERs-COV in society by HW was affirmed by the majority, whilst, spreading of information through internet/social and traditional medias like TV, radio and newspapers were of similar, second option. Ministry of health pamphlets and seminars were of less impact, a situation that demands more attention by the ministry of health in this field.\n\nA majority of the participants stated that wearing a protective mask was one of the measurements to prevent getting infected by MERS-CoV in the waiting area. Whilst, the most effective method to deal with this situation was to avoid the patients until they recover. Other options were also found to be useful measurements with less variable grades. Investigators and other workers in this field found these measures also useful [25] .\n\nIn evaluating knowledge about associated signs and symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, a majority of the participants chose 'Diarrhea' as an answer. On this point, the answer with such an appreciable majority, shouldn't be overlooked, without some attention. Diarrhea with fever was said to be one of the symptoms of MERS-CoV infection when people were immunocompromised or organ transplanted, a situation where these patients might not experience the usual route respiratory symptoms [26] .\n\nThe participants got it quite right in dealing with their protective equipment and showing the right order of putting them on, whilst , they were also correct in taking them off. This reflects that participants were very careful in doing the routine steps before entering their duties in epidemics of seriously infected fields; they were also careful when they completed their jobs and abandoning these protective equipment [22] .\n\nAnother challenge for these participants assessing their skills abilities in showing the proper way to wear an n-95 mask, specifically used during MERS-CoV infections.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/474205 doi: bioRxiv preprint with this type of mask, they were correct in choosing the right steps, which reflects their seriousness and carefulness in entering infected zones, but, they were that quite careful in taking it off, as they put this choice as a second step. Whilst, Attention must be paid to this point, as it might reflect some unjustified hastiness practiced by professionals [20] . Also assessment of the participants reflected their high awareness of infection transmission and protection as precautionary steps for having good hand hygiene experience and practice during rush hours and epidemics. Majorly stating the right timing use reflects the strict adherence to hand hygiene which, is an essential and a basic practice and regime in health fields [20] .\n\nIn choosing the correct steps in applying and practicing hand wash, the participants were able to get the highest scores which, meant that they understand and are well aware of correct and full hand wash, infection transmission and protection. Appropriate choices and proper practice preferences in medical and hygienic media and fully correct hand wash policy affirms and guarantees healthiness and safety [2] , [27] .\n\nWith respect to additional preventive methods to avoid getting infected with corona virus, they chose five ones with high records. They adhered to the basic rule of hand washing throughout the day, before and after every action whilst, they also preferred to avoid infected patients and their contaminated belongings, their own eyes, ears and nose and to eat fruits only after thoroughly washing them. It was important to mention to use proper compensatory methods to prevent cross infection when sneezing or coughing. Keeping always clean and avoiding sources of infection is always a hygienic routine that guarantees awareness and gratifies with success in health media [2] .\n\nAttitudes and actions evaluation of the participants towards themselves and towards others reflected high levels of awareness and knowledge. In certain cases of being sick, generally, people commit serious mistakes and decisions, even within the health field workers. Decision to .

Also to have your prescription such as antipyretics over the counter and join work is not at all advisable.\n\nIt is a double hazard and a dangerous behavior, to the patient himself and to his colleagues at the same time. It is an appreciable level of knowledge and good practice that the participants responded correctly to these queries, whilst, few ones might have not understood the rest of queries correctly. With seriously infective viruses such as MERS-CoV, it is mostly crucial to get access to the right treatment and avoid spreading the virus in the vicinity [2] .\n\nDuring serious episodes of community viral infections like MERS-CoV, people should take precautionary steps and build good protective attitudes and actions, towards oneself and towards others in the community. It is quite convincing that participants in the health field have built good and correct awareness to take attitudes of taking lots of fluids, having healthy foods and taking sufficient and beneficial body rest.\n\nWhilst, to help in cutting the vicious circuit of infective body contacts, it is always best attitude towards others to clean hands routinely, use disposable tissues to mask coughing and sneezing, and evade shaking hands. It is highly appreciated that participants in health media should stick to building and adhering to such attitudes [27] .\n\nThe majority of the hospital staff was expatriates and the nursing group was the largest which, Attention must be paid by health professionals to using special protective aids, as dealing with them inappropriately might have reflected some unjustified hastiness practiced by them. Strict adherence of HW to correct hand hygiene experience affirmed and guaranteed healthiness and safety whilst, ideal protective attitudes towards themselves and others represented the firm plateau of awareness they had attained in corona virus combat.\n\nPlease take a few minutes to fill out this survey on your awareness of MERS---Co Virus.
