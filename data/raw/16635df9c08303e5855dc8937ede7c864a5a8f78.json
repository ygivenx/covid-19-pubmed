{"title": "Application of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in veterinary diagnostic virology", "body": "The detection of viral infections may be based on direct or indirect diagnostic methods (Bullock et al., 1991; Lennette, 1992) .\n\nBy direct methods, the virus particles or some of their components, e.g. viral nucleic acids or viral proteins, are detected in the specimens. The most common conventional direct diagnostic methods are the 'gold standard' of virus isolation and also electron microscopy, the detection of viral antigens by antigen-ELISA, the complement-t-Lxation test and the immunofluorescence, immunoperoxidase or peroxidase-immunoperoxidase staining methods. Nucleic acid hybridization is a relatively new detection method that is becoming increasingly popular (Pettersson and Hyypi~i, 1985; Viscidi and Yolken, 1987; Gillespie, 1990; Paul, 1990) .\n\nIndirect methods can be used to demonstrate antiviral antibodies. Virus neutralization, antibody-ELISA and agar-gel immunodiffusion are the most commonly used indirect methods (Bullock et al., 1991) .\n\nIn general, a secure diagnosis can be made by the simultaneous application of direct and indirect methods. However, even when applying both approaches, the diagnosis of certain viral infections is ineffective or too cumbersome; for example, during latent herpesvirus infection, when there is little chance of detecting the virus DNA by conventional diagnostic techniques.\n\nThe development of molecular biology has contributed to the appearance of highly sensitive, new diagnostic approaches. Various DNA recombinant techniques have been applied to the rapid detection of viral nucleic acids, used to study viral genes and also to produce new types of vaccines. DNA molecules are cut and gene structures are mapped by restriction endonuclease cleavage. Ligase enzymes are used to insert the DNA fragments into prokaryotic plasmids or bacteriophage vectors. These vectors can be propagated easily, providing a simple means of producing large quantities of the fragment of interest. The large amount and high purity of the DNA molecules produced by these methods allows further studies, for example the nucleotide sequence determination of viral genes. Knowing the sequences, parts of these genes can be artificially produced by a DNA synthesizer machine. The synthetic molecules can be used for many purposes, e.g. as a component of a new DNA recombinant or as a probe in a nucleic acid hybridization test (Gillespie, 1990) .\n\nRecently, DNA recombinant techniques have been directly applied to diagnosis and vaccine production. Synthetic oligonucleotide probes have been developed to detect a variety of infectious agents, for example, enteroviruses, rhinoviruses or mycoplasmas (Bruce et aL, 1989a,b; Johansson et al., 1992) . Recombinant virus vaccines have been produced to control a number of infectious diseases, for example rabies (Wiktor et aL, 1988) .\n\nIn the last decade various molecular biological methods have been introduced into diagnostic virology, the first of them being the nucleic acid hybridization technique mentioned above. The principle of nucleic acid hybridization is that labelled nucleic acid molecules, usually called probes, bind specifically to stretches of target nucleic acids, in this case to viral nucleic acids in the clinical samples. The nucleic acid sequence of the probe is complementary to the target sequence. Accordingly, the probe will only bind (hybridize) to the target if it contains the appropriate viral nucleic acids. In order to demonstrate the hybridization, the probes are labelled in some fashion, for example with radioactive isotopes or, recently, more often with biotin or digoxigenin (Kricka, 1992; Lennette, 1992) .\n\nThe deployment of various nucleic acid hybridization techniques has considerably increased the arsenal of the diagnostic virologist. The detection of many viral infections, for example that of latent herpesvirus, has become more reliable and more rapid. Various nucleic acid hybridization methods have been demonstrated. These include dotblot, Southern blot, in situ cell and sandwich hybridization. We have recently applied many of these techniques in our laboratory (Bel~ik et al., 1987 (Bel~ik et al., , 1988 (Bel~ik et al., , 1989a Bel~tk and Linn6, 1988) . Important landmarks in the history of DNA diagnosis were the years 1985 and 1987, when the first reports appeared on the polymerase chain reaction method (Saiki et aL, 1985; Mullis and Faloona, 1987) . None of the basic molecular biological techniques that have been developed in the last decade has had a greater impact. Thousands of articles published since 1985 indicate that PCR has been one of the most rapidly adopted techniques in biochemistry. Reports on the application of PCR to the diagnosis of infectious diseases are also accumulating at an exponential rate (Deacon and Lah, 1989; Erlich et aL, 1991; Pershing, 1991) . In addition to PCR, other amplification methods have also recently been developed. These include the transcription amplification system (TAS), the ligase chain reaction (LCRTM), the self-sustained replication (3SR), the Ampliprobe system and the Q-beta replicase method (GiUespie, 1990; Gingeras et aL, 1990; Birkenmeyer and Mushahwar, 1991) .\n\nThe purpose of this review article is to briefly describe the PCR method and then to summarize its applications to veterinary diagnostic virology.\n\nThe polymerase chain reaction is a method used for the in vitro amplification of selected target DNA molecules, resulting in a several-million-fold amplification of the target sequence within a few hours. These large amounts of PCR products can then easily be detected and identified (Saiki et aL, 1985; Mullis and Faloona, 1987; Erlich et aL, 1991) .\n\nSpecimens. For viral diagnosis, homogenized organs, mucosal cells collected with swabs or separated leukocytes are the most common specimens. For example, acute Aujeszky's disease (pseudorabies) of pigs is diagnosed in our laboratory by PCR amplification of nasal cells and organ homogenates. The latent infections are detected by testing homogenates of trigeminal ganglia, tonsils and brain (Behik et al., 1989b) . Bovine viral diarrhoea virus infection is diagnosed by PCR amplification of organ homogenates (acute disease) or serum specimens (persistent infection). From such specimens, the PCR is able to amplify a few viral nucleic acid molecules amidst a high background of host DNA and RNA.\n\nBefore running the PCR, the specimens are prepared for amplification. When seeking DNA viruses, one can purify the specimen DNA prior to amplification, but recent publications demonstrate that good amplification results can be achieved even from unpurified, crude specimens (Bel~ik et al., 1989b; Ballagi-Por&iny et al., 1990 . In the case of RNA viruses, the viral RNA has to be purified and transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) before starting the PCR.\n\nPrimer molecules. The primers are artificially synthesized short (17 to 40 nucleotides long) oligonucleotide molecules that flank the sequence to be amplified (< 100 to 2000 bases) and are complementary to opposite strands of the target. The primers are able to find their target in the reaction mixture and specifically anneal to it.\n\nDNA polyrnerase enzyme. The initial PCR studies utilized the thermosensitive Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I to synthesize the DNA (Saiki et aL, 1985; Mullis and Faloona, 1987) . Since this enzyme was inactivated after each amplification step of the PCR (see below), each cycle required the opening of the reaction tube and addition of fresh enzyme. This tedious step was eliminated by the introduction of a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme, TaqDNA polymerase, isolated from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus. Since this enzyme is not inactivated by heat, it is not necessary to open the reaction tubes between the amplification cycles, which allows execution of the PCR without interruption. Thus, the use of TaqDNA polymerase permits automation of the PCR, in addition to decreasing the risk of contamination.\n\nDeoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). The four free dNTPs (dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP) are the building blocks for the new DNA strands.\n\nReaction buffers. Various buffers and inorganic ions aid the PCR, e.g. KC1 promotes the Taq polymerase activity and free magnesium ions are essential for its function.\n\nDNA thermocycler machines, laminar flow cabinets, and electrophoresis and hybridization equipment are the main accessories of a PCR laboratory. Many laboratories use specific PCR tube holders and tube openers, as well as specific micropipette tips in order to prevent cross-contamhlation and carryover of specimens (Gingeras et al., 1990; Belfik and Ballagi-Pordhny, 1993) .\n\nThe components of the PCR, described above, are mixed in reaction tubes. The mixtures are covered with mineral oil or wax to avoid evaporation and the tubes are placed into the thermoblock of a DNA thermocycler machine. The thermoblock is controlled by a microprocessor in order to increase and to decrease the temperature rapidly, in accordance with a preselected program.\n\nThe PCR is run by repeated cycles of heating and cooling. Each cycle consists of three steps: denaturating double-stranded (ds) DNA, annealing primers to the now single-stranded (ss) DNA template; and extending nascent strands using Taq polymerase enzyme ( Figure 1 ). The principles of the steps are as follows:\n\n1. Denaturating. The reaction mixtures are heated to approximately 90-95\u00b0C. At this temperature the ds DNA is denatured, i.e. the double-stranded molecules are separated to form single strands.\n\n2. Primer-annealing. The temperature of the thermoblock is programmed to a predetermined value between 37~C and 70\u00b0C to allow specific annealing between the primers and the single strands of the target DNA. A temperature is selected that allows only specific annealing (by base pairing) between exact matches of primer and target sequences and does not allow non-specific annealing to other sequences. The optimal annealing temperature mainly depends on the length and on the guanine/ cytosine (GC) content of the primers; accordingly it is empirically determined for each primer pair.\n\nThe temperature is increased to between 67\u00b0C and 72\u00b0C. At this temperature Taq polymerase extends the primers by using each single-stranded target as a template for the construction of a complete complementary strand. This results in duplication of both original DNA strands. One PCR cycle is completed within 3-5 min.\n\nRepeating the cycles. On completing the t'n'st cycle, the thermoblock is heated up again and begins the second round of amplification. In this cycle the double strands will separate and serve yet again as templates for new DNA synthesis. Accordingly, each PCR cycle results in the duplication of the DNA target (see above). If the number of cycles is n, then the amplification results in a 2 n exponential increase in DNA. By performing 25 to 30 cycles, a 33.6-million-fold amplification of the target could theoretically by achieved within 3 h. However, due to decrease of enzyme activity and other factors, one cannot expect more than an approximately 106-fold amplification of the target in a single PCR assay. Double PCR with nested primers. When compared to single PCR, a further increase of the DNA yield can be achieved when double PCR is run with nested primers. In this case, a first PCR is run for some 20-25 cycles by using two external primers.\n\nSubsequently, a small amount of the first PCR product is transferred into a fresh amplification tube containing two internal primers. The second PCR is run for a further 20-35 cycles. The internal primers are closer to each other on the DNA strand and therefore produce a shorter second PCR product. Double PCR has an amplification ability of approximately 1011-1012 , and is thus much more sensitive than the single reaction.\n\nIn order to compare the sensitivity of the two assays, both single and double PCR tests were constructed in our laboratory to diagnose various animal diseases (Bel~ik et aL, 1989b; Ballagi-Pord~ny et aL, 1990 BelLk and Ballagi-Pordgmy, 1991) . To take pseudorabies virus as an example, we found that the specimens had to contain at least 104 virus particles/mg tissue to yield a positive result in the single PCR. In contrast, the double PCR assay detected as few as 10 to 50 genome copies of the viral DNA/mg tissue.\n\nBy using double PCR, not only the sensitivity but also the specificity of the assay is increased. The reason for this is that, in double PCR, all four primers have to fmd specific nucleic acid regions, instead of just the two.\n\nVisualization of the PCR products. A frequently mentioned statement regarding the amplification rate of PCR is that 'the PCR finds a needle in a haystack and then produces a stack of needles' (DeMarchi, 1990) . This principle indicates that, by running a PCR, a large number of copies are produced from a minimal amount of target DNA. The large quantities of the PCR products (so-called amplicons) can easily be identified by various methods.\n\n(1)\n\nThe characteristic size of the product can be determined by electrophoresis and ethidium bromide (EtBr) staining.\n\nThe nucleotide sequence of the product can be identified by nucleic acid hybridization (gene probes).\n\nThe product can be identified by simple colorimetric methods, e.g. the DIANA (detect immobilized amplified nucleic acids; Wahlberg et al., 1990) or the CODAF (colorimetric detection of amplicons on filter; Bekik and Ballagi-Pord~iny, 1993) procedures.\n\nThe PCR products are rapidly identified by these methods, since the results can be read within an hour (electrophoresis, CODAF) or at most several hours (hybridization, DIANA). However, when the methods are compared, nucleic acid hybridization appears to be the most specific technique available for the identification of PCR amplicons (Bel~ik and Ballagi-Pord~ny, 1993).\n\nIf the diagnostic applicability of the PCR is compared to that of nucleic acid hybridization, one important difference is immediately evident. The nucleic acid hybridization test at best detects only that amount of viral nucleic acids that accumulated in the examined specimens during the viral infection. In certain infections the amount of such nucleic acids may be very low and, since the hybridization technique does not amplify its target, it frequently fails to detect these cases. In contrast, the PCR method amplifies its target and therefore detects even very low numbers of viral nucleic acid molecules in the specimens.\n\nOwing to this unique ability, the PCR has been accepted as a common method in medical diagnostic work. This is quite a remarkable achievement for a technique first reported in 1985.\n\nIn human medicine the PCR has been applied to the diagnosis of many viral diseases, including herpesviral, papillomaviral and retroviral infections (Eisenstein, 1990; Gingeras et aL, 1990; Coutl6e et aL, 1991) .\n\nThe system of patenting and the costs of the test are the most common questions concerning the application of the PCR for routine diagnosis. The aim of this article is not to discuss these in detail, but the following is a brief summary of the present situation. The Perkin-Elmer Cetus company, the original owner of the PCR patent, sold the rights to F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. Subsequently, the new owner expanded the patent rights to Europe. However, customers purchasing commercial PCR diagnostic kits do not have to deal with patent questions, since these are arranged between the owner of the patent and the producer of the commercial kits.\n\nThere is a general opinion around the world that the costs of the PCR are extremely high. However, owing to the introduction of inexpensive preparations of Taq polymerase enzyme, these costs have markedly decreased in the last years. In our laboratory the PCR is run as a routine diagnostic procedure to detect 12 viral diseases of domestic animals and we have run several thousand PCR procedures in the last three years. Our experience is that the costs of PCR diagnosis are lower than those of conventional virus isolation.\n\nThe first reports of the use of the PCR in veterinary diagnostic practice appeared in the late 1980s (for example Bel~ik et al., 1989b; Deacon and Lab, 1989; Gould et al., 1989; Nunberg et al., 1989) . PCR diagnosis of many animal viral diseases followed rapidly. The technique seemed to be especially applicable where traditional diagnostic methods required long and complex culturing procedures or intricate processing, for example in co-cultivation or in electron microscopy (Deacon and Lab, 1989) . In the following section we consider several diseases as examples to indicate the importance of the PCR as a new and powerful diagnostic method in veterinary virology.\n\nThe pseudorabies virus may establish latent infection in swine following a primary acute infection. The latently infected animals are symptomless and do not shed virus. However, virus can periodically be reactivated from these carriers, spreading to susceptible animals and causing new outbreaks. Thus, the presence of latently infected pigs may hinder the control of the disease and the completion of eradication programmes.\n\nThe acute form of the disease is easily diagnosed by conventional virus isolation. However, there are no practical and sensitive conventional methods for detecting the latent cases. After the acute infection disappears and latency has been established, infectious virus is difficult to detect by standard techniques. Viral DNA molecules persist in several organs of the pigs, including the trigeminal ganglia and tonsils. To detect latency, one can try to apply explant cultures, co-cultivation or nucleic acid hybridization techniques. Co-cultivation is rather cumbersome and slow, and its sensitivity is uncertain. Nucleic acid hybridization is more rapid but, as mentioned above, this method may also face problems of low sensitivity. In latent cases the number of ganglia and tonsil cells that harbour viral DNA may be very low (~< 1%) and these cells frequently contain such a low copy number of viral DNA molecules that it remains below the detection level of the nucleic acid hybridization tests.\n\nOwing to its capacity to amplify the target, the PCR proved to be a practical method for detecting latent cases of Aujeszky's disease. Diagnostic PCR assays have been developed, in Sweden (Bel~ik et al., 1989b) , in France (Jestin et aL, 1990) , in the USA (Maes et al., 1990; Lokensgard et al., 1991; Wheeler and Osorio, 1991; Dangler et aL, 1992; Volz et al., 1992) , and in Taiwan (Chang, 1991) . These assays selected in the first instance the glI, the gp50, the gX or the TK (thymidine kinase) gene regions of the viral DNA as amplification targets.\n\nSeveral groups are working on the simultaneous application of two PCR assays, which will amplify essential (e.g. glI) and non-essential (e.g. gI or TK) regions of the viral genome. In countries that use deletion mutants as live vaccines (such as gI-or TK-mutants), genetic recombinations between field strains and vaccine strains may cause confusion in the diagnosis of Aujeszky's disease. The circulation of these recombinant viruses potentially hinders eradication efforts. PCR assays have been developed to define the genotypic status of virus isolates with regard to the presence or absence of deletions. These PCR assays will determine whether normal pseudorabies virus vaccine usage can lead to the development of such genotypic recombinants (Dangler et al., 1992) .\n\nA further practical application of PCR will be to determine the infectious status of the so-called single reactor pigs. During eradication programmes the serological surveys occasionally detect a single positive pig in a herd. This animal is referred to as single reactor. The seropositive status of single reactors may be due to previous vaccination against Aujeszky's disease, exposure to a field strain of the virus, or possibly to a false positive reaction in the serological assay (Annelli et al., 1991) . A common assumption is that the single reactors are false positives, but successful isolation of the virus from immunosuppressed single reactors indicated that in certain cases this assumption is incorrect and that some of the single reactors are seropositive due to a latent PRV infection. To assess the infection status of single reactors by classical means requires the cumbersome and expensive method of immunosuppression followed by virus isolation attempts. We have found that latent PRV infection in single reactors can be safely detected by the PCR method. Moreover, an accurate diagnosis can be obtained within 24 h.\n\nBovine leukaemia provides another example of the application of the PCR to veterinary diagnostic virology. Bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis. At present, indirect (serological) detection methods (most commonly agar-gel immunodiffusion and various ELISA methods) are used for the diagnosis of BLV infection. These methods are easy to perform and they are excellent tools for estimating the prevalence of BLV infection in a herd. However, in individual cases serology may yield false negative results (Rogers et aL, 1988) . The serological tests may also fail to detect antibodies in early stages of infection (Florent, 1988) or in animals persistently infected with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV; Roberts et al., 1988) . Furthermore, these tests are of no value for diagnosis of BLV in young calves born from infected cows. By suckling colostrum, these calves receive antibodies from their dams and the serological tests cannot differentiate this passive immunity from the active immunity which develops after infection. Serology should therefore be reconsidered as the exclusive method for assessing BLV infection.\n\nAs a complement to serological techniques, direct diagnostic methods should be applied to obtain a reliable BLV diagnosis, but the conventional direct detection techniques, e.g. in vitro cultivation of lymphocytes with or without stimulation, electron microscopy and inoculation of sheep, are expensive, laborious and/or require special facilities. The time required for diagnosis may extend to weeks or even to several months.\n\nPCR assays have been developed to detect BLV in clinical specimens in Australia (Naif et al., 1990 (Naif et al., , 1992 Brandon et al., 1991) , in the USA Sherman et al., 1992) and in Sweden (Ballagi-Pord~ny et al., 1992) . The majority of the BLV PCR systems are based on the demonstration of the proviral DNA in blood leukocytes. Some of these methods can provide a safe diagnosis within 24 h (Ballagi-Pord~ny et aL, 1992) .\n\nBVDV can also be regarded as an important candidate for PCR diagnosis. This virus is one of the most important pathogens of cattle, causing economic losses of considerable importance throughout the world. Propagation of BVDV in cell cultures allows the differentiation of cytopathic and non-cytopathic biotypes (cp-BVDV and noncp-BVDV). Both biotypes are pathogenic for cattle, causing two disease entities. Acute bovine diarrhoea is characterized by high morbidity and low mortality, whereas the acute or chronic mucosal disease is manifested by low morbidity and high mortality. Both entities have suggestive clinical signs and lesions.\n\nThe virus is frequently excreted by persistently infected animals. These are the offspring of cows in which, after a primary infection, transplacental spread occurred during pregnancy. The in utero infection may result in abortion or stillbirth, in malformation of the fetus or in immunotolerance. The calves, born with immunotolerance, carry a persistent, latent infection throughout their life. These animals are virus carriers and excretors but are usually seronegative. After a recurrent infection they may develop mucosal disease.\n\nOwing to in utero infection, BVDV is a frequent contaminant of fetal calf serum used in cell culture work. This may lead to BVDV contamination of biological products, such as vaccines and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThere is a great need for sensitive and rapid methods for detecting BVDV in various specimens. Conventional diagnosis is based on the direct demonstration of the virus in clinical specimens (virus isolation, immunohistochemistry) or on indirect detection of infection by assessment of the specific antibody response. These methods are either insensitive, time-consuming or unsuitable for large-scale screening. For example, the conventional virus isolation method encounters difficulties in maintaining cell cultures free of BVDV, it requires a long time and high costs to detect the virus. The non-cytopathic BVDV variants may require two or three passages before detectable amounts of viral antigens accumulate in the cell cultures. Another problem of virus isolation is that it frequently fails to detect the virus in toxic specimens, such as semen. In such cases the cells are destroyed before propagation of the virus occurs.\n\nPCR detection of the virus proved to be a specific, rapid and highly sensitive method of diagnosis and an improvement over the existing technology (Schroeder and Balassu-Chan, 1990; Bel~ik and Ballagi-Pord~iny, 1991; Boye et al., 1991; Brock, 1991; Lopez et al., 1991; Hertig et al., 1991; Roehe and Woodward, 1991; Ward and Misra, 1991; Hooft van Iddekinge et aL, 1992) .\n\nThe articles available today on the application of PCR in veterinary diagnostic virology are listed in Tables I and II . However, with a large subject such as PCR diagnosis some authors providing significant contributions in this field may unfortunately and inadvertently have been omitted. Articles in which PCR is used to achieve other scientific aims, such as genetic or gene expression studies and the characterization of DNA regions, are not included. Articles concerned with PCR in relation to the diseases of laboratory animals are also excluded, but this group will be discussed in a later paper.\n\nThe lists presented are intended to contribute to the introduction of PCR assays in routine diagnostic veterinary virology laboratories.\n\nIt should be noted that, despite the enthusiasm surrounding this technique, PCR is routinely performed as a clinical service in only a few laboratories. The 'Achilles heel' of this technique is its extreme sensitivity, which can result in nonspecific positive results. The reason for this is that instruments, air or solutions may carry over minute amounts of amplified DNA fragments, which can serve as PCR templates. These forms of contamination will lead to the generation of false positives and confusing results that may hamper the introduction of this new technique into routine diagnostics. The risk of cross-contamination is extremely high when a very sensitive double PCR with nested primers is undertaken.\n\nDouble PCR assays have been established in our laboratory for the detection of several important animal viruses, such as pseudorabies virus, equine herpesviruses (EHV-1 and 4), bovine leukaemia virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, equine arteritis virus and feline coronaviruses. During the developmental stage of these PCR assays, many technical problems, such as PCR product carryovers and sample crosscontaminations, hindered the introduction of PCR as a routine diagnostic method. By constructing special tube-holders and tube openers and also by applying a simple technique of pipetting, such false positive results were eliminated. Simple methods have been applied to visualize and identify the PCR products. The details of procedures designed to eliminate carryovers and simple visualization procedures are described by Bel,~k and Ballagi-Pord~my (1993). Todd et al.

Thus, kits are available from S V A N O V A Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden) for the P C R diagnosis of Aujeszky's disease of pigs (pseudorabies), diseases of horses caused by equine herpesvirus types 1 and 4, bovine leukaemia and bovine viral diarrhoea/mucosal disease. No doubt, other companies will soon be providing similar complete P C R diagnostic systems.\n\nC O N C L U S I O N W e believe that the methods and tools developed in the last few years will enhance the acceptance of the PCR technique as a reliable complement to conventional diagnostic methods in the routine diagnostic laboratories.\n\nThanks are due to Dr Paul Lowings for critical reading of the manuscript and for his valuable comments."}
