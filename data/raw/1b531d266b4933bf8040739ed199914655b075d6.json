Epidemiology evidence shown that most of the cases had a 39 history of living or travelling to Wuhan, the household cluster cases and cases of 40 health-care workers indicated the human-to-human transmission route (3), which 41 might be the reason for a rapid increasing rate of infection across the country and 42 globally (4). 43\n\nConsidering the person-to-person transmission and the large travel volume during 44 the traditional Chinese New Year (the largest annual population movement in the 45 world), it is expected that the population movement would lead to further expansion 46 of the infection, so the government imposed a lockdown on Wuhan City at 10:00 am 47 on January 23, as well as some other cities later on. However, an estimated 5 million 48 individuals had already left Wuhan for the holiday or travelling, some of which rushed 49 out after the lockdown announcement (5). In addition, the novel coronavirus is 50 infectious during the incubation period and when the symptoms are not obvious, 51 which is likely to make the huge floating population potential sources of infection (6). 52 Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the population transported from Wuhan 53 may have a significant impact on the potential outbreaks in other parts of China. 54 Recent studies on the novel coronavirus pneumonia focused more on its etiology (7, 55 8), transmission route (9, 10), and epidemiological characteristics (11, 12), there is 56 still a lack of investigating the relationship between the migrating population and the 57 outbreak, which is of great importance for making intervention policies. Thus, we 58 conducted this study with the following objectives: 1) to depict the impacts of the 59 .

And then we 108 calculated the average proportion of the outflow index from Jan 24 to 31 for each 109 province (the average proportion). The number of cases reduced by the advance city 110 closure in each province was estimated by multiplied the advance outflow index by 111 the average proportion and one corresponding unit. The formula can be specified as: 112\n\nThe reduced index of outflow population: \n\nThe net loss index of outflow population caused by advance Wuhan city closure for 124 each province: 125\n\nThe total reduced number of 2019-nCoV cases: 127\n\nSimilarly, we evaluated the impacts of one-day and two-day delayed city closure. We 129 took the average index of the population outflow between Jan 21 and 23 as the daily 130 index of population outflow before the city closure, and used the same calculation 131 method to estimate the index of population outflow within Wuhan increased by the 132 delayed city closure on Jan 24 and Jan 25 (the delayed outflow index). We multiplied 133 the delayed outflow index by the average proportion and one corresponding unit to 134 estimate the increased number of cases caused by one-day and two-day delayed city 135 closure in each province. Our study provided timely evidence for the formulation of efficient strategies to 253 prevent diseases from spreading out. On the one hand, the result could help assess 254 effectiveness of the prevention and control efforts. For example, the cases in Zhejiang 255 and Guangdong are apparently more than estimated, which indicated a better health 256 emergency response system (i.e. higher detection efficiency) or inadequate isolation. 257\n\nWhereas the cases reported in Henan were much lower than expected.

In addition, to explore the impact of date selection, 282\n\nwe estimated the changes of cases when the measure was implemented on different 283 date. The results varied significantly, 1420 cases could be prevented with the measure 284 implemented two days earlier, and the number of cases will increase by 1462 with the 285 lockdown implemented two days later, suggesting that the effect of the lockdown 286 depending on the choice of date greatly, which could provide a reference for the 287 future outbreaks. Since the political and economic effects were not considered, further 288 studies on secondary impacts of the measure, like socioeconomic impacts, were also 289 warranted. Though we estimated that some cases would possibly be prevented if the 290 policy was implemented earlier, it was actually hard to make such a huge decision 291\n\ngiven the whole picture of the infection was not clear at that stage. The authors 292 believe that the current policy was appropriate at this complex situation. 293\n\nThere were a few limitations of our study. Firstly, for practical reasons, we used 294 an indicator to reflect the real-time magnitude of population movements, which was 295 acceptable considering our research purpose. Secondly, the influence of some 296 important factors, such as socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, were not 297 considered. Thirdly, it is assumed that the infected travelers in the population are 298 randomly distributed (28), and that there was no significant difference in surveillance 299 capability between cities (18), which might not be the case in reality. In addition, 300 daily data used in this study was reported infection data, rather than the actual number 301 of incident cases. More detailed and further in-depth studies are warranted in the 302 .

The magnitude of epidemic might be under-estimated and 307 should be paid more attention, such as Henan and Hunan provinces. 308 309"}
