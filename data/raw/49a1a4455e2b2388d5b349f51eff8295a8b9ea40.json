{"title": "THE EFFICACY OF BIOENGINEERED ANTI-TOXINS AND VACCINES FOR ANIMAL HEALTH CARE", "body": "One of the major and earliest means by which recombinant DNA and hybridoma technologies will benefit mankind will be to improve animal production by reducing morbidity and mortality from infectious disease by providing the animal health care industry with efficacious vaccines and antitoxins. Of the 45 million cattle born last year in the United States, approximately 7% died of infectious disease (1) . Similarly, of the 94 million swine born approximately 15% died of infectious disease. These losses occurred despite the use of conventional vaccines, large amounts of antibiotics, and other medicinals. Since antibiotic treatment does not represent an effective means of reducing the severity of disease caused by viruses, many virus-induced diseases go unchecked because of either the unavailability of appropriate vaccines or the availability of ineffective vaccines. Recombinant DNA procedures will enable the development of vaccines for viruses which grow poorly, or not at all, in cell culture and for which there are therefore presently none available. Moreover, a genetically engineered subunit vaccine should not only exhibit the features of potency and efficacy, if correctly designed, but also safety and stability at ambient temperatures, as well. Immunologically, the genetically-engineered vaccine must be developed in such a fashion as to be administered in a single dose and induce immunity of long duration. It must protect against as many serotypes of a virus in a given geographic region as possible and must not induce adverse reactions. In addition to these biological features, a genetically-engineered vaccine will exhibit several attractive manufacturing considerations including ease of manufacturing, economy of production, and long shelf life.\n\nWe have employed recombinant DNA technologies to generate large amounts of viral surface antigens that induce neutralizing antibodies against members of the papillomavirus, picornavirus, parvovirus, and herpesvirus groups of animal viruses. Based upon preliminary pre-clinical and clinical testing of several of these genetically-engineered subunit vaccines, it is apparent that these reagents are excellent immunogens exhibiting many of the features described above. In this report we present the overall method of cloning and expressing surface antigen genes from several viruses that are responsible for veterinary disease syndromes, as well as data concerning their potential as useful immunogens.\n\nIn addition to the use of recombinant DNA technology to generate veterinary vaccines we have also utilized hybridoma technology (2) to generate useful monoclonal antibodies. Of particular interest to veterinary medicine are therapeutic applications of monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization against certain infectious diseases. In our survey of veterinary infectious diseases, we have identified several syndromes in which treatment would best be accomplished by passive immunization employing monoclonal antibodies. For one of these disease syndromes, namely, E. coli-induced neonatal diarrhea or scours, both conventional and genetically-engineered vaccines are available, however, a therapeutic approach involving a passive immunization program employing monoclonal antibodies appears to be far superior to vaccination as the preferred method of preventing the disease. Results from clinical testing summarized herein and presented in detail elsewhere (3) indicate that use of such monoclonal antibodies does indeed represent a highly efficacious method of curtailing scours in calves and pigs, and obviate the need for a costly vaccination program thereby easing the burden of managing farm animals.\n\nScours is a form of neonatal diarrhea in calves and swine caused by enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli. These particular organisms produce disease through colonization of the gut employing the strain K99 pilus antigen,which is the major adherence factor found on enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli,and subsequent production of enterotoxins which cause diarrhea by villous hypersecretion (4). Since colonization is considered an essential step in the pathogenesis of enterotoxigenic colibacillosis, the strategy of blocking bacterial adherence in the small intestine by passive immunization employing monoclonal antibody specific to the pilus antigen should in theory reduce the severity of the disease. Several previous studies in fact lend support to this particular approach. First, newborn calves challenged with K99 strains of E. coli were protected from fatal diarrhea if they were permitted to ingest the colostrum of cows previously vaccinated with purified K99 pilus antigen (5) . Second, several vaccine trials using a variety of K99 pilus-containing preparations including whole bacterins and crude extracts also demonstrated that passive antibody against the K99 phi of E. coli would prevent severe or fatal diarrhea (6, 7) . In all of these studies, passive antibody reached the intestines of suckling calves through the colostrum of dams vaccinated prior to parturition.\n\nSeveral commercial vaccines have become available as a result of these studies and are being used with apparent success. However, there are some recognizable disadvantages to these vaccines. First, pregnant cows must be handled for vaccination twice the first year and once each subsequent year of the vaccination program. Livestock owners are reluctant to accept the cost and inconvenience of preventive vaccination unless they have recently experienced an outbreak of neonatal colibacillosis in their herds. Such outbreaks are difficult to predict since the epizootiology of calf scours includes a variety of management and environmental factors. These concerns prompted investigation of an alternative method for direct passive immunization of newborn calves, namely the oral administration of K99-specific monoclonal antibody to calves at birth.\n\nMonoclonal Antibody. The basic hybridoma technology used in preparation of the K99-specific monoclonal antibody employed in these studies has been described elsewhere (2) . Balb/C mice were immunized by subcutaneous injection of purified K99 pilus antigen in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by an intravenous booster. Shortly after the booster, splenic lymphocytes were isolated and fused to mouse plasmacytoma FIGURE 1. Immunoprecipitation of radio-labeled purified K99 pilus by monoclonal antibody. Several enterotoxingenic (B44 , B41) and nonpathogenic (1751, 1676) strains of E. coli were labeled with 35 S-methionine,disrupted,and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody that exhibited agglutination activity with K99 E. coli. The immunoprecipitated K99 pilus antigen was then analyzed on a polyacrylamide gel. Arrow indicates position of K99 pilus antigen. cells (P3-NSl-AG4-1) which are deficient for the enzyme hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase. Resulting hybridomas were selected in HAT medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine. Supernatants from hybridomas were screened for K99-reactive antibody by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using K99 pilus as the antigen. Single hybridoma cell lines producing large amounts of K99-specific monoclonal antibody were isolated by limiting dilution analysis and screening by ELISA. K99-specific hybridomas were injected intraperitoneally into preconditioned specific pathogen free Balb/C mice and ascites fluid collected 10-30 days later.\n\nCharacterization of the monoclonal antibody was performed by several techniques including ELISA, immunoprecipitation and agglutination. The antibody was defined as mouse IgG1 by ELISA using rabbit isotype specific reagents. The antibody, isolated and purified from ascites fluid, will agglutinate K99 strains of E. coli at dilutions of 1:6000 to 1:12000. Moreover, the K99 monoclonal antibody appears to be groupspecific since it agglutinates over 100 different sub-types of K99 E. coli. When the bacteria were grown at 18\u00b0C instead of 37 0 C, no agglutination activity was observed indicating monospecificity for the K99 pilus antigen which is not elaborated at the lower incubation temperature. Specificity of the monoclonal antibody for the K99 pilus was directly demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of the purified pilus followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (FIGURE 1). Competitive RIA employing radio-labeled K99 monoclonal antibody further demonstrates the specific-reactivity of this reagent with the pilus antigen.\n\n2. Clinical Testing of K99-Specific Monoclonal Antibody. Since calves are most susceptible to E. coli infection during the first day of life, a protocol of treatment and challenge within the first 12 hours of age was chosen in order to rigorously test the effectiveness of oral monoclonal antibody delivery for protection against colibacillosis.\n\nOral administration of K99-specific monoclonal antibody significantly reduced mortality in calves challenged with fatal doses of enterotoxigenic E. coli in three clinical trials performed to date. Since the three trials were carried out in different locations and employed different protocols, it was of interest to evaluate the relationship of calf survival to both treatment effect and experimental location or protocol. A three-dimensional analysis of the results of the three trials was performed using log linear regression. The three variables evaluated were antibody administration, calf survival, and experimental location. A model which showed calf survival to be dependent on antibody administration only and independent of experimental location showed the best goodness of fit (Chi squared = 5.9, 6 degrees of freedom). The summary of results from all three trials is shown in TABLE 1.\n\nA reduction in the severity of clinical symptoms was seen in treated calves along with the reduction in mortality. In trials where calves were weighed periodically, treated calves had substantially lower weight losses than untreated calves during the clinical evaluation period. In one of the trials, the K99-specific monoclonal antibody reduced mortality irrespective of when it was given: before, during, or immediately after, E. coli challenge.\n\nSince strains of K99-E. coli cause a similar disease in swine the K99-specific monoclonal antibody was tested in these animals as well. When newborn piglets were treated with K99monoclonal antibody a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity was observed (TABLE 2) . In pigs, however, two additional pathogenic strains of E. coli have been found to contribute to this disease syndrome, strains K88 and 987R. In an attempt to ensure that scours is rigorously controlled in swine, we have therefore generated monoclonal antibodies to these strains as well. These additional monoclonal antibodies are currently undergoing clinical testing to determine their effectiveness as therapeutic reagents for controlling this disease in newborn pigs.\n\nA number of important veterinary infectious diseases are caused by viruses. Due to the unavailability of certain vaccines and the poor efficacy of yet others, calves, swine, horses and poultry continue to be plagued by these infectious agents resulting in either death or illnesses which contribute substantial losses to the farmer. In an attempt to reduce these losses we have employed recombinant DNA approaches to generate new, more effective vaccines against a variety of viruses including members of the pap illomavirus, parvovirus, herpesvirus, togavirus, bunyavirus, and coronavirus groups of animal viruses. Rather than to describe the specific methods of cloning and assessing the relative potency of surface antigens from each of these species, we will describe the overall general methods employed in these studies citing examples from several different groups.\n\nThe basic protocol for developing genetically-engineered vaccines includes: l)identification of the major viral surface antigen which will induce antibody capable of neutralizing or inactivating the infectious organism; 2) identification of the surface antigen gene or the specific antigenic determinants contained within the gene; and, 3) isolation and transfer of this gene into a plasmid vector capable of expressing large amounts of its product in fermentable organisms such as bacteria or yeast. The approach to identifying and isolating a surface antigen determinant from a DNA virus and an RIA virus differ slightly. For example, the location of the surface antigen gene on a DNA virus can be determined by a variety of methods involving genetic or biochemical approaches. One of the more conventional genetic approaches involves the generation of mutations in the viral genome and the analysis of mutant viruses for structural alterations in the surface antigen component, whereas a standard biochemical approach involves either selection of viral mRNA followed by translation in cell-free systems to determine the specific mRNA species that codes for the surface antigen of interest, or coupled in vitro transcription/translation of various restriction endonuclease fragments of the viral DNA. For PIA viruses, the viral genome is generally reverse transcribed into a DNA copy prior to molecular cloning. In some instances, the surface antigen gene can be isolated during this step by synthesis of specific oligonucleotides representing sequences of the surface antigen derived from amino acid sequencing of the amino and carboxyl end of the surface antigen purified from the virus capsid. These synthetic oligonucleotides are then employed as primers for copying only the surface antigen gene into DNA by the enzyme reverse transcriptase. The surface antigen gene is then spliced into a plasmid vector created specifically to enable expression of the surface antigen in microorganisms such as E. coli. We have also found that creating gene fusions between the viral surface antigen gene and certain prokaryotic or eukaryotic genes appears to offer distinct advantages over the surface antigen itself in certain instances. These advantages include: 1) stabilization of the surface antigen gene product in bacteria; 2) increase immunogenicity of the surface antigen by prohibiting folding of the protein which may otherwise hide or mask the specific antigenic determinants required for generating neutralizing antibody; and, 3) possible immunological enhancement or adjuvant effect due to the presence of the additional nucleotide sequences adjacent to the surface antigen gene. The fused or chimeric genes may also actually help to identify bacteria colonies that are expressing high levels of the surface antigen, particularly if the fusion protein exhibits enzymatic activity for which an assay can readily be established. For one such enzyme, -galactosidase, we have designed cloning vectors and developed a cloning procedure that facilitates the identification of bacteria expressing high levels of the surface antigen, or specific fragments of the surface antigen containing the necessary antigenic determinants required for neutralization, by virtue of high levels of the -galactosidase activity present (FIGURE 2). This procedure has the added feature of eliminating the need to locate and isolate the surface antigen gene on the virus genome since it enables one;f irst,to molecularly clone random fragments of the entire viral genome; second, to select for those bacteria colonies expressing high levels of the viral gene-b-galactosidase fusion protein; and, finally, to utilize neutralizing antibodies to identify colonies that are producing antigens containing the desired antigenic determinants. The vectors designed for this procedure are unable to express -galactosidase activity without a viral DNA fragment inserted, as the amino-terminal portion of the coding region (5' to the cloning site) is out of phase with respect to the carboxy-terminal portion (3' to the cloning site) . Insertion of a DNA fragment of the proper number of nucleotides into the cloning site in the proper translational reading phase with the amino terminal portion, allows translation of the carboxy-terminal portion in phase, and synthesis of a hybrid gene protein which exhibits bgalactosidase activity. Such clones can be identified on certain indicator plates, e.g. Maconkey-lactose or X-G, and screened for the production of the desired antigenic determinants using viral-specific antiserum.\n\nExpression of viral surface antigens from representatives of the papillomavirus, picornavirus, parvovirus and herpes virus groups cloned in such vector systems is illustrated in FIGURE 3. The levels of expression in E. coli of these viral surface antigens employing our vector systems range from 5-20% of the total cellular protein, certainly sufficient amounts to accommodate most production requirements.\n\nIn all cases tested, the surface antigens produced by molecular cloning do react with neutralizing antisera, either polyclonal or monoclonal, as indicated by the immunoprecipitation of the viral surface antigen-\u00df-galactosidase chimeric proteins (FIGURE 4) . Direct proof that the surface antigen genes of these viruses cloned in bacteria do indeed encode proteins that contain the required antigenic determinants necessary to induce neutralizing antibody is provided by the demonstration that these chimeric proteins induce antibody in animals that exhibit the capacity to neutralize infectious virus. For example, antisera from rabbits inoculated with the bovine papillomavirus chimeric protein specifically inactivated BPV-induced transformation of C127 cells in culture (FIGURE 5). The levels of neutralizing antibody that can be generated by chimeric surface antigen proteins are high indicating that these reagents serve as effective immunogens (TABLE 3) . aSera from rabbits A and B were tested for virus neutralization in the presence of 5% complement heat inactivated at 56 0 C for 30 minutes (No complement) or 5% active guinea pig complement (complement). The serum dilutions which gave 50% plaque reduction, compared with the pre-immune serum controls, are indicated.\n\nWe have utilized recombinant DNA and hybridoma technologies in an attempt to develop efficacious veterinary vaccines and antitoxins directed at reducing morbidity and mortality from infectious disease. To this end, we have developed a variety of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines by these technologies and have either completed, or are in the process of completing, clinical and field trials with these reagents. From our analysis of these reagents to date, it appears that \"Advances in Gene Technology\" will clearly have an effect on animals and the veterinary health care industry.\n\nThe first of our products to reach the marketplace will be the K99-specific monoclonal antibody. This reagent has been effective in significantly reducing the morbidity and mortality due to enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli in clinical studies to date when administered orally in skim milk to both colostrum fed and colostrum-deprived calves. The results of our studies indicate that monoclonal antibody directed against the K-99 pilus significantly reduced mortality in newborn calves challenged with a fatal dose of K99 strains of E. coli. This reduced mortality can be explained as the result of monoclonal antibody inhibiting the colonization of the intestine by K99 strains of E. coli. Antibodies directed against other capsular and somatic antigens of K99 E. coli did not appear to be involved in reduced mortality. The occurrence of enterotoxigenic colibacillosis in calves is often sporatic, depending on the interaction of factors such as colostrum ingestion, weather changes and stocking rates. Since the incidence of disease is low in some years it may be hard to convince livestock owners that vaccination of cows to prevent scours is cost effective. If outbreaks of K99-induced neonatal diarrhea subsequently occur, it is generally too late to vaccinate cows for passive protection of their offspring. The oral administration of K99-specific monoclonal antibody to calves at birth may be an effective way to reduce the economic loss to farmers when outbreaks of confirmed scours occur in herds in which cows have not been previously vaccinated. This novel form of therapy of calf scours obviates the need for vaccination and will, therefore, not only provide a much better approach for reducing spread of scours but will also benefit the farmer financially, as well. This is the first clinical use of a monoclonal antibody for passive immunization in veterinary medicine (3) .\n\nNovel veterinary vaccines are also being developed by genetic-engineering approaches. In this report we have described the overall methods by which we have cloned and expressed to high levels surface antigen genes from a variety of viruses that are responsible for various disease syndromes in bovine and swine. Most importantly, we have been able to demonstrate that surface antigens produced in bacteria by these approaches exhibit the capacity to induce antibodies in animals that neutralize the activity of the live, infectious virus. In our pre-clinical and clinical trials to date, the level of neutralizing antibody induced is similar to or better than levels of protective antibody that are present in animals that have recovered from the disease or received other viral vaccinations. Pending the results of rigorous clinical trials, which are presently ongoing, these reagents appear to represent an economic means by which farmers, cattlemen and horse ranchers will be able to reduce the morbidity and mortality to infectious diseases affecting the respiratory, alimentary and urogenital tracts of a variety of economically important animal species. expect to sell it for the same price, if not lower, as vaccines currently being marketed. We also expect the monoclonal anitbody to be a better value to the farmer than cow vaccination. As far as production is concerned, we have been able to adapt cell cluture procedures to equal the production costs in mice. All of our initial production is being carried out in mice.\n\nJ. NUNBERG: In beef and dairy practice, does calving occur on the range on .i in a barn? This will determine whether the farmer will be able to deliver the monoclonal antibody within the first day of life.\n\nA.J. FARAS: The vast majority of calving in dairy operations occurs in confinement.\n\nMoreover, many beef calves are also accessible to handling at one day of age.\n\nAt least 80% of beef calves are born into herds of 50 cows or less, thus the farmer is aware of health problems and has easy access to newborn calves. *P. KUNG: In clinical trials you inject the newborn animal s with a strain you are testing against. The real test lies in field random trials. Have those trials been completed? *A. J. FARAS:\n\nField random trials have been completed in Canada and are currently in progress in the United States. Since the data have not been assimilated, I was unable to present them here. The Canadian large scale field trials were successful and no deaths due to scours in newborn calves that were administered this product occurred.\n\nIn fact, it was the result of those field trials that facilitated government licensing and first commercial orders of this product for sale in Canada. *A. MCNAB: The K99 monoclonal s are IgG molecules. Would there be any advantage, stability-wise, in an IgA? *A.J. FARAS: No, because there are minimal amounts of proteases in the newborn calf gut. Moreover, in view of the efficacy of what we have, we are not pursuing either the preparation or the testing of any other type of monoclonal s. The IgG is sufficiently effective to reduce the incidence of disease in both clinical and field trials duri ng the critical 24-48 hour period following calving.\n\nIf there were problems associated with the antibodies in hand, of course, we would look at the alternatives. *A. 'CAB: Were you able to observe expression of the 18K and 60K parvovirus capsid proteins in bacteria? *A. J. FARAS: What we have cloned to expression is a large opening reading frame described earlier this morning. That l arge open reading frame contains the sequences which code for all three overlapping capsid peptides. The protein generated in bacteria which is coded for by this region of the porcine parvovirus genome induces neutralizing anti bodies in animals. * D. GELFAND: You indicated that one of the advantages of monoclonal antibody is that the farmer could have it on the shelf. When he encounters a problem he could then use it. Could the monoclonal antibody be given after exposure to disease? *A.J. FARAS:\n\nIn our clinical trials we do administer it after the animals have been exposed to disease. We wanted to ensure that if a calf is exposed but does not have the disease yet, the farmer could give the antibody to the animal and prevent the onset of infection.\n\nSo obviously we wanted to set it up with that objective in mind. *D. GELFAND: How short a time after exposure can he administer the antibody? *A.J. FARAS: Data indicate that within the first couple of hours or so orally administered antibody can effectively prevent the disease from developing. *D. GELFAND:\n\nThe farmer really still needs to immunize every calf? *A. J. FARAS: The farmer need only administer the product to those animals that he deems to be at risk and of sufficient value to warrant protection. *D. GELFAND: Before he knows he has a problem? */\\J FARAS: If one calf comes down with the disease, then you simply orally administer the antibody to the animals that might have been exposed. *D. JOSEPH: Instead of using K99 antibody to protect the cows, why not feed the E. col i to the animals to populate the gut?\n\nOral antibody provides instant protection following administration. Supplying nonpathogenic strains to populate the gut would not provide as rapid a protection. *N. STEBBING: Are the only E. col i strains that would do the job of eliciting a response those that are pathogenic? *A. J. FARAS: You would probably have to remove the pl asmids that produce the enterotoxin and then populate the gut with these bacteria.\n\nHowever, there is no direct data indicating that this type of therapy would work. *D. JOSEPH: Did you not state that once the gut is populated with normal bacteria there is no problem? *A. J. FARAS:\n\nThat is the current perception of what is happening."}
