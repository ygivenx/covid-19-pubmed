{"title": "Single cell RNA sequencing of 13 human tissues identify cell types and receptors of human coronaviruses", "body": "In December, 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection emerged in Wuhan. Over 30 thousand of people are infected with 2019-nCoV until February 8,  showing that 2019-nCoV is highly contagious. Coronavirus is a type of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus [1] Before the emergence of 2019-nCoV, there are 6 known human coronaviruses, including the Middle East respiratory syndrom coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The symptoms caused by 2019-nCoV infection include acute respiratory distress syndrome (~29%), acute cardiac injury (~12%) or acute kidney injury (~7%) [2] , implying that 2019-nCoV may infect various human tissues.\n\nViruses bind to host receptors on target cell surface to establish infection. Membrane proteins mediated membrane fusion allowed the entry of enveloped viruses [3] . As recently reported, both nCoV and SARS-CoV could use ACE2 protein to gain entry into the cells [4] .\n\nSince the outbreak, many data analysis have showed a wide distribution of ACE2 across human tissues, including lung [5] , liver [6] , stomach [7] , ileum [7] , colon [7] and kidney [8] , indicating that 2019-nCoV may infect multiple organs. However, these data showed that AT2 cell (the main target cell of 2019-nCoV) in the lung actually expressed rather low levels of ACE2 [8] .\n\nHence, the nCoVs may depends on co-receptor or other auxiliary membrane proteins to facilitate its infection. It is reported that viruses tend to hijack co-expressed proteins as their host factors [9] . For example, Hoffmann et al. recently showed that 2019-nCoV-S uses ACE2 for entry and depends on the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for priming [10] , showing that 2019-nCoV infections also require multiple factors. Understanding the receptors usage by the viruses could facilitate the development of intervention strategies. Therefore, identifying the potential co-receptors or auxiliary membrane proteins for 2019-nCoV is of great significance.\n\nFor this purpose, we collected single cell gene expression matrices from 13 relatively normal human tissues, consisting of lung [11] , liver [12] , ileum [13] , rectum [13] , blood [14] , bone marrow [15] , skin [16] , spleen [17] , esophagus [17] , colon [18] , eye [19] , stomach [20] and kidney [21] from published literatures. We analyzed the single cell co-expression profiles of 51 known ssRNA viral receptors and 400 membrane proteins, including ACE2, in the identified 119 cell types across the 13 human tissues. Consistent with other recent studies, ACE2 was found to be present in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon. Using hierarchy clustering . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

In total, we collected single cell gene expression data of 13 tissues, including liver, lung, colon, ileum, rectum, blood, spleen, bone marrow, eye, skin, stomach, oesophagus and kidney. The data source and the sample information are listed as follows. Liver, GEO \n\nThe raw count matrix (UMI counts per gene per cell) was processed by Seurat [22] . Cells with less than 100 expressed genes (UMI count > 0) and higher than 25% mitochondrial genome transcript were removed. Genes expressed in less than three cells were removed. Then, we normalized the gene expression data using \"NormalizeData\" function with default settings.\n\nThe sources of cell-cell variation driven by batch were regressed out using the number of detected UMI and mitochondrial gene expression, which was implemented by ''ScaleData'' function. The corrected expression matrix was used for cell clustering and dimensional reduction.\n\nThe cell clustering and dimensional reduction were performed by Seurat package. Before that, we choose 2000 highly variable genes (HVGs) from the corrected expression matrix and then centered and scaled them. It was implemented by ''FindVariableGenes'' function in the Seurat package. We then performed principle component analysis (PCA) on the HVGs using ''RunPCA'' function. To remove the signal-to-noise ratio, we select a number of significant principal components by implementing \"JackStraw\" function, which was implemented by permutation test. Specifically, we firstly identified 50 principal components as a result and then selected the significant components according to the p-values produced by \"ScoreJackStraw\" function for further analysis. The batch effects were removed by harmony package [23] .\n\nCells were then clustered utilizing the ''FindClusters'' function through embedding cells into a graph structure in PCA space. We set the parameter resolution as 0.8 to identify only major cell types, e.g. T cells, B cells or macrophages. The clustered cells were then projected onto a two-dimensional space using \"RunUMAP\" function. The clustering results were visualized by \"DimPlot\" function.\n\nTo annotate cell clusters, we firstly identified the differentially expressed genes on each cluster by performing \"FindMarkers\" function. The cell clusters were then annotated according to curated known cell markers ( Figure S1 ). The cell clusters consistently expressed the same . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The significant cell-cell interactions were selected with p-value < 0.01.\n\nWe collected the single cell RNA sequencing data (raw count gene expression matrix or normalized gene expression matrix) from published literatures, which have been deposited in public database, e.g. GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) or Human Cell Atlas (https://www.humancellatlas.org). Totally, we curated single cell gene expression matrices of 13 human tissues, including lung [11] , liver [12] , ileum [13] , rectum [13] , blood [14] , bone marrow [15] , skin [16] , spleen [17] , esophagus [17] , colon [18] , eye [19] , stomach [20] and kidney [21] ( Table S1 ). The raw count matrix was normalized and scaled by Seurat package [22] (Materials and Methods). For each tissue, we performed cell clustering and dimension reduction on gene expression matrix using Seurat package. After filtering out low quality cells, we obtained 8443, 43474, 4248, 5282, 3279, 30693, 97695, 17131,4335, 11552, 4871, 8880, 20197 cells from liver, lung, colon, ileum, rectum, blood, spleen, bone marrow, eye, skin, stomach, esophagus and kidney, respectively ( Table S1 ). The cell clusters were then annotated using canonical markers searched from the published articles ( Figure S1 ). We finally annotated 119 cell types from 13 human tissues.\n\nLung belongs to respiratory system, in which 13 cell types were identified ( Figure S2) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.951913 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nThe eyes are sensory organs in nervous system. Ten cell types were identified in eyes ( Figure   S2 ). Fibroblasts and immune cells composed of ~31% and ~25% of total cells, respectively.\n\nEyes also contain endothelial cells, melanocytes, pericytes, retinal pigment epithelium (RPEs) and Schwann cells.\n\nBone marrow is the primary site of hematopoiesis. We identified large number of NK/NKT cells (~44%) and erythrocytes (~28%) cells in bone marrow (Figure S2) . B cells, hematopoietic stem cells, MK progenitors, monocytes, neutrophils and DCs were also detected in bone marrow.\n\nBlood is circulated around various tissues. Monocytes (~32%) and T cells (~55%) make up the largest proportion of blood cells (Figure S2 ). In addition, we also identified B cells, cDCs, macrophages, NK cells, pDCs and platelets in blood. \n\nWe firstly analyzed the expression pattern of ACE2 across 13 tissues (Figure 1) . Our results reveal that ACE2 expresses in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules, consistent with the recent reports [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, ACE2 expression levels are rather low in lung AT2 (4.7-fold lower than the average expression level of all ACE2 expressing cell types). We assume that the presence of co-receptors or other auxiliary membrane proteins in AT2 cells may facilitate the binding and entry of the nCoV.

Furthermore, 400 membrane proteins were extracted from Membranome database [25] (https://membranome.org). Totally 451 genes were curated, 95.7% (432/451) of which express in at least one of the 13 tissues. We examined the expression spectrum of the 432 genes across the 119 cell types.\n\nTo elaborate the potential relationship between ACE2 and other membrane proteins or viral receptors, we calculated the Pearson Correlation Coefficient between each two genes in the curated reservoir. The findings show that 94 genes are significantly correlated with ACE2 (P<0.01) in a manner of gene expression. Of note, ANPEP, ENPEP and DPP4 are the top three genes correlated with ACE2 (R>0.8) (Figure 2) . ANPEP, alanyl aminopeptidase, is a host receptor targeted by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, human coronavirus 229E, feline coronavirus, canine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and infectious bronchitis virus. These viruses all belong to Coronaviridae. Besides skin, ANPEP also mainly expresses in colon, ileum, rectum, kidney and liver (Figure S3 & Figure S4 ), demonstrating that receptor of coronavirus may have similar expression profiles in human body. ENPEP, Glutamyl\n\nAminopeptidase, belongs to the peptidase M1 family which is the mammalian type II integral membrane zinc-containing endopeptidases. ENPEP regulates blood pressure regulation and blood vessel formation through the catabolic pathway of the renin-angiotensin system [26] . The relationship between ENPEP and viral infection is unknown. DPP4, the receptor of MERS-CoV, shows expression similarity with ACE2, except that DPP4 expresses in some T cells of all the observed tissues ( Figure S3 & Figure S4 ). All of the three genes encode peptidase, which are uniquely adopted by coronavirus as their receptors [27] . This result raised the possibility that ENPEP may be another yet unknown receptor for coronavirus. To further consolidate the findings, we calculated the Euclidean distance between all the curated proteins and constructed their hierarchy relationships across the 119 cell types. DPP4 was the first gene clustered with ACE2.\n\nTogether, our data demonstrates that the coronavirus receptors tend to share co-expression pattern across different tissues, consistent with the fact that CoVs infect similar types of cells and CoV-infected patients share similar clinical symptoms.\n\n.

We sought to identify potential immune cells crosstalking with CoVs-targeted cells. The cell-cell interaction analysis was conducted by CellPhoneDB [24] . The interactions with p-value < 0.01 were adopted to construct the interaction relationship between cell types in each tissue.\n\nUsing the cell type expressing ACE2 as ligand-secreting cells, we calculated the total number of interactions with each receptor-secreting cell type. As a result, we found that macrophages showed highest active interaction with ACE2-expressing cells in liver, lung and stomach ( Figure 3A) sharing a CD74-MIF signaling pairs (Figure 3B) \n\nThe coronaviruses are a large family of ssRNA viruses causing respiratory diseases in humans. Most of the coronaviruses are associated with mild clinical symptoms, except SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, showing fatality rate of 9.6% and 34%, respectively [28, 29] .

It is also increasingly recognized that 2019-nCoV could be transmitted via multiple routes.\n\nThe viruses target host cells via binding host receptors before engaging the infection cycle.\n\nACE2 was proved to be the cell receptor of 2019-nCoV, the same receptor as SARS-CoV [5, 10] . The expression profiles of ACE2 across different cell types of different organs will reveal clues of the virus transmission routes and its potential pathogenesis. In previous studies, ACE2 was found to express in the esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells, absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon, alveolar type II cells in lung, liver cholangiocyte and kidney proximal tubules [5] [6] [7] . These findings suggested that the clinical symptoms of hepatic failure, respiratory injury, acute kidney injury or diarrhoea may be associated with the pervasive ACE2 expressing cells in these tissues. However, we and others found that ACE2 is lowly expressed, especially in the lung (the main target organ of nCoVs), raising the possible existence of coreceptors facilitating nCoV infection. It is well recognized that ssRNA viruses tend to have multiple receptors [9] . For example, ACE2, CD209 (Dendritic Cell-Specific ICAM-3-Grabbing Non-Integrin 1), CLEC4G (C-type lectin domain family 4 member G) and CLEC4M (C-type lectin domain family 4 member M) are receptors of SARS-CoV [31] [32] [33] [34] . In addition, other membrane proteins may also assist virus entry [3] . Since the viral receptor and co-receptors should be co-expressed on the same cell types, we analyzed single cell co-expression patterns covering 400 membrane proteins and 51 known viral receptors in this study. After calculating their gene expression similarity, we found ANPEP, ENPEP and DPP4 are top three genes correlated with ACE4 (R>0.8). Interestingly, both ANPEP and DPP4 are viral receptors of human coronaviruses [35] , while ENPEP is also a peptidase, despite that its involvement in virus infection is unclear. For mysterious reasons, human coronaviruses use peptidases as their receptors [27] . Now, we showed co-expression profiles of these molecules, indicating that different human CoVs actually target the similar cell types across different human tissues. It also explains why,patients infected with different human CoVs manifest similar clinical \n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s). Table S1 and materials and methods).
