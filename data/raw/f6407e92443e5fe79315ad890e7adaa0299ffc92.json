{"title": "Ratification vote on taxonomic proposals to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (2008)", "body": "In accordance with the Statutes of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the final stage in the process of making changes to the Universal Scheme of Virus Classification is the ratification of taxonomic proposals by ICTV members. This can occur either at a plenary meeting of ICTV, held during an International Congress of Virology meeting, or by circulation of proposals by mail, followed by a ballot. Therefore, a list of proposals that had been subjected to the full, multi-stage review process was prepared and presented on the ICT-Vonline web pages in March 2008. This review process involved input from the ICTV study groups and subcommittees, other interested virologists, and the ICTV Executive Committee. For the first time, the ratification process was performed entirely by email. The proposals were sent electronically via email on 18 March 2008, to ICTV Life Members (11), ICTV Subcommittee Members (74), and ICTV National Representatives (53). Members were then requested to vote on whether to ratify the taxonomic proposals, within a 1-month deadline.\n\nInternational Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses attempts to keep an up-to-date list of all members, including National Representatives, but this is a daunting task. As a means of promoting contact between ICTV and its National Members and to ensure that lists of members are up to date, member societies of IUMS are obliged to either renew ICTV National Members or replace them every three years. In effect, National Members have a 3-year tenure that can be renewed indefinitely. National Societies, which are members of the International Union of Microbiological Societies, are encouraged to contact ICTV directly through the ICTV Secretary with the names of their National Representatives. Complete contact information can be obtained from the ICTV web site: http://ictvonline.org.\n\nThe following are the taxonomic proposals that were ratified by ICTV members in April 2008. (This is not strictly necessary as a taxonomic proposal because it concerns entities below the species level, but it is left in to clarify this reorganization of the Herpesviridae. These viruses are reassigned to new taxa below). (2005.070-071V are not strictly necessary as taxonomic proposals because they concern entities below the species level, but they are left in to clarify this reorganization of the Herpesviridae).\n\n2005.072V.04 To rename Callitrichine herpesvirus 1, an unassigned species in the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae in the family Herpesviridae: Saguinine herpesvirus 1. 2005.262V.04 To assign the following viruses to the species Human enterovirus C in the existing genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae: Human poliovirus 1, Human poliovirus 2, Human poliovirus 3.\n\n(This is not strictly necessary as a taxonomic proposal because it concerns entities below the species level, but it is left in to clarify this reorganization of the Picornaviridae "}
