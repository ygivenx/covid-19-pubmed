{"title": "Enhanced Hygiene Measures and Norovirus Transmission during an Outbreak", "body": "The estimated maximum likelihood estimates are \u03b1 = 3.35 and \u03b2 = 1.09, resulting in a peak generation time of 2.6, and a mean generation time of 3.6 days. Other positively skewed unimodal distributions such as the Weibull distributions did not produce a significantly better fit.\n\nAs the generation time distribution might also be a realization of a mixture of several components, we fitted the data with a mixture of 2 or 3 gamma distributed components. This did not give a significantly better fit than a 1-component model (Technical Appendix 1 Table) . \n\nLet t = (t 1 ,\u2026,t n ) be the vector of observed times of symptom onset of observed cases {1, \u2026, n}. We assume that the elements of t are ordered such that t i \u2264t j for all i <j. For subsets {i k , \u2026 i k+j } \u2286 {1,\u2026,n} with all permutations of observations within this subset are equivalent. We chose 1 possible ordering arbitrarily. We now define a transmission matrix V = (v i,j ), whose elements represent the probability that the person with time of symptom onset t i was infected by the person with time of symptom onset t j , thus\n\n. Assuming that every case i > 2 was infected by another case in the set of observed cases, we get:\n\nfor all i > 2. For i =1, the index case, we assume that:\n\nFurthermore, we assume that v i,j = 0 for all j < i. This assumption means that the ordering of times of infection is equivalent to the ordering of observed times of symptom onset, and more specifically, that persons cannot have infected themselves and cannot have infected persons with earlier time of symptom onset than their own. The matrix V is a lower triangular matrix and therefore does not contain cycles.\n\nTo translate the transmission matrix V to reproduction number estimates, any The expected number of secondary cases produced by case j in these possible outbreaks based on transmission matrix V is:\n\nTo translate this to an estimate of R for each day in the outbreak t; the mean R j of all cases with the same date of symptom onset is calculated, for all dates with observations:\n\nwhere m represents the label of the first case with symptom onset on day t, and q the total number of cases on day t.\n\nThe likelihood that an observed time interval t i -t j represents a transmission event is determined as a product of the probability that i was infected by j and the probability that the time interval of symptom onset is t i -t j . That is,\n\nThe likelihood of any case-patient j transmitting infection to case-patient i, becomes:\n\nCombining for all observed cases, the likelihood of a transmission matrix V becomes:\n\nfor a given value of \u03b8, and omitting the index case (i = 1) from the multiplication. Given the parameters for the generation time distribution \u03b8, and all dates of symptom onset t, the parameters v i,j can be estimated. To estimate v i,j , the above likelihood function was evaluated in an adaptive rejection algorithm (Metropolis Hastings sampler) obtaining sets of V matrices with relative frequencies proportional to their likelihood (2) (3) (4) .\n\nTo be reasonably certain of convergence and sufficient mixing, we have run 4 independent chains of 40,000 iterations and 3 independent chains with additional information about population structure and pathogen genotype and compared resulting estimates of reproduction numbers.\n\nAdding additional information is possible by setting implausible transmission probabilities in the transmission matrix V to 0. This may be considered a very strong prior assumption, but we have seen (Figure 4 in main text) that the resulting reproduction numbers are not strongly influenced by this radical assumption. In a true Bayesian approach, we might have applied different weights to pairs of cases within and between camps by multiplying a matrix containing these weights with the transmission matrix V.\n\nAs described above, case-patients with a date of symptom onset on the same day are given an arbitrary order of infection within that day. Sampled transmission matrices represent all possible (noncyclic) patterns among cases, given the arbitrary order. Now any other possible pattern can be found by permutation of indexes among cases with the same date of symptom onset. Because these all have the same contribution to the likelihood such permutations do not change the likelihood: all permutations are equally likely. Such permutations also have the same reproduction numbers, only for different cases (indices). If we average over all such permutations with identical contributions, the resulting reproduction numbers do not change.\n\nThe expected time course of the reproduction number R(t) is given by the following equation:\n\nHere, is the day of implementation of enhanced hygiene measures, G is the cumulative probability function of the generation time distribution, h t \u03c1 is the relative reduction of the reproduction number due to implementation of hygiene measures and is the effective reproduction number without enhanced hygiene measures. u R"}
