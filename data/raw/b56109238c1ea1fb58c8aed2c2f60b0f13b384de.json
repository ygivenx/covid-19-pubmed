{"title": "Diarylheptanoids as nutraceutical: A review", "body": "Phenolic compounds have been well investigated for their disease prevention and health promoting effects based on epidemiological studies using both in-vitro and in-vivo methods (Vauzour et al., 2010; Kyselova, 2011; Dzia\u0142o et al., 2016) . Most of them have been used in traditional medicine formulation and in pharmaceutical preparations (Asif, 2015; Tungmunnithum et al., 2018) . They comprise of a wide range of compounds from simple phenols to complex polyphenols, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, lignans and stilbenes (Lin et al., 2016; Ciulu et al., 2018) . Diarylheptanoids are complex phenolic compounds having the skeletal structure of two aromatic rings conjugated with seven carbon chains (Brand et al., 2006; Amalraj et al., 2017) . They are structurally diverse and have been isolated from seeds, fruits, leaves, roots, rhizomes and barks of plants of different families such as Myricaceae, Betulaceae, Zingiberaceae, Aceraceae, Leguminosae and Burseraceae (Per et al., 2002; Kawai et al., 2008; Ibrahim et al., 2017) . More than 400 diarylheptanoids have been identified till now and most compounds occur in Zingiber, Betula and Alnus species (Vidakovi\u0107 et al., 2017; Alberti et al., 2018) . These species exhibit characteristic aroma, and also act as colouring agents. Mostly, Zingiber and Curcuma rhizomes have been used as seasoning spices and as ingredients in folk medicines and traditional Asian medicines (Kunnumakkara et al., 2009) . Organoleptic characteristics are attributed to the presence of diarylheptanoids. Singldinger et al. (2017) identified asadanin, a cyclic diarylhepatanoids responsible for the bitter off-taste in Corylus avellana.\n\nNutraceuticals are bioactive compounds or extracts with scientifically evident health benefits (Cencic and Chingwaru, 2010; El-Sohaimy, 2012; Nasri et al., 2014) . A dietary supplements, are available in the form of tablets, capsules or syrups targeting disease prevention and treatment (Caleja et al., 2017; Dutta et al., 2019) . Epidemiological studies show that dietary supplementation of nutraceuticals such as catechins, linolenic acid, anthocyanin, lycopene, resveratrol and saponin glycosides can decrease the incidence of diseases (Cencic and Chingwaru, 2010; Aschemann-Witzel and Grunert, 2015; Ruchi, 2017) . Studies have shown that nutraceuticals have the property to inhibit prostate cancer growth (Salami et al., 2013) , protect against cardiovascular disease (Sosnowska et al., 2017) , control cholesterol levels (Cicero et al., 2012) and andrologic disorders (Tamler and Mechanick, 2007) , maintain gastrointestinal health (Romano et al., 2012) and retard degenerative disorders (Pasrija et al., 2015) . Diarylheptanoids, also known as dipheylheptanoids, fall under the class of plant secondary metabolites derived from various plant sources (Table 1) . It constitutes two phenolic aromatic rings linked by a linear seven-carbon chains. It can be either open chain or macrocyclic diarylheptanoids ( Fig. 1) (Keser\u00fc and N\u00f3gr\u00e1di, 1995) . Studies have also shown the health benefits of diarylheptanoids. Among nutraceuticals, curcumin is an important diarylheptanoid compound, studied extensively for its role in protection against many diseases (Kunnumakkara et al., 2017) . Extracts of Alpinia officinarum contain diarylheptanoids, and are prepared as a health supplement capsule (Dong et al., 2015) . Diarylheptanoids isolated from Alnus glutinosa have shown to protect noncancerous dividing cells during cancer treatment (Dini\u0107 et al., 2015) . Winuthayanon et al. (2009) showed the estrogenic activity of diarylheptanoids isolated from C. comosa and its role in postmenopausal hormone therapy. Cassumunarin gives excellent anti-oxidant properties , Cassumunins A, B and C isolated from Zingiber cassumunar showed stronger antioxidant activities than that of curcumin , and studies have shown the therapeutic benefits of gingerenones (Suk et al., 2017) and platyphylloside (Karri et al., 2019) in treating obesity (see Tables 2 and 3) .\n\nDiarylheptanoid compounds possess numerous therapeutic benefits, including anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, anti-cathartic, anti-emetic, diuretic, choleretic, hepato-protective, cholesterol level lowering, antibacterial, anti-fungal, analeptic and anti-diabetic activities. These are discussed below:\n\nDiarylheptanoids exhibit significant anti-inflammatory properties. Hirsutenone isolated from the bark of A. japonica could suppress early T-cell activation; thereby, inhibiting the degranulation of mast cells, making it a potential candidate for treating atopic dermatitis (Jeong et al., 2010) . Cyclic diarylheptanoid, acerogenin M isolated from the methanol extract of Acer nikoense stem bark , oregonin, a diarylheptanoid derivative isolated from Alnus formosana (Lee et al., 2005) and cassumunarins A, B, and C from Z. cassumunar inhibit edema formation, exhibiting strong anti-inflammatory activity than curcumin (Masuda et al., 1995) ; diarylheptanoid, 7-(4\u2032-hydroxy-3\u2032methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylhept-4-en-3-one from A. officinarum (Yadav et al., 2003) and cyclic diarylheptanoids isolated from the stem bark of A. nikoense such as acerosides B1 and B2, and aceroketosides inhibit the release of \u03b2-hexosaminidase (Morikawa et al., 2003) . Diarylheptanoids isolated from bark of A. hirsuta, especially oregonin and hirsutanonol showed high anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase-2 expression (Lee et al., 2000) .

Blepharocalyxins A and B from Alpinia blepharocalyx exhibit inhibitory effects on nitric oxide production in endotoxin-activated murine macrophages (Kadota et al., 1996) .\n\nDiarylheptanoids acts as potent antioxidants. Studies have reported the free oxygen radicals scavenging activity of curcumin (Unnikrishnan and Rao, 1995; Jayaprakasha et al., 2006; Ak and G\u00fcl\u00e7in, 2008) . Mistletonone exhibited scavenging capability both on hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion radicals as compared with standard (\u2212)-epigallocatechin gallate (Yao et al., 2007) . Cassumunin A, B, C and cassumunarin A, B, C isolated from Zingiber cassumunar are also potent antioxidants showing stronger or equal antioxidant activity as that of curcumin (Nagano et al., 1997; Masuda et al., 1995) . Diarylheptanoids isolated from Z. officinale especially 5-[4-hydroxy-6-(4-hydroxyphenethyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl]-3-methoxybenzene-1,2-diol, 5-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-7-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) heptan-3-one and 1,5-epoxy-3-hydroxy-1-(4,5-dihydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-7-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) heptanes are capable of scavenging superoxide anion radicals and inhibiting the formation of lipid peroxides in liver microsomes (Tao et al., 2008) .

Anti-microbial activity Diarylheptanoids have also been investigated for anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral activities. a) Anti-bacterial activity. Diarylheptanoids isolated from A. officinarum especially 5-hydroxy-7-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenyl-3-heptanone, showed anti-Helicobacter pylori activity (Lee et al., 2009) . Curcumin can inhibit the growth of several bacteria species like Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and Lactobacillus (Bhavani-Shankar and Sreenivasamurthy, 1979) . It can also prevent growth of Helicobacter pylori, in vitro (Mahady et al., 2002) . Diarylheptanoids such as gingerenones A, B and C as well as isogingerenone isolated from Zingiber officinarum, show moderate antifungal activity (Endo et al., 1990) .

Studies have shown that ether and chloroform extracts, and the oil of C. longa have antifungal effects (Banerjee and Nigam, 1978) ; particularly, curcumin has anti-fungal effects (Wuthi-Udomler et al., 2000) . Turmeric oil is found to be active against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus, Fusarium moniliforme and Penicillium digitatum (Jayaprakasha et al., 2001) . c) Anti-viral activity. Hirsutenone exhibits strong papain-like protease inhibitory activity in suppressing the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It can act as a potential drug target for the treatment of SARS. . Curcumin inhibits epstein-barr virus key activator, Bam H fragment z left frame 1 (BZLF1) protein transcription in Raji DR-LUC cells (Hergenhahn et al., 2002) . It also shows anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) activity by inhibiting the HIV-1 integrase needed for viral replication (Mazumdar et al., 1995; De Clercq, 2000) .\n\nDiarylheptanoids glycosides isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of Pyrostria major leaf show moderate anti-plasmodial activities; particularly (3S,5S)-3,5-dihydroxy1-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-7-(4methoxyphenyl) heptyl 3-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside shows potential antileishmanial activity (Beniddir et al., 2012) . Studies confirm that curcumin has anti-leishmanial (Koide et al., 2002) and anti-Plasmodium falciparum activity (Rasmussen et al., 2000) . Further, studies have shown that diarylheptanoid structure related to curcumin show antileishmanial activity against Leishmania species such as L. amazonensis, Table 3 Pharmacological profile of diarylheptanoids.\n\n(continued on next page) G.

Particularly, the n-butanol fraction containing 1,7-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-hepten-3-one significantly decreased the collagen content and increased the caspase-3/7 activity . In another study, curcumin could suppress bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats (Srivastava et al., 1985; Punithavathi et al., 2000) . Dehydrohirsutanonol, an active constituent isolated from A. firma exhibits anti-fibrotic activity and can be recommended as a therapeutic agent for liver fibrosis (Lee et al., 2011) . Crude fractions of Curcuma species such as C. aromatica, C. longa, C. caesia, C. amada and C. zedoria with diarylheptanoids have been dialyzed and investigated for their coagulation cascade with respect to pro-coagulant activity. Results confirmed reducing clotting time, confirming its fibrino-genolytic acitivty (Shivalingu et al., 2015) .\n\nDiarylheptanoids, such as epihirsutanonol and alusenone isolated from A. japonica show hepato-protective properties (Tung et al., 2010) .

Curcumin decreases advanced glycation end-product induced complications in diabetes mellitus (Sajithlal et al., 1998) . Studies also prove that it decreases blood sugar level in alloxan-induced diabetes in rat (Arun and Nalini, 2002) . It can also prevent galactose-induced cataract formation at very low doses (Suryanarayana et al., 2003) .\n\nDiarylheptanoids also possess various other potential pharmacological activities. Anti-ulcerogenic studies have shown gastroprotective and antiulcerogenic effect of curcumin by induction of angiogenesis in the granular tissue of ulcers. It has excellent therapeutic potential in restoration of Helibacter pylori induced gastric damage (Tuorkey and Karolin, 2009; Mei et al., 2009) . Curcumin inhibits 5 alpha reductase activity, normally involved in the conversion of testosterone to 5a-dihydrotestosterone (Liao et al., 2001) . It affects the mobility of human spermatozoa and its function in vitro and in vivo fertility (Naz and Lough, 2014) . Studies have demonstrated the potential of curcumin for the development of a novel intravaginal contraceptive (Zhang et al., 2017) . Diarylheptanoids isolated from D. spongiosa such as diospongin B and C are found to exhibit anti-osteoporotic activity by inhibiting the release of 45 Ca on the resorption of bone tissues, the same was compared with standard drug elcitonin (Yin et al., 2004a) . The aqueous extract of D. spongiosa exhibits significant induction of osteoblast proliferation, also inhibiting osteoclast formation against less cytotoxicity in osteoblast and bone marrow cells (Yin et al., 2004b) .\n\nThere is an increasing awareness and expectancy for safe and healthy foods among public, and this has been the driving force for the incorporation of bioactive compounds in food matrices. Diarylheptanoids have a wide spectrum of health-promoting properties and are also an indispensable component in a variety of pharmaceutical, medicinal and cosmetic applications. They are found to be a key bioactive ingredient in traditional and folk medicines formulation for treating various diseases. They can be used as alternative sources for therapeutics/nutraceuticals. Further research is needed to best utilize diarylheptanoids in diet, with the focus to promote human health and wellness. G. Ganapathy, et al. Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology 19 (2019) "}
