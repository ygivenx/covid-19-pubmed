{"title": "Crystal structure of the giant panda MHC class I complex: first insights into the viral 1 peptide presentation profile in the bear family 2", "body": "The interaction between MHC-I and \u03b22m, the features of pAime-128 involved in TCR docking 23 and CD8 binding, the anchor sites in the PBG, and the CTL epitopes of potential viruses that 24 infect pandas were concretely clarified. Unique features of pMHC-I viral antigen presentation 25 in the panda were revealed by solving the three-dimensional structure of pAime-128. The 26 distinct characteristics of pAime-128 indicate an unusual event that emerged during the 27 evolution of the MHC system in the bear family. These results provide a new platform for 28 research on panda CTL immunity and the design of vaccines for application in the bear family. 29\n\nUrsidae includes 5 genera and 8 species; however, the study of its immunology, especially 31 structural immunology, is extremely rare to date. In this paper, we first crystallized the key 32 complex pMHC-I, taking the giant panda as its representative species. Structural characteristics 33 of the giant panda pMHC-I complexes, contains the unique pockets of PBG were analyzed in 34 detail. Comparison of the panda pMHC-I in the bear family and other mammals, almost definite 35 features was displayed. Meanwhile, the interaction between HC and LV, the unique features of 36 pMHC-I in the CD8 binding and TCR docking, validation of anchor site in the PBG, and 37 epitopes of potential viruses infected with the pandas, were concretely clarified. These unique 38 characteristics of pMHC-I clearly indicate an unusual situation during the evolution of MHC 39 molecules in the endangered pandas. These results also provide a novel platform for further 40 study of panda T cell immunology and vaccines. 41 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Common CTLs include CD8 + T cells, which recognize only 44 antigens presented by classical major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules 45\n\n(1). MHC-I genes are expressed in most nucleated cells and present antigens derived mostly 46 from intracellular viruses, parasites, and tumors (2). Structural studies of have shown that the complex is generally composed of an MHC-I, \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22m), 48 and peptide (pMHC-I) (3). The MHC-I contains \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13 domains in its extracellular 49 region, with the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains forming the pMHC-I peptide-binding groove (PBG) (4-9). 50 Antigen peptides 8-11 amino acids in length are loaded onto the PBG and subsequently 51 recognized by TCR expressed on the surface of CD8 + T cells (10) . Interactions between the 52 pMHC-I complex and TCR form the first signal for the activation of antigen-specific CD8 + T 53 cells (11). The direct interaction between TCR and pMHC-I demonstrates the MHC-I-54 restriction nature of CD8 + T cell recognition and indicates a close evolutionary relationship 55 between pMHC-I and TCR (12, 13) . It is widely accepted that in addition to direct interaction 56 with TCR, MHC-I engagement of the CD8 coreceptor is required for the functional activation 57 of CD8 + T cells (14). The transmembrane glycoprotein CD8 molecules bind to pMHC-I and 58 recruit the Src tyrosine kinase p65lck (Lck) to the TCR-pMHC-I complex, resulting in the 59 assembly of a TCR-pMHC-I-CD8 ternary complex (15). Therefore, the presentation of various 60 endogenous peptides by the pMHC-I complex is key in determining whether the antiviral CTL 61 immune response is initiated. 62\n\nThe structures and functions of pMHC-I complexes that bind viral peptides or peptides have 63 been investigated in humans (16), mice (17), monkeys (9), cattle (8), pigs (5), horses (18), dogs 64 (6), cats (4), chickens (19), and a bony fish (20). The polymorphism of MHC-I molecules causes 65 variation in PBGs in various mammalian pMHC-I complexes, which triggers various types of 66 CTL immune responses. Although there are many reports of mammalian pMHC-I complexes, 67 no study has yet been conducted on the pMHC-I structure in the bear family (Ursidae), which 68 includes the giant panda. The bear family includes 5 genera and 8 species. Classical MHC-I 69 genes and polymorphisms in the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), brown bears and the 70 Asiatic black bear have been reported. Phylogenetic studies indicate that although the giant 71 panda belongs to the bear family, divergence between the giant panda and other bears occurred 72 approximately >17 million years ago (21). The giant panda has an estimated population size of 73 approximately 2500 individuals worldwide, and its classical MHC-I/II genes are located on 74 chromosome 9q (22). The large genetic region of MHC-I is believed to play critical roles in 75 CTL immunity. In addition, the giant panda MHC-I molecules represent an important model 76 for understanding the structural and functional characteristics of these antiviral complexes in 77 the bear family. 78\n\nSeveral studies have been performed to identify giant panda MHC-I genes. In early work, three 79 classical MHC-I genes (including Aime-128) were identified in the giant panda, and the Aime-80 128 gene was proven to include ten conserved amino acids critical for viral antigenic peptide 81 binding as described by human leukocyte antigen I (HLA-I) (23). Subsequent genetic analysis 82 identified six panda MHC-I genes, four of which are classical MHC-I genes (24). High levels 83 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The CCV-NGY9 is loaded onto PBG 117 of pAime-128 (Fig 1B) . 118 Further analysis showed that strands and loops of Aime-\u03b22m broadly interact with 119 and the numbers and patterns of hydrogen bonds formed in these interactions were similar to 120 those of other mammalian MHC I molecules. Analysis revealed that a depth of Aime-\u03b22m in 121\n\nAime-128 up to 1351.1 \u00c5 2 (Fig 1C) . In addition, the hydrogen bonds involved in the 122 interactions between Aime-128 and Aime-\u03b22m were found to differ from those in humans. 123\n\nAime-\u03b22m forms only 15 hydrogen bonds with Aime-128, whereas in HLA-B*5101, \u03b22m can 124 form 25 hydrogen bonds with MHC-I (29), which implies the interactions are weaker than 125 humans (Fig 1C) . Thus, the main function of \u03b22m is to stabilize MHC-I, even though the same 126 \u03b22m can interact with MHC-I in various ways. The main role of \u03b22m is to ensure the stable 127 function of pMHC-I, and the manner of its interaction with MHC-I is thought to be able to 128 promote side effects such as \u03b22m dissociation and even diseases (29). 129\n\nThe amino acids in PBG form six functional pockets, named pockets A to F, to accommodate 131 residues of the CCV-NGY9 peptide (Fig 2) . Pocket A in pAime-128 consists of residues Met 5 , 132\n\nTyr 7 , Tyr 59 , Arg 62 , Asn 63 , Tyr 159 , Glu 163 , Trp 167 and Tyr 171 ( Table 3) . P1-Asn of CCV-NGY9 was 133 inserted into pocket A. Based on the 3D structures of pMHC-I in different species, Asn 63 and 134\n\nGlu 163 of Aime-128 are rare among all of the known class I molecules, i.e., these residues are 135 found in only certain alleles, such as HLA-B*5101 and HLA-B*2705 (Fig 2) . Due to the 136 presence of residue Asn 63 in Aime-128, pocket A of this molecule is considered to be tighter 137 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

P2-Gly of CCV-NGY9 is tethered by hydrogen bonds to residues in 140 PBG and fits into the small pocket B. In most class I molecules, the residues at positions 63 and 141 66 are Glu and Lys, respectively, which are both charged residues. The residue at position 99 142 of Aime-128 is His instead of the conserved Tyr residue; both of these residues have a large 143 side chain, but they have different charges (Fig 2) . Pocket B of pAime-128 extends deep under 144 the \u03b11 helix and touches the Met45 residue, which is one of the most polymorphic residues in 145 mammalian MHC-I molecules (Fig 3) . 146 Pocket C of pAime-128 is composed of residues Asn 70 , Phe 74 , Trp 97 and Leu 116 and shows an 147 obvious negative charge, and none of these residues are highly conserved among known 148 mammalian class I molecules (Fig 2) . Pocket C is wide but shallow. P5-Phe and P6-Phe of 149 CCV-NGY9 are located in this pocket, and no hydrogen bonds exist between the C pocket and 150 the peptide, only van der Waals forces. The side chain of P6-Phe extends outward into the 151 solvent and may play a role in TCR docking (Fig 3) . 152 Pocket D in pAime-128 accommodates the side chains of P3 and P4 residues. The pocket 153\n\nconsists of residues Ile 66 , Trp 97 , His 99 , Ser 114 , Glu 152 , Arg 155 , Tyr 156 and Tyr 159 ( Table 3 ). In the 154 peptide CCV-NGY9, the residue at position 3 is Tyr, which has a large side chain and, as a 155 result, forms two hydrogen bonds and many van der Waals interactions with pocket D (Fig 3) . 156 The side chain of P3 is inserted into pocket D and forms hydrogen bonds with Glu 152 and Arg 155 . 157\n\nNotably, Glu 152 and Arg 155 are not conserved in most mammalian class I molecules, and both 158 of these residues are charged (Fig 2) . P3-Tyr is primarily surrounded by the residues Trp 97 , 159\n\nHis 99 , Tyr 156 and Tyr 159 , which have large side chains and provide a clear boundary to pocket D. 160\n\nThe small residue Ser 114 provides enough space in the pocket to accommodate the large side 161 chain of P3-Tyr (Fig 3) . The side chain of P4-Asn extends outward into the solvent for potential 162 recognition by TCRs. Different formations of hydrogen bonds between the PBG and the peptide 163 were also observed for peptide residues P3-Tyr and P4-Asn. 164\n\nPocket E is composed of residues Ser 114 , Gln 115 , Leu 116 , Trp 133 , Trp 147 and Glu 152 (Fig 2 and  165 Table 3). The pocket is obviously negatively charged and located relatively deep beneath the 166 \u03b12 helix, and residues Ser 114 , Gln 115 and Leu 116 constitute the bottom of platform. P7-Ser of 167 CCV-NGY9 is inserted into pocket E (Fig 3) . 168 Pocket F of pAime-128 PBG consists of the highly conserved residues Ala 117 , Tyr 118 , Tyr 123 , 169\n\nIle 124 , Thr 143 , Lys 146 and Trp 147 , as well as the poorly conserved residues Ala 73 , Phe 74 , Asp 77 , 170\n\nThr 80 , Ile 95 and Leu 116 (Fig 2) . Among these residues, Leu116 is not present in any other 171 annotated MHC class I molecule deposited in the Protein Data Bank (18, 19) . Pocket F is 172 therefore narrow but deep enough to accommodate large residues, and residues P8-Thr and P9-173 Phe are located in this pocket (Fig 3) . The anchor residue P9-Phe is similar to the anchor 174 residues of HLA-A*01, HLA-B*35, and HLA-B*57, i.e., large residues with an aromatic ring 175 (30). The aromatic ring in CCV-NGY9 is held in close contact with residues in pocket F by 176 strong hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts (Fig 3) . 177 .

These results suggest that the antigen-peptide presenting profiles of the panda individuals 181 are different, especially the homology of the \uf0611 region, which can be as low as approximately 182 57%; thus, the difference is large. The results also show the potential differences in pMHC-I 183 complexes among the bear family. It can be concluded that classical MHC-I binding antigen-184 peptide profiles of the bear family are diverse. 185\n\nStructure-based amino acid sequence analysis implied that MHC-I molecules may form 186 different PBGs in pandas. However, the amino acid composition of the A, B, C, D, E and F 187 pockets in the PBG was not identical among pandas, and the PBG regions of the pandas differed 188 extensively from those of other members of the bear family (Fig 3) . Of the ten conserved amino 189 acids in the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains of Aime-128 predicted to be critical for peptide binding (23) to have direct contact with the CCV-NGY9 peptide ( Table 3 ). In addition, the amino acid 192 composition of PBGs among other genera and members of the bear family is not completely 193 conserved, so there are some differences in pockets A to F. There are also great differences 194 among giant pandas; other members of the bear family; other mammals; such as humans and 195 mice; and nonmammals, such as the bony fish grass carp (Fig 3) . 196\n\nThe peptide binding to pAime-128 PBG used in a featured mode with a central bulge, as 198 revealed by unambiguous electron density (Fig 4A) . Extensive comparison of pAime-128 with 199 other pMHC-I structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank showed that the main chain of the 200 CCV-NGY9 peptide has a characteristic conformation similar to that presented by HLA-201 B*0801 (Fig 4B) . Ternary TCR-peptide-HLA-B*0801 structure of epitope HCV-HSK9 202 (HSKKKCDEL, hepatitis C virus-derived) showed that the protruding residue Lys-4 in HCV-203 HSK9 plays important roles in TCR recognition (31, 32). In pAime-128, the side chain of P6-204 Phe pointed upward for solvent exposure, similar to the side chain of Lys-4 in HCV-HSK9 ( Fig  205   4A and B) . 206 With different peptide presentation modes observed for pAime-128, it is necessary to clarify 207 the critical anchors for the peptide bound to Aime-128. Therefore, the stabilities of the CCV-208 NGY9 peptide and its mutants with alanine substitution at each position bound with Aime-128 209 were measured through circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Fig 4C and D) . The midpoint 210 transition temperature (Tm) value of the wild-type CCV-NGY9 peptide was determined to be 211 49.3\u00b0C. Compared with the CCV-NGY9 peptide, the CCV-P9A-substituted peptide showed a 212 dramatic decrease in stability with the lowest Tm at 39.4\u00b0C, while the peptide mutants CCV-213 P1A and CCV-P5A had lower Tms of 47.2\u00b0C and 47.4\u00b0C, respectively, indicating a minor 214 decrease in stability. The remaining peptide mutants showed different levels of enhanced 215 stability, with Tms ranging from 49.5\u00b0C to 54.8\u00b0C (Fig 4C and D) . These data indicated that 216 for peptides bound to Aime-128, P\u2126 plays a pivotal role in peptide anchoring since it cannot 217 be replaced by alanine. The peptide residues at the N terminus (PN) and position 5 (P5) are also 218 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Notably, the mutant CCV-P2A displayed the 219 highest Tm of 54.8\u00b0C, suggesting that the mutation of P2-G to comparatively large amino acids 220 might increase the stability of pAime-128 complexes. Based on this finding and the peptide 221 screening results (Table 1) showed that the AB loop of pAime-128 and other mammal pMHC-I structures does not contact 227 \u03b22m (Fig 5A-E) , whereas the AB loop binds \u03b22m via hydrogen bonds only in nonmammals 228 (Fig 5F, G) . Furthermore, the CD and EF loops of mammals are longer than those of 229 nonmammals (Fig 5A) , because mammalian MHC-I contains two more amino acids than 230 nonmammalian MHC-I (Fig 2) . 231 The antigenic peptides presented by pMHC-I complexes are eventually scanned and recognized 232 by TCRs to initiate MHC-I-restricted CD8 T cell immunity. Extensive structural studies have 233 illustrated that the TCR repertoire specific for a certain antigenic peptide is determined by the 234 conformations of both the peptide and the restricted MHC-I element (12, 33). Comparisons 235 with MHC-I structures with known TCR docking strategies revealed that the exposed Aime- Glu 166 and Trp 167 have great potential to interact with TCRs (Fig 6A) . Although most of these 238 residues are highly conserved or preferentially used among different species, rarely used 239 residues were observed in Aime-128, including Ile 66 , Asp 69 , Arg 155 and Asn 158 (Fig 2) . 240\n\npMHC-I molecules. The CD loop of Aime-128, encompassing residues 222-228, is believed to 242 be essential for CD8 interaction (34). Of particular note, the highly conserved residues Glu 222 243 and Gln 226 , which have been proven to directly contact CD8 (35), are also present in pAime-244 128. Interestingly, the distance between Glu 219 of pCtid-UAAg and Gln 226 of HLA-A*0201 is 245 approximately 12.4 \u00c5, and the distance between Gln 222 in BF2*0401 and Gln 226 of HLA-246 A*0201 is approximately 8.4 \u00c5. The distance between the superposed CD loops of pAime-128 247 and HLA-A*0201 is approximately 3.1 \u00c5 (Fig 6B) . 248\n\nThe amino acid sequences of the pathogenic viruses related to viral diseases reported in the 250 giant panda were obtained. Based on the 3D structure of pAime-128, the characteristics of 251 presentation of viral peptides, and the motif from the experiment, the potential viral CTL were screened against the panda MHC-I molecules. We obtained a total of 8 nonapeptides 258 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Although the result was rational calculated, it also fully 262 demonstrates the potential research value of pAime-128. 263 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

In this study, the 3D structure of giant panda classical MHC-I 267 complexed with viral peptide derived from CCV spike protein was determined for the first time, 268 and several unique features of panda pMHC-I were identified.. very different from one another (Fig 2) . The results suggest that the antigen-peptide presenting 276 profiles of the panda individuals are different, especially the homology of the \uf0611 region, which 277 can be as low as approximately 57%. This difference may be quite remarkable. Thus, the 278 classical MHC-I binding antigen-peptide profile of pandas is diverse. These findings indicate 279 the high-throughput antiviral CTL immune response potential of Ursidae. 280 A second notable finding is that in the PBG pockets, the 9 residues constituting pocket A can 281 be found in most giant panda MHC-I molecules, though 2 residues, Asn 63 and Glu 163 , are rare 282 among known MHC-I molecules. Due to the presence of the Asn 63 residue, the pAime-128 283 complex pocket A is reasonably tight. The 8 residues that constitute pocket B can be found in 284 almost all classical panda MHC-I molecules, although Asn 63 , Ile 66 , Ala 67 and His 99 are rare 285 among known panda MHC-I molecules. Moreover, 5 residues constitute pocket C, but these 286 residues are not highly conserved in mammalian MHC-I molecules (2). Similarly, 5 residues 287 constitute pocket D, but Glu 152 and Arg 155 are not conserved. Therefore, although some amino 288 acids are highly conserved in the composition of certain pockets, the different amino acids result 289 in distinctive pocket conformations and a unique pAime-128 PBG for presenting viral epitope 290 peptides with specific characteristics. Due to pAime-128, the polymorphism of amino acid 291 sequences is easily reflected in its 3D structure, which is also important for studying pMHC-I 292 complexes. In addition, the amino acid composition of PBGs among other genera and members 293 of the bear family is not completely conservative, so there are some differences in A to F pockets. 294\n\nThere are also great differences between giant pandas and other members of the bear family. 295\n\nThe results also reveal the characteristics of the pMHC-I complexes of pandas and other 296 members of the bear family and differences between them in their viral antigen-presenting 297 peptide profiles. 298 Furthermore, by analyzing the structure of pAime-128 and comparing it with the structures of 299 other known pMHC-Is, we found that the viral peptide in PBG features the \"M\" configuration 300 that can activate T cells (45) and that key for recognition by TCR is the combination of the 301 peptide P4-Asn and P6-Phe amino acids. Through analysis of the pockets in the PBG and the 302 stability of CCV-NGY9 peptide and its alanine substitution mutant determined by CD 303 spectroscopy, we identified the peptide-binding motif of pAime-128 and obtained a series of 304 .

In addition, the viral peptide presentation profile was proposed in this 309 paper. These results provide a new platform for the further study of bear family antiviral CTL 310 immunology and vaccinology. 311 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

AFG19726.1), the CDV hemagglutinin (H) 316 protein (GenBank accession no. AAD54600.1), CPV virus protein 1 (VP1) (GenBank accession 317 no. AAV36771.1) and the H7N9 influenza A virus (GenBank accession no. AGI60301.1). 318\n\nThese peptides were synthesized and purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid 319 chromatography (HPLC) (SciLight Biotechnology, Beijing, China) with >90% purity. The 320 peptides were stored in lyophilized aliquots at -20\u00b0C after synthesis and were dissolved in 321 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) before use. 322 inclusion bodies and purified as previously described (29). Complexes of the CCV-NGY9 330 peptide with Aime-128 and Aime-\u03b22m (pAime-128) were prepared with refolding assays using 331 the gradual dilution method, as previously described (18). After 48 hours of incubation at 4\u00b0C, 332 the remaining soluble portion of the complex was concentrated and then purified by 333 chromatography on a Superdex200 16/60 column followed by Resource-Q anion-exchange 334 chromatography (GE Healthcare), as described previously (18). 335\n\nThe thermostabilities of Aime-128 with nine peptides were tested by CD spectroscopy. CD 337 spectra were measured at 20\u00b0C on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a water-338 circulating cell holder. The protein concentration was 0.1 mg/mL in pH 8.0 Tris buffer (20 mM 339\n\nTris and 50 mM NaCl). Thermal denaturation curves were determined by monitoring the CD 340 value at 218 nm using a 1-mm optical-path-length cell as the temperature was raised from 25 341 to 80\u00b0C at a rate of 1\u00b0C/min. The temperature of the sample solution was directly measured 342 with a thermistor. The fraction of unfolded protein was calculated from the mean residue 343 ellipticity (\u03b8) using a standard method. The unfolded fraction (%) is expressed as (\u03b8-\u03b8N)/ (\u03b8U-344 \u03b8N), where \u03b8N and \u03b8U are the mean residue ellipticity values in the fully folded and fully unfolded 345 states, respectively. The midpoint transition temperature (Tm) was determined by fitting the data 346 to the denaturation curves using the Origin 8.0 program (OriginLab) as described previously 347 (39). Based on the CD spectroscopy results, the nonapeptide binding motifs of Aime-128 were 348 extrapolated from potential CTL epitopes of viruses detected from giant panda (36). 349\n\n.

Index 353 Kits (Hampton Research, Riverside, CA) were used to screen the crystals. After several days, 354 pAime-128 crystals were obtained with Index solution 55 (30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 355 0.05 M magnesium chloride hexahydrate and 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.5)). Diffraction data were 356 collected using an in-house X-ray source (Rigaku MicroMax007 desktop rotating anode X-ray 357 generator with a Cu target operated at 40 kV and 30 mA) and an R-Axis IV imaging-plate 358 detector at a wavelength of 0.97892 \u00c5. In each case, the crystal was first soaked in reservoir 359 solution containing 25% glycerol as a cryoprotectant for several seconds and then flash-cooled 360 in a stream of gaseous nitrogen at 100 K (40). The collected intensities were indexed, integrated, 361 corrected for absorption, scaled, and merged using the HKL2000 package (41). 362\n\nThe structure of pAime-128 was solved by molecular replacement using the MOLREP program 364 with HLA-B*5101 (PDB code, 1E27) as the search model. Extensive model building was 365 performed by hand using COOT (42), and restrained refinement was performed using 366 REFMAC5. Further rounds of refinement were performed using the phenix refine program 367 implemented in the PHENIX package (43) with isotropic ADP refinement and bulk solvent 368 modeling. The stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed with the PROCHECK 369 program (44).The data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table 2 . 370\n\nPeptide-contacting residues were identified using the program CONTACT and were defined as 372 residues containing an atom within 3.3 \u00c5 of the target partner. Structural illustrations and 373 electron density-related Figs were generated using the PyMOL molecular graphics system 374 H.Y. performed the experiments; H.Y., L.M. and L.Z. analyzed the data and wrote the paper; 387 X.L. provided constructive suggestions; and C.X. designed and supervised the study. All 388 authors critically revised the manuscript and gave their final approval of the version to be 389 submitted. 390 reflection h. 623 c R factor = \u03a3 (Fobs-Fcalc)/ \u03a3Fobs; Rfree is the R factor for a subset (5%) of reflections that was 624 selected prior to refinement calculations and not included in the refinement. 625 626 .
