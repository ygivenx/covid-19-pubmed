{"title": "METERIALS AND METHODS MHV preparation", "body": "centrifugation for 5 min at 21,130 \u00d7 g. The aged RNPs were prepared by placing the purified RNPs at 4 degree for about one week. The intact MHV particles, fresh purified and aged RNPs were analyzed using 12% SDS-PAGE gels and EM.\n\nFor negative staining specimen preparation, 4 microliters of samples were applied onto a glow discharged continuous carbon grid (Beijing XinxingBraim Technology Co., Ltd.). After waiting for approximate 1 minute to let the grid adsorb enough materials, excess sample was blotted away from the grid with filter paper. The grid was immediately washed twice with 1% uranyl acetate (UA) solution and was then incubated with the UA solution for additional 1 min. The UA solution was completely removed with filter paper and the grids were air-dried at room temperature.\n\nFor cryo-EM specimen preparation, 3 microliters of samples were applied onto a glow discharged continuous carbon grid with a layer of continuous ultrathin carbon film (TED PELLA, INC.). Each grid was blotted for 9-11 s, plunged into liquid ethane using a Gatan Cryoplunge 3 System. Cryo-EM specimens and the negative staining specimens of the purified aged RNP were examined under an FEI Tecnai F20 electron microscope equipped with an FEG filament. The microscope was operating at 200-kV acceleration voltage, using a nominal magnification of 62,000 \u00d7 (pixel size: 0.135 nm). Negative staining specimens of the fresh purified RNPs were examined under an FEI Tecnai Spirit Bio-Twin electron microscope equipped with a LaB 6 filament operating at 120 kV acceleration voltage. All images were recorded using Gatan 895 4 k \u00d7 4 k CCD cameras with an exposure dose of 20-30 e -/\u00c5 2 . The defocus range used was -1 \u03bcm to -3.5 \u03bcm.\n\nCryo-EM tomographic tilt series were collected with an FEI Titan Krios microscope equipped with a Falcon\u2161 camera at a pixel size of 0.29 nm. The FEI tomography software was used for the data collection. Each tilt series covered an angular range from -64\u00b0 to 64\u00b0 with a tilt step of 2\u00b0. The defocus range used was -4 um to -6 um. The total dose was about 110 e -/\u00c5 2 for each tilt series.\n\nFor the negative staining images of the purified aged RNP, 24,826 particles from 55 micrographs were boxed using the EMAN2 program e2boxer.py (Tang et al., 2007 ).\n\nThe initial model was generated by the EMAN2 python script e2initialmodel.py and low-pass filtered to 60\u00c5. Reference-free 2D class averages were performed by using EMAN2 and RELION1.4 (Scheres, 2012) . Particles of bad class averages were discarded and 22,060 good particles were used for the 3D auto-refinement. To validate the accuracy of the reconstructions, we did the refinement and reconstruction with both EMAN2 and RELION1.4 using the same low-pass filtered initial model and same particle dataset. Both 3D refinements were performed following a ''gold standard'' procedure, wherein the raw data were randomly divided into two subsets that were then refined independently. The resolution was 25 \u00c5 at Fourier shell correlation value 0.5 and 19 \u00c5 at Fourier shell correlation value 0.143. Docking of the crystal structures into 3D reconstruction map was performed in UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) .\n\nParticle boxing and reference-free 2D class average analyzes of the fresh purified RNPs were performed using the EMAN2 software package. 3D density maps were visualized using UCSF Chimera.\n\nThe tomographic data were processed with the software Protomo (Noble and Stagg, 2015) . The tilt series images were aligned for several iterations and then the aligned images were back-projected to generate the 3D reconstructions. The tomograms were denoised by band-pass filtering and virtualized using the software IMOD (Kremer et al., 1996) .\n\nFor tilt-pair validation experiment, data were collected at 0\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 tilt angles for each region of the grid, using an FEI Tecnai Spirit Bio-Twin electron microscope equipped with a LaB 6 filament and operated at 120-kV acceleration voltage at a pixel size of 0.16 nm. A total of 39 particle pairs were used for the validation test. The EMAN2 reconstruction density map was scaled to the same pixel size and the same boxsize as those of the tilt-pair images before it was used as the validation reference.\n\nThe tilt-pair validation test was performed using the EMAN2 python script e2tiltvalidate.py. About 17 of the 39 particle pairs were inside the red cycle around the corresponding angle (~44%)."}
