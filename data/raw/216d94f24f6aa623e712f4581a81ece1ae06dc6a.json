{"title": "the Science of the Total Environment Pathology and toxicology of beluga whales from the St. Lawrence Estuary, Quebec, Canada. Past, present and future", "body": "The St. Lawrence River Estuary is inhabited by the southernmost population of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas). This population has dwindled from an estimated 5000 animals to the current estimated 450-500 [1] ; it is unique by its small size, geographical isolation, and relative accessibility. The confinement of this population to a basin heavily contaminated by industrial pollutants, the long life span of the species (25-30 years) comparable to that of man, and its life-long exposure to industrial contaminants through diet all contribute to make the St. Lawrence beluga whale population an extraordinary opportunity to demonstrate the impact of chronic exposure to industrial and agricultural contaminants on higher mammals.\n\nThe population and the area it inhabits have been the object of extensive scientific scrutiny for a decade; as a result, the toxicological, pathological and social profiles of this population have been characterized and are currently being refined [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Stranded carcasses are highly contaminated with organohalogens [6] and benzo[a]pyrene DNA adducts have been detected in the brain of some whales [7, 13] . Post-mortem examination of these carcasses has revealed a high prevalence of opportunistic infections suggestive of immunosuppression [7] . In addition, several lesions such as squamous metaplasia of mammary glands, and gastric ulcers, consistent with organohalogen toxicity, have been reported [7, 14, 15] . Squamous metaplasia of mammary glfinds, without concurrent parasitic infestation, has been observed in another population of cetaceans contaminated with PCBs and an etiological association with PCB toxicity has been also suggested in these animals [16] .\n\nThe Great Lakes basin is probably one of the best studied ecosystems heavily contaminated by industrial pollutants. The St Lawrence River and Estuary are the end point of that basin and constitute a major link between the North American continent and the North Atlantic waters. The sediments and several aquatic animals of this region have been found to be contaminated by heavy metals such as mercury and lead, by poly-cyclic aromatic compounds (PAH) and by organohalogen compounds, among which DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are prominent [6, 7, 10, 11, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . PCB concentrations found in the tissues of some birds and fish are similar to those found in the Great Lakes [27] . Some PCBs are stable and, because of this stability, have persisted in the environment a long time after their production was banned in 1972. Large amounts remain in use in heavy power equipment, at least in the USA. Even larger quantities have been buried in landfills or dumped at sea, e.g. an estimated 240 million kg of PCBs have been dumped into landfills, up to 1972 [28] .\n\nFrom January 1983 to December 1990, marine mammal mortalities were reported by a network of volunteer and casual observers. Fresh carcasses were transported on ice to the facilities of the Department of Pathology, Faculte de M6decine V6t6rinaire de l'Universit6 de Montr6al. Age of the whales was determined by counting dentine growth layers on longitudinal section of teeth [29] , adopting the standard of two dentine growth layers per year [30] .\n\nLesions and tissues were cultured on blood agar, incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 10% CO 2 atmosphere and examined after 48 h. Identification of bacteria was carried out with an Analytical profile Index diagnostic kit (Analytab Products, Ayerst Laboratories, Plainview, NY). For culture of potential Vibrio sp., tissue samples were placed on trypticase soy agar (BBL, Cockeysville, MD) with 5% bovine blood and MacConkey agar; the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Samples of all major organs and lesions were preserved in neutral 10% formalin and fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned 5 /xm thick and routinely stained with haematoxylin-phloxin-saffron. Special stains were used when necessary.\n\nControl tissue was obtained from beluga whales killed by native hunters in Nastapooka, Eastern Hudson Bay, and in Eskimo Point, Western Hudson Bay, Pangnirtung, Baffin Island and in Grise Fjord, EUesmere Island. Tissues were obtained from a captive beluga whale at the Vancouver Aquarium which presumably died of anaphylactic shock.\n\nOrganochlorines (OC) Analyses were carried out at the Centre d'Oc6anologie de Rimouski (RKI) and at Freshwater Institute, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Winnipeg (WPG). Briefly, a wet sample (5-20 g) was homogenized with a Virtis blender (20000 rev./min) in a glass container. After adding sodium sulphate to completely absorb tissue humidity, the sample was extracted three times in an ultrasonic bath with 100 ml of a 50:50 hexane/dichloromethane mixture. Extracts were combined, reduced to 3-4 cc, and purified on a molecular Bio-beads SX3 (Biorad) sieve as described to eliminate lipids and other large undesired molecules, and finally purified on a silicon column [31] . Quantitation and identification of PCBs were done by gas chromatography on a DB5 capillary column with a flame ionization detector, and confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.\n\nTime trends in contaminant levels were discussed by comparing data from this study with samples collected from the same population in 1982-1987 and analyzed at a third laboratory, Laboratoire Capitaine Bernier, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Longueuil (LGL) [6] . Samples from nine animals were sent to two laboratories, WPG and LGL. Both produced similar results for DDT and metabolites but the LGL laboratory consistently returned higher values (by an average factor of 1.47) for total PCBs as these were assessed on the basis of a mixed Aroclor 1254:1260 standard, as opposed to the summation of individual congener peaks done at WPG. For the purpose of time trend analysis, we adopted a procedure similar to that used by others [32] and we reduced the data for 1983-85, measured at LGL, by a factor of 1.47.\n\nThe analysis of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) adducts was carried out at RKI [33] . The methodology was adapted from Shugart et al. 1983 as summarized below [34] . Extraction and purification: 100-200 mg of tissue were homogenized in 3 ml of NH4OH (1 N) and put into a glass tube containing 10 mg of a pronase solution buffered with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 20 mM NaC1, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1% laurylsulfate. This solution was agitated and incubated for 4 h at 50\u00b0C, transferred to a screw-cap centrifugation tube with 1 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH 8), and extracted with 3 ml of a 24:1:25 (v/v) chloroform/isoamyl alcohol/phenol mixture (CIP) in a rotating agitator for 30 min. Phases were separated by centrifugation (Beckman model J21-C) at 4\u00b0C for 5 min at 1000 rev./min.\n\nThe aqueous phase was re-extracted with 3 ml of CIP and stored in the dark. The two CIP phases were then combined and extracted three times at room temperature, always with 1.5 ml of ethyl ether, and twice with 1.5 ml of ethyl acetate. Phases were separated by centrifugation after each extraction to eliminate the organic phase. For every ml of aqueous solution retrieved (about 14 ml), 177/~1 of spermine tetrahydrochloride was added. The solution was vigorously agitated and left aside for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. The DNA precipitate was recovered through 30 min at 10000 rev./min centrifugation at 4\u00b0C and resuspended for 30 min at 80\u00b0C in 1 ml of 50 mM NaC1 buffered with sodium phosphate (5 mM, pH 7.1). The contents were transferred into a polypropylene microtube for a second spermine precipitation.\n\nDNA was recovered after 10 min of 11000 rev./min centrifugation (Beckman Microfuge B) at room temperature. The precipitate was washed three times with 1 ml sodium acetate (0.3 M) and magnesium acetate (10 mM) solution containing 75% ethanol. The DNA precipitate was resuspended in the phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) with 50 mM of NaCI and stored at 4\u00b0C. A 180-/.d aliquot of the DNA solution was transferred into a polypropylene microtube; 10 ~1 of 1.2 N HCI were added and the mixture heated at 80\u00b0C for 6 h. The hydrolysed DNA sample was diluted to 3 ml with 20% methanol and passed through a Sep-Pak C18 microcolumn preactivated with 6 ml of deionized water. The microcolumn was washed twice with 3 ml of 20% methanol, tetrols were recovered with 2 ml of 100% methanol, and sample volume was reduced to 0.5 ml and immediately submitted to high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\nDNA quantitation. 100 /.tl of the DNA suspension was added to a reaction tube containing 100 ttl of 25 mM NaC1, 5 /xl of SDS (0.2% in 2 mM EDTA), 3 ml of the potassium phosphate (0.2 M, pH 6.9) buffer and 3 /xl of Hoechst 33258 (1 mg/ml) stain. The solution was mixed in a Vortex mixer and kept in the dark for 15 min. Sample fluorescence was measured in a Perkin Elmer MPF-44A spectrofluorometer. The DNA standard solution was prepared from calf thymus DNA.\n\nAdduct quan@cation. Purified adducts were separated and quantified by HPLC, using a Waters 610 data pump and a Waters 470 fluorescence detector operated with a Waters 600E flow control coupled to a Waters 746 data recorder. A C18 Guard Pak precolumn and a C18 (150 x 3.9 mm) Nova Pak column were used, with flow set at 1 ml/min and temperature maintained at 50\u00b0C by an Eldex column heater. After injection, elution was done in isocratic mode with a 50% methanol mixture in water (v/v). Tetrol (benzo[alpyrene tetrahydrotetrol) standards were obtained from the Midwest Research Institute, MI as an entirely water soluble white powder. Each standard was prepared so as to obtain a standard reference curve between zero and 100 pg per 15 ttl of injected solution.\n\nAccounting for the 3 winter months during which stranded carcasses are not reported (12 months/9 months as correction factor) and for the carcasses found dead but not examined in the post-mortem room, the total number of animals dead with cancer over 8 years (ETC) (1983-1990) would be:\n\nAnimals with cancer\n\nx Total mortality Examined animals 12 months x 9months =ETC\n\nFrom 1983 to 1990, 120 animals were found dead from which 99 were aged by counting dentine layers and from which 45 were examined in the Department of Pathology of the Facult6 de M~decine V6t6rinaire, Saint-Hyacinthe. The crude annual mortality rate is thus 120/8 = 15 dead animals per year. This number is a strict minimum since no carcasses are recovered in winter (3 months) and most likely some carcasses are not recovered during the rest of the year. The adjusted annual (12-month) mortality rate, accounting for winter months, is 20 animals (15/9 x 12) ( Table 1) .\n\nMost likely our sample is representative of the population. This study has been carried out over the last 10 years. Considering the life span of beluga whales (30 years), all whales that were over 20 years old in 1983 have died since. The Table 1 Total mortality of St. Lawrence beluga whales (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) Only cases that were confirmed histopathologically were included in this study. The crude annual incidence rate for cancer per 100000 animals (CAR) was roughly estimated by dividing the number of cancer cases by 8 years (1983-1990) , by 500 whales (the total population) and by multiplying by 100000.\n\nDuration of study 100 000 animals x Total population = CAR Group 1983 Group 1984 Group 1985 Group 1986 Group 1987 Group 1988 Group 1989 Group 1990 Total   Aged a 11  10  13  9  9  16  17  14  99  Not  aged b 5  2  2  1  2  5  3  1  21  Total  16  12  15  10  11  21  20 15 120 aAging was carried out by counting dentine layers of sectioned teeth.\n\nbSome animals were not aged for various reasons: (1) the carcass had no teeth; (2) the head was not with the body or teeth were damaged; (3) only pictures were obtained and/or the carcass was identified by reliable observers. chances of these carcasses being found and examined are even because thorough surveys from airplanes and boats have shown that these whales live in a restricted range. All carcasses have been found within that range or downstream, as a result of drift [35] [36] [37] .\n\nIn winter, the range of the whales is expanded further downstream into the Gull During that period, when climatic conditions are harsher, carcasses are not recovered. However, out of the 120 carcasses, 11 animals were found in early spring (mid-April-mid-May), four of these were necropsied and seven were analyzed for contaminants. These animals showed conditions and contaminant levels not different from those of animals found during the rest of the year (data not shown). In addition, animals weakened by old age and/or chronic diseases such as cancer would be expected to die in higher numbers in winter, and thus the cancer prevalence reported here would be underestimated.\n\nAge structure of stranded animals\n\nThe age structure of 99 belugas that could be aged is given in Fig. 1 .\n\nThe digestive system was the major site of non-neoplastic lesions (14/45 animals with gastric ulceration (31%), three with oral ulcers (7%). In contrast with Arctic animals in which the number of teeth range from 25 to 44, 38 of 73 St. Lawrence animals (52%) in which the teeth were enumerated had less than 25 teeth (Fig. 2) . Fifteen animals (33%) were affected by pneumonia. Milk production was compromised in eight of 17 mature females (41%) by inflammatory changes (seven animals) and cancer (one animal) which affected mammary glands. Opportunistic bacteria were found in pure culture, and/or in significant amounts in at least two organs in 20 belugas (44%).\n\nThere has been no epidemiological study of cancer in specific populations of marine mammals. To determine disease rate in a population, the population at risk must be determined precisely. Marine mammal populations are notoriously ill-defined and/or widespread. The St.\n\nLawrence beluga whale population stands as an exception in this regard since it is well characterized and has been geographically isolated for 10 000 years.\n\nThis whale population has been the object of numerous censuses, many of which have been carried out by different techniques [35] [36] [37] . All censuses have provided remarkably similar resuits, defining precisely the population at risk and thus the denominator used to determine the crude annual rate. Here we compare the cancer rate of St. Lawrence beluga whales to the cancer rate in other animals, including man ( Table 3) .\n\nNine animals with 10 malignant tumours (cancers) were recorded over an 8-year period (1983-1990 ) ( \n\nThus, 10-32 beluga whales are expected to have died with cancer from 1983 to 1990, an expected CAR of 225-800 animals with cancer per 100 000 animals, respectively. The populations of domestic species used in epidemiologic studies are animals examined at Veterinary Colleges [38] . These animals are probably under better medical care than the general population and include more sick animals than the general animal population. Advances in veterinary medicine have resulted in more older animals in the population of pet animals [39] . Free-ranging wild animals generally have a shorter life span than captives because of predation, harsh environmental conditions, and malnutrition. Since the risk of developing cancer increases with age, it is reasonable that cancer rates in pet animals would be higher than in free-ranging mammals [40] . Yet, the CAR in our whales is slightly higher than that observed in cattle, and the upper limit of our estimate is similar to the rate observed in dogs. The upper figure for the estimated crude annual incidence of cancer in beluga whales (800/100000) is higher than that for man. This whale population appears to be affected by a disproportionately high prevalence of cancer. It has to be pointed out that 39% of all tumours reported in cetaceans have been found in St. Lawrence beluga whales, a population of 500 animals [41] .\n\nWe found two intestinal adenocarcinomas. This figure corresponds to a crude annual incidence rate of 50 cases/100000 whales over the whole study ( Table 3 ). Cancers of the small intestine are rare in man and in all domestic animals except in sheep. In the latter, high prevalences (0.2-1.58% of slaughtered sheep) exist in some regions of the world where environmental carcinogens, particularly phenoxy and picolinic acid herbicides, are thought to be a major cause [42] .\n\nTwo out of the 10 malignant tumours originated from the ovaries. This incidence is higher compared to other animal species except in women where ovarian cancer accounts for 6% of all human cancers if skin cancer is excluded (Table 3). \n\nThe digestive system of beluga whales was more often affected by malignant tumours than that of most domestic animals. Four out of a total of 10 (40%) malignant tumours originated from it. This prevalence resembles that of man where most malignant tumours of the digestive tract occur in the colon and rectum (but rarely in the small intestine) ( Table 4 ). (Figs. 3,4) [6]: a logarithmic increase with age, and marked differences between sexes. Data from the later period have higher standard deviations, especially in females, suggesting that this population is more heterogeneous. The data base on PCB levels in St. Lawrence beluga whales, now spanning more than 8 years, suggests a slight progressive decrease in average PCB concentrations in males (Fig. 3) . The observed differences between regressions for 1982-1985 and 1985-1987 (t = 0.167; P > 0.10), and between regressions for 1982-1985 and 1988-1990 (t = 0.732; P > 0.10), are not statistically significant.\n\nBenzo[a]pyrene is one of the most powerful chemical carcinogens known by man. This compound has been repeatedly detected in the sediments of the region inhabited by the St. Lawrence beluga whales. The sediments of the Saguenay River contain 500-4500 ppb of PAH (dry wt.) [21] . We have previously demonstrated that there has been a significant interaction between benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and the whale genomic DNA [13, 33, 43] .\n\nIt is generally assumed that most carcinogenic chemicals, or their metabolites, act through covalent binding to DNA. The measure of specific DNA adducts is an accepted means of assessing the degree of interaction between a carcinogen and DNA [44] . DNA adducts resulting from specific exposure to B[a]P were detected in eight of the nine St. Lawrence belugas tested. Adducts were present in six liver tissue samples and in seven of eight brain tissue samples (Table 5 ). Adduct levels (35-3290 ng/g DNA) in samples where DNA recovery was adequate were higher and more variable than in previous samples (69-206 ng/g DNA) from three animals recovered in 1986 and analyzed at another laboratory [7] . The above data were obtained at two different laboratories, each using one of two methods. A series of analyses at a single laboratory comparing both methods would allow for a more complete interpretation of the observed differences. In comparison, B[a]P DNA adducts were not detected in brain and liver from four Arctic whales (Mackenzie estuary) [13] . Ample evidence that organohalogens have detrimental effects on the immune system of man and animals has been collected over the past two decades. These compounds alter the functions of both arms of the immune system, the cell-mediated immunity and the humoral immunity. LGL, WPG and RKI Laboratories).\n\n2,3,7,8,-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), the most immunotoxic compound, induces thymic atrophy in laboratory animals [45] [46] [47] [48] . PCBs, and most notably the coplanar congeners, have similar albeit less severe effects: they cause lymphoid depletion in chicks [47] , reduce natural cell cytotoxicity in rat [49, 50] , decrease the number of T cells and the T helper/T suppressor cells ratio in non-human primates [51] and reduce T cell mediated c3ztotoxic activity in mice [48] . PCBs decrease antibody production in response to injection of sheep red blood cells (SRBC) in PCBs-treated mice and non-human primates [51] [52] [53] . The reduction of serum IgA levels seems to be a consistent component of PCB immunotoxicity [52, 54, 55] . B cells, and particularly B cell differentiation, are emerging as important targets for halogenated hydrocarbons [45] . In addition, levels of serum corticosteroid, which have a powerful suppressive effect on the immune system and more specifically on T lymphocytes, are altered by PCBs [48, 56, 57] . Metabolites of PCB are also immunotoxic; chlorinated diphenyl ethers, found in fish from the Great Lakes, decrease significantly the number of circulating lymphocytes in male rats [58] .\n\nNot surprisingly, organohalogens decrease the resistance of laboratory animals to a wide variety of infectious agents: gram-negative bacteria [53, 54] , protozoa [54] and viruses [59] [60] [61] . Viruses whose virulence is enhanced by organohalogens include RNA viruses such as duck hepatitis virus (picornavirus) [61] , murine leukemia virus (retrovirus) [62] , and mouse hepatitis virus (coronavirus) [63] and DNA viruses such as Herpes simplex and ectromelia (Poxvirus) [59] . The complement system, a non-specific defense system against infectious agents, is also altered by PCBs [64] . Immunotoxicity resulting from chronic exposure to organohalogens has been demonstrated in laboratory and domestic animals but little information exists on free-ranging animals in this regard and data concerning cetaceans are not available. In the past years, reports on stranded cetaceans have appeared in the veterinary literature where organohalogen-induced immunosuppression has been suspected, based on morphological findings and on the observation of opportunistic infections [7, 16, 65] . However, there have been no systematic efforts to evaluate the impact of pollutants on the immune functions of these animals even though the available data suggest that such an impact might be substantial (tissue concentrations of coplanar PCB congeners, the most toxic PCBs isomers, are higher in cetaceans than in terrestrial animals [66] ).\n\nSeveral reports deal with the histology of lymphoid organs in some species of pinnipeds [67, 68] . Antigenic stimulation causes proliferation of lymphocytes and thus hypercellularity of lymph nodes. The absence of antigenic stimulation, like that observed in gnotobiotic animals born by caesarian and kept in germ-free environments, leads to a relative paucity of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes [69] [70] [71] . The lymph nodes of pinnipeds from Southern California, an environment highly contaminated with germs, were unexpectedly hypocellular whereas the lymph nodes of Northern fur seals which inhabit the Arctic were more cellular. Since Arctic pinnipeds live in a relatively pristine environment, they are exposed to weaker antigenic stimulations and their lymph nodes were expected to be hypocellular. It has been hypothesized that industrial contaminants caused this hypocellularity [65] .\n\nThe lack of data regarding PCB-induced immunotoxicity in marine mammals is particularly unfortunate considering (1) that catastrophic viral epidemics have recently affected several populations of marine mammals, all highly contaminated with organohalogens [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] . A possible contribution of organohalogens to these viral epizootics has been suggested, based on the diminished resistance to viral infections induced by organohalogens in other animals [77] ; (2) that information on the impact of organohalogens on higher marine life is currently absent from the political and scientific debate on offshore dumping; (3) that considerable efforts and money are invested by individuals and organizations for the rehabilitation of stranded marine mammals whereas the underlying causes for these strandings remain unknown, and finally (4) the endangered status of the St. Lawrence beluga whales [78] and the potential disastrous effects that a viral epidemic would have on this population.\n\nBecause we have diagnosed infections consistent with immunosuppression in these animals, we have undertaken a research project to compare the immune functions of St. Lawrence beluga whales to those of less contaminated Arctic populations.\n\nWorldwide, cheetah populations have suffered severe contraction in a short time (population bottleneck). The resulting inbreeding has led to genetically identical individuals. Genetic identity is manifested by the identity of MHC molecules between unrelated cheetahs demonstrated by the lack of rejection of skin transplants [79] [80] [81] . Also, probably due to this monoclonality, cheetahs are homogeneously susceptible to some strains of coronaviruses (coronaviruses cause feline infectious petitonitis) that do not seem virulent for other felidae.\n\nPreliminary results obtained by restriction analysis of beluga whale DNA indicate that St. Lawrence beluga whales are genetically more homogeneous than Mackenzie (Canadian Arctic) beluga whales [82] . We hypothesize that the loss of genetic diversity at the MHC locus may be a feature of the St. Lawrence beluga whale popula-tion since, like cheetahs, this population has suffered a drastic reduction over a short time.\n\nDetection of oxidative DNA damage. Cancer is one of the ultimate outcomes of genomic DNA damage. It is certainly the most apparent, but unfortunately (for the ecoepidemiologist), it is a rare event and it has a long latency. The development of a solid tumor requires 15-20 years after exposure to a genotoxic compound. Obviously earlier indicators for DNA damage are necessary.\n\nDetection of DNA adducts reflects structural alteration of DNA. However, DNA adducts have a short life and thus their presence reflects only recent exposure. In addition, covalent binding of the chemical or its metabolites to DNA is only one of many ways by which genotoxic contaminants damage DNA. Another mechanism is through microsomal formation of free radicals that can break DNA molecules directly and/or oxidize DNA bases, particularly guanine which is then 8-hydroxylated. Detection of 8-hydroxyguanine in DNA measures oxidative damage in vitro. In vivo, exonucleases release the altered base and the resulting water soluble 8-hydroxydeoguanosine (8 OHdG) is excreted (and detected) into urine. The analysis of urine from marine mammals exposed to PAH might demonstrate the presence of this metabolite [83] .\n\nOther non-invasive methods of measuring DNA damage have been successfully used in humans. Researchers have looked for increased mutation rates in human blood cells secondary to exposure to carcinogens; the proportion of peripheral blood T lymphocytes that have undergone mutations which render them defective for hypoxanthineguanine phophoribosyltransferase (HPRT) reflects the number of mutations presumably induced by carcinogens [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] . These methods have an enormous potential in marine mammals since they allow the use of easily accessible biologic material (blood, urine) without sacrificing the animals.\n\nGross non-specific DNA alterations. If DNA damage caused by genotoxins is not repaired and/or if damage overwhelms repair mechanisms, the damage may be reflected as variability in the DNA content of affected cells. This variability can be detected by flow cytometry using DNA binding fluorochrome. For instance, hyperdiploid DNA was demonstrated by flow cytometry in hepatocytes from fish from a polluted site while hepatocytes of fish from a reference site had a normal DNA content [90] .\n\nSpecific DNA damage detected in tumours. Further characterization of DNA damage might be carried out in tumours suspected to have been induced by chemical carcinogens. Spontaneous mutations in genomic DNA are due to the methylation of cytosine in the dinucleotide CpG. The resulting 5-methylcytosine can deaminate spontaneously to thymine causing G:T mismatches which are not always repaired and result in characteristic C to T transitions at CpG sites. This spontaneous mutation leads to 'background mutations' present throughout the genome in all animals.\n\nThe p53 tumor suppressor gene is the gene most often altered in human cancer and mutations are distributed over large regions of the gene and include transitions, transversions, and deletions. The variety of site and type of damage found in p53 is explained by the fact that random mutations in tumor suppressor genes are sufficient to inactivate these genes and trigger cancer development. Not surprisingly, DNA from human tumours often show (spontaneous) mutations at a cytosine in dinucleotides CpG randomly distributed in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. This pattern of mutation is found in colon cancer, leukemia, and sarcoma, all tumours that are believed to be truly 'spontaneous'. In contrast, mutations do not follow this pattern of distribution in small cell lung cancers, tumours that are believed to be caused by chemical carcinogens [91] . Similar findings might be obtained from the analysis of tumor DNA in marine mammals. In populations not exposed to chemical carcinogens, most mutations found in spontaneous tumours will most likely affect cytosine in the dinucleotide CpG. In populations exposed to carcinogens, examination of DNA from tumours might reveal that mutations occur at sites that are specific for a given carcinogen.\n\nWe have demonstrated the presence of power-ful carcinogens in St. Lawrence beluga whale tissue along with a high prevalence of tumours. This association suggests a causal relationship between these compounds and cancer. Unfortunately, the number of animals affected with cancer is very small and our findings must be interpreted with caution. The small number of cases is not surprising considering the small size of the population under study and considering that cancer as a result of exposure to carcinogens is a low frequency end point. Convincing statistics would require much larger numbers of animals or the follow-up of this population for many more decades. These are problems which have long been recognized by cancer epidemiologists [92] . The observation of high cancer prevalences in other cetacean populations similarly exposed to carcinogens would considerably strengthen a link with chemical carcinogenesis [93] . Unfortunately, there are only a few concurrent studies of pathologic conditions and tissue contaminant levels in cetacean populations. For these reasons, we stress the importance of undertaking post-mortem inspection of carcasses of marine mammals analyzed for toxic compounds.\n\nIn addition, earlier consequences of exposure, more common than cancer, must be used to assess genomic damage by carcinogens. Evidence for genotoxic damage must be gathered: such evidence includes the detection of DNA adducts by the highly sensitive but not very specific 32p postlabeling technique, the detection of benzo[a]pyrene adducts, the demonstration of high rates of mutations, the presence of unusual mutation patterns, and the demonstration of altered DNA content. Applying these techniques would present relevant information on biodosimetry and estimation of cancer initiation in marine mammal populations exposed to chemical carcinogens [94] ."}
