{"title": "", "body": "\u2022 Kittens appear healthy and vigorous at birth. The fading syndrome develops when an underlying medical problem results in poor nursing, hypoglycemia and hypothermia. Signs of the fading syndrome include: \u2022 Loss of suckling reflex. \u2022 Weight loss. \u2022 Weakness and inactivity. \u2022 Bloated abdomen. \u2022 Hypothermia. \u2022 Crying.\n\n\u2022 Polysystemic effects lead to generalized weakness, ineffective nursing and inactivity.\n\n\u2022 Fading and death may result from the primary condition or from the debilitation that follows. Most common life-threatening congenital anomalies are cleft palate (nasal reflux, sneezing and dyspnea), portosystemic vascular shunt (stunted growth, neurological signs), cardiac (heart murmur, cyanosis, dyspnea, palpable thrill and stunted growth), gastrointestinal defects including megaesophagus (regurgitation), blind intestinal loops (vomiting) and atresia ani (abdominal distention).\n\nAcute hemolytic anemia in the first 2 days of life in kittens with blood type A who nurse on type B queens. Signs range from acute death on the first day of life to a fading syndrome over several days. Hemoglobinuria and anemia are highly suggestive.\n\nLife-threatening complication of other conditions, including sepsis, malnutrition, hypothermia, parasitism. Signs usually occur in kittens up to 6 weeks of age, and include weakness and cessation of nursing or eating, ataxia, disorientation, agitation and in severe cases seizures, blindness, coma and death.\n\nRespiratory distress due to immature pulmonary development is life threatening. Kittens also have no hair on ventrum or paws, ineffective sucking and MCV > 90 fl.\n\n\u2022 Nursing failure** (p 1135) May result from inadequate maternal milk supply due to agalactia or mastitis. Also ineffective nursing occurs due to weakness, competition or congenital anomaly. Occasionally, inappropriate milk replacer or feeding techniques are the problem. Signs usually occur in the first week of life and include weight loss, weakness and ineffective nursing.\n\nTransition to solid food may be affected by delayed physical development of unthrifty kittens or attachment to bottle feeding in hand-reared kittens. Kittens (6-8 weeks old) are reluctant to accept solid food but suckle well.\n\nInexperienced queens, maternal illness or a distracting environment may cause queens to neglect their kittens. Queens may actively reject or attack sick kittens. Kittens may be agitated and crying or be small, weak and have little suckling activity. Usually occurs in the first week of life. Hypothermia develops rapidly in neonatal kittens deprived of an external heat source or secondary to many other diseases. Hypothermia leads to gastrointestinal stasis, bradycardia, hypoglycemia and dehydration. Usually occurs in kittens <3 weeks of age but occurs as a secondary problem up to 6 weeks of age. Signs include cessation of nursing, inactivity and the kittens are cold to touch.\n\nSystemic viral infections such as FeLV may cause fetal losses, fading neonates or illness of weanling kittens, but disease is most common in kittens 8 weeks and older. Likely to affect most or all of the litter.\n\nFIP may cause fetal losses, fading neonates, or illness of weanling kittens, but disease is most common in kittens 8 weeks and older. Weight loss, ascites and cycles of unexplained fever may occur in kittens older than 8 weeks.\n\nTypically causes severe vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration and panleukopenia, most commonly in kittens older than 6 weeks of age. May cause peracute deaths without typical signs. Intrauterine infection may cause an intention tremor apparent when the kittens begin to walk.\n\nHerpes and calicivirus typically cause upper respiratory infections from 2 weeks and older. Infected kittens are inactive, crying and have a poor appetite, lose weight and may be hypothermic or pyrexic. Sneezing, nasal discharge, oral ulcers, corneal ulcers, conjunctivitis are common.\n\n\u2022 Bacterial sepsis*** (p 1128) This is the most common cause of death in 1-6-week-old kittens. Pathogens are most likely to be acquired from the normal flora of the queen and the environment. Signs range from sudden death to a fading syndrome lasting a few hours to a few days. Signs include inactivity, weakness, crying and ineffective nursing. Abdominal bloating and dyspnea may also occur.\n\n\u2022 Intestinal parasitic infection (ascarids*, coccidia*, giardia, toxoplasmosis) (p 1141) Diarrhea, dehydration and cachexia due to coccidia (common) and giardia (uncommon) occurs in kittens 5 weeks and older. Ascaridiasis (very common) causes weight loss, diarrhea, and intestinal obstruction in 8-week and older kittens if severe. Toxoplasmosis (uncommon) causes systemic illness in kittens of all ages.\n\nSevere anemia due to heavy flea infestation is common in all ages of kittens.\n\nKittens appear healthy and vigorous at birth.\n\nInfectious diseases, inadequate nutrition, congenital conditions or environmental extremes debilitate kittens.\n\nThe fading syndrome develops when the primary condition leads to poor nursing, hypoglycemia and hypothermia.\n\nRegardless of the cause of illness, fading kittens frequently have a similar appearance: generalized weakness, ineffective nursing, hypothermia and inactivity.\n\nThe primary condition produces adverse effects on multiple organs, resulting in fading kitten syndrome.\n\nThe cause of fading kitten syndrome is frequently related to the age of the kitten.\n\nNeonates succumb to congenital defects, maternal neglect, nursing failure, neonatal isoerythrolysis and environmental stresses.\n\nBacterial sepsis is the biggest threat to 1-6-week-old kittens.\n\nViruses, parasites, and weaning stress are more common in 4-8-week-old kittens.\n\nHypoglycemia occurs most commonly up to 6 weeks of age.\n\nHypothermia occurs most commonly up to 6 weeks of age. \n\nSepsis is the leading cause of death in neonatal kittens in the 1-6-week age range.\n\nIn most cases, septic kittens have become systemically infected with organisms that are found among the normal cutaneous and intestinal flora of cats and not from exotic pathogens.\n\nKittens are born with an immature immune system and are largely dependent on passive immunity acquired from maternal colostrum to prevent bacterial infection. \u2022 Failure of passive transfer is an important cause of sepsis in kittens. \u2022 Other contributing factors are poor nutrition, environmental stress and concurrent debilitating illness.\n\nBacterial sepsis frequently affects entire litters, with kittens falling ill and perishing within a few hours or days of each other.\n\nClinical signs range from sudden death to a fading syndrome that lasts a few hours to a few days.\n\nNeonatal sepsis is characterized by rapid deterioration and lack of response to therapy in kittens that appeared to be healthy a few hours earlier.\n\nDyspnea may develop in the presence of bronchopneumonia.\n\nExternal abscessation, particularly of the umbilical stump, may be present.\n\nHypothermia is common. Young kittens are unable to mount a febrile response to infection, so fevers are not present even in severe systemic infections.\n\nAbdominal distension due to gastrointestinal stasis leading to gas accumulation is common.\n\nSepsis is difficult to differentiate from other causes of fading kitten syndrome because there are rarely specific findings such as external abscesses.\n\nHypoglycemia is common.\n\nComplete blood count often reveals leukocytosis with left shift and toxic changes. Leukopenia is a particularly grave finding.\n\nBacterial culture and sensitivity may be performed on blood, urine and exudates.\n\nComplete necropsies with microbial culture and sensitivity of kittens that succumb to fading kitten syndrome are essential to prevent deaths of remaining littermates and to resolve recurrent problems in breeding programs and facilities that house kittens.\n\nNecropsies often reveal widespread visceral abscessation in kittens that appeared to be thriving only hours before death.\n\nHypoglycemia, hypothermia, and most causes of fading kitten syndrome mimic the clinical signs of bacterial sepsis.\n\nInflammatory leukogram changes in combination with clinical signs are highly suggestive of sepsis.\n\nBecause sepsis is so common in kittens aged 1-6 weeks, it should be the leading differential for fading kittens in this age group.\n\nTreatment for sepsis should begin as soon as the condition is suspected and should not be delayed for confirmation of the diagnosis.\n\nParenteral administration of fluids, medications and blood products can be challenging in neonatal kittens due to their small size.\n\n\u2022 Intravenous (IV) access can be achieved via the jugular vein with a short 24-or 22-gauge catheter, even in very young kittens. \u2022 If venous catheterization is not feasible, the intraosseous (IO) route may be used. After preparing the site aseptically, a 22-gauge hypodermic or spinal needle is inserted in the proximal humerus or femur and can be bandaged in place for repeated or longterm use. Most fluids, medications and transfusions administered IV can also be given IO. \u2022 The peritoneum provides a large surface area for absorption of fluids, blood products and drugs, but systemic blood levels following intraperitoneal (IP) administration may be delayed compared to IV and IO routes. \u2022 The small muscle mass of neonatal kittens makes repeated intramuscular (IM) administration of medications impractical. \u2022 Fluids and medications can also be administered subcutaneously (SC), although absorption may be poor if peripheral vasoconstriction is present.\n\nAntibiotic therapy should cover the spectrum of the most commonly isolated agents of neonatal sepsis. These include Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Gram-negative enteropathogens. Bordetella bronchiseptica may cause life-threatening bronchopneumonia. Dose adjustments of antibiotics may be appropriate in neonatal kittens, but guidelines are largely empirical and based on other species. \u2022 Enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg once daily, SC; current data suggest that absorption of enrofloxacin following oral dosing may be poor in neonatal kittens). Dose reduction of enrofloxacin is not required in kittens. It is effective against many agents of neonatal septicemia, but has poor activity against streptococcal species and anaerobes.\n\n-SC administration of enrofloxacin may result in permanent alopecia at the site of injection. -Cartilage erosions have not been reported in kittens treated with clinically relevant dosages. -Blindness due to retinal degeneration has been reported in adult cats, especially at higher doses. \u2022 Broad-spectrum parentally administered antibiotics (e.g. enrofloxacin 5 mg/kg IV or SC q 24 h plus ampicillin 22 mg/kg IV or SC tid). \u2022 Amoxicillin-clavulanate (22 mg/kg PO bid) provides extended coverage for kittens that do not require parenteral administration. \u2022 Initially, antibiotics are administered parenterally to assure reliable absorption and adequate blood levels. As the kitten returns to health, oral administration may replace injection, although disruption of the normal intestinal flora and diarrhea may result. \u2022 Treatment duration should be a minimum of 2 weeks.\n\nBecause passive immunity is believed to be critical for protecting the neonate against bacterial pathogens, it is essential to assure that affected kittens have adequate levels of immunoglobulin. This may be confirmed by measuring serum IgG levels. The delay in waiting for test results may put at-risk kittens in danger of illness however, so it may be warranted to administer serum empirically to provide protection for kittens at risk for septicemia. See page 1137 (maternal neglect and nursing failure) for details of serum administration.\n\nNutritional support is usually required because septic kittens fail to nurse. Even brief lapses in food intake can lead to hypoglycemia, immunosuppression and villus atrophy of the intestines, resulting in decreased defenses against pathogens. Some form of assistedfeeding is usually required. Nasogastric intubation (indwelling 3.5 or 5 French catheter) is a convenient route for feeding without the stress of forced hand-feeding or repeated orogastric intubation. Use a formula suitable for orphan kittens such as KMR (Kitten Milk Replacer). The recommended volume is 25 ml/100 g BW per day. Newborn kittens do not tolerate more than 2 ml at a feeding for the first 1-2 days, and should be fed every 2-4 hours. Thereafter, feeding volumes can be gradually increased to 5 ml/feed the first week, 10 ml/feed the second week, and 15 ml/feed the third week. After the first few days the kitten can be fed 4-6 times per 24 h. Weak kittens may not tolerate volumes this large without regurgitating and need to be fed smaller volumes more frequently.\n\nSurvival is low in kittens that are showing clinical signs of sepsis, particularly if dyspnea is present.\n\nPrognosis for littermates that appear healthy at the time therapy is initiated is good.\n\nKittens from Streptococcus canis-infected queens that are treated empirically at birth have an excellent prognosis.\n\nMost bloodstream infections are acquired from the normal flora of the queen or from the environment. They invade the bloodstream via the umbilicus or from colonization of the gastrointestinal, respiratory or urinary tracts.\n\nThe organism is believed to invade via the umbilicus and the oronasal passages.\n\nS. canis transmission from carrier queens can be prevented by routine use of penicillin at the time of birth. The queen is given a 1-ml SC injection of a product containing 150 000 IU benzathine penicillin and 150 000 IU procaine penicillin per ml. At birth, each newborn kitten receives 0.25 ml SC of a 1:6 dilution of the same product, and their navels are dipped in a 2% solution of tincture of iodine.\n\nIf there is any question about adequate colostrum intake by kittens, a serum IgG level can be determined. Alternatively, serum may be administered empirically as a source of immunoglobulin to kittens at risk for failure of passive transfer.\n\nBecause entire litters frequently succumb to bacterial infections, littermates of kittens that have died of sepsis should be treated with antibiotics.\n\nIf sepsis or failure of passive transfer is documented in one kitten of a litter, it is wise to prophylactically provide serum for the remaining kittens.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 Intestinal gas accumulation. \u2022 Kittens less than 6 weeks of age, but mostly less than 3 weeks.\n\nDuring the first two weeks of life, normal body temperature is 35\u02daC.\n\nNeonatal kittens lack a shiver reflex and are unable to raise their body temperature more than 7\u02daC above ambient temperature.\n\n\u2022 Separation from the queen or littermates may result in rapid loss of body heat.\n\nIf the core temperature drops below 32\u02daC, the digestive tract becomes non-functional and nursing ceases.\n\nSevere hypothermia depresses heart rate, respiration and metabolic functions.\n\nAlthough kittens living outdoors may develop primary hypothermia from environmental exposure, most hypothermic kittens presented for veterinary care have a predisposing medical condition.\n\nHypothermia is an almost universal sequella of all causes of fading kitten syndrome. Concurrent hypoglycemia is very common.\n\nPrimary hypothermia due solely to exposure is most common up to 3 weeks of age, whereas hypothermia secondary to other stressors such as cachexia, systemic illness and hypoglycemia may be seen in kittens as old as 6 weeks or more.\n\nCessation of nursing.\n\nInactivity.\n\nCold to touch.\n\nSubnormal rectal body temperature.\n\n\u2022 < 35\u02daC in kittens under 2 weeks of age.\n\n\u2022 < 37\u02daC in kittens greater than 2 weeks of age.\n\nAny cause of fading kitten syndrome may result in hypothermia.\n\nFirst efforts should be directed at correcting hypothermia and hypoglycemia, if present.\n\nMildly hypothermic kittens can be rewarmed by external heat sources such as heating blankets, warm water bottles and heat lamps.\n\n\u2022 Care should be taken to assure that recumbent kittens are not over-warmed or burned if they are too weak to move away from the heat source.\n\nSeverely hypothermic kittens (< 32.5\u02daC) should by warmed at the core before surface warming is attempted. Heating the skin first causes peripheral vasodilation before the cardiopulmonary system is capable of supporting non-critical tissues.\n\n\u2022 Core warming can be accomplished by administering fluids warmed to 37\u02daC (IV, IO or IP), warm water enemas, and heated inspired air. \u2022 Care should be taken not to warm the kitten too fast to avoid overtaxing the depressed cardiopulmonary system.\n\nSimultaneously, blood glucose should be measured. If measurement is not available, the kitten should be presumed to be hypoglycemic and treated empirically with dextrose (see Hypoglycemia for details).\n\n\u2022 If the body temperature is below 32\u02daC, dextrose must be administered parentally since gastrointestinal dysfunction may prevent absorption of oral sugar solutions.\n\nOnce body temperature and blood glucose have been corrected, a search for a predisposing cause should be initiated if environmental conditions do not explain the hypothermia.\n\nDebilitated kittens frequently relapse with hypothermia and hypoglycemia, so careful monitoring and preventive measures are important.\n\nPrognosis for a full recovery is good if hypothermia and hypoglycemia were not too prolonged and if primary predisposing causes are correctable.\n\nHealthy kittens should thrive if they have access to the queen and littermates for warmth.\n\nNeonatal kittens without a queen should be kept in warm quarters (\u2265 27\u02daC) or have access to a heat source such as a lamp or heating pad. To avoid overheating, kittens should be able to move to an unheated area of the nest.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 Kittens up to 6 weeks of age, occasionally older.\n\nRegardless of the cause of illness, sick neonates frequently stop nursing, dehydrate and become hypothermic, all of which contribute to hypoglycemia.\n\nNeonates are especially susceptible to hypoglycemia because energy requirements of neonates are 2-3 times higher than adults. Limited fat and glycogen stores further predispose neonates to hypoglycemia if nutrition is inadequate.\n\nHypothermia is a common sequella to many diseases in neonates and contributes to hypoglycemia by several mechanisms: \u2022 Mild to moderate hypothermia (< 34.5\u02daC) suppresses nursing behavior. \u2022 Severe hypothermia (< 32\u02daC) results in gastrointestinal stasis and prevents absorption of glucose and other nutrients. \u2022 Hypothermia reduces metabolic activity, including gluconeogenesis.\n\nParasitism and other intestinal diseases may disrupt nutrient absorption, leading to malnutrition and hypoglycemia.\n\nInfection, inflammatory processes and stress increase utilization of glucose that may exceed the neonate's ability to replace it.\n\nHypoglycemia results in decreased metabolic functions, especially in the central nervous system. \u2022 Neurologic signs of hypoglycemia progress from weakness, lethargy and mental dullness to seizures, coma and death if not corrected in time.\n\nEarly signs of hypoglycemia are weakness and cessation of nursing or eating.\n\nNeonatal kittens become inactive, whereas kittens older than 3 weeks may be ataxic and appear disoriented or agitated.\n\nSevere hypoglycemia may result in seizures, blindness, coma and death.\n\nHypoglycemia should be suspected in all fading kittens.\n\nHome glucometers can be used to measure glucose quickly with a drop of blood.\n\nLaboratory glucose results are the most accurate, but may take longer.\n\nBlood glucose < 3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dl) is consistent with clinical hypoglycemia.\n\nIf blood glucose measurement is not available, response to treatment with IV dextrose or oral sugar solutions supports a diagnosis of hypoglycemia.\n\nSince hypoglycemia is frequently secondary to another medical condition, a thorough evaluation for a predisposing problem should be performed.\n\nAny cause of fading kitten syndrome may resemble hypoglycemia. Although a low blood glucose level confirms hypoglycemia, concurrent conditions are also common.\n\nA normal blood glucose test differentiates hypoglycemia from other causes of neurologic signs such as head trauma, encephalitis, primary seizure disorder, portosystemic vascular shunt and inborn errors of metabolism.\n\nEmergency treatment for life-threatening hypoglycemia is 25% dextrose (1-2 ml/kg slowly IV). If venous access is not available, 10% dextrose may be administered IP or IO. Oral sugar solutions (e.g. 50% dextrose, corn syrup) can be given if body temperature is normal, but effect is slower and less predictable.\n\nClinical response to glucose replacement should be rapid. Delayed or partial response may occur if prolonged, severe hypoglycemia is present.\n\nContinuous infusion of 5-10% dextrose or repeated bolus q 2-6 h may be required to maintain euglycemia until the underlying cause can be eliminated.\n\nHypothermia must be corrected before feeding is attempted.\n\nFrequent small meals of high-protein diet supplemented with dextrose are given until euglycemia is maintained. \u2022 Nasogastric or orogastric tube feeding may be required for neonatal or weak kittens with hypoglycemia.\n\nIf the underlying condition can be corrected, prognosis for full recovery is excellent.\n\nIn some cases, neurologic damage such as blindness from hypoglyemia may be irreversible.\n\nGood husbandry should assure against most causes of hypoglycemia.\n\n\u2022 Neonates should be kept warm and be evaluated for nursing effectiveness. \u2022 Older kittens should receive adequate high-quality nutrition and be free of parasites and gastrointestinal diseases.\n\nKittens should be evaluated daily for adequate food intake, weight gain and body composition.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 Acute death on first day of life or gradual decline over several days.\n\nAt this time, the blood group system in cats is known to include: type A, type B and type AB, but additional Type B cats produce natural anti-A antibodies, even prior to first transfusion or pregnancy. Type B queens pass these antibodies to the newborn kittens in the colostrum.\n\nWhen type A kittens (blood type inherited from type A stud) absorb the anti-A antibodies from the type B queen, the kittens' own red blood cells are lysed (neonatal isoerythrolysis), leading to acute anemia, hemoglobinuria and organ failure. \n\nKittens are born healthy and nurse vigorously.\n\nA fading syndrome develops in first few days of life. Death may also occur acutely without any prodromal signs.\n\nTail tip necrosis may occur in milder cases.\n\nThe clinical history suggests kittens were healthy until colostrum was ingested.\n\nBlood typing confirms incompatible parental blood types (type A stud, type B queen).\n\nHemoglobinuria differentiates neonatal isoerythrolysis from other causes of early fading kitten syndrome.\n\n1134 blood groups may emerge as more cats studied.\n\nRemove kittens from queen during first day of life to prevent further colostrum ingestion.\n\nIf a transfusion is required in the first days of life, administer washed type B red blood cells (available from the queen) to the kitten. \u2022 3-5 ml donor blood is collected in CPD-A (citratephosphate-dextrose-adenine). A heparinized syringe can be used to collect donor blood in emergencies if CPD-A is not available. \u2022 The blood is centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1500 rpm. The plasma (containing anti-A alloantibodies) is discarded. The red blood cells are reconstituted with saline (volume equal to discarded plasma), recentrifuged, and the saline discarded. A second saline wash is performed, and then the saline is discarded. A volume equal to half of the discarded plasma is added, yielding washed packed red blood cells ready for transfusion. \u2022 Administer the packed red blood cells IV, IO or IP.\n\n-Avoid volume overload when using IV or IO routes. -Approximately 70% of RBCs administered IP reach the circulation by 72 h.\n\nIf transfusions are required after 2 weeks of age, red blood cells of the kitten's own type A can be transfused. However, a major cross match (donor cells + recipient plasma) should be performed to assure the period of incompatibility has passed).\n\nRoutine supportive care is essential during the hemolytic phase of neonatal isoerythrolysis.\n\nAcute death without prodromal signs occurs in some severe cases.\n\nEarly recognition and treatment is expected to save many kittens with neonatal isoerythrolysis.\n\nSome mildly affected kittens have only laboratory evidence of disease without clinical signs.\n\nKittens that survive the acute crisis generally recover to full health.\n\nBreeders may choose to eliminate type B cats from the breeding pool entirely.\n\nIf incompatible breeding is unavoidable, prevent nursing on maternal queen for the first 2 days of life.\n\nFoster the litter on a type A queen or bottle feed during this time. Administer serum from type A donor for passive immunity in place of colostrum. Kittens can be returned to queen on day 3 because antibody absorption is complete by that time.\n\ncan be used to identify and segregate kittens at risk for neonatal isoerythrolysis. \n\nInadequate milk supply.\n\n\u2022 Kittens are vigorous and show strong interest in suckling. Hungry kittens are agitated and cry continuously. Eventually, kittens may become weak from dehydration and malnutrition.\n\n\u2022 Kittens may be small, weak, inactive and show little suckling activity in response to oral stimulation. \u2022 Milk may leak from the nostrils (cleft palate, regurgitation).\n\n\u2022 Queen is distracted and inattentive to kittens. Overt aggression toward kittens is sometimes observed. \u2022 Kittens are alert and agitated, crying and attempting to nurse. \u2022 Some queens may not care for any kittens until the entire litter is delivered. First-born kittens may suffer from neglect during this time. Maternal neglect is most common with inexperienced queens.\n\nExamine the queen for general condition, mammary gland health and milk supply.\n\nObserve maternal behavior.\n\nExamine the kittens for congenital anomaly, general vigor, stomach fullness and suckling responses.\n\nIgG concentration (normal >1000 mg/dl the day after colostrum ingestion).\n\nHealthy kittens weigh approximately 100 g at birth and should gain 10% body weight daily during the first week of life. Daily weight checks provide early detection of kittens that fail to thrive.\n\nAny cause of fading kitten syndrome may lead to weakness and failure to nurse.\n\nQueens that appear to be displaying poor or aggressive maternal behavior may be culling kittens with subclinical illnesses.\n\nCorrect primary medical conditions of the queen or kittens that prevent effective nursing if possible.\n\nPoor maternal behavior can often be corrected by reducing stress and distraction in a quiet, safe environment free of human interference.\n\n\u2022 If the queen still neglects the litter, she should be confined to a small space with kittens. Resting benches and other alternatives to the nest box should be removed. \u2022 If necessary, the queen may be restrained to allow the kittens to nurse. Queens often accept their litter after several nursing sessions. \u2022 If the queen is highly distracted or agitated, mild sedation may encourage maternal behavior. Sedated queens should be monitored continuously for aberrant behavior. \u2022 Hand-rearing or transfer to a foster queen may be required if bonding is unsuccessful.\n\nBecause inanition occurs quickly in undernourished kittens, prompt nutritional intervention is indicated for kittens with nursing failure.\n\n\u2022 Feed kitten milk replacer by bottle or syringe if kitten will nurse. \u2022 Transient forced feeding may be achieved by repeated orogastric intubation. Prolonged feeding is less stressful if an indwelling nasogastric (3.5\n\nFrench catheter) tube is placed. See page 1131 (Bacterial sepis) for details. \u2022 If the queen or a foster cat has good maternal behavior, she can be allowed to care for the kittens even if she is not lactating or if milk quality is poor, as long as nutritional supplementation is provided. Kittens raised by queens frequently have better social development than hand-reared kittens. \u2022 If kittens are to be reared completely by hand, urination and defecation must be stimulated by rubbing the perineum with a damp cotton ball. Kittens develop the ability to urinate and defecate on their own by 3-4 weeks of age.\n\nDocumented or suspected hypoglobulinemia due to failure of passive transfer can be corrected by administration of donor serum.\n\n\u2022 The best donor is a healthy, blood type A, vaccinated cat free of FeLV, FIV and other infections. Cats that share the same environment as the kittens are most likely to have antibodies against pathogens the kittens may encounter. However, since most infections in kittens are due to ubiquitous normal flora and common feline viral pathogens, serum from any healthy, vaccinated cat is likely to be protective. \u2022 Serum is administered at a dose of 15 ml/100 g body weight SC or IP to achieve normal IgG concentration.\n\n-The serum administration is divided into 3 doses of 5 ml each administered every 12 h to avoid volume overload. -Catteries and facilities caring for large numbers of young kittens can prepare single-dose aliquots of donor serum for future use. Serum stored at -20\u02daC remains adequate for immunoglobulin supplementation for more than a year after collection.\n\nPrognosis is excellent when the underlying cause of nursing failure can be corrected.\n\nFoster-rearing is time consuming, but can be performed by most pet owners. Healthy kittens that are free of underlying disease have an excellent prognosis if handreared.\n\nSepticemia due to failure of passive transfer is one of the leading causes of death in neonatal kittens.\n\n\u2022 Once signs of sepsis appear, prognosis for survival is poor. Administration of serum after clinical signs appear is less likely to affect outcome. \u2022 Serum administered prior to the development of disease offers protection against sepsis.\n\nBreeding queens should be well-nourished and free of infectious disease. Vaccinations should be complete prior to breeding. Queens with poor maternal behavior should be eliminated from breeding programs.\n\nKittens should be kept warm and well-nourished.\n\nMaternal behavior should be observed to ensure adequate access to milk by the kittens.\n\nIf ingestion of colostrum is uncertain, serum should be provided. Serum IgG can be measured in the kittens, but it is often more practical to administer serum empirically.\n\nIf sepsis or failure of passive transfer is documented in one kitten of a litter, it is wise to prophylactically provide serum and antibiotics for the remaining kittens.\n\nClassical signs\n\nSee main reference on page 7 for details (The Cat With Acute Sneezing).\n\nThere is much overlap between the clinical signs caused by herpes-and calicivirus, so it is impossible to \n\nClinical signs are classical. In addition, there may be a history of upper respiratory infections in other household cats.\n\nViral culture of pharyngeal swabs can be used to differentiate herpes and calicivirus.\n\nB. bronchiseptica is diagnosed by bacterial culture of pharyngeal swabs or tracheal wash specimens.\n\nBulging eyelids (conjunctivitis neonatorum) may occur in kittens prior to natural separation of the lids.\n\nThoracic radiography may reveal pneumonia.\n\nBronchopneumonia, heart failure and oral ulceration due to caustic substances or electric shock can be differentiated from upper respiratory infection by careful physical examination \u00b1 thoracic radiography.\n\nSafe and effective systemic antiviral agents for herpesand caliciviruses are not available.\n\nTherapy is limited to supportive care including fluid replacement, nutritional support and prevention of secondary bacterial infection (amoxicillin/clavulanate 10-20 mg/kg PO bid, doxycycline 10 mg/kg PO q 24 h, or azithromycin 5-10 mg/kg PO q 24 h for 5-7 days).\n\nConjunctivitis and corneal ulceration are treated with topical antibiotic ointment (without corticosteroids).\n\n\u2022 Severe ocular herpes infection may benefit from topical antiviral compounds.\n\nAlthough B. bronchiseptica may be susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, some strains are resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. Fluoroquinolones, doxycycline, and azithromycin are effective against most isolates.\n\nIn kittens with conjunctivitis neonatorum, the eyelids should be gently separated and the purulent material flushed out, followed by topical antibiotics and frequent cleansing of the eyes.\n\n\u2022 Despite a dramatic clinical appearance at the time of diagnosis, most kittens fully recover with normal vision.\n\nIntranasal vaccination against viral upper respiratory infection (not panleukopenia virus) beginning as early as 3-4 weeks of age has ameliorated upper respiratory outbreaks in some catteries with endemic infections.\n\n\u2022 Cleft palate: milk from nostrils during nursing. \u2022 Cardiac defect: heart murmur, dyspnea, cyanosis.\n\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal defect: vomiting, regurgitation, constipation. \u2022 Portosystemic vascular shunt: salivation, neurologic signs.\n\nDrug administration (e.g. cleft palate from griseofulvin), vaccination (e.g. cerebellar hypoplasia from modified live virus panleukopenia), and infection (e.g. thymic atrophy from FeLV) during pregnancy may cause congenital defects.\n\nGenetic predisposition for specific deformities occurs in some breeds (e.g. cleft palate in Siamese, craniofacial deformity in Burmese).\n\nSigns are dependent on type of defect.\n\n\u2022 In cleft palate, milk leaks from nostrils during nursing. Rhinitis, sneezing and dyspnea may be present. \u2022 Cardiac defects may be accompanied by heart murmur, cyanosis, dyspnea, palpable thrill and stunted growth. Many kittens may be asymptomatic until they are older. \u2022 Kittens with megaesophagus (primary or secondary to vascular ring anomaly) have regurgitation from the time of birth. Other gastrointestinal defects such as blind intestinal loops, motility disorders and atresia ani also have signs from the time of birth including vomiting, abdominal distension, crying and constipation. \u2022 Signs in kittens with portosystemic vascular shunt (PSS) are usually delayed until weaning or later.\n\n-Intermittent salivation and neurologic signs (ataxia, seizures, disorientation, blindness) are common and may be associated with meals. -Signs of cystitis may occur if urate calculi form in bladder. Cerebellar hypoplasia is accompanied by intention tremor and ataxia, which is observed when kittens Diagnosis Thorough physical examination (cleft palate, cardiac defect, atresia ani) is essential.\n\nRadiography \u00b1 contrast and ultrasonography (cardiac defect, megaesophagus, intestinal defect, PSS) may characterize the specific anatomic defect.\n\nPost-prandial bile acids or plasma ammonia are elevated in kittens with PSS.\n\nNuclear scintigraphy is helpful for confirming diagnosis of PSS.\n\nTransient innocent murmurs are common during the first weeks of life but usually cease by 8 weeks of age. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) may close spontaneously during the perinatal period.\n\nAnemic kittens may develop a flow murmur that resolves with correction of the anemia.\n\nSurgical correction is often the ideal treatment (cleft palate, vascular ring anomaly, patent ductus arteriosis, PSS).\n\nAffected neonates may require aggressive nutritional support via nasogastric or esophagostomy tube feeding until they are large enough for surgical correction.\n\nPrognosis is good to excellent for surgically correctable defects (e.g. PDA, PSS).\n\nCleft palate repair is often complicated by postoperative healing problems and may require multiple surgeries.\n\nEarly correction of vascular ring anomalies usually improves regurgitation, but not all cases return to normal.\n\nMegaesophagus may occasionally resolve spontaneously. Aspiration pneumonia is a common complication of megaesophagus and may lead to euthanasia.\n\n\u2022 begin to walk.\n\nSevere anemia secondary to FeLV infection is uncommon in young kittens and is excluded by testing for the virus.\n\nSevere anemia in mixed breed, Burmese and Siamese kittens associated with transient hyperlipidemia at 4-5 weeks of age is eliminated based on lack of severely lipemic plasma found in hyperlipidemia.\n\nRemove fleas with a kitten-safe flea adulticide (imidacloprid, fipronil). Treat the other household pets and the environment to prevent reinfestation. Selamectin can be used from 6 weeks of age, but debilitated kittens may have adverse reactions.\n\nIf anemia is severe, whole blood or packed red blood cell transfusion may be required. If intravenous catheterization is not possible, blood may be administered IO or IP. Approximately 70% of red blood cells administered IP reach the circulation within 72 hours. \n\nDiarrhea, weight loss and abdominal distention are common findings of intestinal parasitism.\n\nSevere coccidial diarrhea may cause dehydration and hypoglycemia.\n\nVomiting occurs uncommonly.\n\nResponse to treatment.\n\nBacterial or viral gastroenteritis and malnutrition cause similar signs and may occur concurrently with intestinal parasitism.\n\nSupportive care (e.g. fluid replacement, nutritional supplementation) as needed.\n\nCoccidia: sulfadimethoxine (50 mg/kg PO first day, then 25 mg/kg PO q day for 10-20 days until asymptomatic and fecal flotation negative). All exposed kittens should be treated, and environmental contamination should be controlled. Some kittens may have persistent or recurrent infections.\n\nAscaridiasis: pyrantel pamoate (10 mg/kg PO, repeat in 2-4 weeks) or selemectin (administered topically to the skin can be used monthly for fleas and ascarids from 6 weeks of age). Because ascaridiasis is very common, all kittens should be routinely treated regardless of fecal test results.\n\nGiardia: fenbendazole (50 mg/kg PO q day for 5 days).\n\n\u2022 Incomplete hair-coat. \u2022 Low birth weight. \u2022 Ineffective suckling reflex. \u2022 Dyspnea. \u2022 Kittens in first days of life.\n\nLack of hair on ventrum and paws.\n\nDyspnea if pulmonary development is inadequate.\n\nPhysical examination.\n\nBreeding date known. Immature fetal hematology (mean corpuscular volume > 90 fl, increased nucleated red blood cells).\n\nNone.\n\nTube feeding.\n\nOxygen supplementation.\n\nIf dyspneic or more than a few days premature, prognosis for survival is poor. \n\nPerinatal infection may result in abortions, stillbirths, and fading kittens, although most clinical illness is seen in weaned kittens and adolescents.\n\nWeight loss.\n\nHypothermia if kittens are less than 6 weeks old.\n\nPerinatal FeLV is likely to affect most or all of the litter.\n\nKittens in apparently healthy litters individually fade and die over several weeks to months.\n\nSome infected kittens are long-term survivors.\n\nTest queen and each kitten for FeLV antigen.\n\nIt is common for infected kittens to have delayed seroconversion for FeLV antigen for several weeks to months, leading to false-negative tests in litters of fading kittens at the time of initial testing.\n\nDelayed seroconversion and inconsistent infection within litters makes it inappropriate to test only representative littermates.\n\n\u2022 All kittens should be tested, and serial testing may be required to confirm infection status. \u2022 The probability that an infected queen will transmit FeLV to her kittens is high.\n\nSome individuals in an affected litter may escape infection.\n\nAny cause of fading kitten syndrome may mimic FeLV infection. Losses from FeLV occur more commonly in older kittens (> 4 weeks) than in neonates.\n\nTreatment is largely supportive, although specific antiviral therapy may have added benefit by reducing viral burden. Claims for clinical benefits of immune modulator therapy have not yet been substantiated in controlled clinical trials.\n\nRecombinant feline interferon omega (antiviral dose: 1 MU/kg SC \u00d7 5 days at day 0, day 14, day 60).\n\nRecombinant human interferon alpha (antiviral dose: 100 000-1000 000 IU/kg SC q day). Recombinant human interferon alpha (immune modulator dose: 30 IU/cat PO q 24 h alternate weeks). Staphylococcus protein A (immune modulator dose: 10 \u03bcg/kg IP twice weekly).\n\nProvide supportive care with fluid replacement, antibiotics and blood products if indicated.\n\nAlthough aggressive therapy may improve the condition of clinically ill kittens, seroconversion to negative status is uncommon.\n\n\u2022 Intention tremor (evident about 5 weeks of age)."}
