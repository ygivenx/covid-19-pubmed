{"title": "FDA approved drugs with broad anti-coronaviral activity inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro", "body": "At the end of December 2019, reports started to emerge from China of patients suffering from pneumonia of unknown etiology. By early January, a new coronavirus had been identified and determined as the cause (1) . Since then, the virus originally known as nCoV-2019, now SARS-CoV-2, has spread around the world. As of March 24 th , 2020, there have been over 400,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection) with close to 20,000 recorded deaths (www.who.org). Multiple countries have enacted social distancing and quarantine measures, attempting to reduce person-to-person transmission of the virus.\n\nHealthcare providers lack pharmaceutical countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2, beyond public health interventions, and there remains a desperate need for rapid development of antiviral therapeutics. A potential route to candidate antivirals is through repurposing of already approved drugs. Numerous chemical compounds are approved for use in humans around the world (such as by the FDA), and their safety profiles are known. Many of these have also been found to have antiviral activity even though that is not their intended use (5) . We have previously screened a library of FDA approved drugs for antiviral activity against two other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (4) . That work found 27 approved drugs that inhibited replication of both of these coronaviruses, suggesting that they may have broad anti-coronaviral activity and inhibit SARS-CoV-2. With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, we have investigated whether 20 of these compounds have antiviral activity against the novel virus. Since these compounds are already approved for use in humans, they make ideal candidates for drug repurposing and rapid development as antiviral therapeutics.\n\nOur work found that many of the 20 compounds that inhibited SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV could also inhibit SARS-CoV-2, with similar IC50 values. One of the most promising drugs in our study is hydroxychloroquine sulfate (hereafter referred to as hydroxychloroquine). We further assayed hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate for their effects on virus titer and viral RNA production, and found both to have inhibitory activity, with hydroxychloroquine being more efficacious of the two. These data support the notion of testing chloroquine, or derivatives, as potential antiviral agents for treatment of COVID-19.\n\nVero E6 cells (ATCC# CRL 1586) were cultured in DMEM (Quality Biological), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Gemini Bioproducts) and 1% (v/v) L-glutamine (2 mM final concentration, Gibco). Cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Samples of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from the CDC following isolation from a patient in Washington State (WA-1 strain -BEI #NR-52281). Stocks were prepared by infection of Vero E6 cells for two days when CPE was starting to be visible. Media were collected and clarified by centrifugation prior to being aliquoted for storage at -80\u00b0C. Titer of stock was determined by plaque assay using Vero E6 cells as described previously (6) . All work with infectious virus was performed in a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory and approved by our Institutional Biosafety Committee.\n\nAll drug screens were performed with Vero E6 cells. Cells were plated in opaque 96 well plates one day prior to infection. Cells were pre-treated with drug at a range of concentrations for 2 hours (h) at 37\u00b0C/5% CO2. Drug stocks were made in either DMSO, water or methanol. Drugs were diluted from stock to 50\u00b5M and an 8-point, 1:2 dilution series made and infected at MOI 0.01 and 0.004. Vehicle controls were used on every plate, and all treatments were performed in triplicate for each screen. In addition to plates that were infected, parallel plates were left uninfected to monitor cytotoxicity of drug alone. Additionally, plates with untreated, uninfected cells and plates without cells were processed as controls. Three independent screens with this set-up were performed. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C/5% CO2 for 3 days before performing CellTiter-Glo (CTG) assays as per the manufacture's instruction (Promega). Luminescence was read using a Molecular Devices Spectramax L plate reader. Fluphenazine dihydrochloride, benztropine mesylate, amodiaquin hydrochloride, amodiaquin dihydrochloride dihydrate, thiethylperazine maleate, mefloquine hydrochloride, triparanol, terconazole vetranal, anisomycin, fluspirilene, clomipramine hydrochloride, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, promethazine hydrochloride, emetine dihydrochloride hydrate and chloroquine phosphate were all purchased from Sigma. Chlorpromazine hydrochloride, toremifene citrate, tamoxifen citrate, gemcitabine hydrochloride and imatinib mesylate were all purchased from Fisher Scientific.\n\nCytotoxicity (%TOX) data was normalized according to cell-only uninfected (cell only) controls and CTG-media-only (blank) controls:\n\nInhibition (%Inhibit) data was normalized according to cell only and the activity of the vehicle controls:\n\nNonlinear regression analysis was performed on the normalized %inhibit and %TOX data and IC50s and CC50s were calculated from fitted curves (log [agonist] versus response -variable slope [four parameters]) (GraphPad Software, LaJolla, CA), as described previously (7). Drug dilution points in a given run were excluded from IC50 analysis if the average cytotoxicity was . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

IC50 or CC50 values extrapolated outside the drug dilution range tested were reported as greater than 50\u00b5M or less than 0.39\u00b5M. Selectivity indexes (SI) were also calculated by dividing the CC50 by the IC50.\n\nTo further analyse candidate drugs, Vero cells were plated in 24 well plate format one day prior to infection. As with the drug screens, cells were pre-treated with drug at a range of concentrations, or vehicle control for 2 h. Cells were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.1 for 24 h. Supernatant was collected, centrifuged in a table top centrifuge for 3 min at max speed and stored at -80\u00b0C. After a wash in PBS, infected cells were collected in TRIzol (Ambion) for RNA analysis (described below). Supernatant was used to titer viral production by TCID50 assay (6) .

Fold change between drug treated and vehicle control was determined by calculating DDCT after normalization to the endogenous control of 18S.\n\nPreviously, we performed a large-scale drug screen on 290 FDA approved compounds to investigate which may have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (4). With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, we prioritized 20 of the 27 hits that were determined to inhibit both of the previously tested coronaviruses. The list of tested compounds can be seen in Table 1 .\n\nOur initial screening started at 50\u00b5M and used an 8-point, 1:2 dilution series with infections being performed at either MOI 0.01 or 0.004. Cells were pre-treated with drug for 2 h prior to infection. 3 days post-infection CellTiter-Glo (CTG) assays were performed to determine relative cell viability between drug and vehicle control treated cells. Uninfected samples were used to measure the cytotoxicity of compound alone. From the relative luminescence data of the CTG assay, percent inhibition (of cell death caused by viral infection) could be measured and plotted along with the percent cytotoxicity of drug alone. Fig. 1 shows these plotted graphs from one representative of three independent screens. For those drugs demonstrating a cell toxicity rate lower than 30%, we were able to calculate IC50 values from these graphs for 17 of the 20 drugs which is summarized in Table 1 .\n\nIn order to validate our screening process as a means to determine compounds with potential antiviral effect we decided to follow up with two drugs. It has been reported that chloroquine shows anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in humans, so we further investigated hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate as both were present in our screen (Table 1) . To more directly assess the effects of these compounds on viral replication, Vero E6 cells were plated and pre-treated with drug prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.1. Supernatant was collected 24 h post-. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Treatment with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine both caused a reduction in viral mRNA levels, especially at higher concentrations (concentrations used were not cytotoxic - Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). There was a larger decrease in relative expression levels of RdRp that N mRNA, but both showed reductions across the range of concentrations used (Fig. 2) . Along with causing a reduction in viral mRNA, treatment with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine caused a significant reduction in viral replication (Fig. 3) .\n\nSARS-CoV-2 production was more sensitive to hydroxychloroquine with larger inhibition seen at the same concentration of treatment, which is in agreement with hydroxychloroquine having a lower IC50 in our cell viability assay (Table 1) . Overall, these data demonstrates that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate inhibit cytopathic effect, synthesis of viral mRNA and production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in vitro.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has demonstrated the need for antiviral drugs with broad activity against a range of viruses. Whether treating SARS-CoV-2 in this current pandemic or the next unknown viral pathogen, we must attempt to have validated antiviral drugs that are ready at the first signs of an outbreak. Many FDA approved drugs have been found to have antiviral activity and since these are extensively used in humans for other conditions, they could be streamlined for rapid approval for alternative use as antivirals. We previously performed a screen of 290 FDA approved drugs and found a subset of these to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (4). We prioritized testing these for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. From multiple independent screens performed with two MOI, we found that 17 of our 20 tested compounds display significant antiviral activity at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Many of the compounds have IC50 values under 10\u00b5M and these will be the source of follow up testing on additional cell lines and in mouse models of SARS-CoV-2. We have further tested .

Both drugs showed inhibitory properties, but hydroxychloroquine had greater antiviral activity.
