In contrast, the severe acute respiratory syndrome- In December 2019 a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, Hubei 58 province, China (8-10). Initial infections occurred at Huanan seafood market, potentially due to 59 animal contact. Subsequently, human-to-human transmission occurred (11) 60 and the disease rapidly spread within China. A novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, which is closely 61 related to SARS-CoV, was detected in patients and is believed to be the etiologic agent of the 62 new lung disease (10). On January 28, 2020, at total of 4593 laboratory confirmed infections 63 were reported, including 976 severe cases and 106 deaths (12). Infections were also detected in 64 14 countries outside China and were associated with international travel. At present, it is 65 unknown whether the sequence similarities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV translate into 66 similar biological properties, including pandemic potential (13).\n\nThe spike (S) protein of coronaviruses facilitates viral entry into target cells. Entry 68 depends on S protein binding to a cellular receptor and on S protein priming by a cellular 69 protease. SARS-S engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as entry receptor (14) and 70 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The SARS-71 S/ACE2 interface has been elucidated and the efficiency of ACE2 usage was found to be a key 72 determinant of SARS-CoV transmissibility (6, 18). SARS-S und 2019-nCoV-S share ~76% 73 amino acid identity. However, it is unknown whether 2019-nCoV-S like SARS-S employs ACE2 74 and TMPRSS2 for host cell entry. allowing a meaningful side-by-side comparison. We first focused on 2019-nCoV cell tropism.\n\nTransduction of cell lines of animal and human origin revealed that all cell lines were readily 81 susceptible to entry driven by the pantropic VSV glycoprotein (VSV-G) (Fig. 1C) , as expected. Serum from a convalescent SARS patient inhibited SARS-S-but not VSV-G-driven entry in a 115 concentration dependent manner (Fig. 4 ). In addition, the serum reduced 2019-nCoV-S-driven 116 entry, although with somewhat lower efficiency as compared to SARS-S (Fig. 4) . Thus, antibody 117 author/funder. All rights reserved.
