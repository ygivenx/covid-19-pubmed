{"title": "IFN-\u03b3\u2013 and IL-10\u2013expressing virus epitope-specific Foxp3+ T reg cells in the central nervous system during encephalomyelitis", "body": "Foxp3gfp mice were infected with rJ2.2 and examined for the presence of Foxp3+ T reg cells. The frequency of Foxp3+ T reg cells was 20\u201330% at 3 and 5 d after infection, decreasing to <10% of total CD4 T cells in the brain and spinal cord by 7 d after infection (Fig. 1 A). The decrease in frequency by day 7 did not reflect a lower rate of proliferation because similar fractions of T reg cells and non\u2013T reg CD4 T cells incorporated BrdU at 6 d after infection (Fig. 1 B). Rather, it likely reflects recruitment of virus-nonspecific T reg cells into the CNS at early stages of the infection.\n\nWe previously showed that virus-specific effector CD4 and CD8 T cells were detected in the infected brain at 6\u20137 d after infection (Haring et al., 2001). MHC class II/peptide tetramers are available for detecting epitope M133-specific CD4 T cells, and using these tetramers, we also detected M133-specific T reg cells in the brain and spinal cord at 7 d after infection (Fig. 1, C and E). Furthermore, M133-specific T reg cells were present in the infected CNS until at least 49 d after infection. M133-specific T reg cells were not routinely detected above background in draining cervical LNs (CLNs) or spleen (unpublished data). Staining with M133 tetramer was specific because no positive cells were detected in mice infected with an rJ2.2 variant in which the epitope was mutated, abrogating recognition (rJ.2.2.MY135Q; Fig. 1 D; Anghelina et al., 2006).\n\nTo further characterize these virus-specific T reg cells, we next assessed whether they produced cytokines in response to peptide stimulation. Remarkably, \u223c4\u20136% of all CNS (pooled brain and spinal cord)-derived T reg cells expressed IFN-\u03b3, after peptide M133 stimulation at 14 d after infection (Fig. 2 A). We also identified IFN-\u03b3+ T reg cells specific for a second rJ2.2-specific CD4 T cell epitope, S358 in the CNS. In experiments described later in this paper, cells were stimulated with M133 and S358 peptides together (M133 + S358) because virus-specific T reg cells were present in low numbers in the infected CNS (Fig. 2 B). Virus-specific IFN-\u03b3+ T reg cells were detected as early as 6 d after infection, at the same time that virus-specific effector CD4 T cells could be identified (Haring et al., 2001), and were present at approximately the same frequency in both the acute and chronic stages of the infection (Fig. 2, C and D). In addition, after stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb, the fraction of T reg cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 increased two- to fourfold, suggesting that M133 + S358\u2013specific T reg cells accounted for only a fraction of all IFN-\u03b3+ T reg cells in the CNS (Fig. 2, B\u2013D). Notably, the mean fluorescence intensity of IFN-\u03b3 expression was lower in M133 + S358\u2013specific T reg cells compared with effector CD4 T cells, indicating less expression on a per-cell basis (Fig. 2 F). To verify that T reg cells produce IFN-\u03b3 in vivo, we treated B6 mice with brefeldin A (BFA) at 6 d after infection (Fig. 2 E; Liu and Whitton, 2005). In the absence of BFA, some Foxp3\u2212 CD4 T cells were IFN-\u03b3+, consistent with results showing that cells in the infected brain express IFN-\u03b3 in the absence of ex vivo stimulation (Fig. 2 A). The frequency of Foxp3\u2212 and Foxp3+ cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 increased twofold and fivefold, respectively, after in vivo BFA treatment, confirming in situ IFN-\u03b3 expression by T reg cells. Consistent with the in vitro peptide stimulation analyses, the mean fluorescence intensity of IFN-\u03b3 expression was lower in T reg cells compared with effector CD4 T cells after in vivo BFA treatment (Fig. 2 F).\n\nA majority of these virus-specific IFN-\u03b3+ T reg cells expressed TNF but virtually none expressed IL-2 (Fig. 3, A and B). IL-10 production by T reg cells has been previously documented (Vignali et al., 2008) and as shown in Fig. 3 (C and D), \u223c50% of IFN-\u03b3+ T reg cells also expressed IL-10. Additionally, a substantial percentage only produced IL-10. T reg cells at sites of Th1-type inflammation express the transcription factor T-bet (Koch et al., 2009). Consistent with the proinflammatory nature of the rJ2.2-infected brain, 35% of all T reg cells also expressed this protein (Fig. S1, A and B). All IFN-\u03b3+ M133 + S358\u2013specific T reg cells were T-bet positive (Fig. S1 C).\n\nThese assays all used Foxp3gfp mice to detect virus epitope-specific T reg cells. Next, we confirmed concordant labeling of GFP and Foxp3 detected with anti-Foxp3 antibody in both naive CLNs and infected brains (Fig. S2 A). To show that IFN-\u03b3 virus-specific T reg cells were also detected in WT mice, we infected B6 mice with rJ2.2 and analyzed CNS-derived cells at 7 d after infection. A similar percentage of M133 + S358\u2013specific T reg cells expressed IFN-\u03b3 as was detected in infected Foxp3gfp mice (Fig. S2 B).\n\nTo determine whether M133-specific T reg cells were immunosuppressive, we isolated GFP+ and GFP\u2212 CD4 T cells from the brains of rJ2.2-infected Foxp3gfp mice at day 7 after infection and used them in direct ex vivo suppression assays. As a control, we isolated GFP+ T reg cells from mice infected with rJ2.2.MY135Q, which does not express epitope M133. As shown in Fig. 4 A, T reg cells harvested from rJ2.2, but not from rJ2.2.MY135Q-infected mice, suppressed proliferation of brain-derived effector T cells after M133 peptide stimulation. In contrast, T reg cells from brains infected with either virus were suppressive after stimulation with anti-CD3 (Fig. 4 B). To determine the relative suppressive ability of brain-derived T reg cells, we compared them to T reg cells isolated from naive spleens in proliferation assays as described in Materials and methods. In these assays, responder cells were harvested from uninfected spleens and stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb. The brain-derived T reg cells were more suppressive than splenic T reg cells (Fig. 4 C), possibly because T reg cells from sites of inflammation are more activated than those derived from naive mice. Consistent with this, brain-derived T reg cells expressed higher levels of CD69, ICOS, and CTLA-4 directly ex vivo and of IL-10 after stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody or PMA and ionomycin (Fig. S3).\n\nDetection of M133-specific effector CD4 T cells and T reg cells at 6 d after infection was consistent with the notion that M133-specific T reg cells were present in the natural T reg cell pool. To address this, we used MHC/peptide tetramers and magnetic bead technology, which facilitates the identification of epitope-specific precursor T cells in naive mice (Moon et al., 2009). Using this approach and I-Ab/M133 tetramers, we detected 163 \u00b1 10 Foxp3\u2212 and 25 \u00b1 2 Foxp3+ M133-specific CD4 T cells per three naive Foxp3gfp mice (n = 3; Fig. 5 A). To confirm these results in mice with a higher M133-specific precursor frequency, we developed Rg mice expressing an M133-specific T cell receptor, as described in Materials and methods (M133 TCR Rg). 0.2\u20135% of splenic CD4 T cells were M133 specific in uninfected M133 TCR Rg mice and, of these cells, \u223c0.5\u20131% were Foxp3+ (Fig. 5 C). To determine whether IFN-\u03b3+ M133-specific T reg cells were detectable in infected M133 TCR Rg mice, we infected mice that contained <1% Rg CD4 T cells with rJ2.2. The frequency of M133-specific CD4 T cells as assessed by IFN-\u03b3 expression (Fig. 5 B) was modestly higher than in B6 mice (Fig. 2 A; Zhao et al., 2009), but most of the cells were M133 Rg cells. A small fraction of these cells were Foxp3+ and most expressed IFN-\u03b3 after M133 peptide stimulation (Fig. 5 D).\n\nTo further investigate whether these T reg cells were derived from natural T reg cells, we measured expression of the helios, a transcription factor. Helios has been reported to be expressed by natural but not peripherally converted T reg cells (Thornton et al., 2010). Some M133 + S358\u2013specific IFN-\u03b3+ T reg cells in the infected brain expressed high level of helios, consistent with an origin in natural T reg cell populations (Fig. S4). However, many of the IFN-\u03b3+ cells were helios intermediate, making it uncertain as to whether all of these cells were thymically derived.\n\nOur results from rJ2.2-infected mice showed that virus-specific T reg cells expressed IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 in the inflamed brain. To determine whether this was also true in autoimmune settings, we examined cytokine production by MOG35-55-specific T reg cells in Foxp3gfp mice with EAE (Fig. S5). In these mice, \u223c12 and 32% CD4 T cells in the inflamed brain were Foxp3+ at 15 and 32 d after immunization, respectively (Fig. S5 C). To determine whether these T reg cells expressed cytokines in response to peptide stimulation, we exposed cells directly ex vivo to MOG35-55 and measured IL-10, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-17 production. IL-10 was expressed by the majority of cytokine-producing MOG35-55-specific T reg cells, whereas small percentages expressed IL-17 (Fig. S5 D) at day 15. By day 32, only a small fraction of T reg cells expressed either of these cytokines (Fig. S5 E).\n\nIdentification of T reg cell\u2013specific target epitopes in infected nontransgenic animals has proven difficult. Our results demonstrate the presence of virus-specific Foxp3+ T reg cells in the rJ2.2-infected CNS but also show that they are present at a low frequency (Figs. 1 and 2). Detection was initially facilitated by the availability of M133-specific MHC class II tetramers. However, we previously showed that this tetramer was not as efficient as cytokine expression in identifying M133-specific effector CD4 T cells (Zhao et al., 2009). Subsequently, we identified a greater frequency of M133-specific T reg cells by cytokine staining for IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 after peptide stimulation. IL-10 expression may be particularly useful for detecting epitope-specific T reg cells because IL-10 was produced in virally infected mice and in mice with EAE after peptide stimulation (Fig. 3 and Fig. S5). IFN-\u03b3 production by T reg cells was previously demonstrated in a lethal toxoplasmosis infection (Oldenhove et al., 2009), but our results indicate that IFN-\u03b3 is also expressed in the context of a nonlethal viral infection and continues even as the inflammatory response subsides (Fig. 2). The continued expression of IFN-\u03b3 by virus-specific T reg cells likely occurs because virus antigen persists in the infected CNS (Bergmann et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2009). Epitope M133-specific T reg cells suppressed proliferation of effector CD4 T cells responding to the same epitope, suggesting that if IFN-\u03b3 expression diminishes T reg cell suppressive function, its effect is limited. rJ2.2-specific T reg cells were detected in the CNS and not draining CLNs or spleen (Fig. 1 and not depicted), suggesting that they function by directly inhibiting T cell function or diminishing antigen presentation by microglia or other antigen-presenting cells at the site of inflammation.\n\nDo virus-specific T reg cells generally play a critical role in diminishing immunopathology? In several infectious diseases, including patients infected with West Nile virus or Dengue fever virus, higher T reg cell frequencies correlated with improved outcomes (L\u00fchn et al., 2007; Lanteri et al., 2009). Relevant for our results, Mtb-specific TCR Tg T reg cells were more potently suppressive than Mtb-nonspecific TCR Tg T reg cells in infected mice (Shafiani et al., 2010). Furthermore, although transfer of natural T reg cells diminished disease in the setting of autoimmune disease, suppression was estimated to be \u223c20\u201350-fold more potent if T reg cells were specific for an epitope at a site of inflammation (Tang et al., 2004; Tarbell et al., 2004). Thus, islet-specific T reg cells prevented diabetes in NOD mice, whereas nonspecific T reg cells at the same dosage could not. If true for rJ2.2-specific T reg cells, these cells may be especially potent in diminishing immunopathology in mice with encephalomyelitis and would be most activated and, thereby, suppressive during acute infection when viral antigen is maximal (Bergmann et al., 2006).\n\nOur results suggest that rJ2.2-specific T reg cells originate, at least in part, from natural T reg cell populations. First, virus-specific T reg cells are detected at 6\u20137 d after infection at the same time as effector CD4 T cells. If these cells arose by peripheral conversion from effector cells, this process would need to occur concomitantly with priming. Second, M133-specific T reg cells can be detected in the spleens and LNs of naive Foxp3gfp and Rg M133 TCR mice (Fig. 5), showing that they are present in the naive T reg cell pool. Third, some M133 + S358\u2013specific T reg cells expressed high levels of helios, a transcription factor expressed by thymus-derived but not induced T reg cells (Fig. S4; Thornton et al., 2010).\n\nIn summary, we demonstrate the presence of IFN-\u03b3\u2013 and IL-10\u2013expressing virus-specific T reg cells in the CNS of infected mice and show that these T cells suppress proliferation of cognate epitope-specific CD4 T cells. Detection of epitope-specific T reg cells by cytokine expression may be especially useful because MHC class II/peptide tetramers are not widely available and may detect only high-affinity cells (Sabatino et al., 2011). In addition, previous efforts using T reg cells therapeutically to diminish excessive inflammatory responses have used adoptive transfer of in vitro propagated T reg cells (Tang et al., 2004; Tarbell et al., 2004). Identification of virus-specific T reg cells raises the possibility that an alternative therapeutic approach will be to augment expansion of T reg cells specific for a virus or pathogenic self epitope at sites of inflammation.\n\nSpecific pathogen-free 6-wk-old C57BL/6 mice (B6) were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD). Foxp3gfp mice on a B6 background were provided by A. Rudensky (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). OT-II mice, transgenic for expression of a TCR specific for epitope OVA323-339, were obtained from T. Griffith (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). All animal studies were approved by the University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nFor M133 TCR Rg mice, to identify M133-specific T cell receptors, splenocytes were harvested 7 d after infection from mice infected i.p. with the neurovirulent JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus and were stimulated with 5 \u00b5M of peptide M133. After stimulation, epitope-specific CD4 T cells were captured using a mouse IFN-\u03b3 secretion assay (Miltenyi Biotec) as previously described (Pewe et al., 2004). IFN-\u03b3\u2013expressing CD4 T cells were sorted with a FACSDiva (BD). RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini kit (Invitrogen) and used for cDNA synthesis. V\u03b28-specific PCR products were synthesized because V\u03b28 is the most commonly used V\u03b2 element in the M133-specific response (Haring et al., 2001). PCR products were cloned into plasmid vector pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced.\n\nTCR Rg mice were engineered as previously described (Holst et al., 2006). An M133-specific TCR-\u03b2 (V\u03b28.3, TRBV13-1) identified in three of three mice was produced synthetically (Geneart) and then cloned into a retroviral vector containing an IRES-GFP cassette to allow identification of transfected cells by GFP expression. Retroviral producer cell lines expressing this TCR-\u03b2 were produced and used to transduce B6 donor bone marrow before reconstitution of lethally irradiated B6 recipient mice. After reconstitution, these Rg mice were infected with rJ2.2. The majority of CD4 T cells in the infected CNS were GFP+. I-Ab/M133 tetramer+ GFP+ cells were sorted from the infected CNS and analyzed for TCR-\u03b1 chain expression. Two TCR-\u03b1 chains (V\u03b12.3 and TRAV14-1), differing by a single amino acid in the CDR3 region, were detected using RT-PCR\u2013based cloning. One of these TCR-\u03b1 was synthesized and cloned into the same retroviral vector described in this section. In this vector, the TCR-\u03b1 and TCR-\u03b2 chains are linked via the 2A protease, facilitating cleavage. Because the two chains are linked on the same molecule, they are produced in stoichiometric amounts. TCR Rg mice expressing both M133-specific TCR-\u03b1 and TCR-\u03b2 were produced. Epitope M133 specificity was confirmed by analysis of GFP+ cells in the infected CNS using M133-specific tetramer and IFN-\u03b3 expression after peptide stimulation.\n\nA recombinant rJ2.2 in which the M133 epitope was mutated to abolish binding to the I-Ab antigen (rJ2.2.MY135Q) was constructed as described previously (Anghelina et al., 2006). rJ2.2 and rJ2.2.MY135Q were propagated in mouse 17Cl-1 cells and titered on HeLa-MHVR cells (Pewe et al., 2005). 6\u20137-wk-old WT B6 and Foxp3gfp mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 600 PFU rJ2.2 or 2,000 PFU rJ2.2.MY135Q in 30 \u00b5l DME.\n\nThe following antibodies were used in this study: CD4-FITC, -PE, or -PerCP-Cy5.5 (RM 4\u20135), CD69-PE (H1.2F3), IL-2-PE (JES6-5H4; BD); purified functional anti-CD3, CD3-PerCP-Cy5.5 (145-2C11), CD4\u2013Alexa Fluor 700 (RM 4\u20135), CD16/CD32-biotin or -PerCP-Cy5.5 (93), Foxp3-FITC, -PE, or \u2013Alexa Fluor 647 (FJK-16s), T-bet\u2013PE (eBio4B10), IFN-\u03b3\u2013PE or \u2013allophycocyanin (APC; XMG1.2), TNF-PE (MP6-XT22), CTLA-4\u2013PE (UC10-4B9), ICOS-PE (7E.17G9), eFluor 450\u2013conjugated anti-CD11b (M1/70), CD11c (N418), F4/80 (BM8), B220 (RA3-6B2), and CD49b (DX5) mAbs (eBioscience); and IL-10-APC (JES5-16E3) and Helios-PE (22F6; BioLegend).\n\nBrains and spinal cords harvested after PBS perfusion were dispersed and digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase D (Roche) and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I (Roche) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Dissociated CNS tissue was passed through a 70-\u00b5m cell strainer, followed by Percoll gradient (70/37%) centrifugation. Mononuclear cells were collected from the interphase, washed, and resuspended in culture medium for further analysis.\n\nCNS-derived mononuclear cells were stained with 8 \u00b5g/ml PE-conjugated I-Ab/M133 tetramers (obtained from the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases MHC Tetramer Core Facility, Atlanta, GA) in RP10 media for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then incubated with anti\u2013CD16/CD32-biotin and anti\u2013CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5, followed by Avidin-APC. Cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD). Results are shown after gating on CD16/CD32-negative cell populations.\n\nFoxp3gfp mice were injected i.p. with 2 mg BrdU (BD) at 6 d after infection. BrdU incorporation by brain CD4 T cells was examined 16 h after injection according to manufacturer protocols (APC BrdU flow kit; BD).\n\nTo detect cytokine production by antigen-specific CD4+ effector T cells (T eff cells) and T reg cells, mononuclear cells isolated from the brain and spinal cord were stimulated with 5 \u00b5M of peptides M133, S358, M133 + S358 (rJ2.2 infection), or MOG35-55 (in EAE) in complete RPMI 1640 medium for 6 h at 37\u00b0C, in the presence of 1 \u00b5l/ml Golgiplug (BD) and antigen-presenting cells (CHB3 cells, B cell line, H-2Db, I-Ab). The rJ2.2-specific epitopes encompass residues 133\u2013147 of the transmembrane (M) protein and residues 358\u2013372 of the surface (S) glycoprotein (Xue and Perlman, 1997; Haring et al., 2001). Intracellular expression of IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, TNF, IL-2, or IL-17 was assayed. For some samples, cells were pooled from two to four mice. In some experiments, infected mice were treated with 0.25 mg BFA (Sigma-Aldrich) or vehicle (5% DMSO) intravenously. 6 h later, CNS-derived lymphocytes were analyzed directly ex vivo for IFN-\u03b3 expression as described previously (Liu and Whitton, 2005). Only infected mice were analyzed because virtually no T cells are detected in the uninfected brain.\n\nCD4+ T cells were enriched by negative magnetic selection from rJ2.2- or rJ2.2.MY135Q-infected brains (pooled from 10 mice) or naive spleens of Foxp3gfp mice using a CD4+ T cell isolation kit and AutoMACS (both from Miltenyi Biotec) or a mouse CD4+ T cell enrichment kit and Purple EasySep Magnet (both from STEMCELL Technologies). After enrichment of CD4+ T cells, CD4+GFP\u2212 responder and CD4+GFP+ regulatory T cells were then sorted using a FACSDiva or FACSAria cell sorter (BD). For the suppression assay, 3 \u00d7 104 CFSE-labeled (2.5 \u00b5M; Invitrogen) responder T cells from rJ2.2-infected brains or naive spleens were co-cultured with the indicated number of T reg cells and 105 irradiated CHB3 cells (2,500 rad) per well, in the presence of 5 \u00b5M M133 peptide or 1 \u00b5g/ml anti-CD3 mAb in a 96-well round bottom plate. After 66 h, cells were harvested and stained with anti\u2013CD4-PE and anti\u2013Foxp3\u2013Alexa Fluor 647. CD4+Foxp3\u2212 responder cells were analyzed for CFSE dilution by flow cytometry. The division index (DI) was obtained using FlowJo software (Tree Star). The percentage of suppression by T reg cells was calculated as follows: % suppression = 100% \u00d7 [1 \u2212 (DI of responders plus T reg cells/DI of responders only)].\n\nM133-specific T reg cells in the naive T cell pool were identified using a previously described method (Moon et al., 2009) with modifications. In brief, single cell suspensions were prepared from spleens and cervical, axillary, brachial inguinal, and mesenteric LNs of uninfected 10-wk Foxp3gfp and OT-II mice. CD4 T cells were isolated by negative selection using a CD4 T cell isolation kit II. CD4 T cells were then stained with anti-CD16/32 mAb (2.4G2) and PE-conjugated I-Ab/M133 tetramers as described in the previous section (except tetramer was used at 4 \u00b5g/ml to reduce background). After washing, cells were exposed to anti-PE magnetic microbeads and separated on an MS column (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were then stained with anti\u2013CD3-PerCP, anti\u2013CD4-Alexa Fluor 700, and non\u2013T cell lineage (dump) markers (eFluor 450\u2013conjugated anti-CD11b, anti-CD11c, anti-F4/80, anti-B220, and anti-CD49b). Cells were then stained with Hoechst 33258 to gate out dead cells, and analyzed with a LSRII cytometer (BD).\n\nEAE was induced in Foxp3gfp mice using a previously described method (Wang et al., 2006). In brief, mice were immunized with 0.4 ml of an emulsion containing 300 \u00b5g MOG35-55 (>95% purity; AnaSpec) in PBS and an equal volume of CFA containing 1 mg Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (Difco Laboratories) by s.c. inoculation at four flank sites. 200 ng pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories Inc.) was administered in 0.2 ml PBS i.v. on the day of immunization and 48 h later. Mice were weighed and assessed for clinical symptoms daily with the following scoring system: 0, no clinical signs; 1, limp tail; 2, paraparesis (weakness, incomplete paralysis of one or two hind limbs); 3, paraplegia (complete paralysis of two hind limbs); 4, paraplegia with fore limb weakness or paralysis; and 5, moribund or dead.\n\nTwo-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t tests were used to analyze differences in mean values between groups. All data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Differences with values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.\n\nFig. S1 shows T-bet expression by rJ2.2-specific T reg cells.
