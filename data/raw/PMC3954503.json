{"title": "High-Affinity Recognition\nof HIV-1 Frameshift-Stimulating\nRNA Alters Frameshifting in Vitro and Interferes with HIV-1\nInfectivity", "body": "Human immunodeficiency\nvirus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent\nof acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), remains a significant\nchallenge to global health.1,2 Since its initial identification\nin 1983, HIV-1 infection has reached the status of a pandemic. In\n2009 alone, there were approximately 2.7 million new infections and\nabout 2.0 million deaths from AIDS related causes.3 Currently there is no cure for HIV-1 infection. While progression\nof the disease can be controlled by highly active antiretroviral therapy\n(HAART), a combination of drugs designed to inhibit different stages\nin the virus\u2019 life cycle,4 the complexity\nof the HAART regimen, and the ability of the virus to evolve resistance\nsuggest that alternative drug targets for HIV-1 treatment and prophylaxis\nare needed.5\n\nOne potentially attractive\ntarget for pharmacological interference\nin the HIV-1 life cycle is the virus\u2019 requirement for a programmed\n\u22121 ribosomal frameshift (\u22121 PRF) in order to express\nits enzymes.6 Ribosomal frameshifting is\na recoding mechanism common among viruses with polycistronic (multiple\nopen reading frames, or ORFs, in a single gene) genomes. It allows\nviruses to translate polypeptides in different ORFs by avoiding the\nstop codon(s) present in the single mRNA transcript. In HIV-1, the pol gene is in the \u22121 reading frame with respect\nto gag. Gag, the precusor of the viral structural\nproteins, is produced via normal translational rules, while Pol, the\nprecursor of the viral enzymes, is synthesized as a fused Gag-Pol polyprotein via \u22121 PRF. This occurs with a frequency\nof 5\u201310% of ribosomes translating the full-length viral mRNA.\nA critical molar ratio of Gag-Pol to Gag protein is required for HIV-1\nreplication and infectivity; alterations to this ratio have been shown\nto be detrimental.7 \u22121 PRF in HIV-1\nis controlled by two cis acting mRNA elements: a\nheptameric slippery sequence (U UUU UUA), with the 0 frame indicated\nby spaces and where the frameshift actually occurs, and a downstream\ntwo-stem helix immediately following the slippery sequence, also known\nas the frameshift stimulatory signal (HIV-1 FSS, Figure 1).8 While several mechanisms have\nbeen proposed to account for the frameshift,9 it is currently hypothesized that this event results from an incomplete\ntranslocation for a limited number of ribosomes, due to resistance\nof the FSS to unwinding.10\u221212 These ribosomes then start translation\nof pol in the new \u22121 reading frame. Modification\nof the slippery site or stimulatory sequence (either via natural variation\nor laboratory mutations) in ways affecting frameshifting efficiency\ntranslates to a decrease in viral replication.13,14 These and other results have led several groups to propose \u22121\nPRF as a potential target for developing antiretroviral agents for\nHIV-1.6,15\u221217\n\nNMR structural analyses indicate that the HIV-1\nFSS RNA consists\nof a G-C rich upper stem-loop structure,18 separated from a flexible lower stem by a GGA trinucleotide bulge\n(Figure 1).19,20 The bulge\nproduces a roughly 60\u00b0 bend between the upper and lower stems.\nThe upper stem-loop is exceptionally stable. This stability is believed\nto play a vital role in the stimulation of the frameshift, since the\nribosome must unwind the stem during translation. The lower stem is\nthermodynamically less stable. The highly structured ACAA tetraloop\nis uncommon among tetraloops21 but is conserved\namong all HIV-1 group M subtypes except the uncommon H and J subtypes.\nLikewise, the heptameric slippery sequence is conserved across all\nHIV-1 group M subtypes. SHAPE analysis of the intact HIV genome suggests\na more complex structure for the FSS RNA, although the upper stem-loop\nis retained.22,23\n\nSince other viruses also\nrely on frameshifting,24 targeting frameshift-regulating\nstructures may have general\nutility beyond the context of HIV. For example, human T-cell leukemia\nvirus type 2 (HTLV-2) uses two \u22121 PRF events similar to HIV-1\nin order to synthesize fused Gag-Pro and Gag-Pro-Pol precursor proteins.25 The RNA responsible for the \u22121 PRF essential\nfor expression of Gag-Pro in HTLV-2 also consists of two cis-acting RNA elements, a heptanucleotide (AAAAAAC) slippery site and\na stem-loop shown in Figure 1.26 This HTLV-2 FSS served as a sequence specificity control\nin the experiments we describe herein.\n\nThe first attempted use\nof a synthetic molecule to alter HIV-1\nframeshifting and thereby influence viral replication was reported\nby Green and co-workers in 1998.27 The\nauthors showed that 1,4-bis[N-(3-N,N-dimethylpropyl)amidino]benzene tetrahydrochloride,\na bis guanidinium-containing compound termed \u201cRG501\u201d, was able to stimulate \u22121 frameshifting,\nalter the\nGag-Pol:Gag ratio, inhibit HIV-1 replication in CEM cells (a lymphocytic\ncell line), and interfere with the formation of viral particles in\nchronically infected CH-1 cells (a COS cell line stably transfected\nwith HIV-gpt, an HIV derivative in which the E. coli gpt gene replaces HIV env(28)). Increases in reverse transcriptase (RT) following treatment with\n1.5 mM RG501 were also observed, as would be\nexpected for an increase in Gag-Pol production. Recently, the Butcher\ngroup confirmed that this compound indeed binds the HIV-1 FSS RNA\nwith weak affinity (KD \u223c 360 \u03bcM),\nand they carried out NMR structure analysis, indicating that RG501 binds in the major groove of the upper stem-loop.29 Unfortunately, as noted by the authors, RG501 is a relatively nonselective binder and interacts\nwith other RNAs. It stimulates frameshifting in viruses with different\nFSS,29 and likely that also interacts with\nthe ribosome.6RG501 is also toxic,27 a likely result of its\nlack of selectivity. Moreover, its interference with HIV replication\nbegins at concentrations below those observed to affect frameshifting.27,24 Other compounds such as guanidinoneomycin,30 idarubicin, and doxorubicin31 have been\nshown to bind the HIV-1 FSS. Doxorubicin was found to bind with a KD of 2.8 \u03bcM, decreased frameshifting in\na rabbit reticulocyte assay, and also significantly reduced overall\ntranslation. A screen of an Arg-rich peptide library revealed a sequence\nable to significantly reduce frameshifting, but this displayed no\nselectivity for the HIV-1 FSS relative to other frameshift-stimulating\nconstructs and likely also interacts with the ribosome.32 Thus, as far as we are aware, there are no reported\nexamples of synthetic molecules able to alter HIV-1 frameshifting\nand interfere with viral infectivity via selective, high-affinity\nbinding to the FSS RNA.\n\nBuilding on our laboratory\u2019s\nlongstanding interest in understanding\nthe factors that drive affinity and sequence selectivity in small\nmolecule recognition of RNA,33 we previously\nreported the use of an 11,325-member resin-bound dynamic combinatorial\nlibrary34 (designed based on the structure\nof DNA-binding, bisintercalating peptide antibiotics) to identify\na compound (1) able to bind the HIV-1 FSS upper stem-loop with moderate\naffinity (KD = 4.1 \u00b1 2.4 \u03bcM\nimmobilized on an surface plasmon resonance (SPR) chip via one of\nits amine groups; KD = 350 \u00b1 110\nnM in solution as measured by fluorescence35) and good selectivity.36 Subsequent efforts\nrevealed that replacement of the disulfide bridge with an olefin (to\nproduce compounds 2 and 3) could be accomplished without any\nreduction in affinity. These studies also indicated that affinity\nwas essentially abolished if the \u03c0-surface area of the molecule\nwas reduced, while the peptidic portion of 1 was required for sequence-selective binding.35\n\nWhile the binding ability of 2 and 3 was intriguing,\nsubsequent\npreliminary experiments indicated the compounds were unable to inhibit\nvirus in a pseudotyped HIV-1 assay (data not shown). Given these results,\nwe hypothesized that further increases in affinity were essential.\nWe anticipated that increasing the \u03c0 surface area of 1 could represent a viable strategy\nfor enhancing the affinity for the HIV-1 FSS without significant reductions\nin selectivity. In particular, incorporation of a benzo[g]quinoline moiety to produce 4 and 5 was viewed as attractive. This hypothesis was supported in part by parallel efforts\nin our laboratory on the design and synthesis of compounds targeting\nCUG repeat RNA in which incorporation of a benzo[g]quinoline was found to enhance affinity and to provide compounds\nwith activity in vivo in a mouse model of Type 1 Myotonic Dystrophy.37 Synthesis of 4 and 5 proceeded via cross-metathesis\nof half-structure 6, by analogy\nto our previous work. We also synthesized 7 and 8 (\u201cone-armed\u201d\nbenzo[g]quinoline-bearing structures), as well as\ncompounds 9 and 10, to test the effect of sequential removal\nof the putative intercalators. Compound 11 was synthesized in order to ascertain the effectiveness of\nthe olefin bioisostere in improving cellular availability and bioactivity\nrelative to an easily reduced disulfide.\n\nBefore analyzing the effect\nof compounds on HIV-1 frameshifting in cells, we verified that they\nwere capable of crossing cell membranes, and not toxic at reasonable\nconcentrations. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293FT) were treated\nwith 4, 5, and 11 at concentrations\nof 50, 100, 200, and 500 \u03bcM for 12 h. Cells were then washed\nusing standard methods41 to ensure that\ncell staining was not simply due to surface capture. The inherent\nfluorescence of the benzo[g]quinoline chromophore\nin these compounds allowed direct visualization of cell penetration\nvia fluorescence microscopy (Figure 2 shows\nresults for 50 \u03bcM treatment; additional images are provided\nin the Supporting Information), confirming\nthat cells internalized all three compounds. Compounds did not appear\nto localize in any specific subcellular structures but were visible\nthroughout the cytoplasm and nucleus.\n\nCell viability was analyzed\nusing the WST-1 assay.42 Compounds were\nincubated with HEK 293FT cells cultured\nin DMEM for 24 h, after which a 10:1 media to WST-1 cell proliferation\nreagent mixture replaced the growth media for 2 h. Absorbance was\nthen measured at 450 and 690 nm. Disulfide linked compound 11 proved toxic at concentrations above\n10 \u03bcM, while no significant toxicity for compounds 4 and 5 occurred\nat concentrations below 60 \u03bcM (Figure 3). The higher toxicity observed for 11 relative to 4 and 5 is not surprising and likely reflects\nthe lability of the disulfide bond in the reducing environment of\nthe cell.\n\nCompounds were next evaluated for\ntheir ability to alter HIV-1 FSS-dependent\nframeshifting, using a dual-luciferase reporter assay.43 In this system, the FSS sequence has been inserted\nbetween Renilla (Rluc) and firefly (Fluc) luciferase\ngenes. Several constructs were employed. In the pDualHIV(\u22121)\nconstruct, Fluc is in the \u22121 reading frame relative to Rluc,\nwhile, in the pDualHIV(0) construct, Fluc is in the 0 reading frame\nrelative to Rluc. In both cases, Fluc is expressed only as a fused\nRluc-Fluc protein, but in the case of pDualHIV(\u22121), a \u22121\nframeshift is required. To ascertain if compound-dependent effects\non frameshifting are specific to HIV-1, we also carried out an analogous\n\u22121 PRF assay using constructs in which the HTLV-2 frameshift\nsite44 was inserted between Rluc and Fluc genes, such that Fluc is only synthesized\nby a \u22121PRF event [pDualHTLV-2 (\u22121)].45\n\nHEK 293FT cells were transiently transfected separately\nwith pDualHIV(\u22121) and pDualHIV(0) plasmids. The frameshift\nefficiency (defined as the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activities) in the pDualHIV(\u22121) transfected cells\nwas measured in the presence of varying concentrations of compounds\n(0\u201350 \u03bcM). A statistically significant (p < 0.005) dose-dependent increase in Fluc to Rluc ratios, >50%\nat 50 \u03bcM, was observed following treatment with 4 or 5 (Figure 4). Control compound 10, which showed no measurable binding to the HIV-1 FSS by SPR,\nhad no significant effect on \u22121 PRF in pDualHIV(\u22121)\ntransfected cells under similar conditions. In HEK 293FT cells transfected\nwith the pDualHIV(0) plasmids, the fused Renilla-firefly\nluciferase protein is synthesized by conventional translation rules,\ni.e. without ribosomal frameshifting. Therefore, to confirm that the\nobserved effect in pDualHIV(\u22121) cells is a direct effect of\ncompound on frameshift-dependent translation, pDualHIV(0) transfected\ncells were treated analogously with compounds 4 and 5. No change\nin Fluc to Rluc ratio relative to untreated pDualHIV(0) transfected\nHEK 293FT cells was observed, suggesting that 4 and 5 specifically\nstimulate \u22121 frameshift translation in cells. Disulfide linked 11 stimulated HIV-1 frameshifting by\napproximately 25% (Supporting Information); this lower effect compared to the cases of 4 and 5 is consistent\nwith its lower affinity to the HIV-1 FSS and likely lability in the\ncell. Treatment of HEK 293FT transfected with the pDualHTLV-2 (\u22121)\nconstruct with compounds 4, 5, or 11 resulted in no change in Fluc/Rluc ratio compared to the\ncase of untreated cells. This is consistent with in vitro SPR results\nin which no binding was observed between these compounds and the HTLV-2\nFSS RNA.\n\nIn order for the observed \u22121 frameshift\neffect of compounds\nto be significant, it was important that it correlate to an equivalent\nreduction in viral replication. To assess this, we analyzed the effect\nof compounds in a single-round infection with pseudotyped HIV in HEK\n293T producer cells and TZM-bl target cells (a HeLa cell line).46 The wild type HIV proviral vector (pDHIV3-GFP)\ncodes for all HIV-1NL4\u20133 genes except nef (which is replaced with GFP) and env, thus preserving gag and pol, and the frameshift required\nfor production of the Gag-Pol polyprotein. Preliminary experiments\nwith 2 and 3 showed no activity in this assay. However, we observed\na statistically significant (p < 0.001) and concentration-dependent\ndecrease in infectivity of the pseudotyped HIV-1 virions when producer\ncells were treated with 4 and 5 (Figure 5).\nThe decrease in infectivity was >90% at a concentration of 20 \u03bcM 4, and >90% at a concentration of\n40\n\u03bcM for 5. The core peptide\nalone (10) showed a modest decrease\nin infectivity at a concentration of 40 \u03bcM, likely via nonspecific\neffects, given its lack of affinity for the FSS. EC50 values\nfor 4 and 5 were 3.9 and 25.6 \u03bcM, respectively. The protease\ninhibitor Indinavir was tested in parallel to calibrate the assay;\nits EC50 was found to be 14.8 nM, in line with previously\nreported values.47\n\nWhile virus titer was determined in these experiments using\nan\nELISA assay to normalize viral load into target cells, a compound-dependent\ndecrease in viral production was also readily observable via fluorescence\nmicroscopy, as the pseudotyped HIV carries GFP as a marker (Figure 6). Phase-contrast images of these cells showed no\nmorphological changes, consistent with WST-1 results (Supporting Information). The concentration range\nrequired for a decrease in viral infectivity by 4 and 5 was similar\nto the range at which a significant increase in \u22121 frameshift\nwas observed in HEK 293 FT cells, supporting the hypothesis that these\ncompounds exert their antiviral activity primarily by altering \u22121\nPRF. In order to provide further support for this hypothesis, viral\nparticles were isolated from supernatants from these experiments by\nspinning through a 20% sucrose cushion, and probed via Western blot\nfor the presence of reverse transcriptase (RT). As RT is produced\nonly as part of the Gag-Pol fusion, increasing amounts of RT relative\nto capsid protein p24 (a structural protein produced as part of Gag)\nwould be required given an increase in frameshifting. Indeed, that\nis what is observed as a function of added 4 or 5 (Figure 7). The amount of RT in unprocessed Gag-Pol (p160)\nrelative to mature RT (p66 + p51) also increased significantly; this\nmay indicate that treatment with compounds 4 and 5 also inhibits Pol\nprocessing. However, the pattern of p160 cleavage intermediates observed\non treatment with Indinavir is significantly different, indicating\nthat 4 and 5 likely do not directly interact with viral protease\n(Supporting Information p S19).\n\nDesigning small molecules\nthat target specific RNA sequences and\nelicit a desired RNA mediated biological response constitutes one\nof the signature challenges in chemical biology.48,49 In this paper, we have demonstrated that a moderate-affinity \u201chit\u201d\ncompound for the HIV-1 FSS RNA, obtained from a resin-bound dynamic\ncombinatorial library screen, can be transformed into high-affinity\nbinders. An intriguing observation from our initial screen36 was the finding that a symmetrical compound\nwas selected, despite the target RNA being nonsymmetrical. This work\nconfirms that both putative intercalators are required for high-affinity\nbinding, as compounds 7 and 8 had only weak affinity for the FSS.\nStructural analysis will be essential to fully understand the binding\nmode of 4 and 5, but the recognition of a nonsymmetrical RNA\nbinding site by a symmetrical, dimeric molecule is not unprecedented;\nfor example, Arya and colleagues have described the use of neomycin\ndimers for recognition of HIV TAR RNA,50 and the Hergenrother group designed deoxystreptamine dimers that\nbound nonsymmetrical RNA loops.51 Likewise,\nstructural information should prove useful for understanding the significantly\nhigher selectivity of 4 for FSS\nRNA over FSS DNA and tRNA relative to 5.\n\nThese enhanced compounds are able to alter frameshifting\nin a dual\nluciferase assay in HEK 293FT cells and strongly inhibit viral infectivity\nin a pseudotyped HIV assay. Relative to previously studied compounds\ntargeting frameshifting in HIV, compounds 4 and 5 produce a roughly\nequivalent increase in RT at a 37.5-fold lower concentration than RG501. As such, compounds 4 and 5 represent promising\nleads for further study, as well as interesting tools to further investigate\nthe mechanism of \u22121 PRF. Since the pseudotyped HIV used in\nthis assay is only capable of one round of replication, we anticipate\nthat stronger effects will be observed with wild-type HIV in a spreading\ninfection assay. Of course, further enhancements in affinity and selectivity\nwould likely improve activity as well. As discussed above, previous\nhigh-throughput screening efforts targeting frameshift-modulating\ncompounds in which bicistronic reporters provided the assay readout\nlargely yielded compounds acting on the ribosome. Given this observation,\nit has been suggested by others that assays focused on direct binding\nto the FSS RNA could be advantageous, as such compounds could potentially\nincrease frameshifting by inhibiting unwinding of the upper stem-loop.6 The results presented herein support this hypothesis.\nIn the context of HIV biology, our results with compounds 4 and 5 indicate that an increase in frameshifting and a concomitant\nincrease in the Gag-Pol/Gag ratio decreases viral fitness. This is\nconsistent with the work of Mak and colleagues, who increased the\nGag-Pol/Gag ratio via cotransfection.52\n\nCommercially\navailable reagents were obtained\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), TCI America (Portland,\nOR), Fisher Scientific, EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ), Advanced ChemTech\n(Louisville, KY), and Alfa Aesar, and were used without further purification\nunless otherwise noted. Water used for reactions and aqueous workup\nwas glass-distilled from a deionized water feed. Reagent grade solvents\nwere used for all nonaqueous extractions. Reaction progress was monitored\nby analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using EM silica gel\n60 F-254 precoated glass plates (0.25 mm). Compounds were visualized\non the TLC plates with a UV lamp (dual wavelength; \u03bb = 254 nm,\n\u03bb =360 nm). Synthesized compounds were purified using flash\ncolumn chromatography on EM silica gel 60 (230\u2013400) mesh or\nalternatively via preparative reversed phase HPLC. Cells were cultured\nin Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM), supplemented\nwith 10% FBS and 1% penicillin\u20131% streptomycin. Premixed WST-1\ncell proliferation reagent was purchased from Clontech, and luminescence\nassays were carried out using a Promega dual-luciferase assay kit\nfollowing manufacture\u2019s instructions.\n\n1H NMR spectra were recorded at\n25 \u00b0C on either a Bruker Avance 400 (400 MHz) or Bruker Avance\n500 (500 MHz) instrument and processed using MestReNova NMR processing\nsoftware. Chemical shifts (\u03b4) are reported in parts per million\n(ppm) downfield from tetramethylsilane and referenced to the residual\nprotium signal in the NMR solvents. Data are reported as follows:\nchemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet,\nm = multiplet, and q = quartet), coupling constant (J) in Hertz (Hz), and integration. 13C spectra were recorded\nat 25 \u00b0C on a Bruker Avance 500 instrument operating at 126 MHz.\nChemical shifts (\u03b4) are reported in ppm downfield from tetramethylsilane\nand referenced (except in D2O) to the primary carbon resonance\nin the NMR solvent. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu FT-IR\nspectrophotometer. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were acquired\nat the University of Buffalo Chemistry Department Mass Spectrometry\nFacility, Buffalo, NY.\n\nCompounds\nwere synthesized following\nprocedures analogous to those previously reported.35,37 All compounds were produced in >95% purity, as determined by\nanalytical\nHPLC. Briefly, 4 and 5 were synthesized\nfrom olefin precursor monomer 6, which was assembled\non Wang resin by standard Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)\nmethods. One half of the resin-bound monomer was cleaved using 50%\nTFA in DCM with 1% TES, and was used as solution phase partner in\nan olefin metathesis reaction employing Grubbs\u2019 second generation\ncatalyst. The olefin products (isomer ratio of Z/E = 2:3) were isolated using reverse phase HPLC on a C18\ncolumn (Waters, XBridge Prep C18 5 \u03bcm OBD, 19 mm \u00d7 250\nmm) using gradient elution from 5 to 100% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA in\nwater/0.1% TFA. Olefin geometries were assigned by comparing the olefin\nproton chemical shifts of the E-olefin downfield\nto the Z-isomer and also by the infrared spectra of the compounds\nas described previously.37\n\nCompounds 7 and 8 were synthesized by a slight modification\nto the procedures described above. The tripeptide (Phe-Pro-AllylGly)\nwas first assembled using Fmoc peptide coupling chemistry on Wang\nresin. The resin-bound tripeptide was then separated into two equal\nparts. 2-Ethyl benzo[g]quinoline carboxylic acid\nwas coupled to half the material and cleaved with TFA. This was then\nemployed as the solution phase component in olefin cross-metathesis\nwith the remaining bead-bound portion of Fmoc-protected tripeptide.\n\nSurface\nplasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed on a BIAcore-X\ninstrument (BIAcore, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) on a CM5 sensor chip.\nApproximately 2000 RU of streptavidin (Rockland Immunochemicals) was\nimmobilized in both flow cells using EDC/NHS chemistry. 5\u2032-Biotinylated-RNA\n(either 500 nM 5\u2032-biotin-HIV-1 FSS or 500 nM 5\u2032-biotin-HTLV-2\nFSS RNA sequences, obtained commercially from Integrated DNA Technologies\nInc.) was captured onto the streptavidin surface in one flow cell\nto a density of approximately 300\u20131200 RU. The streptavidin\nsurface in the second flow cell was then blocked with biotin solution\nand served as a reference cell to correct for any nonspecific binding.\nBinding constant measurements were carried out for each compound once\non a \u201clow density\u201d (approximately 300 RU) chip and once\non a \u201chigh-density\u201d (approximately 1200 RU) chip in\norder to ensure binding was not influenced by RNA density. Kinetic\nbinding experiments were carried out by flowing various concentrations\nof compound in (a) HBS buffer (0.01 M HEPES, 0.150 M NaCl, pH = 7.4)\nat a 60 \u03bcL per min flow rate or (b) 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl,\n5 mM MgCl2, and 0.005% Tween-20 at a 50 \u03bcL per min\nflow rate over the captured RNA sequence. Where necessary, a 20 s,\n0.5 or 1 M aqueous NaCl injection was sufficient for regeneration\n(compounds displaying fast off-rates did not require regeneration\nof the chip between injections). Binding constants were obtained by\nglobal fit (conditions (a)) of association and dissociation phases\nof at least five referenced-subtracted and blank-corrected sensorgrams\nto a 1:1 Langmuir binding equation, or via individual fits (conditions\n(b) using BIAevaluation software). Injection of each concentration\nwas repeated at least twice for consistency.\n\nFluorescence titrations were\ncarried out in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, using a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer.\nAll titrations started at a volume of 500 \u03bcL with the compound\nat 1 \u03bcM. RNA was then titrated in from a high-concentration\nstock (10 \u03bcM for HIV-1 FSS RNA; 40 \u03bcM for HIV-1 FSS DNA\nand tRNA) in 1\u201310 \u03bcL increments. After RNA was added,\nthe solution was thoroughly mixed in the cuvette via pipetting and\nallowed to stand for 10 min to reach equilibrium. Each measurement\nwas taken three times with a 1 min waiting period between scans to\nconfirm equilibrium was reached. Intensities were corrected for dilution.\n\nHEK 293FT cells grown to 80% confluence\nat 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 were exposed to compounds at a\nconcentration of 50 \u03bcM for 12 h in a 96-well tissue culture\nplate. After removal of the culture media [DMEM containing 10% FBS,\n1% penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO)], the cells were washed twice with\nPBS to remove excess and surface-bound compounds. Cells were then\nimaged while in buffer under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70)\nin the 96-well plate using 358-nm excitation and 460-nm emission filters.\n\nHEK 293 FT cells were plated in a 96-well\ntissue culture plate in DMEM (10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin)\nand allowed to grow to 80% confluence at 37 \u00b0C under CO2. Varying compound concentrations (up to 0.5 mM) and control (identical\nvolumes of sterile H2O) in triplicate were incubated with\ncells for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. Ten microliters of Premix WST-1 cell\nproliferation reagent (Clontech) was added to each well including\nblanks (DMEM), followed by a 2 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C. Absorbances\nmeasured at 450 and 690 nm were subtracted and blank corrected. The\ndifference in absorbance was plotted against compound concentration.\n\nHEK 293FT cells were plated in 96-well plates at densities of 1.5\n\u00d7 104 cells/well 6 h before transfection in DMEM (10%\nfetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin). Cells were transiently\ntransfected in separate wells with 0.2 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA (pDualHIV(0),\npDualHIV(\u22121), pDualHTLV-2(0), or pDualHTLV-2(\u22121)), using\nlipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) and following\nthe manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Five hours after transfection,\nvarious compound concentrations (0\u201350 \u03bcM) were added\ndirectly to the cells in triplicate and incubated for 36 h at 37 \u00b0C.\nThe culture media was gently aspirated, washed with 1\u00d7 PBS, and\nlysed with 200 \u03bcL 1\u00d7 passive lysis buffer. Rluc and Fluc\nactivities were measured with 5 \u03bcL of cell lysate and 25 \u03bcL\nof luciferase reagent using the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega)\nin the same wells. Fluc and Rluc luminescence values were measured\non a Modulus microplate reader (Turner Biosystems). Relative frameshift\nefficiencies were calculated by comparing the Fluc/Rluc luminescence\nratio of cells treated with compounds to untreated cells.\n\nThe antiviral activity of 4, 5, and 10 was measured by single-round\ninfectivity assay with pseudotyped HIV-1 using HEK293T producer cells.\nThe HIV-1 proviral vector (pDHIV3-GFP) codes for all HIV-1NL4\u20133 genes except nef (replaced with GFP) and env, thus preserving gag and pol, and the frameshift required for production of the Gag-Pol polyprotein.\nA single-round infectivity assay was conducted by transient transfection\nof the viral vector with VSV-G coat protein vector at a ratio of 1:0.5\nusing Fugene HD (Promega). The virus producer cells were dosed with\ncompounds four hours after transfection, and viral particles were\nharvested from the media 24 h after transfecting by filtering through\na 0.45-\u03bcm syringe filter. Viral load was normalized with a p24\nELISA (Perkin-Elmer).\n\nThe infections were performed using TZM-bl\nreporter cells that contain stably integrated firefly luciferase that\nis driven by the HIV-LTR promoter. Therefore, luciferase is expressed\nupon successful HIV infection.53 Triplicate\ninfections in 96-well plates at 10,000 cells/well with 500 pg p24/well\nproceeded for 48 h before the addition of SteadyGlo Reagent (Promega)\nto each well for 30 min. Luminescence was measured as a quantitative\nmetric for changes in viral infectivity in the presence of compound."}
