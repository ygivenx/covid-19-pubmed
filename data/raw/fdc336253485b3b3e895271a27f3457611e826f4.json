{"title": "MicroRNA-based strategy to mitigate the risk of gain-of-function influenza studies HHS Public Access Author manuscript", "body": "The seasonal pathogen influenza A virus has the potential to cause catastrophic pandemics. Owing to the segmented nature and replication dynamics of its RNA genome, influenza A virus can undergo gene reassortment and/or accumulate mutations that permit its persistence and evolution in nature as well as its adaptation to new hosts 3 . For example, influenza A virus circulates in birds as a pathogen of the digestive and respiratory tracts but, on occasion, gains the capacity to jump species and establish respiratory infections in mammals 3 . Although many strains of IAV circulate in migratory bird species at any particular time, the H5N1 strain has caused several hundred human deaths since 1997, and public health authorities are concerned that it may evolve to become as deadly as the 1918 H1N1 4 . The recent emergence of H7N9 infections in humans in China is causing similar concerns 5 .\n\nAlthough H5N1 is already capable of causing significant morbidity and mortality in humans, transmission thus far has been largely restricted to birds 6, 7 . Humans infected with H5N1 seem to acquire the virus from direct contact with birds. Human-to-human, ferret-to-ferret and pig-to-pig transmission of H7N9 viruses also appears to be inefficient 5, 8 . However, as mutations may confer human transmissibility of H5N1 and H7N9 strains, defining the determinants of avian influenza virus transmission and using this information to monitor circulating avian strains regularly for transmission potential may improve global preparedness in the face of a novel pandemic. Recent findings suggest that three amino acid substitutions are sufficient to enable airborne transmission of H5N1 strains between ferrets 1, 2, 9 ; however it should be noted that when introduced into currently circulating strains these particular mutations are not sufficient to switch HA binding preference from avian to human receptors 10 . In addition, natural recombinations between the seasonal H1N1 and avian H5N1 can confer transmissibility in guinea pigs 11 . These findings raised serious public concern about whether the scientific community should be generating mammalian transmissible influenza A viruses, even within the controlled setting of enhanced biosafety level three containment 12 . Here we present an approach to mitigate safety concerns associated with avian influenza A virus gain-of-function studies. Building on previous work showing that microRNA (miRNA)-binding sites engineered into the influenza A virus genome can suppress influenza A virus gene expression and infection 13, 1415 , this approach relies on endogenous miRNAs to limit viral tropism. Specifically, we exploit speciesspecific differences in miRNA expression to engineer a virus that is transmissible among animals of a desired experimental species but not among humans.\n\nWe screened small RNAs from human and ferret lung cells as well as Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) by small RNA deep sequencing. As ferrets are routinely used in influenza A virus transmissibility experiments, and MDCK cells are often used to grow influenza A virus, we searched for miRNAs that are abundant in human A549 lung cells but absent in ferret lung cells and MDCK cells (the latter two species are both of the order Carnivora). Small RNAs from human lung A549 cells, MDCK, and primary ferret lung were isolated, cloned, and deep sequenced. Plotting specific reads over total reads allowed us to identify miRNAs that were abundant in A549 human lung cells (defined as over 1% of total) but absent or nearly absent, in both ferret lung and MDCK cells ( Fig. 1 Northern blot of small RNAs isolated from human A549 cells and ferret lung was performed to corroborate the miRNA expression pattern observed using sequencing ( Supplementary  Fig. 1a) , and to rule out potential binding of other miRNAs to the Northern blot probe, a labeled antisense oligonuclotide used to detect small RNA which can also act as a surrogate for miRNA target sites. In contrast to the sequencing data, Northern blot revealed substantial expression of miR-193b in ferret lung; Northern blot supported only miR-138 and miR-192 as miRNAs with the potential to facilitate 'molecular biocontainment'. We next measured the abundance of miR-192 and miR-138 in murine lung; only miR-192 was detectable at levels sufficient to silence influenza A virus ( Supplementary Fig. 1b) . Furthermore, Northern blot analyses of human lower respiratory tract bronchus and alveolar cell lines revealed robust miR-192 expression ( Supplementary Fig. 1c) . Additionally, quantitative PCR revealed that upper respiratory tract primary human nasal epithelial cells express approximately two-fold more miR-192 than do alveolar cells ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ). These data are consistent with previous studies demonstrating miR-192 expression in primary human tracheal bronchial epithelial cells 16 . Given the disparate expression of miR-192 between ferret versus human and murine respiratory tracts, we pursued miR-192 as a miRNA potentially capable of restricting influenza A virus replication in humans and mice but neither ferrets nor MDCK cells.\n\nPast studies that engineered miRNA target sites into influenza A virus RNA genome inserted the miRNA target site into the nucleoprotein (NP) segment, because NP is essential for virus replication and fitness 13, 14 or into NS1 15 . However, to prevent the possible reassortment of the hemagglutinin (HA) segment, here we chose to insert the miR-192 target site into segment four, which encodes HA. To this end, we duplicated the 5\u2032 packaging sequence of segment four viral RNA (vRNA), thus creating an untranslated region (UTR) at the 3\u2032 end of HA mRNA (Fig. 2a) . Without modifying the duplicated packaging sequence, we inserted scrambled non-coding (nc) RNA (ctrl) or four fully complementary miR-192 target sites (192t) into this region (Fig. 2a) . These modifications did not alter the amino acid composition of HA or the biology of segment four, as the miRNA target site is inserted downstream of the HA stop codon but upstream of the duplicated packaging sequence.\n\nFor in vitro and in vivo studies, we utilized an H5 HA in which the polybasic cleavage domain, a virulence motif that confers protease-independent virus replication and systemic spread 17, 18, 19 , is replaced with an avirulent H5 (termed HAlo) 20 . The H5 HAlo virus, in the influenza/A/PR8 backbone, maintains high replicative capacity in vitro and in mice 20 . Engineered virus strains were rescued by plasmid-based transfection and amplified in MDCK cells, which do not express miR-192 ( Supplementary Fig. 1e ).\n\nWe performed single cycle growth curves to measure the abundance of HA and NP in MDCK cells, MDCK cells engineered to express miR-192 (MDCK192), or A549 human lung epithelial cells that express endogenous miR-192. WT influenza A virus, influenza A virus engineered to express a scrambled miRNA target site (ctrl), and influenza A virus engineered to express the miR-192 target site (192t) expressed similar amounts of HA and NP in MDCK cells. However, HA expression from the 192t virus was ablated in MDCK192 or A549 cells, suggesting that the HA segment was subject to post-transcriptional silencing in a sequence-specific manner (Fig. 2b) .\n\nTo measure the effect of miR-192 targeting on influenza A virus replication, we performed multicycle growth curves. WT and ctrl virus strains grew to similar amounts regardless of miR-192 expression ( Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). In contrast, 192t virus replication was significantly blunted in MDCK192 and A549 cells compared to MDCK cells. (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2 ).\n\nTo determine the targeting potential of miR-192 within the dynamics of an intact pulmonary system, C57BL/6 mice were infected intranasally with WT, ctrl or 192t virus. Consistent with miR-192 expression and in vitro virus growth (Fig. 2b, c) , mice infected with 192t virus demonstrated no signs of morbidity and did not succumb to the infection (Fig. 3a, b) . In contrast, infection with WT or ctrl virus resulted in weight loss and all animals succumbed to infection within eight days after infection. Strikingly, even when the dose of 192t virus was increased by one order of magnitude, the mice showed no signs of morbidity or mortality. These results illustrate that species-restricted miRNA targeting of HA can provide robust protection even when the lethal dose is exceeded by at least 10-fold. Consistent with the weight loss and survival data, we detected a reduction in pulmonary titers of 192t compared to WT or ctrl viruses at three and five days post infection; we also noted a reduction in the amount of 192t HA and NP protein (Fig. 3c , d and Supplementary  Fig. 3 ). To determine if the reduced, but not absent, levels of virus replication in the 192t infected animals is a result of virus escape from miRNA targeting, either through mutation or complete excision, 5 days after infection we plaque purified 192t virus from the lungs of mice and sequenced all isolates. All seventeen of the 192t virus plaques isolated contained perfect miR-192 target sites (data not shown). These data are consistent with previous studies describing miRNA-mediated influenza A virus targeting, where no evidence of virus escape in vivo was detected; these results demonstrate the safety of this molecular biocontainment platform 13, 14 . Taken together these data demonstrate that species-specific miRNAs expressed in the lung are capable of blunting in vivo influenza A virus infections and preventing virus-induced disease.\n\nIn order to be useful in transmission studies, inserted miRNA target sites must not alter virus biology within the experimental animal model of interest. To determine if our engineering of miRNA target sites in influenza A viruses alters virus biology in ferrets, and to extend our results to a second viral strain, we used the seasonal H3N2 Wyoming strain, which demonstrates aerosol transmission in ferrets 7 . Similar to H5 HAlo we duplicated the 5\u2032 packaging sequence of HA vRNA thus creating a 3\u2032 UTR in H3 mRNA allowing insertion of four perfect miR-192 target sites or a scrambled ctrl site. To confirm miR-192 mediated attenuation of H3N2 virus, we measured growth kinetics in MDCK and A549 cells. We detected an approximately 100-fold reduction in growth of 192t compared to control virus in A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b) , suggesting that miR-192 can attenuate this H3N2 virus.\n\nTo assess the effect of miR-192 target site engineering on dynamics of virus spread, we performed classic ferret transmission studies. We directly compared the transmission of unmanipulated WT, ctrl and 192t H3N2 viruses (Fig. 4) 21 . Infected ferrets were exposed to na\u00efve animals by direct contact or by aerosol transmission and virus levels were monitored by nasal wash. Direct inoculation (DI) of WT, ctrl or 192t resulted in nasal washes with high viral titers as early as day one that slowly dissipated over the 10-day infection (Fig. 4a-c) . For WT, ctrl and 192t H3N2 infections, DI of virus resulted in spread by both direct contact (DC) and respiratory contact (RC) infection (Fig. 4a-c) . Consistent with the absence of miR-192 expression in ferret lungs, incorporation of miR-192 target sites did not prevent transmissibility in these animals. To ensure genetic stability of the recombinant HA segment in ferrets, we isolated and sequenced virus from ferrets at day seven post-aerosol transmission; we detected no evidence of excision events (data not shown). Taken together these data suggest that the insertion of miRNA target sites is stable in vivo and does not prevent transmission in this experimental animal model.\n\nTaken together, these data demonstrate that species-specific miRNAs can be exploited to mitigate the potential risks associated with transmission studies of IAV. Adding this proposed molecular biocontainment measure to existing physical safety precautions, such as the use of enhanced biosafety level 3 facilities and protocols, would greatly reduce the possibility of viral escape. One potential concern regarding this approach is the possibility of escape mutants. However, the absence of escape mutants in this study and in studies of comparable miRNA-targeting strategies suggest that escape is unlikely 13, 14 . No escape was observed even in viruses with polymerases of lower fidelity, suggesting that the selective pressure imposed by RNAi is too great to yield bona fide escape mutants 22 . In events where escape does occur, the entire targeted sequence is excised 23, 24 ; we did not detect such an event in either of our in vivo systems. In any case, additional measures could be employed to further enhance safety including the targeting of multiple segments with either the same or unique species-specific miRNAs. Compounded targeting would not only minimize the possibility of escape, but also further blunt replication in desired cells and hosts.\n\nLastly, it should be noted that this strategy is not necessarily restricted to influenza A virus. It may also be used to alleviate risks associated with potential gain-of-function experiments of other highly pathogenic viruses including Ebola, SARS coronavirus, and henipaviruses, amongst others. The only requirements for this approach are miRNAs that are absent in cells of the model system where replication is meant to occur but present in human cells, and a genetic system to permit the insertion of miRNA target sites into the genome.\n\nPurification of total RNA, isolation, cloning of the small RNA fraction, sequencing and analysis on the illumina platform, and Northern blots were performed as previously described 13 . Northern blot probes: miR-192: 5\u2032-GGCTGTCAATTCATAGGTCAG-3\u2032, miR-193b: 5\u2032-AGCGGGACTTTGTGGGCCAGTT-3\u2032, miR-138: 5\u2032-CGGCCTGATTCACAACACCAGCT-3\u2032 and U6: 5\u2032-GCCATGCTAATCTTCTCTGTATC-3\u2032. Quantitative PCR for the detection of miR-192 was performed on 10 ng of RNA using the TaqMan (Applied Biosystems) reverse transcription kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. cDNA was then analyzed using TaqMan probes specific for mature miR-192 and miR-20a on a realplex thermocycler (Eppendorf). miR-20a was used for normalization as levels are similar between human A549 and ferret lung samples.\n\nCalu3 (human bronchial epithelia) cells were purchased from ATCC (HT-B55) and were confirmed to be mycoplasma free. A549 (human small airway) cells were purchased from ATCC (CCL-185). Human nasal epithelial cells suspended in RNAlater were purchased from Promocell (C-14062). F56 (ferret fibroblasts) cells were derived directly from na\u00efve ferret lung parenchyma. MDCK (canine kidney) cells were kindly provided by Dr. Peter Palese (MSSM). MDCK cells expressing full-length primary miR-192 (MDCK192) were generated similar to MDCK cells expressing miR-142 13 . These A549, MDCK and MDCK192 cells have not been tested for mycoplasma contamination.\n\n181 or 154 nucleotides of the 3\u2032 end of H3/Wyoming and H5/Vietnam HAlo mRNA were duplicated respectively, and inserted immediately upstream of their cognate stop codons by site directed mutagenesis. This recreated the endogenous open reading frame for HA with a non-overlapping packing sequence separated by a unique Cla1 site. The Cla1 site, located immediately 3\u2032 to the HA mRNA stop codon, was used for insertion of miR-192 (5\u2032-GGCTGTCAATTCATAGGTCAG-3\u2032) or scrambled (5\u2032-ATCGATAGGAATTTACCAAAT-3\u2032) targeting sequences. Viruses were rescued by standard reverse genetics, plaque purified, sequence confirmed, and quantified by plaque assay. Multicycle growth curves were performed in MDCK, MDCK192 and A549 cells in the presence of TPCK trypsin. Supernatant was harvested at the indicated time-points and titers assessed by plaque assay. The limit of detection for all virus titration experiments is 20 pfu.\n\nSingle cycle infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection of one and whole protein was extracted and separated on a 7.5%-10% SDS/PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). Membrane was blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk at 25 \u00b0C, and then incubated with the indicated primary antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Antibodies specific for actin (PA5-17568 Thermoscientific), H5 HAlo (DPJY02 (3B2) NR-19870 bei Resources, works in HI, WB, IFA, ELISA), and NP (NR-4544 bei Resources) were added at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL in 5% skim milk. Serum from H5 HAlo infected mice was used at a 1:5000 dilution. Secondary mouse antibodies (NA931V GE Healthcare) were used at a 1:5000 dilution for 1 h at 25 \u00b0C. Protein was detected using Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore) as directed by the manufacturer.\n\nAll animal experiments were performed in accordance with Mount Sinai School of Medicine Institution of Animal Care and Use Committee. C57BL/6 8-week old female mice were purchased from Taconic. For these experiments mice were not randomized and investigators were not blinded. Mice were anesthetized with a ketamine, xylazine, H 2 O mixture then infected intranasally with 100 pfu of WT, ctrl or 192t H5 HAlo virus. Where indicated mice were infected with 1,000 pfu of 192t H5 Halo virus. Lungs were harvested at three and five days post infection and homogenized in PBS either for direct titering or protein analysis.\n\nAnimal studies were performed as described previously with minor modifications 1 . Briefly, transmission studies were performed in an ABSL2+ facility at the Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Maryland. Animal studies described were carried out according to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Maryland (protocol RO-09-93). For these studies ferrets were not randomized and investigators were not blinded. Prior to inoculation, 23-week-old female ferrets (Sayre, PA) were housed in holding BSL2 for 1.5 weeks to establish a baseline for temperature, weight, and general health. Serum from each ferret was assayed by NP-specific ELISA to rule out prior IAV exposure. Transponders were implanted subcutaneously to provide a means of identification and temperature determination. Ferrets were inoculated with 10 5 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ), the amount of virus required to infect 50% of infected cell cultures, diluted in PBS (0.5ml total volume, 0.25ml/nostril was administered intranasally). Directly infected ferrets were inoculated one day prior to the introduction of the na\u00efve direct contact and respiratory contact ferrets. Ferrets were nasal washed (0.25ml PBS/nostril) every day following the administration of anesthesia and assayed by FluDetect (Synbiotics Corp.). Nasal washes continued until animals tested negative for two consecutive days. To prevent cross contamination, ferrets were handled in the following order: RC, DC, DI. Gloves were changed between every virus group. Once an RC ferret tested positive, they became the last to be nasal washed. All viruses, including nasal wash samples and virus stocks, were titrated in MDCK cells by TCID 50 . Titers were read using 0.5% Turkey RBC three days postinfection.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. Species-specific miRNA expression. Small RNAs were isolated from the human lung epithelial cell line A549, from ferret lung, and from madin-darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Small RNAs were cloned and deep sequenced. Graph depicts percent of each miRNA among total miRNA, and displays the ten miRNAs most highly expressed in A549 cells. Species-specific miRNA-targeting of influenza A virus does not impact virus capacity to infect, replicate or transmit between ferrets. Ferrets were directly infected with WT (a), ctrl (b) or 192t (c) H3N2 viruses and monitored by nasal wash on indicated days post infection (dpi). Infections induced by direct contact (left panels) or respiratory contact (right panels) were determined by nasal wash of na\u00efve animals co-housed with directly infected animal.
