{"title": "Establishment of primary transgenic human airway 1 epithelial cell cultures to study respiratory virus - 2 host interactions 3", "body": "However, in order to fully utilize the potential of this culture system it must be made amenable to 66 genetic modification. Transgenesis would enable the study of viral and/or host factors important for 67 respiratory virus infections and allow for the elucidation of specific mechanism involved in virus-host 68 interactions by targeted gene knockdown or overexpression. However, using primary cells for genetic 69 modification is challenging since they have a finite life span in cell culture. Primary human bronchial 70 cells can only be limitedly passaged after isolation if differentiation capabilities are to be maintained 71 [16] . The incorporation of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 has been 72 shown to increase the number of passages primary cells can undergo in vitro without gross influence 73 on cell differentiation capacity [17, 18] . Theoretically, this would enable the generation of genetically 74 modified well-differentiated primary human airway epithelium in vitro.\n\nDue to the extended culture time required for hAEC culture establishment and differentiation, 76 and the fact that well-differentiated cultures can be maintained for months [19] , stable integration of 77 any genes to be expressed post-differentiation is required. Therefore, we established our protocol 78 using lentiviral vectors, where the proviral genomic material is integrated directly into the cellular 79 genome. Furthermore, such a system allows for the integration of both transgene and shRNA 80 scaffolds for over expression and/or knockdown of both host and viral factors [20] [21] [22] .

Monolayer cultures of Once cells reached confluency, the apical and basolateral medium was changed to air-liquid 111 interphase (ALI) medium, and one day later the apical side medium was aspirated, establishing ALI.\n\nThe epithelial layer was allowed to differentiate for at least four weeks prior to any analyses.\n\nBasolateral medium was changed every other day during the differentiation period. Additionally, the \n\nWell-differentiated cultures were stained using the following primary and secondary antibodies 180 (tables 1 and 2). \n\n.

However, intact cultures are refractory to 236 both apical and basolateral transduction while damaged cultures can be transduced from the apical 237 side when the basolateral side of the epithelium is exposed. In those cultures, GFP expression is only 238 observed around the edges of damaged epithelium (data not shown). This is consistent with the 239 observation that receptors for VSV-g are predominantly located on the basolateral side of polarized The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Thus, the removal of the inhibitor from culture medium upon LLI 307 culture seems to be sufficient for the cells to proceed through differentiation normally post-treatment.\n\nTo confirm proper epithelial structure and morphology, hAEC cultures from both treated and 309 non-treated cells were stained for nuclei (DAPI), cilia (\u03b2-tubulin) and tight junctions (ZO-1). In low 310 passage (p2) the two groups share the same structure and morphology (data not shown). However, in 311 p4, only Y-27632 treated cells, independent of donor, were able to maintain epithelial integrity 312 post-differentiation. Non-treated cells in p4 seem to differentiate normally early on, evidenced by the 313 presence of ciliated cells, but eventually the epithelial layer dissociates and detaches ( Figure 2C ).

This is further corroborated by the uniform reduction of 531 GFP expression by shGFP1 in our double transgenic hAECs, in which the MFI of GFP fluorescence is 532 reduced by approximately 40%. Due to low inoculation dose (MOI 0.1), we hypothesize that the 533 amount of shRNA targeting the viral GFP mRNA transcript simply is not sufficient to achieve a 534 pronounced reduction of the logarithmic increase of viral replication. Adaptation of the inoculation 535 dosage or even the Polymerase III promoter in the lentiviral vector to achieve a higher cellular 536 concentration of shRNA might reveal a different phenotype. It has been reported that the viral 537 nucleoprotein of HCoV-229E counteracts RNA silencing [44] , which might also be the case for hRSV, 538 rendering our shRNA ineffective against these viruses. Further characterization and validation of this 539 phenomenon is fascinating but beyond the scope of this study.\n\nTaken together, these results demonstrate that we have successfully established a robust and 541 reproducible protocol to make hAEC cultures amenable to genetic modification using lentiviral 542 vectors. This will greatly facilitate detailed studies on molecular virus -host interactions in primary 543 human airway epithelium. "}
