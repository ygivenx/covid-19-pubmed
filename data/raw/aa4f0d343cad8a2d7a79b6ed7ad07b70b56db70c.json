{"title": "Infectious causes of necrotizing enterocolitis", "body": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common surgical emergency in premature infants, affecting approximately 7% of infants < 1500 g birth weights 1 . Universally described risk factors include prematurity, aberrant microbial colonization and lack of human milk feeding 2 . NEC's clinical presentation is nonspecific and can range from signs limited to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (e.g., feeding intolerance, ileus, abdominal distention, hematochezia) to catastrophic illness with multi-organ failure (e.g., lethargy, apnea, metabolic acidosis, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy) and death 3 . Since its first mention in the medical literature over 150 years ago, NEC has stimulated intensive research in its etiology and despite seminal discoveries of epidemiological and molecular risk factors and pathways, the pathogenesis remains unclear 4 . One reason for the lack in progress is inclusion of diseases closely resembling classical NEC as a complication of preterm birth such as spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP), NEC in term infants, cowmilk intolerance and viral enteritis 5 .\n\nThe role of bacteria as significant contributors to NEC has been identified since the first systematic descriptions of this disease 6, 7 . Pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous gas are pathognomonic radiographic signs of NEC 8 and thought to be caused by anaerobic bacteria, specifically clostridia 9 . Gram-negative bacteria have been most frequently associated with NEC and the epithelial receptor and innate immune sensor Toll-Like receptor (TLR) 4 is elevated in the premature intestine and required for development of experimental NEC 10, 11 . NEC can occur in clusters and seasonal outbreaks of virus-associated NEC cases have been reported [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Here we attempted to summarize the main published data on the role of microbes in NEC.\n\nBacteria are clearly involved in the pathogenesis of NEC (Table 1 ) and despite the paucity of randomized control trials to determine the optimal antimicrobial regimen in premature infants, treatment with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics remains a mainstay of the clinical management 17, 18 . However many open questions remain, including the role of specific bacterial overgrowth as the cause or the consequence of NEC, timing of bacterial colonization during fetal/neonatal development and type of molecular interactions between different microbes and their host 19 . Despite the abundance of bacteria in the premature intestine early in life 20 and the clinical appearance of gram-negative sepsis, a positive blood culture is uncommon in infants with NEC 21,22 . This is surprising given the frequent growth of bacteria in peritoneal fluid 23 . In 80 cases of NEC with intestinal perforation, Enterobacteriacae were present in the peritoneal fluid in 75% of cases, coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) in 14% and anaerobes in 6% 23 . Interestingly, despite similar age at time of intestinal perforation and similar mortality, the distribution of predominant organisms cultured from peritoneal fluid differed significantly between patients with NEC and SIP. Candida species (44%) and CoNS (50%) dominated samples from 36 patients with SIP 23 . Specific bacteria have been suggested as important contributing factors in NEC 24,25 and NEC occurs typically after the first week post-partum after the intestine has been colonized. In contrast one study on human NEC samples using laser capture microdissection and subsequent sequencing combined with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and bacterial rRNA-targeting oligonucleotide probes did not detect dominating potential pathogenic bacteria and suggested that NEC is a \"non-infectious syndrome\" 9 .\n\nBacteria shape normal immune development including the development of T regulatory cells (Treg), which are critical for reducing inflammation-mediated injury 26-29 . Another example is recruitment of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) after microbial colonization of germ-free mice 30 . IEL are reduced in human NEC suggesting that paucity of normal commensals in the newborn gut may alter intestinal immune development 31 . Infectious complications of pregnancy such as chorioamnionitis increase the risk for NEC either by direct bacterial colonization or through the anatomical and immunological changes following the inflammatory challenge of the developing intestine 25,32-36 . Independent epidemiological association between chorioamnionitis and NEC is difficult to prove, as chorioamnionitis is also the most important risk factor for prematurity and the vast majority of severe NEC cases occur in extremely premature infants. However, after adjustment for antenatal steroid prophylaxis, gestational age, and surfactant treatment, the presence of intrauterine infection and FIRS remained independent predictors for NEC in several studies 32,33 . Increased gastric neutrophil counts have been demonstrated in chorioamnionitis-exposed preterm infants, reflecting a proinflammatory state of the gut shortly after birth 37 . Moreover, presence of microbes and inflammatory markers in the gut mirror that of the amniotic fluid when chorioamnionitis is present 38 . Preterm labor and chorioamnionitis are also linked with abnormal intestinal development and fetal proliferation of activated T cells in the immature intestinal mucosa 35 . At the same time, ileum Treg cell proportions are reduced in chorioamnionitis while activated T effector cells are increased 39,40 . Reduced Treg proportions in the small intestinal lamina propria characterize NEC in human disease and in animal models, suggesting the possibility of bacteria-induced fetal immune priming as a risk factor for NEC 41-43 .\n\nThe C-type lectin RegIII\u03b3 and its human counterpart, hepatocarcinoma-intestine-pancreas/ pancreatic associated protein (HIP/PAP), are antimicrobial proteins that bind peptidoglycan, a molecule that is exposed on the surface of gram-positive bacteria. RegIII\u03b3 expression is developmentally regulated and dependent on normal microbial ecology 44 . While the exact role and developmental regulation of HIP/PAP is unknown in human infants, lower levels especially in preterm infants could lead to aberrant intestinal colonization with grampositive bacteria.\n\nStaphylococcus epidermidis-Colonization of the maternal genital tract with Staphylococcus sp. has been associated with a significantly increased risk for chorioamnionitis (OR 18.4) 33 . The small intestine is colonized with staphylococci shortly after birth and in patients with or without NEC, specifically in infants delivered via Cesarean section 20,45 . CoNS were found to preferentially translocate through intestinal wall after ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice 46 Importantly, a lack of enteral nutrition and exposure to total parenteral nutrition alone reduce intestinal barrier function 47 . CoNS are frequently cultured from postnatal stool samples and appear to increase the risk for NEC development 48 .\n\nClostridia species-Clostridia are spore-forming anaerobic motile gram-positive rods. They can be found in soil and the human GI tract and can be considered part of the normal intestinal flora in newborns, especially premature infants exposed to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) environment and infants fed formula 49,50 . Therefore when isolated during disease, it is difficult to establish if they are pathogens or normal flora 51 . However NEC patients with positive cultures for Clostridia sp. have more extensive pneumatosis intestinalis, a higher incidence of portal venous gas, faster progression to more severe necrosis and intestinal perforation with higher mortality 52, 53 . Clostridium spp. were significantly more prevalent among samples from a preterm piglet model of NEC 54 .\n\nClostridia sp. have been implicated in NEC for many years because the clinical presentation of diseases caused by these toxin-producing strains often resembles NEC. For example pseudomembranous colitis as a result of overgrowth of toxin-producing C. difficile in the colon can present with hematochezia and multi-organ failure 55 . Enteritis necroticans, known as pigbel in Papua New Guinea, is a segmental necrotizing infection of the jejunum and ileum caused by C. perfringens, Type C 56,57 .\n\nClostridium perfringens-C. perfringens frequently colonizes the intestine of preterm infants within the first 2 weeks postpartum 58 . C. perfringens types A-E form 12 different toxins: \"major\" toxins (e.g. \u03b1-toxin = phospholipase C), collagenase, protease, hyaluronidase, deoxyribonuclease, enterotoxin, and neuraminidase 59 . C. perfringens \u03b1-toxin is produced by all 5 types of bacteria (A-E) and increases capillary permeability, induces platelet aggregation, hemolysis, myonecrosis, decreases cardiac contractility, and is lethal 60 . C. perfringens was identified as a causative agent of NEC in 22% of cases in 1 study in one study 61 . Compared with the control group (n = 32), the onset of disease was earlier in life, portal venous gas was more common (77%), the clinical course more severe and the mortality rate more than twice as high (44%) 61 . Another study isolated C. perfringens in patients with fatal outcome and suggested has the potential to trigger a fulminant and often lethal course 62 . C. perfringens has been declared as a possible risk factor for NEC as it was recognized by molecular techniques in the first 2 weeks postpartum in 3 infants who later developed the disease 63 . In one study C. perfringens was isolated from intestinal flora in 40% of infants with NEC compared with 13% of controls (p = 0.03) 64 and has been associated with an NICU outbreak of NEC in another 65 . C. perfringens has also been associated with NEC in several animal models [66] [67] [68] .\n\nClostridium difficile-C. difficile is part of the commensal intestinal flora in humans but has recently attracted the attention of researchers due to its role as the most common cause of severe and refractory healthcare-associated diarrhea 69 . After intestinal overgrowth following antimicrobial use, toxigenic strains can cause pseudomembranous colitis, ranging from mild diarrhea to fulminant colitis. C. difficile's two major toxins TcdA and TcdB, disrupt host cell function by inactivating small GTPases that regulate the actin cytoskeleton 70 . Both toxins can manifest disease on their own 71 . During infancy, asymptomatic colonization with toxin-producing C. difficile is common and has been associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition 58, [72] [73] [74] [75] . Delivery or exposure to human flora has no effect on colonization, and C. difficile originates from the NICU environment rather than maternal transmission 76, 77 . The involvement of C. difficile in NEC is controversial since toxin-producing C. difficile strains are not more frequently recovered in NEC 78 . However, C. difficile-associated NEC cases have been described during a C. difficile outbreak 79, 80 .\n\nClostridium butyricum-C. butyricum produces butyric acid through fermentation and a specific strain (MIYAIRI) is widely used as a probiotic in Asia 81 . It can be isolated from soil, feces of healthy children and adults as well as soured milk and cheeses. Type E can produce a neurotoxin and has been implicated in cases of botulism 82 . Several reports state isolation of toxin-producing C. butyricum from peritoneal fluid, blood and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with NEC 83 . C. butyricum has been suggested as primary cause of NEC in outbreak situations, but because of lack of adequate controls its primary role has been questioned 84, 85 . Isolation of C. butyricum in blood samples of infants with NEC may have resulted from mucosal breakdown and transmigration of these bacteria into the bloodstream 86 . In a community analysis of bacteria found in tissue specimens from infants with NEC, presence of C. butyricum and C. parputrificum highly correlated with histological pneumatosis intestinalis 21 . Interestingly, C. butyricum strains isolated from NEC cases can cause cecal lesions in animals with gas cysts, hemorrhagic ulceration and necrosis [87] [88] [89] . Lactose fermentation and production of butyric acid seem to be a prerequisite and colonization with bifodbacterium was protective 67, 90 . Attachment of C. butyricum to the ileal mucosa has been associated with NEC in preterm, cesarean-derived and formula-fed piglets 54 .\n\nCronobacter sakazakii-With a reported incidence of one infection per 10,660 very low birth weight (VLBW, <1500 g) infants 91 , Cronobacter sakazakii (formerly Enterobacter sakazakii) 92,93 infection is rare. C. sakazakii has been isolated from powdered infant formula worldwide 94, 95 and NICU outbreaks of invasive disease have been reported [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] . Meningitis is the most prominent clinical manifestation 101 but outbreaks of NEC occurred in NICUs with isolation of C. sakazakii from multiple patient body fluids and cans with powdered infant formula 102, 103 . C. sakazakii is commonly found in soil, food items and other environmental sources 104 . Therefore inappropriate hygiene practices including storage, hand, nipple and bottle cleaning as well as temperature control after powdered formula reconstitution may contribute to infection. Powdered formula is not a sterile product and the World Health Organization recommends formula reconstitution with hot water (> 70 \u00b0C) (http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/micro/pif2007/en/). C. sakazakii binds to villi in the distal small intestine and can induce NEC from direct toxic effect to gut epithelium in the rat pup model 105 . C. sakazakii's best-characterized virulence factor, outer membrane protein A (ompA), binds and invades human epithelial cells 103 and brain endothelial cells [106] [107] [108] , while its enterotoxin functions similarly to LPS and modulates activation of Toll-like receptor 4 109 . OmpA also mediates recruitment of dendritic cells at the expense of neutrophils and macrophages leading to epithelial injury through TGF-\u03b2 production and iNOS activation 110, 111 .\n\nKlebsiella sp-Klebsiella sp. have been described in NEC outbreaks with nosocomial origin 112, 113 . It is also one of the most common organisms responsible for bacteremia in NEC 22, 114, 115 . A 1998 outbreak in Johannesburg was significant for isolation of a single clone of an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella in blood cultures of patients with NEC; notable for sudden decompensation leading to shock and severe thrombocytopenia in all cases, and for the absence of diarrhea or hematochezia 112 .\n\nE. coli-E. coli is a similarly common organism found in normal gut flora; among infants with NEC, it has been isolated in blood in up to one-third of cases 22, 114 . Both E. coli and Klebsiella were isolated in feces at markedly higher rates in infants with NEC than those without 116 . Several outbreaks of NEC associated with E. coli have been described 117, 118 . In one report 15 of 16 infants with suspected or confirmed NEC had either enterotoxigenic E. coli or its heat-labile enterotoxin recovered in stool 118 . A report of NEC associated with E. coli O157:H7 in a term infant resulted in death secondary to widespread intestinal necrosis 119 .\n\nPseudomonas-Pseudomonas is well known for its role in nosocomial and immunocompromised infections. It forms biofilms and can colonize hard surfaces and respiratory equipment, with mechanical ventilation as a risk factor for infection. However, Pseudomonas also colonizes the GI tracts of 10-42% of newborns 120,121 and 25-35% of normal adults 122 . Among VLBW infants, it is primarily responsible for late-onset disease (sepsis, pneumonia, NEC). There are a number of reports of Pseudomonas-associated NEC. A Taiwanese study reports 45 infants with Pseudomonas in the stool, of whom one had NEC, four had colonic perforations, and two infants died from sepsis 123 . Other studies noted an increased rate of NEC in infants with Pseudomonas bacteremia compared to nonbacteremic infants (36% vs. 7%, respectively), and with it a much higher mortality rate (up to 50%), especially when signs of septic shock were present 124, 125 .\n\nUnique in their lack of a cell wall, Ureaplasma are obligate intracellular mycoplasma that colonize human adult genital tracts. They may be vertically transmitted intrapartum, with nasopharyngeal colonization reported among 22% of NICU patients 126 . Colonization is associated with chorioamnionitis 127 , a known risk factor for NEC. However, the existence of a direct relationship between colonization with Ureaplasma and development of NEC is controversial. One study found a 2-fold increase in incidence of stage \u22652 NEC associated with elevated interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 beta among infants colonized with Ureaplasma (12.3% vs. 5.5%) 25 . Two other groups disagreed and found no increased incidence of NEC associated with Ureaplasma colonization 128,129 .\n\nA double-stranded DNA member of the Reovirus family, rotavirus causes GI disease by invading enterocytes and disrupting their absorptive and digestive activities 130 . Fecal excretion of rotavirus can be found in up to half of infants in the newborn nursery 131 . Although the majority sheds virus asymptomatically, 8-30% of infants present with vomiting and diarrhea 131, 132 . Rotavirus infection tends to peak in the late winter/early spring, though introduction of a vaccine in young children has interrupted this seasonality 130 . Several outbreaks of NEC have been associated with rotavirus infection with virus isolated from stool or serological diagnosis and concomitant evidence of infection among a significant portion of NICU staff members 133, 134 . Risk factors for development of serious GI disease included low birth weight and younger age 133 . Notably, rotavirusassociated NEC has been found to cause less severe disease compared to NEC without rotavirus 14 . Anatomic distinctions were also noted: left-sided, more distal colonic pneumatosis intestinalis in rotavirus NEC compared right-sided, ileal pneumatosis in nonrotavirus NEC 14, 135 .\n\nNorovirus (Norwalk virus), a non-enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus 136 , is the most important cause of foodborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis 137, 138 and secondleading cause (after rotavirus) of gastroenteritis in young children 139 . Both individual infections and outbreaks most commonly occur during winter 98 . Seventeen percent of 75 premature infants <32 weeks gestation shed virus in their stool over the first 4 weeks after admission in a NICU in Sydney 140 . Norovirus prevalence was 1.9%, representing roughly half of all infants in that cohort who shed virus 140 . Controversy exists regarding best methods viral identification with one report noting several norovirus-positive cases by ELISA that were not corroborated by RT-PCR or electron microscopy 141 . Specificity of each aforementioned method is reportedly >90% and positivity in two of the three tests confirms norovirus infection 142 . Norovirus has been thought to primarily affect the small intestine based on pathologic findings of villus blunting, crypt hypertrophy and edema among adults infected with norovirus [143] [144] [145] and mononuclear infiltrate and apoptosis in the jejunum and ileum of pediatric small bowel transplant recipients 146 . However, a recent report described three premature infants with norovirus infections with radiographic evidence of extensive colonic pneumatosis, and pathologic insult (fibrosis and hyperplastic vessels) limited to the colon 147 . Apnea was noted as the primary presentation of norovirus infection in a preterm infant who subsequently developed watery diarrhea and positive stool cultures 148 . Several small outbreaks associated with NEC have been described. The largest involved 8 cases of NEC with a 25% mortality rate, and noted that, in comparison to nonoutbreak NEC cases, those associated with norovirus had significantly lower levels of neutrophil band forms 149 . An outbreak of 8 cases of norovirus among premature infants was marked by abdominal distention, apnea, and increased gastric residuals. Vomiting and acute diarrhea were not predominant clinical features (27% and 0%, respectively), but one infant with proven norovirus developed NEC 150 . A case-control study noted an increased prevalence of norovirus in stools of infants with NEC compared to non-NEC controls (40% vs. 9%, respectively) and suggested an etiologic role of norovirus in the pathogenesis of NEC 16 .\n\nCytomegalovirus (CMV), a double-stranded DNA herpesvirus, is well known to cause serious neonatal disease in its congenital form, but has also been implicated in NEC. CMV transmission may occur via transplacental, intrapartum, or postpartum routes. Rates of perinatal CMV infection in premature infants have been reported to be as high as 15-20% 151, 152 . Given their immunocompromised status, premature infants are at particular risk for postnatal infection from breast milk (transmission rates 5-37%) [153] [154] [155] or via transfused blood products [156] [157] [158] [159] . Among immunocompromised patients, CMV enteritis is common and marked by diarrhea, hematochezia, and toxic megacolon 160 . In infants, however, CMV enteritis is unusual, and the virus is a disputed player in the development of NEC. Patients may present with diarrhea or with disease resembling NEC, but without distinguishing features such as intestinal pneumatosis 161 . However, several case reports linking confirmed cases of NEC to CMV infections have been reported, with clinical manifestations including abdominal compartment syndrome 162 , viremia and sepsis 163 , and colonic strictures 164 . In one particularly severe case, fulminant NEC leading to death was associated with stool culture positive for CMV but with notable reduction in diversity of bacterial flora, prompting speculation that intestinal CMV infection may predispose infants to NEC by altering intestinal immune responses and promoting secondary bacterial infection 165 .\n\nCoronaviruses are enveloped viruses with positive-sense RNA genomes that are known to cause respiratory 166 and serious GI disease among infants 167, 168 . A coronavirus outbreak was associated with hemorrhagic NEC and viral particles were visualized both in intestinal and fecal specimens 168 . In another outbreak of NEC, coronavirus was detected in stool in 23 of 32 (72%) infants. Sixty percent of bedside nurses also shed virus in stool, prompting speculation of nosocomial transmission 167 . As members of the coronavirus family, toroviruses are a known agent of diarrhea in cattle and horses and have been associated with GI disease in children. Torovirus infections are known to occur year-round, with a substantial portion though to be acquired nosocomially 169 . Its association in neonatal disease was first described in 1981, when \"virus-like particles\" similar to coronavirus were detected in stool of 80% of infants in an outbreak of bloody diarrhea, bilious gastric aspirates, and abdominal distention. Transmission was thought to be vertical, because all but one mother had flu-like or GI symptoms within two weeks of delivery, and viral particles were detected in meconium of several infants 170 . One study reported detection of torovirus in stools of 48% of its patients with NEC, and in 60% of those with stage III disease, although the presence or absence of torovirus did not affect mortality 171 .\n\nEnteroviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses encompassing multiple serotypes, including two specific viruses that have been associated with NEC: coxsackievirus and echovirus. These infections are seasonal, with the majority of cases occurring during summer and fall [172] [173] [174] [175] . Among 27 infants with enterovirus, three had NEC marked by fevers, abdominal distention, and bloody diarrhea; one had coxsackievirus B and died following exploratory surgery revealing dusky jejunum 176 . Another fatal case of NEC associated with widespread coxsackievirus B infection demonstrated ischemic ileum with subserosal hemorrhage; the child's parents were both febrile at the time of birth 177 . The clinical presentation of echovirus infection among premature infants ranges from asymptomatic to diarrheal illness 178 to upper and lower respiratory tract infections 179 . An outbreak of echovirus type 22 in a NICU resulted in a diarrheal illness among 12 premature infants, six (50%) of whom developed stage I NEC and one had pneumatosis intestinalis, but all survived. Identification of echovirus was via stool culture in most infants, though a few only had increased serum antibody titers 180 .\n\nAs single-stranded RNA viruses, astroviruses were first described in infants during an outbreak of gastroenteritis in a newborn nursery 181 . Few reports on the pathology of human astrovirus infection are available, but one study in a child following bone marrow transplant revealed villous blunting and inflammatory cell infiltrate in the duodenum and jejunum (not consistent with graft-versus-host disease) 182 . Alternatively, intestinal astrovirus infection in a turkey model leads to rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton on ultrastructural examination and evidence of sodium malabsorption secondary to redistribution of sodiumhydrogen exchangers 183 . There are multiple reports associating astrovirus with NEC 15,184,185 . One report detected astrovirus in stools of 6% of infants with either gastroenteritis or NEC. Infants with astrovirus more frequently acquired NEC (9/14) than those with norovirus (1/8) or rotavirus (2/12) 184 . Compared to uninfected infants, those with astrovirus had increased hematochezia (54 vs. 15%) and Bell stage II and III NEC (21 vs. 4%) 185 .\n\nOne case-control study suggests that maternal HIV infection places premature infants at higher risk for development of NEC (at a rate of 8.8% vs. 1.2% in children of HIV-positive and HIV-negative mothers, respectively) 186 . Additional case reports describe development of NEC in two infants born to HIV+ mothers; one infant also had trisomy 21 187, 188 . All HIV-positive mothers received antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and/or labor, and all infants received anti-retrovirals after birth; no infant was HIV positive. Authors speculate that reduced production of IL-12 and/or use of zidovudine may have predisposed infants of HIV-positive mothers to NEC 186 .\n\nCandida is a classically dimorphic organism that produces both yeast and hyphal forms, though certain species differ slightly (C. glabrata does not form hyphae, and C. parapsilosis forms pseudohyphae). In VLBW infants, fungal colonization occurs in the first week of life at an estimated rate of 27%, with Candida spp. making up the majority of organisms 189 . C. albicans is isolated in over 60% of cases of candidemia 190 . Among the NICU population, risk factors for both colonization and invasive disease include use of central venous lines, intravenous lipids, and histamine H2 receptor antagonists [191] [192] [193] . It is unclear whether intestinal colonization with Candida spp. is protective or a risk factor for NEC. In one study none of 7 infants with NEC had viable fungal organisms detected in stool 194 . Further complicating the picture is the frequent association of Candida with SIP 195, 196 . When Candida is linked to NEC, however, the results can be severe 197 ; 27% of fatal cases of surgically-treated NEC were associated with Candida sepsis, an outcome complicated by late diagnosis occurring either within 48 hours of death or at autopsy 198 . On pathologic examination of 84 patients with NEC, yeast and pseudohyphae were detected in both the intestinal lumen and wall 199 . Antifungal prophylaxis has been shown in a randomized controlled trial 200 to have benefit in reducing both colonization and invasive disease 201, 202 , but not NEC 201 or overall mortality 203 .\n\nNEC is a common and devastating problem for premature infants. Bacterial colonization appears to be a necessary but not sufficient contributor to NEC. While intestinal pathogens may cause NEC-like illness in animal models or occasional clinical outbreaks, they are not detected in most cases of classical NEC 204 . NEC outbreaks have been associated with clusters of viral GI infections but the clinical presentation may vary and often affect the large intestine. Future studies are needed to determine the impact of host-specific GI tract microbial communities on the development of NEC.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. "}
