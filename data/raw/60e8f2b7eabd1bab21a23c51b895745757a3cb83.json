{"title": "Highly pathogenic coronavirus N protein aggravates lung injury by MASP-2- mediated complement over-activation", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), that was initially reported in Guangdong, China, in November 2002, is a highly contagious and deadly respiratory disease (1, 2). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the novel etiological agent of this disease. Nearly a decade after the SARS outbreak, a new zoonotic coronavirus, 5 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified as the etiological agent of MERS (3) . Recently, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly to other provinces in china and all over the world. As of 19 March 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 230000 people with a fatality rate of 4.2% (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). Infection 10 of the virus caused severe atypical pneumonia similar to SARS-CoV infection (4). Although the pathogenesis of these diseases are being intensively investigated, it is still not well understood why the viral infections lead to respiratory failure with a high fatality rate (5) . The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein is a 46-kDa viral RNA-binding protein sharing only 20-30% homology with the N proteins of other known coronaviruses (6) , whereas N proteins of the highly 15 pathogenic coronaviruses are more similar, including SARS-CoV-2 (91%) and MERS-CoV (51%) by BLASTP (5, 7, 8) . The N protein is one of the most abundant viral structural proteins in patient sera during SARS-CoV infection (9). Potentially N protein plays a role in the virus pathogenesis as the pre-administration of N protein, but not other viral proteins, via recombinant vaccinia virus or Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles resulted in severe 20 pneumonia in aged mice challenged with SARS-CoV (10, 11) .\n\nThe complement system functions as an immune surveillance system that rapidly responds to infection. Activation of the complement system resulted in pathogen elimination and acute or chronic inflammation. Nevertheless, dysregulated complement activation has been implicated in the development of acute lung diseases induced by highly pathogenic viruses (12, 25 13). The complement system can be activated via the classical pathway (CP), the lectin pathway (LP), or the alternative pathway (AP) (14). In the LP, mannan-binding lectin (MBL) (or ficolins) binds to carbohydrate arrays of mannan and N-acetylglucosamine residues on the surfaces of the viruses or the surfaces of virus-infected cells, resulting in the activation of MBL-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2), the only known MBL-associated protease that can directly initiate 30 the complement cascade (15, 16) . MBL binds to SARS-CoV-infected cells in a dose-dependent, calcium-dependent, and mannan-inhibitable manner in vitro, enhancing the deposition of complement C4 on SARS-CoV (17) . The N-linked glycosylation site N330 on the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is critical for the specific interactions with MBL (18). Although higher levels of activated complement C3 and C4 fragments were found in SARS patients, indicating the 35 activation of complement pathways (19, 20) , the mechanism of SARS-CoV-induced complement activation is not well understood. It is also unknown whether a similar pathogenesis occurs in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nTo investigate the binding between the N protein of SARS-CoV and MASP-2, and to delineate the interacting domains of the two proteins, lysates of human 293T cells expressing Flag-tagged full-length MASP-2, the N-terminal CUB1-EGF-CUB2 region, or the C-terminal 5 CCP1-CCP1-SP region (Fig. S1A ) were subjected to anti-Flag immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag antibody-conjugated agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were next incubated with 293T cell lysates expressing GFP-tagged SARS-CoV N protein (GFP-SARS N) or truncated mutants in the presence of 2 mM CaCl 2 or 1 mM EDTA. The adsorbates were probed with anti-Flag or anti-GFP antibodies by immunoblotting. Associations between Flag-MASP-2 and GFP- 10 SARS N were observed only in the presence of CaCl 2 (Fig. 1A) , in agreement with the requirement of Ca 2+ for MASP-2-MBL binding and MASP-2 auto-activation. The CCP1-CCP2-SP region of MASP-2 ( Fig. 1A ) and the N-terminal domain (residues 1-175) of the N protein ( Fig. S1A and Fig. S1B ) were crucial for the association, whereas negative controls, or other truncated regions did not bind, and GFP-tagged full-length or truncated N protein did not co- 15 immunoprecipitate with mouse IgG conjugated beads ( Fig. 1A and Fig. S1B ).\n\nSARS-CoV N protein can be detected in patient serum as early as 1 day after the onset of symptoms (22) . To simulate the SARS-CoV N protein associations in serum, Flag-tagged N protein (1 ng/ml) was added to human or mouse serum and precipitated with anti-Flag antibody conjugated agarose beads. The SARS-CoV N protein interacted with MASP-2 derived from both 20 human and mouse serum (Fig. 1B) . Further truncation and deletion analysis showed that amino acid residues 116-124, which are located in a coil motif of the SARS-CoV N protein (residues 115-130), were indispensable for the interaction with MASP-2 (Fig. 1C) . However, the association of MASP-2 with SARS-CoV N\uf044321-323, a mutant that fails to form the N protein dimer (Fig. S1C) , was not much affected (Fig. 1C) . 25 The crucial motif in SARS-CoV N protein for MASP2 interaction (residues 116-124) share a high identity with the corresponding motif in SARS-CoV-2 N (115-123) and MERS-CoV N (104-112) (Fig. S1D ), suggesting that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV will also interact with MASP-2. As expected, exogenously expressed MERS-CoV N and SARS-CoV-2 N both associated with MASP-2 ( Fig. 1D and 1E ), and the \u0394104-112 deletion mutant of MERS- 30 CoV N exhibited the predicted reduced association (Fig. 1D ). Therefore, a common motif across coronavirus N proteins is important for MASP-2 binding.\n\nThe CCP1-CCP2-SP domains of MASP-2 are responsible for self-activation and 35 substrate binding activity, which in turn mediates complement lectin pathway activation (23). The MASP-2: N protein association demonstrated above suggests that SARS-CoV N protein may regulate MASP-2 dimerization, activation and cleavage. To demonstrate MASP-2 dimerization, MASP-2-Flag-conjugated beads were incubated with lysates of 293T cells expressing MASP-2-Myc in the presence/absence of N protein and MBL. Binding of MASP-2-(residues 445-686) resulting from MASP-2 auto-activation were produced in the presence of SARS-CoV N protein (Fig. 2B) .\n\nTo investigate the effect of SARS-CoV N protein on the MBL-binding capability of MASP-2, purified MBL and MASP-2 (24) were incubated in mannan-coated microplate wells at 4\uf0b0C to avoid MASP-2 activation, and the dynamics of MASP-2: MBL binding were assessed 5 using an anti-MASP2 antibody. Compared with human serum albumin (HSA), a highconcentration component in binding buffer used as a negative control for N protein, the binding of MASP-2 to MBL was significantly enhanced in the presence of SARS-CoV N protein at a relatively low concentration (1%~0.1% of MASP-2) and Ca 2+ , and the potentiation was effectively abrogated by anti-N protein antibody (Fig. 2C) . Moreover, SARS-CoV N protein 10 bearing the \uf044116-124 or \uf044321-323 deletion or N protein from the less pathogenic human coronavirus 229E-CoV showed little or no effect on MASP-2: MBL binding compared with the full-length SARS-CoV N protein (Fig. 2C) . These results indicated that SARS-CoV N proteinpotentiated MASP-2 activation is dependent not only on MASP-2 association but also on N protein dimerization. 15 MASP-2 cleaves complement components C4 and C2 to generate C3 convertase in the lectin pathway of the complement system upon activation. Next, the effect of the SARS-CoV N protein on LP complement activation was assessed by C4 cleavage. Purified C4 was incubated with MASP-2, Mannan, and MBL in the presence/absence of equal molar N protein, and C4 cleavage was observed to be significantly potentiated by the SARS-CoV N protein in the 20 presence of mannan and MBL ( Fig. 2D and Fig. S2A ). Accordingly, mutants of SARS-CoV N protein (\u0394116-124 and \u0394321-323) as well as N protein from H229E-CoV failed to promote MASP-2-mediated C4 hydrolysis ( Fig. 2E and Fig. S2B) . Notably, an anti-MASP-2 monoclonal antibody or C1INH, an inhibitor of MASP-2 (25), blocked SARS-CoV-potentiated C4 hydrolysis, suggesting that N protein-potentiated C4 cleavage was dependent on MASP-2 activation (Fig. 2E 25 and Fig. S2B ). Moreover MERS-CoV N was also found to potentiate C4 cleavage (Fig. S2C ). These results indicated that N protein prompts C4 cleavage and therefore complement activation by MASP-2 association and activation.\n\nThe impact of SARS-CoV N protein on complement activation via the lectin pathway was further investigated by complement deposition assays. Purified C4 was incubated with 30 immobilized MBL-MASP-2 complex in the presence of indicated N protein. The N protein of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 but not the H229E-CoV N potentiated C4b deposition, which was dependent on the activity of MASP-2, in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig.  2F-2H ). Then, immobilized mannan was incubated with C1q-depleted serum (to eliminate the classical pathway) (26) in the presence/absence of SARS-CoV N protein, and the deposited C3 35 fragments (C3b, iC3b and C3dg) were detected by an anti-activated C3 antibody. In concert with C4b deposition, the deposition of activated C3 was evidently increased along with the increase of SARS-CoV N protein levels up to ~40 nM (Fig. S2D) , suggesting an enhanced activity of C3 convertase. In addition, SARS-CoV N protein had little or no effect on activated C3 deposition in calcium-free buffer containing EGTA, which suggests that SARS-CoV N protein-potentiated 40 C3 activation occurs through the LP but not the AP pathway, in which C3 activation is Ca 2+independent (Fig. S3E ). As shown in Figure S2D and S2E, C3b deposition was decreased in the presence of a high concentration of N protein, possibly due to further cleavage of C3b by soluble inhibitors in serum (such as factor H and factor I) when the surface is coated with high densities of C3b (27, 28) . We further tested the deposition of the C5b-9 complex. As a result of amplified 6 complement cascades, significantly increased deposition of the complex was induced by SARS-CoV N protein at a much lower concentration (Fig. S3F ), similar to that observed in patient sera (22) . Activated complement plays a crucial role in the efficient phagocytosis of pathogens and cellular debris by C3b or C5b-mediated opsonization (29) . To study complement-dependent 5 phagocytosis, E. coli and mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated together in diluted serum with or without SARS-CoV N protein. Bound C3 or its large fragment C3b, the product after C3 cleavage, was stained with FITC-labeled anti-C3c antibody, and the FITC-positive macrophages containing C3-conjugated E. coli were counted under a microscope. In concert with complement activation, complement-dependent phagocytosis by mice peritoneal macrophage in 10 the presence of mouse serum containing complement component including MASP-2 was enhanced remarkably by SARS-CoV N protein compared with the HSA control (Fig. S3G ). These findings indicated that SARS-CoV N protein effectively promoted the activation and opsonic effect of the complement system. 15 \n\nPersistent activation of complement leads to uncontrolled inflammation. To investigate the effect of N protein-potentiated MASP-2 activation on inflammation, mice were pre-infected with adenovirus (1\u00d710 9 PFU) expressing SARS-CoV N (Ad-SARS N) or its mutant or adenovirus vehicle only (Ad-null). The mice were then challenged with LPS, which contains 20 MBL-binding motifs, to activate LP and induce inflammation (30) . 8 of 10 mice pre-exposed to adenovirus vehicle survived when challenged with 5 mg/kg LPS (Fig. 3A) , while all 10 mice pre-exposed to Ad-SARS N died within 12 hr after LPS administration at the same dosage (Fig.  3A ). Severe lung damage and massive inflammatory cell infiltration were also observed in dead mice (Fig. 3B ). In concert with previous findings, the pre-infection of Ad-229E N and Ad-SARS 25 N bearing the \uf044116-124 or \uf044321-323 deletion in the N protein, respectively, had significantly reduced effects on mouse mortality. Importantly, when anti-N, anti-MASP-2 antibody or C1INH was administered simultaneously with LPS administration in the Ad-SARS N pre-infected mice, both death rate and lung tissue inflammation induced by LPS were significantly reduced ( Fig. 3A and 3B). These results collectively demonstrate that the SARS-CoV N protein greatly potentiated 30 LPS-induced inflammation via MASP-2 activation, which thereby initiates LP-involved complement cascade activation.\n\nTo investigate the complement activation in lung of mice induced by LPS and N protein, mice pre-infected with Ad-SARS N (1\u00d710 8 PFU) were challenged with LPS (5 mg/kg). At 6 hr post LPS administration, the mice were sacrificed, and the paraformaldehyde-fixed lung tissue 35 was subjected to immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with anti-C4b antibody or immunofluorescence analysis with FITC-labeled anti-C3c antibody. The C4b and activated C3 deposition in the lung were significantly increased in mice expressing SARS-CoV N protein ( Fig. S3A ). 40 The in vivo association of MASP-2 with the N protein was further assessed by in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) with anti-N and anti-MASP-2 antibodies (the left panels of Fig.  3D and S3A), and red signals, which were only detectable when SARS-CoV N and MASP-2 bind to each other, were abundantly observed in pulmonary cells from mice expressing SARS-All rights reserved.

These results confirmed an in situ direct binding and activation of MASP-2 by SARS-CoV N in mice lung tissue.\n\nSimilarly, mice challenged with LPS suffered serious pneumonia and 100% die within 24 hr when pre-infected with adenovirus expressing MERS-CoV N protein (Ad-MERS N) but not its \u0394104-112 mutant (Ad-MERS N \u0394104-112 ) for 7 days, which was partially rescued by C1INH 5 and anti-MASP-2 antibody (Fig. 3E) . These results indicate that the N protein is employed by both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to promote complement activation through the MASP-2mediated lectin pathway.\n\nThe pathogenicity of N protein was further investigated using Masp2 knockout (KO) mice (KO region was indicated by Fig. S3B ) with MASP-2 protease activity deficiency by the 10 same way. Mice were pre-infected with Ad-SARS N or Ad-MERS N (1\u00d710 9 PFU) for 5 days, and then challenged with LPS. Compared with wild-type mice, Masp2 KO mice survived longer and had a higher survival rate (Fig. 3F ), which may be attributed to a compromised complement activation because of MASP-2 deficiency. 15 Because the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 induce only mild lung damage in mice, and investigation with live SARS-CoV, including mouse adapted SARS-CoV, is not allowed by related regulations in China, we try to get the clinical evidence that the over-activation of complement LP pathway occurred in COVID-19 patients. The paraformaldehyde-fixed lung tissue of patients who died of COVID-19 were collected and subjected to IHC staining with 20 MBL, MASP-2, C4alpha, C3 or C5b-9 antibodies. All these complement cascade components demonstrated strong IHC staining signals in the patient lung tissue ( Fig. 4A-4E ), which suggested that the complement components were deposited in type I and type II alveolar epithelia cells, as well as inflammatory cells, some hyperplastic pneumocytes, and exudates in alveolar spaces with necrotic cell debris. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 N protein was also observed in 25 the lung tissue of died patients by autopsy (31) . Further, significantly increased serum C5a level was also observed in COVID-19 patient, particularly in severe cases (Fig. 4F ). These results collectively indicated that complement pathways were aggressively activated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients, which may be attributed to SARS-CoV-2 N protein. 30 It has been widely accepted that the excessive inflammatory and cytokine storm greatly contribute to the severity and lethality of COVID-19, which may be attributed to the unrestrained activation of complement pathway. Therefore, downregulation of MASP-2 as well as its downstream signal molecules, such as the potent anaphylatoxin C5a, may provide a new approach to control the pneumonia induced by the SARS-CoV-2. 35 Based on our finding and its potential and tempting application in COVID-19 therapy, a recombinant C5a antibody (BDB-001 injection by Staidson Biopharmaceutics), which was in phase II clinical trial for hidradenitis suppurativa, was rapidly approved by National Medical Product Administration (NMDA) for phase II clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 (2020L0003). \"A multicenter, randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial in mild COVID- 40 19 patients\" and an open label \"two-cohort clinical trial in patients with severe and critical COVID-19\" were carried out simultaneously under the approval from ethic committee of Huoshensan Hospital with the informed consent of the patients. While the larger dataset from more patients in the COVID-19 cohort will be reported elsewhere when the trial is finished, here we reported the first 2 cases administrated with anti-C5a antibody in the open label trial.\n\nPatient #1, a 54 years old male resident in the city of Wuhan, was admitted to Dongxihu Hospital on the 4th days after the onset of symptoms (5 days of illness) with fever. Infection of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 \uff0c and chest CT scan showed 5 bilateral opacities. The disease was getting worse from day 9 of illness, with high fever (38.7\uf0b0C~39.8\uf0b0C), SpO2 <93% on room air, pneumonia progression on CT scan, and severe hepatic damage. Prednisone (40 mg/day for 4 days) was administrated on day 10 through 13 of illness but the condition deteriorated, so the patient was transferred to Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital, a new hospital established urgently for severe COVID-19 patients, on the day 14 of 10 illness (Fig. 5A) , and was considered as severe case in critical condition with moderate ARDS (oxygenation index <150), respiratory rate 30/min\uff0cand the Percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) drop to 77% when exposed to room air for 1 minute. Supportive care was provided\uff0c including high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) to target SpO2>95% (Fig. 5B, left) . He was also administrated with the antibiotics (moxifloxacin) and human serum albumin, while prednisone 15 was discontinued. Treatment with anti-C5a monoclonal antibody (BDB001) was initiated on the morning of day 15 of illness. The antibody was given intravenous in 250 ml saline, at a dosage of 300 mg/day, on day 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13. No adverse event was observed and the clinical condition improved in the next days, with normal body temperature in the evening of the same day (Fig. 5C, left) , increased oxygenation index (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) (Fig. 5B, left) and lymphocyte cell 20 number (Fig. 5C, left) , decreased C reactive protein (CRP) concentration (Fig. 5C, left) , and significantly improved hepatic function (shown by decreased ALT, AST, and increased total serum protein and serum albumin concentration) (Fig. 5D, left) . The fraction of inspiration O 2 and the gas flow rate of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) was eventually decreased from the highest (80%, 40 L/min to 30%, 20 L/min) to target a SpO2>95% (Fig. 5B, left) . Because the 25 high risk of taking the patient in critical condition to CT scan in the temporarily established hospital (the long distance and the cold raining weather without HFNO), no CT scan just before anti-C5a administration was available for evaluation. Nevertheless, the pneumonia 20 days after the 1st dose is observed obviously improved than 11 days after the 1st dose (Fig. S4 , upper panel). 30 Patient #2 was a 67 years old male who was admitted to the Sixth Hospital of Wuhan on the 5th day after the onset of symptoms (6 day of illness) with fever and cough. CT scan showed opacity on the superior lobe of left lung (Fig. S5A ). Infection of SARS-CoV-2 was also confirmed by rRT-PCR at day 11 of illness. Anti-viral (Arbidol) and antibiotics (moxifloxacin) was administrated together with other supportive treatment. Condition was worsening by day 8 35 with severe cough and high fever (39.7\uf0b0C) (Fig. 5C, right) . Methylprednisolone (40 mg/day, for 7 days from the 8th day after illness) showed little if any improvement of symptoms. The patient was transferred to Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital on day 10 (Fig. 5A ) and the illness continued getting worse as shown by SpO2 (<90% on room air on day 14), high fever (>39\uf0b0C on day 10-13) (Fig. 5C, right) and pneumonia on chest CT on day 11 of illness (2 days before the 1st dose) (Fig.   40 S4, lower panel). The patients reported severe cough, chest tightness and dyspnea. HFNO has to be given to maintain SpO2>95%. Anti-C5a was administrated on the morning of illness day 14, and continued as in the patient #1. Subsequently, a normal temperature was observed on the same day (Fig. 5C, right) . Cough, dyspnea and oppression in chest were reported to be getting better the next day (Day 15 of illness). A significant decreased C reactive protein (CRP) level, 45 All rights reserved.

Hepatic function was gradually improved (Fig. 5D , right, data on day 15 are not available). Flow rate and Fraction of inspiration O2 necessary to maintain SpO2>95% gradually decreased, with the increasing SpO2/FiO2 (Fig. 5B, right) . Chest CT on day 26 of illness (12 days after the 1st dose) also showed alleviated pneumonia (Fig. S4, lower panel) . 5 These data provided the first evidence for a damaging role of C5a in severely affected COVID-19 patients. The two severe patients are significantly benefited from anti-C5a monoclonal antibody therapy, which suggested that an aberrant complement cascade should be considered as a promising therapeutic target of COVID-19.\n\nIn the past 17 years, successively emerged SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 broke through the species barrier and brought new infectious diseases and social panic to human. All these highly pathogenic coronavirus cause acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), therefore resulting in an increased severity and lethality. Patients infected with the virus may develop to atypical pneumonia resulting from severe immune injury. The 15 excessive human immune responses that were characterized by the extensive release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, called a \"cytokine storm\" (5) , is thought to be the major initiator of the sever pneumonia caused by high pathogenic coronavirus, including the latest SARS-CoV-2 (4). Although immunopathogenesis has been partially implicated in SARS or MERS, the mechanism responsible for virus-induced hyper-activation of host immune system 20 remains poorly understood.\n\nHere we show that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a common mechanism connecting the viral N proteins to binding and potentiation of an MBL, Ca 2+dependent auto-activation of MASP-2, leading to the uncontrolled activation of complement cascade, as characterized by the enhanced C4 cleavage and complement deposition ( Fig. 1 and 2) . 25 The binding of N protein to MASP-2 amplifies the effects of MASP-2-mediated lectin pathway activation. N protein mutants either failed to interact with MASP-2 or failed to form an N dimer have little or no effect on MASP-2-mediated lectin pathway activation ( Fig. 1C and 1D) , suggesting that the effects of N protein are dependent on binding and dimerization.\n\nAs a \"dual-edged sword\", complement is critical for innate immunity against pathogens. 30 Anaphylatoxins, such as C3a and C5a, can activate immune cells, and therefore induce the release of various cytokines. Activated complement cascade produces the cytolytic terminal complement complex C5b-9 and the C3b and C5b fragments (29, 32) . These peptides induce the synthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites, including prostaglandin (PG) E2, thromboxane B2 and leukotrienes (30, 33) , which further induce the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, 35 monocytes and eosinophils, and stimulate the production of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators (34) . These cytokines trigger and maintain inflammatory processes and help the innate immunity to fight the virus. Nevertheless, complement-involved innate immunity activation must be fine-tuned because unrestrained complement activation always contributes to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), inflammation, cell death, and immune paralysis 40 and ultimately leads to multiple organ failure and death. The finding that the coronavirus N protein potentiating complement activation provides a new insight into the causation of pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we also noticed that the pre-infection of Ad-SARS N or Ad-MERS N evidently increased the fatality All rights reserved.

Coincidentally, SARS patients who produce higher levels of N protein specific but not spike 10 protein specific antibodies tend to recover more rapidly, suggesting that levels of N antibodies correlated with outcome of SARS (37). According to our findings, similar mechanisms may be present in MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nSecondly, Masp2 KO mice showed significantly mild symptoms and a shorter course of disease in LPS induced, N protein boosted mice pneumonia model, which confirmed the harmful 15 role of MASP-2 in this severe pneumonia. Accordingly, administration of anti-MASP-2 antibody or the MASP-2 inhibitor C1INH showed a promising treatment effect (Fig. 3) . Improved MASP-2 antibodies that have higher affinity and neutralization activity, such as OMS721 (38) (which showed promising effects on thrombotic microangiopathy), or an injectable C1INH medicine, such as HAEGARDA, may provide effective protection. Further clinical evaluation is of value to 20 be carried out for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia.\n\nThirdly, we've observed an excessive activation of complement cascade in lung tissue of dead patient, which is coincident with the observation in Ad-SARS N pre-infected and LPSprimed mice model. High-level C5a was accumulated in the serum of severe but not mild COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3 and 4) . So, it will make sense that complement cascade-targeted 25 immunomodulation may be effective for inflammation-control in highly pathogenic coronavirusrelated diseases. In this pathway, C5a is the most potent complement protein triggering inflammation. Blockage of C5a signaling has also been reported to improve treatment of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by highly pathogenic viruses (39) . Based on our scientific finding and the good safety record in phase II trial for other disease by Staidson and inflaRx GmbH (whom 30 produce the anti-C5a antibody in the same cell line), the recombinant anti-C5a antibody produced by Staidson Biopharmaceutics was approved by NMDA for the clinical trial for treatment of severe and critical COVID-19 patients. At least in the first two patients, both are in the disease deterioration, the anti-C5a antibody showed rapid and promising effect exceeding the expect of clinical physicians. Although the final efficacy will be released until the clinical trial is 35 finished, it is worth to expect that anti-C5a antibody would provide a new approach for the treatment of COVID-19. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 29.20041962 doi: medRxiv preprint\n\nThe Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting 20 Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 10 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin, 10 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin, and 10 \u00b5g/ml pepstatin A) containing 1% Nonidet P-40.

After induction with 1 mM IPTG for 8 h, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and re-suspended in buffer A (25 mM Na 2 HPO 4 /NaH 2 PO 4 (pH 8.0), 35 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT) before sonication. Soluble N protein in the lysate was purified with ion-exchange chromatography with SP-Sepharose Fast Flow (25 mM Na 2 HPO 4 /NaH 2 PO 4 (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 0.35-0.5 M NaCl), followed by Superdex 200 gel filtration (GE Healthcare) and elution with buffer A. E. coli transformed with the vector pET22b was lysed as described above, and the eluate was used as a negative control for the purified N Recombinant protein expression and renaturation were performed as described (24, 41) . In brief, pET22b-MASP-2 was transformed into the expression host strain BL21 (DE3). After induction with 1 mM IPTG, cells were harvested and sonicated. The inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 M GuHCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), and 100 mM DTT at room temperature; the solubilized proteins were then diluted into refolding buffers containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 3 mM 5 reduced glutathione (Sigma), 1 mM oxidized glutathione (Sigma), 5 mM EDTA, and 0.5 M arginine. The protein samples were then cooled to 4\u00b0C. The renatured protein was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 at 4\u00b0C, concentrated with PEG8000, aliquoted, and stored at -70\u00b0C.\n\nTo obtain high-activity MASP-2, Flag-tagged MASP-2 was expressed in 293T cells, 10 precipitated with anti-FLAG magnetic beads, and eluted with Flag peptide (Sigma). The concentration of MASP-2 was assessed using a BCA kit and immunoblot analysis, with the purified prokaryotic-expressed MASP-2 as a standard control.\n\nPurified MASP-2 (8 nM) was incubated at 37\u00b0C in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM 15 NaCl, and 2 mM CaCl 2 with purified C4 (Calbiochem), recombined MBL (Calbiochem), mannan (Sigma), and SARS-CoV N protein at concentrations of 50 nM, 30 nM, 15 ng/ml, and 10 nM, respectively. The cleavage was followed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the C4alpha' fragments, which are left by C4a release after C4 cleavage and can indicate C4 activation, and MASP-2 were detected by immunoblot analysis with anti-C4alpha chain antibody 20 (Santa Cruz) or anti-Flag antibody (Sigma). C4b containing C4alpha' but not C4a was used to indicate C4alpha' band position.\n\nThe C4b deposition assay was performed using a human MBL/MASP-2 assay kit (Hycult biotech) (42). In brief, diluted serum was incubated in mannan-coated plates with high salt 25 binding buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C and removed by washing, and the MBL-MASP-2 complex was captured. Purified C4 and N protein were added and incubated for 1.5 hr, and the deposited C4b was detected following standard protocols. The functional activity of LP and AP was assessed by ELISA as previously described (43) . Nunc Maxisorb plates were coated with 10 \u03bcg mannan per well in 100 mM Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 (pH 9.6) at room temperature overnight. After each step, 30 plates were washed three times with PBST (300 \u03bcl/well). Residual binding sites were blocked by incubation with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 2% HSA for 2-3 hr at room temperature. Serum samples were diluted 1:80 in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.05% Tween-20, and 0.1% gelatin with or without 2 mM CaCl 2 and N protein. All samples and buffers were prepared on ice. The plates were then sequentially 35 incubated for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C and for 1.5 hr at 37\u00b0C followed by washing. All incubation volumes were 100 \u03bcl. Complement binding was detected using antibodies followed by washing. Detection of C4, activated C3, and C5b-9 was performed using anti-C4\u03b1 chain antibody (Santa Cruz), antiactivated C3 antibody (Santa Cruz), and anti-C5b-9 antibody (Calbiochem), respectively. Antibody binding was detected using HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody or donkey 40 anti-rabbit antibody (R&D). Enzyme activity of HRP was detected using TMB incubation for 30-60 min RT, and the reaction was stopped with 2 M H 2 SO 4 . The OD was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader.\n\nAll rights reserved.

As mentioned above, Nunc Maxisorb plates were coated with 10 \u03bcg mannan per well in 100 mM Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 (pH 9.6) at room temperature overnight and blocked with 2% HSA. MBL protein (1 \u03bcg/ml) was incubated in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl 2 , 100 \u03bcg/ml HSA, and 0.5\u2030 TritonX-5 100 at 4\u00b0C for 2 hr. Purified MASP-2 and N (or control) proteins were added to the wells at different times to obtain final concentrations of 0.2 mg/ml and 200 ng/ml, respectively. The plates were washed after 32 hr of incubation at 4\u00b0C, and the binding of MASP-2 were detected with anti-MASP-2 antibody followed by HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibody. The enzyme activity of HRP was detected using TMB incubation for 30-60 min at RT, and the reaction was 10 stopped with 2 M H 2 SO 4 . The OD was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader.\n\nMouse cells isolated from peritoneal cavity were washed and inoculated with RPMI 1640 Media (10% FBS) in 96-well plates for 2 hr at 37\u2103. Serum was diluted by 0.781%, 1.562%, 3.125%, 6.25%, 12.5%, 25%, 50% and 100% with 1\u00d7PBS, 1mM CaCl 2 , and 2mM MgCl 2 . 15 Diluted serum, SARS-CoV N protein (100ng/ml) and E. coli (the ratio to cells was 10:1) were added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u2103. The eluate from pET22b-transformed E. coli was used as a negative control for purified N protein to exclude effects due to bacterial components that may active complement. The reaction was stop and cells were fixed with 10% neutral formalin. Complement C3c depositon was detected with FITC-C3c antibody, and the Immunohistochemistry 35 Postmortem autopsy from the 4 patients died in Huoshenshan hospital was carried out by Dr. Xiuwu Bian under the approval of the hospital ethic committee and the family member of the death. The detailed results will be published elsewhere. Paraformaldehyde-fixed lung tissues was used for paraffin tissue sections and immunohistochemical staining with MBL (Santa Cruz), MASP-2 (Santa Cruz), C4\u03b1 chain (Santa Cruz), C3 (Santa Cruz) or C5b-9 (Calbiochem) 40 antibodies as described in the instruction manual.\n\nAll rights reserved.
