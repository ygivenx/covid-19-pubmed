{"title": "Biological importance of marine algae", "body": "Marine organisms are potentially prolific sources of highly bioactive secondary metabolites that might represent useful leads in the development of new pharmaceutical agents (Iwamoto et al., 1998; Iwamoto et al., 1999; Iwamoto et al., 2001) . During the last four decades, numerous novel compounds have been isolated from marine organisms and many of these substances have been demonstrated to possess interesting biological activ-ities (Faulkner, 1984a (Faulkner, ,b, 1986 (Faulkner, , 1987 (Faulkner, , 1988 (Faulkner, , 1990 (Faulkner, , 1991 (Faulkner, , 1992 (Faulkner, , 1993 (Faulkner, , 1994 (Faulkner, , 1995 (Faulkner, , 1996 (Faulkner, , 1997 (Faulkner, , 1998 (Faulkner, , 1999 (Faulkner, , 2000 (Faulkner, , 2001 (Faulkner, , 2002 .\n\nAlgae are very simple chlorophyll-containing organisms (Bold and Wynne, 1985) composed of one cell or grouped together in colonies or as organisms with many cells, sometimes collaborating together as simple tissues. They vary greatly in size -unicellular of 3-10 lm (microns) to giant kelps up to 70 m long and growing at up to 50 cm per day (Hillison, 1977) . Algae are found everywhere on earth: in the sea, rivers and lakes, on soil and walls, in animal and plants (as symbionts-partners collaborating together); in fact just about everywhere where there is a light to carry out photosynthesis.\n\nAlgae are heterogeneous group of plants with a long fossil history. Two major types of algae can be identified: the macroalgae (seaweeds) occupy the littoral zone, which included green algae, brown algae and red algae, and the micro algae are found in both bentheic and littoral habitats and also throughout the ocean waters as phytoplankton (Garson, 1989) . Phytoplankton comprises organisms such as diatoms (bacillariophyta), dinoflagellates (dinophyta), green and yellow-brown flagellates (chlorophyta; prasino-phyta; prymnesiophyta, cryptophyta, chrysophyta and rhaphidiophyta) and blue-green algae (cyano-phyta). As photosynthetic organisms, this group plays a key role in the productivity of oceans and constitutes the basis of the marine food chain (Bold et al., 1985; Hillison, 1977) .\n\nRecently, microalgae metabolites are attracting to enormous attention, and the topics have been discussed by a number of authors (Shimizu, 1996) .\n\nThe microalgal phyla have been recognized to provide chemical and pharmacological novelty and diversity, moreover microalgae are considered as the actual producers of some highly bioactive compounds found in marine resources (Shimizu, 1996) .\n\nThe true origins of compounds found in marine invertebrates have been a subject of discussion. They may vary from compound to another, but there are strong hints that dietary or symbiotic algae are one of the participants in the production of these metabolites. For example, as early as 1977, the bluegreen algae, Lyngbya majusula was recognized as the source of aplysiatoxin found in the sea hares Aplysia that feed on this alga (Mynderse et al., 1997) . Similarly, a series of highly active antitumor compounds, dollastatins 1 and 2, isolated from sea slugs are considered to be of blue-green algal origin (Shimizu, 2000) . Also, eukaryotic algae and various dinoflagellate metabolites are found in shellfish and other invertebrates as toxins (Shimizu, 2000) . Brevetoxins 3, ciguatoxins and dinophysistoxins are we-ll known examples of paralytic shellfish toxins (Hall and Strichartz, 1990 ).\n\nThe blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) show many structural features in common with bacteria (Garson, 1989) . However, they are classified with algae because they contain chlorophyll a and related compounds. All prokaryotes convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia which may explain why nitrogenous compounds occur frequently in blue-green algae. The cyanobacteria possess an interesting secondary metabolism producing many nitrogenous compounds and cyclic polyethers that have potent biological activities (Moore and Entzeroth, 1988) .\n\nMorphologically, blue green algae appear in different shapes like filamentous, conical, unicellular, etc. Blue-green algae have very rich chemistry (Patters et al., 1994; Moore, 1996) . The chemical diversity and novelty seen in blue-greens are comparable to those of Actino-mycetes which gave many important drugs. A single species of blue-greens produce many different chemotypes (Lyngbya majuscula is a good example). The variation in structures of the biologically isolated compounds from this filamentous algae is just incredible and most of them possess characteristic biological activity (Patters et al., 1994; Moore, 1996) .\n\n1.1.1.1. Anticancer and cytotoxic activities. Curacin A 4 isolated from the Curaso strain marine Cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula by Gerwick's group in 1994 . It is an important lead compound for a new type of anticancer drugs. It is an antimitotic agent (IC 50 values in three cell line ranging from 7 to 200 nm) that inhibits microtubule assembly and binding of cholchicine to tubulin . Two linear cytotoxic pentapeptides; majusculamide D 5 and deoxymajusuculamide D 6 were isolated from a deepwater variety of the marine blue-green alga Lyngby majuscula by and Entzeroth in 1988.\n\nA highly interesting bioactive compounds have been isolated from blue-green algae including alkaloids (e.g. lyngbyatoxin) 7, polyketides (e.g. tolytoxin), cyclic peptide (e.g. microcystin), depsipeptide (e.g. majusculamide 8) etc. Many of these compounds showed a versatile biological activity (Shimizu, 2000) . Cryptophycin-l 9 from Nostoc species shows a fungicidal activity and rediscovered by Smith's group (Smith et al., 1994) as a microtubule depolymerizing agent. The compound and its analogues are very effective against solid tumors.\n\nLyngbyatoxin-A 7 identified in the blue green alga Lyngbya majuscula, the most thoroughly investigated from the biological point of view is responsible for a severe erythematous papulovesicular dermatitis (swimmer's itch) Cardelina et al., 1979 Lyngbyatoxin and shows cytotoxicity against P388 leukemia, but also act as a co-carcinogen. It has been suggested that this substance may play a role in human stomach cancer among the Hawaiians who consume large quantities of edible seaweed on which Lyngbya majuscula grows epiphytically (Moore, 1982) .\n\n1.1.1.2. Tumor-promoting activity. Dihydroteleocidin B 10, which is a derivative of teleocidin B 11 from Streptomyces, showed potent tumor-promoting activity in vivo when painted on mouse skin. Although the chemical structure of 10 is entirely different from the phorbol esters, the tumor-promoting activity of 10 was comparable to that of 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13acetate (TPA) in vivo. Compounds 11, from Streptomyces, lyngbyatoxin A 12 and debromoaplysaxitoxin 13 isolated from the marine blue-green alga Lyngbya majuscula induced ornithine decarboxylase activity when painted on mouse skin, their effects being similar to those of 10 and TPA. 13-cis-Retinoic acid inhibited this ornithine decarboxylase induction when painted on the skin one hour before these natural products. Compounds 10, 11 and 13 produced adhesion of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) to the flasks and inhibited differentiation of Friend erthroleukemia cells induced by DMSO. The in vitro biological potencies of 11 and 12 were al-most as great as those of 10 and TPA, but that of debromoaplysiatoxin was much weaker (Fujiki et al., 1981) .\n\n1.1.1.3. Antibacterial activity. The c-lactone malyngolide 14, an antibiotic effective against Mycobacterium smegmatis and Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from the dichloromethane extract of a shallow-water variety of the blue-green alga Lyngbya majuscula (Cardllina et al., 1979) .\n\nThe major antimicrobial constituents of Puerto Rican specimens of the blue green Lyngbya majuscula are the elemental sulphur and (\u00c0)-(4E,7S)-7 methoxytetradec-4-enoic acid 15 (Faulkner, 1987) .\n\n1.1.1.4. Antifungal activity. Majuscuiamide C 16 is a cyclic depsipeptide from the deep-water variety of Lyngby majuscula that inhibit the fungal plant pathogens (Carter et al.,1984) .\n\n1.1.1.5. Immunosuppressive activity. The potent immunosuppressive lipoproteins, microcolins A 17 and B 18 have been isolated from a Venezuelan sample of the blue green algae Lyngbya majuscula by Koehn et al. (1992) . The microcolins are potent inhibitor of the murine mixed lymphocyte response and murine P388 leukemia in vitro (Koehn et al., 1992) .\n\nDinoflagellates are unicellular organisms that are best classified as primitive algae (Garson, 1989) . Massive concentrations of these organisms appear on the surface of the ocean, causing high mortality of the fish by asphyxia. Also large concentration of this algae in the sea give the water a brown to red coloration because of their pigmentation (Trease and Evanes, 1996) . Certain dinoflagellate species produce toxin which when consumed by filter feeders, such as shellfish, are concentrated in the flesh of the animals. Consumption of contaminated shellfish by man can result in severe health problems including death. The toxins are usually classified into paralytic shellfish poisons or diarrhetic shellfish poisons. Despite of the toxicity of some species of dinoflagelates, some other species produced unique compounds not separated from other phyla most of them showed a very potent biological activity. Dinoflagelates lies taxonomically between prokaryotics and eukaryotics and sometimes called mesokaryotes (Dodge, 1965) . This unique situation makes the organism very interesting to secondary metabolite production (Dodge, 1965) .\n\nThe structural types of dinoflagellate metabolites spread widely from heterocyclic compounds, polycyclic ethers, oxygenated polyketides and macrolides (Shimizu, 1993; Yasumoto and Maurata, 1993) . Many dinoflagellate metabolites show very potent biological activity such as saxitoxin 19, neosaxitoxin and gonyautoxins produced by Alexandrium and several other genera of dinoflagellates are highly selective sodium channel blockers (Hall and Strichartz, 1990 ). On the other hand, breve-toxins 3 produced by Gymnodinium breve are potent sodium channel activators. Another polycyclic ether, maitotoxin from Gambierdiscus toxicus, is a rare calcium channel activators (Yasumoto and Maurata, 1993) .\n\nA number of compounds are known to act on the signal transduction system in the cell. Okadaic acid 20 and its derivatives found in Prorocentrum species and Dinophysis species are very potent inhibitors of serine/threoninespecific protein phosphatase and 2A (Fujiki and Suganuma, 1993) . Kobayashi and Ishibashi (1993) reported that a symbiotic Amphidinium species from a flatworm contain a series of macrolides, amphidinolides most of them are very cytotoxic. They were also screened Amphidinium species From Caribbeans for antitumor agents, also isolated a series of compounds including amphidinolide B 21 reported by kobayashi's group (Kobayashi and Ishibashi, 1993) . The structure of amphidinolide B isomers as strongly cytotoxic macrolides produced by a free-swimming dinoflagellate, Amphidinum sp. was reported by Bauer group (Bauer et al., 1994) . One of the compound carbenolide I 22 was extremely cytotoxic and active in vivo (Bauer et al., 1995) .\n\nMany of dinoflagellate metabolites have strong antifungal activity. Goniodomin A 23 from Goniodoma (Alexandrium) sp. is a strong antifungal agent isolated by Murakami et al. (1988) .\n\nA potent antifungal agent (gambieric acid 24) discovered by Yasumoto's group Yasumoto and Maurata (1993) in the culture medium of Gambierdiscus toxicus.\n\nThe above data proved that the probability of finding bioactive compounds from dinoflagellates is very high.\n\nBacillariophyceae is a versatile and abundant family, which is probably the most important in the primary production in the oceans. Diatoms are fast growing and more easy to culture on a large scale. Unlike dinoflagellates, very few secondary metabolites have been reported from the diatoms (Shimizu, 2000) .\n\nDomic acid 25 has been isolated from Pseudonitzschia multiseries and other species; it is a harmful glutamate agonist which causes amnesic shellfish poising (Wright et al., 1989) . It also produced a new type of cyclic eicosanoid bacillariolides 26, 27 (Wang and Shimizu, 1990; Wang et al., 1993) . Bacillariolide I 26 has on inhibitory activity against phospholipase A2 (Shimizu, 1996) .\n\nMarine macroalgae or seaweeds have been used as foods especially in China and Japan and crude drugs for treatment of many diseases such as iodine deficiency (goiter, Basedow's disease and hyperthyroidism). Some seaweeds have also been used as a source of additional vitamins, treatment of various intestinal disorders, as vermifuges, and as hypocholesterolaemic and hypoglycemic agents. Seaweeds have been employed as dressings, ointments and in gynecology (Trease and Evanes, 1996) .\n\nMacroalgae can be classified into three classes; green algae (Chlorophyta), Brown algae (Phaeophyta) and red algae (Rhodophyta) (Garson, 1989) .\n\nThe characteristic green colour of green algae is mainly due to the presence of chlorophyl a and b in the same proportion like higher plants (Bold et al., 1985) . There are few reports of novel secondary metabolites among the chlorophyta than the other algal division; the following are the most important natural products isolated from these algae and their biological activities.\n\n1.2.1.1. Antiinflammatory substances. An anti-inflammatory, 3-0-b-D-glucopyranosy-lstigmasta-5,25-diene 28 have been isolated by Awad in (2000) from the green alga Ulva laetuea.\n\nHabu is a deadly snake inhabit in Okinawa where 200-300 people are bitten by the snake every year. A patient must be given immediate medical treatment with the serum prepared from a horse-developed antibody by injection of snake toxin. However, about 20% of the patients are allergic to the serum.\n\nIn order to develop an alternative drug, Okinawa Prefectural Institute of Public Health has been conducting screening to find out a compound with antiinflammatory activity that can be measured by suppression of the inflammation caused by the injection of the toxin on a mouse limb. A diphenyl ether 29 isolated from an alga was found to be effective in this assay (Higa, 1989) . The extract of the green alga Cladophora fascicularis was separated by different chromatographic methods to furnish 2-(2 0 ,4 0 -dibromophenoxy)-4,6-dibromoanisol (Kuniyoshi et al., 1985) , the first example of diphenyl ether from green algae. It was also active in inhibiting the growth of Escherichiacoli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus (Kuniyoshi et al., 1985) .\n\n1.2.1.2. Cytotoxic and immunosuppressive activities. Bioassyguided fractionation utilizing the inhibitory activity against inosine-5 0 -monophos-phate dehydrogenase inhibitor (IMPDH) leads to isolation of new brominated diphenylmethane derivative. Isorawsonol 30 has been isolated from the tropical green alga Arrainvilla rawsonii by Chen et al. (1994) . The activity of IMPDH has been linked with cellular proliferation and inhibition of that enzyme has been demonstrated to have anticancer and immunosuppressive effects .\n\nBioactivity-directed fractionation of the extract of the green alga Tydemania expeditionis using the protein tyrosine kinase pp60 v-stc leads to the isolation of three new cycloartenol disulfates 31-33; they showed modest inhibition of this enzyme (Govindan et al., 1994) .\n\nCommunesins A 34 and B 35, exhibiting cytotoxic activity against the cultured P-388 lymphocytic leukemia cells, were isolated from the mycelium of a strain of Penicillium species stuck on the marine alga Enteromorpha intestinals (Numata et al., 1993) .\n\nPenostatins A 36, B 37, C 38, D 39 and E 40 (Iwamoto et al., 1999) have been isolated from a strain of Penicillium species originally separated from the marine alga Enteromorpha intestinalis (Linne) Link (Ulvaceae). The compounds A-C and E exhibited a significant cytotoxicity against cultured P388 cell line (Iwamoto et al., 1999; Takahashi et al., 1996) Penostatins F,G,H 41-43 and I 44 were isolated from a strain of Penicillum originally separated from the marine alga Enteromorpha intestinalis (Linne) Link (Ulvaceae). All the compounds exhibit significant cytotoxicity against cultured P388 cells (Iwamoto et al., 1998) .\n\nThe novel compounds cytochalasans, penochalasins A B,C 45-47 , D-H 48-52 and chaetoglobosin O 53 (Iwamoto et al., 2001) were isolated from a strain of Penicillium species originally separated from the marine alga Enteromorpha intestinalis. All these compounds exhibited potent cytotoxic activity against cultured P388 cells.\n\nHalimedatrial 54 is a diterepene trialdhyde was separated from Halmida lamouroux (chlorophyta, Udoteaceae) species. This compound was found to be toxic towards reef fishes, significantly reduces feeding in herbivorous fishes and has cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities (Paul and Fenical, 1983) .\n\nFour new diterpenoid metabolites were isolated from several species of the green algae Halimeda (Udoteaceae). These new compounds show potent antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties in bioassays. Among these 4 compounds were halimediatrial 54 and halimedalactone 55 (Paul and Fenical, 1984) .\n\nThe cyclic depsipeptide Kahalalide F 56 was originally isolated from both mollusc Elysia rufescenes and from the dietary source, the green alga Bryopsis sp. (Hamann and Scheuer, 1993) was introduced into Phase I trials by Pharma Mar as a lead compound against prostate cancer.\n\nGreen alga Bryopsis sp. was the source of the cyclic depsipeptides Kahalalides P 57 and Kahalalides Q 58 with moderate inhibition of the HL-60 cell lines (Dmitrenok et al., 2006) . Biological importance of marine algae 1.2.1.3. Antibacterial activity. Cycloeudesmol 59 is an antibiotic cycloproane containing sesquiterpene; it was isolated from the marine alga Chondria oppositiclada Dawson (Fenical and Sims, 1974) . Cycloeudesmol was found to be potent antibiotic against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans.\n\nLyengaroside A 60 was isolated from the green alga Codium iyengarii and displayed a moderate antibacterial activity (Ali et al., 2002) .\n\nGeen algae extract of Caulerpa prolifera exhibited moderate to significant activity against unidentified strains of marine bacteria (Smyrniotopoulos, 2003) .\n\n1.2.1.4. Antiplasmodial activity. From the green alga Ulva species, the endophytic and obligate marine fungus Ascochyta salicorniae was isolated. Ascochyta salicorniae was found to produce the unprecedented and structurally unusual tetramiric acid contiguous metabolites ascosalipyrrolidinones A 61 and B 62. Ascosalipyrrolidinones A 61 has antiplasmodial activity toward Plasmodium falciarum strains Kl and NF 54, as well as showing antimicrobial activity and inhibiting tyrosine kinase p561ck (Osterhage et al., 2000) .\n\n1.2.1.5. Antiviral activity. Halitunal 63, is a novel diterpene aldehyde possessing a unique cyclopentadieno [c] pyran ring system; it has been isolated from the marine alga Halimeda tuna. Halitunal shows antiviral against murine coronavirus A59 in vitro (Koehn et al., 1991) .\n\nIn 1992 Garg et al. (1992) isolated the antiviral derivative, sphingosin, N-palmitoyl-2-amino 1,3,4,5-tetyrahydroxyoctadecane 64 which demonstrated antiviral activity in vivo protection against Semeliki forest virus (SFV). This compound was isolated from Indian green alga Ulva fasciata.\n\n1.2.1.6. Antimutagenic activity. Two new compounds, cymobarbatol 65 and 4-isocymobarbatol 66 were isolated from the marine green alga Cymopolia barbat. Both compounds were found to be nontoxic over a broad concentration range against Salmonella tybimurium strains T-98 and T-lOO. Both compounds exhibited strong inhibition of the mutagenicity of 2-aminoanthracene and ethylmethanesulphonate towards the T-98 strains plus a metabolic activator and T-100 (Wall et al., 1989) .\n\n1.2.1.7. Anti fungal activity. Capisterones A 67 and B 68 are triterpene sulphate esters isolated from green alga Panicillus capitatus. Both compounds exhibited potent antifungal activity against the marine algal pathogen Lindra thallasiae (Puglisi et al., 2004) .\n\nTwo sesquiterpenes, caulerpals A 69 and B 70 were isolated from green alga Caulerpa taxifolia in addition to the known caulerpin (Aguilar-Santos, 1970); they were shown to be potent inhibitor of human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (hPTP I B) Mao et al., 2006 . Capisterones A and B, originally isolated from Penicillus capitatus (Garg et al., 1992) , were re-isolated and absolute stereochemistry assigned using electronic CD. In addition, the capisterones have been shown to significantly enhance fluconazole activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae .\n\nA new class of ether-linked glycoglycerolipids, nigricanosides A 71 and B 72 were isolated as methyl esters from the green alga Avrainvillea nigrans. Nigricanoside A dimethyl ester was found to be a potent antimitotic agent, acting by stimulating the polymerisation of tubulin and inhibiting the proliferation of both MCF-7 and HCT-116 cells (Williams et al., 2007) .\n\n1.2.1.8. Protein tyrosine phosphate 1B inhibitors (PTP1B). Hydroxyisoavrainvilleol 73 was originally isolated from the tropical green alga Avrainvillea nigrican (Colon et al., 1987) but has now been isolated from red alga Polysiphonia urceolata as a protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitor (PTP1B) Liu et al., 2008. A vanillic acid biphenyl derivative 74 and the sulfate adduct 75 were isolated from the Australian green alga Cladophora socialis as a protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTPa1B) inhibitors Feng et al., 2007. 1.2.2. Phaeophyta (brown algae) The brown colour of these algae results from the dominace of the xanthophyll pigments and fucoxanthin; this masks the other pigments, chloro-phyll a and c, b-carotenes and other xanthophylls (Bold et al., 1985) . Food reserves of brown algae are typically complex polysaccharides and higher alcohols. The principal carbohydrate reserve is laminarin. The cell walls are made of cellulose and alginic acid. Many bioactive metabolites have been isolated from brown algae with different pharmacological activities as shown below.\n\n1.2.2.1. Cytotoxic and antitumor activity. A linear cytotoxic diterpene bifurcadiol 76 was isolated from the brown alga Bifurcaria bifurcata by Guardia et al. (1999) which exhibit cytotoxicity against cultured human tumor cell lines (A-549, SK-OV-3, SKL-2, XF 498 and HCT).\n\nMeroterpenoids, Sargol, Sargol-I and sargol-ll 77-79 were isolated from the brown alga sargassum tortile and showed a cytoxic activity (Numata et al., 1991) .\n\nLeptosins A, B, C (I, X = 4, 3, 2 80), D, E and F (II, X = 2, 3, 4 81), belonging to a series of epipolythiodioxopiperazine derivatives, have been isolated from the mycelium of a strain of Leptsphaeria species attached to marine alga Sargassum tortile. All these compounds showed potent cytotoxicity against cultured P388 cells except leptosins A and C exhibited significant antitumor activity against Sarcoma 180 ascites (Takahashi et al., 1994a) . Further investigation of the secondary metabolites of this fungus has led to the isolation of four additional cytotoxic compounds, named leptosins G, G1, G2 82-84 and H 85 (Takahashi et al., 1995a) . Leptosins K, K1 86-87 and K 2 88 were also isolated and showed a potent cytotoxic activity against P388 cell line (Takahashi et al., 1995b) .\n\nLeptosins I 89 and J 90 have been also isolated from the mycelium of a strain of Leptosphaeria species OUPS-4 attached to the marine alga Sargassum tortile. These compounds exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against cultured P388 cells (Takahashi et al., 1994b) .\n\nLeptosins M, MI, N and N1 91-94 that have been isolated from a strain of Leptsphaeria species were originally separated from the marine alga Sargassum tortile.

These oxygenated fucosterols exhibited cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines (Sheu et al., 1999) including P-388, KB, A-549 and HT-29 cell lines.\n\nFour arsenic-containing ribofuranosides 110-113 together with inorganic arsenic have been isolated from the brown alga Hizikia fusiforme which is eaten in Japan under the name hijiki (Edmonds et al., 1987) .\n\nStypolactone 114, a diterpenoid of mixed biogenesis has been isolated from the brown algae Stypopdium zonale and showed weak cytotoxic activity in vitro against the A-549 and H-116 cell lines (Dorta et al., 2002a) .\n\nFour hydroazulene diterpenes, dictyone acetate 115, dictyol F monoacetate 116, isodictytriol monoacetate 117 and cystoseirol monoacetate 118 were isolated from the brown alga Cystoseira myrica collected in the Gulf of Suez canal showed a moderate cytotoxicity against the murine cancer cell line KA3IT, but reduced cytotoxicity against normal NIH3T3 (Ayyad et al., 2003) .\n\nSterols B 119 isolated from Stypopdium carpophyllum exhibited cytotoxic activity against several cultured cancer cell lines (Tang et al., 2002a) .\n\nTwo cytotoxic trihydroxylated diterpenes based on 12hydroxygeranylgeraniol 120-121 were isolated from brown alga Bifurcaria bifurcate (Gulioli et al., 2004) .\n\nThe tropical brown alga Styolpopdium zonale collected from the coast of Tenerife was the source of terpenoid C 122; the methyl ester of C exhibited in vitro cytotoxic activity against HT-29, H-116 and A-549 (Dorta et al., 2002b) .\n\nThe brown alga Taonia atomaria was a source of meroditerpenes atomarianones A 123 and B 124, the cytotoxic agents against the NSCLC-N6 and A-549 cell lines .\n\n(+)-Yahazunol 125 (Ochi et al., 1979) and cyckozonarone 126 (Kurata et al., 1996) were showed cytotoxic activity against several human tumor cell lines, while zonarol 127, zonarone 128 and isozonarol 129 (Fenical et al., 1973) isolated from brown alga also displayed cytotoxicity against various human tumour cell lines (Laube et al., 2005) .\n\nBrown alga Perithalia capillaris yielded new bis-prenylated quinones 130, 131, both are inhibitors of superoxide production in human neutrophils in vitro and of proliferation of HL-60 cells (Blackman et al., 1979) .\n\nTwo diterpenes, 4,18-dihydroxydictyolactone 132 and 8a,11 dihydroxypachydictyol A 133, were isolated from a Dictyota sp. (Jongaramru, 2007) . In bioassays, 4,18-dihydroxydictyolactone was strongly cytotoxic (NCI-H187) (Jongaramru, 2007).\n\n1.2.2.2. Ichthyotoxins and feeding-deterrent substances from brown alga. Stypoldione 134 was isolated from the brown alga Stypodium zonale which showed an ichthyotoxins effect. When fresh S. zonala is placed in an aquarium, water soon turns to a rust colour and rendered extremely toxic to the reef-dwelling herbivorous dam selfish Eupomcentrus leucostictus. The fish immediately senses the toxins and attempts to jump out of the aquarium. This behavior is followed by erratic response to external stimuli, apparently difficulty in obtaining oxygen, loss of equilibrium, narcosis and eventually death. The toxic symptoms were then proved to be due to stypoldione isolated from S. zonale (Gerwick et al., 1979) . Stypoquinonic acid 135 was isolated from the lipophilic extract of the same alga (Wessels et al., 1999) and showed inhibition of tyrosine kinase p56 lck enzyme.

These results suggested that halogen at C 7 was not essential to the activity. In contrast, compound 211 was relatively weekly cytotoxic and the minimally differential activity showed no significant correlation to that of 204, indicating that a halogen at C 6 was essential for the characteristic activity of 204-207. halogen at C 2 was required for halomone like activity. Carbocyclic compounds like 208 and 215 were considerably less cytotoxic than 204-207. Compound 209 was more comparable to the overall (panel-averaged) potency to halomon. However, there was little differential response of the cell lines, and consequently no significant correlation to the profile of 204.\n\nThe polyhalogenated monoterpene content of six samples of the tropical marine red alga Plocamium hamatum, 216-226 collected from the southern, central and northern regions of The Great barrier Reef, Australia was assessed.

The antimicrobial activity of the red alga Laurencia brongniarti against Bacillus subtilis (a gram positive bacteria) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) has been traced to the four polybrominated indoles 338-341 (Carter et al., 1978) .\n\nFrom the air dried red alga Beckerella subcostatum, bromobeckerelide 342 epimer (the major fraction) and chlorobeckerelide 343 epimers (the minor fraction) were isolated. In lab tests, both compounds showed activity against Bacillus subtilis (Ohta, 1977) .\n\nFrom the MeOH extract of' Marginisporum aberrans, showing antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, P-hydroxybenzaldhyde, dichloro-acetamide, and 3,5-dinitriguaiacol were obtained. All these compounds showed activity against Bacillus subtilis (Ohta and Takagi, 1977) .\n\nElatol 344, a halogenated sesquiterepene alcohol from the red alga L. elata inhibited six species of human pathogenic bacteria with significant antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus epidermis, Klebsiella pneumonia and Salmonella sp. (Vairappan, 2003) . Iso-obtusol 345 from the red alga L. obtusa (Gonzalez et al., 1976 (Gonzalez et al., , 1979 exhibited antibacterial activity against four bacterial species with significant activity against K. pneumonia and Salmonella sp.\n\nHalogenated metabolites from the red alga Laurencia species were tested for antibacterial activity against 22 strains of human pathogenic bacteria, including seven strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Laurinterol 346 (Irie et al., 1966) , isolaurinterol 347 (Irie et al., 1970) , allo-laurinterol 348 (Kazlauskas et al., 1976) , cupalaurenol 349 (Ichiba and Higa, 1986) and 2,3,5,6-tetrbromoindol 350 (Carter et al., 1978) displayed a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococus pneumonia and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Laurinterol and allo-laurinterol were particularly effective (Vairappan et al., 2004) .\n\nThe red alga Laurencia mariannensis afforded a number of new metabolites: the brominated diterpene, 10-hydroxykahukuene B 351, two sesquiterpenes, 9-deoxyelatol 352 and isoda-ctyloxene A 353, one brominated C15-acetogenin, laurenmariallene 354, and two new naturally occurring halogenated sesquiterpenes 355 and 356 that were obtained previously as intermediates in a biomimetic synthetic study of rhodolaureol and rhodolauradiol (Gonzalez et al., 1982) . Both 10-hydroxykahukuene B 351 and laurenmariallene 354 had modest antibacterial activity.\n\nLanosol enol ether 357, originally isolated from the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus has been shown to be an antibacterial and antifungal component of the brown alga Osmundaria serrata (Barreto and Meyer, 2006) .\n\nEight novel diterpenebenzoic acids, callophycoic acids A-H 358-365, and two halogenated diterpene-phenols, callophycols A 366 and B 367, were isolated from red alga Callophycus serratus some of which displayed moderate antibacterial, antimalarial, antitumour and antifungal activity (Lane et al., 2007) .\n\nFive new C 15 eight-membered cyclic ethers (368, 370-373) (Kladi et al., 2008) with a characteristic terminal cis eneyne moiety in addition to the previously reported acetylenic chloro diol 369 (Blunt et al., 1981) were isolated from the red alga Laurencia glandulifera. All these metabolites were tested for their antistaphylococcal activity and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) of 369-372 were in the range of 8-256 lg/ml. 1.2.3.9. Lipooxygenase inhibitor. The eicosanoids are biologically active arachidonic acid derivatives frequently found in marine organisms. Ptilodene 374 (new fatty acid) is an eicosanoid from the red alga Ptilotafilicina sp. that showed inhibitory activity to human 5-lipooxygenase, dog kidney Na + /K + ATPase and the growth of several pathogenic gram positive and negative bacteria (Lopez and Gerwick, 1988) . Another eicosanoid derivatives which is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation is 12-(S)-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid 375 isolated from the red alga Murrayella periclados (Bernari and Gerwick, 1994) .\n\nThree biologically active eicosanoids, (12R, 13R)-dihydroxy-eicsa-5(Z),8(Z),10(E), 14(Z) tetraeonic acid 376, (12R,13R)-dihydroxy eicosa-5(Z),8(Z), 10(E),14(Z),17(Z)-pentaenoic acid 377 and (10R,11R)-dihydroxyoctadeca-6(Z), 8(E), 12(Z) trienoic acid 378 were isolated from the red alga Farlowia mollis (Solem et al., 1989) .\n\n1.2.3.10. Antifeedent activity. Two phenylpropanoic acid derivatives, tichocarpols A 379 and B 380 were isolated from the red alga Tichocarpus crinitus. These two compounds along with floridoside 381 (Roh et al., 1994) which is also isolated from the alga, exhibited antifeedant activity against the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius (Ishii et al., 2004) .\n\n1.2.3.11. Aldose reductase inhibitors activity. The new bromophenols 382-384 and two bromophenols known previously only as synthetic compounds (Diers et al., 2004; Nishizawa and Satoh, 1975; Lightowler and Ry1ance, 1964) isolated from the red alga Symphyocladia latiuseula have significant aldose reductase inhibitors .\n\n1.2.3.12. Antimalarial activity. Snyderol sesquiterpene 385 derivative isolated from the red alga Laurencia obtusa was active against D6 and W2 clones of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Topeu et al., 2003) .\n\n1.2.3.13. Anti-elastase activity against porcine pancreas elastase (PEE). 3,6-Diketo steroid 386 was isolated from the red alga Hypnea musciformis collected on the Atlantic Coast of Morocco exhibited anti-elastase activity against porcine pancreas elastase (PEE) (Gosavi et al., 1995) .\n\n1.2.3.14. Inhbition of isocitrate lyase enzyme. A number of bromophenols isolated from the red alga Odonthalia corymbifera exhibited potent inhibitory activity against isocitrate lyase, an important enzyme in the rice fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea.\n\nThe compounds 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphe-nylethylamine (Diers et al., 2004) 2,20,3,30-tetrabromo-4,40,5,50-tetrahydroxydiphenylmethane (Craigie and Gruenig, 1967) , 2,3-dibromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol (Hodgkin et al., 1966) , 2,3-dibromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl methyl ether (Katsui et al., 1967) , 2,20,3-tribromo-30,4,40,5-tetrahydroxy-60-hydroxymethyldiphenylmethane (Kurata and Amiya, 1977) and 3-bromo-4-(2,3-dibromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl)-5-methoxyme-thylpyrocatechol also protected rice plants from infection by Magnaporthe grisea .
