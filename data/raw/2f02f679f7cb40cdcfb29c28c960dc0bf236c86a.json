{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Can COVID-19 present unusual GI symptoms?", "body": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease that originated in Wuhan, China and is now spreading throughout the world. 1 Based on these findings, we hypothesized that COVID-19 has a spectra of symptoms, and unusual GI symptoms can be considered among them. Lai et al., 3 have reported that in adult patients, fever was the most common symptom (92.8%; n = 258), followed by cough (69.8%; n = 194), dyspnea (34.5%; n = 96), myalgia (27.7%; n = 77), headache (7.2%; n = 20), and diarrhea (6.1%; n = 17). 3 Our observations are based on patients referred to a single-center gastroenterology clinic, and only two cases were documented. Thus, it is important to address promptly whether the incidence of unusual GI symptoms occurs before the incidence of respiratory disorders in patients confirmed to have COVID-19 pneumonia. The answer to this question may offer better, more effective therapeutic management, before lung involvement, of the COVID-19 virus.\n\nIn conclusion, all physicians should be aware of some unusual GI symptoms, which could be initial symptoms in patients suspected of COVID-19.\n\nMoreover, it is necessary to take precautions to avoid spread of this highly contagious infection, especially to those who are in close contact with the patient.\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest."}
