{"title": "Paediatric gastroenteritis in the eastern Malaysian state of Sarawak: an epidemiological and clinical study", "body": "Diarrhoeal diseases constitute an important and complex health problem among children in Malaysia, causing high morbidity and mortality with consequent retardation in growth and development. However, although the importance of viruses, especially rotaviruses, in the aetiology of paediatric diarrhoeal diseases is now well established, little has been reported on the occurrence of such viruses in east Malaysia.\n\nThe field part of the study was undertaken by two medical students (R.A.B. and P.H.M.) on a twomonth elective project. They examined the role of viruses in, and the clinical features of, diarrhoea among children admitted to two hospitals in Sarawak during January and February 1986. The genome of the rotaviruses detected was examined at St Thomas's Hospital by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to determine the extent of rotavirus variation.\n\nThe main study group consisted of children under 5 years of age, admitted with a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis to Lau King Howe Hospital, Sibu, Sarawak? between 7 January and 22 February 1986. On admission the patients were examined and a stool sample collected. A questionnaire was completed on discharge. Of 78 such patients admitted during the period of study, 69 (89%) were enrolled. The period studied covered the transition from the wet to the dry seasons (late January).\n\nFaecal samples and clinical details were also collected from a small control population at Sibu (10 patients under 5 years of age admitted with a diagnosis other than acute gastroenteritis), and from 10 patients with acute gastroenteritis admitted to a small rural hospital in Kapit, about 115 km from Sibu.\n\nThese patients came from a predominantly rural environment with poor sanitation. Patients admitted to the Lau King Howe Hospital, Sibu, were from a comparable rural setting as well as from an urban environment with relatively good sanitation and housing, but with some overcrowding.\n\nDehvdration was assessed clinicallv in terms of skin turgor: the state of the mucous -membranes and fon&nelles, and the intra-ocular pressure (INSLEY & WOOD. 1982) . The tonicitv of dehvdration was determined by the sodium ion' concentration: if it was less than 134 mm01 per litre-' the dehydration was considered to be hypotonic; if greater than 147 mm01 per litre-' then hypertonic dehydration was diagnosed.\n\nAll faecal samples were examined in Sibu by enxvme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for rot&us antigen using the Dakopatts Rotavirus ELISA Kit (Dako. Conenhaeen. Denmark). An aliquot of each sample *was fioxen at -2O\"G and transported to St Thomas's Hospital, London, for examination, after negative staining, by electron microscopy (EM) and PAGE (GRILLNER~~ al., 1985) . Electropherotypes were designated 1 and 2, representing-the 'short ' and 'long' electropherotypes-reswctivelv (ROGER et at., 1981) . Different electrooherdtypes within each of these subgroups were labelled alphabetically.\n\nOf 69 patients admitted to Lau King Howe Hospital, rotavirus was detected by EM, ELISA, or PAGE in 35 (51%). Adenovirus was detected m 2 patients and coronavirus-like particles in one (Table  1) . Patients with rotavirus-positive diarrhoea were significantly older than those in whom rotavirus could not be detected (P<O*OOl), the major age group affected being from 6 to 24 months of age ( Table 2) . Three of 10 (30%) controls in Sibu were excreting rotaviruses, as were 3 of 10 patients at Kapit. One patient at Kapit was also excreting astroviruses. Throughout the period studied no patients died of gastroenteritis.\n\nThere were no significant differences between rotavirus and non-rotavirus associated diarrhoea in terms of clinical features, other than the observation that patients excreting rotaviruses were more likely to oresent earlier. most within 4 d (Pt0.05) ( Table 31. Comparison' of ELISA, EM, 'and PA& for the detection of rotaviruses in faecal samples indicated that the 3 techniques were of similar sensitivity. Rotavirus ribonucleic acid was detected in 37 faecal samples by PAGE. Four different electropherotypes could be identified (Figure) . Two of these, designated 1B and ZB, were detected only once each. Of the others, 27 (72%) exhibited a 'short' electropherotype designated lA, and 7 (10%) a 'long' electropherotype, 2A. Two of these samples contained a mixture of 1A and 2A ( demonstrated significantly more hypotonic dehydra- tion and need for intravenous therapy than those in whom the long electropherotype 2A was detected (Table 4 ). Those in whom the long electropherotype was detected tended to be more lethargic (Table 5) .\n\nThis study demonstrated that rotaviruses were associated with over 50% of cases of acute diarrhoea among children in the central region of Sarawak. However, the detection of rotaviruses in 3 of 10 children not suffering from diarrhoea implied that this association was not unequivocal. High levels of asymptomatic rotavirus infection among children have been reported previously (CHAMPSAUR et al., 1984) and asymptomatic infection is known to occur among the newborn, and in older children experiencing reinfection. That the major age group affected was 6 to 24 months of age is in agreement with other studies (e.g., KAPIKIAN et al., 1976; MIDDLETON et al., 1977) . The initial assays for rotavirus used the Dakopatts ELISA kit and were performed in Sarawak on freshly collected samples. This test, the reagents of which were carried in hand luggage from London, provided the local clinicians with a cheap, simple test, the accuracy of which was confirmed by subsequent analysis by EM and PAGE. Although the local clinicians welcomed the provision of a rotavirus diagnostic service the results did not affect patient management, in that patients with rotavirus-induced diarrhoea as well as other forms responded equally favourably to oral rehydration if treatment was given early. Thus the service was not continued after completion of the study.\n\nMany studies have shown that, in contrast to diarrhoea caused by other micro-organisms, rotavirus-induced diarrhoea is characterized by mcreased vomiting, dehydration, and diarrhoea (e:g., RODRI-GUEZ et al., 1977; HIEBER et al., 1978) . Some investigators have also noted an increase in upper respiratory tract symptoms (HIEBER et al., 1978; LEWIS et al.. 1979) . However, in this study no difference co&d be &en between rotavirus-assoc<ated and non-rotavirus-associated diarrhoeas other than the observation that rotavirus-associated cases presented sooner after onset than others, presumably reflecting the abrupt onset of the illness or the relatively short duration of virus excretion. Respiratory symptoms were almost totally absent.\n\nOnly 4 rotavirus electropherotypes were detected, and of these 2, designated 1B and 2B, were found only once each. Of the 32 rotavirus positive samples from patients at Sibu which were also PAGE positive, 24 (75%) showed the same short electroph&otype .lA, and 7 (22%) the same lone electrooherotvoe 2A. One sampl; coitained both ;lectropheroty&s. Of the rotavirus positive samples from the control group at Sibu and the oatients at Kanit. 3 contained variant lA, 2 had variant 2A, and on'e hid a mixture of both. Simultaneous infection with more than one rotavirus electropherotype has been reported previously (LOURENCO et al.. 1981; SVENSSON et al.. 1986) . and it has been p&posed-that such inf&ions\"mav generate reass&t&ent viruses (FLORES et al., 1985 j. As all bands in 1B co-ran with bands in either 1A or 2A (Figure, A) , it seems likely that electropherotype 1B was a reassortment of 1A and 2A, although confirmation of this hypothesis would require the use of techniques such as oligonucleotide mapping. Electropherotype 2B cannot have been generated from a mixed 1 A and 2A infection; whether the patient involved was of local origin could not be established.\n\nStudies on the extent of electropherotypic variation of rotaviruses in large populations often demonstrate --. that many variants-co-exrst (CROXON & BELLAMY, 1979: RODGER et al.. 19811 . Studies in small oooulations, in which single var&nts are observed, iuggest that there is a minimum population size which can maintain the virus as an endenuc pathogen (ALBERT et al., 1983) . Such may be the case in the copulation stu-died here, as ody two electropheroiyies predominated. The same electropherotypes (1A and 2A) predominated in locations about 115 km apart, whereas in a similar 15 month study in Kenya only one of 34 electropherotypes detected in locations 480 km apart was found in both areas (CHIBA et al., 1984) . Population movement between Sibu and Kapit is quite extensive, and the similarity of electropherotypes probably resulted from the spread of virus to a population too small to maintain endemic rotavirus infection. Although CHIBA et al. (1984) reported frequent exchange of people between Nairobi and Mombasa, both areas are densely populated and rotavirus infection is endemic all year round.\n\nSubgroup 1 rotaviruses exhibit a slower running segment 10 and 11 duplet, a short pattern, whereas subgroup 2 rotaviruses show a longer pattern (ROD-GER et al., 1981; DYALL-SMITH & HOLMES, 1981) .\n\nAlthough one study has recently reported a subgroup 1 rotavirus with a long electropherotype (NAKAGOMI et al., 1985) , we have assumed that the electropherotypic analysis can be used to give a presumptive diagnosis of subgroup specificity, and have analysed the-clinical feat&es -of 'the two -groups. The one similar studv had shown no differences in severity of fever, vomifing or diarrhoea between the two subgroups, although the syndrome was thought to be of longer duration with subgroup 2 rotaviruses, which the authors suggested might indicate that subgroup 2 rotaviruses were more virulent (WHITE et al., 1984) . In most studies of diarrhoea subgroup 2 roiavirusks predominate, again suggesting thit &ese viruses are more virulent (YOLKEN et al., 1978; WHITE et ul., 1984) , although rotavirus subgroup i outbreaks have also been reported (ALBERT et al., 1983) . In this study we observed that diarrhoeal illness associated with the short electropherotype lA, the predominant variant, and presumed subgroup 1, involved more hypotonic dehydration and necessity for intravenous therapy than that associated with the long electropherotype 2A, presumed subgroup 2. Lethargy was significantly more common with the long electropherotype 2A. Analysis of all relevant investigations suggests, therefore, that subgroup specificity and severity of disease are unlikely to be linked. A recent report linking rotavirus virulence in newborn mice with gene segment 4 (OFFIT et al., 1986) seems to con&m this-contusion.\n\nWorldwide efforts are currentlv beine made to reduce the levels and severity of hiarrho'eal disease among children. Surveys such as this will not only provide data on which future vaccination programmes can be designed but will also be of value in assessing the success of such interventions."}
