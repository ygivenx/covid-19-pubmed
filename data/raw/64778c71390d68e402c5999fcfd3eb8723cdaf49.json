To eliminate contaminating cellular RNA and DNA from the samples, culture supernatant was treated with DNase I and RNase A as described previously (2), following RNA extraction by using a Total RNA isolation mini kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Page 2 of 4 4. Direct sequencing. After electrophoresis of PCR products on agarose gels, bands >120 bp were excised, and DNA was extracted from the gel by using MonoFas.\n\nDirect sequencing was performed by using the forward or reverse primer."}
