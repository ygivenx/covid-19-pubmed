( FCoV is primarily a pathogen of the gastrointestinal tract of domestic cats, replicating in the intestines and is spread by faecal-oral transmission from cats that are either persistently or transiently infected (Addie et al, 2001 ; Addie et al, 2003) . FCoV infections are often subclinical, but may result in a number of problematic conditions such as acute and chronic diarrhoea, stunting of kittens or transient upper respiratory signs in newly infected kittens and cats, and faecal incontinence in persistently infected carrier cats (Addie and Jarrett, 1992; Kipar et al., 1998) . FCoV RNA was found in five of 14 cats with chronic caecocolic disease , although it was unclear if FCoV was the cause of the lesions (Hahn et al, 2017) . Some cats that acquire the infection, typically 7-14% (Addie et al., 1995) develop feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), until recently considered to be an almost uniformly fatal disease. However, in a major advance, Pedersen et al. (2019) found recently that FIP can be cured by the parenteral administration of GS-441524, a novel antiviral nucleoside analogue. While this drug has yet to be licensed for veterinary use, several products, some specifically described as GS-441524, and others with proprietary names, are being sold through the internet to cat guardians who treat their own cats suffering from FIP.\n\nFCoV persists in multicat households by infection and re-infection of healthy cats by the same, or another, strain of virus and by the development of a persistently infected carrier status in 13% of FCoV-infected cats which act as reservoirs of infection in a feline population without developing FIP (Addie et al, 1995; Addie et al, 2001; Addie et al, 2003; Herrewegh et al., 1997) . There is an urgent need of methods to prevent cats in high density environments such as breeding and rescue catteries becoming infected with FCoV. An FIP vaccine is licensed in some countries, but the first dose is administered at 16 weeks (Gerber et al., 1990) which is too late to protect kittens, that are usually infected when maternally derived antibody wanes at between 5-7 weeks of age (Addie and Jarrett, 1992 ; Pedersen et al, 1981) . At present, therefore, the major way to prevent FIP is to prevent exposure to the virus by quarantine and rigorous hygiene. FCoV transmission is faecal-oral; sharing litter trays with a FCoV shedder and fomite transmission are the major risk factors for uninfected cats. In dry indoor environments, FCoV can survive up to seven weeks in fomites (Scott 1988) .\n\nAnother method of control would be to stop the excretion of virus in the faeces of infected cats by antiviral therapy. Some cat guardians have considered whether the drugs shown to cure FIP might also stop asymptomatic FCoV-infected cats shedding virus, thereby preventing them acting as a source of infection and providing a means to establish households of cats that are free of the virus. Mutian\u00ae X (Nantong Mutian Biotechnology Co. Ltd. China) is one of those products, it is formulated in capsules containing nicotinamide mononucleotide, Crocin I, S-Adenosylmethionine, Silymarin and Mutian X, which is a novel synthetic adenosine analogue (patent pending in China), exhibiting broadspectrum activity against RNA viruses (Tony Xue, CEO of Nantong, personal communication). Nucleoside analogues function by replacing adenosine, thus terminating replication of the RNA virus genome. Mutian X is efficacious by the oral route unlike previously described anti -coronavirus drugs, which must be given by painful injection, often causing severe inflammatory responses (Pedersen et al., 2019) , which is of concern for the development of feline injection site sarcoma.\n\nAlthough recombinant feline interferon omega (FeIFN\u03c9: Virbagen Omega, Virbac, France) was previously shown to reduce FCoV shedding, this is the first report to document an anti-viral that stopped the excretion of FCoV in the faeces of naturally infected cats.\n\nFCoV testing was implemented because the households had experienced FIP amongst their cats. A summary of the cats and the reasons for screening for FCoV shedding is shown in Table 1 .\n\nThirty-four of 50 cats in five multicat households (A-E) were naturally infected with FCoV and were treated with Mutian X. Results from five cats from Household E could not be included because the intervals between faecal tests left the possibility that the cats might have spontaneously stopped shedding virus, rather than Mutian X having stopped virus shedding: thus they were excluded from both treatment and control groups (Table 1) . Therefore, there remained data of 29 cats treated with Mutian X.\n\nHousehold C was a Ragdoll breeding cattery with a history of endemic FCoV for at least 4 years despite testing for FCoV antibodies and shedding, and rigorous hygiene. In 2015 this cattery experienced eight FIP deaths. Keeping cats in small groups or singly to attempt to prevent FCoV transmission resulted in clearance of virus in eight of 24 cats. Prior to the observational study we report here, the cattery owner (SC) discovered she could reduce coronavirus shedding in some cats using Mutian X tablets: we worked with her to optimise dose and duration of treatment for stopping virus shedding.\n\nFaecal samples were mailed to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (VDL) at the University of Glasgow, UK. The samples were mailed using Royal Mail or FedEx: they were not on ice, nor in RNApreserving buffer. Cat guardians were advised to try to submit faecal samples with no cat litter attached, since cat litter can inhibit the PCR reaction. performed in duplicate. Those performing the FCoV RT-qPCR tests were blinded to which treatments the cats were receiving. Threshold cycle (CT) number was used as the measure of viral load. The lower the CT, the more virus present in the sample. Samples with no signal at C T 40 were considered negative.\n\nCat guardians purchased Mutian X online. Mutian X was available in either tablet format, containing 4mg of the anti-viral Mutian X ingredient, or capsules (Mutian X 200) containing 10mg. The exact nature of Mutian X is a commercial secret, prior to Chinese patent being granted: the manufacturer describes it as an adenosine nucleoside analogue (Tony Xue, personal communication).\n\nCat guardians were using 4mg/kg q24 hours per os for seven days as per advice from social media groups for stopping FCoV shedding. The owner of Household C (SC) was experimenting with different doses and protocols with the aim of minimising dose and duration of treatment to stop faecal virus shedding: we report the outcome of using 2mg/kg and 4 mg/kg doses. The owners of Household E (FB and BC) set up a camera and alarm system which enabled the recording of the exact number of hours post onset of treatment that a faecal sample was passed, and to ensure the samples were not contaminated or degraded.\n\nPrior to the use of Mutian X, cat guardians were attempting to prevent FCoV transmission within their households by quarantining FIP cats (Households A and D), keeping cats in as small groups as possible given their facilities (Households C and E), and using Dr Elsey Cat Attract cat litter or other bentonite-based cat litter (Households A and E respectively). Some households also tried to reduce FCoV shedding using probiotics, recombinant FeIFN\u03c9, and a 21 day course of itraconazole (Households A and D) which has been shown to have in vitro activity against Type I FCoV (Takano et al., 2019). These various treatments were grouped into a single control period for each Household (Figs 1-3) , since numbers of cats for each of these parameters were too small to be statistically significant, and also because combinations of prevention strategies were used.\n\nThis was an observational study so that there was no opportunity to conduct a placebo-controlled trial. However, FCoV shedding records prior to treatment with Mutian X, where available, were used as a retrospective control period. Cats acted as their own controls, which meant that variables such as housing, breed, and age, which affect FCoV shedding, were constant.\n\nFisher's exact test (two-tailed) and correlation coefficient were carried out using the statistics package in Excel (Microsoft Office 2007).\n\nThe results are summarised in Table 2 . Prior to this study, the owner of Household C had attempted various Mutian X treatment regimes in her cats. A single dose treatment was attempted on two cats (C10 and C12) and while virus load reduced, it failed to clear infection and virus load increased again in Cat C10. Cat C1 was given a single injection of Mutian three days prior to oral treatment which had reduced her virus shedding from C T 20 to 32. Thus a single dose was ineffective at clearing infection and may have risked the emergence of resistant viruses.\n\nTen cats received a full course at 2mg/kg and two other cats began at 2mg/kg then were increased to 4mg/kg. Eight of ten cats stopped shedding FCoV using Mutian X tablets at a dose of 2mg/kg SID ( Fig. 2A) for seven or four days. Two probable FCoV carrier cats (C1 and C2) that had shed virus at levels of C T 18-20 (C1) and C T 35 (C2) for over a year prior to treatment; were treated for 7 days at a dose of 2mg/kg after which their faeces were negative, C1 and C2 remained negative when tested five and seven days later.\n\nThe remaining 8 cats were treated for four days as shown in Fig. 2A and Table 2 . Daily samples were available for five cats; two (C3 and C5) cleared the virus within 24 hours and three under 72 hours (C4, C6 and C7). The other cats were not tested daily, so an accurate time of cessation of virus shedding could not be determined.\n\nCats C8 and C10 failed to totally clear the virus using the 2mg/kg dose for 4 days; therefore they were treated again at 4mg/kg, after which they became negative, as shown in Fig. 2B and Table 2 . Cat C6 was in the same group as C8 and C10, and began shedding virus again within 9 days, requiring a second course of treatment (Figs. 2A and 2B).\n\nTwo more cats (E1 and E2) started treatment at 2mg/kg SID but were changed to the higher dose within 48 hours due to the results from Household C (Fig. 3 ): these cats were therefore included in the 4mg/kg rather than the 2mg/kg category.\n\nIn summary, a Mutian X dose of 2mg/kg was considered inadequate: it had cleared the virus in eight cats and reduced, but not abrogated, virus shedding in two cats ( Fig. 2A) . Thereafter, the dose was increased to 4mg/kg.\n\nA dose of 4mg/kg reliably cleared virus within seven days in 21 of 22 (95%) cats (two cats from Household A, one from Household B, 10 of 11 from Household C and 8 from Household E) (Figs.2B and 3). Cat C18 was the only cat who failed to clear the virus after a six day course of 4mg/kg dose, but she vomited some of the capsules and she required a repeat course for three more days after which she was negative.\n\nTen cats received a full course of Mutian X at 2mg/kg: eight cats (80%) cleared infection, but Cats C8 and C10 did not, and Cat C6 who was housed with them, began shedding virus again. Therefore at the end of that part of the study 7 cats were clear of virus, and three required to be re-treated at 4mg/kg. Twenty-two cats received a course of Mutian X at a dose of 4mg/kg and 21 cats (95%) became negative. Cat C18, who had vomited some of the capsules, required re -treatment, after which she too, became negative. Thus all 29 cats were cleared of infection, but four cats had required a second course of treatment.\n\nTo determine whether cats that were shedding a higher amount of virus required more days of antiviral treatment than cats with a lower virus quantity, starting FCoV RNA C T was plotted against days to become negative. Serial accurately timed daily faecal samples were available for 14 cats (Fig. 4 ) and all 14 cleared virus within 75 hours of starting treatment.\n\nNo correlation between starting FCoV RNA C T and time to become negative was found (R=0.0048.\n\nPre-treatment virus shedding records were used as a retrospective control in this observational study: FCoV virus shedding results prior to Mutian X administration were available for 25 treated cats (shown in Table 2 ). Two additional cats in Household C spontaneously stopped shedding virus prior to the start of treatment period (data not shown): one cat was kept in isolation and one was allowed outdoors. Therefore two of 27 (7.4%) cats stopped shedding virus during the control period: the difference between the number of cats stopping shedding virus during the control period and subsequent to Mutian X at 4mg/kg was statistically significant (p < 0.00001).\n\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Repeat negative samples were available from six cats dosed at 2mg/kg and 12 cats dosed at 4mg/kg ( Table 2) . Cats dosed at 2mg/kg and 4mg/kg remained negative for at least 3 to 18 days and 1 to 157 days respectively from their first negative result, showing that the cats remained negative posttreatment and did not start spontaneously shedding virus again. FCoV antibody titres were available for Cats A3 and A4 five months post-treatment: they had reduced from 1280 to 80 and from over 1280 to 320 respectively.\n\nMutian X pills stopped faecal FCoV shedding in 29 naturally infected cats; however, four of the 29 cats required a second course of treatment before virus was eliminated.\n\nSince successful treatment of FIP using anti-viral drugs was first reported (Pedersen et al., 2018; Pedersen et al., 2019) cat guardians have been able to source various anti-FCoV drugs, including Mutian X, via social media. Our view is that it is preferable that if they propose to use such medications, even though the products are unlicensed, they should do so under proper veterinary guidance, rather than following advice from social media group moderators, however knowledgeable. Professor Pedersen has provided a lucid view of the current situation in relation to the treatment of cats with FIP with 'black market' drugs, and the subsequent dilemma for veterinary surgeons. (https://ccah.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk4586/files/inlinefiles/Black%20market%20production%20and%20sale%20of%20GS_0.pdf).\n\nTo paraphrase Professor Niels Pedersen, we would prefer that these drugs be approved, licensed, and made available in the normal manner, rather than being sold on the black market, but we are willing to advise veterinary surgeons and their clients. Advice from those with FIP experience is likely to reduce unnecessary use of anti-coronavirus drugs: in two of the five households reported here FIP therapy levels of anti-viral treatment was begun in two cats which did not have FIP, and ceased when a proper diagnosis was obtained: anti-viral treatment has been stopped in nine other mis-diagnosed cats (DA personal observation). We present an observational study of cat guardians who were using Mutian X to stop their cats from shedding virus, and have defined a protocol which optimises and minimises its use. Furthermore, we hope that by stopping cats shedding FCoV, especially in purebred cats, the prevalence of FIP will reduce, which will further reduce the use of unlicensed drugs.\n\nA four day course of Mutian X at a dose of 2mg/kg cleared coronavirus in eight cats, but failed to clear infection in Cats C8 and C10. Some opinion leaders have expressed concern that use of Mutian X to stop virus shedding in cats without FIP will lead to drug resistance and failure of the drug to treat FIP, although the ability of Mutian X to treat FIP has not actually yet been documented, so far as we are aware. We ask those holding such views to consider the following: first that this drug is already being used for the purpose of virus elimination by cat guardians and surely it is better that a proper protocol has been developed, rather than that they are left to do trial and error themselves? Second, we have found that an intensive four day course stopped virus shedding while cats being treated for FIP have higher virus loads (Kipar et al, 2006) and require a longer course of treatment, up to 12 weeks (Pedersen et al, 2019) , which surely is more likely to allow resistant virus strains to develop? Indeed, virus resistance to a nucleoside analogue was documented in a cat being treated for FIP (Pedersen et al, 2019) . Anti-virals are used prophylactically in other viral infections: there is precedent for this approach.\n\nWe found no evidence for the development of drug resistance in asymptomatic cats at a dose of 4mg/kg. In our view treating breeding queens for four days to stop FCoV shedding is less likely to induce drug resistance than treating at least one in ten of their kittens for FIP, requiring 12 weeks of medication. However, treatment of virus shedding cats must be done properly: one concern is that cat guardians may be tempted to reduce cost and use an insufficient dose or duration of treatment (SC, personal observation), which might result in selection of viruses which are resistant to Mutian X.\n\nAnother concern is that a blunderbuss approach may be taken: treating all the cats in a household without first confirming that they are virus shedders.\n\nNo correlation was found between FCoV RNA C T prior to treatment and time to become negative, therefore cats shedding more virus did not require a longer treatment course than cats shedding a lower amount of virus and a 4 day course is likely to suffice, rather than 7 days.\n\nSince the study was observational rather than prospective, there was no formal placebo group. The lack of a placebo group in this study was problematic: it could be argued that the cats spontaneously stopped shedding FCoV, co-incidental with the onset of Mutian X therapy. . That said, it is unlikely that 29 cats would all cease virus shedding co-incidentally within days of beginning Mutian X treatment, we did retrospectively compare the results prior to Mutian X, when virus eradication was attempted by quarantine and hygiene, and / or itraconazole, and FeIFN\u03c9 with and without probiotics.\n\nAnother argument might be that the cats stopped shedding virus as a delayed result of the treatments given to some cats prior to Mutian X: this argument could not apply to Households B, C, and E, where the cats did not receive any other treatments. However, in Household A, virus load did decrease in two cats on probiotics (Fortiflora, Purina Pro Plan, USA) and FeIFN\u03c9, but remained at a constant level in the third cat. Therefore, a combination of interferon and probiotics may have reduced FCoV shedding. FeIFN\u03c9 has previously been shown to reduce, but not stop, FCoV shedding (Gil et al., 2013) . Probiotics are routinely used to treat children with viral diarrhoea (Szajewska et al., 2019) , but the interaction of the gut microbiome and FCoV has not been extensively explored (Meazzi et al., 2019) : further investigation into the possibility that probiotics might reduce coronavirus load is warranted.\n\nCats in Households A and D also received itraconazole which has been shown to have in-vitro activity against FCoV-I (Takano et al., 2019) . However, a 21 day course of treatment failed to clear these three cats of FCoV, although viral RNA quantity did decrease in Cat A3 while she was on itraconazole, but bounced back immediately it was stopped.\n\nAnother possibility was that the Mutian X could be excreted in the faeces and be inhibiting the FCoV RT-qPCR assay, but this was unlikely because, as shown in Figs 2. and 3., FCoV RNA was being detected in cats during Mutian X treatment, and also because faecal samples remained negative after the cats had ceased Mutian X.\n\nWhile a four-day course of Mutian X tablets at 4mg/kg appeared to be effective in stopping FCoV shedding, daily monitoring of faecal FCoV shedding using a laboratory which rapidly reports virus quantity is necessary to tailor treatment duration according to the circumstances of each individual cat. The virus is highly contagious, and if cats are sharing litter trays, they will be rapidly re-infected, as was the experience in Households C and E, with large numbers of cats, even though they were kept in small groups. In Household C, re-infection of cat C6 occurred in less than 9 days: she was housed with one cat who had failed to clear the virus on a 2mg/kg dose of Mutian X; the cat litter used was sawdust based. It could be argued that Cat C6 was shedding virus intermittently, but she was housed in a group who had failed to clear virus at the2mg/kg dose, thus she was far more likely to have been re-infected than latently infected.\n\nIntermittent virus shedding was not seen in any cat in this trial, nor in previous studies of sequential tests on hundreds of cats using the modern, sensitive FCoV RT-qPCR technology (Addie, unpublished observation), and controlling for false negative results due to faecal PCR inhibitors (Dye et al, 2008 ).\n\nIn our experience, cats either shed virus continuously or they stop shedding virus: the appearance of intermittent virus shedding could always be traced back to exposure to faeces of an infected cat; or where virus quantity was so low that it was on the borderline of the ability of the assay to detect it, or by the presence of excessive cat litter on the sample: Fuller's Earth based cat litters bind organic material.\n\nNo side effects of Mutian X were observed by us other than one cat having initially vomited some capsules, which might have been an adverse reaction, although that cat didn't vomit subsequent capsules. However, that does not mean that Mutian X is without side effects: elevation of liver enzymes has been seen in cats with FIP that are being treated for many weeks (DDA unpublished observation).\n\nUse of a laboratory that has an adequately sensitive FCoV RT-qPCR test is absolutely essential for the detection and eradication of FCoV from a household. False negative results will doom the effort to failure. Six of eight samples sent to one highly reputable university veterinary laboratory were falsely reported as negative (data not shown.) A major problem identified during our study was that the delay in reporting FCoV RT-qPCR results-usually of at least one week from the date of sample submission-delayed separation of negative and positive cats, and allowed re-infection of cats that had cleared infection.\n\nThis study showed that the oral administration of Mutian X tablets, at a dose of 4mg/kg for four days, stopped shedding of FCoV from naturally infected cats. This treatment would be a useful adjunct for establishing FCoV-free households of cats, in addition to current measures of hygiene, housing cats in small groups and the use of virus-inhibiting cat litter (Addie et al, 2019) . Further observations of cats which stopped shedding virus should determine whether Mutian X can prevent the development of FIP. Also, if the serum anti-FCoV titres of treated cats decline over the coming year, it will indicate that the virus has been cleared systemically, as well as from the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nIn this graph, the records of faecal FCoV RNA detection-RT-qPCR C T -is shown on the y axis and the time in days on the x axis for three cats A3, A4 and B1. Each time point indicates a faecal test. This graph is normalised to time zero for test period for Mutian X start.\n\nMutian X was given for 7 days from Days 0 to Cats A3, A4, and B1 after which their faecal samples remained negative for 155, 157 and 51 days (x axis only shows up to 60 days). The graph shows that no intermittent virus shedding or re-infection occurred. Faecal FCoV RNA detection-RT-qPCR C T -is shown on the y axis and the time in days on the x axis for ten cats treated with Mutian X at an oral dose of 2mg/kg SID ( Fig. 2A) , and for eleven cats at a dose of 4mg/kg SID (Fig. 2B) . Each time point indicates a faecal test. These graphs are normalised to time zero for the start of the Mutian X treatment and cut off at Day 60 and 400 prior to testing: the exact extent of the no treatment control period is indicated in Table 2 .\n\nTwo cats (C8 and C10) failed to clear the infection at 2mg/kg dose ( Fig. 2A) and were treated again at 4mg/kg (Fig. 2B) . Cat C6 was kept in a group with Cats C8 and C10, became re-infected, and required re-treatment, which is why this cat also features in both figures. The aim of this scatter plot was to determine whether cats that were shedding a higher amount of virus required more days of anti-viral treatment than cats with a lower virus quantity. Daily monitoring of faeces was available for 14 cats (there are 4 results at C T 23, two are overlaid which gives an appearance of 13 samples). Although there was a slight incline in the trendline, there was no correlation between starting FCoV RNA C T and days to a negative result (R=0.0048). prior to this study (immunohistochemistry was not performed to confirm diagnosis). FIP was suspected in a second cat (E14) and Mutian treatment was begun; but he had multicentric lymphoma, so the anti-viral drug was stopped. Cats were divided into three groups of up to eight cats. 10 cats became infected during the study period despite clumping bentonite-based cat litter being used.\n\nResults of 5 infected cats (E6, E8, E10, E11 and E13), could not be counted as having stopped shedding due to Mutian X because of the absence of a faecal sample immediately prior to Mutian X treatment: it is therefore possible that they had ceased shedding virus prior to onset of treatment. However, it is also possible that they had stopped shedding virus within 24 hours of treatment.\n\nFCoV pos = FCoV being shed in faeces during time of the Mutian treatment part of the study. "}
