{"title": "Contemporary Hospitality and Tourism Management Issues in China and India", "body": "This chapter is organised into two parts. The first part deals with tourism trends in China. It begins by considering the tourist resources that China has to offer. It continues by examining the impact of tourism in terms of the number of visitors, both domestic and international, and the impact that this has on China's economy.\n\nIt concludes by considering China's tourism policies and the challenges or barriers that the Chinese tourist industry must face in early part of the twenty-first century.\n\nThe second part is a mirror image of the first part, but it concentrates upon India.\n\nChina is the world's fourth largest country in area. It covers over 9.3 million square kilometres. Bordered by 14 other countries, it is extremely diverse in climate, culture and terrain. An example of its diversity is its climate that ranges from tropical in the south to sub-arctic in the north. In terms of ethnicity, 56 different nationalities are identified (Shen, 2003) .\n\nAs a whole, China is rich in tourism resources and covers the whole of the tourism experience. China has major cosmopolitan cities such as Beijing and Shanghai; a wealth of old historic structures such as the Great Wall and the Forbidden City; a diverse geography that includes mountains, deserts, lakes and forests and UNESCO sites. It has a diversity of ethnic groups and is now placing itself firmly in the areas of eco-tourism and sport tourism (Lew, Yu, Ap and Guangrui, 2003) . Importantly, China has a long history and is comparable to India, Egypt and ancient European civilisations making it rich in cultural and historic attractions (Zhang, Pine and Lam, 2005) . It has a civilisation that is more than 5,000 years old (Shen, 2003) . The Olympics, which is the foremost sporting event in the world, will be in Beijing and other lesser known cities such as Qingdao in 2008. The Olympics will be a vast showcase for China's tourism potential.\n\nTourism is still in its early stages but there are already 119 national parks and 500 provincial parks. Over 4,600 scenic places and places of historic interest have been identified (Shen, 2003) . There are theme parks and facilities for sport/leisure, arts, performances and cultural entertainment. Theme parks in particular are booming with the Splendid China, Window of the World and the Chinese Folk Culture Village in Shenzhen, Southern China (Wu, Zhu and Xu, 2000) . The popularity of theme/amusement parks is demonstrated in Table 4 .1, which indicates that theme/amusement parks account for almost one-third of all tourist attraction spend. The popularity of theme parks continues with new parks planned on the mainland and in Hong Kong and Macau. In 2005, Disney opened in Hong Kong, and there are plans for another Disney in Shanghai by 2010. In Macau, over 90% of the population is employed in tourism, and there are plans to recreate San Francisco's Pier 39 as a tourist attraction. As is indicated by Table 4 .1, aside from theme/amusement parks China's major tourism products are its cultural and historic attractions (Wang and Qu, 2004) . It is these attractions that are most popular with international tourists. Zhong, Pine and Zhong (2000) and Gu (2003) identified four stages of tourism development in the People's Republic of China (PRC) from 1949. These include the following:\n\n1 Tourism as a political activity (1949) (1950) (1951) (1952) (1953) (1954) (1955) (1956) (1957) (1958) (1959) (1960) (1961) (1962) (1963) (1964) (1965) (1966) In this, stage tourism was not to be encouraged. International tourism was very small and was almost entirely limited to officials of the communist party. Domestic tourism was frowned upon and was regarded as contrary to the doctrine of communism.\n\n2 Standstill (1966) (1967) (1968) (1969) (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) (1976) (1977) (1978) This period saw the Cultural Revolution and the chaos that was brought with it to China. In this period, the upset and turmoil of the Cultural Revolution effectively closed China to tourism. As expected, the number of visitors in this period, both international and domestic, was almost negligible.\n\n3 Economic reconstruction or \"Open Door policy\" (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) The reforms of Deng Xiaopeng reversed the effects on tourism of the Cultural Revolution and opened up China to tourism. A country that had seen almost no tourists for 12 years was almost overnight open for business. The reasons for this were that after great and lengthy debate, the economic impact and benefits of tourism were recognised. Tourism was regarded as especially important for its potential as a foreign currency earner and as an important economic activity providing employment and income.\n\nBuilding on the economic changes of the third-stage tourism and its significance as an economic activity were further recognised by the Chinese government. Tourism was made part of the national plan and enjoyed priority status. Of the 31 provinces and regions, 24 recognised tourism as one of its pillar industries.\n\nAs the significance of tourism has increased so has tourism policy been formulated to enable and encourage further tourism development. Tourism policy in China has been described as top-down in that almost all of it stems from the government (Zhang, Chang and Jenkins, 2002) . A recent example of this is that the China National Tourism Association has developed the \"10th five-year Plan and Long term Goal Outlines up to 2015 and 2020 for Tourism development in China\" Over 20 years, the intention is to move China from a \"big tourism country\" to a \"powerful tourism country\" (CNTA, 2001) . In formulating this plan, specific and ambitious goals have been set -these are that by 2020,\n\n\u2022 Inbound tourist arrivals will be between 210 and 300 million. Of these, between 31 and 45 million will be foreign tourist arrivals. The figure for foreign tourist arrivals is to be a minimum of three times greater than the figure for the year 2000. \u2022 International earnings are to be from $58 billion to $82 billion, which must be a minimum of 3.6 times higher than the earnings of 2000. \u2022 Earnings from domestic tourism are to reach 2100 billion yuan, a figure that is six times greater than 2000.\n\nThe major tourism policies have concerned standards such as hotel star rating systems and investment in tourism. The major policies are shown in Table 4 1988 Regulations on star ratings and standards of tourist hotels.\n\nRegulatory and quality control.\n\n1996 Regulation administration of tour guides.\n\nRegulatory and quality control.\n\n1996 Regulation administration of travel agencies.\n\nRegulatory and quality control.\n\nSource: Adapted from Zhang et al. (2000) .\n\ninternational tourism development that stems for international business (Lew et al., 2003) . Aside from direct tourism policies, other policies not directly aimed at tourism such as paid holidays have encouraged and helped domestic tourism (see section on domestic tourism). Domestic tourism has been further helped by the increase in prosperity among China's population that has been brought about by China's economic miracle. This combination of economic and social policy has combined to give the Chinese population the prerequisites of time and income that are needed for travel. \n\nTourism is important to China both economically and culturally. As China moves towards becoming the world's largest economy, it is also becoming the world's most popular tourist destination. Table 4 .3 shows the predicted top ten world tourism destinations by 2020. It is predicted that by 2020, China will be the world's top tourism destination overtaking the old favourites such as France, Spain and the USA. One of the main reasons for this is the phenomenal rate of growth of tourism within China. The rate of growth is expected to average a stunning 8% per annum between 1995 and 2020. It should be noted from Table 4 .3 that these figures do not include Hong Kong and Macau. Hong Kong itself is predicted to be the fifth most popular tourism destination by the same time. China and Hong Kong together will have one-eighth of the world's market share of tourism by 2020.\n\nThe following section explores the impact of tourism on China. It begins by examining international tourism and its impact upon the balance of payments.\n\nInternational tourism concerns tourism across borders. As illustrated by Table 4 .4, China has experienced huge but erratic increases in tourism from 1999 to 2004. The downturn in international tourism in 2003 was largely a consequence of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak, when pleasure tourists decided to stay at home or visit other, safer destinations. Table 4 .5 illustrates the number of arrivals by purpose of visit. The largest increase from 1999 to 2004 has been in business visits. This increase of over one-third shows the importance of China as a business centre and is an indicator of the economic opportunity that is available in China. It is also an indicator of the strength of the Chinese economy that is now greater than that of the United Kingdom and is set to overtake Germany by 2007. The rate of growth of business travel (33.5% between 1999 and 2004) also illustrates the phenomenal growth rate of the Chinese economy that is doubling in size approximately every eight years. Table 4 .6 gives an interesting perspective on tourism arrivals by country of origin. Almost 60% of tourism arrivals to China are from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. This indicates the ease of travel from these places The economic importance of international tourism to China As a major player in international tourism, China is reaping enormous economic benefits. Table 4 .7 shows the receipts from incoming tourism. The table shows two figures: the current growth rate and the constant growth rate. Of the two, the more important is probably the constant growth rate as this compares spending although prices have remained the same. The figures illustrate the erratic and demand elastic nature of tourism where the SARS epidemic caused a constant growth rate reduction of 17.6% in 2003.\n\nIn 2004, tourism accounted for over 1% of GDP in China. This figure may appear small but when added to domestic tourism spend, it is a major contributor to the economic health and wealth of the nation.\n\nIt should be noted that China is not only a major tourism destination but it is also a major provider of international tourists. By 2020, China may be the world's top tourist destination, but it will also be the fourth largest tourist producing country. Table 4 .8 goes some way to illustrating this \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 phenomenon. Outgoing tourism has increased year on year from 1999 to 2004. At constant growth, outgoing tourism has increased by 176%. The number of Chinese tourists abroad is already greater than the number of Japanese tourists. It is estimated that by 2020, there will be 100 million Chinese visitors abroad (Macartney, 2006) . This increase in outgoing tourism is a consequence of increased prosperity, the European Union has made travel easier for Chinese citizens, and the ease and relatively low price of travel from China. The Chinese traveller is willing to spend but will save on hotels and food in order to spend on other goods (Macartney, 2006) .\n\nTourism is a service and as such is an invisible on the balance of payments accounts. Table 4 .9 shows tourism exports (receipts) and tourism imports (expenditure). The difference between the two is the travel balance. In the first four of the six years in the study, China had a surplus on its travel balance; that is, it attracted more tourism spend than it spent itself. However, the last two years indicate substantial deficits and that China is importing more tourism than is exporting. Tourism contribution to the Chinese economy is that it is a major earner of foreign currency that can be used to import other goods and services.\n\nDomestic tourism has increased by over 40% from 1999 to 2004 (Table 4 .10). Domestic tourism saw a surge in 2002 and a downturn in 2003 that was connected with the SARS outbreak that had been the cause of people staying at home. The first year in the period under study, 1999, coincided with the introduction of the \"golden holiday weeks\" This alone may have caused much of the increase in domestic tourism in that year (Euromonitor, 2005a) .\n\nSpending on domestic tourism stands at over 550 billion RMB in 2004. From 2002, spending has moved away for hotels and transport and has moved towards shopping and entertainment (Euromonitor, 2005a) . Wu, Zhu and Xu (2000) and Wang and Qu (2004) give three reasons for the increase in domestic tourism. They are as follows:\n\n1 The increased growth in income per capita, which has risen greatly over the past 10 years. It should be noted, however, that there are vast regional disparities, and major differences between urban and rural locations. 2 An increase in leisure time brought about by a five-day working week and new national holidays. Public holidays have been increased, and the working week has been shortened fairly dramatically from 1994. In 1994, the working week was decreased from six to five and half days. This was followed in 1995 by a further cut to five along with two weeks of paid vacation. In 1998, three public holidays -Labour Day, National Day and the Spring Festival -were extended to three days each with weekends, and all of these holidays are effectively extended to one week \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 each. It is estimated that urban Chinese people each receive 114 leisure days. This is key to stimulating the growth of domestic tourism (Zhang, Pine and Lam, 2005) . 3 Structural readjustments of the China's economy.\n\nDomestic tourism has been given further impetus by an increase in car ownership plus reasonable and relatively cheap airport facilities that are widely used by the domestic population. Domestic flights are frequent and airports in China have been constantly upgraded and renewed over the past five to ten years, although there remains room for improvement.\n\nThe economic impact of domestic tourism Gong and Kruse (2003) have evaluated the economic impact of domestic tourism in China. They point to four major economic impacts and benefits of the huge growth in domestic tourism in China. The first is that there is an \"interregional transfer of Chinese purchasing power\". This means that there is a transfer of incomes from the places in which the domestic tourists reside to the places that they visit. Gong and Kruse (2000) point to the lesser known seaside resort of Beidaine where 70% of all retail sales are generated by domestic tourism. This movement of incomes could go some way in improving regional income imbalances.\n\nThe second is that domestic tourism and its expenditure plus its multiplier effects are better for the growth of local economies than international tourism. The reasons that Gong and Kruse (2000) cite for this is that domestic tourism is by its nature less capital intensive, has more local involvement and serves a larger number of people.\n\nThird, domestic tourism provided business opportunities for small businesses. This gives a spur and a boost to local entrepreneurship that would not be gained by international tourism and the multinational enterprises that are attracted by it. Next, the economy may be managed through domestic tourism, for example, consumer spending may be increased by promoting domestic tourism.\n\nLast, domestic tourism may have social benefits. It should not be forgotten that China has vast disparities in income particularly between rural and urban populations. Tourism promotion in rural areas could go some way to alleviating poverty in rural areas.\n\nAlthough these benefits are given for China, it should be noted that they are fairly general and could also apply to India, which has similar disparities between urban and rural areas.\n\nNotwithstanding the benefits of domestic tourism, Zhang, Pine and Lam (2005) point out that there are three problems with domestic tourism in China. The first is that there is a lack of variety in the tourism offering. Chinese domestic tourism tends to concentrate upon sightseeing and natural and cultural attractions. It does not take advantage of the other attractions that China has to offer.\n\nSecond, there are problems that concern the knowledge and quality of tourism professionals, this is deemed to be lacking in the Chinese travel and tourism industry. This problem may lessen with the advent of competition in the travel market but may be at the expense of China's domestic businesses.\n\nLast, the average per capita income within China, and especially away from the large cities, is extremely low. This is a major barrier to domestic tourism as high disposable income is a prerequisite to tourism of any kind and is required to sustain it.\n\nThe World Travel and Tourism Council, WTCC (2006) , estimates that in 2006, an excess of 77 million people are employed directly and indirectly by travel and tourism in China. This is over one-tenth of all employment. This figure is expected to rise to almost 90 million by 2016.\n\nThese figures include the multiplier effect; that is, for each employee directly employed in travel and tourism, there are other people employed indirectly servicing travel and tourism. For example, a wine waiter in a hotel could be directly employed by tourism, and the wine supplier would be indirectly employed by tourism. Both parties would experience the benefits or otherwise of tourism.\n\nThe employment that tourism brings benefits the individual employee as he/she receives a wage or salary. It also benefits the government as it receives tax on the salary and tax revenues on the spending that the salary is used for.\n\nChina's tourism industry may be booming; however, it faces many challenges in the near future if its growth is to continue and the economic benefits are reaped (Gong and Kruse, 2003; Mak, 2003) . These challenges may be described as external competition, environmental costs, infrastructure, seasonality and possible overcapacity.\n\nChina will face increased competition from enterprises that are outside of its borders. China has been effectively opened up to competition by its entry into the WTO in 2000. The effect of this is that China's travel market is now open to external competition in the tourism market place. This may be multinational operators in hotels, attractions and transport. The question that this raises is -Can China's tourism enterprises survive this competition when there is no longer any protectionism? (Gong and Kruse, 2003) .\n\nTourism may have adverse environmental impacts upon China. Tourism and travel come at cost, not the least of which is the environment. China already has a very high proportion of the world's most polluted cities. How will tourism's environmental impacts be dealt with? Increased air \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 travel will add to global warming. Historic sites could be endangered. Tourism resources may be insufficient to deal with the increased number of visitors.\n\nAlthough great strides have been made, problems with its tourism infrastructure remain. Mak (2003) claims that transport remains one of the biggest barriers to tourism and its development in China. The reason given for this is that transport varies in standard across the provinces, and schedules are poor. Across all transport sectors, there are inefficiencies and relatively low economies of scale. Airlines are lacking in punctuality, and there are poor safety records. Roads are poor with few major motorways, cities are congested and there are many accidents leading inevitably to fears about the safety of tourists.\n\nTourism in China could suffer from seasonality, that is, that demand depends upon the time of year. Domestic tourism in China has its peaks, and these peaks coincide with the three long, major public holidays. Cities with major tourism attractions that attract international tourists, such as Beijing, may be extremely cold and unwelcoming in winter. This can lead to peaks and troughs in tourism that can in turn lead to employment being subject to season and give rise to seasonal unemployment, which would have attendant negative impacts upon incomes.\n\nThere is a possibility that there may be overcapacity in the travel and tourism industry. Gong and Kruse (2003, p. 99) suggest that tourism in China has become a \"development fad\" based upon the notion that tourism is \"good everywhere\" If tourism becomes too big and grows too quickly, there may be oversupply in the industry that may lead to greater rivalry and competition, which, in turn, may lead to inefficiencies in operations as operations are not at their capacity.\n\nFrom the international arrivals figures, much of international demand for China as a tourism destination is from compatriots from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and overseas Chinese. Many of these tourists are merely \"popping over\" the border or are visiting friends and family. Their expenditure may be low when compared to other more \"traditional\" tourists. The challenge to China is to widen its international tourist base. Further, the foreign tourists tend to concentrate on only a few destinations. These are Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Guilin, Shenzhen and Hangzhou, and it will be noted that two of these, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, are very close to the Hong Kong border. The remainder indicates a concentration of tourism expenditure in relatively few locations.\n\nChina is not the only tourism destination in Southeast Asia. Other destinations such as Vietnam and Cambodia are becoming popular; a consequence of this may be that China faces competition from these emerging destinations.\n\nChina has many positive growth factors that help its tourism industry. These growth factors include economic growth that is increasing its potential for business tourism, higher disposable incomes and enhanced leave entitlements. Additionally, improved promotion of China's tourism resources and the \"opening up\" of China through the WTO's agreement may give China's tourism industry the professionalism that it needs.\n\nDue to its vast resources, opportunities exist for other attractions that China may offer. These would include \"niche tourism\" products such as adventure tourism and eco-tourism.\n\nChina is an emerging nation and is set to become the world's \"number one\" tourism destination. China has recognised the economic benefits that tourism may bring and has implemented policies in order to receive these benefits.\n\nChina has vast, largely untapped tourism resources. It has a long history and a wealth of cultural and historic artefacts. There is a tremendous demand for incoming business and business tourism due to the strength of the economy. Domestic tourism demand has increased; this has been brought about by increases in disposable income and extra leisure and vacation time.\n\nNevertheless, China does still face problems; despite recent improvements, the infrastructure for tourism is poor. While improvements to airports have been made, road networks remain poor and slow. There are few motorways, and travel into major cities is extremely difficult as they are heavily congested. Tourism is concentrated in relatively few locations leaving some tourist attractions relatively ignored. Demand for incoming international tourism is largely from Hong Kong and other Chinese territories. Marketing to the rest of the world needs to be improved.\n\nIn conclusion, China has recognised the importance of tourism to its economy. It is doing relatively well from tourism exports and employment. If this is to continue, it will be necessary to both fund and manage tourism development properly in order to ensure that the benefits are sustained.\n\nThis section on tourism in India effectively mirrors that on China. It considers the tourist resources that India has to offer. As with previous section, it continues by examining the impact of tourism in terms of the number of visitors, both domestic and international, and the impact that this has on India's economy.\n\nIt concludes by considering India's tourism policies from 1945 and the challenges or barriers that the Indian tourist industry faces in early part of this century.\n\nIndia has a diversity of offering. It is the world's second most populous country. It has a wealth of tourism resources and should offer something\n\nfor every type of tourist. Abram, Edwards, Ford, Sen and Wooldrige (1999) state that India is geographically diverse; it has a diversity of landscape ranging from mountains to deserts.\n\nIndia is one of the world's oldest civilisations and has diversity within both its religions and its peoples. India has a variety of tourist attractions that include wildlife parks, beaches such as Goa, ancient monuments of which the most famous is probably the Taj Mahal, sites of pilgrimage, music and festivals, palaces and forts and hill stations such as Ooty. Yet despite this wealth of offering, India is regarded as a sleeping giant of tourism. It does not, at present, receive the number of tourists that are commensurate with its size and offerings. As Abram et al. (1999) say, it should be a Mecca for tourism, instead it is a sleeping giant. It may, however, be a sleeping giant that is to be awoken. Table 4 .11 shows India's top tourism attractions by type and sales in 2004. Table 4 .11 clearly indicates that historic buildings and sites are by far the most popular tourist attractions in India. They account for well over half of all tourist expenditure on attractions. These attractions include the Taj Mahal (see Table 4 .12). The Indian government gave a boost to visits to historic monuments by overseas tourists when it dropped the policy of increased prices to such attractions to foreign visitors. Attractions gaining in popularity are amusement parks (Euromonitor, 2005b) . Table 4 .12 shows tourist attractions by visitors. The top five attractions each have visitors in excess of 1 million each year. The Taj Mahal, closely followed by other historic monuments that represent India's historic and cultural tradition, probably unsurprisingly, heads the table. Tourism development, planning and policy in India Gupta, Lal and Bhattacharyya (2002) state that tourism planning started in India in 1945, when it was recommended that a separate tourist organisation with regional offices should be established. By 1948, this had become an ad hoc committee, which included representatives from the hospitality, tourism and transport industries.\n\nIn the intervening years to present day, the expansion of tourism has led to it being taken more seriously by the government, and increased provision has been made for it in the government's five-year plans. Recently, tourism has been given prominence and status as it has been recognised by the formation of Ministry of Tourism and Culture (Gupta, Lal and Bhattacharyya, 2002) . The role of the ministry involves the planning, publicity and programming of conferences, the travel trade, hospitality and accommodation. Additionally, it provides market research (including providing statistical information) and administration. These administrative functions are important as they include activities aimed at ridding tourism of some of its bureaucratic excesses such as simplification of frontier formalities and regulating the various activities that make up travel, for example hotels (Gupta, Lal and Bhattacharyya, 2002) . The role of government with regard to tourism has been one of providing direction.\n\nTourism planning Gupta, Lal and Bhattacharyya (2002) state that the Indian government has made several plans for tourism. These include the following:\n\nThis was aimed at achieving a growth in tourist arrivals and with it foreign exchange and employment. This was to be achieved by taking away some of the barriers to India's tourism potential. Essentially, this involved improving the infrastructure of tourism and developing certain areas for tourism growth and development. In addition, there were to be improvements to the tourism offering through the creation of heritage hotels and resorts and the introduction of river cruises and trains for tourists. Last, special airline and hotel packages to encourage tourism were to be developed.\n\nThe national strategy was developed after discussion with the planning commission and state governments. The proposals from these discussions included the following:\n\n1 Transport -airports and roads were to be modernised. The rail network was to be improved. 2 Improvements to the tourism infrastructure were to be made alongside environmental planning. 3 The development of new tourism products -cultural and eco-tourism. 4 A focused marketing strategy that includes both publicity and promotion.\n\nThe planning commission approved funding for the development of the tourism infrastructure. This included product development, manpower development and research. By 2002, there had been a 9% increase in tourism in India, but the performance of India as a major tourism player was poor as it only received 1% of the global market (Gupta, Lal and Bhattacharyya, 2002) . The Delhi declaration of 2001 attributed this poor performance to promotion and marketing.\n\nThis policy was devised as a framework for tourism that is led by government, is propelled by the private sector and is directly aimed at the welfare of the Indian community. Euromonitor (2005b) summarises the policy by saying that the part of the government is to provide the infrastructure for tourism along with the legislative framework; the private sector, in turn, provides a quality tourism product and the community supplements all of this by providing its support. The intention of the policy is to establish India as a global tourism brand, and add to and improve the products that the industry offers, for example through adventure and eco-tourism (Gupta, Lal and Bhattacharyya, 2002; Euromonitor, 2005b) . Seven key words to promote tourism were introduced. These are welcome, information, facilitation, safety, co-operation, infrastructure and cleanliness. It also, as with the previous policies, intends to improve the tourism infrastructure. However, this time funds, both private and public, and incentives to invest in tourism are available.\n\nAdditionally and importantly, the tenth five-year plan allocated 2,900 crores to tourism. The tenth five-year plan intends to make the following happen (Euromonitor, 2005b) .\n\n1 To place tourism firmly as a major driver of economic growth in India. 2 It recognises the multiplier effects of tourism in terms of job creation and economic growth. In doing this, it intends to bind the multiplier effects for their positive economic benefits. 3 To provide a spur for domestic tourism and to enlarge international tourism. 4 To place weight on India's tourism potential, effectively by awakening the sleeping giant and placing India as a global brand. 5 To create and develop new tourist circuits based upon India's culture and heritage.\n\nThe tenth five-year plan adds weight to this by providing a series of incentives aimed at encouraging investment in tourism and improving the infrastructure. With regards to the infrastructure, funding is available for the airports at Bangalore and Hyderabad. Money is also available for modernising the airports at New Delhi and Mumbai (Euromonitor, 2005b) . Incentives to tourism have been provided in two forms through lower taxes and incentives to investment. First, lower taxes resulted in the expenditure tax on hotels has been abolished. The obvious and immediate impact of this is to make hotels and therefore the tourism product more affordable. A further cut in taxation, although with a lesser impact, is that the customs duty on imported liquor has been reduced; this will have some impact in the luxury hotels market.\n\nSecond, there are significant incentives to invest in the hotel industry. The hotel industry has been given infrastructure status, the effect of this is that the hotel industry attracts a lower rate of interest and borrowing for hotel investment is cheaper. Additionally, financial institutions, for example, major banks receive tax breaks on income from hotel project loans. The impact of this is to make more funds available for building and improving hotels in the three-star categories and above (Euromonitor, 2005b) .\n\nThe new tourism policy and the tenth five-year plan appear for the first time to be placing a genuine emphasis on tourism and making positive efforts to improve the infrastructure for tourism. years in which tourism performance was patchy. International tourism increased by over 15% in 2003 and 22% in 2004, while tourism receipts rose by 16% and 32% respectively. Tourism is now regarded as a major driver of the Indian economy for the earnings and the employment that it brings. These figures came at a time when India received international accolades as a major tourism destination. The reasons for the turnaround in the fortune of the Indian tourist industry are mainly due to improvements to infrastructure and marketing and the alleviation of health fears. With regard to marketing, India has placed much time and effort into evolving the country as a major tourism destination and a global brand. Twenty-nine billion rupees have been allocated to improving the marketing effort of India's tourism. The government has given its support to publicity campaigns. Improvements have been made to the tourism infrastructure; this has been mostly manifested in improvements to a number of major airports. While these improvements are acknowledged, further improvements need to be made to the road and other transport networks. Table 4 .13 shows that arrivals to India have increased by 35.25% from 1999 to 2004, there have been increases in three of the categories of purpose of travel. The most impressive is in the business category in which travel has more than doubled in six years. These figures reflect the increasing importance of the Indian market on the world stage. The level of English in India is such that it is a favoured destination for the \"globalisation\" plans of many multinational enterprises, particularly in the world of banking and finance.\n\nThe 37% increase in the number of leisure visitors may be a reflection of the marketing of India as a destination. The upsurge in tourism to India is due to a combination of two factors. First, India has made attempts to improve its marketing of itself as a major tourism destination. Second, the growth of India's economy and its position within globalisation has made it a destination for foreign business travel. \n\nThe pattern of outgoing tourism has been erratic; outgoing tourism has experienced falls followed by recovery. Over the period from 1999 to 2004 there has been a massive increase in outgoing tourism. The reasons for this growth are all connected to the economy. First, there have been general increases in disposable income that is a prerequisite of tourism. Second, the globalisation of the Indian economy has led to the need for Indian business people to travel abroad for work (Euromonitor, 2005b ). net exporter of tourism and as such tourism is an invisible export that is a major earner of foreign currency. Tourism contribution is such that it accounts for over 5% of all exports. Its contribution as an invisible export is much greater than this. Given the poor performance of the Indian tourism until recently, the figures indicate the potential of tourism as an earner of foreign currency for the Indian economy. Table 4 .18 shows the increase in domestic tourism in India from 1999 to 2004. Over that period, domestic tourism has increased by over 80% (Euromonitor, 2005b) . Domestic tourism has seen year on year increases each year from 1999 to 2004. Despite the huge increase, the number of trips remains low when the population is taken into consideration. Notwithstanding, this spending on domestic tourism in 2004 stood at over 538 billion rupees. It should be noted that statistics for Indian domestic tourism trips create a difficulty in that business trips are included within them and are not shown separately (Euromonitor, 2005b) . Euromonitor (2005b) and Mintel (2003) give five main reasons for the increase in domestic tourism. These may be summarised as improved facilities, price competition, better disposable incomes, government policy and improved marketing. First, there has been an improvement in tourist facilities, which could further improve with the budget hotels that have arrived in the Indian accommodation market. Second, competition on price between public and private carriers has resulted in prices being cut, and the first budget carrier -Air Deccan -has arrived in the air transport market.\n\nThird, disposable income has increased, particularly in industry and services. Gross Domestic Product and disposable incomes have grown faster than the population. A sign of the increased disposable incomes is that between 1999 and 2004 spending on leisure services increased by more than 50% at constant prices (Euromonitor, 2005b) . Next, government policy towards tourism has given a boost to tourism. The tenth five-year plan reduced taxation on hotels making accommodation prices cheaper; fiscal policy has been used to increase household spending by reducing personal taxation.\n\nLast, government tourism policy has been aimed at promoting tourism and its infrastructure. To this end, 29 billion rupees were allocated. While it is too early to establish cause or effect, it may be that tourism promotion that has been advocated since 1945 is beginning to work.\n\nEarlier in this chapter, the economic impact of domestic tourism in China was evaluated. Four major economic impacts and benefits of the huge growth in domestic tourism in China were given. These were an interregional transfer of purchasing power that may redress regional income imbalances, the multiplier effects of domestic tourism and the management of the economy through domestic tourism. As India has similar regional imbalances and disparities in incomes between urban and rural populations, it is likely that India may experience similar impacts to those claimed for China.\n\nAdditionally, India may receive social benefits in that tourism may go some way to alleviating poverty within the country.\n\nThe WTCC (2006) estimates that in 2006 an excess of 24 million people are employed directly and indirectly by travel and tourism in India. This figure is approximately 3% of all employment. In percentage terms, it is very low when compared to major international tourism destinations but placed India in second place in the world tourism employment league.\n\nThese figures include the multiplier effects that were explained in the section on China. As with China, the employment that tourism brings benefits the individual employee as he/she receives a wage or salary. It also benefits the government as it receives tax on the salary and tax revenues on the spending that the salary is used for.\n\nChallenges to India's tourism industry Mintel (2003) says that barriers to the growth of tourism in India were identified at the WTCC's India Initiative. The retreat at Agra identified that there are five major barriers that India's tourism industry must overcome if it is to improve its ranking in the world's tourism league tables, and, importantly enjoy the benefits that tourism may bring.\n\nThe first barrier, a consequence of civil aviation policy, is that fares are high and schedules can be erratic. The second barrier is that visa processing may be slow and lengthy, leading almost inevitably to significant delays that can be a deterrent to tourist demand.\n\nThird, although much is being done to address it, destination marketing is poor when compared to other major tourist destinations. India does not have an Olympic Games or an Expo to showcase its attractions. Next, the infrastructure for tourism, particularly the rail networks, leave room for a great deal of improvement. The final barrier identified was that India was seen to be slow in responding to and managing both crises that impact upon tourism and opportunities that may arise for tourism.\n\nThe opportunities for travel and tourism in India will arise from business and leisure demand. Leisure demand will depend upon India's ability to overcome the barriers that were identified and the ability to open up the tourism products and attractions that it has.\n\nThe WTCC's India Initiative identified new products that India could exploit to improve its position in world tourism. These new products and the markets that go with them will need careful marketing if they are to be a success. The potential new markets include cultural tourism (India has 22 world heritage sites), adventure tourism in the Himalayas, eco-tourism in the Himalayas and the Andaman and Nicobar islands and holistic healing and rejuvenation (Mintel, 2003) .\n\nChina and India are two emerging nations that appear to be faring very differently in world tourism. China is set to become the world's \"number one\" tourism destination while the WTCC has described India, with all of its resources, as the \"sleeping giant\" of tourism. Nevertheless, there are indications that India may be awakening from its slumber as it, along with China, recognises the economic benefits that tourism may bring.\n\nTourism in both countries has similarities. Both China and India have vast, largely untapped tourism resources. They have long histories and a wealth of cultural and historic artefacts. Both countries have a tremendous demand for incoming business due to the strength of their economies. Both countries have increased demand for domestic tourism brought about by increases in disposable income and extra leisure and vacation time.\n\nThe problems that they face are also similar. Both, despite recent improvements, have poor infrastructures for tourism. While both have made improvements to airports, road networks remain poor and slow. Major cities are heavily congested. Similarly, both China and India tend to have tourism concentrated in relatively few locations leaving some tourist attractions relatively ignored.\n\nIn conclusion, China and India have recognised the importance of tourism to their economies. Both are doing relatively well from tourism exports and employment. If they are to continue, it will be necessary for both countries to fund and manage tourism development properly in order to ensure that the benefits are sustained."}
