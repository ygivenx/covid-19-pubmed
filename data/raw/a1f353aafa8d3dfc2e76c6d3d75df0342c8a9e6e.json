{"title": "Acute Encephalopathy Associated with Influenza A Infection in Adults Technical Appendix Methods on Virus Detection and the Measurements of Cytokine and Oseltamivir Concentrations Section I. Methods of Virus Detection Influenza viral RNA was detected using H1/H3 subtype-specific primers (1,2) (H1: 5\uf0a2-TGA GGG AGC AAT TGA GTT CA-3\uf0a2 and 5\uf0a2-TGC CTC AAA TAT TAT TGT GT-3\uf0a2; H3: 5\uf0a2-GCA ACT GTT ACC CTT ATG AT-3\uf0a2 and 5\uf0a2-TCA TTG TTT GGC ATA GTC AC-3\uf0a2). After", "body": "Enterovirus RNA was detected by one-step real-time RT-PCR (3, 4) . Amplification is specific for the 5\uf0a2 untranslated region. Enterovirus RNA extracted from cell-culture fluid of clinical isolate confirmed by immunofluorescent was used as the source of positive control. RNA from the plasmid pAW109 was used as internal control for nucleic acid extraction as well as for the presence of inhibitors in the clinical samples. Primers and probes used were as follows: primer for enterovirus (EV), 5\uf0a2-ACATGGTGTGAAGAGTCTATTGAGCT-3\uf0a2, respectively. The performance of the assay was demonstrated by analysis of 3 replicates of quality control samples at 3 levels. The coefficients of variation (CV%) during the analysis of OP were 4.1%,1.9% and 2.1% at 3 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 150 ng/mL, respectively (limit of detection of OP, 0.25 ng/mL). The coefficients of variation (CV%) during the analysis of OC were 2.3%, 0.5%, and 3.1% at 30 ng/mL, 400 ng/mL, and 4,000 ng/mL, respectively."}
