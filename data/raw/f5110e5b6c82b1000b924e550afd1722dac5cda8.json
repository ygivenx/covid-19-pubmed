To date, 3CLpro has been experimentally confirmed in all coronaviruses studied. Coronavirus taxonomy has identified the non-structural protein (nsp) domain of the coronavirus replicase polyprotein containing 3CLpro activity as nsp5, since the proteinase is the only known activity of the protein. 3CLpro is also referred to as Mpro (main proteinase); however, this is a subjective designation based on the number of cleavage events, rather than on a demonstrated greater importance for replication or pathogenesis. 3CLpro was also infrequently described in early literature by the observed or predicted molecular mass (p27 or p29 for MHV, p34 for HCoV-229E, p35 for IBV, and p33 for SARS-CoV). The actual sizes of the 3CL proteinases have not been precisely determined by gel filtration, but have been calculated to be 33 kDa from the sequences. Because of the variation in sizes and evidence for differences in calculated and apparent masses, the 3CLpro, 3CLP, or nsp5 nomenclature is preferred.\n\nCoronavirus 3CLpro proteolytic activity was first confirmed in 1995 [2] . The determinants of 3CLpro cleavage site specificity appear to be highly conserved among coronaviruses [3, 4] . 3CLpro almost exclusively cleaves following Gln, with only one known exception of His at a single cleavage site in HCoV-HKU1 [3, 5] . There is a strong preference for the small non-charged residues Ser, Gly, Ala at P1 0 , but Cys can also be tolerated [3] . There also is a very strong preference for Leu at P2, but some sites contain Phe, Met and Ile [3] . Much less specificity is found at P3, P4, P2 0 and P3 0 . Overall, the most common cleavage site found in all coronaviruses is PLQk(S/G/A/ V) [2] . 3CLpro catalytic activity has been shown in vitro to be most active at the autoproteolytic N-terminal cleavage site [6] . Substitution of the Gln at P1 of IBV 3CLpro abolished proteolytic activity in vitro [7] . There are no other known or predicted cleavage site substrates for 3CLpro, and no cleavage of cellular proteins by 3CLpro has been reported. Coronavirus 3CLpro activity in vitro occurs in trans, while cis autoproteolytic cleavage of a polyprotein precursor has not been detected [8] . Autoproteolytic cleavage of 3CLpro from the polyprotein occurs at an N-terminal cleavage site in IBV, MHV and HCoV-229E [7\u00c09]. In vitro analyses of expressed and purified 3CLpro have resulted in the conclusion that protease exists as a mixture of monomer and dimer forms with continual monomericdimeric exchange [10] . Experiments altering or deleting residues that result in solution or crystallographic obligate monomers incapable of dimerization are catalytically inactive in vitro [11] . Whether one or both monomers in a dimer are functional is controversial, and may be dependent on the termini, presence of flanking proteins and pH. The loss of function in a monomer has been associated with collapse of the active site cavity in one monomer and maintenance of an open conformation in the other [12] . Several groups have concluded from in vitro experiments that dimerization is absolutely required for 3CLpro activity [10] . However, a recent study has suggested that disruption of the dimerization determinants may not prevent N-terminal autoproteolytic cleavage [13] .\n\nModification of the N-terminus or C-terminus by the addition of sequences or tags significantly reduces in vitro 3CLpro activity [5] . The calculated pI values for coronavirus 3CLpro range from 5.81 to 6.08. The experimental pH optimum for MHV 3CLpro activity is 7.0, although the enzyme remains active across a broad pH range from pH 5.5 and 8.0. Reducing agents are not required for cleavage by E. coli-expressed recombinant 3CLpro (r3CLpro), but also do not interfere with proteolytic activity; activity is maintained in the presence of 0.2\u00c025 mM 2-ME and 0.1\u00c0100 mM DTT [14] . The MHV 3CLpro is sensitive to inhibition by inhibitors of both serine and cysteine proteinases, but is not affected by aspartic proteinase inhibitors [15] . MHV 3CLpro activity is inhibited in MHV-infected cells by leupeptin, PMSF, N-ethylmaleimide and E-64d [7] . MHV 3CLpro is also inhibited by high concentrations of ZnCl 2 (2 mM) and 1,10-phenanthroline (10 mM), but is unaffected by EDTA even at high concentrations (10 mM) [15] . Thus any role of metal ions in 3CLpro activity remains to be established.\n\nMore than 17 solved X-ray structures of 3CLpro are available for at least five different coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, TGEV, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and IBV) and with resolutions ranging from 2.8 \u00c5 to 1.6 \u00c5 . In addition, structures of SARS-CoV 3CLpro have been solved for deletion and substitution mutants, as well as for 3CLpro complexed with peptide substrates and potential inhibitors [10,11,16\u00c018] . Crystals for all solved 3CLpro molecules are asymmetric units consisting of 1-to-3 3CLpro homodimers (Figure 546.1B) . Structural data indicate greater conservation of tertiary and quaternary structures than of primary amino acid structure, even between distantly related coronaviruses. 3CLpro also contains a C-terminal third domain (D3) of unclear function. Truncations of D3 reduced or abolished proteolytic activity of MHV and HCoV 3CLpro, while 67 amino acid truncations of the Cterminal domain were tolerated by IBV 3CLpro [15, 19, 20] .\n\nCoronavirus 3CLpro is synthesized as a domain within an 800 kDa polyprotein that is autoproteolytically cleaved to generate the mature 3CLpro and other viral replicase proteins. Mutagenesis of 3CLpro of MHV, IBV, HCoV-229E and FIPV has confirmed that His and Cys are essential active site residues [9, 15, 21, 22] . In contrast, substitutions at residues consistent with catalytic Asp residues of other RNA virus 3Cpro or 3CLpro did not alter 3CLpro-mediated cleavage [9, 15, 21, 22] . Thus coronavirus 3CLpro functions with a catalytic dyad of His and Cys. The substrate-binding S1-subsite domains for coronavirus 3CLpro may differ from those of other RNA viruses, with Tyr-X-His substituted for Gly-X-His and strongly constrained (Figure 546 .1A) [3] . A conditional temperature-sensitive mutation (V148A) was identified behind the active site pocket of MHV 3CLpro. Predictive structural modeling suggested alterations in the rotameric position of a Met side-chain of the Tyr-Met-His sequence as a possible mechanism for temperature sensitivity [34] .\n\nPreparation MHV 3CLpro has been isolated in an active form from virus-infected cells [8] . Active 3CLpro from MHV and IBV have also been expressed from multiple types of vectors including rabbit reticulocyte lysates and a variety of in vitro translation systems. MHV 3CLpro/maltosebinding protein (MBP/3CLpro) and His-tagged fusion products has also been expressed in E. coli [14, 23] . However, studies have recently shown that modification of the N-and C-termini may affect protease activity [6] . The recombinant proteinase is active in trans after separation of the MBP from the 3CLpro at a factor Xa cleavage site [10, 24] . More recent studies have engineered 3CLpro to have N-and C-terminal modifications, which may be removed before in vitro analysis [6, 25] . Similarly, an HCoV-229E 3CLpro/\u03b2-galactosidase fusion protein expressed in E. coli has proteolytic activity in an in vitro, trans-cleavage assay [9] . The FIPV 3CLpro has been expressed as a fusion with maltose-binding protein [4] . Rabbit polyclonal antibodies have been produced against 3CLpro from MHV, IBV, HCoV-229E, and SARS-CoV [8, 9, 21, 26] , and have been used for immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and purification of 3CLpro. There are no commercially available antibodies to these proteinases.\n\nCoronaviruses contain a 27\u00c032 kb, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. During viral replication, the viral proteinases, polymerase, and other replicase proteins are translated from the input genome as a large (B800 kDa) polyprotein that contains multiple protein domains and 11 confirmed 3CLpro cleavage sites. The replicase polyprotein undergoes post-translational processing to liberate the active forms of the viral replicase proteins (Figure 546 .2). One or two papain-like proteinases also are expressed as part of the coronavirus replicase polyprotein and mediate one, two, or thee maturation cleavages [27\u00c029] (see Chapter 494). Processing of the coronavirus polyprotein occurs continuously throughout the infection cycle, and 3CLpro is required for viral replication [30] . Within the polyprotein, 3CLpro (nsp5) is flanked nsp4 and nsp6, hydrophobic proteins with multiple transmembrane domains that are involved in membrane association and presentation of the proteinase and formation of replication complexes. Microsomal membranes are not required for activity of the mature 3CLpro from cells or in vitro translates from E. coli, or for activity of 3CLpro expressed with only small portions of nsp4 and nsp6 [8, 9] . In contrast, expression of nsp5 with nsp4 and/or nsp6 confers a requirement for membranes for cleavage of nsp5 [7, 31] . , amino and carboxy termini (N and C), the catalytic dyad residues (H41 and C145, black) and substrate binding residues (Y161\u00c0H163, green) are shown. The image was prepared from the Protein Data Bank entry (2H2Z) [25] . B. SARS 3CLpro dimers with domain 3 (gray) of monomer b oriented out of the page and monomer a oriented into the page. The image above shows the catalytic residues (black/gray) exposed distal from the dimerization interface. The image below exhibits the dimer above turned 90 out of the page. The images were prepared from the Protein Data Bank entry (2GT7) [37] .\n\nRecently, several studies have shown that interactions within the coronavirus replication complex may be critical for 3CLpro activity. Several studies have reported that mutations in other replicase proteins have directly altered and impaired 3CLpro activity [32, 33] . 3CLpro mutations also have been identified that significantly alter 3CLpro activity in vitro and during the course of an infection despite physical distance from the substrate binding pocket, catalytic residues, and known dimerization determinants [34, 35] . While the global regulation of coronavirus replication and the significance of these findings remain to be determined, the development and use of robust reverse genetics systems and in vitro 3CLpro expression systems promises rapid progress in understanding these important proteinases.\n\nThe coronavirus 3CLpro functions with a catalytic dyad of His and Cis. Whether the 3C endopeptidases of family C3 contain a catalytic triad has been controversial, but if so, then the coronavirus 3CLpro may have a different structure and catalytic mechanism from other 3C-like proteinases and may provide the nucleophile activity of a third residue in novel ways. The coronavirus 3CL proteinases contain a significantly larger number of amino acids C-terminal to the putative substrate-binding residues than other 3C or 3C-like proteinases. The extended region contains several predicted \u03b2 sheet and \u03b1 helical motifs and appears to be important for proteinase activity and dimerization. The helical C-terminal domain (D3) is unique to the protein databases and is known to contain key dimerization determinants. However, other functions of this domain have yet to be explored. Finally, the conservation of hydrophobic domains flanking 3CLpro in the coronavirus replicase polyproteins suggests they may serve a novel role in regulation of 3CLpro activity.\n\nThe articles of Ziebuhr et al. [3] , and Hegyi et al. [4] provide extensive reviews of all aspects of the enzyme. The review article by Perlman et al. [36] expands on the role of 3CLpro in the context of general coronavirus replication and pathogenesis. "}
