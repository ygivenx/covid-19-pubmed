Our main intention was to provide food for thought 28 and discussion regarding the use of panel assays in the light of some relevant publications. In 29 particular, we aimed at discussing the limitations of their analytical aspects and clinical 30 validation. We respectfully disagree with the statement that \"The authors suggest that the 31 increasing use of rapid, automated, syndromic molecular panels for respiratory viruses (RVs) 32 should be abandoned in favor of more limited PCR testing for RVs\". As microbiologists and 33 clinicians, we rather suggest that we have the responsibility to promote diagnostic stewardship 34 in order to integrate these new technologies in clinical management, while considering their 35 strengths and limitations. We also highlight the value of a multiple-step approach of testing 36 that does not necessarily preclude their use. 37 We agree with the implementation of rapid diagnostic assays for RVs given that several We agree that one of the important aspects of testing is that the results be obtained in a 49 meaningful timeframe for clinicians. In particular, short turnaround times have an impact on "}
