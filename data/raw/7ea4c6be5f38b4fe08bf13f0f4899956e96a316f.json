Within one week, Chinese 4 health authorities were able to link these cases to a novel, enveloped RNA coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, 5 now commonly known to cause COVID-19 2 . By February 14, 2020, over 66,000 cases of COVID-19 6 were reported in China 3 . On January 19, a 35-year-old man returning from Wuhan to his home in 7\n\nSnohomish County, Washington, presented to urgent care with several days of cough and fever and 8 ultimately tested positive for COVID-19, becoming the first case in the United States. The first COVID-9 related death occurred 4 weeks later, associated with a separate site, along-term care facility in Kirkland, 10 WA, which rapidly became a cluster of 30 fatal cases as of March 16th. At the writing of this article, 11\n\nMarch 17th, there are 1,012 confirmed cases in the state of Washington, with 52 deaths, primarily in King 12\n\nCounty. Evergreen Health, the major medical center in Kirkland has recently declared that they have no 13 remaining critical care capacity. 14 COVID-19 is now a global pandemic that is advancing at a pace that-without immediate 15 attenuation-will rapidly overtake medical infrastructures. This has been painfully evinced in regions of 16\n\nItaly and Iran. For the United States, public health experts worry that this outbreak will continue to 17 escalate, at least in the short term 4 . With this backdrop, cancer care remains an essential clinical need, for 18 which timely radiation therapy is a cornerstone modality. Concurrently, patients with cancer may have a 19 5-fold relative risk for severe manifestations, such as requiring invasive ventilation or death, compared to 20 the general population 5 . In this article, we report our experience with delivering high-quality, patient-21 centered radiotherapy at an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic within the USA. Our aim is to describe 22 policies and procedures which we have found helpful for our own patient population, staff, and 23\n\nThe Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Washington is comprised of seven 25 sites of practice, in both hospital-based and outpatient, including community, settings, across the Seattle-26\n\nPuget Sound area. On average, more than 220 patients are treated each day in our department, with cases 27 ranging in complexity from whole-breast radiotherapy to immunocompromised, pediatric patients 28 requiring anesthesia. Immediately after the public announcement of the presence of COVID-19 in our 29 community, our department serially instituted policies and procedures which synthesized national, state, was felt indispensable to patient care. In this regard, our institution has expanded teleconferencing 47 capacity to be able to support up to 50,000 simultaneous online conferences. Crucially, during the 48 relatively short roll-out of distancing policies, a relatively user-friendly teleconferencing solution was 49 promulgated. This empowered any single user to initiate an individualized, HIPAA-compliant 50 teleconference session on demand. 51\n\nIn order to reduce exposure where possible, new patient consultations for treatment of indolent or 52 benign conditions are deferred at the discretion of the radiation oncologist. Routine follow-ups are 53 offered to patients via telephone or postponed. At an institutional level, providers are being quickly 54 certified for telemedicine, with proposals to temporarily relaxed billing standards. 55\n\nIn terms of the safety of patients, the department has taken a number of early actions to limit the 56 spread of coronavirus to and from patients while still allowing treatments to continue. A site visit to our 57 clinics by our institution's infection control team was highly valuable, and this experience directly led to 58 specific interventions that bolstered the continued treatment of patients while mitigating transmission risk. 59\n\nThis session incorporated end-to-end patient tracing to identify opportunities to mitigate patient-to-60 patient, patient-to-staff, and staff-to-staff transmission. Screening of patients and staff for upper 61 respiratory symptoms (fever, cough, rhinorrhea) is crucial for infection control. At many of our sites, 62\n\nthere are multiple ports of entry into the clinic. As such, all patients are screened twice: once upon 63 entering the building and again upon entering the department. Patients who are screened positive for over telephone, and appropriately triaged. Details of our testing algorithm specific to our patient 66 population can be found in Figure 1 . All patients are asked to either thoroughly wash their hands or use 67 effective hand sanitizers upon entering and leaving an exam or treatment room. 68\n\nFortunately, while all radiotherapy patients are screened, few have required testing, and none 69 have tested positive thus far. As radiation therapy is often a necessary part of lifesaving cancer care, we 70 anticipate treating patients with presumed or proven COVID-19. For the standard treatment, our 71 institution has recommended droplet precautions (surgical mask, goggles, gloves, gown) and use of a 72 private waiting room. These patients will be treated at the end of the day, in a particular vault that is 73 extensively decontaminated afterwards. For treatments with anesthesia, the risk of aerosol transmission 74 is high, and airborne precautions are required (N-95 mask, face shield, gloves, gown, personal respirator 75 in some instances). At our main facility, a negative-pressure vault is available for treating patients 76 requiring airborne precautions. 77\n\nThe rate of consumption of personal protective equipment (PPE) has been high and is expected to 78 greatly increase in our facilities. Prior to implementing stringent conservation protocols, the University of Controller (ABC, Elekta Inc.) which is used at several centers. Some elements of this device cannot be 89 decontaminated so the device will not be used in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and 90 abdominal compression will be used instead. 91\n\nDespite having no COVID-positive patients undergoing radiotherapy as of yet at our centers, 92 healthcare provider depletion is becoming a pressing issue. Within our department, at least 4 physicians 93 were required to undergo testing after a self-administered online survey for low-grade symptoms. While 94 they were all ultimately found to be uninfected, this process removed them from patient care for at least In these trying times, the training of medical and physics residents remains fundamental to our 97 department's mission. Balancing training and the principles of social distancing, provider preservation, 98\n\nand PPE conservation is a delicate task. While immersion and availability have been beneficial tenets of 99 training, they are subsumed by the need to mitigate transmission. Residents on a research block or on 100 days without patient visits are instructed to work from home. All lectures and didactic activities have The potential disruptions to training and professional development are understandably a source of 115 anxiety for trainees. At UW, we attempt to allay some of these concerns by regular, quarterly meetings as 116 well as one-on-one meetings between the residents and the chair. Our department also recognizes that 117 many of our residents and faculty have young children and face tremendous challenges as schools and 118 childcare services have begun shutting down in the Seattle area. Further, some have partners who are 119 internal medicine trainees who have already been asked to directly care for COVID-19 patients, or cover 120 clinics so others may do so as the healthcare provider pool becomes depleted. Many trainees have neither 121 the resources to hire personal back-up care nor the social network to summon pro bono care. As a 122 response, we have initiated a grassroots effort to pool childcare resources within the UW medical 123 community. Many university and medical students on academic furlough due to the pandemic have 124 volunteered to serve as childcare resources specifically to healthcare providers. 125\n\nWe intend the above experiences to be descriptive rather than prescriptive and strongly encourage 126 everyone to follow guidance from The Centers for Disease Control and State Department of Health, as "}
