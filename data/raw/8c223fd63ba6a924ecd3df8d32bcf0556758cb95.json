{"title": "Nanopore-based native RNA sequencing provides insights into", "body": "In the last decade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies 1 revolutionized the field of 54 microbiology 2 , which is not only reflected in the exponential increase in the number of fully 55 sequenced microbial genomes, but also in the detection of microbial diversity in many hitherto 56 inaccessible habitats based on metagenomics. Using transcriptomics, important advances were 57 also possible in the field of RNA biology 3,4 that shaped our understanding of the transcriptional 58 landscape 5,6 and RNA-mediated regulatory processes in prokaryotes 7 . RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) 59 technologies can be categorized according to their platform-dependent read lengths and necessity 60 of a reverse transcription and amplification steps, to generate cDNA 8 . Illumina sequencing yields 61\n\nhighly accurate yet short sequencing reads (commonly 100-300 bp). Hence, sequence information 62 is only available in a fragmented form, making full-length transcript-or isoform-detection a 63 challenging task 9,10 . Sequencing platforms developed by Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) and Oxford 64 Nanopore Technologies (ONT) solved this issue. Both sequencing methods are bona fide single-65 molecule sequencing techniques that allow sequencing of long DNAs or RNAs 11,12 . However, the 66 base detection differs significantly between the two methods. PacBio-sequencers rely on 67 fluorescence-based single-molecule detection that identifies bases based on the unique fluorescent 68 signal of each nucleotide during DNA synthesis by a dedicated polymerase 11 . In contrast, in an ONT 69 sequencer, the DNA or RNA molecule is pushed through a membrane-bound biological pore with 70 the aid of a motor protein that is attached to the pore protein called a nanopore (Fig. 1a) . A change 71 in current is caused by the translocation of the DNA or RNA strand through this nanopore, which 72 serves as a readout signal for the sequencing process. Due to the length of the nanopore (version 73 R9.4), a stretch of approximately five bases contributes to the current signal. Notably, only ONT 74 transcriptomes 19,21-23 and to detect RNA isoforms in eukaryotes 24, 25 . However, prokaryotic 82 transcriptomes have not been characterized on the genome-wide level by native RNA-seq 83 approaches so far as prokaryotic RNAs lack a poly(A) tail which is required to capture the RNA and 84 feed it into the nanopore. 85\n\nHere, we present a native RNA sequencing study of bacterial and archaeal transcriptomes using 86 Nanopore technology. We employed an experimental workflow that includes the enzymatic 87 polyadenylation of prokaryotic RNA to make them amenable for ONT\u00b4s direct RNA sequencing kit. 88\n\nWe evaluated the accuracy and reliability of native RNA-seq in comparison to published Illumina-89 based sequencing studying prokaryotic transcriptomes of bacterial (E. coli) and archaeal 90 (Haloferax volcanii, Pyrococcus furiosus) model organisms [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . The transcriptomic analysis 91 included determination of transcript boundaries, providing, among others, insights into 92 termination mechanisms in archaea. We moreover demonstrate that the long RNA reads gathered 93 on the ONT platform allow reliable transcriptional unit assignment. Strikingly, we gained insights 94 into the so far poorly understood ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation pathway in archaea and 95 detected putative new rRNA processing intermediates. As RNA modifications are retained when 96 sequencing native RNAs, we explore rRNA modifications in prokaryotes. Notably, by expanding 97\n\nAs some bioinformatic tools depend on single-read files we first converted multi-read FAST5 files 185 from the MinKNOW output to single-read FAST5 files using the ont_fast5_api from Oxford 186 Nanopore (https://github.com/nanoporetech/ont_fast5_api). To prevent actual good-quality 187 reads from being discarded (this issue was reported previously 13,37 ), we included both failed and 188 passed read folders in the following steps of the analysis. Demultiplexing was done by poreplex 189 (version 0.4, https://github.com/hyeshik/poreplex) with the arguments --trim-adapter, --190 symlink-fast5, --basecall and --barcoding, to trim off adapter sequences in output FASTQ files, 191 basecall using albacore, create symbolic links to FAST5 files and sort the reads according to their 192 barcodes. However, to ensure consistency between non-multiplexed and multiplexed samples and 193 because of some major improvements in the current basecalling software (guppy), albacore files 194\n\nwere not used. Instead demultiplexed FAST5 reads and raw FAST5 reads from non-multiplexed 195 runs were locally basecalled using Guppy (Version 3.0.3) with --reverse_sequence, --hp_correct, --196 enable_trimming and --calib_detect turned on. After that, relevant information from the 197 sequencing_summary.txt file in the Guppy output was extracted to analyse properties of raw reads 198 (see Supplementary Fig. 2 39 and Pyrococcus furiosus 203 DSM3638 31 using minimap2 (Release 2.17-r941, https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) 40 . Output 204 alignments in the SAM format were generated with the recommended options for noisy Nanopore 205\n\nDirect RNA-seq (-ax splice, -uf, -k14) and also with (1) -p set to 0.99, to return primary and 206 secondary mappings and (2) with --MD turned on, to include the MD tag for calculating mapping 207 identities. Alignment files were further converted to bam files, sorted and indexed using 208 SAMtools 41 . Strand-specific wig and bigwig files were finally created using bam2wig (Version 1.5, 209 https://github.com/MikeAxtell/bam2wig). To evaluate the alignments, we first calculated the 210 aligned read length by adding the number of M and I characters in the CIGAR string 13 The definition of transcriptional units (TU) and our strategy to detect and annotate them was 232 based on a recent study that re-defined the bioinformatical search for transcriptional units (TU) 29 . 233\n\nThe TU annotation was performed in a two-step process in the following way: First, TU clusters 234 were defined by collapsing all reads that overlap and fulfill certain criteria that are commented on 235 extensively in the available code for this study 236 (https://github.com/felixgrunberger/Native_RNAseq_Microbes). In short, reads were filtered out 237 that did not align protein-coding genes (CDS) or tRNAs, had a mapping identity below 80%, were 238 spliced, were shorter than 50% of the gene body and did not cover either the 5\u00b4 or the 3\u00b4 239 untranslated region. The remaining overlapping reads were collapsed in a strand-specific manner 240 and merged. 241\n\nFinally, the collapsed reads that represent the TU cluster, were split according to the coverage drop 242 at the 3\u00b4 region of a gene. This was achieved by calculating the sequencing depth in a window of 243 20 nt upstream and downstream of the corresponding TTS and applying a deliberately low 244 the author/funder.

To address the 3\u00b4 coverage bias and the underrepresentation of reads 248 that map to the 5\u00b4end and also for the 12 missing nucleotides at the TSS in general, all reads starting 249 at least 20 nt downstream of the annotated gene start were included. To not exclude too many 250 reads, the position of TTS were predicted similarly, by also including reads that have end positions 251 starting from 20 nt upstream of a gene end (TSS table in Supplementary Table 3, TTS table in  252   Supplementary Table 4) . 253\n\nFor the analysis of prokaryotic promoter elements, the sequences from 58 bases to 11 bases 254 upstream of all uncorrected TSS that are starting a TU were extracted, to identify relevant motifs 255 using MEME with default options except for a custom background file, calculated from intergenic 256 sequences of the respective organism 45 . The analysis of terminator sequences was performed 257 comparably by extracting all TTS that are located at the end of a TU and searching for terminators 258 in a sequence window from -45 to +45 from the TTS using MEME and the custom background 259 model. Heatmap analysis of motif positioning was performed by importing MEME FASTA 260 information into R. Metaplots of the nucleotide enrichment analysis (compare 26,46 ) were calculated 261 by comparing the genomic sequences surrounding a TTS in a window from -45 to 45 to randomly 262 selected intergenic positions (subsampled, n = 10000). 263\n\nThe performance of two different approaches (Tombo vs. error and basecalling properties) for the 265 detection of modified bases was evaluated: 266\n\n(1) We used Tombo (Version 1.5, https://nanoporetech.github.io/tombo) to identify modified 267 bases based on a comparison to a theoretical distribution (de novo model) and based on the 268 comparison to a reference data set (sample-compare model) 47 . Briefly, for Fig. 6a reads mapping 269 to 16S rRNA were preprocessed, resquiggled and the raw signal plotted at a specific genomic 270 coordinate using the respective plotting command (tombo plot genome_locations). In addition, the 271 probability of modified bases was calculated using the detect_modification de_novo command. For 272 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.18.880849 doi: bioRxiv preprint created by sorting the reads mapping to the 16S rRNA based on the position of the read start 275 (before or after gene start), thereby dividing the data set in reads that belong to mature and 276 unprocessed 16S rRNAs. The two read sets were used as input for the sample-compare method. 277\n\nThe two different models (de novo and sample-compare using non-mature 16S reads as a reference 278 set) were applied to the complete 16S, base-modification-probabilities extracted from the tombo 279 output and plotted using a custom R script. 280\n\n(2) For calculating the frequency of correct, deleted and wrong nucleotides at a genomic position 281 the function pileup from the Rsamtools package was used (https://rdrr.io/bioc/Rsamtools/). 282\n\nPlots were generated using custom R scripts. The results were compared to known modification 283 sites in 16S rRNA for Escherichia coli 48 and also compared to the ONT reference data. 318 the author/funder. All rights reserved.

The key steps of the library preparation are shown in Fig. 1a : after 323 enzymatic polyadenylation, the RNA is reverse transcribed to increase sequencing throughput 324 (recommended by ONT) 16 . Subsequently, a motor protein is added that feeds the RNA into the 325 Nanopore. Following this workflow, native RNAs from prokaryotic organisms can be sequenced. 326\n\nDepending on the necessary sequencing depth, the libraries were barcoded using poreplex 327 (https://github.com/hyeshik/poreplex), since this is not yet supported by the official kits and 328 protocols from Oxford Nanopore. To identify primary and processed sites in both mRNA and rRNA, 329\n\nwe partially digested 5\u00b4-monophosphorylated transcripts using the terminator exonuclease (TEX) 330 and compared them to non-treated samples (see Supplementary Fig. 1a ). In contrast to many 331\n\nIllumina sequencing-based approaches that make use of a specialised library preparation design 332 to tackle a well-defined question 8 , we evaluated the potential of native RNA sequencing to analyse 333 multiple transcriptomic features simultaneously including the identification of cis-regulatory 334 elements that govern transcription, the analysis of operon structures and transcriptional 335 boundaries, rRNA processing and 16S rRNA modification patterns (see Supplementary Fig. 1b Table 1 ). Due to large differences in the composition 357 of the RNAs used to train the basecaller and the sequenced reads, that contain mostly ribosomal 358\n\nRNAs known to harbor base modifications, the overall quality is lower than for the spike-in control 359 in every data set 54 . To prevent useful reads from being discarded, we decided to also include reads 360 that fall below the standard quality score threshold of 7 and continued with the mapping of the 361 reads to the reference genomes 13 . 362 363\n\nAn advantage of the long-read Nanopore sequencing technique is that native RNA strands can be 365 sequenced directly as near full-length transcripts 55 . This is also reflected in the sequenced data 366 sets as aligned lengths up to 7864 nt can be observed (see H. volcanii NOTEX sample with a median 367 read length of 1390 nt, Supplementary Fig. 3c ). The majority of reads from E. coli and H. volcanii 368 samples mapped to the 23S rRNA (Fig. 1b , see Supplementary Fig. 3a ). In general, the read identity 369 of CDS-mapping reads is higher than for rRNA mapping reads, but lower than the spike-in control 370 (see Supplementary Fig. 3b,c) . It is noteworthy, that a minimum aligned length of about 100 nt 371 appears in the data sets (see Supplementary Fig. 3d ) when using the native RNA sequencing 372 protocol and minimap2 as mapping tool 16,40,56 . Unaligned reads had a median read length of 191 373 nt, in contrast to 572 nt for aligned reads (all data sets combined) suggesting that short reads could 374 not be aligned properly. As small RNAs, CRIPSR-RNAs or tRNAs fall below this threshold, we 375 the author/funder. All rights reserved.

While short transcripts are a problem, longer RNAs are 376 sequenced without loss in quality (see Supplementary Fig. 3e ). As the raw read quality correlates 377 with the mapping identity of the reads, problems during sequencing can be live-monitored in 378\n\nMinKNOW and the run can be canceled allowing the loading of a new library (see Supplementary 379 Nanopore native RNA-seq data must be corrected by 12 nucleotides (Fig. 2b ). It has been observed 405 previously that about 12 nt are missing at the 5'-end of the sequenced RNAs. This observation can 406 be explained by a lack of control of the RNA translocation speed after the motor protein falls off 407 the 5\u00b4 end of the RNA (see Supplementary Figure 6a ) 56,57 . Promoter analysis confirmed the 408 presence of well-known sequence motifs of bacterial and archaeal promoters 27,31,58 . This includes 409 the TATA-box and B-recognition element (BRE) characteristic for archaeal promoters and the -10 410 element in bacterial promoters (Fig. 2d) . The -35 element in E. coli has been previously shown to 411 be less enriched compared to the -10 site 5 , which might explain why this element cannot be 412 detected in the Nanopore data set. To analyse TSSs in more detail, we compared the 5\u00b4 UTR lengths 413 for all genes with predicted TSS in ONT and Illumina data sets (see Supplementary Figure 6b ,c,d). 414\n\nThe overall correlation between the two techniques was very high (see Supplementary Fig. 6 ). As 415 expected, the correlation improves with increasing sequencing depth for a gene (>5 reads). While 416 TEX-treatment is a common way of predicting TSS in Illumina sequencing, we observed that it is 417 not necessary for ONT data as very similar TSS are found in both TEX and NOTEX data sets (\u03c1 = 418 0.86) (see Supplementary Figure 6e ). 419 420 Transcription termination sites 421 Native RNA reads are sequenced in the 3\u00b4 to 5\u00b4 direction, which is a major advantage in the 422 detection of termination sites as any bias introduced after polyadenylation can be excluded. 423\n\nCurrently, no reference data sets for the archaeal organisms were available, the distribution of 3\u00b4 424 untranslated regions (3\u00b4UTRs) in E. coli ONT data closely resembles the data from a previous Term-425 seq study 26 . Untranslated regions at the 3\u00b4end of an annotated transcript are longer and more 426 uniformly distributed in E. coli than in the two archaeal species (Fig. 2c) As observed for E. coli termination sequences, Cytosines are enriched over Guanosine adjacent to 451 the TTS in P. furiosus (Fig. 2e) . Termination motifs detected in the E. coli data set cover both 452 intrinsic (poly(U)) and Rho-dependent termination signatures (see Supplementary Fig. 7a ,b) 26 . We 453 classified the stem-loop forming motif as Rho-dependent signatures, as these were not enriched in 454 the poly(U) terminated genes. However, the stem-loops could potentially also represent 455 processing or pause sites. 456 457\n\nLong-read sequencing of native full-length RNAs has the potential to improve and facilitate 459 genome-wide transcriptional unit (TU) annotation, which can be visually explored in a genome 460 browser coverage track (Fig. 3a) . For whole-genome analysis, the annotation strategy was based 461 on two major observations: First, during RNA preparation, RNA processing or degradation can 462 the author/funder.

Secondly, 464\n\nwe detected a decrease in coverage from the 3\u00b4 to 5\u00b4end of the RNA in all RNA classes except for 465 the spike-in control (see Supplementary Fig. 9b ), which is a limitation reported in the 466 literature 13,60,61 . Therefore, we assume that not Nanopore sequencing but library preparation 467 causes this problem. Based on this information, we developed a strategy that first collapses all 468 overlapping reads and then splits them according to a significant coverage drop on the 3\u00b4 ends 469 (annotation of TUs based on this strategy in Supplementary Table 5) . We compared the results to 470 database annotations and found that most of the differences are either caused by the low 471 sequencing depth or by single-unit operons that have been collapsed and are now two-unit 472 operons in the ONT data sets (see Supplementary Fig. 10a,b) 29,50 . Even though limited read 473 availability is a concern in all data sets, many large operons were detected for all organisms (see 474 Supplementary Fig. 10c ). In case of limited bioinformatical resources, TUs can be explored visually 475 in a genome browser, which is mostly not possible for Illumina reads (Fig. 3 , see Supplementary 476 Fig. 11,12) . It further allows a quantitative analysis of individual transcripts in relation to other 477 elements of the TU and performs much better than pure bioinformatical prediction or molecular 478 biology methods (RT-PCR) as shown for the archaellum operon in P. furiosus (Fig. 3) seq data, the analysis shows that this operon is split into two transcription units. This shows that 484 the ONT native RNA sequencing method provides the opportunity to correctly annotate 485 transcriptional units thereby outperforming the bioinformatics-only prediction as well as the 486 visual inspection of Illumina coverage (see Supplementary Fig. 11) . Besides, we confirmed the 487 complex transcription pattern of the major ribosomal protein gene cluster in E. coli that stretches 488 over more than 10 kB, including the accurate determination of TSS and TTS and a putative cleavage 489 site in the secY gene (see Supplementary Fig. 12) 63 . 490 the author/funder.

We first focus on the E. coli data set as the processing 493 of bacterial rRNAs is well characterized 64-66 . Ribosomal RNA in E. coli is transcribed from 7 494 independent rDNA operons, containing the mature rRNAs (16S, 23S and 5S rRNAs) and some 495 tRNAs which are intersped by RNA spacers elements 67 . In agreement with a previous study, 496 transcription of rrnC from two promoters (transcription start sites at -293 and -175) was detected 497 accurately (Fig. 4a,b) 68 . 498\n\nThe rRNA maturation process, which requires the action of well-defined ribonuclease activities, 499 culminates by the formation of stoichiometric amounts of mature 16S, 23S, and 5S rRNAs 64-66 . 500\n\nUnexpectedly, the sequencing efficiency of mature 16S rRNA was lower than the 23S rRNA (Fig.  501 4a). Moreover, although we could properly detect RNA of similar size or longer (see above), the 502 short-lived full rDNA operon transcript detected in RNase III deficient strain 69 , is not observed 503 using our experimental set-up. In contrast, the downstream pre-rRNAs which are generated by the 504 action of RNAse III were detected (Fig.4) . Among these intermediates, the 17S pre-rRNA with 115 505 additional nt at the 5\u00b4 end and 33 nt at the 3\u00b4 end of the 16S rRNA, was identified (Fig. 4b) . 506\n\nAdditional 16S rRNA processing sites (RNase E: -66, RNase G: 0 5\u00b4mature) are also detected ( Fig.  507   4 b,c) . Recent studies were suggesting that the 3\u00b4end of the mature 16S rRNA is generated by 3\u00b4-5\u00b4 508 ribonucleases activity and/or endonucleolytic cleavage 70,71 . In addition to the mature 16S rRNA 509 3\u00b4end, we could observe reads of decreasing length spanning from +33 nt (RNaseIII) to 0 (related 510 to 16S rRNA 3\u00b4end), that could account for 3\u00b4-5\u00b4 exonuclease processing activity (or degradation 511 during sample preparation). Together we could accurately identify all the known processing sites 512 at nucleotide resolution in wildtype E. coli. 513 514 Insights into archaeal ribosomal RNA processing 515\n\nIn comparison to bacteria or eukaryotes, ribosomal RNA processing in archaea is still poorly 516 understood 70,72-74 . Our current knowledge suggests that the primary polycistronic rRNA precursor 517 contains processing stems formed by the 5\u00b4-leader and 3\u00b4-trailer sequences surrounding the 16S 518 and 23S rRNAs 72,73,75,76 . In Euryarchaeota, the 16S and 23S rRNAs are additionally separated by the 519 the author/funder. All rights reserved.

In most archaea, the 16S and 23S rRNA processing stems contain a 520 bulge-helix-bulge motif which is, in the context of intron-containing tRNA, recognized by the 521 splicing endonuclease endA 75-77 . Similar to intron-containing tRNA maturation, processing at the 522 bulge-helix-bulge motifs results in the ligation of the resulting extremities, thereby generating the 523 archaeal specific circular pre-16S and circular pre-23S rRNAs 73,76,78,79 . The molecular mechanisms 524 by which the circular pre-rRNA intermediates are further processed into linear mature rRNA are 525 unknown 73,76 . 526\n\nBy analysing single reads, we aimed to confirm and expand our knowledge on the poorly 527 characterized multi-step ribosomal maturation process in P. furiosus and H. volcanii (Fig. 5a,b,c,  528 see Supplementary Fig. 13a,b) Supplementary Fig. 13c) . Surprisingly, 5\u00b4 and 3\u00b4end 532 positions did not precisely match the availablle annotations at NCBI 533 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/) or the archaeal genome browser (AGB, 534 http://archaea.ucsc.edu). In contrast, these mature rRNA extremities did match our independent 535 experimental validations by primer extension analysis of the 5\u00b4ends of the 16S and 23S rRNAs of 536 H. volcanii (Supplementary Fig. 15f ). In addition, the majority of the expected processing sites, 537 notably at the predicted or known bulge-helix-bulge motifs 78 , were faithfully observed in P. 538 furiosus and H. volcanii (see Supplementary Fig. 14,15) . 539\n\nDespite the high sequencing depth of the (pre-)rRNA, we did not detect a full-length precursor 540 consisting of the 16S leading-16S-tRNA-23S-23S trailing elements in P. furiosus and H. volcanii, 541 suggesting that early rRNA processing occurs rapidly in these cells. The remaining reads were 542 grouped according to their 5\u00b4 leading and 3\u00b4 trailing lengths into five additional categories that are 543 less abundant (with less than 1600 counts in each group): (1) a processing variant that entails the 544 16S rRNA leading/trailing sequence-tRNA-23S rRNA leading/trailing sequence, (2) probably 545 fragmented full-length precursor rRNAs, (3) 16S rRNA leading/trailing sequence-tRNA, (4) 16S 546 rRNA leading/trailing sequence-tRNA-23S rRNA and (5) tRNA-23S rRNA (Fig. 5 , see 547 Supplementary Fig. 13 ).

Given the number of reads, the direction of ONT sequencing from 3\u00b4 to 552 5\u00b4 and the accurate mapping, it is unlikely that the additional putative rRNA precursors (variants 553 4, 5) carrying the leading sequence in combination with 23S rRNA and tRNA-23S rRNA are all 554 arising from experimental artifact (Fig. 5a,b) (see also Discussion). This processing variation could 555 have been overlooked in the past in the analysed archaea, as these are only minor fractions of the 556 transcripts present in the cell or are specific to P. furiosus. Shortened 23S rRNA reads (variants 4, 557 5) and the overall visible 3\u00b4 to 5\u00b4 coverage drop can most likely be explained by fragmentation and 558 degradation during library preparation, secondary structures that prevent efficient loading into 559 the nanopore or truncation of RNA reads caused by physical artifacts that have been described 560 before and include problems during RNA translocation or disruptions of the ionic current 561 signal 13,52,56 . Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that non-mature reads are categorized as 562 fragmented reads and will be assigned as mature 16S or 23S rRNA. 563\n\nHighly enriched positions that differ from the annotation of the mature rRNAs and cannot be 564 assigned to a processing site may represent a wrong annotation of the rRNA locus or currently 565 unknown processing sites in the two archaeal species 31,39 . To provide further examples that show 566 the potential to describe maturation and processing events for prokaryotic rRNA, we sequenced 567 an H. volcanii wildtype strain grown under low salt conditions (see Supplementary Fig. 15b,c) 28 . 568\n\nUnder these conditions, a 16S rRNA precursor with an extended 5\u00b4UTR (position -121 -5\u00b4bulge) 569 appears that is only enriched in this condition. Quantification by comparison with the NOTEX 570 wildtype set confirms the previous detection of this rRNA variant in a gel-electrophoretic analysis 571 of the rRNA (see Supplementary Fig. 15b) 28 . 572 573\n\nMore than 160 types of modified bases have been described in RNAs so far 48 . In contrast to other 575 sequencing techniques, Nanopore-based sequencing offers the possibility to detect base 576 modifications directly, as these modifications lead to an electric current signal that differs from the 577 expected theoretical distribution obtained by the unmodified nucleotides sequence 14,15,20,81 .

Mapping to single-584 nucleotide resolution is difficult as more than one base contributes to the actual electric current 585 signal in the nanopore 83 . In the next step, a comparison of a wildtype sample to a deletion mutant 586 of KsgA confirmed the absence of the dimethylation in the deletion strain and confirmed that the 587 m 6 2A modifications and not the homopolymer-G-stretch are responsible for the altered current 588 signal (Fig. 6b) . The analysis further revealed a reduced signal variability at non-modified 589 positions between the two samples in comparison to the theoretical distribution, which leads to 590 less false positives in the statistical analysis. As the de novo model has a higher error rate 591 compared to the sample-compare model, we generated two read sets by sorting full-length 16S 592 rRNA transcripts according to their 5\u00b4 leading length to mature (n: 2744) and pre-rRNAs (n: 102) 593 in the Haloferax wildtype data set (Fig. 6c) . The calculated base modification probabilities and 594 electric current signal distributions for this model are very similar to the wildtype/\u2206ksgA set, 595\n\nindicating that the two m 6 2A modifications were not quantitatively introduced in the pre-16S-596 rRNA reads (Fig. 6d) . This finding is in line with a proposed \"quality control\" function of KsgA 597 during late biogenesis of the small ribosomal subunit 84-86 and further highlights the potential to 598 detect the introduction of base modifications at a different stage of rRNA maturation. 599\n\nNext, we applied the described de novo and sample-compare model to the full 16S rRNA of all three 600 organisms and compared the results to positions known from literature 48,49 . Applying a probability 601 threshold of 0.5, we found that 60% (de novo) and 1.89% (sample-compare, 28 bases) of the bases 602 in the 16S rRNA are modified in H. volcanii (Fig. 6e) , which emphasizes the better performance of 603 the sample-compare model by the vastly reduced number of false-positivly detected RNA 604 modifications. 10 of the 28 predicted bases (please note that approximately five bases contribute 605 to the signal in the nanopore and that a base single modification therefore influences the current 606 signal at the surrounding bases as well) can be assigned to known base modifications at positions 607 910, 1430 and 1450/1451 49 . Using the same threshold for E. coli (de novo: 50.5%, sample-compare: 608 the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Moreover, these data support the long-standing 610 hypothesis that hyperthermophilic organisms might stabilize their rRNAs by a higher degree of 611 RNA modifications 87,88 . 612\n\nIt is noteworthy that the predicted large number of modifications lead to a loss in read quality. This 613 is for example seen when analysing the Pyrococcus data set, as the quality score is also based on 614 the comparison of detected to theoretical read signal (compare Supplementary Fig. 3c) . To look at 615 this observation in more detail, we compared the results from the raw squiggle Tombo approach 616 that is not dependent on mapping of the reads to the mapping properties of the reads. This 617 methodology is based on an approach that was recently used to identify m 6 A RNA modifications 618 from native RNA reads with an accuracy of ~90% 14 . After mapping, the frequency for the 619 respective nucleotide at every position in the 16S rRNA to be correct, wrong or deleted was 620 calculated. Homopolymer stretches in the RNA increase the likelihood that the correct number of 621 nucleotides is not correctly identified and this, in turn, leads to an increased number of deleted 622 nucleotides, which is also visible in the Haloferax data sets at the G-stretch adjacent to the m 6 2A 623 modifications ( Supplementary Fig, 16a,b) . The overall frequency of wrongly assigned and deleted 624 nucleotides was much higher in P. furiosus (16.4%) than in E. coli (10.7%) and H. volcanii (10.4%) 625 ( Supplementary Fig. 16c ). Interrogating the full-length 16S rRNA, we found that miscalled 626 positions are equally distributed among the whole transcript ( Supplementary Fig. 16d ,e,f). 627\n\nStatistical analysis of miscall-frequencies revealed a significant difference between already known 628 modification sites and non-modified positions in Haloferax and Escherichia suggesting that even a 629 very simple model can detect RNA base modifications when wrongly assigned bases considered. 630\n\nThe situation is different for Pyrococcus: Native Nanopore data suggest that the rRNA is heavily 631 modified. However, the number, exact positions and chemical identity of these modifications are 632 currently unknown. Hence, an analysis of how often base modifications lead to wrongly identified 633 nucleotides in the 16S rRNA sequence cannot be performed ( Supplementary Fig. 16c,g) . 634 635 636 the author/funder.

Here, we will mostly discuss new biological insights that 640 emerged from our study. Additionally, we will reflect on the advantages and disadvantages of 641 Nanopore native RNA-seq. 642\n\nBacterial and archaeal transcription is an intensely studied molecular process and the mechanisms 644 of basal transcription are well understood 89 . Native RNA sequencing allowed us to retrieve 645 accurate information of transcript boundaries on both 5\u00b4 and 3\u00b4 ends. Our data show that 3' UTRs 646 length distributions are comparable between E. coli, P. furiosus and H. volcanii with the majority of 647 mRNAs showing a length between 30 -70 nt. Similar to bacteria, archaea encode large numbers of 648 small non-coding RNAs 90 . However, many regulatory events that involve the regulation via small 649\n\nRNAs take place at bacterial 5' UTRs 91 . We and others found that 5' UTRs are significantly shorter 650 in archaea supporting the idea that post-transcriptional regulation is mediated via the 3' rather 651 than the 5' UTR in archaea 92 . Additionally, we determined transcription termination sites, which 652 are well analysed for bacterial species but only a few studies focused on archaeal termination 653 mechanisms, especially on the genome-wide level. In both archaeal species, poly(U) stretches were 654 overrepresented at termination sites agreeing well with termination sequences found in Sulfolobus 655 and Methanosarcina 46 . Interestingly, the majority of TTS found in Pyrococcus transcripts is 656 composed of two U-stretches with at least five consecutive uridine bases while a subclass of 657\n\nHaloferax transcripts is almost exclusively terminated by a single U-stretch with four uridine 658 bases. It has been shown that a five base U-stretch is sufficient to induce termination in vitro 59,93,94 . 659\n\nSimilar observations were described in a recent study by Berkemer et al, which identified a 660 poly(U)4 stretch to be the termination signal in intergenic regions 95 . However, the current data set 661 suggests that this short termination signal might be a specific feature for a subclass of Haloferax 662 transcripts resembling the poly(U) termination motif found in E. coli. All other archaeal organisms 663 (P. furiosus, M. mazei, S. acidocaldarius) investigated so far terminate transcription at multiple 664 the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Possibly, Haloferax relies on additional termination signals or yet 665 unknown termination factors. A putative candidate is archaeal CPSF1 (aCPSF1), a recently 666 described archaeal termination factor 96 that is widespread in archaea. aCPSF1 acts as ribonuclease 667 that cleaves transcripts after a poly(U) stretch to trim transcripts and facilitates transcription 668 termination in Methanococcus maripaludis. The arising 3' UTR isoforms were detected using Term-669 seq analysis 96 . We also observed heterogeneity in the case of the Pilin and Alba transcripts, 670 respectively, that are distinguished by varying lengths of the 3' UTR suggesting that aCPSF1 might 671 trim a subset of genes in H. volcanii and P. furiosus. It is noteworthy that 3' UTR isoforms were also 672 detected in Term-seq studies with Sulfolobus and Methanosarcina 46 . However, in contrast to the 673 Pilin and Alba transcripts, the 3' UTR isoforms arise from termination at different sites of a single 674 continues poly(U) stretch suggesting that the isoforms arise from a stochastic termination process 675 of the RNA polymerases at an extended poly(U) stretch at the end of the gene. Taken together, 676 these data demonstrate that a variety of termination mechanisms (that can even co-occur in the 677 same cell) can be found in archaea ranging from stochastic intrinsic termination at extended 678 poly(U) stretches (Pyrococcus, Sulfolobus, Methanosarcina), to abrupt termination at short uridine 679 tracts (H. volcanii) and factor-dependent termination that results in trimming of the 3'UTR (H. 680\n\nIn the context of transcription, the long and overlapping native RNA reads helped us to analyse the 682 transcriptional landscape at multigene operons. More specifically, we focused on the archaellum 683 operon as the transcription unit assignment remained ambiguous so far 62 . In contrast to 684 bioinformatical and Illumina RNA-seq-based predictions and attempts to unravel the TU via 685\n\nprimer extension experiments, we found that the archaellum operon in P. furiosus is transcribed 686 in multiple units with highly diverse abundances. The flaB0 gene encodes the major flagellin 687 protein that forms the filament of the archaellum and therefore, the organism has to produce this 688 protein in large quantities as apparent from the expression level 62 . Interestingly, FlaD is expressed 689 at comparably high levels as well as supporting the idea that FlaD is a major constituent of the 690 archaellum in P. furiosus. It has been speculated that FlaD forms the cytosolic ring of the archaellum 691 that anchors the filament in the outer membrane 97 . The identity and functional role of FlaD are, 692 however, not known so far. 693 the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Ribosomal RNA maturation proceeds via 697 the coordinated and defined order of ribonucleases action (exonucleolytic and/or endonucleolytic 698 cleavages) which generate pre-rRNA intermediates with defined premature rRNA 699 sequences 66,74,98,99 . The establishment of faithfull rRNA maturation maps in model organisms, like 700 E. coli, S. cerevisiae or human cell culture has required numerous analyses over the past decades 701 66,74,98,99 , and remains a technical challenge. Therefore, methodologies that might accelerate the 702 systematic analysis of rRNA maturation pathways across the tree of life, thereby enabling to 703 unravel the diversity of rRNA maturation strategies need to be established. Beyond the 704 identification of processing sites, the order of the processing events which can be, in part, deduced 705 from co-occurrence analysis of the 5\u00b4and 3\u00b4extremities is of biological relevance 66,74,98,99 . Whereas 706 we could confirm and extend our general view on the rRNA maturation pathway in archaea, the 707 3\u00b4-5\u00b4 processivity of Nanopore native RNA sequencing observed for rRNA impedes the accurate 708 analysis of pre-rRNA extremities co-segregation (see Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 9b) .
