{"title": "Realtime 2-5A kinetics suggests interferons \u03b2 and \uf06c evade global arrest of translation by RNase L", "body": "Interferons IFNs of type I (\uf061 and \u03b2) and type III (\uf06c1, \uf06c2 and \uf06c3) are cytokines secreted by cells after exposure to pathogens or internal damage. Both types of IFNs activate strong transcriptional programs in surrounding tissues and have a central role in the innate immune system. Production of the IFNs requires protein synthesis.\n\nHowever, during innate immune response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), IFN production is universally accompanied by translational arrest. Inhibition of protein synthesis arises in part due to activation of the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), and in part due to signaling by conserved small RNAs that contain 2',5'-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) 1-4 . The action of 2-5A is sufficient for arrest of translation, independent of PKR, and at least in some cell lines 2-5A is the main cause of translational arrest 5 . In human cells, 2-5A is synthesized by three enzymes: oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), OAS2 and OAS3 (OASs), which function as cytosolic dsRNA sensors using dsRNA binding for activation 6, 7 . The activity of the OASs is normally low to allow housekeeping protein synthesis, but it increases in the presence of viral or host dsRNA molecules 8 . 2-5A has a strong antiviral effect, against which many viruses have evolved 2-5A antagonist genes that are essential for infection 9-16 . proteins and stops lactation, presumably as a mechanism to prevent passing infection via breast feeding 19 .\n\nAll of the effects of 2-5A arise from the action of a single mammalian 2-5A receptor, pseudokinase-endoribonuclease L (RNase L) 20 . 2-5A binds to the ankyrinrepeat (ANK) domain of RNase L and promotes its oligomerization and formation of a dimeric endoribonuclease active site [21] [22] [23] . This dimer further assembles into high-order oligomers 24 that cleave viral RNAs 16, 18 and all components of the translation apparatus, including mRNAs 25 , tRNAs 26 and 28S/18S rRNAs 27, 28 . The resulting action of RNase L inhibits global translation, which puts all proteins, including IFNs, at risk of arrest during a cellular response to dsRNA. The impact of translational shutdown by RNase L on IFN synthesis and paracrine IFN signaling is unknown. Measurements of 2-5A/RNase L activity have been limited by the need for biochemical analysis, which are incompatible with live cells. To address this challenge, we developed a realtime 2-5A biosensor and used it to elucidate the kinetics of 2-5A-mediated RNase L activation and translational arrest taking place during the cellular response to immuno-stimulatory dsRNAs. Our biosensor can detect in situ 2-5A synthesis in mammalian cells and thereby it establishes a heretofore missing platform for cell-based applications. These applications can range from live cell screens for modulators of innate immune responses to mechanistic analysis of dsRNA sensing, which we describe in our present work.\n\nRealtime 2-5A dynamics in live cells .

It . https://doi.org /10.1101/476341 doi: bioRxiv preprint In the absence of methods to monitor 2-5A without cell disruption, the cellular dynamics of this second messenger are poorly understood. Here we developed a biosensor for continuous and non-invasive 2-5A monitoring in live cells. The biosensor was designed based on the crystal structures of the cellular 2-5A receptor RNase L 22, 24 ( Fig. 1A) , which indicate that the N-terminal ANK domain of RNase L is sufficient for 2-5A sensing and provides a minimal dimerization module 24 . In a single ANK protomer, the N-and C-termini in cis are separated, but upon dimerization of two ANK domains, which bind notably head-to-tail, the C-/N-termini become positioned in trans next to each other (Fig. 1B) . We employed this in cis vs in trans N-/C-distance decrease to drive a dual-split-luciferase sensor.\n\nThe combinatorially optimized sensor has two halves, which consist of the core ANK domain fused to a modified split firefly luciferase (Fluc) 29 (Fig. 1B) . We modified Fluc by replacing the published overlapping split junction N416/C415 with a nonoverlapping junction ( Fig. 2A) . Due to the head-to-tail structure, the sensor was encoded as one polypeptide, which simplified its use compared to usual two-protein split systems. We optimized the reporter by engineering the linker regions and selected variant V6 with the highest luminescence response to 2-5A for further work ( Fig. 2A) .\n\nWe determined that V6 was suitable for 2-5A detection over a range of 2-5A and V6 concentrations from ~ 10 nM to at least 1 \u03bcM (V6) and 3 \u03bcM (2-5A) ( Fig. 2B-C) . This luminescence response was specific and abolished by a control mutation Y312A, which removed the key 2-5A-sensing tyrosine 24 (Fig. 2B-C) . The reporter V6 had sufficient sensitivity to detect low amounts of 2-5A purified from human cells treated with poly-Inosine/poly-Cytidine (poly-IC) dsRNA (Fig. S1A ). These reporter measurements closely agreed with the standard endoribonuclease readout based on RNA cleavage (Fig. S1B ).\n\nTo determine whether V6 was sufficiently bright and stable in live cells, we expressed FLAG-tagged V6 in HeLa cells and stimulated these reporter cells with poly-IC. Poly-IC treatment conditions were selected to produce cleavage of 28S rRNA in the conventional end-point assay using cell disruption 22 . 28S rRNA cleavage was noticeable after one hour of poly-IC treatment and further increased after three and four hours ( Further evidence for specific 2-5A detection was obtained in cells with 2-5A synthetases knocked out. It has been shown that knockout of OAS3 is sufficient to inhibit 2-5A synthesis in human cells 11 . We found that biosensor exhibited a robust response to poly-IC in OAS1-KO and OAS2-KO cells. In contrast, the response was lost in OAS3-KO cells ( fig. S2 ), providing a confirmation that 2-5A synthesis gave rise to the reporter activity. RNase L may be activated by local production of 2-5A 30 , at secrete sites inside cells (the cytosol). Notably, OASs are present not only in the cytosol, but also in the nucleus [31] [32] [33] , which further supports that 2-5A accumulation could be nonuniform with subcellular spaces. The availability of live cell 2-5A sensor offers an opportunity to evaluate 2-5A accumulation in individual cellular compartments in situ.\n\nToward this end, we engineered tagged versions of V6 with nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES). Both variants localized to the expected sites ( Fig. 3C ). In the presence of poly-IC, NLS-V6 and NES-V6 produced nearly identical luminescence profiles, which are similar to the trace obtained with untagged V6 (Fig.   3D ). This similarity is most simply reconciled with a model of rapid 2-5A equilibration between the two compartments due to diffusion. Indeed, 2-5A produced at the center of a HeLa cell, may take only several seconds to diffuse across the nucleus, through the nuclear pores, and to become evenly distributed between the nucleus and the cytosol ( Fig. 3E ). Our measurements did not support localized 2-5A action and indicated that 2-5A was poised to establish communication between the OASs and RNase L across the cell.\n\nTranslational arrest by 2-5A precedes the IFN response\n\nThe pathways of 2-5A and IFNs are closely interconnected. IFNs stimulate 2-5A production by transcriptionally inducing the OASs 3,34,35 . Conversely, 2-5A can amplify 36 and suppress 37 IFN-\u03b2 protein production. Considering that RNase L stops translation and ultimately causes apoptosis 38 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/476341 doi: bioRxiv preprint contrast, transcription of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) measured by qPCR of OAS1/2/3/L and the helicases RIG-I and MDA5, developed with a lag of 2-4 hours and became strong after maximal 2-5A production (Fig. 4, A and B) . Rapid 2-5A synthesis before the IFN response was confirmed by cleavage of 28S rRNA in A549 cells (Fig.   4C ), and in HeLa cells using a combination of biosensor and qPCR readouts ( fig. S4 ).\n\nThese observations suggest that 2-5A production may precede the IFN response and that 2-5A is supplied by basal rather than IFN-induced OASs. Therefore, 2-5A/OAS activation does not require IFN stimulation, as reported 39 . Similarly, basal OASs are solely responsible for protection of mouse myeloid cells from murine coronavirus 40 . We also found that the OAS/RNase L activation was not inhibited by pre-treatment with a To determine whether cellular 2-5A dynamics corresponds to a rapid arrest of translation by RNase L, we measured nascent protein synthesis by puromycin pulse labeling in WT and RNase L -/-A549 cells 5 . Treatment of WT, but not RNase L -/cells with poly-IC halted global translation before ISG induction ( Fig. 4F and 4B ). RNase L -/cells exhibited a delayed and incomplete translational attenuation, presumably due to PKR. Translational arrest ahead of ISG induction was also present in HeLa cells (Fig.   S4 , B and C). Disengagement of basal protein synthesis before the IFN response was further confirmed using metabolic labeling of nascent proteome with 35 S (Fig. 4G) .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/476341 doi: bioRxiv preprint IFNs \u03b2 and \uf06c escape the translational shutoff caused by 2-5A 2-5A rapidly stops cell-wide protein synthesis. To examine IFN protein production under these conditions, we treated WT and RNase L -/cells with poly-IC and assayed the media for IFN activity (Fig. 5A) . These tests revealed a time-dependent increase of media antiviral activity and media ability to induce ISGs, which developed after RNase L-mediated translational arrest (Fig. 5B, and fig. S8 ). At time points well beyond translational arrest, we observed an increase in antiviral activity (Fig. 5C ) and ISG induction by two orders of magnitude from media of poly I:C-treated WT and RNase L -/cells (Fig. 5D ). In agreement with the ISG induction readout, media from WT and RNase L -/cells exhibited comparable antiviral activity and similar time-dependent increase of IFN potency (Fig. S9) . These data suggest that shutdown of bulk translation by RNase L thus does not inhibit IFN production.\n\nTo test whether IFN arises from actively ongoing translation rather than from other potential mechanisms (e.g. delayed secretion of pre-translated IFN stores), we used pulse-treatment with a translation inhibitor, anisomycin (Fig. 5E ). In this setting, cells were first treated with poly-IC for three hours, which stopped protein synthesis but did not yet activate a strong transcriptional IFN response. Next, anisomycin was added to arrest all protein synthesis and the cells were kept for three additional hours. Control cells were kept for the same duration without anisomycin. During the last hour, media was changed to remove poly-IC, but anisomycin treatment was continued to keep the cells translationally arrested. When IFN activity in the media was assayed, we found The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/476341 doi: bioRxiv preprint S8C), but before the IFN response, blocked IFN production (Fig. 5E) . A control experiment showed that anisomycin was compatible with IFN sensing by na\u00efve cells (Fig. 5F ). Of note, anisomycin had a mild stimulatory effect on ISG mRNAs due to an unknown mechanism; this effect acted in the opposite direction from blocking IFNs and thus did not affect the suitability of anisomycin as a control in our tests. Together, our experiments indicated that IFNs are indeed translated when the bulk of protein synthesis remains silenced by 2-5A.\n\nA549 cells treated with poly-IC express both type I and type III interferons ( Fig.   6A ). To determine which of these IFNs escape RNase L in our experiments, we employed hamster CHO reporter cell lines developed previously for specific detection of human IFNs of type I and type III. Hamster cells do not respond to human IFNs, however the reporter cells are rendered sensitive via expression of chimeric type I and type III human IFN receptors fused to a potent STAT1 docking domain 41, 42 . The reporter cells analysis, based on readout of phospho-STAT, indicates the presence of type I and type III IFNs, exhibiting strongest p-STAT response to IFNs-\uf06c ( Fig. 6B and fig. S10 ).\n\nWe have developed a biosensor for 2-5A and determined that this second messenger is synthesized without a delay and mediates immediate dsRNA sensing. 2-5A activates RNase L, which suppresses protein synthesis 43 . This mechanism is potent and attenuates basal cell-wide translation by more than 1,000-fold ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/476341 doi: bioRxiv preprint production and secretion of IFNs \u03b2 and \uf06c (Fig. 6C ). Our work thus kinetically separates RNA cleavage and translational shutoff by RNase L from interferon-mediated cellular reprogramming, revealing an unanticipated order of signaling events where basal translation is shut down first and the IFN response develops second.\n\nThe action of RNase L resembles arrest of the initiation step, which can be accompanied by a characteristic collapse of polysomes 25 . A similar polysomal collapse is observed upon activation of integrated stress response (ISR) that employs serine/threonine kinases to phosphorylate and inactivate the translation initiation factor eIF2\uf061 44 . In the ISR, the arrest of translational initiation can be bypassed by mRNAs encoding stress proteins, such as ATF4 and IBTK\uf061 due to the presence of 5' uORFs that increase translation under conditions of limiting initiation 45 . Although it remains unclear how IFNs bypass RNase L and whether they may use a related route 46 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/476341 doi: bioRxiv preprint sense dsRNA at a distance from the site of RNase L action. The range of OAS-RNase L communication depends on efficiency of 2-5A diffusion, which occurs with rates sufficient for 2-5A equilibration between the nucleus and the cytosol faster than the rate of 2-5A production. Therefore, RNase L is poised to respond to 2-5A from cytoplasmic and nuclear OASs, suggesting that detection of dsRNA in both compartments is a likely biologic function of cytosolic RNase L.\n\nA number of clinically important translation inhibitors, such as rapalogs and a new generation of anticancer drugs based on INK128, work by reprogramming protein synthesis through inhibition of mTOR 48 . Our work for the first time describes RNase L not as a general RNA decay machine, but as a translation-reprogramming receptor.\n\nNormally, RNase L is activated as a part of the innate immune system. However, RNase L activation by small molecules could be explored for developing adjuvants and anticancer therapeutics with some of the beneficial effects of mTOR blockers, and with an added advantage of maintaining the protein synthesis activity of the innate immune system. The search for such on demand activators can be facilitated by biochemical, cell-based as well as in vivo applications of the 2-5A biosensor we describe here.

This will define how fast a non-uniform concentration of 2-5A should relax in a sphere the size of a cell. The slowest mode to relax will be the spherically symmetric one with a single peak at the cell center, and zero gradient at the cell membrane (reflecting boundary conditions). The diffusion equation with no sources or sinks is: \u2202c/\u2202t = D\u00b7\u2207 2 c, which in the case of spherical symmetry simplifies to \u2202c/\u2202t = D\u00b7(1/r 2 )\u00b7\u2202/\u2202r(r 2 \u00b7\u2202c/\u2202r). This simplifies further if we make the substitution c = u/r, and use \u2202c/\u2202r = (1/r)\u00b7\u2202u/\u2202r -(1/r 2 )\u00b7u and \u2202c/\u2202t = (1/r)\u00b7\u2202u/\u2202t, yielding (1/r)\u00b7\u2202u/\u2202t = D\u00b7[(1/r 2 )\u00b7\u2202/\u2202r(r\u00b7\u2202u/\u2202r -u)], and finally \u2202u/\u2202t = D\u00b7\u2202 2 u/\u2202r 2 . We can expand u in eigenfunctions of the right hand side, which are just sines .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/476341 doi: bioRxiv preprint and cosines, and the general solution for u(r,t) will be of the form: u(r,t) = \u03a3u k \u00b7sin(k\u00b7r)\u00b7exp(-\uf06c k \u00b7t) plus similar terms for cosines. Rather than solving for complete generality, we note that we want the slowest decaying mode for which c is finite at r=0 (eliminating cosines), and has a no-flux boundary condition at the sphere's radius R. No flux at R implies \u2202c/\u2202r = 0, which implies that \u2202u/\u2202r\u00b7(1/u) = 1/r at r = R. Therefore, k\u00b7cos(k\u00b7R)/sin(k\u00b7R) = 1/R, i.e. tan(k\u00b7R) = k\u00b7R, and we need to solve this equation to obtain k. The lowest-k solution (slowest mode of diffusion) is k\u00b7R = 4.49. After defining k* = 4.49/R, we find the corresponding relaxation rate of this mode from the diffusion equation: (-\uf06c k* )\u00b7u = -D\u00b7k* 2 \u00b7u, so that \uf06c k* = D\u00b7k* 2 .\n\nUp to this point, we have neglected contributions to the solution for u(r,t) that are zero when acted on by \u2207 2 , so we can add terms c 0 (t)\u00b7r or c 1 (t) to u(r,t), or equivalently terms c 0 (t) or c 1 (t)/r to c(r,t). Only the constant term satisfies continuity at the center of the sphere for c(r,t), as well as zero flux at the boundary, and this constant term does not decay in time. So the solution for c(r,t) at long times has the form: c(r,t) = c 0 + (c*/r)\u00b7exp(-\uf06c k* \u00b7t)\u00b7sin(k*\u00b7r). It approaches the constant c 0 at very long times, with the leading spatially non-uniform term decaying at a rate: \uf06c k* = D\u00b7k* 2 = D\u00b7(4.49/R) 2 .

This ratio is given by pore diameter times number of pores divided by nuclear diameter: 5.2 nm x 2000/20 microns \u2248 0.5. From the calculations of Zarnitsyn et al. 50 for transport through a collection of pores contained within a disc-shaped region in a flat sheet, the above value of 0.5 corresponds to transport at ~ 25% of the free diffusion limit. Therefore, in the presence of the nuclear envelope, we estimate that the net relaxation rate will be ~ 0.25\u00b7\uf06c k* ~ 1 s -1 , corresponding to a relaxation time of 2-5A between nucleus and cytoplasm of 1s.
