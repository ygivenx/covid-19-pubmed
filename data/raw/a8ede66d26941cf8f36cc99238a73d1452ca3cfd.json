{"title": "Identification and characterization of RNA duplex unwinding and ATPase activities of an alphatetravirus superfamily 1 helicase", "body": "The Alphatetraviridae is a family of positive-stranded (\u00fe) RNA viruses, which are the family of viruses with nonenveloped icosahedral T\u00bc4 viral particles, and also the family of RNA viruses that restrictively infect insects, particularly the Lepidoptera (Hanzlik and Gordon, 1997; Speir and Johnson, 2008) . Previously, tetraviruses, whose capsids share a common T\u00bc4 symmetry, had been classified as a single family called Tetraviridae. Recently, this group of viruses has been re-classified into three families, i.e., Alphatetraviridae, Carmotetraviridae and Permutotetraviridae (http://www.ictvonline. org/virusTaxonomy.asp?version=2011), based on their genome organizations and translation products (Adams and Carstens, 2012; Dorrington, 2011; Walter et al., 2010; Zeddam et al., 2010) . For the Alphatetraviridae family, two genera are classified, including betatetravirus and omegatetravirus. Betatetraviruses, such as Nudaurelia capensis b virus (NbV), have a single genomic RNA of $6.5 kilobase (kb) and a pitted particle surface, while omegatetraviruses, such as N. capensis o virus (NoV) and Helicoverpa armigera stunt virus (HaSV), have bipartite genomic RNAs (RNA1: $ 5.3 kb; RNA2: $2.5 kb) and particle surface with oval protrusions (Olson et al., 1990; Speir and Johnson, 2008; Speir et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2006) .\n\nTetraviruses in all the three families have attracted a lot of attentions due to their close evolutionary linkage with nodaviruses, another family of (\u00fe)RNA viruses, such as Flock House virus (FHV) and Wuhan nodavirus (WhNV), that have T\u00bc3 capsids and are well recognized as models for studying viral RNA replication, antiviral innate immunity and nonenveloped virus entry into cells (Odegard et al., 2010; Qi et al., , 2012 Qiu et al., 2011; Speir et al., 2010; Walukiewicz et al., 2006) . The capsids of both tetraviruses and nodaviruses undergo autoproteolytic maturation processing and yield small g peptides that are lipophilic and may function to disrupt host membranes for viral entry (Bothner et al., 2005; Speir et al., 2010; Tang et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2002; Tomasicchio et al., 2007; Walukiewicz et al., 2006) . Moreover, previous structural studies uncovered numerous structural similarities between tetraviruses and nodaviruses, suggesting that the capsids of tetraviruses are evolutionarily derived from those of nodaviruses, and carmotetravirus is evolutionarily more primordial and closer to nodaviruses than omegatetravirus (Johnson et al., 1994; Speir et al., 2010) . Interestingly, omegatetraviruses have a bipartite genome, like nodaviruses, while the genome of carmotetravirus is monopartite (Cai et al., 2010; Speir and Johnson, 2008) . On the other hand, the replicases of omegatetraviruses belong to alpha-like viral replicase (Ahlquist et al., 1985; Koonin et al., 1992; Sabanadzovic et al., 2009; Yi et al., 2005; Zeddam et al., 2010) , making the evolution of tetraviruses, particularly omegatetraviruses, more complicated and interesting. Therefore, a better understanding of the biology of omegatetraviruses may provide novel insights into conserved or unconserved biological characteristics of the Alphatetraviridae family.\n\nDendrolimus punctatus tetravirus (DpTV) was isolated from diseased D. punctatus (pine moth) from Yunnan Province, China and has been identified as an omegatetravirus (Dorrington, 2011; Yi et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2006) . Although the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses renamed it as D. punctatus virus (DpV) in 2009 (http://www.ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy. asp?version=2009), in this study we still use the name of DpTV to avoid possible confusion, as the abbreviation of Dasychira pudibunda virus, a betatetravirus, is also DpV. Our group studies both nodavirus (Qi et al., , 2012 Qiu et al., 2011) and alphatetravirus (Yi et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2006 Zhou et al., , 2008 , and therefore, we decided to embark on a systematic characterization of the molecular biology of alphatetravirus, particularly DpTV. Here, we reported such an effort aimed to characterize the putative helicase of alphatetravirus.\n\nHelicases normally utilize the energy generated from nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis to translocate along and unwind the helical structure of dsDNA or dsRNA (Mackintosh and Raney, 2006; Singleton et al., 2007) . Helicases are classified into six superfamilies (SF), SF-1 to SF-6 ( Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993; Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Karpe and Lole, 2010; Singleton et al., 2007) . Among them, SF-1 and SF-2 are the two largest and most closely related superfamilies, which are generally monomers containing at least seven conserved motifs (I, Ia, II, III, IV, V, and VI) that mediate DNA/RNAbinding, NTP binding, NTP hydrolysis or conformational change of helicases (Caruthers and McKay, 2002; Fairman-Williams et al., 2010; Gorbalenya et al., 1988; Hodgman, 1988) . To date, many (\u00fe)RNA viruses are found to encode their own helicases, and helicases are found to be essential for RNA replication of numerous (\u00fe)RNA viruses, such as brome mosaic virus (BMV) (Ahola et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2005) , poliovirus (Mirzayan and Wimmer, 1992; Teterina et al., 1992) , flavivirus (Gu et al., 2000) , alphavirus (Rikkonen, 1996) and nidovirus (van Dinten et al., 2000) .\n\nFor alphatetraviruses, they encode a large viral RNA replicase protein (DpTV: $ 180 kDa, HaSV: $187 kDa, NbV: $ 215 kDa). On the basis of the amino acid sequences, some alphatetraviral replicases, including NbV and all omegatetraviruses, were predicted to contain three putative domains indicative of methyltransferase (MT), RNA helicase (Hel), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Gordon et al., 1995 Hanzlik and Gordon, 1997; Pringle et al., 1999; Short et al., 2010; Yi et al., 2005; Zeddam et al., 2010) . Despite the importance of helicases in (\u00fe)RNA viruses, helicase activity in alphatetraviruses has not been formally determined, and consequently, the molecular mechanisms of helicasemediated unwinding of alphatetraviral dsRNA have not yet been studied, which hinders our understanding of this family of viruses.\n\nHere, we demonstrate that DpTV Hel is a functional RNA helicase with 5 0 -3 0 unwinding directionality, and further characterized this first alphatetraviral RNA helicase in detail. Our study not only represents a crucial step toward understanding the mechanism of alphatetravirus dsRNA unwinding, but also shed light on the future study of RNA helicases and dsRNA unwinding of other alphatetraviruses.\n\nFor (\u00fe)RNA viruses, helicase plays an indispensable role in RNA replication, transcription, and protein translation as its unwinding the secondary structure of dsRNA to be recognized by related proteins (Abdelhaleem, 2010; Lohman and Bjornson, 1996; Pyle, 2008; Speir and Johnson, 2008) . To investigate whether DpTV as well as other alphatetraviruses such as HaSV and NbV, encode a helicase, we compared the amino acid sequence of DpTV replicase protein with various viral RNA helicases. As shown in Fig. 1A , the putative helicase domain of DpTV (amino acids 596-835) contains all the seven conserved motifs of SF-1 helicase, of which motifs I, II, and VI have been well studied previously in other helicases and demonstrated to be important for their activities. This sequence comparison suggests that this putative domain is an RNA helicase.\n\nOur previous study showed that the putative DpTV helicase domain (Hel) did not have activity when being bacterially expressed (data not shown), indicating the necessity to use a eukaryotic system to express this protein. To determine if DpTV Hel contains the classic helicase activity, i.e., unwinding double-stranded oligonucleotides, we expressed DpTV Hel as N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein (MBP-Hel) in Baculovirus Expression System, following by protein purification (Fig. 1C and D, lane 2). Moreover, we also generated a serial of point mutations in the predicted motifs I, II and VI of DpTV Hel as indicated in Fig. 1B to investigate the potential effects of these conserved motifs on DpTV Hel unwinding activity.\n\nTo examine the unwinding activity of DpTV Hel, a short hexachloro fluorescein (HEX)-labeled RNA (RNA1) and a long non-labeled RNA (RNA3) were annealed to generate a standard dsRNA substrate with both 3 0 and 5 0 single-stranded tails (15 bases) (see the ''Materials and methods'' section). The standard substrate was incubated with DpTV Hel in unwinding reaction mixture, followed by gel electrophoresis analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A , HEX-labeled RNA strand was released from the RNA duplex substrate in the presence of DpTV Hel, MgCl 2 and ATP ( Fig. 2A, lane 6 ). In addition, removing MgCl 2 or ATP, both of which are indispensable for most helicases activities (Huang and Liu, 2002; Shen et al., 1998; Warrener and Collett, 1995) , resulted in the complete loss of unwinding activity of DpTV Hel ( Fig We further examined whether DpTV Hel is able to unwind substrates containing DNA. To this end, we constructed three different substrates, D n /R via annealing a short HEX-labeled DNA (DNA1) and a long non-labeled RNA (RNA3), R n /D via annealing a short HEX-labeled RNA (RNA1) and a long non-labeled DNA (DNA2), and D n /D via annealing a short HEX-labeled DNA (DNA1) and a long non-labeled DNA (DNA2) (see the ''Materials and methods'' section). Each substrate was incubated with DpTV Hel at the same conditions as described in Fig. 2A . As shown in Fig. 2B -D, DpTV Hel could only unwind the substrate with RNA tails (D n /R) but not the substrates with DNA tails (R n /D, D n /D). These results show that DpTV Hel merely recognizes RNA template strands to unwind oligonucleotides from them, and DpTV Hel is an RNA but not a DNA specific helicase.\n\nFurthermore, we examined the importance of the conserved SF-1 motifs on DpTV Hel dsRNA unwinding activity. To this end, the standard dsRNA substrate is incubated with MBP fusion Hel (I), Hel (II) or Hel (VI) mutant at the same conditions as described in Fig. 2A .\n\nOur results revealed that the mutations in motifs I, II, and VI dramatically reduced the dsRNA unwinding activity (Fig. 2E ), thereby showing that these conserved motifs are required for DpTV Hel unwinding activity and DpTV Hel is a SF-1 RNA helicase.\n\nAltogether, our findings from this set of experiments demonstrate that DpTV Hel is a functional RNA helicase, which belongs to SF-1 helicase superfamily. DpTV Hel directs the 5 0 -3 0 dsRNA unwinding, whose efficiency is dependent on the length of the 5 0 single-stranded tail on template strand After determining that DpTV Hel is a functional helicase, we sought to examine the directionality of its RNA unwinding. To this end, several dsRNA substrates containing a 5 0 singlestranded tail (15 bases), a 3 0 single-stranded tail (15 bases), and blunt ends were constructed, and then reacted with MBP-Hel. As shown in Fig. 3A -C, only the dsRNA with 5 0 single-stranded tail could be unwound by MBP-Hel, while 3 0 -tailed or blunt ended dsRNA substrates could not be unwound. These results show that DpTV Hel unwinds dsRNA in the 5 0 -3 0 direction. Furthermore, we examined the impact of the length of 5 0 single-stranded tail on DpTV Hel unwinding activity. As illustrated in Fig. 3D , a series of dsRNA substrates with progressively decreasing lengths of 5 0 single-stranded tail were generated and then reacted with MBP-Hel. The unwinding efficiency of DpTV Hel on these substrates was graphed as the percentage of the released RNA from the total dsRNA substrate at each time point. As shown in Fig. 3E , as the length of 5 0 single-stranded tail decreased, the unwinding efficiency was also gradually reduced. At 60 min, the substrate release was about 44% in the presence of 15 bases single-stranded tail. When the length of 5 0 single-stranded tail was reduced to three bases, only 13% RNA could be released from the dsRNA substrate. Taken together, these results indicate that DpTV Hel directs the dsRNA unwinding in the 5 0 -3 0 direction, and its unwinding efficiency is dependent on the length of the 5 0 single-stranded tail on template strand.\n\nTo further characterize the biochemical properties of DpTV Hel, we examined its dsRNA unwinding activity under varying reaction conditions, such as divalent metal ions, salt content and pH. The unwinding efficiency of DpTV Hel was graphed as the percentage of the released RNA from the total dsRNA substrate at each indicated reaction condition.\n\nFor helicases, Mg 2\u00fe is usually required for their activities (Warrener and Collett, 1995; Yang et al., 2006) , and we found that DpTV Hel unwinding activity also requires the presence of Mg 2\u00fe (Fig. 2A) . Here, we first examined whether other divalent metal ions could also support DpTV Hel function instead of Mg 2 \u00fe . Our results showed that besides Mg 2\u00fe , only Mn 2\u00fe was able to efficiently support the unwinding activity (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6) . Then, we further determined the impacts of the Mn 2\u00fe and Mg 2\u00fe concentrations on DpTV Hel unwinding activity. The highest unwinding activity was observed at 2 mM MgCl 2 (Fig. 4B ) or 4 mM MnCl 2 (Fig. 4C ), but Mg 2\u00fe was preferred over Mn 2 \u00fe under all conditions.\n\nWe further examined the effects of salt content and pH on DpTV Hel unwinding activity. The dsRNA unwinding assays with different concentrations of KCl showed that the optimal KCl concentration was around 50 mM and this helicase is relatively sensitive to KCl, as the increase of KCl from 50 mM strongly inhibited the unwinding activity of DpTV Hel (Fig. 4D) . Then, under 2 mM MgCl 2 and 50 mM KCl, the optimal pH for the unwinding reaction was determined to a range from 7.5 to 9.0 (Fig. 4E) . Taken together, we have determined the optimal reaction conditions for DpTV Hel dsRNA unwinding activity, and reaction mixture containing 2 mM MgCl 2 and 50 mM KCl and adjusted to pH 7.5 by 20 mM HEPES-KOH was used for subsequent experiments.\n\nTo drive dsRNA unwinding, helicases usually require NTP hydrolysis to provide energy. We previously showed that the dsRNA unwinding activity of DpTV Hel depended on the presence of ATP ( Fig. 2A) . Thus, we sought to examine whether DpTV Hel also contains the NTPase activity to hydrolyze ATP and other kinds of NTPs and dNTPs. For this purpose, we measured the kinetic parameters K m (the Michaelis constant that describes the amount of substrate needed for the enzyme to obtain half of its maximum rate of reaction) and k cat (a constant that describes the turnover rate of an enzyme-substrate complex to product and enzyme), and indicated the NTPase activity as k cat /K m (the rate constant that measures catalytic efficiency) of DpTV Hel in the presence of different NTPs and dNTPs. Our results showed that DpTV Hel was able to hydrolyze all NTPs and dNTPs, and the catalytic efficiency of this NTPase with ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP ranged from 60 to 78 (Table 1) . Thus, we conclude that DpTV Hel contains the NTPase activity, which shows no preference to any specific NTP or dNTP.\n\nAfter determining that DpTV Hel contains the NTPase activity, to further characterize its biochemical properties, we examined its ATPase activity under varying reaction conditions, such as divalent metal ions, salt content and pH. It is noteworthy that ATP is selected as the hydrolysis substrate as it is the major energy source in cells (Hara, 2009 ). The ATPase activity of DpTV Hel was determined using a sensitive colorimetric assay that measures the total amount of orthophosphate released after each reaction. As shown in Fig. 5A , B and C, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl or pH 7.5 was the optimal condition for DpTV Hel to hydrolyze ATP. Comparing with the optimal reaction conditions for DpTV Hel dsRNA unwinding activity (Fig. 4B, D and E) , our results show that the optimal conditions for ATPase and unwinding activities of DpTV Hel are similar.\n\nATPase activities of DpTV Hel and its mutants are stimulated by dsRNA\n\nWe have determined that DpTV Hel is an RNA helicase, which also contains an NTPase activity to generate energy for dsRNA unwinding. Thus, it is interesting to examine if the presence of dsRNA or dsDNA has any effect on the NTPase activity of DpTV Hel. For this purpose, DpTV Hel ATPase activity was determined in the absence or presence of standard dsRNA or dsDNA. Our results showed that dsRNA significantly promoted the ATPase activity of DpTV Hel for $ 2-2.5 folds compared to that of DpTV Hel alone, while dsDNA showed no effect (Fig. 6A) . These results indicate that the oligonucleotide-mediated stimulation of DpTV Hel ATPase activity is also RNA-specific like its duplex unwinding activity.\n\nPreviously we have shown that the point mutations of the conversed SF-1 motifs I, II and VI dramatically inhibited the unwinding activity of DpTV Hel (Fig. 2E) . Thus, we sought to examine if these mutations can also affect the ATPase activity. To this end, we examined the ATPase activities of DpTV Hel mutants and found that three mutants almost lost all ATPase activity in the absence of dsRNA and dsDNA (Fig. 6B) . Interestingly, although dsDNA still showed no effect on the ATPase activity, the presence of dsRNA dramatically stimulated the ATPase activities of these mutants (20-100 fold), resulting in a partial rescue of the mutation-caused loss of ATPase activity to around 40% of wild-type DpTV Hel alone (Fig. 6B) .\n\nTaken together, our results demonstrate that dsRNA can not only stimulate DpTV Hel ATPase activity, but also induce a partial rescue of the ATPase activities that were originally abolished by motifs I, II and VI mutations. Consistently, these DpTV Hel mutants exhibited weakened but not abolished dsRNA unwinding activities (Fig. 2E) , probably due to the partial recovery of ATPase activities in the presence of dsRNA substrates.\n\nHelicases are required for viral replication of many (\u00fe )RNA viruses (Ahola et al., 2000; Gu et al., 2000; Lam and Frick, 2006; Mirzayan and Wimmer, 1992; Rikkonen, 1996; van Dinten et al., 2000) . Moreover, it may relate to RNA translocation, genome packaging, protection of RNA at the replication center, and modulate RNA-protein interaction (Karpe and Lole, 2010) . In this study, we demonstrate that DpTV Hel, the putative helicase domain of DpTV, is a functional RNA helicase with 5 0 -3 0 unwinding directionality. Sequence analysis indicated that DpTV Hel contains all the seven conserved SF-1 motifs, and the mutations in the conserved motifs I, II and VI significantly inhibited DpTV Hel unwinding activity. Based on its conserved SF-1 motifs, specificity for dsRNA, and 5 0 -3 0 unwinding directionality, DpTV Hel belongs to the distinct class of SF1B RNA helicase in the SF-1 superfamily.\n\nOur studies further revealed the length requirement of the 5 0 single-stranded tail and the optimal reaction conditions for the dsRNA unwinding activity of DpTV Hel. Moreover, we find that DpTV Hel also contains NTPase activity to hydrolyze ATP as well as other NTPs and dNTPs. The ability of DpTV Hel to hydrolyze ATP could be significantly stimulated by dsRNA but not dsDNA. Interestingly, dsRNA can partially rescue the ATPase activity abolishment caused by motifs I, II and VI mutations.\n\nDpTV Hel showed the 5 0 -3 0 unwinding directionality with the specificity for RNA template strand, and its dsRNA unwinding efficiency is dependent on the length of the 5 0 single-stranded tail on the RNA template strand. During viral RNA replication, the 5 0 single-stranded tail on RNA template strand can be provided by a replication bubble at the site of nucleotide addition by viral replicase (Warrener and Collett, 1995) , and helicase may progress toward dsRNA by a cooperative enzyme binding mechanism to enhance its dsRNA unwinding efficiency (Lee et al., 2010; Wen et al., 2009) . Moreover, the dsRNA unwinding and ATPase activities of DpTV Hel are relatively sensitive to reaction environment, including divalent metal ions and K \u00fe ionic concentrations, and pH (Figs. 4 and 5) . These biochemical features indicate that DpTV Hel should function in a limited environment in cells. Indeed, RNA replication of ( \u00fe)RNA viruses requires viral RNA replicase proteins to associate with intracellular membranes and induce membrane invagination to form small spherules (Ahlquist, 2006; Short and Dorrington, 2012; Short et al., 2010) .\n\nTo drive dsRNA or dsDNA unwinding, helicases usually hydrolyze NTP, normally ATP, to provide energy (Abdelhaleem, 2010; Manosas et al., 2010) . For DpTV, its helicase activity also depends on the presence of ATP (Fig. 2A, lane 5) . Moreover, the observation that DpTV Hel can hydrolyze all types of NTPs and dNTPs (Table 1) further confirms its NTPase activity, which can use broad energy sources not limited to ATP. Moreover, we have shown that dsRNA can substantially stimulate DpTV Hel to hydrolyze ATP (Fig. 6A) , which is consistent with many other SF-1 helicases whose ATPase activities can be stimulated by oligonucleotides (Gros and Wengler, 1996; Karpe and Lole, 2010; Kim et al., 1999; Seybert et al., 2000; Tanner et al., 2003) . It is possible that binding to dsRNA induces a conformational change on DpTV Hel, which further facilitates DpTV Hel to hydrolyze ATP. However, dsDNA had no effect on the ATPase activity of DpTV Hel (Fig. 6A) . Given that dsRNA and dsDNA have different biochemical properties and structures (Kawaoka, 2005) , the dsRNA-selective stimulation of DpTV Hel ATPase activity may be due to the protein-dsRNA interaction.\n\nThe sequence analysis revealed that DpTV Hel contains all the seven conserved motifs of SF-1 helicase (Fig. 1A) . And we found that the abolishment of DpTV Hel ATPase activity was caused by point mutations in motifs I, II and VI, which were reported to be directly involved in ATP hydrolysis and oligonucleotide-binding (Fairman-Williams et al., 2010; Weng et al., 1996) . Interestingly, these mutation-induced abolishments of ATPase activity could be partially rescued by dsRNA (Fig. 6B ). This recovery of ATPase activity may be caused by the protein-dsRNA interaction that stimulates the abilities of DpTV Hel mutants to hydrolyze ATP. Moreover, DpTV Hel mutants exhibited a weakened but not abolished dsRNA unwinding activities (Fig. 2E) , probably due to the partial recovery of ATPase activity in the presence of dsRNA substrates.\n\nTo our knowledge, our study is the first to identify a functional helicase from an alphatetravirus, and further provides a detailed characterization of the unwinding and ATPase activities of this nonstructural protein. Our work not only represents an important step toward understanding the mechanism of DpTV dsRNA unwinding, but would also provide directions for future studies of helicases and viral replication of other members of the Alphatetraviridae family. Moreover, our identification and characterization of DpTV Hel adds a new member to the SF1B class of the SF1 helicase superfamily.\n\nStandard procedures were used for extraction of virus genome RNA and reverse transcription-PCR (Zhou et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2008) . A cDNA fragment of the putative DpTV helicase domain (amino acids 523 to 1042 of replicase ORF) was prepared, and mutations were introduced via PCR-mediated mutagenesis as described previously (Yang et al., 2006) . The primers used in this study are shown in Table 2 . All the fragments were inserted into pFastBac TM HTB-MBP vector, which was originated from the vector pFastBac TM HT-B (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and modified by our laboratory (Yang et al., 2006) , and the resulting plasmid would be used in Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System to make a fusion protein with an MBP-tag at the N-terminus of DpTV helicase domain.\n\nThe expression and purification of MBP alone and MBP-Hel proteins were carried out as previously described (Yang et al., 2006) . Briefly, Sf9 cells at a density of 2 \u00c2 10 6 cells/ml were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses of interest at a MOI of 3 and harvested at 72 h after infection. Cell pellets were resuspended in a binding buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol] supplemented with protease inhibitors cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were lysed by sonication and then debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 11,000 g. The protein in the supernatant was purified using amylose affinity chromatography (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Collected fractions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing protein of the expected size were combined and then concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 filters (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany), and the buffer was exchanged to 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl and 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Finally, the protein was stored at \u00c0 70 1C in aliquots. All proteins were quantified by the Bradford method. The purified MBP-Hel protein was used to immunize rabbits for the production of polyclonal antibodies as previously described (Ye et al., 2012) .\n\nHelicase substrates consist of two complementary oligonucleotide strands that were annealed and gel purified. Of the two strands, the larger one was unlabeled and is referred as the template strand. While the smaller strand, referred to as the release strand, was labeled at 5 0 end with HEX (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai) (Warrener and Collett, 1995) . In this paper, all DNA strands and HEX-labeled DNA or RNA strands were commercially obtained (Sangon Biotech), and all oligonucleotides in Table 2 were not sequence-specific for viral RNA but designed randomly. Unlabeled RNA strands were synthesized by run-off transcriptions of the PCR products that carry appropriate DNA inserts in the transcription region using T7 RNA polymerase.\n\nTo generate oligonucleotide duplexes, the labeled release strand and unlabeled template strand were combined at a molar ratio of approximately 3:1 in 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0) and 50 mM KCl. The mixture was heated at 95 1C for 5 min and was then slowly cooled down to room temperature. Annealed products were resolved on 15% native-PAGE, and a band corresponding to double-stranded oligonucleotides was cut from the gel, minced, and soaked in buffer containing 0.5 M ammonium acetate, 10 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS at room temperature for 5 to 6 h for elution. Extracted oligonucleotides were ethanol precipitated and dissolved in nuclease-free water. Standard dsRNA substrate was annealed with RNA1 and RNA3, D n /R substrate was annealed with DNA1 and RNA3, R n /D substrate was annealed with RNA1 and DNA2, D n /D substrate was annealed with DNA1 and DNA2, 5 0 -tailed substrate was annealed with RNA1 and RNA8, 3 0 -tailed substrate was annealed with RNA1 and RNA7, and bluntended substrate was annealed with RNA1 and RNA2. All DNA and RNA oligonucleotides are listed in Table 2 .\n\nDuplex unwinding assays 50 pmol of protein and 0.1 pmol of dsRNA or dsDNA substrate were added to a mixture containing a final concentration of 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT, 50 mM KCl and 5U RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI). The total reaction volume is 10 ml unless otherwise indicated. Reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mM ATP and incubated at 37 1C for 1 h. To minimize reannealing of the unwound oligonucleotides, a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA trap, corresponding to release strand, was added at the same time as the reaction terminated. As a positive control, substrates were heat denatured at 95 1C for 5 min in the absence of enzyme. Mixtures were electrophoresed on 10% native-PAGE gels. Gels were scanned with a Typhoon9200 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The ratio of released single strands versus the total of substrates was quantified with Image-Quant software (GE Healthcare).\n\nNTPase activities were determined using a direct colorimetric assay as previously described (Henkel et al., 1988; Lanzetta et al., 1979) . Briefly, a typical NTPase assay was carried out in a 20 ml reaction volume, containing 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT and 10 pmol protein. The NTPase reaction was initiated by the addition of NTP to a final concentration of 1 mM and then incubated at 37 1C for 20 min. When indicated, 25 mg/ml standard dsRNA or dsDNA, which serves as a substrate for DpTV Hel unwinding, was included in the reaction mixture. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mM. The color was developed for 5 min following the addition of 80 ml of dye solution (water, 0.0812% malachite green, 5.72% ammonium molybdate in 6 N HCl and 2.32% polyvinyl alcohol were freshly mixed in a 2:2:1:1 ratio, respectively). Then 10 ml of 34% sodium citrate was added and the absorbance at 620 nm was measured after 15 min by using a 96-wellplate reader (Spectra Max M2, USA). The concentration of inorganic phosphate was determined by matching the A 620 nm in a standard curve of A 620 nm versus known standard phosphate concentrations. All the results given with this quantitative assay were the averages of three repeat experiments.\n\nWestern blot analysis was performed according to our standard procedures (Ye et al., 2012) . The polyclonal anti-Hel antibody was described above and used at the dilutions of 1:1000. The anti-MBP antibody was purchased from New England Bio-Labs, and used at the dilutions of 1:10,000."}
