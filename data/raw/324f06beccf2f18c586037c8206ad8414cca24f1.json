{"title": "Dampened STING-Dependent Interferon Activation in Bats Dampened STING-Dependent Interferon Activation in Bats", "body": "Bats co-exist with a large variety of viruses, and infection-derived cytosolic DNA could result in heightened DNA sensing and overactivation. Xie et al.\n\nshow that STING-dependent IFN activation is dampened in bats due to the replacement of the highly conserved and functionally important serine residue S358.\n\nBats are uniquely the only flying mammals and are found to have a positively selected oxidative phosphorylation pathway as a result of an increased metabolic capacity (Shen et al., 2010) . Byproducts of oxidative metabolism and stress are known to cause DNA damage, resulting in the escape of self-DNA from the nucleus, mitochondria, or lysosomes into the cytoplasm (Barzilai et al., 2002) . Bats have been increasingly linked to deadly viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola virus, and henipaviruses (Wynne and Wang, 2013) . Although most of these zoonotic viruses are RNA viruses, bats also harbor a variety of DNA viruses (Brook and Dobson, 2015) . In addition, it is known that infection of RNA viruses can also result in cytosolic DNA due to intracellular damage (Ryan et al., 2016) . Infection-derived cytosolic DNA as well as self-DNA is known to trigger robust immune responses, leading to inflammasome activation and type I interferon (IFN) induction (Schlee and Hartmann, 2016) . While it is accepted that overactivation of either inflammasome or IFN can cause autoimmune diseases (Peckham et al., 2017) , it is unknown how bats, while naturally maintaining a high burden of viruses and the oxidative stressors of flight, are able to regulate the response against stimulatory sensing of cytosolic DNA to avoid overactivation of innate immune pro-inflammatory pathways.\n\nIn humans, the DNA sensors of the innate immune system include AIM2 and IFI16 in inflammasome assembly (Hornung et al., 2009; Kerur et al., 2011) , and TLR9, IFI16, DDX41, LSM14A, and cGAS in IFN expression (Latz et al., 2004; Li et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2013; Unterholzner et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2011) . Among these cytosolic sensors, cGAS was identified as the universal and essential DNA sensor that produces cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) in response to DNA stimulation (Sun et al., 2013) , which in turn binds to and activates stimulator of IFN genes (STING; also known as MITA, ERIS, and MPYS), the essential adaptor protein in multiple DNA sensing pathways (Ishikawa and Barber, 2008; Jin et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2009; Zhong et al., 2008) . Following STING activation, TBK1 is recruited to STING, leading to the subsequent phosphorylation of STING and IRF3 by TBK1. This ultimately triggers the type I IFN response. Point mutation of either phosphorylation site (S358 or S366) of STING to alanine significantly impaired its ability to activate downstream IFNs (Liu et al., 2015; Tanaka and Chen, 2012; Zhong et al., 2008) .\n\nThere are limited studies on bat DNA sensors despite the belief that bat cells are likely to be more at risk of cytosolic DNA exposure. A recent comparative genomics study showed that the most positively selected genes of bats seemed to be concentrated in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway and innate immunity (Zhang et al., 2013) . One of these genes encodes the inflammasome sensor NLRP3. More strikingly, the entire PYHIN gene family, including AIM2 and IFI16, is lost in all bat genomes sequenced so far, implying a dampened DNA-triggered inflammasome response (Ahn et al., 2016) . Bats have been shown to have a contracted type I IFN locus and different expression patterns of type III IFNs compared with those in human and mouse (Zhou et al., 2011 (Zhou et al., , 2016 . Also, TLR9 seems to be under greater positive selection in bats compared with other mammals (Escalera-Zamudio et al., 2015) . Taken together, these findings suggest that bats may have evolved to adopt a DNA sensing and IFN response mechanism in adaptation to flight, which is sufficiently different from terrestrial mammals.\n\nIn this context, we hypothesized that cytosolic DNA, whether it is flight-induced or infection-derived, imposes strong selective pressures on the bat DNA sensors, resulting in a functionally dampened sensing mechanism and downstream IFN production to avoid overactivation on a regular basis during normal flight and/or co-existence with viruses. As STING is increasingly being recognized as the central molecule in the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, we conducted a comprehensive sequence and functional analysis of bat STING. Sequence alignment of all available bat STING (from a total of 30 different species) with ten major non-bat mammalian STING revealed a key difference: while the S358 residue is absolutely conserved among all known non-bat mammalian STING, none of the bat STING retain the S358. Instead, this residue has been replaced by a variety of different residues at this position, including N, H, F, Y, P, D, and R ( Figure 1 ). As the S358 phosphorylation site is critical for downstream IFN activation in humans and other mammals (Liu et al., 2015; Tanaka and Chen, 2012; Tsuchida et al., 2010; Zhong et al., 2008) , this key residue change strongly suggests a weakened bat STING in the context of IFN activation.\n\nTo test this, we compared the functional difference in the induction of IFNs between bat and mouse by cGAMP. Splenocytes from three individual Rhinolophus sinicus (Rs) and three laboratory mice were stimulated by cGAMP. Rs has been Table S1 . See also Figure S1 and Table S1. reported to be the reservoir host of the lethal severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Ge et al., 2013) . In contrast to a strong induction of IFNb and IRF7 (an IFN-stimulated gene [ISG] ) in mouse, transfection of cGAMP induced a much lower level of IFNb and IRF7 mRNA in Rs bats from qPCR analysis ( Figure 2A ). As controls, both poly I:C and Sendai virus treatment resulted in a comparable induction level of IFNb and IRF7 in both cells ( Figure 2A ). The qPCR results were corroborated by RNA high-throughput sequencing (RNA-seq). As shown in Figure 2B , a number of mouse ISGs were strongly upregulated upon cGAMP treatment, whereas the upregulation of bat ISGs was much less, both in number and fold change. Between the two Rs bats, there were subtle differences in ISG induction, which was not unexpected considering wild-caught outbred bats were used in this study.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis showed bat STING clustered with known mammalian STING ( Figure S1A ). qPCR analysis of mRNA levels in a range of Rs, Myotis davidii (Md), and Pteropus alecto (Pa) primary organs revealed an expression pattern not dissimilar to that found in mouse: STING was found to be expressed in a variety of tissues in bats, with highest levels in spleen and lung ( Figure S1B ). It can thus be concluded that phylogenetic divergence or difference in gene expression patterns between bats and mice is unlikely to be responsible for the observed reduction in STING-mediated IFN production.\n\nWe then examined whether the dampening of bat STING function by the change in residue 358 is common in other bats. In HEK293T cells, which lack endogenous cGAS and STING expression (Sun et al., 2013) , STING from three representative bats, Rs, Pa, and Md, and human was overexpressed together with human cGAS and IFNb promoter plasmids. Although polymorphism has been observed in human STING, a previous study indicated that the three variants (RGR, AQ, and HAQ) have different but comparable ability in IFN induction activities depending on the experimental conditions (Yi et al., 2013) . In this study, we have confirmed their observation and used the AQ variant for further studies. Mutant human STING S358A significantly reduced STING-induced IFNb production as reported previously (Zhong et al., 2008) . Conversely, mutant bat STING X358S (X = N, H, or D) significantly restored their ability for IFNb induction ( Figure 2C ). To exclude the possibility that the human cell system may affect bat STING function, we repeated the experiment in PakiT03, a Pa bat cell line that expresses reasonable amount of cGAS but a very low level of STING (Zhou et al., 2016) . The pattern was essentially identical to that observed in HEK293T, with wild-type bat STING showing dampened induction of IFN and ISGs compared with the X358S mutants ( Figure S2A ). We also tested this dampening function by cGAMP. HEK293T cells stably expressing wild-type (D358) or mutant S358 Rs STING were stimulated with cGAMP in digitonin permeabilization solution. The S358 STING induced significantly higher IFN ( Figure 2D ). These results suggest that the S358 replacement is mainly responsible for dampened STINGdependent IFN activation with cGAS co-expression or cGAMP stimulation.\n\nIt is proposed that bat's exceptional ability to host viruses with few or no clinical disease is likely the result of an intricate balance between the host immune system and virus infection (Schountz, 2014; Wynne and Wang, 2013) . We hypothesized that the dampened STING-IFN responses could be partially responsible for that intricate balance. In assessing the effect of different STING on herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in PakiT03 cells, it was found that the wild-type human STING was about 2.5-fold more effective in blocking HSV replication than the S358A mutant. However, this was reversed for bat STING, in which the wild-type bat STING was less effective than the mutant STING X358S with a reduction of approximately 3-, 2.5-, and 2-fold, respectively, for Md, Pa, and Rs STING ( Figure 2E ).\n\nIn human STING, residues S366 and S358 are important for IRF3, but not TBK1, binding and activation (Tanaka and Chen, 2012) . To understand the detailed mechanism of dampened STING-dependent IFN activation, we investigated whether this bat-specific S358 replacement universally affects IRF3 and TBK1 activation. When HEK293T cells were transfected with human or bat STING-expressing plasmids, phosphorylation of IRF3, but not TBK1, was markedly higher in cells transfected (1 mg/mL), or infected with SeV (100 hemagglutinin units/mL). Six hours later, the induction of IFNb and IRF7 genes was determined by qPCR. Primers can be found in Table S2 . (B) Transcriptome next-generation sequencing of splenocyte RNAs. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by RSEM at FDR (false discovery rate) < 0.05. The ISG in the DEG sets of mice and Rs bat are listed. Fold change is indicated in color from 0 to 110. (C) Restoration of STING function by introducing S358 in bat STING. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with STING, cGAS, IFNb promoter firefly luciferase, and renilla luciferase plasmids. Luciferase activity was determined 24 hr posttransfection. The blots showing protein levels can be found in Figure S2 . (D) cGAMP treatment of HEK293T stably expressing various STING. Cells stably expressing the indicated proteins were transfected with IFNb promoter firefly luciferase and renilla luciferase plasmids. Six hours later, cells were permeabilized in digitonin buffer with or without 1 mg/mL cGAMP. Luciferase activity was determined 16 hr after treatments. (E) PaKiT03 cells were transfected with indicated STING plasmids followed by infection with HSV-luciferase at MOI = 0.1 at 24 hr post-transfection. At 24 hr post-infection, HSV replication was determined by luciferase activity. Data from (A), (C), (D), and (E) are presented as the means \u00b1 SD, n = 3, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 (Student's t test). For (C) and (D), data represent fold change according to wells transfected with empty vector (set as 1). WT, wild-type; mt, mutant; Hs, Homo sapiens; Md, Myotis davidii; Pa, Pteropus alecto; Rs, Rhinolophus sinicus; pIC, poly I:C. See also Figure S2 and Table S2. with S358 STING ( Figure S2B ). Similar findings were observed in bat PakiT03 cells ( Figure S2C ), which eventually contributed to a different downstream IFN response and in turn the observed difference in modulating HSV replication. Taken together, these results demonstrated that while bat STING maintained its antiviral defense similar to human STING, the dampening likely contributed in part to the long-term co-existence of bats and viruses.\n\nWe hypothesized that excessive exposure to cytosolic DNA in bat cells during flight and/or viral infection would pose a strong natural selection pressure to reduce activation of bat DNA sensors. In this report, we have provided genetic and functional data to support this hypothesis. We have demonstrated that bat STING is less active in IFN induction and pinpointed residue 358 as the key site of difference between bat and human STING. Experimentally, we have demonstrated the replacement of the S358 residue in different bat STING resulted in dampened downstream IFN production via IRF3 phosphorylation. To our knowledge, this is the most conclusive experimental demonstration of a key innate defense pathway that is functionally different between bats and non-bat mammals with implications that bats are more effective in peaceful co-existence with a large number of viruses.\n\nThere is abundant evidence that bats harbor more viruses per species than other mammals (Brook and Dobson, 2015; Luis et al., 2013; Olival et al., 2017) . Infection-derived DNA can act as activators of DNA sensors such as cGAS and subsequently STING (Schlee and Hartmann, 2016) . Constitutive activation of STING could cause severe autoimmune diseases, such as vascular and pulmonary syndrome or Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (Barber, 2015) , while some highly pathogenic viruses such as SARS-CoV are known to induce excessive inflammation eventually leading to human death (Channappanavar et al., 2016) . The replacement of the serine residue at position 358 in every known bat STING is highly significant considering it is absolutely conserved in all other mammals. Our data support that the S358 replacement in bat STING dampened but did not fully diminish the functionality of STING. The nature of the weakened, but not entirely lost, functionality of STING may have profound impact for bats to maintain the balanced state of ''effective response'' but not ''over response'' against viruses. A similar finding was observed for bat IFNa, which are less in number but are constitutively expressed without stimulation (Zhou et al., 2016) . Above all, this discovery helps to further our understanding of the complex mechanisms in which bats fine-tune innate defense responses against insult by viral, bacterial, or host cytosolic DNA.\n\nDetailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: Ge, X.Y., Li, J.L., Yang, X.L., Chmura, A.A., Zhu, G., Epstein, J.H., Mazet, J.K., Hu, B., Zhang, W., Peng, C., et al.
