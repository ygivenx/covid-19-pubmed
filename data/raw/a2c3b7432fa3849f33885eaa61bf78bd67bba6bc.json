{"title": "Original article", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a highly contagious and fatal respiratory disease that has infected more than 8000 individuals, 10% of which died within a few months of the emergence of the disease between November 2002 and early 2003 [1] . Extensive collaborative research cooperation between the leading experts and the World Health Organization (WHO) led to the rapid identification of a novel coronavirus (CoV) as the etiological agent underlying the pandemic SARS infection. The SARS outbreak was consequently successfully controlled during the beginning of 2003 [2, 3] . A reemergence of a SARS-CoV pandemic is still considered to be a potential risk, and new strains of SARS could potentially be more severe than the strains that contributed to the 2003 outbreak. Since 2003, two additional human coronavirus, NL63 and HKU1, have been identified in patients around the world. These new viruses have been characterized and were found to be significantly less lethal than SARS-CoV [4e6] . A new SARS-like virus, HCoV-EMC, was recently identified in at least two individuals, one of whom died [7] . The first case of a fatal respiratory illness similar to the deadly SARS was very recently confirmed in Britain [8] . The possibility of a future SARS-like pandemic remains, and no vaccines or antiviral agents have yet been developed to prevent or treat SARS-like infections.\n\nSARS-CoV encodes a chymotrypsin-like protease (CL pro ) that plays a pivotal role in the replication of the virus [9] . Unlike common serine proteases that contain a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad in the active site, SARS-CoV 3CL pro contains a CyseHis catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) that is functionally analogous to the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus main protease (Cys145 and His41) and the human coronavirus 229E main protease (Cys145 and His41) [10] . Cys act as a nucleophile, whereas His functions as a general base [10, 11] . Since SARS-CoV 3CL pro plays an important role in the virus life cycle, it has been recognized as a viable target for anti-SARS drug development.\n\nOur ongoing efforts have led to the development of several inhibitors with moderate to remarkable potency against SARS-CoV 3CL pro . As shown in Fig. 1 , a first tripeptidic lead compound (1) bearing an electrophilic ketone as a warhead moiety was developed from the natural peptide sequence after extensive structural modifications [12] . Regarding the mechanism of action, the electrophilic ketone of 1 can be reacted to the active site Cys-SH group resulting in the formation of hemithioketal intermediate between the enzyme and inhibitors to interfere the enzyme function, and hence it was predicted be a reversible inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . A subsequent SAR study afforded promising inhibitors 2 and 3 with excellent inhibitory activities (K i ) of 4.1 and 3.1 nM, respectively [13] . Recently, we reported a series of low molecular weight dipeptide-type inhibitors in which the P3 valine moiety was removed form the lead compound 2 (see Fig. 1 ). This study led to the identification of a compound 4 as a promising lead with an inhibitory activity (K i ) of 0.39 mM (Fig. 2) [14] . From a structural point of view, the P3 N-arylglycyl moiety was recognized as crucial to the activity of 4, as the amine functionality of glycyl moiety formed a hydrogen bond with the backbone amino acid residue Glu166 of 3CL pro in the docking study.\n\nThis study was extended, as reported here, by rigidifying the P3 N-arylglycyl unit in 4 in search of a more suitable motif with a favorable conformation would provide better interactions and increase the inhibitory activity toward SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Accordingly, we designed and synthesized a series of dipeptide-type inhibitors with novel P3 scaffolds and tested the inhibitory activities of these compounds against SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Several analogs were identified as exhibiting potent inhibitory activities relative to the lead compound 4. In particular, a compound bearing a P3 4methoxyindole-2-carbonyl group (5h) exhibited excellent inhibitory activity, with a K i or IC 50 value of 0.006 or 0.74 mM, respectively.\n\nExtensive molecular docking studies of some compounds were conducted to model the binding interactions of these inhibitors.\n\nThe synthesis of the target compounds 5aer was envisioned as the assembly of two key fragments: the peptidics 14 and the Cterminal benzothiazole derivative 18 (Schemes 1 and 2). As shown in Scheme 1, the peptidic intermediates 14aer were synthesized via a coupling reaction between various carboxylic acids (8aer) and leucine tert-butyl ester (12), followed by deprotection of tert-butyl group. The carboxylic acids, such as 5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (8a), 1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (8b), 1H-indole-2carboxylic acid (8c), 5-methoxy-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid (8d), 5-hydroxy-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid (8e), 5-chloro-1H-indole- 2-carboxylic acid (8f), 6-methoxy-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid (8g), 4-methoxy-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid (8h), 4-hydroxy-1Hindole-2-carboxylic acid (8k), 1H-benzo[d]imidazole-2-carboxylic acid (8n), benzo[d]thiazole-2-carboxylic acid (8o), indoline-2carboxylic acid (8p), benzofuran-2-carboxylic acid (8q), and 1Hindole-3-carboxylic acid (8r) were commercially available.\n\nThe carboxylic acids 8i, 8j, 8l, and 8m were synthesized as shown in Scheme 1. Briefly, the commercially available methyl indole-2-carboxylate 6 underwent O-demethylation in the presence of boron tribromide (BBr 3 ) to produce the corresponding 4hydroxyindole ester 7 [15, 16] , which was subsequently treated with various alcohols under Mitsunobu conditions using diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) and triphenylphosphine (PPh 3 ) in THF, followed by deprotection with lithium hydroxide$water (LiOH$H 2 O) to furnish the 4-isopropoxy (8i) and/or 4-isobutyloxy indole-2-carboxylic acid (8j), respectively [15, 17] .\n\nThe commercially available 5-methoxyindole-2-caboxylic acid ethyl ester 9 was submitted to a VilsmeiereHaack formylation in the presence of phosphoryloxy chloride (POCl 3 ) in DMF to produce 10a [18, 19] . On the other hand, acylation of 9 with acetyl chloride in the presence of anhydrous aluminum chloride (AlCl 3 ) afforded compound 10b [19, 20] . Both the indole-3-formaldehyde (10a) and the indole-3-acetyl (10b) derivatives were reduced in the presence of triethyl silylhydride (Et 3 SiH) [19] to furnish 11a and 11b, which were hydrolyzed to afford the corresponding indole-2-carboxylic acids 8l and 8m, respectively.\n\nThe synthesis of the peptidic fragments 13aer was achieved from the leucine tert-butyl ester (12) in the presence of various carboxylic acids (8) via a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) e1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt)-mediated coupling method in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) in DMF. The N-protected amino acid tert-butyl esters (13) were subsequently deprotected with trifluoroacetic acid/water (10:1) over 1 h to afford the N-protected amino acids (14aer), which were used directly in subsequent steps. 16 [21, 22] by treatment with bromoacetonitrile, followed by reduction with PtO 2 (5%), cyclization, and hydrolysis (Scheme 2). Further coupling of 16 to N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine via the EDCeHOBt method afforded the Weinreb amide 17 [21] . The Weinreb amide 17 was then coupled to benzothiazole in the presence of n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi) at \u00c078 C to furnish 18, which was then deprotected and subsequently coupled to the peptides 14 in the presence of O-benzotriazole-N,N,N 0 ,N 0 -tetramethyluroniumhexafluoro phosphate (HBTU) and DIPEA in DMF to afford the title compounds 5aer. All compounds were purified by reverse phase HPLC for the biological evaluation and characterized by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and mass spectrometry. The purity of each compound exceeded 95%.\n\nThe K i or IC 50 values of the synthesized compounds against SARS-CoV 3CL pro are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The compounds were subjected to a fluorometric protease inhibitory assay using a procedure similar to that mentioned in earlier studies [22, 23] . Briefly, the kinetic parameters were determined at a constant substrate concentration, and the inhibitor concentrations were varied to assess the K i values [12e14]. The IC 50 values were determined only for certain potent inhibitors, based on the apparent decrease in the substrate concentration (H-TSAVLQSGFRK-NH 2 ) upon digestion by R188I SARS-CoV 3CL pro , as described previously [24e26] . The cleavage reaction was monitored by analytical HPLC, and the cleavage rates were calculated from the decrease in the substrate peak area. Tables 1 and 2 report the K i or IC 50 values as the mean of 3 independent experiments.\n\nIn a previous study, we reported a series of low molecular weight dipeptide-type SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors. Among them, compound 4 bearing P3 N-(3-methoxyphenyl)glycyl exhibited potent inhibitory activity with a K i value of 0.39 mM. In this study, we envisioned that substitutions at the P3 N-arylglycyl unit in 4 could improve the inhibitory potency against 3CL pro . Therefore, we designed and synthesized a series of analogs bearing a rigid P3 motif for evaluation against SARS-CoV 3CL pro . In a first attempt as shown in Table 1 , the N-(3-methoxyphenyl)glycyl unit was replaced with the DL-pyroglutamyl (5a; K i \u00bc 2.70 mM) or the pyrrole-2carbonyl (5b; K i \u00bc 1.70 mM) as a rigid P3 scaffold in 4. The inhibitory activities of the resulting compounds were dramatically reduced compared to the activity of 4 (K i \u00bc 0.39 mM). On the other hand, the introduction of an indole-2-carbonyl unit (5c; K i \u00bc 0.065 mM or IC 50 \u00bc 1.50 mM) yielded a 40-or 25-fold higher inhibitory potency relative to 5a or 5b, respectively, and a 6-fold more potent activity relative to 4. These studies suggested that the rigid indole-2-carbonyl, which was introduced in place of the P3 moiety (N-(3-methoxyphenyl)glycyl) in the lead compound 4, displayed appreciable inhibitory activity. Thus, compound 5c served as a lead compound for further optimization steps.\n\nThe substituent effects at different positions on the P3 indole unit in 5c were investigated by introducing a wide variety of substituents. Initially, substituents were introduced at the 5-position of the indole unit in 5c, including 5-methoxy (5d; K i \u00bc 0.067 mM or IC 50 \u00bc 4.60 mM), 5-hydroxyl (5e; K i \u00bc 0.160 mM), or 5-chloro (5f; K i \u00bc 0.028 mM or IC 50 \u00bc 4.80 mM). This result suggested that the 5chloro substituent on the indole unit (5f) exhibited good inhibitory potency relative to, respectively, lead compound 5c, 5-methoxy (5d) and 5-hydroxy (5e) derivatives. Next, a methoxy group was introduced at the 6-position on the indole unit, as shown in 5g\n\n. The activity of 5g was lower than the activity of 5d; thus, the substitution at the 6-position on the P3 indole-2-carbonyl in 5c did not significantly improve the inhibitory activity. On the other hand, the methoxy substitution at the 4-position on the indole unit (5h; K i \u00bc 0.006 mM or IC 50 \u00bc 0.74 mM) exhibited excellent inhibitory activity, with 10-or 55-fold increases in activity relative to, respectively, the 5-methoxy (5d) or 6-methoxy (5g) derivatives. This finding revealed that the methoxy substitution at the 4-position on the indole unit in 5c significantly improved the inhibitory activity.\n\nThe 4-methoxy group on the indole unit of 5h was examined by substitution with 4-isopropoxyl (5i; K i \u00bc 0.048 mM), 4-isobutyloxyl (5j; K i \u00bc 0.030 mM or IC 50 \u00bc 5.20 mM), or 4-hydroxyl (5k; K i \u00bc 0.026 mM or IC 50 \u00bc 1.30 mM) moieties; however, the inhibitory activities of 5i, 5j, or 5k were lower than the activity of the 4methoxy derivative 5h. This study strongly suggested that the optimal methoxy group at the 4-position on the indole in 5c was more important than the isopropoxy, isobutyloxy, or hydroxyl groups. We tested the introduction of substitutions at the 3-position on the indole unit by starting with the lead compound 5d. The 3methyl (5l; K i \u00bc 6.71 mM) or 3-ethyl (5m; K i \u00bc 7.51 mM) groups were introduced first; however, the inhibitory activities of both 5l and 5m were severely reduced relative to the activity of 5d. These Scheme 2. Synthetic outline for the preparation of 5aer Reagents and conditions: i) HN(OMe)Me$HCl, EDC$HCl, HOBt$H 2 O, Et 3 N, DMF, 0 C-rt, 2 h; ii) benzothiazole, n-BuLi, THF, \u00c078 C-rt, 3e5 h; iii) TFA, CH 2 Cl 2 , 0 C-rt, 1 h; iv) 14, HBTU, DIPEA, DMF, 0 C-rt, 2 h followed by HPLC purification. Note: the substituents R and R 1 were indicated in Table 1 .\n\nresults suggested that substitutions at the 3-position on the indole unit were not a fruitful direction of study.\n\nThe P3 indole unit in 5c was next examined by varying the heterocycle by replacing it with benzimidazole, benzothiazole, benzofuran, or indoline scaffolds. The compounds bearing a benzimidazole (5n; K i \u00bc 0.022, IC 50 \u00bc 1.30 mM) exhibited 3-fold potent inhibitory activity than the lead compound 5c; however, the other indoline (5p; K i \u00bc 0.120 mM) or benzothiazole (5o; K i \u00bc 0.800 mM) or a benzofuran (5q; K i \u00bc 14.1 mM), were lower than the activity of the lead compound 5c. Compound 5q, bearing a benzofuran unit, displayed a severely reduced inhibitory potency compared to the lead compound 5c. The observed low activity of 5q was attributed to the disruption of hydrogen bonding interactions at the P3 position. This result suggested that the hydrogen bonding properties of the amine moiety of the indole unit were very important for achieving effective inhibitory activities (see Fig. 4 ). The position of the carbonyl substitution on the indole unit in 5c was examined next. The inhibitory activity of the derivative (5r; K i \u00bc 0.683 mM) bearing an indole-3-carbonyl was reduced relative to the activity of the compound bearing an indole-2-carbonyl (5c;\n\n. The substitution may have interrupted a hydrogen bonding interaction with the protease (see Fig. 4 ). These results strongly suggested that the 2-carbonyl substitution on the indole unit in 5c was important to the inhibitory potency.\n\nThe binding mode of the most potent compound, 5h was computationally modeled using a three-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV 3CL pro based on the reported crystal structure [27] . A procedure similar to the procedure described previously was used here [12e14] . The molecular docking of 5h (orange sticks) was examined, in comparison with a lead compound 4 (blue sticks) and a structurally similar tripeptidic ligand (light blue sticks), the docking structure of which was elucidated by X-ray crystallography Fig. 3 ) [27] . Several minimization processes were performed using the MMFF94X force field to model the solvation environment surrounding the inhibitor. A molecular simulation was subsequently performed. As shown in Fig. 3 , the 5h moieties P1 0 eP2 interacted with the same region of the protease as did the lead compound 4 and the original ligand. The heterocycle unit mimicked the P3 valine of the reported substrate, and the phenyl ring in the indole unit partially occupied the S4-pocket. The rigid P3 moiety (4-methoxyindole unit) of 5h appeared to occupy a region of the active site with an appropriate volume and in a conformation that was more favorable than the conformation of the structurally flexible N-(3-methoxyphenyl)glycyl moiety in 4. Indeed, the fit of the rigid P3 moiety of 5h may have contributed to the 65-fold higher inhibitory potency of 5h as compared to 4. The detailed interactions between 5h and the active site are shown in Fig. 4A . Hydrogen bonds between the amine moiety (-NH) of the indole unit and the backbone amino acid residue Glu166 of 3CL pro were observed with a bond length of 2.673 A. Insight into the structureeactivity relationships was sought by performing docking studies and analyzing the binding interactions of certain compounds that displayed notable variations in their inhibitory activities (Fig. 4BeD) . The initial lead compound 5c, bearing a P3 indole-2-carbonyl unit, was docked (Fig. 4B) , revealing hydrogen bonding interactions similar to those predicted for 5h (Fig. 4A) ; however, 5q, bearing a benzofuran-2-carbonyl P3 moiety, could not form a hydrogen bond interaction with the backbone amino acid residue Glu166 (Fig. 4C) . The loss of hydrogen bond interactions could have reduced the inhibitory activity of compound 5q (K i \u00bc 14.1 mM) compared to the activity of compound 5c (K i \u00bc 0.065 mM). The compound 5r (K i \u00bc 0.683 mM), bearing an indole-3-carbonyl unit, engaged in two fewer hydrogen bonding interactions to the amino acid residues Glu166 and Gln189 of the protease relative to 5c, as shown in Fig. 4D . This study revealed that the optimal positioning of a carbonyl unit on the indole unit was very important for achieving a potent inhibitory activity.\n\nIn order to evaluate in-depth bending interaction between the most potent compound 5h and the SARS protease, the isothermal titration calorimetry study was demonstrated (Fig. 5) . The titration was performed at 25 C by injecting 10 mL aliquots of protease solution into the calorimetric cell (volume w 1.4 mL) containing the inhibitor 5h at a concentration of 6 mM. The concentration of protease in the syringe was 109 mM. The heat evolved upon each injection of protease was obtained from the integral of the calorimetric signal. The heat associated with inhibitor binding was obtained by subtracting the heat of dilution from the heat of reaction. The individual heats were plotted against the molar ratio, and the enthalpy change (DH) and association constant (K a \u00bc 1/K d ) were obtained by nonlinear regression of the data. The binding affinity of compound 5h was 16 nM which is in very good agreement with the K i value (0.006 mM).\n\nWe describe here the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of dipeptide-type inhibitors with novel P3 scaffolds against SARS-CoV 3CL pro . A docking study involving binding between the dipeptidic lead compound 4 and 3CL pro motivated the modification of a flexible P3 N-(3-methoxyphenyl)glycine in 4 to various structurally rigid moieties. This modification led to the identification of several potent derivatives, including 5cek and 5n, which displayed inhibitory activities (K i or IC 50 ) in the submicromolar to nanomolar range. Compounds 5c, 5f, 5h, 5k and 5n, in particular, exhibited the most potent inhibitory activities, with K i values of 0.065, 0.028, 0.006 0.026 and 0.022 mM, respectively.\n\nThese compounds are attractive leads for a further development effort toward potent peptidomimetics with suitable pharmaceutical profiles. A SAR study around the P3 site in the lead compound 4 led to the identification of a rigid indole-2-carbonyl unit as one of the best P3 moieties (5c). Further optimization of 5c showed that an optimal methoxy substitution at the 4-position on the P3 indole unit enhanced the inhibitory activity significantly. The 2-carbonyl substitution on the P3 indole was also found to be important to the inhibitory potency against SARS-CoV 3CL pro .\n\nReagents and solvents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Ind., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) and Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc. (Milwaukee, WI) and were used without further purification. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Merck Silica Gel 60F254 pre-coated plates. Preparative HPLC was performed using a C18 reverse-phase column (19 \u00c2 100 mm; Sun-Fire Prep C18 OBD\u00d4, 5 mm) with a binary solvent system: a linear gradient of CH 3 CN in 0.1% aqueous TFA at a flow rate of 6 mL/min. Compounds were detected at 254 nm and 230 nm. All solvents used for HPLC were HPLC-grade. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or better. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were obtained using a JEOL 400 MHz spectrometer, a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer (300 MHz), or a BRUKER AV600 spectrometer (600 MHz) with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard.

The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was subjected to flash chromatography (EtOAc/ MeOH \u00bc 9:1) to obtain the pure compound 18.\n\nThe characterization data for the compounds 17 and 18 are reported elsewhere [12e14]. \n\nTo a solution of 18 (0.200 g, 0.5 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 (3 mL) at 0 C was added TFA/H 2 O (10:1, 2 mL), and the solution was stirred for 1 h. After evaporating the solvent under reduced pressure, the corresponding deprotected lactam residue (0.100 g, 0.53 mmol) was coupled to the carboxylic acid 14a (0.136 g, 0.38 mmol) using the coupling agent HBTU (0.147 g, 0.38 mmol) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (0.050 mL, 0.38 mmol) in DMF (3 mL) at 0 C. After 5 min stirring, the ice bath was removed, and the solution was allowed to stir for 2 h under ambient conditions. The solvent was then evaporated under high vacuum, and the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (50 mL). The organic layer was washed with 5% citric acid (20 mL \u00c2 2), 5% NaHCO 3 (20 mL \u00c2 2), and brine (25 mL). The solution was dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to give compound 5a. Yield The compounds 5ber was synthesized from 18 with the 14ber using a procedure similar to that described for the preparation of 5a. \n\nThe crystal structure of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro protease in complex with a substrate analog inhibitor (coded 1WOF) [27] was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.rcsb.org/ pdb/home/home.do). Initially, a binding model of 5h with 3CL pro was simulated to form a basis for comparison with our previous lead 4 and substrate analogs, using molecular operating environment (MOE) software. Several minimization processes were performed using the MMFF94X force field to model the solvation environment surrounding the inhibitor. Structures having a relatively low binding free energy and a high number of cluster members were selected for the subsequent docking conformation optimization step. The minimized energies of 5h, obtained from the docking study, were \u00c041.49 and \u00c037.51 kcal/mol. The substrate analog was removed from the crystal structure and the docking studies were performed using 5c, 5q, and 5r according to a method similar to the method described for the 5h docking study.\n\nThe binding of 5h was studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter from MicroCal/GE Healthcare (Northampton, MA, USA). SARS-CoV 3CL pro and the inhibitor were dissolved in buffer composed of 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, and 1 mM EDTA with 2% DMSO. The titration was performed at 25 C by injecting 10 mL aliquots of protease solution into the calorimetric cell (volume w 1.4 mL) containing the inhibitor at a concentration of 6 mM. The concentration of protease in the syringe was 109 mM. The heat evolved upon each injection of protease was obtained from the integral of the calorimetric signal. The heat associated with inhibitor binding was obtained by subtracting the heat of dilution from the heat of reaction. The individual heats were plotted against the molar ratio, and the enthalpy change (DH) and association constant (K a \u00bc 1/K d ) were obtained by nonlinear regression of the data (see Fig. 4 )."}
