{"title": "Influenza A", "body": "The influenza viruses, which contain single-stranded RNA, are classified into 3 types, A, B, and C Dolin (2000) , Murray et al (2002) , Treanor (2005) . The virus has 8 segments and an enveloped nucleocapsid. Type A subtypes vary in type of hemagglutinin (H1, H2, or H3 subtype), the protein that is important for host cell attachment. Antibodies directed at the hemagglutinin provide human immunity to infection. In addition, the virus possesses either N1 or N2 neuraminidase (N subtype), which also assists viral entry into the host cell and elicits the production of neutralizing antibodies De Jong et al (2003) . Influenza is a highly communicable disease transmitted by aerosolized droplet-nuclei produced by coughing and/or sneezing, and by direct contact. All age groups are susceptible to this infection, although the very young, elderly, individuals with chronic medical complications, such as those with compromised pulmonary and cardiovascular conditions, kidney impairment, diabetes or immunosuppressive disorders, and pregnant women in the 2 nd and 3 rd trimester are at increased risk.\n\nAlthough the reservoir is primarily human, influenza A viruses have been documented in pigs, horses, seals, ducks, chickens, and whales. Certain subtypes of influenza A are species specific, although all subtypes have been documented in birds. Prominent human subtypes include H3N2, H2N2, H1N1 and H1N2. The influenza A virus has 15 distinct H and 9 distinct N subtypes, although H1, H2, and H3 and N1 and N2 are prominently associated with disease outbreaks in humans. Subtypes of influenza A viruses that are prominent in one species may on occasion infect and cause disease in another. In 1998, for example, the H3N2 subtype crossed from humans to pigs, causing serious disease in the swine population. In addition, influenza A viruses from birds can be transmitted to humans directly or indirectly by an intermediate host. In this way the 8 genetic elements of influenza A virus may reassort to form a new subtype (H*N*) against which humans not immune Schweiger et al (2002) . In this situation a worldwide pandemic can occur. Documented instances of avian influenza viruses infecting humans are numerous.\n\nInfluenza A is a single-stranded RNA virus that causes an acute and highly contagious upper respiratory disease.\n\nThe influenza A virus is a member of the family of viruses termed Orthomyxoviridae. These viruses have a single negative strand of RNA that consists of 8 separate segments, a nucleocapsid that is helical, and a viral specific RNA polymerase. Influenza viruses exit cells by budding from the host cell plasma membrane (enveloped), and possess two types of spike protein, neuraminidase [N] and hemagglutinin activity [H] , that emanate from the lipid envelope. The virus has an irregular but spherical shape and measures 80-120 nm in diameter.\n\nInfluenza illness is uncomplicated in an otherwise healthy and nonelderly adult. Most fatalities (0.1-1.0%) occur due to secondary bacterial infection of the respiratory tree. Although the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia is due to pneumococci, the most serious is due to staphylococcal infection. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes are other infrequent causes of pneumonia. The mortality rate is higher among the elderly, pregnant women, and those with other medical complications.\n\nInfluenza A infection is often confused with the common cold (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/ factsheets/cold.htm), which may have similar signs and symptoms (http://familydoctor. org/517.xml). Influenza A infection resembles numerous other mild febrile diseases but stands out due to cough, muscle aches, malaise, and ''sudden onset''. Other differential diseases include infections caused by RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, measles virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR agent), Bordetella pertussis, Salmonella typhi, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Influenza may be difficult to diagnose in the absence of an epidemic.\n\nThe etiologic agent of influenza, or the flu, is the influenza virus. The three types of virus are classified as A, B, and C. All types contain a single-stranded RNA that has 8 segments packaged into an enveloped nucleocapsid.\n\nThe influenza A virus is spread by droplet-nuclei from sneezing and coughing patients. The incidence parallels other upper respiratory infections that occur in northern frigid winter months (late autumn to early spring). Influenza A epidemics are cyclic and occur every 2-3 years. New epidemics occur because of antigenic drift or minor changes in the H and/or N antigens, thereby allowing the virus to avoid the immune system. The CDC collects and reports relevant surveillance data http://198.246.96.2/flu/weekly/fluactivity. htm.\n\nInfluenza A virus causes necrosis of the respiratory epithelium in the tracheobronchial tree and nasal turbinates. Desquamation of the ciliated epithelium, edema, hyperemia, increased secretions, and congestion may therefore result in a secondary bacterial infection. Laboratory findings include leukopenia and often proteinuria. The influenza A virus \n\nInfluenza A is a highly contagious disease marked by the acute onset of fever (102-104 F), severe aches and pains, prostration, inflammation of the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, and severe headache. In addition, the affected individual will show signs of coryza, nonproductive cough, flushed face, and sore throat. In children, nausea, vomiting, and otitis media are often reported. Fever should subside in 3-4 days and recovery is usually complete in one week, although malaise and cough may continue for 2 weeks or more. The normal incubation period is 1-4 days, with an average of 2 days. Adults are contagious from the day prior to symptoms for up to 5 days after the onset of illness. Immunocompromised patients shed virus for weeks or months.\n\nThe treatment for influenza A infections is aimed at the control of virus spread by immunization Stohr (2003), Weycker et al (2005) . Chemoprophylaxis for pregnant women and compromised patients can be accomplished with amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, or oseltamivir Hayden (2001), Schmidt (2004) . Antipyretics and analgesics are typically used for the symptomatic relief of fever and myalgia. \n\nOlder nursing-home residents should be administered only 100 mg/day of rimantadine. A reduction in dosage to 100 mg/day should be considered for all persons aged 65 years, if they experience possible side effects when taking 200 mg/day. *** Zanarnivir is administered through inhalation by using a plastic device included in the medication package. Patients will benefit from instruction and demonstration of correct use of the device.\n\nZanarnivir is not approved for prophylaxis. }}} A reduction in the dose of oseltamivir is recommended for persons with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min.\n\nThe dose recommendation for children who weigh 15 kg is 30 mg twice a day. For children who weigh >15-23 kg, the dose is 45 mg twice a day. For children who weigh >23-40 kg, the dose is 60 mg twice a day. And, for children who weigh >40 kg, the dose is 75 mg twice a day. 1-40) . The terminology for influenza viruses is directly related to the type of virus, the origin or place it was first located, and the year of its discovery. The immunity invoked by influenza vaccine generally lasts 6-12 months. Amantadine Amantadine is active against influenza A viruses but not influenza B. It was approved in 1966 for chemoprophylaxis and in 1976 for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza type A virus in both adults and children 1 year of age. Amantadine may cause central nervous system side effects (13%), including anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, light headedness, and concentration difficulty, and gastrointestinal side effects (1-3%), including nausea and anorexia, at dosages of 200 mg/day. Because its effects on pregnant women and their fetuses are unknown, it should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risks. Drug resistance develops in approximately one-third of patients, with cross resistance to rimantadine. Maximum blood levels are attained within 4 hours of administration of a single 100 mg dose. The peak excretion rate of amantadine is 5 mg/hr, and the mean half-life of the excretion rate is approximately 15 hours. Clearance of amantadine is reduced 2-3-fold in adults with renal insufficiency. In otherwise healthy elderly adults (65 years) the renal clearance is reduced and plasma levels therefore increased. The drug, like rimantidine, influences viral uptake by preventing membrane fusion and affects maturation of the hemagglutinin (H) to lower the infectivity of progeny virus. It is 70-90% effective in preventing illness in healthy adults and, if administered for prophylaxis within 2 days of illness, can reduce flu symptoms and shorten the duration of the illness by 1 or 2 days. Rimantadine Rimantadine is effective against influenza A but not influenza B viruses. It was approved in 1993 for the treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza A infections in adults and prophylaxis in children. Some consider it appropriate for the treatment of disease in children. Rimantadine may cause central nervous system side effects (6%), including anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, light headedness and concentration difficulty, and gastrointestinal side effects (1-3%) such as nausea and anorexia, at dosages of 200 mg/day. Because its effects on pregnant women and their fetuses are unknown, it should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risks. Drug resistance develops in approximately one-third of patients, with cross resistance to amantadine. Rimantadine is 70-90% effective in preventing illness in healthy adults and, if administered for prophylaxis within 2 days of illness, can reduce flu symptoms and shorten the duration of the illness by 1-2 days.\n\nZanamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor that is active against both influenza A and B viruses. It was approved in 1999 for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza infections in patients aged 7 years. Guidelines and recommendations for its use can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/treatment/ 0405antiviralguide.htm. As its effects on pregnant women and their fetuses are unknown, it should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risks. Resistance to zanamivir during treatment may occur, but does not happen frequently. Oseltamivir Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor that is active against both influenza A and B viruses. It was approved in 1999 for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza infections in patients aged 1 year. In 2000 it was approved for the chemoprophylaxis of influenza infections in persons aged 13 years. Guidelines and recommendations for its use can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/ professionals/treatment/0405antiviralguide.htm. As its effects on pregnant women and their fetuses are unknown, it should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risks. Resistance to oseltamivir during treatment may occur, but does not happen frequently.\n\nNasal Spray.\n\nVaccine Bacteria from fermented milk were incorporated into a nasal spray and used as a preventive treatment for influenza in mice Hori et al (2001) . Killed Lactobacillus casei were used in an intranasal spray to stimulate the immune response in the respiratory tract. Treated mice had one-tenth the amount of virus in their nasal cavities after virus challenge, resulting in a four times greater survival rate.\n\nThe mouse model for influenza is used for the evaluation of vaccines and antiviral drugs Sidwell and Smee (2000) . In addition, the ferret is a natural host for this virus, with the ensuing illness closely resembling the human condition Maher and DeStefano (2004) .\n\nBasic information on the diagnosis, clinical findings, complications, prevention and treatment of influenza, including vaccine safety recommendations, can be found at: http://www3.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=17572#17572 Information on the common cold and flu can be located at: http://familydoctor.org/517. xml Further information on the common cold and flu can be located at: http://www.niaid.nih. gov/factsheets/cold.htm A chapter on antiviral chemotherapy can be found at: http://www.med.sc.edu:85/lecture/ chemo.htm Detailed information on influenza viruses can be located at: http://www3.accessmedicine. com/content.aspx?aID=74879&searchStr=influenza+a+virus#74879"}
