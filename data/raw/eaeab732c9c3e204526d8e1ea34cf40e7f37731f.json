{"title": "Plasma and tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity and plasma equilibrium concentrations of angiotensin peptides in dogs with heart disease", "body": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of heart disease and heart failure in dogs. [1] [2] [3] [4] The traditional concept of the RAAS is as follows: cardiac disease, as well as treatments for cardiac disease, such as diuretics, decrease perfusion of the kidney, activating release of renin, which converts angiotensinogen to the 10-amino acid peptide, angiotensin I (AT1 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ). Subsequently, the dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), cleaves 2 amino acids from the C-terminus of AT1 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) to form the octapeptide, angiotensin II (AT2 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] ). Angiotensin II acts primarily through angiotensin receptor type 1 and causes potent vasoconstriction, sodium and water conservation, aldosterone release, and myocardial remodeling. 5 Thus, the traditional view of the RAAS is that of a linear and maladaptive pathological system that is overactive during heart failure and often suppressed using ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and aldosterone antagonists. This understanding changed with the discovery of a homologue of ACE, called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 6, 7 Like ACE, ACE2 is a membrane-bound zinc metalloproteinase; the catalytic site of which is capable of binding various angiotensin peptides (APs), such as AT2 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . However, ACE2 is a mono-carboxypeptidase and it removes only a single amino acid from the C-terminus of its catalytic substrate. 8, 9 For example, ACE2 acts on AT1(1-10) and AT2 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) to produce a 9-amino acid peptide called angiotensin 1-9 (Ang1-9) and a 7-amino acid peptide called angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7), respectively. 10 Despite being different by only 1 amino acid, the biological effects of Ang1-9 and Ang1-7 are opposite of those associated with AT2 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Specifically, Ang1-9 and Ang1-7 are vasodilatory, natriuretic, diuretic, antifibrotic, and antiremodeling. 9 These beneficial APs mediate the majority of their effects by binding to angiotensin receptor type 2 or an endogenous orphan Mas receptor (MasR), as opposed to binding to ATR1. 11, 12 It is now known 9,13 that the ACE2 system provides an endogenous counterbalance to ACE and that an expanded view of the RAAS involves many different APs with structures differing by 1 to 5 amino acids. Thus, RAAS is considerably more complex than those traditionally viewed, and this discovery has uncovered a broad new set of molecules to explore, understand, and potentially modify in subjects with heart disease.\n\nVery little is known about the ACE2 system and related APs in veterinary species. To the best of our knowledge, studies of ACE2 in dogs with naturally occurring heart disease are lacking. We sought to detect and describe the location of ACE2 immunoreactivity in the kidney and left ventricular (LV) myocardium to quantify the activity of plasma, kidney, and LV myocardial ACE2, to determine the equilibrium concentrations of 10 different circulating APs, and to determine the effect of recombinant human ACE2 on the relative amounts of beneficial versus maladaptive APs. Our hypotheses were that the evidence of ACE2 could be found in tissues and plasma of dogs, that equilibrium concentrations of RAAS APs would differ in dogs with heart disease versus healthy dogs, and recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) can alter relative concentrations of APs.\n\nThe study protocol was reviewed and approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and informed owner consent was obtained.\n\nCohorts of dogs that died or were euthanized for cardiac diseases and dogs that died from noncardiac reasons at the University of Pennsylvania were recruited. Sections of left kidney that included both cortical and medullary tissue and full thickness LV myocardial samples from the lateral wall of the ventricle just apical to the mid-point of the paraconal coronary artery were obtained within 60 minutes of death.\n\nKidney and myocardial samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for up to 72 hours followed by sectioning. A rabbit polyclonal primary antibody against ACE2 (ARP53751-P050, Aviva Systems Biology, San Diego, California) was used at a dilution of 1:1200 and incubated on the sections for 45 minutes at room temperature (RT).\n\nA biotin-free polymeric IHC detection system consisting of horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG then was applied for 25 minutes at RT. Finally, slides were counterstained in hematoxylin, scanned (Leica Aperio Versa slide scanner, Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, Illinois), and images acquired (ImageScope, Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, Illinois). Additional details regarding IHC methods can be found in the Supporting Information.\n\nA cohort of dogs >3 years of age with active or previous congestive heart failure (CHF) caused by degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) was prospectively recruited. Criteria for DMVD included a left apical systolic murmur and echocardiographic evidence of thickened or prolapsing mitral valve leaflets and mitral regurgitation. Echocardiographic examinations (iE33, Philips Healthcare, Andover, Massachusetts) recorded left ventricular internal dimension at end diastole (LVIDdN) and end-systole (LVIDsN) from the 2-dimensional (2D) right short axis view, which were then normalized to body weight using previously reported formulas. 14 The left atrium-to-aortic root ratio (LA:Ao) was calculated using measurements from the 2D right short axis. 15 Echocardiographic values were the average value of 3 measured beats. Healthy dogs that primarily were owned by staff and employees of the veterinary hospital were recruited as a control group and included dogs without a heart murmur or clinical signs suggestive of heart disease. Control dogs weighing >25 kg had a 2D echocardiogram performed to exclude the potential for occult dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Venipuncture was performed, and lithium heparinized plasma samples were obtained. Samples were stored at \u221280 C until batch analysis. Activity of ACE2 in heparinized plasma was measured using a fluorometric assay kit (#K897-100, Biovision Inc, Milpitas, California). The ACE2 activity results are reported in milliunits per mg protein (mU/mg). The assay has a lower detection limit of 0.4 mU. Additional details regarding the performance and validation of the assay are described in the Supporting Information.\n\nA cohort of dogs that died or were euthanized as a consequence of cardiac disease and dogs that died of noncardiac diseases were recruited to obtain kidney and LV myocardial samples as previously described.\n\nKidney and LV myocardium lysates were prepared by homogenizing approximately 100 \u03bcg tissue sections in ACE2 lysis buffer (Biovision Inc) using a disposable tissue homogenizer (#0254210, Fisher Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts). Lysates were kept on ice for 10 minutes followed by gentle vortexing followed by another 5 minutes on ice. The tissue lysates then were centrifuged at 16 000g at 4 C for 10 minutes and the pellets discarded. Activity of ACE2 in tissue lysates was measured using the same fluorometric assay kit used to assay plasma ACE2 activity. The protein concentrations of the plasma and tissue lysates were measured using a bicinchoninic acid method and bovine serum albumin protein standard (#K813, Biovision Inc).\n\nA cohort of dogs >3 years of age with DMVD or DCM that were either preclinical (ie, asymptomatic) or had CHF were recruited. Criteria for diagnosis of DMVD were the same as those for dogs recruited for study of plasma ACE2 activity assay. Criteria for diagnosis of DCM were presence of systolic dysfunction and LV eccentric hypertrophy on echocardiography defined as LVIDsN and LVIDdN above the normal reference range in the absence of an identifiable cardiac cause. A previously reported clinical staging system for dogs with DMVD 16 was mod- \n\nDescriptive statistics for the various patient groups were generated.\n\nNormality was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Nonparametric tests were used if data were not normally distributed. Data that were below the lower limit of quantification for any particular assay were entered as a value equal to 0.5 times the lower limit of quantification as previously recommended. 21 The presence of any extreme outlying data points was identified by the Grubbs' test, which restricts potential removal to \u22641 data point from each data set. 22 Differences between 2 unpaired groups were tested using Wilcoxon rank sum or unpaired t tests. Differences across \u22653 groups were tested using Kruskal-Wallis or 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc pairwise comparisons were performed using Dunn's test with correction for multiple comparisons or Bonferroni correction, respectively.\n\nBox and whisker plots were constructed with the line representing the median value, the limits of the box representing the 25th and 75th percentiles, and the whiskers extending to the 5th and 95th percentiles. Correlations among various patient demographic data, echocardiographic variables, and assay results were explored using Pearson correlation coefficient or Spearman rho and unadjusted P values.\n\nConcentrations of APs before and after administration of rhACE2 were evaluated by Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Data are shown as median (interquartile range), unless otherwise specified. Statistical procedures were performed using statistical software (Prism 8 for OS X, GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, California). Significance was defined as P < .05. Figure 2 ). This result was consistent regardless of whether or not the outlier value was included in the analysis. No significant correlation was found between ACE2 activity and age (R 2 = .057, P = .34) or body weight (Spearman r = \u2212.092, P = .72) in the healthy cohort. Figure 3 ). This result was the same regardless of whether or not the outlier value was included in the analysis. The ACE2 activity per milligram of protein in kidney tissue was approximately 250 to 500 times higher than circulating or LV myocardial ACE2 activity.\n\nAssays for circulating and tissue ACE2 activity were performed on average 10 days (range, 3-29) after the date of sample collection.\n\nT A B L E 1 Signalment and existing treatments in 33 dogs undergoing assessment of plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity, including healthy dogs and dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF) because of degenerative mitral valve disease.

Table 2 . Differences in concentrations across and between groups were detected for a number of APs, including AT1(1-10), Ang1-7, Ang1-9, Ang2-10, Ang2-7, and Ang3-7 (Table 3 ). In general, the concentration of each of these APs was highest in dogs in stage C, intermediate in stage B1 or B2, and lowest in healthy dogs (Figure 4) .\n\nA global overview of the expanded RAAS identified large differences in the overall activation and relative amounts of APs across patient groups ( Figure 5 ). Of note, median AT1(1-10) was >43 and 17 times higher in stage C than healthy and stage B2 dogs, respectively.\n\nMedian Ang1-7 in stage C was > 43 and 11 times higher than in healthy and stage B2 dogs, respectively, and median Ang1-9 in stage C was >5 times higher than in both healthy and stage B1 or B2 dogs.\n\nNo differences across groups were found for AT2 Table 3 ). The median ACE surr also was significantly different across patient groups ( Figure 6 ). The median ACE surr in stage C was 16 to 20 times lower than that in healthy dogs or dogs in stages B1 or B2 (Table 3) \n\nThe discovery of ACE2 and its related APs ( Figure 8 ) is a subject of intense study in humans with heart disease, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] and to our knowledge, our study is the first to provide an expanded view of RAAS in dogs with heart disease. Our results identify ACE2 immunolabeling and activity in canine LV myocardium. Previous reports in rats 28 and humans 6,28 indicated similar findings, suggesting an important role for ACE2 in cardiac function. Strong immunolabeling and a high degree of ACE2 activity also was found in the renal tubular epithelium, consistent with previous studies in dogs, 29 mice, 30 and humans. 6, 7 Our results indicate that the ACE2 system is regulated differently in dogs with heart disease as compared to healthy dogs. First, plasma ACE2 activity was significantly increased in dogs with CHF, similar to previous reports in human patients with heart disease. In 1 such study, 31 serum ACE2 activity was significantly increased secondary to ischemic and nonischemic heart disease and was independent of medications or comorbidities. In other studies, 32-34 serum ACE2 activity was positively correlated with echocardiographic heart size, negatively correlated with heart function, and was independently associated with important clinical events, including death or hospitalization. The role of circulating or soluble ACE2, as opposed to tissue-bound ACE2, is not fully understood. As previously mentioned, ACE2 is an integral membrane-bound protein and the balance of tissue versus circulating ACE2 is mediated by membrane metalloproteinases that cleave portions of the cell membrane, which then are released into the surrounding extracellular space. 33, 35, 36 The resultant ectosomes contain ACE2 as well as the immediate surrounding extracellular environment and enter the circulation or urine. This process is described as ectodomain shedding. 36, 37 Previous studies 35 indicate that shedding of ACE2 is more frequent than shedding of ACE, which also is highly membrane bound, and that AT2(1-8), tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1\u03b2, and disintegrin metalloproteases are potent stimuli for ACE2 shedding in mice and humans. [37] [38] [39] Thus, the increase in circulating ACE2 might represent pathological displacement of ACE2 from its normal tissue membrane location, mediated in part by a feedback loop in which various substances decrease the activity of its negative regulator. 39 As a result, circulating ACE2, which is removed from its normal location and ideal environment, is hypothesized to represent wasted or ineffective ACE2. 31, 39 In our study, activity of circulating ACE2 normalized to protein amount was approximately 100-fold less than activity of kidney ACE2, which supports this hypothesis. Our results, however, also indicated that both the kidney and LV ACE2 activity were not significantly different in dogs with CHF as compared to healthy dogs, suggesting that ACE2 shedding was not an important factor in the total extent of tissue-bound ACE2 activity, but a loss of tissue ACE2 into the circulation would tend to decrease the overall compensatory potential of ACE2. 31, 33, 39 Further elucidation of a seemingly complex relationship between circulating and tissue ACE2 is needed.\n\nA second important finding of our study is the relationships and relative concentrations of various APs within the expanded RAAS, which provides insight into the pathophysiology of disease. Beginning at the first portion of RAAS (Figure 8 ), our results indicate that heart disease in the dog is associated with increased plasma renin activity. This finding is consistent with previous reports in dogs 1, 40 and leads to higher concentrations of AT1 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) .
