{"title": "Catalog of supplementary information", "body": ". Characteristics of some major human infectious diseases, divided into two sets: ones predominantly tropical or of tropical origin, and ones regularly occurring at temperate as well as tropical latitudes. Column 1: * = a crowd disease of large human populations (see text). Column 2: the pathogen causing the disease. Column 3: whether transmitted to humans by an animal vector, or else directly from another human and if so by what means (breathed-out air = aerosol, sexual, skin contact, etc.). Column 4: approximate duration, from infection until death or recovery. Column 5: case-fatality ratio in traditional human populations without modern medical treatment or nutrition (from ref. S1 and other sources). Column 6: whether patients who recover thereby develop long-lasting or lifetime immunity against re-infection. Columns 7 and 8: whether the pathogen has a reservoir apart from infected humans, either in the environment or in animals (from ref. S2 and other sources). The term \"reservoir\" means a non-human source of pathogens immediately capable of infecting humans without evolutionary change. Reservoirs may enable a pathogen to persist even in the absence of a susceptible human population large enough by itself to sustain the pathogen. Column 9: our tentative conclusion about the most likely source from which the pathogen reached humans. Column 10: to which of the five evolutionary stages explained in Box 1 we assign the disease. See Notes S1, S2, and S9 for further explanation, and for details and references on each disease. Note S1. Choice of diseases.\n\nIn the text and in Table S1 we attempted to select for analysis 25 infectious diseases of the greatest evolutionary and historical significance. While everyone would agree that such a list should include smallpox, measles, tuberculosis, and falciparum malaria, some other choices pose a gray area, and other scientists might arrive at a list somewhat different from ours. The considerations behind our choices were as follows:\n\nOne consideration is current mortality, which immediately leads to the inclusion of falciparum malaria and tuberculosis. In addition, not just mortality, but also non-fatal morbidity,\n\ncan be historically and evolutionarily significant. For instance, syphilis has caused high frequency of sterility in some populations, such as Andaman Islanders. While rubella causes only modest postnatal mortality, it causes up to 90% incidence of fetal malformation or death in fetuses of mothers infected during the first trimester of pregnancy. A widely used measure of a disease's mortality and morbidity is its so-called DALY score (disability-adjusted life years): \"a health gap measure that extends the concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death to include equivalent years of healthy life lost by virtue of individuals being in states of poor health or disability\" S3 . \"One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of healthy life, and the burden of disease as a measure of the gap between current health status and an ideal situation where everyone lives into old age free from disease and disability\" S4 .\n\nLopez et al. S4 2. Three of the high DALY scores of Lopez et al. S4 were not assigned by them to specific microbes but to \"wastebasket categories\" of shared symptoms caused by many different microbes, whose relative contributions are often poorly understood and not separately diagnosed in many or most individual cases. From the category \"lower respiratory disease,\" we adopted influenza virus as the single microbe making the largest contribution; the other major causes are commensals that are often not specifically diagnosed. From the category \"diarrheal diseases,\" we adopted rotavirus A as the single microbe making the largest contribution, followed at a distance by cholera; other notable diarrheal agents include Escherichia coli strains, Campylobacter, Shigella, Salmonella, Giardia, and Entamoeba histolytica, but they are usually lumped under the diagnosis of \"diarrhea\" and their individual contributions are poorly known. From the category \"meningitis,\" we adopted no microbes; its leading causes are respiratory commensals.\n\n3. Lopez et al. S4 attributed a DALY score to \"malaria,\" without distinguishing among the four human malarias. We adopted falciparum malaria because it is by far the most important human malaria, and also vivax malaria because its estimated contribution to malarial morbidity would give it a DALY score within the top seven tropical diseases, although towards the lower end.\n\n4. Lopez et al. S4 attribute a DALY score to \"trypanosomiasis\" exclusive of Chagas' disease (New World trypanosomiasis), i.e., African sleeping sickness. Our Table S1 lists West and East African sleeping sickness separately, because they differ markedly in duration, role of animal reservoir, and disease stage, and are considered different subspecies of one microbe species.\n\n5. Lopez et al. S4 attribute a DALY score to \"leishmaniases.\" Our Table S1 specifically lists only visceral leishmaniasis, the form imposing the heaviest burden; New World and especially Old World cutaneous leishmaniases impose much lower burdens.\n\nThe DALY scores of Lopez et al. S4 thus led to our including 17 microbial diseases. But considerations of historical mortality support inclusion of eight other diseases that formerly were major killers and ceased to be so only recently: smallpox now eradicated, and plague, typhoid, typhus, yellow fever, mumps, diphtheria, and rubella now greatly decreased, due to modern populations than in contemporary European populations for several reasons: the former populations' lack of acquired immunity arising from previous individual exposure, lack of genetic resistance arising from historical exposure of the population, and first exposure in adulthood whereas most Europeans became exposed in childhood (some diseases such as measles, rubella, and hepatitis B cause higher mortality in adults than in children). Conversely, we also include several diseases that cause major mortality today but whose global toll in the past was either zero (AIDS) or considerably lower (cholera, dengue fever).\n\nLikely origins. Conclusions about the animal sources of a particular human microbe are obviously limited by testing bias --i.e., which animal species were selected for testing, and which pathogens were sought in them. Given that fact, a certain animal microbe currently considered to be the closest match to a corresponding human microbe might not be its closest relative at all; the true animal ancestor could eventually prove to be a microbe found in some animal species not yet studied. This is clearly true for rubella virus; its confinement to large human populations shows that it must have evolved within the last 11,000 years, and is thus likely still to bear a close relationship to some ancestral animal microbe, yet rubella virus has no remotely close relatives among known microbes, implying that we have not yet found its close animal relative. In the case of Plasmodium reichenowi of chimpanzees, we know of its existence just from one isolate; if that isolate hadn't been found, we would not know the closest relative of human P. falciparum. At present, it appears that smallpox is most closely related to camelpox, but that conclusion is tentative because there might be some more closely-related poxviruses still awaiting discovery. Camelpox itself might prove to be a misnomer; the virus has been isolated from camels but has rarely been sought in other species. It is of note that the identity of the We separate diseases into these two categories, based on their distributions and likely origins. There is little uncertainty about the 10 diseases that we denote as \"tropical\": nine are still largely confined to the tropics (although vivax malaria and yellow fever have also caused some seasonal outbreaks in areas within temperate latitudes), cholera arose in tropical Southeast\n\nAsia although in recent centuries it has spread to cause epidemics in temperate latitudes, and AIDS now occurs independently of latitude but is known to have arisen recently in tropical\n\nAfrica. While the 15 diseases that we denote as \"temperate\" appear or appeared regularly at temperate latitudes, most also appear or appeared in the tropics as well. Most are evidently of Old World origin, but their latitude of origin is generally unknown. This separation of 10 \"tropical\" from 15 \"temperate\" (or to be more precise, temperate plus tropical) diseases still permits us to discern numerous differences between these two groups of diseases, discussed in the text. Was this conclusion, that most major human diseases belong to Stage 5 or Stage 4, just a fore-ordained outcome and a consequence of circular logic? For instance, one might reason \u00e0 priori that that outcome was inevitable, e.g. because human-to-human contact will always be more frequent than animal-to-human contact, and because confinement of a pathogen to humans implies long evolutionary time for a pathogen to evolve special virulence for humans. More often, though, authors have used \u00e0 priori reasoning to predict exactly the opposite outcome: \"The received wisdom, set forth in most medical texts and elsewhere, is that 'successful' or 'welladapted' parasites are relatively harmless to their hosts\u2026that it is clearly in the interest of the parasite population not to harm its host population too much\" (ref. S8, p. 648 pathogen damages its host is often but not always linked to the mechanism by which the pathogen becomes transmitted.\n\nOur data base permits a test of these predictions. Nine of our 14 Stage-5 diseases, but also two of our non-Stage-5 diseases, sicken or kill their victims by causing a host reaction that serves to transmit the pathogen (diarrhea in the cases of typhoid and rotavirus, respiratory inflammation with coughing and sneezing in the cases of measles and pertussis and five other diseases). Conversely, five of our Stage-5 diseases, and nine of our non-Stage-5 diseases, sicken or kill by mechanisms unrelated to the pathogen's mode of transmission (e.g., sexual in the cases of AIDS and syphilis and hepatitis B, via an insect vector in the cases of malarias and yellow fever \n\nHoping that we shall not look foolish in 10 years, we offer some speculations about new major diseases of the future. While the principles of pathogen transmission have not changed during the last 11,000 years, changing modern conditions are exposing us to new pathogen reservoirs and new modes of transmission. The world is now different from ancient Eurasia, in which most people were farmers and herders in close contact with domestic animals, and in which many of our 25 major diseases of Table S1 evolved. Here are some of our guesses.\n\nFirst, here is our opinion about which microbes will not become the next big killers. We believe that some pathogens arouse fear and attract resources out of proportion to their real threat to humanity. In particular, case-fatality ratio is often mistakenly equated with danger, but some pathogens greatly feared for their proven ability to kill a few hundred people are too inefficiently is hard to imagine our killing millions of our children's beloved puppies, bunnies, and kittens and of our village hunting dogs, even if those animals did offer a likely entry portal for a dangerous pathogen. Hence monitoring for the emergence of new STD's and pet-associated diseases would both be good investments.\n\nStill other opportunities exist for novel pathogens to emerge from the big and oftendiscussed changes associated with modern human societies (see Table 1 Although we do have a vaccine against yellow fever, most of the world's human population remains unvaccinated (e.g., because of the disease's still-unexplained absence from Asia), so that a yellow fever epidemic especially in China or India could be devastating. Global warming is causing tropical birds and arthropods to expand their ranges into temperate zones S13 . As tropical arboviruses and arthropod vectors join the ranks of those expanding species, we anticipate temperate flare-ups of many diseases now dismissed as \"just\" tropical.\n\nAll these examples illustrate that future disease control efforts must not only continue the traditional approaches to combating on-going pandemics but must also place more emphasis on \"disease forecasting,\" the early detection of novel pandemics. As summarized in this review, \n\nHIV-1 is derived from Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIVcpz), found in chimpanzees (subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes) S14 . The cross-species transmission of SIVcpz and its subsequent adaptation to humans most likely occurred by the early 20 th century S15 . This crossspecies transmission occurred in western equatorial Africa, inferred from viral diversity and the presence there of SIVcpz strains most similar to HIV-1 strains S15 . SIVcpz has crossed into humans on at least three or four occasions, distinguished by phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1. There remains disagreement about the wider phylogenetics of trypanosomes; although Lukes et al. S20 , Stevens and Gibson S21 , and Hamilton et al. S22 have argued for monophyly, Hughes and Piontkivska S19, S23 have used their 18S rRNA work to maintain the idea that trypanosomes are paraphyletic.\n\nVibrio cholerae is mostly closely related to Vibrio mimicus S25 . V. cholerae has been found on aquatic algae, crustaceans, copepods, and amoebae S26 , although birds S27, S28 and terrestrial herbivores S29 can also harbor the pathogen. The GbpA binding protein, which helps V.\n\ncholerae bind to the chitinous exoskeletons of zooplankton, also appears to help the bacteria colonize the intestines of larger fauna S30 Martin et al. S35 determined via ribosomal protein and RNA that Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causative agent of diphtheria, is most closely related to C. pseudotuberculosis and C. ulcerans, and less closely to C. vitaruminis and C. kutscheri. C. pseudotuberculosis S36 and C. ulcerans S35 are known to infect domestic animals and livestock, including cows, horses, goats, and sheep. In addition, pathogenic C. ulcerans has been isolated from ground squirrels S37 and otters S38 . Voles are susceptible to C. kutscheri S39 . \n\nThe origin and evolution of hepatitis B virus are still contested. The phylogenetic tree prepared by Simmonds S44 suggests that human hepatitis B viruses are closely related to ape HBVs, with strains found in chimpanzees, orangutans, gibbons, and gorillas. Analysis of a region of the S gene shows human strains clustering with a chimpanzee strain and all other S47 , Robertson's tree shows a woolly monkey strain of HBV closely related to human HBV type F, found in the New World; perhaps the former represents a recent transfer from humans. \n\nThe trypanosomes responsible for sleeping sickness are T. brucei rhodesiense (East Africa) and T. brucei gambiense (West and Central Africa). These two forms differ so markedly in duration of disease (much longer for West than East African sleeping sickness) and in the importance of animal-to-human transmission (far more frequent for East African sleeping sickness than for West African sleeping sickness, which tends to be maintained in human populations) that our paper analyzes them separately. T. brucei brucei is not thought to be pathogenic in humans S91 . MacLeod et al., using S92-S94 and domestic S95-S99 ruminants are the principal reservoirs.\n\nSmallpox is caused by variola virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus in the family Poxviridae S16 . Several analyses of gene families S100 , protein sequences S100 , and genomes S101-S103 have shown that, of the known orthopoxviruses, variola virus is most closely related to camelpox. In one study, however, a variola-specific PCR picked up only cowpox isolates, and not camelpox or other isolates S104 . One personal communication suggests that the closest extant relative of variola is tatera poxvirus, which affects African gerbils S105 , although Fenner notes that this and other poxviruses have not been well-studied S106 . In their recent genomic analysis of variola and other orthopoxvirus strains, Esposito et al. S107 Orthopoxvirus genus has a broad host range, but it has been suggested that the genus's origins are in African rodents, and it seems possible that camelpox, smallpox, and cowpox represent the adaptation of rodent poxviruses to domestic animals and humans. Monkeypox and cowpox, despite their names, are mainly diseases of rodents that occasionally infect monkeys and cows.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that unlike some other orthopoxviruses, smallpox and camelpox have only been isolated from their currently known hosts (i.e. humans and camels). The origin of venereal syphilis and its relationship to other treponemes has been obscured by several factors: treponemal isolates are difficult to propagate in the lab, clear paleopathological evidence of disease is scant and has been subject to debate, and the pathogenic treponemes are serologically and morphologically indistinct. As a result, no consensus has emerged on the geography or the timing of the appearance of the different diseases.\n\nMuch of the work done to establish the origin of venereal syphilis has relied on paleopathological evidence -or the absence thereof -to diagnose the condition in antiquity.\n\nRothschild S108 concluded from analyses of skeletal remains that the venereal form of T. pallidum was present in the pre-Columbian New World and could be reliably distinguished from conditions like yaws and bejel, but other researchers disagree. There is evidence of syphilitic skeletons in the Old World, including remains in England S109 that predate Columbus' voyage.\n\nTreponemes, including some T. pallidum subspecies, are known to infect nonhuman primates as well as humans. In the 1960s and 1970s, serosurveys of baboons and other primates in yaws-endemic regions of West and Central Africa revealed numerous foci of treponematosis with standard human treponemal assays S110-S112 , but few isolates were preserved. Genes from one simian isolate were recently sequenced, and appeared most closely related to T. pallidum pertenue ; a pathogenic treponeme from rabbits, T. paraluiscuniculi, was also sequenced and found to be more distantly related S113, S114 . Additional molecular studies of human and animal treponemes may help inform the debate over the origins and evolution of pathogenic strains. \n\nTetanus (lockjaw) is caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which is commonly found in soil and in intestines of animals and humans, and may be present in animal feces. It is usually transmitted to adults through contamination of wounds. Effective vaccines are routinely used in much of the world. In the case of neonates, birth on a soil surface S115 , nonsterile umbilical cord treatment, including the application of animal dung S116 or dung-contaminated ghee S117 , and circumcision S118 are risk factors. GEOGRAPHIC ORIGIN: Probably Old World S124 , but independent, New World origins are also debated.\n\nUsing tuf and atpD genes, as well as 16S and 23S Rrna S125 , and 24 chromosomal loci S126 , Salmonella enterica typhi (aka S. typhi) was shown to be closely related to S. paratyphi A.\n\nWhile the latter, as well as more distantly related strains of S. paratyphi, can infect mammals and birds and occasionally humans, S. typhi is particularly specialized to humans S126 . Selander et al.\n\ndiscuss several temporal and geographic evolutionary scenarios S126 ; Frankel et al. S127 posited an Indonesian origin of S. typhi, but an African or other geographic origin is also possible S126,128 .\n\nAbout 3% of infected people become chronic carriers. \n\nRickettsia prowazekii is the pathogen that causes epidemic human typhus; related rickettsiae of animals also infect humans. Andersson et al. S129 , using spacer regions and 23S rRNA, and Lee et al. S130 , using gro-EL gene analysis, found R. prowazekii to be closely related to R. typhi, which causes murine typhus and can also infect humans. R. prowazekii also infects flying squirrels S123, S131 , and R. typhi is common among rodents and may also be found in game birds S123 . Another member of the typhus group rickettsiae, R. felis, has been isolated from North American opossums S132 . The presence of R. prowazekii and related species in North American squirrels has been taken to suggest New World origins, but the global distribution of epidemic and murine typhus, and the ability of R. prowazekii to be spread among humans without the need for another host species, make geographic origins difficult to determine. \n\nReconstruction of the evolutionary history of Plasmodium vivax was initially obscured by several apparently conflicting pieces of evidence from genetic diversity of African and Asian types, malaria-resistant phenotypes common among human populations in Africa, and close genetic similarity to a New World species (P. simium). Several recent studies converge on an Asian origin of Plasmodium vivax, probably from macaques S133-S135 , although the timing of the adaptation of P. vivax to humans remains unresolved. Escalante et al. S134 constructed a phylogeny from one plastid gene and two nuclear genes, while Jongwutiwes et al. S133 and Mu et al. S135 used mitochondrial genome sequences in their analyses.\n\nSouth America appear to serve as the primary hosts for sylvatic cycles of yellow fever S136 , although other forest mammals may also carry the virus S137 . The viruses ancestral to yellow fever appear to have originated in the Old World, probably Africa S138 . "}
