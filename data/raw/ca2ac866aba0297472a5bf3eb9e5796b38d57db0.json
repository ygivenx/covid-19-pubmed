Although natu ral glycopeptide antibiotics do not exhibit pronounced antiviral activity in such tests, chemical removal of sugars and introduction of hydrophobic residues into resulting aglycons or pseudo aglycons generates hydrophobic derivatives that are active against some viruses.\n\nTogether with vancomycin and teicoplanin, the gly copeptide antibiotic eremomycin ( Fig. 1) can be used as original compounds for developing a new generation of antiviral agents [11, 12, 16] that represent non nucleoside inhibitors of RNA replicase. Preliminary findings showed that glycopeptide aglycon derivatives act at the entry [11, 17] and post entry [14] stages of the virus infection cycle. The processes of virus penetration into the host cell and its replication provided by specific interactions between viral structural or non structural (co)receptors. The mechanisms of the antiviral activity of glycopeptide agly con derivatives remain unclear. Virus entry to the cell and its life cycle depend on the use of intracellular signal transduction pathways. On these grounds, we screened several hydrophobic glycopeptide aglycon derivatives for their inhibitory activity against a panel of PKs.\n\nChemicals from Sigma Aldrich (USA) and ProQinase (Germany) were used.\n\nCompound library. Eremomycin was obtained from the pilot plant of Gause Institute of New Antibiotics (Moscow, Russia). Teicoplanin and teicoplanin aglycon (1) were kindly provided by Dr. R. Ciabatti and Dr. A. Malabarba (both from Biosearch S.p.A. Gerenzano, Italy). Teicoplanin aglycon derivatives n decylamide (2), 6 amino n heptyl 1 amide (3), 10 amino n decylamide (4), p (N,N di n butyl)benzylamide (5), p n butylben zyl n heptylamide (6), N 1 adamantyl oxycarbonyl derivative (7), N 1 adamantyl oxycarbonyl cyclopropyl amide (8), N t butyl oxycarbonyl adamantyl 2 amide (9), and N t butyl oxycarbonyl adamantyl 1 methyl [11, 14, 16, 19] . The purity (>95%) and identity of used compounds were assessed by HPLC and spectral analysis.\n\nIn vitro PK activity assay with human recombinant PKs. The activity of recombinant human PKs was assessed by the radiometric method ( Table 1 ). The reaction mixture contained 60 mM HEPES NaOH, pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 3 mM MnCl 2 , 3 \u03bcM sodium orthovanadate, 1.2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 50 \u03bcg/ml PEG20000, and 1 \u03bcM [\u03b3 33 P]ATP (~5\u00b710 5 Ci; PerkinElmer, USA) in a final volume of 50 \u03bcl. The enzyme concentrations in the reaction mix ture were the following: Aurora A, 2 ng/\u03bcl; Aurora B, 2 ng/\u03bcl; AXL, 2 ng/\u03bcl; B RAF V600E, 0.4 ng/\u03bcl; CDK2/Cyclin A, 2 ng/\u03bcl; CK2\u03b1 1, 4 ng/\u03bcl; IGF1R, 0.4 ng/\u03bcl; MET, 2 ng/\u03bcl; PLK1, 1 ng/\u03bcl; PRK1, 1 ng/\u03bcl; SRC, 0.2 ng/\u03bcl; and VEGFR2, 0.5 ng/\u03bcl. Incorporation of radioactive phosphate into the following substrates was measured: RBER CHKtide (PLK1); tetra(LRRWSLG) (Aurora A, Aurora B, PRK); casein (CK2 \u03b1 1); MEK1 KM (BRAF V600E); histone H1 (CDK2/Cyclin A); poly(Ala, Glu, Lys, Tyr) 6 : 2 : 5 : 1 (MET); poly(Glu, Tyr) 4 : 1 (AXL, IGF1R, SRC, VEGFR2).\n\nIn vitro PK activity was assayed with a Beckman Coulter/Sagian Multipette Automated Liquid Handler robotic system (USA) at the ATP concentration of 1 \u03bcM. The assay conditions have been optimized for each kinase, as well as for each lot of the recombinant proteins.\n\nTo verify the quality of the recombinant proteins, we determined apparent K m (ATP) values under the same conditions that were used for compound in vitro testing.\n\nFor each PK lot used, the IC 50 values with three ref erence inhibitors (10 concentrations each) were deter mined at 1 \u03bcM ATP to confirm the reproducibility of the obtained results, as well as their correspondence to the earlier published data. Z\u2032 factors have been determined in each assay; all of them were at least 0.41 and, in most cases, exceeded 0.6, thereby indicating good to excellent assay reproducibility.\n\nThe reactions were performed at 30\u00b0C for 80 min and then stopped by adding 50 \u03bcl of 2% H 3 PO 4 (v/v). After washing off unreacted \u03b3 33 P, label incorporation was measured with a Wallac Microbeta Trilux microplate scintillation counter (PerkinElmer).\n\nIn vitro PK activity assay with tissue derived CK1 and CK2. Native CK2 (\u03b12\u03b22) and CK1 were purified from rat liver as previously described [20] . Human recombinant CK2 \u03b1 subunits were expressed in Escherichia coli and used in kinetic analysis after purification (see below) [20] . CK2 and CK1 phosphorylation was carried out at 37\u00b0C in the presence of increasing amounts of each inhibitor in a final volume of 25 \u03bcl containing 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 12 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.02 mM [\u03b3 33 P]ATP (500 1000 cpm/pmol), unless indicated other wise. The phosphorylation substrates were synthetic pep tides RRRADDSDDDDD (100 \u03bcM) and RRKHAAIGDDDDAYSITA (200 \u03bcM) for CK2 and CK1, respectively. The reaction was started by adding kinase to the reaction mixture and stopped after 10 min by adding 50 \u03bcl of 0.5 M H 3 PO 4 . Aliquots of the reaction mixture were spotted onto phosphocellulose filters (MANN Filter, Germany); the filters were washed four times with 5 10 ml of 75 mM H 3 PO 4 and once with methanol (20 ml) and then dried at 25\u00b0C before counting. Each measurement was performed in triplicate; the results were calculated as mean \u00b1 SEM (SEM < 15%).\n\nKinetic analysis. Kinetic data were obtained using CK2\u03b1 as described above. Initial reaction rates were determined at different substrate and ATP concentrations as described in [21, 22] . K m values were calculated in the absence and presence of increasing inhibitor concentra tions using Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plots. \n\nThe inhibitory activity of nine teicoplanin derivatives (2) (10), eremomycin aglycon (11), and its derivatives (12) (15) against CK2\u03b1 and 11 human PKs (Aurora A, Aurora B, AXL, BRAF V600E, CDK2/CycA, IGF1 R, MET, PLK1, PRK1, SRC, VEGFR2) were evaluated in vitro by either determining IC 50 values (Table 1) or meas uring enzyme residual activity (%) incubation with the tested compounds (10 and 1 \u03bcM) ( Table 2) .\n\nThe inhibitory activity of teicoplanin aglycon deriv atives (2) (7), (9), and (10), teicoplanin aglycon (1), teicoplanin, and eremomycin was evaluated in vitro against native CK2 and CK1 isolated from rat liver ( Table  3) . We also studied the kinetics of CK2\u03b1 inhibition by the teicoplanin analogue (7) that exhibited the highest inhibitory activity in our tests (Fig. 3, a and b) .\n\nWe compared the inhibitory activity of studied gly copeptide derivatives against PKs and discussed the rela tionship between activity, structure, and antiviral activi ties of the tested compounds.\n\nTeicoplanin aglycon derivatives. Hydrophobic teicoplanin aglycon carboxamides (2) (4) containing var ious hydrophobic residues inhibited all tested human PKs. The IC 50 values for these compounds were in low micromolar range (Table 1) , except for CK2\u03b1 inhibition by (4) (IC 50 , 18 \u03bcM). However, this compound was also inefficient against rat liver protein kinases CK1 and CK2 (IC 50 , 34.76 and >40 \u03bcM, respectively) ( Table 3) .\n\nHuman CK2\u03b1 was also less sensitive to the teicoplanin aglycon derivatives (6) and (9) (100 and 83% residual activity at 10 \u03bcM concentration, respectively) ( Table 2 ). Compound (6) showed no or weak inhibitory activity (>57% residual activity at 10 \u03bcM) toward all investigated human PKs.\n\nTeicoplanin derivatives (2) and (7) (10) demonstrat ed significant inhibitory activity against tested PKs (resid ual activities, <10% at 10 \u03bcM concentrations). Among them, compounds (2) (IGF1R, SRC), (7) (Aurora B, IGF1R, SRC), and (9) (IGF1R) were strong inhibitors that suppressed enzymatic activity by more than 50% when used at 1 \u03bcM concentration ( Table 2) .\n\nCompounds (2), (5), (7), (9), and (10) efficiently inhibited isolated rat liver CK2 (IC 50 , ~ 2.70 4.00 \u03bcM), while compounds (1), (4), and (6) were almost inactive against this enzyme (IC 50 \u2265 40 \u03bcM) ( Table 3) .\n\nUnlike native CK2, CK1 was less sensitive to most of the investigated compounds. The IC 50 values for CK1 inhibition were <10 \u03bcM only for (5) and (7), while for compounds (1), (2), (4), (6), (9), and (10) they were much higher (~20.29 40.00 \u03bcM).\n\nIt is important to mention that the inhibitory activi ties of (2), (4), (6), (7), (9), and (10) against CK2 were evaluated using both recombinant and native proteins (Tables 1 3) and correlated with the activities of these compounds in other tests. This holds true for the low inhibitory activity of (6), as well as for higher inhibitory activities of compounds (2), (7), (9), and (10).\n\nKinetic analysis of CK2\u03b1 inhibition by the teicoplanin aglycon analogue (7) showed that this com pound suppressed the enzyme activity by the non com petitive mechanism (with respect to ATP) (Fig. 3a) . To further investigate the action mechanism of compound (7), CK2\u03b1 inhibition was studied at constant ATP con centration in the presence of varying peptide substrate concentrations. As shown in Fig. 3b, compound (7) also showed a non competitive inhibition with respect to the peptide substrate. This is a remarkable result because the majority of kinase inhibitors compete with ATP for binding in the same active site [23] . CK2 inhibitors that are non com petitive with respect to ATP have been rarely reported.\n\nEremomycin aglycon derivatives. Eremomycin agly con (11) and hexapeptide (12) showed moderate or low inhibitory activities (IC 50 , ~12 and >100 \u03bcM, respective ly) against the tested human PKs ( CDK2/CycA, CK2\u03b1 1, VEGFR2) were moderate or low (IC 50 , 11.6 75.4 \u03bcM). Compound (15) showed remark ably high inhibitory activity (IC 50 , \u2264 10.1 \u03bcM) against only four PKs (Aurora A, Aurora B, IGF1R, PRK1). Human CK2\u03b1 was most resistant to all eremomycin derivatives ((11) (15)) (IC 50 , 14.5 to >100 \u03bcM) and teicoplanin aglycon derivative (6) (IC 50 , 18 \u03bcM).\n\nThe relationship between structure, inhibitory activity against PKs, and antiviral activity. Natural antibiotics eremomycin and teicoplanin (Fig. 1) did not inhibit rat liver CK1 and CK2 in our experiments (IC 50 , \u2265 40 \u03bcM) .  Aglycon derivatives (1), (11), and (12) showed moderate to low inhibitory activities against the tested PKs (IC 50 , 12 to >40 \u03bcM) (Tables 1 and 3) . However, aglycon derivatives bearing one or two hydrophobic residues (Fig. 2, a and b) inhibited different PKs in micromolar concentrations (Tables 1 3) . In all the cases, hydrophobic substituent in teicoplanin aglycon amides (2) (6), N acyl derivative (7), amides of N acyl derivative (8) (10), as well as in eremomycin aglycon or eremomycin hexapeptide amides (13) (15) was essential for the inhibitory activity of these compounds against PKs.\n\nComparison of inhibitory efficiencies of teicoplanin and eremomycin aglycon carboxamides bearing the same residue X = NH(CH 2 ) 10 NH 2 showed that teicoplanin derivative (4) was significantly more active against the tested human PKs (Aurora A, Aurora B, AXL, BRAFV600E, CDK2/Cyclin A, IGF1R, MET, PLK1, PRK1, SRC, VEGFR2) than eremomycin derivative (15) (IC 50 , ~ 0.78 4.00 \u03bcM vs. 8.3 33.6 \u03bcM, respectively) due to the differences in their structures. Teicoplanin, in com parison with eremomycin, has an aromatic hydrophobic amino acid at position 3 instead of asparagine (Asn) and additional chlorine atom in the amino acid 6 of the pep tide core.\n\nIt have been found earlier that several compounds ((2) (5), (7) (10)) inhibiting different PKs in our experi ments suppress some coronaviruses, such as HIV 1, HIV 2, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS CoV), and flaviviruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), Dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in micromolar concentrations in in vitro tests [11, 14, 16 18] . These compounds exhibit no cytotoxicity against host cells (Vero B cells for SARS CoV, DENV 2, YFV 17D, JEV, and TBEV; CRFK cells for FIPV; CEM cells for HIV) with the selectivity index CC 50 /EC 50 > 10 (where CC 50 is compound concentration required to inhibit host cell proliferation by 50%).\n\nThere are several publications about known specific PKs inhibitors suppressing virus replication. For exam ple, 2 (2 chlorophenyl) 5,7 dihydroxy 8 [(3S,4R) 3 hydroxy 1 methylpiperidin 4 yl]chromen 4 one (flavopiridol) is the first CDK inhibitor in human clinical trials that blocks HIV replication [5] . Also, the CK2 inhibitor 2 dimethylamino 4,5,6,7 tetrabromo 1H benz imidazole (DMAT) prevents HCV production in the host cell [24] .\n\nThe relationship between inhibitory and antiviral activities of glycopeptide derivatives may be of great inter est for the development of antiviral drugs, since it has been shown that human cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and CK2 are required for HIV 1 replication [5, 6, 25, 26] , whereas CK1, CK2, PLK1, and SRC are involved in HCV replication [9, 27 29] .\n\nEremomycin aglycon derivatives (13) (15) contain ing hydrophobic residues have been investigated as anti HIV 1 agents [16] . The antiviral activity was high for (13) (EC 50 , 1.6 \u03bcM) and moderate for (14) and (15) (EC 50 , 12 and 15 \u03bcM, respectively) ( Table 1) . Hydrophobic teicoplanin aglycon derivatives (amides (2) (5), (7)) effi ciently inhibited human PKs and CK2 (IC 50 , 10 \u03bcM) (Tables 1 3) , as well as exhibited anti HIV 1 activity with EC 50 values between 2.6 and 15 \u03bcM [11] . This demon strates that the inhibitory activity of several investigated compounds against PKs correlates with their antiviral activity displayed at micromolar concentrations.\n\nHydrophobic teicoplanin aglycon derivatives (7) (10) strongly inhibiting human PKs (Aurora B, AXL, IGF1R, MET, PLK1, SRC, VEGFR2) (22% control when used at 10 \u03bcM concentration) and CK2 (IC 50 , 10 \u03bcM) (Tables 2 and 3 ) selectively suppressed HCV replication in model subgenomic HCV replicon systems and cultured cells (EC 50 , 5.7, 7.0, 4.9, and 3.6 \u03bcM, respectively, in Huh 5 2 host cells) [14] .\n\nThe most interesting data have been obtained for the teicoplanin aglycon derivative N t butyl oxycarbonyl Table 3 . Inhibitory activity (IC 50 , \u03bcM) of teicoplanin, eremomycin, teicoplanin aglycon (1) and its derivatives (2), (4) (7), (9), and (10) against serine/threonine kinas es CK1 and CK2 from rat liver (9) . It was found that this compound targets the early stage (binding/entry) of the DENV 2 infection [17] . The fact that (9) prevents DENV 2 entry into the host cell and HCV replication does not imply the same mechanism of action. Indeed, it was demonstrated that (9) inhibits HCV replication at the post entry stage (in Huh 9 13 cells) but its target has not been established yet [14] . However, considering that DENV 2 and HCV belong to the same family (Flaviviridae), it is remarkable that the same molecule inhibits replication of such close ly related viruses by affecting two entirely different stages of the replication cycle.\n\nIn this manuscript, we have for the first time evaluat ed the inhibitory activities of 15 polycyclic peptide deriv atives (teicoplanin and eremomycin aglycons and their derivatives) against a panel of 12 human protein kinases and rat liver protein kinases CK1 and CK2.\n\nTeicoplanin aglycon analogue (7) was a rare example of non competitive inhibitor of protein kinase activity with respect to both ATP and peptide substrate, as demonstrated by kinetic analysis of its inhibitory action on recombinant CK2\u03b1.\n\nSeveral investigated hydrophobic analogues of poly cyclic glycopeptide antibiotics ((2) (5), (8) (10), (12)) that have been earlier found to suppress replication of HIV, HCV, and the other corona and flaviviruses [11, 14, 16 18] inhibited different PKs in the micromolar concen tration range (Tables 1 3) .\n\nThe patterns common for PK inhibition and antivi ral activity of the investigated compounds were estab lished: (i) both inhibitory and antiviral activities are determined by the base aglycon structure; (ii) hydropho bic residue in aglycon is essential for the inhibitory activ ity; (iii) the position of this hydrophobic residue in agly con is not important; (iv) the number of hydrophobic residues (one or two) is not important.\n\nGlycopeptide aglycon derivatives are promiscuous inhibitors of PKs, and their inhibitory activity depends on structure. The fact that they inhibit different types of PKs may explain their activity against unrelated viruses (HIV, HCV, etc.) Moreover, the levels and activities of PKs in virus infected cells, as well as the inhibitory potential of glycopeptide aglycon derivatives and their ability to per meate the host cell membrane, can modulate the antivi ral activity of these compounds.\n\nThe role of PK inhibition in the antiviral activity of hydrophobic glycopeptide aglycon derivatives remains to be investigated; the ability of these compounds to affect cellular protein kinases in vivo still has to be verified. Since ATP concentrations used in the in vitro assays are significantly below average intracellular ATP concentra tions, the potency of kinase inhibitors in vitro does not necessarily reflect their potency in cells. Therefore, fur ther optimization of glycopeptide derivatives will aim to improve their potency, as well to demonstrate the ability of these compounds to inhibit intracellular protein kinas es.\n\nThe search for antiviral compounds among protein kinase inhibitors seems to be very promising. These novel approaches may pave the way to new prospects in drug discovery, while simultaneously providing valuable tools for studying signal transduction and viral replication.\n\nMoreover, such studies may be useful for under standing the mechanism of the antiviral activity of hydrophobic glycopeptide aglycons and promote the development of a novel class of PKs inhibitors based on glycopeptides antibiotics and related compounds."}
