{"title": "Growth pattern of various JHM coronavirus isolates in primary rat glial cell cultures correlates with differing neurotropism in vivo", "body": "Several murine coronavirus strains cause in rodents a broad spectrum of acute to chronic central nervous system diseases which are important in studying the mechanisms of persistency and demyelination (Sorensen et al., 1980; Stohlman and Weiner, 1981; Knobler et al., 1981; Sorensen et al., 1982; Lavi et al., 1984) . Infection of Lewis rats with the JHM strain of murine coronavirus in particular can lead to a demyelinating encephalomyelitis, which is triggered by a persistent virus infection and is associated with autoimmune reactions against myelin basic protein (Watanabe et al., 1983; Massa et al., 1986a) . JHM virus causes in rats both a short term acute encephalomyelitis with involvement of neurons and glial cells and a subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE) with predominant involvement of glial cells (Nagashima et al., 1978 (Nagashima et al., , 1979 Koga et al., 1984; Wege et al., 1984a) . This SDE is caused by a persistent virus infection, and neuropathological changes consist of inflammatory demyelinating lesions. Recovery from the acute disease and progression to viral persistence depends on the type of JHM virus utilized for intracerebral inoculation.\n\nWild type JHM predominantly causes acute fatal encephalomyelitis, while various temperature-sensitive mutants produce a less severe acute phase of disease and establish long-term persistence with high frequency (Wege et al., 1983) . Other JHM isolates do not cause productive infections in the brain (Baybutt et al., 1984) . The ability of different neurotropic JHM virus isolates to cause fatal acute disease or persistent infections may depend on various factors, including the target cells of the virus, efficiency of virus production, the ability of the virus to spread to other cells and the particular type of immune response to the infection (Sorensen et al., 1982 (Sorensen et al., , 1984 Beushausen and Dales, 1985; Taguchi et al., 1985 Taguchi et al., , 1986 Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982; Massa et al., 1986b) . The degree to which direct virus-neural cell interaction or the immunological response to infection controls the frequency of acute versus persistent infection by JHM virus is unknown. We have therefore examined the growth properties of three different JHM isolates in primary rat glial cell cultures. We show that the degree of neurotropism associated with each individual virus in the animal correlates with growth properties of the virus in the glial cell cultures. The differences seen in tissue culture are glial cell-specific, as all three viruses display similar properties when grown on susceptible cell lines.\n\nOne-day-old Lewis rat pups were anesthetized with ether, washed with a surgical disinfectant, then decapitated. Brains were aseptically removed and brainstems, cerebella and meninges were carefully dissected from cerebral hemispheres and discarded.\n\nThe pooled cerebral hemispheres were minced with scissors, and repeatedly aspirated through a Pasteur pipet to mechanically dissociate the cells. Dissociated cells were suspended in 4 ml per hemisphere of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) without antibiotics and containing 0.6% dextrose and 15% non-heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (complete medium). The suspended cells were sieved through a 130 pm and then a 33 pm polyester screen without vacuum and plated onto Falcon 24-multiwell plates with or without polyornithinecoated glass coverslips. The cultures were incubated at 37\" C with 10% CO, at maximum humidity and fed on day 4 and every other day thereafter. Cultures were infected with JHM virus at 3 wk post-plating.\n\nPrimary glial cultures from newborn rat brain reach confluency 5 days after plating and consist primarily of three distinct cell populations, as previously described (Massa et al., 1986b) . In brief, type I astrocytes positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Fc receptor-positive macrophages form a continuous monolayer of cells, occurring in a 1: 1 ratio remaining constant for at least 3 wk of culture. The remainder of the cells at five days consist of scattered A2B5+ precursors to oligodendrocytes and type II astrocytes, which divide and differentiate into the latter cell types between l-3 wk after plating (Massa et al., 1986b) . At 3 wk post-plating, when the cultures were infected, the cell density was approximately 5 X lo5 cells/cm2.\n\nCultures grown for 3 wk were infected with either: (1) wild type (wt) JHM virus;\n\n(2) a temperature-sensitive neurovirulent mutant designated ts43 (Wege et al., 1983); or (3) a non-neurovirulent isolate of JHM virus designated JHM-Pi (Baybutt et al., 1984) .\n\nPrior to infection, cultures were washed twice with DMEM without fetal bovine serum, then inoculated with JHM virus. After adsorption for 2 h, and every other day thereafter, the inoculum was removed and the cultures were fed with fresh complete medium. Supematants were saved at regular feedings between 2 and 24 days post-infection to determine production of released virus. At 1, 7 and 21 days post infection cultures were processed for immunoperoxidase labeling of intracellular JHM virus antigen or double immunofluorescence of virus antigen and astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP).\n\nGlial cultures were fixed with 2.0% formaldehyde in 0.12 M phosphate buffer for l/2 h, treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 in 0.5 M Tris buffer for 20 min to permeabilize the cells, and blocked for non-specific protein binding sites with 20% normal horse serum in 0.5 M Tris buffer, pH 7. \n\nCells cultivated on polyornithine coated glass coverslips were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in 0.12 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, permeabihzed with 0.25% Triton X-100, then blocked with 20% normal horse serum in 0.5 M Tris buffer, pH 7.6. The cultures were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody to JHM virus nucleocapsid protein (Wege et al., 1984b) and then with a rabbit antiserum to astrocytespecific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (DAKO, Denmark). Co-localization of the virus nucleocapsid and GFAP in individual cells was determined by epifluorescence microscopy after subsequent incubation of preparations with rhodamine conjugated to goat anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed, South San Francisco, Ca). Normal rabbit serum and mouse monoclonal antibody unrelated to JHM virus antigen or rat antigens were utilized as negative controls in the primary antibody step in parallel specimens.\n\nThe stock viruses were isolated, selected for variants and cloned as previously described (Wege et al., 1983; Baybutt et al., 1984) . Virus released into supematants was titrated as p.f.u./ml on the murine Sac( -) cell line.\n\nThe parameters analyzed in this study for the three JHM virus isolates utilizing primary glial cultures from newborn rat brain were (1) differences in cytopathic effect (CPE), (2) differences in rates of spreading via cell fusion, (3) differences in establishment of persistence with high and low m.o.i., and (4) differences in production of infectious virus. \n\nThe target cells of JHM virus in glial cultures are type I astrocytes and brain derived macrophages JHM virus isolates used. As shown in Fig. 2 , at 12-24 h pi. with high m.o.i., many of the primary target cells of both wild type JHM and ts43 are GFAP+ astrocytes. Preferential infection of astrocytes by JHM-Pi virus is also apparent (not shown). As seen at 24-48 h p.i. with high m.o.i. (Fig. 3) , spreading of JHM wt and ts43 virus proceeds rapidly via cell fusion of astrocytes and macrophages in the bed layer while JHM-Pi appears to be restricted in its capacity to fuse as described below. At one week p.i. syncytia are still positive for both JHM antigen and GFAP filaments and syncytia are enlarged compared to that seen during the first days p.i. As well, CPE becomes apparent at this time in cultures infected with wt and ts43, but not with JHM-Pi.\n\nPlaques produced by wt, ts43 and JHM-Pi differ in their rates of expansion in the order wt > ts43 B JHM-Pi. Immunoperoxidase staining of JHM virus antigen most clearly demonstrates the differences in the extent of plaque formation at 1 day, 1 wk and 3 wk p.i. (Fig. 4) . As can be seen, the growth of plaques, produced by JHM-wt and ts43 after infection with low m.o.i., proceeds steadily for at least 3 wk (Fig. 4 , a-f). In contrast, JHM-Pi remains restricted mainly to single cells or cell doublets as seen at 1 day p.i. (Fig. 4, g) using a low m.o.i., and the infection appears abortive during the first week of infection. However, at high m.o.i., single or doublet infected cells positive for virus antigen persist for 1 to at least 3 wk p.i. (Fig. 4, h) . Whether low multiplicity infection by JHM-Pi is abortive or simply undetectable by immunoperoxidase staining is unclear; however, in some instances, productive infections were apparent after co-cultivation with susceptible cell lines (not shown). This would indicate a propensity of JHM-Pi virus to produce non-productive low level persistent infections after inoculation with low m.o.i. and persistent productive infections using high m.o.i. Infection by JHM-wt at high m.o.i. invariably led to a lytic infection that was complete by l-2 wk p.i., with the exception that fibroblasts and numerous oligodendrocytes remained apparently uninfected, as previously described (Massa et al., 1986b). As described above, at low m.o.i., the cultures usually survived an initial lytic phase and then plaque expansion ceased. This situation was invariably produced by JHM-ts43 regardless of m.o.i. and persisted until at least 8 weeks pi. (Fig.   4 , f>. In contrast to Sac( -) cells, infection of cultivated brain cells with the three JHM virus variants resulted in different virus growth curves. At high m.o.i. JHM-wt virus release peaked at 4 days p.i. and declined thereafter to undetectable levels by 10 days p.i. (Fig. 5, a) . At low m.o.i. JHM-wt was released at constant levels (103-lo4 p.f.u./mI) between 4 and 24 days pi. (Fig. 5, b) with a development of restricted focal CPE. After infection with JHM-ts 43 at high m.o.i. (Fig. 5, a) virus release rose at a steady slow rate starting 6-10 days p.i. whereas at low m.o.i. (Fig. 5, b) no evidence for a productive infection was obtained. JHM-Pi infection at high m.o.i. (Fig. 5 , a) led to extremely high virus titers over prolonged periods without the development of a detectable CPE. With low m.o.i., infectious JHM-Pi was found on day 2 to day 4 at about lo2 p.f.u./ml, and then became undetectable thereafter, except in rare instances in some samples (Fig. 5, b ).\n\nWe have examined three different isolates of JHM coronavirus which produce different neuropathological disease patterns after intracranial infection of rats. JHM-wt virus causes a high frequency of acute en~ephalomye~tis, JHM-ts43 virus produces a high incidence of a demyelinating encephalomyelitis based on a persistent virus infection, and JHM-Pi is non-neurovirulent in vivo. The growth properties of these viruses are remarkably different after infection of primary rat glial cultures especially with respect to JHM-Pi and reflect the type of disease pattern resulting in the animal. The observed differences in virus-cell interactions can be largely att~buted to properties of glial cells since all three viruses behave similarly on various susceptible cell lines.\n\nThe reason for expression of virus-specific phenotypes in gliaI cells is unknown. With respect to persistence, interferons do not appear to play a role in vitro (Massa et al., 1986a) . The major virological factor contributing to neurovirulence is probably related to the extent of cell fusion caused by the virus. Resistance against virus-induced cell fusion can be a property of the host cell, as demonstrated for persistent infections of mouse L cell sublines with coronavirus A59 (Mizzen et al., 1983) . In contrast, we found that the extent of cell fusion during infection in Sac ( -) "}
