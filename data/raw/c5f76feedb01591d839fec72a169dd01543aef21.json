COVID-19, SARS and MERS: are they closely related? 1", "body": "The most recent literature in English language regarding COVID-19 has been reviewed 23 and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about SARS and 24 MERS epidemics. 25 Content: COVID-19 seems not to be very different from SARS regarding its clinical features. 26 However, it has a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than SARS (9.5%) and much lower than MERS 27 (34.4%). It cannot be excluded that because of the COVID-19 less severe clinical picture it can 28 spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS. The actual basic reproductive number 29 (R 0 ) of COVID-19 (2-2.5) is still controversial. It is probably slightly higher than the R 0 of SARS (1.7-30 1.9) and higher than MERS (<1),. The gastrointestinal route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which 31 has been also assumed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cannot be ruled out and needs to be further 32 investigated. 33 Implications: There is still much more to know about COVID-19, especially as concerns mortality 34 and capacity of spreading on a pandemic level. Nonetheless, all of the lessons we learned in the 35 past from SARS and MERS epidemics are the best cultural weapons to face this new global threat. (WHO) to range between 2 and 2.5, which is higher than SARS (1.7-1.9) and MERS (<1), suggesting 100 that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher pandemic potential. 19-23 However, it must be noted that some 101 published studies have estimated a R 0 for SARS reaching the value of 4. 24 Interestingly, a recent 102 review by Liu and colleagues has shown that the average reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 is 103 estimated to be 3.28, with a median value of 2.79, thus exceeding the WHO estimates. 25 where the epidemic has started, is 7-fold higher than other provinces. 26 This could be related to 112 the fact that, among the 44 672 cases reported by CCDC, 10 567 (14.6%) cases were diagnosed 113 only clinically and exclusively in the Hubei province. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that clinically 114 diagnosed cased presented with a more severe clinical picture, thus increasing the case fatality 115 rate. 26 After the change of case definition, the number of cases increased due to the inclusion of 116 cases cumulated over the past weeks. The question is: were mild cases registered at all? It is not a 117 minor matter, because including mild cases will reduce the mortality rate.
