{"title": "Direct multiplexed whole genome sequencing of respiratory tract samples reveals full viral genomic information", "body": "Acute respiratory tract infections (RTI) are a major cause of hospitalization of children below 5 years of age [1] . Respiratory tract infections in these young children are associated with high morbidity and mortality [2] . Over 65% of respiratory infections are caused by viruses [3] . In the last decades, improvement of molecular techniques has resulted in the discovery of new viruses. However, the viral etiology of RTI is still unknown in a significant number of cases [3] . Current diagnostic methods for virus detection are mainly based on molecular amplification techniques such as PCR, using large panels of the currently known pathogens and frequently detected viruses. Therefore, new viral pathogens might be missed. Moreover, it was estimated that more than 50 percent of the human virus species still await discovery [4] .\n\nNext generation sequencing (NGS) techniques have been applied in public health microbiology for outbreak monitoring and for metagenomic studies [5, 6] . Additionally, NGS has become a powerful approach in the discovery of new viruses [7] [8] [9] . The increasing performance of bench top sequencers such as the Illumina MiSeq and the Ion Torrent PGM is associated with an ongoing reduction in costs. Translation of deep sequencing techniques into routine virus diagnostics on clinical samples seems a logical next step, thereby not only broadening the range of viruses that can be detected but also providing additional characterization of the detected viruses. Zoll et al., 2009 (10) . Sample processing method 2: Human ribosomal RNA depletion and subsequent whole genome amplification (WGA) en whole transcriptome amplification (WTA).\n\nIn this report, we describe the virome determination directly on clinical samples by multiplexed whole-genome sequencing as a proof of principle for the use of deep sequencing techniques in viral diagnostics.\n\nNasopharyngeal-aspirate and sputum samples were obtained from 8 pediatric patients with moderate to severe RTI. Additionally, two nasopharyngeal-aspirate samples from healthy adults were used as control samples (Table 1 ). All samples were tested with a multiplex-PCR assay for a panel of respiratory pathogens including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenzavirus-A and B, adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, bocavirus, parainfluenzavirus 1-4 (PIV), coronavirus OC43 and 229 E, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human rhinovirus (hRV). Samples were processed according to the scheme depicted in Fig. 1 .\n\nDNA and RNA were isolated directly from clinical samples. Either 200 l virus transport medium or sputum was centrifuged for 10 min. at 10,000xg in order to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was treated with RNase-One (Promega) and Turbo DNase-One (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Total nucleic acid was purified using Qiagen DNeasy Blood kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Nucleic acids were eluted with 100 l elution buffer. Two different approaches were used for the pre-amplification of the viral genomes. Half of the samples were processed using a random amplification method that was successfully used in previous experiments [10] . The limited volume of the clinical samples may result in low total virus content and therefore, a second approach for pre-amplification was used. Nucleic acid fractions from four clinical samples from pediatric patients and a control sample were used as input for the amplification using commercially available kits, originally developed for single-cell whole-genome or whole-transcriptome amplification.\n\nVirus identification by NGS requires enrichment of viral particles. Presence of human and bacterial cells will cause an overrepresentation of non-viral reads, especially rRNA. Therefore, human rRNA from the purified nucleic acids fractions was depleted. Human rRNA was removed from 50 l of the purified nucleic acid fraction using the GeneRead rRNA-depletion kit (Qiagen, Valencia (CA), USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. rRNA-depleted RNA was purified with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia (CA), USA). RNA was eluted in 15 l elution buffer. For the reverse transcription reaction, 13 l RNA was mixed with 8 l lysis-buffer supplied with the Qiagen Repli-G Cell WGA and WTA kit and incubated for 5 min. at 24 \u2022 C, 3 min at 95 \u2022 C and cooled on ice. Reverse transcription was performed on 10 l RNA using the Qiagen Repli-G Cell WGA and WTA kit according the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nThe DNA and cDNA fractions obtained after rRNA-depletion and reverse transcription were used for whole-genome amplification (WGA) and whole-transcriptome amplification (WTA) in which the WTA approach was applied for the detection of RNA viruses, using the Qiagen Repli-G Cell WGA and WTA kit respectively. WGA and WTA fractions from individual samples were used for sequencing separately. Approximately 100 ng DNA per sample was used for sequencing on IonTorrent PGM system with an Ion 318 sequencing chip (Life Technologies, Waltham (MA), USA). Sequencing results were analyzed as depicted in Fig. 1 .\n\nPartial or full virus genomes were assembled from selected reads covering the most significant reference sequences found during the virus identification analysis. Assembly and determination of sequence coverage was done with Bowtie2 using the reference sequence as template and the default setting \"local-sensitive\" switched on [11] . Sequence depth was calculated using Samtools available at the Galaxy web server [12, 13] .\n\nEight respiratory tract samples from pediatric patients with acute RTI were tested by multiplex-PCR of which two samples were found positive for hRV, one sample for RSV, and one sample was found positive for hMPV. Four samples remained negative in PCR. The two control samples from healthy adults were also found negative (Table 1) .\n\nSchematic representation of the sample preparation. For each sample dataset reads were processed in two steps. First, a human genome-database was constructed using NCBI GRCh38 dataset. Human sequences were removed by mapping the reads to the human genome using Bowtie2 version 2.1.0 with the default setting \"local-sensitive\" switched on (11) . A database was constructed with complete genomic sequences from mammalian viruses, collected from NCBI, ViralZone and EMBL. Reads that remained after removal of human sequences were mapped to the viral database using Bowtie2. Distributions of hits matching viral sequences were processed manually. Additionally, the remaining reads were mapped against datasets containing bacterial and eukaryotic sequences using Bowtie2.\n\nFrom all samples, sufficient amounts of DNA and RNA were obtained to perform whole-genome sequencing for the detection of DNA viruses, or whole-transcriptome sequencing for the detection of RNA viruses. All reads were used as input for the virus identification. Additionally, reads were also mapped to bacterial and eukaryotic sequences (Tables 2 and 3 ). With an average read length of 150 bp, the settings used for Bowtie2-alignment allows a sequence variation of approximately 26%. In all samples, the vast majority of the reads was of human or bacterial origin. The bacterial sequences included genomic as well as plasmid and phage sequences. A significant amount of bacterial sequences originated from ribosomal-DNA. This is the direct consequence of the fact that the samples were human rRNA-depleted only, whereas bacterial rRNA was still present during the reverse transcription reaction. A significant number of reads could not be assigned to any known viral sequences. These sequences are classified as unknown and may represent fragments of genomes of unknown viral species.\n\nThe two different approaches for pre-amplification of nucleic acid extracts resulted in different efficiencies in virus detection. Although the result of virus detection in clinical samples by direct-sequencing are consistent with the results obtained with conventional molecular diagnostic methods for all samples, preamplification resulted in ten times more reads that could be assigned to viral genomic sequences when using the Repli-g systems instead of random RT/PCR. Consequently, more sequence information was obtained and almost complete virus genomes could be assembled with reads from positive samples. The results of virus classification of sequencing reads are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 4 . Sample 2 contained reads covering a major part of the hRV genome that could be classified as hRV-A38. Sample 3 1 sputum  851946  657965  9683  11700  137  172461  2 sputum  688295  567152  17078  11989  12  92064  3 sputum  629721  464131  13729  10411  2628  138822  4 sputum  643957  503513  15088  13299  360  111697  5 NPA  300649  260855  1273  29  1629  36863  6 NPA  289961  234659  18962  24  3375  32941  7 NPA  390579  236274  10891  1179  3581  138654  8 NPA  251208  66980  150082  61  930  33155  9 NPA  713577  527817  11494  11594  49  162623  10 NPA  491410  383045  5238  4  8  103115 a NPA: nasopharyngeal aspirate. contained a significant amount of reads that could be mapped to hMPV. Sample 5 contained reads mapping to hRV-C. In the diagnostic multiplex-PCR, this sample tested negative. Analysis of the viral sequence obtained from sample 5 revealed several mismatches between the forward primer used in PCR and the target sequence in the 5 -untranslated region (5 -UTR) of hRV-C, explaining the negative-PCR result. Respiratory syncytial virus sequences were detected in sample 6. The virus found in this sample could be classified as RSV-typeA. Finally, sample 7 contained reads that could be assigned to hRV-C. Whereas in sample 5 all picornavirus associated sequences could be assembled to a hRV-C genome, sample 7 contained significant numbers of reads mapped to other human enteroviruses and hRV-A genome. Most probably, this patient was infected by enteroviruses and different rhinoviruses as well.\n\nInterestingly, reads assigned to other viral pathogens were found in a number of samples. In three samples reads were found that could be assigned to members of the anelloviridae family. Especially sample 7 contained significant amounts of reads that could be mapped to various anelloviridae or torque-teno virus (TTV) genera, including torque-teno-like mini virus (TTMV) and torque-teno-like midi virus (TTMDV). Almost complete anellovirus genomes could be assembled using the reads from sample 7 and were identified as TTV genotype-19, TTMV genotype-1, and TTMDV genotype-2. \n\nHere, we present a proof of principle study with clinical samples obtained from pediatric patients with moderate to severe RTI. Using standard molecular diagnostics, viral pathogens were detected in only half of the samples. Direct multiplexed wholegenome sequencing of nucleic acids extracted from these samples confirmed the results obtained by PCR. Thus, sensitivity of the WGS approach was at least similar to the sensitivity of the diagnostic PCR in this set of samples. Moreover, of the 4 patient samples tested negative in PCR, one sample revealed hRV-typeC using NGS. Due to the heterogeneous character of the hRV target region for detection by PCR, positive samples containing hRV will be missed using routine molecular diagnostics. Therefore, sequence-independent detection methods like WGS will enhance a causative diagnosis of viral RTI.\n\nRecently, the use of NGS in diagnostics of viral respiratory tract infections was reported [14] . The described NGS based method was at least as sensitive as RT/PCR, confirming our results. The method for pre-amplification of input nucleic acid was similar to our method of random-amplification by PCR. Similar to our results, this method gave relatively small numbers of virus reads.\n\nTwo different methods of sample-processing were tested in this study. The amplification of DNA or cDNA with the high-fidelity enzyme Phi29 DNA-polymerase combined with DNA ligation provided optimal results and high sequence coverages were reached. Almost complete viral genomic sequences could be retrieved from clinical samples that tested positive in PCR with high Ct values. Despite the low viral load in these samples, direct-sequencing provided enough information to classify the detected viruses into viral strains. For small RNA viruses like picornaviruses and RSV, direct-sequencing of nucleic acid prepared from clinical samples can result in nearly complete viral-genomic data. Further improvements can be achieved by depletion of both human and bacterial rRNA.\n\nUsing WGS directly on clinical samples broadens the range of virus recovery (also viruses unable to grow in cell cultures or unknown viruses can be detected), provides the ability to characterize the detected viruses at the same time, and will speed-up the diagnostic process. A major drawback of the current viral molecular diagnostic tools is that they employ a stepwise approach for detection and typing, and that only known specific targets can be detected resulting in false negative results due to the heterogeneous character of viral genomes Based on the sequencing-data, we were able to assemble significant parts of the viral-genomes present in the samples and in all cases virus species could be determined.\n\nSequence reads of viral origin were detected using Bowtie2. The sensitivity settings for sequence alignment correspond with values for penalty-scores for mismatches and gaps, optimal for virus detection. Further decrease of penalty-scores will cause increased misalignments and over-interpretation of the results. The sensitivity settings used in our approach were also appropriate for the detection of more variable capsid encoding regions of several RNA viruses. However, the strategy of alignment of sequence reads to a database of all known viral sequences might be a limitation in the detection of unknown, more distantly related viruses.\n\nThe direct-sequencing approach delivers more comprehensive information on the microbial content of clinical samples. In almost all samples, reads were found from anelloviruses, which are widespread in the population and most people are infected in the first month after birth [15] . Three genera are associated with human infections: TTV or alphatorquevirus, TTMV or betatorquevirus, and TTMDV or gammatorquevirus. A study in pediatric patients with RTI showed an association with high levels of human anellovirus and fever in children [15] . The observed high prevalence of anellovirus in the present study is in line with a detection rate of 50% in respiratory samples by NGS as described by Prachayangprecha et al. [14] . Although associations between TTV and RTI have been extensively studied, no correlation could be determined [16] [17] [18] .\n\nSignificant numbers of reads could not be assigned to sequences of known organisms. These pools of unassigned reads might contain relevant information about potential pathogens that remained undiscovered until now. It is an intriguing challenge to identify these potential pathogens.\n\nSample preparation and sequencing combined with bioinformatic-analysis at a basic level can be completed within 48 h. Although the costs of the WGS approach is an obstacle for the implementation of this method for routine diagnosis, costs of sequencing platforms and consumables are expected to decrease significantly in the coming years. Application of WGS and directsequencing in clinical microbiology will become affordable for most laboratories. However, a number of other obstacles need to be addressed as well.\n\nDue to the materials used in sample preparation a number of contaminants are introduced. Most enzymes like nucleases, proteases and polymerases are produced in recombinant-protein expression systems. Sequences from protein expression-vectors were detected in all samples used in this study. A well-known source of contaminants is the silica-based spin-filter columns used in DNA purification kits. The use of these columns might introduce parvovirus-like sequences and provide false positive diagnostic results [19] and should be avoided in NGS based methods. Similar to current molecular diagnostic methods, WGS is sensitive to crosscontamination. Therefore, the same procedures used for prevention of cross contamination in assays like PCR should be applied to WGS. Extraction of relevant information from sequencing data requires proper software tools. In recent years, a number of research groups working in the fields of microbiology or bioinformatics developed programs for the processing of sequence-data [14, [20] [21] [22] . Processing pipelines have to be capable of processing millions of sequence reads. Pipelines based on NCBI Blast are time-consuming and therefore less suitable for first-pass analyses. In our study we used a rapid procedure based on the short-read sequence assembling program Bowtie2 [11] . Assembly of reads against a dataset of all known viruses was sufficient to extract all significant virological genomic data that match the diagnostic results of the PCR-positive samples. Implementation of this kind of pipelines in Python-scripts were recently published by several groups [20, 21] . However, standardization of sample preparation and data processing is necessary for a proper implementation of multiplexed whole-genome sequencing in diagnostics.\n\nThe results presented in this study demonstrate that multiplexed WGS is a powerful diagnostic tool in clinical virology. The direct sequencing approach delivers more comprehensive information on the viral content of clinical samples compared to current routine molecular diagnostics. The use of sequence independent detection methods, like WGS, will not only increase the chance to detect the causative agent of viral RTI, but the rapid availability of highly detailed typing information makes it also possible to trace transmission patterns of viruses leading to timely installment of proper infection control measures. In our opinion, direct-sequencing will become a serious alternative for current molecular diagnostic tools."}
