{"title": "Mechanism of measles virus failure to activate NF-jB in neuronal cells", "body": "Viral persistence in the central nervous system (CNS) may be caused in part by lower expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens on neurons, which allows infected cells to escape recognition by MHC class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) (Joly e t a l, 1991; Oldstone, 1989) , the presence of the blood \u00b1 brain barrier that restricts entry of cells and proteins, and the postmitotic nature of the neuronal cell population. MV is a neurotropic virus and although self-limiting, infection of the CNS could lead to MV persistence in the form of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) (McFarland and Dhib-Jalbut 1988) , and subacute measles encephalitis (SME) in immunocompromised patients (Dhib-Jalbut and Johnson, 1994) . Studies in SSPE and the animal model SME demonstrated that the expression of MHC class I molecules is low on infected neurons (Gogate e t a l, 1996) . This is supported by Ward and Massa (1995) , who showed that neither virus nor dsRNA was able to induce MHC class I in neonatal mouse neurons. This is in contrast to the situation in glial cells, in which a number of viruses, including murine coronavirus (Suzumura e t al, 1986) , mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-59) (Lavi e t al, 1989) , avivirus (Liu e t a l, 1989) , sindbis virus (Grif\u00aen et a l, 1992) , and MV (Kraus e t a l, 1992) , are able to induce high expression of MHC class I molecules.\n\nMoreover, with MV infection, up-regulation of MHC class I in glial cells is mediated by interferon-b (IFN-b) (Dhib-Jalbut and Cowan, 1993) . In contrast, MV fails to induce IFN-b expression in neuronal cells (Dhib-Jalbut and Cowan, 1993; Dhib-Jalbut et al, 1995) . The reason for this failure is lack of NF-jB activation and binding to the positive regulatory domain II (PRDII) element of the IFN-b promoter (Dhib-Jalbut et a l, 1995) which is necessary for virus inducibility of the IFN-b gene promoter activity (Maniatis e t a l, 1992) .\n\nNF-jB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by its inhibitor, IjB. Upon stimulation with a variety of agents, including cytokines, virus and dsRNA, IjBa is phosphorylated and degraded through the 26S proteasome complex thereby leading to NF-jB dissociation and translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (Brown e t a l, 1995; Finco and Baldwin 1995; Kumar e t a l, 1994; Li and S edivy, 1993; S hirakawa and Mizel, 1989) . Our previous investigations indicated that MV is able to induce IjBa phosphorylation and degradation in glial cells but not in neuronal cells (Dhib-Jalbut e t a l, 1999). It is not clear whether this failure is due to the existence of a neuron-speci\u00aec IjBa isoform that is resistant to phosphorylation by MV stimulation or due to a defec t in the signaling pathway that leads to IjBa phosphorylation.\n\nThe possibility that a neuronal IjBa isoform may exist is inferred from the fact that isoforms of enzymes and transcription factors are often present in different kingdoms from virus (Liu e t a l, 1997) to human (Cao e t a l, 1997) . These isoform mRNAs are possibly generated by alternative splicing (Cao e t a l, 1997) or differential usage of the gene promoters (Yasumoto e t a l, 1998) . Although these isoforms physically share some exons, functionally they may have distinct transcriptional properties (O'Donovan and Baraban, 1999) . Some isoforms may enhance their activity (Nibbs e t a l, 1999) or called activator isoform (Yin e t a l, 1995) while others may play a role of a negative regulator (Ohkura e t a l, 1999) or repressor isoform (Walker e t a l, 1998) . To determine whether the lack of IjBa phosphorylation in neuronal cells is due to the presence of a neuron-speci\u00aec IjBa isoform, ectopic wild type IjBa (IjBa-WT) tagged with the FLAG-epitope was transfected into neuronal cells, and its phosphorylation and degradation patterns in response to MV stimulation were compared with those of native IjBa.\n\nThe CD46 or membrane cofactor protein (MCP) has been identi\u00aeed to be func tionally associated with susceptibility of cells to MV infection and serves as a cellular receptor for some strains of MV, including Halle \u00c2 and Edmonston (Do \u00c8 rig e t a l, 1993; Naniche e t a l, 1993a). As a member of the regulators of complement activation (RCA) protein family (Liszewski and Atkinson, 1992) , CD46 is ubiquitously present on primate cells and inhibits lysis of host cells by binding the complement cascade components C3b and C4b, and by acting as a cofactor for their proteolytic inactivation by serine protease complement factor I (Liszewski e t a l, 1991) . Following infec tion with MV, CD46 is rapidly down-regulated from the surface of the host cell (Naniche e t a l, 1993b). S tudies in \u00aeve SS PE cases (Ogata e t a l, 1997) showed that CD46 was not detected or was expressed at very low levels in neural cells at the lesion site, whereas normal levels of CD46 were found in SS PE brain tissue distant from the lesion. Furthermore, CD46 was expressed at relatively low levels by neurons and astrocytes in normal brains in comparison to neuroblastoma cell lines (Ogata e t a l, 1997) . Little is known about the correlation between CD46 levels and IjBa activation in neuronal cells. Therefore, the possibility that MV failure to trigger IjBa activation in the neuronal cells is due to a CD46 malfunction needed to be addressed.\n\nTo distinguish ectopic IjBa-wild type from native IjBa, FLAG tagged IjBa-WT was expressed in U-251MG by transient transfection and immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG M2 antibody while native IjBa was immunoprecipitated by anti-IjBa. As expected, an approximately 37 kDa band corresponding to the native IjBa was immunoprecipitated by anti-IjBa antibody in untransfected ( Ectopic IjBa-WT could be immunoprecipitated by either monoclonal anti-FLAG or polyclonal anti-IjBa, while native IjBa in transfected and untransfected cells was immunoprecipitated by anti-IjBa antibody only. Immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS \u00b1 PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-IjBa antibody as a probe. Immunoprecipitation with normal mouse serum (NMS) or normal rabbit serum (NRS) were used as negative controls. Rainbow [ colored protein molecular weight markers (Amersham), with size covered between 14.3 \u00b1 220 kDa, were used to estimate the molecular weight of the immunoprecipitated bands.\n\nto IjBa-WT , was immunoprecipitated by anti-IjBa from transfected (lane 3) but not untranslated cells (lane 7). In contrast, the anti-FLAG antibody immunoprecipitated a single band in the transfec ted cells corresponding to the ectopic IjBa (lane 2). These results allowed us to distinguish IjBa-WT from native IjBa.\n\nPh o sp h orylatio n a nd d egra d a tio n o f ec to p ic IjBa-WT in glia l c e lls Earlier studies in our laboratory examined the kinetics of IjBa phosphorylation and degradation in response to MV stimulation at time points of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 min and up to 4 h (Dhib-Jalbut e t a l, 1999). IjBa phosphorylation occurred within 5 \u00b1 10 min of stimulation, and degradation began at 10 \u00b1 15 min later with a half-life of 30 min. This kinetic pattern in glial cells is consistent with that reported in other systems (Finco and Baldwin 1995) . Therefore in the following experiment we examined IjBa phosphorylation and degradation at three critical time points: 5, 15, and 30 min following MV-stimulation.\n\nIn untransfected U-251MG cells stimulated with TNFa, native IjBa was phosphorylated within 5 min and completely degraded at 15 min. At 30 min, IjBa was regenerated which is consistent with our previous observations (Dhib-Jalbut e t a l, 1999). With MV stimulation, native IjBa phosphorylation occurred as early as 5 min and was signi\u00aecantly degraded at 15 and 30 min ( Figure  2A ). U-251MG cells transfected with IjBa-WT expression vector expressed ectopic IjBa-WT (Figure 2B) . Following stimulation with TNFa, IjBa-WT hyperphosphorylation appeared within 5 min and the band corresponding to IjBa-WT became gradually faint between 15 and 30 min, indicating IjBa degradation. Following MV stimulation, IjBa-WT was phosphorylated after 15 min and degraded after 30 min ( Figure 2B ). The effec t of TNFa and MV stimulation on IjBa-WT degradation in U-251MG cells from two experiments are shown in Figure 2C . The results indicated that, like native IjBa, IjBa-WT responds to TNFa and MV stimulation although the time course of its phosphorylation and degradation was slightly different.\n\nPrevious studies in our laboratory showed that neuronal IjBa is not hyperphosphorylated nor degraded with MV stimulation at time point of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 60 and 120 min although IjBa phosphorylation and degradation occurred in response to TNFa stimulation (Dhib-Jalbut e t a l, 1999). To determine whether this failure is due to the existence of a neuronal IjBa isoform, FLAGtagged IjBa-WT was transfected into the neuronal cells, IMR-32. IjBa phosphorylation and degradation was examined at 5, 15, and 30 min following TNFa or MV stimulation in untransfected ( Figure   3A ) and IjBa-WT transfected ( Figure 3B ) neuronal cells. While TNFa stimulation resulted in IjBa-WT degradation, this was not observed in response to MV ( Figure 3A ,B). On the contrary, following MV stimulation, the IjBa-WT band bec ame denser Untransfected U-251MG cells were stimulated by either TNFa or MV and native IjBa from these cells was immunoprecipitated by polyclonal anti-IjBa. The blots were subsequently probed by anti-IjBa antibody. Immunoprecipitation with normal rabbit serum (NRS) was used as a negative control. The upper and lower bands represent the phosphorylated native IjBa (single arrow) and hypophosphorylated native IjBa (double arrow), respectively. (B) U-251MG cells were transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged IjBa-WT and stimulated by either TNFa or MV for various time periods. Cytoplasmic extracts were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody, fractionated by S DS \u00b1 PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-IjBa antibody. The upper bands represent the phosphorylated ectopic IjBa-WT (single arrow) and the lower bands represent the hypophosphorylated ectopic IjBa-WT (double arrow). Normal mouse serum (NMS) was used as a negative antibody control in the immunoprecipitation. The numbers at the bottom of each lane in this and in subsequent \u00aegures represent the ratio of the density of phosphorylated to hypophosphorylated IjB (IjB p /IjB) (\u00aerst row of numbers). The second row represents the ratio of the density of the IjBa band in the treated condition to that in the untreated cells. Zero indicates an undetectable band. (C) Summary of the effect of stimulation with TNFa or MV on ectopic IjBa-WT expression in the glial cell line U-251MG obtained from two experiments.\n\n( Figure 3B ). To quantitate this result, we averaged the effec t of MV stimulation on IjBa-WT in transfected neuronal cells in four separate experiments ( Figure 3C ). We found that IjBa-WT level was signi\u00aecantly increased (P < 0.05) after 30 min of MV stimulation, compared to the control condition. This indicated that IjBa-WT was not degraded but its expression was rather increased by MV stimulation. Thus, it is unlikely that lack of IjBa degradation in MV-stimulated neuronal cells is due to \u00e0 mutant' IjBa isoform.\n\nWe have observed that the immunoprecipitated band corresponding to the transfected IjBa-WT was denser at 30 min following MV stimulation. Theoretically this could represent an artifact of the system used (i.e. MV stimulation of the CMV promoter in the IjBa-WT construct), or that MV stimulation leads to enhanced synthesis and accumulation of IjBa. Therefore to determine whether the increased IjBa-WT was due to MV induc tion of the CMV promoter, we transfected neuronal cells with a reporter gene (b-gal) under the control of the CMV promoter (pCMV b -gal) examined b -galactosidase activity in response to MV stimulation using an in situ b-galactosidase staining kit (Clontech, CA, US A). Forty-eight hours after transient transfection with pCMV b-gal, the cells were stimulated with MV for 5, 15 or 30 min. Transfected cells without MV stimulation were used as controls. The cells were then stained in situ according to the supplier's instruction. The images of stimulated and unstimulated cells were captured using a CCD camera at randomly selec ted \u00aeelds. The average results from three experiments are shown in Figure 4 . The results indicate that MV is capable of stimulating the CMV promoter after 30 min of stimulation. Therefore the increase in IjBa-WT level was most likely driven by an effec t of MV on the CMV promoter, rather than an effec t on IjBa synthesis and accumulation.\n\nTo determine whether there is lack of neuronal IjBa degradation versus enhanced IjBa synthesis in response to MV, we examined the effect of blocking de no vo protein synthesis with cyclohexamide on IjBa levels in MV stimulated neuronal cells. Cells were pretreated with cyclohexamide (S igma, MO, US A) (100 lg/ml) for 1 h prior to MV or TNFa stimulation. Cyclohexamide-untreated neuronal cultures served as controls. TNFa stimulation was used as a control since it induc es IjBa degradation in neuronal cells. The results are shown in Figure 5 . As expec ted, in cyclohexamide-untreated cells, IjBa degradation was observed in response to TNFa but not MV stimulation at time periods ranging from 5 to 60 min ( Figure 5A ). In cyclohexamide treated cells ( Figure 5B ), IjBa degradation was observed in response to TNFa within 5 \u00b1 10 min post stimulation. In contrast to the cyclohexamide-untreated cells, there was no regeneration of the IjBa band after 60 min of TNFa stimulation, indicating that cyclohexamide effectively blocked d e no vo IjBa synthesis. Importantly, no change in the density of the IjBa band was observed up to 30 min post MV stimulation in cyclohexamide pre-treated cells. This indicates that the unchanged IjBa band density is due to lack of degradation rather than increased synthesis and accumulation of IjBa in response to MV. At 60 min post MV stimulation, the density of the IjBa band was reduced by approximately 50% , possibly re\u00afecting autolysis rather than signal induc ed degradation. The intensity of this IjBa band at 60 min time point was 40% less in the presence of cyclohexamide, compared to the same time point in the absence of cyclohexamide, again re\u00afecting the fact that cyclohexamide was effective in blocking d e no vo IjBa synthesis. Collectively, these results support the notion that there is lack of degradation of neuronal IjBa in response to MV stimulation.\n\nTo determine if engagement of the MV receptor in the absence of infec tion is suf\u00aecient to signal NF-jB activation, we had previously examined the effect of UV-inac tivated MV on NF-jB DNA binding activity and IjBa degradation (Dhib-Jal but e t a l, 1999). Both live and UV-inactivated virus resulted in IjBa degradation and NF-jB activation, suggesting that binding of the virus to its receptor is suf\u00aecient for signaling the IjBa/NF-jB system. Therefore, we next examined the possibility that lack of IjBa degradation in neuronal cells may involve a MV receptor defec t. To determine if lack of IjBa phosphorylation and degradation in neuronal cells is due to a MV receptor (CD46) defec t, IMR-32 cells were transfected with a CD46 expression vector. Both transfected and untransfected IMR-32 cells were stained with FITC-conjugated mouse anti-CD46 or FITC-conjugated mouse control IgG isotype and examined by\u00afow cytometry ( Figure 6 ). Compared with untransfected cells, CD46 was expressed at higher levels in transfected cells (D mean\u00afuorescence density of 40 for transfected cells compared to 26 for untransfected cells). IMR-32 cells transfected with CD46-WT were stimulated with TNFa or MV and analyzed by Western blot to identify whether failure of IjBa degradation was due to a CD46 malfunction. IjBa phosphorylation and degradation were examined at 10, 30, and 60 min post MV stimulation which represent focal time points for IjBa phosphorylation, degradation, and regeneration respectively. A representative of two experiments is shown in Figure 7 . Phosphorylation and degradation of IjBa in transfected neuronal cells was not observed after MV stimulation although IjBa was phosphorylated and degraded in response to TNFa stimulation. Therefore, the failure of phosphorylation and degradation of IjBa following MV stimulation is not due to an abnormality involving the MV receptor on neuronal cells. \n\nThe expression of MHC class I on the surface of infected cells is a key step for recognition of viral antigens by immune surveillance with CD8 + CTL (Oldstone, 1989 ; Dhib-Jalbut e t a l, 1990). Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that infected neurons from human autopsies of SSPE and in the animal model SME express low levels of MHC class I molecules (Gogate et a l, 1996) . We also found that the expression of MHC class I is enhanced by IFN-b in glial cells, whereas both molecules are not expressed on neuronal cells in response to MV (Dhib-Jalbut e t a l, 1993, 1995). NF-jB is a transcription factor required for both IFN-b and MHC class I induction (Dhib-Jalbut e t a l, 1993). It is retained in the cytoplasm through interaction with inhibitory proteins including IjBa. Exposure of cells to stimuli such as TNFa, results in the phosphorylation and degradation of IjBa. Dissociated NF-jB dimers are then translocated to the nucleus, where they bind to the positive regulatory domain (PRD) II of the IFN-b promoter and the IFNb gene is transcribed.\n\nIn an earlier study, we demonstrated that in contrast to glial cells, MV was unable to induc e IjBa phosphorylation and degradation in neuronal cells (Dhib-Jalbut e t a l, 1999). In this study we investigated whether this failure is due to the presenc e of a neuron-speci\u00aec IjBa isoform. The results demonstrate that untransfected glial cells as well as those transfected with IjBa-WT responded to MV stimulation, resulting in IjBa-WT phosphorylation and degradation. Under the same conditions, neither phosphorylation nor degradation of IjBa-WT occurred in response to MV in neuronal cells transfected with IjBa-WT. This was also true of another neuronal cell line, CHP 126 (unpublished observations). However, following TNFa stimula-tion, IjBa degradation occurred in both transfected and untransfected cells from both glial and neuronal cell lines. Based on these observations, we conclude that failure of MV stimulation to result in IjBa phosphorylation and degradation in neuronal cells is unlikely to be due to the existence of a neuron-speci\u00aec IjBa isoform.\n\nWe also explored the possibility that the unchanged IjBa band density following MV stimulation might be due to enhanced synthesis rather than lack of degradation. Blocking d e no vo protein synthesis with cyclohexamide had no effec t on IjBa band density within the expec ted time for its degradation in response to MV stimulation. This suggests that lack of degradation rather than enhanced synthesis is responsible for the accumulation of IjBa in MV stimulated neuronal cells.\n\nMembrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46) is a widely distributed regulatory protein of the complement system that facilitates inactivation of C3b/ C4b (S eya e t a l, 1986, 1990) . It consists of six unique mRNA isoforms with three different STP (serine/ threonine/proline) rich regions and two distinct cytoplasmic tails due to alternative splicing (Post e t a l, 1991) . Lately it was identi\u00aeed as MV receptor by binding MV hemagglutinin (HA) protein at two distinct regions of the CD46 complement control protein domains (CCP domain 1 and CCP domain 2) (Do \u00c8 rig e t a l, 1993; Naniche e t a l, 1993a; Buchholz e t a l, 1997). Our study indicates that UV-inactivated MV is capable of inducing IjBa degradation and NF-jB activation. This suggests that ligation of the MV receptor is suf\u00aecient to signal the IjBa/NF-jB system, without the need for infec tious virus. Although little is known about the pathway from CD46 stimulation to IjBa phosphorylation, a mutation in CD46 on neuronal cells may contribute to failure of IjBa activation. To address this hypothesis, we transfected CD46-WT into neuronal cells and stimulated those cells with MV. IjBa phosphorylation and degradation did not occur in those cells despite enhanced CD46 expression. These results suggest that a defec t in the signaling cascade distal to the MV receptor complex, may contribute to the failure of IjBa phosphorylation in neuronal cells in response to MV. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that MV signaling is occurring via another receptor. Using commercially available antibodies to CD46, we have not been able to block MV infec tion of neuronal cells as determined by cell surface MV protein expression (data not shown).\n\nMany agents can activate NF-jB, including cytokines, double-stranded RNA, virus, and TNFa (Kumar e t a l, 1994; Dhib-Jalbut e t a l, 1995; Malinin e t a l, 1997). It is still unclear whether different stimuli utilize independent signaling pathways, or share a common pathway that leads to IjBa phosphorylation. S everal kinases have been shown to be involved in IjB phosphorylation, including the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) (Maniatis e t a l, 1992) , PKC and PKA (Shirakawa and Mizel, 1989) , Raf-1 (Li and Sedivy, 1993) , casein kinase II (CKII) (B arroga e t a l, 1995), and IKK (Malinin e t a l, 1997; Maniatis, 1997) . PKR is a serine-threonine kinase involved in growth inhibition and NF-jB activation through phosphorylation of eIF2a and IjBa respectively (Clemens and Elia, 1997) . PKR activation requires dsRNA binding to the domain at its N-terminal, auto-phosphorylation and dimerization. S tudies in PKR knockout mice demonstrated a lack of NF-jB activation by poly (I)\u00d7poly (C), but this activation remained intact in response to TNFa (Yang e t a l, 1995) . To exclude the possibility of a PKR defect in the inability of MV to induce IjBa degradation in neuronal cells, we have previously performed PKR auto-phosphorylation assays in MV stimulated neuronal and glial cells. The results showed that MV was unable to phosphorylate IjBa in neuronal cells despite PKR activation (Dhib-Jalbut e t a l, 1999), suggesting either a failure to activate a signal distal to PKR in the signaling cascade that leads to IjBa phosphorylation or the existence of a PKR-independent pathway used by virus to phosphorylate IjBa (Dhib-Jalbut e t a l, 1999).\n\nAt present, the signaling pathway for MVinduced IjBa phosphorylation is not understood. A pathway of TNFa induc ed IjBa phosphorylation by an IjBa kinase complex (IKK) has been described (Malinin e t a l, 1997; Maniatis, 1997) . This kinase complex consists of two catalytic subunits: IKKa and IKKb (DiDonato e t a l, 1997; Mercurio e t a l, 1997) and a regulatory subunit IKKc (Rothwarf e t a l, 1998) . IKKb is phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase-1 (MEKK1) (Nakano e t a l, 1998), whereas IKKa is phosphorylated by NF-jB-induc ing kinase (NIK) (Malinin e t a l, 1997) . In addition to the NIK-IKK pathway, a recent study demonstrated the involvement of PI(3)K-Akt pathwayin IjBa phosphorylationin response toTNFa stimulation (Ozes e t a l, 1999). We are currently investigating whether the NIK-IKK and PI(3 )K-Akt pathways are involved in MV-induc ed IjBa phosphorylation in glial cells. If so, a defec t in one of these pathways could be responsible for lack of IjBa phosphorylation in response to MV in neuronal cells.\n\nIn summary, this study demonstrates that failure of MV to phosphorylate and degrade IjBa in neuronal cells is not due to a neuron-speci\u00aec IjBa isoform nor an abnormal MV receptor. A defect in the signaling cascade distal to the MV receptor is likely, and is currently being investigated.\n\nPla sm id s p re p a ra tio n The plasmid expressing wild type IjBa (IjBa-WT ) tagged with FLAG-epitope was kindly provided by Dr Dean W Ballard (Vanderbilt University, Tennessee, US A). Epitope-tagged derivatives of cDNA encoding full length IjBa-WT (Haskill e t a l, 1991) were constructed by PCR-assisted ampli\u00aecation with 5\u00a2 primers that fused sequences encoding the FLAG epitope (Pric kett e t a l, 1989) in frame with Nterminal coding sequences of IjBa-WT (5\u00a2-CCCAAGCTTCCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGAT-GACGATAAAATGTTCCAGGCGGCCGAGCGC-3\u00a2). This construct was cloned into the Hind III and Xb a I polylinker site of the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV4 (Andersson e t a l, 1989) immediately downstream of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter and puri\u00aeed with QIA \u00aelter plasmid kit (QIAGEN). The reported molecular weight of IjBa-WT is 44 kDa (Brockman e t a l, 1995) .\n\nMCP-BC2, a CD46 cDNA isoform was cloned into a mammalian expression vector (pS G5) (Post e t a l, 1991) . This construct was kindly provided by Dr John Atkinson (Washington University Medical S chool, USA). The plasmid was prepared with QIA \u00aelter plasmid kit (QIAGEN).\n\nThe neuronal cell line IMR-32 cell was a gift from Dr Richard J Ziegler (University of Minnesota, Duluth, MN, US A) and was maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM Hepes buffer, 100 units/ml penic illin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 0.25 mg/ml gentamycin. The human astrocytoma cell line U-251 MG was kindly provided by Dr Darryl Bigner (Duke University, North Carolina, US A) and grown in Dulbecco's modi\u00aeed Minimal Essential Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 1\u00b4MEM vitamins, 10 mM Hepes buffer, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin.\n\nThe Edmonston strain of MV was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD, US A), grown in con\u00afuent vero cells (monkey kidney \u00aebroblasts from ATCC), and titrated by plaque assay according to standard methods (Dhib-Jalbut and Cowan, 1993). The stock titer was 5\u00b410 7 plaque forming units/ml. Tra nsie nt tra nsfec tio n IMR-32 (1\u00b410 7 ) or U-251MG (2\u00b410 5 ) cells were plated in 100 mm culture dishes and incubated at 37 8C in 5% CO 2 for 24 h. U-251MG cells were plated at a lower density than IMR-32 bec ause the former cells divide much faster. IjBa-WT (20 lg) was transiently transfected into either IMR-32 or U-251MG cells using the calcium phosphate prec ipitation method as recommended by the supplier, profec tion \u00d2 mammalian transfection systems (Promega, WI, US A). The cells were then incubated for 6 h with calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation, followed by two washes in ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline (PB S ). Fresh media was then added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. Untransfected controls were prepared in parallel with the transfected cells. Both transfected as well as untransfected cells were washed twice with icecold PBS before infection with MV (5\u00b410 7 plaqueforming units/ml), or treatment with human recombinant tumor nec rosis factor-alpha (TNFa, 150 units/ml) (Genzyme, MA, US A) for 5 to 30 min. In other experiments, CD46-WT was transiently transfec ted into IMR-32 cells using lipofection method as recommended by the supplier, GenePORTER Transfec tion Reagent (Gene Therapy S ystems, CA, US A). IMR-32 (1\u00b410 7 ) cells were plated in 100 mm culture dishes and incubated at 37 8C in 5% CO 2 for 24 h. The cells were incubated with a mixture of CD46-WT (10 l g) and transfection reagent (50 l l) in 10 ml of serum free EMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM Hepes buffer, 100 units/ ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 0.25 mg/ml gentamycin at 378C in 5% CO 2 for 4 h. The culture medium was replaced with 20% EMEM and further incubated for 48 h.\n\nTo monitor CD46-WT transfection ef\u00aecienc y, direct immuno\u00afuorescenc e analysis of the relative expression of neuronal cell surface molecules was determined using FACScan (B ecton Dickinson). A total of 2\u00b410 6 transfected or untransfected neuronal cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS )/5% fetal calf serum (FCS ) and individually incubated with 20 ll of FITC-conjugated mouse anti-CD46 or 1 lg of FITC-conjugated mouse control IgG isotype (Pharmingen, S an Diego, US A) for 1 h on ice, in 100 ll PBS/5% FCS at 48C and \u00aexed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS . The cells were then analyzed by\u00afow cytometry and the mean uorescenc e intensity of the total cell population was used in the analysis.\n\nIm m uno p re c ipita tio n a nd We ste rn blo tting Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described earlier (Dhib-Jalbut e t a l, 1999). Brie\u00afy, after washing twice in ice-cold PBS , cells were lysed in 1 ml of TNT-E lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X100, 5 mM EDTA) containing the following protease inhibitors: 50 mM sodium\u00afuoride, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM b-glyc erphosphate, 10 mM molybdic acid, 21 l g/ml aprotinin, and 0.2 mM AEBS F (Sigma, MO, US A). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10 000\u00b4g for 10 min at 48C. FLAG epitope-tagged IjBa was immunoprecipitated from the cytosolic extracts of transfected cells, by incubation with 50 ll of agarose beads conjugated to monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (S igma, MO, US A) for 16 h at 4 8C with constant rocking. Native IjBa was immunoprec ipitated from cytosolic extracts of untransfec ted cells, by incubation with 1 lg of anti-IjBa antibody (amino acids 1 \u00b1 28 and 229 \u00b1 317, S anta Cruz, CA, US A) for 2 h, followed by 50 l l of protein A sepharose (Amersham, AB) for 16 h at 48C with constant shaking. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the above TNT-E buffer containing protease inhibitors, heat denatured in 50 l l of 2\u0139 aemmli sample buffer (S igma, MO, USA) for 5 min, fractionated by 15% S DS-polyacrylamide gel elec trophoresis (PAGE) at 75 V for 16 h and electrophoretically transferred to a Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham) at 30 V overnight. Rainbow [ colored protein molecular weight markers (Amersham) was used as an index. Membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (DAKO) containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with a rabbit antiserum (Sigma, MO, US A) against IjBa (1 lg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed three times with TBS -milk, then incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham, 1 : 10,000 dilution) for 1 h. After three washes with TBS, immunoreactive products were detected using enhanced chemiluminescenc e system (Amersham).\n\nThe Western blot \u00aelms were digitized with a video camera and the density of the bands was determined by a universal software 1D main (Advanced American Biotechnology, Fullerton, CA). Values were quantitatively represented in arbitrary units relative to the density of each band, which were normalized against the density of the IjB band immunoprecipitated from untreated cells. The phosphorylated IjB band (IjB p ) density was expressed relative to the density of the hypophosphorylated band (IjB p /IjB) in each lane. The data was expressed as Mean 6 S EM and compared using one way ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Dunnett's test."}
