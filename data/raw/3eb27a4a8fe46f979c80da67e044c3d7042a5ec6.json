{"title": "Supplementary Information Highly Efficient & Practical N-Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalyzed Chemoselective N 1 /C 3 -Functionalization of Isatins with Green Chemistry Principles", "body": "At first, the in situ generated organo-NHC attacks the terminal N-atom of the EDA to form a zwitterionic homoenolate I. While this homoenolate II didn't capture a proton from conjugate acid (DBU-H + ). At this time, the nucleophilic attack of the NHC-zwitterionic species II to the electrophilic C 3 -keto carbonyl site of NUS-isatin forms second zwitterionic species III followed by proton transfer towards the elimination of free-NHC to form aldol-type condensation product \u03b1-diazo-\u03b2-hydroxy ester 7aj. The product formation via NHC/DBU catalyst system can support that the possibility of proton transfer from conjugate acid (DBU-H + ) in aza-Michael addition.
