{"title": "Title: Risk for Transportation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) from Wuhan to Cities in China", "body": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China (1). On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (2). By January 31, 2020, 192 fatalities and 3,215 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported in Wuhan; 8,576 additional cases were spread across >300 cities in mainland China; and 127 exported cases were reported in 23 countries/states spanning Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North America. The rapid global expansion, rising fatalities, unknown animal reservoir, and evidence of person-to-person transmission potential (3, 8) initially resembled the 2003 SARS epidemic and raised concerns about global spread.\n\nOn January 22, 2020, China announced a travel quarantine of Wuhan and by January 30, expanded the radius to include 16 cities, encompassing a population of 45 million. At the time of the quarantine, China was already 2 weeks into the 40-day Spring Festival, during which several billion people travel throughout China to celebrate the Lunar New Year (4) . Considering the timing of exported COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, we estimate that only 8.95% (95% CrI 2.22% -28.72%) of cases infected in Wuhan by January 12 might have been confirmed by January 22, 2020. By limiting our estimate to infections occurring \u226510 days before the quarantine, we account for an estimated 5-6-day incubation period and 4-5 days between symptom onset and case detection (3, 5, 6, 8) (Appendix). The low detection rate coupled with an average lag of 10 days between infection and detection (6) suggest that newly infected persons who traveled out of Wuhan just before the quarantine might have remained infectious and undetected in dozens of cities in China for days to weeks. Moreover, these silent importations already might have seeded sustained outbreaks that were not immediately apparent.\n\nWe estimated the probability of transportation of infectious COVID-19 cases from Wuhan to cities throughout China before January 23 by using a simple model of exponential growth coupled with a stochastic model of human mobility among 369 cities in China (Appendix). Given that an estimated 98% of all trips between Wuhan and other Chinese cities during this period were taken by train or car, our analysis of air, rail, and road travel data yields more granular risk estimates than possible with air passenger data alone (7) .\n\nBy fitting our epidemiologic model to data on the first 19 cases reported outside of China, we estimate an epidemic doubling time of 7.31 days (95% CrI 6.26 -9.66 days) and a cumulative total of 12,400 (95% CrI 3,112-58,465) infections in Wuhan by January 22, 2020 (Appendix). Both estimates are consistent with a recent epidemiologic analysis of the first 425 cases confirmed in Wuhan (8) . By assuming these rates of early epidemic growth, we estimate that 130 cities in China have \u226550% chance of having a COVID-19 case imported from Wuhan in the 3 weeks preceding the quarantine (Figure) . By January 26th, 107 of these high-risk cities had reported cases and 23 had not, including 5 cities with importation probabilities >99% and populations >2 million: Bazhong, Fushun, Laibin, Ziyang, and Chuxiong. Under our lower bound estimate of 6.26 days for the doubling time, 190/369 cities lie above the 50% threshold for importation. Our risk assessment identified several cities throughout China likely to be harboring yet undetected cases of COVID-19 a week after the quarantine, suggesting that early 2020 ground and rail travel seeded cases far beyond the Wuhan region under quarantine.\n\nOur conclusions are based on several key assumptions. To design our mobility model, we used data from Tencent (https://heat.qq.com), a major social media company that hosts applications, including WeChat (\u22481.13 billion active users in 2019) and QQ (\u2248808 million active users in 2019) (9) ; consequently, our model might be demographically biased by the Tencent user base. Further, considerable uncertainty regarding the lag between infection and case detection remains. Our assumption of a 10-day lag is based on early estimates for the incubation period of COVID-19 (8) and prior estimates of the lag between symptom onset and detection for SARS (10) . We expect that estimates for the doubling time and incidence of COVID-19 will improve as reconstructed linelists and more granular epidemiologic data become available (Appendix). However, our key qualitative insights likely are robust to these uncertainties, including extensive pre-quarantine COVID-19 exportations throughout China and far greater case counts in Wuhan than reported before the quarantine. imposed on January 23, 2020. a) Daily travel volume to and from Wuhan, given as a percentage of the Wuhan population.

During this 10-day interval, we labeled cases as infected. Given the uncertainty in these estimates, we also performed the estimates by assuming a shorter delay ( D = 6 days) and a longer delay ( D = 14 days) between infection and case detection (Appendix Table 2 ).\n\nOur model can be improved by incorporating the probability distribution for the delay between infection and detection, as reconstructed linelists ( 14 -17 ) and more granular epidemiologic data are becoming available.\n\nUnder these assumptions, we calculated the number of infectious cases at time, t , by the following:\n\nThe prevalence of infectious cases is given by the following:\n\nin which N = 11.08 million, the population of Wuhan. \u03c9\n\nWe assume that visitors to Wuhan have the same daily risk for infection as residents of Wuhan and construct a nonhomogeneous Poisson process model ( 18 -20 ) to estimate the exportation of COVID-19 by residents of and travelers to Wuhan. Let W j , t denote the number of Wuhan residents that travel to city j at time t , and M j , t denote the number of travelers from city j to Wuhan at time t. Then, the rate at which infected residents of Wuhan travel to city j at time t is given \u03b3 j , t = \u03be( t ) \u00d7 W j , t , and the rate at which travelers from city j get infected in Wuhan and return to their home city while still infected is \u03a8 j , t = \u03be( t ) \u00d7 M j , t . This model assumes that newly infected visitors to Wuhan will return to their home city while still infectious.\n\nBased on this model, the probability of introducing \u22651 cases from Wuhan to city j by time t is given by\n\nwhere t 0 denotes the beginning of the study period, December 1, 2019.\n\nWe applied a likelihood-based method to estimate our model parameters, including the number of initial cases i 0 and the epidemic growth rate \u03bb, from the arrival times of the 19 reported cases transported from Wuhan to 11 cities outside of China, as of January 22, 2020 (Appendix Table 1 ). All 19 cases were Wuhan residents. We aggregated all other cities without cases reported by January 22, 2020 into a single location ( j = 0).\n\nLet N j denote the number of infected Wuhan residents who were detected in location j outside of China, denote the time at which the i -th Wuhan resident case was detected in location j , \u03c7 j, 0 denote the time at which international surveillance for infected travelers from Wuhan began (January 1, 2020) ( 21 ) , and E denote the end of the study period (January 22, 2020).

Then, the likelihood for all 19 cases reported outside of China by January 22, 2020 is given by . which yields the following log-likelihoo d function:\n\nWe directly estimated the number of initial cases, i 0 , on December 1, 2019, and the epidemic growth rate, \u03bb, during December 1, 2019-January 22, 2020. We infer the epidemic parameters in a Bayesian framework by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling and noninformative flat prior. From these, we derive the doubling time of incident cases as d T = log(2)/\u03bb and the cumulative number of cases and of reported cases by January 22, 2020. We also derived the basic reproduction number by assuming a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovery (SEIR) model for COVID-19, in which the incubation period is exponentially distributed with mean L in the range of 3 -6 days and the infectious period is also exponentially distributed with mean Z in the range of 2 to 7 days. The reproduction number is then given by\n\nWe estimated the case detection rate in Wuhan by taking the ratio between the number of reported cases in Wuhan by January 22, 2020 and our estimates for the number of infections occurring \u226510 days prior (i.e., by January 12, 2020). We truncated our estimate 10 days before the quarantine to account for the estimated time between infection and case detection, assuming a 5-6 day incubation period ( 4 , 7 -11 ) followed by 4-5 days between symptom onset and case 9 .
