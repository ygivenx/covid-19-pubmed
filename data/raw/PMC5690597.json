{"title": "Suppression and resolution of autoimmune arthritis by rhesus \u03b8-defensin-1, an immunomodulatory macrocyclic peptide", "body": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that affects 0.5 to 1% the world population [1]. RA is typically characterized by symmetric polyarthritis involving the extremities with erosive joint changes mediated by hyperplastic synovium (pannus) and chronic inflammation [1]. Disease severity is associated with elevated production of inflammatory cytokines and activities of tissue degrading proteases [1]. While the etiology of RA is incompletely understood, studies in rodent RA models have provided major insights into the pathophysiology of RA including the discovery of dysregulation of cytokine signaling networks, providing bases for the development of new treatments. Central roles of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 [2, 3] have provided rationale for therapies targeting these arthritogenic cytokines. While these and other interventions have greatly improved disease control and the quality of life of RA patients, the majority of patients achieve moderate and incomplete disease control, and remission is achieved in only 10\u201315% of patients [4]. Side effects of approved RA therapeutics have limited their use in a number of patient populations [5]. Thus, new and more efficacious therapies are needed for RA and major efforts are underway to identify and develop novel treatment strategies.\n\nDefensins are host defense peptides, composed of three evolutionarily related structural families (designated as \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b8-defensins) that function as antimicrobial effectors of innate immunity [6, 7]. While most mammals express \u03b1- and \u03b2-defensins, \u03b8-defensins are unique to Old World monkeys, and are absent in other primates including humans and other hominids [6]. \u03b8-defensins are macrocyclic, tridisulfide-stabilized 18-amino acid molecules produced by post-translational head-to-tail splicing of two nonapeptides (Fig 1) [8]. They are the only known cyclic polypeptides in animals, and their conformation confers remarkable stability in vitro and in vivo [9, 10]. Six and ten \u03b8-defensin isoforms are produced in rhesus monkeys [11] and baboons [12], respectively.\n\nRTD-1 (Fig 1) is the prototype \u03b8-defensin and has therapeutic efficacy in infectious disease models. The peptide was highly effective in reducing lethality in mice with experimental severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [14] and in murine models of E. coli and polymicrobial sepsis [9]. Therapeutic effects of RTD-1 were mediated, at least in part, by modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vitro studies revealed that RTDs suppress expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 [9, 14] by TLR agonist-stimulated leukocytes, and the anti-inflammatory effects are mediated by regulation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways [15]. These studies suggest that \u03b8-defensins are pleiotropic peptides that evolved to neutralize pathogens and modulate inflammation. To further test this concept, we evaluated the effect of RTD-1 on the course of pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in DA rats, a model of autoimmune arthritis that shares many features of human RA [16]. Based on the finding that RTD-1 was effective in dose-dependently suppressing and resolving PIA, we conducted studies to identify mechanisms that may mediate the therapeutic efficacy observed.\n\nAnimal use was approved by the University of Southern California (USC) Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (protocols 11355 and 20378). Sequential blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analyses was performed by Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. (BASi, West Lafayette, IN), an AAALAC-accredited facility. All animal studies were in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation with confirmation by thoracotomy per IACUC guidelines.\n\nMethotrexate (MTX; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was prepared in saline. Etanercept (Enbrel\u2122; Immunex Corp., Thousand Oaks, CA) was obtained from the USC Investigational Drug Service Pharmacy and was reconstituted per manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nThe hydrochloride salt of RTD-1 was prepared as previously reported [8, 13] producing highly pure (> 98%) material as assessed by analytical reverse-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) and tandem mass spectrometry. Sterile stock solutions of RTD-1 were dissolved in normal saline and stored at 4\u20138\u00b0C.\n\nFemale DA/OlaHsd (D blood group allele and Agouti, also known as Dark Agouti), rats were obtained from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). Animals were allowed to acclimate for 48\u201372 hours prior to experimental use. Animals were fed standard chow ad lib during a 12-hour day/night cycle. PIA was induced in 5\u20137 week old animals (90\u2013100 gm) by intradermal injection of 250 \u03bcl pristane (Sigma) divided into 3\u20135 sites at the base of the tail [17]. Animals were monitored daily and disease severity of each limb was scored 0\u20134 using the method of Brand et al. [18]. The severity scores for all limbs of individual animals were totaled to give an individual\u2019s arthritis severity score (AS) ranging from zero for normal animals to maximum disease score of sixteen. Disease severity was assessed by at least two scorers and the inter-rater agreement (kappa) value was 0.806 as determined using MedCalc Statistical Software version 14.8.1 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). In three separate trials, treatment was also blinded to scorers. There was no statistical difference between blinded and unblinded scoring of any treatment cohort. Treatment with saline (vehicle), RTD-1, or anti-arthritic agents was randomized and initiated when an animal first presented with an AS of 3 or more. RTD-1 was administered subcutaneously with doses ranging from 0.2 to 5.0 mg/kg in an injection volume of 0.5 ml at intervals ranging from once a day (qd) to once every seven days (q7d). MTX was administered at 0.25 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection q3d [19]. Etanercept was administered at 0.4 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection q3d [20, 21].\n\nLimbs from euthanized animals were preserved in buffered formalin, decalcified, embedded, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) in the USC Research Model Pathology Core. Microscopic images were acquired with a Nikon-Microphot FXA with SPOT 5.1 image capture software.\n\nEight to 12-week old male Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan) were fitted with a surgically implanted jugular vein catheter for sequential blood collection (Culex NxT Automated In Vivo Sampling System; BASi, West Lafayette, IN), and monitored daily. RTD-1 dissolved in saline was injected subcutaneously at 5 mg/kg to 4 animals. Approximately 200 \u03bcl of blood was collected before peptide administration and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h after RTD-1 injection. Blood was collected into vials containing K3EDTA and plasma was collected after centrifugation. Plasma concentrations of RTD-1 were determined after solid phase extraction (SPE) by weak cation exchange (Oasis WCX, Waters, Milford, MA) and quantitation by C18 RP-UPLC, photodiode array (PDA) detection, and electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Chromatography was performed on an Acquity H-class UPLC with an analytical PDA detector using Empower 3 software (Waters). Quantitative mass spectrometry was performed on post PDA eluent using a Micromass Quattro Ultima mass spectrometer with MassLynx 4.1 (Waters). Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using parametric population modeling with maximum likelihood estimation via the EM algorithm with sampling (MLEM) as implemented in the ADAPT 5 (Version 5.0.49) PK/PD Systems Analysis Software (Biomedical Simulations Resource, University of Southern California).\n\nSaline (control) and RTD-1 (5 mg/kg, s.c., qd) treated PIA rats were euthanized 4 days after disease onset (AS \u2265 3). The ankle joints and feet were snap frozen in liquid N2 and pulverized with mortar and pestle as described [22]. One gram of tissue powder was extracted with 5 ml of ice cold 10 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS) containing protease inhibitor tablets (cOmplete ULTRA with EDTA; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Samples were vortexed for 30 seconds and extracts clarified by centrifugation. Supernatant IL-1\u03b2 was quantified by ELISA (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY).\n\nFibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were isolated by enzymatic digestion of the synovial tissue from DA rats with PIA as previously described [23]. Cells were washed and suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Grand Island, NY), 30 mg/ml L-glutamine (Sigma), 250 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin B (Sigma), and 10 mg/ml gentamicin (Gibco). After overnight culture, non-adherent cells were removed and adherent cells were cultured to approximately 70\u201390% confluence and passaged following detachment with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 3 min at 37\u00b0C. All experiments were performed with FLS after at least four passages.\n\nFLS invasiveness was assayed in vitro using Matrigel-coated inserts in a transwell system (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) as previously described [23]. Briefly, DA rat FLS (70\u201380% confluent) isolated as described above were suspended at 2.0 \u00d7 104 cells/well in serum-free DMEM. Cells were placed in the upper compartment of the Matrigel-coated inserts to which RTD-1 was added to final concentrations of 0.1, 1, or 10 \u03bcg/ml. The lower compartment contained complete medium with 10% FBS and plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C. After 24 hours the upper surface of the insert was wiped with cotton swabs to remove non-invading cells and the Matrigel layer. The opposite side of the insert was stained with Crystal Violet (Sigma) and the total number of invading cells was counted at 100X magnification. Experiments were performed in duplicate on seven cell lines each generated from the synovial tissue of individual DA rats with PIA.\n\nFLS were cultured in 12-well plates at 4\u20136 \u00d7 104 cells/well for 24 h (viability > 95% by trypan blue staining). Medium was replaced and FLS were incubated with TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 at final concentrations of 3 or 10 ng/ml plus RTD-1 (10 \u03bcg/ml in 0.01% acetic acid (HOAc)) or vehicle alone. After 24 h incubation, FLS culture supernatants were removed, clarified by centrifugation, and analyzed for IL-6 by ELISA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).\n\nFLS were seeded at 3 \u00d7 103 cells/well in a 96-well TC treated plate (Greiner). Cells were allowed to adhere for 18 h and medium was replaced prior to addition of peptide or vehicle. RTD-1 was added to wells at final concentrations of 0\u201330 \u03bcg/ml in culture medium and incubated for 0, 24, or 48 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. FLS cell number was determined by DNA staining using CyQuant Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Invitrogen) per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cellular toxicity was determined by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) using a CytoTox 96 Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega Bio Sciences, San Luis Obispo, CA) in FLS supernatants. All assays were performed with \u2265 7 replicates.\n\nRTD-1 was analyzed for enzymatic inhibition against zinc metalloproteases ADAM17, ADAM10, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 13, and 14, and cysteine cathepsins (Cats) B, C, H, K, L, S, and V (Table 1). ADAM10 and ADAM17 activities were measured by release of fluorogenic peptides cleaved from pro-TNF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). ADAM10 was diluted to 0.05 \u03bcg/ml and ADAM17 to 0.1 \u03bcg/ml with 25 mM TRIS, 2.5 \u03bcM ZnCl2, 0.005% Brij35, pH 9.0 and incubated with 0 to 3 \u03bcg/ml RTD-1 dissolved in 0.01% HOAc. Assay was initiated by addition of substrate (10 \u03bcM final) and enzymatic activity measured at 37\u00b0C (ADAM10) or 22\u00b0C (ADAM17) every 30 seconds for 1 h in a SpectraMax M5e fluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with 320 nm excitation and 405 nm emission.\n\nRTD-1 inhibition of Cat B (BPS Bioscience, San Diego, CA) and Cats C, H, K, L, S, and V (R & D Systems) was analyzed in a 96 well format with enzyme-specific substrates per manufacturer\u2019s instructions and as described in Table 1. The activity of each enzyme was determined in the presence of 0 to 50 \u03bcg/ml RTD-1.\n\nInhibition of MMPs by RTD-1 was performed as described [24], incubating each enzyme with 0\u2013100 \u03bcg/ml of RTD-1. IC50 values were calculated by GraphPad Prism 5.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) utilizing a non-linear curve fit of log [inhibitor] versus response with variable slope.\n\nAdult DA or Sprague-Dawley rats were challenged s.c. with 5 mg/kg RTD-1 every day (15\u201342 injections), or every other day (8 injections). Several animals were boosted 2 months later, prior to serum or plasma collection. Immune responses were analyzed by dot blot on nitrocellulose membranes as described in legend to the figure.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed utilizing GraphPad Prism 5.01. All sample populations were tested for normality using a D\u2019Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test. P-values were generated in parametric sample means by student\u2019s t-test while non-parametric sample medians were compared by Mann-Whitney U-test. Number of replicates and/or total number of animals are shown in figure legends or within the figures.\n\nThe anti-arthritic effects of RTD-1 were tested in DA/OlaHsd rats with PIA, a well-characterized model of chronic RA [16, 22, 25\u201327]. Animals with evolving PIA (arthritis severity score, AS \u2265 3) were scored, randomly assigned to a treatment group, and treated daily with subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of saline or 5 mg/kg of RTD-1 for 11 days (Fig 2A). RTD-1 treatment significantly reduced arthritis progression within 24 h of the first administered dose (P = 0.0064; Fig 2A). RTD-1 treated rats had markedly lower (69% reduction of mean) AS at the end of the observation period compared with vehicle controls (P < 0.0001; Fig 2B). Additionally, complete resolution of disease (AS = 0) occurred in 29% (9 of 31) of RTD-1 treated animals compared to 2.5% (1 of 40) of saline treated animals (P = 2.9 \u00d7 10\u221217, Chi-squared) (Fig 2B). Further, RTD-1 treatment resulted in restoration of limb function and mobility (typical response shown in Supplemental S1 Video).\n\nJoints from vehicle-treated PIA rats showed extensive swelling, synovial hyperplasia, invasive pannus, and erosion of cartilage and bone (Fig 2, panels 5\u20138; S1 Fig). In contrast, RTD-1 treatment markedly reduced erythema and swelling of the affected joints (Fig 2, panel 9) and dramatic improvement in function and weight bearing (S1 Video). The clinical improvement in RTD-1-treated rats correlated with preservation of normal joint histology (Fig 2; panels 10\u201312; S1 Fig) that was similar to limbs of na\u00efve animals (Fig 2, panels 1\u20134, and S1 Fig), as joints from peptide-treated animals were devoid of synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory infiltration, angiogenesis, and erosive changes preserving a normal architecture.\n\nRTD-1 treatment was also effective in resolving advanced PIA. Rats with near maximum disease (AS \u226512) received daily s.c. injections of saline or 5 mg/kg of RTD-1, peptide treatment was continued until disease resolution (AS = 0) was achieved (6\u20139 RTD-1 treatments). Peptide treatment produced a rapid reduction in arthritis severity, which reached statistical significance within 48 hours of the start of treatment (P < 0.044), with complete resolution of clinical disease in all RTD-1 treated rats by day 15 (Fig 3A). As with animals treated in early PIA (Fig 2A), RTD-1 treatment of animals with severe PIA restored normal limb function and mobility (S2 Video). Of note, after a disease-free interval ranging from 4\u201312 weeks, three of five RTD-1 treated animals relapsed with joint disease (average AS score of ~3).\n\nEfficacy of RTD-1 treatment was compared with etanercept (Etan) and methotrexate (MTX), first line RA drugs that have also been studied in rodent models of arthritis such as rat PIA [1, 19\u201322]. While both Etan and MTX limited the progression of arthritis by day 3 of treatment compared to vehicle controls (Fig 3B), treatment with RTD-1 had a more pronounced effect by treatment day 11 than either Etan or MTX, (P = 3.56 \u00d7 10\u22125, P = 0.0059, respectively). Additionally, RTD-1 achieved the highest rate of complete disease resolution (25%) compared to MTX (4.5%) or Etan (0%) (Fig 3C).\n\nThe anti-arthritic effects of RTD-1 in PIA were dose-dependent, with AS reductions observed with doses as low as 1 mg/kg (Fig 4A). Further, dosing of RTD-1 at 5 mg/kg was equally effective whether administered daily or once every 2, 3, or 5 days (Fig 4B). Analysis of single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of s.c. administered RTD-1 revealed that the peptide disposition is best described by a 2-compartment model with relatively rapid distribution (clearance and half-life of 22.3 ml/kg/h and 0.285 h, respectively), but prolonged terminal elimination [RTD-1 clearance = 3.55 ml/kg/hr (\u00b10.286)] and half-life of 32.3 h \u00b110.4 (Fig 4C). These PK parameters are consistent with the finding that RTD-1 is highly stable in human [9] and rat plasma and that q5d dosing is as effective as daily dosing (Fig 4B).\n\nTo evaluate the immunogenicity of RTD-1, we challenged DA and Sprague Dawley rats with serial (8\u201342 daily) s.c. injections of 5 mg/kg RTD-1. Serum or plasma samples from animals were analyzed for humoral response by dot immunoblot assay. No anti-RTD-1 Ig was detected in any peptide-challenged animal (Fig 5), consistent with previous failed attempts to generate antibodies with unmodified RTD-1 [9].\n\nIL-1\u03b2 plays a central role in the pathogenesis of RA [28] and rodent arthritis [29\u201331]. In previous studies, we showed that RTD-1 suppresses IL-1\u03b2 expression and release by immune-stimulated monocytes [9, 15]. We therefore analyzed the effect of RTD-1 administration on joint levels of IL-1\u03b2 in PIA rats. Consistent with other studies, IL-1\u03b2 was not detectable in joints of na\u00efve rats, but levels were markedly elevated in diseased joints of PIA rats and joint IL-1\u03b2 levels correlated with arthritis severity score of the corresponding limb (Pearson r = 0.4923, P = 0.0013; Fig 6A). PIA rats with established disease (AS \u2265 3) were treated s.c. once a day for four days with 5 mg/kg RTD-1 or vehicle after which joint tissue from euthanized animals was analyzed for IL-1\u03b2. Peptide treatment reduced joint IL-1\u03b2 by an average of 44% (P = 0.0054, Fig 6B), which coincided with the marked reduction in arthritis severity in RTD-1 treated animals after 4 days of treatment (P = 0.0044; Fig 2A).\n\nIL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine, also implicated in RA pathogenesis by inducing differentiation of Th-17 cells, joint damaging proteases, angiogenesis, synoviocyte invasion [32, 33], and bone loss [34]. Stimulation of FLS from arthritic DA rats with TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 dose-dependently induced IL-6 production, consistent with previous studies [35, 36]. RTD-1 significantly inhibited IL-6 production (27.3\u201342.2% reduction) by FLS (Fig 6C).\n\nArthritogenic cytokines stimulate the proliferation and invasion of FLS, and the in vitro invasive properties of these cells mediate and correlate with erosive joint changes in RA and PIA [23, 25, 37, 38]. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of RTD-1 on FLS proliferation and invasiveness. RTD-1 dose-dependently suppressed FLS proliferation when analyzed after 24 or 48 hours in culture (Fig 6D) and this effect was not a result of cytotoxicity as cell viability was \u2265 98% in all samples. RTD-1 also dose-dependently suppressed FLS invasion of Matrigel-coated inserts (Fig 6E). The invasion-suppressive effects were observed at low concentrations (100 ng/ml) and were highly reproducible against seven independent DA rat FLS cell lines (Fig 6F).\n\nRTD-1 is a potent and extremely rapid inhibitor of TNF\u03b1 release by LPS-stimulated leukocytes [9]. Based on the kinetics of these effects, we hypothesized that RTD-1 inhibits TNF\u03b1 release by inhibition of TNF\u03b1 converting enzyme (TACE; ADAM17) [39]. RTD-1 was found to be a potent inhibitor of ADAM17 as well as ADAM10, a related proTNF sheddase (Table 1). Additional studies, currently underway, disclose that RTD-1 rapidly and reversibly inhibits TACE (manuscript in preparation).\n\nWith the finding that RTD-1 inhibits ADAMs 17 and 10, both of which are zinc metalloproteinases, we tested for peptide effects on zinc matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) implicated in cartilage degradation in RA. RTD-1 selectively inhibited pathogenic MMPs 2, 8, 9, 13, and 14, with IC50 values ranging from 2 to 20 \u03bcM (Table 1). In parallel we analyzed the effects of RTD-1 on cysteine proteases implicated in RA. Surprisingly, RTD-1 also inhibited cysteine cathepsins B, C, K, L, and V, with its greatest potency against cathepsin K (IC50\n~ 27 nM; Table 1). Cathepsin K is the protease primarily responsible for degradation of bone matrix by osteoclasts [40]. These data indicate that RTD-1 is a cross class anti-protease that inhibits TNF\u03b1 activation and matrix degrading proteinases implicated in RA joint damage.\n\nDespite advances in RA treatment over the past 15 years, there persists an unmet need for more widely effective therapies given the significant fraction of patients who are partial responders or who are ineligible candidates for existing drugs [4]. Previous studies disclosed that RTD-1 modulates inflammatory cytokine expression in rodent infectious disease models [9, 14] and in immune-stimulated human leukocytes [9, 15]. In those studies, arthritogenic cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6) were among those down-regulated by RTD-1. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that RTD-1 would alter the course of disease in a rodent model of RA wherein disease onset and progression are driven by TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6. The studies reported here employed rat PIA since this T-cell dependent disease model mimics human RA, including symmetrical involvement of peripheral joints, destruction of cartilage and bone, dysregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, rheumatoid factor positivity, and its chronic course. PIA is dependent on MHC class II-restricted T-cells [26] and influenced by non-MHC genes, producing cellular and humoral autoimmunity [16, 25, 41]. Non-MHC genes that influence rat PIA arthritis severity include TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 [42], IL-6, IL-17 [43], and CCL-2, and joint damaging MMPs [25, 44]. Rat PIA is increasingly utilized as a model for preclinical evaluation of human RA drug candidates [16].\n\nHere we report that RTD-1, the prototype \u03b8-defensin, rapidly arrests PIA in DA rats and peptide treatment resulted in high rates of disease resolution. Therapeutic effects were rapid, and dose level and dose interval dependent. RTD-1 induced disease resolution more effectively than a TNF\u03b1 inhibitor or MTX, and at rates exceeding that reported using a mouse anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody [45], or the < 10% remission rate observed in treated RA patients [46]. Moreover, arrest of disease progression and resolution of arthritis was obtained with RTD-1 treatment in early and in severe stages of PIA, and therapeutic responses correlated with marked reductions in limb swelling, and recovery of limb function and mobility. In our studies on the effect of RTD-1 on evolving disease, resolution of clinical arthritis corresponded to histologic joint morphology which disclosed that treated animals had essentially normal joint structures whereas those from control animals showed severe pannus formation, chronic inflammation, and erosion (Fig 2C and S1 Fig). In this study, we did not perform histologic evaluation of joints from RTD-1 treated animals with maximum established disease (Fig 3A). Of note, peptide treatment of severely arthritic animals induced a higher frequency of complete clinical resolution (Fig 3A; S2 Video) than occurred with treatment of animals with evolving disease (Fig 2B), and this may be of translational significance since treatment of RA is usually initiated once disease is well established. We hypothesize that this somewhat paradoxical finding reflects pleiotropic anti-arthritic RTD-1 mechanisms which differentially affect the pathophysiology of evolving and established severe disease. Studies are underway to identify pathologic and/or resolution-promoting processes modulated by RTD-1 at different stages of PIA. Evaluation of the effect of RTD-1 in another animal model of RA, such as collagen induced arthritis, is likely to provide additional insights into anti-arthritic mechanisms mediated by \u03b8-defensins.\n\nOur data suggest that RTD-1 modulates arthritogenic pathways at more than one level. For example, down-regulation of inflammatory cytokine expression has been shown to occur at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, the former revealed in studies on THP-1 macrophages wherein RTD-1 was shown to down-regulate MAP kinases and NF-\u0138B activation, inhibiting transcription of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, CCL-3, and CCL-4 [15]. Post-translational regulation of arthritogenic mediators is exemplified by the rapid and potent inhibition of ADAM17 by RTD-1 which blocks TNF\u03b1 release [39]. Consistent with this effect, RTD-1 treatment of PIA rats suppressed expression of joint IL-1\u03b2, a central mediator of arthritis which is upregulated by TNF\u03b1 [35, 47]. RTD-1 also acts directly on FLS to reduce the production of IL-6 and reduces cell invasiveness, two processes involved in joint damage. Studies are underway to further delineate the pathways that mediate RTD-1 modulation of other inflammatory/arthritogenic cytokine networks implicated in RA.\n\nThe inhibitory action of RTD-1 on arthritogenic proteases, including MMPs and cathepsin K, suggests another anti-arthritic mechanism that may be operative in vivo. Results of the current study demonstrate that RTD-1 is a cross class anti-protease that inhibits zinc metalloproteinases (ADAMs and MMPs) and cysteine cathepsins. The inhibitory potency of RTD-1 against a panel of MMPs and cathepsins varies substantially, but plasma levels (Cmax) achieved following s.c. treatment approximate or exceed the IC50s of ADAM17 and cathepsin K, potentially providing a rapid mechanism for regulating these arthritogenic proteases, in the former case down-regulating local TNF\u03b1 levels and downstream effects (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, MMP expression). This may also contribute to inhibition of FLS invasiveness mediated by low concentrations of RTD-1.\n\n\u03b8-defensins are expressed at high levels in leukocytes and other tissues of Old World monkeys [8, 11\u201313]. However, \u03b8-defensins are absent in hominids as a result of pseudogenization of \u03b8-defensin precursor genes during primate evolution [48]. Evidence suggests that the expression of \u03b8-defensins in rhesus macaque neutrophils underlies the superior antimicrobial properties of azurophil granules from these cells, compared to those of humans [11]. Further, \u03b8-defensins possess unique immunomodulatory properties lacking in human \u03b1- and \u03b2-defensins [9, 15], potentially contributing to the marked resistance of \u03b8-defensin expressing monkeys (e.g., macaques, vervets, and baboons) to endotoxin [49].\n\nThe results of this study indicate that \u03b8-defensin-like cyclic peptides have potential as new agents for treatment of RA. RTD-1 itself is a pharmaceutical candidate as this naturally occurring molecule is well tolerated when administered subcutaneously (this study and ref. [9]), and by intravenous, intramuscular, and intraperitoneal routes (our unpublished results). RTD-1 was non-immunogenic (Fig 5), circumventing the development of neutralizing antibodies, a problem encountered by a subset of patients in response to biologic therapeutics [50]. Further, RTD-1 is highly stable in biological matrices [9], has an unusually long terminal half-life allowing for infrequent dosing (Fig 4), and shows no evidence of being immuno-compromising [9, 14]. The concept of using a nonhuman primate peptide represents a novel retroevolutionary therapeutic paradigm whereby products of genes expressed in Old World monkeys may be used to treat a human autoimmune disorder."}
