{"title": "Allelic Variation in the Toll-Like Receptor Adaptor Protein Ticam2 Contributes to SARS-Coronavirus Pathogenesis in Mice", "body": "Recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) was propagated on Vero E6 cells. For virus titration, the lower half of the right lung was homogenized in PBS and plated for plaque assay using Vero E6 cells to give plaque forming units (PFU) per lung with a detection limit of 100 PFU (Deming et al. 2006). All experiments were performed in a class II biological safety cabinet in a certified biosafety level 3 laboratory containing redundant exhaust fans by workers wearing personnel protective equipment, including Tyvek suits, hoods, and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs).\n\nPreCC mice were infected and assayed as described previously (Gralinski et al. 2015). CC003/Unc and CC053/Unc mice were obtained from the UNC Systems Genetics Core. F1 and F2 mice were bred in house from these two parent lines, and infected at 9\u201311 wk of age. Both male and female mice were used for F1 and F2 studies, while the preCC used only female mice. F2 mice were identified by earpunch and randomly cohoused at the time of weaning; a tail snip for DNA extraction was also taken at that time. Ticam2-deficient mice on a C57BL/6 background were obtained from the Heise laboratory (UNC), originally created by Yamamoto et al. (2003). All mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine, intranasally infected with 105 PFU of MA15 in a 50 \u03bcl volume, and weighed daily. Mice were acclimated to BSL3 housing for a minimum of 7 d prior to infection. All mouse studies were performed at the University of North Carolina (Animal Welfare Assurance #A3410-01) using protocols approved by the UNC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n\nGenomic DNA was isolated from tail tissue using the Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit protocol, and was quantified and assessed for purity using a Nanodrop instrument (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). Genomic DNA (\u223c1.5 \u03bcg) was sent from each animal to Neogen Inc. (Lincoln, NE) for array hybridization on the MUGA array (Morgan et al. 2015). Genotypes were called by the vendor using the GenCall algorithm implemented in the Illumina BeadStudio software. Quality checks and further analysis used the argyle package (Morgan 2015) for the R environment (www.cran.r-project.org).\n\nWe selected those SNP markers behaving in a biallelic manner between replicate samples of CC003/Unc and CC053/Unc (Threadgill and Churchill 2012a), and, using the argyle package, we used the thin.genotypes() function to arrive at a set of 304 biallelic markers evenly spaced across the genome for QTL mapping. We exported these data into the R/QTL (Arends et al. 2010) package using argyle\u2019s as.rqtl.genotypes() function, and mapped QTL for each of the measured phenotypic traits using the scanone() function in rqtl. Specifically, the scanone() function fits a model:yi=m+Bxi+\u03b5where yi is the phenotypic value of individual i, m is the population mean, xi is the genotype at a putative QTL, and \u03b5 is the error term, with \u0392 being the estimated effect of transitioning from one allele to another at the putative QTL. Scanone() uses standard interval mapping (Lander and Botstein 1989) to assess the significance of fit of this model relative to the null model:yi=m+\u03b5.Significance was assessed for each phenotype using 500 permutations. QTL regions were denoted using a 1.5 LOD-drop method.\n\nWe next utilized the scantwo() function of R/QTL to assess the likelihood of higher order interactions between pairs of loci. Scantwo() fits a series of models looking at the fit of two loci as a full model:yi=m+Bax1i+Bbx2i+Bc{x1i\u2217x2i}+\u03b5where x1i and x2i are the genotypes at two putative loci, and x1i*x2i is a representation of the combination of these two genotypes. In this case, Ba is the estimated effect of transitioning between alleles at putative locus 1, Bb the estimated effect of transitioning between alleles at putative locus 2, and Bc is the estimated interaction effect of transitioning between alleles within each locus. Scantwo() also assesses the fit of an additive model:yi=m+Bax1i+Bbx2i+eBoth of these models, as well as a pure-interaction model (Full model fit-Additive model fit) are then assessed relative to a null model:yi=m+e.Significance in these situations was assessed using a total of 250 permutations.\n\nSARS-CoV F2 phenotypes were compared by Pearson correlation using Graphpad Prism, and raw P-values are reported. Ticam2\u2212/\u2212 and C57BL/6J phenotypes were compared by unpaired Student\u2019s t-test. The percentage of phenotypic variation each QTL contributed (as reported in Table 1) were assessed using the lm() function in R, and determining the SSgenotype/SStotal fraction at each peak marker at a QTL.\n\nComplete F2 phenotypes, along with the subset of genotypic markers used for mapping, are available in Supplemental Material, Table S1. F1 and Ticam2\u2212/\u2212 data are available in Table S3. Genotype data are available at Zenodo (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.401060) and also at http://www.med.unc.edu/mmrrc/genotypes/. QTL outputs for D3 weight loss, D4 weight loss, Log10 Titer, and hemorrhage are available in Table S4, Table S5, Table S6, and Table S7.\n\nF1 mice were bred to generate 264 F2 mice for challenge with SARS-CoV. All mice were infected with 105 PFU of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) at 9\u201311 wk of age, and monitored daily for weight loss and signs of disease until harvest at 4 d postinfection. Unlike the F1 mice, which had a narrow range of disease, F2 mice showed expanded phenotypes, exceeding both the range of weight loss and titer observed in the parents (Figure 2). Two percent (4/264) of F2 mice gained weight over the course of the 4 d infection, and an additional 41% (108/264) of F2 animals lost 0\u201310% of their starting weight, marking them as relatively resistant to infection (Figure 2A). Thirty-seven percent (99/264) of animals were moderately susceptible, losing between 10 and 20% of their starting weight by day 4 postinfection. Twenty percent of animals were extremely susceptible to infection, losing either over 20% of their starting weight (12%, 33/264) or succumbing to infection (8%, 20/264). Notably, 28% of F2 mice showed transient weight loss, and began to recover from infection by day 4; they are represented in both the 0\u201310% and 10\u201320% weight loss groups. Overall, the weight loss results highlight the range and diversity of the F2 progeny\u2019s host response to SARS-CoV infection.\n\nIn addition to weight loss, other markers of pathogenesis demonstrate the variability of the F2 response to SARS-CoV. Lung titers were assessed by plaque assay for all surviving F2 mice, and titers ranged from <103 PFU per lung to >107 PFU per lung (Figure 2B). Notably, significant correlation was observed between weight loss and titer (Pearson\u2019s r \u22120.5553, P < 0.0001, Figure 2C) at day 4 postinfection. Both male and female F2 mice had similar ranges of weight loss and virus load in the lung (Figure S1); in addition, both showed significant correlations between the two phenotypes. Pulmonary hemorrhage was assessed at the time of tissue harvest, and illustrated a spectrum of disease. F2 mice ranged from no hemorrhage (85 mice with a score of zero) (Figure 2D) to extreme hemorrhage (42 mice with a score of 3 or 4). Hemorrhage was significantly correlated with both day 4 weight loss (r of \u22120.699, P < 0.0001) and titer (r of 0.487, P < 0.0001). Table S1 contains the full phenotypic data for all F2 mice including lung histopathology scoring.\n\nF2 mice were genotyped using the MUGA array, and we conducted QTL mapping using 304 evenly spaced and informative markers using R/QTL (Arends et al. 2010). We identified five QTL associated with a variety of traits: one locus on Chr18 (Host response to SARS QTL #5, Hrs5) was associated with weight loss at day 3 and day 4 postinfection, viral titer, pulmonary hemorrhage (Figure 3), vascular cuffing, and edema histopathology phenotypes (Figure S2). Trait-specific QTL were also identified for day 3 weight loss (Hrs6 Chr 9), viral titer (Hrs7 Chr 7, Hrs8 Chr 12), and hemorrhage (Hrs9 Chr 15). Analysis of the chromosome 18 multi-trait QTL indicated a phenotypic contribution of 6.6% of day 3 weight loss, 8.5% of day 4 weight loss, 12.9% of variation in viral titer, 6% of hemorrhage, and a consensus region of 27.1\u201358.6 Mb (all QTL are summarized in Table 1). Table S4, Table S5, Table S6, and Table S7 show the complete QTL mapping files, with the LOD score at each of the 304 markers used.\n\nGiven the number of loci segregating within this cross, we next assessed if there was evidence of epistatic interactions between these loci. We found strong support for additive interactions between Hrs5 and Hrs6 for day 3 weight loss (LOD = 8.27, genome-wide P = 0.05 threshold = 6.25), and also between Hrs5 and Hrs9 for hemorrhage (LOD = 9.43, genome-wide P = 0.05 threshold = 6.4). We found evidence for a full model of interaction (that is both additive and epistatic interactions) for viral titers between Hrs7 and Hrs8 (LOD = 13.3, genome-wide P = 0.05 threshold = 11.4), as well as between Hrs7 and Hrs5 (LOD = 17.5, genome-wide P = 0.05 threshold = 11.4) (Figure 4).\n\nWe determined which ancestral (CC founder strain) alleles were segregating at each QTL in order to better understand the architecture of the QTL and SARS-CoV-associated responses we identified. Throughout the Hrs5 region, CC003/Unc has a PWK-derived allele, whereas CC053/Unc had a PWK (27.1\u201331.2 Mb), and then a C57BL/6J (31.2\u201351) or a C57BL/6J and 129s1/SvImJ (51\u201358.6 Mb) region of uncertainty (Figure S3). The shared PWK/PhJ haplotype at the proximal end of the locus functionally reduced the QTL region to 31.2\u201358.6 Mb, and, at the most highly associated marker (JAX00083358, Chr18:51.41 Mb), we found that the CC003/Unc PWK-derived allele was associated with enhanced disease relative to the CC053/Unc C57BL/6J-derived allele\u2014a case of transgressive segregation (Figure 5). Hrs6 had the CC003/Unc haplotype (C57BL/6J) associated with reduced weight loss as compared to the CC053/Unc haplotype (WSB/EiJ). Hrs7 showed the CC003/UNC haplotype (PWK/PhJ 55.1\u201369 Mb; C57BL/6J 69\u201378 Mb; 129s1SvImJ 78\u201390 Mb; C57BL/6J and 129s1/SvImJ 90\u2013117.22 Mb) was associated with reduced viral titers as compared to the CC053/Unc haplotype (C57BL/6J and WSB/EiJ uncertainty 55.1\u201358 Mb; WSB/EiJ and PWK/PhJ uncertainty 58\u201381 Mb; WSB/EiJ 81\u2013117.22 Mb). Hrs8 had the CC003/Unc haplotype (NOD/ShiLtJ) associated with lower viral titers than the CC053/UNC haplotype (WSB/EiJ 81.6\u201388.9 Mb; WSB/EiJ and CAST/EiJ uncertainty 88.9\u2013108 Mb). Lastly, Hrs9 had the CC003/Unc haplotype (PWK/PhJ centromere\u201330 Mb, NZO/Hilt and PWK/PhJ uncertainty 30\u201336 Mb, PWK/PhJ 36\u201364.4 Mb) associated with lower pulmonary hemorrhage as compared to the CC053/Unc haplotype (NOD/ShiLtJ centromere\u201322.3 Mb; 129s1/SvImJ 22.3\u201332.2 Mb; CAST/EiJ 32.2\u201364.4 Mb).\n\nGiven these haplotypic differences, we compared the PWK and C57BL/6J genomes on chromosome 18 from 31.2\u201358.6 Mb, looking for missense mutations or insertions/deletions to narrow potential candidate genes beneath the QTL. While it is possible that a spontaneous mutation in either CC003/Unc or CC053/Unc is the cause of Hrs5, we considered this to be the less likely scenario, and focused our initial bioinformatics analysis based on genotyping of the CC founder lines. Using the publically available Sanger sequences (Oreper et al. 2017), we identified 743 missense mutations but no insertions or deletions in the consensus region encompassing 158 coding genes (Table S3). Further examination revealed that four of the missense mutations were located within Ticam2, formerly known as TRAM\u2014a TLR adapter protein. Previous work by our group identified critical roles for the TLR pathways and adaptors in modulating SARS-CoV disease (Sheahan et al. 2008; Totura et al. 2015), and led us to further pursue the role of Ticam2 in contributing to SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Although knockout mice do not test the effect of allelic variation in candidate genes, they can confirm the overall importance of a given gene in phenotypes of interest. In this case, Ticam2-deficient mice (Ticam2\u2212/\u2212) had greater SARS-CoV induced weight loss than C57BL/6J control mice (Figure 6A and raw data in Table S2) [and as previously described (Totura et al. 2015)]. While Ticam2\u2212/\u2212 mice had similar virus titers to C57BL/6J control mice at day 4 postinfection [(Totura et al. 2015) and further confirmed in data not shown], their virus load is significantly higher at day 2 postinfection (Totura et al. 2015). We further examined Ticam2\u2212/\u2212 mice for the additional phenotypes that mapped to the same region of chromosome 18. Initially focusing on vascular cuffing, Ticam2\u2212/\u2212 mice showed no notable increase in scoring relative to wild-type control mice despite their increased weight loss (Figure 6B). In contrast, pulmonary hemorrhage scores were significantly higher in Ticam2\u2212/\u2212 mice at 4 d postinfection (Figure 6C). Overall, these data demonstrate an important role for Ticam2 in SARS-CoV pathogenesis, although additional loci contribute to variation in disease severity.\n\nGenetic reference panels, especially those MPPs with multiple founder strains, have increasingly been seen as a rich tool for understanding mammalian disease states and biomedically important traits in the context of naturally occurring genetic variation (Nedelko et al. 2012; Rasmussen et al. 2014; Rogala et al. 2014). In contrast to previous genetic mapping studies using the entire CC population (Ferris et al. 2013; Gralinski et al. 2015), we focused on two strains exhibiting extreme responses to SARS-CoV infection, predicting that they would have multiple QTL driving these extreme responses. Further, we hypothesized that each of those QTL would contrast alleles from unique pairs of founder haplotypes (as these susceptibility responses are outside the range of responses seen in other inbred strains). Our study found five QTL impacting SARS-CoV disease responses in this cross. Although each locus in an F2 cross can only contrast two haplotypes; across these five loci were components of seven of the eight CC founder strains, with most contrasting alleles being between classical laboratory haplotypes vs. one of the wild-derived inbred founder haplotypes. Our approach highlights the utility in combining novel genetic reference populations with classical F2 crosses in order to more fully probe the complex genetic architecture of disease responses.\n\nOur results also demonstrate the importance of Ticam2 in control of multiple aspects of SARS-CoV pathogenesis such as weight loss, viral titer, and pulmonary hemorrhage (Figure 6, (Totura et al. 2015)). While we did not observe any changes in vascular cuffing in Ticam2\u2212/\u2212 mice relative to C57BL/6J controls, this is likely due to the complexity of confirming functional allelic variation in a knockout mouse model. Ticam2\u2014a TLR sorting adapter protein\u2014recruits the signaling adapter protein TRIF to mediate TLR4 signaling (Fitzgerald et al. 2003; Oshiumi et al. 2003). While the ligand that activates TLR4 signaling following SARS-CoV infection has not yet been identified, our group has recently shown that TLR4 deficient mice are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection (Totura et al. 2015). Other laboratories have demonstrated the importance of TLRs in the host immune response to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (Cao et al. 2015) and mouse hepatitis virus (Mazaleuskaya et al. 2012), supporting a general requirement for TLR signaling in an effective immune response to coronavirus infection. TLR4 is classically known as the LPS receptor (Poltorak et al. 1998), but it can also recognize host proteins that have altered expression under conditions of cell stress, such as heat shock proteins and proteins involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM) like fibrinogen, heparin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid (Okamura et al. 2001; Smiley et al. 2001; Cohen-Sfady et al. 2005; Akbarshahi et al. 2011). Additionally, Wang and Liu recently demonstrated that the SARS-CoV membrane protein stimulates interferon induction in a TRAF3-independent manner, using an as yet unknown TLR (Wang and Liu 2016). We have previously shown that extensive ECM remodeling occurs following SARS-CoV infection (Gralinski et al. 2013), and we speculate that either ECM changes, or sensing of the SARS-CoV membrane protein, are likely drivers of TLR4 activation.\n\nMutations in various TLRs and adapter proteins can have significant impacts on immunity and susceptibility to infectious diseases. Ticam2 is required for vesicular stomatitis virus induced TLR4-dependent signaling (Georgel et al. 2007). Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Ticam2 were recently shown to be associated with Tuberculosis susceptibility, and one SNP was associated with resistance (Hall et al. 2015). While nonsynonymous mutations in TLRs are rare in human populations [for example, most mutations in the extracellular domain of TLR4 are found in <1% of population (Smirnova et al. 2001)], when observed, they can have a profound effect on the host response to infection. For example, the relatively common Asp299Gly mutation in TLR4 has been shown to interfere with recruitment of MyD88 and TRIF to TLR4, and thus diminish downstream NF-kB- and IRF3-mediated signaling (Figueroa et al. 2012); individuals with this mutation are more prone to septic shock (Lorenz et al. 2002) as well as Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis (Cheng et al. 2015). It was recently shown that the F protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) binds to, and activates, TLR4 (Rallabhandi et al. 2012), and increased RSV disease severity is associated with the Asp299Gly TLR haplotype (Caballero et al. 2015).\n\nTicam2 facilitates the binding of TLR4 and TRIF through the interaction of the TIR domains of the three proteins (Enokizono et al. 2013). There are four missense mutations between the C57BL/6J and PWK Ticam2 sequences; however, because the mutations all occur before the TIR domain, they are unlikely to interfere with Ticam2 binding to either TLR4 or TRIF. The amino-terminal domain of Ticam2 is less well studied, but is known to contain both myristoylation and phosphorylation sites that are essential for Ticam2 to locate to the plasma and endosomal membranes (Rowe et al. 2006; Kagan et al. 2008). The four Ticam2 missense mutations between PWK and C57BL/6J are predicted to cause two changes in charge, remove a serine residue, and change a cysteine residue to a serine (S39 is conserved in mammalian species). Those mutations may alter the structure of the Ticam2 amino-terminal domain, impact its membrane localization function, or modify the ability of Ticam2 to properly shuttle TLR4 to the endosome following activation (Kagan et al. 2008). Finally, the Ticam2 locus is genetically complex, encoding overlapping negative regulators that could be impacted by these mutations (Doyle et al. 2012). Thus, there are multiple mechanisms by which allelic differences in Ticam2 could result in functional consequences in TLR4-mediated signaling and immunity. Importantly, while our knockout mouse data confirms the role of Ticam2 in helping to control SARS-CoV mediated disease, it does not prove that allelic variation in Ticam2 is the cause of the HrS5 phenotypes. Continued work is needed to address the possible role of other candidate genes in the HrS5 interval, and to assess what, if any, functional changes exist between the C57BL/6J and PWK Ticam2 alleles.\n\nIn conclusion, we utilized two strains of the CC showing extreme SARS-CoV responses to identify five host genetic loci driving different aspects of these disease responses. By their design, each CC strain contains haplotype blocks coming from evolutionarily diverse Mus musculus substrains. The random sorting of haplotypes that do not share evolutionary history can give rise to extreme phenotypic responses within a strain (Rasmussen et al. 2014; Rogala et al. 2014; Graham et al. 2016) when interacting members of pathways are forced to work with evolutionarily distinct partners. Diverse subspecific alleles were present across the five loci within each of the CC lines, strongly suggesting that the extreme SARS-CoV responses we based our F2 cross on are due, in part, to interactions between alleles from diverse sets of CC founders. Reinforcing the idea that there might be many strain-specific interactions that can drive much of the observed variation in GRPs, in this cross we found evidence for epistatic relationships across three loci in controlling viral load (Figure 4B).\n\nImportantly, we identified a QTL that contributes to multiple SARS-CoV phenotypes, and whole genome sequence analysis pointed to altered function of the innate-immune modulatory gene Ticam2 as a strong candidate. Ticam2\u2212/\u2212 mice were used to confirm the role of that gene in contributing to SARS-CoV-induced weight loss and pulmonary hemorrhage, although not vascular cuffing. Knockout mice cannot address the issue of allelic variation, and thus there is a possibility that Ticam2\u2212/\u2212 mice phenocopy Hrs5, and another gene or genes are responsible for the SARS-CoV phenotypes that map to chromosome 18. Use of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing approaches to swap alleles, rather than ablate genes, and directly testing specific causal mutations in extreme CC strains will be a more relevant way to confirm genetic function in the future. Regardless, this data, along with previously published work (Sheahan et al. 2008; Totura et al. 2015), combines to demonstrate that TLR recognition of SARS-CoV infection is a crucial part of the host immune response to infection. Because allelic variation in Tlr4 in humans is frequently associated with increased disease susceptibility, modulating its signaling through use of agonists or antagonists could allow for effective treatment of a number of disease states. Testing drug efficacy in a genetically variable population, including variation in the pathways of interest, is not possible using conventional knockout mice. The genetic variation present in the CC, particularly when it is known to impact functional outcomes such as SARS-CoV susceptibility, would be a particularly rigorous and effective test of proposed human therapeutics that modulate TLR signaling."}
