{"title": "Baculovirus surface-displayed hemagglutinin of H5N1 influenza virus sustains its authentic cleavage, hemagglutination activity, and antigenicity", "body": "In contrast to other commonly used viral vectors, infection of mammalian cells with baculovirus did not result in a visible cytopathic effect (CPE) due to its non-replication nature in these cells. The baculovirus vector was also shown to be capable of carrying large size inserts or multiple gene expression cassettes. Baculovirus, carrying target genes under the control of an appropriate mammalian cell-active promoter, has provided an alternative and attractive choice for gene delivery due to its safety and improved efficacy through genetic engineering [1] . Baculovirus pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) emerges as a promising gene-delivery vector due to its efficiency in transducing numerous mammalian cells and resistance to inactivation by animal sera [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In documented efforts to probe the potential of bac-ulovirus as immunizing reagent, the tested antigen genes were all under the control of mammalian promoters that were not active in insect cells, and the immunogen would only be produced after in vivo transduction [8] [9] [10] [11] . A baculovirus, which harbors the antigenic peptide as a structural protein and sustains the ability to express its gene through in vivo transduction, will present an alternative, if not better, choice for vaccination purpose, since it can trigger immediate immune response upon injection.\n\nWe have reported that shrimp white spot syndrome virus ie1 promoter was active in both insect and shrimp cells in the context of a baculovirus vector [12, 13] . In the present study, we identified that White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) ie1 promoter is active in both invertebrate and vertebrate cells in the context of a baculovirus vector. Furthermore, we were trying to determine whether hemagglutinin (HA) of H5N1 influenza virus, one of the two major membrane glycoproteins and responsible for the production of major neutralization antibody [14, 15] , could be efficiently displayed on baculovirus vector. \n\nCells. Representative vertebrate cell lines (Df-1 and MDCK) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (pH 7.4). Cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . Insect SF9 cells were maintained and propagated in SF-900II serum-free medium at 27\u00b0C.\n\nVirus infection, titration, and transduction. Infection of Sf9 cells with baculovirus, and titration of baculovirus were performed as previously described [16] . Transduction of tested cell lines was carried out according to an optimized protocol [17, 18] . Influenza virus was amplified from eggs as previously described [19] .\n\nConstructs. For the generation of the recombinant baculovirus vector, vAc-HA and vAc-G-HA, AcMNPV polyhedrin promoter-controlled VSV G expression cassette and WSSV ie1 promoter-controlled HA expression cassette was inserted into the shuttle vector pFastBac1 and integrated into the baculovirus genome within DH10BAC\u00e4 through site-specific transposition according to the protocol of Bac-To-Bac system (Invitrogen). VSV G cDNA with b-globin terminator was PCR amplified from pVSV-G (Clontech) with a primer set of 5 0 -CGCGGATCCATGAAGTGCCTT TTGTACTTAGC-3 0 and 5 0 -CCCAAGCTTCCAACACACTATTGCAA TGAA-3 0 . VSV G cDNA was placed downstream of the polyhedrin promoter, which was PCR amplified from bacmid genome with a primer set of 5 0 -TCCCCCGGGGGATGGTTGGCTACGTATACTCCG-3 0 and 5 0 -CGCGGATCCGGTT TCGGACCGAGATCCGC-3 0 . The HA cDNA was amplified from genome of H5N1 virus (A/Goose/Guangdong/3/97/ H5N1) through RT-PCR with a primer set of 5 0 -ATAAGAATGCG GCCGCTATGGAGAAAACAGTGCTTCTTCTTG-3 0 and 5 0 -CCGCT CGAGCGGTTAAATGCAAATTCTGCATTGTAACGATC-3 0 .\n\nHA cDNA was then placed upstream of the SV40 terminator in pFastBac1 vector and downstream of ie1 promoter, which was amplified from WSSV genome with a primer set of 5 0 -TCCCTACGTATCAATTTTATG TGGCTAATGGAGA-3 0 and 5 0 -ACGCGTCGACCTTGAGTGGAGA GAGAGCTAGTTATAA-3 0 . The original polyhedrin promoter sequence in pFastBac1 was deleted with SnaBI and SalI digestion before insertion of the two expression cassettes (Fig. 1A) .\n\nWestern blot analysis. Gel preparation, running, transferring proteins from SDS-PAGE gels to nitrocellulose filters, and immunoblotting were performed according to standard protocols. Quantified protein samples or Sf9 cellular extract of about 1 \u00b7 10 6 cells were subjected to 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in this study. \n\nIFA test. MDCK and Df-1 cells grown in 24-well plates were transduced with baculovirus, vAc-G-HA, at a MOI of 100. 16 h after transduction, the cells were fixed to the plate with 100% ethanol for 30 min at room temperature. Then the fixed cells were incubated with home-made monoclonal HA1 antibody at 1:20 dilution for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin (DAKO, Denmark), at a dilution of 1:25, was subsequently incubated with the fixed cells for 1 h as detector antibody. The fluorescence signal was detected with an inverted fluorescence microscopy (Olympus) and the images were captured by a digital imaging system (Nikon).\n\nSerological testing. Hemagglutination assay was performed with 0.5% chicken erythrocytes (RBCs) according to the protocol reported by Wood et al. [21] . Hemagglutination titer was determined as the highest serum dilution giving complete red cells agglutination. Neutralization assay was performed according to a standard method [22] .\n\nWhite spot syndrome virus (WSSV) ie1 promoter, in the context of a baculovirus vector, has shown strong activity in many cell lines (Liu et al., 2005; ; unpublished data). To explore the potential of baculovirus-based vaccine against H5N1 virus, we constructed a recombinant baculovirus containing a HA-expression cassette under the control of WSSV ie1 promoter, named as vAc-HA (Fig. 1A) . Based on this virus, we also constructed a HA-expression baculovirus vector containing one VSV G-expression cassette under the control of baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, named as vAc-G-HA (Fig. 1A) . For the generation of the recombinant baculovirus vectors, AcMNPV polyhedrin promoter-controlled VSV G expression cassette or WSSV ie1 promoter-controlled HA expression cassette were inserted into the shuttle vector pFastBac1 and integrated into the baculovirus genome within DH10BAC\u00e4 according to the protocol of Bac-To-Bac system (Invitrogen). HA cDNA was then placed upstream of the SV40 terminator in pFastBac1 vector and downstream of WSSV ie1 promoter. A control virus, vAc-Bacmid, was constructed by integrating empty pFastBac1 vector into bacmid genome (Fig. 1A) .\n\nInfection of insect Sf9 cells with vAc-G-HA resulted in extensive cell-cell fusion (Fig. 1B) . The phenotype was due to the very high expression level of VSV G protein with membrane-fusion activity by polyhedrin promoter [18] . We also examined the kinetics of virion production in Sf9 cells through generating a one-step growth curve of infectious virus production (Fig. 1C) . The temporal kinetics of the growth curves [16] of these viruses were similar, although peak virion production of vAc-G-HA lagged behind those of vAc-HA and control vAc-Bacmid. Titer of vAc-G-HA increased to 10 9 PFU (plaque forming unit)/ml at 120 h p.i., while vAc-HA and vAc-Bacmid generated the same titer at 96 h p.i. (Fig. 1C) . The extensive syncytium formation of Sf9 cells infected with vAc-G-HA might delay the release of virions in the late infection.\n\nWe next purified vAc-HA, vAc-G-HA or vAc-Bacmid from the supernatant of infected insect cells by ultracentrifugation. To investigate whether HA was displayed on the membrane of vAc-HA and vAc-G-HA, the purified virions were treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min to disrupt the viral membrane structure, and then viral nucleocapsids were collected through ultracentrifugation.\n\nPolyclonal antibody against HA protein was raised in Guinea pigs using His 6 -tagged HA1 as antigen [19] . Western blot analysis with the anti-HA1 serum showed that HA was detected in the purified virions before treatment with Triton X-100, and not detected in the collected pellet comprised of only viral nucleocapsids ( Fig. 2A) . Interestingly, we found that the HA was partially cleaved to HA1 and HA2 in both the infected SF9 cells and the purified vAc-G-HA particles, which was similar to that of the purified H5N1 virions (Fig. 2A) . These data suggested that baculovirus vector could display HA-like viral glycoproteins, with similar post-translational modification to their natural products. Western blot assay using anti-VSV G monoclonal antibody also indicate that, as expected, VSV G was membrane associated structural component in purified vAc-G-HA virions (Fig. 2B) . To determine whether the baculovirus surface-displayed HA protein sustained authentic biological property, we tested the hemagglutination activity of purified virions of vAc-HA and vAc-G-HA (Fig. 2C) . Every 25 ll of vAc-HA or vAc-G-HA at a titer of 10 10 PFU/ml gave a hemagglutination titer of around 2 8 in the standard hemagglutination assay [21] . Our results indicated that co-display of VSV G with HA would not significantly reduce the displaying efficiency of HA on baculovirus membrane.\n\nTo test the ability of ie1 promoter to express HA gene in non-insect cell lines transduced with baculovirus, transduction assay [17] was performed with vAc-G-HA in two typical cell lines available here: canine MDCK and chicken Df-1 cells. Fig. 2D showed that vAc-G-HA efficiently transduced the tested cell lines as indicated by the positive fluorescent cells. The expression was further confirmed by Western blot analysis of the total cellular extract with anti-HA1 serum as shown in Fig. 2E . Transduction of these cells with vAc-HA also resulted in the expression of HA but with less efficiency (data not shown).\n\nThe immunogenicity of vAc-G-HA and vAc-HA was then subsequently investigated through intra-muscularly immunization of 7 week BALB/c mice (five mice each group) with purified virions. The inactivated H5N1/PR8 vaccine strain (provided by CDC, United States) amplified from MDCK cells was used as positive control; while vAc-Bacmid vaccinated mice served as negative control. At 4 weeks after intramuscular vaccination with 256 HA unit of purified baculovirus particles or inactivated H5N1/PR8 virus, the mice were boosted with same amount of virions. One week later, the mice were bled through retro-orbital plexus, and the pooled serum from each group of 5 mice was tested individually for antibodies against HA by ELISA [20] and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays [21] . ELISA test was set up to monitor the HA-specific antibody level by coating 96-well microplates with 60 ng purified His 6 -tagged HA1 protein per\n\nwell. As shown in Fig. 3A , mice immunized with vAc-HA or vAc-G-HA developed significant antibody response as detected by ELISA in which purified HA1 protein was coated as antigen; while the mice immunized with vAc-Bacmid displayed only background sera titer. Both vAc-G-HA and vAc-HA induced serum HI antibody responses in the immunized mice, with a titer of 2 6 (Fig. 3B) . The HI titers of baculovirus vectors were comparable to those mice vaccinated with the vaccine strain H5N1/PR8 that has an average titer of 2 8 (Fig. 3B) . The vaccine strain demonstrated a similar HI titer as the H5 influenza virus that was reported by Takada et al. [15] . In the ELISA test, antibody response induced by vAc-G-HA was around 18% higher than that of vAc-HA, which is in consistence with other reports that VSV G-containing baculovirus might have advantage in transducing foreign gene in vivo. Surprisingly, the H5N1/PR8 vaccine strain induced higher level of antibody response as shown by the ELISA; accordingly the induced anti-sera demonstrated four fold of HI activity higher than the HA-displaying baculoviruses ( Fig. 3A and B). The specific and significant antibody response from the baculovirus-vaccinated mice indicated that, the HA molecule displayed on the viral surface or expressed through viral transduction sustained its authentic antigenicity, although the baculovirus might be less immunogenic than the influenza virus as suggested in our test. \n\nFurthermore, we test the in vitro neutralization ability of the induced antibody by the HA-displaying baculoviruses. A standard microneutralization test based on the H5N1/ PR8 and MDCK cell system was performed in our study as reported previously [22] . The sera induced by both HA-displaying baculoviruses showed a significant neutrlization titer of 80; while the H5N1/PR8 induced serum gave an expected higher titer of 160 (Fig. 3B) .\n\nIn summary, our data suggested an alternative choice in applying baculovirus as immunizing reagent against influenza virus through synergistic surface-display and gene transduction of HA protein. Considering the safety and cost-effective to produce high-titer recombinant baculovirus, our HA-displaying baculoviruses had their value as vaccine against influenza especially for mammalians. To further validate this, we are planning to do animal protection test in the future. In addition to its applications as vaccination vector, the straightforward membrane-display system could also be further exploited to characterize the structure and function of a wide variety of viral membrane glycoproteins. samples from each group was tested by ELISA with purified HA1 protein coated as capture antigen. Results are expressed as the mean absorbance of 1:10 diluted sera. (B) HI assay and neutralization assay for the pooled serum samples from immunized mice. The HI titer is expressed as the endpoint in a twofold dilution of sera. In the neutralization assay, the twofold serial dilutions from 10 to 640 were mixed with an equal volume of virus diluent containing influenza virus at 2 \u00b7 10 3 TCID 50 /ml. The presence of viral protein was monitored by IFA test with the polyclonal anti-HA1 antibody. The neutralization titer is expressed as the endpoint in the serial dilution."}
