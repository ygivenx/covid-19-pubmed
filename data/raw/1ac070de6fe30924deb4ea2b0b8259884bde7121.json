{"title": "Relationship Between Clinical Features and Computed Tomographic Findings in Hospitalized Adult Patients With Community-Acquired Pneumonia", "body": "C ommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite the use of an antibiotic armamentarium and the availability of vaccines. 1 Therefore, early diagnosis and appropriate antimicrobial treatment are critical steps in the management of CAP. Chest radiography is usually used in combination with a constellation of compatible symptoms or signs, such as cough and sputum production to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia. 2, 3 Computed tomography (CT) is useful when the plain chest radiograph does not reveal findings that explain the patient's clinical presentation. 4 CT images can provide more detailed information regarding lung parenchyma, 1 suggest specific causative agents, 5 rule out noninfectious pneumonia 5 and detect other underlying conditions. 4 Thus, CT provides additional benefits for the diagnosis of CAP and aids its typing. 2 In particular, when performed early, CT can affect the diagnosis and clinical management of CAP in the emergency department. 4 Accordingly, the use of CT in patients with suspected CAP can be expected to increase in real world practice.\n\nA variety of microbial agents, including typical and atypical pathogens, can cause CAP. A considerable number of studies on the CT findings of CAP triggered by different pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, [6] [7] [8] Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9, 10 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, [11] [12] [13] [14] Chlamydia pneumoniae 14, 15 and Legionella pneumophila, 16, 17 have been published. Patients with CAP attributed to a specific pathogen present with more than 1 CT pattern, although 1 of these patterns predominates. 5 CAP has been classically divided into 3 patterns based on CT findings, that is, consolidation-predominant, peribronchial nodules-predominant and ground-glass opacity (GGO)-predominant. 5 However, data on relationships between the clinical and microbiologic features of CAP and CT findings are scarce. In CAP, pure or nearly pure GGO lesions are uncommon regardless of causative pathogens, 16, 18 and a CT finding multiple centrilobular nodules is also rare. 19 We hypothesized that the clinical manifestations of patients with CAP are related to CT findings, and thus, we compared the clinical features and microbiologic data of CAP patients classified based on CT findings.\n\nWe retrospectively enrolled consecutive patients with CAP admitted to and treated at the Respiratory Department of Kyungpook National University Hospital (KNUH), a tertiary referral center, in Daegu, South Korea between January 2011 and December 2016. 20 Baseline patient characteristics were recorded at admission, although not all patients underwent the same laboratory tests. Pneumonia was diagnosed using the following criteria: (1) a new radiographic infiltrate, (2) 1 or more symptoms or signs consistent with pneumonia (cough, sputum, dyspnea, fever or pleuritic chest pain) and (3) the exclusion of other causes. 21 Patients with hospitalacquired pneumonia, 22 healthcare-associated pneumonia, 22 an active thoracic malignancy or taking immunosuppressants or steroids (415 mg/day of prednisone for 4 14 days) were excluded. Patients without an available chest CT scan at presentation were also excluded.\n\nThe CT findings of CAP were classified into 3 categories: bronchiolitis, GGO and consolidation. These 3 groups were compared in terms of clinical characteristics and microbiologic data. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of KNUH, which waived the requirement for written informed patient consent because of the retrospective nature of the study.\n\nTwo chest radiologists (J.K.L. and K.M.S.) reviewed the chest CT scans of patients with CAP and classified them into the 3 groups (Figure) . In the bronchiolitis group, chest CT indicated centrilobular nodules or tree-in-bud pattern in most lesions with no or minimal GGO or consolidation (Figure) . 23 In the GGO group, chest CT indicated focal or diffuse GGO with no or minimal centrilobular nodules, tree-in-bud pattern or consolidation. In the consolidation group, chest CT indicated consolidation with or without variable extents of the CT features of bronchiolitis or GGO.\n\nTwo chest physicians (H.S. and S.I.C.) reviewed medical records. Resident physicians initially recorded baseline data, which were confirmed by attending chest physicians. Demographic data included age, sex, smoking history and alcohol consumption. Heavy drinking was defined as the consumption of 7 or more drinks (460 g of alcohol) on 1 occasion for men, and 5 or more drinks (440 g of alcohol) on 1 occasion for women at least twice a week. We reviewed symptoms, vital signs, comorbidities, pneumonia severity indices, 24 CURB-65 scores, 25 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance statuses 26 and retrospectively calculated Charlson comorbidity indices. 27 Use of mechanical ventilation, corticosteroid treatment, vasopressor infusion and pleural drainage with percutaneous catheters or chest tubes were checked. Outcome variables included length of hospital stay, 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality and clinical success. Treatment success was defined as improvements in clinical symptoms or signs and radiologic findings. Laboratory data included complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver function testing, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, N-terminal of prohormone brain natriuretic peptide, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, lactate dehydrogenase, lactate and arterial blood gas analysis.\n\nThe criteria for a causative pathogen were as follows 21 : a microorganism isolated from blood or pleural fluid; positive urinary antigen test for S. pneumoniae or L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (BinaxNOW S. pneumoniae and Legionella urinary antigen cards, Alere, Scarborough, ME); a culture of bacteria from a sputum sample (425 neutrophils and o10 squamous epithelial cells per low-power field) collected within 24 hours of admission plus a compatible Gram-stain finding; identification of M. pneumoniae based on a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) result or a 4-fold increase in immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in convalescent versus initial blood samples by chemiluminescence immunoassay (LIAISON, Dia-Sorin, Saluggia, Italy) or positivity for M. pneumoniae in a sputum by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (AmpliSens Mycoplasma pneumoniae-FEP PCR, Central Research Institute for Epidemiology, Moscow, Russia); the presence of C. pneumoniae as determined by a positive IgM or a 4-fold increase in IgG levels by microimmunofluorescence (an in-house method) or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Diesse Diagnostica Senese, Monteriggioni, Italy); positivity for a respiratory virus ( or enterovirus) in a throat or nasopharyngeal swab as determined by multiplex PCR (Anyplex RV16 detection, Seegene, Seoul, Korea) and the identification of influenza A or B antigen in a throat swab by rapid chromatographic immunoassay (SD BIOLINE Influenza Antigen test, Standard Diagnostics, Yongin, Korea or BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of FluA\u00feB, BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD).\n\nData were expressed as medians (interquartile ranges) for continuous variables or as numbers and percentages for categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and Dunn's test was used as a post-hoc test. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test among groups and Bonferroni's correction was used as a post-hoc follow-up test. The kappa statistic was used to measure interinterpreter agreement regarding CT findings. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used for the statistical analysis. P o 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nInitially, 1,708 patients with CAP were identified. Of these, 12 patients without available CT scans and 31 patients with no identifiable parenchymal lesion due to parapneumonic effusion were excluded. Consequently, 1,665 patients were included in the study. For patients admitted between 2015 and 2016 (n \u00bc 531), 2 radiologists (K.M.S. and J.K.L.) independently reviewed the CT findings and classified them as consolidation, bronchiolitis or GGO by consensus (the kappa statistic was 0.943). For the remaining patients, 1 of the 2 radiologists determined CT findings. Of the 1,665 patients, 40 (2.4%) were included in the bronchiolitis group, 46 (2.8%) in the GGO group and 1,579 (94.8%) in the consolidation group. Clinical and microbiologic variables of these 3 groups were compared.\n\nClinical parameters are presented in Table 1 . The percentage of patients with cough differed significantly among the groups, and the percentage was significantly greater in the bronchiolitis group than in the consolidation group (40 [100.0%] versus 1,368 [86.6%], P \u00bc 0.013). The frequency of chest pain significantly \n\nBlood levels of CRP, procalcitonin, albumin, total protein and sodium were significantly different in the 3 groups (Table 2 ). CRP (9.3 mg/dL [3.7-14.0 mg/dL] versus 12.9 mg/dL [6.6-21.0 mg/dL], P \u00bc 0.009) and procalcitonin (0.11 ng/mL [0.06-0.42 ng/mL] versus 0.35 ng/ mL [0.10-1.79 ng/mL], P \u00bc 0.006) were significantly lower in the bronchiolitis group than in the consolidation group, and the bronchiolitis group had significantly higher blood levels of albumin (3.5 g/dL [3.4-4.0 g/dL] versus 3.3 g/dL [2.9-3.8 g/dL], P \u00bc 0.004) and total protein (6.8 g/dL [6.4-7.4 g/dL] versus 6.4 g/dL [5.9-6.9 g/dL], P o 0.001) than the consolidation group.\n\nMicrobiologic data are summarized in Table 3 . Eight hundred and fifty-nine potential pathogens were identified in 715 patients (42.9%): 800 pathogens in 670 patients (42.4%) of the consolidation group, 37 \n\nInitially used antibiotics are summarized and compared between the groups in Table 4 . Third-generation cephalosporin-or ampicillin-sulbactam-based regimen was most commonly used in each group. There were no significant differences in antibiotic regimens between the groups, except fluoroquinolone with or without aminoglycoside. The higher frequency of fluoroquinolone with or without aminoglycoside in the bronchiolitis group was not statistically significant in post-hoc analysis, as compared with the consolidation group (Bonferroni's corrected P \u00bc 0.042).\n\nThis study confirms that predominantly bronchiolitis or GGO pattern on CT images is uncommon in patients with CAP. In the bronchiolitis group, the most common pathogen was M. pneumoniae, followed by S. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae was significantly more common than in the consolidation group. As compared with the consolidation group, the bronchiolitis group was characterized by a higher percentage of cough, lower rates of chest pain and pleural effusion and the absence of complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema and pleural drainage. Furthermore, the bronchiolitis group was associated with lower blood levels of inflammatory markers and higher albumin and total protein levels in blood. The common causative pathogens in the GGO group were M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae and these were not significantly different from those observed in the other 2 groups. As observed for the bronchiolitis group, complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema was not observed and no patient underwent pleural drainage in the GGO group. Outcome variables, such as 30-day mortality, were not significantly different among the 3 groups.\n\nCentrilobular nodules on CT correspond pathologically to cellular infiltration in bronchioles with exudates or granulation tissue in bronchiolar lumens, whereas consolidation reflects neutrophils and exudates in alveolar lumen. 28 A previous study showed the microbiological features of CAP patients with a tree-inbud pattern share similarities with those of pneumonia in the general population. 29 In another study, M. pneumoniae infection was frequently associated with a bronchiolitis pattern. 30 M. pneumoniae has an affinity for airway cilia and bronchioles and causes peribronchial and perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells and edematous and ulcerative lesions in bronchial walls. 28 In the present study, more than 40% of cases in the bronchiolitis group were caused by M. pneumoniae, which concurs with the findings of a previous study, in which M. pneumoniae was determined to be the most common pathogen of diffuse acute infectious bronchiolitis in adults. 19 Interestingly, common CAP pathogens, such as C. pneumoniae, S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae, also cause a bronchiolitis pattern. The mechanisms responsible for centrilobular nodules or tree-in-bud pattern in some patients and consolidation or GGO in others can be explained by the up-or down-regulations of host cell-mediated immunity, respectively. 28 In a previous study, the rate of diffuse bronchiolitis was reported to be 1.2% among community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. 19 The difference between this rate and the value found in the present study for the bronchiolitis pattern is explained by the different definitions used. In the present study, bronchiolitis was defined as either the presence of centrilobular nodules or a tree-in-bud pattern in most lesions with or without GGO or consolidation in the present study, whereas, in the previous study, diffuse acute infectious bronchiolitis was defined as multiple centrilobular nodules in 4 or more lobes. 19 However, no previous study has addressed the clinical manifestations of the bronchiolitis or bronchiolitis-predominant CAP. As expected based on published findings, 19,30 our bronchiolitis group exhibited a clinically less severe form of CAP characterized by lower levels of inflammatory markers and the absence of complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema.
