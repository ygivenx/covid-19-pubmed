{"title": "Association between Severity of MERS- CoV Infection and Incubation Period Technical Appendix 2 Additional Details of Statistical Methods", "body": "events cannot be directly observed. If patient i reported that infection most likely occurred in a period of exposure between times Li and Ui, where Li \u2264 Xi \u2264 Ui, the incubation time therefore is bounded by the interval (Z -Ui, Z -Li). These data are a special type of survival data, and a convenient approach would be to reverse the time axis setting Z as the origin and X as the outcome time. Reversing the time axis is valid only when the density function for infection is uniform in chronologic time. This condition should be reasonable in the setting of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, with each exposure interval being relatively short.\n\nTo evaluate the incubation period distribution, we compared the goodness of fit of different parametric models (gamma, lognormal, Weibull, and exponential distributions) usually used to describe the incubation period distribution of infectious diseases. We found that the gamma distribution had the best Bayesian Index Criterion value. We assumed consequently a gamma distribution with parameters (k, \u03b8) and probability density function\n\nWe assumed that the incubation period distribution had different parameters among the nonfatal cases and the fatal cases, and we consequently estimated 2 different parameters (k, \u03b8) of the gamma distribution using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We compared the mean incubation period between these 2 groups by using the 10,000 posterior samples of each couple of parameters (k, \u03b8). We then considered 2 approaches to estimate the association between the risk for death (outcome) and the incubation period (explanatory variable).\n\nWe evaluated the potential association between the length of the incubation period and the age and sex of patients in both subgroups (fatal and nonfatal cases) by using a multiple linear regression approach within a Bayesian framework, and we did not find a significant association (Table 3) .\n\nLet f and F be the pdf and cdf of the incubation period, assumed to be gamma distributed with parameters k and \u03b8 and stratified by clinical outcome (fatal and nonfatal cases). Let P be the probability of death, which we assume to be dependent on age (g), sex (s) and incubation period (x) as in logistic regression:\n\nDepending if the case i had an exact exposure date (A1) or an interval of exposure (A2), we defined the probability of death qi. If case i is in A1, then the probability of death is simply qi = P (gi, si, xi) . If case i is in A2, then the probability of death is\n\nwhere [ , ] is the range of incubation period for case i and where (ki, \u03b8i) is the couple of parameters of the gamma distribution depending if the case i belongs to the fatal or nonfatal cases group.\n\nWe estimated = ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , , , , ) simultaneously using MCMC and the following likelihood:\n\nwhere di = 1 if case i died from the disease and 0 otherwise; (kfc, \u03b8fc) and (knfc, \u03b8nfc) are the 2 parameters of the gamma distribution for the fatal and the nonfatal cases, respectively.\n\nWe also defined a logistic regression model by using incubation times resampled from the 10,000 posterior samples. This approach enabled us to simulate the distribution with imputed values for individual incubation periods, which was particularly useful for an analysis in which we stratified incubation periods into tertiles. In general, the likelihood based approach might be preferred to this simulation approach, and we presented the simulation approach results as sensitivity analyses.\n\nIn this approach, the probability of death was similarly defined as in equation (1) and for each patient with interval-censored exposure data, we estimated 10,000 posterior samples for the incubation time by using MCMC, and we used the same likelihood as defined in equation (2), but\n\nwhere qi = P(gi, si, xi) for all cases, using the resampled incubation time for patients with intervalcensored data.\n\nWe used a Bayesian framework to estimate the different parameters of the logistic regression. In this framework, if represents a vector of parameters and the data, and Bayes theorem gives us the following relationship: \u2020Coefficients exp(\u03b2) of the logistic regression were estimated by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (10,000 runs) with incubation period as outcome variable and age and sex as predictors. Moreover, 10,000 samples from posterior distributions of incubation periods T for each patient estimated were used in the logistic regression model. \u202110,000 samples of the incubation periods T for each patient were drawn by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. \u00a7Tertiles were 5.1 and 8.0 days for all patients and 5.2 and 8.1 days for patients with exact exposure dates, respectively."}
