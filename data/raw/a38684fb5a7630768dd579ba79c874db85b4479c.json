{"title": "Mini-review Synthetic approaches, structure activity relationship and biological applications for pharmacologically attractive pyrazole/ pyrazolineethiazolidine-based hybrids", "body": "Pharmacophore hybrid approach is a current concept in drug design and development to produce molecules with improved affinity and efficacy. There are some reviews dealing with the concept of molecular hybridization and the promises/challenges associated with these hybrid molecules along with recent advances on anticancer hybrids [1e3] . Various heteroaryl based hybrids in particular isatin and coumarins [3] or indoline-thiazolidinones [4] have been recently reviewed as conjugates with remarkable inhibitory potential.\n\nDesign of new drug-like small molecules based on the pharmacologically attractive scaffolds of thiazolidine (4-thiazolidinone) [5e10] and pyrazole or pyrazoline [11e15] is a reasonable and promising direction in modern medicinal chemistry. The chemical approaches for the synthesis of thiazolidinone-and pyrazole-based derivatives and their pharmacological activity were described in a numerous reviews [5e12] . However, the pyrazole/pyrazolineethiazolidine-based conjugates as biologically active compounds are poorly reviewed in the context of pharmacophore hybrid approach.\n\nThe recent synthetic studies of pyrazoleethiazolidines and related hybrids and biological investigations for their antitumor, antimicrobial, antiviral, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory activities allowed to identify the promising drug-like compounds. Thus, the pyrazoleethiazolidinones/thiazoles have been patented as inhibitors of necroptosis [16] , VHR protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors [17] , Pin1-modulating compounds [18] , compounds for modulating RNA-binding proteins [19] and activators of proapoptotic BAX [20] . In addition, the pyrazoleethiazolidinone hybrids have been studied for their possibility to inhibit the TNF-aeTNFRc1 interaction [21] , as inhibitors of histone acetyltransferases [22] and inhibitors of COX [31, 39] and ADAMTS-5 enzymes [83] . Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize the data about the synthesis and biological activity of heterocyclic systems with thiazolidine and pyrazole/pyrazoline fragments in molecules. The most promising pyrazoleethiazolidinone/thiazole hybrids and target heterocycles that have been reviewed as fragments of hybrid molecules are depicted in Fig. 1 .\n\nThe reviewed hybrids were classified as 2-, 3-and 5-pyrazole/ pyrazoline-substituted thiazolidines based on linkage of target heterocyclic cores. The basic approaches for the synthesis of mentioned derivatives provide a combination of two \"small\" molecules in aminolysis reactions, acylation and Knoevenagel procedure or heterocyclization of monocyclic compounds via the [2\u00fe3]cyclization reaction yielding the series of non-condensed bicyclic systems.\n\nDetailed biological activity evaluation of pyrazolineethiazolidinone conjugates 1.2e1.7 and pyrazolineethiazoles 1.8, 1.9 (Fig. 2) , synthesized via the [2\u00fe3]cyclocondensation of 4,5-dihydropyrazole-1-carbothioamides 1.1 as S,N-binucleophiles in reactions with equivalents of dielectrophilic synthon [C2] 2\u00fe , allowed to identify compounds with antimicrobial [23e28], antiviral [29, 30] , anti-inflammatory [31] , antitumor [32e35] and insecticidal [36] activities. For synthesis of target derivatives a-halogenocarboxylic acids [31, 33] and their ethyl esters [23e29, 35, 36] , maleic anhydride [30] , maleimides [30, 38] , b-aroylacrylic acids [30] , dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate [37] , bromoacetophenones [23, 24, 28, 29, 35] and ethyl 4chloroacetoacetate [35] were used as equivalents of dielectrophilic synthon [C2] 2\u00fe .\n\nThree-component one-pot reaction that includes [2\u00fe3]cyclocondensation of 4,5-dihydropyrazole-1-carbotioamides 1.1 with chloroacetic acid and the further Knoevenagel reaction with aromatic aldehydes [33, 34] and isatin derivatives [32] is an effective approach for design of new anticancer agents among the pyrazolineethiazolidinones 1.10, 1.11 (Fig. 3) .\n\nThe reaction between pyrazolyl-imines [39, 40] or pyrazolylhydrazones [41] and thioglycolic acid or its esters is widely used approach for the synthesis of 4-thiazolidinone conjugates 1.12, 1. VHR protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor [17] n = 3: Pin1-modulator [18] n = 5: HAT-inhibitor [22] RNA binding proteins modulator [19] Pro-apoptotic BAX activator [20] TNF-a inhibitor [21] with pyrazole moiety in position 2. A. Khodairy proposed a synthesis of 2-substituted 4-thiazolidinone with benzopyrano [2,3-c] pyrazol-3-one fragment 1.14, using N-cyanoacetyl-benzopyranopyrazolone [42] as a starting compound (Fig. 4) .\n\nAnother direction for synthesis of pyrazole-substituted thiazoline 1.16 (Fig. 5) was realized by the creation of pyrazole moiety via the reaction between 5-fluoro-2-hydrazino-4-hydroxy-4,5bis(trifluoromethyl)-1,3-thiazoline 1.15 with acetoacetone [43, 44] .\n\nA broad group of pyrazoleethiazolidinone derivatives exemplified by 2-imino-4-thiazolidinones (pseudothiohydantoines) 1.18, 1.19 were synthesized via [2\u00fe3]-cyclocondensation of pyrazole substituted asymmetric bis-thioureas 1.17 as S,N-binucleophiles with some equivalents of dielectrophilic synthon [C2] 2\u00fe (ethyl 2chloroacetate [45, 46] , dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate [47] ). Simultaneously, bioisosteric pyrazolyl-2-iminothiazolidines 1.20 [46] were obtained by reaction of thioureas 1.17 with a-bromoacetophenones (Fig. 6 ).\n\nAiming to search for new anticancer or antimicrobial compounds among pyrazoleethiazolidinone conjugates the pyrazolesulfonyl-thioureas 1.21 were used as starting materials. The reaction between compounds 1.21 and ethyl 2-chloroacetate or abromoacetophenone resulted in formation of the corresponding pyrazoleethiazolidinones 1.22 and pyrazole-thiazolidines 1.23 with sulfonylimine linker group [48e53] (Fig. 7) .\n\nAnother approach for the synthesis of pyrazole derivatives of pseudothiohydantoin 1.26 was suggested by B. Insuasty et al. [54] . The synthesis of target compounds was carried out via aminolysis of 5-arylidene-2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinones (5-arylidenerhodanines) 1.24 by 4,5-diaminopyrazoles 1.25 (Fig. 8) .\n\nA row of 2-pyrazolyl-hydrazoneethiazolidinones 1.28e1.30 was synthesized via [2\u00fe3]-cyclocondensation of thiosemicarbazones 1.27 with a-halogenocarboxylic acids derivatives or maleic anhydride [55e60]. The pyrazole with bioisosteric 2-thiohydantoin 1.31 [61] and thiazolidine 1.32 [55e60] fragments were obtained by reaction of thiosemicarbazones 1.27 with chloroacetic acid in pyridine or a-bromoacetophenone. However, the reaction of thiosemicarbazones 1.27 with acetic anhydride or iron chloride was accompanied by the formation of pyrazoleethiadiazole derivatives 1.33, 1.34 [56] (Fig. 9 ).\n\nPyrazole-substituted thiosemicarbazides 1.35 were used for synthesis of the pyrazoleethiazolidinones 1.36 with carbohydrazide linker group [62, 63] . The three-component one-pot reaction between thiosemicarbazides 1.35, chloroacetic acid and aromatic aldehydes accompanied by formation of the corresponding 5-arylidene-4-thiazolidinones 1.37 [63, 64] . The modification of 1.35 in sulfuric acid medium gave pyrazoleethiadiazole 1.38 [64] . The reaction of compounds 1.35 with a-bromoacetophenones was accompanied by the formation of corresponding pyrazole-thiazolidine conjugates 1.39 [62e64] (Fig. 10 ).\n\nSynthesis of 2-diazole-substituted 4-thiazolidinones was achieved via the [2\u00fe3]-cyclocondensation of the pyrazole-based asymmetric thioureas 1.17 as S,N-binucleophiles (see Fig. 6 ). At the same time, the numerous papers represent the data about obtaining of 4-thiazolidinones with diazole moiety in 3 position (compound 2.1, Fig. 11 ), in particular via the reaction of thioureas with ethylchloroacetate [65] .\n\nThe dithiocarbamate method of 2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinones (rhodanines) synthesis is a convenient and often used variant of the synthesis of 4-thiazolidinone derivatives based on the [2\u00fe3]cyclocondensation [5] . R.M. Mohareb et al. had successfully applied the dithiocarbamate method for the synthesis of 3-(pyrazol-5-yl)-2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone via two-stage process based on the reaction between 3-phenyl-5-aminopyrazole 2.2 and carbon disulfide in an alkaline medium and subsequent cyclization with Various 4-thiazolidinones were synthesized by reaction of amercaptocarboxylic acids (especially thioglycolic acid) with isothiocyanates (ReN]C]S). Thus, a pyrazoleethiazolidinone 2.8 with phenyl sulfonamide linker group was obtained based on the mentioned approach [67] . There were described the synthesis of 3pyrazole-substituted or polyheterocyclic derivatives of 4thiazolidinones 2.9, 2.10 based on the reaction between thioglycolic acid and corresponding imines and methylidenehydrazydes or three-component reaction involving thioglycolic acid, aromatic aldehydes and heterocyclic amines containing diazole fragment [68e72]. The reaction of isatin with heterocyclic amines led to Schiff's bases which were further reacted with thioglycolic acid to form 3-diazole-substituted indoline-spirothiazolidinones 2.11 [73, 74] (Fig. 13 ).\n\nThe reaction between trithiocarbonyl diglycolic acid and amines in alcohol or alcoholewater medium (Holmberg synthesis) is a convenient and effective method for synthesis of 3-substituted rhodanines, especially based on the aromatic amines and carboxylic acid hydrazides [5] . The mentioned reaction was used by Augustin M. et al. for synthesis of rhodanine 2.12 with benzopyrazole fragment in position 3 [75] (Fig. 14) . The method for synthesis of pyrazoleethiazolidinone 2.15 ( Fig. 15 ) with acetamide linker group was proposed based on the reaction of 5-arylidenerhodanine-3-acetic acid 2.13 and 5aminopyrazole 2.14 in DMF in the presence of HATU (1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3oxid hexafluorophosphate) [76] .\n\nSynthesis of structurally related azolidineepyrazolines 2.16, 2.17 was proposed based on N-alkylation reaction of potassium salts of 2,4-thiazolidinedione, hydantoin and their 5-arylidene derivatives, obtained in situ (Fig. 16 ). 2-Chloro-1-(3,5-diarylpyrazolin-1-yl)ethanones were successfully used as alkylating agents [77] . successfully modified in diazo coupling reaction [91] using pyrazolyl diazonium chloride yielding compound 3.3 (Fig. 17) .\n\nThe synthesis of pyrazolineeindolineethiazolidinone conjugates 3.5, 3.6 was realized by the Knoevenagel reaction of pyrazolineeisatines 3.4 with 2,4-thiazolidinedione, 2-thioxo-4thiazolidinone and 2-amino-4-thiazolidinone in the acetic acid medium and in the presence of sodium acetate [92] (Fig. 18 ).\n\nThe synthesis of pyrazoloneethiazolidinones 3.7 ( Fig. 19 ) was achieved based on the reaction between isonitrosorhodanines and 5-methyl-2,4-dihydropyrazol-3-one using piperidine as basic catalyst [93] .\n\nMagdy allowed to obtain the corresponding pyrazole-thiazolidinones 3.9 [94] . Using hydrazine hydrate the structure of final compounds depended on the reaction medium. Thus, 1N-non-substituted pyrazoles were obtained in alcohol medium and in the presence of sodium ethylate, while 1N-acetylderivatives were formed in acetic acid. The reaction of the compound 3.8 and 1-phenylpyrazolidin- 3,5-dione in the presence of sodium ethylate led to formation of polyheterocyclic system 3.10 (Fig. 20) .\n\nSynthesis of 5-pyrazolyl-4-thiazolidinones with ethylene linker group 3.11 was performed via the [2\u00fe3]-cyclocondensation reaction of thiourea with g-pyrazolyl-a-chlorobutanoates [95] (see Pharmacologically attractive 5-(5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)rhodanines 3.12 ( Fig. 22 ) were synthesized following heterocyclization of 2-thiazolidinyl-3-oxobutanoates with phenylhydrazine or conjugation of 4-bromopyrazolon-5-ones to 3arylrhodanines [96] .\n\nThe group of pyrazolineethiazolidinones 3.13 was obtained by reaction of 5-bromo-2,4-thiazolidindione with 3,5diarylpyrazolines in alcohol medium (Fig. 23 ). The synthesized compounds were modified in position 3 of thiazolidine cycle by Mannich reaction with secondary cyclic amines and alkylation reactions forming 3.14, 3.15 [97] .\n\nThe following approach to the synthesis of pyrazolineethiazolidinone conjugates 3.16 with carbonyl methylidene linker group was based on the acylation reaction of 3,5diarylpyrazolines (Fig. 24) . The further reaction of substances 3.16 with chloroacetamides via N-alkylation reaction led to derivatives 3.17 [97] .\n\nTo explore the structure-antitrypanosomal activity relationship the pyrazolineethiazolidinone conjugates 3.18 were synthesized through the reaction of the 5-ethoxymethylidenerhodanines with 3,5-diarylpyrazolines (Fig. 25 ). 5-Pyrazoline substituted 4-thioxo-2-thiazolidinones 3.19 were obtained under the same conditions [98] .\n\nTo continue the above mentioned study, 5-pyrazoline derivatives of 4-thiazolidinone 3.21 with oxoethylamino-methylene linker group were synthesized by modification of rhodanine-5carboxylic acid 3.20 in the reaction with pyrazolines and in the presence of DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) [98] (Fig. 26 ).\n\nAntitumor activity evaluation is promising for the thiazolidinones with pyrazoline fragment. The in vitro anticancer activity of thiazolidinones with pyrazoline cycle in position 2 (4.2) or 4 (4.3) of thiazolidine was tested by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and most of them displayed anticancer activity on leukemia, melanoma, lung, colon, CNS, ovarian, renal, prostate and breast cancers cell lines. The most efficient anticancer compound 4.1 was found to be active with selective influence on colon cancer cell lines, especially on HT 29 (lgGI 50 \u00bc \u00c06.37) [33] . The SAR study revealed that: (1) anticancer activity of compounds is sensitive to the nature of substituent in position 5 of thiazolone cycle, (2) introduction of p-OH group in 5-benzylidene fragment enhanced potency, and (3) the positional isomers, namely 2-pyrazoline (4.2) and 4-pyrazoline (4.3) substituted thiazolones are promising compounds for further optimization (Fig. 27) .\n\nNovel pyrazolineethiazolidinoneeisatin 4.4 and pyrazoleindoline-2-one 4.5 conjugates were designed as potential anticancer agents (Fig. 28) . The most effective anticancer compound 4.6 was found to be active with a mean GI 50 (2) attachment of halogen (Br or Cl) to 5-position of isatin scaffold allowed to gain one log unit of activity (GI 50 level), in comparison with 5-unsubstituted isatin analogs; (3) introduction of a methyl group or CH 2 COOH group at 1N-position of isatin fragment led to the loss of activity; (4) the nature of a substituent in the 5-aryl fragment also had an influence on the antitumor activity. Therefore, the introduction of electron-withdrawing group e 4chlorine improved the antiproliferative activity in comparison with electron-donor 2-OH, 4-OMe and 4-NMe 2 groups. This would indicate that decreased of electron density on 5-aryl moiety is important for the inhibitory activity; and (5) substitution of the phenyl fragment in 3 position of pyrazoline cycle on naphthalene-2-yl substituent did not have significant influence on antitumor activity, but introduction of the 4-methoxyphenyl group in the mentioned position limited this effect [32] . method. As a result of studies two hit-compounds 4.10 and 4.11 were selected. SAR analysis showed that the determining factor for expression of antitumor activity is the structure of the substituent in the 4 position of thiazole (Fig. 29) . A modification of the ester group into hydrazide and, subsequently, a hydrazone gave the potentiation of antitumor properties. At the same time, pyrazolineethiazolidinones 4.9 had no significant cytotoxicity [35] .\n\nThe series of pyrazolineethiazolidine-based compounds were tested for antitumor activity according to standard NCI protocol and 4-thiazolidinone derivatives with pyrazoline fragment 4.12, 4.14, 4.17 showed moderate cytostatic effect. The group of publications includes the synthesis of these pyrazolineethiazolidinones 4.12, 4.14, 4.17 and pyrazolineethiazolidines 4.13, 4.15, 4.16, 4.18 with diversity of substitution in pyrazole core. The analysis of mentioned results demonstrates that the modification of pyrazoline fragment is not crucial to the implementation of antineoplastic action (Fig. 30) . This statement is evidenced by the level of efficiency of compounds 4.12e4.18 with moderate rates of effective Magdy I. El-Zahar et al. [55] synthesized a group of benzofuranepyrazoles with various heterocycles, including thiazole (4.19) and thiazolidine (4.20) fragments for screening of antitumor activity on lines: HEPG2 (liver carcinoma cell line) and HELA (cervix carcinoma cell line). Interestingly, each of these compounds showed selective effect on one of the lines similar to 5-fluorouracil (Fig. 31) .\n\nSynthesis and study of antitumor activity of pyrazole-thiazolidinoneetriazoles on lung cancer MCF-7 line were conducted by Arun M. Isloor et al. [40] . Among the studied conjugates the compound 4.21 was the most active with the effective concentration IC 50 \u00bc 22 mg/mL. The presence of o-tolyl fragment was most favorable for the anticancer effect, while substitution with naphthyl ring caused complete loss of activity (Fig. 32 ).\n\nAn important achievement in the study of anticancer pyrazolethiazolidinone hybrid compounds is the establishing of the necroptosis inhibition for pseudothiohydantoin derivatives with pyrazole moiety in 5 position (Fig. 33) . Among these derivatives a potential inhibitor Necrostatin-7 (Nec-7) was identified with the , phenol (4.23) and phenyl sulphanilic (4.24) fragments allowed to get 3e7 fold potentiation in comparison to Nec-7. In general, it should be noted that the presence of the substituent in the 4 position and its nature was crucial for the implementation of necroptosis inhibitory activity, because the change of a fluorine atom position was accompanied by loss of activity. The authors synthesized a group of related compounds with aromatic heterocycles (triazole and isooxazole) to establish the impact of pyrazole cycle for activity. This modification resulted in the loss of inhibitory activity, which confirmed the importance of pyrazole moiety in the analogs Nec-7 [87] . The study of antitumor activity for pyrazole-rhodanines allowed to identify the compound 4.25, which proved effective inhibitory effect on the most of the 60 tumor lines at micromolar concentrations according to NCI protocol (Fig. 34) . The substance 4.25 was characterized by a selective effect on leukemia and lung cancer cell lines e especially on HOP-92 (lung cancer) with the values of effective concentration and cytotoxicity GI 50 \u00bc 0.62 mM and LC 50 > 100 mM, respectively [82] .\n\nManal Sarkis et al. carried out the synthesis of new bisthiazolone derivatives as potential inhibitors of CDC25V phosphatase (specified enzyme involved in cell cycle progression and unregulated tumor development). Aiming to investigate the selectivity, the affinity of the compounds was studied to PTP1B (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B) and VHR (Vaccinia virus H1 Related e a dual-specificity phosphatase). Overall 31 compounds from bis-thiazolidinone group were synthesized and most of them displayed inhibitory activity with micromolar IC 50 values lower than the corresponding monomers. Mentioned group of the compounds included the thiazolidinoneeindazole conjugate 4.26 (Fig. 35) . It was established that the replacement of a 4hydroxyphenyl fragment with indazole was accompanied by selective inhibition of CDC25B phosphatase and loss of PTP1B inhibitory activity (abolished PTP1B inhibition) [99] .\n\nScreening of in vitro antitumor activity for 5-pyrazoline showed that the introduction of the linker group between heterocycles promoted the potentiation of antitumor activity, however, modification of 3N-position of thiazolidinone cycle via Mannich reaction and alkylation was not effective approach to optimization of hit-compounds (Fig. 36 ).\n\nThe search for new antimicrobial and antifungal agents among pyrazolineethiazolidinone related conjugates is a promising direction for biological testing of mentioned compounds. Mervat M. El-Enany et al. synthesized the group of 4-thiazolidinones and thiazoles with pyrazoline fragment in 2 position and studied their antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungi Candida albicans [24] . However, the compound 4.31 was inactive to any of the microorganisms, while activity of 4.32 on B. subtilis appeared commensurate with Amoxacillin and Propenicillin (Fig. 37) . The research of Bakr F. of microorganisms with MIC values range \u00bc 50e500 mg/mL [25] .\n\nHowever, among the above groups of compounds 4.38 could be selected, which showed 2e8 times higher bactericidal activity in experiment than Ampicillin and was twice active than Griseofulvin on fungi. The mentioned compound showed the highest activity with the value of MIC 12.5 mg/mL to P. aeruginosa (Fig. 37) .\n\nC.S. Reddy et al. performed the synthesis and study of antimicrobial activity of thiazolidinoneepyrazoles 4.39 against the B. subtilis, S. aureus, E. coli and S. pyogenes. It was established the moderate effect of mentioned compounds (MIC \u00bc 6.25e50 mg/mL) (Fig. 38) . The introduction of chlorine, nitro or hydroxyl groups in the para-position of the benzene ring resulted in 2e4 fold potentiation of activity in comparison to 3-phenyl-4-thiazolidinones. However, replacement of the phenyl moiety to pyridine (4.40) or pyrimidine was particularly effective, which allowed to get 4e8 fold enhance of efficiency [100] .\n\nThe pyrazoleethiazolidinones 4.41 or pyrazoleethiazoles 4.42, coupled by hydrazone linker group were investigated as promising agents with antimicrobial and antifungal activity. It was found that the compound 4.41b (R \u00bc Me) showed comparable activity (MIC \u00bc 25 mg/mL) with Ampicillin against E. coli, and the compound 4.41c (R \u00bc Cl) appeared to be the most active on C. albicans (MIC \u00bc 12.5 mg/mL) (Fig. 39) . Overall, pyrazole-thiazolidinones 4.41 had higher activity than related pyrazole-thiazoles 4.42 [60] . was effective bactericidal agent on the strain S. aureus (MIC \u00bc 20.8 mg/mL) and showed significant antifungal effect on S. cervesia (MIC \u00bc 41.6 mg/mL) [58] .\n\nEvaluation of antimicrobial activity for thiazolidines with 5pyrazolone fragment 4.51e4.53 (Fig. 41) revealed their effectiveness on B. subtilis NCTC 10400, S. aureus ATCC 25923, E. coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 10415) and fungi C. albicans TMRU 3669, A. niger ATCC 6265 [57] .\n\nAn antimicrobial screening was carried out for 3-pyrazolinyl-4thiazolidinones against gram-positive bacteria S. aureus MTCC096, B. subtilis MTCC 441 and Staphylococcus epidermis MTCC435, gramnegative bacteria E. coli MTCC 443, P. aeruginosa MTCC 424, S. typhi MTCC 733 and K. pneumoniae MTCC 432, and antifungal effect was studied on A. niger MTCC 282, Aspergillus fumigatus MTCC 343, Aspergillus flavus MTCC 277 and C. albicans MTCC 227. In general the tested compounds (Fig. 42) showed promising antimicrobial activity. However, it could be emphasized that the bis-spiroindolones 4.55 showed better growth inhibition compared with compounds 4.54 [101] .\n\nS.S. Reddy et al. proposed the synthesis of pyrazole-pyrimidineethiazolidinones 4.56 (Fig. 43 ) and the study of their The compounds with furane and 4-dimethylaminophenyl-groups in position 2 of thiazolidinone showed a higher or comparable efficacy (MIC \u00bc 14e22 mg/mL) to Fluconazole [72] .\n\nAmong 5-pyrazolyl-4-thiazolidinones the compounds 4.57 (Fig. 44) were investigated for their antimicrobial activity. The most effective pyrazole-thiazolidinones included the 4-Br-phenyl or thiophene fragments in molecules and showed 2e4 times higher efficiency (MIC \u00bc 16e31 mg/mL) in comparison with other derivatives [80] . The moderate antimicrobial activity towards E. coli and S. aureus was identified for 3N-glycoside substituted 2-thioxo- 4-thiazolidinone derivatives 4.58 (Fig. 44 ). The p-bromophenyl substituted derivative showed the highest efficiency against E. coli (MIC \u00bc 143 mg/mL) but was 3 times less active than tetracycline (MIC \u00bc 39 mg/mL) [84] .\n\nHowever, the most promising group of antimicrobial agents is 5pyrazolylrhodanines 4.59e4.63 [85, 86, 102, 103] . Antimicrobial activity of these substances was studied against methicillin-(MRSA) and quinolone-resistant (QRSA) S. aureus. Compounds 4.59e4.61 exhibited stronger activity than the standard drugs, norfloxacin and oxacillin, with MIC values of 1e2 mg/mL. SAR analysis for pyrazolerhodanine derivatives 4.62, 4.63 revealed the importance of aryl moiety presence in the pyrazole ring for expression of antimicrobial action and a number of substituents that considerably increased effectiveness were identified (Fig. 45 ).\n\nThe search for new chemotherapeutic agents among pyrazoleethiazolidinones is not limited by anticancer and antimicrobial studies. The evaluation of antiviral and antiparasitic activities for mentioned hybrid compounds allowed identifying promising hit-compounds and conducting SAR analysis. Osama I. El-Sabbagh proposed the synthesis of a group of pyrazolineethiazolidinones 4.64 and structurally related pyrazolineethiazoles 4.65 (Fig. 46) and performed a study of a wide range of antiviral activity. It should be noted that described compounds showed selective activity. However, one derivative (Ar \u00bc 4-Me-C 6 H 4 ) among compounds 4.64 had moderate efficacy against herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and thymidine kinase-deficient herpes simplex virus type 1 with value of the effective concentration of 4 mg/mL and cytotoxicity value 20 mg/ mL (SI \u00bc 5) [29] .\n\nStudy of thiazolidinones with sulfonamide fragment against the hepatitis C virus, conducted by Yili Ding et al. allowed to identify a number of promising antiviral agents [104] . Among the studied 4thiazolidinones the pyrazole derivative 4.66 (Fig. 46) showed moderate effectiveness (IC 50 \u00bc 10 mg/mL and EC 50 \u00bc 70 mg/mL and cytotoxicity index CC 50 \u00bc 90 mg/mL). (SI) > 16.3. In general, tested compounds had no antiviral activity against SARS CoV [97] . The screening was conducted for compounds (Fig. 45) against Trypanosoma brucei brucei (Tbb) and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (Tbg). The results showed moderate antitrypanosomal activity of compounds 4.67, 4.69 and 4.70 against both strains of tested parasites (activity indexes IC 50 (Tbb) \u00bc 5.43e13.87 mM and IC 50 (Tbg) \u00bc 2.53e6.66 mM) [97] .\n\nAiming to investigate the trypanocidal activity for pyrazolineethiazolidinone conjugates the synthesis of new 5-(pyrazolin-1-ylmethylene)-4-thiazolidinones was carried out (Fig. 48) . Target heterocycles were branched by the methylidene or oxoethylamino-methylidene linker groups. The results of screening against Trypanosoma brucei gambiense allowed to identify 5 compounds with sufficient antitrypanosomal activity (IC 50 1.2 mM) and moderate or low cytotoxicity (CC 50 The study of antiparasitic activity for pyrazolineethiazolidinone 4.76 (Fig. 49 ) was carried out towars Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma b. rhodesiense, Leishmania donovani and Plasmodium falciparum. The results indicated a moderate inhibitory effect on Trypanosoma b. rhodesiense (IC 50 \u00bc 12 mg/mL) and L. donovani (IC 50 > 30 mg/mL) and a higher influence on P. falciparum (IC 50 > 5 mg/mL) with cytotoxicity index CC 50 > 90 mg/mL [36] .\n\nThe promising direction for pharmacological investigation of [105] . Results showed that pyrazolineethiazoles/thiazolidinones 4.79, 4.80 possessed the better anti-inflammatory activity (percentage reduction of paw endema from control group was 17e50, and ketoprofen efficiency e 63%) compared with hexahydroindazole 4.77, 4.78 analogues. Comparing the effectiveness of thiazole derivatives (4.78, 4.80) with thiazolidinones (4.77, 4.79) it could be concluded the higher activity of pyrazolineethiazole hybrids (39e50%) (Fig. 50) .\n\nDetailed study of pyrazolineethiazolidinones as potential COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors allowed to identify highly active compound 4.82 (IC 50 \u00bc 0.5 mM for COX-2) with the best selective index (SI \u00bc 84.8), which effectiveness was similar to that of Celecoxib. SAR analysis (Fig. 51) of the results showed the dependence of COX-2 inhibition on the nature of aryl substituents in the 3 (A-ring) and 5 (B-ring) pyrazoline positions (structure 4.81). Thus, compounds with electron-donor substituents (methyl group) in the para-and meta-positions of the A-ring had better inhibitory effect compared with chlorine. The nature of the substituent in the para-position of the B-cycle also had a significant impact on the inhibitory activity of COX-2 in the order of:\n\nTo continue the development of structural analogues of Celecoxib, Adnan A. Bekhit et al. synthesized the series of pyrazoleethiazolidines 4.83e4.86 (Fig. 52) for anti-inflammatory activity screening using cotton pellet-induced granuloma and carrageenan-induced rat paw edema bioassays. The highly active compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit COX-1/COX-2 as well as ulcerogenic effect and acute toxicity. The first phase of the study (cotton pellet induced granuloma bioassay) allowed to Structural modification of substituents in the pyrazole moiety allowed to establish the main structural criteria to increase the inhibitory effect [83] .\n\nAmal M. Youssef et al. carried out the synthesis of 5-((1,3-aryl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)methylene)thiazolidine-2,4-diones as potential anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agents [79] . The studies conducted in vitro and in vivo allowed to identify a group of highly active anti-inflammatory compounds with a low ulcerogenic impact and satisfactory toxicometry parameters. Based on in vitro experiments four compounds (4.89) were selected for in vivo studies according to screening protocols: the formalin-induced paw edema and turpentine oil-induced granuloma pouch bioassays. It was established that the tested compounds showed activity comparable to Celecoxib at a concentration of 20 mg/kg. The introduction of benzyl moiety in position 3 of thiazolidinone was accompanied by the loss of anti-inflammatory activity (Fig. 54 ).\n\nThis review article presents the rational approaches to the design of chemotherapeutic agents based on molecular hybridization of pharmacologically attractive thiazolidine and pyrazole/ pyrazoline heterocycles. Based on linkage of target heterocyclic cores the reviewed hybrids were classified as 2-, 3-and 5-pyrazole/ pyrazoline-substituted thiazolidines. The basic approaches for the synthesis of pyrazole-thiazolidinones have been provided by a combination of two \"small\" molecules via aminolysis, acylation reactions and Knoevenagel procedure or heterocyclization of monocyclic compounds via the [2\u00fe3]-cyclization reaction yielding the series of non-condensed bicyclic systems. The review of biological applications was focused on SAR analysis and mechanistic insights of thiazolidineepyrazole hybrids. Molecular hybridization as a tool of medicinal chemistry has been successfully used for design of biologically active conjugates with antitumor activity, including inhibition of necroptosis, CDC25V phosphatase, TNF-aeTNFRc1 interaction or activation of pro-apoptotic BAX, antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral and antiparasitic applications, as well as anti-inflammatory properties as inhibitors of COX or ADAMTS-5 enzymes.\n\nAbbreviations ADAMTS a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs BAX Bcl-2-associated X protein CC 50 half maximal cytotoxic concentration CDC25V dual-specificity phosphatase, the \"cdc\" in name refers to \"cell division cycle\" DCC dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DTP Development Therapeutics Program EC 50 half maximal effective concentration ED 50 half maximal effective dose IC 50 half maximal inhibitory concentration "}
