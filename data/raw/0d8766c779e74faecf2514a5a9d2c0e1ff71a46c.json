{"title": "Sialic Acids and Sialoglycoconjugates in the Biology of life, Health and Disease", "body": "Biomolecules including monosaccharides of carbohydrates, amino acids of proteins, fatty acid of lipids, and nucleic acids including DNA and RNA play a significant role in the growth, development, and proper function of the body. Although proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and small molecules form the major constituents of human cell, the last decade has evidenced considerable progress in the study of glycans on human cells and their role in cell-cell interaction, signaling, host-pathogen interaction, and carbohydrates contributing to important biological functions in cells. Attached to lipids and proteins, carbohydrates comprise glycoproteins and glycolipids, respectively, and play diverse myriads of roles in development, signaling, host-parasite interaction, and immune system in different organisms [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The study of sialylation in bacteria is a relatively new domain which is of immense importance in understanding and targeting host-parasite interaction in infectious diseases.\n\nPlants and insects are being exploited for the production of human recombinant glycoconjugated proteins of therapeutic importance and therefore construction of recombinant organisms capable of synthesis of glycosylated proteins as therapeutic agents in humans holds importance.\n\nAltered glycosylation and sialylation have been associated with several diseases in humans including cancer and finds importance in disease targeting. Although with the advent of new technology, it has become possible to study the complex glycans and decipher their biological role in health and disease in greater details [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , a lot remains unknown.\n\nSialic acids or N-acetylneuraminic acids (Neu5Ac) are a diverse group of 9-carbon carboxylated monosaccharides synthesized in animals, present at the outermost end of N-linked and O-linked carbohydrate chains and in lipid-associated glycoconjugates (Fig. 1, 1-6 ) and lack in plants [6] . Some bacterial species can de novo synthesize sialic acids while some can acquire sialic acid from host and therefore finds relevance from the point of view of host-parasite interactions revealing evolutionary relationship [7, 8] . Sialic acid-like saccharides termed as legionaminic acid have been reported to occur in Archaea [9] .\n\nThe negative charge and hydrophilic properties of sialic acid enable its role in different normal and pathological processes, acting as binding sites for various pathogens and toxins wherein pathogen-binding protein recognizes sialic acids present in specific linkages which are thought to have evolved in vertebrates through evolution. Molecular mimicry exhibited by pathogens, by decorating with sialic acids, has been known to enable them to evade the host immune system [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [10] [11] [12] .\n\nSialic acid content of the human brain is the highest among other organisms, and may be associated with evolutionary advancement of an organism [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . In Neu5Gc or N-glycolylneuraminic acid, the terminal sialic acid residue is linked by the hydroxy group of the glycolic acid unit, synthesized from Neu5Ac catalyzed by CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) hydroxylase (CMAH) in animals including lower animals [19] [20] [21] [22] . Nue5Gc is absent in humans as they lack CMAH gene. Oxygen and reduced pyridine nucleotide play vital roles in enzyme activity together with an effective cofactor NADH and the substrate CMPNeu5Ac, and are activated by cytochrome b5. Neu5Gc is expressed in extraneural tissues but very low, absent, or reveal suppressed expression in the vertebrate brain [21] .\n\nmediating bacterial and viral infections, tumor growth and metastasis, with role in immunology, microbiome, cell signaling, reproduction, and biology of nervous system (Fig. 3 ). They play a vital role in RBC stabilization and in preventing blood component aggregation by their negative charge and hydrophilicity. Sialic acids are known to affect the stability and function of hormones and enzymes. They play a significant role in reproduction, development, and sialylation of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and contribute to their stability and function [1, [33] [34] [35] . UDP-GlcNAc is changed to ManNAc 6-phosphate (ManNAc-6-P) by UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase. Sia-9-phosphate synthetase then condenses ManNAc-6-P with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to give Sia-9-P. After dephosphorylation by Sia-9phosphate phosphatase, Sia is activated to CMP-Sia by CMP-Sia synthetase (CMAS) in the nucleus. CMP-Sia is transported into the Golgi apparatus and many sialyltransferases (STs), such as ST3, ST6, and ST8, transfer Sia residues onto the glycoproteins and glycolipids forming sialoglycoproteins and sialoglycolipids (gangliosides).

Biosynthetic pathways of sialoglycoconjugates, Biochim Biophys Acta 2016 Acta ,1860 Acta :1739 Acta -1752 They function as ligands for glycan-binding proteins, including animal lectins like selectins and siglecs, viral lectins like hemagglutinins (HAs), and bacterial lectins like adhesins and toxins. Sialosides interaction with lectins regulates immune response, immune cell functions, and cell growth and survival. Human influenza A viral HA preferentially binds to \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid and avian viral HA preferentially binds to \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid on cell surface glycoproteins thus enabling viral attachment and entry. Thus sialic acid-binding specificity of HA determines viral tropism and host specificity [34] .\n\nBacterial lectins, from Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) adhesins or Cholera and Tetanus toxins, can interact with host cells by their sialic acid-containing ligands during infection [35] .\n\nSialic acids are known to play a significant role in the development of the central and peripheral nervous system by controlling neuronal cells Biological and pathological roles of sialic acids. The negative charge and hydrophilicity enable sialic acids to confer neural plasticity, glomerular filtration, or blood cell charge repulsion. They act as binding sites for pathogens and toxins, wherein a pathogen-binding protein or extrinsic receptor recognizes sialic acid forms in specific linkages to a defined underlying sugar chain. They also act as ligands for intrinsic receptors such as Siglecs and factor H. Sialic acids enable 'molecular mimicry, ' by which microbial pathogens incorporate host sialic acids, thereby escaping the host immune responses.

(Adapted with permission from Ajit Varki Sialic acids in human health and disease Trends Mol Med. 2008; 14(8) : 351-360.) function [23, 36] . Sialylated glycoconjugates like Lewis antigens interact with selectins, affect cell adhesion, lymphocyte homing, leukocyte migration to inflamed sites, observed in inflammation, angiogenesis, metastasis, thrombosis, and cancer [37] [38] [39] . Host cell's sialic acids are used by microbial pathogens Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) to mask their antigenic sites and to prevent recognition and elimination by host immune cells [40, 41] .\n\nModifications of sialic acids include diverse forms differing in position 5 of an amino group of neuraminic acid derivatives or an hydroxyl group of 3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galactononulosonic acid (Kdn), different acylations of the NH 2 at position 5 (glycolyl, acetyl), and various substituent of the different hydroxyl groups including phosphate, sulfate, methyl, acetyl, etc. [3] . In the still growing family of sialic acids, >50 different derivatives [3, 5, 42] ( Table 1 ) have been reported of which the two most commonly expressed members of sialic acid family are Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc followed by KDN (2-keto-3-deoxy-nononic acid) and Neu (neuraminic acid) [43] .\n\nModifications to core structures of sialic acid by O-acetylation, O-methylation, or introduction of O-lactyl groups, sulfate, or phosphate esters at positions 4, 7, 8, and/or 9, generated by enzymes, have been reported. O-acetyltransferases catalyze the synthesis of O-acetylated sialic acid derivatives.\n\nSialic acids can be O-acetylated at positions C-4, C-7, C-8, and C-9 of the hydroxyl groups (Table 1 ). The monosaccharide and its linkage to other sugars in three main configurations such as \u03b1-2,3, \u03b1-2,6, and \u03b1-2,8 contribute to the diversity. Although mono-O-acetylated forms are predominant, combinations of acetyl groups at two or more positions generate oligo-O-acetylated derivatives. O-acetylation at positions C-7, C-8, and C-9 forming N-acetyl-7, 8, and 9-O-acetyl sialic acid (O-AcSA) are most common. 9-O-acetyl sialic acid (9-O-AcSA) and 4-O-acetylated sialic acid (4 O-AcSA) function as ligands for the agglutinin of influenza virus C [78] and murine hepatitis S virus [81] , respectively.\n\nEukaryotic sialic acid anabolism is a complex enzymatic process in the cytosol leading to the activation of free Neu5Ac by CTP in the nucleus. The resulting CMP-Neu5Ac and CMP-Neu5Gc (synthesized by a cytosolic CMAH) serve as donor substrates in various acceptor-substrate-specific ST reactions in the Golgi. Finally, sialate-O-acetylation occurs at the \u03b1glycosidically linked sialic acid (Fig. 4) [82] . Table 1 Naturally occurring sialic acid family members [5, [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] Name Abbreviation 5-N-Acetyl-4,9-di-O-acccyl-neuraminic acid 1,7-lactone Neu4,5,9Ac 3 1,7lactone 1-Tauryl 5-N-acetyl-neuraminic amide Table 1 Naturally occurring sialic acid family members [5, [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] \n\nThe metabolism of O-AcSA can be divided into two parts.\n\n(i) It is initiated by the formation of acetyl esters at different hydroxyl groups of sialic acids by the transfer of activated acetyl groups from acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) by O-acetyltransferases (Fig. 4) . such as esterases for Neu5,9Ac2 and Neu4,5Ac2, respectively, which are found in influenza C virus, lysosomes of mammalian cells, mouse hepatitis virus, and in horse liver.\n\nIn the past three decades, O-acetylated sialic acids (O-AcSA) have been shown as important cell membrane components that play fundamental roles in the development, immune regulation, cancer processes, and many other biological and pathophysiological events [17, 82, 84] . The biological effect depends on the position relative to the 9-carbon scaffold in Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc. The O-acetyl group being a more hydrophobic moiety when introduced into the sialic acid molecule the parameters like size, net charge, hydrogen bonding and conformation of glycoconjugate alters and the terminal location enables their involvement in different functions such as cell-cell adhesion, signaling, differentiation and metastasis [85] [86] [87] [88] .\n\nThe extended nature of oligosaccharide chains, and possibly their negative charges, plays an important role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions [86] . O-acetylated sialic acids reported to occur in bacteria and parasites are known to act as receptor determinants for some viruses, well-known cancer markers in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and also regulate ganglioside-mediated apoptosis. Sialic acid-specific O-acetyltransferases and O-acetylesterases regulate their synthesis [89] .\n\nModifications of sialic acids exhibit tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression. O-AcSA occurrence is predominant in growing and developing tissues of neuroectodermal origin and in B and T lymphocytes [90] , 9-O-Ac-GD3 distribution on the normal tissues is largely restricted to brain [91] while 9-O-acetylsialylated GT3 ganglioside [92] expression is developmentally regulated in rat embryonic cerebral cortex. Sialic acids acetylation is selectively developmentally regulated in the central and peripheral nervous system, the retina, and the medulla of kidney [93] in rat tissue .\n\nO-acetylated GD3 on human lymphocytes [94] is reported as a marker for human CD8+ T helper cells [95] . Sialyl-Le x and Sialyl-Le a ligands for selectins are known to play a major role in the early steps of leukocyte rolling on endothelial cells [96] . 9-O-acetylations on immune cells have been reported to regulate CD22 \u03b2 adhesion negatively through masking of the carbohydrate epitope. 9-O-acteyl sialoglycoconjugates (9-O-Ac-SGs) on erythrocytes in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers [97, 98] and are known to activate the alternate complement pathway enhancing hemolysis accounting for anemia [99] . Sialic acids on Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) amastigotes and two 9-O-AcSGs with Mw 158,000 and 150,000 have been identified as components of amastigote cell surface [99] [100] [101] . O-acetyl GD3 is not expressed on human normal tissues [102] . 9-O-Ac-GD3 is considered as an oncofetal marker in animal and human tumors like neuronal tumors, melanoma, basalioma or breast cancer (BC), and in psoriatic lesions [88] . 9-O-acetylated sialic acid and glycoconjugates have been reported as diagnostic and prognostic markers in childhood ALL [83, [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] . 9-Oacetylations have been reported to be upregulated in basal cell carcinoma tissues than in the surrounding skin [108] .\n\nO-acetylation of disialoganglioside GD3 by human melanoma cells has been reported to be a unique antigenic determinant [109] . BC cells have recently been reported to express b-series gangliosides GD3 and GD2, and O-acetylated GD2 (O-AcGD2) in which 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac 2 ) is predominant O-acetylated sialic acid species of GD2 [110] .\n\nTwo disease-specific 9-O-Ac-SGs, of molecular weight 90 and 120 kDa, have been reported on PBMC of patients from childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PBMCALL) [103, 111] with diagnostic and prognostic importance [103, [111] [112] [113] [114] and biological function [83, [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] , which have been demonstrated by Achatinin-H, a lectin isolated from Achatina fulica (A. fulica) snail, with 9-O-AcSA\u03b12-6GalNAc2 as its lectinogenic epitope. 9-O-AcSA-specific IgM and IgG antibodies have been reported in ALL patients and finds importance in the detection and monitoring of patients [115, 116] .\n\nThe N-acetyl group of Neu5Ac at fifth position is known to originate from AcCoA [117] [118] [119] [120] (Fig. 5 ) during conversion of GIcNH2-6-P to GlcNAc-6-P, the precursor of UDP-GlcNAc. This then converts to ManNAc by epomerization reaction, and finally to CMP-Neu5Ac [117] [118] [119] 121] . Neu5Ac is transferred to macromolecules from the nucleotide sugar, which can later be released into the lysosomes, and exported into the cytosol [122, 123] . The N\u2032-acetyl group can be converted to N\u2032-glycolyl group by a specific hydroxylase [124] .\n\nUnsaturated sialic acids occur in nature or biological fluids generated by enzymes or chemical processes such as 2,7-anhydro sialic acids released by sialidases [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] , 2,3-didehydro 2,6-anhydro from mild CMP-sialic acids [130] , and 4,8-anhydro compounds from release or deacetylation of 4-0-acetylated compounds [131, 132] . The phosphate group of Neu5Ac9P emerges from ManNAc-6-P. (i) Deaminated neuraminic acid (KDN) although reported to occur in vertebrates and bacteria, is predominantly expressed in lower vertebrates. KDN is linked to most glycan structures in place of Neu5Ac and is found to occur as glycoconjugates, including glycolipids, glycoproteins, and capsular polysaccharides. They exhibit linage types such as \u03b12,3, \u03b12,4, \u03b12,6, and \u03b12,8 bearing similarity to Neu5Ac. KDN de novo biosynthesis involves mannose as a precursor, activated to CMP-KDN and transferred to acceptor sugar residues. Predominant KDN expression has been reported to occur in fetal human red blood cells and ovarian tumor tissues as compared to adult RBC and normal individuals. KDNase, which cleaves KDN linkages, is reported to occur in bacteria [133] . KDN could arise from sequential deacetylation and deamination of Neu5Ac. C8 acidic sugar 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid (Kdo) is reported to occur in Gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and plant cell pectic rhamnogalacturonan II. In the light of recent discoveries although hitherto unknown, sialic acid expression in algae Kdo has been reported. de novo biosynthesis of the deaminated sialic acid, 3-deoxyd-glycero-d-galacto-2-nonulosonic acid (Kdn), has been reported to occur in Prymnesium parvum (P. parvum) with probable indications of role in host pathogen [134] . (ii) Other types of substitutions of the hydroxyl groups arise from use of the appropriate donors such as S-adenosylmethionine for methylated sialic acids and 3\u2032-phosphoadenosine 5\u2032-phosphosulphate for sulfated molecules. However, not many studies have been done on other modifications like O-lactyl groups.\n\nSialic acid family has now been designated as subclass of the superfamily of naturally occurring non-2-ulosonic acids (NulOs), the parent molecule of the family being neuraminic acid (Neu), which is not found in free form in nature due to its immediate cyclization to form an internal Schiff base, and is a nine-carbon-containing monosaccharide, comprising 2-keto-carboxylic acid, a deoxysugar, and an aminosugar. Other members of the NulO superfamily include 5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxynon-2-ulosonic acids, with the mother molecules pseudaminic acid (Pse), legionaminic acid (Leg), 4-epi-legionaminic acid (4eLeg), 8-epilegionaminic acid (8eLeg), acinetaminic acid (Aci), and 8-epi-acinetaminic acid (8eAci), found in bacterial polysaccharides and glycoproteins [5] (Fig. 6) . \n\nGlycoconjugates occur on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell surfaces with important biological functions like cell-cell and small molecule-cell recognition and communication. Sialic acids are predominantly found on eukaryotic cell surfaces. Pathogens ( Table 2 ) reveal property of acquiring host sialic acid on cell surfaces, thereby mimicking the host and escaping the host immune responses. Neu5Ac and its structural variants such as substitutions at carbon 5, or covalent modifications of the hydroxyl groups in sugars find importance in this context. Bacteria can either express sialic acid by de novo biosynthesis or acquire sialic acid from their environment and transport in the cell surface using transporters, thereby leading to the formation of sialic acid-acquired surfaces that can affect the host-parasite interaction. Bacteria can process them by common pathways for sialic acid metabolism and use sialic acid in different roles such colonization owing to its disease causing property.\n\nMajor disease De novo synthesis of sialic acid is reported in Escherichia coli (E. coli) K1, Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis), and Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) [8] wherein UDP-GlcNAc acts as sialic acid biosynthesis precursor and finds importance in cell wall biosynthesis, and NeuC and NeuB proteins enable Neu5Ac by ManNAc conversion (Figs. 7 and 8) .\n\nSome bacterial pathogens acquiring sialic acid from host secrete sialidase that releases sialic acid from host [135] ; but Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae), lacking sialidase genes [136] , acquires free host sialic acid by other sialidase-expressing bacteria in the host [137] , or by the action of host sialidases [138, 139] , activated during disease/inflammation. Bacteria use specific transporters to take in this free sialic acid including NanT sialic acid transporter from E. coli K-12 [8] that transports Neu5Ac uptake [8] .\n\nH. influenza and Pasteurella multocida (P. multocida) use high affinity tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter, SiaPQM [140] [141] [142] and extracytoplasmic solute receptor (ESR) protein for transport; Haemophilus ducreyi (H. ducreyi, SatABCD), causing chancroid, uses a high affinity ABC transporter [143] for the transport of sialic acid.\n\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae) uptakes activated form of sialic acid CMP-Neu5Ac by secreting the enzymes that sialylates its LPS contributing to virulence factor.\n\nNeu5Ac-inducible porin NanC (YjhA) from E. coli K-12 has recently been studied for playing a role in growth on Neu5Ac even though lacks both OmpC and OmpF porins [144] . H. influenza and E. coli can also utilize the transported sialic acid as a carbon and nitrogen source [8, 156] , the Nacetylneuraminate aldolase NanA cleaves Neu5Ac to ManNAc and pyruvate (Fig. 7) . ManNAc is later converted to fructose 6-phosphate and ammonia by NanK, NanE, NagB, and NagA proteins for further metabolism [8] .\n\nAfter either de novo synthesis or acquiring from host, sialic acid is converted to activated form CMP-Neu5Ac by CMP-sialic acid synthetases, while linkage-specific sialyltransferases enable their addition to appropriate acceptors. N. gonorrhoeae uses outer membrane-associated sialyltransferase to scavenge CMP-Neu5Ac directly from host [145] .\n\nIn E. coli, NeuA activates Neu5Ac before incorporation into the K1 and K92 capsules while the N. meningitidis ortholog enables both capsule and LPS synthesis. In E. coli, NeuS acts as polysialyltransferase adding Neu5Ac to oligosialic acid receptors to form the polysialic acid (PSA) polysaccharide capsule, exported through the Kps system [8] . After synthesis sialic acid in the PSA capsule of both N. meningitidis and E. coli can be modified by O-acetylation [146] [147] [148] like O-acetyltransferases NeuO and NeuD in E. coli can modify PSA and monomeric Neu5Ac, respectively, the latter can be deacetylated by NeuA acting as a bifunctional enzyme [148] [149] [150] .\n\nStreptococcus agalactiae (S agalactiae) is the only Gram-positive bacteria causing serious infections in newborns, and can produce sialic acid-containing capsule by using sialyltransferase (CpsK) adding terminal \u03b1-2,3-linked Neu5Ac to galactose within the capsule's oligosaccharide repeat [151] . Neu5Ac can be modified by O-acetylation [152] .\n\nSialylation of the LPS is mediated by linkage-specific sialyltransferases. Both N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae sialylate their LPS by \u03b1-2,3 sialyltransferase L. LPS sialylation is reported to occur in Pasteurellaceae, including H. ducreyi, H. influenzae, Haemophilus somnus (H. somnus), and P. multocida [153] . Lic3A, sialyltransferase adding \u03b1-2,3-Neu5Ac [154] , is associated with bacterial survival [155] . Lic3B can add mono-or disialic acid to the LPS acceptor [153] . C. jejuni possesses mono-or bifunctional LPS sialyltransferases transferring either \u03b1-2,3-Neu5Ac or disialic acid [156] . Terminal sialic acid residue in the disialylated LPS can also be modified by an O-acetyltransferase (Figs. 7) [157] as identified in C. jejuni. NeuD is believed to enter the normal PSA biosynthetic pathway via NeuA/NeuS [164] ; light-green discontinuous arrow: LPS is exposed on the outer membrane. Asterisk: O-acetylation of the disialylated LPS of C. jejuni; catalyzed by the product of the gene orf11, or sialic acid O-acetyltransferase (SOAT) [157] . IM, inner membrane; OM, outer membrane; Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminic or sialic acid; ManNAc, N-acetylmannosamine; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; GlcN Sialylated LPS and PSA capsules confer protection to the bacteria to escape host immune responses by 'molecular mimicry' [158] as was observed in studies on neisseria and hemophilus bacteria.\n\nNeisseria spp., H. influenza and C. jejuni, reveal reversible on to off switching leading to variable expression and also O-acetylation of the PSA capsule of E. coli K1 [148, 159] .\n\nThe PSA capsule of N. meningitides serogroup B and E. coli K1 is poorly immunogenic and PSA reveal structural similarities to mammalian neuronal cell adhesion molecule, NCAM [160] . The sialylated capsule of S. agalactiae inhibits phagocytosis, impairs C3 deposition on the cell surface, and prevents complement alternative pathway [161] activation. LPS sialylation inhibits the complement alternative pathway in both N. gonorrhoeae and non-typable H. influenza (NTHi) [162, 163] . Gonococcal sialylated LPS increases the binding of bacteria to factor H (fH), a complement alternative pathway inhibitor [163] , thus conferring protection from C3 attack [163] . In NTHi, LPS sialylation inhibits deposition of C3 without fH binding [162] .\n\nN-glycosylation is a posttranslational modification that occurs in all three domains. In Archaea, N-linked glycans reveal diversity which is not observed in either Eukarya or Bacteria with the lack of expression of nonulosonic acids (NulOs), sialic acids, pseudaminic acids, and legionaminic acids, in contrast to Eukarya and Bacteria. In haloarchaea Halorubrum sp. PV6 includes an N-formylated legionaminic acid and a biosynthetic pathway [9] .\n\nViral sialic acid-recognizing lectins or HAs can agglutinate RBC. Viruses use sialic acids linked to glycoproteins and gangliosides to attach to host cells, followed by their entry, for example, corona virus, DNA tumor viruses, hepatitis virus, influenza viruses (A, B, and C), mouse polyoma virus, mumps, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), norovirus, parainfluenza viruses, rotavirus, and Sendai virus. HAs from influenza A, C, NDV, and polyoma viruses have been crystallized. Sialic acid-recognizing lectins from adenoviruses and picornaviruses have not been identified.\n\nSome of these viruses carry neuraminidase or sialyl-O-acetyl-esterase that destroys the receptor, promotes virus release from infected cells, and removes sialic acid on host cell affecting cell surface binding of the virus. Influenza A virus enters the host by using host surface sialic acids. Influenza C virus HAesterase specific for 9-O-acetylated sialic acids can break down 9-O-acetyl ester. HA-esterase from mouse hepatitis virus is specific to sialic acids substituted by O-acetyl group at the C-4 position (Neu4,5Ac2). HA-neuraminidase of NDV84 and parainfluenza viruses perform vital functions in infection biology [6, 165] .\n\nSialic acids have been reported to occur in some pathogenic fungal cells such as Candida Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans), Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus), and Sporothrix schenckii (S. schenckii). Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, and Neu5,9Ac2 were reported to have been expressed. It is hypothesized that probably fungi may have unique ways to synthesize sialic acid however they may acquire it from the environment [166] [167] [168] [169] .\n\nA. fumigatus pathogenic variety reveals greater sialic acid density as compared to that of non-pathogenic Aspergillus species [170] . Scedosporium apiospermum (S. apiospermum), Scedosporium aurantiacum (S. aurantiacum), Scedosporium minutisporum (S. minutisporum), and Lomentospora prolificans (L. prolificans) reveal lack of sialic acid [171, 172] .\n\nA. fumigatus has been known to express a sialidase termed as KDNase that prefers sialic acid substrate, 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galactonononic acid (KDNase) and plays an important role in maintaining cell wall integrity and virulence [173] . Core 1 O-linked glycan-specific lectin, Hericium erinaceus lecin (HeL), has been isolated from the fruiting body of the mushroom Hericium erinaceus (H. erinaceus), which acts as a natural source for a sialic acid-binding lectin (SABL) [174] .\n\nA lectin has been reported to occur in Australian indigenous mushroom Psathyrella asperospora (P. asperospora) termed as PAL with cyotoxic properties on human colon cancer HT29 and monkey kidney VERO revealing binding preference toward N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and sialic acid (Neu5Ac) [175] . Most Fusarium lectins exhibit binding affinity to d-ribose, l-fucose, d-glucose, l-arabinose, d-mannitol, d-galactosamine hydrochloride, d-galacturonic acid, N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, N-acetylneuraminic acid, 2-deoxy-d-ribose, fetuin, asialofetuin, and bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) [176] .\n\nPlants lack sialic acid but studies on recombinant plant glycoproteins are being conducted. Neu5Ac however has been reported to occur in buckwheat using mass spectrometry. R-keto acids in plants include 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) and Kdo in cell wall polysaccharides. Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) geneome revealed lack of genes for biosynthesis, activation, or transfer of sialic acid [177] [178] [179] .\n\nN-glycosylations have been reported to occur in invertebrates (Fig. 8) .\n\nSialic acid is synthesized and expressed by different invertebrates. We discuss in brief the expression of sialic acid in invertebrate animals and its functions.\n\nParasitic protozoa are known to reveal sialoglycoconjugates which play an important role in their biological function (Table 3 ) and T. cruzi (Fig. 9) , the causative agent of life-threatening Chagas disease in South America, is known to express sialic acids transferred from the host glycoconjugates to the terminal \u03b2-galactopyranosyl residues of mucin-like molecules on parasite surface by using the enzyme trans-sialidase [180] . These sialic acids might play a role in conferring protection from the recognition and response by the host immune system. Sialic acid such as Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, Neu5,7Ac2, and Neu5,9Ac2 have been reported to occur in Dictyostelium discoideum, a trypanosome Crithidia fasciculata (C. fasciculata), piroplasmid Theileria sergenti (T. sergenti), and amoebae Entamoeba invadens (E. invadens) and Entameoba histolytica (E. histolytica) [6, [181] [182] [183] [184] [185] . \n\nAppearance of sialic acid during encystation and gangliosides in trophozoites.\n\n(a) Decreases parasite adherence to target cens thereby reducing its cytolytic activity.\n\nAbsence of Neu5Ac, instead sialic acidbinding protein EBA-175 is present.\n\nLigands for EBA-175 are essential for erythrocyte invasion.\n\nSialic acid-specific lectin identified in parasite culture supernatant\n\nEnhances parasite adhesion to mucosal surfaces Toxoplasma gondii Uptake of fetuin from the culture medium.\n\nPolyanionic adsorption (a) Determinant of virulence (b) Complement mediated cell lysis \n\nMechanoreceptors in sea-anemone tentacles are activated on binding to acetylated sugars and proline from prey [211] while tentacles of certain sea anemones bind N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) predisposing 20:199-206.) contact-sensitive mechanoreceptors (CSMs) [212] [213] [214] [215] to trigger discharge upon physical contact of prey and cyclic AMP (cAMP) has been reported to be involved in NANA-sensitized nematocyst discharge [212, 216] .

Siglecs include (a) CD33-related Siglecs and (b) Siglec-1 (Sialoadhesin), Siglec-2 (CD22), Siglec-4 (myelin-associated glycoprotein, MAG), and Siglec-15.\n\nPhylogenetic studies in higher vertebrates including fishes, amphibians, birds, reptiles and mammals have revealed that Siglecs are conserved in evolution [316] . A loss of Siglec genes in rodents have been reported. The cytoplasmic domain of most Siglecs contain immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that recruit tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 and function as inhibiting receptors, inhibiting signal transduction. Siglec-14, Siglec-15, and Siglec-16 associate with tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) adaptor DAP12 and act as activating receptors by recruiting SYK kinase. Siglecs are known to play a vital role in immune regulation in host-pathogen interaction in infectious diseases, inflammation, neurodegeneration, autoimmune diseases, and cancer [317] . The sialic acid-Siglec axis has been recently reported to be exploited by tumors and pathogens for the induction of immune tolerance [318] .\n\nSABLs are lectins that specifically recognize sialic acid residues [319] . They have been reported to occur in plants and animal sources with diverse specificity and are being exploited for analytical properties (Table 5) .\n\nSelectins are a diverse group of calcium-dependent, type I transmembrane molecules that bind to sialylated, fucosylated carbohydrates, function in vascular adhesion, and play a significant role in inflammation, immunity, hemostasis, and cancer progression. Selectin ligand reveal overexpression of Selectins play a vital role in leukocyte homing. L-Selectin binding to ligands on leukocytes activates leukocytes. Selectins enable interactions with platelets and endothelial cells. The interaction between selectin ligand P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 PSGL-1 on leukocytes and P-selectin on platelet or E-selectin on endothelial cells triggers intracellular signaling in leukocytes.\n\nSelectins and their ligands play an important role in the human implantation. L-selectin on interaction with its ligands plays a critical role in the adhesion of the blastocyst to the endometrium at the maternal-fetal interface. P-selectin and E-selectin play a vital role in human implantation [349] . PSGL-1 is now known as a major participant in inflammation, thrombus, along with cancer [350] . Due to their role in cancer immune system modulation they are being studied as possible targets for controlling tumor immunity [351] .\n\nAlthough sialic acids are found to occupy the terminal position of glycans of all cell types, in disease states, like cancer or immunological disorders, the sialylation profile of cells in affected tissues manifest altered downregulation or overexpression-or neoexpression of certain glycan structures [352] . a Expression (source) is in human, unless otherwise stated. b Mo, monocyte; Gr, granulocyte. c Most of the proteins are cloned and/or purified to homogeneity, except for the entities marked with an asterisk (*). Adapted with permission and updation from Angata T, Varki A. Chemical diversity in the sialic acids and related \u03b1-keto acids: an evolutionary perspective. Chem Rev 2002;102:439-469. Aberrant sialylation of oligosaccharide branches of N-glycans (\u03b21,6-GlcNAc branching) or affected terminal glycan sequences, like premature sialylation of truncated saccharide units, are reported to occur due to affected or altered enzyme expression [352] . In rheumatoid arthritis, an incomplete IgG glycosylation with galactose and sialic acid is observed to lead to immune disorder [353] .\n\nBut upregulated expression of sialyltransferases like ST3Gal-I is observed in human BC [354] and upregulated ST6Gal-I is reported in human BC and colon cancer. Ganglioside overexpression in cancer has been reported such as CNS-specific GD3s from tumor tissues [355] . The overexpression of 9-O-acetylated sialic acid in BC [356] , childhood ALL [83, [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] are reported.\n\nAltered cell sialylation in cancer affects tumor cell interactions with other cells affecting cell adhesion, migration, and metastasis [357] [358] [359] Sialylation affects natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity [360] . Tumor cell hypersialylation has been observed to enable tumor cell to evade recognition by NK cells, thus escaping the immune responses. Hypersialylation of tumor cells enables it to escape the immune surveillance [358] .\n\nSialic acid ligand-protein interaction is being exploited for design and development of therapeutics and anticancer therapies containing sialoside that targets siglecs [361] . Nanoparticle formulations are being tested to deliver potential therapeutic agents to the target cell [317] .\n\nUpregulated sialyltransferases and fucosyltransferases lead to the overexpression of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACA), being mucin related to Thomsen nouvelle (Tn) antigen (Tn), the sialyl-Thomsen nouvelle (sTn) antigen, Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (TF-Ag), the blood group-related Thomsen-Lewis antigens Lewis Y , Sialyl Lewis X and Sialyl Lewis A , and Lewis X (or specific embryonic antigen-1, SSEA-1), the glycosphingolipids Globo H, stage-specific embryonic antigen-3 (SSEA-3), sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, the gangliosides GD2, GD3, GM2, fucosyl GM1, and Neu5GcGM3, and PSA [362] that have been implicated in tumor, metastasis, and poor prognosis. Some TACAs are also expressed in fetal tissue, and termed as oncofetal antigens [362] .\n\nTF-Ags increased the expression in pancarcinoma and carcinomas of the breast, colon, bladder, prostate, liver, and stomach as compared to normal cells and its role in metastasis renders it as an important tumor target [362] .\n\nThe overexpression of Lewis Y in ovarian, breast, prostate, colon, and epithelial cell lung cancers than in the normal cells makes them potential targets. The overexpression of SLe X in breast, ovarian, melanoma, colon, liver, lung, and prostate cancers and SLe A in breast, colon, and pancreas cancers, and in melanomas due to the upregulated expression of ST3Gal-III and FucT-III enzymes, synthesizing sLea and ST3Gal-IV, ST3Gal-VI, and FucTVII, catalyzing the synthesis of sLex, or due to deficiency in the enzymes responsible for sulfation, and their overexpression acting as E-selectin ligands contribute to metastasis and poor prognosis makes them potential targets. The treatment of these antigens with antibodies inhibited metastasis in pancreatic tumor mouse models. PSA is overexpressed in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumor, and neuroblastoma and PSA-NCAM is involved in increased tumor growth and metastasis with decreased patient survival. Endoneuraminidase N, cleaving PSA could stop cell growth in rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma cells [362] .\n\nDownregulated sialyltransferases and fucosyltransferases lead to reduced cell surface sialylation and reduced TACA expression, decreasing adhesion and migration potency and metastatic activity [363] . sTn antigen generated by sialylation of Tn antigen [364] by ST6GalNAc I occurs rarely in healthy tissues but has been observed in epithelial cancer cells and breast tumors [365] .\n\nStrategies like enzyme inhibitors for disease-associated carbohydrates are being studied, designed, and developed. Inhibitors for the carbohydrate-binding receptors are also being conceived as a strategy [366] . X-ray crystallographic structures of mammalian sialyltransferases (STs) complexed with their ligands are enabling us to better understand the substrate specificities and inhibitor design [367] .\n\nInhibition of STs, glycosyltransferases, is a strategy to reduce cell surface sialylation particularly in cancer [368] . Lack of ST3Gal-IV and ST3Gal-VI reduces sialic acid containing ligands for selectin interactions, thus affecting leukocyte homing and leukocyte recruitment at inflammation sites [369] . Streptococcus pneumonia leads to septicemia, meningitis, and communityacquired pneumonia in human. Although prophylactic vaccines are the strategies available for disease targeting, Streptococcus pneumonia (S. pneumonia) sialidases, including NanA and NanB, implicated in the pathogenesis of S. pneumonia and design of novel NanB-selective inhibitors are being tested for drug targets [370] .\n\nBinding with selectin antagonists, like bimosiamose (TBC-1269) and GSC-150, sialoside-selectin interactions can be blocked; selectin antagonists also find application in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases and metastatic cancers [371] . 11a sLex-derived inhibitor of E-selectin, CGP69669A, with affinity higher than natural ligand sLex has been designed [372] . Modified sLex-containing glycopeptide analogues for E-selectin inhibition has been designed [373] . P-selectin antagonist, GMI-1070, is in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of sickle cell crisis, associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) [374] . Bimosiamose (TBC-1269), a P-selectin antagonist, has been reported to have successfully completed phase II clinical trials for psoriasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [375] .\n\nN-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase and N-acetylneuraminic acid aldolase allow conversion of simple and sugars into different sialic acid-related compounds from whole cell extracts enabling large scale and economical synthesis of sialic acid and sialyloligosaccharides [376] .\n\nLow molecular weight antagonists, targeting sialoside interaction with the lectin MAG, have been designed as a therapeutic strategy to promote axon regeneration after neuronal injury [377] . Zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) are designed as sialic acid-based inhibitors of the viral enzyme neuraminidase for targeting influenza infections [378] .\n\nBut design of carbohydrate-derived drug molecules faces challenges such as pharmacokinetic profiles, poor bioavailability, requirement for active transport through membranes, short plasma half-life, poor metabolic stability, and are rapidly excreted [379, 380] . However, this area of biology is developing with studies or approaches to improve their pharmacokinetic profiles like systematic structural modifications such as the replacement of certain moieties, the introduction of hydrophobic moieties, and/or the incorporation of a prodrug strategy leading to compounds that mimic the biological activity of their carbohydrate precursors called as 'glycomimetics' like neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir [381, 382] .\n\nDrugs targeting glycan-lectin interactions need to be designed by synthetic introduction of moieties that increase the affinity. Inhibition of enzymes in the synthesis of tumor-associated glycans is another strategy [383] .\n\nLiposomal nanoparticle are being exploited in selective delivery of drugs and therapeutics like chemotherapeutic doxorubicin in B cell lymphoma, wherein high-affinity ligand, 9-N-biphenylcarboxyl (BPC)-Neu5Ac-\u03b12,6-Gal-\u03b21,4-GlcNAc, on the liposomal surface confers the selectivity being recognized by CD22 (Siglec-2), exclusively expressed on B cells and trisaccharide derivative BPC-Neu5Ac-\u03b12,6-Gal-\u03b21,4-GlcNAc conjugated to pegylated lipid is used in vesicle formation with encapsulated doxorubicin thereby selectively targeting CD22-expressing cells, including B cell lymphoma [384] [385] [386] .\n\nSelective ligands targeting the lectins CD22 and CD33 are being designed [387] [388] [389] . 4-Cyclohexyl-1,2,3-triazole residues at position 5 of sialic acid in combination with meta-substituted moieties at position 9 have been reported to improve affinity and selectivity profile [390] .\n\nTherapeutic antibodies find application in leukemia and lymphoma. CD33 in leukemic cells and CD22 in B-cell lymphoma are being exploited for targeting. Anti-siglec-monoclonal antibodies conjugated to toxins or chemotherapeutic agents are being designed like gemtuzumab (Mylotarg), an anti-CD33-antibody in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), approved by the FDA in 2000 but faces challenges of safety issues [390, 391] and epratuzumab, an anti-CD22-antibody, is being designed for targeting non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and the autoimmune disorder systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [392] .\n\nCarbohydrate-based vaccines designed based on altered cell surface glycans in disease as compared to normal cells are the latest strategy for targeting cancer, developed over the last two decades, and are used after conventional therapeutic modes of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy [390, 392] .\n\nTACA are being exploited as vaccine targets for their elimination. However, they suffer challenges of being poorly immunogenic self-antigens and strategies to improve antigenicity like conjugating to a carrier protein, for example, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), and attachment sites for carbohydrate antigen conjugation [390, 393] . Vaccine constructs need to be designed to activate both cell miated and humoral immune responses against specific carbohydrate epitopes of tumor cells [390, 394, 395] . Theratope, a sTn-KLH conjugate, is in clinical practice since 2002 for metastatic BC and colorectal cancer, however, is still in phase III clinical trials since 2003 [390, 396, 397] .\n\nGlobo H, cancer vaccine against a carbohydrate epitope is unique to target prostate and ovarian cancer cells, such as TACA, including Globo H, sTn, Tn, TF, and Ley antigens attached to a MUC1 glycopeptide backbone conjugated to KLH [362, 390, 394, 398, 399] (Fig. 10) . Mimicking of the tumor cell's natural carbohydrate epitope composition is hypothesized for a more effective immune response.\n\nSialic acid containing SSEA3 (Gb5) and SSEA4 detected on BC cells and other types of cancer [390, [400] [401] [402] finds application in anticancer vaccine development. Hypersialylation has been observed to increase their serum half-lives with increased stability of luteinizing hormone (LH) and erythropoietin (EPO) [390, 403] . Ligand for Siglec-7 is being exploited in anticancer therapy.\n\nEfficiency of Gp120 immunogens (MN-and A244-rgp120) used in the RV144 trial conferring protection against HIV were improved by enriching the sialic acid content and lacking N-linked glycosylation sites needed for binding by bN-mAbs [404] .\n\nThus sialic acid is offering advantages in designing therapeutics and in targeting diseases like cancer and other immunological disorders.\n\nSialic biology, with huge diversity in forms, structures, expression, metabolism, and functions in the diverse living world, is a fascinating science and our knowledge in this domain is growing day by day. While the pathogens primarily use sialic acid to mimic the host and escape immune responses, it has different functions in mediating cell-cell interaction, signaling, immune reactions, development and function in animals, and completely lacks in plants. Glycoengineering is enabling modification of plant glycoslation pathways toward the synthesis of mammalian glycoproteins which we have discussed in subsequent chapters. Insect sialylation revealing differences from the mammalian sialylation pathway has been discussed in the subsequent chapters.\n\nIn the cancer cells, overexpression of sialylation and enzymes involved is reported and forms an interesting area in cancer targeting. Glycomimetics is another such developing domain in the designing of sialic acid-related therapeutics. Nanobiotechnology and its application in sialic acid biology is an emerging domain and has been discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nAt this point although a lot of studies has been done, the scope of applications of sialic acid in therapy is an emerging science which seems to be just the tip of the iceberg for the immensely important potential of sialic acid biology."}
