{"title": "Host protein CD63 enhances viral RNA replication by interacting with human astrovirus nonstructural protein nsP1a/4 2", "body": "showed that nsP1a/4 and CD63 co-localized in the cytoplasm of infected cells. 28 Over expression of CD63 promoted viral RNA synthesis, whereas knockdown 29 of CD63 markedly decreased viral RNA levels. Those results suggest that CD63 30 plays a critical role in human astrovirus RNA replication. The interaction 31 between CD63 and nsP1a/4 provides a channel to further understand the roles of 32 interactions between host and virus proteins in astrovirus infection and release. Human astroviruses cause gastroenteritis in young children and 36 immunocompromised patients. In this study, we provide evidence that nsP1a/4, 37 author/funder. All rights reserved.

We amplified thensP1a gene by PCR and inserted the resulting 92 PCR product (2781bp) by recombination cloning into the yeast two-hybrid 93 (Y2H) bait vector pGBKT7 as a C-terminal fusion with a Gal4 DNA-binding 94 domain (BD). We confirmed the correct constructs by enzyme digestion and 95 DNA sequence analysis (Fig 1A) . When introduced alone into yeast Y2HGold 96 cells, the Gal4 (BD)-nsP1a bait construct wasnot toxic to the yeast and did not 97 auto-activate the Y2H reporter gene, indicating that the construct was suitable 98 for use in a Y2H screen (Fig 1B) . 99 Using a Y2H assay with Gal4 (BD)-nsP1a as bait and a human Caco-2 cDNA 100 prey library, we screened approximately 2.5\u00d710 5 clones and identified 14 101 positive bait-prey interactions. Sequence and bioinformatics analysis of the 14 102 positive prey plasmids,listed by their initial positive-interaction identification 103 number,indicated that they represented 14 different human cDNAs(data not 104 shown). We next measured the strength of interaction between thensP1a bait and 105 each of the 14 human prey proteins in yeast using a qualitative growth assay and 106 quantitative \u03b2-galactosidase activity assays. We performed bioinformatic 107 analysis of the human proteins confirmed by the qualitative growth assay to gain 108 functional insights into the potential interactions between those proteins and 109 nsP1a (Fig 2) .

We transfected HEK293 T cells with 113 PEF-HA-nsP1a and pcDNA3.1-3flag-CD63.After 48 h, we performed 114 immunoprecipitation with the cell lysates from those cells using an anti-Flag M2 115 Affinity Gel (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). We analyzed the resulting protein 116 complexes by western blot with anti-Flag or anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3A) . We 117 detected no proteins in control lysates from cells transfected with empty vector 118 (Fig. 3A , lane 1).We detected CD63 protein only in the lysates from cells that 119 wre transfected with pcDNA3.1-3flag-CD63 (Fig. 3A, lane 2) .Likewise, we 120 detectednsP1a protein only in the lysates from cells that were transfected with 121 PEF-HA-nsP1a (Fig. 3A, lane 3) . Both nsP1a and CD63 were readily detected in 122 the lysates from cellsthat were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-3flag-CD63 and 123 PEF-HA-nsP1a. The HA antibody was able to pull down CD63-Flag together 124 with nsP1a-HA (Fig. 3A, lane4) . Likewise, the Flag antibody was able to pull 125 down nsP1a-HA together with CD63-Flag (Fig. 3A, lane4) . Taken together, the 126 results suggested that nsP1a was able to interact with the CD63 in vivo. 127 nsP1a interacts with CD63 in vitro. To further investigate the interaction 128 between nsP1a and CD63, we determined whether the interaction occurs 129 invitro.We expressed recombinant full-length nsP1a-GST fusion protein 130 (\u2248118kDa) induced by isopropyl \u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside(IPTG)in 131 Escherichia coli (Fig. 3B lanes 1-6) . We also detected purified nsP1afrom the 132 bacteria (Fig. 3B lane7) and human CD63 His Tag commercialized recombinant 133 protein (\u224826kDa) by western blot (Fig 3B lane8) .

We immobilized 135 nsP1a-GST on glutathione agarose and added CD63-His to assess 136 protein-protein binding. We used an untreated gel as a negative control. We 137 analyzed the protein in the complexes by western blot with anti-GST or anti-His 138 antibody.

That result along with those of a 180 previous Y2H screen and GSTpull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays 181 suggested that nsP1a/4 interacts with the CD63LEL domain. HAstV-1 (MOI 10). We collected lysates from mock-infected (control) and 186 HAstV-infected cells 24h and 48h after infection. We isolated total cellar RNA 187 and quantified the expression of CD63 mRNA using real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 6A ). 188 We also performed western blot to detect CD63 protein expression in the 189 cellular lysates (Fig 6B) .

To better 225 understand the role of nsP1a in viral replication, we analyzed the interaction of 226 nsP1a with host proteins. A Y2H screen of aCaco-2 cDNA library showed that 227 14 independent proteins, including CD63, interacted with nsP1a. \n\nIn light of those results, we sought to explore the nsP1a/CD63 interaction in 244 author/funder.
