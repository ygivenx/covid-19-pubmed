{"title": "ACVIM consensus statement on the diagnosis of immune\u2010mediated hemolytic anemia in dogs and cats", "body": "Immune\u2010mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) in dogs and cats is associated with high morbidity and mortality.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Pathogenic autoantibodies target erythrocyte membrane epitopes,6, 7 providing a mechanism for fraction crystallizable receptor\u2010mediated extravascular hemolysis mediated by macrophages.8 Complement can interact with antibodies bound to erythrocytes, facilitating extravascular hemolysis or causing intravascular hemolysis by formation of the membrane attack complex. An expeditious diagnosis that distinguishes IMHA from other causes of anemia is critical to the rapid institution of appropriate treatment. Various criteria for the diagnosis of IMHA have been described in the literature based on the documentation of immune\u2010mediated erythrolysis or proxy markers for this phenomenon,9, 10, 11, 12 but little consensus exists on which criteria are required for definitive diagnosis. Furthermore, the differentiation of spontaneous IMHA from disease associated with putative trigger factors is an important first step in the diagnostic evaluation, because removal of trigger factors whenever possible is a crucial component of treatment. However, no guidelines exist for the diagnostic assessment of trigger factors, and formal assessment of the evidence for their implication in IMHA is lacking. An evidence summary would allow clinicians to better gauge the likelihood of a given comorbidity being implicated in the pathogenesis of IMHA, and would help to guide on which diagnostic tests should be performed in individual patients.\n\nThe objective of this Consensus Statement is therefore to present guidelines on both the fundamental diagnosis of IMHA and tests to screen for putative trigger factors, based on evidence, inferences from parallel data in human medicine, and expert opinion. Work contributing to this Consensus Statement was completed by members of the Consensus Panel and additional members of the relevant Veterinary and Comparative Clinical Immunology Society (VCCIS) task forces established in 2015.\n\nWe searched 2 databases (Medline and Web of Science) for relevant references in April 2016 and March 2018. Standard Boolean search terms allowing lemmatization were adopted. References captured by the algorithm {(anemia OR anaemia) AND (dog OR cat) AND (immun*)}, hereafter denoted by A1, were imported into reference management software (Mendeley, Elsevier, New York; EndNote X8, Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia), before manual screening on the basis of inclusion criteria outlined in Supporting Information S1. The reference lists of papers also were examined to capture references not cited on Medline or Web of Science. Pathogen\u2010specific searches were conducted to capture additional references (Supporting Information S1).\n\nA total of 723 papers were captured by the search algorithm A1. Abstracts of all papers were reviewed by OAG, LK, UJ, ALM, SB, BG, RG, and JS, leading to the rejection of 475 papers because they failed to meet inclusion criteria. A further 67 duplicate papers were excluded, yielding 181 unique papers. Of these, an additional 118 papers were excluded because they did not include information on patients with potential trigger factors. Of the remaining 63 papers, 52 contained information of relevance to infectious disease, including 14 genera of microbes infecting dogs and 8 genera of microbes infecting cats. A pathogen\u2010specific search on the basis of these genera yielded 11 additional papers meeting inclusion criteria. A search performed in March 2018, using both A1 and the pathogen\u2010specific algorithms, yielded another 6 papers. An important paper published before the advent of online archiving was added to the list. Data therefore were extracted from 81 papers (Figure 1).\n\nWe designed a novel quality assessment and data extraction tool, which included domains to capture information on study design (D) and quality (Q), confidence of comorbidity diagnosis (C), likelihood of a causal link between comorbidity and IMHA (L), confidence of IMHA diagnosis (I), and the number of patients with a given comorbidity (N). For the purposes of this study, the term \u201ccomorbidity\u201d included exposure to drugs, toxins, and vaccines. Additional domains captured detailed information on each of the comorbidities, including statistical inferences when available. Comorbidities were summarized in 5 broad categories: infectious disease, cancer, inflammatory disease, drugs and toxins, and vaccines. Panel members and non\u2010panel VCCIS task force members were assigned to random pairings for the purpose of data extraction and quality assessment, dividing the total number of papers equally among all pairs. Concordance among the pairs was sought if individual members disagreed on specific observations, and all observations relating to quality assessment were confirmed by LK and OAG.\n\nFor each comorbidity identified in a paper, an integrated metric of evidence (IME) was computed as the sum of the normalized scores, weighted according to our assessment of relative importance to evidence rating, so long as only that comorbidity was present in individual patients, hence IME = 2D + Q + C + 2L + I + N. If >1 comorbidity was present in individual patients, including those infected with >1 agent, an IME value was not calculated. Reference to the patients nevertheless was made in the narrative if they yielded insight. Score D was assessed after positing the question: Does the study ask whether a comorbidity induces (or is associated with) IMHA as part of its hypothesis or specific aims, or is the question that a comorbidity induces (or is associated with) IMHA answered by study design? If the answer was yes, a D score was assigned; if the answer was no, the study was designated \u201cDescriptive Association Only\u201d for that comorbidity and assigned an arbitrary D score of 1 (the lowest possible) out of a maximum of 7. A Q score was not computed for comorbidities assigned Descriptive Association Only, because general study quality in those cases was irrelevant to the question of the causal relationship between comorbidity and IMHA; Q scores in those cases were therefore 0. The maximum normalized score for each criterion was 1, yielding a maximum IME value of 8 and a minimum of <1. An IME value of 0 was applied when a study presented evidence against a comorbidity being associated with IMHA. For each comorbidity within a paper, the most conservative score for each of the IME criteria was applied for the relevant cohort of patients, to avoid exaggeration of evidence.\n\nThreshold IME values were computed to allow comorbidities to be designated as negligible, low, intermediate, or high evidence for a causal relationship with IMHA. The threshold between negligible and low evidence was taken to be a hypothetical Descriptive Association Only study, with intermediate C, L, and I scores, and 1 positive case (IME = 2.95). The threshold between low and intermediate evidence was taken to be a hypothetical cross\u2010sectional study, with a Q score of 28, intermediate C, L, and I scores, and 2\u20105 positive cases (IME = 4.37). Finally, the threshold between intermediate and high evidence was taken to be a hypothetical prospective cohort/case\u2010control study, with a Q score of 28, high C score, intermediate L score, high I score (mechanistically based), and 2\u20105 positive cases (IME = 5.78).\n\nThe quality assessment and data extraction tool is shown in Supporting Information S2; Supporting Information S3 shows the derivation of each of the scores D, Q, C, L, I, and N.\n\nEach panel member drafted recommendations in assigned areas. The draft recommendations then were subjected to 3 rounds of Delphi review, during which each panel member was able to give written feedback on every recommendation using an online questionnaire (Survey Monkey, San Mateo, California). At the end of each round, suggestions were incorporated into the working template by 1 facilitator, and only recommendations for which consensus had not yet been reached were included in the subsequent Delphi cycle. After 3 rounds of review, unanimous consensus had been reached on the majority of recommendations. Where differences of opinion remained, these are indicated in the text of the Consensus Statement.\n\nOAG, LK, UJ, AMM, and SB were assigned \u22651 sections of the working document for further editing and incorporation of comments generated during oral presentation. These sections then were edited by the co\u2010Chairs, before submission to ACVIM for review by all members. The draft Consensus Statement also was submitted to the European College of Veterinary Internal Medicine, American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care, European College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care, the American College of Veterinary Pathology, and the European College of Veterinary Clinical Pathology for solicitation of comments from members. Feedback from these specialist colleges was used by the panel members to produce the final Consensus Statement.\n\nA spun PCV is suggested because calculated hematocrit may be unreliable when agglutination is present.18, 19, 20 However, studies in humans have reported increased plasma trapping by abnormal erythrocytes (eg, spherocytes), which could introduce inaccuracy into the spun PCV.21 To the best of our knowledge, the effect of agglutination or spherocytosis on spun PCV has not been investigated in veterinary species. Lack of regeneration (as assessed by reticulocyte count) does not eliminate IMHA because approximately 30% of dogs have non\u2010regenerative anemia at presentation.5, 22\n\n\nSpherocytes should be used as a diagnostic criterion only in dogs because feline erythrocytes do not consistently display central pallor. Interpreting spherocytes after blood transfusion should be done cautiously, because stored blood products may contain high proportions of spherocytes23 and spherocytes have been documented in human patients with hemolytic transfusion reactions.24, 25 Spherocytosis should be assessed in the monolayer of a well\u2010made blood smear, because spherocyte\u2010like artifacts arise toward the feathered edge and in thick areas.26 In anemic animals, spherocytes should be confirmed in the deeper monolayer to avoid artifacts in thin areas. Spherocytosis also can induce increased osmotic fragility,27, 28 but because osmotic fragility testing is influenced by other factors (eg, hyperlipidemia,27 erythrocyte age29), the panel does not advocate its routine use in the diagnosis of IMHA.\n\nReported causes of non\u2010immune\u2010mediated spherocytes, or morphologically similar pyknocytes, should be eliminated, including oxidative damage (eg, zinc30, 31 and acetaminophen32), envenomation,33, 34, 35, 36, 37 hypersplenism (eg, hepatosplenic lymphoma),38 pyruvate kinase deficiency,39 disorders associated with erythrocyte fragmentation (eg, endocarditis,40 microangiopathic hemolytic disorders including hemangiosarcoma,41 or hemolytic uremic syndrome),42 and dyserythropoiesis.43 Hereditary spectrin deficiency also potentially may give rise to spherocytes if smears are made from blood stored >24 hours.44 The percentage of spherocytes on blood smears from human patients with mutations causing hereditary spherocytosis is variable, but can be high.45 A literature search for canine hereditary spherocytosis did not identify any cases with marked spherocytosis.\n\nIn a single study, \u22655 spherocytes/\u00d7100 oil immersion field yielded 63% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 39%\u201084%) (when 95% CIs were not provided by the authors, the online MedCalc Diagnostic test evaluation calculator [https://www.medcalc.org/calc/diagnostic_test.php] was used to calculate them) and 95% specificity (95% CI, 76%\u2010100%) for IMHA in dogs,27 compared with 74% sensitivity (95% CI, 49%\u201091%) and 81% specificity (95% CI, 59%\u201095%)c for \u22653/\u00d7100 oil immersion field.27 A threshold of \u22655 spherocytes/\u00d7100 oil immersion field therefore could be considered supportive of a diagnosis of IMHA, but 3\u20104 spherocytes/\u00d7100 oil immersion field also may be consistent with IMHA provided no other cause of spherocytosis is identified. These thresholds are similar to the criteria for 1+ spherocytosis in a proposed semiquantitative grading system.46 Where spherocyte numbers are low (versus their typical abundance in extravascular IMHA), variability among fields could be an issue: calculating mean count over several fields (eg, 10) could help establish the true extent of spherocytosis. For enrollment of cases in IMHA research, only high\u2010quality blood smears should be used, and given the pitfalls of spherocyte recognition, examination of the smears by a board\u2010certified clinical pathologist is advantageous.\n\nAlthough evaluation of dried blood smears or hematology instrument scatter plots20 can suggest agglutination, the panel does not consider these techniques adequate to confirm agglutination based on the possibility of overlapping rouleaux on blood smears and the potential for other causes of macrocytes on scattergram evaluation.47 Saline agglutination testing performed by mixing 4 drops of saline with 1 drop of blood has a reported specificity of 100% (95% CI, 95%\u2010100%)c for IMHA in dogs.27 Mixing blood and saline 1:1 yielded a specificity of 95% (95% CI, 88%\u201099%)c based on 85 dogs without IMHA, or 85% (95% CI, 65%\u201096%)c when only anemic dogs were considered.11 Agglutination that persists after mixing 1 drop of blood with 4 drops of saline therefore is considered adequate evidence for agglutination in most cases.27 Considerably higher dilution ratios can aid the microscopic identification of agglutination. To decrease false positives, confirming that agglutination persists after washing erythrocytes 3 times in a 1:4 ratio with saline11 is recommended for animals with equivocal results (eg, rare small erythrocyte clumps in an otherwise negative test), markedly increased total protein (eg, leishmaniasis, multiple myeloma, and feline infectious peritonitis [FIP]) or fibrinogen concentrations,48 or strong rouleaux formation on blood smear examination. Based on reports of agglutination of washed erythrocytes from normal dogs at 4\u00b0C, we suggest that the saline solution should be between room temperature and 37\u00b0C.49\n\n\nFive panel members preferred the direct Coombs' test (DAT) and 3 considered flow cytometry and DAT to be equally useful. Supporting Information S4 provides recommendations for performance of these tests. If the DAT cannot be performed because agglutination persists after washing, the combination of anemia, hemolysis, and persistent agglutination is sufficient for diagnosis of IMHA. Immunochromatography offers an alternative to conventional DAT or flow cytometry, but confirming negative results by conventional DAT may be advisable because of frequent weak positive test strips in DAT\u2010positive dogs.11\n\n\nFor DAT, sensitivity ranged from 61 to 82% for dogs27, 50 and 82% for cats51 for studies reported between 2006 and 2016 that did not rely on DAT alone for the diagnosis of IMHA and reported sensitivity or sufficient information for its calculation. Specificity for DAT was 94%\u2010100% for dogs11, 27, 50, 52 and 95%\u2010100% for cats9, 51, 53 for studies published between 2006 and 2016 that reported specificity or sufficient information for its calculation. Although small experimental studies have reported sensitivities of up to 100% for flow cytometry,54, 55, 56, 57 sensitivity was 67% (95% CI, 53%\u201079%)c in a larger study reporting results of routine clinical testing.58 For studies including clinically ill negative controls, specificity for flow cytometry was 87.5% (95% CI, 47%\u2010100%)c\n54 to 92% (95% CI, 88%\u201095%)c.56\n\n\nReports of sample handling effects on flow cytometry are lacking. Storage of samples at 4\u00b0C for up to 7 days before DAT testing is acceptable unless the laboratory advises otherwise.11 Current data, although limited, suggest that although immunosuppression does not immediately result in a negative DAT,11, 59 interindividual variability exists in the time required to become negative DAT after initiation of treatment.11, 60 For flow cytometry, anecdotal reports suggest that immunosuppression decreases the percentage of antibody\u2010positive erythrocytes.56 Therefore, where possible, we recommend collection of samples for DAT or flow cytometry before initiation of treatment. Large\u2010scale studies of the effect of prior blood transfusion on DAT or flow cytometry are lacking. Based on reports of DAT\u2010negative results for 21 dogs posttransfusion,11 prior blood transfusion is not an absolute contraindication for testing. However, a positive DAT has been reported in a dog without signs of IMHA but with a history of multiple transfusions.61 Furthermore, delayed serological or hemolytic transfusion reactions with positive DAT are reported in humans.62, 63, 64 Therefore, where possible, we recommend collection of samples for DAT before blood transfusion.\n\nA suggested advantage of flow cytometry compared with DAT is the generation of a more quantitative result, potentially allowing monitoring of therapeutic success. Statistical associations are reported between laboratory or clinical features and the percentage of antibody\u2010positive erythrocytes.56, 58 However, the clinical value of the percentage of positive erythrocytes has not been evaluated rigorously.56\n\n\nIn dogs, spherocytes (assessed as described) can provide evidence of hemolysis, consistent with evidence of this phenomenon in human erythrocytes.65, 66 The increased rigidity of spherocytes results in entrapment within the spleen and subsequent extravascular hemolysis.28, 67, 68\n\n\nIn the absence of decreased functional hepatic mass, obstructive cholestasis, or sepsis, hyperbilirubinemia may represent evidence of hemolysis. At least 1 of the following is considered sufficient evidence for hyperbilirubinemia: icterus, total serum or plasma bilirubin concentration above reference interval, bilirubinuria in cats, or \u22652+ bilirubin on a urine reagent strip in dogs. Bilirubin reported for hemolyzed samples should be interpreted in combination with information regarding the likely impact of hemolysis on the assay.69\n\n\nHemoglobinemia can be detected by visual examination of plasma or measurement of cell\u2010free hemoglobin. When using instrument\u2010based indicators of hemolysis, limitations of the individual method should be considered. For example, spectrophotometric hemolytic indices rely on manufacturer\u2010specific methods and algorithms that are not directly comparable among different instruments.70 Similarly, discrepancy between mean cell hemoglobin concentration and cellular hemoglobin concentration provided by ADVIA hematology instruments may reflect hemolysis or other sample characteristics, such as lipemia.71\n\n\nHemoglobinemia should only be interpreted as evidence of hemolysis after eliminating artifactual hemolysis. Common causes of in vitro hemolysis include, but are not limited to, traumatic venipuncture,72, 73, 74, 75 freezing, storage, and (based on studies in humans) sampling via an IV catheter72, 76, 77 or post\u2010collection injection of samples into vacutainers.78 The likelihood of in vitro hemolysis is increased if factors that increase erythrocyte fragility are present (eg, lipemia).79 Provided causes of myoglobinuria are absent, hemoglobinuria is considered present if urine is red and discoloration is not cleared by centrifugation, or if a positive heme reaction on urine dipstick is present in the absence of intact erythrocytes on microscopic sediment examination. Assessment of hemoglobinuria should be performed using a fresh urine sample, and anecdotally the likelihood of erythrocyte lysis in urine is increased in alkaline or poorly concentrated or hyposthenuric urine samples.\n\nGhost cells provide evidence of intravascular hemolysis if seen on a smear made immediately after blood collection.3, 80\n\n\nOrganisms identified in this review with a high and an intermediate level of evidence as a cause of IMHA are likely to induce disease by a mechanism that can trigger immune\u2010mediated erythrocyte destruction in many patients. Further study is required to determine the role of other infections in IMHA. We emphasize that, for most studies, a low level of evidence represents a lack of studies designed to answer whether an infection is associated with IMHA, rather than studies that specifically demonstrated a lack of evidence. In addition, environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors play a role in whether immune\u2010mediated disease occurs in an individual patient. Therefore, clinicians should consider the possibility that any identified recent or recurrent infection may contribute to the development of IMHA. Furthermore, eliminating the possibility of infection is prudent before immunosuppressive treatment.\n\nOverall, 66 manuscripts were reviewed.3, 9, 10, 12, 27, 51, 57, 94, 95, 96, 97, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153 The IME values were calculated for 27 infectious agents or types of infection (Figures 3, 4, 5), but could not be calculated for many infectious agents either because of the way data were summarized (eg, the number of individual patients with IMHA and an infection could not be discerned) or because an individual patient with IMHA had >1 comorbidity (Supporting Information S2). In addition, most investigators did not specifically ask whether infection causes IMHA. Consensus Summary Statements are presented here for all genera of organisms for which at least 1 study had an intermediate or higher level of evidence that infection induced IMHA. All additional organisms are discussed in Supporting Information S5.\n\nSeventeen studies documented 103 cases of IMHA in Babesia\u2010infected dogs.57, 93, 94, 95, 96, 99, 102, 103, 104, 111, 120, 122, 128, 134, 141, 147, 151 The IME values for Babesia species as a whole ranged from 0.00 to 6.99, with a median of 4.55. Fifty\u2010three percent (10/19) of the IME values demonstrated an intermediate or high level of evidence that Babesia causes IMHA. For 3 additional studies, the number of dogs with Babesia and IMHA could not be determined.105, 125, 136\n\n\nThere is a high level of evidence that immune\u2010mediated destruction of erythrocytes contributes to anemia in dogs infected with B. gibsoni. Immune\u2010mediated hemolytic anemia was documented in 69 dogs in 9 studies,93, 94, 95, 96, 99, 102, 103, 111, 151 with an additional study (in which the number of infected dogs with IMHA could not be determined) providing useful mechanistic insight.125 The median IME value was 5.32, ranging from 2.54 to 6.99. For this Babesia species, 88% (8/9) of the studies showed intermediate (4) or high (4) IME values. Four were studies of dogs experimentally infected with B. gibsoni, yielding a median IME value of 6.41 and range of 6.08\u20106.99.94, 95, 96, 99 Natural infection with B. gibsoni occurs most commonly in fighting breeds.102, 125 However, mixed breed dogs used in experimental studies also develop IMHA, suggesting that the immune\u2010mediated pathogenesis is largely driven by the parasite.99\n\n\nWhether other species of Babesia cause IMHA in dogs remains unclear. One study documented IMHA in 2 chronically infected splenectomized mixed breed dogs experimentally infected with what was thought to be B. gibsoni, but later characterized as Babesia conradae,147 yielding an IME value of 6.25. Five studies documented 13 cases of IMHA in dogs infected with Babesia canis, with a median IME value of 3.20 and range of 0\u20104.32.57, 104, 111, 128, 134\nBabesia vogeli was documented in 2 studies of 5 dogs with IMHA, with IME values of 5.73 and 4.14. Five cases of IMHA were documented in a study of Babesia rossi\u2010infected dogs, although the authors presumed a Babesia species based on cytological examination of blood smears and geographic locale.120 The IME value was 2.56. In an additional study, the Babesia species was not specified, but again was likely to be B. rossi.122 Nine dogs with IMHA were documented in that study, with an IME value of 2.70. Thus, the evidence for large Babesia species causing IMHA is lower than that for B. gibsoni, attributed in part to the fact that most studies were not designed to determine if an association between IMHA and infection existed. Nevertheless, differences also may exist in pathogenicity among Babesia species that influence the risk of IMHA. For example, 1 study found that the majority of anemic B. vogeli\u2010infected dogs had IgM and IgG bound to erythrocytes, but these antibodies were not detected in dogs infected with B. canis.57 In this study, eccentrocytosis, suggesting oxidative damage, was more common in B. canis\u2010infected dogs. The IME value for B. canis in this study was 0, whereas it was 5.73 for B. vogeli.57\n\n\nThe mechanism of immune\u2010mediated erythrocyte destruction during B. gibsoni infection has been explored. Because Babesia species infect erythrocytes, antibodies appropriately targeting the organisms could result in \u201cimmune\u2010mediated\u201d erythrocyte destruction without targeting self\u2010antigen. However, antibodies produced during infection also appear to target erythrocyte membranes. Oxidative injury may play a role in anti\u2010erythrocyte antibody formation.96 Activated macrophages cause oxidative damage to uninfected as well as infected erythrocytes during B. gibsoni infection, a factor that may contribute to the severity of IMHA in some dogs.96 In addition to oxidative damage, sialic acid residue removal is required to expose epitopes that are targeted by antibody.94 Interestingly, anti\u2010erythrocyte antibodies that developed in dogs experimentally infected with B. gibsoni did not attach to undamaged red blood cells in dogs that had recovered from clinical infection.93 Furthermore, in vitro studies have shown that Babesia\u2010induced antibody reactivity against erythrocytes is higher for aged and oxidized than for fresh erythrocytes.95 Taken together, these data suggest that ongoing damage to the red cell membrane and increased exposure of epitopes that are usually \u201chidden\u201d facilitates immune\u2010mediated erythrocyte destruction. Once infection is controlled, the drive for immune\u2010mediated destruction stops.\n\nLike Babesia species, Rangelia and Theileria species are protozoan parasites that infect erythrocytes in dogs. A study of dogs experimentally infected with Rangelia vitelli demonstrated that a regenerative anemia suspicious for IMHA developed in infected dogs.149 Treatment of infection resolved the anemia without immunosuppression. A retrospective case series of dogs naturally infected with Theileria spp. developed IMHA.137 Dogs were treated with combined immunosuppression and imidocarb dipropionate. The authors reported resolution of hematological abnormalities during an unspecified study period. The IME values could not be calculated, because the total number of dogs with IMHA could not be discerned.\n\nThe evidence that piroplasms, and in particular B. gibsoni, cause IMHA is intermediate to high. For B. gibsoni, evidence suggests that during infection, antibodies target host erythrocyte antigens exposed as a consequence of transient oxidative damage or sialic acid residue removal. Further study is needed to determine if differences in pathogenicity among species, host factors, or both mediate risk of development of IMHA in infected dogs. What is known about the mechanism of erythrocyte destruction suggests that immunosuppression should not be necessary to resolve immune\u2010mediated erythrocyte destruction in most cases.\n\nNine dogs with IMHA in 5 studies were infected with, or exposed to, Anaplasma phagocytophilum.101, 108, 126, 129, 150 The median IME value was 3.53, with a range of 2.62\u20104.25. In addition to IMHA, platelet\u2010bound antibodies were documented in some dogs with concurrent thrombocytopenia.101, 108 Although most dogs in these reports were treated concurrently with doxycycline and immunosuppressive corticosteroid treatment, 1 dog responded to doxycycline treatment alone,150 whereas another dog had prednisone discontinued after 2 days.108 One retrospective case series documented 2 dogs with acute Anaplasma platys infections with concurrent IMHA.100 Both dogs had spherocytosis and positive saline agglutination and Coombs' test results supporting the diagnosis of IMHA. The IME value for this study was 3.76.\n\nThe evidence that A. phagocytophilum causes IMHA is low. However, most studies reporting A. phagocytophilum in dogs with IMHA were limited to case reports or retrospective studies, and were not designed to investigate a causal relationship. The presence of IMHA and other immune\u2010mediated conditions concurrent with this infection suggests that prospective controlled studies to examine a possible causal relationship between A. phagocytophilum and IMHA in dogs are warranted. The evidence that A. platys induces IMHA in dogs is low, but data are limited to a single retrospective case series. Further prospective, controlled studies are required to document a possible causal relationship between A. platys and IMHA in dogs.\n\nEvidence that other vector\u2010borne agents (including Dirofilaria immitis, Ehrlichia spp. Borrelia spp., hemotropic Mycoplasma spp., Bartonella spp., and Leishmania infantum), non\u2010vector\u2010borne protozoal pathogens (including Neospora caninum), and other bacterial infections induce IMHA was negligible to low (Figure 4), or could not be quantified based on how results were reported (Supporting Information S5).105, 109, 125, 137, 145 For some of these organisms, such as Leishmania spp., D. immitis, and Bartonella spp., Coombs' test\u2010positive anemia is observed commonly with infection.105, 109, 145 Therefore, from a clinical perspective, it is still important to eliminate infection with these agents in a dog in which IMHA is a differential diagnosis.\n\nImmune\u2010mediated hemolytic anemia was documented in 9 of 56 cats infected with B. felis in 1 study from South Africa. Six of the 9 cats were coinfected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV).138 Treatment for B. felis without immunosuppression resolved IMHA, yielding an IME value of 4.98.\n\nAlthough studies are limited, an intermediate level of evidence was found that B. felis causes IMHA in cats, and that treatment resolves IMHA without immunosuppression.\n\nSeven studies documenting IMHA in 21 cats infected with hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. yielded IME values.3, 51, 97, 110, 130, 140, 153 The median IME value was 2.37, but values differed widely among hemotropic Mycoplasma species, ranging from 0 to 6.78. Overall, a high level of evidence exists for M. haemofelis inducing IMHA in cats. Immune\u2010mediated hemolytic anemia was documented in 15 cats in 3 studies for this species.3, 97, 140 The median IME value was 6.10, with a range of 2.37\u20106.78. Two of the 3 studies provided high evidence97, 140; the other study was not designed to answer whether infection causes IMHA.3 In a study of cats experimentally infected with M. haemofelis, severe macrocytic Coombs' test\u2010positive anemia and persistent autoagglutination of erythrocytes developed. In contrast, these findings did not occur when cats were infected with the less pathogenic Candidatus (Ca.) Mycoplasma haemominutum and Ca. Mycoplasma turicensis species.140 The target of anti\u2010erythrocyte antibody that develops during M. haemofelis infection in cats was investigated in 1 study.97 Serum from cats infected with M. haemofelis agglutinated infected and neuraminidase\u2010treated erythrocytes but not normal erythrocytes, suggesting that, as in babesiosis, damage to erythrocytes and unmasking of antigens contribute to the pathogenesis of IMHA.97\nCa. M. haemominutum infection was documented in 3 cats with IMHA over 4 studies (1 study showing no association with IMHA),3, 51, 130, 140 yielding a median IME value of 2.16 and range of 0\u20104.2.\n\nA high level of evidence was found that M. haemofelis causes IMHA in cats. Negligible to low level of evidence was found that the less pathogenic species Ca. M. haemominutum causes IMHA, and no evidence was found that Ca. M. turicensis induces IMHA. Whether coinfection and host immune status play roles in development of IMHA in cats infected with different hemotropic Mycoplasma species requires further study.\n\nSeven studies meeting inclusion criteria were identified.3, 9, 110, 119, 138, 153, 154 However, other comorbidities such as erythroleukemia, myeloproliferative disease, chronic interstitial nephritis, glomerulonephritis and splenic amyloidosis, and drug administration were documented in some infected cats, precluding IME calculation.110, 138, 153, 154 The median IME value for the others was 3.77, with a range of 1.87\u20105.04.3, 9, 110, 119, 153, 154\n\n\nCollectively, the evidence that FeLV infection induces IMHA is low. The observation that some FeLV\u2010positive cats also have Coombs' test\u2010positive anemia should prompt further investigation into whether immune\u2010mediated erythrocyte destruction can contribute to anemia in FeLV\u2010positive cats.\n\nSummaries of the evidence for other infections that have been documented in cats with IMHA, including FIP, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), L. infantum, Mycoplasma gatae, M. haemofelis, soft tissue infection, and urinary tract infection are provided in Supporting Information S6.\n\nEvidence of a causal link between cancer and IMHA in dogs currently is lacking in the veterinary literature, largely reflecting the fact that the majority of the published studies did not specifically ask whether cancer was associated with IMHA in dogs. Further studies are needed to determine if such an association exists. Although no evidence for a causal link exists, cancer cannot be eliminated as a potential trigger for this disease.\n\nEight cats for which an IME value could be calculated for lymphoma and IMHA were identified.3, 9, 164 Two of the 3 studies reporting these cases did not demonstrate a causal association between IMHA and lymphoma,3, 9 and 1 study was considered to partially report or suggest causality.164 The latter reports 2 sibling specific pathogen\u2010free experimental cats. For both cats, lymphoma/lymphocytic leukemia was diagnosed on histological review after necropsy. However, interpretation of the histology in both cats was equivocal. The histological pattern was described as multicentric T\u2010lymphoblastic infiltration with associated B\u2010lymphocyte proliferation, which the authors concluded was most likely a lymphoproliferative disorder, but they did not eliminate an aberrant immune response. For 1 cat, the diagnosis of lymphoma/lymphocytic leukemia was made within 3 weeks of the onset of IMHA, and no other potential trigger for secondary IMHA was described. For the second cat, 2 episodes of IMHA were described, 1 potentially associated with an experimental herpes virus infection and the other potentially associated with experimental FeLV infection. For the other 2 studies, neither the method of diagnosis nor the subtype of lymphoma was specified. The evidence for a causal association between IMHA and lymphoma is low, with a median IME value of 3.54 and a range of 1.87\u20104.24.\n\nA single cat with multiple myeloma and IMHA was identified.3 This study did not show a causal association between neoplasia and IMHA, and the method of diagnosis of neoplasia was unclear. The evidence for an association between IMHA and multiple myeloma was negligible, with an IME value of 1.70.\n\nThree cats with erythroleukemia3, 153 and 3 cats with non\u2010specified myeloproliferative disease110 and IMHA were identified. No study demonstrated a causal association between IMHA and neoplasia. The report of 2 of the cats with erythroleukemia suggests that diagnosis was based on bone marrow cytological or histological review, or both.3 The method of diagnosis of neoplasia was not described for the third cat with erythroleukemia.153 For the cats with non\u2010specified myeloproliferative disease, the diagnosis was based on bone marrow examination, but details are limited.110 All cats with non\u2010specified myeloproliferative disease were FeLV positive.110 The evidence for a causal association between erythroleukemia and IMHA is negligible, with an IME value for the 1 study in which it could be assigned of 1.87.3 Other studies of erythroleukemia or unspecified myeloproliferarative disease did not yield IME values because of the presence of comorbidities.\n\nA single cat with histiocytic sarcoma and IMHA was identified.3 This study did not show a causal association between IMHA and neoplasia, and the method of diagnosis of neoplasia was not described, yielding an IME value of 1.70.\n\nA single case of pancreatic carcinoma110 and a single case of anaplastic sarcoma3 with giant cells in cats with IMHA were identified. Neither study showed a causal association between IMHA and neoplasia. The evidence for a causal association between IMHA and carcinoma, and sarcoma, was negligible, with an IME value of 1.70 in each case.\n\nOne cat with IMHA and uncharacterized gastrointestinal neoplasia51 and 6 cats with IMHA and uncharacterized masses3 were identified. A causal association between IMHA and these lesions was not identified. The method of diagnosis for the presumed neoplastic lesions was not described. The evidence for a causal association between IMHA and uncharacterized gastrointestinal neoplasia is low, with an IME value of 3.92, and negligible for uncharacterized masses, with an IME value of 2.04.\n\nCurrently, no strong evidence exists for a causal link between cancer and IMHA in cats; further studies are needed to determine if such an association exists. Nevertheless, retrospective evidence suggests a relatively high prevalence of concurrent cancer in cats with IMHA.\n\nThe evidence for pancreatitis causing IMHA is negligible in dogs and negligible to low in cats. Additional studies would be required to establish a causal relationship.\n\nThe evidence for necrosis as a cause of IMHA is negligible in dogs and is not reported in cats.\n\nAnecdotal reports suggest that generalized inflammatory processes induce IMHA in dogs and cats, but direct evidence is lacking. Well\u2010designed studies to determine whether non\u2010infectious inflammatory processes cause IMHA are warranted.\n\nSeventeen studies described dogs with IMHA that had been exposed to drugs or toxins,1, 10, 12, 27, 34, 80, 116, 127, 135, 142, 143, 160, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172 but only 11 reported cases with sufficient primary data for the calculation of an IME value.10, 12, 27, 34, 80, 142, 143, 168, 169, 170, 172 The majority of cases (35/36) were dogs exposed to antimicrobial drugs.10, 80, 142, 143, 168, 170 For these cases, IME values ranged from 1.70 to 7.09, with a median of 1.87 (Figure 9). The highest level of evidence, with an IME value of 7.09, came from 1 unblinded, randomized, prospective clinical trial in which 6 of 14 dogs given escalating doses of cefazedone acquired anti\u2010erythrocyte antibodies.168 The remaining reported cases were associated with low or negligible evidence to support other drugs or toxins as a cause for IMHA in dogs (Figure 9).\n\nThe prevalence of drug\u2010induced IMHA in dogs and cats is either rare or underreported. However, a lack of evidence does not preclude the possibility of a drug or toxin triggering IMHA.\n\nConsidering the wide practice of vaccination and lack of conclusive evidence of an association with IMHA, current vaccination strategies generally are safe. Patients should be individually assessed for their own risks and benefits before vaccination. Further studies are needed to determine if and when vaccine\u2010associated IMHA occurs in dogs and cats, and to develop better methods for the diagnosis of vaccine\u2010associated disease.\n\nA thorough history documenting vaccination, travel, exposure to fleas and ticks, flea and tick prevention, and heartworm testing and prevention is recommended. A thorough physical examination including retinal examination should be performed. Laboratory screening should include a CBC, blood film examination by a board\u2010certified clinical pathologist (or equivalently trained hematologist), serum biochemical profile, and routine urinalysis. Urine culture and fecal flotation with centrifugation also should be considered. Abdominal radiographs are important to eliminate hemolysis caused by zinc toxicity. Imaging and other diagnostic tests to screen for cancer remain a reasonable component of a diagnostic evaluation for IMHA in dogs and cats, performed at the discretion of the attending clinician on the basis of the likelihood of cancer in the individual patient. Routine testing for pancreatitis in dogs and cats with IMHA is not recommended, unless clinical presentation suggests that it is a credible differential diagnosis.\n\nHistory will help assess the likely risk of certain infections. A thorough physical examination and diagnostic imaging will help identify any potential nidus of infection or the presence of neoplastic lesions. Patterns of abnormalities identified on the CBC, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis can increase the index of suspicion for specific infectious agents that may be associated with IMHA.193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202 This minimum database also can identify additional pathological processes (eg, proteinuria) that may require specific treatment. Although insensitive, blood smear examination can be useful in identifying the presence of vector\u2010borne disease agents. Although the evidence associated with urinary tract infection as a cause of IMHA is negligible, identification and treatment of infection before immunosuppression is prudent. We refer the reader to the ACVIM consensus statement on the treatment of IMHA (in press) for further recommendations and additional discussion on the specific circumstance of treating subclinical bacteriuria in an immunosuppressed patient. The evidence that gastrointestinal parasites cause IMHA in dogs is low, but rapid resolution of IMHA with treatment and minimal immunosuppression has been described (Supporting Information S5).121 Imaging will help identify neoplasia or a nidus of infection.\n\nDogs with IMHA should be screened for infection with Babesia spp. using combined testing with serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Repeat testing by means of PCR should be performed in all dogs originally testing negative but with a high risk of infection based on breed or exposure risk. The sensitivity of PCR and serological testing may vary depending on the laboratory and test design. Infection with other piroplasms, including Rangelia and Theileria species, should be eliminated in endemic areas. Because D. immitis infection is associated with anemia and positive Coombs' test results, all dogs should be screened for D. immitis in endemic areas or when travel to such areas has occurred. Further study to determine how and if other vector\u2010borne disease agents cause IMHA is required before definitive screening recommendations can be made for additional organisms. However, screening for additional vector\u2010borne pathogens, in particular Anaplasma spp., Bartonella spp., Ehrlichia spp., and, in endemic areas, Leishmania spp., should be strongly considered. Potential foci of other infections identified during initial screening should be further investigated at the discretion of the attending clinician.\n\nThe evidence that Babesia spp. induce IMHA is intermediate to high. Infection with B. gibsoni should be ruled out. Transmission of B. gibsoni in fighting breeds is through bite wounds and vertical transmission.102, 203 However, tick transmission by Haemaphysalis spp. and possibly Rhipicephalus sanguineus can occur, and experimental infection of mixed breed dogs results in IMHA.99, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208 Therefore, screening for B. gibsoni in all breeds with IMHA is prudent. B. vogeli should be ruled out in dogs with a history of exposure to R. sanguineus. Retired racing Greyhound dogs are at increased risk of infection because of the common occurrence of R. sanguineus infestations in racing kennels.102, 193, 209 Testing for B. canis and B. rossi by means of serology and PCR should be performed in endemic areas. Dogs living in California and Coyote hunting dogs specifically should be screened for B. conradae by means of PCR (no serological test is available).210, 211 Although evidence of causation is lacking, Coombs' test\u2010positive anemia is commonly documented in dogs with heartworm disease, bartonellosis, and leishmaniosis (Supporting Information S5).105, 109, 145 General principles for optimal use of serology and PCR in diagnosing vector\u2010borne disease are summarized in Supporting Information S7. Generally, combining PCR with serological testing enhances sensitivity.212, 213, 214 Repeat testing, including repeating PCR on the same or additional samples, and pairwise serological testing to demonstrate a 4\u2010fold change between acute and convalescent titers, also are necessary to document infection in many cases.212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217\n\n\nPolymerase chain reaction testing for B. felis should be performed in cats from endemic areas and in those with suggestive clinical signs. Serological testing was not available at the time of writing, but combined testing would be optimal based on studies of Babesia species infecting dogs. Polymerase chain reaction testing for M. haemofelis should be performed in all cats with IMHA. Further studies are needed to determine whether infection with other hemotropic Mycoplasma species is associated with IMHA in immunosuppressed or coinfected cats. Testing for all 3 species is preferred when possible. All sick cats should be tested for FeLV and FIV infection, according to American Association of Feline Practitioners retrovirus management guidelines (https://www.catvets.com/guidelines/practice-guidelines/retrovirus-management-guidelines), screening all cats with IMHA for FeLV using antigen ELISA. Proviral FeLV DNA quantitative PCR testing may be helpful as a confirmatory test. Routine testing for feline coronavirus and non\u2010hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. in cats with IMHA is not recommended, but appropriate diagnostic tests should be considered in cats with compatible clinical signs.\n\nIdentification of Babesia spp. by light microscopy of blood smears is considered insensitive for screening in cats. Polymerase chain reaction to identify parasitic DNA or RNA is recommended.218 A high level of evidence was found that M. haemofelis causes IMHA in cats. Coinfection and host immune status may play a role in the development of IMHA in cats infected with the less pathogenic hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. In addition, coinfection with multiple hemotropic Mycoplasma species is common.51, 144 Therefore, infection with a less pathogenic species may signal that repeat testing for M. haemofelis is warranted. Non\u2010hemotropic Mycoplasma infection only has been described in 1 cat with IMHA.148 However, M. pneumoniae causes cold agglutinin hemolytic anemia in people, and infection with Mycoplasma cynos was associated with development of cold agglutinins in a dog.135 Therefore, it should be considered as a possible trigger in cats with IMHA and other findings compatible with infection. The evidence for FeLV in association with IMHA in cats is negligible to intermediate. Polymerase chain reaction testing for proviral DNA could be considered as part of infectious disease screening. The overall evidence that FIP induces IMHA is negligible. However, given the immune mechanisms underlying effusive FIP, testing for FIP in cats with compatible clinical and laboratory findings is judicious.\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend withholding necessary medications for dogs and cats with IMHA. However, all medications, particularly those previously implicated in immune\u2010mediated diseases, should be used with caution in patients with IMHA. Every patient should ideally have a complete history recorded, which includes all vaccines and drugs administered, the doses, dates, frequency, duration, and route of their administration, and information about the products being used such as manufacturer, indications, specific lot, and any adverse events. Exposure to toxins should also be documented in any dog or cat with IMHA.\n\nEvidence for cefazedone in dogs168 and propylthiouracil in cats173, 174 suggests that >1 class of drugs may be associated with IMHA in small animals. For most commonly prescribed medications, the evidence is negligible. Specific documentation of vaccine histories and long\u2010term prospective studies may help determine whether vaccines can trigger IMHA. To date, approximately 8% of dogs with a diagnosis of IMHA and vaccination histories had been vaccinated within 30 days of IMHA diagnosis. However, studies comparing this prevalence to adequate controls are limited and inconclusive. Animals with IMHA are at risk for recurrence of anemia, making careful decisions about the risks and benefits of revaccinating important in every case. Animals receiving immunosuppressive treatment are less likely to mount protective immunity after routine vaccination.\n\nBased on the data analyzed here, we propose a unified model for the pathogenesis of IMHA and a new system of nomenclature, in which the disease is categorized as \u201cnon\u2010associative\u201d and \u201cassociative\u201d rather than \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary,\u201d respectively (Figure 10A,B). This clarification is needed because the word \u201cprimary\u201d implies that all triggers have been definitively ruled out, whereas \u201csecondary\u201d implies causation. We propose that the term \u201cassociative\u201d be used when a comorbidity is identified. In some cases, the comorbidity might have caused the IMHA (secondary IMHA), whereas in others it might be coincidental (primary IMHA). \u201cNon\u2010associative\u201d IMHA cases are those in which comorbidities are not identified in the diagnostic evaluation, and include primary (\u201cidiopathic\u201d) and cryptogenic cases. The latter implies that an underlying cause was not identified, perhaps because the underlying pathomechanisms are not currently understood, or the comorbidity could not be detected using available testing.\n\nWhen the VCCIS task forces were formed, we began by identifying a focused question that represented an important problem in veterinary immunology, namely \u201cWhat is the evidence that infection, neoplasia, drugs, vaccines, and other comorbidities cause IMHA in dogs and cats?\u201d Our original intent was to perform a systematic review of the literature to answer this question. However, it quickly became apparent that very few studies in the veterinary literature were designed to determine if a given comorbidity causes IMHA, hence an expanded approach was used to evaluate the evidence presented in our review. There is a critical need for well\u2010designed, prospective, case\u2010controlled clinical studies that directly ask the question of whether infections, neoplasia, drugs, and vaccines cause IMHA. Some comorbidities are likely to cause IMHA in a large number of affected patients, such as an infection that expresses an epitope mimicking an erythrocyte antigen widely expressed in a population, or an organism that causes transient expression of normally hidden epitopes. Others might induce IMHA only in patients with epigenetic and genetic predisposition, or a given inflammatory context. Studies that investigate how individual comorbidities trigger IMHA, and the role of genetics and epigenetics, will help identify what diseases to screen for in all patients, and what diseases to screen for in selected patients that may be at increased risk of developing IMHA from any trigger. Mechanistic studies also will determine which comorbidities, when treated, will lead to resolution of IMHA without the need for immunosuppression. Stringent criteria for the diagnosis of IMHA and definitive diagnosis of a comorbidity must be integrated into study design in order to make meaningful observations.\n\nJonathan Fogle has been paid by Merial for speaking engagements and continuing education.
