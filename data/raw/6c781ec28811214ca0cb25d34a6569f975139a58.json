{"title": "Cryo-electron microscopy structure of a coronavirus spike glycoprotein trimer", "body": "coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 demonstrated that these zoonotic viruses can transmit to humans from various animal species and suggested that additional emergence events are likely to occur. The fatality rate of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections are about 10-37% 1, 4 and there are no approved antiviral treatments or vaccines.\n\nCoronaviruses use S homotrimers to promote cell attachment and fusion of the viral and host membranes. S determines host range, cell tropism and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies during infection 1 . S is a class I viral fusion protein synthesized as a single chain precursor of about 1300 amino acids which trimerizes upon folding. It is composed of an Nterminal S 1 subunit, containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and a C-terminal S 2 subunit, driving membrane fusion. Cleavage by furin-like host proteases at the junction between S 1 and S 2 (S 2 cleavage site) occurs during biogenesis for some coronaviruses such as murine hepatitis virus (MHV, the prototypical and best studied coronavirus) 1, 5 . The S 1 and S 2 subunits remain non-covalently associated in the metastable pre-fusion S trimer. Upon virion uptake by target cells, a second cleavage is mediated by endo-lysosomal proteases (S 2 ' cleavage site) allowing fusion activation of coronavirus S proteins 6 .\n\nCrystal structures of coronavirus S post-fusion cores demonstrated that the fusogenic conformational changes lead to the formation of a so-called trimer of hairpins which is the hallmark of class I fusion proteins [7] [8] [9] [10] . These structures contain two heptad-repeat (HR) regions present in S 2 assembled as an extended triple helical coiled-coil motif (HR1) surrounded by three shorter helices (HR2). Crystal structures of several coronavirus S receptor-binding domains (RBD) in complex with their cognate receptors have also been reported [11] [12] [13] [14] . Finally, cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) of SARS-CoV virions provided a snapshot of the S glycoprotein at 16 \u00c5 resolution 15 . The lack of high-resolution data for any coronavirus S trimer has prevented a detailed analysis of the infection mechanisms.\n\nWe produced an MHV S ectodomain trimer with enhanced stability by mutating the S 2 cleavage site and fusing a GCN4 trimerization motif at the C-terminal end of the construct. The resulting MHV S ectodomain forms a trimer binding with high-affinity to soluble murine CEACAM1a receptor (ED Fig.1a-b) . We used state-of-the art cryoEM 16 to determine the structure of the MHV S ectodomain trimer at 4.0 \u00c5 resolution (Fig.1a -c and ED Fig.2-3) . We fitted the crystal structures of two S 1 domains 11, 13, 17 and built de novo the rest of the polypeptide chain using Coot 18 and Rosetta 19, 20 (Fig.1d-f, ED Fig.2-4 and  Supplementary Tables 1-2 ). The final model includes residues 15 to 1118 with an internal break corresponding to a loop immediately upstream from the S 2 ' cleavage site (residues 827-863). The region connecting the S 1 and S 2 subunits (residues 718-754) features weak density which correlates with its accessibility for proteolytic cleavage in vivo. Residues 453-535 were modeled by density-guided homology modeling using Rosetta due to the poor quality of the density in this region (ED Fig. 3k ).\n\nThe MHV S ectodomain is a 140 \u00c5 long trimer with a triangular cross-section varying in diameter from 70 \u00c5, at the membrane proximal base, to 140 \u00c5 at the membrane distal end (Fig.1d-e) . The structure comprises two functional subunits (Fig.2a-d) : (1) a distal moiety constituted by the S 1 subunits; (2) a central stem connecting to the viral membrane formed by the S 2 subunits. The S 1 subunit has a \"V\" shape contributing to the overall triangular appearance of the S trimer (ED Fig.5a ). The S 1 N-terminal moiety comprises domain A which is folded as a galectin-like \u03b2-sandwich decorated with extended loops on the viral membrane distal side, and a three-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet plus an \u03b1-helix on the viral membrane proximal side. The S 1 C-terminal half folds as three spatially distinct \u03b2-rich domains, termed B, C and D (Fig.2a-d) .\n\nThe S 2 subunit connects to the viral membrane and is characterized by the presence of long \u03b1-helices (Fig.2b-d and 3a) . A central helix (\u03b1 30 ) stretches 75 \u00c5 along the 3-fold molecular axis toward the viral membrane (Fig. 3a) . It is located immediately downstream the HR1 motif, which folds as four consecutive \u03b1-helices (\u03b1 26 -\u03b1 29 , Fig. 3a and ED Fig.6a-b) , in sharp contrast with the 120-\u00c5 long HR1 helix observed in the post-fusion S structures 7-9 (ED Fig.6c-e) . The 55 \u00c5-long upstream helix (\u03b1 20 ), so named because it is located immediately upstream the S 2 ' cleavage site, runs parallel to and is zipped against the central helix via hydrophobic contacts largely following a heptad-repeat pattern. A core antiparallel \u03b2-sheet (\u03b2 46 -\u03b2 49 -\u03b2 50 ) is present at the viral membrane proximal end and is assembled from an N-terminal \u03b2-strand (\u03b2 46 ), preceding the upstream helix, and a C-terminal \u03b2-hairpin (\u03b2 49\u03b2 50 ), located downstream the central helix.\n\nMHV S 2 features a topology similar to the paramyxovirus F proteins (such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F: rmsd 4\u00c5 over 125 residues) with a comparable 3D organization of the core \u03b2-sheet, the upstream helix and the central helix ( Fig. 3a-b) . Importantly, these motifs were shown to remain invariant in the pre-and post-fusion F structures 2,3 . The conservation of these motifs among coronavirus S and paramyxovirus F proteins suggests these fusion proteins have evolved from a distant common ancestor. Although the density is too weak to trace the polypeptide chain downstream from \u03b2 50 , secondary structure predictions suggest that the domain directly preceding HR2 could adopt a similar fold in coronavirus S and paramyxovirus F proteins.\n\nIn the S trimer, the three central helices are packed via their central portions whereas the two ends splay away from the 3-fold axis (ED Fig.7a -c). Additional contacts between the upstream and central helices participate to inter-protomer interactions. Furthermore, the S 1 subunits interlock to form a crown around the S 2 trimer stabilizing it in the pre-fusion conformation ( Fig.3c -d and Supplementary Table 3 ). This is illustrated by the large surface area buried at the interface between each S 1 subunit and the S 2 subunits of the three protomers (1,970 \u00c5 2 ). Many of these contacts involve the HR1 helices and the fusion peptide region. These polypeptide segments undergo major refolding during the fusogenic conformational changes (ED Fig.6a -e) which supports the notion that the S 1 subunits maintain the S 2 fusion machinery in its metastable state. Substitutions of the conserved alanine 994 by valine in helix \u03b1 28 or of the conserved leucine 1062 by phenylalanine in the central helix were shown to attenuate fusogenicity 21, 22 . Our structure suggests that the former substitution would strengthen hydrophobic packing against the core \u03b2-sheet (ED Fig.  7b ) and that the later substitution could reinforce molecular stapling of the central helices (ED Fig.7a,c) . The expected modification of the energy landscape between pre-fusion and post-fusion conformations would explain the reduction of fusion activity of these mutants 21, 22 .\n\nThe predicted fusion peptide includes the C-terminal half of helix \u03b1 21 and extends up to the N-terminal half of \u03b1 22 6,23 (Fig. 2c) . \u03b1 21 is an amphipathic helix located at the periphery of the S trimer, burying hydrophobic side chains toward the S 2 center and exposing charged residues to solvent ( Fig.2c and ED Fig.7b-c) . In the case of porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus, trypsin processing at the S 2 ' site can only occur after host cell attachment 24 . This indicates that receptor binding could allosterically increase the accessibility of the S 2 ' site which is located within helix \u03b1 21 . The acidic pH of the endo-lysosomes could also contribute to exposing the S 2 ' cleavage site for coronaviruses requiring cleavage in this compartment. The fact that helix \u03b1 21 appears dynamic and is found immediately downstream from a disordered loop suggests that it could undergo considerable \"breathing\" motions. Regardless of the mechanism promoting cleavage, the MHV S structure reported here explains the requirement for processing at the S 2 ' site, as it frees the fusion peptide from the S 2 N-terminal region which is a prerequisite for its insertion ~200 \u00c5 away in the target membrane. The peripheral position of the fusion peptide is similar to what has been observed in the parainfluenza virus 5 F 3 and HIV gp41 25 prefusion structures (ED Fig.8a -c).\n\nThe striking accessibility of the fusion peptide and its sequence conservation among coronaviruses 6,23 suggest it would be an ideal target for epitope-focused vaccinology initiatives aimed at raising broadly neutralizing antibodies against S glycoproteins ( Fig.4a -c and ED Fig.9 ). Major antigenic determinants (inducing neutralizing antibodies) of MHV and SARS-CoV S proteins overlap with the fusion peptide region and support the suitability of this approach 26, 27 . Antibodies binding to this site will not only hinder insertion of the fusion peptide into the target membrane, but also will putatively prevent fusogenic conformational changes. This epitope-focused strategy has proven successful to obtain neutralizing antibodies against RSV F 28 .\n\nThe spatial proximity of domains A and B in the S trimer allows rationalization of their alternate use among coronaviruses to interact with host receptors. MHV uses the viral membrane distal loops decorating domain A to interact with CEACAM1a 13 whereas MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV rely on the \u03b2-motif protruding from domain B to bind to DPP4 11 or ACE2 12,14 , respectively (ED Fig 5a-d) . The poor sequence conservation of the B domain \u03b2motif among coronavirus S proteins, its significant length variation among MHV strains (ED Fig.9 ) and our density-guided homology model of this motif indicate structural and functional differences. These structural variations constitute the molecular basis underlying coronavirus species specificity and cell tropism using a single S architectural scaffold.\n\nSequence comparisons indicate that the MHV spike S 1 and S 2 subunits respectively share ~25% and ~40% sequence similarity with many other coronavirus S proteins (ED Fig.9 ). Therefore, the structure reported in this manuscript is representative of the architecture of other coronavirus S such as those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. This hypothesis is further supported by the structural similarity of (1) the MHV 13 Our results now provide a framework to understand coronavirus entry and suggest ways for preventing or treating future coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nA human codon-optimized gene encoding the MHV spike gene (UniProt: P11224) was synthesized with a R717S amino acid mutation to abolish the furin cleavage site at the S 1 -S 2 junction (S 2 cleavage site). From this gene, the fragment encoding the MHV ectodomain (residues 15-1231) was PCR-amplified and ligated to a gene fragment encoding a GCN4 trimerization motif (IKRMKQIEDKIEEIESKQKKIENEIARIKKIK) 3 \n\n293-F cells were grown in suspension using FreeStyle\u2122 293 Expression Medium (Life technologies) at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator on a Celltron shaker platform (Infors HT) rotating at 130 rpm (for 1 L culture flasks). Twenty-four hours before transfection, cell density was adjusted at 1.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml, and culture grown overnight in the same conditions as mentioned above to reach ~ 2.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml the day of transfection. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1250 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in fresh FreeStyle\u2122 293 Expression Medium (Life technologies) without antibiotics at a density of 2.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml.\n\nTo produce recombinant CEACAM1a ectodomain, 400 \u03bcg of pCD5-MHVR-T-Fc vector (purified using EndoFree plasmid kit from Qiagen) were added to 200 ml of suspension cells. The cultures were swirled 5 min on shaker in the culture incubator before adding 9 \u03bcg/ml of Linear polyethylenimine (PEI) solution (25 kDa, Polysciences). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were diluted 1:1 with FreeStyle\u2122 293 Expression Medium and the transfected cells were cultivated for 6 days. Clarified cell supernatants were concentrated 10fold using Vivaflow tangential filtration cassettes (Sartorius, 10 kDa cutoff) before affinity purification using a Protein A column (GE LifeSciences) followed by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl. The Fc tag was removed by trypsin cleavage in a reaction mixture containing 7 mg of recombinant CEACAM1a ectodomain and 5 \u03bcg of trypsin in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 20 mM CaCl 2 . The reaction mixture was incubated at 25\u00b0C overnight and re-loaded in a Protein A column to remove uncleaved protein and the F C tag. The cleaved protein was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 75 column 10/300 GL (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl. The purified protein was quantified using absorption at 280 nm and concentrated to approximately 10 mg/mL. For large-scale production of MHV S ectodomain the cells were cultured in spinner flasks and induced by 5 \u03bcM of CdCl 2 at a density of approximately 10 7 cells per mL. After a week at 28 \u00b0C clarified cell supernatants were concentrated 40-fold using Vivaflow tangential filtration cassettes (Sartorius, 10 kDa cutoff) and adjusted to pH 8.0, before affinity purification using StrepTactin Superflow column (IBA) followed by gel filtration chromatography using Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl. The purified protein was quantified using absorption at 280 nm and concentrated to approximately 4 mg/mL.\n\nFor size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis, samples (0.2 mL at 1mg/mL) were loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Life Sciences, 0.4 mL/min in gel filtration buffer) and passed through a Wyatt DAWN Heleos II EOS 18-angle laser photometer coupled to a Wyatt Optilab TrEX differential refractive index detector. Data were analyzed using Astra 6 software (Wyatt Technology Corp., CA, USA).\n\nSolution MST binding studies were performed using standard protocols on a Monolith NT. 115 (Nanotemper Technologies). Briefly, recombinant CEACAM1a ectodomain protein was labeled using the RED-NHS (Amine Reactive) Protein Labelling Kit (Nanotemper Technologies). The MHV S ectodomain protein was serially diluted in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and the labeled recombinant CEACAM1a was added to a final concentration of 500 nM before overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C. The CEACAM1a concentration was chosen such that the observed fluorescence was approximately 1000 units at 40% LED power. The samples were loaded into standard-treated Monolith TM capillaries and were measured by standard protocols using a Monolith NT.115, NanoTemper (Munich, Germany). The changes of the fluorescent thermophoresis signal were plotted against the concentration of the serially diluted MHV spike protein and K D values were determined using the NanoTemper analysis software.\n\nThree microliters of MHV spike at 1.85 mg/mL were applied to a 1.2/1.3 C-flat grid (Protochips), which had been glow-discharged for 30s at 20mA. Thereafter, grids were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Gatan CP3 and a blotting time of 3.5 s. Data was acquired using an FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct detector. Coma-free alignment was performed using the Leginon software 33 . Automated data collection was carried out using Leginon 34 to control both the FEI Titan Krios (used in microprobe mode at a nominal magnification of 22,500 \u00d7) and the Gatan K2 Summit operated in counted mode (pixel size: 1.315 \u00c5) at a dose rate of ~9 counts/physical pixel/s which corresponds to ~12 electrons/physical pixels/s (when accounting for coincidence loss 35 ) . Each movie had a total accumulated exposure of 53 e/\u00c5 2 fractionated in 38 frames of 200 ms (yielding movies of 7.6 s). A dataset of ~1600 micrographs was acquired in a single session using a defocus range comprised between 2.0 and 5.0 \u03bcm.\n\nWhole frame alignment was carried out using the software developed by Li et al 35 , which is integrated into the Appion pipeline 36 , to account for stage drift and beam-induced motion. The parameters of the microscope contrast transfer function were estimated for each micrograph using ctffind3 37 . Micrographs were manually masked using Appion to exclude the visible carbon supporting film for further processing. Particles were automatically picked in a reference-free manner using DogPicker 38 . Extraction of particle images was performed using Relion 1.4 with a box size of 320 pixels 2 and applying a windowing operation in Fourier space to yield a final box size of 288 pixels 2 (corresponding to a pixel size of 1.46 \u00c5). From the 1.2 million particles initially picked, a subset of 50,000 particles were randomly selected to generate class averages using RELION 39 . An initial 3D model was generated using OPTIMOD 40 within the Appion pipeline. The entire data set was subjected to 2D alignment and clustering using RELION and particles belonging to the best-defined class averages were retained (~500,000 particles). These ~500,000 particles were then subjected to RELION 3D classification with 4 classes (using c1 symmetry) starting with our initial model low-pass filtered to 40\u00c5 resolution. We subsequently used the ~230,000 best particles (selected from the 3D classification) and the map corresponding to the best 3D class (low-pass filtered at 40 \u00c5 resolution) to run Relion 3D auto-refine (c3 symmetry) which led to a reconstruction at 4.4 \u00c5 resolution. We utilized the particle polishing procedure in RELION 1.4 to correct for individual particle movement and radiation damage 41, 42 . A second round of 3D classification with 6 classes (c3 symmetry) was performed using the polished particles resulting in the selection of 82,000 particles. A new 3D auto-refine run (c3 symmetry) using the selected 82,000 particles and the map corresponding to the best 3D class (low-pass filtered at 40 \u00c5 resolution) yielded a map at 4.0 \u00c5 resolution following post processing in RELION. The final map was sharpened with an empirically determined B factor of \u2212220 \u00c5 2 using Relion post processing. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard FSC=0.143 criterion 43 and Fourier shell correction curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution 44 . The soft mask used for FSC calculation had a 10 pixel cosine edge fall-off. The overall shape and dimensions of our reconstruction agree with previous data although the HR2 stem connecting to the membrane is not resolved 15 .\n\nFitting of atomic models into cryoEM maps was performed using UCSF Chimera 45 and Coot 18, 46 . We initially docked the MHV domain A structure (PDB 3R4D) and used a crystal structure of a bovine coronavirus domain A (PDB 4H14) to model the three-stranded \u03b2-sheet and the \u03b1-helix present on the viral membrane proximal side of the galectin-like domain. Next, the MERS-CoV domain B crystal structure (PDB 4KQZ) was also fit into the density, and rebuilt and refined using RosettaCM 47 . Although we could accurately align the sequences corresponding to the core \u03b2-sheet of the MHV and MERS-CoV B domains, the ~100 residues forming the \u03b2-motif extension (residues 453-535, MERS-CoV/SARS-CoV receptor-binding moiety) could not be aligned with confidence. We used RosettaCM to build models of each of the 945 possible disulfide patterns into the density for domain B. For each disulfide arrangement, 50 models were generated, and there was a very clear energy signal for a single such arrangement (ED Fig.3k) . Then, 1000 models with this disulfide arrangement were sampled, and the lowest energy model (using the Rosetta force field augmented with a fit-to-density score term) was selected. Due to the poor quality of the reconstruction at the apex of the S trimer, the confidence of the model is lowest for the segment corresponding to residues 453-535, as homology-modeling was used to fill in details missing in the map.\n\nA backbone model was then manually built for the rest of the S polypeptide using Coot. Sequence register was assigned by visual inspection where side chain density was clearly visible. This initial hand built model was used as an initial model for Rosetta de novo 20 . The Rosetta-derived model largely agreed with the hand-built model. Rosetta de novo successfully identified fragments allowing to anchor the sequence register for domains C and D as well as for helices \u03b1 21 -\u03b1 25 . Given these anchoring positions, RosettaCM 47 augmented with a novel density-guided model-growing protocol was able to rebuild domains C and D in full. The final model was refined by applying strict non-crystallographic symmetry constraints using Rosetta 19 . Model refinement was performed using a training map corresponding to one of the two maps generated by the gold-standard refinement procedure in Relion. The second map (testing map) was used only for calculation of the FSC compared to the atomic model and preventing overfitting 48 . The quality of the final model was analyzed with Molprobity 49 . Structure analysis was assisted by the PISA 50 and DALI 51 servers. The sequence alignment was generated using MultAlin 52 and colored with ESPript 53 . All figures were generated with UCSF Chimera 45 . Table 3 . The secondary structure elements observed in our MHV S reconstruction are indicated above the sequence. TM: transmembrane helix. The black dotted lines above the sequence indicate regions poorly defined in the density. Although the viral membrane distal loops of the A domains are weakly defined in the density, the availability of a crystal structure of this domain from the same virus (PDB 3R4D) helped modeling. "}
