{"title": "A systematic review of FTA cards\u00ae as a tool for viral RNA preservation in fieldwork: Are they safe and effective?", "body": "Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) cards\u00ae have been widely used for DNA preservation and analysis, particularly in forensic sciences and genetic studies (Hsiao et al., 1999; Smith and Burgoyne, 2004) . This This method is attractive for several applications, including research of bacterial genetics, as DNA can be maintained at ambient temperature (Reeve et al., 2018) . FTA cards\u00ae have also been used for storing samples and molecular detection of both DNA and RNA viruses. Recently, they have been proposed as an alternative to liquid media in the screening of cervical cancer for HPV detection (Dong et al., 2017) , and improved biosafety has been cited as an advantage in the storage and transport of specimens containing avian influenza virus (Kraus et al., 2011) . However, viral RNA is an unstable molecule, susceptible to ubiquitous RNases, complicating its transport and detection.\n\nThis challenge is particularly relevant in settings where proper technical support for RNA handling may not be available (hereafter referred to as fieldwork). Although some studies have evaluated the FTA\u00ae cards for viral RNA preservation (Ndunguru et al., 2005; Muthukrishnan et al., 2008; Flies et al., 2015) , the optimal conditions for their handling have not been extensively studied. Notwithstanding, it is crucial to determine the appropriate temperature and maximum time for storing RNA samples on FTA cards, as well as their biosafety, in order to fieldwork with these pathogens.\n\nIn this context, this systematic review aims to assess published studies that used FTA cards\u00ae as a mean for viral RNA preservation before molecular detection.\n\nFor conducting this systematic review, we followed the recommendations of the PRISMA statement (Moher et al., 2009) . In June 2018, MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus and Science Citation Index (Web of Knowledge) were searched to identify potentially relevant articles using the search strategy (\"FTA cards\" AND \"RNA\"). No limit was set for the year, and only articles published in English or Spanish were assessed. The references of the included articles were also reviewed looking for eligible articles.\n\nTwo different authors conducted the review independently, and it was completed on July 1 st , 2018. The resulting articles were initially selected by title and abstract to identify possibly eligible studies according to the selected criteria. Subsequently, duplicates were excluded, and two authors reviewed full-text of the eligible articles. When there was disagreement in the inclusion of a study, a third researcher made the final decision. We assessed studies that used FTA cards\u00ae for storage and later isolation of RNA of viral origin with subsequent amplification. Different conditions of storage, RNA extraction, or cDNA synthesis were separately summarized when the information was available. We excluded opinion articles, letters to the editor that did not present original data, reviews, as well as articles for which full-text was not accessible through our institutional subscriptions or their information was incomplete. The potentially eligible articles were entered in a database, screened based on title and abstract and reviewed independently by two research team members. Articles included in the review by either team member were submitted to full-text screening.\n\nData extraction was performed by a third author not involved in screening and selection. The data extracted were: author, title, year of the study, institution, source of sample (e.g. blood, serum, plasma, allantoic fluid, other tissues), origin of the sample (i.e. human, poultry, plants), method of extraction of RNA from the FTA card\u00ae, time and temperature of storage of FTA card, method of assessment of RNA integrity and purity, and amplification method of the viral genome fragment.\n\nFor studies that addressed different storage times, temperatures and amplicon sizes, the maximum time and maximum temperature at which the viral RNA was detectable as well as the largest amplicon size (bp) reported were recorded. Elution characteristics were compiled if RNA extraction was conducted through elution. If the study assessed the infectivity of the virus isolated from the FTA card\u00ae, it was included.\n\nBecause there is not a previously validated tool for assessment of the quality of studies assessing methods for sample preservation on FTA cards\u00ae, we built a checklist consisting of ten criteria that were scored using a discrete scoring. Each item was scored with 2 = if the information provided was complete or sufficient to replicate the methods, 1 = if the information was incomplete or unclear, or 0 = if no information was provided. For data visualization a heatmap was generated using the scores.\n\nThe included items were: 1. Source of the sample: Report of the kind of sample obtained for storage in a FTA card\u00ae. 2. Time of storage: Report of the time the FTA card\u00ae was stored between sample collection and FTA card\u00ae processing for RNA isolation and RT-PCR. 3. Temperature of storage: Report of the temperature at which the FTA card\u00ae was stored. 4. Amplicon size: Report of the size (bp) of the targeted viral gene for amplification. If the work tried complete genome sequencing the answer to this question was also scored with two. 5. Extraction method: specification with precise detail to guarantee the reproducibility of the methods used for RNA extraction from the FTA card\u00ae. 6. Purification method: Specific information to assure the reproducibility of the methods used for RNA purification. 7. cDNA synthesis conditions: enough information about reagents and conditions to ensure the reproducibility of the methods for cDNA synthesis, including primers and cycling conditions. 8. PCR conditions: enough information concerning the methods and reagents used for PCR, including primers and cycling conditions. 9. Quantification of RNA copies: Report of quantification through RT-qPCR of the RNA isolated from the FTA card\u00ae. 10. Sequencing: Report about the sequencing of the desired amplicon and confirmed identity of the targeted virus, or confirmation through whole-genome sequencing with next-generation sequencing techniques (NGS).\n\nExperiments of viral RNA detection from FTA cards\u00ae were considered successful if the RNA fragment of interest was finally amplified from cDNA (Retro-transcription, RT) and PCR irrespective of the fragment size or if the RNA isolation allowed further genome sequencing through NGS. For studies assessing infectivity, we considered FTA card\u00ae specimens to be noninfectious when virus isolation was negative through cell culture or bio-assays using material obtained of the cards.\n\nWe found 175 records using the search strategy, and 11 additional records by checking references of the included articles. After title and abstract screening, 44 articles were excluded because they were duplicates, and 108 papers were selected for screening by title and abstract. After the examination of exclusion criteria, a total of 47 articles were finally included (Fig. 1 ). All the included articles were published in English, and all of them achieved viral RNA amplification. The assessment of the quality of the information in each article is shown in Fig. 2. A total of 95.7% of the included studies extracted total RNA before targeted amplification of the viral RNA, while the 4.3% directly isolated viral RNA from the FTA card. The studies used a wide variety of sources and samples, which included samples from mammals, birds, insects, plants, cells, and humans ( Table 1 ). The targeted viral genomes belonged to all classes of RNA virus of the Baltimore Classification except Class VI, with 8.5% of the studies reporting amplification of RNA fragments of Class III virus (dsRNA), 68.1% of Class IV virus ((+) ssRNA), 21.3% of Class V virus ((\u2212) ssRNA), and 2.1% of the three classes mentioned above. An animal specimen source accounted for 38.3% of the reports (Moscoso et al., 2005; Maw et al., 2006; Moscoso et al., 2006; Perozo et al., 2006; Purvis et al., 2006; Inoue et al., 2007; Narayanan et al., 2010; Abdelwhab et al., 2011; Kraus et al., 2011; Keeler et al., 2012; Linhares et al., 2012; Madhanmohan et al., 2013; Awad et al., 2014; Biswal et al., 2016; Foss et al., 2016; Jozwiak et al., 2016; Madhanmohan et al., 2016; Manswr et al., 2018) . Among them, twelve reports isolated RNA from viruses that can cause disease in poultry or wild birds, like Newcastle virus disease, avian influenza, or infectious bursal disease (Table 1) . Six reports isolated RNA of viruses that can cause disease in suids or bovids, like respiratory syndrome virus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus (Table 1) .\n\nPlant samples were assessed in 31.9% of the included articles, and samples obtained from insects corresponded to 14.9%. These works aimed to amplify viral RNA of arboviruses that can cause disease in humans, and also viruses capable of causing disease in fishes and plants (Hall-Mendelin et al., 2010; Price et al., 2014; Flies et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015; Navaneeth Krishnan et al., 2016; Hall-Mendelin et al., 2017; Melanson et al., 2017; Chikh-Ali et al., 2016) . Viral specimens were derived from cell culture or from a commercial inactivated vaccine in 10.6% of the reports (Muthukrishnan et al., 2008; Li et al., 2012; Bankamp et al., 2013; Sakai et al., 2015; Montmayeur et al., 2017) . Finally, two reports isolated virus using human samples: stool and blood. (Dauner et al., 2015; Tam et al., 2015) .\n\nInfectious virus was isolated from one of only fourteen included studies that tested for infectivity of the virus from an FTA card\u00ae (Maw et al., 2006) . In this study, ADVANTEC chromatography paper No. 526, (Toyo Roshi, Tokyo, Japan), ADVANTEC filter paper No. 2 (Toyo Roshi), and stationery copy paper were compared with FTA cards\u00ae for the isolation and inactivation of the dsRNA from the infectious bursal disease virus, a virus member of the Birnaviridae family, genus Avibirnavirus, with a segmented genome. In this study, every paper-based matrix allowed the isolation of viral RNA and infectious virus. However, virus inactivation was achieved after phenol fixation on the FTA card\u00ae. Thirteen other studies demonstrated a lack of infectious virus from the FTA card (Moscoso et al., 2005; Moscoso et al., 2006; Perozo et al., 2006; Muthukrishnan et al., 2008; Narayanan et al., 2010; Abdelwhab et al., 2011; Keeler et al., 2012; Linhares et al., 2012; Bankamp et al., 2013; Awad et al., 2014; Tam et al., 2015; Jozwiak et al., 2016; Madhanmohan et al., 2016) (Narayanan et al., 2010) . Regarding storage of the FTA cards\u00ae before further viral RNA purification, the cards were stored for periods that varied from one to eight months (median time: 30 days, IQR 21-90), at temperatures that ranged between \u221220\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C (median temperature: 25\u00b0C, IQR 4\u00b0C-25\u00b0C). Three protocols for RNA amplification from the FTA card\u00ae were reported: 1. Elution of RNA from the FTA card\u00ae, 2. Direct viral RNA purification, and 3. Disk cleaning and soaking.\n\nElution of RNA from FTA cards\u00ae before RNA amplification was the most common method for RNA extraction. It was performed in 55.1% of the assessed studies. The elution conditions and eluents used in those studies are summarized in Table 2 . Briefly, viral RNA was obtained by soaking fragments of the FTA card\u00ae in an eluent solution, followed by incubation with or without agitation with temperatures that ranged between 4-95\u00b0C. After elution, the RNA underwent a purification step using commercial kits (Moscoso et al., 2005; Ndunguru et al., 2005; Maw et al., 2006; Moscoso et al., 2006; Purvis et al., 2006; Abdelwhab et al., 2011; Keeler et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Bankamp et al., 2013; Sakai et al., 2015; Tam et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015; Biswal et al., 2016; Foss et al., 2016; Madhanmohan et al., 2016; Karavina and Gubba, 2017; Manswr et al., 2018) or standard protocols like sodium acetate and isopropanol precipitation (Grund et al., 2010; Price et al., 2014) . In one case, magnetic beads were used for purification and concentration of RNA (Linhares et al., 2012) Direct virus RNA purification was performed in 30.6% of the studies. It consisted of a protocol in which FTA card\u00ae punches were used for RNA purification without a previous step of elution from the FTA card\u00ae. The punches were directly soaked in the lysis and extraction solutions of different commercial kits, TRIzol reagent\u00ae or Guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method ( Table 1) . Most of the studies used methods for total RNA extraction and only one study used a commercial kit for viral RNA isolation (Montmayeur et al., 2017) . In this particular case, the genome of polioviruses, (Enterovirus C, genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae), a virus with a (+) ssRNA non-segmented genome of 6.7-10.1 kb with a poly(A) tail, was isolated from FTA cards\u00ae. This method allowed the use of NGS techniques for complete genome sequencing with a total of 206,156 reads (90% of reads mapping to poliovirus, giving 99% genome coverage) (Montmayeur et al., 2017) .\n\nOn the other hand, 8.2% of the included studies used disk cleaning and soaking for RNA purification, which consisted of punching a disk from the card and placing in a solution to remove contaminants before proceeding one or two-step RT-PCR by placing the cleaned disk into a second solution (the reaction mix). Note that this method did not include an RNA purification step (Roy and Nassuth, 2005; Inoue et al., 2007; Narayanan et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2011) .\n\nThe third strategy was to perform one or two-step RT-PCR after RNA isolation or preparation from the FTA cards\u00ae. In 57.1% of these studies, the targeted viral genes were amplified by one-step RT-PCR. Most of them (96.4%) used specific primers for the RT step and the PCR step. Only one study used random primers for RT and then specific primers for PCR (Yang et al., 2015) . The reaction mix composition, as well as the cycling conditions in each work, varied depending on the PCR kit used and the desired amplicon. Eleven studies quantified the product of the RT-PCR, 26 used the product of these reactions for sequencing, and Quality assessment chart. Each included study was assessed in order to determine the information provided for each variable. Each variable was scored with 2 = green, if the information provided was complete or sufficient to replicate the methods, 1 = yellow, if the information was incomplete or unclear, or 0 = red, if no information was provided. For data visualization a heatmap was generated using the scores (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article).\n\nGeneral characteristics of the included works that performed viral RNA amplification/sequencing from samples immobilized in FTA cards\u00ae. N/A = Not Apply, (\u2212) = Information not provided. in one study, RNA-seq was implemented for viral identification. (Maina et al., 2016a,c,b,d,e; Maina et al., 2017a, b; Maina et al., 2017c; Montmayeur et al., 2017) .\n\nThe findings of this systematic review support that viral RNA from different types of RNA viruses spotted in a FTA card\u00ae can be purified and then amplified for viral identification. The RNA can be isolated from a large number of sources and samples, and stored over a wide range of periods of time and temperatures. This highlights the fact that FTA cards\u00ae could be used as means for transport and storage of RNA pathogens. However, storage time and temperature are critical variables affecting RNA preservation. Studies reviewed here suggest that viral RNA could be stable in a wide range of temperatures for several months. Cards stored at 4\u00b0C allowed the amplification of fragments up to\u02dc1200 bp, and cards stored for six months allowed amplification of fragments up to\u02dc800 bp.\n\nUse of FTA cards to work with biospecimens appears to be relatively safe since isolation of infectious virus was rarely reported. Nevertheless, the possibility remains that some infectious virus could be present in this type of sample, as shown by the study of bursal disease virus. In this case, additional chemical fixation was used to render the sample completely noninfectious (Maw et al., 2006) .\n\nMore data is required to explain why the bursal disease virus remained infectious when such a wide variety of viruses were inactivated after spotting on FTA cards\u00ae Narayanan et al., 2010; Abdelwhab et al., 2011; Awad et al., 2014; Jozwiak et al., 2016; Madhanmohan et al., 2016) . Possible explanations include that infectious bursal disease virus is a non-enveloped virus. While enveloped viruses can persist viable in dried surfaces for five days, non-enveloped viruses can persist for weeks (Firquet et al., 2015) . However, the inability to isolate viable foot-and-mouth disease virus from FTA cards\u00ae, another non-enveloped virus, is inconsistent with this argument (Madhanmohan et al., 2016) . Storage time and temperature and card manipulation and processing during viral isolation are other possible factors that could affect viral infectiousness. It is remarkable that Maw et al., 2006 isolated infective virus after seven days of storage at room temperature, but Jozwiak et al., 2016 were unable of performing viral isolation even as earlier as 1 h after sample spotting on FTA card, and Linhares et al., 2012 after storage at 4\u00b0C for 24 h. In this context, viral viability testing after immobilization on FTA cards\u00ae seems like an advisable practice before considering FTA cards\u00ae isolates innocuous. Then, FTA cards\u00ae should be managed and stored following the required biosafety precautions.\n\nDifferent methods for extraction and purification were represented in the literature. The elution and subsequent purification of the RNA are the most widely used, and different elution solutions in a wide range of volumes, time, agitation and temperatures have been tested. Based on these protocols, we advise to keep the elution volume below 500 \u03bcL and the elution time below 30 min, with vortex or agitation every 5 min at room temperature. Then perform RNA purification using commercial kits or standard protocols before subsequent RT-PCR. This method was effective for amplification of fragments up to\u02dc1700 bp.\n\nFor disc cleaning protocols it is advisable to add 200 \u03bcL of FTA purification reagent in a tube containing the discs, mix thoroughly for 3 min at room temperature, and repeat this step twice. Then, rinse the discs with 200 \u03bcL of TE Buffer and, finally, add the disc to the proper PCR reaction mix. When the source material likely contains PCR inhibitors, an additional step of cleaning with 200 \u03bcL of Ethanol 70% can be performed (Roy and Nassuth, 2005; Inoue et al., 2007; Narayanan et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2011) . These protocols and direct purification protocols allowed amplification of fragments of\u02dc900 bp, even when the storage times of the FTA card\u00ae were up to eight months at room temperature. This suggests that probably the three reported methods for RNA extraction from the FTA card\u00ae have similar effectiveness and that their selection could be related to reagent availability or personal preferences.\n\nSince the stability and integrity of viral RNA for molecular detection is a significant concern during fieldwork, this systematic review focused on the evaluation of FTA cards\u00ae as a strategy for detection of these pathogens. However, successful applications of these cards have been also reported for DNA viruses and bacteria (Dong et al., 2017; Reeve et al., 2018) . For instance, the use of FTA cards\u00ae have been proved effective as a means of sample storage and transport for genotyping isolates of Campylobacter jejuni obtained from poultry and stored for three months at room temperature (Sierra-Arguello et al., 2016) .\n\nIt is possible that publication bias, the lack of publishing reports with negative results, could lead to failure in identifying studies that were unable to amplify RNA extracted from the FTA cards\u00ae. The search strategy (\"FTA cards\" AND \"RNA\") was used instead of (\"FTA card\" AND \"RNA\") since the first retrieved more records in two of the assessed databases, and the same number of records in Scopus. Additionally, though we conducted an extensive search in different databases, and the screened works were searched through different institutional subscriptions, four papers were not accessible for full-text assessment. Nevertheless, the search identified more than forty reports evaluating FTA cards\u00ae as RNA immobilization matrix with sufficient information to summarize their protocols for potential replication.\n\nAlthough the goal of this review was to consider fieldwork conditions, some of the identified studies used the FTA card\u00ae for RNA spotting in controlled laboratory conditions. Therefore, the effectiveness of this matrix could vary when used in fieldwork and associated handling and shipping conditions. In these particular cases, fieldwork testing should be performed. However, some of the studies identified tested their effectiveness submitting these matrices to transport and shipping, similar to fieldwork conditions (Madhanmohan et al., 2016) .\n\nThe effectiveness of FTA cards\u00ae for sample collection and recovery of viral RNA for downstream analysis was demonstrated by several studies. Use of FTA cards\u00ae may be an attractive approach for fieldwork involving molecular detection and/or characterization of viral pathogens, particularly when simple and cheap sample collection and transport systems are desirable. The stability of RNA genomic material of many different viruses under a wide range of conditions further supports the advantage of FTA cards\u00ae use, even for metagenomic analysis (Yang et al., 2015; Maina et al., 2017b) . Though many viruses will become inactivated in the collection and storage process, we suggest that all specimens should be considered potentially infectious unless proven otherwise. Thus, the available evidence suggests that FTA cards\u00ae are a good option for virus storage and transport for molecular detection and identification of RNA viral pathogens, although additional field testing would be advisable to further validate and standardize these methods for use in the fieldwork.\n\nThis work was supported by Sistema General de Regal\u00edas de Colombia, Departamento Nacional de Planeaci\u00f3n (C\u00f3digo BPIN 2012000100050), and Vicerrector\u00eda de Investigaciones, Innovaci\u00f3n y Extensi\u00f3n, Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Pereira [Grant name: Desarrollo de Capacidades Cient\u00edficas y Tecnol\u00f3gicas en Biotecnolog\u00eda Aplicadas a los Sectores de la Salud y la Agroindustria en el Departamento de Risaralda].
