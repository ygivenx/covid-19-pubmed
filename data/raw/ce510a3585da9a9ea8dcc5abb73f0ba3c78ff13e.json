{"title": "Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of (2-oxaadamant-1-yl)amines", "body": "1-Adamantylamine (amantadine) and its 3,5-dimethyl analogue, memantine, are NMDA receptor antagonists approved for the treatment of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. 1 Amantadine also has prophylactic and therapeutic activities in influenza A virus infections 2 , and related adamantane derivatives show antiviral activity. 3 Moreover, amantadine, memantine, and related polycyclic amines possess trypanocidal properties. 4 It is well known in medicinal chemistry that substitution of a methylene unit in a bioactive compound for an oxygen atom usually leads to analogues showing similar activity to the parent compound. 5 Indeed, NGP1-01, a brain-permeable, oxa-polycyclic cage amine, is a dual action uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist and blocker of L-type calcium-channels. In addition, several experiments have shown that NGP1-01 has neuroprotective activity ( Fig. 1) . 6 Based on the interesting and widely observed biological activity of amantadine, memantine, and NGP1-01, we therefore sought to explore the biological profile of (2-oxaadamant-1-yl)amine derivatives.\n\nIn this paper, we report the synthesis of several (2-oxaadamant-1-yl)amines and related compounds and their pharmacological evaluation as NMDA receptor antagonists, and antivirals and trypanocidals agents.\n\nStarting from the known diketone 1, 7 we have prepared amines 2\u00c04, 7, 8, and 10\u00c015 using classical methods in amine chemistry (see Scheme 1). Secondary amines 2a and 2b were obtained in high yields following a known general procedure that involves reductive amination of diketone 1. 8 Thus, reaction of 1 with benzylamine followed by reduction with LiAlH 4 led to amine 2a in 58% yield. Similarly, reductive amination of 1 with phenethylamine furnished amine 2b in 51% yield. Reductive alkylation of amines 2a,b with formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride afforded tertiary amines 3a,b in high yields. Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl group of amines 2a and 3a led to 7 and 4, respectively. Finally, alkylation of 2a with benzyl chloride led to 8 in 85% yield.\n\nAlcohols of general structure 5 were prepared using a general method developed some time ago by our group. 9 Several attempts to carry out the substitution of the hydroxyl group of 5 by a wide range of amines led to the recovery of the starting material. Moreover, the attempted Ritter reaction of 5c with acetonitrile in acidic medium led to the known enone 6 in high yield. 9c However, reaction of 5a-c with aqueous hydrazine led to hydrazines 9a-c in high yields, probably due to the a-effect ensuring a higher nucleophilicity of hydrazine. Even though the reaction failed in the case of 5d.\n\nCatalytic hydrogenation of 9a,b furnished amines 10a,b in high yields. Surprisingly, 9c led to a mixture of the expected amine 10c and the cyclohexyl derivative 10d in the ratio of 3:4. Both products were separated by column chromatography. Reductive methylation of amines 10a and 10b with formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride afforded tertiary amines 11a and 11b, respectively. In a similar way, reductive alkylation of 10b with acetaldehyde or benzaldehyde led to amines 12 and 13, respectively. Finally, secondary amine 15 was synthesized from benzylamine 13 by reductive alkylation followed by catalytic debenzylation in good overall yield.\n\nThe structure of all new compounds was confirmed by elemental analysis or by accurate mass measurement, IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and mass spectral data.\n\nIn the last years there has been an intensive research on the development of new NMDA receptor antagonists, since this sub- type of receptors has been involved in the apoptotic process that develops during neurodegenerative diseases. Memantine is a non-competitive and low affinity blocker that acts selectively on NMDA receptors that is being used in Alzheimer's disease to slow down its progression. 10 The activity of the different (2-oxaadamant-1-yl)amines was assayed on cerebellar granule neurons loaded with the calcium-sensitive probe Fura-2. 11 Addition of glutamate or NMDA (100 lM) in the presence of glycine (10 lM) produced a robust and stable increase in intracellular calcium that was challenged with cumulative additions of the compounds to be tested. The data presented in Table 1 indicate that the presence of a substituent in C-3 in the 2-oxaadamantane nucleus is essential for NMDA receptor antagonism. Thus, primary amine 7 and all its N-alkylated and Ndialkylated derivatives (2a,b, 3a,b, 4, and 8) are inactive as it is the case of the methyl derivatives 10a and 11a. Phenyl derivative 10c is only a weak NMDA receptor antagonist while more lipophilic amines 10b and 10d show a similar potency than amantadine. Further enhancement in potency was achieved by alkylation of 10b, the most active derivative being 12, a tertiary amine that is seven times more potent than amantadine, but still ten times less potent than memantine. Contrary to our expectations, all the benzyl derivatives were found to be inactive. This is in striking contrast with NGP1-01 that features a benzyl group essential for NMDA receptor antagonism, and with previous work by our groups that found that benzylated ring-contracted analogues of amantadine showed NMDA receptor antagonism. 12\n\nPrimary amines 7, 10c, and 10d and secondary amines 2a, 4, and 15 were tested for antiviral activity. None of the tested compounds displayed activity against the enveloped DNA viruses herpes simplex virus (type 1 or type 2) or vaccinia virus; the enveloped RNA viruses feline coronavirus, parainfluenza-3 virus, respiratory syncytial virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, sindbis virus, or Punta Toro virus; or the non-enveloped RNA viruses Coxsackievirus B4 and Reovirus-1. Also none of the compounds was found to be active against influenza virus A/H1N1, A/H3N2, or B.\n\nProtozoan parasites of the Trypanosoma brucei species complex are the causative agents of African trypanosomiasis, a disease that is invariably fatal unless treated. However, current drugs are characterized by toxicity, the need for administration under medical supervision, and in many cases, a lack of efficacy. New drugs to combat this important disease are urgently needed. A range of adamantylamine compounds have trypanocidal activity. 4 We therefore investigated whether this property also extended to (2oxaadamant-1-yl)amine derivatives.\n\nAll the new derivatives described in this paper were tested for potency against cultured bloodstream form T. brucei. As was the case with the NMDA receptor antagonism, the presence of a substitution at the C-3 position in the 2-oxadamantane nucleus was found to be essential for trypanocidal activity. Of these compounds, the tertiary amines 11a,b were found to be the most active. Amine 11b had an IC 50 = 10.92 \u00b1 0.21 lM and an IC 90 = 15.54 \u00b1 1.14 lM, while the trimethyl derivative 11a had an IC 50 = 3.97 \u00b1 0.75 lM and an IC 90 = 6.82 \u00b1 0.84 lM. Amine 11a was the most potent compound tested, being approximately twice as active as rimantadine (IC 50 = 7.04 \u00b1 0.12 lM; IC 90 = 13.97 \u00b1 1.68 lM), and at least 30 times more active than amantadine (IC 50 > 130 lM). Amines 2a, b, 3a, b, 4, 7 , and 8, which lack the C3 substitution, had no activity at concentrations up to 5 mg mL \u00c01 . The primary and secondary amines 10a-d, 13 , and 15 also displayed no significant trypanocidal properties, even though they do carry a substitution at this position.\n\nSeveral adamantane derivatives have previously been shown to have trypanocidal properties; however the oxanalogues reported here are the first heteroadamantanes to show significant activity against bloodstream form T. brucei. 4\n\nIn summary, we have synthesized and fully characterized several (2-oxaadamant-1-yl)amines. The presence of a substitution at the C-3 position is essential for NMDA receptor antagonism. Although 11b, 12, and 15 were more potent than amantadine against NMDA-induced calcium increase in cerebellar granule neurons, they were less potent than memantine. In contrast with the model compound NGP1-01, all our benzyl derivatives were devoid of NMDA receptor antagonism activity. None of the tested compounds showed antiviral activity. Two tertiary amines, 11a and 11b, displayed a significant level of trypanocidal activity; 11a was twice as active as rimantadine. The mechanism by which adamantylamine derivatives kill trypanosomes is unknown, but it has been hypothesized by analogy with the known properties of this class of compound that it may involve channel blocking activity. 4 The data obtained with the trimethyl amine 11a now provides a basis for exploring if related derivatives have enhanced activity.\n\nThe synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of more polycyclic cage amines are in progress.\n\nMelting points were determined in open capillary tubes. Unless otherwise stated, NMR spectra were recorded in CD 3 OD in the following spectrometers: 1 H NMR (500 MHz), 13 C NMR (75.4 MHz) .

Anal. Calcd for C 12 H 21 NO\u00c11.1HCl\u00c10.5H 2 O (242.60): C, 59.41; H, 9.58; N, 5.77; Cl, 15.34. Found: C, 59.41; H, 9.89; N, 6.11; Cl, 15 .61.\n\nThe functional assay of antagonist activity at NMDA receptors was performed using primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons, which were prepared according to established protocols. 11 Cells were grown on 10 mm poly-L-lysine-coated glass cover slips, and used for the experiments after 7-14 days in vitro. Cells were loaded with 6 lM Fura-2 AM (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) for 45 min. Afterwards, the coverslip was mounted on a quartz cuvette containing a Locke-Hepes buffer using a special holder. Measurements were performed using a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorometer equipped with a fast-filter accessory, under mild agitation and at 37\u00b0C. Analysis from each sample was recorded real-time during 1200 s. After stimulation with NMDA or glutamate (100 lM, in the presence of 10 lM glycine), increasing cumulative concentrations of the compound to be tested were added. The percentages of inhibition at every tested concentration were analyzed using a nonlinear regression curve fitting (variable slope) by using the software GraphPad Prism 4.0.\n\nThe antiviral activity of the compounds was determined in established cell culture assays using a selection of DNA and RNA viruses, including three subtypes of influenza virus [A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1); A/Hong Kong/7/87 (H3N2); and B/Hong Kong/5/72]. 13 The compounds 0 inhibitory effect on virus replication as well as their cytotoxicity was monitored by microscopical examination, and confirmed by the colorimetric MTS cell viability assay.\n\nCultures of bloodstream form T. brucei (strain 427) were maintained at 37\u00b0C in modified Iscove 0 s medium (pH 7.4). 14 Trypanocidal activity was assessed by growing parasites for 48 h in the presence of various drug concentrations to determine the levels which inhibited growth by 50% (IC 50 ) and 90% (IC 90 ). In the case of untreated cultures (volume 4 mL), cell densities increased from 0.5 \u00c2 10 4 to 1 \u00c2 10 6 cells mL \u00c01 over this period. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Cell densities at each drug concentration were determined using a hemocytometer (Weber Scientific International Ltd), and drug sensitivity was expressed as a percentage of growth of control cells."}
