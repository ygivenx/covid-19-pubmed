{"title": "External quality assessment for the molecular detection of MERS-CoV in China", "body": "Since the discovery of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 in Saudi Arabia [1, 2] , there have been 1621 laboratory-confirmed human cases, including 584 deaths, with a 36.0% mortality rate [3] . MERS-CoV is a kind of novel enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, which can cause severe respiratory complications and renal failure in infected patients [2, 4] . Although most MERS-CoV infections occurred in the Middle East, cases have been reported in Europe, North America, and Asia through people traveling from the Middle East or their contacts [5] . Since May 2015, the Republic of Korea has newly been affected, causing the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula [6] ; this highlighted the importance of a surveillance system to prevent further spread [7] . Simultaneously, China increased its efforts to detect MERS-CoV because of an imported case of MERS from Korea, which was a threat to public health [8] . Hence, rapid and effective diagnosis of the infectious agent is crucial for the timely control and management of this disease.\n\nLaboratory detection of MERS-CoV is based on molecular techniques, and the most commonly used approach is real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), which is an essential and indispensable method for laboratory molecular diagnostics [9] [10] [11] . Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) published an updated interim guidance for laboratory testing of MERS-CoV [12] . Three assays for diagnosing MERS-CoV http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.12.001 1386-6532/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The tests include an assay targeting upstream of the envelope gene (upE) [10] , which is highly sensitive and recommended for laboratory screening, followed by confirmation with assays targeting either the open reading frame 1b (ORF 1b) [10] or 1a (ORF 1a) [11] . Meanwhile, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) developed rRT-PCR assays targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene of MERS-CoV to complement the upE and ORF 1a/1b assays during screening and confirmation [6, 13] . Additionally, confirmation for the screening test can be aided by partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or N gene [11] .\n\nSince the first case of MERS was identified, the Chinese CDC has published and provided primer-probe sets for the rapid molecular diagnosis of suspected infections, as well as several commercial kit manufacturers. However, the diversity of nucleic acid extraction techniques, detection methods, instruments and commercial assays used, and disparate individual operators may cause variations in evaluating laboratory performance. Therefore, there is an urgent need for quality assurance with diagnostics, which could make results obtained from different laboratories comparable. External quality assessment (EQA) is an important part of laboratory quality management and improvement.\n\nA nationwide EQA was implemented by the National Center for Clinical Laboratories (NCCL) to evaluate the MERS-CoV diagnostic capability of laboratories within the Chinese mainland.\n\nTwo target segments of nucleotide sequences from the MERS-CoV genome (GenBank accession no. JX869059.2) were synthesized separately: the first was 394 bp, consisting of part of the upE gene, and the other was 1629 bp, which encompassed part of the ORF 1a, ORF 1b, N, and RdRp genes. The chimeric sequences were amplified (primers listed in Table 1) , gel-purified, and separately subcloned into Kpn I/Pvu I and Kpn I/Pac I sites of the pACYC-MS2 vector [14, 15] to form the recombinant plasmids, pACYC-MS2-upE and pACYC-MS2-ORF 1ab/N, respectively. These two kinds of MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) packaging specific sequences of MERS-CoV were expressed and purified according to previously published protocols of our laboratory [14] [15] [16] . Then, they were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), enzymatic digestion test, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and RT-PCR.\n\nThe stability of the two types of MERS-CoV VLPs was evaluated in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco; USA) under various conditions. Firstly, RNA of the VLPs was extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) and quantified using an absorbance-based nucleic acid quantification method (NanoDrop 2000; Thermo). The concentration of sample was calculated using the formula: (6.02 \u00d7 10 23 copies/mol) \u00d7 (g/mL)/(MW g/mol) = copies/mL. Each kind of quantified VLPs was diluted with DMEM in order to obtain samples with two concentrations. The samples were then incubated at 4 \u2022 C, 25 \u2022 C, and 37 \u2022 C for a defined period until each time point and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C until all of the samples were collected. The samples were assessed in duplicate using the MERS-CoV rRT-PCR kit (BioPerfectus Technologies, Jiangsu, China), with DMEM being used as a negative control in each run.\n\nThe coded panel (n = 10) for EQA consisted of three negative and seven positive samples, ranging from 2.4 \u00d7 10 4 to 4.8 \u00d7 10 7 copies/mL, in accordance with the detectable RNA concentrations in the clinical respiratory specimens [17] . The positive samples were obtained by appropriate dilution and mixing of the two kinds of MERS-CoV VLPs ( Table 2) . Among the seven positive samples, No. 1503 had the lowest concentration, which was prepared to determine the detection limit of various commercial kits and detection capability of different laboratories. Two replicate specimens (No. 1506 and No. 1508) were prepared to evaluate the repeatability of each participant's operation. DMEM was used for negative samples and as dilution buffer for positive ones. In addition, one negative sample (No. 1502) containing measles virus (MV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) VLPs was used to test whether MERS-CoV detection could be obscured by the presence of other viruses. Before dispatch, each sample was assessed and identified three times by ourselves.\n\nTest samples were shipped on ice to participating laboratories, along with the instructions. All participants were asked to detect MERS-CoV by using their routine operating procedures. Details, such as qualitative results and the threshold cycle (Ct) value of each sample, information about RNA extraction and detection methods, instruments used, and the time point of beginning MERS-CoV molecular detection, were recorded.\n\nThe results were classified as competent (100% correct responses), acceptable (\u22642 incorrect results), or improvable (>2 incorrect results). All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0. Sensitivities among different groups were compared by applying Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test when appropriate with P values <0.05 regarded as statistically significant.\n\nMERS-CoV VLPs were constructed and expressed successfully, which were validated through sequencing and a series of experiments (Fig. S1 ). As shown in Fig. S1A , the diameters of the MERS-CoV VLPs were about 28-30 nm, which was confirmed by TEM. A 14-kDa protein band could be seen when conducting the SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. S1B ). After digestion with RNase A and DNase I for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C, a single band (about 1 kb in length) was visible using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide (Fig. S1C ). RT-PCR was applied to confirm the successful packaging of the target sequences (Fig. S1D) . Stability evaluations revealed that the MERS-CoV VLPs could be stable for at least two weeks at 37 \u2022 C, one month at 25 \u2022 C, and two months at 4 \u2022 C (Fig. S2) .\n\nEach sample of the panel was assessed by using different commercial kits before distribution, and all the tests could confirm positive and negative results successfully.\n\nIn total, 56 laboratories from 16 provinces, municipalities, or autonomous regions participated in the EQA for MERS-CoV molecular detection. Among them, 34 laboratories were from the provincial or municipal CDC of China, 13 laboratories were from [10] [11] [12] [13] were all involved in these amplified sequences. designated hospitals for suspected MERS-CoV infection, and nine were commercial kit manufacturers (Fig. 1A ). In addition, half of the participants have established the MERS-CoV molecular detection project since 2014. For nucleic acid extraction, various commercial kits were applied by the selected laboratories (Fig. 1B) . Among them, 36 participants (64.3%) chose the spin column method, 19 participants (33.9%) chose the magnetic bead method, and one (1.8%) used the TRIzol method to extract RNA. Manual extraction was preferred by most agencies while others (15/56, 26.8%) applied an automated nucleic acid extractor. However, with the exception of three participants who employed an in-house-developed rRT-PCR assay, all other participants (53/56, 94.6%) applied commercially available rRT-PCR kits (Fig. 1C ).\n\nOf 56 completed data sets, the performances were found to be competent in 46 (82.1%) analyses. The performances of seven (12.5%) participants were classified as acceptable and three (5.4%) laboratories were included in the improvable group (Fig. 1D) . The results suggested that there was no difference in testing performance among the CDC, designated hospitals, and manufacturers (P = 0.427).\n\nIn total, 1120 results targeting upE and ORF 1a/1b genes were returned, of which 24 (2.1%) were incorrectly reported by 10 laboratories and were false-negatives ( Table 2 ). The sensitivity for upE and ORF 1a/1b detection was 99.0% (388/392) and 94.9% (372/392), respectively, which suggested a statistical difference between them (P = 0.001). All negative samples were correctly identified, reaching c In-house, in-house-developed rRT-PCR assay for MERS-CoV detection, which is recommended by Chinese CDC.\n\n100% specificity. Particularly, the mixture with other viruses (sample No. 1502) did not interfere with the detection of MERS-CoV. We next evaluated the performance of different assays. The total sensitivity and specificity were 96.9% (760/784) and 100% (336/336), respectively ( Table 3 ). The commercially available assay from BioPerfectus Technologies was the most widely used by participants, with a sensitivity of 98.7% (373/378). There were no differences in competency among the first six commercial assays (Table 3 ) and the in-house-developed assay (P > 0.05). However, the commercial assay from Tianlong Bio-Tech Co., Ltd., which was used by two agencies, only had a sensitivity of 64.3% (18/28). Each laboratory using it returned five false-negative results for the ORF 1b gene (10 in total) and was classified into the improvable group. Three commercial assays, Roche Diagnostics Shanghai Ltd., Sansure Bio-Tech Co., Ltd., and Kinghawk Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., each were applied by one laboratory, and all samples were correctly verified. The in-house-developed assay recommended by the Chinese CDC produced 100% accurate results from three participants, achieving competent outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, the results for the N gene were returned by nine laboratories, including three false-positive results reported by two agencies (Table S1 ).\n\nSince the occurrence of an imported case of MERS in China, diagnostic procedures for MERS-CoV were developed by the Chinese CDC according to those employed by the WHO. As its first appearance in China, it was quite important to carry out rapid diagnosis and provide reliable detection results. This study was the first EQA program to evaluate the laboratory performance and capability of MERS-CoV molecular diagnosis in China.\n\nThe results of the EQA showed that the majority of laboratories (82.1%) could achieve 100% accuracy for MERS-CoV detection. Particularly, all negative samples in the panel were identified correctly, reaching 100% specificity. At RNA concentration of 2.4 \u00d7 10 4 copies/mL, which was close to that in clinical specimen obtained from the lower respiratory tract [17] [18] [19] , 7.1% of outcomes failed to detect the weak-positive samples. Thus, circumstances for falsenegative results should be investigated because such issues in sensitivity during clinical work may cause delayed treatment for infected patients and potential spread of an epidemic. For management, internal controls are advised during nucleic acid extraction, and operation standardization should be emphasized.\n\nWe observed significant difference in sensitivities between the upE and ORF 1a/1b detection. Furthermore, a similar phenomenon was found in three samples (No. 1503, 1506, and 1508) with relatively low RNA concentrations. It suggested that the assay targeting the upE gene is more sensitive than that targeting ORF 1a/1b, which is in accordance with reported studies [11] and clarified the fact that the upE gene with higher sensitivity is more appropriate as a screening assay.\n\nIn the EQA, a wide range of commercial assays were employed. Among them, the assay from BioPerfectus Technologies was the most widely used by participants and reached 98.7% sensitivity. However, two laboratories using the commercial assay from Tianlong Bio-Tech Co., Ltd., reported five false-negative results each for ORF 1b gene and were classified into the improvable group. Specifically, one participant chose TIANGEN kit applying spin column method in manual and the other used Tianlong kit applying magnetic bead method automatically when extracting RNA. Moreover, the sensitivities of ORF 1a/1b detection from the other ten assays (Table 3) were all acceptable, suggesting that the MERS-CoV sequences of VLPs met the requirements for molecular detection. Then, we could not conduct an in-depth analysis owing to the limited number of the users. We will implement a follow-up to evaluate the performances of these two participants, because further laboratory practice optimization and external quality management are required.\n\nIn a previous international EQA of molecular diagnostics for MERS-CoV in 2014, positive cell culture supernatants containing virus after inactivation were used as validated specimens and the results with high variance were received from different laboratories owing largely to lack of international nucleic acid testing (NAT) standard [20] . In comparison, MS2 VLPs encapsulating specific sequences of MERS-CoV RNA were used in our study as surrogates, which exhibited superior advantages, such as being noninfectious, nuclease resistant, stable, and safe for transport. Moreover, RNA of VLPs can be quantified so that the results are credible and comparable. Stability analyses suggested that the MERS-CoV VLPs could be stable for at least two weeks at 37 \u2022 C, one month at 25 \u2022 C, and two months at 4 \u2022 C (Fig. S2) .\n\nIn conclusion, the overall performance of the first EQA program for MERS-CoV detection in China indicated that the majority of participating laboratories were competent to detect this emerging virus and showed robust capability to confirm the results. Nevertheless, the poor score exhibited by a small number of participants suggested a serious need to improve laboratory practices, standardize operating procedures, and strengthen daily quality management. EQA can help improve the diagnostic capability of laboratories and find the best solution to solve existing problems, such as low detection sensitivity for samples with lower viral concentrations. Thus, a wider EQA for MERS-CoV molecular detection incorporating more laboratories and other human coronaviruses such as OC43, NL63, HKU1, and 229E is expected and will be planned and conducted in the future."}
