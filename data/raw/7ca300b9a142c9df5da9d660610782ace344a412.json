{"title": "", "body": "multi-center study. 82 client-owned cats with HCM and recently resolved CHF (within the last 60 days) were randomized (29 cats with and 53 cats without LVOTO). Cats received either pimobendan (0.30 mg/kg q12h, n = 43) or placebo (n = 39) in conjunction with furosemide.\n\nThe proportion of cats reaching the primary endpoint (\"success-yes\"; n = 25, 12 on pimobendan and 13 on placebo) in the full analysis set population (n = 76) was not different between treatment groups (P = 0.746). Cats without LVOTO (n = 47) had a numerically higher success rate if on pimobendan (n = 8) compared to placebo (n = 4;\n\nOdds ratio 2.118, 95% CI 0.54-8.34) whereas cats with LVOTO (n = 29) had a numerically higher success rate if on placebo (n = 9) compared to pimobendan (n = 4; Odds ratio 0.267, 95% CI 0.06-1.26).\n\nIncidence of adverse events was comparable in both treatment groups (P > 0.05).\n\nPimobendan administration did not lead to improved 180-day outcome in this study. Additional endpoints for a pivotal study were not identified. No adverse events occurred during and after the infusion of Aptamer BC 007, indicating that the administration is safe for use in dogs. The estimated median time to the primary endpoint was significantly longer for dogs receiving Aptamer (572 days, IQR 442-840 days) than for dogs in the DCM control group 1 (266 days, IQR 97-438 days) (Log Rank: P = 0.009).\n\nGiven that this is a pilot study with only a small study population, it remains necessary to validate our findings with a large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. LAD was survived by all patients, and was successful in reducing left atrial pressure by 50% or greater in 5/6 patients (for one patient, the final LAP was unable to be measured for technical reasons). The size of final balloon dilatation across the atrial septum was 8 mm in the first 3 dogs, 10 mm in the 4th and 5th, and 12 mm in the 6th. Procedural time was 78-150 minutes. Complications of the procedure included self-limiting pericardial effusion (2/6) and arrhythmias (atrial premature complexes (4/6), atrial flutter (1/6)). Arrhythmias were either self-limiting or resolved with therapy in all dogs. Three dogs were discharged the following day, 1 was discharged 2 days post-procedure; 2 died within 36 hours of the procedure (owner-elected euthanasia, respiratory failure).\n\nSigns of left CHF resolved in the surviving dogs following the procedure. Reductions in diuretic doses were achieved in all patients. No evidence of worsening pulmonary hypertension or right CHF was evident in any patient during short-term follow-up (3 months). One dog required an increase in diuretic dose at 45 days; the iASD was noted to be smaller than initially created (4.5 mm vs 1.5 mm at 45 days), suggesting spontaneous closure was responsible for CHF. This dog developed recrudescence of pulmonary edema at 87 days, at which time the defect was not patent; the procedure was successfully repeated, with discharge the following day. The remaining surviving dogs are free of congestive signs with patent iASD at time of report submission.\n\nLeft atrial decompression results in rapid reduction of left atrial pressure and may be a promising, cost-effective therapeutic option for dogs in which current medical therapies are limited. Further investigation and long-term follow-up are necessary to determine appropriate timing, patient selection, and size of iASD to optimize outcomes. Discordant antigen and toxin ELISA results may be encountered in horses, complicating diagnosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability to isolate toxigenic C. difficile from antigen positive, toxin negative samples. Fecal samples were collected from foals ranging from 1 day to 3 weeks of age that were presented to a referral hospital for diarrhea and/or enteritis, or that developed diarrhea or enteritis during hospitalization. Sampling was performed between 2015 and 2017, inclusive. As part of routine diagnostic testing, fecal samples were tested for C. difficile using an ELISA that detects C. difficile antigen (glutamate dehydrogenase) and toxin B (C. diff Quik\n\nChek Complete, TechLab, Blacksburg, Va, USA). During the study period, 1354 fecal samples were tested for C. difficile. Forty-two (3.1%) yielded antigen positive, but toxin negative results. Samples that were antigen positive but toxin negative were further evaluated by enrichment culture. Clostridium difficile was isolated from 22 (54%) antigen positive, toxin negative samples. All 22 recovered isolates were toxigenic, possessing genes encoding toxins A and B.\n\nWhile the clinical relevance of antigen positive, toxin negative results needs further study, foals in this study all had enteritis that could be consistent with CDI, and few had other potential causes of disease identified.\n\nBettina Dunkel -Royal Veterinary College; Edward Knowles -The Royal Veterinary College; Yu-Mei Chang -The Royal Veterinary College; Nicola Menzies-Gow, Reader -The Royal Veterinary College Blood L-lactate concentrations are higher in ponies with gastrointestinal disease than horses, possibly due to differences in body condition (BC) . Therefore correlations between L-lactate concentrations and measures of BC were investigated in healthy horses and ponies. In ponies, the influence of endocrine status on L-lactate concentrations was also investigated. Blood samples were obtained from 101 ponies and 51 horses. Breed, weight, height, measures of BC and L-lactate concentrations were recorded. In ponies, triglyceride and ACTH concentrations were measured and an oral glucose test performed. Correlations between L-lactate and BC parameters were established. The association between L-lactate concentrations, equid type (pony or horse), BC, age, and glucose concentrations was investigated in a multivariable model. Weak (P = 0.001) negative correlations were detected between L-lactate concentration and the average BC score (r = \u22120.29), heart girth: height ratio (r = \u22120.27) and age (r = \u22120.27).\n\nL-lactate and glucose concentrations were weakly correlated (r = 0.15; P = 0.036). In ponies, a weak negative correlation between L-lactate and triglyceride concentrations was detected (r = \u22120.21; P = 0.045) but no other significant correlations with endocrine parameters. In the multivariable model, age (\u22120.02 AE 0.006; P = 0.001) and heart girth: height ratio (\u22121.74 AE 0.53; P = 0.001) were significantly associated with L-lactate. This represents a 2% reduction in L-lactate per year increase in age and 10% reduction in L-lactate per 0.06 unit increase in heart girth: height ratio. Age and BC influence blood L-lactate concentrations significantly but weakly. Prevention and outbreak intervention studies continue to demonstrate the importance of rapid diagnosis. The ability of EHV to spread amongst different wildlife species through the environment, primarily at water holes, was investigated in Africa and Mongolia.\n\nPathogenesis: The impact of EHV-1 infection on early pregnancy loss and blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells was reported, together with immune responses in the nasopharynx, blood and cerebrospinal fluid following experimental EHV-1 infection. EHV-1 infection was also show to induce a procoagulant state in endothelial cells. Transport of EHV-1 to endothelial pathogenesis sites by mononuclear cells and cell-to-cell spread was demonstrated using new flow chamber models.\n\nDiagnostics and Virology:The role of immune biomarkers in the nasopharynx and sera after experimental EHV-1 infection was studied, with a view to identifying immune, protected animals which could be released from quarantine. A LAMP assay differentiating D752 vs N752 (\"neuropathogenic\" vs \"non-neuropathogenic\" biotype) infection has been developed.\n\nInfection Models:Several in vitro models were described to study the interactions between EHV-1 and respiratory epithelium, endothelial cells and PBMC, revealing potentially novel strategies for future therapeutic interventions. In vivo, the impact of EHV-1 infection several months after infection revealed histological changes in several organs, including the nervous system, testes and eyes.\n\nImmunity and Therapy: The importance of intranasal immunity, primarily mediated by IgG isotypes, was described. The impact of EHV-1 gD or ORF2 gene deletion, and D752 vs N752 infection on pathogenesis was reported. Several studies explored the development of cellular immunity, and the role of peptide motifs in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte specificity.\n\nEHV-2 and EHV-5: Both viruses are thought to have a global distribution, but the importance of EHV-5 in rare sporadic disease such as equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis or EHV-2 in respiratory and reproductive disease remains uncertain. New real-time PCR diagnostic tests, in vitromodels, and epidemiology studies were described, including impact of age distribution and co-infection on respiratory disease, and co-infection of gastric mucosa. Hospitalized horses are typically discharged within a few days of admission and subsequent detection of shedding, which increases concerns regarding transmission and prevention in home settings. In order to make best-practice, evidence-based recommendations regarding management of individual horses and populations, we must understand the duration of shedding among affected horses, a vital part of the epidemiology of Salmonella in equine populations. To that end, the objectives of this study were to, 1) characterize the duration of Salmonella shedding among culture-positive horses, 2) describe factors associated with shedding duration, and 3) investigate adverse effects created by exposure of Salmonella-positive horses to their stablemates.\n\nSubclinical and clinically affected horses were cultured weekly for 8 weeks, isolates were phenotypically characterized, and surveys were conducted to determine factors associated with shedding and its impact on stablemates.\n\nIn general, horses that had clinical salmonellosis were more likely to intermittently shed S. enterica in their feces; and to do so for a greater median duration. Mare-foal pairs tended to parallel each other's shedding pattern irrespective of clinical or subclinical shedding.\n\nThe results of this study indicate that horses with clinical salmonellosis likely pose a greater risk for environmental contamination, but that subclinically affected horses may contribute to ongoing transmission, and that on-farm precautions should be taken irrespective of disease status.\n\nGunther van Loon -Equine Cardioteam, Ghent University; Dominique De Clercq -Equine Cardioteam, Ghent University; Annelies Decloedt -Equine Cardioteam, Ghent University; Lisse Vera -Equine Cardioteam, Ghent University; Glenn Van Steenkiste -Equine Cardioteam, Ghent University; C.M. de Bruijn -Wolvega Equine Clinic; Margreet Ploeg -Department of Pathobiology; Willem Back -Utrecht University; Catherine Delesalle -Ghent University; Koen Chiers -Ghent University Aortopulmonary fistulation (APF) is extremely rare in the general horse population but relatively common in Friesian horses. Typically, a transverse tear in the aorta occurs near the remnant of the ligamentum arteriosum, with formation of a fistula towards the pulmonary artery. The fistulation often is a relatively long and irregular shaped tract. A wide range of clinical signs may occur. Tachycardia and right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension are usually present. Often a holosystolic and early diastolic murmur are found dorsal to the aortic valve area. Obtaining good quality cardiac ultrasound images may be challenging in some Friesians due to their body conformation. The purpose of this study was to describe how to take diagnostic ultrasound images of APF, applicable in equine practice. Data from 9 Friesian geldings and 3 mares (mean body weight 591 AE 54 kg) were included. Age ranged from 4 to 12 years (median 5.8). All horses underwent a full echocardiographic exam including 2D, M-mode and color flow Doppler. In addition, specific views were acquired to visualize the APF. All horses showed ultrasound changes compatible with severe pulmonary hypertension and a decrease in aortic size. From the right parasternal left ventricular outflow tract view and right ventricular (RV) inflow-outflow view (Figure 1 ), APF could be visualized in the triangle between right atrium (RA), aorta (Ao) and pulmonary artery (PA) in 8 horses, but lesions were sometimes subtle. Color flow examination from these views did show abnormal flow suggestive for APF in 6 horses. One horse showed an aortic dissection with a circular pseudo-aneurism (cuff) of the entire visible aorta. Left-sided long-axis views of the PA from the third intercostal space were superior to visualize the APF. With cranial (45 ) and slight dorsal (10 ) treatment and after 4 weeks of treatment. A further gastroscopic examination was performed at 2 weeks in IO horses. Anonymised gastroscopy images were reviewed blind to details of treatment. Noninferiority statistics were performed to compare the two treatments with a significant difference between groups being 20% or more.\n\nForty-five horses with EGGD met the inclusion criteria; 33 received IO and 12 received OO. All lesions were within the pyloric antrum and there was no difference in severity between groups. Fifty-six horses with ESGD met the inclusion criteria; 29 received IO and 27 received OO. There was no difference in squamous lesion distribution or grade between the two treatment groups. Treatment failure rates for EGGD and ESGD are presented in Table 1 . Injectable omeprazole was found to be non-inferior to oral omeprazole for healing, but not improvement, of glandular (P = 0.003) and squamous lesions (P < 0.0001). In the IO group there was a significant improvement compared to pretreatment in both EGGD and ESGD lesions within 2 weeks. Given the large differences in failure rates between the two treatments, further investigations with larger numbers are justified to determine whether IO is superior to OO. Medical records from horses admitted on emergency in which stimulation with 0.1 \u03bcg/kg of synthetic ACTH was performed were reviewed.\n\nCIRCI was defined as baseline cortisol cortisol <2.6 \u03bcg/dL or delta cortisol <1.9 \u03bcg/dL. Variables associated with CIRCI, survival, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and presence of ischemic lesions were investigated with P < 0.05 considered significant.\n\nSixty-nine horses were included of which 29% had CIRCI at admission, an additional 14% developed CIRCI during hospitalization, 25% died, 67% had SIRS and 32% had ischemic lesions. At admission, horses with CIRCI had higher ACTH concentrations, lower cortisol, delta cortisol and insulin concentrations and were less likely to survive (P < 0.03). Survivors had lower ACTH and cortisol concentrations at admission and on day 2, higher post-stimulation cortisol on admission and on day 2 and were less likely to have CIRCI, ischaemic lesions or reflux (P < 0.04). Horses with SIRS had higher glucose concentrations (P < 0.01). Horses with ischaemic lesions had higher ACTH, cortisol and glucose concentrations at admission, lower insulin concentrations on day 2 and were more likely to have SIRS and not survive (P < 0.05). No multivariable analysis could be fitted for any outcomes.\n\nCIRCI in adult horses is common, characterized by high ACTH, but low cortisol and low delta cortisol and is associated with non-survival. There is significant interest in understanding the respiratory microbiome; specifically, how certain phenotypes may relate to disease susceptibility in dairy calves. Potential relevance of this data includes improved screening diagnostics and development of respiratory probiotics. While many survey studies have been performed, this is the first study, to the authors' knowledge, to investigate short term effects of an experimental bacterial challenge on the upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota. The purpose and primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether bacterial composition and diversity characteristics of the nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiota were protective against pneumonia following experimental challenge with Pasteurella multocida. The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of bacterial challenge and ampicillin therapy on the NP, tonsillar, tracheobronchial lymph node and lung microbiota of preweaned dairy calves.\n\nA convenience sample of 39 healthy, pre-weaned Holstein bull calves (mean age: 52 AE 6 days) was enrolled in July of 2017 and housed in a BSL-2 laboratory. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. After 7 days of acclimation, calves were examined by clinical respiratory score (RS) and lung ultrasound score (USS); 30 calves with a normal RS and USS were selected for bacterial challenge. On the day before the challenge, a deep NP swab was collected. The next day, calves were sedated and a video laryngoscope was used to pass a catheter into the distal trachea; 25 mL of 10 10 CFU/mL P. multocida was administered. Calves were monitored at intervals by RS and USS; when USS showed significant consolidation, a second deep NP swab was collected and calves were randomized to receive either ampicillin trihydrate (n = 17, label dose x 3 days) or an equal volume and duration of sterile saline (n = 11). Two calves did not develop significant lung consolidation following bacterial challenge, so they were not included in the treatment randomization. Calves were monitored daily via RS and USS for 14 days. On day 14, a third deep NP swab was collected. Calves were then sedated and euthanized; postmortem samples of the NP tonsil, lung, and tracheobronchial lymph nodes were collected. NP swabs and tissue samples were stored in \u221280 C and were processed simultaneously. Following DNA extraction of swabs and 1x1x1 cm sections of tissue, the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using PCR. Libraries were sequenced using Illumina's MiSeq platform and sequences were clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units using Mothur 1.40.0. Taxonomy and diversity data were analyzed in RStudio 1.0.44. Alpha diversity was compared using ANOVA and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Beta diversity was compared using PER-MANOVA tests. Linear regression models were fit to evaluate the effects of pre-challenge NP diversity characteristics on health outcomes. Mixed linear regression models were fit, with calf as a random effect, to evaluate the effect of sample type and ampicillin treatment on diversity metrics of the microbiota. Relative abundance (RA) of bacterial genera were compared using Kruskal Wallis tests.\n\nCalves with higher NP alpha diversity pre-challenge were RS positive less days (P = 0.03) following bacterial challenge, when controlling for serum total protein at 7 days of age and ampicillin treatment during the trial. NP alpha diversity pre-challenge was not associated with USS (P = 0.31). There were no significant differences in alpha diversity among the 3 NP swabs collected (P = 0.30), but alpha diversity was different between the third NP swab and postmortem tissue samples (P = 0.004). The alpha diversity of the third NP swab and postmortem tissue samples was not affected by ampicillin treatment (P = 0.71) or bacterial challenge (P = 0.90). Beta diversity was different between the three NP swabs (P = 0.002) and between the third NP swab and tissue samples (P = 0.001).\n\nPrior to challenge, the top 5 NP genera were Bacteroides sp, Myco- Acinetobacter sp compared to all swabs and tissue samples (P < 0.01).\n\nIn conclusion, increased NP alpha diversity was protective against clinical respiratory disease in challenged calves in this study. Increased RA of Mycoplasma sp was associated with more rapid development of lung lesions, while increased RA of Sharpea sp was associated with slower development of lung lesions following bacterial challenge.\n\nInterestingly, the RA of Pasteurella sp was not affected by antibiotic treatment in NP swabs or postmortem tissue samples. The increased speed of lung lesion development in calves with higher RA of Mycoplasma sp may be related to synergy between the challenge strain and the resident strain of Mycoplasma sp within the NP. Sharpea sp are lactic acid bacteria with potential antagonistic activity against Gram negative infections; this bacterial population may have partially inhibited the growth of the challenge strain.\n\nMulti-drug resistance (MDR) is an emerging issue with Mannheimia haemolytica and a variety of susceptibility testing methods are available for clinical use. The objective of this study was to compare the results of disk diffusion, broth microdilution, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) for susceptibility testing of 48 M. haemolytica isolates collected before and after mass medication with tulathromycin.\n\nEach isolate was subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing with disk diffusion, broth microdilution, and whole genome sequencing.\n\nFor a given antimicrobial, the percentage of isolates classified as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant were compared between the three methods using an exact test of marginal homogeneity. Overall categorical agreement between testing methods ranged from 42-100%, with the lowest agreement being for comparisons of broth microdilution and WGS for penicillin in cattle prior to mass medication. Perfect agreement was found for ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, and gamithromycin for all testing methods in isolates prior to mass medication and for ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, oxytetracycline, gamithromycin, and tilmicosin for all testing methods after mass medication. Very major errors (falsely susceptible) were detected in 3/18 possible comparisons prior to mass medication and 1/18 comparisons after mass medication. Major errors (falsely resistant) and minor errors (all other errors) were detected in 0/18 and 6/18 comparisons prior to mass medication and 1/18 and 6/18 comparisons after mass medication, respectively. The results of this study show that discrepancies in the results of different susceptibility testing methods exist and suggest a need for harmonization of susceptibility testing methods.\n\nDerek Pharmacokinetic studies of drugs in the milk are often limited due to infrequent sampling associated with milking. Alternatively, frequent sample collection with repeated milking may increase drug elimination. Previous work with intravenously administered flunixin has demonstrated that continuously sampling the udder using ultrafiltration is an effective means to address these concerns. The objective of this study was to continuously sample both a healthy and mastitic quarter from cows with naturally occurring mastitis to compare the drug concentrations of intramammary infusions of ceftiofur. An ultrafiltration probe was placed with ultrasound guidance into the gland cisterns of normal and mastitic quarters of ten mature mid-lactation cows (9 Holstein and 1 Jersey cows) with naturally occurring subclinical mastitis.\n\nThe ultrafiltration probe was secured to the caudal or lateral aspect of the udder depending on the quarter being sampled. Ceftiofur hydrochloride (125 mg, Spectramast LC) was infused into both sampled quarters at time 0 and 24 hours. Ultrafiltrate samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 hours post initial drug administration. Each cow was routinely milked by machine every 12 hours, and milk weights were collected.\n\nAn aliquot of milk was collected from the treated quarters immediately prior to milking, during milking, and at the conclusion of milking.\n\nEqual volumes of these aliquots were mixed for assessment of drug concentrations in whole milk. Ceftiofur and its desfuroylceftiofurrelated metabolites were analyzed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS).\n\nMilk samples were aseptically collected from both treated quarters immediately prior to treatment and on days 5, 7, and 14 after treatment for aerobic culture. Samples were obtained from 9/10 healthy quarters and 8/10 infected quarters. In the infected quarters, 3 of 8 were positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS), 2 of 8 were positive for S. aureus, and 1 of 8 were positive for Streptococcus uberis, Aerococcus spp., or Escherichia coli. Six of 8 mastitic quarters were culture negative at the conclusion of the study with one CNS and one S. aureus infection not being eliminated. All healthy quarters remained negative throughout the study. At the conclusion of the ongoing drug analysis, we will determine the impact of mastitis on active ceftiofur concentrations in the udder, and the correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters and treatment outcome. We conclude that collection of ultrafiltration samples from the mammary gland of cows provides a viable means to continuously assess drug concentrations in the milk while continuing to milk the cow normally, and more accurately associate pharmacokinetic parameters with treatment outcomes. Canine degenerative myelopathy (DM) shares similarities with superoxide dismutase 1-associated human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Brain microstructural pathology has been quantified using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in ALS patients. Our objective was to use DTI to characterize neurodegenerative changes in the brain of DM dogs longitudinally and to determine the relationship to clinical severity.\n\nBrain DTI was performed at baseline and every 3 months. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) were calculated on regions of interest in specific white and grey matter areas. Gait scores (0, normal to 14, tetraplegia) were assigned at the time of each scan. DTI values were compared to gait scores and evaluated over time using Pearson correlation and univariate split-plot approach, respectively.\n\nSixteen DM dogs were included; mean age was 9.7 years (1.4) and mean time from onset of signs to first MRI was 5.7 months (3.3).\n\nMean baseline gait score was 4 (1) and mean score change from baseline to last scan was 4.82 (2.67). Fifty-four scans included 9 dogs with We analyzed immunohistochemical expression of FoxP3, PD-L1 and PD-1 in a retrospective series of canine gliomas.\n\nFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 43 gliomas of all types and grades were immunostained for FoxP3, CD3 and CD20. Of these, 18 tumors were additionally stained for PD-L1 and PD-1.\n\nAccumulation of FoxP3+ TILs within the tumor was more pronounced in astrocytic than in oligodendroglial tumors. Mean FoxP3 expression was greater in high-grade gliomas, with significant differences between low-grade oligodendrogliomas and glioblastomas (P = 0.0187).\n\nAll tumors contained PD-L1-expressing cells (>1% positive-TCs).\n\nMean expression increased with grade and was considerably higher in astrocytic tumors. PD-1+ TILs were observed in 16 cases; however, only three tumors with high PD-L1 expression and CD3+ TIL density were considered positive for PD-1 (>1% positive-TILs). There was correlation between PD-L1 and FoxP3 expression (r = 0.47; P = 0.054).\n\nThis is the first study to immunohistochemically characterize FoxP3+\n\nTreg expression and the PD-1-PD-L1 axis in canine gliomas, demonstrating that spontaneous canine glioma models immune evasion in its human counterpart. This supports the use of canine gliomas in translational immunotherapeutic studies. Part 2: Eight dogs received 1-500 mg XRL tablet q 12 h for 10 days.\n\nTimed serum sampling was performed days 3, 7 and 10 at trough 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after tablet administration to observe for individual variation. Neither median Cmax (P = 0.05) nor AUC (P = 0.11) were significantly different across the 3 sampling days, using a Friedman test.\n\nIndividual change in Cmax ranged from 0.5 to 21.4 \u03bcg/mL, with a median decrease in serum levetiracetam concentrations of 2.8 \u03bcg/mL from day 3 to day 7. Median and individual serum levetiracetam concentrations remained above the minimum human therapeutic interval (5 \u03bcg/mL) at all points evaluated. Clinical adverse effects were reported in 3 dogs (38%). In conclusion, 500 mg XRL given twice daily for 10 days resulted in serum concentrations above 5 \u03bcg/mL, with few clinical adverse effects in this small cohort. Furthermore, no significant difference in serum levetiracetam concentrations was noted between the 3 sampling days. Delay between onset of paraplegia and presentation ranged from 30 minutes to 6 days (median 20 hours). Nine dogs definitely recovered to walk voluntarily again, within a mean of 29 days. Five dogs definitely did not recover within 3 months (including one that developed progressive myelomalacia at 4 days and was euthanatized and one that recovered pain sensation and could walk at 5 months) and 4 were irrevocably lost to follow-up within 3 months (including one euthanatized at 14 days because of no change in status). Median delay till presentation was similar for dogs that did (24 hours) and did not (20 hours) recover. Four dogs have not yet completed the 3-month follow-up period.\n\nWhile not strongly conclusive, the results in dogs for which we know the outcome appear promising. A prospective randomized trial to compare outcome of conventional surgery vs conventional surgery plus extended durotomy will be necessary to define the value of this intervention. IL-17A is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that provides protective immunity against numerous infectious pathogens. The variant was absent from the genome database of 648 dogs and from the three other Pneumocystis cases. Six of the 398 banked Miniature Schnauzer samples were heterozygous for the mutation (allele frequency = 0.008).\n\nTwo heterozygotes had recurrent urinary tract infections; the others had no history of infectious disease.\n\nAn IL17A mutation was discovered in a Miniature Schnauzer with Pneumocystis pneumonia. The mutation has incomplete penetrance, which could be due to genetic factors or environmental exposures.\n\nOther genetic immunodeficiencies likely exist in non-Miniature\n\nSchnauzer dogs with Pneumocystis. Partial H sequencing was performed on a subset of samples. A single sample was tested from each of clusters 1 and 2, and those were identical. All 20 samples from cluster 3A were identical, and 99.7% identical to clusters 1 and 2. Three samples from Cluster 3B were identical to cluster 3A, but there was apparent genetic drift (99.9% identity) within a household, with subsequent transmission of that strain. Cluster 4 was distinct from the other three.\n\nDeath attributable to CIV infection occurred in 2/104 (2%) diagnosed cases, both of which were older dogs with underlying diseases. CIV was also suspected in at least one additional death.\n\nCIV was introduced repeatedly to an immunologically na\u00efve population; however, containment measures were apparently effective, demonstrating the potential value of prompt diagnosis and implementation of CIV control measures.\n\nFelipe dos Santos Muniz -UniCare; Fernanda Triani Gomes de Knegt -UniCare Laboratory; Pedro Paulo de Abreu Teles -Minas Gerais Federal University\n\nAllopurinol has been increasingly used for the treatment of canine visceral Leishmaniasis (CVL). The formation of urinary xanthine urolithiasis has been related as a possible complication of allopurinol therapy.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of urolithiasis in dogs naturally infected by L. infantum. Recently, studies have confirmed that diets with a high iP content can negatively impact feline renal health. We hypothesize that calcium is a factor that may influence post-prandial plasma P levels, potentially providing insights on outcomes following long term exposure.\n\n24 healthy neutered cats were fed a single exposure test meal, 50% daily energy requirement, in a 6-way crossover design trial lasting 12 weeks. Diets contained 0.75 or 1.5 g/1000 kcal P from sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) and a calcium to phosphorus ratio (Ca:P) of 1, 1.5 or 2. Post-prandial plasma P, ionized calcium (iCa) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured serially via cephalic catheter.\n\nWelfare and Ethical Review Body.\n\nCompared to a diet with 1.5 g P from STPP/1000 kcal and Ca:P of 1, increasing Ca:P to 1.5 and 2 reduced the peak plasma P concentrations (1.28 and 1.25 mmoL/L v 1.51 mmoL/L, P \u2264 0.029) and the duration of this peak (plasma P returned to baseline at 240mins v 300mins, P < 0.001). In a diet with 0.75 g P from STPP/1000 kcal, increasing Ca:P prevented a peak in plasma P (P \u2265 0.269). PTH followed the same pattern as plasma P.\n\nIncreasing dietary Ca:P can reduce the peak and duration of plasma P and PTH elevation following a meal. Long term feeding trials should confirm whether these measures reduce the risk of adverse kidney changes.\n\nButch Rectal temperatures (previously correlated to analgesia in dogs) were decreased from baseline in both groups from 2-12 hours after drug administration and were not significantly different (P > 0.05) between the groups. Similar methadone plasma concentrations were measured in both groups. Naltrexone-glucuronide was not measured in any Group 1 dog, but measured in all dogs in Group 2 confirming naltrexone administration. Naltrexone (\u22651 ng/mL) was measured in 1 dog at 3 time points and \u03b2-naltrexol (\u22651 ng/mL) was not measured in any dog.\n\nIn conclusion, long-lasting central opioid effects occurred in dogs after oral methadone/fluconazole and when an effective deterrent to human abuse/misuse (naltrexone) was incorporated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of treatment of musculoskeletal pain and inflammation in other species.\n\nWe hypothesized that the NSAID robenacoxib would increase objectively-measured physical activity and improve owner-assessed mobility, pain, quality of life, temperament and happiness in cats with CMSD.\n\nOtherwise healthy cats (n = 109) with CMSD and owner-rated impairment were enrolled in a blinded clinical trial.\n\nAll cats received placebo (p) during a 2-week baseline period, before randomization to receive placebo (P) or robenacoxib (R) for each of two consecutive 3-week treatment periods. Treatment groups were pPP, pRR, and pRP. Activity and subjective owner -assessment data were collected. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects and generalized linear models.\n\nFollowing three weeks of treatment, robenacoxib compared to placebo resulted in a 5.7% increase in overall activity (P = 0.24), a 6.6%\n\nincrease in non-zero activity (P = 0.14), and a 10.0% increase in duskto-dawn activity (P = 0.078). Improvement persisted at six weeks. In within-cat analysis, the percentage of cats with higher activity while receiving robenacoxib than while receiving placebo was 17.2% for all counts (P = 0.058), 22.9% for non-zero counts (P = 0.021) and 20.0%\n\nfor dusk-to-dawn activity (P = 0.035).\n\nRobenacoxib treatment was associated with a 50% decrease in owner-assessed disability, significantly more than with placebo (P \u2264 0.044), following six weeks of treatment. There were significant improvements in temperament (P = 0.0039) and happiness (P = 0.021) with robenacoxib. Adverse effects occurred with similar frequencies between groups<./P>.\n\nThese data demonstrate that robenacoxib is an efficacious treatment for CMSD in cats. HGMS was used to generate in situ molecular fingerprinting from FFPE tissue sections from cats with IBD (n = 19) and SCL (n = 25).\n\nCases were classified as either IBD or SCL based on histopathology and, where indicated, additionally by immunohistochemistry and clonality testing. FFPE tissue sections were deparaffinized, underwent antigen retrieval, and were subjected to on-tissue tryptic digestion.\n\nMass spectra were collected from histopathologically preselected areas of monomorphic or pleomorphic lymphocytic populations (50-\u03bcm target regions).\n\nA linear discriminant analysis classification algorithm was created using the acquired mass spectral data, resulting in 94.3% accuracy when performing a leave-10%-out internal cross validation assessment. A total of 211 peaks were used to build the model, of which, 194 were found to be statistically significant between the two groups after applying a Bonferroni correction. Two significant peaks within the mass spectra underwent further analysis using tandem mass spectrometry and were tentatively identified as beta actin and histone H2A. While expression of beta actin was higher in cats with IBD, histone H2A expression was higher in cats with SCL.\n\nResults indicate that mass spectrometry may be a powerful tool for accurate differentiation of feline SCL and IBD. Further studies are currently in progress to validate these results using an independent larger cohort of samples. Alterations in the microbial community structures were seen in ileal and cecal content compared to baseline, and longitudinally in feces following the 21-day Ursodiol treatment. Specifically, in ileal content, the microbial community structure of the U150 and U450 treatments were significantly different from baseline. In cecal content, the microbial community structure of the U450 treatment was significantly different from baseline. In both ileal and cecal content, members of the Lachnospiraceae family significantly contributed to the alterations observed. Using Random Forest analysis, a significant increase in serum tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and lithocholic acid (LCA) were identified in mice treated with Ursodiol, in a dose dependent manner. In ileal content, UDCA and TUDCA significantly increased in a dose dependent manner. In cecal content, TUDCA and TCDCA were significantly increased.\n\nIn conclusion, Ursodiol administration in conventional mice resulted in significant alterations in the indigenous gut microbial community structure and bile acid metabolome. This study is the first to provide a comprehensive profile of how exogenously administered Ursodiol shapes the intestinal ecosystem. Further studies to investigate how these changes in turn modify the host physiologic response are ongoing. In veterinary medicine, Ursodiol is routinely administered, however the ramifications of how this drug impacts the canine and feline intestinal ecosystem is unknown. Additional studies to elucidate how Ursodiol modifies the gut microbiota-bile acid-host axis in these species is necessary. Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) is the initial rate-limiting step in the pathway for the oxidation of tryptophan to kynurenine.\n\nIDO-1 expression is increased in the gastrointestinal tract of humans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to over-expression of proinflammatory cytokines and over activation of toll-like receptors.\n\nThis increased IDO-1 expression is associated with lower serum tryptophan concentrations in human IBD due to increased tryptophan catabolism. Dogs with protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) have decreased serum tryptophan concentrations compared to apparently healthy dogs. However, IDO-1 expression has not been previously assessed in the intestinal mucosa of dogs with PLE. Therefore, this study aimed to determine if there was a significant difference in mRNA expression of IDO-1 in the duodenal mucosa of dogs with PLE compared to healthy dogs and whether this expression correlated with serum tryptophan concentrations in dogs with PLE.\n\nOur study was a retrospective study using archived paraffinembedded duodenal biopsies from 8 client-owned dogs diagnosed with PLE at the Bristol Veterinary School that previously had serum tryptophan concentrations measured as part of a separate study and 8 healthy Beagle dogs from the Iowa State University Service Colony.\n\nA novel RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) technology, RNAscope was used to hybridize IDO-1 mRNA probe onto at least 10 duodenal biopsy tissue sections from each dog. RNAscope signals (H-score)\n\nwere visualized using a microscope and a single operator performed all quantitative assessment.\n\nDogs with PLE had significantly higher mRNA expression of IDO-1 in the duodenal mucosa compared to healthy control beagle dogs: "}
