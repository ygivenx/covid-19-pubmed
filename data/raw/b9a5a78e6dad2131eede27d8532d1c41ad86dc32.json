{"title": "Antimicrobial activity of chicken and turkey heterophil peptides CHPl, CHP2, THPl, and THP3", "body": "Cationic antimicrobial peptides have been isolated and characterized from plants (Ozaki et al., 1980; Duvick et al., 1992) , insect immune hemolymph or fat body (Kimbrell, 1991) , frog skin (Zasloff, 1987) , mammalian tracheal and intestinal epithelium (Ouelette et al., 1989; Diamond et al., 199 1; Jones and Bevins, 1993) hemocytes of horseshoe crabs ( Muta et al., 1990) , and leukocytes of a number of mammalian species (Lehrer et al., 1993) . They have varying degrees of microbicidal activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, tumor cells, fungi, and enveloped viruses (Lehrer et al., 1993) . This large group of peptides is an important component of innate disease resistance in all classes of animals.\n\nWe recently described the purification of five avian cationic antimicrobial peptides from turkey and chicken heterophil granules. These include Chicken Heterophil Peptides (CHP) 1 and 2, and Turkey Heterophil Peptides (THP) 1, 2, and 3. These peptides belong to a recently described group of chicken antimicrobial peptides termed \"gallinacins\" (Harwig et al., 1994) . The chicken and turkey peptides also share considerable structural similarities with the bovine beta-defensins (Selsted et al., 1993; Harwig et al., 1994) . Chicken Heterophil Peptides 1 and 2, and THPl had bactericidal activity against a pathogenic field isolate of Staphylococcus aureus and a laboratory strain of Escherichia coli K-12 ( ATCC #25922). Turkey Heterophil Peptides 2 and 3 were active against S. aureus but not E. coli (Evans et al., 1994) .\n\nPolymorphonuclear phagocytes (heterophils) of avian species lack myeloperoxidase (Breton-Gorius et al., 1978; MacRae and Powell, 1979) , and have minimal ability to generate an oxidative burst with phagocytosis (Penniall and Spitznagel, 1975) ; therefore, nonoxidative microbicidal mechanisms such as cationic antimicrobial peptides are probably the principle antimicrobial mechanism for leukocytes of these species.\n\nIn the present study, we describe the in vitro antimicrobial activity of four avian heterophil peptides; CHPl and 2, and THPl and 3; against several avian pathogens including Escherichia coli, Bordetella auium, Candida albicans, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, and Pasteurella multocida. We have also tested the antiviral activity of the peptides against an enveloped coronavirus, Infectious Bronchitis Virus. The activity of the peptides against several human pathogens (Salmonella enteriditis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Campylobacter jejuni) which are harbored by birds was also tested.\n\nHeterophils were collected as previously described from sterile peritoneal exudates induced in 6-week-old broiler chickens and turkey poults (n = 80) (Sabet et al., 1977; Harmon et al., 1992) . The granules were separated from the heterophils and peptides were extracted in acetic acid then purified by size exclusion column chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography as previously described (Eisenhauer et al., 1989; Yamashita and Saito, 1989; Selsted et al., 1993) . Four avian peptides, CHP 1 and 2, and THP 1 and 3 (Evans et al., 1994) , were used for the antimicrobial assays described in this study. Peptide purity was assessed by acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by high pressure liquid chromatography (Evans et al., 1994) . Protein concentrations in 0.01% acetic acid were determined by spectrophotometric absorbance at 205 nm. The absorbance was converted to protein concentration ( pg/ml) according to a published procedure (Stoscheck, 1990 (Lockman and Curtiss, 1992) were grown on blood agar plates, transferred to 3% trypticase soy broth (TSB, Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI), and incubated for 18 h at 38\u00b0C. They were then transferred to fresh TSB and grown to the desired optical density for each microorganism immediately prior to the assay.\n\nP. multocida serotype A:3, strain 1059 and a field isolate of B. avium (PDRC, Athens, GA) were grown at 38\u00b0C on blood agar and transferred to 3.7% Brain-Heart Infusion (BHI) (Difco, Detroit, MI) broth for 18-h cultures.\n\nM. galhepticum strain A5969 (PDRC, Athens, GA) (Ahmad et al., 1988) was grown entirely in Frey's liquid medium at 37\u00b0C and 18-h cultures were used in the assay.\n\nC. jejuni strain 8 l-176, which produced diarrhea in humans experimentally (Black et al., 1988) ) was grown on blood agar under microaerobic conditions. Colonies were transferred to a flask containing a solid phase of Brucella agar (Difco, Detroit, MI) beneath a layer of liquid medium consisting of 2.8% Btucella broth (Scott Chemical Co., Fiskeville, RI) with 0.05% ferrous sulfate (Baker Chemical Co., Phillipsburg, NJ), 0.02% sodium bisulfite (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), and 0.05% pyruvic acid (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) added. This culture was incubated for 20 h in 10% carbon dioxide, 5% oxygen and 90% nitrogen at 42\u00b0C prior to performing the assay.\n\nAntibacterial and antifungal activities of the peptides were assessed by a calorimetric assay (Peck, 1985) . Overnight or log-phase cultures of bacteria or C. albicans were washed in sterile 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Concentrations in the sodium phosphate buffer were estimated by spectrophotometric absorbance at 620 nm and then confirmed by standard dilutions and plate counts, with the exception of M. gallisepticum, for which the inoculum density was determined using the Most Probable Number (MPN) technique to measure color changing units. The inocula placed in the wells for each assay are listed in Table 1 . The inoculum for each microbe was adjusted to the lowest concentration for which microbicidal activity could be measured by this assay.\n\nA 50-~1 aliquot of sodium phosphate buffer containing bacteria or C. albicans was pipetted into wells of 96-well tissue culture plates. Peptide solution ( 10 ~1) was then added to these wells in two-fold dilutions from 16 pg/ml to 2 pg/ml (final concentration) in 0.01% sterile acetic acid. All peptides were tested in duplicate. As a positive control, antimicrobial activity of a known microbicidal peptide, protamine sulfate (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), was assessed. The wells were prepared as for the peptide assays, but the two-fold dilutions started with 67 pglml and ended with 0.25 pg/ml in 0.01% acetic acid. Negative control wells consisted of quadruplicate wells containing the bacteria or fungus to which 10 ~1 of 0.01% sterile acetic acid without peptides was added.\n\nA standard curve was obtained by preparing duplicate wells with serial two-fold dilutions of microbes and no peptide (Fig. 1) . The plates were incubated for 1 h at 38\u00b0C. Then 50-100 ~1 of liquid medium was added to all wells, and the plates were incubated for 3 h, or 10 h in the case of C. jejuni. After the incubation in media, 10 ~1 of 3-( 4,5dimethylthiazol-2-y) -2,5diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (M'IT; SigmaChemicalCo.) was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated for 10 to 120 min. Dehydrogenases of viable cells cleave the tetrazolium ring of MTT, which produces formazan, a purple dye. Optical densities at 570 nm were read by an automated micro-plate reader (MR-700; Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, Va.) which constructed standard curves and calculated the relative bacterial or fungal concentrations in the test wells. Serial dilutions of samples from selected test wells were cultured on blood agar plates or, for M. gdisepticum, in liquid medium, to confirm the results of the calorimetric assay. For comparison of antimicrobial activity among peptides, Colonv formina units X lo4 Fig. 1 . Standard curve for Candida albicans. The average optical density of duplicate wells (Y-axis) is plotted a minimum inhibitory concentration was defined as the concentration of peptide required to reduce the bacterial concentration to less than 10% of the original inoculum.\n\nThe antiviral assay was conducted with the Arkansas DPI strain of Infectious Bronchitis Virus, serotype Arkansas (Gelb et al., 1981) . Antiviral activity was determined by incubating virus with peptide, followed by observing cytopathic effects of the virus on chicken embryo kidney cells in vitro. Monolayers of chicken embryo kidney cells were prepared in 96-well tissue culture plates according to established procedures (Schat and Purchase, 1989) . The peptides were dissolved in sterile 0.01% acetic acid at a concentration of 100 pg/rnl and two-fold dilutions to 0.38 pg/ml were made with maintenance medium: F- Grand Island, NY) . The peptide solutions were then incubated for one hour at room temperature with the virus; 50 ~1 of each peptide solution was incubated with 100 ~1 of virus solution containing 2 X lo5 tissue culture infectious doseJO's ml-' of maintenance medium, calculated for the highest dilution causing cytopathic effects in cell culture. The peptidelvirus solutions were added, 75 Fl/well, to a chicken embryo kidney cell monolayer with 125 ~1 of F-1 O-M 199 media containing 3% calf serum. The plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO,. Peptides were tested in duplicate. The plates were examined daily by light microscopy for cytopathic effects ( King and Cavanagh, 199 1) .\n\nAt a concentration of 16 pg/ml, all four avian peptides possessed some degree of microbicidal activity against all of the microorganisms tested (Table 2) . A minimum inhibitory concentration could not be demonstrated at 16 pg/ml for any peptide against P. multocida (Table 2) . However, all of the peptides produced a 70-80% reduction in the concentration of P. multocidu at 16 pg/ml (data not shown). At the maximum concentration, THP3 did not cause a 90% reduction in the survival of B. auium, E. coti, or S. typhimurium (Table 2) . Of the avian peptides tested, THPl required the lowest concentration for inhibition. Protamine inhibited at lower concentrations than the avian peptides against all microorganisms except P. multocida and M. gallisepticum. Even within the narrow range of peptide concentrations tested, a concentration-dependent reduction in bacterial survival was demonstrated (Table 3) .\n\nCytopathic effects including syncytia formation, clustering and swelling of epithelial cells, and grainy cytoplasm were seen in all test wells, indicating minimal to no neutralization of the virus at any concentration by any of the four peptides tested. \n\nThe four peptides derived from avian heterophil granules had a wide spectrum of microbicidal activity, being effective against fungi, a mycoplasma, and a variety of Gram-negative bacteria. Their effectiveness against S. aureus was demonstrated in a previous report (Evans et al., 1994) . The results of these in vitro studies suggest that the avian antimicrobial peptides are important components of heterophil defenses in vivo.\n\nThree peptides, CHPl , CHP2 and THPl, are very similar in primary structure and they are similar in spectrum of microbicidal activity. The two chicken peptides, CHPl and 2, differ only by 4 amino acids in the known N-terminal amino acid sequences. Of the 35 known N-terminal residues for THPI, only I2 are different from the 33 known N-terminal residues of CHP2 (Evans et al., 1994) . Despite the similarities in primary structure and spectrum of activity, these peptides varied somewhat in their relative potencies for different microorganisms, suggesting that slight differences in primary structure may influence interactions with specific target microorganisms. The fourth peptide, THP3, shares less primary structural homology with the other three and appeared less potent against the particular microbes tested. The presence of a variety of antimicrobial granulocyte peptides may be necessary for a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It is also possible that the heterophil peptides may act synergistically in killing microbes. It would be interesting to conduct studies comparing the activity of individual peptides with that of a combination of peptides. These peptides appeared least effective against P. multocidu. This finding supports the findings of a previous study which showed that heterophil lysates were not very effective against P. multocida, yet they were effective against S. aureur and E. coli (Harmon et al., 1992) . However, intact heterophils readily kill P. multocidu (Harmon et al., 1992) . The action of other heterophil components may be required to kill some bacteria.\n\nThe avian peptides were quite effective against the strains of S. typhimurium and C.jejuni which are pathogenic in humans, and were effective against the laboratory strain of S. enteriditis. Future investigations should compare the effectiveness of avian antimicrobial peptides with that of human enteric defensins against these bacteria and more virulent human pathogens. The susceptibility of human pathogens to avian antimicrobial peptides may be a component of the bacteria's ability to exist in the intestinal tracts of poultry without causing disease in their avian hosts.\n\nThe peptides killed laboratory strains of C. albicans and M. gullisepticum. To establish the importance of antimicrobial peptide resistance as virulence factors for C. albicuns and M. gallisepticum, it will be necessary to assess the peptides' activity against highly virulent field strains of these organisms as well.\n\nThe inability of the four peptides to neutralize Infectious Bronchitis Virus may represent viral resistance to peptide neutralization. It is also possible that the higher ionic concentration of the cell medium vs. the buffers used in other assays may have influenced microbicidal activity. Defensins can be less active against bacteria and fungi under high-ionic-strength conditions (Selsted et al., 1984 (Selsted et al., , 1985 .\n\nIn summary, CHPl, CHP2, THPl, and THP3 were bactericidal and fungicidal, but were unable to neutralize Infectious Bronchitis Virus under these experimental conditions. Differences in antimicrobial activity among the peptides may be related to peptide structure, and the presence of a variety of peptides may be necessary for a competent heterophil defense system. The importance of resistance to these peptides as virulence factors for pathogens should be the subject of future studies."}
