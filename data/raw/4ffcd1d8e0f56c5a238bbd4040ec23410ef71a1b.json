{"title": "", "body": "Only a few weeks after the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was noted in Wuhan, China, the first imported case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Korea on January 20, 2020 (1) . International travel has facilitated the spread of COVID-19 throughout the world. As of March 13, 2020, 118 countries, territories, and areas have reported COVID-19 cases, however, differences in patterns and intensity of transmission ranging were observed (2) . In February and early March in Korea, a sharp increase in the number of COVID-19 cases was observed, with most infections in specific cluster and geographic region.\n\nBased on the surveillance data, we report the basic epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in order to understand the early course of the pandemic. Furthermore, we investigated factors associated with deaths to provide evidence on vulnerable population for fatal outcome to guide public health prioritization.\n\nThis is a summary of the first 7,755 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Korea as of March 13, 2020. To obtain demographic, epidemiological, and early clinical information, COVID-19 reporting and surveillance data were retrieved from Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC)-operated National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) (3).\n\nPatient age was provided on the date of diagnosis, and key indicators such as estimated duration of exposure, date of onset of symptoms, and route of transmission were identified by field epidemiological investigators (1) . It must be noted that the data presented in this summary may be changed depending on the results of further epidemiological investigation. All rights reserved.

Figure 4 depicts age-specific epidemic curve stratified as 0-59 years and \u226560 years. The outbreak generally began with younger age group, followed by elderly population.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The median interval between onset of symptom and death was 10 days (range 1-24 days), while the median interval between date of hospitalization and date of death was 5 days (range 0-16 days).\n\nThe analysis of the first 7,755 cases of COVID-19 in Korea showed a first increase of cases in specific geographic region comparable to the epidemiological situation in China and Italy (4, 5) . In Korea, despite a relevant number of cases per week in late February and early March, the peak seemed to have levelled off, yet the first wave did not go away. With descriptive analysis of interim surveillance data, the data suggest that the patient outcome differed markedly between the geographic regions, highlighting the magnitude of surge capacity on access to hospitalitzation.\n\nKorea indicated that important differences could be observed between the geographic region affected by the magnitude of outbreak. Different factors might have played a role: triaging patients for hospitalization, social distancing reducing the number of contacts, and introduction of outbreak among vulnerable population. However, the strict containment strategy in the beginning of the COVID-19 importation phase may have contributed to lower wave in other All rights reserved.

More severe cases were seen in elderly with coexisting condition, which warrants clear triage management and high-risk approach in healthcare access prioritization.\n\nThe COVID-19 seemed not have resulted in fatal outcome among young adults and children, however their role in disease transmission should be studies in near future.\n\nThis summary may help to understand the disease dynamics in the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak, therefore, to guide future public health measures in other countries.\n\nAll rights reserved.
