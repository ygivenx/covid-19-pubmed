{"title": "Murine Coronavirus Spike Glycoprotein Mediates Degree of Viral Spread, Inflammation, and Virus-Induced Immunopathology in the Central Nervous System", "body": "The severity of viral infections depends on the extent of tissue destruction and cellular dysfunction mediated by a combination of direct virus infection and immunemediated destruction. The relative contribution of these two components differs depending on a number of virus and host factors including viral tropism, rate of viral spread, and specificity of the immune response.\n\nInfection of mice with the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), provides a model for studying acute virus-induced neurological disease. We have previously demonstrated that the spike (S) gene is a major determinant of MHV neurovirulence. Recombinant viruses containing the spike gene of the highly neurovirulent MHV-4 strain, S 4 R, exhibit a dramatically more neurovirulent phenotype (3 log 10 decrease in intracranial LD 50 ) than isogenic recombinants containing the spike gene of the mildly neurovirulent MHV-A59 strain, S A59 R (Phillips et al., 1999) . (S A59 R and S 4 R have all other genes derived from MHV-A59.) By defining the contribution of direct virus-mediated pathology and immune-mediated pathology to the differential neurovirulence of S 4 R and S A59 R, we can better elucidate the mechanisms by which the MHV-4 spike confers high neurovirulence.\n\nThe MHV spike glycoprotein is required for viral entry and spread (Boyle et al., 1987; Collins et al., 1982; Stur-man and Holmes, 1981) . Expressed on the virion surface, spike is responsible for binding to the viral receptor and mediating virus-cell fusion, and subsequent to infection spike, expressed on the host cell membrane, can mediate cell-cell fusion. The spike is also vital for the immune response to infection as it is able to induce both a cell-mediated and a humoral-mediated immune response (Bergmann et al., 1996; Castro and Perlman, 1995; Collins et al., 1982) . Thus the high neurovirulence conferred by the MHV-4 spike may be due to alterations in a number of aspects of infection including viral entry, viral spread, or the immune response to infection.\n\nAlthough MHV infects many cell types in the brain, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Knobler et al., 1981; Lavi et al., 1984 Lavi et al., , 1988 Weiner, 1973) , it has been suggested that neuronal tropism is a major determinant of MHV neurovirulence (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982; Fleming et al., 1986; Knobler et al., 1981) . The high neurovirulence of S 4 R is associated with extensive spread of virus in the brain (Phillips et al., 1999) . Increased viral spread could either reflect increased infection of a particular cell-type, such as neurons, or alternatively increased infection of multiple cell types in the CNS.\n\nIn the CNS, clearance of infectious MHV requires multiple components of the immune response including CD8 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 T cells and B cells. Adoptive transfer experiments in combination with depletion experiments have demonstrated that both CD8 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 T cells are critical for normal viral clearance (Korner et al., 1991; Stohlman et al., 1986 Stohlman et al., , 1995 Stohlman et al., , 1998 Sussman et al., 1989; Williamson and Stohlman, 1990; Yamaguchi et al., 1991) . Furthermore, the peak of T lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS is coincident with falling titers of infectious virus in the CNS (Williamson et al., 1991) . Relative to infection with S A59 R, infection with S 4 R results in a dramatic infiltration of inflammatory cells into the CNS (Phillips et al., 1999) . Differences in either the composition of these infiltrates or their virus-specific activity could have a profound influence on neurovirulence.\n\nThe MHV spike is a major determinant of MHV neurovirulence. To identify the critical parameters of infection mediating the differential neurovirulence of S 4 R and S A59 R, we characterized the cellular tropism and composition and function of the lymphocytic response to infection with S 4 R and S A59 R. Our results suggest that the high neurovirulence conferred by alterations in the MHV spike are mediated by both increased viral spread in multiple cell types in the brain and immune-mediated pathology.\n\nWe previously observed that at the peak of virus replication, day 5 postinfection, the more neurovirulent S 4 R infects a significantly greater number of cells in the basal FIG. 1. Identification of S 4 R-and S A59 R-infected neurons in the brain 5 days after intracranial inoculation. Representative pictures are shown of double-immunofluorescent labeling of sagittal brain sections taken from S 4 R-inoculated (A and B), and S A59 R-inoculated (C and D) mice. A and C show immunofluorescent labeling of viral antigen in the basal forebrain (red). B and D show the corresponding labeling of MAP2b in neurons (green). Note MAP2b-positive cells exhibit the characteristic morphology of neurons. Arrows identify cells double-positive for viral antigen, and MAP2b in both S 4 R and S A59 R inoculated brains. Note the greater total number of viral antigen-positive cells following inoculation with S 4 R. No viral antigen staining was observed in mock-infected mice, when sections were incubated in preimmune sera, or when the primary antibody was omitted (data not shown). Magnification, \u03eb380.\n\nQuantification of viral antigen positive cells in the brain following inoculation with S 4 R and S A59 R. The total number of viral antigen-positive cells per brain section following infection with S 4 R (open squares), and S A59 R (open diamonds) was determined on days 3 and 5 postinfection. On day 5 postinfection two brain sections per mouse were examined, and the mean number of viral antigen-positive cells per sagittal section was determined (n \u03ed 5). For the quantification of viral antigen-positive cells on day 3 a single sagittal section was examined for each infected mouse (n \u03ed 4). The mean number of viral antigen-positive cells per brain section (horizontal line) following infection with S 4 R was significantly greater than with S A59 R on days 3 and 5 postinfection (two-tailed t test, P \u03fd 0.05, and P \u03fd 0.001, respectively). forebrain, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus than S A59 R (Phillips et al., 1999) . Increased infection could reflect differences in viral spread in a single cell type or in multiple cell types. To quantitatively compare the cellular tropism of S 4 R and S A59 R, we performed double-label immunofluorescence on sagittal brain sections for viral Group mean (21.0) a Mice were inoculated intracranially with 10 PFU of either S 4 R or S A59 R. Animals were sacrificed on day 5 postinfection and perfused, and the brain was fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned sagittally. Section 1 and 2 are adjacent.\n\nb The slides were double-immunostained with anti-MHV-A59 serum and AP14, a monoclonal antibody to MAP2b, or a mouse anti-GFAP antibody. Sagittal sections were coded and systematically examined in a blinded fashion (magnification \u03eb190), and the total number of viral antigen-positive cells and double-positive cells per section was determined. The (%) is the percentage of the total number of viral antigen positive cells counted that were also positive for the indicated marker. antigen and MAP2b, a neuron-specific marker (De Camilli et al., 1984; Riederer et al., 1995) , or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocyte-specific marker. Mice were inoculated intracranially with 10 PFU of S 4 R or S A59 R and animals were sacrificed at 3 and 5 days postinfection.\n\nThe sections were systematically scanned (magnification, \u03eb190) in a blinded fashion, and the total number of viral antigen-positive and double-positive cells was determined. Representative pictures of double-immunofluorescence for viral antigen and MAP2b are shown ( Fig.  1 ). On days 3 and 5 postinfection, the mean number of viral antigen-positive cells per brain section was significantly greater following infection with S 4 R than S A59 R (two-tailed t test, day 3, P \u03fd 0.05, and day 5, P \u03fd 0.001) (Fig. 2) . The pattern of viral antigen expression in the brain was similar following infection with S 4 R or S A59 R.\n\nDespite the difference in the absolute number of infected cells, S 4 R had a similar cellular tropism as S A59 R. As shown in Table 1 , we found that the percentage of viral antigen-positive cells that were also positive for neuronal or astrocytic markers was remarkably similar for S 4 R and S A59 R. On day 5 postinfection, neurons appeared to account for approximately 53% of either S 4 R-or S A59 R-infected cells, while astrocytes accounted for approximately 20 or 21% of S 4 R-or S A59 R-infected cells, respectively. Thus the increased neurovirulence of S 4 R correlated with increased infection of multiple CNS celltypes, including both neurons and astrocytes. Viral spread of S 4 R and S A59 R differs in primary neuronal cultures\n\nThe extent of neuronal infection is thought to be a determinant of MHV neurovirulence (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982; Fleming et al., 1986; Knobler et al., 1981) . As an in vitro model of CNS infection and to examine the ability of S 4 R and S A59 R to spread in neurons, we infected primary hippocampal neuron cultures obtained from B6 mice with the two viruses. Immunostaining for MAP2 and GFAP demonstrated that the cultures consisted primarily of neurons with less than 8% of the cells exhibiting GFAP immunoreactivity (data not shown). On days 0, 1, and 3 after infection, supernatants were titered for infectious virus and the number of viral antigen-positive cells was determined by immunofluorescence. Neurons did not exhibit cytopathic effect for the duration of the experiment as assessed by bright-field microscopy.\n\nTo compare the number of cells infected with each virus, we used immunofluorescence to detect viral antigen expression. S 4 R and S A59 R infection of neurons was confirmed by cell morphology and by double-immunostaining for viral antigen and MAP2 (Fig. 3 ). Viral antigenpositive cells were often located in discrete foci. Moreover, viral antigen-positive neurites could often be observed between infected cells or between foci of infected cells, suggesting that perhaps one means of viral spread in these cultures was along neurites. To examine the pattern of viral spread in these cultures, we determined the total number of viral antigen-positive cells and the total number of foci of infected cells per coverslip at different time points (Table 2) . On day 1 postinfection the average number of foci and the total number of antigenpositive cells was similar following infection with S 4 R and S A59 R. On day 3 postinfection, although the average number of foci was similar, the average number of viral antigen-positive cells was significantly greater following infection with S 4 R than S A59 R (two-tailed t test, P \u03fd 0.01). Thus, on day 3 the number of viral antigen-positive cells per focus was greater for S 4 R, 5.79 \u03ee 1.15, than S A59 R, 3.17 \u03ee 1.59 (mean \u03ee SD). The difference in the number of infected cells, despite a similar number of foci, between S 4 R and S A59 R, suggested that S 4 R spread faster via cell-cell spread than S A59 R. Thus, the results in primary neuronal cultures were consistent with the results in vivo and suggested that the MHV-4 spike conferred an inherent ability to spread rapidly from cell to cell in the CNS.\n\nConsistent with previous studies in which primary neuronal cultures were infected with MHV (Dubois- Dalcq et al., 1982; Pasick et al., 1994) , the amount of infectious virus released into the media was minimal. Following infection with S 4 R or S A59 R, the titers of infectious virus in the supernatants initially dropped, day 0 to day 1 postinfection, and then remained the same from day 1 to day 3 postinfection ( Table 2 ). The inactivation of infectious virus in the residual inoculum most likely accounted for the precipitous drop in b Supernatants from infected cultures were collected at the indicated times and viral titers were determined on L2 cells. The titers are the mean titers from two independent experiments (n \u03ed 6). c A group of viral antigen-positive cells that appeared to exhibit cell-cell contact was defined as a focus. The data shown represent the results from two independent experiments (n \u03ed 4).\n\nd The total number of viral antigen-positive cells per coverslip was determined (n \u03ed 4, except on day 3 following infection with S 4 R, n \u03ed 3). On day 3 the mean number of viral antigen-positive cells was greater following infection with S 4 R than S A59 R (two-tailed t test, P \u03fd 0.01). viral titers from day 0 to 1 postinfection. On days 1 and 3, the titers of infectious virus were lower in S 4 R-infected cultures than S A59 R-infected cultures.\n\nThe MHV-4 spike appears to mediate more efficient spread in cells of the CNS than the MHV-A59 spike. Previously we observed a difference in the immune response to infection with S 4 R and S A59 R by H&E staining. S 4 R infection induced a greater infiltration of inflammatory cells into the brain than S A59 R infection (Phillips et al., 1999) . The immune response to MHV infection is complex, and multiple components of the immune response are required for optimal clearance of infectious virus from the CNS. Therefore, both quantitative and qualitative differences in the antiviral immune response may also contribute to the differential neurovirulence of S 4 R and S A59 R.\n\nWe used flow cytometry to quantitatively compare the composition of the immune response in the brain to infection with S 4 R and S A59 R. Total brain mononuclear cells were isolated on days 5 and 7 postinfection and were examined for surface expression of CD45 (a marker of nucleated cells of hematopoietic lineage), CD8, CD4, and B220.\n\nAt the peak of inflammation, day 7 postinfection, the difference in the total number of inflammatory cells in the brain between S 4 R and S A59 R was dramatic. The number of immune cells, as determined by CD45 positivity, isolated from each brain following S 4 R and S A59 R infection was between 1.2 \u03eb 10 6 and 1.1 \u03eb 10 7 cells and was on average fivefold greater following infection with S 4 R than S A59 R. Representative data are shown in Fig. 4 . Flow analysis of brain-derived lymphocytes revealed that the percentage of CD8 \u03e9 T cells was also greater following infection with the more neurovirulent S 4 R as compared with S A59 R (Fig. 4B ). In contrast, the percentage of cells positive for CD4 or B220 (a B cell marker) was similar following infection with S 4 R and S A59 R. We next examined the ratio of CD8 \u03e9 to CD4 \u03e9 T cells for S 4 R and S A59 R from four independent experiments. The mean ratio of CD8 \u03e9 to CD4 \u03e9 T cells following infection with S 4 R, 2.83 \u03ee 0.26 (mean \u03ee SEM), was significantly greater than the ratio following infection with S A59 R, 1.73 \u03ee 0.06 (mean \u03ee SEM) (two-tailed t test, P \u03fd 0.01) (n \u03ed 4). Due to the difference in total cells isolated per brain, the estimated numbers of CD45 \u03e9 , CD4 \u03e9 , CD8 \u03e9 , and B220 \u03e9 cells per mouse brain were between three-and fivefold greater following infection with S 4 R than with S A59 R (Fig. 4C) . Thus, the high neurovirulence of S 4 R relative to S A59 R was correlated with a greater total number of mononuclear cells in the brain, and a significant increase in the percentage of CD8 \u03e9 T cells.\n\nOn day 5 following infection with either S 4 R or S A59 R, the magnitude of the inflammatory response to infection in the brain was much less than on day 7 postinfection as previously observed by Haring et al. (2001) and Williamson et al. (1991) . In addition, the numbers of CD8 \u03e9 or CD4 \u03e9 T cells in the brain were just above the level of detection. Even on day 5 postinfection, however, the number of immune cells in the brain following infection with S 4 R was still greater than following S A59 R infection (data not shown).\n\nFunctional differences in the T cell response to infection with S 4 R and S A59 R\n\nIn addition to differences in the magnitude and in the composition of the immune response to infection with S 4 R and S A59 R, we hypothesized that there might be differences in the function of MHV-specific T cells. To compare the frequency of functionally activated, MHV-specific CD8 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 T cells in the CNS following infection with S 4 R or S A59 R, we performed intracellular IFN-\u2425 assays. Brain-derived T cells on day 7 postinfection were isolated and challenged with peptides containing the immunodominant or sub-immunodominant CD8 \u03e9 T cell epitope, S510 or S598, or the immunodominant CD4 \u03e9 T cell epitope, M133, and stained for intracellular IFN-\u2425 as described previously (Murali-Krishna et al., 1998) .\n\nRepresentative results are shown in Fig. 5 . Following S 4 R infection, approximately 13.6 and 9.3% of the CD8 \u03e9 T cell population in the CNS was S510-specific and S598specific, respectively. S510 and S598 are the only two known CD8 \u03e9 T cell epitopes for MHV; therefore, the total frequency of MHV-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the CNS following S 4 R infection was approximately 22.9%. The MHV-A59 spike lacks the immunodominant S510 epitope (Luytjes et al., 1987) . Thus, following infection with S A59 R the MHV-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cell response was S598-specific and accounted for approximately 11.8% of the CD8 \u03e9 T cell response.\n\nWithin the population of cells isolated from the CNS, a proportion of CD4 \u03e9 cells exhibited intracellular IFN-\u2425 in the absence of peptide (Fig. 5B) . The reason for this background level of IFN-\u2425 expression is not known; however, it has been suggested that infected microglia and macrophages in the CNS cell preparation may stimulate CD4 \u03e9 T cells (Haring et al., 2001) . The frequency of M133-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells following infection with S 4 R or S A59 R was similar, accounting for approximately 16.0 and 15.4% of the CD4 \u03e9 T cell response, respectively. As this may overestimate the frequency of MHV-specific cells in the CNS, we also subtracted the percentage of IFN-\u2425-expressing cells in the absence of peptide from the total percentage of IFN-\u2425-expressing cells after peptide stimulation. The calculated frequency of M133-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells following infection with S 4 R, 10.6%, and S A59 R, 8.9%, was also similar. Thus, infection with either S 4 R or S A59 R resulted in a robust CD8 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 T cell response that was both epitope-specific and functional. The major difference between the frequency of virusspecific T cells induced by S 4 R and S A59 R was the increased frequency of functionally activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells following infection with the more neurovirulent S 4 R. Note that due to the increased numbers of inflammatory cells in the brain following S 4 R infection relative to S A59 R infection, the total number of virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 T cells in the brain was greater following infection with S 4 R than S A59 R.\n\nContribution of lymphocytes to differential neurovirulence S 4 R infection resulted in a greater number of lymphocytes and a higher frequency of virus-specific immune FIG. 4 . Lymphocyte populations in the brain following inoculation with S 4 R and S A59 R. Mice were infected with S 4 R or S A59 R and animals were sacrificed at the peak of inflammation, day 7 postinfection. (A) The upper row depicts the forward scatter and side scatter characteristics of representative mononuclear cell preparations from the brains of S 4 R-and S A59 R-infected mice. Surface expression of CD45 was used to assist in the gating of mononuclear cells, and representative flow cytometry density plots showing expression of CD45 (x-axis) and CD8 (y-axis) in S 4 R-infected mice (left lower row) and S A59 R-infected mice (right lower row). Numbers in the upper right quadrants represent the percentage of CD8 \u03e9 CD45 \u03e9 monocytes, and the numbers in the right lower quadrant represent the percentage of CD8 \u03ea CD45 \u03e9 monocytes. (B) Relative percentages of CD8 \u03e9 , CD4 \u03e9 , and B220 \u03e9 cells in brain-derived monocytes. (C) Absolute numbers of total cells, CD45 \u03e9 , CD8 \u03e9 , CD4 \u03e9 , and B220 \u03e9 cells in cell preparations from the brain. Mononuclear cell preparations from six mice were pooled, and the results are representative of four independent experiments. A smaller number of cells (6.6 \u03eb 10 5 cells per brain) were obtained from mock-infected mice with only 4% of these CD45 \u03e9 . cells in the CNS than S A59 R infection. To evaluate the contribution of lymphocytes to the differential neurovirulence observed with S 4 R and S A59 R, we compared the survival of infected RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea mice (B6 background), which lack functional T and B cells (Mombaerts et al., 1992) , and immunocompetent B6 mice. RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea mice infected with S A59 R experienced 100% mortality while immunocompetent mice survived following challenge with S A59 R (Fig. 6A) . Thus, S A59 R-infected immunocompetent B6 mice are protected from death by the activated immune response, and without this response the mice succumb to a lethal infection. In contrast, RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea mice infected with S 4 R exhibited prolonged survival relative to immunocompetent B6 mice: the median survival time for S 4 R-infected mice was 13 days in RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea and 10 days in B6 mice (statistically different, Mann-Whitney rank sum test, P \u03fd 0.0001) (Fig. 6B) . Prolonged survival in S 4 R-infected RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea mice suggested that T or B cells contributed to pathology.\n\nWe examined virus titers in the brain and other organs of RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea mice. At five days postinfection, the titers of infectious virus in the brains of RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea mice were similar to those in B6 mice, following S A59 R infection 6.0 vs 5.4 and following S 4 R infection 5.1 vs 5.1 [log 10 (PFU/g)] (n \u03ed 2), respectively. In addition, similar to the infection in immunocompetent mice the level of infectious virus was minimal in the liver and undetectable in the spleen, kidney, lung, heart, and a portion of the small intestine FIG. 5. MHV-specific CD8 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 T cells following infection with S 4 R and S A59 R. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the brain of S 4 R-and S A59 R-infected mice on day 7 postinfection, and the frequency of CD8 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 T cells specific for MHV-specific epitopes were determined by intracellular IFN-\u2425 staining. Cells were cultured with or without peptide as indicated above each column. The numbers in the upper right quadrants indicate the percentage of CD8 \u03e9 T cells (A) or CD4 \u03e9 T cells (B) that are positive for the intracellular IFN-\u2425 stain following infection with either S 4 R (top row) or S A59 R (bottom row). The numbers in the right lower quadrants represent the percentage of CD8 \u03e9 T cells (A) or CD4 \u03e9 T cells (B) that are negative for the intracellular IFN-\u2425 stain. Brain mononuclear cells were pooled from six to eight animals, and these data are representative of two to five experiments.\n\n(data not shown). Unlike B6 mice, which clear infectious virus early in infection, by day 13 postinfection with S 4 R or S A59 R there were high levels of infectious virus in the brain. Infectious virus remained localized to the CNS following S 4 R infection, but mice infected with S A59 R had high titers of virus in the spleen and liver at late times postinfection (data not shown). Thus, following infection with S A59 R the acquired immune response was critical for viral clearance in the brain, protection from viral spread to other organs, and protection from subsequent death. In contrast, S 4 R-infected RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea mice displayed prolonged survival despite persistent, high titers of infectious virus in the CNS, suggesting that immune-mediated pathology may contribute to the highly neurovirulent phenotype of S 4 R.\n\nThe spike glycoprotein is a major determinant of MHV neurovirulence. We examined how alterations in spike affect neuropathogenesis using S 4 R and S A59 R, two iso-genic recombinant viruses that differ exclusively in spike. To identify the parameters of MHV infection mediated by spike and important in neurovirulence, we compared the cellular tropism of S 4 R and S A59 R and both quantitative and functional features of the immune response to infection. Our studies suggest that differences in viral spread in multiple cell types, differences in the magnitude of the immune response to infection, and immune-mediated pathology contribute to the differential neurovirulence of S 4 R and S A59 R. We have shown previously (Phillips et al., 1999 (Phillips et al., , 2001 ) that, during acute infection, the titers of infectious virus in the brains of animals infected with S 4 R and S A59 R are similar. Thus, the spread of viral antigen, neurovirulence, and mortality are not determined by the level of infectious virus in the CNS.\n\nNeuronal infection has been proposed to be a major determinant of MHV neurovirulence (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982; Fleming et al., 1986; Knobler et al., 1981) . Using double-immunohistochemistry, we quantitatively compared the tropism of S 4 R and S A59 R for neurons and astrocytes. We determined that on days 3 and 5 postinfection, S 4 R infected a greater total number of cells than S A59 R throughout the brain. Despite the difference in viral spread, however, the tropism of S 4 R and S A59 R for neurons and astrocytes was identical. Thus differences in viral spread, not differences in neuronal tropism per se, contributed to the differential neurovirulence of S 4 R and S A59 R.\n\nDespite the similarity in neuronal tropism, however, the number of infected neurons was greater following infection with S 4 R than S A59 R due to the greater total number of cells infected. To compare the ability of S 4 R and S A59 R to spread in cells from the CNS, we examined the infection of primary hippocampal neuron cultures. S 4 R infection of neuronal cultures resulted in greater viral spread than S A59 R infection, and the pattern of spread suggested that S 4 R spreads more rapidly from cell to cell than S A59 R. Viral spread along neuronal processes could contribute to rapid dissemination of virus to multiple regions of the brain. Future studies will address how the MHV-4 spike confers rapid cell to cell spread, and the effect of infection on neuronal viability.\n\nIn addition to increased viral spread, S 4 R mediated a greater influx of immune cells into the CNS than S A59 R. To identify how this increased immune response to infection might influence the differential neurovirulence of S 4 R and S A59 R, we compared the composition and the function of the lymphocytic response to infection. At the peak of inflammation, day 7 after infection, the more neurovirulent S 4 R induced the infiltration of a greater number of T cells and B cells into the CNS with a specific increase in the percentage of CD8 \u03e9 T cells as compared to S A59 R.\n\nWe also compared the virus-specific activity of CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells from the CNS of animals infected with S 4 R and S A59 R by measuring intracellular IFN-\u2425 secretion Following inoculation with S 4 R (B), there was a significant difference in the median time to death between RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea and B6-infected mice (13 and 10 days, respectively, Mann-Whitney rank sum test, P \u03fd 0.0001). Although not shown on the graph, all RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea mice inoculated with S 4 R died by 43 days postinfection. No deaths were observed in B6 mice after 19 days postinoculation. The data shown represent the results from two independent experiments from a total of 14 RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea mice per virus, 11 B6 mice inoculated with S A59 R, and 15 B6 mice inoculated with S 4 R. in response to specific viral epitopes. Both S 4 R and S A59 R induced robust and virus-specific immune responses; however, there were differences in the specificity of the CD8 \u03e9 T cell response. The two H-2 b CD8 \u03e9 T cell epitopes recognized in B6 mice are located in the spike glycoprotein at residues 510-518 (S510) and 598-605 (S598) (Bergmann et al., 1996; Castro and Perlman, 1995) . A 52 amino acid deletion in the spike of MHV-A59 relative to the spike of MHV-4 removes the more immunodominant 510-518 epitope (Luytjes et al., 1987; Parker et al., 1989) . Consistent with this difference in epitopes, the frequency of S510-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the CNS was high following S 4 R infection and undetectable following S A59 R infection. The lack of the S510 epitope in S A59 R did not appear to induce a significantly greater immune response to S598, however, as the frequency of S598specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the CNS following infection with S 4 R or S A59 R was similar. The two viruses also shared a similar frequency of response to the dominant CD4 \u03e9 T cell epitope (Xue and Perlman, 1997) , M133, located within the viral matrix protein.\n\nThus, expression of the S510 epitope was responsible for the greatest difference in the frequencies of virusspecific, functionally activated T cells following infection with S 4 R and S A59 R. S 4 R infection induced a greater percentage of CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the CNS than S A59 R infection. The response to the S510 epitope in the S 4 R spike may at least partially account for this increase in the frequency of CD8 \u03e9 T cells. Interestingly, mutations in the S510 epitope in a related MHV-JHM strain have been associated with alterations in neuropathogenesis (Pewe et al., 1998) . However there are other factors that may contribute. For example, quantitative differences in antigen presentation or differences in the ability of immune cells to traffic to and proliferate in the CNS following infection with S 4 R and S A59 R may contribute to differences in the percentage of CD8 \u03e9 T cells and to the overall magnitude of the antiviral immune response. Furthermore the percentage of total CD8 \u03e9 T cells among CNS lymphocytes (Fig. 4) may include CD8 \u03e9 cells specific for epitopes other than S510 and S598, perhaps host epitopes. Future experiments will address the role of this epitope in the differential neurovirulence of S 4 R and S A59 R.\n\nTo examine the role of the T and B cell response to infection in the differential neurovirulence of S 4 R and S A59 R, we compared the virulence of these viruses in the presence and absence of a functional T and B cell response. Despite prolonged replication of infectious S 4 R in the CNS of RAG\u03ea/\u03ea mice, these mice exhibited prolonged survival relative to immunocompetent mice. In contrast, the T and B cell response to S A59 R infection was primarily protective. These data suggest that immunemediated pathology contributes to the high neurovirulence of S 4 R. Interestingly, previous studies with MHV have also suggested that, in addition to its role in pro-tection, the inflammatory response, particularly the T cell response, can be immunopathologic. Prolonged survival of perforin-deficient mice infected with a JHM strain of virus suggested that CD8 \u03e9 CTLs might contribute to disease (Lin et al., 1997) . Moreover, CD4 \u03e9 T cells have also been implicated in immunopathology; both adoptive transfer experiments with CD4 \u03e9 T cells and infection of CD4 \u03e9 knockout mice have suggested that CD4 \u03e9 T cells in the CNS may increase disease morbidity (Lane et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2000) . To determine whether CD8 \u03e9 or CD4 \u03e9 T cells were primarily responsible for the prolonged survival in RAG\u03ea/\u03ea mice, we compared the survival of CD8\u03ea/\u03ea, CD4\u03ea/\u03ea, and immunocompetent B6 mice infected with S 4 R; however, the absence of either T cell subset alone did not confer significantly increased survival (data not shown).\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated the complexity of the immune response to MHV and the requirement for multiple components for clearance (Korner et al., 1991; Stohlman et al., 1986 Stohlman et al., , 1995 Stohlman et al., , 1998 Sussman et al., 1989; Williamson and Stohlman, 1990; Yamaguchi et al., 1991; Bergmann et al., 2001) . Our results suggest that MHVinduced immunopathology is also complex and involves multiple components of the immune response to infection. Studies with LCMV and HIV have suggested that virus strains that exhibit rapid viral spread are associated with increased immune-mediated pathology (Wodarz and Krakauer, 2000; Moskophidis et al., 1995) . Future studies will delineate which components of the immune response to S 4 R contribute to immunopathology and examine how increased viral spread may induce such a response.\n\nIncreased neurovirulence conferred by the MHV-4 spike correlates with both rapid viral spread in the CNS and immune-mediated pathology. By studying two isogenic viruses with defined alterations in spike in in vivo infections and in in vitro models of MHV infection, we can begin to dissect the different roles of the spike glycoprotein in neurovirulence. Furthermore, we can examine the contribution of virus-and immune-mediated pathology to neurovirulence.\n\nThe recombinant viruses, referred to as S 4 R (containing the MHV-4 spike gene) or S A59 R (containing the MHV-A59 spike gene), were generated using targeted RNA recombination and are in the MHV-A59 background (Fischer et al., 1997) . We have in the past described independent isolates of both S 4 R (S 4 R22 and S 4 R29) and S A59 R [S A59 R13 (wtR13) and S A59 R16] (Phillips et al., 1999 (Phillips et al., , 2001 . Since the group of recombinant viruses expressing the MHV-4 spike gene are phenotypically indistinguishable from each other, they will be referred to collectively as S 4 R; similarly, since the group of viruses expressing the A59 spike gene are phenotypically indistinguishable from each other, they will be referred to collectively as S A59 R. All viral stocks were grown in 17Cl-1 cells, and infectious virus was quantified by plaque assay, using murine L2 cells as indicator cells.\n\nFour-week old male C57Bl/6 (B6) mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD), and four-week old male RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). No mature B or T lymphocytes are produced in RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea mice (Mombaerts et al., 1992) . All mice were certified MHV-free. Mice were anesthetized with Isoflurane (IsoFlo; Abbott Laboratories), and injections were performed in the left cerebral hemisphere. Each injection contained 10 PFU of virus diluted to a volume of 20 l per mouse in PBS containing 0.75% bovine serum albumin. Mock-infected controls were inoculated similarly but with an uninfected 17Cl-1 cell lysate at a comparable dilution.\n\nAt various times after infection with S 4 R or S A59 R, mice were sacrificed and perfused with 10 ml of PBS, and the brains were removed. The right half of the brain was fixed in Formalin for 2 days, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and left unstained for immunofluorescence. Adjacent sagittal brain sections close to midline, 10-20 m apart, were examined. Sections were blocked with 2% goat serum in Tris-HCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h, incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h. All incubations were carried out in a humidified chamber at 37\u00b0C, and after each step the sections were washed (three times for 5 min each) in PBS. For localization of viral antigen, sections were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-MHV-A59 serum, made against detergent-disrupted MHV-A59, obtained from Mark Denison (Vanderbilt University, TN). Neurons were identified with a 1:50 dilution of mouse monoclonal antibody AP14 (Geisert et al., 1990) , which recognizes the MAP2b protein (De Camilli et al., 1984; Riederer et al., 1995) , obtained from Virginia M.-Y. Lee (University of Pennsylvania, PA). Astrocytes were identified with a 1:50 dilution of a mouse monoclonal antiglial fibrillary acidic protein (PharMingen). Rabbit antibodies were detected with a 1:40 dilution of TRITCconjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Dako Corp.). Murine antibodies were detected with a 1:100 dilution of biotin-conjugated horse anti-mouse immunoglobulins followed by treatment with a 1:200 dilution of Fluorescein Avidin D (FITC) for 30 min, purchased from Vector Laboratories.\n\nControl slides were incubated in parallel with preim-mune rabbit serum, and sections from mock-infected animals were incubated with rabbit anti-MHV-A59 serum. For each double-immunostaining scheme, it was verified that the secondary antibody did not bind in the absence of the primary antibody or cross-react with primary antibodies of different species.\n\nPrimary hippocampal neurons were obtained from day 14 to day 16 embryonic mice, as described previously (Banker and Goslin, 1991; Pasick et al., 1994; Rall et al., 1997) , except the cells were maintained in neurobasal medium (Gibco/BRL) containing 4 g/ml glutamate, in the absence of an astrocyte feeder layer. The mice used in these experiments were C57Bl/6 transgenic mice expressing the human MV receptor, CD46 (Rall et al., 1997) . Cells were plated at a density of 2-7 \u03eb 10 5 cells per glass coverslip.\n\nOn day 4 postexplant, cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5 with S 4 R or S A59 R or mockinfected with 17Cl-1 cell lysate. After 1 h at 37\u00b0C with gentle agitation, the inoculum was removed; conditioned neurobasal medium was added back to the cultures, and the cultures were maintained at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 until harvesting. In each of two independent experiments three coverslips were infected per virus per time point.\n\nThe levels of infectious virus in the supernatants as a function of time following infection were determined by plaque-assay on L2 cell monolayers. For the localization of viral antigen coverslips containing infected cells were washed once with PBS, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, and stored at 4\u00b0C. Coverslips were blocked with 2% goat serum in Tris-HCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h. Between each step the coverslips were washed in Tris-HCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 six times, and all incubations were carried out at room temperature in a humidified chamber. To detect viral antigen coverslips were incubated with a 1:20 dilution of mouse antinucleocapsid antibody, obtained from Julian L. Leibowitz (Texas A&M University, TX). This was followed by incubation with the secondary antibody, a 1:200 dilution of biotin-conjugated horse anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Vector Laboratories), and then incubation with a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein avidin D (FITC) (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min. MAP2 and GFAP were detected with a 1:300 dilution of rabbit anti-MAP2 obtained from Virginia M.-Y. Lee (University of Pennsylvania, PA) and a 1:250 dilution of rabbit anti-cow glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Dako Corp.), respectively. Rabbit antibodies were detected with a 1:40 dilution of TRITCconjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Dako Corp.). Mock-infected coverslips were incubated in parallel with mouse antinucleocapsid antibodies. Coverslips mounted on slides were blinded and systematically examined by fluorescence and bright-field microscopy (magnification, \u03eb190 and \u03eb380).\n\nMonocytes were prepared from the CNS as previously described by Pewe et al. (1999) on days 5 and 7 after intracranial inoculation with 10 PFU of S 4 R or S A59 R or mock-infected with 17Cl-1 cell lysate. Two to six brains were pooled per sample. In brief, animals were sacrificed and perfused with 10 mL of PBS, and a single-cell suspension from the brain was obtained by passing cells through a nylon mesh bag (64-m pore diameter). Percoll (Pharmacia) was added to a final concentration of 30%, and the lysate was centrifuged at 1300 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended, passed through a cell strainer (pore diameter, 70 m) (Becton-Dickinson), and washed. The cells were then layered over 2 ml Lympholyte-M (Cedarlane Laboratories) and centrifuged at 1300 g for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were removed from the interface, washed once, and counted.\n\nExpression of cell-surface markers was determined by staining cells with monoclonal antibodies specific for CD8a (clone 53-6.7), CD4 (clone RM4-5), CD45 (leukocyte common antigen, clone 30-F11), and B220 (CD45R/ B220, clone RA3-6B2) purchased from PharMingen. For flow cytometry approximately 1 \u03eb 10 6 cells were washed three times with PBS 1% BSA and blocked with 50 g of rat IgG and a 1:200 dilution of anti-CD16/CD32 (Fc\u2425III/II receptor, clone 2.4G2). Cells were then surface stained for the appropriate markers for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, washed three times with PBS 1% BSA, and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. Cells were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). The total number of cells positive for each marker per mouse was determined by multiplying the fraction of cells positive for the marker by the total number of live cells isolated per brain. As controls, monocytes were incubated with isotype controls and monocytes from the brains of mock-infected mice were incubated with antibodies to cell markers.\n\nIntracellular IFN-\u2425 expression in response to peptide stimulation was performed as previously described (Murali-Krishna et al., 1998) . We cultured 1 \u03eb 10 6 brainderived monocytes/well for 5 h at 37\u00b0C in 200 l of RPMI 1640 complete supplemented with 5% FCS, 10 units human recombinant IL-2, and 1 l/ml Brefeldin A (Golgistop, PharMingen) either with or without epitope peptides. The peptides were used at a concentration of 0.1 g/ml. Cells were then stained as above for surface expression of CD8 or CD4 and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. For intracellular IFN-\u2425 staining cells were then fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytosperm kit (PharMingen), and stained with a FITC-conjugated monoclonal rat anti-mouse IFN-\u2425 antibody (clone XMG 1.2, PharMingen).\n\nRAG1\u03ea/\u03ea and B6 mice were inoculated intracranially with10 PFU of S 4 R or S A59 R. In two independent experiments, a total of 14 RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea mice were analyzed per virus, and in parallel a total of 11 B6 mice inoculated with S A59 R and 15 B6 mice inoculated with S 4 R were analyzed. Mice were examined for signs of disease or death on a daily basis up to 21 days postinfection, after which they were examined every fourth day, and the percentage survival was calculated."}
