The reaction mixture was stirred at 50\u00b0C for 2 h. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (CyH:EtOAc, 1:0 to 9:1 v/v) to give 3 (1.80 g, 3 .03 mmol, 50 %) as a colourless, waxy solid. Chemical synthesis of \u03c9-azido-sphingosine tert-Butyl ((2S,3R,E)-18-azido-1-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-hydroxyoctadec-4-en-2-yl)carbamate (4) To a solution of bromide 3 (1.00 g, 1.69 mmol, 1.00 eq.) in DMF (20 mL) was added NaN 3 (329 mg, 5.06 mmol, 3.00 eq.). The reaction mixture was stirred at 70\u00b0C for 18 h, cooled to rt and then H 2 O (100 mL) was added. After the extraction with EtOAc (5 x 30 mL), the combined organic phases were washed with brine (20 mL) and dried (MgSO 4 Chemical synthesis of \u03c9-azido-sphingosine tert-Butyl ((2S,3R,E)-18-azido-1,3-dihydroxyoctadec-4-en-2-yl)carbamate (5) To a solution of silyl ether 4 (1.84 g, 3.32 mmol, 1.00 eq.) in dry THF (35 mL) was added TBAF (1 M in THF, 3.98 mL, 3.98 mmoL, 1.20 eq.) at 0\u00b0C. The ice bath was removed and the reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 30 min. After the addition of H 2 O (50 mL) and brine (50 mL), the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (5 x 50 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with brine (25 mL), dried (MgSO 4 ) and the solvents were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (CyH:EtOAc, 2:1 v/v) to give 5 (1.46 g, 3.31 mmol, quant.) as a colourless, waxy solid. Chemical synthesis of \u03c9-azido-sphingosine (2S,3R,E)-2-Amino-18-azidooctadec-4-ene-1,3-diol / \u03c9-azido-sphingosine (6) To a solution of carbamate 5 (900 mg, 2.04 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 (20 mL) was added TFA (4.72 mL) at 0\u00b0C. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0\u00b0C for 2 h and subsequently treated with H 2 O (100 mL) and 1 M aq. NaOH (100 mL). After the extraction with EtOAc (10 x 50 mL), the combined organic phases were washed with brine (10 mL), dried (MgSO 4 ) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (CH 2 Cl 2 :MeOH, 9:1 v/v) to give 6 (423 mg, 1.24 mmol, 61 %) as a colourless, waxy solid. Ifn a r -/ -, H S V -1 "}
