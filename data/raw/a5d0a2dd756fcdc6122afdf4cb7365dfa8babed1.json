{"title": "A family of macrodomain proteins reverses cellular mono- ADP-ribosylation", "body": "(a) ADP-ribosylated PARP10 was treated with buffer (reaction i) or MacroD2 (reaction ii) and subjected to a second round of modification in the presence of [ 32 P]-NAD + followed by a treatment with buffer (reaction iii) or MacroD2 (reaction iv). The scheme of the experimental set-up with predicted outcome is depicted on the right. The reactions were separated on polyacrylamide gels and subjected to autoradiography. Radioactive PARP10 signal was quantified and normalized to the pre-modified PARP10 treated with MacroD2 signal (reaction ii). Error bars represent s.e.m. (n=2). (b-f) PARP10 demodification reaction by MacroD2 was tested for dependence on (b) ADPr product inhibition, line represents a theoretical fit for inhibition; (c) temperature; (d) MacroD2 enzyme concentration; (e) pH; (f) incubation time, lines represent a theoretical fit for single turnover kinetics. Demodification reactions with [ 32 P]-ADP-ribosylated PARP10 were carried out by varying the studied parameter, followed by separation on polyacrylamide gels and quantifying the residual [ 32 P]-PARP10 signal on autoradiographs. Where appropriate, the signal was normalized to MacroD2 activity at 37 \u00b0C. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (n=2-3). (g) ARH1 has no detectable activity towards ADP-ribosylated PARP10. The assay was carried out as in Supplementary Figure 9 Jankevicius et al.\n\nMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations on MacroD2 in complex with an ADPr-Glu ester model were performed using the Amber11 package 1 . The ADPr-Glu ester was parameterized using the Antechamber module of Amber11 and the ester ligand was docked into the ligand binding site by superposition of the ADPr part on the crystal structure of ADPr in complex with MacroD2. The resulting structure was energy minimized and served as a start structure for MD simulations. The complex was solvated in an octahedral box using the TIP3P water model 2 and neutralized by adding sodium and chloride ions. The system was heated to 300 K employing positional restraints on the solute atoms followed by a stepwise relaxation of the positional restraints. After a 5 ns equilibration simulation without restraints the conformational dynamics and water binding was investigated during 10 ns production at 300 K and a constant pressure of 1 bar.\n\nStructural superpositions and alignments were calculated using the Indonesia software package 3 .\n\nStructural models for yeast Poa1p and ALC-1 were calculated using the PHYRE2 threading server 4 .\n\nNuclear extracts (NE) were prepared essentially as described previously 5 minutes. The reactions were stopped by gel loading buffer and heating at 95 \u00b0C. The samples were separated on NuPAGE gels, gels were dried and exposed to imaging plates (Fuji Film). For autoradiograph quantification, the AIDA 4.0 software package was used.\n\nIn vitro activity modulation was checked by performing PARP1 de-modification reactions for a total of 15 minutes (see above), with the exception that 0.5 \u00b5M MacroD2 or MacroH2A.1.1 were present during the reaction. The macrodomains were added either before NAD + addition or after the PARP1 reaction had proceeded for 5 minutes. The samples were separated on silica gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck) using 1.5 M LiCl with 20% ethanol as eluent and exposed to imaging plates (Fuji Film).\n\nJankevicius et al. For testing GST-tagged macrodomain protein activities, the [ 32 P]-NAD + after PARP10 automodification reaction was not washed off but immediately followed by demodification reactions containing 0.5 \u00b5M GST-macrodomain for 15 minutes at 37 \u00b0C.\n\nTo generate ADP-ribosylated peptide on lysine residue, 160 \u00b5M peptide (PAPAKSAPAPKKGSKK-Biotin) was incubated with 1 mM ADP-ribose derived from NAD and [ 32 P]-NAD hydrolysis in 25 mM Tris pH 8.3 at 37 \u00b0C for >7 days 6 . The 80 \u00b5M peptide was then incubated with either 0.5 M KOH, buffer"}
