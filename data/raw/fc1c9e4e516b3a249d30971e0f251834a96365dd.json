{"title": "Ageing and life-long maintenance of T-cell subsets in the face of latent persistent infections", "body": "latency (with no viral re-activation), through increasing frequencies of viral re-activation, to low-level persistent replication (with constant viral re-activation), to increasing levels of continuous viral replication, ending with high level continuous replication. See Figure  4 for illustration.\n\nLong-term, repeated stimulation of the immune system (particularly of T cells) by latent persisting viruses is believed to play an important role in immune senescence 25 . This Review discusses the recent evidence indicating that the individual effects of and the interplay between homeostatic forces and persistent viruses may be the key drivers of T-cell ageing in humans.\n\nThis topic was covered in recent years, including the entire recent issue of Seminars in Immunology dealing with T cell reconstitution 26 , and will therefore be discussed here in an abbreviated manner in the text and in Figure 2 . Most of T-cell receptor-\u03b1\u03b2 (TCR\u03b1\u03b2) T cells differentiate in the thymus from bone-marrow precursors and are then exported to secondary lymphoid organs (Figure 2A ). The rate of production of these recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) is proportional to the total thymic mass, and amounts to ~1% of the total thymic cell content per day 27, 28 . In mice, naive CD8 + T cells and many of the naive CD4 + T cells are maintained by trophic signals from interaction of their TCR with self-peptide-MHC complexes ( Figure 2A) . Naive T-cell survival also requires the common cytokine-receptor \u03b3chain (\u03b3 c ) family member interleukin-7 (IL-7) (reviewed in 23 ) ( Figure 2A ). However, these cells are also regularly replaced by RTEs in a random manner, ensuring diversity of the naive T-cell pool 29 , which is generally believed to ensure optimal response to new, previously unencountered, infectious challenge. In vivo, naive T cells display very low spontaneous (known as \"homeostatic\") cycling ( Figure 2 ). Homeostatic proliferation is greatly increased in lymphopaenic conditions (such as those induced by irradiation, chemotherapy or HIV infection) where T-cells sense the excess of \"space\" (most likely by responding to an excess of unused IL-7 and IL-15) and try to fill it by antigen-independent homeostatic proliferative expansion (HPE) 23, 24 . It is unclear whether the peptide-MHC and \u03b3 c cytokine signals are provided by a particular cell type (such as dendritic cells or other stromal cells) ( Fig. 2A) , and/or whether these cells reside in a confined anatomical location, ensuring competition and preventing accumulation of too many T cells. IL-2 has been shown to oppose some of the actions of IL-7 and IL-15 15 and its main homeostatic role is likely in production and expansion of regulatory T cells 30 .\n\nThe memory compartment arises from the naive T cells following encounters with antigen. This encounter generates effector (CD69 hi CD25 hi CCR7 lo CD62L lo CD127 lo CD27 lo ) as well as memory, cells, and the latter are broadly divided into central memory and effector memory T cells. Central memory T cells undergo self renewal but lack the phenotype associated with acute or chronic activation (CD69 \u2212 CD25 \u2212 CCR7 hi CD62L hi CD127 hi CD27 hi ) and therefore gain the optimal spectrum of effector functions after a short delay. By contrast, effector memory cells (CD69 \u2212 CD25 \u2212 CCR7 hi CD62L lo CD127 lo CD27 lo ) are activated and able to perform immediate effector functions 31 . Memory T cells are less dependent on contact with specific peptide-MHC for survival ( Figure 2B) 32 ; they cycle and self-renew in vivo three-to four-fold faster than naive T cells and are capable of vigorous proliferation in lymphopaenic conditions 23 . In mice, this HPE as well as homeostatic memory T-cell maintenance depends on IL-15, or, in its absence, on IL-7 33 (Figure 2B ). Therefore, in the face of repeated pathogen challenges, homeostatic forces must balance antigen-driven expansion of naive antigen-specific T cells, generation of the effector-cell population, their subsequent contraction, and the recruitment of the surviving cells into the memory compartment. This simultaneously preserves T-cell repertoire diversity to combat new pathogens and enables vigorous recall response to reinfection. In young and adult mice, the numbers and diversity of peripheral T cells are remarkably similar in different mice of the same strain 23, 34, 35 , suggesting that clonal expansion and contraction must be tightly regulated in adulthood (reviewed in 35 ). However, this balance likely depends on the stable naive T-cell pool, which critically depends on the production of new T cells by the thymus 28, 36 , and also on the absence of manifest pathogen challenge, which is the case in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) animals.\n\nT-cell homeostasis is regulated by the availability of, and the response of T cells to, the environmental trophic and survival signals. While we have precise information on the role of cytokines, primarily those of the \u03b3 c family (IL-7, IL-15 and IL-2) and self-peptide-MHC complexes, which provide important and partially non-redundant signals, metabolic signals are also likely to have a role but these are less well understood 37 , and it is possible that there are other presently unknown signals and pathways that may also regulate T-cell numbers.\n\nAlthough immune senescence affects many aspects of innate and adaptive immunity, defects in T-cell immunity are the best documented and the most marked (reviewed in 1, 2, 38 ) . Indeed, in elderly individuals and old animals, the restoration of T-cell population balance and numbers alone often correlates with improvement in the response to antigen or pathogen challenge [39] [40] [41] . As mentioned, age-related changes in T-cell immunity can occur at a singlecell and at a population level. Cell-autonomous defects involve disrupted signalling through the TCR and co-stimulatory receptors ( Figure 1A ); these changes have been described in detail elsewhere 42, 43 and so will not be discussed further here. Instead, I focus on the set of age-associated changes that involve disruption of T-cell population balance ( Figure 1B )an area that is now beginning to be understood. This disruption is the result of four partially interrelated events: involution of the thymus; decline of naive T-cell numbers; reduction in Tcell repertoire diversity; and accumulation of memory T cells that are specific for persisting pathogens (also known as memory inflation). All of these phenomena have the potential to reduce the reserve of T cells needed for protection against new pathogens.\n\nThymic involution and its cardinal manifestation, reduction in na\u00efve T-cell output from the thymus, begin as early as one year after birth in humans and after puberty (~6-8 weeks) in laboratory mice, and remain incompletely understood 2, [44] [45] [46] . This in part because developing thymocytes and the thymic stroma are co-dependent and proper thymic function depends on this crosstalk, making it difficult to precisely dissect this issue. Most of the recent studies have implicated defects in the commitment of haematopoietic stem cells to the lymphoid lineage and the migration of these lymphoid-restricted precursors (known as early T-cell progenitors 47 or common lymphoid progenitor 2) 48 into the thymus 49, 50 (Figure 3) . That, however, does not exclude possible defects in thymic stromal components 45, 51 (Figure  3 ), potentially precipitated by factors that include, but are certainly not limited to, sex hormones 52 . Paralleling the thymic involution, there is a marked drop in the number of RTEs. The thymus seems to produce RTEs proportionally to its overall cellularity, even late in senescence 28, 46 , thus as thymic cellularity drops, so does T-cell output. For example, 22month-old mice have less than a tenth of the RTEs present in their young adult counterparts 28, 53 . Thymic involution and the consequent marked and progressive decline in naive T-cell production put a heavy stress on homeostatic mechanisms that are needed to maintain the naive T-cell compartment for much of adulthood and during senescence.\n\nIn elderly individuals, the few RTEs that reach the periphery are then faced with conditions that differ from those in younger counterparts: there are fewer naive T cells, and their survival and turnover is altered (Figs. 1B and 3). RTEs (particularly those of the CD4 + phenotype) do not seem to survive well in the periphery of old animals 28 . Thus, several processes are at play in the old naive T-cell pool. First, the naive T-cell pool could be directly diminished by cell death and/or lifelong recruitment into the memory pool, although we lack quantitative data to discern whether and which of these two may be more important. Second, the naive T-cell pool could be indirectly affected by a growing pool of memory T cells that may compete with naive T cells. Given that there is some overlap in the use of survival and maintenance cytokines by these two T-cell pools 33, 54, 55 , it is possible that these two populations are not wholly independently regulated, particularly later in life, as initially postulated 56 . Finally, if naive T cells continue to be depleted, the consequent lymphopaenic conditions should generate an excess of survival and maintenance cytokines, which should trigger HPE of naive T cells. HPE will then eventually induce the conversion of many naive T cells into memory-phenotype T cells 57 , as convincingly shown in several studies [58] [59] [60] . This is believed to occur because rapid proliferation, even in response to cytokines, activates a differentiation program in T cells 57 . Recently, we obtained evidence in monkeys consistent with this mechanism. We found that homeostatic proliferation of naive T cells in the blood of aged rhesus macaques inversely correlates with the number and proportion of naive T cells in these animals, and that this is not accompanied by an accumulation of these cells, but rather by their rapid turnover 61 . Support for this mechanism has also been found for human CD4 + T cells 62 .\n\nTogether, all of these mechanisms -reduced na\u00efve T-cell production, increased na\u00efve T-cell conversion into memory cells and accumulation of memory cells due to lifelong encounters with new pathogens -synergize to reduce TCR diversity in old individuals 34, [62] [63] [64] . Importantly, this reduction affects even the otherwise most diverse na\u00efve T-cell subset 62 , stressing the power of antigen-independent homeostatic forces in eventually precipitating age-related T-cell population dysbalance 61, 62 .\n\nThese changes in old individuals occur against a backdrop of, and are likely heavily influenced by, changes in the cytokine environment. It is well accepted that IL-2 production decreases with ageing [65] [66] [67] . By contrast, it is less clear whether there are age-related alterations in IL-7 or IL-15 levels 55, [68] [69] [70] or the expression and function of their receptors on different T-cell subsets 71, 72 . Analysis here is hindered by difficulties in measuring relevant IL-15 concentrations due to its highly localized mechanism of action. Understanding whether changes in these cytokines contribute to age-related defects in T-cell homeostasis is of added interest because of the clear therapeutic potential for \u03b3 c cytokines in lymphopoiesis and/or the peripheral expansion and maintenance of T-cell subsets. However, much remains to be understood about the in vivo action of exogenously administered cytokines, particularly from non-human primate and human clinical studies 26,55,73-75 . In summary, ageing is associated with a dramatic increase in proportion of memory T cells in the blood, with a concomitant and equivalent decrease in the proportion of circulating naive T cells. Initial event(s) that are believed to set the stage for this disruption in T-cell population balance -thymic involution and loss of na\u00efve T cell renewal -occur early in life and are independent of pathogen exposure and the individual antigenic experience. Subsequently, however, antigenic experience modulates this situation, with a potential to critically influence T-cell population balance with ageing. Evidence suggests that persistent pathogens occupy an especially prominent position in this regard.\n\nThe above homeostatic changes -loss of na\u00efve T-cell production and homeostatic proliferation in response to relative na\u00efve T-cell lymphopaenia -appear to critically influence T-cell ageing in laboratory mice kept under SPF conditions. However, in pathogenexposed mammals studied so far, specific pathogens provide another, perhaps dominant, level of influence. Upon pathogenic invasion, T cells specific for the epitopes of the pathogen undergo tremendous expansion, so that one na\u00efve T cell can generate up to 10 5 effector T cells. Once the pathogen is eliminated, more than 90% of these cells are eliminated by apoptosis, and those that remain are recruited into the memory T-cell pool, where they persist for long periods of time, and even for life ( Figure 4A) . A different situation occurs if the pathogen is not eliminated. Persistent pathogens can establish latent or chronic infection (Box 1), and these two types of infection differ by the level of stimulation they provide to the immune system. Replication of pathogens that establish chronic infection is never truly controlled in the host, and although the level of the pathogen in the blood is likely to be lower than that measured at the peak of acute infection, such pathogens constantly replicate and maintain a set point of pathogen load ( Figure 5 ). Therefore, cells of the immune system (including T cells) are constantly and systemically stimulated by these pathogens. In many, if not most, cases these pathogens cause chronic diseases that last for years and often have poor prognosis, in part because they exhaust the T cells that are supposed to control them. Chronic infections of this type, including these caused by HIV and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus), hepatitis C virus and chronic strains of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), can coincide with ageing, but are not part of the \"normal\" ageing process because they do not affect the majority of the old population and because they cause clinically manifest, direct pathology. Therefore, they will not be discussed further, except when there are relevant parallels between the functional consequences of chronic infections and those seen in T cell ageing.\n\nIn contrast to chronic infections, in latent infections the pathogen is controlled systemically and therefore cannot be detected in the blood at all times ( Figure 5 ). Rather, the pathogen finds a niche where it establishes latency (for example, HSV establishes latent infection in the neurons, mostly in the sensory ganglia innervating the site of viral entry 76 ) and remains largely dormant with regard to genome replication. Occasionally, the latent virus will be reactivated, at which time it may or may not be systemically (or locally) detectable (Fig. 5 ). This, of course, will stimulate the T cells (mainly memory T cells), which will force the virus back into its latent state. However, this intermittent stimulation can potentially lead to expansion of pathogen-specific T-cell population (Fig. 4B ). Although the stimulation of T cells in localized latent infections is repeated, it is not likely to be continuous (at least not for all pathogen-reactive T cells) and therefore is not associated with massive exhaustion and/or deletion of parts of the T-cell repertoire as is the case with chronic viruses. Indeed, it is rare to see loss of immune control of a latent virus, even at an advanced age, unless there is concomitant immune suppression independent of ageing. Correlative experimental and clinical evidence 7,25,77,78 had linked latent infections to expanded populations of T cells in advanced age, as described below.\n\nGiven the above considerations, the pathogens likely to have the maximum impact on the ageing immune system should be highly adapted to the host so as not to generate manifest disease. They should be ubiquitous, and able to infect most of the population early after birth. Although there are numerous human pathogens that persist after primary infection with no sterilizing immunity to them (including mycobacteria and helminths), the pathogen class that best corresponds to the above description are the Herpesviridae. Herpesviruses infect humans at an early age, and many of them remain with their host for the life of the host with no signs of disease 79,80 (Box 1). They usually establish latency in specific cell types or tissues and deploy multiple mechanisms to evade the innate and adaptive immune system [81] [82] [83] . Therefore, they are exquisitely well adapted to the host, and some of them have a very narrow host range. HSV, EBV and CMV are probably the most prominent herpesviruses linked to the expansion of T cells in elderly humans 25 . Among them, CMV stands out because it typifies the key features of the herpesvirus family that are pertinent to T-cell ageing. First, CMV prevalence varies between 60% in industrial countries and nearly 100% in developing countries 84 , with an increasing prevalence in older humans (up to 90%) even in industrial countries. Second, the CD8 + T-cell response against CMV is unusually broad, targeting numerous viral peptides 85, 86 . This response also displays an unusual feature of progressive, long-term expansion of antigen-specific CD8 + memory T cells 85, 87, 88 , dubbed memory inflation 89 . Indeed, the CD8 + T-cell response to individual epitopes of this virus can reach up to 20% of the total memory T-cell compartment, and the response to all of its epitopes in humans is estimated to occupy 50% or more of the entire CD8 + memory Tcell pool 85 . Finally, this pronounced and progressive response has been associated with accumulation of dysfunctional CMV-specific T cells 90 , as well as with shorter lifespan in octogenarians 91 , although the nature of the link between these associations is not clear at present.\n\nInteresting findings were reported recently by Hadrup et al. 92 on the complexity of the response to CMV in very old humans. Large CD8 + T-cell clonal expansions specific for the immunodominant CMV peptides were seen in most octogenerians and nonagenerians in a Swedish population study, and these tended to become progressively more prominent with age 92 . However, the individuals that survived into very old age exhibited smaller T-cell responses to CMV, and even showed loss of clonotypes responding to this virus. This raises the possibility that survival into the very old age (centennerians and above) may be associated with an immune system that is not overtly preoccupied with persisting pathogens.\n\nUnfortunately, longitudinal studies in relevant human populations, while invaluable in providing information on immune ageing in the most relevant physiological model, suffer from ethical and practical constraints that prevent definitive experimentation. Thus, it remains unclear whether the latent virus is the cause of memory inflation, and if so whether it does so by direct stimulation of relevant T cells, the indirect action via type I interferons or other mediators of innate immunity, the secretion of which is stimulated by the virus, or by a combination of these and other mechanisms. Experiments showing that CD8 T cells specific for some viral antigens accumulate 93 ;Holtappels, 2000 #6367;Karrer, 2003 #6189}, whereas others do not 86,94,95 Sierro, 2005 #6186 , and that this correlates to the expression of these antigens/proteins in latency, would suggest that expression during early reactivation and/or latency is driving the process of inflation, but this remains to be formally proven.\n\nIt is also possible that the aged immune system may be inefficient at controlling latent virus reactivation (and gene expression) due to T-cell-intrinsic defects, allowing for prolonged persistence of viral antigens that then further stimulate an already expanded, but inefficient, pool of virus-specific T cells. In that scenario, age-related T-cell defects could be the primary cause for their own accumulation via a positive feedback loop, although the presence of latent viral infection would be needed to expose it. Finally, it is unclear whether the expanded T cells in humans resemble the spontaneously arising T-cell clonal expansions seen in mice 34, 64 , and whether they depend on viral antigen for survival and proliferation.\n\nTo answer some of these questions, we have developed a model of latent viral infection in old mice. We sought to mimic the human situation, with an early infection in youth and persistence for life. HSV was administered locally or systemically to young mice, and expansion, contraction and maintenance of the T-cell response were followed in a longitudinal manner. Following intraocular administration, we observed the expected expansion until day 8-9 96 , followed by contraction and stable maintenance of ~1-2% virusspecific CD8 + T cells in the blood, measured using MHC class I tetramers 97 . This set point for memory maintenance was stable over the next 16 months, at which point, in mice that were now bona fide old, we observed a slow, progressive and variable accumulation of HSVspecific T cells. Most animals showed an accumulation, and in some (~20-30%) of the mice, this reached levels similar to, or even higher than, those seen at the peak of the acute infection. These expanded virus-specific T cells had the central memory phenotype, with no signs of acute activation 97 . Moreover, continuous administration of antiviral drugs did not alter the course of this accumulation. Altogether, these observations suggest that in a localized HSV infection, viral reactivation and repeated antigenic stimulation have a minor, if any, role in the accumulation of virus-specific CD8 + T cells. Rather, the phenotype of the accumulating cells (central memory T cells) raises the possibility that these expanded T cells arise as a consequence of homeostatic processes that are similar to those that drive the onset of spontaneous T-cell clonal expansions in uninfected mice 72, 98 . In that regard, spontaneously arising (antigen-independent) T-cell clones express high levels of receptors for the survival-promoting \u03b3 c cytokines IL-7 and IL-15 72 , and similar features were observed in HSV-specific CD8 + T cells that accumulated with age in our model of local HSV infection 97 . This is consistent with the idea that old age, with its homeostatic disturbances, rather than repeated antigenic stimulation, is the key factor in the onset of Tcell expansions in this model of localized infection with latent virus. Another line of evidence supporting this view comes from a recent and important paper by Woodland and colleagues 99 , where the authors found that a T-cell clone specific for an acute respiratory virus (Sendai virus), which was cleared in youth, can markedly expand in the old age in the absence of signs of antigen-driven activation. We have confirmed these results with a different acute virus (WNV) 97 , suggesting that this is a general phenomenon in SPF mice, and that any cell from the memory pool, if adequately responsive to cytokine/other survival factors, can be selected to become T-cell clonal expansions, regardless of its antigenic specificity or antigenic stimulation. Of note, children and young adults often mount strong anti-CMV responses 100,101 but that inflation does not occur until later in life, and that the most pronounced abnormalities, while not exclusive for the aged, are by far most prominent in the elderly. This too would be consistent with an important role of age-related homeostatic disturbances, although the direct progeroid influence of CMV cannot be excluded.\n\nA different kinetics of T-cell expansion was previously described by Reddehase and colleagues 102 and, subsequently by Klenerman and colleagues 89 , using the mouse model of CMV infection (murine CMV, mCMV) In this model, an early accumulation of mCMVspecific effector memory T cells -memory inflation 89 -was seen as early as 2-3 months after primary infection, and this accumulation matched or exceeded the levels of antigenspecific T cells seen at the peak of primary infection (which are rather low in primary CMV infection). In contrast to our observations using the HSV model, these studies raised a possibility that mCMV and HSV-1 differed in the fundamental ability to induce memory inflation, or that other differences (dose, route or other parameters) may account for the fact that HSV-1 did not induce memory inflation in our model. To test these possibilities, we immunized adult mice intraperitoneally, thus matching the route used in the mCMV experiments. In these experiments, we saw early and pronounced memory inflation starting at three months post infection (Lang et al., submitted) . The cells exhibited the phenotype and the distribution typical of effector memory cells (in the blood and tissues, but not secondary lymphoid organs). This memory inflation could be delayed or prevented by the use of antiviral drugs, and T-cell transfers into virus-free or virus-infected hosts showed formally that direct viral stimulation, establishment of latency and reactivation from latency were all necessary to produce memory inflation (Lang et al., submitted) . Nevertheless, this does not resolve the basic mechanisms involved in the onset and maintenance of memory inflation, and decisive experiments are needed to evaluate the roles of viral antigen and of virallyinduced innate immune response factors in this process.\n\nOverall, questions still remain related to the evolution of memory inflation in the old age. Will the inflating cells retain the effector/effector memory phenotype and function? Will they convert into central memory cells, perhaps signifying that homeostatic cytokines/ factors, rather than antigenic stimulation, may be more important in advanced ageing? And will that be similar or distinct to the situation observed in humans? These questions remain to be answered, but given their importance and the interest in the field, the answers are probably not too far ahead.\n\nAs mentioned above, chronic infections, such as HIV, HCV and chronic strains of LCMV, have been shown to lead to T-cell clonal exhaustion. The discovery that these chronically stimulated and exhausted T cells express programmed cell death 1 (PD1), a B7-family molecule that may have a role in dampening signals through the co-stimulatory pathway 103 , led to attempts to improve T-cell function by blocking PD1-mediated signalling. Such blockade 104 , as well as the blockade of IL-10, a cytokine often associated with inhibition of type 1 immunity 105 , can result in a marked reversal of function in exhausted T cells in mice. Two other markers were associated with \"exhaustion\", KLRG1 (killer-cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G, member 1), a natural-killer-cell marker that is often associated with low proliferative ability 106 , and CD57, shown in HIV-infected subjects to mark replicatively senescent cells likely to undergo apoptosis 107 , but in other in vivo studies expression of these marker did not correlate precisely with functional exhaustion 108, 109 . So far, attempts to reverse the exhausted phenotype of human T cells using blockade of PD1 have been met with far more modest success (reviewed in 104 ) , suggesting that this pathway and the concepts of \"exhaustion\" need to be better understood in humans. Nevertheless, a key question is whether similar molecular and functional changes occur with ageing and with latent infections.\n\nSeveral manuscripts have described an accumulation of dysfunctional or hypofunctional cells with a 'terminally differentiated' phenotype associated with human ageing 77, 110, 111 . Cells with the terminally differentiated phenotype share parts of the phenotype with effector memory cells, being CD69 \u2212 CD25 \u2212 CD62L lo CD127 lo CCR7 lo CD27 lo , and, in humans, also are CD28 \u2212 and re-express CD45RA (which is normally expressed by naive T cells). Moreover, Therefore, they have been termed T effector memory, re-expressing CD45RA (or T-EMRA) cells 88,112. Although these cells can be stained with MHC class I tetramers, confirming their specificity for viral antigens, in some situations they show impaired, or absent, in vitro proliferation and IL-2 production in response to antigen or agonist TCRspecific antibodies, and variably reduced secretion of interferon-\u03b3, although their cytolytic capacity can be intact 88, 106, 113 . This functional phenotype of T cells in aged individuals has been taken to indicate exhaustion, but are these cells really exhausted and are they counterparts of the similar population observed in chronic viral infections? Several observations urge caution in equating these cell populations. First, typical expression of PD1 and its ligand PDL1 is several-fold lower on the cells responding to CMV in aged individuals compared to those responding to chronic infection with HIV or HCV 104, 114, 115 (A. Lang & J.N-.Z., unpublished observations). Second, similar T-cell populations in nonhuman primates, while possibly hyporesponsive in vitro, appear to turn over quite vigorously in vivo, as measured by labelling with bromodeoxyuridine 61, 116, 117 . It is likely that in vitro conditions simply do not provide a replica of the environment that allows these cells to accumulate with ageing. Third, as mentioned above, there is little to no clinical evidence that such \"exhausted\" T-cell populations indeed allow reactivation of the latent herpesviruses that they are supposed to control, and the protective function of this subset has rarely been addressed directly. In some cases, proliferative capacity 118 and even protective effect 119 of the so called terminally differentiated and/or exhausted cells was strong. Indeed, profound immunosuppression is necessary to reveal clinical reactivation of herpesvirus infections in the elderly, suggesting that they are adequately controlled by the aging immune system. Fourth, one should be mindful of another physiological possibility: that cells arising by memory inflation should really not be allowed to further proliferate. Indeed, from a homeostatic standpoint, it would seem economical to curtail the proliferation of an already expanded population. Therefore, ensuring that expanded memory T cells remain hypoproliferative would be an elegant way to reduce further expansion of these cells. Of course, it remains possible that these cells usurp the space and potentially constrict T-cell repertoire needed for the response to new microbial invasion, as was shown in the case of spontaneously arising antigen-independent T-cell clonal expansions in SPF mice 120 . But another possibility was recently shown to be true in adult mice -there persistent herpesviruses cross-protected against bacterial infections via innate immune mechanisms 121 , and one has to wonder whether this extends to old animals and humans as well. Therefore, the role of latent persistent herpesviruses in immune (and organismal) aging will remain a rewarding problem to mechanistically dissect for a foreseeable future.\n\nMechanisms that lead to T-cell senescence at the cellular and population level are becoming better defined. Along with this, we are approaching the design of realistic treatments to prevent or treat T-cell senescence and/or to ameliorate its consequences. Here, I briefly mention several approaches with potential to achieve therapeutic goals in T-cell senescence.\n\nVaccination has been at the forefront of the fight against infectious diseases for several centuries and remains among the best strategies available. Problems associated with vaccination of the elderly are, unfortunately, numerous, and they stem from the same defects that impair the primary response of an aged immune system to a pathogen. Live-attenuated vaccines have been associated with a high rate of complications in the elderly, and several of them, such as FluMist (MedImmune, Inc.), a nasal spray influenza virus vaccine, and the attenuated live yellow fever vaccine, are not recommended for this population 122 . By contrast, heat-killed, fully attenuated vaccines, being weaker, tend to elicit at best moderate humoral and CD4 + T-cell responses, and these responses are heavily compromised in the elderly. Therefore, by some estimates, up to 60% of the elderly receive no benefit from annual vaccination against influenza virus. Modification of the existing vaccines is thus needed to improve vaccination outcomes. However, it is not clear whether such modifications should primarily act on antigen-presenting cells, T cells or some other element of the innate immune system. It is possible that not all age-related defects will prove to be universal for all individuals, necessitating some sort of screening to evaluate who will need which type of therapy, and we remain far from having useful biomarkers for such screening 123 .\n\nClearly, if the T-cell reserve is fatally depleted such that the vaccine antigen has no cells to stimulate, modification of the vaccine is unlikely to afford any benefit to the recipient. It is therefore an even higher imperative to screen and select individuals in whom immune reconstitution will be the primary course of action. Unfortunately, we do not fare much better with regard to the screening tools in this case, although some studies have used immune risk phenotype measurements as a prognostic factor for longevity and other agerelated parameters 91, 124 . Modalities of intervention can globally be divided into thymic rejuvenation and improvement in maintaining peripheral naive T cells, and these were recently extensively reviewed in the recent volume of Seminars in Immunology 26 . However, it is likely that the true anti-ageing interventions in the realm of T-cell immunity will need to aim for the former.\n\nIf persistent viruses are indeed key in precipitating immune ageing, then antiviral therapy could be another potentially desirable intervention. This idea is largely hypothetical at present and needs further verification in small animal models. Moreover, while there are antiviral drugs available against herpesviruses, their efficacy is rarely absolute and side effects would have to be considered before they could be recommended to the elderly. It is pertinent to note that here the goal would not be sterilizing immunity (which is anyway all but impossible to reach with anti-herpesvirus drugs), but rather to keep these viruses from (frequent) reactivation.\n\nFinally, nutritional intervention by caloric restriction was recently shown to improve the production, maintenance and function of naive T cells in rhesus macaques 125 , corroborating prior data in rodents 41, 126 . If parlayed into a pharmacological treatment, this could be a powerful way to enhance T-cell immunity in the elderly.\n\nThe most recent results tell us that persistent pathogens are probably an important contributor to some of the immunological abnormalities seen in aged humans, by driving the expansion and accumulation of effector and memory T cells. However, it still remains to be seen whether they decisively influence immune defence and, by extension, longevity, and an answer to these questions will have to await controlled experiments in appropriate animal models. On the other hand, results from rodents 97-99 as well as from non-human primates 61 and humans 62 strongly support the decisive role of the homeostatic forces in shaping the immune system in the old individuals. Whether this influence will be more pronounced than that of latent infections, remains to be seen. To that effect, experiments with T-cell reconstitution or thymic rejuvenation in the presence or the absence of latent persistent infection(s) should be conducive to illuminating this issue of critical importance for our understanding of immune ageing.\n\nI wish to thank the members of my laboratory for stimulating discussions (in particular Drs. Luka Cicin-Sain, Anna Lang and Brian Rudd) and Andrew Townsend for the help with illustrations. I also wish to acknowledge support by the USPHS awards AG20719, AG21384, AG23664 and N0150027 and the Core National Primate Research Center award RR 0163 to ONPRC from the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe cellular state in which there is an imbalance between production and neutralization of molecules known as the reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as H 2 O 2 , OH \u2212 , HOO \u2212 and superoxide. ROS production is normally countered by several mechanisms aimed to maintain cellular macromolecules in a reduced state (superoxide-metabolizing enzymes, glutathione, vitamin C), and by mechanisms that repair the consequences of ROS activity, which include peroxidation of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Oxidative stress ensues when both neutralization and repair mechanisms are overwhelmed by ROS production.\n\nA pathway that rejoins DNA strand breaks without relying on significant homology. The main known pathway uses the Ku-end binding complex and is regulated by DNA protein kinase. The pathway is often used in mammalian cells to repair strand breaks caused by DNA-damaging agents, and some of the same enzymes are used during the strand-joining steps of V(D)J recombination.\n\nCommon cytokine-receptor \u03b3-chain family A family of cytokine receptors in which each receptor complex is composed of two or three subunits, with one of those subunits being the common cytokine-receptor \u03b3-chain (\u03b3 c ).\n\nA subset of CD4 + T cells that has suppressive regulatory activity towards effector T cells and other immune cells. This subset includes cells that express high levels of CD25 (the interleukin-2 receptor \u03b1-chain) and the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3). Other regulatory T-cell populations can be CD25 \u2212 FOXP3 \u2212 and produce the regulatory cytokine interleukin-10, which suppresses the functions of T-helper-1-type effector T cells and other immune cells. The absence or dysfunction of regulatory T cells is associated with severe autoimmunity.\n\nAntigen-experienced CD8 + T cells that lack immediate effector function but are able to mediate rapid recall responses by virtue of quick and sustained cell division and rapid development into effector or effector memory cells after restimulation with antigen. Central memory T cells retain the migratory properties of naive cells and therefore circulate through the secondary lymphoid organs.\n\nTerminally differentiated T cells that lack most, but not all, lymph-node homing receptors, but express receptors that enable them to home to inflamed tissues. Effector memory cells contain perforin and can exert immediate effector functions without the need of further differentiation.\n\nThe thymus reaches its maximal relative weight at birth and, depending on the species, the absolute weight and the rate of T-cell production increases until a year after birth (in humans) or until puberty (in specific-pathogen-free mice). Then, under the influence of incompletely elucidated list of factors that include sex hormones, age-related involution begins and the thymus becomes atrophic. The total size is reduced, the stromal compartment is replaced by fibrous and fat tissue, and thymic T-cell output is proportionally reduced. Nevertheless, it is now known that the residual vestiges of thymic tissue remain capable of producing thymocytes even in very advanced senescence.\n\nT-cell homeostasis is defined here as the maintenance of relatively stable numbers of naive and memory T cells and of balanced TCR diversity, as well as the ability of the T-cell pool to restore these numbers and diversity to prior resting state after acute antigen challenge.\n\nAnimals, mainly rodents, kept under vivarium conditions whereby an increasing list of pathogens is excluded or eradicated from the colony. These animals are maintained in the absence of most of the known chronic and latent persistent pathogens. While this enables better control of experimental conditions related to immunity and infection, it also sets apart such animal models from pathogen-exposed humans or non-human primates, whose immune systems are in constant contact with infection.\n\nBiotinylated monomeric MHC molecules are folded with a specific peptide in the binding groove and tetramerized with a fluorescently labelled streptavidin molecule. Tetramers will bind to T cells that express TCRs specific for the cognate peptide, allowing direct enumeration of antigen-specific T cells.\n\nA state of non-reactivity when all precursor lymphocytes responding to persistent antigen(s) differentiate into effector cells which are driven into the state of functional exhaustion, whereby such cells no longer can productively engage and control the pathogen. The end result of clonal exhaustion is purging the immune-response repertoire of a particular specificity (or specificities).\n\n(5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine, BrdU). A thymidine analogue that is incorporated into DNA on replication, allowing tracking of cells that have divided using BrdU-specific antibodies and flow cytofluorometry.\n\nImmune risk phenotype (IRP). A set of empirical immune system (mainly T-cell) measurements that are believed to correlate with, and therefore potentially to be, biomarkers of immune senescence. The IRP components that involve T cells are: reduced naive T-cell levels (reduced in ageing), inverted CD4:CD8 ratios (>1 in youth, 1 or less in ageing), accumulation of CD28 \u2212 T cells (effector memory), reduced proliferative ability, reduced interleukin-2 production and presence of cytomegalovirus infection (and, potentially, the size of T-cell pool responding to it). While these, and other, traits have been noted to correlate with residual lifespan and/or the ability to respond to new vaccination or infection, in some studies, their verification as reliable biomarkers of ageing across disparate human populations in large prospective studies is urgently needed. T-cell population changes result from decreased T-cell production from an involuted thymus, which critically contributes to the depletion of the naive T-cell pool. The naive T-cell pool then undergoes increased homeostatic cycling. This maintains the naive compartment for a while, but as the increased cycling (approximately once every month in mice) turns into homeostatic proliferation (4 or more divisions/month, at or above the level seen in the T-cell memory pool) 59, 60, 127 , phenotypic conversion of naive T cells into memory phenotype cells has the potential to further deplete the naive T-cell compartment. This and the conditions favorable to disrupt maintenance of the memory compartment, provide impetus for the generation of T-cell clonal expansions. While the young thymus produces robust numbers of diverse new T cells which only infrequently cycle (A), the involuting, aging thymus produces many fewer naive T cells which also poorly survive in aged individuals (B). Other known age-related alterations include altered expression and function of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) in humans 69 , and increased turnover of naive T cells in monkeys 61 and humans 62 , which has the potential to precipitate their conversion into memory T cells (B). That process would also support the formation of antigen-independent T-cell clonal expansions 72, 98 . Changes in levels of other important T-cell maintenance cytokines, such as IL-7 and IL-15, as well as the known increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6 and tumour-necrosis factor) and changes in systemic and local levels of hormones (insulin-like growth factor 1, growth hormone, ghrelin and leptin) could also play a role, although this is yet to be proven. infection, and the associated immune responses. In both cases, the kinetics of activation and waning of innate immunity, the kinetics of infectious virus and the kinetics of the initial, primary T-cell response are essentially the same. Key differences emerge subsequently, because in A, the causative agent of acute infection is eliminated and T-cell memory is therefore maintained at a more or less constant, low level. By contrast, in B, latent persistent pathogen will periodically reactivate (waves in the broken line), providing every time for the activation of innate immunity (waves in the dotted line). Because innate immunity does not have the property of memory, innate cells do not accumulate. However, memory T cells accumulate following each stimulation and therefore produce memory inflation (ascending wavy line). This process is pronounced for CD8 T cells and more discrete for CD4 T cells.\n\nNikolich-\u017dugich Page 25\n\nNat Rev Immunol.

Latent viruses reach fairly high antigen levels in the course of primary infection but then establish latency and reactivate intermittently, with different frequencies (cytomegalovirus (CMV) more often than herpes simplex virus (HSV)). By contrast, HIV antigens, representative of a chronic persistent infection, are present at very high levels initially, but importantly, they also remain at high levels in the blood during the set-point of infection. This provides T cells with constant stimulation, and eventually exhaustion. Note that this illustration is mostly based on indirect immunological parameters for CMV and HSV, rather than on direct identification of the virus or viral antigen, which is very difficult to achieve during the persistent phase of the infection.\n\nNikolich-\u017dugich Page 26\n\nNat Rev Immunol.
