{"title": "", "body": "(N-terminal 300 amino acids) were assayed for N7 and 2'O methylation. The cloning and purification of the wild type and mutant MTases were described in 1 . The N7 methylation was measured by the G*pppA-RNA\uf0e8m 7 G*pppA-RNA (the asterisk indicates that the following phosphate is 32 P labeled) conversion. The 2'O methylation was monitored by the m 7 G*pppA-RNA\uf0e8m 7 G*pppAm-RNA conversion. The reactions were digested with nuclease P1 to release different cap structures (G*pppA, m 7 G*pppA, and m 7 G*pppAm), which were separated on polyethyleneimine cellulose thin-layer chromatography plates.\n\nThe methylation activities of the mutant are indicated with the wild type set at 100%. The details of the methylation assays were described previously 1 . infection, supernatants were harvested, and viral burden was titrated by plaque assay. The data are the average of three independent experiments performed in triplicate, and the asterisks indicate differences that are statistically significant (***, P < 0.0001, **, P < 0.005, *, P < 0.05). Error bars indicate standard deviations.\n\nTo generate the recombinant MHV-D130A a reverse genetic system established for MHV-A59 was used 1 Gel-shift assays. Gel-shift assays were performed as previously described 5 . Briefly, 0 to 60 pmol of purified RIG-I was incubated with 6 pmol of RNA for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. RIG-I/RNA complexes were resolved on an agarose gel stained with SYBR\u00a9 Gold (Invitrogen) and"}
