{"title": "Automated collection of pathogen-specific diagnostic data for real-time syndromic epidemiological studies", "body": "The availability of real-time surveillance data that can monitor the spread of infectious diseases benefits public health [1] [2] [3] . At present, tracking of respiratory or foodborne outbreaks relies on a variety of methods ranging from automated real-time electronic reporting to manual web entry of 60 test results. Systems such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) FluView [4, 5] , National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance Systems (NREVSS, [6] ), National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS [7, 8] ), Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) [9] , and others, although web-based still require manual entry of data from laboratories, resulting in data that are often incomplete or not current. 4 coronavirus (MERS CoV), avian influenza, enterovirus D68, and Ebola virus, real-time surveillance programs are critical [1, 29, 30 ].\n\nIt is not always possible to accurately diagnose the causative agents of most infectious diseases from symptoms alone due to overlapping clinical presentation. Thus, to achieve maximal utility, 90 infectious disease surveillance systems should move beyond syndrome-based reporting and be pathogen-specific and comprehensive, reporting on as many of the common pathogens for a particular syndrome as possible. Sensitive and specific automated molecular diagnostic systems that detect up to four different pathogens in a single sample have been available from in vitro diagnostic (IVD) manufacturers for some time [31] [32] [33] . However adoption of IVD platforms with 95 broad multiplexing capability has become widespread only in the last few years. Commercially available systems that can detect most of the known etiological agents for respiratory, gastrointestinal and other multi-pathogen syndromes [34] [35] [36] include the BioFire (Salt Lake City, UT) FilmArray \u00ae System [37] ; the GenMark (Carlsbad, CA) eSensor XT-8 \u00ae [38] and ePlex \u00ae [39] ; and the Luminex (Austin, TX) xTAG \u00ae [40] , nxTag \u00ae [41] and Verigene \u00ae systems [42] . 100 Multi-analyte diagnostic tests provide the raw data needed for real-time pathogen-specific surveillance but there remain a number of obstacles to sharing these results (reviewed in [43] ).\n\nThe obstacles largely center on information privacy and network security. A real-time surveillance system using diagnostic test results requires safeguards for protected health 105 information (PHI). Medical records and devices have become attractive targets for cyber attackers in recent years [44] , which has made hospitals and clinics reluctant to connect their Local Area Networks (LANs) to the Internet. Releasing patient test results requires the removal of PHI or authorization from the patient. Studies have shown that de-identification of patient data is not as simple as removing all specific identifiers because, in the age of big data, under the right 110 circumstances it is possible to re-associate patients and their data using publicly available information [45] [46] [47] [48] .\n\nWe describe here the implementation of a real-time pathogen-specific surveillance system that overcomes the PHI concerns noted above. FilmArray Trend de-identifies, aggregates and exports test results from FilmArray Instruments in use in US clinical laboratories. Although data from all commercially available FilmArray Panels (Methods and [49] pathogens [37, [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] .\n\nWith more than 344,000 patient results for the FilmArray RP test alone, the Trend database has 125 many of the properties associated with \"big data\" as it applies to infectious disease [57] . After describing how the dataset can be cleaned of non-patient tests, we make some observations on the seasonality of the different respiratory pathogens and we apply the ecological concept of \"species diversity\" [58] to observe a correlation between the abundance of each pathogen and the rate at which co-detections (more than one positive result per test) occur. 130 All rights reserved.

The most general and efficient way to export both the clinical and public\n\nTrend information is to follow a \"Bottom-Out\" approach to data export ( Figure 1 ). In this scheme, the FilmArray Instrument sends data via the Internet directly to a single cloud database where it can be viewed by health care providers at the originating institution. This data export 140 pathway contrasts with a \"Top-Out\" approach ( Figure 1 ) in which diagnostic test results are pushed from the instrument up to the LIS, then to the HIS and, finally, a subset of this information is forwarded to cloud-based databases. 145 Bottom-Out and Top-Out approaches for data export are indicated by solid and dashed lines respectively. Some institutions have developed their own systems for aggregating and displaying infectious disease data (indicated by \"Internal website\").\n\nOther abbreviations are defined in the text.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The initial dataset provided low-resolution information but was a useful platform to evaluate the proposed system. Further development to enable export of higher resolution data required the design of routines that would adhere to an alternative HIPAA de-identification 155 strategy, namely, the Expert Determination approach, which requires a risk assessment demonstrating that the chance of re-identifying an individual is sufficiently small [60, 61] . The Expert Determination process identified and made recommendations for fields that could facilitate disclosure of PHI. A summary of the Expert Determination results detailing the risk of Trend data in regard to replicability, availability and distinguishability is shown in Methods, 160 Table 2 .\n\nBecause the Expert Determination study established that no PHI will be disclosed by the Trend data export algorithm, Data Use Agreements (DUA), rather than Business Associates Agreements (BAA, see Methods for the difference between a DUA and a BAA) were executed 165 with each of the collaborating institutions (listed in Table 3 ). The DUAs define for the clinical laboratory how BioFire will manage and make use of the Trend data. The Trend client software residing on the FilmArray computer queries the FilmArray test result local database and exports the results to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) database (see Methods). The Trend client software performs de-identification on the FilmArray computer prior to export as detailed in 170 Table 2 . Health care providers are granted access to their institutions' Trend data by the Laboratory Director. Since web access to view the data is restricted to the local site, deidentification of geographic indicators is not required. However, in implementation of the public Trend website, which presents the national syndromic test surveillance (Figure 1 ), we have further aggregated the data with respect to geographic origin and obfuscated the date of the test 8 (see Methods). Since only de-identified data are exported from the clinical institutions, no PHI is sent to or stored on the cloud server.\n\nAll sites submitted the Trend project for review by their local Institutional Review Board (IRB); all but one of the 20 IRBs deemed the project \"exempt\" because of the absence of PHI export. 180 Thus the security requirements for the database and the controls necessary for storage and transport of de-identified data are significantly reduced. The detection counts and pathogen detection rates derived from the Trend data set for each 225 organism in the FilmArray RP are shown in Figure 2 . Other views of these data, including The pathogens' seasonal variability measured by percent detection can be classified into at least three groups. Group 1: The majority of organisms follow the classical \"respiratory\" season 240 (October through March) and increase by more than 10-fold above their baseline detection rate ( Figure 2C ). These include the CoVs, Flu A, Flu B, hMPV, the PIVs, and RSV (PIV3 is a slight exception to this rule in that it peaks in the summer months, and has a winter peak that is only detected regionally (data not shown)). Within this group, all but five viruses demonstrate significant biennial fluctuations; Flu B, hMPV, OC43, and PIV3 and RSV experience relatively 245 consistent annual peaks. Group 2: HRV/EV is in a class by itself in that it is detected in a high percentage of tests over time, (minimum of 10% in winter) and experiences moderate peaks of two to three fold outside the respiratory season baseline, in the early fall and spring ( Figure 2D ).

These three properties allow for a novel evaluation of co-detections. The observed rates of co-detections should be influenced by the number of circulating pathogens detected by the FilmArray RP test at a particular site. Figure 5A shows the average number of unique organisms detected at each site in a given week (see Methods: Calculation of co-detection rates). This number fluctuates from a 295 summer low of four to a winter high of 11 pathogens. Figure 5B (grey bars) shows that the total rate of organism co-detections in the Trend dataset fluctuates annually with peak rates occurring in the winter months. The average rates have been as high as 12% in the winter of 2016 and as low as 2% in the summer of 2014. 300 From the Trend data, a Measure of Interspecific Encounter (MIE) can be calculated as the probability of a co-detection, weighted by the prevalence of each circulating pathogen at a site.\n\nAlthough the value of the MIE metric is higher than the actual co-detection rate it correlates well All rights reserved.

This system already has many of the important properties of big data. We consider Trend in terms of the \"V\"s that are often used to describe big data: volume (amount), velocity (speed of acquisition), veracity (accuracy), variety (diversity of information) 315 and value (utility) [57, 62] .\n\nThe Trend RP dataset is growing at an average rate of >200,000 pathogen test results per month.\n\nConnecting the first 20 clinical sites has provided insight into the principal concerns that will be raised by the legal, IT and administrative departments of the healthcare providers that house 320 FilmArray instruments. It should be possible, therefore, to expand the Trend installed base by 10 to 20-fold over the next few years. Similarly, the existence of Trend should enable other IVD manufacturers to build their own Trend-like systems with greater acceptance on the part of their customers, thereby allowing a more global and comprehensive surveillance perspective.\n\nThe data in Figure 2 are similar to previous demonstrations of the seasonality associated with different respiratory viruses [63] [64] [65] [66] . What is novel is that this data is generated automatically, on site, and in close to real-time compared to other surveillance systems. Greater than 98% of the test results are exported to the Trend database within 24 hours of being generated. As part of the de-identification protocol, sequential FilmArray RP tests of the same type are put into the same 330 time bin. This has the effect that test results are exported faster during periods of peak use such as during the peak of the respiratory season or during an outbreak. Trend should be instrumental at a local level to determine the start of respiratory season; many hospitals make significant changes to their operations based on this event however, at present, data collection to track the respiratory season is often slow and manual, or semi-automated at best. 335 The key to implementing (Figure 3) , supporting the validity and utility of the Trend data. 380 A second source of concern in the Trend data set is a consequence of removal of sample identification such that we cannot directly determine whether the sample was from a patient or was a non-clinical sample (verification test, QC or PT) and should be removed from further epidemiological analysis. We estimate that non-patient testing makes up approximately 1.8% of the total FilmArray RP tests. Automated detection algorithms remove 3.5% of the total RP tests, 385 including approximately half of the non-clinical samples. With the exception of the four positive tests, the clinical samples removed by filtering should be a random sampling of all patient tests.\n\nThe remaining 1% fraction of non-patient tests have essentially no impact on the Trend evaluation of pathogen prevalence but they do make it more difficult to perform high resolution analysis of pathogen co-detections. This is especially true for co-detections of low prevalence 390 organisms where QC positives are likely to be more common than real positives. Future updates to the FilmArray software will simplify the process by which the instrument operator can tag tests of non-patient samples, thereby largely eliminating the need to filter such test results from the Trend database before analysis.\n\nT r e n d V a r i e t y :\n\nThe total positivity rate of the FilmArray RP test varies from a low of 38% in the summer months to a high of 75% in December and January, with a yearly average of approximately 60%. Figure 5A shows that the average number of different circulating pathogens at a single institution can vary from eight up to 11 during the winter months. Even during the peak periods of ILI, many respiratory infections are due to other viruses ( Figure 2C ) that can present clinically in a 400 All rights reserved.

Therefore, the presumption of an influenza infection based on reported influenza percent positivity, without diagnostic testing for the virus, can lead to the inappropriate use of anti-viral agents [70] . Conversely, without comprehensive testing, a negative influenza or RSV test can lead to prescription of an unnecessary antibiotic. FilmArray Trend data can be a valuable aid for antimicrobial stewardship programs because it provides real-time information 405 regarding the causes of respiratory infections and highlights the prevalence of viral infections.\n\nAs previously observed [66] , the viruses that share the winter seasonality of influenza demonstrate annual or biennial behavior. It is possible that the viruses that share an influenza- Detection of multiple respiratory viruses in the same patient has been reported before. In the 415 Trend dataset the rate of dual and triple co-detections was approximately 7.7 %, with HRV/EV as the organism most commonly observed in a co-detection. Some viruses, such as ADV and\n\nCoVs are detected in a mixed infection more than 50% of the time (Figure 4 ). In principle a FilmArray RP positive result may represent detection of residual pathogen nucleic acid from a previous infection that has resolved. However, several studies suggest that coinfections are 420 associated with more severe disease ( [71] [72] [73] , see also discussion in [74] ). In such cases, information about multiple detections can provide infection control practitioners with data that can assist in bed management and in the assessment of risk for nosocomial infections in a patient population that has been segregated by the occurrence of a common pathogen. Such information can prevent the introduction of a new pathogen associated with cohorting patients during busy 425 respiratory seasons [75] [76] [77] .\n\nThe question of whether different respiratory pathogens interfere with, or facilitate, growth in a human host is of some interest and not well understood. With the right data it can be studied at the population [78] , individual [79] , and cellular level [74] . Because the Trend data still includes 430 All rights reserved.

Rather we have taken a global approach and compared the overall rate of observed co-detections with MIE, which is a measure of the diversity of viruses circulating in a specific region and time period. MIE is similar, but not identical, to PIE (Probability of Interspecific Encounter [80] ), also referred to as the Gini-Simpson index (1-D, where D is the Simpson's 435 index [81, 82] ), which is used in ecology as a measure of the species diversity of a region.\n\nSimilarly, the circulating pathogen number of Figure 5A is identical to the Species Richness measure of ecology. We calculate MIE using frequencies (P i ) of pathogen positivity per FilmArray test and note that the sum of all pathogen frequencies can add up to more than 100% because of co-detections or be less than 100% because of the presence of negative tests. In this 440 regard, MIE differs from PIE because it is not a probability measure. infections at a rate that can be predicted by their observed abundance. Data however may be biased by the patient population tested and the type of respiratory disease. The data also does not rule out that there are particular respiratory pathogens that occur more or less often in mixed infections than predicted by their individual percent positivity rates. [74, 83] . As we improve our ability to remove non-patient test results from the Trend dataset we will be able to characterize 450 specific virus co-detection rates and their significance [65, 66, 78, 79, [84] [85] [86] .\n\nT r e n d V a l u e\n\nAs with weather forecasting, there is both a theoretical and a practical interest in predicting the next few weeks or months of the respiratory season [87] [88] [89] [90] . FilmArray Trend contributes to infectious disease forecasting efforts because the data is timely and comprehensive. As the 455 number of sites participating in Trend increases it will be possible to localize the reported infections to smaller geographical regions. At a high enough density of Trend sites, patterns of movement of respiratory pathogens across the US will become visible in a way that has not been easily observed before now. Likewise, an increase in the normalized metric, concomitant with an increase in negative tests, may indicate the occurrence of an outbreak caused by an emerging pathogen.\n\nPublic health agencies (PHAs), which include local and state health departments and the CDC, 480 are specifically exempt under an HIPAA provision that allows clinical laboratories to disclose PHI to the PHA for specified public health purposes [91] . The exemption includes follow up studies on reportable infectious diseases. Real-time pathogen specific syndromic surveillance systems such as Trend will allow state PHAs to more rapidly identify, acquire, and test residual samples from potential outbreaks. Conversely, perceived \"outbreaks\" may actually be 485 coincidental multi-organism seasonal surges, and rapid analysis by Trend-like systems could prevent timely and costly outbreak investigation.\n\nGiven the movement in healthcare technology towards greater vertical integration of a hospital's data, the Bottom-Out approach exemplified by Trend will face more competition from Top-Out 490 All rights reserved.

However, combining PHI with the diagnostic test result in the Top-Out approach makes these systems more complex and difficult to implement and may limit participation by health care institutions. Ironically, Bottom-Out data export systems have a role 495 to play in the development of Top-Out systems because Bottom-Out export provides a rapid and efficient means to quality check the data flowing from Top-Out systems. FilmArray Trend data could also be combined with data derived from other automated diagnostic platforms [92, 93] .\n\nThis work might best be accomplished by a third party that is viewed as independent and impartial. For example, in the case of data originating in the US, a federal institution or a private underappreciated pathogens, and clarify true disease epidemiology. Finally, systems like Trend will be essential for the rapid identification of disease anomalies indicating potential emergent outbreaks, thereby providing an independent tool for public health surveillance.\n\nAll rights reserved.

However, retrieving the date conflicts with the Safe Harbor approach because the date of a test is PHI (the year of the test is not PHI but working with just the year defeats the purpose of tracking prevalence through the season). For this reason we followed the Expert Determination approach to manage data export. 570 The study took into consideration data that are available on participating clinical laboratory FilmArray Instruments, BioFire's own customer database, the proposed Trend database and publicly available data sources.

For example, the time and date of the test are dynamically binned so that a minimum number of tests of one panel type are included in each bin prior to export. This ensures that a sufficient quantity of test results are uploaded to the database from one site at one time so that there is very low risk that patient identity can be 585 inferred from knowledge of the start time of the test.\n\nIf an adversary were to infiltrate the safeguards of the database, and wished to know specific patient test results from a specific location on a given day, no unique records would exist. The combination of deleting the sample identification (ID) field, binning the test date range, and 590 truncating the FilmArray pouch serial number ensures that the remaining information is never unique, which indicates that there is a low risk of misuse of data.\n\nAll rights reserved.
