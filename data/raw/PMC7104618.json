{"title": "Global networks and global change-induced tipping points", "body": "Global environmental change can unfold rapidly and sometimes irreversibly if anthropogenic pressures exceed critical thresholds. Such nonlinear change dynamics have been referred to as \u201ctipping points\u201d.1 Evidence indicates that many global environmental challenges such as coral reef degradation, ocean acidification, the productivity of agro-ecosystems, and critical Earth system functions such as global climate regulation display nonlinear properties that could imply rapid and practically irreversible shifts in bio-geophysical and social\u2013ecological systems critical for human well-being (Steffen et al. 2011; Rockstr\u00f6m et al. 2009; Lenton et al. 2008).\n\nThe potential existence of \u201ctipping points\u201d represents a substantial multilevel governance challenge for several reasons. First, it is difficult to a priori predict how much disturbances and change a system can absorb before reaching such a perceived \u201ctipping points\u201d (Scheffer et al. 2009; Scheffer and Carpenter 2003), a fact that seriously hampers, and even undermines preventive decision making (Galaz et al. 2010a; Barrett and Dannenberg 2012). It has also been argued that even with certainty about the location of a catastrophic \u201ctipping point,\u201d present generations still have an incentive to avoid costly preventive measures, and instead are likely to pass on the costs to future generations (Gardiner 2009, see also Brook et al. 2013; Schlesinger 2009). Second, the transgression of \u201ctipping points\u201d\u2014such as those proposed for coral reef ecosystems due to ocean acidification\u2014can have social\u2013ecological effects that occur over large geographical scales, creating difficult \u201cinstitutional mismatches\u201d as policy makers respond too late or at the wrong organizational level (Walker et al. 2009). Third, institutional fragmentation has been argued to seriously limit the ability of actors to effectively address perceived \u201ctipping point\u201d characteristics due to inherent system uncertainties, information integration difficulties, and poor incentives for collective action across different sectors and segments of society (Biermann 2012; Galaz et al. 2012).\n\nResearch initiatives such as the Earth System Governance Project have made important analytical advances the last few years (Biermann et al. 2012). This progress is particularly clear in research areas such as institutional fragmentation, segmentation, and interactions; the changing influence of non-state actors in international environmental governance; novel institutional mechanisms such as norm-setting and implementation; and changing power dynamics in complex actor settings (Young 2008; Biermann and Pattberg 2012; Oberth\u00fcr and Stokke 2011). The mechanisms which allow institutions and state and non-state actors to adapt to changing circumstances (by some denoted adaptiveness) are also gaining increased interest by scholars (Biermann 2007:333; Young 2010).\n\nAnother stream of literature elaborates a suite of multilevel mechanisms that seem to be able to \u201cmatch\u201d institutions with the dynamic behavior of social\u2013ecological systems (Dietz et al. 2003; Folke et al. 2005; Cash et al. 2006; Galaz et al. 2008; Pahl-Wostl 2009).\n\nDespite an increased interest, however, few empirical studies exist that explicitly explores the capacity of international actors, institutions, and global networks to deal with perceived \u201ctipping point\u201d dynamics in human\u2013environmental systems. As an example, recent syntheses of critical global environmental governance challenges in the Anthropocene identify important \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d for institutional reform, yet do not elaborate governance mechanisms critical for responding to nonlinear environmental change at global scales (Biermann et al. 2012; Kanie et al. 2012). This is troublesome considering that the human enterprise now affects systems with proposed nonlinear properties at the global scale (Steffen et al. 2011; Rockstr\u00f6m et al. 2009) and that the features of global environmental governance\u2014i.e., institutions and patterns of collaboration\u2014required to address \u201ctipping point\u201d changes are likely to be very different from those needed to harness incremental (linear) environmental stresses (Folke et al. 2005; Duit and Galaz 2008). While some of the challenges explored here have parallels to attempts to understand the features of international responses to international social nonlinear \u201csurprise\u201d phenomena such as financial shocks and other global risks (e.g., Claessens et al. 2010; OECD 2011), we are particularly interested in the \u201ctipping point\u201d dynamics created by coupled human\u2013environmental change.\n\nThere is an increasing need to empirically explore and theorize the way state and non-state actors perceive, respond to and try to prevent large-scale abrupt environmental changes. This is a challenging empirical task for several reasons. First, because the definitions of \u201cthresholds,\u201d their reversibility, and their scale remain contested issues. There is currently an intense scientific debate on the most appropriate way to define and delineate the correct spatial (local\u2013regional\u2013global) and temporal (slow\u2013fast) progression of thresholds (for example, see Brook et al. 2013, as well as debates about the \u201c2-degree\u201d climate target, Hulme 2012 in Knopf et al. 2012). Second, because the number and types of potential \u201ctipping points\u201d relevant for the study of biophysical systems at global scales are too large to be quantifiable, this makes it difficult to draw general conclusions from a limited set of cases studies. Third, while the governance challenges associated with \u201ctipping points\u201d have been studied extensively for local- and regional-scale human\u2013environmental systems such as forest ecosystems, freshwater lakes, wetlands, and marine systems (see Plummer et al. 2012  for a synthesis), governance challenges associated with global scale or global change-induced tipping point dynamics are seldom explored despite their identified urgency (Young 2011: 6).\n\nIn this study, we analyze current attempts by three global networks to address perceived \u201ctipping points\u201d induced by global change, here exemplified by the combined impacts of loss of marine biodiversity and ocean acidification, pending fisheries collapse, and infectious disease outbreaks, respectively. While these \u201ctipping points\u201d are in many ways different, they have one important thing in common: they are all globally occurring phenomena where the interplay between technological change, increased human and infrastructural interconnectedness, and continuous biophysical resource overexploitation creates possible \u201ctipping point\u201d dynamics (see definition below). This is what we here denote as \u201cglobal change-induced tipping points.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that the precise dynamics of the \u201ctipping points\u201d in each of the three cases differ and unfold at multiple scales ranging from local to regional and global (see Table 1 for details). Despite this diversity, the phenomena studied here all pose similar detection, prevention, and coordination challenges for social actors at multiple scales of social organization (as elaborated by, e.g., Adger et al. 2009; Pahl-Wostl 2009; Galaz et al. 2010a; Young 2011). Hence, they provide interesting and preliminary insights into the sort of multilevel governance challenges associated with nonlinear global change-induced change.\n\n\nOur ambition is twofold: firstly, we investigate how these global networks attempt to identify, respond to, and build capacity to address global change-induced \u201ctipping points.\u201d We do this by identifying and empirically illustrating four working propositions that theoretically seem to be essential for understanding adaptiveness in global networks in the face of \u201ctipping point\u201d changes. Secondly, we explore the interplay between perceptions of human\u2013environmental \u201ctipping points,\u201d international institutions, and collaboration patterns here operationalized as global networks. This perspective allows for a more cohesive view that combines both exogenous (i.e., perceived \u201ctipping point\u201d dynamics) and endogenous (i.e., information sharing mechanisms) factors (sensu Young 2010). We will return to this point in the end of the article. Note that, our ambition is not to \u201ctest\u201d the proposed features in a statistical sense, but rather to combine in-depth analysis of the case studies, with tentative suggestions that bring to light a number of intriguing and poorly explored issues. While the selection of cases does not provide the generalizability of larger-N studies, it does allow us to examine how the theoretically derived propositions play out in the three different cases, and also provides an opportunity to explore around the potential interplay between variables and causal mechanisms. Our ambition in the longer term is that the analysis presented here can underpin more systematic cross-case comparisons (cf. Gerring 2004). In some cases, this comparison could be done with \u201ctipping points\u201d which play out only in the social domain such as financial crises or responses to transnational security threats (e.g., World Economic Forum 2013).\n\nWe define \u201cglobal networks\u201d as globally spanning information sharing and collaboration patterns between organizations, including governmental and/or non-governmental actors. Each individual participating organization is not necessarily global, but the network as a whole is essentially international and aims to affect what is perceived as global-scale problems (c.f. Monge and Contractor 2003).\n\nOur analytical approach is relational as it focuses on broad patterns of collaborations among actors in global networks, and on how patterns of collaboration and modes of operation relate to these networks\u2019 abilities to address \u201ctipping points.\u201d It is particularly concerned with multiactor agency to understand changes in collaboration over time (Emirbayer and Goodwin 1994). Hence, the approach here differs and is complementary to other approaches such as \u201cepistemic communities\u201d and \u201cregime complexes.\u201d In the first case, the functions and membership of global networks are more diverse than those for epistemic communities as the networks of interest in this paper span beyond knowledge-based collaborations (Haas 1992, see however Cross 2012 for a wider definition). The analysis here also has some similarities to the studies of \u201cregime complexes\u201d (Orsini et al. 2013); however, our emphasis is not on the interplay between regimes or institutions (principles, norms, rules, decision-making procedures), but rather on the constellation, interplay, and functions that emerge between actors from a network perspective.\n\nWhile we do not quantitatively measure collaboration patterns, nor quantitatively assess governance outcomes or relationships between such outcomes and various characteristics of the studied global networks, our network perspective complements previous analyses of international environmental regimes (e.g., Young 2011) as it examines the evolution and function of globally spanning network collaboration patterns and their embeddedness within more formal rules (cf. Ansell 2006).\n\nVarious definitions for \u201ctipping points\u201d have been identified in the literature. Its theoretical origins can be traced to dynamical systems theory in the 1960s and 1970s, and has influenced a wide set of disciplines the last decades. Earth system scientists, for example, have explored nonlinear phenomena at different scales, with different degrees of reversibility and alternately defined these as \u201ctipping elements,\u201d \u201cswitch and choke points,\u201d or \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d at a global scale (Lenton et al. 2008; Rockstr\u00f6m et al. 2009b; Steffen et al. 2011).\n\nEcologists on the other hand find increasing evidence of ecosystem changes that are not smooth and gradual, but abrupt, exhibiting thresholds with different degrees of reversibility once crossed (Scheffer et al. 2009; Scheffer and Carpenter 2003). While \u201ctipping points\u201d thus refer to a variety of complex nonlinear phenomena (including the existence of positive feedbacks, bifurcations, and phase transitions with or without hysteresis effect), they also play out at different scales (from local to global) in very complex, poorly understood (Kinzig et al. 2006), and contested ways (Brook et al. 2013).\n\nLastly, we believe there is an irreducible social component in identifying, elaborating, and organizing around the existence of \u201ctipping points.\u201d The role of mental models, cognitive maps, belief systems, and collective meaning making in decision making has a long history in the study of agency in politics (Benford and Snow 2000; Campbell 2002) and natural resource management (Lynam and Brown 2011). These aspects related to perceptions clearly also play a role as scientists, governments, and other actors discuss and sometime disagree on their possible existence and appropriate responses (Galaz 2014:16ff). The important connection between mental models and goal-oriented action are causal beliefs\u2014perceptions of the causes of change\u2014and about the actions that can lead to a desired outcome (Milkoreit 2013:34f). It should be noted, however, that this study explores the processes of collaboration that occur after social actors implicitly have agreed upon causal beliefs associated with perceived \u201ctipping points.\u201d\n\nWe thus recognize the multifaceted and complex nature of the term. However, as our goal is to understand how global networks address a diversity of \u201ctipping points\u201d induced by global change, we opt for a definition that relates to phenomena exhibiting nonlinear and potentially irreversible change processes in human\u2013environmental systems, which require global responses (see Table 1). This definition is intended to capture global change-induced phenomena, which due to nonlinear properties such as synergistic feedbacks (c.f. Brook et al. 2013:2) have the potential to affect large parts of the world population (c.f. Lenton et al. 2008).\n\nOur definition is akin to the \u201ctipping elements\u201d identified by Lenton et al. (2008), but we chose to make a distinction for two reasons: (1) because we explicitly acknowledge that the dynamics that create the tipping points in focus comprise both natural and social processes; (2) the tipping points addressed here span beyond those of relevance for the climatic system in focus in Lenton et al. (ibid).\n\nOcean acidification is likely to exhibit critical tipping points associated with rapid loss of coral reefs, as well as complex ocean\u2013climate interactions affecting the oceans\u2019 capacities to capture carbon dioxide. The global arena for addressing these interrelated aspects of marine governance is characterized by a lack of effective coordination among the policy areas of marine biodiversity, fisheries, climate change, and ocean acidification. This has triggered collaboration between a number of international organizations within the Global Partnership for Climate, Fisheries and Aquaculture (henceforth Pacfa). Currently, this initiative includes representatives from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), WorldFish, The World Bank, and 13 additional international organizations (Galaz et al. 2011, see also Fig. 1).\n\nThe need for early and reliable warning of pending epidemic outbreaks has been a major concern for the international community since the mid-nineteenth century. Early warning and coordinated responses are critical in order to avoid transgressing critical epidemic thresholds at multiple scales (Heymann 2006). A multitude of networks with different focus and functions (such as surveillance, laboratory analysis, and pure information sharing) have emerged the last two decades as a means to secure early warning and response capacities across national borders. These networks (henceforth global epidemic networks) also span across organizational levels and include among other the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the Red Cross, Doctors without Borders. These networks facilitate responses to epidemic emergencies of international concern by providing early warning signals, rapid laboratory analysis, information dissemination, and coordination of epidemic emergency response activities on the ground (Galaz 2011) .\n\nThe data used in this article are drawn from previously published studies (see \u201cAppendix 2\u201d), but complemented with additional documents, and restructured with a focus on the four working propositions presented below. All cases used the same methodology, combining document studies, simple network analysis, and semi-structured interviews with key international actors (a total of about 65 interviews for all cases). Interviewees have been selected strategically to reflect an expected diversity of interests, resources, and role in the network collaboration of interest. The empirical material was restructured and complemented to capture (1) the perceived risk of \u201ctipping points\u201d with cross-boundary effects, including major uncertainties, threshold mechanisms, and time frames of relevance; (2) the global nature of the problem, including the aspects of institutional fragmentation; (3) emergence of the network and evolution over time; (4) current monitoring and coordination capacity of the network; (5) the most important outputs and outcomes of the network. A detailed, fully referenced and structured compilation of the cases is for space reasons, available as \u201cAppendix 2.\u201d\n\nAs a number of research fields\u2014ranging from studies of social\u2013ecological systems (Holling 1978; Folke et al. 2005; Galaz et al. 2010b), crisis management (Boin et al. 2005), global disaster risk reduction (Van Baalen and van Fenema 2009), and high-reliability management of complex technical systems (Pearson and Clair 1998)\u2014have explored, the capacity to continuously monitor, analyze, and interpret information about changing circumstances seems to be a prerequisite for adaptive responses. These information processing capacities are for example identified as critical by, e.g., Dietz et al. (2003:1908) in their elaboration of the features of governance, which support adaptiveness to environmental change; Van Baalen\u2019s and van Fenema\u2019s (2009) analysis of global network responses to epidemic surprise; and by Boin et al. (2005:140ff) and their synthesis of information processing capacities, which allow state and non-state actors to respond to crises (see also Comfort 1988; Dodds et al. 2003).\n\nWe therefore propose that the ability of global networks to anticipate and reorganize in the face of new information and changing circumstances will depend on access to information about system dynamics and the ability to interpret these to facilitate timely coordinated response.\n\nAs a number of studies in a diverse set of research fields suggest, responding to changing circumstances often requires drawing on the competences and resources of actors at multiple levels of social organization, often embedded in different organizational networks. For example, Folke et al. (2005) explore the need to build linkages between a diversity of actors at multiple levels to be able to successfully deal with nonlinear social\u2013ecological change (see also Pahl-Wostl 2009); Pearson and Clair\u2019s (1998:13) synthesis of organizational crises identify resource availability through external stakeholders as key for successful responses (see also Boin et al. 2005; Van Baalen and van Fenema 2009); Galaz et al. (2010a:12) synthesis also indicate that cross-level and multiactor responses are key for overcoming institutional fragmentation in responses to abrupt human\u2013environmental change; and Edelenbos et al. (2013) explore the features of \u201cconnective capacities,\u201d which allow coordinating actors to constructively connect to actors from different layers, domains, and sectors.\n\nTherefore, we propose that global networks need to build a capacity to coordinate actors at multiple levels and from different networks as they attempt to respond to potential \u201ctipping points\u201d of concern. It also seems reasonable that responses could focus on producing either a set of outcomes (regulation, polices, or supporting infrastructure) or outputs (behavioral changes with direct impacts on the system of interest, including coordinated action) (Young 2011).\n\nThe predictability of the timing and location of rapid unexpected changes is often limited. Hence, it is difficult to know beforehand exactly where and what kind of resources may be needed. As several scholars across disciplines have noted, developing and maintaining a diversity of resources is one way to help prepare for the unexpected. For example, Moynihan\u2019s (2008:361) analysis of learning in organizational networks indicates that the maintenance of actor and resource diversity in networks is fundamental for reducing strategic and institutional uncertainty (see also Koppenjan and Klijn 2004). Bodin and Crona (2009) explore the role of social networks in natural resource management and note that actor diversity is key for not only effective learning, but also provides a fertile ground for innovation. Social\u2013ecological scholars such as Folke et al. (2005:449), Low et al. (2003), and Dietz et al. (2003) also make a strong case for institutional and actor diversity as a prerequisite for coping with environmental change and as a factor that allows actors to quickly \u201cbounce back\u201d after shocks. These proposals bear resemblances with ideas inspired by cybernetic principles about the need to understand the impacts of \u201crequisite variety\u201d in governance, that is, the informational, structural, and functional redundancies that emerge as the result of inter-organizational collaboration in governance networks (Jessop 1998). It also has parallels existing studies about complexity leadership in network settings (Balkundi and Kilduff 2006; Hoppe and Reinelt 2010). To simplify the analysis, however, we focus less on the role of individual leaders, their cognition, and strategies, but rather on common structural properties and aggregated behavior across the cases.\n\nHence, we propose that global networks need to secure long-term access to a diversity of resources (human and economical), organizational forms (e.g., non-governmental to international organizations), and types of knowledge (e.g., scientific and context dependent) to be able to secure a capacity to monitor and respond in the longer term. These resources could comprise both physical and infrastructural investments (e.g., joint publications and monitoring systems), and immaterial resources, like information databases and access to expertise through relations to a diversity of actors. This third proposition does not suggests that the network necessarily maintains the resources itself (which may be difficult given its inherently distributed nature), but rather that it maintains the capacity to access a portfolio of resources of different kinds, and the collective ability to adaptively use these.\n\nA last feature that has been identified across disciplines as critical for multiactor responses seems to be legitimacy. \u201cLegitimacy\u201d is a multifaceted concept with multiple proposed sources (Downs 2000). Here, we refer to legitimacy as the \u201cgeneralized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate\u201d (Suchman 1995, 574). As Young (2011) summarizes it, the \u201c[m]aintenance of feelings of fairness and legitimacy is important to effectiveness, especially in cases where success requires active participation on the part of the members of the group over time.\u201d Legitimacy relates not only to the ability of actors to follow appropriate rules or procedures (input legitimacy) but also to deliver expected results in the face of perceived urgent issues of common interest (output legitimacy) (van Kersbergen and van Waarden 2004). Moynihan (2008) also notes that trust based on perceived legitimacy plays a key role in the coordination of multiple networks by reducing strategic uncertainty (pp. 357). We therefore propose that the perceived legitimacy of the main coordinating actor(s) will be critical for the operation of global networks in this context.\n\nWith these propositions to guide our analysis, we now turn to examine how the three cases of global networks attempt to anticipate, prevent, and respond to global change-induced \u201ctipping points.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, all cases feature the role of a few centrally placed actors responsible for continuous data gathering and exchange of information. This is both related to monitoring of specific aspects of a system (e.g., number and location of epidemic outbreaks, or reports of IUU fishing), as well as to the compilation and analysis of other types of knowledge exchange (e.g., policy documents, technical guidelines, and scientific information).\n\nThe mobility of IUU fishing vessels and associated products requires network members to be able to instantly coordinate action in order to stop illegal activities. The CCAMLR-IUU network has developed mechanisms for obtaining, processing, and sharing of information related to IUU fishing operations and trade flows, where the CCAMLR secretariat serves as an important network hub (\u00d6sterblom and Bodin 2012). This network benefits from several well-established compliance mechanisms developed over time, including an electronic catch documentation scheme and information collected from satellite monitoring of vessel activities (Miller et al. 2010). Non-state actors also contribute to monitoring by reporting suspected vessel sightings or trade flows (\u00d6sterblom and Bodin 2012). All information collected is reviewed annually by CCAMLR, where consensus decisions are taken to blacklist suspected vessels or impose other sanctions.\n\nSimilar features can be identified for information processing in global epidemic networks. Severe problems with national reporting of disease outbreaks spurred a new generation of Internet-based monitoring systems in the mid-1990s, including the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) hosted by Health Canada, combining Internet data-mining technologies and expert analysis, as well as global and moderated epidemic alert e-mail lists and platforms such as ProMED and HealthMap.org (Galaz 2011). These systems have vastly increased the amount of epidemic early warnings processed by key international organizations such as the WHO and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). These organizations are key actors through their capacities to continuously assess, verify, and disseminate incoming epidemic alerts.\n\nThe rich flows of information and elaborate verification mechanisms in these two networks are very different from those identified for Pacfa. Information flows in this network are considerably less formalized and instead center on establishing dialogue between centrally placed individuals who act as points of contact in different international and regional organizations. The importance of trust-based communication between coordinating actors is important for Pacfa as alliances are forged to link international negotiations, scientific knowledge and local knowledge, and field projects (Galaz et al. 2011). Here, therefore, information processing is not about monitoring a particular system variable (i.e., number of infected cases or reports of illegal fishing vessels), but rather on achieving coordination benefits for its members.\n\nHence, while information processing is important in all cases, it differs in content and function between the networks. The fact that the first two networks respond to well-defined problems (inception of illegal vessels in one region and the isolation of disease outbreak) and the last to more complex global challenges (i.e., global interlinked bio-geophysical dynamics) seems to make an important difference.\n\nWhile multilevel governance is a common feature of environmental polity in general (Winter 2006), governing \u201ctipping points\u201d requires a capacity among centrally placed actors, to rapidly pool resources from participating network members at multiple levels. Figure 2 is based on two case analyses (see \u201cAppendix 2\u201d for details) and illustrates these multilevel collaboration and information sharing processes.\n\n\nNational delegations to CCAMLR integrate several types of actors, including NGOs and fishing industry representatives, who in turn are also members in ASOC, the Antarctic Southern Ocean Coalition (a global NGO network) or COLTO\u2014Coalition of Legal Toothfish Operators (an industry network). This network can coordinate actors within matters of days and involve rapidly mobilizing capacity to apprehend illegal vessels (Fig. 2a).\n\nGlobal epidemic networks are also nested in a larger global network landscape, with a similar ability to rapidly react to epidemic early warnings, including the identification of the SARS coronavirus, analysis and response to an unknown form of influenza in Madagascar, and prevention of epidemics of yellow fever in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Senegal. Which national, regional, or international organization that becomes the central coordinator depends on the disease agent and location of interest. However, the WHO Global Outbreak and Response Network (GOARN) and the FAO Emergency Centre that facilitates coordination for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) (Fig. 2b) are well-known key coordinating players.\n\nWhile the Pacfa network does not respond to rapidly unfolding system dynamics per se, it tries to identify political opportunities in international policy arenas as a way to prevent \u201ctipping points\u201d related to marine systems and biodiversity. Hence, the coordination challenges across multiple levels are similar as those identified for the other two networks, but with a different focus. For example, while a overall network aim was initially to influence international climate negotiations in Copenhagen 2009 to integrate marine issues, the path toward this goal consisted of multiple coordinated actions at multiple levels (from assessing potential adaptation needs locally, communicating these, and influencing national delegations at side events to COP15). This required a capacity among a core group of actors (FAO) to tap into resources and knowledge across levels and networks, including international scientific institutions (such as ICES), international organizations (World Bank), and place-based research NGOs (WorldFish) (Galaz et al. 2011).\n\nMaintaining response capacity over time requires maintaining access to diverse resources and competences. All three cases examined here have evolved through time by strategically expanding the membership of the network to increase their \u201cportfolio diversity.\u201d CCAMLR hosts and funds strategic training workshops in regions where effective response capacities have been viewed as lacking (e.g., in Southern Africa and Malaysia). Several member countries cooperate extensively around offshore monitoring and training, in order to improve the joint enforcement capacity of the network (\u00d6sterblom and Bodin 2012). Actors within the network\u2014coordinated nationally, between organizations or between groups of countries\u2014also continuously develop suggestions for new and revised policy measures to address IUU fishing.\n\nGlobal epidemic networks have stretched over time as the result of an explicit strategy to expand international surveillance and response networks, particularly in epidemic hot-spot regions where surveillance is weak (e.g., Asia and Africa) and for diseases perceived as critical for the international community (such as avian influenza). The expansion is both strategic and crisis-driven, and involves continuous capacity building through workshops, conferences, and guidelines (e.g., Heymann 2006).\n\nSimilarly, Pacfa has expanded membership in parts of the world where representation is missing and where tangible field presence could prove useful for attempts to link local governance to global institutional processes. It has also included member organizations of various types\u2014from NGOs to scientific organizations\u2014as an explicit strategy to increase skills and resource portfolios. This has also proven as a fruitful way to create a platform for exchange of knowledge, ideas, and information among members. This seems to improve the network\u2019s capacity to coordinate local responses (such as improved local marine governance in the face of ocean acidification) and integrate scientific advice into negotiation texts for international policy improvement (Galaz et al. 2011).\n\nThe synthesis indicates that issues of legitimacy are constantly being debated in all networks, but that their responses differ. In general, however, centrally placed actors seem to build legitimacy by strategically enhancing the diversity and number of members, increasing the degree of formalization in what originally were informal collaboration mechanisms, and by encouraging the entrenchment of the networks in various UN organizations.\n\nCooperation within CCAMLR to address IUU fishing emerged in a context where there was a significant risk of fish stock collapse, but where governments were unable to effectively act due to political sensitivities and constraints posed by consensus mechanisms in the network (\u00d6sterblom and Bodin 2012). Controversial and unorthodox methods for conveying the importance of addressing IUU fishing were instead developed by a small NGO\u2013fishing industry coalition in the mid-1990s (\u00d6sterblom and Sumaila 2011). A few governments in parallel also began exerting diplomatic pressure on member states of the Commission that were associated with illegal fishing, for example as flag, or port states or with their nationals working on board IUU vessels or as owners of associated companies.\n\nThis has at times resulted in substantial controversy and heated debate between member states about responsibilities and the role of NGOs in CCAMLR. Joint enforcement operations in the Southern Ocean have been described as pushing the edge of international law (Gullett and Schofield 2007), and suspected offenders have stated that they do not recognize existing territorial claims in the CCAMLR area as legitimate (Baird 2004). Continuous improvements of conservation measures and decision-making processes in CCAMLR have proven important for securing legitimacy of procedures. Legitimacy issues are also addressed by making Commission reports available online (except for background reports and reports containing diplomatically sensitive material).\n\nThe Pacfa has also struggled to balance legitimacy and efficiency. As the goal to influence the UNFCCC process emerged, the ambitions of Pacfa also become more explicitly political. This created tensions in the network between actors wanting to achieve tangible outcomes (and thus output legitimacy), and those concerned with overstepping their respective organizations\u2019 mandate (thus maintaining input legitimacy). A clear fault line with respect to this was observed between central international organizations and those representing science-based organizations in the buildup to the climate negotiations in Copenhagen 2009. While most of the activities initially evolved through the work of a few centrally placed actors with modest formal support from the FAO and its member states (Galaz et al. 2011), the network has become increasingly formalized and recently became a UN Oceans-Taskforce, which is likely to increase the network\u2019s input legitimacy in the UN system.\n\nAddressing the risks of novel infectious disease outbreaks has been very high on the political agenda for the last decade, especially in the face of recurrent outbreaks of novel animal influenzas with the capacity to infect humans. Information processing and coordination work is currently supported through the revised International Health Regulation (IHR). However, this cooperation model orchestrated by the WHO has also raised severe issues of both input and output legitimacy, especially issues such as the role of scientific advice and the influence of pharmaceutical companies; vaccination recommendations associated with the last pandemic outbreak (\u201cswineflu\u201d A/H1N1); and unequal global access to treatments. This has led to repeated calls for governance reforms aiming to increase transparency, effectiveness, and benefit sharing.\n\nIt should be noted that border protection issues, primarily associated with the fear of new terror attacks after September 11 2001 in the form of intentional releases of novel diseases, have triggered substantial investments in global epidemic monitoring and response networks for disease outbreaks. Analogous national security concerns in Australia after the national elections in the year of 2001, and the Bali bombings in 2002, likely contributed to an increased political opportunity to invest substantially in monitoring technologies for the Southern Ocean, as border protection became \u201csecuritized\u201d (\u00d6sterblom et al. 2011). In addition, international cooperation and exchange of information between compliance officers has increased substantially after the terrorist attacks in New York City in 2001. The expansion of the studied two networks described here thus appears to be linked to the securitization of the issue areas, which may have important implications for their perceived legitimacy in the future (c.f. Curley and Herington 2011).\n\nYet, it would be a mistake to discard global networks as mere \u201csymptom treatment.\u201d The issues elaborated here not only exemplify how interacting institutions affect human\u2013environmental systems at global scales (Gehring and Oberth\u00fcr 2009). The cases also display how global networks attempt to complement functional gaps in the complex institutional and actor settings in which they are embedded. The perceived \u201csense of urgency\u201d (i.e., avoiding the next pandemic, coping with potentially rapid ecological shifts in marine systems, or avoiding large-scale fish stock collapses) seemingly triggers the emergence of global networks created by concerned state and non-state actors. Figure 3 illustrates this proposed interplay between international institutions, perceptions of \u201ctipping points,\u201d and global networks.\n\n\nBy shaping state and non-state action, international institutions play a critical role in affecting the creation of potential global change \u201ctipping points\u201d (a in Fig. 3) (Young 2008, 2011). These perceived \u201ctipping points\u201d also create mixed incentives (b) for collective action. While coordination failure is likely due to actor, institutional, and biophysicial complexity (Young 2008), the perceived urgency of the issue can also create incentives for action among international state and non-state actors, and spur the emergence of global networks based on common causal beliefs (b). These networks can support the enforcement (c) of existing international institutions through their ability to process information and coordinate multinetwork collaboration, as well as create the endogenous and exogenous pressure needed to induce changes in international institutions. As Young notes, these sort of self-generating mechanisms can help build adaptability (d) and combat \u201cinstitutional arthritis\u201d (Young 2010, 382).\n\nFor example, the emergence of novel zoonotic diseases (such as avian influenza) is intrinsically linked to the effectiveness of a suite of institutional rules at multiple levels, e.g., though urbanization, land-use change, and technological development (interplay). The potential of these diseases to rapidly transgress dangerous epidemic thresholds creates incentives for joint action, in this case through the emergence of global early warning and response networks, despite malfunctioning formal institutions (e.g., IHRs before the year 2005). As nation states agreed to reform the IHRs in 2005, the revisions built on technical standards, organizational operation procedures, and norms developed by WHO-coordinated networks years in advance (adaptability) (Heymann 2006).\n\nA similar mechanism seems to be at play for illegal, IUU fisheries. As the regional mandate of the existing international governance institution for IUU fishing proved insufficient (interplay), and the perceived threat of potential detrimental \u201ctipping points\u201d was perceived as valid (incentives), state and non-state actors increasingly developed their networks to operate at the global level, thereby drastically improving the enforcement capacities of existing international rules (\u00d6sterblom and Sumaila 2011).\n\nInternational actors trying to prepare for the possibly harmful human well-being implications of ocean acidification and rapid loss of marine biodiversity, also illustrate this triad. As these actors perceive the possible transgression of human\u2013environmental \u201ctipping points\u201d (incentives), they coordinate their actions in global networks to increase their opportunities to bring additional issues to existing policy arenas created by international institutions (adaptability). At the same time, these institutions fundamentally affect the biophysical, technological, and social drivers that affect the \u201ctipping points\u201d at hand (interplay, e.g., the Convention on Biological Diversity, climate change agreements under the UNFCCC, and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea).\n\nThe analysis is only tentative of course, especially considering the small number of cases, the contested nature of \u201ctipping points,\u201d and the need to explore additional working propositions. For example, we have not elaborated the cognitive and leadership processes leading up to a joint problem definition among the collaborating actors, nor a number of associated issues such as transparency and accountability in complex actor settings.\n\nHowever, the analysis brings together a number of theoretically and empirically founded propositions worth further attention. More precisely, how state and non-state actors perceive and frame global change-induced \u201ctipping points,\u201d the unfolding global network dynamics, and how these are shaped by international institutions (Fig. 3) remain an interesting issue to explore further by scholars interested in the governance of a complex Earth system."}
