{"title": "Donor-derived infection\u2014the challenge for transplant safety", "body": "Organ transplantation is the therapy of choice for end-stage organ failure. Each year, over 70,000 organs are transplanted worldwide. Unexpected transmission of infection from donors to recipients is infrequent, but few data exist that bear directly on the degree of risk of transmission of donor-derived infection through transplantation.1,2,3 Transplanted organs might come from donors with unknown or asymptomatic infections, or could be contaminated during procurement or implantation. Transmission of infection is facilitated by the viable cells of vascularized organs. Moreover, immunosuppressive drugs used to prevent immunological attack on the grafts, or graft rejection, may amplify the risk of infection carried by the donor organ. For example, West Nile virus (WNV) has been reported to cause invasive neurologic infection more often in immunocompromised organ recipients than in normal individuals.4,5,6,7 In immunocompromised hosts with a diminished inflammatory response, signs and symptoms of infection are reduced and the incidence of infection is often underestimated.\n\nReporting of suspected or documented donor-derived transmission events is required in the USA and voluntary in many other countries. Unexpected disease transmission occurs in less than 1% of solid organ recipients.8,9 By contrast, hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is transmitted with screened blood products in less than one in 2\u20133 million units transfused.1,2,3 Screening processes for blood products allow confirmatory testing and enable discarding of potentially contaminated blood, but the limited supply of organs and the urgent need to implant them to preserve organ function after procurement from deceased donors precludes prolonged screening processes or the discarding of potentially useful grafts. Few data are available that directly assess the risk of disease transmission with organ transplants;1,2,3 such studies are difficult and costly to perform.\n\nMicrobiological screening of potential organ donors is improving with the availability of new assays such as nucleic acid testing (NAT) or advanced antibody tests. However, the availability of such assays and the proficiency of the clinical laboratories, as well as the national regulations governing reporting of adverse events and donor screening, vary worldwide.1,2,8,9,10,11,12 Some regions, including parts of South America, Africa and Asia lack requirements for reporting of adverse events in transplantation. In addition, organs are increasingly shared across international borders. Identification of clusters of infections associated with organ transplantation has resulted in reassessment of screening processes for organ donors.1,2,4,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 In this article, we review the major risk factors for organ-donor-derived transmission of infection and opportunities to reduce the incidence of such events.\n\nHistorically, transmission of most bacterial infections has been prevented by the use of surgical prophylaxis with antibacterial therapies given around the time of transplant surgery. With the emergence of multidrug antimicrobial resistant (MDR) bacteria and yeast species, however, routine prophylaxis might fail to prevent transmission of organisms present in the donor organ or the bloodstream at the time of procurement.24,25,26,27 Increasingly common MDR organisms include extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) and other carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE). When transmitted, morbidity caused by these pathogens among organ recipients is high.28,29 Among possible risk factors for donor colonization with MDR organisms are prolonged (>7 days) stays in intensive care units, critical illness requiring vasopressor support and the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.30 Unfortunately, in some donors, hospitalization of 2 days is sufficient to acquire MDR infection.31\n\nClinical experience suggests that some respiratory-colonized CRKP-positive or CRAB-positive organ donors may be considered as candidate donors for organs other than the lungs but that close follow-up of recipients is mandatory. Similarly, if the donor has a positive urine culture for CRKP or CRAB, transplantation of their kidneys should be avoided unless the infection is eradicated. Some risk exists for unrecognized bacteraemia caused by these organisms; in the presence of MDR bacteraemia, transplantation of any organ should be avoided. The efficacy of appropriate antimicrobial treatment of the donor before organ procurement on the basis of in vitro susceptibility data, in preventing recipient infection, is not known. In general, some period of effective therapy should also be considered for the recipient after transplantation.\n\nThe results of microbiological cultures obtained at the time of organ donation might not be available until after implantation; given such delays, organ recipients may be at an increased risk of donor-derived infection.32 Rapid communication of complete microbiological susceptibility data by the organ procurement organization to the clinical centre is essential to guide management. Such recipient infections may not be recognized as donor-derived and may be more resistant to therapy in the immunocompromised host, potentially contributing to organ loss (for example, mycotic aneurysm of the graft blood vessels) or death. Thus, when possible, infections should be identified and fully treated in the donor before procurement.6,10,14,32,33,34,35,36 Decisions regarding the use of organs that might be infected with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens must be made on an individual basis.\n\nPotential organ recipients are increasingly travelling abroad to reduce the cost of, and waiting time for, transplantation. Donor screening in some regions is limited; in countries where payment for organ donation is legal, donors may tend to come from low socioeconomic strata and endemic infections such as tuberculosis, malaria, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis might be more common than in unpaid or deceased donors. In case series from Turkey, Canada and California, many renal recipients who travelled abroad for organs developed severe infections, often requiring hospitalization.37,38,39,40 Travellers who are organ donors or so-called 'transplant tourists' might become colonized with highly resistant strains of 'superbugs' including vancomycin-resistant staphylococci and MDR enterobacteriaceae. Among these newer isolates, a carbapenemase enzyme called New Delhi Metallo-\u03b2-lactamase-1 (NDM-1), which makes bacteria resistant to a wide range of antimicrobial agents, was first identified in 2008 in India, and has since been detected worldwide.41,42 This resistance trait compromises the efficacy of almost all \u03b2-lactam antimicrobials, including the carbapenems. Therapeutic options for infections with this type of resistant bacteria are largely limited to colistin, tigecycline and fosfomycin. Although this carbapenemase constitutes a critical medical issue, no NDM-1 infection has yet been reported in the transplant setting.\n\nHighly resistant strains of bacteria are thought to emerge under antimicrobial pressure in hospitals and in animals used for meat consumption, and via contamination of fruit, vegetables and farmed seafood. These bacteria have been observed in patients and travellers from China, India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the Balkans, Australia and other regions.37,38,39,40 Knowledge of specific infections that exist in regions that provide transplant services might guide patient evaluation. Transplant tourists might also provide a vector for the transmission of new MDR organisms to medical institutions. Consequently, horizontal transmission of MDR pathogens to other patients could occur, which could lead to institution-wide outbreaks of infection. Stringent infection control measures to control the spread of MDR organisms should be implemented whenever such resistant pathogens are recognized.\n\nThe risk for transmission of HBV from infected donors is illustrative of the potential organ-specificity of pathogen transmission and the importance of vaccination in transplant populations. Transmission of HBV is common in the absence of prophylaxis based on available data for liver transplant recipients. In a recent review, the rate of de novo HBV (DNH) infection without prophylaxis was 58% (81 of 140 patients) in HBV non-immune recipients, but was only 18% (6 of 34 patients) in previously vaccinated individuals, 14% (5 of 35 patients) in isolated recipients who were anti-HBcAg-positive (that is, positive for antibody to HBV core antigen), and 4% (3 of 70 patients) in naturally immune recipients.43 This experience has produced a series of preventive strategies to prevent DNH in HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative recipients. A 2007 survey revealed that indefinite antiviral therapy was commonly employed, with lamivudine as the preferred antiviral agent; antivirals were variably supplemented with HBV hyperimmune globulin (HBIG).44 Although entecavir and tenofovir have supplanted lamivudine in the treatment of chronic HBV infection and often for prophylaxis of liver transplant recipients from anti-HBcAg-positive donors, a new study using a Markov model has now demonstrated that lamivudine remains the most cost-effective option for preventing DNH in the context of anti-HBcAg-positive donors.45,46\n\nIn heart and kidney transplant recipients, the limited available data suggest that the risk of HBV transmission using organs from anti-HBcAg-positive donors is low, with or without post-transplant antiviral prophylaxis.47 The available studies are often limited by the absence of baseline data on the serologic status (presence of anti-HBs and HBsAg) and immunosuppressive regimens of donors and recipients that may affect transmission risk. Early studies in heart transplant recipients without prophylaxis did not reveal any HBV transmission in >80 patients, some of whom were likely vaccinated before transplant.47 Use of these donor hearts should be considered safe and may help to augment the available donor pool.47 Of interest, HBV seropositivity in the donor or recipient may be associated with an increased risk of cardiac allograft vasculopathy.48\n\nThe risk of transmission of HBV from an anti-HBcAg-positive, HBsAg-negative donor to a HBV-naive kidney recipient varies from 0% to 27%.49 The definition of transmission is highly variable and includes acquisition of anti-HBsAg and anti-HBcAg; most studies did not require acquisition of HBsAg or detection of HBV DNA in case definition. The risk of transmission is, again, influenced by recipient HBV immunity and possibly by prophylaxis.50 In a review of nine studies with 1,385 evaluable HBsAg-negative recipients of kidneys from anti-HBcAg-positive donors, new HBV serologic markers were observed in only 45 (3.2%) patients and the rate of HBsAg acquisition was only 0.28% (four patients) with no evidence of symptomatic hepatitis.51 This study did not explore the influence of recipient anti-HBsAg status or use of prophylactic therapy. Patient or graft outcomes were not worse among patients with HBsAg acquisition or evidence of anti-HBsAg or anti-HBcAg seroconversion.\n\nGiven the donor organ shortage, the temptation to 'stretch the limits' on donation is almost irresistible. Unresolved issues include the optimal duration of therapy for donors with bacteraemia or tuberculosis and with meningitis or encephalitis of unknown aetiology, and the optimal prophylaxis for organs from donors who are infected with HBV, HCV, human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) or human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV).6,20,21,32,33,34,35,36 When organs are used from infected donors, microbiologic follow-up of the recipients is essential. On the basis of risk factors identified in the donor, re-testing of the recipient of 'increased risk' donor organs is now mandated in the USA and elsewhere (at baseline, 1 month and 3 months post-transplantation) for HIV, HCV and HBV, and recommended for syphilis. Most experts also recommend a long period of monitoring (6 and 12 months) and storage of samples of donor and recipient blood, plasma and cells for future testing. National guidelines are needed for use of organs from donors with known infections.6\n\nUnexpected transmission of donor-derived infection is estimated to occur in less than 1% of solid organ transplant recipients.9 Clusters of infections, including M. tuberculosis, fungi, herpes simplex virus (HSV), HHV-8, LCMV, rabies virus, T. cruzi, microsporidiosis, HIV and HCV, have been found in multiple recipients who have received organs from a single donor (Box 1).2,4,10,13,14,15,17,18,19,21,52,53,54,55,56 These infections are most often caused by pathogens that may be amplified in the immunosuppressed host but are asymptomatic or masked in the normal organ donor by other clinical syndromes such as trauma or stroke. Individual transmission events might not be recognized unless clinical manifestations develop. For example, donor-derived chronic hepatitis E virus infection transmission was identified in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients during evaluation for clinical hepatitis in Europe and the USA.57,58 In the absence of systems to automate the detection and reporting of post-transplantation infections among clinical centres and procurement organizations, recognition of these events is dependent on clinical suspicion by the transplantation teams.\n\nConfirmation of donor-derived-infection transmission events in organ recipients, notably in the face of unusual pathogens, requires specialized clinical laboratories and epidemiologic investigation by public health authorities. International consensus definitions of donor-derived infections have been developed.59 Testing donors for all potential pathogens is impossible as assays for all organisms do not exist and such requirements would substantially delay transplantation. Clinical recognition of unusual clinical syndromes in clusters of organ recipients from single donors in the USA and Australia resulted in the development of new NAT assays for LCMV and related viruses. Application of nonspecific, high-throughput sequencing tools with the capacity to detect any unusual nucleic acid sequences in the blood was diagnostic of a new arenavirus in a cluster of fatal transplant-associated infections when standard microbiological techniques had failed.18,52\n\nCurrently, anti-HIV-1 or anti-HIV-2 reactive status in potential donors is a contraindication for organ donation in all European countries and was only recently legalized for HIV-positive recipients in the USA. Three HIV-infected donors have been used inadvertently after false-negative testing or erroneous reporting, resulting in transmission of the virus into uninfected recipients.23,60,61 Although most disease transmissions have involved deceased donors, recent unexpected transmissions of HIV and HCV have shown that recipients of organs from living donors may also be at risk.22,57 Donor-derived HIV transmissions have generally had bad outcomes; however, three patients who received organs from an HIV-infected donor in an Italian cluster, including two kidney transplant recipients, are still alive with undetectable HIV-RNA, good CD4+ T-cell counts and functioning grafts more than 7 years after transplantation (P. Grossi, unpublished work).\n\nTransmissions of donor-derived HTLV have been reported. The natural history of HTLV-1 transmission from donor to recipient is unknown given suboptimal screening platforms and the lack of long-term follow-up. The only definitive cases of transmission of solid-organ donor-derived HTLV-1-associated disease emerged from Spain.62,63 Seronegative recipients of two kidneys and one liver developed HTLV-1-associated myelopathy within 2 years of transplantation with virus of identical sequence to that of the donor.62,63 The donor had asymptomatic, congenital infection. No donor-derived HTLV-1-associated deaths have been reported. On the basis of data from countries with a low prevalence of HTLV-1, such as Europe and the USA, and owing to the current shortage of donor organs, assessment of every donor for HTLV-1 is no longer considered to be essential. Current screening methods cannot differentiate between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infections and false-positive screening assays are common.64 The utility of HTLV-1 screening is uncertain in the absence of long-term follow-up data; such screening can only be recommended for endemic areas and in endemic populations.\n\nOver the past several years, emerging pathogens such as WNV have been identified as sources of donor-derived infections. Transmission of WNV through organ transplantation was described in 2002 in four recipients of organs from a single donor.4 This route of transmission is rare; screening of organ donors for WNV is not routine and remains controversial. A long turnaround time for results, unproven test performance, and limited test availability have made such routine testing impractical. Furthermore, transmission of WNV has occurred in the absence of detectable viraemia or seroconversion in organ donors.65,66 Low viral loads in blood and a short duration of viraemia in normal individuals present major problems for nucleic acid amplification testing. The kidney may be a site of prolonged WNV replication and shedding in animals and humans.67,68,69 Thus, urine samples could be more appropriate than blood for WNV testing in organ donors in the future.70 Prospective studies are needed to verify the utility of routine WNV testing in urine (or blood) of organ donors.\n\nRabies causes acute encephalitis that is nearly uniformly fatal in unvaccinated hosts. Although the virus is present in animal reservoirs, infection in humans is rare in the USA and Europe. In two clusters of rabies virus transmission through organ transplantation attributed to a bat and a canine rabies virus variant, all non-vaccinated recipients developed initially unrecognized rabies symptoms within 6 weeks of transplantation and died.71,72 These observations suggest a high rabies infectivity rate and abbreviated incubation period in unvaccinated immunosuppressed recipients of solid organs.73\n\nSimilar issues with disease recognition have occurred with recent clusters of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) caused by the free-living amoeba. Three transplant-associated clusters of encephalitis caused by the amoebae Balamuthia mandrillaris have demonstrated a risk associated with solid organ transplantation from donors with PAM.74,75 Persons of Hispanic ethnicity may be disproportionately affected.76 Unrecognized skin lesions may precede encephalitis by months to years.\n\nAs the pool of foreign donors increases, unusual infections such as malaria, tuberculosis, Chagas disease, or strongyloidiasis represent a growing threat to transplant recipients. In the USA, endemic fungi (such as Histoplasma in the mid-west and Coccidioides in the south-west regions) represent a notable risk, and routine prophylaxis is applied to many recipients, notably those of lung transplants. The differential diagnosis of fever or encephalitis within the first weeks after transplantation should include donor-derived pathogens.\n\nSerological testing for infections has been highly effective in donor screening. However, seroconversion requires the elaboration of antibodies against a specific pathogen and could be delayed for several weeks after infectious exposure. This window period is likely to result in a false-negative test result and could result in inadvertent transmission of infection (Figure 1).22,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97 NAT assays detect viral nucleic acids directly or following signal amplification with greater sensitivity and specificity than does serologic testing. As a result, the window period for HIV detection using NAT is reduced from 22\u2013180 days (by using antibody screens) to 5.6\u201310.2 days\u2014a minimum 12 day reduction in potential recipient exposure using NAT instead of serology (Figure 1). Similar reductions in the window period are observed for HCV and HBV detection (Table 1).86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98 The 'residual risk' of infectious transmission in the face of false-negative serologic and NAT testing is estimated to be low for HIV and HCV (Table 2). However, in outbreaks of WNV, false-negative results were detected for both serologic and NAT assays, suggesting that dual testing is beneficial for some untreatable infections.\n\nThe quality of laboratory testing is an essential component in the safety paradigm for transplantation and is dependent on the assay performed, the quality of the specimen tested and laboratory techniques.1,2 The assay may lack the required sensitivity or specificity or may be improperly performed, the specimen may become degraded or contaminated in handling, or the data may be erroneously recorded or communicated. Internal quality controls for laboratory procedures are essential and the quality, performance characteristics and limitations of assays must be tracked by organ procurement organizations. The cost of the infrastructure required and the need to assure the maintenance of proficiency may dictate the use of regional or validated 'central testing laboratories' in organ donor screening. Assay data may not be comparable between laboratories that use different commercial tests or laboratory-developed (so-called 'home brew') reagents. New tests developed in the face of a changing epidemiology may lack validation in large clinical populations. False-positive and false-negative tests could occur as a result. Validation of new assays is difficult, as validation studies in deceased or living donor populations, and for rare pathogens (such as rabies and LCMV), are almost impossible to perform.\n\nIntroduction of a new assay into the screening panel requires consideration of whether the assay has been validated and can be performed in the relevant clinical laboratories. For example, even in endemic regions, introduction of serologic tests for hepatitis E has been problematic owing to sensitivity issues and difficulties in performing RNA\u2014NAT reliably. Such assays may be used to allocate or discard organs. Tests for life-threatening or untreatable diseases require assays that optimize sensitivity. Thus, confirmatory tests and internal controls must be employed to detect false-positive or false-negative tests.\n\nA broad array of organisms may be transmitted with the living cells of transplanted organs. Donor screening has improved with the availability of sensitive microbiological assays that target common pathogens. The incidence of infectious diseases resulting from donor-derived infection is low, although exact data are lacking and some infections are probably not detected. Because immunocompromised recipients develop diseases of unusual severity with infections of low native virulence, they are sentinels for new or unusual infections in the community. This patient population has been especially affected by, for example, inadvertent transmission of HCV, WNV and Chagas disease in the absence of highly sensitive testing. The key element in the detection of donor-derived infection remains suspicion on the part of the clinicians who care for organ recipients. The presentations of donor-derived infections have often been obscure, including unexplained and culture-negative encephalitis, weakness, fever, thrombocytopenia, lymphocytosis, erythema of surgical incisions and graft dysfunction. Both organ procurement organizations and public-health authorities should be engaged in the evaluation of such incidents. Microbiological identification of donor-derived pathogens in transplant recipients is important to enable appropriate therapy for affected individuals, and to recognize outbreaks of infectious diseases in immunocompromised hosts before these pathogens affect the broader population.\n\nTesting protocols must be adapted to the known or changing epidemiology of disease and incorporate new technologies for microbiological screening. Screening technologies may incorporate new high-throughput genetic sequencing for new sequences in circulation or multiplexed assays targeting many specific pathogens simultaneously in a single assay.99,100 Identification of potential pathogens after organ implantation also has important implications for the need for rapid communication of microbiological data or clinical suspicion between clinical laboratories, clinical centres, procurement organizations and public-health authorities. Prospective research is required to clarify the incidence of disease transmission and the optimal panels of microbiological assays for donor screening.\n\nImproved coordination of information must be facilitated between public-health authorities, clinical centres, patients and tissue and organ procurement groups. Standards for investigation and reporting, terminology and data sharing of potential transmission events will enhance the safety of organ transplantation worldwide.\n\nWe obtained all papers that were used in the development of USPHS 2013 guidelines and original articles published between 1975 and 2014 and indexed in MEDLINE and PubMed based on the search terms \u201cdonor-derived\u201d, \u201ctransmission\u201d, \u201corgan transplantation\u201d and \u201cinfection\u201d, alone and in combination.
