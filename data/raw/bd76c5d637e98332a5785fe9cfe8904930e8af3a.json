{"title": "Mapping neuroinvasiveness of the herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis-inducing strain 2762 by the use of monoclonal antibodies", "body": "Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) may sometimes cause an acute, focal encephalitis ; a disease which is frequently lethal and with lasting sequele in spite of adequate antiviral treatment. 1,2 Although HSV-1 is a common cause of acute encephalitis, the disease might still be considered a rare complication among those infected regarding the ubiquitary character of this virus .' The reason why HSV-1 sporadically enters the central nervous system to cause devastation is not known . Host factors, such as immunosuppression, have not appeared to be of importance in typical cases . ' Efforts have been made to define genes responsible for the neurovirulence of HSV-1 by either deletion of regions of interest 45 with resulting avirulence of the deletion mutants, or by using an avirulent HSV-Author to whom correspondence should be addressed . 0890 -8508/92/010041 + 09 $03 .00/0 41 1 x HSV-2 intertypic recombinant in which virulence was restored after rescue with cloned HSV-1 fragments .' , ' Both these approaches have identified a region close to the LS junction and comprising the gene product ICP 34 . 5 as essential for infection of mouse neuronal cells .\n\nClinical oral isolates of HSV-1 are as a rule neurovirulent in animal models, 8-10 yet have not induced encephalitis in their human hosts . Hence, the role of HSV-1 neurovirulence in the pathogenesis of HSE is still unknown . We have approached this question by comparing brain-derived HSV-1 isolates from patients with herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) with HSV-1 strains isolated from oral cutaneous lesions (OCL) in patients lacking neurological symptoms . When we employed a two-chamber cell culture (i~ 1992 Academic Press Limited T . Bergstrom et al. system of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons as an in vitro model of neuroinvasiveness, the replication after infection of the neuritic extensions of the HSEderived strains was significantly greater as compared with the OCL isolates .\" These findings probably reflected an enhanced neuritic uptake of virus, including fusion of the viral envelope with the neuritic extensions .\" Likewise, the HSE-derived isolates were significantly more virulent by a peripheral, snout inoculation in mice, but not after intracranial (i .c .) infection . These results indicated a difference in neurovirulence .\"\n\nIn the present study, we have used monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to map regions of importance for the high degree of neuroinvasiveness of the HSEderived HSV-1 strain 2762 . 10,11 The panel of MAbs used was reactive against HSV-coded glycoproteins gB, gC, gD and gE, which have been reported to be involved in the early virus-cell interactions such as attachment and fusion . 12-16 Also, the neuroinvasiveness of different hybridoma-derived mutants of the strain 2762 was studied .\n\nStrain 2762 was isolated from a brain biopsy of a 58year-old man with a focal encephalitis that later proved to be fatal . The isolate was typed as HSV-1 by an EIA using type-specific MAbs . 17 As earlier described, this strain showed a high degree of neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness in vivo and in vitro, respectively .\", \" Low passage material (maximum 3) of the strain was used, maintaining the original neuroinvasiveness . A variant of the strain (2762pll) was obtained after passage 11 times on green monkey kidney (GMK-AH1) cells . This variant of the virus demonstrated as will be shown reduced capacity of neuroinvasion . Virus stocks were prepared on GMK-AH1 cells, and stored at -70\u00b0C . Infectivity titres were assayed by conventional techniques, and were expressed as plaque-forming units (pfu) ml -' . Briefly, GMK-AH1 cells were grown in 5 cm plastic dishes with 1 % methyl cellulose in Eagle's MEM as the overlaying medium . HSV-1 strains F and HSV-2 strain B4327UR were used for production of immunization and EIA antigens . For both the 2762 strain and the 2762pll variant the particle/pfu ratio was one .\n\nProduction and screening of MAbs HSV-1 and HSV-2 antigens for WB were prepared by infecting HEp-2 cells, and after 24 h incubation, cells were pelleted, solubilized in sample buffer (0-07M Tris-CI, pH 6 . 8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol and bromophenol blue dye) at 100\u00b0C for 8 min and ultrasonicated . Antigens were separated on SDS-PAGE as described above, and transferred to a nitrocellulose paper using a trans-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) . Strips were washed and incubated with monoclonal antibodies overnight at room temperature . Peroxidase-labelled rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (Code no . P260, Dakopatts a/s, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used as conjugate and orthodianisidine as substrate .\n\nFor indirect EIA, type-specific, immunosorbentpurified antigens were prepared as described pre-Briefly, female BALB/c mice were immunized by subcutaneous injection of a deoxycholate-solubilized membrane fraction of HSV-1 strain F infected BALB/c embryonic mice cells, or a Triton X-100 solubilized membrane fraction of HSV-2 strain B4327UR infected T 3 T cells .\" Spleen cells from immunized BALB/c mice were fused with FO cells' $ by using polyethylene glycol . The hybrids were selected in HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterine and thymidine) culture medium and subcloned by limiting dilution . The antibody reactivity was tested in EIA by means of HSV typespecific and type-common antigens in EIA . Subclass specificity was determined by peroxidase-conjugated class-specific anti-mouse reagens (Nordic Immunol . Lab ., Tilburg, The Netherlands) . The immunoglobulin concentration in the culture supernatants were determined by the Mancini technique.\" Large quantities of MAbs were produced by growing hybridoma cells in dialysis tubing as described previously . 21, 22 Radioimmunoprecipitation, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting and EIA viously . 23 Briefly, Triton X-100 solubilized membrane fractions from HSV-1 and HSV-2 infected BHK-21 cells were subjected to affinity chromatography using HSV glycoprotein (gB-1, gC-1, gD-1, gE-1 and gG-2) specific monoclonal antibodies coupled to CNBractivated Sepharose . For HSV-1 and HSV-2 typecommon antigens, deoxycholate-solubilized membrane fractions of HSV infected BHK-21 cells were used .\" For coating of EIA plates all antigens were diluted in sodium carbonate buffer pH 9 . 6 . After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (Code no . 115-036-062, Jackson Immunores . Lab . Inc ., West Grove, PA), ortho-phenylenediamine (Abbot Lab ., Chicago) was used as substrate and the plates were read at 490 nm .\n\nHybridoma cells producing MAbs to HSV glycoproteins gB-1, gC-1, gD-1 and gE-1 were infected with HSV-1 strain 2762 in order to generate viral mutants as described earlier for coronavirus JHM by Wege et al.\" Virus inocula of 0. 1 to 0 . 2 pfu cell -' were used, and the adsorption (1 h, 37\u00b0C) was terminated by rinsing the cells with culture medium . Hybridoma cells were kept in culture for 3 weeks before virus strains were harvested . The strains were titrated and plaque-purified in the presence of the respective MAb . Virus stocks were prepared as described above . Antigens were prepared from the hybridoma mutants for characterization of the strains by RI p23 and EIA . 19\n\nTo study the interaction between HSV and nerve extensions, the two-chamber technique according to Campenot 26 was applied as described previously .\" Briefly, dissociated embryonic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells of Sprague-Dawley rats were cultured in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum and antibiotics on a collagen coat inside a glass cylinder placed in the middle of a plastic dish .\n\nThe use of mitosis inhibitors prevented outgrowth of fibroblasts and other dividing cells, and the addition of nerve growth factor stimulated the neuronal cells to differentiate . Neuritic extensions penetrated the methylcellulose and silicone grease, which kept the central glass cylinder in place and acted as a diffusion-tight barrier sealing off the inner culture chamber (the cylinder) from the outer chamber (the dish) . The two-chamber system allows the infection of neurites in the outer chamber without simultaneous exposure to HSV of a neuronal cell soma in the inner culture compartment .\n\nThe effects of the different MAbs on HSV replication were investigated in DRG cells, FR cells (a foetal rat skin-derived cell line, ATCC no . CRL 1213) and GMK-AH1 cells . All three cell types were infected with the strain 2762 (dilution 5 . 0 x 10 6 pfu ml -') pre-incubated with the different MAbs (dilution 1 .tg ml -') for 2 h at 4\u00b0C . For DRG cells, 1 ml of each MAb-virus mixture was added to the outer chamber of the cultures in quadruplicates, and adsorption was allowed for 1 h at 37\u00b0C . After rinsing, cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20 h and frozen at -70\u00b0C . In each experiment, three to four MAbs were tested and results were compared with controls infected with strain 2762 alone . For MAbs of interest, the experiments were repeated in sixtuplicates using both strain 2762 and its variant 2762p11 in the same assay .\n\nFor replication assays on GMK-AH1 and FR cells, the procedure was repeated with the exception that a virus inoculum of approximately 0 . 1 pfu cell -' was used . Furthermore, cells were grown in 24-well plates, and each MAb was tested in sixtuplicates .\n\nThe hybridoma mutants of the strain 2762, as well as its variant 2762p11, were assayed for viral replication after outer chamber infection of DRG cultures and in GMK-AH1 cells . The concentration and volume of virus were those described above, but the virus was not pre-incubated with MAbs .\n\nGroups of five Swiss albino mice (3-4 weeks of age) were infected with 10 log dilutions of the viruses . The virus was inoculated i .c . in the left temporal region (0 . 025 ml) and onto the snout after superficial scraping (0 . 1 ml) . The concentration of the inoculum per animal were for i .c . infection 10\u00b0-105 pfu and for snout inoculation 10 2-10 6 pfu . All groups of mice were coded and observed twice daily for 2 weeks after i .c . infection and for 3 weeks after nose inoculation . For estimation of virulence, log (pfu/LD 5\u00b0) was calculated for each strain . influence on replication of strain 2762, it reduced the production of the passage virus 2762p11, compatible with a gB-mediated effect on the nerve cell infection . MAb C4D5G2 (anti-gD) reduced replication of both viruses and MAb 4G2G5 (anti-gE) did not affect the rate of infection significantly .\n\nIn another set of experiments the 2762 virus was used for infecting hybridoma cell lines (see the MAbs listed in Table 3 , and in addition the anti-gC MAbs B1C1B4 and C2H12H5) . In spite of repeated attempts, cell line 1B11D8 did not produce a viable virus . With all the other hybridomas tested, viable mutants were obtained . EIA antigens were now produced, and the reactivity to all the different MAbs was assayed . The pattern observed suggested alteration of the one epitope only corresponding to the MAb of the hybridoma cell line tested . An illustrative example (B1C1B4) is presented in Fig . 1 .\n\nRIP of the hybridoma mutants with polyclonal sera to HSV glycoproteins did not suggest any gross differences in molecular weight between the mutated glycoproteins and the parental strain 2762 (three representative examples are shown in Fig . 2 ) .\n\nWe next assayed the capacity of the mutants to produce virus infectious for neuritic extensions (outer chamber inoculation) of DRG cultures . Two mutants, B3G11B8 (gB) and 4G2G5 (gE), then demonstrated a reduced capacity to infect and replicate in DRG cells (Fig. 3) . In contrast, the yields using the GMK-AH1 cells were identical or only insignificantly reduced . Finally, we have investigated in vivo neurovirulence after inoculation of mice with strain 2762 and the 2762pl1 variant (Table 4 ) . After peripheral inoculation of mice, the strain 2762pll showed reduced neurovirulence not demonstrable by i .c . inoculation . The hybridoma-derived mutants, B3G11E8 and 4G2G5, were both associated with reduced virulenc\u00e8 nl=non-lethal with the inocula used .\n\nHSV-1 neuroinvasiveness 47 after i .c . inoculation, and were non-lethal with the peripheral inoculation route (Table 4) .\n\nHSV-1 strains isolated from brains of patients with encephalitis displayed both an enhanced neuroinvasiveness in an in vitro assay using cultured rat dorsal root ganglion neurons 10 and increased neurovirulence in a mouse model with peripherally (snout-) inoculated animals,\" as compared with strains of oral or cutaneous origin . In the present study, we have selected one of the strains (2762) with proven encephalitogenic properties in man, to define the viral gene region of importance for neuroinvasiveness . This property, as demonstrated by our in vitro assay, was not genetically stable, since multiple passage of the virus strain yielded a variant, 2762pl1, which disclosed markedly reduced neuroinvasiveness .\n\nSince all wild-type HSV-1 strains we have investigated have shown the ability to infect almost any neuronal cell type, an in vitro model of neuroinvasiveness will at best reveal relative differences between isolates . Utilizing cell cultures of neuroblastoma cells, astrocytes, as well as with non-neuronal cells such as fibroblasts and epithelial cells, no correlation was found between viral replication and in vivo neuroinvasiveness' 0, \" (T . Bergstrom et al ., submitted) . One reason why the dual-chamber model of rat sensory neurons could discriminate encephalitis-causing HSV-1 strains from ordinary oral isolates could be that this model focuses on early interactions (i .e . attachment and/or fusion) between virus and neuritic extensions .\"\n\nThese early interactions are dependent on functions of viral envelope glycoproteins such as gB, gC, gD and gE, 12_16 which is why we screened MAbs for effects on the infection of the neuritic extensions in Recent studies on gB HSV-1 escape mutants have indicated that glycoprotein B is essential for virus penetration, and that minor variations will result in greatly altered functions such as prevention of cellto-cell spread .\" It is noteworthy that the hybridoma producing the gB-reactive MAb 1B11D8 in our study was unpermissive to infection with strain 2762 . It has earlier been reported that transfer of a gB fragment from an avirulent strain was associated with loss of pathogenicity after peripheral infection with the neuroinvasive strain ANGpath in transfection experiments .\" A more detailed analysis of gB of the strain 2762 and its 2762pll variant, and an epitope mapping of the gB-reactive MAbs 1 B11 D8 and B3G11 E8 may provide information relevant for the genetic mapping of HSV neuroinvasiveness ."}
