{"title": "", "body": "H ealthcare personnel (HCP) can acquire influenza from patients or transmit influenza to patients. [1] [2] [3] Vaccination of HCP for influenza is important to reduce transmission of influenza in healthcare settings. 3 Influenza outbreaks in hospitals and longterm care settings have been associated with low vaccination coverage among HCP. [3] [4] [5] Annual influenza vaccination has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for HCP since 1984. 6 In April 2009, a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged in the U.S., and within weeks it had spread to every region in the country. 7 In July 2009, the ACIP issued recommendations regarding the use of a new monovalent vaccine against infection with the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus. 7 HCP was one of f\u0131ve initial target groups to be recommended to receive the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine (2009 H1N1 vaccine) when it became available in October 2009. 7 The current study mainly addresses and examines the following questions: (1) What is the national 2009 H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccination coverage (seasonal and/or H1N1) among HCP and non-HCP? (2) What are \n\nOf the 130,774 adults, 12.3% (16,975) were HCP. Of those who worked within the healthcare setting, 41.3% had no direct patient contact and 58.7% had direct patient contact. Overall, H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccination coverage were 34.1%, 52.4%, and 58.0%, respectively, which were higher than those for non-HCP (19.1%, 34.9%, and 40.3%, respectively). Across the majority of subgroups, H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccination coverage were higher among HCP compared with non-HCP (Table 1) . H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccination coverage among HCP with direct patient contact were 38.1%, 55.8%, and 61.6%, respectively (data not shown), which were signif\u0131cantly higher than those for HCP.\n\nIn univariate analysis, among HCP, H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccination coverage were lower for non-Hispanic blacks (21.7%, 39.4%, and 43.9%, respectively) and Hispanics (27.7%, 44.4%, and 49.7%, respectively) compared to non-Hispanic whites (37.3%, 56.9%, and 62.3%, respectively; Table 1 ). H1N1 vaccination coverage among HCP was higher among those who reported being male, having higher education, having higher income, being married, having access to a primary care physician, formerly or never smoking, and having health insurance. Additionally, people who needed to see a doctor but could not, and those who had not had a routine checkup within the past 1 year were less likely to be vaccinated (Table 1) . Factors associated with seasonal and any-dose vaccinations were similar to factors associated with H1N1 vaccination. Adjusted coverage estimates from the multivariable model did not differ greatly from the crude vaccination coverage. Overall, factors independently associated with H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccinations were similar. Characteristics independently associated with an increased likelihood of H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccinations among HCP were being non-Hispanic white, having higher income, having a high-risk condition, having health insurance, having the ability to see a doctor if needed, and having a routine checkup in the previous year ( Figure 1 ). Using the state-specif\u0131c f\u0131gures, the 2009 H1N1, seasonal influenza, and any-dose influenza vaccination coverage among HCP and non-HCP were correlated (r \u03ed0.8, 0.5, and 0.6, respectively).\n\nHealthcare personnel were more likely to be vaccinated with H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccine than those who were non-HCP; even among HCP, only about one in three received H1N1 vaccination and about one in two received seasonal-only or any-dose vaccination. Overall, H1N1 vaccination coverage among HCP (34.1%) was lower than usual seasonal influenza vaccination coverage among HCP in recent seasons (50%-62%), including the seasonal coverage reported in our analysis, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] which was well below the Healthy People 2020 objectives of 90%. 16 Despite HCP being included in the initial target groups recommended by the ACIP to receive the H1N1 vaccination, vaccination coverage was low. Vaccine unavailability at the time of epidemic activity may have contributed to the low H1N1 vaccination coverage. 7, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] One study 22 showed that 17.3% of unvaccinated HCP listed unavailability of 2009 H1N1 vaccine as a reason for nonvaccination. 15 In addition, not all healthcare settings offered worksite influenza vaccination. Worksite vaccination could signif\u0131cantly increase seasonal and H1N1 vaccination coverage among HCP, but one study 22 showed that one third of healthcare settings did not offer on-site vaccination for HCP.\n\nVaccination coverage among HCP for H1N1 and seasonal influenza varied widely by state. Variation by state in vaccination coverage among the general adult population also has been observed. 23 Factors that may have contributed to the wide variation in vaccination coverage include the following: epidemic activity had virtually declined or disappeared in many southern states when vaccine became available, whereas it was still ongoing in many northern states 18 -20 ; wide variations in state-specif\u0131c vaccination program and pandemic planning preparation: states that were well prepared for a pandemic may have found it easier to implement vaccination programs on very short notice 24 ; and differences in the effectiveness of specif\u0131c intervention programs being implemented by states (i.e., commu-nity campaigns, provider-based strategies, and workplace vaccination). 24, 25 Influenza vaccination among HCP legislation also may influence vaccination coverage. During the time of the pandemic, eight states had influenza vaccination legislation requirements among HCP, either to offer (seven states) or ensure vaccination (one state). 26 Of those eight states, six had influenza vaccination coverage among HCP that was higher than the national average, which may indicate that legislation requirements help increase vaccination coverage. Vaccination coverage among HCP may be further increased when more states recommend or require influenza vaccination for HCP. In the current study, vaccination coverage was found to be higher among HCP who have a regular physician and have visited a physician for a routine checkup within 1 year than among those who did not. Physician contacts play an important role in vaccination uptake. 13, 14 HCP may have more-frequent contacts than do non-HCPs with their healthcare providers. Routine physician visits can provide important opportunities for providers to vaccinate HCP. The current study found that race/ethnicity, income, highrisk conditions status, and health insurance status were also independently associated with vaccination. Those f\u0131ndings concurred with those of previous studies. 13, 14 Studies showed that 2009 H1N1 vaccination coverage among HCP in other countries was 18% in Italy and 22% in Spain. Coverage among HCP was 92% in South Korea and 79% in Thailand. [27] [28] [29] [30] There are likely factors that contribute to higher coverage. A well-prepared vaccination plan with strong support from hospital administrators, free vaccine, and well-distributed H1N1 pandemic information may have contributed to the higher vaccination coverage among HCP in South Korea and Thailand. 29, 30 In addition, Thailand was a SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epicenter and has been dealing with H5N1 (avian influenza) outbreaks. [31] [32] [33] This past experience probably increased support for pandemic planning and implementation.\n\nThe f\u0131ndings in this paper are subject to several limitations. First, BRFSS is a landline, telephone-based survey that excludes people without telephones and those with only cellular phones and thus may produce a biased coverage estimate 34 ; however, weight was adjusted to account for people without landline telephones and people with cell phone only. 8, 34 Second, vaccination status is self-reported and is subject to recall bias. However, self-reported influenza vaccination status has been shown to have relatively high agreement with medical records among older adults. [35] [36] [37] Comprehensive strategies are needed to further improve uptake of vaccination coverage for HCP. Recommended approaches include emphasizing the benef\u0131ts of HCP vaccination for staff and patients; considering the level of vaccination coverage among HCP to be one measure of patient safety and quality assurance; electronic tracking of coverage levels by ward, unit, and occupation; providing vaccinations in the workplace so they are easily accessible; and implementing catch-up vaccination programs for HCP who are already employed and ensuring that newly hired HCP receive necessary vaccinations. 2 "}
