{"title": "Worldwide Reduction in MERS Cases and Deaths since 2016", "body": "While to date this high-threat zoonotic respiratory pathogen typically has not caused outbreaks in community settings, it has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to cause large-scale outbreaks in healthcare settings in several countries including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the United Arab Emirates and the Republic of Korea (ROK) with substantial public health, security and economic impacts (Appendix Figure 1) (1).\n\nThe prevention and control measures invested in to reduce MERS-CoV incidence included better surveillance in dromedary camel (1,2) and human (3) (4) (5) populations, rapid and accurate detection of cases and human-to-human-transmission clusters, risk assessment, transparency and information sharing with affected countries, to WHO and externally, evidencebased policy development and revisions (3) (4) (5) (6) , and improvements in basic infection prevention and control measures in healthcare settings.\n\nWithin WHO databases, human cases were classified as secondary cases due to humanto-human transmission if they reported recent direct contact with a known MERS patient and/or were identified as a household, occupational or healthcare worker contact of a known MERS patient in the 14 days before symptom onset. For these analyses, we treated all other cases as community-acquired recognizing that this category will include cases resulting from unidentified human-to-human transmission (Appendix Figure 1 Table) . These were each highly significantly (p < 0.001) lower than expected based on the incidence in 2014-2015 (334, 334 and 251, respectively).\n\nOur analysis has several limitations. First, for a virus like MERS-CoV that can cause super-spreading events, it may be challenging to test the hypothesis that human-to-human Page 3 of 6 transmissibility changed over time because superspreading events can cause high variability in cluster sizes, even in the absence of change. We may therefore have limited power to demonstrate here a significant reduction in human-to-human transmission; analysis of more detailed data capturing the complex transmission dynamics observed in human clusters could prove useful (9) . Second, classification of cases as human-to-human transmitted or not Although the trend needs to be confirmed by more detailed analyses, the apparent reduction in human-to-human transmission in healthcare facilities, particularly in the KSA since 2016, and the lack of onward human-to-human transmission in recently exported cases to the United Kingdom (10) and the ROK in 2018 (11) , is likely to be at least partly explained by early suspicion and isolation of cases, immediate case management, improvements in standard infection prevention and initiating control measures and comprehensive identification, follow-up and laboratory testing of all high-risk contacts.\n\nWhen we look at reported data from 2014/2015, the apparent clusters thus appear smaller on average than was actually true. This also happens 2016-2018*, but to a lesser extent if human-to-human transmission were identified more consistently later. Thus, any cluster size reduction we observe between 2014/2015 and subsequent years is likely an underestimate of the true reduction in human-to-human transmission."}
