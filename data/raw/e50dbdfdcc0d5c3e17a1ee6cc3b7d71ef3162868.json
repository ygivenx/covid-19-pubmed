{"title": "Stabilization of the coronavirus pandemic in Italy and global prospects", "body": "Here, we consider the development of epidemic outbreak in Italy caused by coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) (see e.g., [1] ). Some investigations of the epidemic spreading in mainland China [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] could be useful to understand the epidemic outbreak in other countries, since we deal with the same pathogen. A preliminary comparison of the epidemic dynamics in Italy and in mainland China has been done in [8, 9] . In [10] the global coronavirus epidemic dynamics was analyzed. In this paper we will use the official WHO daily data [1] for the confirmed accumulated number of patients (victims) V(t) (number of persons who caught the infection and got sick; t is time measured in days), the SIR model [11] [12] [13] [14] and the statistics-based method of parameter identification [14] in order to calculate the pandemic characteristics and to make some estimations and predictions. 2  9  2036  2732  64  5753   3  10  2502  3367  108  7341   4  11  3089  4307  129  8993   5  12  3858  5820  148  11197   6  13  4636  7491  213  14347   7  14  5883  9453  213  17593   8  15  7375  12242  213  21291   9  16  9172  15130  472  25265   10  17  10149  18124  696  29609   11  18  12462  23112  987  36410   12  19  15113  28892  1264  43788   13  20  17660  36263  1678  53427   14  21  21157  45060  1678 All rights reserved.

The corresponding moments of time t j (in days) are also shown in Table 1 .\n\nThe SIR model for an infectious disease [6, [11] [12] [13] [14] relates the number of susceptible persons S (persons who are sensitive to the pathogen and not protected); the number of infected is I (persons who are sick and spread the infection; please don't confuse with the number of still ill persons, so known active cases) and the number of removed R (persons who no longer spread the infection; this number is the sum of isolated, recovered, dead, and infected people who left the region); \uf061 and \uf072 are constants.\n\nTo determine the initial conditions for the set of equations (1-3), let us suppose that at the moment of the epidemic outbreak 0 t , [6, 14] :\n\nThe analytical solution for the set of equations (1-3) was obtained by introducing the function\n\n, corresponding to the number of victims or cumulative confirmed number of cases, [14] :\n\nThe solution for the SIR set of differential equations depends on four parameters N, \uf061 ,\n\nwhich can be identified with the use of the statistical approach developed in [14] .\n\nThis method and V j data set for Italy were used to define the optimal (the most reliable) values of four parameters and calculate numbers of infected I , susceptible S, removed R persons and the number of victims V=I+R . Corresponding dependences versus time are shown in Fig. 1 .\n\nUsually the number of cases during the initial period of an epidemic outbreak is not reliable. To avoid their influence on the results, only V j values for the period February 5-22, 2020 (12 29 j t \uf0a3 \uf0a3 ) were used for calculations (see blue \"circles\" in Fig. 1 ). Other points were used only for comparison All rights reserved.

The use of data corresponding the initial stage of the epidemic (\"circles\" and \"triangles\" together) did not yield a stable reliable prediction. The calculated optimal values of parameters are: in [9] (on March 24 the accumulated number of cases confirmed in mainland China is 81848, see [1] , situation report No 65). On March 9, 2020 it was calculated that the epidemic in Italy develops more rapid than it was in China, [15] . Unfortunately, this conclusion seems to be true.\n\nFor Italy: numbers of infected I (green line), removed R (black line) and the number of victims V=I+R (blue line); \"circles\" correspond to the confirmed accumulated number of cases taken for calculations; \"triangles\" correspond to the cases during initial stage of the epidemic; \"stars\" -last two data points used only for a verification of the prediction. Brawn, red and magenta markers represent respectively the numbers of cases in European region, USA and in the World (without cases in mainland China and South Korea); corresponding dashed lines fit the points.

By mid-April 2020, there will still be more than thousand people spreading the infection in Italy (see green line in Fig. 1 ).\n\nThe calculated value 0 t and blue line in Fig. 1 March 24) is much smaller than in Italy.\n\nAll the parameters in SIR model are supposed to be constant. If the quarantine measures and speed of isolation change or new infected persons are coming in the country, the accuracy of the prediction reduces.\n\nSince the recent situation in mainland China and the Republic of Korea is stable, The estimations of global pandemic prospects have been done without cases in this two regions. The corresponding numbers V Gj are shown in the last column of Table 1 and in the Fig. 1 (magenta \"circles\"). The number of cases V Ej and V Uj are also shown in Fig. 1 (brown and red \"circles\" respectively). It can be seen that V Ej , V Uj and V Gj numbers follow straight lines in the logarithmic scale. It means that the epidemic dynamics in these regions is still exponential and is far from stabilization.\n\nTo estimate the slopes of these lines the linear regression for the values log( ), , ,\n\nwas used (see, e.g., [14, 17] ).

Let us hope that quarantine measures and fast isolation of infected persons will reduce these sad figures."}
